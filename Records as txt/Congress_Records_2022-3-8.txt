LOW COLLEGE ENROLLMENT IS 
NOT A CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, college 
enrollment decreased this year by a 
million students. Although many claim 
dropping enrollment is a crisis, this is 
a once-in-a-generation opportunity. 
This is an opportunity to see that 
Americans are making more decisions 
that are best for them. This is an op-
portunity for Americans to see that 
college is not the only pathway to a 
successful career. This is an oppor-
tunity for institutions of higher edu-
cation to rethink how best to serve 
students. 
As the Republican leader of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee and a 
former educator, I know the impor-
tance of giving every American the op-
portunity to climb the economic ladder 
through pursuit of postsecondary edu-
cation. 
Yet, the college-for-all mentality has 
forced many Americans to obtain ex-
pensive degrees which may not prepare 
them for a satisfying career when they 
could have thrived on an alternative 
career path. It also allowed institu-
tions to maintain the status quo of 
high prices and often questionable 
value. 
College is not the only pathway to a 
fulfilling career. Falling college enroll-
ment could demonstrate that more 
Americans are weighing the cost of col-
lege and deciding it just might not be 
worth it. 
A study by the Foundation for Re-
search on Equal Opportunity found 
that the return on investment for ob-
taining a bachelor’s degree varies sig-
nificantly. The report found that 37 
percent of the programs have negative 
returns on investment, meaning that 
students will be financially worse off 
for having participated in those pro-
grams. 
Students can benefit from college 
only if they complete their degree. His-
torically, about 900,000 students leave 
college without finishing each year, ac-
cording to Michael Petrilli, president 
of Fordham Institute. Petrilli surmises 
that individuals not registering for col-
lege could be some of the same stu-
dents who would have dropped out any-
way. 
The roughly 40 percent of students 
who leave college without a degree are 
often left with a mountain of student 
debt and no wage increase to help pay 
it off. For these students it may have 
been a better option to enter the work-
force, pursue a skilled profession, or 
put off college until the time was right 
rather than conforming to societal 
norms. 
The fact that college enrollment is 
down signals that more Americans are 
doing just that—that is, making deci-
sions that are better for their lives and 
families. As more young people come 
to realize that college is not always a 
golden ticket, they are embracing al-
ternative career paths. 
For example, more Americans are 
participating in apprenticeship pro-
grams or obtaining an associate degree 
in a high-skilled trade like welding 
technology or respiratory therapy. 
We should celebrate our country’s di-
verse workforce, not belittle it. Look-
ing down on careers in critical indus-
tries, especially during a historic labor 
shortage, is shortsighted. We should 
encourage more Americans to obtain 
the skills needed for these in-demand 
jobs. 
College is not the only way for Amer-
icans to move up economically. Many 
careers, particularly those in high- 
skilled trades, can lead to high and sta-
ble incomes. Most importantly, declin-
ing enrollments may be the wake-up 
call colleges and universities needed to 
finally convince them that they must 
change to meet the demands of stu-
dents, families, and our workforce. 
The cost of attending college has ex-
ploded while student outcomes have re-
mained stagnant. Why would we expect 
any different when the Federal Govern-
ment, using taxpayer dollars, is willing 
to write universities a blank check 
without requiring any accountability 
to students and taxpayers? 
It is time for these institutions to 
get serious about providing an afford-
able education that will prepare stu-
dents for the workforce. The drop in 
college enrollment shows that America 
is ready to change its attitude on ‘‘col-
lege-for-all’’ and accept that there are

several pathways to the American 
Dream and lifelong success. 
f 
BIDEN AGENDA AND CHILDREN’S 
MENTAL HEALTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, last week President Joe Biden 
delivered a strong State of the Union 
address focused on building a better 
America. 
Our jobs recovery is strong and well 
underway, as noted by the most recent 
numbers, which shows unprecedented 
job growth so far under this President. 
More than 7.3 million jobs have been 
created by President Biden’s very first 
year in office, even with the challenges 
posed by omicron and delta COVID 
variants. But we have so much more to 
do in this never-ending process of 
building a more perfect Union. 
One area highlighted by the Presi-
dent was his desire to prioritize mental 
health needs in our country, particu-
larly among our children. Our country 
faces an unprecedented mental health 
crisis in which our youth have been 
particularly impacted. 
A number of mental health organiza-
tions have declared a youth mental 
health crisis and our surgeon general 
has issued an advisory calling it ‘‘an 
urgent public health crisis.’’ 
Today, I rise as we celebrate School 
Social Work Week, to talk about one 
way to help address that issue by sup-
porting and investing in school social 
workers. 
First, I just want to take an oppor-
tunity to thank our school social work-
ers who work every single day to make 
a difference in the lives of their stu-
dents and their families. School social 
workers are responsible for fostering 
students’ social and emotional well- 
being so that they are ready to learn. 
As trained mental health professionals, 
social workers can deliver a wide spec-
trum of services, from building social 
skills to providing mental health sup-
port. 
Their presence in our schools is in-
valuable and the support they provide 
for students is critical. I personally can 
attest to how school social workers 
make a difference. I would not be here 
if not for the support I received from a 
school social worker when I was a stu-
dent. 
Make 
no 
mistake, 
school 
social 
workers are key members of a school’s 
educational team. Their expertise can 
help guide students through serious life 
challenges, including poverty, addic-
tion, bullying, children whose parents 
are incarcerated, and even the military 
deployment of a family member. 
It is more important, now more than 
ever, to reduce the barriers to mental 
health services for children, especially 
in our schools. As we do, improving ac-
cess to school social workers must be a 
part of those efforts. 
That is why later this week I will in-
troduce, along with my very good 
friend and former professional social 
worker, Representative BARBARA LEE 
of California, my School Social Work-
ers Improving Student Success Act, as 
we create a grant to help schools hire 
additional social workers and retain 
existing school social workers. 
There should be one social worker for 
every 250 students in most schools. In 
high-need schools, one social worker 
for every 50 students. Many schools 
struggle to meet these ratios. 
My bill would also create a National 
Technical Assistance Center for school 
social work to help develop strategies 
for improving the effectiveness of 
school social work and help dissemi-
nate best practices. 
Madam Speaker, I want to say thank 
you to the front-line school social 
workers for the hard work they put in 
every day to help our students succeed. 
It is going to be much more chal-
lenging after COVID. 
I applaud the President for his com-
mitment to take on mental health, es-
pecially among our youth, and to make 
it part of his unity agenda for the Na-
tion that I believe colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle should be able to get 
behind. 
I share his dedication to getting all 
Americans the mental health services 
they need. I look forward to seeing the 
proposals included in his fiscal year 
2023 budget, including to help increase 
access to school-based medical health 
services in which school social workers 
will play a key role. 
I sincerely hope that this House and 
this Congress can come together to ad-
dress our children’s mental health. 
Democrats continue to prioritize ef-
forts to make our economy recover. I 
encourage all Members to consider our 
youth’s mental health. 
f 
HONORING NATORRA MOODY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor Natorra Moody for receiving the 
Alma-Bacon Georgia Library Employee 
of the Year award for 2021. 
Natorra 
has 
exceptionally 
high 
standards for herself, of her coworkers, 
and of our library system, helping to 
maintain the highest caliber of public 
service. 
She is dedicated to serving her com-
munity by leading programs such as a 
prom dress donation campaign which 
helps students who can’t afford formal 
wear by allowing them to borrow the 
dresses freely from the library. 
She regularly participates in commu-
nity events as well to promote her li-
brary and the stellar services it pro-
vides. 
This past year, Natorra has taken on 
the role of managing the Appling Coun-
ty Public Library during the renova-
tion period and beyond. Her dedication, 
hard work, and love originate from a 
simple volunteer position at her local 
library when she was a high school stu-
dent. 
I thank Natorra for all she does to 
benefit others. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF BILL ROBERTS 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of a dedicated member of our com-
munity, as well as a fellow Young Har-
ris alumnus, Bill Roberts of Fayette-
ville, Georgia. 
Bill was the recipient of the Young 
Harris Medallion, the highest honor 
that is bestowed by the college for his 
love and support throughout his years. 
Recruited to come to Young Harris 
as a basketball star, Bill was so much 
more, serving as a champion debater 
and officer of both the SPAT clubs and 
Student Government Association. He 
earned a bachelor’s degree in econom-
ics and continued his basketball career 
at Mercer University, proceeded to 
Georgia State to earn a business and 
accounting degree, and finally received 
a law degree from Woodrow Wilson. 
He served our great State of Georgia 
on the financial side, overseeing mas-
sive construction projects like the 
Georgia Dome and World Congress Cen-
ter. Bill’s expertise was put to use as a 
trustee of the State’s Employees’ Re-
tirement System where he served on 
the Investment Committee and was re-
sponsible 
for 
investing 
retirement 
funds to the humble tune of $12 billion. 
Emeritus trustee for Young Harris, 
distinguished 
alumni, 
veteran, 
and 
loved member of our community are 
just a few of the titles that Bill re-
tained. This is a tremendous loss that 
will be felt by many. 
RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF PAM SOUTHARD 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
service of an incredible Georgian, Pam 
Southard. 
Pam has served as the executive di-
rector of the Greater Pooler Area 
Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bu-
reau. She has selflessly put her heart 
and soul into her position and worked 
to better the city of Pooler in any way 
that she can. 
As the executive director, Pam was 
instrumental in creating the shuttle 
system to and from the annual St. Pat-
rick’s Day celebration in Savannah. 
She also founded the annual Hearts for 
Heroes Gala Fundraiser to help put 
Pooler, Georgia, on the map. This 
upscale, black-tie event has sold out 
for the past 7 years and has been an in-
credible event for our community. 
Throughout her tenure as executive 
director, Pam has overseen substantial 
business growth in the city of Pooler, 
thanks to her guiding hand. Pam has 
truly been the embodiment of what it 
means to be a servant to one’s commu-
nity. 
Her retirement will leave big shoes to 
fill, and we will certainly miss her. We 
are grateful for all that she has done 
for our great city and wish her the best 
as she enters a new stage of her life.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JON LOTT 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of Jon Lott, a devoted Christian, 
full of curiosity, and committed to 
serving everyone he encountered. He 
attended and graduated from Nicholls 
School, where he was senior class presi-
dent and played basketball. 
After high school, Jon would follow 
in his father’s footsteps by attending 
North Georgia University, joining the 
Corps of Cadets. Military life didn’t 
agree with Jon, and he graduated from 
Georgia Southern University. 
Jon would go on to be the president 
of Nicholls State Bank as well as serv-
ing in leadership roles in several other 
banks. At the time of his passing, Jon 
was serving as the executive vice presi-
dent of FNB South, where he had 
worked for almost three decades. 
He was especially proud of the time 
he spent with the Coffee Regional Med-
ical board, further helping his neigh-
bors. 
Jon was a man who was loved and ad-
mired by those who knew him and 
those whom he helped, which were 
many. My thoughts and prayers reside 
with his family, friends, and commu-
nity as they mourn this tremendous 
loss of a friend, neighbor, loved one, 
and servant.

HONORING JOHN ‘‘POPS’’ ARTHUR, 
SR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CA´ RDENAS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor John Arthur, Sr., a 
beloved San Fernando Valley leader 
whom we lost earlier this year. Pops, 
as many of his students called him, was 
known by Men’s Journal Magazine as 
the toughest man in America. 
Born in Starkville, Mississippi, Pops 
attended 
Clark 
Atlanta 
University 
with an athletic scholarship. He met 
the love of his life, Jeraldine, and they 
had a beautiful daughter, Jonvette. He 
worked as an underground bare-knuck-
le fighter with a black belt in various 
martial arts. He also worked as an un-
dercover FBI agent and had various 
public safety roles. 
After the passing of his wife, Pops 
moved to southern California with his 
beautiful daughter. There, he worked 
as a trainer with fitness personality 
Billy Blanks and trained various world 
champion 
fighters 
such 
as 
James 
Toney. 
However, after a vibrant career train-
ing some of the world’s most recogniz-
able names, Pops found his true calling 
when he began coaching at-risk youth 
for free. He impacted countless fami-
lies in our community by training 
their little children about life—not 
about fighting, but about life. 
Pops dedicated his life to helping 
others and creating champions. A leg-
end himself, Pops was truly a force of 
good in our community and in our 
world. For many reasons, I honor the 
life of the toughest man in America, 
John ‘‘Pops’’ Arthur. 
UNITED STATES REMAINS A BEACON OF HOPE 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
am thankful for the opportunity to 
speak before the House, and it is an 
honor to be a Member of this pres-
tigious body. With that, I would like to 
take the opportunity to explain and ex-
claim how our hearts in America go 
out to the people of Ukraine as they 
fear for their lives and they flee this 
tragedy that is caused by Russia and 
Vladimir Putin. 
It is unfortunate that there are many 
people around the world right now as 
we speak who have, unfortunately, had 
to flee their country, flee their homes, 
in fear of people like Vladimir Putin 
and others who create atrocities on 
them, their communities, and their 
country. 
I want to just remind everybody that 
the United States of America continues 
to be the beacon of hope, light, and life 
for everyone who needs to seek asylum. 
There are opportunities for us and 
many, many great countries around 
the world to embrace these people who 
are fleeing these unspeakable horrors. 
It is very important for us to under-
stand that we are great when our arms 
are open. We are great when we receive 
those who are less fortunate. We are 
great, and our greatness comes from so 
many of us who come from families 
who fled their country, who left atroc-
ities so that they can have a new life 
for them, but more importantly, for 
the next generation, the next, and the 
next. 
Once again, the United States of 
America shall always remain the place 
where people can seek refuge when 
they are fleeing atrocities like we are 
witnessing in Ukraine and other parts 
of the world.

HONORING LANDER UNIVERSITY’S 
150TH ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. 
DUNCAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise to honor the 150th anni-
versary of Lander University, one of 
the greatest universities in the Third 
District of South Carolina and the fast-
est growing public university in our 
State. 
Lander 
was 
founded 
in 
1872 
in 
Williamston, 
South 
Carolina, 
as 
Williamston Female College by the 
Reverend Samuel Lander, who served 
as the institution’s first president. 
That is a factoid that I didn’t know 
until I started learning about their 
150th anniversary. 
The institution later moved to its 
current campus in Greenwood, South 
Carolina, in the heart of the Third Dis-
trict back in 1903. Williamston Female 
College was later renamed Lander Col-
lege in honor of its founder and began 
admitting men in 1943. 
On July 1, 1973, Lander College be-
came a State-supported institution of 
higher learning after authorization 
from the South Carolina General As-
sembly. After another period of growth 
under the leadership of President Larry 
Jackson, Lander College changed its 
name again to Lander University in 
1992. 
Today, 
the 
university 
celebrates 
record growth, with more students 
choosing Lander University to con-
tinue their education than at any other 
time in the university’s history. The 
university’s continued growth over the 
past century-and-a-half and the impact 
the institution has had on the Third 
Congressional District and the State of 
South Carolina is exceptional. 
Lander University offers high-de-
mand and market-driven programs in a 
rich 
liberal 
arts 
environment 
to 
produce highly qualified and market-
able graduates. The university now of-
fers over 90 in-demand bachelor’s and 
master’s programs that produce career- 
ready graduates who have the tech-
nical, interpersonal, and professional 
skills they need to succeed in the 
workplace and the world thanks to 
their liberal arts education from Land-
er. 
Now, Lander is a special place to me 
personally as I was a Lander Univer-
sity parent. My oldest son is a proud 
Lander alumnus and currently works 
for the university. 
Go Bearcats, and congratulations on 
150 years. 
Madam Speaker, I want to mention 
one other thing. 
In 2018, Democrats were hollering 
about gas prices, hollering just because 
President Trump was in the White 
House. 
Look at gas prices today. I would 
love to hear you holler now. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair.

HONORING DR. PAUL FARMER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Dr. PAUL 
Farmer, a visionary in global health, 
crusader for health equity, and accom-
plished physician with an unparalleled 
passion for social justice. 
Dr. Farmer was my mentor, my pro-
fessor, and my friend. He was com-
pletely selfless, and his relentless dedi-
cation to those less fortunate inspired 
me and helped shape me into who I am 
today. 
His story begins in North Adams, 
Massachusetts, in 1959. He spent his 
childhood there and later in Tampa, 
Florida, where he was raised in an old 
school bus that his father had con-
verted into a mobile home. 
Encouraged by his parents, Dr. Farm-
er developed a strong interest in the

world around him at an early age. His 
intellect and incredible work ethic led 
him to excel in school and eventually 
to win a full scholarship to Duke Uni-
versity. It was there, at Duke, where 
his passion for service took root. 
After graduating, he traveled to 
Haiti, where he worked in public health 
clinics before pursuing his medical de-
gree and doctorate in anthropology 
from Harvard University. 
In 1987, Dr. Farmer cofounded what 
would become his legacy, Partners In 
Health, whose mission is to bring mod-
ern medical science and high-quality 
care to those most in need and serve as 
an antidote to despair. Its banner has 
always been ‘‘pragmatic solidarity’’ in 
the fight for health and social justice. 
Dr. Farmer also used his gifts to 
shape young minds and the next gen-
eration of providers. He served as chief 
of the Division of Global Health Equity 
at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in 
Boston and chair of the Department of 
Global Health and Social Medicine at 
Harvard Medical School. 
It was there, at Harvard Medical 
School, where our paths crossed in 
what proved to be one of the biggest 
blessings in my life. As my mentor and 
professor, Dr. Farmer embraced me, 
trained me, taught me, and encouraged 
me in all that I did. 
In short, I blossomed under his guid-
ance. I was empowered under his wings. 
He taught me to channel that very 
same passion that I had as a student- 
activist into fighting for social justice 
with my medical training. 
I remember one day in the class when 
he told us all: All of you are now part 
of the elite. The mere fact that you are 
sitting here at Harvard Medical School 
will make you an elite. 
As someone who grew up in a trailer 
park and was the first generation of 
my family to graduate from high 
school, I immediately resisted that. No 
way. No way. Not me. How dare he say 
that? 
Now, I won’t say what I was thinking 
in that moment, but ever the mind 
reader, Dr. Farmer looked me in the 
eyes and said: ‘‘Yes, you, too, Raul.’’ 
His point was that now that we are at 
Harvard Medical School, we need to 
own that. We need to use our Harvard 
medical training and research skills for 
the poor and give them the best care 
always. It was then that I understood 
the opportunity that I had to make a 
difference and serve those suffering 
from inequities with the care I would 
provide as a doctor. 
I spent many years under his wing, 
learning from him and training with 
him to provide humanitarian aid and 
care. It was in the classroom at Har-
vard, in the rainforests of Chiapas, 
Mexico, and in the aftermath of the 
earthquake in Haiti that I learned from 
Paul the powerful act of accompani-
ment. I admired his humility with the 
people; his fierce advocacy with the 
powerful; his selflessness; and the enor-
mous respect that he showed to all he 
cared for, regardless of income or edu-
cation. He treated everyone as equals 
and worked to earn their respect. 
It is because of him that I stand be-
fore you all today, both as a physician 
and as a representative of the people. 
Dr. Farmer was a great man, a hum-
ble servant, and a fierce warrior for 
health and justice. I miss him, and I 
know the world will, too. 
In his memory, and in honor of all 
that he has done and achieved, I ask 
for all present to join me in a moment 
of silence.

FARM BILL IMPACT SERIES: 
BIOFUELS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, in prep-
aration for reauthorizing the farm bill 
in 2023, I rise today to deliver the next 
installment of my farm bill impact se-
ries, where I am highlighting various 
aspects of the farm bill that deserve 
Congress’ awareness and support. 
If America is going to thrive, then 
the people who feed, fuel, and clothe 
America must thrive, and the farm bill 
contains certain programs that have 
been critical to the success of agricul-
tural producers in my district and the 
energy independence of our country. 
Every committee in this Congress 
should work to develop a sound, 21st 
century energy policy, one that em-
braces American energy independence, 
one that employs an all-of-the-above 
strategy embracing both fossil fuels 
and biofuels, and one that is not a 
mandated approach from the govern-
ment. 
For example, the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee should continue 
to pressure the Biden administration 
to reapprove the Keystone XL pipeline 
while it also considers the Year-Round 
Fuel Choice Act, and the House Agri-
culture Committee should weigh in on 
the enforcement of the renewable fuel 
standard while it also includes strong 
biofuels language in the next farm bill. 
Energy policy has an impact on every 
American and cannot be crafted in a 
vacuum. When it comes to the farm 
bill, we know that we can strengthen 
our access to reliable, affordable, and 
efficient energy, like biofuels. 
The Rural Energy For America Pro-
gram provides financial assistance to 
promote energy independence and effi-
ciency and renewable energy develop-
ment for agricultural producers and 
rural small businesses. 
Kansas Ethanol LLC, based in Lyons, 
Kansas, has utilized the REAP program 
twice. The first time they used it, they 
were able to expand their facility and 
went from producing 65 million gallons 
of ethanol to 80 million gallons of eth-
anol per year. The second time, the 
program helped them put in the infra-
structure to produce their own elec-
tricity. They now produce their own 
heat and power through a gas turbine 
for their facility and export some 
power to the grid. 
As Kansas produces nearly 500 mil-
lion gallons of ethanol each year, pro-
grams like the Biodiesel Fuel Edu-
cation Program and the Biomass Crop 
Assistance Program are important for 
Kansas and for the rest of this country. 
The Biodiesel Fuel Education Program 
awards competitive grants to nonprofit 
organizations and institutes of higher 
education that educate the public, as 
well as government and private enti-
ties, about the benefits of biodiesel fuel 
use. 
b 1030 
The Biomass Crop Assistance Pro-
gram supports the establishment and 
production of eligible crops for conver-
sion to bioenergy and assists agricul-
tural landowners and operators with 
the collection, harvest, storage, and 
transportation of eligible material for 
use in a biomass conversion facility. 
These programs, and many more, are 
investments in the future of our coun-
try, and they must remain strong in 
the 2023 farm bill if America is going to 
be energy independent. That is why the 
farm bill is so important. It is not just 
about food and farming. It is about en-
suring the security and self-determina-
tion of our country. We must support 
not only the efforts of farmers, ranch-
ers, and agriculture producers who aim 
to keep us food-secure, but also the ef-
forts of the renewable energy pioneers 
in our country, like Kansas corn grow-
ers and Kansas sorghum growers who 
aim to keep us energy independent. 
I will be back on the floor soon to de-
liver another installment of my farm 
bill impact series and highlight more 
programs and titles within the bill that 
I believe Congress must understand and 
support to ensure that agriculture 
thrives in America.

CELEBRATING THE EDITH 
FARNSWORTH HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, 
as we mark the beginning of Women’s 
History Month and International Wom-
en’s Day, I rise today to celebrate the 
recent 
renaming 
of 
the 
iconic 
Farnsworth 
House 
to 
the 
Edith 
Farnsworth House. 
Located in Plano, Illinois, the home 
designed by Mies van der Rohe was 
commissioned by Dr. Edith Farnsworth 
in 1945 and today is a National Histor-
ical Landmark and considered a mas-
terpiece of modern architecture. 
I am proud that this piece of archi-
tectural history is located in the 14th 
District of Illinois and that the Na-
tional Trust for Historic Preservation 
is elevating the role of women through-
out history by renaming and rededi-
cating the house for the woman who 
commissioned it. 
Too often, women’s roles in history 
are overlooked and forgotten. That is 
why

National 
Trust’s 
efforts

tory project to recognize places across

have 
changed their communities is so im-
portant, not only to elevate more of 
our history and celebrate women’s con-
tributions to it, but to inspire the next

ers. 
The Edith Farnsworth House is a cul-
tural gem of the 14th District of Illi-
nois that would not have been possible 
without the vision and commitment of 
Dr. Edith Farnsworth. I am proud to 
see this landmark rededicated in her

WE NEED TO RETURN TO ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
what would you do with $1,300? Would 
you go on vacation? Save for your kids’ 
college? Maybe buy some new appli-
ances? 
Well, under the Democrats’ new 
America last energy policies, most 
Americans have little choice but to 
spend $1,300 extra on gas to fill up their 
cars over the course of the next year. 
Today, the price of gas hit an all-time 
high. 
Democrats want to blame surging 
prices on Russia. But the truth is, their 
out-of-touch policies are why we are 
here in the first place. 
Remember what happened on day 1 
with one-party rule? The President 
canceled the Keystone Pipeline, and 
then he stopped new oil and gas leases 
on Federal lands and waters. Then he 
gave the green light to Putin’s pipe-
line. These knee-jerk decisions had 
damaging effects up and down the sup-
ply chain. 
Now, Democrats are creating a fake 
choice between sanctioning Russia and 
lowering gas prices. In their twisted 
thinking, Americans must feel the pain 
at the pump in order to punish Putin. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. 
When 
Democrats’ 
one-party 
rule 
started last year, they inherited an en-
ergy independent America. Average 
prices at the pump were $2.53 a gallon. 
Oh, do we wish we had those days 
again. 
It is still possible to get back to that, 
which is why Republicans offered a bill 
last week that would approve the Key-
stone Pipeline, fast track oil and gas 
production on Federal lands and waters 
and remove all hurdles to exporting 
American natural gas. 
Do the American people wonder what 
happened when we offered that? Two 
hundred 
twenty 
Democrats 
voted 
against it. 
Then we offered targeted solutions to 
the immediate crisis, like approving 
the six natural gas export permits that 
are being held up by the Department of 
Energy. Just approving those six per-
mits could increase U.S. natural gas 
exports by 25 percent. 
But Democrats refused to listen. 
They think our Nation’s future is bet-
ter with leaving our resources in the 
ground, even if that requires us to buy 
oil from Iran or Venezuela and bat-
teries from China. 
It is obvious which party is cham-
pioning clean, affordable American en-
ergy and which party has given up on 
it. It is interesting that American nat-
ural gas is 41 percent cleaner than Rus-
sian natural gas. Why wouldn’t you 
want that to go to Europe and every-
where else? 
If we want to lower prices and pro-
tect 
the 
environment, 
we 
must 
prioritize American energy independ-
ence. 
What is worse, it is not just the 
Biden administration; it is complete 
throughout the Democrats’ administra-
tion, for those who are in governor-
ships as well. Just take a look at my 
home State, Madam Speaker, Cali-
fornia. 
Now, the United States imports from 
Russia 209,000 barrels of crude per day. 
That is 76.3 million barrels of crude per 
year. Of that, California imports from 
Russia 50,265 barrels of crude per day. 
In fact, California imported twice as 
many barrels of oil from Russia in 2021 
than from Canada. So that means this 
money went to Putin to pay for his 
war. 
Just as the Biden administration 
chose to stop the Keystone XL pipe-
line, 
apparently 
Governor 
Newsom 
thinks it is better to buy oil from Rus-
sia than from Canada. California do-
mestic production was 374,000 barrels of 
crude per day in 2021. That has de-
creased under Gavin’s administration, 
89,000 barrels of crude per day less than 
in 2018. 
If you take the analysis, looking at 
the data, if California rolled back the 
Newsom/Biden regulations that are 
crippling oil production in California, 
California could more than offset its 
use of Russian crude and then some. 
The United States could offset 43 per-
cent of its dependence on Russian 
crude if California produced its full ca-
pacity. 
You see, we don’t have to be where 
we are. If the Democrats would change 
their policies of harming America and 
harming the environment by buying 
more Russian oil and gas, we wouldn’t 
be where we are today. The prices 
would be lower, there would be more 
Americans working, and the world 
would be safer. 
f 
BUILDING A BETTER AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and con-
gratulate President Biden and his ad-
ministration following February’s job 
report. 
678,000, that is the total number of 
jobs created last month. But these are 
not just any type of jobs. These jobs 
are good-paying jobs that are giving 
Americans the dignity of a good pay-
check. 
In the last 13 months, 7.4 million jobs 
have been created, and unemployment 
has been slashed from 6.4 percent to 3.8 
percent. When the President took of-
fice, over 18 million people were receiv-
ing unemployment benefits. Today, 
only 2 million people remain. 
The bottom line, Madam Speaker, is 
we are seeing the best economy for 
American workers in decades, with 
people getting higher wages, better 
benefits, and better jobs across the 
board. 
Our national deficit has also seen im-
provement. Under President Biden’s 
watch, the deficit fell by $360 billion 
last year. This is the first deficit de-
cline in more than half a decade. Bet-
ter yet, our Nation is on track to cut 
the deficit even more this year. Biden’s 
plan of action will make sure we con-
tinue our path to building a better 
America. 
But building a better America re-
quires much more than only economic 
success. It also requires healthy com-
munities. I am proud to share that 
America has had much success on the 
public health front during Biden’s first 
year. 
In my home State of Texas, only 10 
percent of the population was fully 
vaccinated this time last year. Today, 
60 percent of the entire population is 
fully vaccinated in Texas. On top of 
that, 21 percent of the population have 
received a booster shot. 
In short, Madam Speaker, our Nation 
is recovering, and we are powering 
through the challenges COVID–19 cre-
ated. 
As we continue to recover from 
COVID–19 and rebuild the economy, we 
also must invest in our infrastructure. 
Investing in roads, bridges, and public 
transportation is critical. Shockingly, 
in America, one in three U.S. bridges 
need repairs or replacement. Biden has 
a plan for that, too. 
There 
are 
4,000 
infrastructure 
projects already planned, alongside 
65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 
bridges scheduled to be repaired. 
But it is not only highways and 
bridges that need repairs and upgrades. 
Our ports need improvements as well. 
In my home area, the Port of Houston 
secured $142,500,000 in new funding be-
cause of the Biden boom. 
In Houston, the transit authority, 
METRO, also received more than $137 
million in Federal funds to strengthen 
local public transportation. 
The best part, Madam Speaker, this 
is only the beginning. I am truly ex-
cited that we are really accomplishing 
much for the American people as we 
work in partnership with President 
Biden and his boom. We truly are 
building a better America for genera-
tions to come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1338 
March 8, 2022 
New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to pay tribute to a decorated 
American war hero, Sergeant Dan 
McBride, Jr., of Silver City, New Mex-
ico. 
Dan passed away at the age of 97 on 
February 16, 2022, and was among the 
prestigious members of New Mexico’s 
and our Nation’s Greatest Generation. 
In 1942, during World War II, Dan en-
listed as a paratrooper in the U.S. 
Army’s 101st Airborne, also known as 
the Screaming Eagles. 
He was one of the first American 
servicemembers on the ground in Nor-
mandy during D-day and was one of our 
longest-living World War II heroes. 
Dan was an exceptional marksman, 
which served him well as a sniper and 
a machine gunner. He endured un-
speakable challenges and overcame tre-
mendous adversity during his time at 
war. He fought German forces during 
record low subzero temperatures at the 
Battle of the Bulge. He took heavy fire, 
was wounded in action, and had limited 
access to food and resources behind 
enemy lines. 
His heroic actions did not go unno-
ticed. After honorably serving our 
country, Dan returned home with three 
Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star be-
cause of his courageous service. 
He was also featured in the book 
‘‘Three of the Last WWII Screaming 
Eagles’’ along with his fellow para-
troopers, Dick Klein and James Mar-
tin. That book has now been made into 
a documentary film called ‘‘A Ren-
dezvous 
with 
Destiny,’’ 
which 
premiered at the National Veterans 
Museum and Memorial in Columbus, 
Ohio. I can’t think of a better way to 
honor his legacy than by immor-
talizing his story on film. 
We owe an enormous debt of grati-
tude to our World War II veterans, of 
whom we are now one fewer. Dan will 
be missed dearly but will never be for-
gotten. 
It was abundantly clear to everyone 
who met him that he loved this coun-
try and enjoyed life with a passionate 
American spirit. 
Dan was laid to rest at the Fort Bay-
ard National Cemetery with full mili-
tary honors. He is survived by his three 
children: Danny McBride, Pat McBride; 
and John Carr. 
Thank you, Dan, for your bravery, 
for being a true representative of the 
Greatest Generation, and for making 
the world a safer place. 
We know that freedom isn’t free. 
Today, we enjoy the benefit of living in 
a Nation of freedom because of Dan’s 
sacrifice and the sacrifice of so many 
others. 
Dan, you possessed the courage of 
David; the patience of Job; and, like 
Paul, the willingness to stand for your 
convictions and for what you believed 
in. Everyone who had the privilege to 
meet you was immediately drawn to 
your stories, your strength, and your 
heart, so full of joy and pride. You have 
impacted more lives than you will ever 
know. And even in death, your legacy 
will live on. 
Dan, today, the United States House 
of Representatives thanks you for your 
service and a life well lived. I am con-
fident that on February 16, you were 
welcomed into God’s loving arms, and 
you heard him say: ‘‘Well done, my 
good and faithful servant.’’ 
Rest in peace, Sergeant Dan McBride, 
Jr.

REMEMBERING SARAH LOUISE 
HODGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GOMEZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in memory of a constituent of mine, 
Sarah Louise Hodge. 
She was a mother, a grandmother, an 
educator, a union rep, and also my 
mother-in-law. She died on the evening 
of January 20 in Los Angeles, with my 
wife at her side, as well as her care-
giver, Patricia. 
She was born in Macedonia, Ohio. 
She is the daughter of two teachers, 
and she was the youngest of three and 
the only girl, but she was raised as a 
tomboy through and through, and her 
brothers taught her not to take any 
crap from anyone. 
She became a teacher, a kindergarten 
teacher for over 40 years, 38 years at 
the same school. She was an educator 
through and through. She would make 
sure that each student had their own 
curriculum, their own box, and then 
made sure that any time that she 
found a new student that didn’t feel 
welcome, she would find a way to con-
nect with them. 
When I met her, she just had a stu-
dent that enrolled that was from Latin 
America. She thought he was Mexican, 
but I think he was Salvadoran, but 
close enough. She wanted me to go and 
get to know him, so we went to the 
Cleveland Zoo so she would feel more 
comfortable. I got to speak a little 
Spanish to that student. 
Like many teachers, she always went 
out of her way to give out of her own 
pocket to the students that didn’t have 
much, and that is one of the things 
that she did. 
She was an educator even with her 
own daughters. When they would go on 
summer family trips to Virginia and 
the different areas around here, she 
would play the Civil War songs that 
were being played on a tape, and then 
she would go to the different historical 
sites for the daughters to know about 
our history. 
She was an educator through and 
through, but she was also a tough advo-
cate for teachers. She was a union rep. 
Her daughters would often go and sit in 
the union meetings where they would 
plan out strikes, and they would par-
ticipate in everything that a union 
does. 
She was soft spoken. She was quiet, 
but I learned my lesson when I tried to 
debate her once at Thanksgiving where 
she didn’t let me get a word in edge-
wise. I knew at that moment that if I 
helped her run for office, she could 
have become a Member of Congress, no 
problem. She was fit for the position. 
She was very adventurous except 
when it came to food. Back in the 
1960s, she traveled around the globe on 
a cruise ship, and she went to India and 
different countries. This is different be-
cause she had a disorder where she 
couldn’t eat any spices, so tell me how 
do you go to India when you can’t eat 
spices? But that is what she did. She 
went around the globe because she 
wanted to travel, learn about different 
cultures, no matter if she couldn’t eat 
spices. She was a very interesting and 
tough woman. 
There are different people you meet 
throughout your life, you think there 
is coincidence in life. One of them for 
me is that she had an uncle whose 
name was Laurence Woodworth. Most 
Americans don’t know who he was, but 
he was the director of Congress’ Joint 
Committee on Taxation, which I find 
interesting because I am from Cali-
fornia, the son of immigrants, and I 
married her daughter, and I end up 
coming to Congress, and what com-
mittee am I on? I am on the Ways and 
Means Committee, which is the main 
taxation 
committee 
that 
interacts 
with the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
So you never know how lives from dif-
ferent parts of the country are going to 
intersect. 
She had a profound impact on my 
life, not only through her daughter, 
but also just kind of being a calming 
force when I ran for office the first 
time. She was one of my first max-out 
donors, even after she retired from 
teaching, and that is impressive be-
cause retiring on teacher’s pay and 
then being able to give a max contribu-
tion was a big, big deal, but she be-
lieved in me enough. 
She started losing some of her per-
sonality, it felt like, because of the 
stroke she had in 2014, but she got to 
come here to Congress when I got 
sworn in and got to meet Speaker 
PELOSI. 
Speaker 
PELOSI
gave 
her 
Ghirardelli’s chocolate, her favorite. 
My mother-in-law opened it, ate it, 
made a face, and gave it back to 
Speaker PELOSI, so she didn’t lose that 
spirit. 
She has been a force. I want to just 
say that she will be missed. She is sur-
vived by her two daughters—my wife, 
Mary Hodge; Felicia Hodge and her two 
kids, Stacey and Fedrick; her brother, 
Al Woodworth; as well as the extended 
family of the Eysters. 
Sally, you will be missed, and we love 
you very much. We will see you again 
soon.

South Carolina (Ms. MACE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
in 
remembrance 
of 
Buck 
Limehouse, a beloved member of the 
Charleston community, public servant 
to the State of South Carolina, and a 
fellow graduate of the Citadel, the 
military college of South Carolina. 
Buck served as a commissioner from 
the First Congressional District for the 
South Carolina Department of Trans-
portation and would later serve as 
South Carolina’s first Secretary of 
Transportation. He even started the 
State infrastructure bank, the first of 
any State in the Nation. His leadership 
was instrumental in the implementa-
tion of several transportation projects 
across the State of South Carolina. 
Buck was a pillar of the Charleston 
community, the consummate entre-
preneur. While he will be sorely missed, 
his legacy will live on in our State for 
decades to come. I offer my sincerest 
condolences to the Limehouse family. 
RECOGNIZING BEAUFORT FILM SOCIETY 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today because for over three decades 
Beaufort has served as the backdrop for 
major motion picture films, including 
Forrest Gump, The Big Chill, and of 
course Pat Conroy’s The Prince of 
Tides. 
Today I rise to recognize the extraor-
dinary contributions of Ron Tucker 
and his team at the Beaufort Film So-
ciety. 
This past month, the society recog-
nized aspiring filmmakers of every 
genre at the 16th Annual Beaufort 
International 
Film 
Festival, 
show-
casing Beaufort’s sweeping marsh vis-
tas and quiet charm to visitors from all 
over the world. 
Over 10,000 attendees from four con-
tinents, eight countries, and 32 States 
gathered at the University of South 
Carolina-Beaufort for this incredible 
exhibition of independent films and 
documentaries. 
After such a spectacular festival this 
year, I know the global film commu-
nity is looking forward to coming back 
to Beaufort next year. 
COASTAL CAROLINA EAGLE SCOUTS 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate 98 Coastal Caro-
lina Eagle Scouts, including their first 
female Eagle Scouts, which totaled six 
young women from our area to achieve 
this distinct honor. It was an honor to 
meet these women just a few weeks 
ago. 
Only about 6 percent of Scouts 
achieve the Eagle rank, and as the first 
woman to graduate from the Citadel, I 
can appreciate the special challenges 
inherent with being one of the first 
women anywhere. 
As a conservationist, I am also 
pleased to inform the House of Rep-
resentatives that over half of the 
projects completed by the Eagle Scouts 
in the Charleston area were conserva-
tion, 
climate, 
and 
environment-re-
lated. In reaching this goal, these 
Scouts completed over 21,000 hours of 
volunteer work in their communities. 
I commend their efforts, and I was 
glad to congratulate each of them in 
person just last month. 
CRISIS IN UKRAINE 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address the rising crisis in 
Ukraine. I want to recognize President 
Zelensky and the people of Ukraine for 
their valor, for putting it all on the 
line to defend their freedom, their 
country, their democracy. We have 
seen people from all walks of life, all 
ages defending their country and their 
homeland. 
As much as I dislike social media, I 
think it has really influenced how 
quickly we have responded to sanc-
tions, not only us but our allies. I com-
mend us and our allies, our friends and 
partners around the world for doing 
that, but more needs to be done. 
Upwards of 600,000 barrels of oil a day 
are imported into our country from 
Russia. Vladimir Putin funds his war 
machine, his wars and his invasions of 
Ukraine and elsewhere through the oil 
and gas economy, so every gallon that 
we fill in our cars today from Russian 
gas has the stain of blood from the 
Ukrainian people. I can’t think of one 
person in the State of South Carolina 
who wants to put one more gallon of 
gas in their car from Russia. 
I am encouraged to see the adminis-
tration today is looking more seriously 
and may announce a moratorium and 
ban on Russian imports of oil and gas, 
and we need to do that, but the admin-
istration should be concerned about 
getting jobs here going to Texas, going 
to South Dakota, North Dakota, Okla-
homa, American jobs, and not a job in 
Venezuela. Venezuela is aligned with 
Russia. They are an ally of Vladimir 
Putin. We shouldn’t be seeking jobs for 
Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to replace 
Russian oil when we have those jobs 
right here in our country or our neigh-
bors to the north in Canada, who are 
not aligned with Russia, who do not 
support Putin. Replacing one bloody 
regime with another is just wrong. 
We need to be able to keep costs 
down. We should not be dependent on 
kowtowing to global dictators. When I 
look at the rise of inflation, the cost of 
goods over the last year is up over 100 
percent, gasoline over 80 percent, cof-
fee over 70 percent. Every single crisis 
our Nation is facing today, whether it 
is Ukraine, whether it is Afghanistan, 
whether it is the border, is a direct re-
sult of President Joe Biden’s failed 
policies in his first year in office, and 
it has got to end today.

INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY

minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
last week I shared a series of historical 
facts for Virgin Islands History Month, 
which falls in the month of March. 
Today, in celebration of International 
Women’s Day, I proudly recognize the 
indomitable spirit of women from the 
Virgin Islands. 
This year, the theme of International 
Women’s Day is centered around the 
bold hashtag ‘‘Break the Bias.’’ For 
decades, women have worked to break 
the bias in communities, workplaces, 
schools, universities. We learn about 
different historical figures in history, 
but often we forget to give recognition 
to the lesser-known women whose sto-
ries and contributions help to propel 
the historical narrative. 
First on my list, I want to recognize 
the most influential and enigmatic 
writer 
of 
Harlem 
Renaissance, 
Nellallitea, or as she was more com-
monly known, Nella Larsen. With a fa-
ther from the Danish West Indies, what 
is now the Virgin Islands, while work-
ing as a nurse and librarian, she wrote 
two instant success novels, Quicksand 
in 1928, and Passing in 1929, which made 
its screen debut on Netflix in 2019. 
Nella was the first African-American 
woman 
to 
receive 
the 
prestigious 
Guggenheim fellowship award for cre-
ative writing. 
Also on my list is an individual who 
has a series of firsts for Virgin Island-
ers, Ruby Rouss. Ruby Rouss was a 
Crucian known for breaking the bias 
throughout her short life journey. She 
broke the mold for what was consid-
ered possible for women during her 
time and was the first of many things: 
She was the first female member of 
the drill team at Fort Dix in New Jer-
sey. 
She was the first Black woman to be 
permanently assigned to the staff of 
General Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
Parole officer, probation officer, leg-
islator, leader, Ruby Rouss was a 
woman who advocated for those most 
in need, spoke out against injustice, 
and was true to her belief that women 
belong in politics. 
My very own chief of staff, Angeline 
Muckle-Jabbar, comes from a long lin-
eage of powerful women from the Vir-
gin Islands. One such woman in her 
family was Ann Marie Shrader from St. 
Croix, who was at the forefront of piv-
otal changes that were taking place in 
the 1970s at the FBI National Academy. 
She was one of only two women to 
graduate from the academy in 1972. 
And, of course, bringing it forward, I 
would be remiss if I did not include the 
Virgin Islands’ very own Aliyah Boston 
who, through her excellence in the 
NCAA women’s basketball league, con-
tinues to break the bias. Aliyah posted 
a record-breaking 23 consecutive dou-
ble-doubles this season. Miss Boston’s 
team, the South Carolina Gamecocks, 
are currently the number one overall 
seed for the upcoming NCAA tour-
nament. 
All of these women faced deliberate 
or unconscious bias, and yet they pre-
vail. As a Black woman, I think about 
my own mother and all the mothers 
who, every day even when it wasn’t 
common to work, they sacrificed, occu-
pied spaces where they were under-
rated, underappreciated, marginalized.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1340 
March 8, 2022 
Women continue to face tremendous 
obstacles across a number of spheres. 
For example, managerial and leader-
ship positions continue to be male 
dominated, with women holding ap-
proximately 27 percent of managerial 
roles. In the business world, on aver-
age, women hold 19.7 percent of cor-
porate board seats. Of that number, 6.7 
percent are chairs, and only 5 percent 
are CEOs. 
The importance of representation for 
women in leadership, politics, law en-
forcement, and across every sphere is 
evident. In politics alone, evidence 
shows that more women in public deci-
sion-making and public policy produce 
policies that benefit women, children, 
and families in general. Loans given to 
women’s businesses exponentially sup-
port families and communities. We 
need women. 
On this International Women’s Day, I 
pay homage to the women who have 
come before me and the ones who stand 
beside me, and I send special prayers 
and strength on International Women’s 
Day to the women of Ukraine, those 
fighting on the front line, those bring-
ing support and comfort to children 
and elders and bringing them to safety, 
all of the women in Ukraine, especially 
today. 
Let us all continue the great work to 
break the bias and advance the cause of 
women’s rights in our communities, 
our government, and our world.

RECOGNIZING
WILLIAM
RISHEL
UPON
HIS
AP-
POINTMENT TO THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE 
ACADEMY 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and congratulate William Rishel of 
Philipsburg, Pennsylvania. 
William accepted a fully qualified ap-
pointment to the United States Air

Mountie Nation Service Organization. 
By the time he graduated high school, 
he had accumulated over 260 commu-
nity hours of service. 
As a first year at Penn State, Wil-
liam is an active member of the Air 
Force ROTC Detachment 720, and he 
also earned his private pilot license

I am confident William’s experience 
in and out of the classroom will serve 
him well as he looks forward to this ex-
citing new phase of life. I thank Wil-
liam for his commitment to our Nation

rado Springs. 
Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to 
nominate these young men. Their dedi-
cation to serving our country is inspi-
rational. I look forward to seeing their 
successes in the years to come. I thank 
all the appointees for their commit-
ment to our great Nation. 
f 
STANDING WITH UKRAINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
STANTON). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today and stand with our brothers and 
sisters who are fighting for democracy, 
Mr. Speaker, for their country, for the 
world, in Ukraine. 
As you may know, Mr. Speaker, New 
York City is a gorgeous mosaic of peo-
ple from all over the world. In my dis-
trict, the 13th Congressional District, I 
stand in solidarity with constituents 
that come from Ukraine, Ukrainian 
Americans and Ukrainians who are 
part of my district. 
New York City stands in solidarity 
with them. People in the Brighton 
Beach area of Brooklyn, called Little 
Odessa today, we stand in solidarity 
with our Ukrainian brothers and sis-
ters. 
Vladimir Putin has waged a war—it 
is called Putin’s war—of unprecedented 
proportions on the people of Ukraine, 
the likes of which we haven’t seen 
since World War II, Mr. Speaker. 
He continues to pound on civilian 
sites. As he waits to assault Kyiv, the 
world braces for what could be, really, 
an attack of unprecedented proportion 
as he prepares to slaughter the Ukrain-
ian people and engage in, clearly, war 
crimes. 
These unprovoked and unjustified at-
tacks have caused tragic losses in 
human life and suffering. They are 
grandparents. They are moms with 
their little children being forced out of 
their homes out of fear of rocket at-
tacks; fathers, uncles, cousins leaving 
their families behind to defend democ-
racy in Ukraine and on behalf of the 
world. 
This week, the Permanent Represent-
ative of Ukraine at the United Nations 
told the Security Council that hun-
dreds of Ukrainian civilians have been 
killed, including children, Mr. Speaker. 
Thousands of people are wounded as a 
result of Russia’s military aggression 
as Vladimir Putin continues to engage, 
to perpetrate war crimes. 
This is a war without remorse, Mr. 
Speaker. More than 1,000 civilians have 
died, and more than 1.5 million Ukrain-
ians have been displaced, causing a hu-
manitarian crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Putin, Vladimir 
Putin, has engaged in war crimes. This 
isn’t just Putin’s war on Ukraine. It is 
a rebuke of Western values. It is a re-
buke of democratic structures. It is a 
rebuke of the will of the people and 
basic human rights. It is a rebuke of 
law and order and peaceful coexisting. 
He has doubled down, Mr. Speaker, 
and has premeditatedly, illegally, and 
immorally engaged in this war. But 
those on the front lines in Ukraine are 
relentless in their defense of democ-
racy. 
It is our duty, Mr. Speaker, to sup-
port Ukraine to the best of our ability, 
to defend its freedom and sovereignty 
from Putin’s war. 
President 
Zelensky’s 
message 
is 
clear. He will defend Ukrainian sov-
ereignty and statehood to the very end,

and America must, we must, stand 
with him and every Ukrainian. 
I commend President Biden’s rallying 
calls to our allies in response to Rus-
sia’s military invasion of Ukraine, and 
urge continued support for the Ukrain-
ian people as they violently resist tyr-
anny in the name of freedom and de-
mocracy. 
Putin’s actions are barbaric. They 
are a disregard of human rights, vio-
lating Ukrainian sovereignty and pos-
ing a threat to all of us across the 
planet. 
His actions are hurting the people of 
Russia as well. Dozens of cities across 
Russia saw people being arrested as 
they demonstrated against this illegal 
war. 
It is heartbreaking that during Wom-
en’s History Month, on International 
Women’s Day, we are witnessing thou-
sands of Ukrainian women fleeing their 
homeland with their children to bor-
dering countries. 
The United States and our allies 
must do everything in our power to 
prevent this from happening again. 
Mr. Speaker, I have introduced a res-
olution calling on Vladimir Putin and 
the Russians to be held accountable for 
war crimes. 
f 
SPIKING GAS PRICES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, we all stand 
united with our allies across Europe 
and with the people of Ukraine against 
Vladimir Putin’s aggression against 
this democratically elected country. 
We also support actions to stop the 
purchasing of Russian oil. But without 
action to increase production here do-
mestically, the American people will 
suffer. 
It was only 2 years ago when, for the 
first time since the mid-1950s, under 
President Donald Trump’s leadership, 
the United States was a net total en-
ergy exporter in 2019 and 2020. 
This was made possible because of 
the Trump administration’s commit-
ment to increasing domestic produc-
tion of oil and natural gas, which drove 
costs down and benefited American 
consumers. 
But, sadly, look at where we are now. 
In just 13 months of President Biden’s 
liberal energy policies, we are now fac-
ing skyrocketing gas prices. Even be-
fore the crisis in Russia unfolded, gas 
prices had increased 40 percent, mark-
ing an 8-year high. 
Now, because of President Biden’s 
Green New Deal attitude and reversal 
of Trump-era policies, we are once 
again reliant on countries overseas, 
and energy costs are soaring. 
In my district, across the Roanoke 
Valley, the cost of a gallon of gas has 
increased nearly 72 cents in the past 
month alone. This increase, in and of 
itself, will cost the average driver $363 
a year for those who fill up three times 
a month. That might not seem like a 
lot to Washington elites, but it sure is 
for folks in rural areas like mine. 
I urge President Biden to pursue an 
American agenda to help get this coun-
try back to energy independence. If all 
Joe Biden does is ban Russian oil im-
ports without increasing production 
domestically, 
we 
know 
where 
the 
blame lies for spiking gas prices: 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
CONGRATULATING THE STRASBURG HIGH SCHOOL 
WRESTLING TEAM 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Strasburg High School 
wrestling team for winning this year’s 
VHSL Class 2 State championship. 
This victory marks the program’s 
fifth overall State title and the first in 
22 years. 
The Rams dominated the competi-
tion, ending the tournament with a 
total score of 218 points. This was truly 
impressive, considering the runner-up, 
the 
four-time 
defending 
champion, 
Poquoson High School, scored only 
150.5 points, meaning the margin of vic-
tory was nearly 70 points. 
This win was a total team effort, 
with all 11 Rams wrestlers who quali-
fied for the tournament placing in the 
top four of their weight class. As Coach 
Daniel Reynolds noted: 
It is an incredible feat that we were able to 
bring 11 and place 11, bring six to the finals. 
To have three champions of six finalists is 
great. 
The three Strasburg athletes that 
took home individual titles were soph-
omores Heath and David Burks and 
junior Chuck Fake. 
Further, with only one graduating 
senior in the starting lineup this year, 
the prospects for another great season 
are high. 
Congratulations again to the Stras-
burg High School wrestling team. They 
deserve it. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF NICK HELMER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Nick Helmer, the late, beloved mayor 
of Prospect Heights, and someone with 
whom I was proud to have a friendship. 
Mayor Helmer was a dedicated public 
servant, serving as mayor since 2011. 
His 
tenure 
transformed 
Prospect 
Heights. He led the city out of a lin-
gering recession into what he lovingly 
called Prosperous Heights. 
Throughout his 79 years of life, 
Mayor 
Helmer 
shaped 
Prospect 
Heights, building a home with his wife, 
Gail Ann Helmer, and raising their two 
children, son Nick Helmer, Jr., and 
daughter Rebecca. 
Through his work, he literally built 
both Prospect Heights and Chicago 
with a career and a passion for real es-
tate. He was recognized as Chicago’s 
Certified Property Manager of the 
Year. 
One of my favorite memories was 
joining Mayor Helmer for the Fourth of 
July parade in the parade marshal car. 
Over the course of the parade route, I 
got to see firsthand his passion for his 
community, his love of his constitu-
ents, and the mutual love they shared 
for him. 
Mayor Helmer leaves a huge hole in 
Prospect Heights and a hole in all of 
our hearts. He will be sorely missed. 
May his memory be a blessing.

IN SUPPORT OF UKRAINE 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to affirm Congress’ resolute support for 
Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in 
their defense of the unprovoked, unlaw-
ful Russian invasion. 
The world will hold Vladimir Putin 
accountable for his invasion and the 
actions of his armed forces. He is solely 
responsible for this war, its devasta-
tion, the senseless deaths of thousands 
of Ukrainian forces and civilians, and 
the forced migration of millions more. 
Putin’s war is an affront to every na-
tion and to all people that respect 
international law and self-determina-
tion. 
I commend the administration’s swift 
and strong response to unite NATO and 
other allies against the Russian aggres-
sion and for heeding Congress’ call to 
ban imports of Russian oil. 
In Congress, our bipartisan support 
for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people 
and for isolating and sanctioning Putin 
and his regime is rock solid. The 
United States, together with our allies, 
must do all we can to compel Putin to 
end this unwarranted, illegal war. We 
must do all we can to help the Ukrain-
ian people in their struggle and their 
fight for their independence and their 
freedom. Putin must know that Ameri-
cans and people of conscience around 
the world stand with the people of 
Ukraine; and that we will stand strong 
until Ukraine is again free. 
f 
HONORING AND REMEMBERING 
BETTY GRIFFO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, on Inter-
national Women’s Day it is fitting that 
I rise today to honor and remember 
Mrs. Betty Griffo of Rome, New York, 
who served our community with dis-
tinction. 
Mrs. Griffo passed away this January 
at the age of 94 surrounded by her lov-
ing family. 
Betty was a hardworking seamstress 
for 15 years and a woman of great faith, 
having been a long-time member of the 
Church of Saint John the Baptist, 
where she impacted so many lives 
through her intentions and rosaries. 
Betty’s personal struggle to fight and 
defeat cancer is a stirring example of 
her courage and tenacity. Betty’s com-
passion for others is revealed by her 
commitment to help so many others 
through her involvement in the Relay 
for Life organization.

Betty’s legacy of community service 
has been passed down to her son and 
my longtime colleague and friend, New 
York State Senator Joseph Griffo. 
Betty instilled her wisdom, tenacity, 
and compassion in Joe, who employs 
those key qualities each day that he 
serves us in government. 
We are so grateful to Betty, her late 
husband Joe, and their son, Senator 
Joe Griffo, for their kindness and gen-
erous service to our community. 
My deepest condolences to the Griffo 
family on the loss of Betty Griffo, a 
beautiful mother, aunt, sister, and 
deeply devoted community volunteer. 
RECOGNIZING LOGAN HENYAN 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Logan Henyan, the 
Congressional App Challenge winner 
for New York’s 22nd Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Logan is not your typical App Chal-
lenge participant. I say that, not be-
cause he isn’t well versed in coding, he 
certainly is. I say that because Logan 
is only an eighth grader at Chenango 
Valley Middle School. 
Logan’s ‘‘Study Buddy’’ app is a stu-
dent-to-student application. It provides 
students with much-needed assistance, 
and it does so while building lasting 
friendships. 
New York’s 22nd District has a rich 
history in the technology sector. It is 
the birthplace of industry giants like 
IBM and Singer-Link. The tradition 
continues now at the Air Force Re-
search Laboratory in Rome, New York, 
the Marcy Nanocenter, and perhaps 
most importantly, in the minds of the 
next 
generation 
of 
inventors 
and 
innovators like Logan. 
And so I ask my colleagues to please 
join 
me 
in 
congratulating 
Logan 
Henyan and all the competitors in this 
year’s Congressional App Challenge. 
Thanks to these young people, our fu-
ture is a bright one. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL TRIO DAY 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize National TRIO Day, 
which recently took place on February 
26. 
National TRIO Day recognizes the 
vital support and assistance that stu-
dents 
around 
the 
country 
receive 
through federally funded TRIO pro-
grams. TRIO identifies students from 
disadvantaged backgrounds and pro-
vides them with the skills, training, 
and support to excel academically and 
personally. 
This National TRIO Day, my team 
attended a TRIO Day celebration at 
the newly named Utica University, a 
great institution in the heart of my 
district. Students who benefited from 
TRIO-funded programs shared their ex-
periences alongside faculty mentors 
and community members. 
We are honored that in our commu-
nity, Utica University operates a Stu-
dent Support Services program that 
guides 140 low-income and first-genera-
tion students through their academic 
development. The program ensures stu-
dents meet basic college requirements 
and successfully complete their post- 
secondary education. All of this is 
made possible by TRIO grants. 
It is a privilege to see firsthand the 
positive impacts of the TRIO program 
in our community. Thank you to Utica 
University 
President 
Laura 
Casamento, a friend, for her vision and 
leadership. 
I strongly support TRIO’s mission, 
and I applaud my colleagues in this 
Chamber for their continued bipartisan 
support of this proven program.

RECOGNIZING AMBASSADOR HAR-
OLD E. DOLEY, JR. ON HIS 75TH 
BIRTHDAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Am-
bassador Harold E. Doley, Jr. on his 
75th birthday. 
Ambassador Harold E. Doley, Jr., a 
native of New Orleans, Louisiana, rang 
the closing bell of the New York Stock 
Exchange on February 18, 2022, mark-
ing his 50th anniversary of becoming a 
member. 
Ambassador Doley began his career 
in investment banking in 1968. Five 
years later, at the tender age of 26, he 
bought a seat on the stock exchange, 
becoming the first and only African 
American in history to do so. 
Ambassador Doley chaired the in-
vestment committee of Southern Afri-
ca 
Enterprise 
Development 
Fund, 
SAEDF, a private equity fund. Ambas-
sador Doley also placed the first Black 
market maker on the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange. 
Industry peers honored Ambassador 
Doley as an Outstanding Broker of the 
Year in 1971, and The Wall Street Jour-
nal selected him as Stock Picker of the 
Year in 1990. 
Ambassador Doley has been an ap-
pointee of five Presidential administra-
tions. 
In 1982, Ambassador Doley was ap-
pointed the founding director of the 
Minerals Management Service in the 
Department of the Interior, a depart-
ment of more than 5,000 employees. 
MMS represented the second-largest 
revenue source to United States Gov-
ernment at that time. 
In 1983, Ambassador Doley was ap-
pointed the United States Representa-
tive of the African Development Bank 
Fund, AfDB, headquartered in Abidjan, 
Ivory Coast. 
The AfDB was able to quadruple its 
authorized capital by using Ambas-
sador Doley’s capital increase formula. 
At the AfDB, Ambassador Doley se-
cured a AAA rating from the global fi-
nancial rating agencies, the first AAA 
rating for an African-based entity. 
Ambassador Doley was inducted into 
the United States Small Business Ad-
ministration Hall of Fame in 2005 and 
is a life member of the Council on For-
eign Relations. 
In 2003, the Doley family funded the 
Doley Foundation, whose mission is to 
support education and cultural endeav-
ors that impact the African diaspora. 
The foundation and its work is an 
outgrowth of a 1977 study the ambas-
sador commissioned and directed in de-
termining 
the 
reliability 
of 
using 
apartheid South Africa as a dependable 
source for the strategic and ubiquitous 
metal, platinum. The study can be 
found at the U.S. Library of Congress 
today. 
In 2018, Ambassador Doley received 
the Imagine Award for Special Rec-
ognition in Social Justice in Cape 
Town for this watershed document. 
The Doley Foundation replaced the 
Southern University Law Library in 
New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina 
and funded an NFL study that called 
on the league to engage with its fran-
chise owners’ contracts with minority 
businesses. 
A graduate of my alma mater, Xavier 
University, and the President Manage-
ment program and Harvard Business 
School, Ambassador Doley was re-
cently selected as one of 50 Wall Street 
practitioners 
interviewed 
for

IN SUPPORT OF AMERICANS NEG-
ATIVELY AFFECTED BY INFLA-
TION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise 
in support of every American being 
negatively affected by inflation caused 
by President Biden and congressional 
Democrats’ reckless spending policies 
over the last year. 
Inflation isn’t something that hap-
pens overnight. It occurs as a direct re-
sult of the bills passed right here in 
this body and the President’s executive 
actions. Since President Biden stepped 
foot in the Oval Office and Democrats 
gained control of both branches of Con-
gress, their actions have directly re-
sulted in the highest inflation levels in 
40 years, since the year I was a junior 
in high school. 
I recall when President Biden and 
congressional Democrats’ first legisla-
tive priority was a $1.9 trillion bill dis-
guised as COVID relief, but in reality, 
only 9 percent of funds went directly to 
combating the COVID–19 pandemic. In-
stead, it was a Progressive wish list of 
socialist ideas designed to transform 
American society from one of cap-
italism to socialism. Even the White 
House called it the most progressive 
piece of legislation in the history of 
the United States. 
After that, Democrats wasted the en-
tire legislative year using the budget 
reconciliation process to bypass the 
Senate filibuster and to pass their so- 
called infrastructure bill which was, in

March 8, 2022 
reality, another piece of legislation 
costing more than $1 trillion, that 
builds more debt than it builds bridges 
or roads. 
When the bill passed the House, infla-
tion was already on the rise, and gas 
prices had increased 50 percent over the 
prior year. Instead of addressing these 
issues before they got out of hand, 
Democrats have used their political 
capital in an attempt to reshape the 
very fabric of our society and take an-
other giant leap toward the United 
States 
becoming 
another 
socialist 
country. As a consequence, the cost of 
everything has continued to rise while 
inflation rages on with reckless aban-
don and no end in sight. 
Unfortunately, the madness did not 
end there. Despite already passing two 
bills with price tags over a trillion dol-
lars, President Biden and congressional 
Democrats saved the worst of all for 
last—their build back broke bill that 
was thankfully defeated in the Senate 
but would have added a staggering $5 
trillion in new spending. 
In just 1 year, House Democrats 
passed legislation equating to almost 
$10 
trillion 
which, 
unbelievably, 
amounts to a full one-third of the cur-
rent U.S. national debt. They acted 
like kids in a candy store with their 
parents’ credit card. But in reality, 
their actions are even worse than that 
because in this case they are actually 
using 
their 
children’s 
and 
grand-
children’s 
and 
great-grandchildren’s 
credit card, and even though they have 
more than maxed out the credit card, 
new purchases are never declined. 
Economists warned of an impending 
recession as we got closer to reaching 
the debt limit last year. America’s fis-
cal house was flooding, and the Demo-
crats chose to raise the roof rather 
than stop the flooding. On a party-line 
vote, Democrats voted to impose the 
largest nominal increase in the debt 
cap in the history of our country, and 
in doing so, once again denied all re-
ality that their out-of-control spending 
would directly result in inflation, the 
steep and cruel tax levied on all Ameri-
cans. 
You would think that after passing 
so many spending bills in the trillions 
of dollars that they would be able to 
pass a standard government funding 
bill, but you would be wrong. Congres-
sional Democrats and President Biden 
have not achieved this once; in fact, we 
are already almost halfway through 
the current fiscal year and, in an ironic 
twist, are still operating under the 
spending priorities of President Donald 
Trump; that is, until the House votes 
on the Democratic appropriations bills 
tomorrow, which we have yet to read 
and will likely cost taxpayers addi-
tional trillions of dollars. 
Trillions of dollars spent, and what 
do we have to show for it? Higher 
prices on everything, real wages for all 
Americans declining, and an economy 
dependent 
on 
government 
expendi-
tures. We are getting exactly what 
President 
Biden 
and 
congressional 
Democrats want: Socialism. These are 
not the ideals on which America was 
founded. Every step they take dimin-
ishes capitalism, the engine of our 
economy and the engine of our stand-
ard of living, and it also diminishes 
freedom, the engine of our national 
soul. But regrettably, that is President 
Biden’s America. 
The fact of the matter is that Presi-
dent Biden’s administration will stop 
at nothing to satisfy their far-left base.

SELLING AMERICA A BILL OF 
GOODS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the ability to address a few of my col-
leagues here on the floor of the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I would note, though, 
here we are again, we are sitting here 
at the precipice of the government 
funding running out. And I hear all my 
colleagues talking about how great it 
is: We are going to come up with some 
great, big omnibus bill. And I am hear-
ing that from my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle. 
Nobody in America wants us to plus- 
up more spending irresponsibly. 
Nobody in America wants us to say, 
Oh, let’s pat ourselves on the back 
now. Because some of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle are saying, 
Well, you know what? It is time now to 
ban Russian oil. 
It is not good enough to ban Russian 
oil if we are not going to open up 
American oil and gas. All we are going 
to do is provide more money to Ven-
ezuela, more money to Saudi, more 
money to Iran. But yet, that is being 
touted as a victory. 
And some of my colleagues on this 
side of the aisle are saying, Okay, good. 
Oh, this is great. But my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle, they don’t 
want any oil. They don’t mind your gas 
being $4, $7, $10 a gallon. 
Don’t get played. But my colleagues 
on this side of the aisle are about to 
get played, and everybody back home 
is saying: What are you going to do to 
stop vaccine mandates? Nothing. What 
are you going to do to secure the bor-
der? 
And my colleagues on this side of the 
aisle are going to say, Oh, don’t worry. 
We are going to give you more money 
for ICE, more money for Border Patrol. 
But you know what that does? It 
makes it worse, because you are fund-
ing the processing of people at our bor-
der, because that is all Border Patrol 
and ICE are doing. 
But my colleagues on this side of the 
aisle are going to say, Oh, look at us. 
We did something for border security. 
It ain’t true. It is going to make it 
worse. And anybody who has been to 
the border, anybody who talks to Bor-
der Patrol, anybody who talks to ICE, 
knows that is true. 
We are not going to get a vaccine 
mandate, we are not going to get a se-
cure border, and we are not going to 
get more oil and gas being produced in 
America. 
And then we are going to say, Great, 
let’s have a vote and send more lethal 
aid to Ukraine. And we are not even 
going to have a debate down here about 
what we are doing in funding Ukraine, 
with Putin rolling over Ukraine? All 
we are doing is backroom dealmaking, 
waiting for somebody to drop a bill on 
the floor of the House, and then come 
down and vote ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no.’’ 
That is a disgusting display by both 
sides of this body. We ought to have a 
full and open debate on the floor of the 
House about what we are doing in send-
ing arms to Ukraine; how much we are 
spending; what it means for our in-
volvement; what it means for NATO; 
what it means for stopping Putin. 
And stop spending money we don’t 
have. Stop funding tyranny. Stop forc-
ing Americans to get a jab or lose their 
job. Stop leaving the border wide open. 
And stop selling the American people a 
bill of goods. And I am looking directly 
at my party when I say that.

PUTIN’S WAR ATROCITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARTER of Louisiana). The Chair recog-
nizes the gentleman from South Caro-
lina (Mr. WILSON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the murderous Putin’s war on 
Ukraine is recognized worldwide as 
criminal. 
I am grateful that America and our 
NATO allies have unified to support 
Ukrainian 
President 
Volodymyr 
Zelensky and the Ukrainian people. I 
have faith in the Russian people, who I 
have met on numerous visits across 
Russia, that they will reject Putin’s 
war atrocities. 
Russia is a nation of world-signifi-
cant 
art, 
music, 
architecture, 
lit-
erature, and can change. And that is 
why I am introducing a bill to encour-
age Russian military defectors, true 
Russian patriots, with immediate ref-
ugee status in America with up to 
$100,000 for Russian military equipment 
transferred to Ukraine. Putin betrays 
the troops to death for his purpose of 
oil, money, power. 
Additionally, I will introduce a bill 
for a bust of President Volodymyr 
Zelensky to be placed in the U.S. Cap-
itol, as is the bust of Prime Minister 
Winston Churchill. Churchill was the 
wartime leader of World War II, and 
Volodymyr Zelensky is the wartime 
leader in Putin’s war. 
On Saturday, I was very grateful to 
be part of the Zoom address by Presi-
dent Zelensky to the U.S. Congress. 
And today, he is addressing the British 
Parliament. 
In December, I visited Kyiv, and I 
was so inspired by the people of 
Ukraine. It is a modern, free-market 
democracy with extraordinary success 
for its citizens of eight-lane boulevards 
with modern SUVs.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord, our God, will now be the time 
when You reveal Your favor? Answer 
those who cry to You, O compassionate 
Lord, for Your blessing this day. 
Is today the day of salvation? Help 
those, Almighty God, who find them-
selves in unspeakable danger and des-
perately in need of Your saving grace 
at this very moment. 
Will You allow release for the pris-
oners of tyranny? 
Will You shine light on those who 
have been enveloped in the darkness of 
destruction? 
Have pity on those who suddenly find 
themselves physically and spiritually 
hungry and thirsty. 
Have pity on them and lead them by 
springs of living water. Refresh them 
again with hope found only in You. Do 
not let them be struck down, they who 
endure the scorching wind of war and 
the heat of battle. 
Turn impassable mountains into an 
open road and raise up Your highways 
above any obstruction of passage. May 
those who seek refuge find shelter in 
You and those who suffer brought safe-
ly toward Your haven of compassion. 
We call upon Your strong and sov-
ereign name. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF PRE-
SIDING 
ELDER 
ALONZO 
MID-
DLETON 
(Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to a dear 
friend and mentor who was a man of 
great faith. Elder Alonzo Middleton 
passed away on March 1, 2022, at the 
age of 91. 
Elder Middleton used his longevity in 
great service to the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church. He was a proud life-
time member of my home congrega-
tion, Morris Brown AME Church, in 
Charleston, South Carolina, and was a 
graduate of Allen University, where he 
later served on the board of trustees. 
Elder Middleton was a pastor and 
presiding elder in the Seventh Epis-
copal District, which encompasses the 
entire State of South Carolina. He 
served 
as 
a 
delegate 
to 
multiple 
quadrennials of the AME Church’s gen-
eral conference and on its general 
board. 
He retired from active service as pre-
siding elder of the Mount Pleasant Dis-
trict, one of the largest in the AME 
Church. 
One of his lasting accomplishments 
was engineering the merger of three 
small Charleston congregations to cre-
ate a single church renamed the Great-
er Middleton Chapel AME Church. 
Elder Middleton was a mentor for 
many generations of AME clergy and 
laymen. He will be sorely missed. 
f 
THIRTEEN KILLED IN KABUL 
(Mrs. BOEBERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today having received a message from 
the mother of a young American hero, 
Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, who 
tragically and unnecessarily lost his 
life during the Biden administration’s 
catastrophic withdrawal from Afghani-
stan. 
She encouraged me to publicly share 
her message, which in part read: 
Mrs. Boebert, I am the mother of Lance 
Corporal Kareem Nikoui, one of the 13 killed 
in Kabul. I wish more people had the back-
bone that you have. When I heard you say, 
‘‘13 of them,’’ my heart dropped, my eyes 
filled with tears, and I was so happy to hear 
about our 13 kids at that very moment. You 
have no idea how much that meant to me. 
We have been lied to over and over, and 
then we watch this administration act as if 
it never happened. The pain of losing my son 
is unbearable. 
Just know when I heard you say, ‘‘13 of 
them,’’ it gave me hope to help us get some 
type of justice about what this corrupt ad-
ministration has done and is still doing. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to say it 
was impossible to ignore our 13 service-
members, and they will continue to be 
honored and remembered, despite their 
Commander in Chief intending to ig-
nore them. 
f 
HONORING ‘‘HARMONICA PETE’’ 
DUPRE 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to recognize the extraordinary life 
of Rochester’s own Pete DuPre, fondly 
known as Harmonica Pete, who died 
peacefully at the venerable age of 98 
earlier this year. 
Harmonica Pete served our Nation as 
a combat medic during World War II. 
When he returned home, he began vol-
unteering with the Greatest Genera-
tion Foundation, playing the har-
monica for veterans groups. 
His heartfelt rendition of ‘‘The Star- 
Spangled Banner’’ onboard the USS Ar-
izona and his performance before the 
U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team in 
2019 turned Harmonica Pete into a 
worldwide viral sensation. 
He chose to heal our Nation’s vet-
erans through music and brought joy 
to all who knew him. 
Pete once said, ‘‘History books fade, 
and so do we,’’ but his memory will 
never fade from our hearts and minds. 
May you rest in peace, Harmonica 
Pete.

FOCUSING ON ENERGY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, it is 
time to focus on our energy crisis and 
our energy costs, but that also relates 
to food. 
In our country, we are already seeing 
bare shelves of food items. You might 
recall years ago when Boris Yeltsin vis-
ited this country. They took him to a 
supermarket, and he was amazed by 
what was on American shelves. Now, 
we are moving in the direction of hav-
ing shelves like in Russia. 
In my home State of California, as 
they cut off the water supply, the 
Klamath Basin got zero water last year 
to farm crops, and in the San Joaquin 
Valley and part of the Sacramento Val-
ley, zero water allocations. 
As we look at conditions around the 
world, Russia is deciding to cut off 
some of the imports of fertilizer, which 
will make it harder to plant crops. 
Hungary has decided they are not 
going to export grain anymore this 
coming year. This is going to have a 
ripple effect through all food supplies 
and certainly on prices. The price of 
wheat is way up, maybe 100 percent— 
wheat futures. We are going to feel this 
at the stores if we are not planting our 
own food in this country. 
We have the water to do it in Cali-
fornia, but it is all going out in the 
ocean in order to support fish that no 
longer live there. And the salinity 
issue is misused. 
We have to focus once again. 
f 
CALLING FOR U.S. ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, this week, the House will con-
sider a bill to provide both humani-
tarian and military aid to the people of 
Ukraine. 
We must fortify President Zelensky 
and the Ukrainian people from an 
unprovoked attack on an independent 
country. We must also protect our-
selves. 
Putin has weaponized oil and natural 
gas export profits, profits that he stole 
from the Russian people, parking oil 
profits 
throughout 
the 
world 
in 
oligarchs. 
Right now, the United States imports 
22 million barrels of Russian oil every 
single month. This is 60 percent of the 
money that Putin used to leverage his 
invasion, and it must stop. 
Our country needs long-term energy 
independence. 
There are 211 lithium-ion battery 
plants in the world. Mr. Speaker, 156 
are in China, and just 12 are here in the 
United States. We need to get tough on 
China, but we need to get tougher on 
ourselves about China. 
Everyone will benefit from an Amer-
ica that is producing electric vehicles 
and one that is truly energy inde-
pendent. It is time to get serious about 
this. American jobs and national secu-
rity are on the line. 
f 
FAMILY FARMS ARE SUFFERING 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to address the critical 
issues facing my fellow farmers. 
The world is on fire under President 
Biden and his America last agenda. We 
are seeing skyrocketing costs of crit-
ical inputs, such as fertilizer. Nitrogen 
fertilizer has doubled in price. 
Our fuel prices have reached record 
highs, and President Biden’s solution is 
to beg our enemies in Iran and Ven-
ezuela for more oil. 
The supply chain crisis was never ad-
dressed, and farmers are struggling to 
find parts to repair equipment. Family 
farms are suffering, and every Amer-
ican is about to see a drastic increase 
in the price of food. 
I am afraid for regular Americans. 
This yearlong experiment of woke gov-
ernment has been a disaster. 
My constituents in the 15th District 
miss President Trump and an agenda 
that put America first. 
f 
NAVIGATING THE IRS 
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, as the 
2022 tax filing season gets underway, I 
rise to draw attention to the issues 
that my constituents face when trying 
to navigate the IRS. 
James from Nottingham came to my 
office because his 2020 return was de-
layed for almost a year. Lisa from Ber-
wyn called us after she learned that a 
clerical error at the IRS had led the 
Social 
Security 
Administration 
to 
claim that she owed them a significant 
amount of money. And Tina from Mal-
vern worked with my team to secure a 
full refund. 
Stories like these are far too com-
mon. As recently as the end of last 
year, the agency had a backlog of over 
8 million new and amended individual 
returns. 
That is why I was proud to join with 
over 190 of our House colleagues in 
sending a letter to Treasury Secretary 
Yellen, urging her to provide taxpayers 
with relief and flexibility while the 
IRS addresses its backlog. These back-
logs lead to delays and errors that are 
devastating to the families and busi-
nesses at the heart of my community 
and many others. It is imperative that 
this relief and flexibility be provided. 
HELPING STARBUCKS EMPLOYEES 
THRIVE 
(Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I am 
here to talk about a company you 
might have heard about: Starbucks. 
They made the $8 cup of coffee a little 
popular. 
The workers there through the pan-
demic are now struggling to form a 
union. Well, Kevin Johnson, the CEO, 
got a 39 percent raise. Not bad. The 
workers took a cut. 
Those profits didn’t magically ap-
pear. Starbucks didn’t pour their own 
coffee. It was the men and women who 
went out during the pandemic and 
went to work. Yet, Kevin Johnson gets 
a $20 million bonus. 
If Kevin is listening, he should do the 
right thing. 
We hear the ethical sourcing that 
Starbucks talks about helping people 
thrive. Well, he needs to do it right 
here in America and treat his employ-
ees right. 
Mr. Speaker, Kevin should do the 
right thing and take care of his em-
ployees.

b 1215 
OIL COMPANIES SHOULD NOT 
PRICE GOUGE 
(Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
DEFAZIO. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
President just announced that he will 
ban the importation of Russian oil. It 
is a tiny fraction of the oil we con-
sume, so it shouldn’t mean a big run-up 
in price. In fact, prices have already 
run up 30 percent since the invasion of 
Ukraine, they have already priced it in, 
and they are already profiting from it. 
We need to become energy inde-
pendent, as the President pointed out. 
We have to break our addiction to Big 
Oil. We need to be self-sufficient on re-
newables, but we don’t need to price 
gouge the American people on the way 
there. 
Last year, the oil companies reported 
record profits, bought back $7 billion 
worth of stock, and had record divi-
dends. This year, they say there is a $22 
billion stock buyback, bigger divi-
dends, bigger profits. They should not 
be price gouging during a crisis. 
I am introducing legislation for a 
price gouging profits tax with rebates 
to consumers. 
Colleagues, join me in this effort. 
Don’t let Big Oil gouge the American 
consumers under the guise of an inter-
national crisis.

BUILDING A BETTER AMERICA

mission to address the House for 1

people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1346 
March 8, 2022 
This week is the anniversary of the 
American Rescue Plan that Democrats 
passed in the House and the Senate, 
and that President Biden signed into 
law. That law was transformative. It 
helped schools reopen and remain open. 
It also increased vaccine distribution 
across America. It got people into jobs, 
and it funded police departments. 
We then followed the American Res-
cue Plan with an infrastructure law 
that is going to rebuild roads, bridges, 
and highways; it is going to take lead 
out of our water pipes; it is going to 
have 
EV 
charging 
stations 
across 
America; and it is going to make sure 
that we have broadband everywhere. 
What are Republicans doing? I am 
not really sure. But I know that two of 
them recently attended a white nation-
alist conference, and last week 174 of 
them voted ‘‘no’’ to providing benefits 
to veterans who inhaled toxic fumes. 
f 
SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE 
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in awe of the courageous Ukrain-
ian people defending their sovereign 
land, and in fierce condemnation of the 
sickening violence the Kremlin is in-
flicting upon them. 
Our children are watching an attack 
on democracy and a grave violation of 
international law and global peace un-
fold, and we must continue to show 
them it will not be tolerated. 
For over 3 years, the Kremlin has 
tried to intimidate America with the 
wrongful detention of my constituent, 
Paul Whelan. While we remain pro-
foundly concerned about our citizens 
wrongfully detained in Russia, includ-
ing Trevor Reed and now, Brittney 
Griner, we will never give up on our 
mission to bring them home and make 
President Putin pay. 
Financially, 
economically, 
mili-
tarily, and strategically, the United 
States is battling for the Ukrainian 
people. 
It is time to ban Russian oil. We pre-
pared for this moment in close coordi-
nation with our allies, and the Kremlin 
will be held accountable. 
Our country is united in praying for 
the 
safety 
and 
well-being 
of 
the 
Ukrainian people on the front lines, for 
nearly 2 million seeking refuge in 
neighboring countries, and for those 
who dwell within our own borders 
doing everything they can to support 
their family and friends back home. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in de-
manding Russia end its invasion of 
Ukraine, withdraw its military forces 
at once, and release political prisoners. 
f 
RECOGNIZING BLAINE HAWKINS 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize a young man 
from my district for shining the na-
tional spotlight on Central College by 
shattering one of the most impressive 
NCAA records. 
Last season, Central College senior 
quarterback Blaine Hawkins set the 
new NCAA season record for the most 
touchdown passes with a total of 63 
touchdowns over 13 games, leading the 
Dutch to an impressive 12–1 season 
record. 
Blaine has garnered national atten-
tion for setting the Division III career 
touchdown record, and he has won sev-
eral awards, including Player of the 
Year, Conference Offensive MVP for 
both the 2019 and 2021 season, and has 
been named an Academic All-American 
for the 2018, 2020, and 2021 season. 
Congratulations to Blaine and the 
Central College Dutch for a fantastic 
season. I wish you all the best.

CONDEMNING 
THREATS 
OF 
VIO-
LENCE AGAINST HISTORICALLY 
BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVER-
SITIES 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I move to suspend the rules and agree 
to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. 
Res. 70) condemning threats of violence 
against historically Black colleges and 
universities (″HBCUs’’) and reaffirming 
support for HBCUs and their students, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the con-
current resolution. 
The text of the concurrent resolution 
is as follows: 
H. CON. RES. 70 
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion is investigating the bomb threats made 
in January and February 2022 against HBCUs 
as racially or ethnically motivated violent 
extremism and hate crimes; 
Whereas a high-quality education is cen-
tral to economic prosperity and social well- 
being in the United States; 
Whereas HBCUs provide educational and 
economic opportunities for postsecondary 
students; 
Whereas these institutions educate and 
produce a significant share of the Nation’s 
Black leaders and innovators; 
Whereas as early as the 19th century, 
HBCUs were established in response to dis-
criminatory practices that excluded Black 
Americans from pursuing an education in 
the United States; 
Whereas, on January 5, 2022, at least 8 
HBCUs received bomb threats, including 
Howard University, Xavier University, Uni-
versity of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Prairie 
View A&M University, North Carolina Cen-
tral University, Florida Memorial Univer-
sity, Norfolk State University, and Spelman 
College; 
Whereas, on January 31, 2022, at least 6 
HBCUs received bomb threats, including 
Southern University and A&M, Howard Uni-
versity, Bethune-Cookman University, Al-
bany State University, Bowie State Univer-
sity, and Delaware State University; 
Whereas, on February 1, 2022, the first day 
of Black History Month, at least 18 HBCUs 
received bomb threats, including Shorter 
College, Philander Smith College, Arkansas 
Baptist College, the University of the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Howard University, Ed-
ward Waters University, Spelman College, 
Fort Valley State University, Kentucky 
State University, Xavier University, Coppin 
State University, Morgan State University, 
Jackson State University, Alcorn State Uni-
versity, Mississippi Valley State University, 
Rust College, Tougaloo College, and Harris- 
Stowe State University; 
Whereas HBCUs provide an environment of 
belonging, safety, and security for Black stu-
dents, faculty, and administrators; and 
Whereas these threats against HBCUs dis-
rupt campus environments, obstruct edu-
cational opportunities, increase anxiety, and 
instill fear: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring), That Congress— 
(1) condemns violence and the threat of vi-
olence 
against 
HBCUs, 
including 
bomb 
threats made against several HBCUs on Jan-
uary 5, 2022, January 31, 2022, and February 1, 
2022; and 
(2) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States Federal Government to com-
bat violence against HBCU students, faculty, 
and staff. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and the gentle-
woman 
from 
Iowa 
(Mrs. 
MILLER- 
MEEKS) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and insert extraneous 
material on H. Con. Res. 70. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1347 
March 8, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, over the last 5 months, 
more than 30 of our Nation’s histori-
cally Black colleges and universities, 
including Norfolk State University and 
Hampton University in my district, 
have faced an alarming series of bomb 
threats. 
These threats of violence against 
HBCU students, staff, and communities 
are deplorable and unacceptable. In re-
sponse, schools were forced to cancel 
classes and lock down campuses and 
dormitories, disrupting students’ edu-
cation and depriving them of their 
sense of safety. 
After some prodding, Members of 
Congress were briefed by the Depart-
ment of Justice and learned that the 
FBI is investigating these threats as 
racially motivated and possibly hate 
crimes. It should not go unnoticed that 
these current threats underscore the 
very reason HBCUs were established in 
the first place; to eliminate barriers to 
higher education for Black students by 
creating safe, affirming, and high-qual-
ity institutions. 
Mr. Speaker, we should all agree that 
every student in this country deserves 
to attend a school with a safe and sup-
portive campus. 
This resolution not only condemns 
the recent threats of violence but also 
reaffirms our shared commitment to 
protecting the safety of HBCU stu-
dents. 
I want to thank Congresswoman 
ADAMS for her leadership in crafting 
this resolution, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to send a unified message 
that these disgusting threats of vio-
lence will not be tolerated. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand in unequivocal 
support of H. Con. Res. 70. 
The series of bomb threats against 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities, or HBCUs, is extremely con-
cerning. Threats of violence, especially 
ones motivated by racism and hate, 
have no place in this country. This res-
olution demonstrates our full and un-
wavering support for HBCUs. 
Since the beginning of February, 
over a dozen HBCUs in 5 states and the 
District of Columbia have received 
bomb threats. Threatening the safety 
and education of students in these his-
toric institutions is unacceptable. 
The work HBCUs do on behalf of stu-
dents, families, and communities, is 
critically important. These institu-
tions are invaluable parts of the post-
secondary education landscape, and 
they are changing lives by offering stu-
dents an excellent education. 
For almost 200 years, these institu-
tions have worked to provide Black 
Americans with the skills and edu-
cation they need to become a vital part 
of our workforce. Generations of strong 
and capable leaders have graduated 
from these institutions, including 50 
percent of Black teachers and doctors, 
as well as 80 percent of Black judges. 
Despite massive challenges through-
out their histories, HBCUs have per-
severed. Their ability to thrive under 
immense pressure and hardship is how 
we know they will survive this current 
onslaught of hate. But they will not 
fight against these threats alone. We 
stand by their side so they can con-
tinue to play a critical role in pre-
paring our country’s next generation of 
leaders and innovators. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to join 
me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the majority 
leader of the United States House of 
Representatives. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. SCOTT, the chairman of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, and the 
gentlewoman from Iowa for their com-
ments. We join in unanimity in reject-
ing hate, rejecting bigotry, and reject-
ing threats based upon the color of 
skin or any other attribute, rather 
than adverse conduct. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a 
founding member of the Congressional 
Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, led by Con-
gresswoman ADAMS from North Caro-
lina. I am proud, because historically 
Black colleges and universities not 
only have played a critical role in 
making quality higher education ac-
cessible to more people in my district 
but also because these institutions 
have produced some of the most inno-
vative, 
entrepreneurial, 
and 
trans-
formative leaders for our country. 
When I first learned about the bomb 
threats against several HBCU cam-
puses earlier this year, I was deeply 
alarmed and angered. Disturbingly, 
these threats continue to occur, includ-
ing at Bowie State University, Mary-
land’s oldest HBCU and one of the first 
in our country. It is in my district. 
I picked up the phone and called my 
friend, Aminta Breaux, who is the 
president of Bowie State University, to 
ask about her campus, her students, 
the faculty, their sense of threat, and, 
yes, their sense of well-being. 
On February 2, as the chairman has 
outlined he has done, I sent a letter to 
the Secretary of Homeland Security 
Mayorkas and Attorney General Gar-
land making clear that these threats 
must be taken seriously, and they 
ought to be investigated as hate 
crimes. The chairman has just indi-
cated that is what they are doing. That 
was, of course, during February, Black 
History Month. 
Sadly, the history of Black Ameri-
cans, of those brought here in 1619 in 
chains who, for another 21⁄2 centuries, 
lived in those chains or lived in seg-
regation—and I mean America, not just 
the South—lived in a place where they 
were discriminated against and shut 
out. 
The threats made against histori-
cally Black colleges and universities in 
2022 recall the horrific attacks made on 
students who worked to integrate high-
er education during the 1950s and 1960s, 
against young Freedom Riders. 
Mr. Speaker, I spent this past week-
end in Montgomery, Alabama, Bir-
mingham, Alabama, and Selma, Ala-
bama. My dear friend John Lewis went 
with me every time I went there. He 
went more often, obviously. We walked 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to-
gether, half of those times hand in 
hand. We miss John, but his spirit was 
there. His cry for justice was there. His 
cry for freedom and respect was there. 
The threats made against histori-
cally Black colleges and universities 
were a failure of some of our citizens to 
understand the grief, the wrong, the 
original sin of slavery, and the rami-
fications of that to this very day. 
b 1230 
Today’s young Americans, like those 
young Americans, deserve to spend 
their college years free from violence 
and harassment, free from the hate and 
intolerance that it manifests. They de-
serve to learn and grow and expand 
their horizons without fear of bombs, 
gun violence, or threats of attack. 
Martin Luther King, in his ‘‘I Have a 
Dream’’ speech, spoke about young 
Black boys and young Black girls with 
young White boys and young White 
girls holding hands in solidarity as 
Americans based upon the content of 
their character, not the color of their 
skin. 
This bipartisan resolution before us 
expresses that determination and con-
cern of the House for the safety and 
well-being of students, faculty, and 
staff at historically Black colleges and 
universities across the country. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
ADAMS and Republican Member HILL. 
This is bipartisan. This is about Amer-
ica. This is about who we are. This is 
about who we want to stand up for and 
what we want to stand up about. 
Let us come together today in a 
strong show of unity and resolve to say 
that this kind of hateful and criminal 
activity has no place in our country 
and runs counter to our principles of 
freedom, 
justice, 
opportunity, 
and 
equality. 
John Lewis is not with us physically 
here today, but his spirit is on this 
floor, and on his behalf I urge every 
one of our colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ for 
justice, for respect, for America. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Louisiana (Ms. LETLOW). 
Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H. Con. Res. 70. 
Like countless Americans, I am deep-
ly shocked by the recent threats 
against our Nation’s historically Black 
colleges and universities. As a former 
educator who spent my career working 
on college campuses, I firmly believe 
that every student has the right to 
learn in a safe environment and free 
from threats and intimidation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1348 
March 8, 2022 
I am proud to say that my State of 
Louisiana is home to some of the Na-
tion’s most iconic HBCUs, including 
Grambling State University, Southern 
University, and Xavier University of 
Louisiana. I am saddened to know the 
emotional anguish that students, fac-
ulty, and staff went through last 
month when threats were made against 
Southern and Xavier. 
Today, we send a clear message to 
those that want to use fear, intimida-
tion, and hatred against our Nation’s 
HBCUs: We will never just stand by and 
let you terrorize our students, our next 
generation of leaders, and our future. 
So many Members of this Congress 
are 
united, 
both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, and we are proud to sup-
port America’s HBCUs with this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from the District of Columbia (Ms. 
NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for this 
important resolution. I rise in support 
of this resolution condemning threats 
of violence against historically Black 
colleges and universities. 
As the Member from the District of 
Columbia, I also represent two histori-
cally Black colleges and universities, 
Howard University and the University 
of the District of Columbia. Last 
month, several D.C. schools were tar-
geted, including my own alma mater, 
Dunbar High School. 
This resolution is important to not 
only express our outrage at these 
threats of violence, but to reaffirm our 
commitment to the students, faculty, 
and staff at these universities. 
HBCUs are responsible for educating 
the next generation and preparing 
them for their careers. The value they 
have for the District of Columbia and 
the country cannot be overstated. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of this resolution, and I appreciate 
the opportunity to work on it with my 
good friend and co-chair of the HBCU 
Caucus, ALMA ADAMS. ALMA and I have 
worked tirelessly over the past year 
and a half on issues of importance to 
our HBCUs. We were elected together 
in 2014 and have both been actively en-
gaged in helping lead on HBCU issues 
before this Congress over the past four 
terms. 
All four of Arkansas’ HBCUs have re-
ceived bomb threats, Mr. Speaker. Uni-
versity of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, our 
land grant university, was the first to 
receive a bomb threat. Later, Phi-
lander Smith, Arkansas Baptist Col-
lege, and Shorter College all received 
bomb threats, all in my hometown of 
Little Rock. 
These bomb threats began on Janu-
ary 4, and we are seeing continued 
bomb threats even as of last week. Ac-
cording to the FBI, at least 28 histori-
cally Black colleges and universities 
have received such a threat, and they 
have received threats multiple times. 
Imagine being a student and learning 
your school has had a bomb threat. 
Imagine being a parent and learning 
that your child’s school has had a 
bomb threat. It would be terrifying. As 
a student, a campus community mem-
ber, or a parent, this cannot stand. 
These bomb threats are meant to in-
voke fear in our HBCU communities. 
This violence is unacceptable, and it 
cannot become the norm for our his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities. I am deeply disturbed and sad-
dened that we even have to be on the 
floor today to carry on this conversa-
tion. 
We are condemning these threats by 
this resolution. I expect an over-
whelming bipartisan support. I urge it. 
I thank ALMA, again, for her leadership 
on it. I thank Mr. SCOTT and Mrs. MIL-
LER-MEEKS. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
in January, 14 HBCUs received bomb 
threats. Even worse, on the first day of 
Black History Month, 18 HBCUs re-
ceived bomb threats. That is more than 
30 threats to our HBCUs in only 3 
months. That is simply appalling and 
unacceptable. 
The numbers show threats to HBCUs 
are rising. These threats have no place 
in our communities. These actions 
must stop now and should be con-
demned by Congress now. 
As a proud graduate of the Thurgood 
Marshall School of Law at Texas 
Southern University, an HBCU institu-
tion, and a proud member of the HBCU 
Caucus, I am honored to cosponsor H. 
Con. Res. 70, which condemns these 
threats to our HBCUs. 
Students deserve to be free from fear. 
College is for learning, not for bomb-
ing. I urge my colleagues to condemn 
these acts now and support this resolu-
tion. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank Chairman SCOTT
for yielding, 
and for also working so closely with 
Representative ADAMS to get us to this 
point. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know how we 
got here, except that I know that we 
can’t, as a Nation, stay at this point. 
There is no reason that Black colleges 
and universities, and the students that 
attend them, ought to be threatened in 
this sort of way with this sort of al-
most impunity by racists who think 
that they can do that and that there 
will not be a response. 
I happen to be chair of the Board of 
Regents at Morgan State University, a 
historically Black college, founding 
itself 4 years after Lincoln signed the 
Emancipation Proclamation, and has 
turned out, over that period of time, 
thousands of bright young people who 
have come out all over the country and 
are serving in different capacities. 
In my State of Maryland, whether it 
was 
Morgan 
State 
University, 
or 
Coppin State University, or Bowie 
State, you cannot imagine the sense of 
uncertainty that students had, know-
ing that they were under threat and 
that at any minute something could, in 
fact, happen. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Maryland. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, for them 
who are the extensions of a race of peo-
ple who have suffered, endured, and 
survived two centuries of slavery, op-
pression, deprivation, degradation, de-
nial, and disprivilege, none of them 
should have to matriculate in this 
country at an institution of higher 
education under those conditions sim-
ply because they are Black. 
I strongly urge this condemnation to 
be approved by this body. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
we certainly all remain unified in con-
demning the bomb threats, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I proudly stand with my col-
leagues to condemn the terrorizing of 
our historically Black colleges and uni-
versities. 
The cowards who made bomb threats 
to America’s HBCUs sought to sow fear 
on the very campuses where Black 
scholars seek belonging, safety, and 
support. 
They exploited the legacy of bomb-
ings long inflicted on Black commu-
nities, like those ignited in Jim Crow 
Florida at White businesses that served 
Blacks, at synagogues, and at the home 
of the brave civil rights pioneers, 
Harry and Harriet Moore. 
They tried to light the same fires of 
hatred right outside Black bastions of 
higher learning, like Florida Memorial, 
Edward Waters, and Bethune-Cookman 
Universities. 
On the first day of Black History 
Month in 2022—2022—over a dozen other 
HBCUs 
saw 
bomb 
threats 
and 
lockdowns. If Howard and Spelman 
aren’t safe, they seem to warn, then 
neither is FAMU. 
HBCUs were always scholarly havens 
when Whites shut Black students out, 
and they still mold strong Black lead-
ers, celebrate Black culture, and nur-
ture academic excellence. 
Hatred cannot diminish that, and it 
will not, but only if we unite as one to 
affirm that racism and terror will not 
be tolerated on college campuses, espe-
cially our HBCUs. A threat to one, 
after all, is a threat to us all. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Ms. BUSH).

cally Black colleges and universities. 
Nearly 30 bomb threats have been 
levied 
against 
HBCUs 
in 
recent 
months. My own alma mater, Harris- 
Stowe State University in St. Louis, 
was subjected to this dangerous vio-
lence on the first day of Black History 
Month. As one of only two HBCUs in 
Missouri, Harris-Stowe should be a safe 
haven for Black students to learn, to 
grow, to fully realize their humanity. 
As proud Harris-Stowe Hornets, we 
know the antidote to white suprema-
cy’s violence and intimidation is Black 
education and our liberation. 
I thank my HBCU sister in service, 
Congresswoman 
ADAMS, 
for 
cham-
pioning this legislation and bringing 
the issue of white supremacist violence 
against HBCUs for consideration in the 
U.S. House of Representatives. I am 
proud to support this resolution and to 
join my colleagues in condemning the 
bomb threats against HBCUs. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER). 
b 1245 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding, and a special thanks to Rep-
resentative ALMA ADAMS for her tire-
less efforts on behalf of our Nation’s 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities. 
HBCUs were built to educate and cel-
ebrate the Black community when very 
few would. At Xavier University in 
New Orleans, my mother was able to 
bring six children to class while she 
finished her college degree. Little did 
she know that her children and grand-
children would later attend and grad-
uate from the very same university. 
We are barely 2 full months into the 
year, but dozens of HBCUs are on high 
alert amid several instances of racially 
motivated threats of violence. HBCUs 
are resilient institutions that can 
weather any storm but should not have 
to weather this type of storm. 
The threats to these higher edu-
cation institutions are not just dis-
rupting postsecondary education. They 
are disrupting the very underlying 
sense of safety and community of the 
HBCUs. The fact that this has been un-
dermined is perhaps the biggest trav-
esty of all. 
Let us be clear: These threats are 
acts of terror, and they must be ur-
gently investigated and prosecuted. We 
must help foster safety in the HBCU 
communities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. CAR-
TER). 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. We must 
help foster safety in HBCU commu-
nities. Today’s resolution is a way that 
Congress 
can 
commit 
to 
fighting 
against hatred and racism and stand 
with HBCUs. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
how much time is remaining on both 
sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 101⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
Iowa has 151⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for bringing this resolution to the 
floor. 
Today, I rise in strong support of this 
resolution condemning threats of vio-
lence against historically Black col-
leges and universities, or HBCUs, and 
reaffirming the important role that 
HBCUs play in our country’s edu-
cation, innovation, and leadership. 
I am a proud graduate of Morehouse 
College, one of 107 HBCUs across this 
country. My district, in middle and 
southwest Georgia, is home to two dis-
tinguished HBCUs, Fort Valley State 
University and Albany State Univer-
sity, both of which were targeted dur-
ing last month’s bomb threats. 
The incitement of fear and hatred is 
utterly unacceptable, should be intol-
erable, and has no place anywhere, let 
alone at our sacred places of learning. 
These threats came on the cusp of 
Black History Month, and they remind 
us that we still have not achieved the 
colorblind world that was dreamed of 
by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and of 
the important educational mission and 
empowering roles that HBCUs play for 
the African-American community and 
our Nation. 
Today, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this resolution condemning these 
dangerous threats to our Nation’s 
HBCUs and the African-American com-
munity and demand that those respon-
sible be brought to justice for their hei-
nous actions. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS), the 
chair of the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus 
and sponsor of the resolution. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD statements from UNCF, 
TMCF, NAFEO, Alabama A&M’s Presi-
dent Wims, and the Executive Leader-
ship Council in support of the resolu-
tion. 
WASHINGTON, DC (February 7, 2022).—Over 
the past month, more than two dozen his-
torically Black colleges and universities 
(HBCUs) have received terroristic threats in 
an apparent attempt to disrupt and, presum-
ably, sow fear in our campus communities. 
These attempts to intimidate the HBCU 
community reached a peak on Tuesday, Feb. 
1—the first day of Black History Month— 
when 13 HBCUs were forced to disrupt their 
normal 
operations 
due 
to 
coordinated 
threats posed to their respective campuses. 
The United Negro College Fund (UNCF) 
and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund 
(TMCF) are pleased that the federal govern-
ment has characterized its ongoing inves-
tigation into these threats as ‘‘threats of 
terror with the utmost seriousness’’ and as 
acts of domestic terrorism, as announced 
during a recent briefing by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigations (FBI) and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (DHS). Given the 
federal 
government’s 
characterization 
of 
these threats, we anticipate and expect that 
the Justice Department will fully prosecute 
the individuals responsible for these heinous 
acts and we look forward to the swift conclu-
sion of this matter. 
Unfortunately, these terrorist acts fall 
squarely into a recent trend line documented 
by the Center for Strategic and Inter-
national Studies that reflects a sharp in-
crease in right-wing extremist attacks and 
plots in the United States in recent years. 
HBCUs, as institutions founded for the origi-
nal purpose of educating and uplifting 
former enslaved people and their descend-
ants, have been at the forefront of social and 
economic justice advocacy for more than 180 
years. Our universities’ missions and their 
historic legacies naturally put them at odds 
with the enemies of equality which, even in 
the 21st century, makes our institutions and 
their students, staff, faculty and administra-
tors an apparent target for extremism. Not-
withstanding these attempts to terrorize our 
community, our HBCUs remain unbroken 
and unbowed. 
The actions of a misguided few will not 
deter our institutions from fulfilling their 
collective mission to educate our nation’s 
next generation of teachers, entrepreneurs 
and leaders. We are hopeful that congres-
sional, state, community and philanthropic 
leaders will join with us and offer the sup-
port that is needed for us to offer our stu-
dents the sense of security needed as we 
move forward with the same sense of resil-
ience we have shown since the founding of 
the first HBCU in 1837. 
Reflecting on these incidents, we are re-
minded of the words of the late Supreme 
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, which still 
are instructive today: 
‘‘I wish I could say that racism and preju-
dice were only distant memories. We must 
dissent from the indifference. We must dis-
sent from the apathy. We must dissent from 
indifference. We must dissent from the apa-
thy. We must dissent from the fear, the ha-
tred and the mistrust . . . We must dissent 
because America can do better, because 
America has no choice but to do better.

DEAR
CONGRESSIONAL
BIPARTISAN
HBCU 
CAUCUS CO-CHAIRS ADAMS, HILL, COONS AND 
SCOTT: I am writing in my capacity as Presi-
dent & CEO of the National Association for 
Equal Opportunity in Higher Education 
(NAFEO), which, as you know, is the na-
tion’s only 501 (c) (3) membership and advo-
cacy association for all HBCUs and PBIs. I 
am joined by Attorney John Pierre, Chan-
cellor of the Southern University Law Cen-
ter, and Chair of the NAFEO Presidential 
Policy, Advocacy & Legal Advisory Board. 
We are writing to express our profound grati-
tude for your leadership of the Congressional 
Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, which, along with 
support from other congressional leaders, 
members of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
bipartisan support from other Members of 
Congress, and leadership from the Adminis-
tration, yielded more than $5.8 billion for 
HBCUs, their students, families, faculty, 
staff, infrastructure, and service commu-
nities. This represents a greater federal in-
vestment in HBCUs than any time in the Na-
tion’s history. It was a substantial down- 
payment on closing the gulf between public 
and private investments in HBCUs as com-
pared with their historically White college 
and university counterparts, relative to 
their missions and student outcomes. 
We are writing at this time to let you that 
our members are poised to do whatever is re-
quired to assist you and your colleagues in 
moving the Nation closer toward closing the 
HBCU/HWCU funding gap and building a 
stronger, peaceful, equitable, just America. 
We are concerned that the recent bomb 
threats on HBCU campuses, must be taken 
seriously. Consideration must be given to 
Congress requesting that Homeland Secu-
rity, the FBI, Department of Justice, and the 
Department of Education, repurpose some of 
their existing funds to provide HBCUs addi-
tional resources, immediately, with which to 
provide the training and infrastructure they 
need to ensure the safety of their campus 
community, and their service communities. 
Additionally, where, as in the case of Home-
land Security, a federal department or agen-
cy is poised to make grant funds available in 
the spring, that could be used to better pre-
pare the campuses for any possible assault 
with a clear plan, based on the most prom-
ising practices, while moving everyone on 
the campuses and in their service commu-
nities out of harm’s way, consideration 
should be given to making the funds avail-
able now. 
We believe we must act immediately on 
the assumption that the perpetrators may 
make good on some of the threats because: 
(1) The perpetrators of the bomb threats 
have not been publicly identified; (2) The in-
stitutional targets are moving; (3) The 
threats are coming: (a) amid heightened in-
cendiary racist rhetoric, and unabated race- 
based assaults; (b) amid increased state ac-
tions to suppress the Black & Hispanic vote; 
(c) amid efforts to trammel the First Amend-
ment rights of professors who want to in-
clude in curricula a comprehensive examina-
tion of America’s past and present, including 
discussions about Blacks in America; (d) as 
polls show that many disaffected Whites be-
lieve their plight is due to Blacks in America 
gaining ‘‘too much,’’ although the December 
jobs reports demonstrate that the unemploy-
ment rate for White people dropped (3.2 per-
cent), Asian Americans (3.8 percent), and 
Latino/Hispanic people (4.9 percent), while 
the unemployment rate for Blacks increased 
from 
6.5 
percent 
to 
7.1 
percent, 
dem-
onstrating the entrenched, intractable and 
growing racial employment gap, especially 
for Black women; 
In spite of their perception, the Black- 
White gaps in education, employment, sala-
ries, wealth, health, sustainability, and jus-
tice persist. (e) The bomb threats on HBCU 
campuses coincide with reports documenting 
the billions of dollars that HBCUs have been 
denied to which they are entitled, high-
lighting the tremendous disparities between 
funds for the historically White land-grant 
institutions 
(1862s) 
and 
the 
historically 
Black land-grant institutions (1890s), and the 
failure of many states to provide the con-
gressionally 
mandated 
one-to-one 
match 
funding for 1890 land-grant universities; (f) 
The bomb threats on HBCU campuses are oc-
curring as reports indicate the January 6th 
Congressional Commission is unearthing in-
formation that may result in exposure of the 
masterminds. 
The HBCU Community thanks you for your 
leadership in calling for a Congressional Res-
olution 
condemning 
the 
bomb 
threats 
against HBCUs and denouncing violence, 
supporting peace, tolerance, and ecumenism. 
The HBCUs have a rich and cherished history 
of leading in teaching about civility, com-
batting violence by highlighting the oneness 
of humankind, respect for our pluralism, and 
teaching the imperatives of love, mercy, jus-
tice, and for a peaceful coexistence in our 
pluralistic nation. We stand ready to engage 
our members in educating their Members 
about the importance of your resolution es-
pecially during such times as these. 
With thanksgiving, 
LEZLI BASKERVILLE,

ALABAMA AGRICULTURAL AND 
MECHANICAL UNIVERSITY,

Hon. ALMA ADAMS, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CONGRESSWOMAN
ADAMS: Approxi-
mately around 2:30 a.m. on Monday, January 
31, 2022, law enforcement officials at historic 
Alabama A&M University received notice 
that the campus was the target of a bomb 
threat and indicating the quadrants that 
would be impacted by the device. Thanks to 
the immediate actions of our campus police 
and its continuing partnership with the 
Huntsville Police Department and the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, the University 
received an ‘‘all clear’’ to resume operations 
prior to the start of the business day. 
While this designation was a relief, the 
chronicled and persistent threats on all 
fronts to historically black colleges and uni-
versities (HBCUs) must be taken seriously. 
While representing a small percentage of 
America’s 
vast 
higher 
learning 
system, 
HBCUs’ role over more than a century has 
been nothing short of phenomenal. Thus, we 
wholeheartedly support the resolution led by 
you and Congressman French Hill outright 
condemning these persistent acts of domes-
tic terrorism. Our HBCUs have proven their 
merit by making the American Dream acces-
sible to thousands. We must do everything in 
our power to ensure their continued exist-
ence. 
Thank you for your ongoing leadership and 
work in Congress and for your and your col-
leagues’ adamant stand for one of our na-
tion’s greatest resources, our HBCUs. 
Sincerely, 
DANIEL K. WIMS, PH.D., 
President. 
THE
EXECUTIVE
LEADERSHIP
COUNCIL’S 
STATEMENT
IN
RESPONSE
TO
RECENT 
THREATS
OF RACIAL VIOLENCE
AT HBCUS 
ACROSS THE NATION 
WASHINGTON, DC (February 8, 2022)—The 
right to an education is one of our nation’s 
greatest 
freedoms. 
George 
Washington 
Carver, renowned scientist, and professor at 
Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee Univer-
sity) once said, ‘‘Education is the key to 
unlock the golden door of freedom to our 
people.’’ 
Historically Black colleges and univer-
sities (HBCUs) are some of the nation’s most 
enduring symbols of what can be achieved 
when a people are determined to prosper. For 
decades, HBCU’s have faced threats of racial 
violence. These threats are violent attempts 
to keep Black people from receiving edu-
cations that ultimately unlock economic op-
portunity in America. 
The Executive Leadership Council (ELC) 
issued the following statement in response to 
the recent bomb threats targeted at HBCUs 
across the country. 
Please see our statement, below: 
Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities (HBCUs) are essential to the American 
story. 
Since their inception, HBCUs have edu-
cated and trained America’s most brilliant 
Black scholars, doctors, lawyers, and a myr-
iad of other professionals—from the first 
Black Supreme Court Justice of the United 
States Thurgood Marshall to Kamala Harris, 
the first woman elected Vice President of the 
United States. HBCUs have made a tremen-
dous impact on American progress. 
However, despite their rich history, HBCUs 
are historically underfunded and often sub-
ject to threats of racial violence. The recent 
bomb threats at HBCU’s nationwide are par-
ticularly disturbing. Our students deserve to 
feel safe on campus. 
We applaud the administration’s swift re-
sponse but recognize that distractions like 
this only deepen the chasm between HBCU 
students and their counterparts at univer-
sities that do not face continuous instruc-
tional disruptions. These threats are as ma-
terial as they are symbolic and we, the mem-
bers of The Executive Leadership Council 
(ELC), take them very seriously. 
The ELC is the preeminent global member-
ship organization for Black current and 
former CEOs, senior executives. and board 
members of Fortune 1000 and equivalent 
companies. We advocate for advancing Black 
leadership by increasing the number of Black 
corporate CEOs, C-Suite executives, and 
board members, as well as building a pipeline 
for the next generation of Black corporate 
leaders. HBCU graduates account for a sig-
nificant number of the Black talent pipeline 
for the public and private sectors—HBCU 
students are the nation’s workforce of the 
future. 
If our nation seeks to continue cultivating 
diverse talent and reaping the proven results 
of inclusive leadership—it is imperative that 
we prioritize investing in these historic in-
stitutions and the overall safety of their stu-
dents. We hope Congress and the Biden-Har-
ris Administration will continue to support

thoughtful legislation that serves to protect 
these institutions and will work to pass the 
HBCU Ignite for Excellence Act, which pro-
vides needed federal investment for these in-
stitutions that mean so much to America 
and her continued success. 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
SCOTT
for his courageous leadership 
and support of our schools. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my resolution (H. Con. Res. 70), 
which condemns the recent despicable, 
cowardly bomb threats to more than 30 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities. These were hate crimes, acts of 
terror. 
As a proud two-time HBCU alumna of 
North Carolina A&T State University, 
a retired professor of 40 years at Ben-
nett College in Greensboro, and now a 
representative of Johnson C. Smith 
University in my district, I know 
HBCUs can overcome any challenge, 
but those challenges should not include 
terrorism or racism. 
The congressional response from my 
colleagues to these threats has been ro-
bust. We came together to call for swift 
action from Federal law enforcement. 
The threats were quickly addressed 
by members of Federal, State, and 
local law enforcement. Thanks to the 
Department of Justice and its agencies 
for working swiftly in this regard. 
My thanks as well to Chairman 
SCOTT, whose leadership has resulted in 
more than $6.5 billion in funding to 
HBCUs, more funding than the last 10 
years combined. 
Our HBCUs, their faculty, their staff, 
and 
especially 
their 
students 
are 
strong. They are resilient. They are 
brilliant paragons of academic excel-
lence. But they shouldn’t have to re-
spond to threats and secure their cam-
puses on shoestring budgets. 
While today’s resolution rightly con-
demns these cowardly acts of violence 
against our hallowed institutions, Con-
gress must continue to respond with 
action and legislation. 
Finally, I want to address the per-
petrators of these crimes. I am praying 
that the hate that inspired these acts 
leaves your heart forever, that you 
take a moment and imagine yourself in 
different circumstances. 
Imagine growing up on the ghetto 
streets of Newark, New Jersey, your 
mom cleaning houses to make ends 
meet. You save every penny to go to 
college because the most important 
people in your life have taught you the 
value of education. 
You make it to an HBCU, becoming 
the first member of your family to go 
to college. It is a big responsibility. Be-
cause HBCUs are special places, espe-
cially for Black Americans, they invest 
in you. They lift you up. They help you 
succeed in ways you never thought pos-
sible. They take you from cleaning 
houses with your mom to serving in 
the U.S. House. 
Similar experiences are shared by 
millions, and that is what you at-
tacked 
when 
you 
threatened 
our 
HBCUs. That is what you deemed wor-
thy of hate and violence. And that is 
why Congress must condemn these ac-
tions. 
Mr. Speaker, I move that we pass 
this resolution, and I ask all of my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I have no further requests for time 
from Members who are present. I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, I have 
learned about the ways in which 
HBCUs serve our country’s students 
and postsecondary education commu-
nity. For decades, HBCUs have pro-
vided countless opportunities for men 
and women to achieve their goals, 
whether academic, professional, or per-
sonal. 
Threats of violence against HBCUs 
are despicable and cowardly. We fully 
and unequivocally condemn these acts 
of hate. They have no place in our 
country. 
HBCUs deserve to be celebrated, not 
threatened. That is why I am voting in 
favor of H. Con. Res. 70, and I urge all 
of my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, as many of our col-
leagues have stated, HBCUs play an in-
valuable role in our higher education 
system and in our communities. 
Despite facing chronic underfunding 
in the past, and disproportionately suf-
fering from the pandemic, these insti-
tutions have persevered to open the 
door to higher-quality higher edu-
cation for generations of students over 
the years. 
However, we cannot expect these in-
stitutions to maintain their legacy of 
expanding access to education when 
their basic safety and security con-
tinue to be threatened. 
Each of us has the responsibility to 
condemn these recent threats of vio-
lence against HBCUs and reaffirm our 
support for HBCU students, staff, and 
communities. 
Moving forward, we must also build 
on the historic relief funding that Con-
gress has provided for these critical in-
stitutions and secure the resources 
they need to recover from the pan-
demic and prepare students for their 
success. 
I thank the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL) and, the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) for 
their leadership with the Bipartisan 
HBCU 
Caucus—particularly 
Ms. 
ADAMS—for her extraordinary leader-
ship over the years with the caucus and 
her leadership in sponsoring this reso-
lution. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote for this resolution, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of House Concurrent 
Resolution 70, which condemns any and all 
threats of violence against HBCUs and ex-
presses our support for their staff, faculty, and 
students. 
Over the past few weeks, several HBCUs 
across the country were subjected to anony-
mous, unacceptable threats of violence on 
their campuses. These threats disrupted cam-
pus, obstructed classes, and struck fear into 
the HBCU community. 
HBCUs were originally established to offer 
Black students an equal opportunity for higher 
education, free from racial discrimination and 
intimidation. Now, these institutions offer 
among the most competitive educations in the 
country and have produced some of our 
brightest leaders. This growth is certainly a 
sign of progress—but the prevalence of these 
threats is a solemn reminder that we still have 
work to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the Bipartisan Congressional 
HBCU Caucus and an original co-sponsor, I 
rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 70, a 
resolution condemning threats of violence 
against historically Black colleges and univer-
sities (‘‘HBCUs’’) and reaffirming support for 
HBCUs and their students. 
I thank Congresswoman ALMA ADAMS and 
Congressman FRENCH HILL, the co-chairs of 
the HBCU Caucus, for their work in bringing 
this important legislation to the floor. 
A high-quality education is central to eco-
nomic prosperity and social well-being in the 
United States and HBCUs provide educational 
and economic opportunities for postsecondary 
students. 
As early as the 19th century, HBCUs were 
established in response to discriminatory prac-
tices that excluded Black Americans from pur-
suing an education in the United States. 
HBCUs educate and produce a significant 
share of the Nation’s Black leaders and 
innovators. 
On January 5, 2022, at least 8 HBCUs re-
ceived bomb threats, including Howard Univer-
sity, Xavier University, University of Arkansas 
at Pine Bluff, Prairie View A&M University, 
North Carolina Central University, Florida Me-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1352 
March 8, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud that one of the 
greatest HBCUs in the country, Texas South-
ern University, is located in my congressional 
district. 
Texas Southern University has a rich history 
with nine academic units, 1,000 dedicated 
staff members, and over 9,200 esteemed stu-
dents. 
Like most of my HBCU Caucus colleagues, 
I have worked closely with my local HBCU to 
provide funding and resources needed to en-
able them to fulfill their mission of educating 
the next generation of social engineers and 
conducting research programs addressing 
issues of major concern to the African Amer-
ican community. 
As Chairwoman of the Homeland Security 
Subcommittee on Transportation Security and 
Infrastructure Protection in the 111th Con-
gress, I authored the legislation to establish a 
Transportation Security Center of Excellence 
at TSU and worked to help TSU secure $1.2 
million in funding over four years from the De-
partment of Homeland Security for this Center 
of Excellence. 
One of my proudest accomplishments as a 
member of Congress is my success in working 
with federal officials in the Clinton Administra-
tion to settle the lawsuit against TSU that had 
been pending for more than 23 years. 
I was proud to spearhead the initiative that 
brought more than $13 million in financial aid 
relief for the students and campus of Texas 
Southern University. 
I also worked with TSU administrators to ini-
tiate digital archive projects to preserve the 
records of two of its most distinguished alum-
ni, the legendary Barbara Jordan and Mickey 
Leland, both of whom preceded me as the 
Member of Congress for the Eighteenth Con-
gressional District of Texas. 
I was pleased to facilitate a partnership be-
tween Comcast and TSU’s School of Commu-
nication to provide’ scholarships and intern-
ships to TSU students and in-kind marketing 
services to the university. 
I helped secure funding needed to establish 
the Center for Transportation, Training and 
Research in the TSU College of Science, En-
gineering, and Technology. 
HBCU’s have played a critical role in Amer-
ican history. 
As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stat-
ed: 
‘‘The function of education is to teach one to 
think intensively and to think critically. Intel-
ligence plus character—that is the goal of true 
education.’’ 
HBCUs do not just educate—HBCUs have 
and will continue to fill an important role in 
education opportunity and engagement for mil-
lions of young people from diverse back-
grounds. 
I ask my colleagues to joining me in voting 
to pass H. Con. Res. 70, condemning threats 
of violence against one of the nation’s greatest 
resources, historically black colleges and uni-
versities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the concurrent reso-
lution, H. Con. Res. 70, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-

Swann, one of his secretaries.

CONDEMNING THE HEINOUS TER-
RORIST ATTACK ON CONGREGA-
TION 
BETH 
ISRAEL 
IN 
COLLEYVILLE, TEXAS 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and agree to the resolution 
(H. Res. 881) condemning the heinous 
terrorist attack on Congregation Beth 
Israel in Colleyville, Texas, on January 
15, 2022, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 881 
Whereas, on January 15, 2022, Malik Faisal 
Akram entered Congregation Beth Israel in 
Colleyville, Texas, taking four individuals 
hostage; 
Whereas MI5, Britain’s counterintelligence 
and security agency investigated Mr. Akram 
in 2020, and he was listed as a subject of in-
terest, but was later determined to no longer 
pose a threat; 
Whereas Mr. Akram arrived at New York’s 
John F. Kennedy Airport on December 29, 
2021, staying in New York City for two days 
until taking a flight to Dallas, Texas; 
Whereas it is reported Mr. Akram chose 
the synagogue because it appeared to be the 
closest gathering of Jewish people to a Fed-
eral prison where he demanded to see a 
woman who is in custody after being found 
guilty of two counts of attempted murder, 
armed assault, using and carrying a firearm, 
and three counts of assault on United States 
officers and employees in Afghanistan; 
Whereas according to the Anti-Defamation 
League, in 2020 and 2021, there were 8,366 in-
cidents of extremism or antisemitism in the 
United States; 
Whereas more than half of the religiously 
motivated hate crimes reported to the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation in 2020 were 
anti-Jewish hate crimes; 
Whereas Jewish Americans make up about 
2 percent of the population of the United 
States, but crimes against them make up 55 
percent of the anti-religious hate crimes in 
the United States; 
Whereas, on Sunday, January 16, 2022, 
President Joe Biden classified this attack as 
an act of terror and Vice President Kamala 
Harris affirmed we should combat anti-
semitism and hate wherever it exists; 
Whereas the four hostages were held for 
nearly 11 hours, during that time Rabbi 
Charlie Cytron-Walker used the skills he 
learned by attending several security courses 
hosted by local law enforcement, the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, the Anti-Defama-
tion League, and the Secure Community 
Network; 
Whereas Good Shepherd Catholic Commu-
nity church provided support and housed 
family members of the worshipers held in-
side the Synagogue during the 11 hour stand-
off; 
Whereas Pleasant Run Baptist Church of-
fered their thoughts and support during the 
standoff, and allowed for their parking lot to 
be used by the media; 
Whereas worshipers who were watching 
service virtually contacted local law enforce-
ment once they realized there was an inci-
dent underway at Congregation Beth Israel; 
and 
Whereas because of the swift response from 
local, State, and Federal law enforcement of-
ficers and emergency responders on the 
ground, no hostages were harmed during the 
hostage situation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) 
stands 
with 
the 
community 
of 
Colleyville, Texas, the hostages, and all 
those affected by the terrorist attack on 
Congregation Beth Israel on January 15, 2022; 
(2) commends the Federal, State, and local 
law enforcement officers and emergency re-
sponders who responded to Congregation 
Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas; 
(3) condemns this heinous terrorist attack; 
and 
(4) reaffirms our commitment to combat 
hate, bigotry, antisemitism, and violence 
against Jewish Americans. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
FALLON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 881, and I condemn in the 
strongest terms the hateful attack on 
Congregation 
Beth 
Israel 
of 
Colleyville, Texas, on January 15 of 
this year. 
Anti-Semitism is a dangerous and 
growing crisis both in the United 
States and around the world. Accord-
ing to the Anti-Defamation League, in 
2020 and 2021 alone, there were 8,366 in-
cidents of extremism or anti-Semitism 
just here in the United States. 
According to the FBI, in 2020, more 
than half of the religiously motivated 
hate crimes reported targeted Jewish 
people, even though Jewish Americans 
make up only 2 percent of the popu-
lation of the United States of America. 
This is a staggering level of anti-Semi-
tism. 
Tragically, on January 15, 2022, vio-
lent anti-Semitism became all too real 
for the Congregation Beth Israel in 
Colleyville, Texas. Four individuals 
were taken hostage simply for being 
Jewish. 
Although all hostages were eventu-
ally rescued safely, this attack never

should have happened in the first place. 
After the defeat of Nazi Germany in 
1945, the revelations of the barbarity, 
and the scope of the Holocaust, the 
world vowed never again. Yet, the hate 
and bigotry that drove the Nazis to 
commit genocide is still alive and well. 
This is something we simply cannot 
allow to continue. 
I have made fighting hatred and anti- 
Semitism—a personal mission. In 2020, 
we passed my bill, the Never Again 
Holocaust Education Act, to support 
Holocaust education in all schools 
across this country so that the next 
generation will learn the horrific con-
sequences of anti-Semitism, bigotry, 
and hate. 
b 1300 
Freedom of religion is one of the 
most basic rights afforded to every 
American in the First Amendment of 
our Constitution. No one should face 
discrimination or violence because of 
their religious beliefs. 
We must send a clear and unequivo-
cal message that anti-Semitism has ab-
solutely no place here in the United 
States. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
VAN DUYNE, for introducing this impor-
tant resolution. Let it be a reminder 
that the rallying cry of ‘‘never again’’ 
must be more than mere words. It is 
our duty to come together to denounce 
anti-Semitism and hate, and this reso-
lution does just that. 
I encourage all of my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this January 15, 2022, 
tragedy struck a community in my 
home State of Texas. A terrorist held 
four people hostage at a Jewish syna-
gogue for 11 hours. We are immensely 
grateful that each hostage ultimately 
escaped unharmed, though the psycho-
logical scars are real for the victims 
and lasting for the community. 
This act of terrorism has no place in 
our society. 
Today, my colleagues, in the strong-
est terms and means possible, firmly 
and fiercely condemn the terrorist’s 
acts and condemn those who target any 
Americans, and in this instance our 
Jewish brothers and sisters. 
Early in the morning on Saturday, 
January 15, 2022, the Congregation 
Beth Israel near Fort Worth, Texas, 
was targeted. 
At this synagogue, worshipers wel-
comed the attacker inside. The rabbi 
even made him tea. The worshipers 
faced Jerusalem and began to pray. 
The attacker then pulled out his weap-
on, and an 11-hour standoff ensued. 
That Saturday, America held its 
breath. We prayed for the safe return of 
loved ones and family members. 
No one in America should ever face 
this kind of fear and terror and evil. 
The worshipers at Congregation Beth 
Israel 
showed 
remarkable 
courage 
when faced with evil in their own house 
of worship. 
And all Americans rose to the occa-
sion when our sisters and brothers 
faced this kind of adversity. The four 
hostages, including the rabbi, battled 
their attacker. Later, the hostages 
were able to escape, and the FBI’s Hos-
tage Rescue Team secured the syna-
gogue. 
Americans, as one, rushed in to sup-
port Congregation Beth Israel. Chris-
tians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Ameri-
cans of all faiths and others prayed for 
the Texas community and for those 
victims this past January. 
Our hearts go out to the families of 
this congregation that they had to en-
dure such an unjust evil that this ter-
rorist caused. Thank God they escaped. 
Today, we support the community of 
Colleyville, Texas. Today, we support 
Congregation Beth Israel. And today, 
we support the brave survivors of this 
heinous attack. 
We applaud the bravery of Congrega-
tion Beth Israel, the survivors, and our 
heroes in blue, Texas law enforcement. 
As patriotic freedom-loving Ameri-
cans, we condemn the evil and the 
darkness of anti-Semitism. And we will 
fight hate and bigotry and anti-Semi-
tism. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), chair of the Ap-
propriations Subcommittee on Mili-
tary Construction, Veterans Affairs 
and Related Agencies. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding and for bringing this resolu-
tion to the floor. 
I rise today in support of this bipar-
tisan resolution condemning the hor-
rific 
domestic 
terrorist 
attack 
in 
Colleyville, Texas. 
Saturday, January 15, 2022, was sup-
posed to be a day of rest and prayer for 
Jews across the world. Instead, it was a 
day of hate, fear, and violence. 
Four people walked into Congrega-
tion Beth Israel as worshipers, but they 
walked out as survivors. Their Jewish 
identity alone put them at risk of in-
herent danger. They were ordinary citi-
zens distinguished only by their faith. 
In 2022, this may seem unfathomable. 
Tragically, it is not. 
It is clear that the terrorist respon-
sible subscribed to anti-Semitic con-
spiracy theories and dangerous tropes. 
Due to the valiant efforts and skills 
of first responders and the bravery of 
these hostages, these worshipers made 
it out safely. 
While no one was physically hurt, the 
trauma leaves scars far deeper than 
any 
headline 
could 
convey. 
Those 
wounds and trauma are felt not only in 
Texas, but they reverberate all over 
this country in Jewish communities 
and Jewish sanctuaries all over the 
United States and the world. 
Generations of Jews have faced and 
continue to face bigotry, hate, and vio-
lence every day. Jews are attacked on 
public streets, assaulted, and our syna-
gogues are vandalized. 
Anti-Semitic literature has been dis-
tributed in neighborhoods in many 
parts of this country, including my 
community in South Florida. 
Anti-Semitism is rising at an alarm-
ing rate, and an astounding amount of 
it has become mainstream. 
One in four American Jews has been 
the target of anti-Semitism over the 
past year. Four in 10 have changed 
their behavior out of fear of anti-Semi-
tism. That includes people being afraid 
to wear a Star of David in public and 
men afraid to wear a kippah who would 
wear one normally in their everyday 
life. 
On a personal note, as the first Jew-
ish woman elected to Congress from 
Florida, my family and I know what it 
feels like to be the target of anti-Se-
mitic hate. 
To combat this scourge in our com-
munities, leaders throughout our coun-
try must clearly, firmly, and forcefully 
denounce the alarming rise in rampant 
hate, violence, and harassment tar-
geting Jewish Americans. 
Today’s resolution is an important 
condemnation of one act, but we must 
go further. It is time for this body to 
vote on a resolution that unambig-
uously and singularly denounces anti- 
Semitism. 
It should not take a domestic ter-
rorist attack for this body to do that. 
We need an unequivocal, bipartisan 
condemnation 
of 
anti-Semitism. 
Enough is enough. 
We must denounce the alarming rise 
in anti-Semitism in the United States 
and globally and issue a call for real 
action to combat it. 
Hatred and bigotry against one com-
munity are often only a symptom of a 
deeper problem affecting all ethnic, ra-
cial, and religious minorities. This res-
olution condemns a terrible incident, 
but we must condemn the underlying 
root cause of anti-Semitism. 
I thank Congresswoman VAN DUYNE, 
my good friend, for bringing today’s 
resolution to the floor. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentle-
woman from Florida an additional 1 
minute. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, we must increase the Non-
profit Security Grant program so it 
can continue its essential work of pro-
tecting Jewish and other faith-based 
institutions across the country. 
We 
must 
confirm 
Dr. 
Deborah 
Lipstadt as the State Department’s 
Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat 
Anti-Semitism to advance our efforts 
to combat discrimination against Jew-
ish people worldwide. 
We must denounce the alarming rise 
in anti-Semitism in the United States 
and globally and issue a call for real, 
concrete action. 
Resolutions are nice. Sentiment is 
helpful. But actions speak louder than

words, and we need to come together as 
a Congress to make sure that world-
wide it is known that the United 
States of America resolutely stands 
against anti-Semitism, not only for 
one instance but in all instances. 
Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my resolution con-
demning the anti-Semitic terrorist at-
tack in Colleyville earlier this year. 
And I thank my colleagues from Flor-
ida and New York for their kind words 
today. 
On January 15, we witnessed a hei-
nous attack, not only on our commu-
nity in north Texas, but on the entire 
Jewish community when a terrorist en-
tered the Congregation Beth Israel syn-
agogue and took four worshipers hos-
tage. 
It was disturbing to see such hate 
enter 
our 
peaceful 
community 
in 
Colleyville and threaten the lives of 
the worshipers who had welcomed this 
man with open arms. Many questions 
remain on how or why this act of evil 
occurred, but let’s appreciate our law 
enforcement for ultimately protecting 
the lives of those in harm’s way. Also, 
I thank Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker 
for his courageous actions that led to 
the safe escape of his fellow hostages in 
the Congregation Beth Israel syna-
gogue that day. 
I am grateful so many of my col-
leagues joined in support of this resolu-
tion condemning the terrorist attack 
and reaffirming our commitment to 
combat hate, bigotry, anti-Semitism, 
and violence against Jewish Ameri-
cans. Specifically, I thank Representa-
tive MARC VEASEY for his kindness and 
work in securing many bipartisan sup-
porters. 
H. Res. 881 clearly establishes our un-
equivocal support for the Colleyville 
community, the hostages, and all those 
affected by the terrorist act. It also 
commends the Federal, State, and 
local law enforcement and emergency 
responders who all pulled together for 
our community that day. 
This resolution will not only con-
demn this act of hate but bring light to 
the anti-Semitism plaguing our coun-
try. As you have heard from comments 
from my colleagues from New York and 
from Florida, Jewish Americans make 
up a disproportionate percentage of the 
antireligious crimes in America, and 
that must end. No American of any re-
ligion should experience fear in a house 
of worship. 
Thank you to all who joined me in 
this effort and made this the most sup-
ported piece of legislation in the 117th 
Congress. We look forward to seeing 
this pass on the House floor today, put-
ting aside our differences and uniting 
in the face of hatred. 
Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I am closing with a simple state-
ment. 
We must end terrorism and anti-Sem-
itism here in the United States. 
The violence suffered in Colleyville 
could 
have 
happened 
anywhere 
in 
America. 
Let’s take a minute to review some 
Jewish history. It literally began in 
that fateful year of 1492 when Euro-
peans arrived in the New World, and a 
number 
of 
Jews 
fought 
alongside 
George Washington in the American 
Revolution. 
And the first Jewish man to give his 
life for this country was also ironically 
the first Jew to be elected to public of-
fice in the Colonies: Francis Salvador. 
By 1840, the Jewish-American com-
munity was tiny, only 15,000 out of 17 
million, but it was strong and it was 
stable and it was prosperous. And with-
in a decade it had tripled. At the time 
of the Civil War, there were only 150,000 
Jews in America, but nearly 10 percent 
fought in the Civil War. 
During the 19th century, the repres-
sion and the old world of Jews in Eu-
rope just became too much for so 
many, and by 1924, two million Euro-
pean Jews had immigrated to the 
United States. 
Jewish Americans have woven a rich 
tapestry into the history of our Nation. 
Jonas Salk discovered the polio vac-
cine. How many lives did that one man 
save? 
Richard Feynman was an American 
physicist and was integral in formu-
lating quantum physics. 
What is even more remarkable is the 
percentage of Jews that have won 
Nobel Prizes. Twenty-two percent of all 
Nobel Prize winners had Jewish herit-
age, and 36 percent of American win-
ners had Jewish heritage. It is remark-
able. 
It is refreshing to be on the floor and 
have both sides agree, and there is 
power in that, and there is strength in 
that, and I urge this Congress and all 
Americans to join me in condemning 
these violent acts and the evil of anti- 
Semitism. We are a beautiful and won-
derful country, and we have to act like 
it. 
My heart goes out to the hostages 
and their families for undergoing this 
terrorist attack in the beautiful and 
wonderful community of Colleyville, 
Texas, who are fortunate enough to be 
represented by such a wonderful Mem-
ber of Congress in BETH VAN DUYNE. 
Our prayers are with the victims and 
their families. 
Mr. Speaker, it is great to be here on 
the floor with you today, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I call upon all of 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to support this important resolution, 
H. Res. 881, and to join me in con-
demning, in the strongest terms, the 
heinous attack on Congregation Beth 
Israel of Colleyville, Texas, on January 
15 of this year. 
Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism is a 
growing crisis, both in the United 
States and across the world, and we 
need to stand up together to denounce 
anti-Semitism and hate. This resolu-
tion does just that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of House Resolution 
881, which condemns the recent terrorist at-
tack on Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, 
Texas. 
And I want to thank my colleague from 
North Texas, Congresswoman VAN DUYNE, for 
introducing this legislation. 
Just two months ago, an armed and dan-
gerous terrorist entered the Congregation Beth 
Israel Synagogue and took Rabbi Charlie 
Cytron-Walker and three other members hos-
tage. An eleven-hour standoff ensued, but 
thanks to the leadership of Rabbi Cytron- 
Walker and the bravery of law enforcement on 
the ground, everyone was able to escape 
without physical harm. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, tragedies like 
this are becoming all too common. Jewish 
Americans make up about 2 percent of our 
country’s population, but hate crimes against 
them make up 55 percent of anti-religious hate 
crimes. 
Congress must do more, and we must do it 
urgently. That’s why I was proud to sign on to 
a letter to the House Appropriations Com-
mittee that supports funding for FEMA’s Non-
profit Security Grant Program. This program 
provides critical assistance to communities of 
faith in order to secure and shield their places 
of worship from attacks. 
But beyond any legislative action, we must 
also come together to condemn the hateful 
and divisive rhetoric that inspires these types 
of attacks. We all deserve the right to worship 
freely and safely, without fear of violence or 
retribution. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this resolution and, in doing so, reaf-
firm our deep and unwavering support for the 
Jewish community. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary and Homeland Security, the Tom Lantos 
Human Rights Commission, the bipartisan 
Congressional International Religious Freedom 
Caucus, and the Helsinki Commission, I rise in 
strong support of H. Res. 881, a resolution 
that puts the House on record in condemna-
tion of the heinous terrorist attack on Con-
gregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas on 
January 15, 2022 and against anti-Semitism 
wherever this hate rears its ugly head. 
On January 15, 2022, Malik Faisal Akram 
entered 
Congregation 
Beth 
Israel 
in 
Colleyville, Texas, taking four individuals hos-
tage. 
Britain’s counterintelligence and security 
agency, MI5, investigated Mr. Akram in 2020, 
and he was listed as a subject of interest, but 
was later determined to no longer pose a 
threat. 
Mr. Akram arrived at New York’s John F. 
Kennedy Airport on December 29, 2021, stay-
ing in New York City for two days until taking 
a flight to Dallas, Texas. 
Whereas it is reported Mr. Akram chose the 
synagogue because it appeared to be the 
closest gathering of Jewish people to a Fed-
eral prison where he demanded to see a 
woman who is in custody after being found 
guilty of two counts of attempted murder,

armed assault, using and carrying a firearm, 
and three counts of assault on United States 
officers and employees in Afghanistan. 
The four hostages were held for nearly 11 
hours, during that time Rabbi Charlie Cytron- 
Walker used the skills he learned by attending 
several security courses hosted by local law 
enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Se-
cure Community Network. 
Worshipers who were watching the service 
virtually contacted local law enforcement once 
they realized there was an incident underway 
at Congregation Beth Israel. 
Thankfully, because of the swift response 
from local, State, and Federal law enforce-
ment officers and emergency responders on 
the ground, no hostages were harmed during 
the hostage situation. 
Mr. Speaker, nearly thirty years ago, as a 
young mother, I first visited Israel and the Holy 
Land, and I have returned many times since 
then to the region that gave birth to three of 
the world’s great religions, civilizations, and 
cultures. 
I have been a passionate supporter of the 
Mickey Leland Kibbutzim Internship program, 
which for nearly thirty years has enabled 
inner-city high school students who live or 
study in the 18th Congressional District the 
opportunity to spend a summer in Israel. 
As a member of the Commission on Secu-
rity and Cooperation in Europe, better known 
as the U.S. Helsinki Commission, I have trav-
eled abroad on numerous occasions to partici-
pate in parliamentary diplomacy in support of 
OSCE and other European efforts to combat 
anti-Semitism, including legislation calling for 
increased security for the Jewish community, 
funds for civil society coalitions to combat 
hate, and a U.S.-EU Joint Action Plan to com-
bat prejudice and discrimination that would in-
clude a specific focus on anti-Semitism. 
Mr. Speaker, nearly 74 years have passed 
since the end of World War II but for those 
who survived, and the descendants and rel-
atives of those who perished, the Holocaust is 
not ancient history but a reminder of the evil 
that can be unleased when humans give into 
their worst instincts and appetites. 
The Holocaust is the worst example of 
man’s inhumanity to man in I human history 
and the magnitude of its destruction numbered 
more than 12 million deaths, including 6 mil-
lion Jews and 1.5 million children. 
A haunting quote in the United States Holo-
caust Memorial Museum refers to the story of 
Cain and Abel: 
The Lord said, ‘‘What have you done? Lis-
ten! Your brother’s blood cries out to me 
from the ground (Genesis 4:11). 
The Holocaust is a testament to the fragility 
of democracy, and it forces us to confront un-
comfortable questions such as the responsibil-
ities of citizenship and the consequences of 
indifference and inaction, and the importance 
of education and awareness. 
That is why we, all of us, must reject and 
resist prejudice and intolerance in any form. 
Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism is the name for 
the bigotry and form of racism endured for 
centuries by Jewish people for no other rea-
son that simply because they are Jews. 
According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 
2020 and 2021 there were a combined 8,366 
acts of extremism or hate crimes against Jews 
or Jewish institutions, constituting 55.1 percent 
of all religious-based hate crimes. 
There is an urgent need to ensure the safe-
ty and security of Jewish communities, includ-
ing synagogues, schools, cemeteries, and 
other institutions. 
Outside of the United States, Jews are the 
targets of anti-Semitic violence at even higher 
rates in many other countries. 
Anti-Semitism 
includes 
scapegoating 
or 
blaming Jews as Jews when things go wrong; 
calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or 
harming of Jews in the name of a radical ide-
ology or extremist view of religion; or making 
mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or 
stereotyped allegations about Jews. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to denounce and re-
ject 
forcefully 
and 
continuously 
the 
scapegoating and targeting of Jews in the 
United States that has persisted for many 
years, including by the Ku Klux Klan, the 
America First Committee, and by modern neo- 
Nazis, whose membership decidedly is not 
comprised of ‘‘very fine people.’’ 
Let us be very clear: these purveyors of 
hate will not win because as the Reverend 
Martin Luther King, Jr., taught; persecution of 
any American is an assault on the rights and 
freedoms of all Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism is wrong and 
based on a lie—as are racism, Islamophobia, 
sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia—but re-
member the words of William Cullen Bryant, 
who said: 
Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again; 
The eternal years of God are hers; 
But Error, wounded, writhes in pain, 
And dies among his worshippers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to 
vote for H. Res. 881 and I encourage every 
person in the United States to confront and re-
ject anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry 
and do all they can to ensure that the United 
States lives up to the transcendent principles 
of tolerance, religious freedom, and equal pro-
tection as embodied in the Declaration of 
Independence and the first and 14th amend-
ments to the Constitution that have made it 
the envy and the hope of the world. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution, H. Res. 881, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

AFTER RECESS

SHADOW WOLVES ENHANCEMENT 
ACT

curity Investigations tactical patrol 
unit operating on the lands of the

agents, and for other purposes, on 
which the yeas and nays were ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

BUILDING A BETTER AMERICA 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, 1 year ago this Friday, amid the 
darkest days of the pandemic, Presi-
dent Biden signed the American Rescue 
Plan into law. It got shots in arms and 
money in pockets. It helped families 
keep roofs over their heads and food on 
their tables. It helped schools reopen 
safely and kept small businesses afloat. 
The American Rescue Plan laid the 
foundation for last year’s unprece-
dented growth. More than 7 million 
jobs were created, the economy grew at 
the fastest rate in four decades and a 
record 5.4 million small businesses 
were started. 
We still have work to do to lower 
costs for families, but we are stronger 
this year than we were last year 
thanks to the American Rescue Plan, 
and we will be stronger next year than 
we are this year thanks to the bipar-
tisan infrastructure law. 
Equitable growth, more jobs, better 
infrastructure, that is what I call 
building a better America. 
BIDEN’S ENERGY CRISIS 
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to address President Biden’s 
attack on American energy independ-
ence. 
From day one, the Biden administra-
tion has opposed domestic energy pro-
duction in the Gulf of Mexico and on-
shore. The drastic reduction in domes-
tic energy production has made the 
U.S. even more reliant on foreign en-
ergy. 
Since President Biden took office, 
the U.S. has imported around 228 mil-
lion barrels of oil from Russia alone. 
That adds up to $17.5 billion in 2021 to 
help fuel Putin’s war on Ukraine and 
jeopardize our national security. 
Instead of increasing the amount of 
domestic energy production to help 
ease the high fuel price, the President 
is now looking to Venezuela and Iran 
to help supply the U.S. with even more 
foreign oil and gas. We cannot allow 
the United States to cut funding from 
one tyrant to hand it out to another. 
The United States has the world’s 
largest oil and gas reserves. We can 
produce energy resources more cleanly 
and efficiently than anywhere else in 
the world, and we should produce them. 
As a former offshore oil worker, and 
now a Member of Congress, an energy- 
independent United States is one of my 
top priorities in Congress. Our country 
must cut back its reliance on foreign 
oil. American oil, natural gas, or clean 
coal, the method is flexible, but the 
reason is not. We must increase our do-
mestic production of energy. Our na-
tional security depends on it. 
f 
REMEMBERING WAYNE PERKEY 
(Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Wayne Perkey, a Louisville broad-
casting legend, a man of immense com-
passion and charity, and my friend. He 
passed away this weekend after a hard- 
fought battle with COVID–19. 
A Tennessee native, Wayne landed at 
Louisville’s WHAS as a young deejay in 
1969, and he would ultimately grace our 
city’s airwaves for more than 30 years, 
hosting the radio station’s daily morn-
ing show and emceeing WHAS11 TV’s 
annual Crusade for Children charity 
event. 
Wayne’s skills as a broadcaster were 
only surpassed by the kindness he 
showed to his colleagues and fellow 
Louisvillians, his dedication to helping 
others, and his deep love for his family. 
Wayne’s passing is a loss for our city 
and Commonwealth, for all who re-
member starting their morning with 
that familiar cheerful voice, and for me 
personally. I am keeping the entire 
Perkey family in my thoughts and 
hope the fond memories we all have of 
Wayne are a source of strength for 
them. He truly was a treasure.

RESTORING AMERICAN ENERGY 
DOMINANCE 
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I 
am deeply concerned with the Biden 
administration’s efforts to look to 
other foreign adversaries for oil amid 
the current conflict in Eastern Europe. 
Last week, Secretary Buttigieg said 
the option to import oil from Iran is on 
the table. Over the weekend, the Biden 
administration sent a delegation to 
Venezuela to discuss resuming rela-
tions with dictator Maduro and is 
weighing options to import Venezuelan 
oil. 
Not once has the Biden administra-
tion considered the solution that is 
staring us right in the face: revital-
izing domestic energy production. 
The U.S. is blessed with the world’s 
largest oil and gas reserves, and we are 
fully capable of producing these re-
sources more cleanly and efficiently 
than anywhere else in the world. 
Before we turn to socialist nations or 
countries that openly chant ‘‘death to 
America’’ in the streets, we must har-
ness the potential in our own back-
yard. 
American energy means lower prices 
for consumers at home and greater en-
ergy security for us and our allies. 
The Biden administration needs to 
end their war on domestic energy pro-
duction immediately and restore our 
Nation’s energy dominance. 
f 
FREEDOM FOR ALL 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to support H. Con. Res. 70, Con-
demning Threats of Violence Against 
Historically Black Colleges and Uni-
versities. 
What an appalling, atrocious act to 
attack these historic colleges founded 
in the midst of the 19th century in the 
aftermath of slavery. 
On January 5, 2022, at least eight 
HBCUs received bomb threats; on Jan-
uary 31, 2022, at least six; and then on 
February 1, 2022, 18. We must not only 
denounce it; we must protect these 
young people and ensure their protec-
tion. 
I also rise in support of H. Res. 881, 
Condemning the Heinous Terrorist At-
tack on Congregation Beth Israel in 
Colleyville, Texas. 
We must denounce and reject force-
fully 
and 
continuously 
the 
scapegoating and targeting of Jews in 
the United States and, as well, ter-
rorism that subjects them to this kind 
of action.

Let’s continue to stand for the free-
dom of all. 
And I, as well, stand for the freedom 
of Ukrainian women and Ukraine. I 
support their freedom and bravery as 
they fled to protect their families, but 
yet, those who stood their ground and

f 
MAKING AMERICA ENERGY 
INDEPENDENT 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, as gas 
prices across the country continue to 
soar, and with President Biden’s an-
nouncement to ban Russian oil im-
ports, it is time that America looked 
to our own backyard to meet our en-
ergy needs. 
To ease the burden on hardworking 
Americans, we must increase domestic 
production to make America energy 
independent again. 
We can no longer allow Russia, Ven-
ezuela, or oil from the Middle East to 
meet our energy needs. The Biden ad-
ministration must commit to an Amer-
ica first strategy in oil production. 
America must increase production so 
that we are not only energy inde-
pendent but so that we can once again 
become a net exporter of oil and nat-
ural gas. 
We must drill America, refine Amer-
ica, and we must buy American oil. 
That is why I joined many of my Re-
publican colleagues in a letter to Presi-
dent Biden requesting the administra-
tion open Federal lands to energy pro-
duction, end unnecessary and burden-
some bureaucratic regulations, and ap-
prove and expedite construction of the 
Keystone XL pipeline. 
President Biden must commit to 
these actions immediately to ease the 
burden on Americans at the pump. 
f 
ENDING RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of ending Rus-
sian oil imports into our land. 
Liberty is the shining jewel in Amer-
ica’s 
crown. 
As 
Vladimir 
Putin 
unleashes his murderous fury on the 
people of Ukraine, we have a responsi-
bility to stand up for liberty’s defense, 
to inflict further pain on Putin and his 
war-related price hikes. 
Now is the time to recommit our-
selves to ensuring America’s energy 
independence for the 21st century. We 
must take a stand and invest in our 
workers and our companies as U.S. oil 
and gas production is approaching all- 
time highs. 
To Wall Street and the big corporate 
CEOs, now is the time to prioritize lib-
erty and the well-being of hardworking 
Americans and their families, not just 
corporate profits and shareholder divi-
dends. 
Let’s use this moment to develop a 
robust energy future to unleash across 
our land, across all energy tech-
nologies, our competitive edge. 
Russian oil is the past. American en-
ergy innovation, ingenuity, and U.S. 
energy independence are within our 
grasp. 
f 
PAIN AT THE PUMP 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to address 
Pennsylvanians’ pain at the pump. 
AAA reported Saturday that the av-
erage price for gas in Pennsylvania had 
reached $4.08 a gallon, an all-time high. 
Gas in Pennsylvania was $3.75 just a 
week ago and $3.60 a month ago. 
The most recent spike could be at-
tributed to the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine, but we know the cost of gas 
has continued to increase since Presi-
dent Biden’s inauguration. 
From day one, President Biden has 
stifled domestic energy production. His 
policies established new regulations 
governing methane emissions, over-
turned resolutions to reform EPA oil 
and gas rules, and halted new oil and 
gas leases on Federal lands and waters. 
These actions have resulted in energy 
poverty for many Americans across the 
United States. 
When this administration chose to 
shut down domestic energy production, 
it opened the United States and our al-
lies to energy instability and insecu-
rity. Instead of reversing course, Presi-
dent Biden is emboldening dictators 
around the world by relying on their 
energy reserves. 
A ban on Russian oil is a step in the 
right direction, but it is incomplete if 
we do not reopen the United States for 
domestic energy production.

FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–100) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BROWN of Ohio) laid before the House 
the following message from the Presi-
dent of the United States; which was 
read and, together with the accom-
panying papers, referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs and ordered 
to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 
301 of title 3, United States Code, I re-
port that I have issued an Executive 
Order finding that the Russian Federa-
tion’s 
unjustified, 
unprovoked, 
unyielding, and unconscionable war 
against Ukraine, including its recent 
further invasion in violation of inter-
national law, including the United Na-
tions Charter, further threatens the 
peace, stability, sovereignty, and terri-
torial integrity of Ukraine, and there-
by constitutes an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
As a result, I have prohibited the fol-
lowing: (i) the importation into the 
United States of the following products 
of Russian Federation origin: crude oil; 
petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and 
products of their distillation; liquefied 
natural gas; coal; and coal products; 
(ii) new investment in the energy sec-
tor in the Russian Federation by a 
United States person, wherever lo-
cated; and (iii) any approval, financing, 
facilitation, or guarantee by a United 
States person, wherever located, of a 
transaction by a foreign person where 
the transaction by that foreign person 
would be prohibited by this section if 
performed by a United States person or 
within the United States. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.

CALLING ATTENTION TO THE 
ENERGY CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. JOYCE) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, we are here tonight to call at-
tention to the energy crisis that is 
being felt both at home and abroad. 
This crisis has sent prices sky-
rocketing and has caused deep uncer-
tainty that leaves our businesses vul-
nerable and American families less se-
cure. 
Let’s be very blunt. This energy cri-
sis is a crisis that exists for two rea-
sons. The first reason is the recent rise 
in gas prices that has been caused by 
Vladimir Putin’s unlawful war against 
the people of Ukraine. The second rea-
son is President Biden’s long-term re-
fusal to support American energy pro-
ducers by canceling the Keystone XL 
pipeline and by stopping new drilling 
here at home. 
By threatening new and burdensome 
taxes on energy producers, the Biden 
administration has deliberately raised 
energy prices on all American families, 
all for the sake of appeasing radical en-
vironmentalists. 
As we stand here today, there are un-
tapped energy reserves under the feet 
of my constituents, and these can be 
used to address the crisis that we are 
talking about tonight. It is time to un-
leash that energy, and it is time to un-
leash American energy dominance. 
Americans can’t afford what is hap-
pening right now. Gas prices are up 
over 11 percent in just the last month, 
forcing families to make hard choices 
about what they can afford. 
Over the course of this Special Order, 
you will hear from many of my col-
leagues about the state of our energy 
industry. You will hear real solutions 
that can help lower costs while at the 
same time reinforcing our necessary 
national security. 
This is a time to talk about these 
real solutions. Right now, we have an 
incredible number of opportunities to 
help lower energy costs while driving 
innovation at the same time. Through 
American ingenuity, we can create 
millions of new family-sustaining jobs 
in our energy industry. 
It won’t be easy. It will take Con-
gress and the administration working 
alongside our energy industry to re-
form 
cumbersome 
regulations 
that 
limit our energy production. Now is 
the time to give our producers the 
tools that they need to develop new 
technologies to modernize the electric 
grid and our oil and natural gas infra-
structure and unlock new and exciting 
opportunities. 
I thank so many of my colleagues for 
joining me here tonight for this impor-
tant Special Order, and I yield to my 
colleague from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS). 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for orga-
nizing this evening’s Special Order 
hour. 
For months now, we have seen a 
steady rise in energy prices, high-
lighted by rising prices at the gas 
pump. The United States imports hun-
dreds of thousands of barrels of Rus-
sian oil every day, a slap in the face to 
workers and businesses across our 
country. 
Sanctioning Russia’s energy sector 
will cripple their economy and might 
be what it takes to end Russia’s illegal 
invasion of a sovereign nation. 
Today, the administration took a 
much-needed step and banned the im-
port of Russian oil and gas. To help 
counter a lack of oil from Russia, the 
administration is currently requesting 
that dictatorships like Venezuela and 
Iran increase their oil and gas output 
instead of unleashing domestic energy 
production. This is unconscionable. 
To support American workers and 
businesses, we should tap into the 
abundance of natural resources at 
home to counter high fuel costs, in-
cluding 
Iowa-made 
ethanol 
and 
biofuels. 
As a Presidential candidate in 2020, 
President Biden pledged to promote 
and advance renewable energy, eth-
anol, and other biofuels to help rural 
America. 
Ethanol helps to extend our fuel sup-
ply, and this can help alleviate price 
pressure at the pump while giving ac-
cess to American-made energy. 
If only the Midwest States switched 
from E10 to E15, it would easily replace 
all the barrels of oil that we will no 
longer 
be 
importing 
from 
Russia. 
American ethanol producers have well 
over 2 billion gallons of unutilized pro-
duction capacity and are standing 
ready to play a larger role in our en-
ergy sector. 
We should continue to also grow our 
energy export network with our Euro-
pean allies and our NATO partners to 
help them wean off Russian energy. 
Biofuels, nuclear, oil, natural gas, 
hydro, and electric can all be part of 
our energy diplomacy and weaken Rus-
sia’s influence in Europe. 
We must take an all-of-the-above ap-
proach to our domestic energy policy, 
especially in the face of Russian ag-
gression. 
I will continue to fight to ensure that 
our energy sector continues to use oil 
and gas and American-made energy to 
end our dependence on Russia and 
other adversaries, diversify our energy 
usage, become more environmentally 
friendly, and create good-paying jobs 
here at home. 
b 2000 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, America is hurting, 
with painfully high gas prices, rampant 
inflation for everyday goods, from gro-
ceries to clothing, and it looks like it 
is going to get much worse before it 
gets better. 
How did we get here? Well, some say 
it was the pandemic, others say it is 
the war in Ukraine. Well, what if I told 
you this has been going on for quite a 
long time? 
In 2017, Republicans in Congress 
started an investigation into Russian 
interference. No, not that Russian in-
terference, but real interference into 
the debate over American energy. 
Let me explain. The Biden adminis-
tration is right now trying to distance 
itself from their anti-coal, anti-oil and 
gas actions and policies. Their war on 
affordable, reliable energy, blocking 
pipelines, slowing permits, and pro-
moting an ill-advised rush to green. 
You see, Europe tried this already, 
walking headlong into dangerous en-
ergy dependence on Russia. The results 
of that are now clearly evident. We see 
it playing out in the horror unfolding 
in Ukraine. 
Europe could have taken a path of 
self-reliance if it wasn’t for their poli-
ticians caving to radical activists to 
rush renewables and cutting off their 
own reliable energy resources like nu-
clear, oil, gas, and coal. 
France banned fracking in 2011; Bul-
garia in 2012; the Netherlands in 2015; 
Germany in 2017; the U.K. in 2019. All 
the while becoming more dependent on 
Putin’s Russia for reliable energy. 
Well, what if I told you that Russia 
sent at least $95 million to radical 
green groups in Europe who helped 
achieve these goals? 
The investigation I mentioned earlier 
conducted 
by 
the 
Republican-led 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee, uncovered evidence that Russia 
may have done and is continuing to do 
the same thing right here in America. 
It is time to reopen that investiga-
tion. I sent a letter today to the rel-
evant committee chairs to do just that. 
Throttling back our own American 
energy resources is exactly what Vladi-
mir Putin would want us to do. 
To borrow a term from the Cold War, 
Madam Speaker, let’s not be fellow 
travelers with the green agenda. Let’s 
reopen that investigation into poten-
tially real Russian interference. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend and colleague 
from Pennsylvania for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1360 
March 8, 2022 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration is breaking all the wrong 
records. Just this week, oil prices 
surged to a 14-year high, and gas prices 
topped $4 a gallon nationwide, hitting 
an all-time high. 
Americans are spending more to heat 
their homes, put gas in their cars, and 
to run their businesses. 
Yet, 
the 
Biden 
administration 
through all of this has refused to get 
behind American oil and natural gas 
producers. Instead, we are back to the 
days of begging OPEC and adversarial 
nations for oil. 
America’s 
energy 
needs 
can 
be 
achieved right here at home; a cleaner, 
more affordable option than importing 
it from Russia or other nations who 
don’t have our best interests in mind. 
President Biden is so fixated on dis-
mantling American energy independ-
ence and imposing a radical Green New 
Deal that he has lost sight of what is 
best for the American people. 
This administration’s continued as-
sault on American energy must end. 
There is only one path that leads to 
lower energy costs and a stronger fu-
ture for America. That path is Amer-
ican energy independence and domi-
nance. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for 
hosting this Special Order tonight. 
The price of gas has been rising for 
the last 14 months. Yes, we are experi-
encing some added pressure thanks to 
Putin’s evil attack on Ukraine, but our 
energy problems go much farther back 
than that. 
They started on the very day that 
President Biden was inaugurated as 
President. When he left the inaugura-
tion, 
President 
Biden 
immediately 
signed 
multiple 
executive 
orders 
handcuffing domestic oil production. 
He proudly told supporters on the cam-
paign trail that his goal was to end fos-
sil fuels entirely. 
Now, he is saying that his adminis-
tration and his rhetoric have no impact 
on the energy crisis. I call B.S. on that. 
He is intentionally destroying tradi-
tional energy while begging the world’s 
worst actors to make up for it. 
We simply cannot rely on foreign dic-
tators for oil that we can produce here 
in America. An energy dominant U.S. 
helps not only our people, but our al-
lies around the world. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Pennsylvania for his 
leadership on this issue. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration’s war on domestic energy ex-
tends beyond canceling pipelines and 
infrastructure, suspending oil and nat-
ural gas leasing on Federal lands and 
waters, or opposing funding of con-
struction of projects that could lower 
the cost of gas, diesel, or energy-de-
rived fossil fuels and slow-walking 
liquified natural gas exports that could 
reduce Europe’s dependence on Russia. 
No, in fact, what most Americans do 
not understand is that the central fea-
ture of President Biden’s anti-energy 
agenda is the weaponization of finan-
cial regulation to choke off capital to 
heroic American energy companies. 
And this agenda has been enabled by 
woke corporate leaders who have ele-
vated a political ESG agenda ahead of 
returns for retail investors. 
And we knew that the ESG agenda, 
the environmental social governance 
agenda, 
was 
prioritizing 
climate 
alarmism over and ahead of investor 
returns, over and ahead of affordable 
reliable energy. 
But now as we see how Russia is 
using oil and gas exports to finance 
their illegal and brutal war against 
Ukraine, Americans can now see how 
the ESG agenda is compromising both 
American energy dominance and our 
national security. 
The job of bank regulators is to en-
sure the safety and soundness of finan-
cial institutions and to promote finan-
cial stability. It is not to pick winners 
and losers in the credit markets or po-
liticize the allocation of capital or 
solve climate change. 
The central irony of the Biden ad-
ministration’s climate finance agenda 
is that it will neither promote finan-
cial stability nor help the environ-
ment. 
On the contrary, it will actually de-
stabilize the economy by destroying 
jobs, driving up energy costs, and se-
verely reducing the reliability of our 
electric power grid. 
It will also compromise efforts to 
combat climate change by starving in-
novative energy companies of the cap-
ital that they need to develop new 
technologies and processes to capture 
carbon, discover alternative uses for 
fossil fuels, harness the carbon cycle, 
and reduce emissions. 
Biden’s regulators say they want to 
assess how climate change may create 
risks to the financial system. But let’s 
be honest. Biden has pledged a whole- 
of-government approach to ending sup-
port for fossil fuels. This is not about 
assessing risks for the financial sys-
tem; it is about creating risks for our 
economy. It is about redirecting cap-
ital away from fossil energy and 
weaponizing regulations to discrimi-
nate against the most reliable, afford-
able energy we have. 
The Federal Government should not 
be in the business of punishing heroic 
American energy companies, especially 
in a time of a national security crisis. 
Unleash the power of the American 
innovative energy sector, not only to 
lower costs here at home, to restore 
American energy dominance, but to de-
fend our allies in Europe to defend free 
people all over the country and to get 
rid of our overdependence on sources of 
energy from enemies of the United 
States. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
comments, and I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my neighbor in Pennsylvania for 
hosting this Special Order this evening. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to dis-
cuss the importance of restoring Amer-
ican energy independence to combat 
skyrocketing 
prices 
at 
the 
pump, 
which just yesterday soared past all- 
time highs. 
Last month, President Biden pledged 
to use every tool at our disposal to 
limit the effects of rising gas prices on 
American consumers and bolster en-
ergy supplies to our European allies. 
Sadly, this commitment and the ac-
tions of this administration remain 
grossly misaligned. 
Examples of these destructive deci-
sions include: canceling the Keystone 
XL pipeline; halting new leases on Fed-
eral lands; greenlighting Russia’s Nord 
Stream 2 project, while weakening our 
energy infrastructure here at home; 
begging OPEC to boost output and tap-
ping 
into 
our 
Nation’s 
emergency 
stockpile, all while refusing to take 
steps to boost domestic production; 
and proposing new punitive taxes and 
fees on producers. 
Recently, the administration sig-
naled its desire to increase imports 
from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to 
offset the ban on Russian energy. Stop-
ping the flow of energy from one au-
thoritarian regime while opening the 
door to others does not strengthen 
America’s energy security. 
We must recommit the United States 
to energy independence. We must end 
the war against America’s energy pro-
ducers. And we must protect our en-
ergy infrastructure. 
I join my colleagues in calling on the 
Biden administration to reverse course 
on the failed policies that are driving 
up costs for consumers, weakening 
America’s energy security, and empow-
ering our adversaries. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, Dr. JOYCE, from 
the great State of Pennsylvania and 
the HEAT Team for providing this op-
portunity for a Special Order because 
the American people need to know. 
They need to know that for months 
the Biden administration has been 
using the excuse that global markets 
are complex and there are dynamics 
out of our control that have led to the 
highest average gas prices since 2008 
and spiking oil prices around the 
world. 
This, I want you to know, is disingen-
uous at best, and the reality is simply 
not true. 
As my colleagues in the Congres-
sional Western Caucus and the House 
Energy Action Team have been saying, 
we have the ability to achieve our own 
secure energy future. In fact, we 
achieved just that, that energy inde-
pendence, just a few short years ago. 
But with this President and his admin-
istration at the helm, we have thrown 
that energy security out the window.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1361 
March 8, 2022 
Don’t believe the President’s revi-
sionist history of blaming Vladimir 
Putin for high gas prices. 
You can be sure the cancellation of 
the Keystone XL pipeline, the morato-
rium on oil and gas leasing on Federal 
lands, the lack of action on the off-
shore leasing program, and the com-
mitment by this President and his ad-
ministration to make American energy 
producers obsolete in just a few short 
years, yes, all of those are reasons to 
hold this President responsible for the 
burden now placed on the American 
people. 
These rising prices started long be-
fore this conflict, and we will continue 
to hold this administration account-
able for the burden they have placed on 
the American people. 
Again, Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. 
JOYCE; the American people need to 
hear this. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN). 
MR. BERGMAN: Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
A lot of us were here on the House 
floor just a few months ago high-
lighting the problems with the Biden 
administration’s energy policies. We 
were here. We are back again. 
Being here again, we are saying the 
same things, only maybe a little far-
ther down the road facing another self- 
inflicted completely avoidable crisis. 
From day one, President Biden has 
put America last when it comes to our 
energy needs. And Americans are pay-
ing for it, quite literally. 
While gas prices are up all over the 
country, in my district we are seeing 
some of the highest prices in the entire 
State of Michigan. 
And let’s be clear, the administra-
tion’s approach to energy has been a 
problem long before Russia invaded 
Ukraine. Gas prices have been going up 
for months in response to heavy infla-
tion brought about from out-of-control 
spending. 
House Republicans have been sound-
ing the alarm on the national security 
implications of our energy dependence 
and the problem with relying on na-
tions like Russia for our energy needs. 
But those legitimate concerns have 
largely been ignored. And now we are 
seeing the consequences of this admin-
istration’s policies. 
So where is America supposed to turn 
for oil and gas? Instead of promoting 
our domestic energy industry and 
working to make us more independent, 
the administration is looking to na-
tions like Iran and Venezuela. 
How can President Biden think it is a 
good idea to go from one bad actor to 
another in search of a solution to this 
self-induced energy crisis? 
The only way to solve our energy cri-
sis while ensuring our national secu-
rity is to break the chains this admin-
istration has put on our energy pro-
ducers. It is way past time. Let’s break 
those chains now. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for the time. 
b 2015 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
insight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
was leaving here when I met some of 
your family members on swearing-in 
day, and I know there is probably some 
proud chests stuck out and buttons 
busting everywhere, as my granddad 
used to say. So we welcome you in this 
new role. 
Madam Speaker, Biden’s woke envi-
ronmental agenda is forcing many of 
my fellow East Tennesseans to pay 
more to heat their homes and to com-
mute to work. How have these high en-
ergy prices increased in Tennessee over 
the last year, you may ask? 
Gasoline costs $3.96 per gallon, a 35 
percent increase—not as much as Cali-
fornia, but that is, hopefully, never 
within our range. 
Residential natural gas costs $12.40 
per thousand cubic feet, a 23 percent 
increase. This is just working folks 
trying to heat their homes. 
Electricity costs $10.27 per kilowatt 
hour; that is a 9 percent increase. 
Madam Speaker, these higher energy 
costs are an additional expense for our 
businesses, too, and they are just going 
to pass it on to us. That means that 
businesses must raise all their prices to 
offset the increased energy rates. That 
is why this inflation is crippling our 
economy under President Biden. 
Some of these arrogant folks suggest 
Americans work from home or ‘‘go 
green’’ to offset rising energy costs. 
Well, that disgusts me. That is an all- 
time arrogant low for some of these 
folks. They must assume that all my 
constituents have a job that allows 
them to work from home or can afford 
an electric car or solar panels. 
Madam Speaker, I have spent many 
an hour in factories around my dis-
trict, and those folks cannot work from 
home, and this country would fall off 
the edges of the Earth if we did that. 
And there is a reason that oil and nat-
ural gas and coal are preferred energy 
sources. They are cheap and they are 
reliable, and we get them from home-
grown energy. 
Now, how do we fix this energy mess? 
We return to energy independence, of 
course. It has been said many times, 
let’s roll back some of these environ-
mental regulations. Let’s turn the 
spigots back on and let’s lower the en-
ergy costs for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. JOYCE 
for his more-than-lackluster attempt 
at righting a horrible wrong, and I ap-
preciate his leadership. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman and 
appreciate his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN), my 
colleague and friend from the Doctor’s 
Caucus. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague, the gentleman and good 
doctor from Pennsylvania for this ini-
tiative tonight, this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, amidst Russia’s on-
going invasion of Ukraine and histori-
cally high gas prices here at home, I 
have got a radical idea for President 
Joe Biden; how about you ask Amer-
ican workers to produce American en-
ergy sourced right here in America? 
I know that is a radical idea for you, 
but this would increase American jobs, 
strengthen America’s economy, and 
lower grocery and gas prices for all 
Americans. Not to mention, we would 
be producing some of the cleanest oil 
and gas in the world today. 
So how do I tell my constituents the 
truth? The truth is this: The Biden ad-
ministration would rather invest in 
foreign energy and make us more reli-
ant on hostile nations and war crimi-
nals than to bring domestic production 
here in America back up to par. 
Let me repeat that. Instead of sup-
porting American ingenuity and afford-
able energy, the left wants your tax 
dollars to line the pockets of tyrants in 
Communist countries like Iran and 
Venezuela, who hate America and ev-
erything that we stand for. This kind 
of stupidity is hard to comprehend. 
Tonight, I am calling on President 
Joe Biden to put what is best for Amer-
ica first for once, and immediately un-
leash American energy. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG), 
my colleague and friend. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, today, Michigan’s 
average fuel prices are mere cents 
away from the all-time high in the 
Motor State—not seen since the middle 
of the Great Recession. On Thursday, 
Triple A (AAA) data showed that 
Michigan had seen the highest State- 
wide average increase over the last 
week of any State in the Union. 
Today, a gallon of regular unleaded 
gas costs 61 cents more than it did just 
one week prior. Diesel, which helps fuel 
our State’s thriving agricultural indus-
try, has increased even more. 
Since this time last year, the cost of 
diesel is up 58 percent. In 2022, the price 
of natural gas is expected to reach an 
8-year high. Not only does this increase 
families’ costs to heat their homes, but 
it also further raises the already-in-
flated price of essential fertilizers that 
help grow Michigan crops. 
Clearly, President Biden’s war on 
American energy independence has cre-
ated an energy crisis and made us more 
dependent on adversaries like Vladimir 
Putin, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Ven-
ezuela. The crisis continues to hit our 
homes, our farms, and our businesses, 
and it grows in severity week after 
week. 
Recently, I sat down with some farm-
ers in my home State. They lamented 
how the rising prices of energy and 
overall production costs is hurting

their livelihoods and trickling down to 
Michigan consumers. The data shows 
the same U.S. farm income is expected 
to drop 8 percent this year, all while 
prices at the supermarket reach his-
toric highs. If we don’t unleash Amer-
ican energy, this cost will continue to 
reverberate in our agricultural indus-
try and at Michiganders’ kitchen ta-
bles for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I implore the Biden 
administration to take the necessary 
steps to increase our energy production 
at home. We have the capacity, we 
have the drive, we have the capability 
and tools to do so—for the sake of con-
sumers in Michigan and around the 
world. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Michigan. 
Madam Speaker, one issue that needs 
to be addressed tonight is how the ris-
ing cost of gas disproportionately af-
fects rural Americans who drive longer 
miles to get to work, to get to the gro-
cery store, even to get to their kids’ 
schools. 
Today, the average cost for a gallon 
of gas in Pennsylvania is $4.23 a gallon. 
And now it is estimated that the aver-
age family will pay an extra $1,300 for 
gas this year alone. It is unaffordable. 
And it is time to unleash American oil 
drilling to help bring the prices down 
and once again establish American en-
ergy dominance. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES), 
my friend. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, look at what is happening 
right now. We are dependent upon for-
eign sources of energy from volatile 
places around the world. We are bring-
ing in energy from African nations. We 
have recently brought in energy from 
Venezuela, from Russia, from Iraq. 
Madam Speaker, we have these re-
sources in the United States. The 
President stood in this very room and 
talked about buying American. Why 
can’t we buy our own American en-
ergy? 
Tonight and tomorrow, we are going 
to be talking about banning Russian 
oil. Well, I welcome folks to this dis-
cussion. We have been trying to do this 
for 
years. 
And 
unfortunately, 
my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
have opposed our efforts, have opposed 
efforts to ban Russian oil. 
You can look at history. Whenever 
you stop producing in the United 
States, it doesn’t change demand. All 
it does is it causes you to get the en-
ergy from somewhere else. This is af-
fecting people all across America. 
As a result of President Biden’s 
strategies, as a result of Democrats im-
peding good policy, we are now to a 
point where we have the highest gaso-
line prices in American history. We 
watched under President Biden where 
we nearly tripled our dependence upon 
Russian crude oil—nearly tripled it. 
Madam Speaker, it has greater emis-
sions. 
They 
have 
greater 
environ-
mental impacts. And again, why can’t 
we buy America’s resources? These are 
flawed energy strategies that are im-
pacting those people the most that can 
least afford it. 
‘‘Buying American,’’ we support that 
term. We support American energy. We 
support putting Americans back to 
work. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES), my 
colleague and friend. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for hosting this Special 
Order. 
Madam Speaker, for the past year, 
we have seen policies from the Biden 
administration devastate families and 
small businesses across the country. 
Moms in my district, like Meghan, 
have seen the cost of filling up their 
tanks and heating their homes con-
tinue to climb. 
The average American family will 
spend an extra $1,300 in gas this year. 
And Biden’s Green New Deal energy 
policies have left us weak abroad and 
crushed us economically at home. The 
national average for a gallon of gaso-
line is now $4.17—the highest ever on 
record. There is nothing to stop that 
number from going even higher as we 
head into the summer. 
But the prices at the pump today are 
not the result of just the recent events 
in Eastern Europe. If we look at gas 
prices on January 21, 2021, just one day 
after President Biden took office, the 
national average was $2.40. 
One year later, on January 20, 2022— 
before 
Putin 
ruthlessly 
invaded 
Ukraine—the national average was al-
ready $3.33. President Biden and the 
Congressional Democrats are solely re-
sponsible for the year-over-year in-
crease. And the anti-American energy 
agenda prevented the United States 
from maintaining our energy independ-
ence at a critical moment in history. 
That is why it is so important that 
we have good, permanent policies in 
place that encourage production here 
at home, keeping our prices low for 
American families and small busi-
nesses, and ensure that we maintain 
stability when bad actors disrupt the 
world. 
We should buy American first. We 
should buy American oil first. When 
the United States isn’t reliant on for-
eign oil, we can better address the 
global threats of tyrants and dictators. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
it 
is 
time 
we 
prioritize American energy production 
again that will put American families 
first and keep our country safe. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Kansas. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER), the energy-rich Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my very good friend, Dr. JOHN 
JOYCE from Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, we are witnessing 
horrible brutality by Vladimir Putin. 
He is killing civilians and committing 
war crimes while Zelensky has ordered 
his troops to ‘‘not cross the line be-
tween humanity and animals.’’ 
Zelensky requested aircraft, military 
supplies, and for credit card processing 
to be cut off. Mastercard and Visa 
stepped up and cut off their services 
the day that he asked, on Saturday. 
And I hope the aircraft is on its way, as 
was planned. He also asked for the U.S. 
to impose an embargo on Russian oil. 
Finally, the Biden administration is 
taking this important step. 
Madam Speaker, 14 months ago, this 
would have been a simple ask as we, 
the United States, were in fact energy 
independent. Because of the Biden ad-
ministration’s reckless anti-domestic 
fuel energy policies, it is far more com-
plicated. At a time when we should be 
ramping up domestic production, the 
Biden administration is sending offi-
cials to Venezuela and Iran in a des-
perate attempt to buy oil from these 
rogue nations. 
The historic gas prices we are all fac-
ing are a direct result of the Biden ad-
ministration’s foolish domestic energy 
policy. Producing oil and gas here at 
home doesn’t just keep prices low but 
serves as a strategic global advantage. 
Madam Speaker, regarding Ukraine, 
we must lay out our own terms to 
Putin: Get out of Ukraine or be subject 
to war crimes and every crippling sanc-
tion imaginable, as well as to fortify 
the Ukrainians. 
This war is about tyranny versus 
freedom, oppression versus liberty, to-
talitarianism versus democracy, and 
injustice versus justice. The rest of the 
world is watching. This is a pivotal mo-
ment. Glory to Ukraine. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 
his remarks. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
right 
now, 
our 
thoughts and prayers are with the peo-
ple of Ukraine and their fight against 
Putin’s unlawful war. Refusing to buy 
Russian oil will go a long way towards 
showing Putin and his corrupt Russian 
oligarchs that they will pay a steep 
price for this war. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the State of Minnesota 
(Mr. 
STAUBER), 
my 
colleague 
and 
friend. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Dr. Joyce for holding this Spe-
cial Order. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to dis-
cuss how high energy prices due to 
choices made by Joe Biden and his ad-
ministration are placing an undue bur-
den on Americans and how it doesn’t 
have to be this way. 
On his very first day in office, Presi-
dent Biden made a conscious choice to 
declare war on American energy.

be this way. One year later it is clear 
to every American that canceling the 
Keystone XL pipeline and halting 
leases on Federal lands were dev-
astating for the American people. 
Today, gas prices nationwide are 
averaging over $4 a gallon. Instead of 
ending hostility to American energy, 
Joe Biden is choosing foreign energy 
sources to lower prices in America. 
Folks, there is a better way. We need 
to return to American energy inde-
pendence. Our blue-collar, middle-class 
workers are ready, willing, and able to 
help us achieve this. 
America should never rely on foreign 
nations for our energy security, and we 
can be the source for our allies instead 
of reliance on adversarial nations like 
Russia. One way to speed up our return 
to energy dominance is to enact mean-
ingful permitting reform to remove red 
tape and duplicative processes to speed 
up domestic production. 
Do not buy the press secretary’s rhet-
oric. Even if a company has a lease, the 
administration slow-walks every right- 
of-way, every approval, and every per-
mit. From an administration that 
claims to care about Tribal consulta-
tion, they sure disregarded an indige-
nous voice in Mayor Harry Brower and 
the North Slope Borough when it 
comes to the Willow Project in Alaska. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the adminis-
tration and my colleagues across the 
aisle to join us on permitting reform. 
Energy security is national security. 
The war in Ukraine has made this 
clearer than ever before. We cannot 
wait any longer to return to American 
energy dominance. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
excellent remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CLOUD), my 
colleague and friend. 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I am 
here to let you know that the people of 
Texas stand ready. I represent the 27th 
District of Texas which includes a 
number of ports including the Port of 
Corpus Christi, our Nation’s number 
one energy export port. 
Texans stand ready to help American 
families struggling with inflation, in-
cluding high gas prices. We stand ready 
to help ensure that Europe is not be-
holden to tyrants for their energy sup-
ply. We stand ready to help restore our 
economy and support the energy by-
products like fertilizer, pesticides, and 
even tractor tires that help produce 
our food supply. 
How insulting and arrogant it is for 
the American worker that the Biden 
administration would rather go to dic-
tators to fill the energy vacuum than 
the American people, in spite of the 
fact 
that 
the 
American 
workers 
produce energy much more clean and 
responsibly than these other nations. 
To the casual observer this may seem 
like a tragic miscalculation. In 2017, as 
Vice President Biden said, ironically, 
in a speech he gave in the Ukraine, he 
said this: We are trying to create a 
multipolar world. In other words, he 
envisioned a world where the United 
States was not the premiere influence 
in the world. Well, tragically, that is 
the world we see forming before us day- 
by-day in the news. 
Madam Speaker, I have no idea what 
the carbon footprint of a missile going 
into a Ukrainian’s home is, but I do 
know that the human toll is tragic, 
and that it is the result in part of ac-
ceding American energy dominance. 
We must stop in this Nation selling 
away generations of progress made by 
American workers and innovators and 
restore American energy dominance. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE), 
my friend and colleague. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, the anti-energy policies of the 
Biden administration have targeted oil 
and gas production and eliminated 
American energy independence. Since 
day one, the Biden administration has 
embarked on an agenda of regulatory 
overreach. 
Something you might have heard 
from the White House press secretary 
recently is that there are 9,000 un-
tapped drilling permits that companies 
are not using. While this is in part 
true, they are being dishonest and pur-
posefully leaving out crucial context 
and factors that cause companies to 
wait to drill those wells. 
For starters, many of the wells pro-
duced predominantly natural gas, not 
oil. In addition, drilling can’t begin 
overnight as leases can take months or 
years before companies actively drill. 
Furthermore, the Federal permit to 
drill is not the only government ap-
proval 
required. 
Rights-of-way 
can 
take years to acquire before companies 
can access leases. Most companies can-
not drill before pipelines are in place, 
and the delayed approvals have re-
sulted in companies developing drilling 
access at much slower rates. 
This administration is taking up to 
three times the amount of time to ap-
prove Federal permits than the Trump 
administration, and that is if they ap-
prove them at all. The American peo-
ple are tired of the Democrats’ blame- 
shifting while they ignore the real 
causes of crushing gas prices. 
We must unleash American energy 
and lower gas prices domestically. In 
addition, restoring American produc-
tion will remove Putin’s control of the 
energy market and end his leverage 
over Europe. 
To solve the crisis, President Biden 
must immediately end the Federal 
freeze on all new oil and gas projects, 
fast-track pending LNG export per-
mits, expedite approval of all pipeline 
and energy development, and stop the 
regulatory assault on American energy 
development and financing. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JACOBS), 
my colleague and friend. 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative JOYCE 
for holding this very important event 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the millions of Americans who are fac-
ing pain at the pump and around the 
Nation. On his first day in office, Presi-
dent Biden signaled to the world that 
American energy independence was no 
longer a priority. He canceled the Key-
stone XL pipeline on day one. He made 
regulatory changes to make new do-
mestic production incredibly punitive. 
He put a moratorium on all new drill-
ing on Federal lands. 
The President’s actions set the high 
prices we are seeing today in motion. 
Long before Russia invaded Ukraine, 
Americans were getting squeezed by 
the inflationary tax caused by careless 
and unrealistic policymaking. In fact, 
the national average for a gallon of 
gasoline had risen over a dollar in the 
year before Russia took this malign ac-
tion. 
International events have sent prices 
higher in the past week, but the admin-
istration cannot hide from the fact 
that their policies have amplified this 
financial crisis. The solution to this 
crisis is clear—American production 
and energy independence are the best 
protections we have at our disposal. 
The 
President 
must 
reverse 
the 
course of his administration imme-
diately and allow the full force of the 
U.S. energy industry to be unleashed in 
Americans’ time of need. 
Banning Russian oil imports out of 
principle is one thing, but it rings of 
hypocrisy when the administration 
turns around and immediately begins 
negotiating with vile dictators in Iran 
and Venezuela. The solution is no bet-
ter there, and simply expands our de-
pendence on hostile foreign nations for 
our economic and national security. 
Madam Speaker, perhaps the admin-
istration does not want to admit their 
early anti-energy moves were wrong, 
but American energy and financial se-
curity cannot hinge on the egos of the 
President and his staff. 
It is time to get out of the way of 
American production, allow our pro-
ducers to increase capacity, and deliver 
affordable energy to the American peo-
ple free from malign influence. Our fu-
ture prosperity and national security 
depends on it. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
New York. One thing is abundantly 
clear from the speakers tonight, there 
is a growing need to utilize American 
innovation. Americans and our know- 
how have always stepped up and bend 
the individuals who can get us through 
crises. 
Yet, we are not utilizing the re-
sources that are under the feet of 
Americans. American ingenuity is the 
answer. American businesses have al-
ready cut our energy emissions by

more than any other country over the 
past 20 years. We were able to do this 
because of new and innovative tech-
nologies that our American businesses 
produced. 
The answer is clear: we need to bring 
more American technologies to market 
as soon as possible. That message has 
been 
reiterated 
by 
my 
colleagues 
throughout tonight’s Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA), 
my colleague and friend. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
am still trying to figure out what the 
priorities of this Biden administration 
are. When you look at the different 
world events going on—when John 
Kerry comes out and says: Oh, we hope 
this Ukraine intervention does not 
interfere with the progress the U.S. is 
making with Mr. Putin on climate 
change—you wonder what are the pri-
orities? 
Indeed, I would have to remind you 
that if CO2 is a priority of this adminis-
tration, the carbon dioxide in the at-
mosphere, it represents only .04 per-
cent of our atmosphere. You see all the 
other gases in our atmosphere are rep-
resented by much larger percentages. 
If indeed John Kerry and this admin-
istration’s big priority is CO2, what are 
they doing to help remedy that for the 
energy this country needs? Well, my 
home State of California it shutting 
down both nuclear power plants that 
we had at one time in the State, Santa 
Onofre first and Diablo Canyon coming 
up pretty soon. 
It is tearing up hydroelectric dams, 
like up in my district, on the Klamath 
River; both of those provide CO2-free 
electricity, if CO2 indeed is the big pri-
ority. No, it is something else. It is 
some other agenda. They are not doing 
much to help. If we had more nuclear 
power plants in this country, we 
wouldn’t have the fuel for them. 
We produce only 9,000 pounds of ura-
nium, yet our needs in this country for 
our power plants, military ships, and 
even medical is about 45 million 
pounds. That is 9,000 versus 45 million. 
It doesn’t seem to be the priority of 
this administration to have America’s 
needs, the people of this country’s 
needs, our energy independence when 
you look at just the production of elec-
tricity, let alone oil and gas, which are 
so critical for everyday needs for ev-
eryday Americans. 
We need to really focus on what this 
country needs and we need to help 
steer this administration into that 
focus instead of the fruitless direction 
we are going. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
excellent remarks. I would like to 
thank all the Members who have been 
here tonight. When I proposed holding 
this Special Order, we received an over-
whelming response. Perhaps that is ex-
emplified by the number of Members 
who stayed late into the evening to dis-
cuss the energy crisis that right now is 
affecting every American. 
This truly shows the commitment 
that congressional Republicans have to 
working to revitalize American energy 
dominance. It is a testament to how 
important this issue is. We truly have 
been able to discuss the issues that 
have dreadful effects on so many Amer-
ican families right now, this evening. 
This energy crisis that President Biden 
created is impactful tonight, tomor-
row, and until we use American inno-
vation to respond correctly. 
Madam Speaker, what we have shown 
here tonight is a road map back to 
American energy dominance. 
It is a plan to increase innovation. It 
is a plan to rebuild our energy grid. It 
is a plan to cut harmful regulations 
and a plan to ensure that the American 
people have safe, reliable, and afford-
able energy. 
So, once again, Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues for their remarks, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

NO 
FLOWERS 
FOR 
UKRAINIAN 
WOMEN 
ON 
INTERNATIONAL 
WOMEN’S DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. SPEIER) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I am 
grateful for the opportunity tonight for 
a Special Order on this International 
Women’s Day. 
There are a lot of ironies about this 
day. We in the Democratic Women’s 
Caucus and the Bipartisan Women’s 
Caucus could not let this day go by 
without drawing attention to what is 
happening in Ukraine to women, moth-
ers, and children. The irony is particu-
larly significant because International 
Women’s Day is a national holiday in 
Ukraine and Russia. 
The Administrator of USAID and 
former U.S. Ambassador Samantha 
Power commented on this today. She 
referenced that the founder of Inter-
national Women’s Day was a woman by 
the name of Theresa Malkiel. She was 
a Jewish labor organizer in New York. 
She was born in what is now Ukraine, 
and she emigrated to the United States 
to escape persecution. Madam Speaker, 
130 years later, Ukrainian women are 
now being forced to leave their homes 
as well. 
Now, we are heralding the incredible 
strength of Ukrainian women. They are 
facing unimaginable horrors brought 
about by Vladimir Putin and Vladimir 
Putin alone. 
Last year, President Putin sent a 
message to women for International 
Women’s Day in Russia. He said: ‘‘I 
wish you good health and success . . . . 
And, of course, I would like you to 
have as many reasons for smiles and 
joy as possible.’’ 
I guess the question to ask Putin is: 
Does that apply to Ukrainian women 
as well, the women you presume are 
Russian but are willing to have them 
be forced into death marches because 
you feel compelled to shell commu-
nities throughout Ukraine? 
Last week, Vladimir Putin’s forces 
killed a woman and two children in 
cold blood as they attempted to escape 
over a bridge in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv, 
and he continues to order the shelling 
of evacuation corridors as Ukrainian 
civilians attempt to flee. Over 1 mil-
lion of them have already left. It is 
going to be millions and millions more. 
Let me just show you a couple of pic-
tures, Madam Speaker. This is a 
woman in Ukraine on International 
Women’s Day, thanks to Vladimir 
Putin. This is what Vladimir Putin 
thinks of women. These are the smiles 
he wants to see on their faces, the joy 
he wants to see in their eyes. 
This man needs to be called out for 
what he is. He is a tyrant, and he is 
committing premeditated war on the 
Ukrainian 
people 
and 
Ukrainian 
women and children. He is doing so and 
committing war crimes as well. 
Let me show you yet another picture, 
Madam Speaker. 
This is one that is hard to look at. 
These are three dead women who were 
trying to escape and were shelled down. 
They are now dead. They have their 
suitcases and their backpacks. One is a 
small girl. This is what Vladimir Putin 
is doing in Ukraine, and he must be 
called out for it. 
His bloodthirsty disregard for the 
lives of women and children has never 
been more apparent. Last month, I was 
disgusted to hear him use a crude rape 
reference to urge Ukraine to acquiesce 
to Russia’s demands, saying: ‘‘You may 
like it. You may not. But you will have 
to endure it, my beauty.’’ 
Vladimir Putin said this: ‘‘You may 
like it. You may not. But you will have 
to endure it, my beauty.’’ 
His senseless war has already caused 
nearly 500 civilian deaths, and it is 
probably more than that, including 29 
children, and it is probably more than 
that. He has already forced 2 million 
Ukrainian people, mostly women and 
children—in fact, about half of them 
children—to flee their country. 
On the news tonight was a story 
about an 11-year-old child whose moth-
er let him leave. He traveled 700 miles 
to get to a safe haven. His mother, 
from 
some 
outpost 
somewhere 
in 
Ukraine, put up a video thanking those 
who had taken her son into their arms 
and who had brought him to safety. 
That is what Vladimir Putin is forcing 
Ukrainian families to do. 
The vast majority of these refugees, 
as I said, are women and children who 
have left their husbands, their broth-
ers, and their fathers behind to fight. 
For the first time—for the first time 
ever—half of these refugees are chil-
dren. 
Now, think about the scars that will 
take place in the minds of those chil-
dren over their lifetimes. These are 
children who should be home playing in

their neighborhoods and heading off to 
school, not hiding in bomb shelters and 
fleeing across borders, not crying in 
their mama’s arms for milk when all 
they can get is water. 
Women and girls who are single and 
arriving at the border face an increased 
risk of exploitation and abuse, includ-
ing sexual violence, gender-based vio-
lence, and trafficking. 
Welcome to International Women’s 
Day. Welcome to what Vladimir Putin 
said he wanted, to put smiles and joy 
on the faces of women. Instead, women 
are becoming victims of sex trafficking 
and rape. 
The disruption of essential services 
and emergency medical care has al-
ready affected the women in Ukraine. 
We have seen heartbreaking reports of 
mothers giving birth in makeshift 
bomb shelters and underground metro 
stations as Russia bombs Ukraine’s cit-
ies. 
The 
U.N. 
estimates 
that 
80,000 
Ukrainian women will give birth in the 
next 3 months—80,000 of them. That is 
as many women who will give birth as 
I have in one of my larger cities in my 
district. Many of these women are 
going to do it alone without the sup-
port of their family or their spouses, 
and they are going to do it without ac-
cess to medication or critical and life-
saving care. 
This is the joy and smiles that Vladi-
mir Putin talked about in his address 
for International Women’s Day last 
year. I don’t know what he said to the 
Russian women today. Did he send 
them flowers, give them candy, and 
offer them gifts? 
This is what he calls gifts to the 
Ukrainian women. The Russian con-
flict in the Donbas region has already 
led to an increase in sexual violence. In 
2019, one in three Ukrainian women re-
ported experiencing physical or sexual 
violence, and the current crisis in-
creases this risk exponentially. 
We have seen a horrific increase in 
sexual violence just in the past 2 
weeks. In the city of Kherson alone, 
Russian soldiers raped at least 11 
women, in some cases so brutally that 
only five of them have survived. 
We must elevate these stories and 
call Vladimir Putin out for what he is. 
He is a misogynistic, evil dictator. 
Nevertheless, Ukrainian women are 
fighting back. I am really in awe of the 
ordinary, brave Ukrainian women who 
are leading the fight to protect their 
country. 
I am going to show you a picture 
now, Madam Speaker, of the Ukrainian 
women. These are Ukrainian women. 
They represent almost 22 percent of 
Ukraine’s armed forces, which is one of 
the highest percentages in the world. 
In the United States, the number of 
women serving in the military is like 
18 percent. It is 22 percent in Ukraine. 
Many women, many mothers, are 
taking their children to the border to 
hand them off to family members in 
Poland or Romania or other locales 
and then going back in to join in the 
fight. 
More women are joining the fight 
every day. They are teachers, nurses, 
accountants, police officers, and grand-
mothers. The list goes on and on. Even 
women members of the Ukrainian par-
liament, who just 11⁄2 weeks ago were 
writing their country’s laws, have 
taken up arms in defense of Ukraine. 
I guess we should all ask a question: 
Would we do that? 
The Ukrainian parliamentary mem-
bers are doing that. It is important for 
us to have their backs. 
I am proud that the United States 
has imposed unprecedented sanctions 
and export controls on the Russian 
economy. I am proud of what our Presi-
dent has done by solidifying the sup-
port of all NATO nations, something 
that hasn’t been done for a very long 
time. 
NATO countries throughout Europe 
are stepping up in terms of how much 
money they are committing to their 
defense. They all recognize that this is 
about more than Ukraine. This is 
about freedom for all of Europe. 
I commend the Speaker for working 
quickly to bring a Russia energy sanc-
tions package to the floor and commit-
ting to sending $14 billion to Ukraine 
to aid its military and assist with hu-
manitarian responses. We must bring 
the full weight of the U.S. Government 
and our allies to bear in holding Putin 
accountable for his aggression and his 
violations of international law. 
Let 
me 
show 
you 
this 
picture, 
Madam Speaker. This is International 
Women’s Day. There is no joy on the 
faces of these people. There are no 
smiles. 
This is Vladimir Putin’s war. He has 
every intention to annihilate an entire 
population of people in Ukraine. This is 
not just an unprovoked war; this is a 
premeditated, savage, murderous, and 
tyrannical attempt of genocide. 
I hope that we have the guts to call 
him out. We need to create our red 
line, and our red line should be that 
every Ukrainian person who wants to 
leave the country will have safe pas-
sage to a safe country before another 
bullet or another missile is put into 
the air. 
I hope we do not see the unthinkable 
happen in Ukraine. 
God bless our Ukrainian women and 
children. God bless our Ukrainian 
President. God bless the military in 
Ukraine who fights on and all those 
who recognize that freedom is not 
cheap and freedom is not given. If you 
want a democracy, you have to be will-
ing to put your name, your body, and 
your soul on the line to protect the 
community that you love. 
Madam Speaker, I have the great and 
distinct honor to yield to the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), who is 
my colleague whom I adore. She co- 
chairs the Congressional Ukrainian 
Caucus and has been passionate about 
drawing attention to the fate of the 
Ukrainian people. 
b 2100 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Congresswoman JACKIE 
SPEIER of California for her leadership 
on so many issues, including women. 
Not just women but for people every-
where, in our country, those who have 
been abused, those who serve in our 
military, and those who serve in our 
intelligence services. I thank her for 
her great contributions to our country, 
how she has lived her life and has 
served so nobly. The people of Cali-
fornia have really sent a jewel here, 
and they know it. I shall miss her 
greatly when she makes her decision to 
leave us at the end of this session of 
Congress. She is truly a friend and a 
friend to the American people. 
I am very honored this evening to 
join her and rise on this International 
Women’s Day to call out the damaged 
and really bestial soul of Vladimir 
Putin. His torturous treatment of the 
women, 
children, 
and 
elderly 
of 
Ukraine is a war crime. 
He is about genocide in a country 
that 30 years ago voted to be inde-
pendent. When the Soviet Union fell, 90 
percent of the people of Ukraine, about 
42 million people, voted that they 
wanted to be free. It was an extraor-
dinary moment in world history. 
But yet, we hear from this—what do 
I call him—Russia’s tyrant—last year 
on International Women’s Day, he 
issued a statement. Here is what he 
said: Congratulations to women—call-
ing the day a ‘‘holiday filled with joy, 
warmth and goodness.’’ And he talked 
about mothers, granddaughters, grand-
mothers, aunts, sisters, saying how 
they represented love and tenderness 
and how good this was. Yet, if we look 
at the pictures that are here, he is kill-
ing them. 
There are pictures of the people. 
Look at this woman. He says tender-
ness and love and that women are tak-
ing care of countries and they are rais-
ing children. He is killing them. 
The elderly and the disabled—I re-
ceived a letter today, and two individ-
uals were killed in a car because a Rus-
sian bomb came down in a civilian 
area. The woman who was driving was 
elderly, and the person she had in the 
car with her was disabled. He is mas-
sacring civilians. He says he loves 
women. Really? They are dead. They 
didn’t have a chance. They are civil-
ians. 
In terms of the disruption of life in 
Ukraine, God bless them. Over 2 mil-
lion have now fled from their tiny, lit-
tle homes. It is one of the poorest Na-
tions in Europe, but it wants its free-
dom. 
Here is a picture of the numbers of 
people fleeing. You can see, if you look 
at the number of headscarves, these are 
women with their children. Many at 
the Ukraine-Poland border are kissing 
their husbands goodbye, they fear for 
the last time. The children are crying. 
In the westernmost city of Ukraine, 
Lviv, there is a sea of displaced people. 
Europe has not seen this since the Sec-
ond World War, nothing like it. Free 
people everywhere have to pay atten-
tion. These are good people.

H1366 
March 8, 2022 
Seventy-five percent of the food 
raised in that country that is eaten by 
the people there is raised by those 
women in their family plots, in their 
gardens. Putin is killing them. He is 
killing the mothers and grandmothers 
of Ukraine. 
What do his statements matter in the 
Kremlin, when he comes out of his 
cave, wherever that is. We see the 
butchery on the news every night. We 
see it on our iPhones. Our visceral feel-
ings of horror pale in comparison to 
the lived reality of those who now 
know deep fear, anxiety, and loss. 
The reality is that Putin is sending 
his troops in those tanks and those jets 
up in the air to shoot and bomb hos-
pitals and maternity wards and kinder-
gartens and schools. He has already 
killed, from 2014 to the present, when 
he first invaded Ukraine, 14,000 people 
who aren’t known to the world, and 
now more. He has no heart. 
In his statement last year, on Inter-
national Women’s Day, he said: Thank 
you to the women doctors, the para-
medics, the medical nurses, and all of 
those who are saving lives and nursing 
patients back to health. What a lie. 
These women in Ukraine today, with-
out proper bandages, without medical 
equipment, are caring for women who 
are pregnant and delivering in the sub-
way systems of the capital city, in 
Kyiv. If they need a C-section and they 
are cut, there is no thread to sew them 
up. How about that, Putin? How about 
that? 
How many children have you killed 
since your invasion of Ukraine? The 
misery among these people. 
This abominable creature is now 
spilling the blood of those he once her-
alded. Ukraine’s medical professionals 
and their patients are being murdered. 
The people trying to help are being 
murdered. 
On a day Putin recently proclaimed 
as the triumph of love and admiration 
and gratitude. This two-faced liar is 
committing war crimes against an in-
nocent people. 
Can Putin be human? A human could 
not celebrate women on one day and 
then annihilate them and their fami-
lies on the next. He simply couldn’t be 
human. He is a killer of Lucifer propor-
tion. He considers human life not sa-
cred. 
So on this International Women’s 
Day, a day dedicated to honoring 
women around the globe, let us recog-
nize the brave, courageous women of 
Ukraine. 
From every walk of life, they have 
endured centuries of oppression. Now, 
with this window on liberty, this mo-
ment in history, they have a chance to 
take their young democracy forward, 
and they are fighting for it. 
They are sewing camouflage material 
to try to prevent the planes from see-
ing where they live. They are defending 
their homeland with every ounce left 
in them. There is not enough food, and 
there is not enough water. 
As co-chair of the Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus and as someone who 
has visited Ukraine since the 1970s 
countless times, I know these women 
and their bravery. There is nothing you 
can teach a grandma in Ukraine that 
she hasn’t been through. We call them 
babusyas. They are the world’s strong-
est women. They have endured so 
much. Ukraine’s women are truly en-
gaged in a battle to slay Goliath. 
Ukraine’s passionate, generous, and 
courageous women are on the front 
lines. There are some who are serving 
in the military itself, on the home 
front, in their neighborhoods. 
I don’t know if anybody saw the 
babusya, a grandma, who had a pan, 
and she hit an armed drone out of the 
air. How about that? They are learning 
how to use guns, to do anything to help 
their people in beating the savage at-
tacks of Kremlin’s Putin. 
b 2110 
The entire world sees the bold spirit 
of these women. Here in America, we 
see that spirit in Ukraine’s remarkable 
Ambassador Oksana Markarova, who 
has such dignity, dignity under pres-
sure, real courage, rallying our Nation 
and our leaders for the aid of her coun-
try. We must hear her. We must hear 
the pleas of the people of Ukraine. 
In the midst of unceasing atrocity, 
Ukraine’s women are pouring their 
hearts and souls into the righteous 
cause of defending the bright shining 
light of liberty. They can see it. 
I will tell you one experience I had 
when I first went to Ukraine, and I 
watched how the people walked with 
their heads down, and they didn’t want 
to be noticed. They tried to be almost 
disappeared while they were walking 
down the sidewalk. They didn’t want to 
make eye contact with anybody. 
Today, when you go to Ukraine, the 
new generation, they look at you, they 
have hope in their eyes, there is possi-
bility. They want to access West. There 
is no more noble duty than defending 
liberty and letting others enjoy its 
bounty. 
When envisioning the vanguards of 
democracy, don’t think of some myth-
ical beings. Instead, think of the flesh 
and blood of Ukrainian women who are 
protecting and defending the precious 
blessings of the bit of democracy and 
liberty that they have been able to 
taste. These women are the real hero-
ines among us. 
Today, America and the world rise up 
in solidarity with Ukraine’s women. 
Let 
us 
salute 
their 
valiant 
fight 
against the darkness and the mur-
derous behavior of Vladimir Putin. We 
stand with them, and we stand with 
Ukraine. No country in the world has 
done more for Ukraine than the people 
of our great country. 
Today, on International Women’s 
Day in the year of 2022, America ex-
claims to Ukraine’s women: Slava 
Ukraini. Thank you, we love you, we 
know you are going to be victorious. It 
is going to take a bit more time, but 
know that we in the free world stand 
with you and are doing everything pos-
sible to save you, to save your beloved 
families, to save your communities, to 
save your country. You so deserve the 
liberty that you have earned. 
I say in many of my speeches back 
home, there is no more sacred soil than 
the soil of Ukraine because of what its 
people intergenerationally have en-
dured through no fault of their own. 
They deserve to be free. They have 
earned it. 
Ms. SPEIER. I thank the remarkable 
gentlewoman from Ohio, whose passion 
and commitment to the Ukrainian peo-
ple is just so evident. She said that 
they will be victorious. I believe her 
because we are going to make sure 
they are going to be victorious. We 
have their backs. 
I am reminded of this comment by 
one Ukrainian woman, and she said: 
Nobody thought this is how we would 
spend our weekend; a teacher from the 
town of Dnipro told a cameraman as 
she and her neighbors made molotov 
cocktails. She said: I planned to plant 
tulips and daffodils on my backyard 
today. Instead, I learned to fire arms 
and get ready for the next night of at-
tacks on Kyiv. These women are strong 
and committed, and we will have their 
backs. 
It is now a great privilege to yield to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. DEAN), co-chair of the bipartisan 
Women’s Caucus and a talented leader. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Representative SPEIER and Representa-
tive MARCY KAPTUR. It is a solemn 
privilege to be with them tonight as we 
lift up the people of Ukraine, as we lift 
up the women and children of Ukraine 
on this International Women’s Day. 
It is a sad day. It is a solemn day 
around the globe, and I hope that the 
people of Ukraine know that we are 
heartbroken and determined alongside 
of them. 
I 
will 
begin 
by 
saying, 
‘‘Slava 
Ukraini. Slava Heroyam,’’ and recog-
nize this International Women’s Day. 
I am the co-chair of the bipartisan 
Women’s Caucus, and on behalf of that 
caucus, I stand here to lift up the peo-
ple of Ukraine, in particular, the 
women and children in their suffering. 
I want to say personally for me—I am 
speaking for no one in this case other 
than myself—I don’t believe that we 
are actually witnessing a war here. I 
believe we are witnessing a series of 
war crimes; that we are witnessing a 
series, the world is witnessing a series 
of atrocities. There is no justification 
for this attack on the sovereign nation 
of Ukraine. These are war crimes, and 
they are Mr. Putin’s alone. 
I represent the Fourth Congressional 
District of Pennsylvania. It is Mont-
gomery and Berks Counties, suburban

fourth year in Congress. I have always 
been proud to call them my community 
members, but sadly never so proud as I 
have been in the last 3, 4 weeks, as 
they prepared for this horror that we 
all hoped would not come. 
Just a few days ago, I was with the 
Ukrainian organizations and volun-
teers at the Ukrainian Educational and 
Cultural Center in Abington, many of 
whom still have close family and 
friends in Ukraine. And, in fact, the 
children there made me this beautiful 
headband; made for me and for many 
others. What was fascinating that day 
is everyone was coming together, com-
munity 
coming 
together—not 
just 
Ukrainian Americans, but others—to 
say we will not stand for the horror 
that is going on. The globe, the world 
will not stand for the atrocities, the 
murderous brutality of Mr. Putin on 
sovereign people. 
One woman who started a donation 
drive was amazed. She went to U-Haul 
and bought 30 boxes, and she wondered 
if they would be able to fill those 30 
boxes with donations of humanitarian 
food, medicines, blankets, clothing, 
and others. Well, I think there were 
about three container trucks later. The 
place was teeming with people, volun-
teers of all stripes, towering with boxes 
of donations and people furiously and 
very hopefully sorting those things. It 
was an amazing snapshot of what I al-
ready knew about the Ukrainian-Amer-
ican community. They are leaders in 
Montgomery County. They are leaders 
in this country. They are leaders we 
are watching and witnessing in this 
world. Their generosity and strength, 
their determination is extraordinary, 
and we cannot imagine the pain and 
suffering as they watch their home-
land, they watch their family, their 
neighbors, their friends struggling with 
this set of atrocities. 
No amount of warnings from the 
Biden administration and our intel-
ligence could have prepared us for the 
sheer brutality and devastation we 
have seen. Mr. Putin expected that he 
would quickly topple Ukraine’s young 
democracy. He was wrong, and he will 
be forever wrong, as we have watched 
in all the resilience and the heroism of 
the Ukrainians, especially President 
Zelensky. 
Over 
the 
weekend, 
President 
Zelensky got on a call with Members of 
Congress, both House and Senate, Re-
publicans and Democrats, hundreds of 
us. What a man of determination and 
dignity. I took notes. He said to us: We 
just want peace. We want to hold and 
kiss our children. We want to go to 
work. We want to sip coffee at our 
kitchen table. We want to be neighbors 
with the Russians. 
What bravery. What dignity. And yet 
this war has brought on him and us a 
humanitarian crisis, with the number 
of people fleeing Ukraine already ex-
ceeding 2 million. But death, displace-
ment, and destruction must not be for-
ever. We must provide necessary aid, 
weapons, medicines, food, fuel, refuge 
in a bipartisan universal way. I know 
we all in Congress will continue to do 
all we can. 
Ukrainians worldwide, please know 
we are here for you. You are welcome 
here. God bless Ukraine. 
The U.N. has recorded 406 civilian 
casualty deaths. Sadly, I think it will 
be far more than that. An 18-month-old 
boy was killed in his home after he was 
shelled by Russian forces; 13 civilians 
killed in an air strike on the town of 
Makariv, their bodies recovered from 
the rubble; a 26-year-old woman killed 
while attempting to deliver supplies to 
a dog shelter in Buka; eight people 
killed during Russian shelling while 
trying to flee the town of Irpin—chil-
dren, mothers, civilians; a preschool in 
northeastern Ukraine hit while civil-
ians took shelter, killing three of 
them, including a child and wounding 
another. 
b 2120 
These tragedies are inspiring a Na-
tion and the many women in it, and I 
applaud the women of Ukraine fighting 
to keep their country free and the 
women of Russia protesting and speak-
ing out against Mr. Putin, even at the 
risk of imprisonment and worse. 
I think of Ukraine’s Ambassador to 
the U.N., whom we have met with this 
past summer and this last week—what 
a tower of strength; and Julia, a teach-
er and volunteer who wept and said, ‘‘I 
just want to live in our country, and 
that is all,’’ as she waited to be de-
ployed to fight Russian troops. 
Putin will forever be a pariah. The 
globe recognizes him for the mur-
derous, brutal dictator that he seeks to 
be. 
Yet, I have hope. I have hope in the 
Ukrainian people and the globe that 
has recognized the horror that is this 
series of war crimes. 
Representative SPEIER, thank you for 
heading this tonight. Slava Ukraini. 
Slava Heroyam. God bless Ukraine. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Pennsyl-
vania (Ms. DEAN) for her outstanding 
remarks. 
Madam Speaker, there are many peo-
ple to thank. There are many organiza-
tions to thank. 
When we look at who is bringing 
shelter and aid to the Ukrainian people 
now, 
the 
nonprofit 
organizations 
around the world, CARE, Catholic Re-
lief Services, the U.N.’s Food and Agri-
culture Organization, the International 
Committee of the Red Cross, the Inter-
national 
Rescue 
Committee, 
Plan 
International, 
Save 
the 
Children, 
UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, World Food 
Program, and World Health Organiza-
tion. To all of them, we say thank you. 
Let’s be clear: This is Putin’s war. He 
will pay the price. His vicious, pre-
meditated attempt of genocide of the 
Ukrainian people will not be tolerated. 
Tonight, I want to close with this 
photograph of Ukrainian women in uni-
form. They are fighting for their coun-
try, their future, their children, and 
truly for freedom around the world. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back. 
f 
TAKING PUTIN’S WORDS AND 
DEEDS SERIOUSLY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I am 
here to have a discussion with the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY), my good 
friend, about President Putin’s actions 
in Russia. 
Putin is waging an unprovoked and 
unjustified war on Ukraine. Over the 
past 2 weeks, his attacks have become 
increasingly violent. The attacks have 
become more severe, even targeting 
residential areas. 
At the same time that Putin is en-
gaged in a bloody war with tragic con-
sequences for the people of Ukraine, he 
is also engaged in a propaganda war. 
His disinformation campaign is geared 
toward: first, his own people, who have 
largely been kept in the dark about the 
atrocities of this war against Ukraine; 
and, second, the entire world. 
In justifying his war to the world, 
Putin has relied on the ridiculous 
claim that he is the appointed person 
to denazify Ukraine. 
The Russian Government released a 
statement on March 1 through the Rus-
sian Embassy in Canada, stating: ‘‘Rus-
sia continues its special military oper-
ation to demilitarize and denazify 
Ukraine. The Russian army does not 
occupy Ukrainian territory and takes 
all measures to preserve the lives and 
safety of civilians. The strikes are tar-
geting military facilities only. . . . The 
tasks to clear Ukraine of Nazism . . . 
will be accomplished.’’ 
Congressman ROY, there is a lot of 
evidence that Putin’s army is targeting 
civilian targets. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) for 
this important time talking about the 
horrors that have been inflicted upon 
people by Vladimir Putin. Specifically, 
we know how much damage he has 
been causing to the people of Ukraine. 
More than 1.7 million—in fact, I saw 
a graphic just before I came to the 
floor—2 million Ukrainians have been 
displaced, have been fleeing Ukraine 
for other countries nearby. 
Over 2,000 civilians have been killed, 
according to reports. But, obviously, 
we don’t know the extent of the dam-
age and the carnage. Thirty-eight chil-
dren have been killed that we know of, 
but there are probably more, and 70 
wounded that we know of. 
Madam Speaker, $10 billion in dam-
ages to Ukrainian infrastructure, prob-
ably far more than that; 200 schools, 34 
hospitals, and 1,500 residential homes 
destroyed—these are the basic numbers 
just coming in. We know they are 
going to be far greater. 
On Saturday, a family with two chil-
dren, a teenage son and a daughter who 
appeared to be 8 years old, and several

March 8, 2022 
other civilians were killed by a Russian 
military strike at an evacuation cross-
ing point in a Kyiv suburb as they were 
trying to flee Ukraine. 
Ukraine has required men to stay to 
defend their country, forcing families 
to make the unthinkable decision. One 
Ukraine woman said: ‘‘It is very hard 
to have your husband stay home. You 
have to choose: Save the kids or stay 
with him.’’ 
I have heard from friends and read 
dozens of tragic stories in the past few 
days through friends of mine in Austin, 
Texas, who have gone to Ukraine to 
help people. I have been in touch, 
through them, with an orphanage in 
Kyiv with somewhere upward of 50 chil-
dren, up to 14 infants, up near the sub-
urbs of north Kyiv. 
They are struggling. They are lack-
ing food. They are lacking the mate-
rials to survive. They are trying to fig-
ure out how to get to a place where 
they can get to help. 
We have actors on the ground trying 
to help them, but they can’t get to 
them because of what Putin is doing 
and not really heeding the calls for 
helping people be able to get out of 
harm’s way. 
Right now, these children are com-
pletely helpless. A nurse from Lutsk in 
western Ukraine who fled to Poland 
said the decision on whether to stay or 
go was not instantaneous. When the 
Russian army first invaded eastern 
Ukraine, she and her husband decided 
to wait: ‘‘We were hoping that the situ-
ation wouldn’t develop into a full-scale 
invasion. But as hours passed, it be-
came obvious that things were only 
getting worse.’’ 
The next morning, she and her 2- 
year-old son, Tymi, got in a car and 
headed for Poland, where they waited 
10 hours at the border. She said saying 
good-bye to their husband and father, 
who stayed in Ukraine to build barri-
cades, was heartbreaking. 
She and her son were hosted by a 
Polish family, Robert and Hana, an 
English language university instructor 
and a human resources supervisor, who 
live with their two children. They 
made it clear that their hospitality 
didn’t have an end date. 
Alex in Kyiv is helping his friends 
evacuate. Sergei in Rivne is setting up 
shelters for his community and pro-
viding food and supplies. Peter in 
Zhytomyr packed his car yesterday 
and is currently taking his neighbors 
to Poland. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I think 
it is worthwhile to take a look at who 
this leader is. 
Who is Vladimir Putin? He began his 
career, not surprisingly, Congressman, 
at the KGB. He came to power in 2000, 
winning the presidency after having 
served as a Secretary of the Security 
Council of Russia and as the Director 
of the Federal Security Service. 
Putin served as President until 2008, 
when he was constitutionally prohib-
ited from seeking a third term, but 
Putin had little regard for the Russian 
Constitution. He orchestrated a ma-
neuver in which one of his yes-men 
would be installed as the new Presi-
dent, and Putin would assume the role 
of Prime Minister. 
After serving as Russia’s top leader, 
but in the capacity of Prime Minister, 
Putin then did the unthinkable and ran 
again as President in 2012. With pro-
tests and allegations of mass fraud in 
his background, he assumed another 6- 
year term and then again ran in 2018. 
Even more alarming, in April of last 
year, Putin signed into law a series of 
constitutional amendments that would 
permit him to run for President two 
additional terms, serving a total of 36 
years. 
Putin’s regime has become increas-
ingly totalitarian, and Putin himself 
has put his KGB background to use, 
employing 
Soviet-era 
repressions 
against the people of Russia. 
b 2130 
He has cracked down on free speech, 
seized control of the media, and had his 
opponents and critics assassinated. 
Congressman, I know you feel strong-
ly about how President Putin has put 
his KGB background to use. 
Mr. ROY. Will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. BUCK. I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, we are 
seeing Putin’s propaganda tactics, as 
we speak. The world is seeing it on full 
display. His regime is systematically 
shutting down the free flow of informa-
tion surrounding this brutal war in 
Ukraine. The State run newspapers in 
Russia have been instructed to not use 
the words ‘‘invasion’’ or ‘‘war.’’ Just 
days ago, Putin’s regime shut off 
Facebook access in the country. 
Now, again, whatever Russians are 
able to see what we are saying on the 
floor, this is the truth. This is the 
truth of what Vladimir Putin is doing 
to the truth and the dissemination of 
information of what is happening in 
Russia, what is happening to the people 
of Ukraine, not the propaganda you’re 
hearing in Russia. 
Just days ago, Putin’s regime shut 
off Facebook, as I said. The Russian 
newspaper translated as ‘‘New News-
paper’’ has a brave, freedom-loving edi-
tor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov—he co- 
won last year’s Nobel Peace Prize—who 
has been forced to remove all of the 
material on the newspaper’s website re-
lated to Russia’s aggression in the 
Ukraine. 
Think about that. That is what is 
happening. This isn’t new. It is his 
track record. He came to power be-
cause of a terrorist act that was di-
rected at Russia’s own people. 
In 1999, three apartment buildings in 
Moscow, Dagestan, and Volgodonsk 
were bombed. Those bombings, alleg-
edly the acts of Chechen terrorists, 
gave a pretext for going into Chechnya 
for a second war, thus solidifying sup-
port for Putin as head of the Security 
Council. 
Since then, almost everyone who has 
raised questions about these bombings 
or has attempted to investigate the 
cause of these bombings has been 
kicked out of Russia, imprisoned, or 
murdered. 
Those are the facts. That is who 
Putin is. 
During his more than two decades of 
ruling Russia, Putin has displayed a 
callous disregard for human life. He 
has engaged in murderous attacks on 
his political opposition. 
In 2004, the Putin regime poisoned 
Ukrainian 
Presidential 
candidate 
Viktor Yushchenko. 
In 2006, there was the polonium kill-
ing in London of Alexander Litvinenko, 
a defector from Russia. 
In 2009, Sergei Magnitsky was taken 
into police custody, beaten, deprived of 
medical care, and he died in jail. 
In 2013, Boris Berezovsky was found 
in his home in the United Kingdom 
dead. Berezovsky had long been a critic 
of Putin, accused the Kremlin of or-
chestrating the killing of Alexander 
Litvinenko, who had been poisoned in 
2006. 
In 2015, Boris Nemtsov was shot four 
times in the back just a short distance 
from the Kremlin. He was another crit-
ic of Putin. 
And in 2017, the world was horrified 
by the daylight shooting of Denis 
Voronenkov, who was murdered in 
Kyiv after renouncing his Russian citi-
zenship and criticizing Vladimir Putin. 
That is the truth of Putin’s brutality. 
Mr. BUCK. And, Congressman ROY, I 
just want to go through one of these 
slides again, if I can. I don’t know if 
you got a look at this, but this is the 
before and after. This is a man who 
left, went to England, was poisoned, 
and this is what he looked like before, 
and that is after he was poisoned with 
radioactive materials. 
Mr. ROY. And how was he poisoned? 
Mr. BUCK. Radioactive material. He 
was poisoned, and that is how he looks 
afterwards. 
Unbelievable 
that 
one 
human being can do this to another 
human being, much less a leader of a 
major nuclear power in the world. 
Mr. ROY. Is there any disagreement 
on the intelligence that this is what 
occurred at the hands of Vladimir 
Putin’s orders? 
Mr. BUCK. Right. No disagreement in 
the world. And what is so significant is 
when Vladimir Putin says this is what 
is happening in Ukraine, who can be-
lieve him? 
Mr. ROY. Right. 
Mr. BUCK. In fact, you can pretty 
much go to Vegas and bet your money 
on the opposite of what this man says. 
If he is able to do something like this, 
one, he is a coward, and two, he is a 
monster. 
During his more than two decades of 
ruling Russia, Putin has displayed a 
callous disregard for human life. As 
part of Putin’s war on Chechnya, he or-
dered the destruction of Chechnya’s 
capital Grozny. Tens of thousands of 
civilians were killed in this brutal as-
sault. 
In 2008, Putin waged another war, 
this time in Georgia, another part of

the former Soviet Union. The Georgian 
President during Putin’s assault in 2008 
had this to say in The Wall Street 
Journal, and, Congressman ROY, I want 
you to really hear this because it is so 
unbelievable how similar what the 
Georgian President said in 2008 is to 
the game plan that Putin has orches-
trated in Ukraine. 
Mr. ROY. Yes. 
Mr. BUCK. ‘‘Long before its conven-
tional assault on Georgia, Russia open-
ly backed separatist militants—that 
sounds 
familiar—launched 
cyberattacks and used disinformation 
to meddle in the internal affairs of sov-
ereign states. Initial intelligence re-
ports of Russian forces entering Geor-
gian territory didn’t even cause enough 
concern to order Georgian military of-
ficials back from their holidays. . . . 
‘‘But in August 2008, under the aus-
pices of securing the separatist en-
clave, Russia invaded my country . . . 
‘‘Leaving aside the practical impos-
sibility of Georgia attacking a nuclear 
power 100 times its size, the entirety of 
the conflict took place on internation-
ally recognized Georgian territory. The 
Kremlin’s claim that its land forces 
mobilized overnight in response to an 
emergency was absurd. Such an on-
slaught required careful preparation, 
especially given the mountainous ter-
rain of the Russian-Georgian border.’’ 
And I think what is really important 
to point out here is that President 
Putin has used the exact same plan, 
the exact same formula down to the T, 
claiming that there are Russian-speak-
ing people and he is trying to protect 
those people in Ukraine, down to the 
absurd claim that Ukraine is a Nazi 
government now. All these claims are 
made up, they are nonsense to try to 
justify in the minds of the Russian peo-
ple what Putin is engaged in. 
Mr. ROY. That is exactly right. And 
I want to take 1 minute because it mer-
its repeating because we are sitting 
here in the United States of America in 
the protection of our great Republic 
miles away from what is happening in 
Ukraine, and it bears repeating that 
there are two million Ukrainians right 
now fleeing Ukraine, fleeing their 
homes. We fortunately haven’t had to 
experience that sort of thing. 
But two million people right now are 
fleeing their homes, dads and husbands 
staying behind in Ukraine, families 
fleeing, 
seeking 
shelter, 
thousands 
killed, we don’t know how many, chil-
dren killed, billions of dollars of dam-
age, destroying crops, destroying infra-
structure, taking over nuclear power 
plants. 
And I just got a text, literally as I 
am standing here, from my friends in 
Austin, Texas—from the wife whose 
husband is currently now in Ukraine 
trying to help people—talking about 
the orphanage I talked about in north-
ern Kyiv. She says 51 kids are trapped; 
51 kids trapped. 
Do you have kids? People around 
here, many of us have kids. Fifty-one 
kids trapped after orphanage bombed 
and director killed. The director of the 
orphanage was killed. Running out of 
food. No heat or electricity. Cold front 
coming. Will freeze or starve if we 
can’t get there soon. Fifteen infants. 
Special needs kids. Currently shelling 
of all civilian targets being perpetrated 
and carried out by Putin. The same 
Putin that killed a Ukrainian leader 
with nuclear poisoning. 
This from my friend: We are pleading 
for someone to help us get to the chil-
dren before it is too late. And we are 
trying. Anybody out there watching, 
we are trying to figure out how to get 
to this orphanage and get them to peo-
ple who can help. But that is the prod-
uct of Vladimir Putin. And if you are 
watching this, and if you are in Russia 
or if this clip gets to you and it isn’t 
cut off by Putin and his thug leader-
ship in Russia, this is the truth of 
Vladimir Putin. This is what he is 
doing to innocent people. 
And he is lying to you that these 
children are being put up as somehow 
being a front and being put up to be put 
in harm’s way. He is indiscriminately 
bombing. He is the cause of these chil-
dren being in danger. He is the cause of 
this murder. He is the cause of thou-
sands of people getting killed, millions 
getting displaced, billions in damage, 
and it is all because he is a thug and an 
autocrat, who is going after and killing 
innocent people. 
b 2140 
Mr. BUCK. An immoral person does 
not wage a moral war, does not poison 
people, does not continue to commit 
the war crimes and the illegalities— 
murdering a political opponent just 
blocks away from the Kremlin. That 
kind of immoral person doesn’t have 
the standing to talk to the world about 
what is going on in Ukraine. 
I know, Congressman, you were a 
prosecutor. I was a prosecutor. When 
we had a criminal defendant who lied, 
that was a special treat, because we 
got to put witnesses on the stand, and 
we called it a false exculpatory. And 
Vladimir Putin has gone through his 
entire 
political 
career 
using 
false 
exculpatories; telling people one thing 
happened when, in fact, something else 
happened. 
And the reason it is so important to 
point out false exculpatories is, it is a 
sign of guilt. And in this case, Vladimir 
Putin knows what he is doing is in vio-
lation of international law. He has 
committed 
numerous 
war 
crimes 
through his military; indiscriminately 
bombing civilian targets. And he is a 
war criminal, and he should be brought 
to justice. 
But my question to you now is, Con-
gressman, are we doing everything we 
can as a country to make sure that we 
bring this thug—as you put it—this 
animal who is violating international 
law, killing children, destroying bil-
lions of dollars worth of infrastructure 
in Ukraine. Are we, as Americans, are 
we, as the civilized world working with 
Western Europe, working with NATO, 
are we doing everything we can to 
bring this man to justice and to stop 
the tragedy that is going on in 
Ukraine? 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, well, I ap-
preciate my friend from Colorado’s 
question. And I would note in your 
comparison as to our experience as 
Federal prosecutors, that there is no 
entity that is able to hold him to ac-
count in Russia because he is running 
the whole show as a dictator, and there 
is no free press. 
In our country—as bad as the press 
can be—we at least hope that we can 
get the truth out through the vestiges 
of the First Amendment and the impor-
tance of the free press, no matter who 
is in the White House. Right? 
Mr. BUCK. Yes. 
Mr. ROY. Neither you nor I shied 
away from criticizing the former Presi-
dent of the United States, despite the 
fact he had an ‘‘R’’ after his name. Nor 
will we shy away from criticizing this 
President who has a ‘‘D’’ after his 
name. Why? Because we are Article I, 
and he is Article II. 
And the Founders gave us a free press 
to say we are going to have the press 
holding all of us to account, and the 
separation of power so we can hold the 
President to account. There is none of 
that here. 
Mr. BUCK. And one more thing, when 
the press holds us to account, we stand 
up. We may disagree with them. We 
may offer another version of the facts, 
but we don’t shut down the press. We 
don’t close their doors. We don’t turn 
off the TV station when they call 
something a war. When they call a war 
a war, we don’t shut them down. That 
is exactly what is happening in Russia 
right now. 
Mr. ROY. And the most important 
thing that we can do, in my opinion, is 
do what we are doing right here. And I 
hope all my colleagues will do this. 
And I hope everybody will unite. And I 
hope the American free press will 
unite, and the worldwide free press will 
unite, to call this out for what it is—a 
war criminal killing innocents for 
sheer power and for sheer determina-
tion of what he wants for his own agen-
da, not for any kind of honorable rea-
sons in defending his homeland. 
Whatever he is telling you and the 
people of Russia that this is somehow 
an honorable defense of Russia, it is 
not. He is lying to you. He is killing in-
nocent people in the name of your 
homeland. And you need to know that. 
And you need to know the truth. And 
you need to see what he is doing to 
people. 
And we, in this country, need to con-
tinue to do more. And I know we are 
here to talk about Putin, and we are 
here to talk about this situation of 
holding him accountable. And I don’t 
want to get too partisan here, but our 
country should have been doing more 
sooner. 
We should have been listening to 
Zelensky. I have heard a whole lot of 
applause lately for Zelensky from my

colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. But where were we last July 
when he was asking for help with sanc-
tions? 
Where were my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle when my former 
boss and my friend, Senator TED CRUZ, 
forced a vote in the Senate on Nord 
Stream 2? 
MIA. Partisan vote: We are not going 
to continue sanctions on Nord Stream 
2. We are going to go along with 
Biden’s decision to stop sanctions on 
Nord Stream 2. 
Well, what do you think happens 
when you allow Putin and Russia to 
have a complete control of the energy 
supply of Europe? 
What do you think is going to happen 
when you empower a thug and a dic-
tator? What do you think is going to 
happen? 
And right now today, we have a com-
plete refusal by my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, and frankly, too 
many colleagues on my side of the 
aisle, who refuse to say that we are, 
today, going to open up American en-
ergy, liquefied natural gas, oil, and 
produce it in this country to ensure 
that this man doesn’t have the power 
to do what he is doing in Ukraine. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 7 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, to go 
back a little bit in history, when Presi-
dent Putin invaded Crimea, President 
Obama refused to give legal assistance 
to Ukraine. It wasn’t until President 
Trump came in that legal assistance 
was given to Ukraine. 
And then to President Biden’s credit, 
he ramped up that lethal aid as the 
threat got greater. And we have seen a 
great deal of lethal aid going to the 
Ukraine military. They are using it 
wisely. They are fighting a courageous 
war against a much, much greater 
military power. 
But I agree with you, Congressman. 
We could be doing more. We could be 
sanctioning more, the source of Rus-
sia’s money, their income, their rev-
enue for waging this war. And we 
should be doing that. And that is just 
one of the areas, just one of them. 
We should be doing more in banking. 
We should be doing more in trade, in 
blockades. But one of the ways that we 
can sanction them is by producing 
more natural gas, more fossil fuels here 
at home. We should be shipping lique-
fied natural gas to our allies in West-
ern Europe to wean them off the reli-
ance on energy from Russia. 
Mr. ROY. How has the lawless au-
thoritarian managed to regain his 
power? Well, I will tell you. Europe 
made themselves completely dependent 
on Russian energy. 
And if you want a wake-up call and 
you want a warning shot in this coun-
try, Russia controls 40 percent of the 
EU’s natural gas and 30 percent of its 
oil. Germany buys more gas from Rus-
sia than any other country. 
They chose this. They chose fracking 
bans. They chose to shut down energy 
freedom in Western Europe. They chose 
to pursue a political climate ideology 
over national security and common-
sense and energy for their citizenry. 
And now, they are beholden to Russia. 
And now, we have empowered Russia. 
This stuff matters. Wars have been 
fought over these kinds of things, and 
we just empowered an autocrat to roll 
over the people of Ukraine because of 
the leadership of the Democrats on the 
other side of the aisle. And the people 
in this White House are pursuing cli-
mate ideology over national security; 
climate ideology over energy freedom; 
climate ideology over affordable gas; 
and the ability for the American people 
to thrive while empowering the people 
of Ukraine instead of a thug like Putin. 
Mr. BUCK. In addition to that, it is 
time that our allies in NATO step up, 
spend the money they are supposed to 
spend on their military, on their de-
fense structure, and move forward with 
us. It is not time for Americans to con-
stantly fight wars in other countries 
when other countries haven’t stepped 
up and recognized the dangers of a man 
like Vladimir Putin. 
I don’t know if it is the equivalent of 
our Secretary of Defense or Army Chief 
of Staff, or maybe the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, but the head of 
the German military mocked his own 
military, talking about how unpre-
pared they would be in the event of a 
conflict with Russia. 
Putin knows that. Putin has intel-
ligence agents. And they have scoured 
the Western European countries. They 
know exactly what the strength is of 
those countries. They know what their 
willingness is to fight. And Putin has 
made a decision that he can take 
Ukraine with very little consequence. 
That is a serious issue. 
Mr. ROY. You are exactly right. And 
tomorrow, we are going to be voting on 
a number of things. I got to be honest 
with you. I am sickened at what we are 
doing in this body. Instead of debating 
and voting here and having a serious 
discussion about how we should spend 
our assets to support Ukraine but be 
sensible about what we are doing in 
policies here, we are going to have a 
vote on banning Russian oil. 
What good does it do to ban Russian 
oil if you are going to buy it from Ven-
ezuela or Iran? 
b 2150 
Why don’t we produce it here in the 
United States? It is cleaner and it is 
better. We should be doing that right 
here. Instead, we are not going to do 
that. 
I am going to turn it back over be-
cause I think it is about time to close. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I just 
want to echo what he is saying and tell 
you that right now the dictator who is 
the most threatening to us, we are 
going to pull away from his energy and 
we are going to go with dictators who 
aren’t quite as dangerous to us. That 
isn’t a strategy. That is just looking at 
the wrong end of a revolver. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I just 
want to remind everyone that 51 kids 
are trapped after an orphanage is 
bombed and the director is killed. No 
heat or electricity. Cold front coming. 
That is Putin’s Ukraine. We should be 
helping these people. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his time tonight and 
it is always a pleasure to speak with 
him. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

THE MATH IS THE MATH IS THE 
MATH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) until 10 p.m. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
we have a bit of the tyranny of the 
clock, as you know, so I am going to 
try to do this somewhat rapidly. 
There has been a lot of speechifying 
today. I am frustrated because I don’t 
have an elegant or delicate way to say 
this, but people keep making crap up. 
Let’s actually walk through some basic 
math so we understand something. 
Does anyone here have any memory 
of last fall when a number of us were 
coming behind these microphones get-
ting ready to talk about the winter 
that was coming. Do you remember the 
discussion of about how high the power 
bills, the heating bills were going to 
be? It is because fuel prices—hydro-
carbon prices—didn’t just go up be-
cause of the Russian invasion. 
If you look at the charts, this began 
functionally when the left took power. 
It really began in 2018 and really took 
off when they had unified control. It 
didn’t just happen. As a matter of fact, 
there is a number of charts out there 
and futures contracts that were basi-
cally saying the prices you are seeing 
today at the gas pump—they just 
showed up about 6 months early—that 
that is actually where we were going 
because 
consumption 
and 
supply 
wasn’t keeping up because of what we 
have done to ourselves. 
You see it already. Do you not re-
member last October and September 
crossing $6 on natural gas? It was al-
ready coming at us and it was our own 
fault. How does this craziness happen? 
We keep getting folks coming behind 
the microphone and saying: It is be-
cause of the Keystone pipeline; it is a 
little bit. It is because of some of the 
drilling bans; it is a little bit. 
It is mostly because over, particu-
larly this last year, but also going back 
when the left took power after the 2018 
election, they basically started to 
threaten capital markets. If you are a 
company and you invest in hydro-
carbons, I think the SEC should look 
into you. If you’re CalPERS or a pen-
sion fund and you invest in hydro-
carbons, we are going to look down

upon that. As a matter of fact, we are 
going encourage universities and other 
pension funds no more investing in hy-
drocarbons. 
What did you think was going to hap-
pen? When you actually see this frus-
tration and the absolute distorted rhet-
oric coming from the White House— 
well, there are 9,000 drilling permits 
out there. I think most of America al-
ready understand that is lunacy; you 
get a permit, you find out if there are 
any hydrocarbons in the ground. But 
how do you go to capital markets and 
get any money to stick that straw in 
the ground? This continued. 
Over and over, the Biden administra-
tion’s executive orders missed the 
mark. It was actually talking about 
the Treasury coming at anyone that is 
putting capital markets into hydro-
carbons. Understand what you are pay-
ing at the gas pump, what you are pay-
ing to heat your house. You voted for 
this. 
If you voted for the left, if you voted 
for them in 2018, if you voted for them 
in 2020, you voted for this. You voted 
for that price because this is what they 
promised us. Do you remember the dis-
cussions here, the debates here? We are 
going to make it so you can’t raise 
money to finance a pipeline, to finance 
new hydrocarbon extractions, to fi-
nance natural gas. 
What is so ironic about this—just 
quote after quote after quote. Pension 
systems 
and 
others—the 
idea 
was 
strangle hydrocarbon extraction, oil 
and gas, and make it so they don’t 
have the capital to open up new wells, 
to invest in more efficiencies. The left 
actually got what they wanted. 
Are they now willing to admit that 
they got what they wanted there? We 
are now seeing $5 gasoline. You see the 
price of natural gas. Guess what, con-
gratulations, we burned 23 percent 
more coal last year because they made 
natural gas so expensive; we moved 
from one fuel source that was dramati-
cally cleaner than coal, but you raised 
the price so high. Remember, power 
generation is regulated. Power plant 
after power plant after power plant 
around America moved back to coal. 
So now you have the brain trust in 
the administration saying things like: 
Well, go buy an electric car. Except 
that electric car is going to be powered 
by 
coal 
because 
the 
dramatically 
cleaner burning fuel of natural gas you 
have just made really expensive. 
A couple of months ago we came here 
to the floor and talked about natural 
gas and the concerns the left has said 
over it—well, what about methane— 
showing them some breakthroughs of 
really inexpensive ways to capture that 
methane. 
There is a rational argument there. 
Methane is a 9–1, but has only now a 
shorter half life of what is considered 
to be a greenhouse gas. Instead of say-
ing, hey, we are going to look for tech-
nologies that deal with the problem 
there, the left’s opinion is, well, let’s 
wipe them out because those who in-
vest in green energy finance and write 
checks to Democrats. The green mafia 
basically owns the Democrat Party. 
Then you go look at other absurd-
ities that is Democrat policy. I am 
sorry I had to grab an older slide. Do 
you realize the amount of baseload nu-
clear we have in this country that is 
going off line? You do realize over this 
10-year period the United States is 
going to get dirtier? This is even before 
the left functionally raised the price of 
natural gas so much that power plants 
moved back to coal. 
We are moving so much clean base-
load nuclear off the grid that it doesn’t 
even offset every bit of photovoltaic 
and wind we have put on the grid. 
We give lots of pretty speeches here. 
We do lots of virtue signaling, but the 
math is the math is the math. The vir-
tue signaling creating policy has actu-
ally raised more greenhouse gases. 
Look what Germany did by shutting 
down its baseload nuclear. They now 
burn massive amounts of coal. They 
got dirtier. 
You have heard speech after speech 
here today about how much we despise 
Putin, but we also know his propa-
ganda wing absolutely supported the 
left’s movement to strangle these hy-
drocarbons. This is what you get when 
you make crappy policy. It didn’t hap-
pen overnight. It is going to take us 
years to fix this mess. 
Can I beg the Democrats: Stop hurt-
ing people. Stop making the poor poor-
er. Stop crushing the middle class. 
Come back to sensibility. Guess what, 
there might be a bonus there, and that 
is all the coal that is being burnt, all 
the dirty imports, you would actually 
get a benefit of the greenhouse gases, 
but you got to come back and do math 
again. 
Madam Speaker, I think I am up 
against my time and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report the bill by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3076) to provide stability to 
and enhance the services of the United 
States Postal Service, and for other pur-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
EMMETT TILL ANTILYNCHING ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
1922, the first robust antilynching bill 
was successfully passed by the House of 
Representatives. Once it came to the 
Senate, a block of Southern seg-
regationists mounted a filibuster to 
kill it in its tracks. 
Over the decades, similar bills met 
similar fates. Throughout the 20th cen-
tury, scores of antilynching bills were 
introduced, only to be promptly buried 
into obscurity. In 2018, Congress came 
closer than ever to finally passing 
antilynching legislation before it was 
thwarted at the eleventh hour. 
But last night, finally—finally—after 
more than 200 failed attempts to de-
clare lynching a Federal crime, the 
Senate succeeded in taking long, over-
due action by passing the Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act. 
Hallelujah. Congress has finally de-
clared lynching a Federal crime, as it 
should have done more than a century 
ago. That it took so long is a perma-
nent, bitter stain on American history; 
but, finally, a century’s worth of ef-
forts has now paid off. 
To say this is a historic accomplish-
ment is impossibly inadequate. Genera-
tions of civil rights leaders and advo-
cates dedicated their lives to getting 
Congress to recognize the humane, ob-
vious truth: that lynching was an in-
tolerable injustice inflicted primarily 
on disenfranchised Black Americans. 
Thousands upon thousands of Black 
Americans have been victims of lynch 
mobs across the country, and indif-
ferent States have rarely responded, if 
ever. Many of the sworn officers of 
these States and localities not only ig-
nored but often participated when 
these atrocities occurred. 
Despicable. Horrible. America should 
be so ashamed of this chapter in her 
history. And while no single congres-
sional action can fully erase the injus-
tices committed against victims of 
lynching, last night was an important 
step in the never-ending work of per-
fecting our Union. Only by confronting 
the darkest elements of our history can 
we make straight the path toward a 
brighter and more just future. 
I want to really applaud Senator 
BOOKER. He has been diligent and hard- 
working and valiant in getting this to 
happen. He had a great partner in Sen-
ator SCOTT—bipartisan. And on the

House side, the person who lit this can-
dle and kept it glowing even in the 
most disappointing of times was BOBBY 
RUSH. He never gave up. 
Congress has finally taken action, 
and this bill now heads to President 
Biden’s desk, finally—finally—for sig-
nature. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, now on COVID, 
Republicans and Democrats continue 
making good progress toward reaching 
a deal to fund the government. We are 
almost there. We are very, very close, 
and, hopefully, it will be done in the 
next few hours. 
This bill, the spending bill, comes at 
a consequential moment. War in Eu-
rope has focused the energies of Con-
gress into getting something done and 
getting it done fast, quickly. But one 
crucial element of the funding bill is 
getting less attention, and it is as im-
portant as just about anything in this 
bill. That is approving a new round of 
COVID preparedness funding. 
For all the important priorities we 
must address in this spending bill, I be-
lieve the COVID funding will go down 
as one of the most important—one of 
the most important—elements of the 
omnibus, and I have been pushing real-
ly hard to get it done, working across 
the aisle to convince our Republican 
colleagues that we need it. 
Now that all the Federal COVID aid 
under the American Rescue Plan has 
run out, approving new COVID funding 
is about insurance—far better to pre-
pare for new variants today than to 
play a frantic game of catchup tomor-
row, when it would be too late. We can-
not let it be said that America, after 
the third or fourth variant hits our 
shores, is unprepared; does not have 
adequate testing, therapeutics, vac-
cines. We cannot let that be said again. 
The first time it happened, of course, 
we were unprepared. We didn’t know 
what 
had 
happened. 
But, 
unfortu-
nately, even in the second and third, 
President Trump’s administration was 
not very eager to move forward, trying 
to ignore it, saying it didn’t really 
present a danger, which, of course, it 
has. 
So now Democrats and Republicans, 
thankfully, have come together, and 
both sides of the aisle have come to re-
alize that new COVID funding today is 
about insurance—far better to prepare 
today than play a frantic game of 
catchup tomorrow, when it is too late. 
The funding will support more vac-
cines, 
testing, 
therapeutics, 
and 
healthcare workers, and that is why I 
have been pushing so hard to get it 
done. 
Across the country, life is returning 
to normal, thankfully. Cases are fall-
ing. More people are going about with-
out masks. Restaurants, churches, and 
stores are filling up. I see that in my 
hometown of New York. Most impor-
tantly, classrooms are full; schools are 
staying open. 
Now that we are turning the corner, 
now that we are getting back to nor-
mal, the last thing we can afford to do 
is let our guard down, lest a new vari-
ant comes back with a vengeance and 
catapults us all back to square one, a 
place where we all do not want to be. 
Sadly, we know from experience that 
another variant is a very real possi-
bility. No one can say for certain how 
the virus will mutate, but today we 
have the tools and know-how to fight 
this virus the minute it hits our shores, 
while preserving as much of normal life 
as possible. 
All that is needed is the Federal 
funding, and $15 billion of that funding 
will be in the omnibus bill. So that is 
why I pushed so hard to get COVID 
funding into the spending bill. I am en-
couraged to see that Members have 
come around to recognize its impor-
tance, and I hope we can get it done 
very, very soon. 
Furthermore, I am pleased that we 
are likewise close—very close—to pass-
ing a strong and ample aid package 
that will help the people of Ukraine 
fight against Putin’s immoral war. 
They desperately need humanitarian 
aid, as millions of people are without 
food, without heat, without shelter, 
without medicine. They desperately 
need the arms to defend themselves 
against 
brutal 
Russian 
aggression, 
often viciously aimed at civilians who 
are escaping. We pledged to get some-
thing big done, and in the coming 
hours I expect we will be able to an-
nounce that we have followed through. 
H.R. 3076 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter—a lot is going on in the Senate this 
week—I am pleased to report that as 
soon as today the Senate is set to de-
liver for the post office. The post office 
usually delivers for us, but today we 
are going to deliver for them. 
Every single day, tens of millions of 
Americans rely on the post office for 
life’s daily essentials. Seniors and vet-
erans rely on it for their medication. 
Small business owners rely on it to 
keep their operations going. Small 
towns and rural Americans use it to 
stay connected, and every time we re-
ceive a wedding invitation, birthday 
message, or postcard from a relative, it 
is almost always the post office at 
work, making us happy, receiving 
those nice letters and birthday cards 
from brothers and sisters and relatives 
and friends from far-flung places. 
But we all know the frustrations of 
waiting on packages that fail to arrive 
on time. We all know that when the 
post office is forced to cut hours of op-
eration or delivery routes or lay off 
workers, the rest of us are worse off. 
Thankfully, for the past few months, 
Democrats and Republicans have been 
working together in good faith to re-
form some of the most troubled parts 
of the Postal Service. Now, we are only 
one rollcall vote away from sending 
this bill to the President’s desk, and 
that vote is likely to come today. 
After the Senate votes on this bill, 
we will happily be able to say that, fi-
nally, postal reform is signed, sealed, 
and delivered for the American people. 
I look forward to getting this done and 
thank my colleagues, especially Sen-
ators PETERS and PORTMAN, for their 
bipartisan work. 
COSTS 
Madam President, on costs—the costs 
that the American people face when 
they buy things weekly through their 
daily lives—yesterday, we saw another 
instance of Republicans going out of 
the way to show the American people 
where their priorities lie. 
A few months ago, the junior Senator 
from Florida callously called inflation 
a ‘‘gold mine’’ for the Republican 
Party. People are suffering and paying 
more, and the Senator from Florida 
says it is a ‘‘gold mine’’ for the Repub-
licans? 
A few weeks ago, we saw what he 
meant. That same Senator released a 
party platform that openly called for 
raising taxes on millions of American 
families, potentially by more than 
$1,000 a year. 
People can’t afford that. 
And, yesterday, the junior Senator 
from Wisconsin called for the GOP to 
revive their failed efforts to rip away 
affordable healthcare for tens of mil-
lions of Americans—a fresh reminder of 
an old desire that Republicans have 
harbored for over a decade. 
Cheerleading inflation, raising taxes 
on working Americans, repealing af-
fordable healthcare: Is that the plat-
form of today’s Republican Party? At 
this point, perhaps the Senator from 
Wisconsin should join the Senator from 
Florida in creating a new ‘‘Hurting 
Working Families Caucus’’ so we can 
more easily track their truly repres-
sive vision for the American people. 
Meanwhile, Democrats believe we 
should be lowering costs for Ameri-
cans, not raising them. We should be 
working on a bipartisan basis to fight 
inflation, not root for it to go up. So, 
tomorrow, Democrats will hold our an-
nual DPCC retreat to discuss our plan 
to lower costs, building on historic job 
growth, and expand opportunity for the 
middle class. 
Over the next few months, my col-
leagues will be holding hearings and 
markups on many of our cost-cutting 
proposals. Among the ideas we are 
working on are included bills to cap in-
sulin costs at $35 a month, lowering the 
cost of meat at the grocery store, re-
forming unfair shipping practices that 
raise the costs of American goods for 
everybody, and fixing domestic supply 
chains. 
These are issues that the American 
people need help with. It is what Demo-
crats will maintain a focus on. And I 
thank my Republican colleagues for 
helping us remind the American people 
which party truly stands in their cor-
ner. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1025 
March 8, 2022 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
as I mentioned yesterday, Senators had 
the chance to hear directly from 
Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy over 
the weekend. He and his constituents— 
the brave people of Ukraine—have won 
the hearts and minds of all of us all 
across the world. 
Their pain, of course, is Putin’s fault, 
but as I and others warned for weeks 
before the invasion, that pain has been 
compounded by the West’s hesitation 
and sluggishness in helping Ukraine 
prepare for this onslaught, which we 
could all see coming. This crisis was 
not only foreseeable; it was, in fact, 
foreseen. 
Republicans spent months urging 
President Biden to put more lethal aid 
in Ukrainian hands before Russian in-
vasion made those deliveries much 
more difficult. We urged the adminis-
tration to reinforce our eastern flank 
NATO partners before Putin escalated 
his war against Ukraine rather than 
playing catchup. We called for heavier 
sanctions before Putin had fully com-
mitted his forces and his pride. We 
warned repeatedly that the Biden ad-
ministration must not let these actions 
be slowed down to the speed of bu-
reaucracy. But that is, of course, what 
happened. 
As President Zelenskyy himself said 
publicly last week, while he appre-
ciates all the Western help, much of it 
is ultimately arriving ‘‘too late.’’ 
The Biden administration is now fi-
nally doing many of the things they 
slow-walked months ago as too provoc-
ative 
or 
too 
escalatory: 
providing 
Stingers, sharing intelligence, deploy-
ing more forces to NATO’s eastern 
flank, finally, getting out of the way of 
sanctioning Nord Stream 2. 
Now, as supplies dwindle and safe re-
supply and transit corridors narrow, 
friends of Ukraine will have to work 
even harder to help the citizens and 
their government stay in the fight. 
It has been obvious for some time 
that Ukraine would benefit from re-
ceiving Soviet-era aircraft and air de-
fense systems from our eastern flank 
NATO partners that still maintain in-
ventories of such weapons. The United 
States can help these allies worried 
about giving up such capabilities by 
helping to backfill with American- 
made and NATO-standard weapons. I 
understand the administration may be 
finally coming around to support this 
but, again, at the stately pace of bu-
reaucracy. This needs to get done and 
get done yesterday. 
(Mr. PADILLA assumed the Chair.) 
Meanwhile, the Congress is acting; 
that includes additional security as-
sistance funding for Ukraine and for 
our eastern flank NATO allies in the 
supplemental appropriations bill, along 
with funding for loan guarantees to 
help eastern flank countries buy Amer-
ican weapons to shore up our collective 
defenses. 
I appreciate the Democratic leader 
working in good faith to accommodate 
my request that the funding bill sig-
nificantly increase the security assist-
ance drawdown fund available to the 
President and to backfill our DOD 
stockpiles that are helping our friends 
in harm’s way. I hope we finalize those 
steps soon. 
This supplemental is urgent, but the 
fact is, the White House has, thus far, 
taken steps to limit their own options 
and made them miss the window to 
provide impactful assistance. This ad-
ministration not only reportedly re-
fused a request prior to the conflict to 
increase the number of U.S. military 
trainers in the country but moved the 
advisers we had to the far west of the 
country and then pulled them from the 
country entirely, like they also pulled 
out our entire diplomatic mission. 
These noncombat advisers could have 
helped facilitate more shipments of 
weapons to the field and more training 
to teach Ukrainians how to use them. 
They 
could 
have 
laid 
important 
logistical groundwork to ensure weap-
ons could continue to flow through the 
frontlines after the conflict began. 
In area after area, the record shows 
the Biden administration pulled their 
punches, even though everyone knew— 
knew—that the war was coming, and 
even so, the Ukrainians are mounting 
an incredible and brave resistance. 
Imagine where these brave people 
might be now if the administration had 
moved at the speed of necessity rather 
than the snail’s pace of bureaucracy. 
Now we must commit to keep lethal 
aid flowing. 
We have to continue strengthening 
NATO and deepening our security part-
nerships 
and 
interoperability 
with 
other European partners. We need to 
encourage more commitments like the 
German Chancellor’s recent announce-
ment that they will massively step up 
their investment in their own defense 
and in NATO. And perhaps most impor-
tant of all, we cannot have Washington 
politicians in the business of short-
changing our own defense spending at 
the very time when we are pleading 
with 
Western 
Europe 
to 
increase 
theirs. 
We have to lead by example and 
make the kind of robust investments 
needed for long-term competition with 
Russia and China. 
In the meantime, the sobering reality 
is that Ukraine is very likely to see 
more and escalating brutalities in the 
days and the weeks ahead. The world 
remembers the butchery in Grozny and 
the cold-blooded targeting in Aleppo, 
and the world will remember this mo-
ment as Russia sics conscripts on 
Ukrainian civilians and arrests its own 
people when they object. 
For all of the Kremlin’s lies about 
Ukraine, about how it is supposedly 
just an extension of Russia and its peo-
ple are really Russians, we now know 
for certain that Russians and Ukrain-
ians do have, in fact, at least one thing 
in common: Vladimir Putin considers 
their lives equally disposable. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, now on a related mat-
ter, the price of gas jumped more in the 
past week than any week on record. 
This, of course, began long before Rus-
sia invaded Ukraine. Even before that, 
families across America were paying 
dramatically higher gas prices than 
they faced when President Biden took 
office. I expect our Democratic friends 
will now try to blame the entire in-
crease in prices on our efforts to punish 
on Russia, but don’t be fooled. This is 
more than a year in the making. 
Back in November, President Biden’s 
Secretary of Energy was asked about 
any efforts—any efforts—to ramp up 
production of our own abundant Amer-
ican energy, and she literally laughed 
at the question. ‘‘That is hilarious,’’ 
Secretary Granholm said. 
The Secretary suggested that in-
creasing domestic production would be 
futile because the market for oil is 
global. Well, it sure is. But right now 
the free world is considering making 
this market a little bit less global to 
punish Russia for its brutal conquests 
in Ukraine. 
So it would sure be nice if America 
had gone into this crisis with more 
headroom on supply and on gas prices. 
Just 3 years ago, under Republican 
policies, we had become a net oil ex-
porter for the first time since World 
War II. 
But Democrats are completely com-
mitted to their ideological holy war on 
affordable energy. From the campaign 
trail, then-candidate Biden promised, 
‘‘I guarantee you we are going to end 
fossil fuel.’’ And in office, the Biden ad-
ministration has used its considerable 
Executive authority to actively target 
affordable American-made oil and nat-
ural gas. 
On his first day in office, the Presi-
dent canceled the pipeline project that 
would have sped the safe transport of 
reliable fuel. The very next week, he 
suspended all new Federal leases on oil 
and natural gas exploration. 
So 
Washington 
Democrats 
spent 
months trying to pass policies that 
would drive the most affordable, reli-
able, and abundant forms of America 
energy—and the jobs they support—lit-
erally into extinction. 
Just yesterday, as even our Western 
European friends are realizing that 
green fantasies can’t fuel their coun-
tries and are trying to turn back to-
ward nuclear, coal, and domestic nat-
ural gas, Biden administration officials 
gave a press conference where they re-
peated the same—the very same—plati-
tudes about renewables. 
You really can’t make this stuff up. 
The Democrats in charge of the United 
States of America want us to embrace 
the same failed strategies from which 
our European friends are frantically 
backpedaling as fast as they can.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1026 
March 8, 2022 
So while the Ukrainians are fighting 
Russia, Democrats are trying to fight a 
war on the law of supply and demand. 
They only want to have to look at 
solar panel and windmills here at 
home. So they want to get our oil and 
gas from everywhere else, but many of 
the biggest players in the global mar-
ket are countries that don’t much care 
for the United States. And now the 
Biden administration’s green hostility 
to domestic energy production has 
been going hat in hand begging our an-
tagonists to increase production. After 
spending a year hammering America’s 
own energy producers, the Biden ad-
ministration 
appears 
to 
be 
com-
mencing a world tour to try to buy oil 
from people who don’t like us. 
As I mentioned yesterday, the admin-
istration appears close to a deal that 
would help Iran enrich more nuclear 
material and enrich its economy by 
lifting oil export sanctions. 
Reports also suggest U.S. officials 
have met with the Maduro regime with 
the aim of relaxing sanctions on Ven-
ezuelan oil as well. This administration 
wants to ramp up energy imports from 
Iran and Venezuela? That is the world’s 
largest state sponsor of terror and a 
thuggish South American dictator, re-
spectively. 
So they would rather buy from these 
people than buy from Texas, Alaska, or 
Pennsylvania. Just let that sink in. 
The administration is also appar-
ently making similar overtures to 
Saudi Arabia. Obviously, the Saudis 
are not an adversary like these other 
countries, but I doubt the American 
people are thrilled to see President 
Biden trying to increase our depend-
ence on Middle Eastern oil and OPEC 
while declaring America’s own re-
sources off limits. 
A green light for the Arabian Gulf 
and a red one for the Gulf of Mexico— 
what sense does that make? The polit-
ical left thinks that affordable energy 
is dirty and bad so they are happy to 
export the dirty work and import the 
oil. Let’s ask our friends in Europe how 
that plays out. 
Outsourcing even more production to 
dictators and theocrats is not the an-
swer. Dumping more subsidies into 
solar panels and charging stations, 
praying everything works out, is not 
the answer. The answer is to let Ameri-
cans produce American energy. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it took 
several months and the worst inflation 
in 40 years, but finally—finally—Demo-
crats are acknowledging that we have 
an inflation problem. 
The President actually acknowledged 
inflation in the State of the Union last 
week. But, unfortunately, while Demo-
crats may finally be talking about in-
flation, they still don’t seem to under-
stand how we got here, and they are 
continuing to push a whole raft of ter-
rible proposals that would hurt work-
ing families and make our inflation 
crisis even worse. 
So how did we get here? Why are 
Americans currently struggling with 
huge grocery bills and big price in-
creases on essential goods? It is true 
that supply chain issues and the re-
opening of economies after COVID 
shutdowns created certain inflationary 
pressure, but a big part of the reason 
things are so bad in the United States 
right now is because of the American 
Rescue Plan spending spree the Demo-
crats passed last March. 
When Democrats took office last Jan-
uary, inflation was at 1.4 percent, well 
within the Fed’s target inflation rate 
of 2 percent. And it might have stayed 
there had Democrats not decided that 
they needed to pass a massive partisan 
$1.9 trillion spending spree under the 
guise of COVID relief—mere weeks, I 
might add—after Congress had already 
passed a major COVID bill. That is 
right. President Biden and congres-
sional Democrats took office right 
after Congress had approved a fifth— 
fifth—bipartisan COVID relief bill, and 
it was abundantly clear that we were 
not in immediate need of trillions more 
in government spending. 
But that didn’t matter to Democrats. 
Now that they were in control of Con-
gress and the White House, they want-
ed to take advantage of the COVID cri-
sis. So in the name of COVID relief, 
they pushed through a massive par-
tisan piece of legislation filled with un-
necessary spending and handouts to 
Democratic interest groups. 
And, of course, the results were pre-
dictable. The bill flooded the economy 
with unnecessary government spend-
ing, and the economy overheated as a 
result. In the words of Jason Furman 
in a January New York Times article, 
‘‘ ‘The United States has had much 
more inflation than almost any other 
advanced economy in the world,’ said 
Jason Furman, an economist at Har-
vard University and former Obama ad-
ministration economic adviser. The 
difference, he said, comes because ‘the 
United States’ stimulus is in a cat-
egory of its own.’ ’’ 
Unfortunately, Democrats seem un-
able—or unwilling—to recognize that it 
was their policies that helped push us 
into our current inflation crisis. In 
fact, the President used his State of 
the Union Address to push for even 
more—more—excessive 
government 
spending, a sure way of making our in-
flation crisis even worse—and not just 
increased in spending but major new 
entitlements. 
Yes, our Nation is massively in debt, 
inflation is soaring, and Democrats 
think now is a good time to create 
major new entitlements, and, of course, 
to raise taxes to pay for them. The 
President claims that he won’t raise 
taxes on anyone making less than 
$400,000, but that is not actually the 
case. Analysis of Build Back Better 
proposals reveals more than one tax 
hike would hit Americans with in-
comes below $400,000. And then there 
are the indirect costs. 
A centerpiece of the President’s tax 
plans is increasing taxes on corpora-
tions. While that may sound like a tax 
hike on the uber rich, the truth is that 
the burden of corporate tax hikes 
would fall heavily on ordinary workers 
in the form of lower wages, decreased 
job opportunities and retirement sav-
ings, and a less vibrant economy. 
The President likes to talk about tax 
fairness, about hiking taxes on cor-
porations and wealthy Americans so 
that they pay ‘‘their fair share.’’ Of 
course, 
he 
ignores 
the 
fact 
that 
wealthy Americans pay a dispropor-
tionately large share of taxes in this 
country and that the Federal Govern-
ment has seen a huge increase in cor-
porate tax receipts, thanks in part to 
business growth in the wake of the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act. 
All that aside, I find the President’s 
call for wealthy Americans to pay their 
fair share highly ironic considering the 
Democrats managed to include a tax 
break for wealthy Americans in their 
Build Back Better plan. That is right. 
The Democrats’ SALT proposal would 
overwhelmingly—overwhelmingly— 
benefit affluent taxpayers in high-tax 
States. Apparently, making wealthy 
Americans pay their fair share only ap-
plies to wealthy Republican Americans 
or until wealthy Democrats start ask-
ing for tax breaks. 
On the corporate tax side, in the 
State of the Union Address, the Presi-
dent highlighted the corporate min-
imum tax he is proposing. What he 
didn’t mention was that his corporate 
minimum tax isn’t actually a min-
imum tax at all. Thanks to the clean 
energy and affordable housing tax cred-
its the President is advocating, among 
other credits, companies that take ac-
tion on Democrats’ preferred policies 
could 
end 
up 
completely 
evading 
Biden’s so-called minimum tax. So 
much for making corporations pay 
their fair share. 
In his State of the Union Address, the 
President highlighted ‘‘the revitaliza-
tion of American manufacturing.’’ He 
said, ‘‘Companies are choosing to build 
new factories here when just a few 
years ago, they would have gone over-
seas.’’ He said that in the State of the 
Union speech. 
The revitalization of American man-
ufacturing is, indeed, something to cel-
ebrate. But, unfortunately, President 
Biden wants to undo the very tax poli-
cies that helped create the conditions 
for this manufacturing renaissance in 
the first place. 
Before Republicans passed the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, we were ex-
periencing a wave of inversions, which 
is a wonky way of saying that compa-
nies were moving their headquarters 
overseas. Why were companies moving

March 8, 2022 
overseas? Because of the punishing cor-
porate tax system we had in the United 
States. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act, the United States had the highest 
corporate tax rate in the developed 
world. That put American businesses 
at a real disadvantage next to their 
foreign counterparts, and it created a 
significant incentive for U.S. compa-
nies to move jobs or their entire com-
panies overseas. The Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act addressed this problem by lowering 
our Nation’s massive corporate tax 
rate and bringing the U.S. inter-
national tax system into the 21st cen-
tury. 
How did it work? Well, in the wake of 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, inversions 
stopped—stopped—and as the President 
pointed out, companies are building 
here in America. To quote the Presi-
dent of the National Association of 
Manufacturers: 
Reducing tax rates drove historic growth 
in the manufacturing sector. 
Unfortunately, if the President has 
his way, this manufacturing renais-
sance would likely drastically slow or 
come to an end altogether. Hiking 
taxes on American companies, as the 
President wants to do, would once 
again put American companies at a 
competitive disadvantage next to their 
foreign counterparts. 
If the President hikes corporate 
taxes, we won’t be seeing a surge of 
new building in America or companies 
keeping jobs here at home. Instead, we 
will be seeing fewer American jobs and 
more jobs and companies heading over-
seas. Democrats have already wreaked 
a lot of economic harm on American 
families with their American Rescue 
Plan spending spree. And the other 
policies that they are pushing and the 
tax hikes and new entitlements the 
President outlined in his State of the 
Union Address would prolong our infla-
tion crisis and do further damage to 
our economy and to American workers 
and families. 
I am glad the Democrats are finally 
recognizing that inflation is a problem, 
but it would have been nice if they 
could also recognize how their spending 
helped get us into this mess in the first 
place and how their current tax hike 
and spending plans would hurt Ameri-
cans and result in a less prosperous 
economy in the future. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
IRAN 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, much 
of the news media today is focused on 
Russia’s 
unprovoked 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine—and rightfully so—but not 
enough attention is being paid to nego-
tiations that are happening today and 
have been happening in Vienna. 
The Biden administration seems dead 
set on reviving, at any cost, the Iran 
nuclear deal. Worse, President Biden’s 
chief negotiator Rob Malley—who, I 
observe, is not a Senate-confirmed offi-
cial—outsourced our negotiations for 
reviving this flawed Iran deal to the 
Russians. This is outrageous. 
Let me get this straight. We are 
working hand in glove with Vladimir 
Putin to reach a deal that will help 
Russia evade sanctions being imposed 
for its aggression in Ukraine and work 
with its ally Iran. 
This is not the way to protect the 
safety and the interest of the American 
people. 
This is what Russia’s chief nego-
tiator to the Iran talks had to say 
about what he has accomplished for the 
Biden administration: 
I am absolutely sincere in this regard when 
I say that Iran got much more than it could 
expect, much more. 
He recently told reporters, adding: 
Realistically speaking, Iran got more than, 
frankly, I expected or others expected. This 
is a matter of fact. 
Again, this is Russia’s chief nego-
tiator making this statement. 
Most alarmingly, this revived deal 
would pave Iran’s path to a nuclear 
weapon. News reports also suggest that 
the revived deal would quickly unleash 
$90 billion in frozen funds to Iran— 
again, the world’s biggest state-sponsor 
of terrorism. Moreover, Iran can expect 
to earn roughly $50 billion annually in 
renewed oil exports. 
It is unconscionable that the Biden 
administration appears more eager to 
unleash the energy production in Ven-
ezuela and Iran than right here in 
America. The Biden administration is 
so stubborn and blinded by its ideolog-
ical green energy fantasies that it 
would rather work with terrorists and 
dictators—folks with some of the worst 
human rights records in history—than 
admit it was a mistake to abandon 
America’s energy independence. This 
administration would rather work with 
killers than with American drillers. 
As before, the Iranian regime will use 
this massive windfall of sanctions re-
lief to fund terrorism and aggression 
against our ally Israel, against our 
Arab partners, and against Americans 
serving in the Middle East. 
Let me be clear. The Trump adminis-
tration was right to withdraw us from 
the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2018. 
But I am not here today to debate the 
pros and cons of resurrecting the Iran 
deal. We will likely have that debate in 
the days to come, probably sooner than 
most people think. 
Rather, I am here today to argue for 
preserving the role that Congress— 
amid concerns that the Biden adminis-
tration will not submit their new Iran 
nuclear deal for review and for an up- 
or-down 
vote—that 
Congress 
must 
maintain its role as required by U.S. 
law. 
If news reports are to be believed, the 
Biden administration may be nearing 
the end of negotiations for an agree-
ment to resuscitate the Iran deal. As 
Reuters reported recently: 
The draft text of the agreement, which is 
more than 20 pages long, stipulates a se-
quence of steps to be implemented . . . 
In 2014 and 2015, many lawmakers 
passionately argued that the original 
Iran deal should have been submitted 
to the Senate as a treaty, requiring our 
advice and consent under the U.S. Con-
stitution. But because the Obama ad-
ministration refused to follow the Con-
stitution, Congress was compelled to 
enact the Iran Nuclear Agreement Re-
view Act, or INARA. INARA passed the 
Senate in a 99-to-1 vote—99 to 1. This is 
nearly unanimous, a bipartisan vote 
that reflects how frustrated the Senate 
is that the executive branch was trying 
to circumvent Congress on such an im-
portant matter. INARA clearly re-
quires that any agreement—I repeat, 
any agreement—related to the nuclear 
program of Iran should be submitted to 
the Senate and to the House for con-
gressional review, including for an up- 
or-down vote. 
It is beyond debate that the Biden 
administration is required by law to 
submit any new agreement for reviving 
the Iran deal to Congress for congres-
sional review, but the Biden adminis-
tration has not clearly committed that 
it will submit whatever agreement it is 
negotiating in Vienna for our review 
and an up-or-down vote by Congress. 
If the Biden administration refuses 
to submit its new Iran agreement to 
Congress, it will be ignoring the law 
and undermining the role of this body 
in foreign policy. 
Last year, I was concerned this 
might happen. That is why I intro-
duced the Iran Sanctions Relief Review 
Act of 2020. My bill borrows a provision 
from the Countering America’s Adver-
saries 
Through 
Sanctions 
Act, 
or 
CAATSA, an act that overwhelmingly 
passed Congress in 2017. 
The CAATSA provision allows for 
congressional review and an up-or- 
down vote on any Presidential waiver 
of Russia’s sanctions. My bill takes 
word-for-word that same provision and 
applies it to any Presidential waiver of 
Iran sanctions. This is important be-
cause any new agreement to revive the 
Iran deal will require once again the 
executive branch to waive Iran sanc-
tions. In other words, my bill protects 
the role of Congress if the executive 
branch ignores INARA and refuses to 
submit the new agreement to the Sen-
ate and to the House. 
So far, 37 Senators have cosponsored 
the Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act 
with me. This number is significant be-
cause 37 Senators would be more than 
enough to deny the Senate’s advice and 
consent if the executive branch actu-
ally followed the Constitution and pre-
sented a new Iran agreement to the 
Senate as a treaty. 
I urge my colleagues who have not 
yet cosponsored the Iran Sanctions Re-
lief Review Act to join me and to do so. 
We must protect the first branch of 
government from an executive branch 
that seeks to encroach upon it or even 
to ignore it. 
I also remind the Biden administra-
tion, the Iranian regime, and the world 
of a fact that should be patently obvi-
ous by now: Any agreement to revive 
the Iran nuclear deal that lacks the 
Senate’s advice and consent under the

Constitution—that is, that lacks the 
support of 67 Senators—will not sur-
vive multiple Presidential administra-
tions. It will be ripped up just like it 
was the last time. And I have zero 
doubt that, as before, the next Presi-
dential administration will end this 
deal again and will snap back sanc-
tions—with a vengeance—against the 
Iranian regime and those countries 
that were foolish enough to trade with 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
have come to the floor to speak in sup-
port of the Postal Service Reform Act, 
which is now pending before the Sen-
ate. 
The mission of the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice since the Continental Congress ap-
pointed Benjamin Franklin as our Na-
tion’s first Postmaster General in 1775 
has been to ‘‘bind the Nation to-
gether.’’ 
So it sounds kind of like a pretty 
quaint, outdated idea, but it is actually 
serious; it is actually statutory. 
And 39 U.S.C. tasks the Postal Serv-
ice with binding our Nation together 
by delivering all of our mail to every 
American promptly, reliably, and effi-
ciently, no matter where we live. 
The Postal Service Reform Act will 
improve the Agency’s ability to meet 
that requirement, including in large, 
geographically 
remote 
places, 
like 
Alaska, where it certainly has a sig-
nificant impact on our lives. 
We count on the Postal Service to de-
liver not only the letters and the mag-
azines and the bills, but also neces-
sities of life: food, medicine, business 
inventory, spare parts. Just about any-
thing you could possibly think of for 
daily life comes to us in Alaska 
through the mail service. 
The Postal Service is unique in its 
universal service obligation and the 
fact that it delivers both mail and 
packages to Americans in every com-
munity, whether you live in Key West, 
FL, or Utqiagvik, AK. No other Federal 
Agency or commercial enterprise does 
this. 
But it is becoming more and more 
difficult for the Postal Service to ac-
complish the swift completion of their 
appointed rounds, as we recall. 
And believe me, I certainly hear 
about the Postal Service’s decreasing 
ability to provide its services prompt-
ly, reliably, and efficiently. I hear 
about it as soon as I get off the air-
plane when I get back home. I hear 
from individuals all over the State, 
telling me the concerns that they have 
about mail that is late or perhaps not 
delivered at all. 
Our phones ring in our offices around 
the State because a small post office 
has been closed for a period of days be-
cause the postmaster has left, and 
there is no replacement available. 
I hear about the long lines to pick up 
mail, the long lines to just even buy a 
stamp in some of our smaller commu-
nities that get inundated by tourists in 
the summer. 
So we know. We hear the strains on 
our Postal Service. Despite postal 
workers’ dedication, the fact of the 
matter is that the Agency is in trouble, 
and it needs the reforms that are con-
tained in the bill that is pending before 
us. 
While many Americans believe the 
Postal Service is supported by the 
American taxpayer, that is not the 
case. Congress only reimburses it for 
mailing audio books to the blind and 
ballots to overseas voters. That is it. 
The Postal Service has to meet its 
payroll and fund retiree health bene-
fits; maintain its facilities, equipment, 
and vehicles; deliver the mail to its 
destination on time with its own rev-
enue from the sale of postage. But 
their financial instability is making 
those responsibilities harder and hard-
er to fulfill. 
So we are debating this legislation on 
the floor today to give the Postal Serv-
ice the tools that it needs to be suc-
cessful and to fulfill its essential mis-
sion and to hold the USPS accountable 
for improved performance because we 
all want to see that. 
So this legislation that we will hope-
fully vote on later today is not without 
controversy. 
Reform 
legislation 
is 
never without controversy, but that is 
why I appreciate the opportunity to 
outline what I think are some of the 
positive provisions. 
Importantly, the bill increases the 
Postal Service’s accountability for on- 
time delivery and requires greater 
transparency in achieving the goal. 
The bill requires that mail delivery not 
only be prompt and economical but 
also consistent and reliable and pro-
vided in a manner that increases oper-
ational efficiency. 
It requires the USPS to develop a 
new, searchable public performance 
dashboard that is updated weekly so 
both Congress and the public can keep 
a close eye on whether or not they are 
living up to our expectations. 
It also requires new regular reporting 
to the Postal Regulatory Commission, 
the PRC, and to Congress on a variety 
of indicators, including the impacts of 
price changes and information about 
reliability, efficiency, and cost effec-
tiveness, Postal workforce recruitment 
and retention, and how investments in 
equipment and infrastructure are im-
pacting service. 
In addition, the PRC and the Postal 
Service’s inspector general must iden-
tify why there are inefficiencies in the 
collection, sorting, transportation, and 
delivery 
of 
large 
envelopes, 
news-
letters, and magazines. 
These findings will be reported to 
Congress and the Postmaster General. 
USPS would then have 6 months to put 
in place PRC-approved changes that 
will fix whatever faults may have been 
found. 
The bill will also do what many of us 
have advocated for, which is reform the 
cost of healthcare for USPS employees 
and their retirees. 
So it provides needed stabilization 
for the USPS health benefits system, 
and, hopefully, it will relieve the pres-
sure on their budget and support sus-
tainable benefits for employees and re-
tirees. This is a key provision. 
The bill also codifies an appropria-
tions rider that has long required the 
USPS to integrate the delivery of let-
ters and packages for 6-day delivery 
and includes a fair compromise on the 
attribution of costs for processing and 
delivering packages. 
One of the—I guess—top complaints 
that I hear from Alaskans is that the 
cost of shipping via commercial pack-
age services is oftentimes more than 
the price of the item itself. Integrated 
delivery of mail and packages saves the 
U.S. Postal Service money by allowing 
it to be more efficient. 
And while UPS and FedEx charge 
most Alaskans extra for delivering 
their packages, these companies then 
drop their packages off in Anchorage at 
that hub and let the Postal Service 
take care of what we call last mile de-
livery. Well, in Alaska, that often 
means the last several hundred miles. 
Now, some are concerned that USPS 
subsidizes the cost of packages with 
revenue derived from delivering let-
ters. But in fact, the law that we 
passed in 2006, the Postal Account-
ability and Enhancement Act, forbids 
the Postal Service from cross-sub-
sidizing revenue to make sure that it is 
competing 
fairly 
with 
commercial 
package carriers. 
Current law also requires that pack-
age delivery covers all of its attrib-
utable costs, and while the Postal Reg-
ulatory Commission and the Federal 
courts have examined and upheld the 
cost 
attribution 
methodology, 
the 
Postal Service Reform Act requires yet 
another look, which I think is probably 
a fair compromise. 
Importantly for Alaskans and for me, 
this legislation will not result in cost 
increases for the essential bypass mail 
program. This is what it says it is. It is 
essential. It is a program that allows 
rural Alaskans who live in commu-
nities that are not connected by 
roads—about 80 percent of our commu-
nities are in that situation—but allows 
them to receive pallets of food, what-
ever necessary mailable matter that 
comes from stores in Anchorage or 
Fairbanks, without millions of indi-
vidual boxes of goods going through 
Postal facilities. And that benefits the 
consumer, and it saves the Postal Serv-
ice tens of millions of dollars a year in 
operating costs and untold millions in 
facility costs. 
While the Postal Service Reform Act 
directs the PRC to engage in another 
review of attributable costs, I have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1029 
March 8, 2022 
been assured by both sides of the 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committee, by the PRC, and by 
the Postal Service that this provision 
will not impact bypass mail, and I cer-
tainly intend to hold them to their 
word. 
Another concern that I want to ad-
dress over this bill is allowing USPS to 
partner with State, local, and Tribal 
governments to provide nonpostal serv-
ices. Now, I understand where this 
comes from, but this legislation spe-
cifically requires that any nonpostal 
services must cover their own costs 
without any degradation to regular 
Postal services. 
So, in my view, if the U.S. Postal 
Service can help deliver additional 
services to the American public under 
these two caveats, then they should be 
allowed to do so. 
So H.R. 3076 is a big step forward in 
helping the Postal Service achieve fi-
nancial stability. It will enable the 
Agency to continue to bind the Nation 
together with efficient and cost-effec-
tive universal service and allow postal 
employees to achieve the swift comple-
tion of their appointed rounds. It is 
supported by a wide array of busi-
nesses, both large and small, all who 
rely on our Postal Service. It is sup-
ported by Postal employees, by retired 
Federal employees, and the Postal 
Service itself. 
It has received overwhelming bipar-
tisan support in the House of Rep-
resentatives. I certainly hope that it 
will draw the same here in the Senate, 
and I want to commend the chairman 
of the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs, as well 
as Ranking Member PORTMAN, for the 
good work that they have done in 
bringing this bill to us today. 
(Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.) 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 
Madam President, now, while I am 
still here on the floor, I want to take 
just a moment and acknowledge that 
today, March 8, marks International 
Women’s Day. 
This is a day for us to recognize the 
achievements and the contributions 
that women are making in commu-
nities across the globe, and, as an Alas-
kan, I am going to start local first, be-
cause I have got so many, many phe-
nomenal women in my State who are 
doing incredible things, and I am ex-
ceptionally proud of them. 
I was home over the weekend. We 
were celebrating the start of the 50th 
running of the Iditarod race. This is an 
extraordinary feat of just strength and 
grit and determination and resilience. 
There were 49 mushers that left Wil-
low on Sunday; 17 of those mushers 
who will make the trek to Nome are 
women—17 women. So we have got a 
very, very strong field, but running a 
race like this, where it is the musher 
and your team of dogs going through 
the wilderness of Alaska—we have got 
deep snow throughout. The moose are 
not in a very cooperative mood right 
now. There are dangers along the trail, 
and who knows what the conditions are 
going to be like a week from now. And 
so it takes an extraordinary individual. 
And to know the strength of women, 
as they have taken on the Iditarod— 
when 
award-winning 
or 
world-re-
nowned winner Susan Butcher first 
won that race—she has won that race 
four times—but when she ran it about 
three decades ago, there was a popular 
bumper sticker that was going around 
the State at the time. It was, ‘‘Alaska, 
where men are men and women win the 
Iditarod.’’ We were pretty proud of 
Susan Butcher. We are hoping that our 
women do well and all of our mushers 
do well. 
But like these female mushers who 
are racing, women leaders are virtually 
in every field, from healthcare to re-
source development, to fishing, to our 
universities, and everything in be-
tween, and many of us are very proud 
to know that they have become some-
what household names, some of them. 
This year, we were able to celebrate 
Emma Broyles, a young woman from 
Anchorage, 20 years old. She became 
the first Alaskan and the first Korean 
American to ever be crowned Miss 
America in the 100-year history of that 
event. So we are very proud of her. I 
was able to celebrate with her this 
weekend at the Iditarod itself. 
Another young woman that we have 
celebrated this past year is Lydia 
Jacoby. Lydia is from Seward, AK, and 
at 17, she competed in her first Olym-
pics. She brought home the gold medal 
for this country, winning the 100-meter 
breaststroke race. So we were all eyes 
on Lydia. So proud of her. 
And there are so many who deserve 
our thanks and our gratitude. I always 
like to give a shout-out to an excep-
tional leader in our State, who has pro-
vided critical leadership and guidance 
throughout the pandemic, Dr. Anne 
Zink. 
It is so important to know that it is 
not necessarily finishing at the end of 
a race or a crown or a medal. It is just 
the endurance that goes with the day- 
to-day completion of your work. 
I was on the floor just last month to 
recognize the work of Native civil 
rights advocate Elizabeth Peratrovich, 
who pushed the Territory of Alaska, 
our legislature at the time, to pass the 
first antidiscrimination act in the Na-
tion. We did this in 1945. We are so 
proud of how she, as a Native woman 
leader, made our State and our Nation 
a more inclusive and more representa-
tive democracy. 
So, today, on International Women’s 
Day, it gives us an opportunity to rec-
ognize the impressive feats that women 
have taken on and have accomplished. 
It is a day to thank women for their 
daily contributions—again, both big, 
where they win the awards and they 
make the headlines, but also for those 
day-to-day 
contributions 
that 
they 
make to raising healthy, strong chil-
dren, to being the fabric in the family, 
to being that contributor in the work-
place. 
But this isn’t a day that we just look 
back and recognize those who have 
made great accomplishments. It is also 
a day that we look ahead at the work 
that we have to do to continue to ad-
vance equality and justice for all 
women. 
Just down the hallway from here in 
the Rotunda is the Portrait Monument. 
We all see it; we walk by it; and maybe 
we don’t even notice it anymore but 
take a look at it next time. We know 
the pioneering women who are rep-
resented on it: Lucretia Mott, Eliza-
beth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. An-
thony. 
But we need to look at it more care-
fully, and we need to remember there is 
a fourth bust that Adelaide Johnson 
did not sculpt, and the base of the 
monument is also unfinished. It is a re-
flection of the unfinished struggle for 
women’s rights and equality. 
So for all the progress that we have 
made, and we know it has been consid-
erable, Madam President, as you are 
sitting in that chair and this woman 
from Alaska is addressing you—we 
have made great progress, but the 
struggle is unfinished. 
The data documents the gaps in gen-
der equality in our country, and too 
many women feel it firsthand in their 
daily lives. So on International Wom-
en’s Day, I also want to remind the 
Senate of a couple important ways that 
we can help further women’s rights. 
And I am pleased that my colleague 
Senator CARDIN is on the floor at this 
moment because we have been working 
together. We have been working to-
gether to try to do this unfinished 
business when it comes to ratification 
of the Equal Rights Amendment, to en-
sure women’s equality is expressly rec-
ognized in our Constitution. 
Three-quarters of the States have 
now ratified that amendment. Alaska 
did it back in 1972, Virginia most re-
cently in 2020. I am hopeful that its 
time has come. 
And to help facilitate that, Senator 
CARDIN and I have introduced a resolu-
tion to remove the arbitrary ratifica-
tion deadline from the ERA so it can fi-
nally take effect. I think the Senate 
needs to take this resolution up and 
pass it like the House of Representa-
tives did last year. 
Another step—a critical step—that 
we must take now is the reauthoriza-
tion of the Violence Against Women 
Act to help ensure that there is a path 
to justice for survivors of interpersonal 
violence. 
I was very proud to introduce the 
new VAWA bill with Senator DURBIN, 
Senator ERNST, and Senator FEINSTEIN 
last month. I am pleased—so pleased— 
that we have 22 total cosponsors, 11 
from each party. 
Our bipartisan bill modernizes the 
nearly three decades’ old Violence 
Against Women Act, and it reauthor-
izes important programs that provide 
services to survivors. It directs re-
sources to prevent further violence and 
hold perpetrators accountable for their

actions. And it takes needed and im-
portant steps to address domestic vio-
lence, sexual assault, dating violence, 
and stalking. 
I mentioned dating violence. We have 
a provision that I have included and we 
have named after an Alaskan victim of 
dating violence, and that is Breanna 
Moore. 
We focused on improving access to 
medical forensics for victims of vio-
lence, including through training for 
medical professionals that will allow 
them to provide evidence-based and 
trauma-informed care. 
We have a strong Tribal title in this 
VAWA bill. It builds on VAWA 2013 by 
closing the gaps in the law to protect 
Native people. The Tribal title also in-
cludes an Alaska pilot program which 
provides a targeted solution to help 
empower Tribes in a way that recog-
nizes the unique and complex jurisdic-
tional landscape that we have in my 
State. It is a recognition that Tribes 
are valuable partners. They are critical 
partners that can play a larger role in 
providing public safety while reducing 
the burden on my State. 
As I have said many times before, 
there should be nothing—nothing—par-
tisan about keeping people safe from 
violence. And our VAWA reauthoriza-
tion is a result of many years of hard 
work and negotiations by advocates 
and stakeholders alike. I hope that we 
can consider this and pass this very, 
very soon. 
I recognize the great work of Senator 
ERNST on our side and Senator DURBIN 
and Senator FEINSTEIN on the other 
side of the aisle. It has been an effort 
that is timely, is needed, and is nec-
essary. 
So I am happy to be able to recog-
nize, for just a few moments on this 
International Women’s Day—as we cel-
ebrate the many, many incredible 
women in our lives and in our country, 
we also recognize that our work for 
true equality remains unfinished, but 
we have got some good paths forward if 
we can just try. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, 
let me thank Senator MURKOWSKI for 
her leadership on behalf of women’s 
issues here in the U.S. Senate. I join 
her in calling for the reauthorization of 
the Violence Against Women’s Act. I 
am glad that she mentioned that. I join 
her as her partner in the ratification of 
the Equal Rights Amendment. We have 
to pass a resolution here extending the 
date. Senator MURKOWSKI has been a 
leader on all these issues. 
During Women’s History Month, I am 
using this time to point out the 
progress we have made. Senator MUR-
KOWSKI mentioned that we have made 
tremendous progress on behalf of gen-
der equality in the United States, but 
we still have a path in front of us. I was 
pleased to see Senator MURKOWSKI 
point out the challenges that still exist 
and the reason why we need to be ac-
tive in regard to gender equity issues, 
including the reauthorization of the 
Violence Against Women Act and the 
passage of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment. So I thank her for her leader-
ship, and I am glad to be her partner on 
many of these issues. 
So today, we can celebrate the 
progress that has been made and call 
attention to the obstacles that exist. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, gen-
erations of women have won hard- 
fought battles in pushing closer and 
closer toward securing full citizenship 
and all that entails. 
Our Nation today is stronger from 
this progress, reaching new milestones 
in gender equality. President Biden an-
nounced earlier this month his historic 
selection of Judge Jackson to fill the 
role of the retiring Supreme Court Jus-
tice Breyer on the highest Court in our 
land. Judge Jackson would be the first 
Black woman to serve on the Court and 
only the fifth woman to serve as a Jus-
tice of the total of 115 who have served 
on the Supreme Court throughout our 
history. 
I was pleased, along with Senator 
VAN
HOLLEN, to recommend Lydia 
Griggsby to serve on the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Maryland. She 
is the first Black female judge to serve 
in the State of Maryland. 
Yes, we have a lot to celebrate during 
Women’s History Month here in March. 
During 
President 
Biden’s 
recent 
State of the Union Address, which I at-
tended, I was struck by the image of 
House Speaker NANCY PELOSI and Vice 
President KAMALA
HARRIS
flanking 
President Biden. Vice President HARRIS 
is our first woman and first woman of 
color to hold the second highest office 
in the land. Though they undoubtedly 
both experienced significant challenges 
and obstacles on their career path due 
to their gender, they are now serving 
in two of the highest ranking offices in 
our government. 
President Biden has appointed one of 
the most diverse Cabinets in history, 
including the first women to serve as 
Treasury Secretary and Director of Na-
tional Intelligence. 
We have a lot to celebrate on our 
path for gender equality in America, 
but we still have more that needs to be 
done. 
At the same time, structural dis-
advantages and inequalities on account 
of gender persist across so many areas 
here in America. As one example, as 
chair of the Small Business Entrepre-
neurship Committee, where the Pre-
siding Officer also serves, I have been 
working over the course of the COVID– 
19 pandemic to understand the eco-
nomic effects on small businesses and 
to help provide needed resources. In 
this role, I have seen firsthand the 
structural disadvantages experienced 
by women-owned small businesses and 
how they have been compounded by the 
challenges of this pandemic. We need 
to take action to help in regard to that 
issue. 
Further, the Supreme Court actions 
to date in cases related to reproductive 
freedom indicate an alarming openness 
to overturning the precedents that 
have given women control over their 
own bodies and futures for decades. 
Among many other very important 
reasons, full reproductive autonomy is 
essential in ensuring that women are 
able to participate fully as citizens in 
all facets of our democracy. 
I am pleased that President Biden es-
tablished the first Gender Policy Coun-
cil to advance gender equity across the 
entire Federal Government and that 
the Gender Policy Council issued the 
first-ever national gender strategy to 
support the full participation of all 
people, including women and girls in 
the United States and around the 
world. 
Yes, we have unfinished business in 
regard to gender equity issues. I am 
committed to working to advance the 
Equal Rights Amendment that Senator 
MURKOWSKI talked about. The two of us 
are the lead sponsors of the resolution 
in this body that would remove the ar-
bitrary time limit. 
This simple amendment, the Equal 
Rights Amendment, first written by 
Alice Paul in 1923, states: 
Equality of rights under the law shall not 
be denied or abridged by the United States or 
any state on account of sex. The Congress 
shall have the power to enforce, by appro-
priate legislation, the provisions of this arti-
cle. 
I can’t understand any objection to 
including that fundamental protection 
in the Constitution of the United 
States. 
As President Biden stated in his 
Presidential Proclamation during this 
Women’s History Month, ‘‘But despite 
the progress being made, women and 
girls—especially women and girls of 
color—still face systemic barriers to 
full participation and wider gaps in op-
portunity and equality . . . The Con-
gress sent the Equal Rights Amend-
ment to the States for ratification 50 
years ago and it is long past time that 
the 
principle 
of 
women’s 
equality 
should be enshrined in our Constitu-
tion.’’ 
And as Senator MURKOWSKI said, the 
requisite number of States have rati-
fied the Equal Rights Amendment to 
the Constitution. The arbitrary time 
limit that was put on by Congress is 
the only reason we haven’t had a cer-
tification process. 
The vast majority of Americans 
agree with this principle today. A 2020 
AP poll found that 74 percent of Ameri-
cans—74 
percent—favor 
the 
Equal 
Rights Amendment. A second spring 
poll conducted by Pew found that 78 
percent of respondents were in support 
of adding women to the Constitution. 
In a nation as divided as ours has be-
come, a principle with this level of sup-
port on this important topic compels 
our attention and our action. 
Given that so much has changed 
since this amendment was first written 
and since it was first proposed by Con-
gress to the States, it is worth explain-
ing some of the practical effects it

could have if formalized today. First, it 
would expand legal recourse against 
gender 
discrimination. 
Second, 
it 
would empower those of us in Congress 
to enact stronger laws preventing gen-
der discrimination across a wide array 
of issues. Third, it would require the 
Supreme Court—or courts—to use a 
higher standard of review than is cur-
rently applied in the cases of gender 
discrimination. 
The ratification of the ERA could be 
expected to have effects across such di-
verse areas as pay discrimination, 
LGBTQ rights, gender-based and do-
mestic violence, sexual harassment, 
and more. This constitutional amend-
ment would provide a firmer founda-
tion for existing laws and create new 
authority for Congress to pass laws in 
areas in which it has historically 
lacked a constitutional prerogative. 
Our Constitution is a framework of, 
by, and for the people. It must be able 
to evolve to meet the changing views 
and beliefs of the people. Already a ma-
jority of the U.S. Senate has cospon-
sored the bipartisan resolution that I 
referred to, S.J. Res. 1, that Senator 
MURKOWSKI and I introduced to remove 
the procedural deadline that Congress 
once set to honor the clear will of the 
people and to make the legitimacy of 
our 28th Amendment clear beyond a 
doubt. 
The House of Representatives has al-
ready passed this resolution twice. It is 
time for us to do the same. I look for-
ward to the opportunity to bring this 
resolution to the floor in the coming 
months and would strongly urge every 
one of my colleagues to support that 
resolution. Thirty-eight States have al-
ready ratified it. Most Americans al-
ready think it is in our Constitution. 
Let’s get that job done. 
BICENTENNIAL BIRTH OF HARRIET TUBMAN 
Madam President, March 8, as has 
been pointed out, is International 
Women’s Day. It happens during the 
month of March, which is Women’s His-
tory Month, here in the United States. 
I wish to commemorate the bicenten-
nial birth of one of Maryland’s most 
iconic leaders, a true American hero 
who has inspired global human rights’ 
defenders, and that is Harriet Tubman. 
As we close this year’s chapter of 
Black History Month and ring in Wom-
en’s History Month, what better way to 
celebrate these annual observances 
than by honoring the valor, journey, 
and life of Harriet Tubman and her 
fight for freedom, which intersects 
with our modern-day fight for civil 
rights, climate action, and environ-
mental justice. 
Harriet Tubman was born Araminta 
Ross in Dorchester County, MD, along 
our Eastern Shore, around 1822. She 
was the ‘‘Moses of her people,’’ person-
ally leading at least 70 enslaved people 
to freedom. She is a cherished daughter 
of Maryland. She did this at great per-
sonal sacrifice to her own safety and 
freedom on the Eastern Shore of Mary-
land. 
This year, in 2022, we observe the bi-
centennial of the start of her life as a 
key leader in the abolition and wom-
en’s suffrage movements. She embodied 
extraordinary courage and took im-
measurable risks as a soldier, spy, and 
conductor on the Underground Rail-
road, leading her family and commu-
nities to freedom. In an unjust country 
to her race, she was there, working for 
America’s future and helping to lib-
erate the enslaved people. 
In Maryland, this year also marks 
the 5-year anniversary of the Harriet 
Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor 
Center, which opened its doors to the 
public in 2017. In its first year, it drew 
nearly 100,000 visitors from every State 
and more than 70 countries, exceeding 
all expectations. It is inspirational to 
see this visitor center and to see her 
journey through life and what she was 
able to accomplish. One person can 
make a difference. As Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., told us frequently, 
‘‘Each one of us in this world can make 
a difference.’’ Harriet Tubman made 
such a difference throughout her life-
time. 
The visitor center houses exhibit 
space that shares Tubman’s compelling 
story, surrounded by landscape and wa-
terways preserved to resemble how 
they would have appeared to her over 
200 years ago in her early life as an 
enslaved child, young woman, and free-
dom seeker. The Harriet Tubman Un-
derground Railroad National Monu-
ment and National Historical Park pre-
serve these characteristics in her early 
home on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. 
The visitor center serves as an ori-
entation center to the national monu-
ment and historical park and gateway 
to the larger Harriet Tubman Under-
ground Railroad Scenic Byway, which 
includes the Brodess Farm, where Har-
riet Tubman lived as a child; Bucktown 
General Store, where she first stood up 
against the oppressors as a young girl; 
and other places that were part of the 
Underground Railroad in Dorchester, 
Talbot, and Caroline Counties. 
I recently introduced legislation with 
my colleagues in the Baltimore con-
gressional delegation, S. 3744, reauthor-
izing the designations of the Baltimore 
National Heritage Area, which encom-
passes listings on the Underground 
Railroad network. 
Harriet Tubman was not only a fierce 
defender for freedom from slavery but 
also for the women’s rights movement, 
particularly for Black women. Fol-
lowing her treacherous journey to free-
dom, Harriet Tubman spoke on the im-
portance of women’s suffrage in New 
York, Washington, and Boston. In 1896, 
she was one of the first guests to speak 
at the National Association of Colored 
Women and was hailed a strong advo-
cate. Women secured the right to vote 
in 1920 with the 19th Amendment, but 
it wasn’t until 1965 that voting rights 
became a reality for Black women. 
Let me conclude my comments on 
Women’s History Month by once again 
quoting from President Biden. 
As President Biden proclaimed Wom-
en’s History Month this month, he 
said: 
As we reflect on the achievements of 
women and girls across the centuries and 
pay tribute to the pioneers who paved the 
way, let us recommit to the fight and help 
realize the deeply American vision of a more 
equal society where every person has a shot 
at pursuing the American dream. In doing 
so, we will advance economic growth, our 
health and safety, and the security of our 
Nation and the world. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING SERGEANT JOSHUA CAUDELL 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
have the privilege of being with my fel-
low Senator, TOM COTTON, as we rise 
today to honor two Arkansans who 
gave their lives in service to others re-
cently. 
Arkansas Department of Corrections 
Officer Sergeant Joshua Caudell was a 
member of the department’s K–9 team 
who responded to a call to assist his 
fellow law enforcement officers with a 
disturbance call. 
During the course of searching for a 
suspect, Sergeant Caudell was shot and 
later died from his injuries. Born in 
Little Rock and raised in Redfield and 
White Hall, Sergeant Caudell was a 
White Hall High School graduate of the 
class of 2011. 
Service was something that defined 
his life. In high school, he participated 
in the school’s ROTC program. He then 
went on to serve in the Army National 
Guard and is a 10-year veteran of the 
Arkansas Department of Corrections 
with a variety of units. 
He also served his family with deep 
care and devotion. As a loving husband 
and father, Sergeant Caudell put his 
wife and children above all else. They 
shared a special bond and never left 
any doubt about how much they meant 
to each other. 
His friends describe Sergeant Caudell 
as a kind, generous person who was a 
real-life hero. He loved to fish and 
grill, cheer on his daughter’s softball 
team, ride horses with his fellow De-
partment of Corrections field officers, 
and support the Arkansas Razorbacks. 
His sacrifice in the name of pro-
tecting the community and enforcing 
the rule of law will never be forgotten. 
We are so grateful for his example 
and willingness to do the tough and 
dangerous job of ensuring public safe-
ty.

S1032 
March 8, 2022 
the last few days, West Memphis fire-
fighter Jason Lang. 
Lang was traveling to another city 
for an EMT training class when he 
stopped to provide assistance to others 
involved in a traffic accident. He was 
struck by an 18-wheeler while ren-
dering aid. 
Originally from Iowa, Jason Lang 
was an Eagle Scout and a volunteer 
firefighter who was just starting his 
adult life. We were fortunate that his 
path brought him to Arkansas, where 
he was eager to begin serving the West 
Memphis community. 
Lang was an enthusiastic and prom-
ising young man who, on day one, 
wanted to be an integral part of the 
important work that first responders 
do to help support those in need. He 
learned that example from his own 
family, with a father who served as a 
police officer for decades and a brother 
who is a volunteer firefighter. 
He may have only been with the West 
Memphis Fire Department for a few 
months, but his chief recalled viewing 
him as a future leader in the organiza-
tion from the first time that they met. 
His heroic and selfless actions will be 
admired and appreciated for years to 
come. 
Those who perform such acts do so 
without regard for their own safety, 
which is the hallmark of public service. 
So today, we remember both Sergeant 
Joshua Caudell and firefighter Jason 
Lang for what they gave to their re-
spective communities: themselves, to-
tally and unflinchingly. 
We regret that their actions were 
necessary, but we will be forever grate-
ful that these two men did not hesitate 
to put their own safety aside in the 
name of protecting and helping others. 
I join with Senator COTTON and so 
many others to share our gratitude and 
admiration for these heroes, as well as 
our sorrow that they paid the ultimate 
price in the line of duty. 
We pray for their loved ones and col-
leagues as they mourn these fallen 
guardians who served others to the 
very end. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
today, I stand with a heavy heart, 
alongside Senator BOOZMAN, to mourn 
the deaths of two great Arkansans, Ar-
kansas Department of Corrections Ser-
geant Joshua Caudell and West Mem-
phis firefighter Jason Lang. They both 
died as they lived: serving their fellow 
Arkansans. 
Like every State, Arkansas is suf-
fering terribly from the crime wave 
that has crashed across the country in 
the past 21⁄2 years. Our men and women 
in law enforcement are on the frontline 
of this crisis, fighting against the 
forces of disorder, ridding our streets of 
poisonous 
drugs, 
facing 
down 
evil 
itself. 
Sadly, too many in law enforcement 
have paid the ultimate price while pro-
tecting the innocent and fighting the 
guilty. 
HONORING SERGEANT JOSHUA CAUDELL 
Madam President, last Monday, an-
other Arkansan lost his life as an offi-
cer in the line of duty. 
The other week, Pulaski County 
Sheriff’s deputies were asked to check 
on a woman who hadn’t shown up to 
work that day. Her friends were con-
cerned about her well-being and wanted 
to make sure she was safe. When the 
deputies arrived at the woman’s house, 
an armed assailant opened fire, forcing 
them to take cover and call backup. 
The shooter managed to escape, and 
deputies then called in canine officers 
to find the would-be cop killer. 
One of the officers assigned to this 
dangerous job was Sergeant Joshua 
Caudell. Sergeant Caudell helped track 
the shooter to a trailer not far away. 
Tragically, unknown to the officers, 
the shooter was lying in wait under-
neath the trailer. He once again opened 
fire on the police, this time hitting 
Sergeant Caudell and killing him. 
Sergeant Caudell was 29 years old. He 
had a wife and three children. My pray-
ers and Senator BOOZMAN’s prayers re-
flect the prayers of all Arkansans 
going out to his family. We can only 
imagine their heartbreak and pain. 
The heinous criminal who committed 
this murder is now in custody. He will 
face justice—stern, swift, and fair. And 
he must face the sternest justice pos-
sible because an attack on a law en-
forcement officer is also an attack on 
the rule of law, on order, on civiliza-
tion itself. 
Sadly, 
the 
slaying 
of 
Sergeant 
Caudell was not the only tragedy that 
befell our State in the last 2 weeks. 
HONORING JASON LANG 
Madam President, on Saturday, Feb-
ruary 26, 20-year-old West Memphis 
firefighter Jason Lang was on his way 
to an EMT class when he saw that a 
stranger had gotten into a car acci-
dent. Exactly as you would expect from 
such a fine public servant, he pulled 
over, and he tried to help the crash vic-
tim. As he was selflessly helping the 
stranger, Jason was tragically struck 
by an 18-wheeler and killed. 
Jason’s death is a heartbreaking loss 
for our State. When Jason saw a fellow 
Arkansan in distress, he ran toward the 
danger. Every young boy and girl 
should aspire to serve their community 
with the same sense of bravery. 
Today, all of Arkansas weeps red and 
blue. My heart and Senator BOOZMAN’s 
heart goes out to all Arkansas fire-
fighters and police officers who do so 
much for our State each and every day. 
President Reagan said in his first in-
augural address that ‘‘those who say 
that we’re in a time’’ without heroes 
‘‘just don’t know where to look.’’ Jason 
Lang and Joshua Caudell were, indeed, 
heroes; and we can look to them, and 
we can honor their legacy. God bless 
them, God bless their families, and God 
bless the State of Arkansas. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 4936 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, the U.S. 
Postal Service is in dire trouble. The 
Government Accountability Office has 
listed its financial viability as high 
risk, and it has been in that status 
since 2009. 
From 2007 until 2020, the Postal Serv-
ice had losses of $86 billion and over 
$188 billion in unfunded liabilities and 
debt. From October to December of last 
year alone—just a few months—it lost 
$1.3 billion. 
I think it is a mistake to rush postal 
reform now, when Congress should in-
stead debate and consider the country’s 
response to and role in the Ukraine- 
Russia situation. We could be respond-
ing to skyrocketing energy prices. Nev-
ertheless, I do very much support deal-
ing with the post office and reforming 
the post office. We have to do this. 
Unfortunately, this bill falls far 
short in much more than just its tim-
ing. It does nearly nothing to make the 
Postal Service solvent. 
I have offered 12 amendments. Sadly, 
my efforts, along with those of my Re-
publican colleagues, have been blocked. 
But I can’t just step aside without try-
ing to make the bill better. 
Today, I would like to briefly speak 
about just 2 of the 12 amendments I 
have filed, just two of them in par-
ticular, and ask that they be called up 
and voted on. 
The first strikes a provision in the 
bill that would require the Postal Serv-
ice to ‘‘maintain an integrated net-
work for the delivery’’ of postal prod-
ucts and would require the disclosure 
of the rates that the USPS charges pri-
vate companies for the last mile deliv-
ery of packages. 
The term ‘‘integrated network’’ isn’t 
defined in the bill, and it could be eas-
ily used to bundle or combine expenses, 
which would in turn allow the USPS to 
further disguise serious costs and make 
a proper accounting of certain products 
difficult or even impossible. 
The simple idea of an ‘‘integrated de-
livery network’’ may seem benign—and 
the 
term 
itself 
sounds 
friendly 
enough—but words do matter. Words in 
context and their meaning, these are 
things that matter. 
This particular legislative text with 
no clear definition is ripe for abuse. Be-
cause the Postal Service is required to 
deliver to every American, even on un-
profitable routes, the Postal Service 
may be charging lower than market 
rates in its service contracts with pri-
vate companies. This may not only 
shortchange the Postal Service, mak-
ing further taxpayer bailouts likely, 
but it could also distort competition in 
the package delivery market. 
The American public deserves a prop-
er accounting of Postal Service rates, 
and my amendment will ensure this 
disclosure is provided in a fully trans-
parent manner. 
My second amendment prohibits the 
Postal 
Service 
from 
shipping 
any 
‘‘abortion inducing drug.’’ Chemical

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1033 
March 8, 2022 
abortions have four times the com-
plication rate of surgical abortions and 
are far more likely to send women to 
the emergency room. Unfortunately, in 
December of 2021—just a few months 
ago—the Food and Drug Administra-
tion permanently rescinded a long-
standing 
regulation 
that 
required 
healthcare professionals to dispense 
chemical abortion pills to patients in 
person, allowing them to be sent 
through the mail without even basic 
precautions to protect the life and 
health of the mother. 
Not only does this policy change 
threaten the lives and the health of 
women, but it raises the disturbing 
possibility that perpetrators of sexual 
abuse may be further enabled to hide 
their crimes from legal authorities and 
health 
professionals 
through 
mail- 
order abortion. 
Furthermore, because taxpayer dol-
lars—particularly, over the last few 
years—have funded the Postal Serv-
ice’s operations, American taxpayer re-
sources are funding abortion and put-
ting women at risk. Congress must put 
an end to this and exercise its author-
ity to ensure that the U.S. Government 
does not encourage or facilitate the use 
of these dangerous and lethal abortion 
drugs. 
I also support the efforts of my many 
colleagues. Senator SCOTT’s amend-
ment would alleviate some of the fi-
nancial burdens that this bill would 
impose on taxpayers and the Medicare 
Program by forcing the Postal Service 
to reimburse Medicare for all of the ad-
ditional costs that would be created by 
requiring future postal retirees to en-
roll in Medicare. 
Congress and the Postal Service have 
historically made bad policy and busi-
ness decisions, and now, instead of fix-
ing those or otherwise meaningfully 
addressing them, it is simply shifting 
millions of workers from coverage his-
torically provided by an independent 
Federal Agency onto taxpayers more 
broadly. 
The Postal Service and the American 
people deserve a thoughtful bill, one 
that reforms its key challenges, setting 
the Agency up for long-term success. 
But without any amendments to 
change the trajectory, this bill only 
kicks the can down the road without 
making the serious changes that are 
needed today. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent 
to 
set 
aside 
the 
pending 
amendment and call up my amendment 
No. 4936. Further, I ask that the 
amendment be reported by number, 
that there be 2 minutes of debate 
equally divided on the amendment, and 
that the Senate then vote on adoption 
of the amendment with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, the 
Postal Service Reform Act before us 
here today represents consensus on es-
sential reforms for the U.S. Postal 
Service, overdue for over a decade. 
This legislation will ensure the Post-
al Service can provide long-term, reli-
able, 6-day-a-week service across the 
country, and put it on stable financial 
footing. 
This amendment changes key service 
protections in the bill and adds new 
harmful provisions tailored to special 
interests of Postal Service competi-
tors. 
Our bill requires the Postal Service 
to maintain its current standard of de-
livery at least 6 days per week. It is ab-
solutely essential to protect 6-day de-
livery so the Postal Service can con-
tinue serving as a critical lifeline for 
countless communities that rely on the 
mail for medications, for rent pay-
ments, for critical supplies, for Social 
Security checks, and so much more. 
This amendment would change how 
the Postal Service operates today by 
altering their integrated network that 
allows mail and packages to be deliv-
ered together. This is more efficient for 
both the Postal Service and for their 
customers. 
Instead, this amendment seeks to un-
dermine the Postal Service’s ability to 
compete against private carriers that 
do not have the same requirements to 
deliver to every single community in 
the United States of America. 
The amendment would also force 
publication of contract information to 
Postal Service competitors. This would 
give away commercially sensitive in-
formation to private carriers and pro-
vide an unfair advantage, when the 
Postal Regulatory Commission already 
reviews every Postal Service contract 
to ensure both compliance as well as 
fairness. 
I 
appreciated 
Senator 
PORTMAN’s 
thoughtful comments against changing 
the key service protections in this bill. 
It is time to pass this bipartisan legis-
lation as drafted and getting it signed 
into law. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, it is un-
fortunate that we are not able to vote 
on this. It is a simple measure, and 
contrary to the characterization by my 
friend and distinguished colleague, the 
Senator from Michigan, this is a simple 
transparency measure. 
Look, the fact that there are people 
within the Postal Service reviewing 
the contracts doesn’t solve the under-
lying problem. What we want is trans-
parency. What we want to know is that 
the Postal Service isn’t setting up con-
tracts that are sweetheart deals to 
some companies, allowing them to be 
enriched on the backs of the American 
taxpayer and the consumer who uses 
the Postal Service. It is not too much 
to ask. 
So it is unfortunate that we can’t. 
All I want is a vote on that. We ought 
to be able to vote on it. It makes me 
wonder: What are they afraid of? What 
is the Postal Service so afraid of? What 
is the harm that can come from the 
American people knowing how these 
things operate? What is the harm that 
can come from striking a provision 
that is vague and ripe with opportuni-
ties for abuse—strike that and replace 
it with transparency provisions? We 
would all be better off. So that is un-
fortunate. 
I do think we ought to consider that 
and also another amendment. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 4937 
Madam President, to that end, I ask 
unanimous consent to set aside the 
pending 
amendment 
and 
call 
up 
amendment No. 4937; further, that the 
amendment be reported by number, 
that there be 2 minutes of debate 
equally divided on the amendment, and 
that the Senate then vote on adoption 
of the amendment with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, this 
bill is limited to absolutely essential, 
consensus, bipartisan reforms that are 
necessary to ensure that the Postal 
Service can survive and can continue 
delivering for the American people. 
Everything in this bill has bipartisan 
agreement. This bill passed the House 
by a vote of 342 to 92. It has broad sup-
port from the public, from the business 
community, and other stakeholders. 
In contrast, this amendment is in-
flammatory and unnecessary to the 
postal bill. It is meant to be a poison 
pill. It would add abortion-inducing 
drugs to the list of nonmailable matter 
under postal law. 
Under current law, the list of non-
mailable matter includes items rang-
ing from grenades to explosives, to con-
trolled substances and narcotics. 
However, the Postal Service is free to 
mail any FDA-approved drugs that are 
prescribed by healthcare providers and 
sent by either a pharmacy or a doctor. 
There are no other FDA-approved 
medications that are prohibited from 
being mailed to patients in need. 
This amendment is an attack on re-
productive rights that would make it 
more difficult for women and families 
to safely access critical medical care, 
and it imposes an unnecessary hardship 
on women and families who are access-
ing their care using telemedicine, espe-
cially during a pandemic. 
This amendment simply has no place 
in a bipartisan postal reform bill. 
Madam President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, here 
again is an amendment. The Senate 
has to get back to the practice of 
amending bills. I understand not every-
body is inclined to agree on it. I under-
stand the abortion issue is tough for a

lot of people. They don’t want to talk 
about it. But, look, until a few months 
ago, these weren’t available through 
the mail system anyway. They still 
shouldn’t be. I believe those who made 
that decision to allow that over the 
last few months were overlooking the 
health and safety concerns that had 
previously 
prohibited 
those 
things 
from happening. 
Regardless, it really is unfortunate 
we can’t even vote on this. I under-
stand not everybody agrees on the sub-
stance of the amendment, but what 
previously made the Senate the world’s 
greatest deliberative legislative body 
was the ability of any one Member to 
bring up an amendment and have it 
voted on. I think that is unfortunate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 4933 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, first, I want to thank my col-
league Senator LEE from Utah for his 
leadership on these issues, trying to 
make sure that the legislation we pass 
is legislation that we all have the op-
portunity to participate in. 
I have been disappointed that I am on 
the committee that deals with the 
Postal Service and we didn’t even have 
a vote on this. I didn’t have any oppor-
tunity in the committee to propose an 
amendment. It doesn’t look like I am 
going to have an opportunity here to 
have my colleagues vote on an amend-
ment, and I don’t think that is right. 
The amendment I am going to talk 
about today is cosponsored by Senators 
JOHNSON, 
GRASSLEY, 
BRAUN, 
and 
LANKFORD, and I want to thank them 
for their support. 
I absolutely support getting some-
thing done to reform the Postal Serv-
ice and ensure more accountability to 
taxpayers. Unfortunately, the bill be-
fore us doesn’t do that. 
This legislation would add at least $6 
billion in new costs to Medicare with-
out any plan to pay for it—$6 billion 
and no plan to pay for it—and at least 
$5 billion to our Federal debt, a debt 
that is already surging above $30 tril-
lion. I think we all should say that is 
unacceptable. 
This bill doesn’t reduce costs; it just 
shifts them from one unfunded govern-
ment program to another unfunded 
government program. 
Let’s remember, Medicare costs are 
already skyrocketing. Further jeopard-
izing Medicare is a disservice to the 60 
million Americans, including 4.5 mil-
lion Floridians, who rely on it. My 
amendment would fix this. It would 
just require the Postal Service to pay 
for any new costs to Medicare that this 
bill will bring. This would ensure that 
Medicare isn’t used like a piggy bank 
and that the taxpayer and future non-
postal retirees aren’t forced to bear the 
burden of this postal bailout. And the 
Postal Service should pay their fair 
share. 
I want to make this next point very 
clear. My amendment is germane. It 
deserves a simple majority vote. It de-
serves a vote. I am thankful I have the 
support of groups like 60 Plus and the 
Association of Mature American Citi-
zens that represent the interests of 
America’s seniors. 
I urge my colleagues to support this. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent 
to 
set 
aside 
the 
pending 
amendment and call up amendment No. 
4933; further, that the amendment be 
reported by number, that there be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided on 
the amendment, and that the Senate 
vote on adoption of the amendment 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I op-
pose the Scott amendment, which 
would gut the bipartisan Postal Serv-
ice Reform Act by nullifying the Medi-
care integration proposal. 
Medicare integration is an absolutely 
key part of this bipartisan bill to pro-
vide long-term financial stability for 
the Postal Service. My colleague Sen-
ator PORTMAN
spoke recently about 
why these criticisms of Medicare inte-
gration are simply unfounded. 
This bill simply provides for future 
postal retirees, who have already paid 
into Medicare throughout their entire 
careers, to enroll in Part B and Part D. 
Roughly a quarter of postal retirees do 
not enroll in Medicare even though 
they are eligible. This means the Post-
al Service is stuck paying higher pre-
miums. 
This bill simply allows the Postal 
Service to do what other businesses 
and employers already do all across our 
country by integrating these retirees 
into Medicare. This saves the Postal 
Service money and saves taxpayer 
money. This bill reduces the deficit 
over 10 years by nearly $1.5 billion. 
CBO has also made clear that the bill 
does not affect the Part A trust fund 
and will not have any effect on Medi-
care Part B or Part D premiums. 
Postal workers are already eligible 
for Part A, and the number of new 
postal workers going into Part B will 
be fewer than 40,000 individuals, and 
that compares to 62 million people cur-
rently in the program. 
The Postal Service Reform Act does 
not harm Medicare. It provides savings 
to the Postal Service and to taxpayers. 
It allows the Postal Service to survive, 
regain stable financial footing, and 
keep delivering for every single Amer-
ican. We need to stop delaying this bill. 
We need to pass the bill. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object, here 
is what I believe: We need to do every-
thing possible to protect Medicare re-
cipients and stop bankrupting our es-
sential programs. 
Senator JOHNSON has told me repeat-
edly that he has been asking for years. 
The Postal Service says they are put-
ting all this money into Medicare, and 
he has had a simple request: How much 
money is the Postal Service paying for 
Medicare, and what are the recipients 
at the Postal Service receiving in bene-
fits? No one can ever give an answer. 
I asked for a CBO score. They said 
this is going to cost at least $6 billion, 
and it is going to increase our deficit 
by at least $5 billion. 
So we have an unfunded program in 
the Postal Service, and we are going to 
move it and hurt our Medicare recipi-
ents. 
My amendment—and I was told that 
this would not cost Medicare anything, 
so my amendment is pretty simple: 
whatever the incremental costs to 
Medicare are should be paid by the 
Postal Service. I mean, it is the Postal 
Service retirees; they are the ones who 
ought to pay for it. 
So 
I 
don’t 
understand 
why 
we 
wouldn’t want to do this. I was told it 
was not going to cost anything. 
By the way, the CBO score that is out 
there already says it is going to in-
crease our deficit, and it is going to put 
our Medicare Program in worse shape. 
They can only give us numbers for the 
first 10 years. After 10 years, the num-
bers are going to be worse than the 
numbers I told you about. 
So what I don’t get is, one, why 
didn’t we vote on this in the com-
mittee? Why didn’t we have an oppor-
tunity to do an amendment there? Why 
don’t we have an amendment vote on 
this on the floor? It is common sense. 
I would think all of us would want to 
make sure we are not going to bank-
rupt Medicare, and all of us want to 
make sure that if it is going to cost 
Medicare anything, the Postal Service 
should pay for it. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, late 
last month, President Biden announced 
the 
nomination 
of 
Judge 
Ketanji 
Brown Jackson, the next Associate 
Justice of the Supreme Court. 
As I said the day her nomination was 
announced, it is hard to think of a bet-
ter jurist to replace highly regarded 
Justice Stephen Breyer. Over the past 
10 days, we have all had a chance to 
learn about her record, and last week I 
met with her in my office. I would like 
to share what impressed me the most 
about her. 
First is her breadth of experience. A 
graduate of Harvard Law School, she 
has worked in private legal practice. 
She served as a Federal public defender 
and served on the U.S. Sentencing 
Commission. She has clerked at every 
level of the Federal judiciary: for 
Judge Patti Saris on the District of 
Massachusetts, Judge Bruce Selya on 
the First Circuit, and Justice Breyer 
on the Supreme Court. That is an 
amazing resume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1035 
March 8, 2022 
She went on to serve as a Federal dis-
trict court judge. Currently, she sits on 
the DC Circuit, often regarded as the 
second highest court in the land. And 
once confirmed, she will be only the 
second current Supreme Court Justice 
with experience as a trial court judge. 
That means Judge Jackson will bring 
to the Court insights into the issues 
confronting 
Federal 
district 
courts 
every single day. And these same ques-
tions often make it to the Supreme 
Court for final review. 
Second, I was impressed with her 
character and temperament. They are 
unimpeachable. During our conversa-
tion last week, we spoke about her 
family, her daughters, her upbringing, 
and the highlights of her career. I par-
ticularly enjoyed one story, which she 
has told before, about a letter that her 
daughter wrote to President Obama a 
few years ago. In it, she asked the 
President to appoint her mother to the 
Supreme Court. Well, it may have 
taken a bit longer than Judge Jack-
son’s daughter anticipated, I can only 
imagine how proud she is today. 
My conversation with Judge Jackson 
also made clear that she has the exact 
temperament we need on the Court. 
She is personable, humble, approach-
able. That last attribute is particularly 
important for a Supreme Court Jus-
tice. 
The Supreme Court should not be 
shrouded in secrecy and mystery. Its 
process and its decisions should be 
clear and easily understood for the peo-
ple in the Court as well as for the 
American public. With Judge Jackson 
on the Court, we can trust that will be 
true. 
Third, Judge Jackson is clearly— 
clearly—within 
the 
judicial 
main-
stream. 
She 
has 
a 
record 
of 
evenhandedness and impartiality, guid-
ed by the Constitution, the law, and 
the facts of the case. She is not a par-
tisan or an ideologue. She is inde-
pendent in her thinking, and she will 
maintain the Court’s proper role. 
Don’t take my word for it. Judges 
and lawyers from across the political 
spectrum have said the same thing. 
Consider the support Judge Jackson 
enjoys from David Levi, who was ap-
pointed by President George H. W. 
Bush to serve on the Eastern District 
of California. 
He wrote to the committee, and he 
said a Supreme Court nominee ‘‘must 
be neutral, nonpartisan, exercise self- 
restraint, model civility, and approach 
each case with an open mind and with 
a determination to reach as just, wise, 
and correct a result as possible.’’ 
And he concluded that ‘‘[b]ased on 
what I know of Judge Jackson . . . I 
believe she has been that kind of a 
judge and will be that kind of a Jus-
tice.’’ 
I could not agree more. Often, I have 
seen my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle in their initial reaction to the 
judge—Judge Jackson—have said, well, 
I want to know more about her judicial 
philosophy. Certainly, they can draw 
their own conclusions, but I hope that 
they will read what David Levi had to 
say as well as other conservative ju-
rists. 
Sadly, Judge Jackson has already 
been subject to a number of baseless 
attacks so let’s set the record straight. 
First, she has drawn criticism for re-
fusing to comment when asked whether 
the Supreme Court should remain at 
its current size. Well, Judge Jackson’s 
exactly right not to offer an opinion. 
As a nominee to the Supreme Court 
and a sitting judge on the DC Circuit, 
it would be totally inappropriate for 
her to opine on a public policy decision 
that only we can make in Congress. 
Indeed, Judge Jackson’s handling of 
this question mirrors the approach 
taken by Justice Amy Coney Barrett 
just a few months back when she was 
nominated to the Court. 
At her hearing, when then-Judge 
Barrett was asked about the size of the 
Court, she then responded, it is ‘‘a 
question left open to Congress’’ and 
that if there were a ‘‘specific constitu-
tional question’’ about the Court’s size, 
she ‘‘could not opine on it.’’ 
Judge Jackson also has faced offen-
sive questions from figures on the far 
right about her qualifications. This 
past Wednesday, FOX News talking 
head Tucker Carlson demanded that 
President Biden produce Judge Jack-
son’s score on the LSAT exam. 
Mr. Carlson said he wanted to see 
Judge Jackson’s LSAT score to gauge 
if she was, in fact, ‘‘a once in a genera-
tion legal mind.’’ 
Isn’t it interesting that Mr. Tucker 
Carlson never once asked for LSAT 
scores of President Trump’s nominees 
to the Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett 
Kavanaugh, or Amy Coney Barrett. He 
never once questioned their qualifica-
tions to sit on the Court or their aca-
demic credentials. 
Let’s be clear: Judge Jackson grad-
uated magna cum laude from Harvard 
University and cum laude from Har-
vard Law School. Not bad. As an 
undergrad, she received the Harvard 
College 
Scholarship 
for 
Academic 
Achievement. Let me repeat that—aca-
demic achievement. And she served as 
supervising editor on the Harvard Law 
Review. 
Mr. Carlson, of course, is notorious 
for his outrageous comments. I don’t 
expect he is going to offer any apology 
to Judge Jackson, but I would urge all 
my Republican colleagues to disavow 
his remarks and disassociate them-
selves from the innuendo. 
We also continue to hear false allega-
tions that Judge Jackson was hand-
picked by so-called liberal dark money 
groups. Once again, that claim is com-
pletely divorced from reality. The 
truth is this: President Biden under-
took a rigorous process to select Jus-
tice Breyer’s successor, seeking the ad-
vice of a bipartisan group of Senators. 
And after weeks of consideration, he, 
and he alone, chose Judge Jackson. 
President Biden’s selection process 
was deliberative, collaborative, and it 
took seriously the Senate’s advice and 
consent role. It did not involve dark 
money groups. I can’t help but note the 
irony of this line of attack coming 
from the other side of the aisle. 
After all, it was President Donald 
Trump 
who 
bragged—bragged—that 
groups like the Federalist Society and 
Heritage Foundation actually drove his 
selection process for the Supreme 
Court. 
As a candidate, Trump said: 
We’re going to have great judges, conserv-
ative, all picked by the Federalist Society. 
Trump, never at a loss for words, 
made it very clear where he went to 
find his nominee. 
And Don McGahn, the Trump admin-
istration’s first White House Counsel, 
said about the Federalist Society in ju-
dicial selection: 
I’ve been a member of the Federalist Soci-
ety since law school. Still am. So, frankly, it 
seems like it has been insourced. 
‘‘Insourced’’ was his word. 
And it is worth adding that Repub-
licans, including Senator MCCONNELL, 
have blocked every single effort to ad-
dress the presence of hard money—dark 
money in our political system. We 
should have full disclosure. I support 
that. We are ready to vote on the floor. 
The leader on the Republican side re-
sists. 
Judge Jackson also has faced base-
less claims that she is a partisan Dem-
ocrat just nominated to rubberstamp 
the Biden agenda. These claims have 
no basis in fact. She is evenhanded and 
impartial, confirmed by the Senate on 
a bipartisan basis three different times, 
including last year. 
If Judge Jackson were such a par-
tisan, why would so many prominent 
conservatives be supporting her? The 
short answer is they wouldn’t. 
But she has that support and plenty 
of it, including from former Republican 
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan; re-
tired DC Circuit Judge Thomas Grif-
fith, a George W. Bush retiree; retired 
Fourth Circuit Judge Michael Luttig, a 
George H. W. Bush appointee; Bill 
Burck, a prominent Republican attor-
ney who worked in the George W. Bush 
administration; Charles Fried, 
who 
served as Solicitor General during the 
Reagan 
administration, 
and 
many 
more. 
These conservative jurists and attor-
neys have endorsed her precisely be-
cause she is independent and fair-
minded. She will not rubberstamp any 
President’s agenda. These conservative 
leaders know that on the Court, Judge 
Jackson will be faithful to the Con-
stitution and the rule of law. 
Finally, we hear the false allegation 
that Judge Jackson will be ‘‘soft on 
crime.’’ Look at her life, look at her 
record and at the support she now has 
from the law enforcement community. 
As Judge Jackson noted in accepting 
the President’s nomination, she has 
two uncles and a brother who serve as 
police officers. One of her uncles was 
chief of police in Miami. 
On the bench, she has approached 
each criminal case in a manner that we

would ask of every judge. Look at the 
law; look at the facts. 
It is not surprising that she has gar-
nered the support of multiple law en-
forcement groups. This nominee, who 
is attributed as being soft on crime, 
has the endorsement of the Fraternal 
Order of Police. They wrote the fol-
lowing about her: 
We are reassured that, should she be con-
firmed, she would approach her future cases 
with an open mind and treat issues related 
to law enforcement fairly and justly. 
Wouldn’t we all be proud to have that 
endorsement for our pursuits? 
Superintendent David Brown of the 
Chicago Police Department wrote: 
I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson’s appointment will 
make history by adding a powerful, mod-
erate, and informed voice to the highest 
court in the land. 
As Senators and the American people 
continue to learn more about Judge 
Jackson and her amazing record, I hope 
and expect they will reach the same 
conclusion that leaders have reached 
all across America’s political spec-
trum. Judge Jackson will be a strong, 
fair, principled, evenhanded, and im-
partial Supreme Court Justice. 
In closing, let me say that we have 
scheduled the hearings of the Judiciary 
Committee to begin on March 21. That 
is 24 days after President Biden an-
nounced his nominee. 
The previous Justice nominated for 
the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Bar-
rett, 
under 
President 
Trump, 
was 
brought to the committee for a hearing 
in 16 days. So we are certainly within 
the window and beyond it in producing 
Judge Jackson on the 24th day. 
We are also providing materials that 
have been requested, including docu-
ments from the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission, of which Judge Jackson was a 
member. 
She will produce 12,000 pages of docu-
ments that are going to chronicle what 
happened in the Commission while she 
was serving. They include minutes and 
the Board’s discussions of the impor-
tant issues that are before us. 
Lucky for all of us, it is a very trans-
parent Agency, and they have lived up 
to that transparency with this disclo-
sure. 
In the meantime, the judge is going 
to do her best to meet with as many 
Senators 
as 
possible. 
She 
has 
prioritized those members of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee on the right 
and on the left, Democrats and Repub-
licans, as well as other leaders in the 
U.S. Senate. 
She is available, and I am certain 
that if my colleagues are fair in their 
appraisal, they will come to the same 
conclusion that I have come to. She is 
an excellent choice to be Justice 
Breyer’s successor on the Supreme 
Court. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
ENERGY 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over 
the last few decades, globalization has 
completely reshaped the international 
economic order. Economies around the 
world have become interconnected, re-
lying on one another from agricultural 
products to energy, to manufacturing 
capabilities. 
It seemed to be the rule of thumb 
that whoever could produce a product 
at the lowest price got the business and 
the jobs that went along with it. 
But we are increasingly seeing vul-
nerabilities that this interdependence 
creates with some of the clearest ex-
amples surfacing during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
The United States, for example, leans 
heavily on China for masks, gloves, and 
gowns, personal protective equipment, 
and for ventilators—all of which were 
absolutely necessary during the begin-
ning of the pandemic and continuing 
on until today. But for a long time, 
that wasn’t a problem, until COVID–19 
showed up. 
I still remember the phone call I had 
with the Governor of Texas, my friend 
Greg Abbott. At the beginning of the 
pandemic, I said, ‘‘Governor, what do 
you need?’’ He said, ‘‘We need testing 
and we need PPE,’’ personal protective 
equipment, almost all of which is made 
overseas in China. 
China, as it turns out, held on to 
most of the supply for its own hospitals 
and healthcare workers, leaving the 
rest of the world to compete for the 
limited supply that remained. 
Suddenly, we were unable to provide 
our healthcare providers with the per-
sonal protective equipment they need-
ed to protect themselves while they 
served others—namely, the rest of us, 
their patients. 
As supply chain struggles grew and 
expanded, it wasn’t just medical equip-
ment that proved to be a problem. Ev-
erything from cleaning products to 
automobiles were impacted. 
We began to realize that one of the 
biggest vulnerabilities is semiconduc-
tors, which are critical components for 
our most used products: things like 
smart phones, computers, televisions, 
cars, airplanes, cell towers, and just 
about everything else with an off-and- 
on switch. 
Again, the source of our chip supply 
didn’t used to be a problem. About 
three decades ago, the United States 
manufactured 37 percent of the world’s 
semiconductors. But as our reliance on 
these chips has gone up, our production 
has gone down; and today, instead of 37 
percent of the world’s semiconductors, 
the United States produces only 12 per-
cent of the global share. 
Again, these microcircuits have be-
come invaluable in this technological 
age because, literally, everything with 
an off-and-on switch requires semi-
conductors—and I mean everything. 
The lion’s share of semiconductor 
manufacturing—more than 60 percent 
of the world’s supply—is in Taiwan, 
which, as we know, is being threatened 
with invasion by the People’s Republic 
of China. But it is not just the threat 
of armed invasion that risks that sup-
ply chain; it is also the possibility of 
another pandemic or a natural dis-
aster. 
This flashing red light has prompted 
the Senate to take action by passing 
the CHIPS for America Act, which I in-
troduced along with the senior Senator 
from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, which was 
designed to incentivize U.S. semicon-
ductor manufacturing. 
And in the coming weeks, I hope we 
can finally get a bill to the President’s 
desk that funds these critical programs 
and puts us on a path to more domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing because 
of those risks to the supply chain. 
In short, a crisis hit, it exposed our 
vulnerabilities, and we acted. 
That is exactly what we need to do 
now regarding energy security. Let me 
explain. 
In many ways, the risks we are see-
ing with the global energy supply 
today are similar to those risks we ex-
perienced with critical components 
like semiconductors. Much of the world 
relies on a single country for a critical 
product, and decisions made by a dic-
tator could lead to that supply being 
cut off at a moment’s notice. 
When our allies are looking to adver-
saries for our most basic needs like 
heating, electricity, fuel, it creates 
huge 
vulnerabilities 
and 
sky-high 
prices at the same time. 
This was underscored in January of 
2009, when Russia effectively turned 
the gas off to Ukraine for almost 3 
weeks. This affected at least 10 coun-
tries in Europe whose natural gas trav-
eled through Ukraine. Russia is still 
the dominant gas supplier for Europe, 
including Ukraine. Last year, Russia 
supplied 40 percent of Europe’s natural 
gas. 
In 2020, Russia was the third largest 
producer of petroleum and other liquid 
fuels and the second largest producer of 
natural gas. This gives Vladimir Putin 
a tremendous amount of not only 
power but ready cash. And as we are 
seeing on our TV screens, that money 
is being used for the most nefarious of 
purposes: to kill innocent Ukrainian ci-
vilians. 
After coming under intense pressure 
by both Democrats and Republicans, I 
am glad that the administration has fi-
nally announced a ban on Russian oil 
imports into the United States. 
We know exactly where the money 
they get from selling this commodity 
is going, and we cannot continue to 
supply Putin with blood money. 
I am disappointed it did take a while 
for the President to see the merits of 
this action and only after it was clear 
that Congress, on a bipartisan basis, 
was prepared to act. 
Our colleagues in both Chambers 
have produced numerous proposals to 
ban Russian imports, while pushing the 
administration to take action. 
Over the weekend, Democrats on the 
House Ways and Means Committee an-
nounced a bipartisan bill to do just 
that, but the press release, once posted 
on the website, was quickly taken

down, strangely enough. Reporting in-
dicates that the White House inter-
vened to get that press release taken 
down off the House Ways and Means 
website because it didn’t want to look 
like it was being boxed into taking ac-
tion on Russian oil imports. 
But to his credit, once the President 
saw the writing on the wall, he decided 
to take action, but he made it seem 
like it was his idea, even though we all 
know his hand was forced by bipartisan 
support in the Congress. 
There has never been a more critical 
moment to reevaluate our reliance on 
rogue regimes for our energy supply. If 
we want to protect ourselves and our 
allies from the whims of a power-hun-
gry dictator, we need to get serious 
about energy security. 
In recent years, conversations about 
energy policy have been consumed by 
debates about the environmental im-
pact of fossil fuels, which are impor-
tant, but often, they are not well in-
formed. 
Some of our colleagues have proposed 
everything from fracking bans in the 
Green New Deal to net-zero carbon 
deadlines. 
Well, those efforts may bring down 
America’s share of global emissions, 
but it would come at a grave cost to 
global energy security. And the truth 
is, whether it is the Russians or the 
Chinese or India, developing nations 
with growing economies, they may pay 
lip service to some of the goals of a 
carbon-free future; but this is at the 
same time that China is building more 
coal-fired powerplants than any other 
nation on Earth. 
So they really say one thing and do 
another, for fairly obvious reasons. 
They 
understand 
that 
constraining 
your own energy supply will have a 
negative impact on their economy and 
job growth and stability in each of 
those countries. 
But I want to be clear: I support ef-
forts to diversify our energy sources 
and reduce emissions. That is why in 
Texas we embraced what is called ‘‘all 
of the above’’ as an energy strategy 
that includes oil and gas, nuclear, 
wind, solar, you name it. We embrace 
all of it. 
But we have learned a long time ago 
that solar and wind energy are depend-
ent on the weather, for example, or the 
time of day, because the Sun doesn’t 
always shine and the wind doesn’t al-
ways blow. That is why you need a reli-
able base load of electricity and en-
ergy, primarily fuel from natural gas, 
some from nuclear and the like. 
On top of that diversification of your 
energy supply which has proven to be 
so important and so successful in re-
ducing emissions yet maintaining en-
ergy security, Texas companies are 
also making serious strides in energy 
innovation. We are finding new ways to 
sequester carbon emissions, for exam-
ple, and other ways to make our most 
available and affordable energy sources 
cleaner. 
I believe we need to do more to en-
courage innovation and diversification 
of our energy sources, but those efforts 
must not come at the cost of security. 
Our top priority must be to ensure 
that the United States and our allies 
have reliable access to energy needed 
to keep the lights on and their econ-
omy running. And we need to stop 
Putin and other dictators from getting 
rich off of our dependence and holding 
democracies like Ukraine hostage. 
Suffice it to say that the Biden ad-
ministration has not addressed a plan 
to do that. From day one, the adminis-
tration has taken actions that under-
mine America’s energy security and 
send even more business to Russia and 
Saudi Arabia. 
Only hours after being sworn in, 
President Biden cancelled the permit 
to the Keystone XL Pipeline and halted 
all new energy leasing and permitting 
on public lands and waters. 
His administration has effectively 
discouraged investments in new pro-
duction here at home, and the U.S. is 
producing significantly less oil. It is 
now down by 1.2 million barrels per day 
from pre-Biden administration days. 
Without question, the most logical 
response to the current global energy 
crisis is to boost production of U.S. en-
ergy sources. We can reap the economic 
benefits of strong production here at 
home and supply our friends and allies 
with reliable energy around the world 
and, in the process, enhancing their en-
ergy security, making them less de-
pendent on people like Vladimir Putin. 
But producers aren’t able to turn on 
a dime. They are not able to increase 
their capacity overnight; but it is im-
portant for us to begin to take the 
steps now to strengthen our domestic 
energy production in light of the devel-
opments in Ukraine and in Europe. 
The sooner the Biden administration 
views oil and gas producers as nec-
essary rather than expendable, the bet-
ter off we will all be. 
That is not what the White House has 
suggested, by the way. In fact, they 
seem to be suggesting a completely dif-
ferent route. 
The Biden administration doesn’t 
want to supply Europe with more 
American energy; he wants to help 
them shift their reliance from one oil- 
rich dictator to another. Good-bye, 
Russia; hello, Iran; hello, Venezuela. 
The administration is looking to other 
rogue regimes to supply the energy 
that should be produced here in Amer-
ica. 
The White House is trying to revive 
the ill-considered Iran nuclear deal, 
and the White House press secretary 
acknowledged that a new deal would 
mean more oil from Iran for global 
markets. 
It is reportedly considering a trip to 
Saudi Arabia to ask the Kingdom to 
pump more oil—not here in America, 
but go to Saudi Arabia, hat in hand, 
and say: Will you please produce more 
oil to help us bring down the price of 
gasoline? 
We even hear that the Biden adminis-
tration is trying to ease sanctions on 
Venezuela and funnel Putin’s profits to 
Maduro. 
The fact the Biden administration is 
beating down the doors of the Aya-
tollah, the Crown Prince, and Maduro 
rather than easing burdens on Amer-
ican producers is a bad joke. It is ab-
surd. It makes no sense whatsoever. 
Now, ideologues may oppose Amer-
ican fossil fuels, but the administra-
tion’s reflexive opposition to U.S. pro-
ducers is creating serious risks for our 
security, not to mention the high 
prices that consumers pay at the pump. 
We are blessed to live in a resource- 
rich country, and there is no reason to 
put the energy security of the United 
States and our allies at risk because 
President Biden worries about angering 
the progressive radical left of his own 
political party. 
If the Biden administration con-
tinues to wage war on American fossil 
fuels, it will create huge vulnerabili-
ties for the United States and our al-
lies. 
Now, I am not suggesting we revive 
the 1970s oil export ban and implement 
isolationist energy policies, but we do 
need to take decisive action to reduce 
the world’s reliance on authoritarian 
regimes. 
Just as the pandemic led us to re-
evaluate vulnerable supply chains, this 
war in Ukraine has opened our eyes 
and, hopefully, given us the oppor-
tunity to reevaluate global energy se-
curity. 
I hope this crisis will serve as a reset 
button for those energy security ef-
forts, and I hope we can find some com-
mon ground between Democrats and 
Republicans to reconsider the ideolog-
ical and reflexive opposition to Amer-
ican fossil fuels because the con-
sequences in terms of world peace and 
energy security are too serious not to 
revisit those preconceived notions be-
fore the Ukrainian invasion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor first to associate my-
self with the remarks of the distin-
guished senior Senator from Texas, and 
I agree completely with his comments 
regarding what is happening right now 
in Ukraine on the ground and what is 
happening with energy in America and 
our need to become energy independent 
again. To go from this current position 
of what had previously been energy 
dominance to now energy dependence— 
we need to return to the days of energy 
dominance for the United States be-
cause it is not just about our national 
security, it is about security for our 
friends and allies around the world so 
they don’t have to be dependent on the 
likes of the killer and the thug Vladi-
mir Putin. 
So I come to the floor today to talk 
about what is going on in Ukraine and 
the war in Ukraine and the global im-
plications thereof. 
Right now, the world is watching in 
horror as Vladimir Putin continues

March 8, 2022 
with his onslaught. Russia has now 
shelled two nuclear facilities. Russia 
continues to attack civilian targets. 
Russia 
has 
allegedly 
used 
cluster 
bombs near schools and hospitals. We 
know that dozens of children have been 
killed. Russian troops have even at-
tacked an orphanage and a kinder-
garten. It is heartbreaking, and it is 
also barbarism straight out of Hell. 
The world is right to be outraged by 
these vicious attacks, and we know 
how these attacks have been paid for. 
We know how Vladimir Putin has fund-
ed his aggression. These atrocities were 
all paid for through Russian energy. 
Energy is the reason that Vladimir 
Putin can afford to invade Ukraine. It 
is the cash cow that drives his mili-
tary—oil and gas from Russia. Half of 
Russia’s economy is based on energy, 
and nearly half of Europe’s imports of 
energy come from Russia. So, as I said, 
energy is the cash cow that has funded 
the war. 
Russia is the No. 2 producer of crude 
oil in the world, and Putin is the No. 1 
rival to the United States in terms of 
energy production. Well, under Joe 
Biden as President, there has been a lot 
less competition for Vladimir Putin. It 
is not for lack of American energy re-
sources, and it certainly is not for lack 
of American energy workers. No, it is 
because of the reckless policies of 
President Joe Biden and this adminis-
tration. 
On Friday last week, I was in Chey-
enne, WY, at the State capital, where I 
spent 5 years as a State senator prior 
to coming to the U.S. Senate. Every 
member of the Wyoming Legislature, 
Republican and Democrat alike, under-
stands fully that the resources we need 
to power our country are here in the 
United States. We have the energy in 
the ground. Yet this administration is 
not allowing us to use it. We have the 
workers ready to go, plenty in Wyo-
ming and around the country. The 
Biden 
administration 
continues 
to 
block us from producing more Amer-
ican energy. 
Those legislators I talked to on Fri-
day—they know. Every one of them 
knows that on Joe Biden’s first day in 
office, he killed the Keystone XL Pipe-
line. They know because they follow 
the news, and they know because Joe 
Biden bragged about it. He said: Look 
at me, I am going to kill the Keystone 
XL Pipeline. And he did with an Execu-
tive order on day No. 1. 
Since then, he has blocked oil and 
gas leases on public land. Quarter after 
quarter after quarter—we are now in 
the fifth quarter in a row where he has 
blocked all oil and gas leases on public 
land. No auctions for those leases have 
been held. 
He also stopped exploration in the 
Arctic. The Russians are exploring for 
energy in the Arctic, but, no, not Joe 
Biden. Nope. After you, Mr. Putin. You 
go get it and sell it. And we know how 
he is using the money. So Joe Biden de-
cides he wants to handcuff America 
from doing the same thing—exploring 
for energy in the Arctic. 
At the same time, it has become 
nearly impossible to build a natural 
gas pipeline in the United States. You 
say: No, it can’t be possible. Well, the 
President’s lackeys—lackeys—on the 
Federal Regulatory Commission re-
cently decided to change their approval 
process for natural gas pipelines. As 
Putin’s army surrounded Ukraine, Joe 
Biden’s lackeys on the FERC changed 
the way they approved pipelines. They 
did it as inflation hit record-high num-
bers, with war looming in Europe. It is 
astonishing. JOE MANCHIN called them, 
as did I, as the chairman and ranking 
member of the Senate Energy Com-
mittee—called them in front of the 
committee last week, a hearing last 
Thursday—and asked them to explain 
themselves, why this attack on Amer-
ican energy. 
You know, our country produced lots 
of oil before COVID. We are producing 
some now, but we are still a million 
barrels a day below where we were dur-
ing the peak prior to COVID. So when 
supply and production at home is 
down, prices go up. 
Earlier today, gasoline prices hit the 
highest price ever—ever—but prices 
were way up even before Russia in-
vaded Ukraine. The day Joe Biden took 
office, gas prices were $2.38 per gallon 
nationwide. Today, the average is $4.17. 
It cost more than $5 a gallon in left-
wing California. They may be happy to 
pay the price. People in Wyoming are 
not, where they drive lots of miles to 
and from work. In Wyoming, the num-
ber of miles driven is the highest per 
capita anywhere in the country. 
We know what happens to families 
when gas prices go up and they have to 
put more money in the tank that could 
have otherwise been used for food, for 
clothing, for school supplies for the 
kids. 
I understand that a gallon of gas in 
Los Angeles now is at $7. 
Last year, a typical working family 
paid about $1,000 more to fill their tank 
over the course of the year than they 
did the year before Joe Biden became 
President. It is a direct result of the 
policies of this administration. And 
this year, it is likely to be a lot higher 
because this administration’s policies, 
environmental-extremist 
driven, 
are 
making energy at home much more ex-
pensive. 
So today, after 2 weeks into the war, 
Joe Biden has announced a ban on Rus-
sian oil. It is about time. 
On Saturday, a number of us were in 
a Zoom call with President Zelenskyy, 
the brave, heroic, courageous President 
of Ukraine. He said: 
If [we] had started sanctions months ago, 
there would not have been a war. 
Now the question is, What is going to 
replace the Russian oil? Because up 
until today, Joe Biden was eager to 
buy Russian oil—eager. So the question 
is, What is going to replace the Russian 
oil? Well, it darn well ought to be 
American oil. Democrats have basi-
cally floated a couple of proposals. Buy 
it from Iran, they say; buy it from Ven-
ezuela, they say; or don’t buy any at 
all. 
On Thursday, the Secretary of Trans-
portation said a possibility was ‘‘work-
ing out something with Iran.’’ Remem-
ber those people? They are the ones 
who every Friday have a demonstra-
tion where they chant ‘‘death to Amer-
ica’’ and burn the American flag. He 
wants to work something out with 
them. 
Let me remind the people who are 
watching that Iran is the No. 1 state 
sponsor of global terrorism. Iran is on 
the verge of a nuclear weapon. Now 
Democrats want to give Iran a windfall 
of American dollars. 
The last time Democrats bribed Iran, 
the Secretary of State was John Kerry. 
He admitted right out that some of the 
money would go to terrorists, and we 
know that some of it did. Democrats 
signed the check anyway. Pallets of 
cash were delivered to Tehran. Now 
Democrats are talking about doing it 
all over again. 
Oh, and think about John Kerry. 
What did he say in an interview with 
the BBC just a week and a half ago, as 
Russian troops were on the border sur-
rounding Ukraine? He said he hoped 
that what was happening there ‘‘did 
not 
distract’’—‘‘did 
not 
distract’’— 
from the climate agenda. Oh yeah, we 
wouldn’t want the death of all those 
people to distract from your agenda, 
Mr. 
Kerry, 
former 
Senator 
Kerry, 
former Secretary of State. But he is 
not just the former, he is the current 
climate spokesman for this administra-
tion. He is the voice of climate in this 
administration. So that must mean 
that Joe Biden doesn’t want it to dis-
tract from his climate agenda either. 
It is time to wake up. 
Over the weekend, the Biden admin-
istration officials went to Venezuela. 
According to media reports, they dis-
cussed easing sanctions on Venezuelan 
oil. 
Nicolas Maduro is one of the world’s 
biggest cheerleaders for you know who? 
Vladimir Putin. He supports Russia’s 
war in Ukraine. He apparently called 
the Kremlin to say that just this past 
week. 
This means that the Biden adminis-
tration is actually actively considering 
and pursuing, as they were on Satur-
day, replacing oil from Russia with oil 
from a Russian client state in our own 
hemisphere. It is bad energy policy. It 
is bad foreign policy. It almost seems 
to be something out of ‘‘Alice in Won-
derland.’’ Yet, it still makes more 
sense than the third idea that Demo-
crats are floating: Let’s just let energy 
prices go higher and higher. 
The White House Press Secretary 
said that we should just stop using oil 
altogether. She says the solution to 
high gas prices and war in Europe is 
just stop using gas. This is delusional. 
The idea that we can immediately 
transition away from oil and gas is a 
fairy tale. It is a dangerous fairy tale 
at that. 
None of these three solutions pro-
posed by the Democrats is in the best

interest of our Nation, our Nation’s en-
ergy security, or our Nation’s national 
security. Oil from Iran and oil from 
Venezuela is just as dangerous as oil 
from Russia. Changing our entire econ-
omy overnight is not an option in the 
real world. 
There is only one answer that works, 
and that is the answer that the Amer-
ican people are pleading for. The solu-
tion to Russian oil is more American 
oil. We must replace Russian oil with 
American energy. To do that, we need 
to produce more. We have the re-
sources. We have the workers. We have 
the expertise. What we need is the lead-
ership out of the White House in Wash-
ington, DC, and we are not getting it. 
We ought to produce enough Amer-
ican energy to supply our allies and, 
above all, to bring down prices for peo-
ple here at home. That is why I have 
introduced legislation called the ES-
CAPE Act, to escape what is happening 
with this control of our energy and the 
increase in prices. It stands for Energy 
Security Cooperation With Allied Part-
ners in Europe. This bill expedites the 
sale of American natural gas to our 
NATO allies. 
I also led a letter with every Repub-
lican on the Energy Committee and 
sent it to President Biden the morning 
after his State of the Union Address. 
Our letter details 10 specific plans, 10 
specific actions the President can take 
today to produce more American en-
ergy. 
We are much better off producing and 
selling energy to our friends than being 
forced to buy it from our enemies. 
What President Biden and the Demo-
crats don’t seem to believe is the unde-
niable truth that energy security is na-
tional security. For ourselves and for 
our allies, we need more American en-
ergy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that, at 4:50 
p.m. today, all postcloture time be con-
sidered expired on H.R. 3076; that 
amendment No. 4955 be withdrawn; 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time; that if a budget point of order is 
raised and a motion to waive made, the 
Senate vote on the motion to waive; 
that if waived, the Senate vote on the 
passage of the bill; further, that upon 
disposition of H.R. 3076 that, notwith-
standing rule XXII, the Senate proceed 
to executive session and vote on the 
motions to invoke cloture on Calendar 
Nos. 547 and 719; that if cloture is in-
voked on any of these nominations, the 
Senate vote on confirmation of the 
nominations at a time to be deter-
mined by the majority leader or his 
designee following consultation with 
the Republican leader; finally, that 
there be 2 minutes for debate, equally 
divided in the usual form, prior to each 
vote, all without further intervening 
action or debate. 
Also, in an effort to speed up the 
votes, I ask unanimous consent that all 
votes after the first vote be 10-minute 
votes. Members should be notified to 
get here and to stay around so we can 
get this done. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor to 
the Senator from Iowa. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
many Iowans rely on pharmacists who 
operate independently or as part of a 
small 
community 
pharmacy 
chain. 
This is especially true in rural Iowa, 
but I will bet it is true in a lot of other 
rural States as well. In Iowa, we have 
over 300 independent pharmacists, and 
many work in multiple rural commu-
nities. These pharmacies are small 
businesses serving Iowa communities 
like Muscatine and Sioux City. 
These pharmacies want a level play-
ing field to compete with anyone 
whether that is a big chain or whether 
it is another independent pharmacy. 
Yet the pharmacists I hear from are 
being hurt by retroactive direct and in-
direct remunerations. I am going to 
refer to them as ‘‘DIR’’ fees. They have 
to work with pharmaceutical benefit 
managers in regard to those fees, and 
there are conflicts between them that I 
hear about all the time. This all deals 
with Part D Medicare plans. What I am 
talking about with regard to direct and 
indirect remunerations and these nego-
tiated fees with PBMs are what are 
sometimes known as clawbacks. 
Every day, seniors go to the drug 
store, and they probably always pay a 
copay. These seniors then rightfully 
believe that they are paying the lowest 
amount possible, but that is not always 
the case. After the patient pays and 
leaves the pharmacy, the Part D Medi-
care plan or a PBM, a pharmacy ben-
efit manager, contacts the local phar-
macist to claw back a certain amount 
paid. That is where this DIR fee comes 
in. This action actually lowers the cost 
of the drug, but the patient doesn’t 
know it. Because of these DIR fees, 
seniors pay a lot more than they need 
to for the pills they get at the phar-
macy. 
One Iowa rural pharmacist told me 
that DIR fees, clawbacks, are not only 
costing the patient more in the form of 
a higher copay, they are also costing 
that local pharmacy. From 2010 to 2020, 
Part D Medicare plans and the PBMs 
increased the DIR fees by over—can 
you believe this?—104,000 percent. DIR 
fees now total over $9 billion a year. 
Pharmacists, especially those oper-
ating independently in rural areas but 
particularly in rural Iowa, whom I hear 
about, have told me, if DIR fee 
clawbacks do not get under control, 
pharmacists 
will 
not 
survive. 
Of 
course, we hear—maybe not every day, 
but we hear quite often—about those 
small pharmacists going out of busi-
ness, and these DIR fees are often cited 
to us as one of the reasons. This will 
then leave Iowans without access to 
the local pharmacy for medication 
therapy management and for other 
care. 
I have a bipartisan solution to solve 
this 
problem 
that 
ends 
DIR 
fee 
clawbacks. 
In 2019, the senior Senator from Or-
egon and I negotiated and introduced a 
bill that we entitled the ‘‘Prescription 
Drug Pricing Reduction Act,’’ also 
known as Grassley-Wyden. I don’t even 
care if it is known as Wyden-Grassley. 
The Grassley-Wyden ends DIR fee 
clawbacks. This will reduce out-of- 
pocket expenses and provide phar-
macies with financial predictability. 
This move may even keep rural phar-
macies viable. 
On top of my legislative efforts in 
Grassley-Wyden, I commend the Cen-
ters for Medicare and Medicaid Serv-
ices for issuing a proposed rule to end 
DIR fee clawbacks. I am not sure that 
that proposed rule exactly does what 
the Grassley-Wyden bill does, but it is 
still a step in the right direction, and I 
welcome that. In welcoming it, I have 
submitted comments, asking the Cen-
ters for Medicare and Medicaid Serv-
ices to strengthen the proposed provi-
sion as much as the existing statute al-
lows. Of course, we ought to finalize 
that proposed rule without delay. 
In 
addition 
to 
ending 
DIR 
fee 
clawbacks, I am committed to passing 
Grassley-Wyden. 
I 
hope, 
now 
that 
Democrats worked on Build Back Bet-
ter last year with provisions that they 
thought would reduce pharmaceutical 
drugs—and it doesn’t seem to be mov-
ing—that, instead of going the partisan 
way, they would take a look at a bipar-
tisan way of trying to get something 
done on prescription drugs and, at the 
same time, end the DIR fee clawback. 
This bill, as a whole, besides dealing 
with the clawbacks, will lower pre-
scription drug costs in a comprehensive 
manner. It actually takes on Big 
Pharma. You probably know that, in 
this body, there are some people who 
say we should just leave Big Pharma 
alone, but I know that they do wonder-
ful work. I know they have to have 
their money for research, and I know 
they have to be able to market their 
products in a free market way, but 
when you have these big pharma-
ceutical price increases maybe a couple 
of times a year, it is time we do some-
thing about it. 
Besides 
this 
clawback 
provision, 
Grassley-Wyden caps out-of-pocket ex-
penses, eliminates the doughnut hole, 
and in dealing with these price in-
creases every year, it caps rising prices 
at the inflation price index. It also

brings more sunshine and account-
ability, particularly to the pharmacy 
benefit managers. 
Nobody seems to be able to tell us 
anything as to what goes on between 
the health insurance companies, the 
pharmaceutical companies, the PBMs, 
and the local pharmacists and then 
how that affects the consumer. We 
ought to know exactly where those 
moneys go and what those negotiations 
are, and Grassley-Wyden does some-
thing about that. 
So I urge my colleagues to join 
Wyden and me in that effort. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
H.R. 3076 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I 
have taken the opportunity—well, all 
the time I have been in Congress—to 
speak in support of Congress acting to 
reform and improve the Postal Service. 
I am here again today, and I am 
pleased with what I think is going to 
transpire here within the next hour. I 
again express my strong support for 
the Postal Service Reform Act, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
critical, important piece of legislation. 
The U.S. Postal Service is an indis-
pensable piece of American infrastruc-
ture nationwide. Back in my home 
State of Kansas, the rural communities 
are especially reliant on the Postal 
Service for the essential public services 
the Agency and its employees provide. 
However, due to the closure of nu-
merous rural processing facilities in 
Kansas and post office consolidations 
and closures, the quality of service and 
efficiency of the Postal Service has sig-
nificantly declined. The reduced effec-
tiveness of the Postal Service hurts 
Americans across the board, but it has 
the most detrimental impact on rural 
places like Kansas. 
For as long as I have served in Con-
gress, Kansans have detailed to me the 
adverse impact the declining quality of 
the U.S. Postal Service has had on 
their lives and have expressed the need 
for reforms to improve its efficacy. 
The concerns I hear from Kansans 
are characteristic of the larger picture. 
The Postal Service is struggling to 
keep up with its service commitments 
while still maintaining fiscal stability. 
Over the past decade, the Postal Serv-
ice has slowly—and sometimes quick-
ly—eliminated services; and in that 
elimination of services, it created what 
I call a death spiral: shorter hours, 
fewer post offices, mail processing fa-
cilities further away and fewer of 
them. 
This makes life extremely difficult 
for Kansans, especially rural and high-
ly rural Kansans who rely upon the 
Postal Service to deliver essential 
items like medications because there 
simply isn’t a pharmacy for pickup de-
livery nearby. And the customer looks 
for delivery services outside the U.S. 
Postal Service when the service is in-
sufficient, and the Postal Service con-
tinues then to lose more revenue. 
For as long as I have been in Con-
gress, I think I have met with every 
Postmaster General, and I have really 
delivered two messages—one related to 
this point I am making right now, 
which is the solution to the Postal 
Service’s financial condition can’t sim-
ply be reducing the services. I have 
also suggested that instead of hiring 
high-priced 
consultants, 
the 
Post-
master General and the Postal Service 
should consult with their own employ-
ees about suggestions of how to deliver 
better service in a more effective and 
efficient way and save revenue. 
Serving rural States like my own, I 
understand well the crippling impact 
that losing postal service would have 
on rural communities across the coun-
try; that is why I have repeatedly 
acted on my conversations with Kan-
sans 
by 
encouraging 
congressional 
focus on Postal Service issues and have 
worked to get postal reform legislation 
passed for nearly a decade. 
My colleague on the Senate floor 
with me this afternoon, Senator Tom 
Carper of Delaware, I have joined him 
on many occasions in the past several 
sessions of Congress. We are cospon-
sors—lead Republican and lead Demo-
crat—in reform legislation, and I have 
met with him and the Postmaster Gen-
eral of the U.S. Postal Service numer-
ous times. We recognize that smart re-
forms were needed to make certain the 
Postal Service could compete in this 
digital age, increase revenue, and not 
become a taxpayer liability. 
Several provisions of the legislation 
that Senator CARPER and I have intro-
duced are included in the Postal Serv-
ice Reform Act we are considering 
today: 
the 
elimination 
of 
the 
prefunding 
requirements 
of 
retiree 
health benefits, allowing the Postal 
Service to enter into agreements with 
other governmental entities for new 
avenues of revenue, and making 6-day 
delivery permanent by law. 
In so many instances in my conversa-
tions with Kansans at a townhall meet-
ing or on the street or talking to the 
newspaper editor, the lack of timely 
delivery of the mail has become in-
creasingly a problem; and what would 
one expect when the Postal Service is 
closing post offices, shortening its 
hours and, most importantly, closing 
processing facilities? 
I hope to make the case to the U.S. 
Postal Service after passage of this leg-
islation that the postal processing fa-
cilities that have been closed in Kansas 
should be considered for reopening—in 
fact, should be reopened. Today, the 
mail will leave a rural community, go 
to some neighboring State—Nebraska 
or Texas or Missouri—only to be re-
turned to the postal patron who lives a 
block from the person who mailed the 
letter to begin with. We need the re-
turn of those postal processing facili-
ties, and their departure had dramatic 
and consequential effects upon the 
Postal Service. 
I am pleased that the efforts of my 
colleagues and I have culminated now 
in the Postal Service Reform Act. 
From listening to Kansans, I have rec-
ognized for years that Congress must 
act with the Postal Service on a more 
sustainable path, and this week, the 
Senate will finally address this long-
standing issue—address it in a way 
that a bill will become law. 
Congressional action on postal re-
form will allow the Postal Service to 
continue serving rural America with-
out the possibility of imminent service 
reductions and the uncertainty of the 
future of the Agency. 
From the veterans waiting on crit-
ical medications to be delivered from 
the VA, to the farmer in rural Kansas 
needing a part for his or her machin-
ery, to the grandparent just waiting to 
send a birthday card to a grandchild, 
this legislation puts us on a path to 
making certain the Postal Service can 
continue to be relied on to deliver 
when it matters most. 
I thank those who work in the post 
office and the Postal Service in my 
home State of Kansas, many of whom I 
know, and—despite the challenges pre-
sented because of the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice’s decisions over the past decade— 
have worked hard to make sure that 
the mail is delivered and delivered on 
time and make sure that their cus-
tomer, the postal patron, is cared for. 
To ensure the Postal Service main-
tains its vital public services, I urge 
my colleagues in the Senate to support 
the Postal Service Reform Act when it 
arrives on the Senate floor shortly for 
a vote. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
stand in solidarity with my friend from 
Kansas. I say to Senator MORAN: Thank 
you for your great leadership and for 
allowing me to be your wingman as we 
do our best, not just to save the Postal 
Service, but to make sure that they are 
robust and germane to the futures— 
germane to the future and integral to 
the future of our country as they have 
been for the last 200-plus years. 
When folks in Delaware gathered—we 
had about 25 men who gathered in a 
place called Dover, DE, on December 7, 
1787. We voted, after debating for 3 
days a draft Constitution. We adopted 
it unanimously and sent it off to the 
other 12 Colonies. 
One element in the Constitution that 
was sent to us from Philadelphia by 
our Founding Fathers was the creation 
of a Postal Service—a Postal Service. 
It has been mentioned before that the 
first Postmaster General 
was 
Ben 
Franklin, of all people. What the 
Founding Fathers had in mind was a 
way to bind us together as a country— 
to bind us together as a country. The 
idea of being able to communicate 
through the mail, that was important; 
the idea of fostering greater economic 
growth, that was important. But they 
also were looking for a way to pull us 
together as a new nation, and the Post-
al Service was integral to doing that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1041 
March 8, 2022 
Over the years, the Postal Service 
has changed. For the most part, I think 
it has changed in good ways. It used to 
be people got their mail by going to 
post offices that were maybe in the 
community where they lived or close 
to the community where they lived, 
but they had to go to the post office to 
get it. 
Eventually, the mail was delivered to 
farms and to homes and to businesses 
across the country, and people didn’t 
have to leave their homes to get the 
mail. There was a time, not that long 
ago, when we didn’t have the internet, 
and if we wanted to communicate—we 
wanted to send letters to people or 
cards to people, a lot of gifts to peo-
ple—we would use the Postal Service. 
Today, we can use the internet. The 
internet doth taketh from the Postal 
Service—taketh and giveth away. A lot 
of folks, well, they just hit a ‘‘send’’ 
button for a birthday card or a Christ-
mas card or any kind of holiday card. 
They used to send the actual cards; a 
lot of people don’t do that anymore. 
If you look at the financial condition 
of the Postal Service, one of the things 
that has happened most noticeably in 
the last 10, 15, 20 years is a drop in first 
class mail, and a large part of that is 
from the internet. I would like to say 
again the internet taketh and it giveth 
away. 
One of the great things that comes 
out of the internet is that a lot of peo-
ple are ordering items over the inter-
net for purchase. A lot of people order 
food, but a lot of people order clothes; 
they order shoes; they order all kinds 
of things. And you know who has a 
chance to deliver it? The Postal Serv-
ice. The Postal Service delivers, not 
just 1 day a week, but 7 days a week. 
They are omnipresent. 
And as we hear Johnny Cash—every 
time I turn on my TV, I hear Johnny 
Cash singing ‘‘I’ve Been Everywhere, 
Man,’’ and the Postal Service still goes 
everywhere, man. 
They also have a great partnership 
with—believe it or not—UPS and a 
great partnership with FedEx. FedEx 
and UPS, they don’t want to go to 
every mailbox in the country every 
day. The Postal Service does it at least 
6 days a week. And what the Postal 
Service does in a partnership with UPS 
and FedEx is take a handoff and deliver 
the last mile, last 5 miles, last 10 miles 
to the places that the Postal Service is 
going to go to anyway. 
I mean, one of the challenges that 
the Postal Service has had to try to 
balance their books, their finances, 
comes—I remember when I was Gov-
ernor of Delaware and going to the rat-
ing agencies, and the rating agencies 
said to us—before they lowered our 
credit rating a long time ago—they 
said: You don’t have a pension fund. 
You haven’t funded your pension costs 
for your pensioners. And so we created 
a pension fund fully funded. 
After we had done that—later on, we 
finally got a AAA credit rating years 
later. One of the things they said is: 
You still haven’t fully offset the 
healthcare costs for your pensioners. 
For us, that was a concern, but not an 
enormous concern, because our pen-
sioners had access—they were covered 
under Medicare. 
Unfortunately, for the Postal Serv-
ice—the Postal Service has paid into 
Medicare for years for their employees. 
Unfortunately, 
when 
those 
retirees 
reach the age of 65, they don’t have full 
access to the full benefits of Medicare. 
That is not right. These are benefits 
paid for by the employee of the Postal 
Service, and this legislation fixes that 
to make sure that the right thing is 
done. The benefits that have been paid 
for through Medicare are actually in-
ured to and flow to the pensioners of 
the Postal Service. 
The other thing that I would mention 
is 6-day service. I used to see—good 
service by the Postal Service would be 
maybe 1-day service for local maybe in 
the same city, 2-day service maybe to 
other parts of the State, 3-day service 
coast-to-coast; and the legislation that 
is before us today calls for delivery 
within 6 days. For me, that is not good 
enough, and my hope is we can come 
back and somehow better replace or 
better restore the term service. 
Having said that, the Postal Service 
has a Board of Governors; and every 
now and then, Presidents have the op-
portunity to nominate people to serve 
on the Board of Governors. We have the 
opportunity to vote them up or down. 
We need people on the Board of Gov-
ernors who are very good at figuring 
out: How do we help the Postal Service 
monetize the burden of going to every 
single mailbox in the country 6 days a 
week? How do we do that? How do we 
help the Postal Service turn that into 
financial opportunity, much as they 
have with UPS and FedEx? And are 
there other ways, as well? Delivering 
medicines is a great example there, and 
there are other examples—vote by 
mail. I think we are only scratching 
the surface on vote by mail. Those are 
all ideas that help the Postal Service 
monetize and realize revenue from this 
responsibility to go to every mailbox in 
the country. 
One last thing I would mention that 
is not in this legislation is postal vehi-
cles—postal 
vehicles. 
There 
are 
a 
bunch of them—I think well over 
150,000 across the country. Almost 
every one is gas- and diesel-driven. 
You have seen others—UPS, FedEx, 
Amazon, others with big fleets—are 
transitioning away from gas and diesel, 
and they are doing it rather quickly. 
We are seeing the same kind of trans-
formation in the vehicles that we 
drive. Why is it important? Because we 
have way, way, way too much carbon 
dioxide in the air. It is creating not 
just climate change, but it is creating 
a climate crisis. 
My State—we are the lowest lying 
State in the country. My State is sink-
ing. The seas around us are rising. 
Down in Louisiana, every 100 minutes, 
they lose a piece of land to the ocean 
the size of a football field—every 100 
minutes. If you go out on the West 
Coast, you had wildfires each year— 
last year bigger than my State. Tem-
peratures in the Arctic Circle reached, 
I think, last year, 90 degrees—90 de-
grees. There were more named hurri-
canes in the last year than any year in 
history. 
The 
hottest 
summers 
on 
record. 
Something is going on here, and what 
it is, is way too much carbon in the air. 
A lot of that carbon is coming from 
mobile sources, including the vehicles 
we drive, including the fleets like the 
Postal fleet. The Postal Service’s fleet 
is about 25 years old on average. They 
have the opportunity here to update 
that. The cost of moving to electric ve-
hicles and having charging stations is a 
cost that the Postal Service says—I 
think somewhat generously—that we, 
as taxpayers, need to help underwrite 
that cost. 
Having said that, the Postal Service 
and their calculation for buying gas 
and diesel-fired vehicles to replace 
their 
fleet, 
I 
believe—my 
under-
standing is they are using, as an as-
sumption for the cost of gas and diesel 
fleet, $2 a gallon charge for gas and die-
sel going forward—$2. We would like to 
see $2, wouldn’t we? That is just basi-
cally understating by half the cost of 
gas and diesel for future of the fleet, 
and that needs to be fixed. 
We have a great opportunity to make 
sure that the Postal Service is not just 
delivering the mail rain, snow, or 
shine, but they are also doing so in a 
way that helps us on the climate crisis 
side. We can do both, and we need to do 
both. 
I will close by saying this: I want to 
thank and applaud the leadership of 
our chair and ranking member of the 
committee of jurisdiction here—our 
chair, GARY PETERS, and ranking mem-
ber, ROB PORTMAN. Thank you and your 
staffs for your work on this and for a 
lot of other folks who have worked on 
this 
before—most 
certainly, 
JERRY 
MORAN and his team. 
I especially want to thank the mem-
bers of my staff who have worked on 
these issues forever. 
And 
my 
friend 
SUSAN
COLLINS— 
SUSAN is not on the floor right now, 
our Senator from Maine—but she has 
spent, God knows, plenty of time and 
effort working with me and others on 
these issues. 
This is not the end. This is not the 
end in terms of what we need to do on 
Postal. This is maybe the beginning of 
the end; this the end of the beginning, 
but it is a good end of the beginning. 
We need to build on this and go forward 
on this, and I hope and pray that that 
is exactly what we do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I notice 
the arrival of Senator HAWLEY. I think 
we are both prepared at this point for 
me to make a unanimous consent re-
quest, and I would like to do so now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1042 
March 8, 2022 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to execu-
tive session to consider the following 
nominations: Calendar Nos. 599, 477, 
and 472; that the nominations be con-
firmed; the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nominations; that any re-
lated statements be printed in the 
RECORD; and that the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion and the Senate resume legislative 
session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I want to say at 
the outset that it is always a privilege 
to work with Senator REED
on the 
Armed Services Committee in every 
capacity we get to work together, and 
I look forward to that going forward. 
What we are being asked to do—the 
Senate is being asked to do today, how-
ever, is to fast-track nominees for lead-
ership positions in the Department of 
Defense to carry out a foreign policy 
that is manifestly failing. This admin-
istration is careening from one crisis 
to another, endangering the security of 
the American people, endangering the 
security of the world. 
When the Senator mentioned just a 
moment ago the situation in Ukraine, 
you don’t have to look any further 
than there to see the crisis—the latest 
crisis that the Biden administration 
has led this Nation into. 
To begin with, the administration 
failed to deter Vladimir Putin and his 
Russian invasion before it happened. 
They failed to actually check Putin 
when it would have really mattered. 
How did they do this? Well, for start-
ers, when President Biden came to of-
fice, he opened up Russia’s pipelines, 
and then he shut down America’s pipe-
lines. He handed our energy independ-
ence that the Senator was just men-
tioning—he handed our energy inde-
pendence away. He gave it away. And 
who stepped in to fill the void? The 
Russians. 
What is Russia? It is not so much a 
country as it is a gas station, and 
Putin is pumping and pumping and 
pumping. What is financing his war in 
Ukraine? It is not least our energy 
policies that are giving away our en-
ergy independence, giving away our en-
ergy dominance, and green-lighting his 
energy production. That is what Joe 
Biden did when he first came to office— 
green-lighting his production, shutting 
down our production. 
But what else? President Biden had 
the opportunity to provide lethal mili-
tary aid to Ukraine last spring when 
the Ukrainians first requested it. He 
said no. In fact, I believe he said no re-
peatedly for much of the year last 
year. That turns out to have been a 
very poor decision. 
Now, today, deterrence having failed, 
the Russians engaged in an illegal in-
vasion of a sovereign nation, threat-
ening the stability of Europe, the secu-
rity of Europe, and, of course, endan-
gering our own national security, what 
is the President doing? What is Presi-
dent Biden doing? Is he turning back 
on American energy production? Is he 
sanctioning the Russian energy sector? 
No. 
Just today, finally, he was dragged 
kicking and screaming to finally agree 
that this country will no longer import 
Russia’s blood oil. Remember, he had 
us importing over 670,000 barrels of 
Russian oil every single day. Today, he 
announced finally, belatedly, we won’t 
do that anymore. But what is he doing 
instead? He is going to every petty dic-
tator on the face of the map and beg-
ging them to make up the difference. 
We learned that the President’s team 
has been in touch with Maduro’s re-
gime—the murderous Maduro regime— 
in Venezuela and is preparing to offer 
them a special package that will ease 
the restrictions, ease the sanctions, 
ease the punishment on that outlaw re-
gime and get them to make up the dif-
ference in oil production from Russia. 
We learned that the President is po-
tentially planning a trip to Saudi Ara-
bia to ask the Saudis to increase their 
oil production to make up the dif-
ference from the Russians. I wonder if 
the topic of Jamal Khashoggi will 
come up in those meetings. I certainly 
hope it will. 
President Biden once said that he 
would make Saudi Arabia ‘‘pay the 
price, and make them in fact the pa-
riah that they are.’’ I guess that is no 
longer the policy of the U.S. Govern-
ment because here is what we are re-
duced to under this administration: We 
are reduced to begging our enemies— 
our enemies, the dictators of the 
world—we are reduced to begging them 
to bail out a foreign policy that is fail-
ing, not least because this administra-
tion will not allow American workers 
to turn on American energy. 
I take it from the President’s re-
marks and from the President’s policy 
that he has no objection in principle to 
pumping more oil and gas. Apparently 
he doesn’t, so this can’t be about cli-
mate change. He is fine with more oil 
production but not in this country, not 
by American workers. Heaven forbid 
American workers be put back to work. 
Heaven forbid American workers actu-
ally earn more. Heaven forbid the 
American people be able to pay less at 
the pump, as Joe Biden’s prices drive 
gas prices through the roof. No, this is 
the policy of weakness, fecklessness 
that this President has given us. 
Let’s not forget where it began. It 
began with Afghanistan. And that is 
the reason I am here on the floor today 
in particular. 
It has been months now—months— 
since the fall of Afghanistan. This ad-
ministration has lost two nations in 
the space of barely 6 months. The Af-
ghanistan debacle is the worst foreign 
policy debacle in this country’s history 
since Vietnam—although stay tuned, 
the way this administration is going— 
and what has this Congress done about 
it? Who has been held accountable for 
it? 
I have come to this floor over and 
over and over to ask for account-
ability. Has someone been fired? No. 
Has someone been relieved of duty? No. 
I was here just a few weeks ago after 
the Washington Post reported on a 
2,000-page investigation done by Cen-
tral Command into the fall of Afghani-
stan. Since that time, my team and I 
have been through all 2,000-plus pages. 
I would just like to point out that we 
learned about this investigative report 
not from a hearing conducted by this 
body but from an investigative report 
by a newspaper. I am glad somebody 
has some interest in what happened in 
Afghanistan. Sadly, it seems not to be 
this Chamber. 
Here are some of the things that we 
learned in this 2,000-page investigative 
report about Afghanistan: 
We learned from GEN Scott Miller, 
who was the commander of U.S. forces 
in Afghanistan in early 2021, that he 
was extremely worried from May 2 on-
ward as he saw key districts fall. In 
fact, General Miller testified to us that 
he warned Secretary Austin and Gen-
eral Milley, Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs, as early as March or April that 
the Afghan security forces might col-
lapse rapidly once we withdrew forces. 
Now this report documents it and 
says, indeed, there is evidence that he 
was very worried, that he was warning 
that the collapse of Afghanistan would 
come quickly, he was warning that it 
would be imminent. But what did the 
Biden administration do? Did they 
order the evacuation of our civilians? 
Did they plan for the possible fall of 
the Afghan Government? No. The re-
port goes on to detail that the National 
Security Council and the State Depart-
ment showed a total lack of urgency 
right up until the final hours before 
the fall of Kabul. 
We learned that RDML Peter Vasely, 
who took over for General Miller last 
spring and commanded U.S. forces in 
Afghanistan during the final stages of 
the withdrawal, provided assessments 
weeks before the fall of Kabul that the 
trajectory of Afghanistan was in a 
downward spiral—this is a quote from 
the report—and was likely not recover-
able. 
The report goes on to say this: Rear 
Admiral Vasely ‘‘was trying to get the 
Ambassador to see the security threat 
for what it really was.’’ There were as 
many as 10 districts falling every day, 
getting closer and closer to Kabul. 
‘‘The embassy needed to position for 
withdrawal, but the Ambassador didn’t 
get it.’’ 
These are just a few of the details in 
this 2,000-page report showing that our 
military commanders warned over and 
over and over that Kabul was on the

verge of collapse, that the security 
dangers were mounting, that civilians 
needed to be evacuated, and that we 
needed to change course, and this ad-
ministration did nothing. What hap-
pened as a result? Thirteen service-
members are dead, including one from 
my own State. 
I will never forget talking to his fam-
ily, his father, less than 48 hours after 
this young man, LCpl Jared Schmitz, 
lost his life, along with 12 others who 
bravely served this country, giving the 
uttermost of their devotion. But it 
didn’t have to be that way. 
Here is my point: This body should be 
hearing from these commanders, from 
these men and women who have testi-
fied in this report, who have given evi-
dence about what happened in Afghani-
stan. We should be hearing from them 
in public, under oath—no more private 
briefings; no more closed-session brief-
ings. We should hear from Secretary 
Austin. We should hear from General 
Milley. We should hear from the com-
manders—General Miller—under oath. 
They should come and testify about 
this report. 
We should do our job, and until we 
do, I will not consent to allow the Sen-
ate to bypass regular order and fast- 
track the nominations of yet more 
leadership positions to continue car-
rying on a failed policy. I will not do it. 
There is a crisis in Ukraine. There is 
a crisis in Afghanistan. Crises multiply 
across the world at the hands of this 
administration, and still, this Congress 
refuses to reverse course and refuses to 
provide the most basic oversight that 
it is charged with providing. 
I don’t think it is too much to ask, in 
the face of this, in the face of these dis-
asters, that we have the curiosity to at 
least have an open hearing, to at least 
ask who should be accountable and 
what should be done. 
So I want to say again, I appreciate 
Senator REED’s earnestness on this 
issue. I appreciate the fact that he 
doesn’t control the floor. 
My final point, I would note, as I 
look toward the clock here, last week, 
if my memory serves, of the 4 days we 
were in session, we took a total of four 
votes in the U.S. Senate last week. If 
these nominees were as important as 
they say they are, we could have voted 
last week. We could have voted earlier 
today. 
Now, Senator REED doesn’t control 
the floor, but I might just note to the 
majority leader that maybe instead of 
taking a vacation tomorrow, which I 
gather is the plan, that maybe the Sen-
ate ought to be here and working, and 
maybe we ought to be here and voting, 
because until there is some account-
ability for what happened in Afghani-
stan, for what is happening with this 
administration’s foreign policy, I am 
going to ask the Senate to observe reg-
ular order and do its job and to vote. 
With that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I think one 
of the messages that the Senator from 
Missouri was trying to convey is ‘‘do 
our job.’’ One of our fundamental jobs 
is to review, vote on, and confirm or 
not confirm nominees to critical posi-
tions in the Department of Defense, 
and this effort has completely frus-
trated that goal of doing our job. 
We have seen repeated blockage of 
nominees who are fully qualified, forc-
ing votes—and the gentleman from 
Missouri is talking about we should 
have had votes this week—forcing 
votes because one or two people object. 
And, of course, the final outcome is 90 
votes, 85 votes in favor of the nominee. 
The will of the Senate was very clear: 
These people should be in their office, 
doing their jobs, helping us maintain 
our security, not subject to the whims 
and the will of one or two people. 
The nominees I just referred to are 
three individuals nominated to critical 
positions within the Department of De-
fense. The Armed Services Committee 
held hearings on all three of these 
nominations months ago, and all three 
were reported out of the committee by 
voice vote. I am unaware of any objec-
tions to these nominees relating to 
their qualifications for the positions 
for which they have been nominated. 
I need not remind my colleagues that 
with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a 
war of choice against a modern, func-
tioning democracy, how critical it is to 
have people in place in the Department 
of Defense. 
It is very difficult to complain about 
the policy of the administration when 
there has been a deliberate attempt for 
more than a year to delay critical 
nominees from taking their position in 
that Department. 
And, more importantly, I think this 
is a trend that was observed by the 
Commission on the National Defense 
Strategy under President Trump. It 
said: 
The implementation of the National De-
fense Strategy must feature empowered ci-
vilians fulfilling their statutory responsibil-
ities, particularly regarding issues of force 
management. . . . Strong civilian oversight 
is an essential hallmark of civil-military re-
lations codified in the Constitution and em-
braced throughout the nation’s history. 
What is frustrating that principle? 
Actions like today, where fully quali-
fied individuals who pass by voice vote 
through the committee are held up. If 
there is a weakness—that has been 
identified by other sources in the Na-
tional Defense Strategy at the Depart-
ment of Defense—it is in one case the 
lack of sufficient civilian leadership 
and continuity, and that is exactly 
what this action today will continue to 
foster. 
For example, Mr. Ashish Vazirani 
was reported out of committee on De-
cember 8 and would become the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense for Per-
sonnel and Readiness, the No. 2 official 
in the Department in charge of mili-
tary and civilian policy and the readi-
ness of our Armed Forces. 
Mr. Alex Wagner was reported out of 
the committee in October of last year, 
and he would become the Assistant 
Secretary of the Air Force for Man-
power and Reserve Affairs, the senior 
official within the Department of the 
Air Force with responsibility for mili-
tary and civilian personnel policy and 
the readiness of Air Force and Space 
Force personnel. 
Ms. Rachel Jacobson was reported 
out of the committee in October of last 
year, and she would become the Assist-
ant Secretary of the Army for Energy, 
Installation, and the Environment. She 
will be responsible for managing the 
Army’s physical footprint and, particu-
larly, she will oversee contracts that 
would increase installation resilience 
and the modernization of Army infra-
structure, particularly with regard to 
energy, which is one of the issues that 
we are talking about with great em-
phasis today and in the proceeding sev-
eral weeks. 
All of these positions are critically 
important to the Department of De-
fense. And I am unaware of any sub-
stantive objection to these nominees 
on the basis of their qualifications. The 
sooner they assume their offices, the 
better for the Department’s ability to 
tackle the challenges on behalf of serv-
icemembers and their families. 
I also think it is important to recog-
nize some of that discussion about the 
situation in Ukraine. The Biden admin-
istration sent $650 million in aid—mili-
tary assistance and aid—to the Ukrain-
ian Government in the last year, far 
surpassing anything that was done in 
the Trump administration. In fact, we 
spent many hours here on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate in an impeachment 
proceeding based on what many of us 
thought was the attempt by then- 
President Trump to use military aid to 
extract a political concession from 
President Zelenskyy. That is quite a 
stark difference than what President 
Biden’s administration has been doing 
for the last year. 
There was a reference made to deal-
ing with Saudi Arabia. Well, President 
Trump’s first trip overseas was to 
Saudi 
Arabia 
to 
cavort 
with 
his 
friends, the Kings and Princes of Saudi 
Arabia. His son-in-law made multiple 
trips over there, and it wasn’t in the 
spirit of condemnation; it was in the 
spirit of businesslike behavior, I would 
say. Khashoggi was killed by agents of 
MBS, the Crown Prince, but the details 
of the report were never released by 
the Trump administration. President 
Biden released those details, earning, I 
think, the enmity of the Crown Prince. 
So this story of the ineffectuality of 
the 
Biden 
administration 
is 
com-
pletely, in my view, without basis. 
What we have seen—and I think the 
Presiding Officer recognizes it as a 
member of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee—is probably the most sophisti-
cated development of an alliance to op-
pose tyranny that we have seen in 
many, many years. 
When the whole world is united by 
the diplomacy of this administration 
to stand up against Vladimir Putin—

and I must say practically the whole 
world. That is an amazing demonstra-
tion of diplomacy and statesmanship. 
And it happened because of the leader-
ship of the President, the leadership of 
Secretary Blinken, the leadership of 
Secretary Austin. And, again, when 
you have Switzerland joining in sanc-
tioning a country—the greatest neutral 
nation in the world—that is a remark-
able accomplishment. 
We still have a long way to go. The 
outcome is still very much uncertain, 
but to date, the President and his ad-
ministration has done an extraordinary 
job. 
Afghanistan is an issue that we have 
dealt with for 20 years. One of the first 
things we did was to ensure that in the 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
there was an independent study which 
will be conducted, but it is not going to 
focus on the last 2 weeks; it is going to 
focus on 20 years. It is going to assess 
whether the decision to invade Iraq 
was a critical strategic mistake—which 
I think it was. That is why I opposed it 
originally. 
It is going to look at the Doha agree-
ment, in which the Trump administra-
tion basically said, ‘‘We are leaving,’’ 
which gave the Taliban one of their 
greatest psychological and, indeed, in a 
way, military weapons because they 
went from village to village and said: 
Here it is, signed, sealed, and delivered. 
They are going. And when they go, who 
are you going to be with, Ghani or us? 
So in any way to estimate the culpa-
bility, the responsibility of our role in 
Afghanistan, it will take that kind of 
20-year look by independent experts 
who are concerned to find the truth, 
not to find a political argument. 
I am just very disappointed that we 
are going to continue to avoid our duty 
to ensure that there are civilians in the 
Department of Defense who are able to 
carry out the policy of the United 
States, which is the basic principle of 
civil and military relations in the 
United States and in the Constitution 
of the United States. 
ENERGY 
Mr. President, retaining my time, I 
would now like to resume my com-
ments with respect to the energy situa-
tion and the United States. 
As I indicated previously, the inva-
sion of Ukraine has revealed the vul-
nerability that our dependence on oil 
creates for our economy and for aver-
age Americans trying to fill up their 
cars and pay their heating bills. 
The fact is, the United States has 
sufficient domestic production to meet 
our energy needs today. We are pro-
ducing more oil and refined product 
than ever before. Oil production was up 
more than half a million barrels a day 
from January to December of last year 
and is expected to rise even more this 
year, which I would assume would 
mean that more and more Americans 
are working in the oilfields and else-
where. In fact, I believe, last year, the 
workforce grew about 6.6 million jobs, 
which we hadn’t seen in the last year 
or two of the Trump administration. 
Unemployment 
now 
is 
hovering 
around 4 percent. Gross domestic prod-
uct has been significant and much 
more so than the preceding several 
years. But we do have problems eco-
nomically, and some of those problems 
are related to the international oil sup-
ply. Now, we certainly don’t need Rus-
sian oil and I have said we should stop 
importing it and I am glad that this 
morning the President announced the 
United States will officially ban the 
importation of oil from Russia, deny-
ing Putin a key revenue source for his 
illegal war. This is something both 
Democrats and Republicans have called 
for, and the American people should 
know this policy choice will likely af-
fect the price of gasoline. 
But even if we don’t use Russian oil, 
everyone needs to know that petroleum 
is traded on the world market, and the 
United States is part of that world 
market. The chaos Putin is sowing in 
Europe will continue to have an effect 
here regardless of where we get our oil. 
Our energy policy of overreliance on 
fossil fuels is a matter of national secu-
rity, and it is time we embrace all that 
it entails. 
The reality of a world market, com-
bined with the impact on regular 
Americans who need to fill up their 
cars, means the United States will 
have to make some tough choices on 
whom we buy from if we are not buying 
from Russia. We will have to more 
carefully consider what we are export-
ing, how we will prevent profiteering, 
and what pain people should expect at 
the pump. 
If the climate crisis, raging fires, his-
toric droughts, and flooding aren’t 
enough to convince our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle of the need 
to kick our oil addiction, I hope the na-
tional 
security 
and 
economic 
vulnerabilities exposed by Russia’s in-
vasion of Ukraine will be enough. As 
long as we base our energy future on 
oil, we choose to make ourselves vul-
nerable. 
Unfortunately, many of my Repub-
lican colleagues don’t seem to recog-
nize that reality. Instead, they focus 
on never-built pipelines geared toward 
exporting our oil, not using it here in 
the United States. Most of the oil that 
was going through the pipeline that 
President Biden—I think, because of 
many, many considerations—decided 
against was destined for exportation, 
not for use here in the United States, 
or they make claims about energy pro-
duction under Democratic Presidents 
that either contort or suspend reality. 
It is time—to borrow the phrase from 
my Rhode Island colleague, Senator 
WHITEHOUSE—it is time to wake up. In-
deed, their solution to higher gas 
prices is more oil dependency. 
The bottom line is that we need to 
accelerate the transition to clean, re-
newable energy sources that aren’t 
subject to worldwide scarcity and ma-
nipulation by our adversary. There are, 
however, things we should do in the 
short term to help consumers. 
Again, the advocates for the oil com-
panies, the advocates for special tax ar-
rangements, the advocates to continue 
to pump oil and pump oil and pump oil 
are playing right, in my sense, into the 
hands of Putin because if our world 
economy is based on hydrocarbons, 
then Russia is going to make some 
money. If our world economy is based 
on other sources of power—alternative 
sources of power—then his cash reg-
ister is going to ring close to zero. 
I am pleased that President Biden lis-
tened to me and others in Congress and 
decided to tap into the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to help bring down the 
price of oil. He wisely coordinated the 
release of 60 million barrels with our 
international 
partners. 
The 
action 
sends a reassuring signal to markets, 
but we may need to release more to 
tamp down prices. We also need to in-
sist that our Middle East partners do 
more to increase production to help 
stabilize prices and meet demand in 
Europe. 
We should also ask domestic oil and 
gas producers to pitch in. Despite the 
other side of the aisle’s claims about 
the economy, Big Oil is earning some 
of its highest profits in years. They are 
not simply passing on the cost—addi-
tional cost—to the consumer reluc-
tantly 
and 
grudgingly 
and 
sadly. 
ExxonMobil and Chevron, for example, 
reported a combined net annual profit 
of nearly $38.6 billion in 2021, but are 
they investing those profits in new pro-
duction, particularly when they have 
14 million acres in unused leases? No. 
Instead, they are issuing higher divi-
dends and buying back stock to boost 
share prices. These windfall profits 
should be used to help consumers, not 
their billionaire investors. 
Of course, the easiest way to insulate 
ourselves from higher costs is to be-
come more energy efficient. When we 
consume less, we pay less. That is why 
I have long advocated better fuel econ-
omy standards for cars and trucks, 
something that the last administration 
worked against. Yes, the Trump admin-
istration tried to derail an increase in 
gas mileage that the automobile com-
panies were in favor of. Even when 
automakers said we should keep the 
tougher standards, Trump said no. 
Why? Let’s be more dependent on gaso-
line. It is not only to this country’s oil- 
producing benefit. Guess what. Putin 
benefits and others benefit. 
Fortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has a broader vision for a clean en-
ergy future that eases the burden on 
consumers. 
While there is much more to do, the 
bipartisan infrastructure law took im-
portant steps on this front. It invested 
$7.5 billion to build out a national net-
work of electric vehicle charges, $5 bil-
lion for electric buses, and $90 billion 
to improve public transit systems. 
It also includes $65 billion to upgrade 
our power infrastructure, including by 
building thousands of miles of new, re-
silient transmission lines to facilitate 
the expansion of renewable energy. And

S1045 
March 8, 2022 
we can’t just look at transportation be-
cause consumers are also facing the 
pinch on home energy prices. 
Now, last year, I worked to secure 
$4.5 billion in the American Rescue 
Plan for the Low-Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program to help consumers 
pay their energy bills. In the coming 
days, we will pass an omnibus appro-
priations bill to provide base funding 
for that program, which still lacks the 
resources to help all who qualify for as-
sistance. But we need to do more. 
We also need to make other long- 
term investments. In his State of the 
Union Address last week, President 
Biden emphasized the need to weath-
erize homes and businesses to be more 
energy efficient, which in turn lowers 
energy costs and reduces greenhouse 
gases and emissions, and I cannot agree 
more. 
It is why I have led the fight to fund 
the Weatherization Assistance Pro-
gram, which received $3.5 billion in the 
bipartisan infrastructure law. This pro-
gram has helped more than 7 million 
low-income families reduce their en-
ergy bills by making their homes more 
energy efficient. 
It saves participants nearly $300 in 
energy bills a year, and a Department 
of Energy study found that in 1 year, it 
reduced carbon emissions by more than 
2.2 million metric tons, the equivalent 
to taking more than a half a million 
cars off the road. 
To make the most of this invest-
ment, this week, I introduced the 
Weatherization 
Assistance 
Program 
Improvement Act along with Senators 
COLLINS, COONS, and SHAHEEN. Our bill 
would make critical updates, including 
increasing eligibility, raising the per 
unit funding level for weatherization 
projects, and setting aside funding to 
make critical health and safety repairs 
in conjunction with weatherization 
projects. Together, these reforms will 
make the program more effective and 
will help it serve even more households 
across the country. 
These are significant steps, but we 
need the full package of climate energy 
reforms that the President has been 
calling for, including tax credits and 
grants that would make clean energy, 
clean vehicles, and other clean tech-
nologies more affordable and better. 
If we do these things, we will make a 
huge difference in the lives of Ameri-
cans today and for generations to 
come. 
Just a final thought, I think one of 
the greatest nightmares that Vladimir 
Putin has is a world that is powered by 
electricity, not generated by hydro-
carbons, a world in which the gasoline 
and oil that he has in Russia is not 
worth $150 a barrel but $1.50 a barrel. 
We can do it, and it will be one of the 
most significant national security en-
deavors when we accomplish that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
H.R. 3076 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate the comments from my col-
league from Rhode Island. I would say 
‘‘all of the above’’ energy, so I do sup-
port the energy efficiency he was talk-
ing about and other opportunities to 
ensure we have the ability to be energy 
independent. But at a time when the 
price per gallon is over $4, on average, 
we also need to produce more in this 
country. 
And here we are at a time where we 
have an Executive order from the 
President, saying we are going to 
freeze all leases on public lands and 
waters. We have an Executive order 
from the President, obviously, stopping 
Keystone XL Pipeline. 
We have an Executive action by the 
President to rewrite the policies with 
regard to permitting that are in the 
waters of the United States that are 
very important to energy projects. So 
we have got to do it all because, other-
wise, without certainty, we are not 
going to get the oil and gas production 
we should have here to be able to sub-
stitute what we are getting from places 
like Russia. 
The President did the right thing by 
banning the Russian oil, but we ought 
to also be doing the right thing with 
regard to North American production. 
I stand today to support the Postal 
Service bill that is before us. We are 
nearing the end of a long journey to 
help the Postal Service and to help the 
Postmaster General to be able to im-
plement needed reforms. 
Last year, Senator PETERS—who I 
see is on the floor here—and I intro-
duced the Senate version of the Postal 
Reform Act. We had 28 cosponsors, 
equally divided between Republicans 
and Democrats. 
Why? Because the Postal Service is 
not a partisan issue. It is something 
that all of us should agree on. We need 
to save our Postal Service; otherwise, 
we are going to be in big trouble. In the 
next few years, I believe it would go in-
solvent otherwise. I believe we would 
be here talking about a big bailout. 
This is not a bailout. In fact, there is 
no appropriation in this legislation. 
The post office is really important to 
my constituents—young, old, rural, 
urban, everybody. That is why we have 
seen such strong bipartisan support 
when this bill passed the House of Rep-
resentatives by a vote of 342 to 92—that 
rarely 
happens 
in 
the 
House—and 
strong bipartisan support last night 
when the Senate cloture vote was 74 to 
17. 
Saving the post office is the right 
thing to do. Let’s face it. The fact of 
the matter is, the Postal Service is de-
livering less and less more profitable 
first-class mail to more and more 
places. That economic model just does 
not work, and that is a recipe for ruin 
if we don’t adjust to this new reality 
and make some necessary changes. 
Is it hard to make changes? Of 
course, it is, but it is the right thing to 
do. We have talked about it for years 
here. Finally, we came together, Re-
publican and Democrat, neither of us 
got exactly what we wanted, both had 
to make concessions, but we were actu-
ally doing the right thing for the coun-
try here in saving the post office. 
And I regularly hear about this from 
my constituents across Ohio; I am sure 
you hear the same. You hear it from 
your veterans. You hear it from some 
of your rural residents who depend on 
the post office for a lot, including their 
lifesaving medications. Families rely 
on the post office to deliver their rent 
checks on time, to pay their utility 
bills, to get their Social Security 
checks. 
In Ohio, we have got no-excuse absen-
tee voting. That has worked really well 
for over a decade now. But if you are a 
voter in Ohio, you want to get your ap-
plication in time, and you want to get 
your ballot in, in time. That all de-
pends on the post office. Small busi-
nesses in Ohio reach their customers 
primarily through direct mail now; 
that is through the post office. 
So this is really important that we 
put the post office on a sound financial 
footing. And, by the way, it can’t be 
done just with an act of Congress. 
What we are doing is complementing 
what the Postmaster General and the 
postal Board is doing in terms of seri-
ous reforms at the post office. They 
work together. In fact, the Postmaster 
General said this bill he strongly sup-
ports because it gives him the head-
room he needs, the financial breathing 
room he needs to make the other im-
portant reforms to save the post office. 
What do we do? First, we eliminate a 
very burdensome prefunding require-
ment for retiree health benefits. Con-
gress mandated this a decade or so ago. 
Regardless of age, current employees 
have to be prefunded. This has crippled 
the post office financially. By the way, 
no other Federal Agency has to do this, 
and private sector companies don’t do 
this. This is prefunding. The money 
will be there, but it is a matter of hav-
ing to prefund it that is crippling the 
post office financially. 
Second, we require the post office 
employees who are retiring, who have 
been paying into Medicare their entire 
careers, to enroll in Medicare Part B 
and to access Part D—something, by 
the way, that almost every private sec-
tor employer does. They are already in 
Part A. 
Third, we require the Postal Service 
to maintain its current standard of a 6- 
day-a-week delivery through an inte-
grated delivery network of mail and 
packages together so that those who 
rely on the Postal Service for their 
medications and other important needs 
are properly served. That 6-day-a-week 
delivery, by the way, is really impor-
tant to my constituents and to a lot of 
your constituents if you talk to them 
about it, particularly in the rural 
areas. 
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that after all of this, this bill 
will result in a savings to the taxpayer. 
The savings over the next 10 years is 
$1.5 billion. 
I would also like to note what this 
bill does not do because there has been

some misinformation out there. One, it 
does not appropriate new funds to the 
post office, period. Two, it does not 
change 
the 
accounting 
or 
costing 
structure for packages and letters so it 
does not disadvantage private-sector 
carriers. That is very important to me. 
This is the status quo that we are put-
ting in place here. It does not change 
the accounting or costing structure for 
packages and letters. 
Third, it does not allow the Postal 
Service to enter into new commercial 
services like postal banking. That is 
also very important to me. 
And contrary to the claims of this 
bill’s opponents, this bill does not im-
pact the solvency of the Medicare hos-
pital trust fund. That is the trust fund 
we all talk about. It is going belly-up 
in 2026. It does not affect it, period. 
CBO has actually written us something 
saying that, but it just makes sense. 
People are already in Part A. And this 
bill does not increase the Medicare 
Part B and Part D premiums based on 
the CBO analysis. Why? Partly because 
it is such a small number of people. 
Only 25 percent of postal employees 
were not already in Part B and Part D, 
so additional ones make very little dif-
ference. But part of it is they are pay-
ing their premiums. 
So let’s pass this bill. We also have a 
budget point of order before us that is 
coming up next. I want to be clear, 
again, CBO’s estimated $1.5 billion sav-
ings over the 10-year budget window 
that we have to use around here. How-
ever, CBO has estimated that this leg-
islation would likely increase on budg-
et deficits by $5 billion or more in at 
least one of the four 10-year periods be-
ginning in 2032. 
I would like to make three quick 
points: First, none of this deficit is re-
lated to the Medicare hospital insur-
ance trust fund for Part A. Again, that 
is the trust fund that we talk about a 
lot here because we are concerned 
about it, and it could be exhausted as 
early as 2026. CBO has said that trust 
fund will not be affected. Second, 
CBO’s deficit only addresses on-budget 
direct spending. It actually excludes 
all future savings to the post office, 
which are off-budget. 
Let me give you an example of that. 
The premiums that Postal Service em-
ployees are going to pay, that is not 
part of the calculation. 
Third, and finally, this budget point 
of order ignores that postal workers 
are entitled to Medicare Part B and 
Part D like any other eligible Amer-
ican worker. The bill simply requires 
future Postal Service retirees to access 
these benefits; the 25 percent that 
don’t already do it. Private-sector em-
ployers require their retirees to do the 
same thing. Of course, no one raises 
these budget points of orders on them. 
Right now, the post office is in trou-
ble, folks, and if we don’t do something 
and do something significant, working 
with the post office to make their own 
internal reforms, we are going to be in 
big trouble as I said earlier. 
Let’s move forward on this bill. Let’s 
make sure the post office is healthy 
going forward for all of our constitu-
ents. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be recognized for 
5 minutes of remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, in just a 
few moments, each of our colleagues 
will have the opportunity to cast a his-
toric vote to pass groundbreaking leg-
islation that will ensure that the U.S. 
Postal Service can continue its nearly 
250-year tradition of delivering service 
to the American people. 
The Postal Service is one of our Na-
tion’s most trusted and storied institu-
tions. Since the founding of the United 
States, the Postal Service has become 
a vital part of the fabric of our Nation 
for generations. 
It has served as an indispensable pub-
lic service that not only delivers crit-
ical mail, like medications and finan-
cial documents, but also helps families 
all across the country stay connected 
with each other. 
The Postal Service is the only mail 
carrier that delivers to every commu-
nity across our Nation and serves more 
than 160 million households—no matter 
how remote. 
However, in recent years, we have 
seen how burdensome financial require-
ments drove the Postal Service to use 
cost-cutting 
measures 
that 
com-
promised delivery services. And that is 
why this bipartisan bicameral bill is so 
vital. It will help the Postal Service 
overcome unfair policies that threaten 
its ability to effectively service the 
American people. 
Since introducing this bill, I have 
worked closely with my ranking mem-
ber, ROB PORTMAN, and our 26 other 
Senate cosponsors from both sides of 
the aisle, as well as Chairwoman MALO-
NEY and Ranking Member COMER on 
the House Committee on Oversight and 
Reform, to craft these consensus re-
forms and secure the strong bipartisan 
support we have seen in both the House 
and, hopefully soon, in the Senate. 
I am grateful to each of my col-
leagues for their hard work and for 
their cooperation and their willingness 
to compromise during this process. 
Our legislation, which it has been 15 
years in the making, will eliminate the 
unnecessary requirement for the Postal 
Service to prefund the cost of retiree 
health benefits and will integrate post-
al retirees healthcare with Medicare. 
Together, these reforms will save the 
Postal Service more than $49 billion 
and ensure this essential public serv-
ice, which is dependent on revenues 
from products and service fees to fund 
its operations, is set on a path for long- 
term financial stability. 
This historic legislation will also en-
sure every American knows what is 
going on with the mail in their commu-
nity by requiring the Postal Service to 
post weekly local performance data on-
line. 
It will also ensure this vital institu-
tion continues to deliver mail at least 
6 days a week. By passing the Postal 
Service Reform Act, we can ensure the 
Postal Service is able to provide reli-
able service to families and small busi-
nesses, veterans, seniors, and rural 
communities who rely on this essential 
service each and every day for years to 
come. 
By passing this legislation tonight 
and quickly sending it to President 
Biden’s desk, this body can show the 
Nation that Congress can indeed build 
consensus; we can work on a bipartisan 
basis and get things done for the Amer-
ican people. Together, we can enact 
historic, meaningful change and im-
prove the lives of our constituents. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in sup-
port of this long-overdue bill so that 
we can take a historic and significant 
step to bring the Postal Service into 
the future and ensure it can continue 
providing essential services to the 
American people, as it has done for 
nearly 250 years. 
I yield the floor.

KEY). Under the previous order, all 
postcloture time is expired, amend-
ment No. 4955 is withdrawn, and the

ator from Florida. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
the pending measure, H.R. 3076, Postal 
Service Reform Act of 2022, would in-
crease on-budget deficits by $5 billion 
or more in at least one of the four 10- 
year periods beginning in 2032. 
This increase violates section 3101 of 
the 2016 budget resolution, which pro-
hibits consideration of legislation that 
would cause a net increase in on-budg-
et deficits in any of the four 10-year pe-
riods beyond the current budget win-
dow. 
I raise a point of order under section 
3101(b) of S. Con. Res. 11, the concur-
rent resolution on the budget for fiscal 
year 2016. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, pursu-
ant to section 3101(c) of the fiscal year 
2016 budget resolution, I move to waive 
section 3101 of that resolution for pur-
poses of the pending measure, and I ask 
for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
There will be now 2 minutes of debate 
equally divided prior to a vote on the 
motion to waive. 
The Senator from Florida.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1047 
March 8, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
as I have said repeatedly, I absolutely 
support getting something done to re-
form the Postal Service, but it cannot 
come at the expense to American tax-
payers. 
The Federal debt has already surged 
above $30 trillion, and it just keeps 
growing and growing. 
I wrote to the Congressional Budget 
Office, asking what the future cost of 
this bill would be to Medicare and how 
it would impact the debt. While they 
could tell me there would be at least $5 
billion in new deficits, they couldn’t 
provide data past 2031, when Medicare 
will be most affected by this proposal. 
Here is what we know for certain: 
This bill doesn’t reduce costs; it just 
shifts them from one unfunded govern-
ment program to another. 
This bill adds at least $6 billion in 
new costs to Medicare, with no way to 
pay for it, and adds at least $5 billion 
to long-term Federal deficits. That is 
unacceptable. It is why I am raising a 
point of order today. We have to stop 
driving America deeper into debt and 
finally be accountable to the American 
taxpayers. 
I urge my colleague to vote no on the 
budget point of order. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me 
congratulate Senator PETERS and Sen-
ator PORTMAN for their work. 
This is a bill that has been looked at 
and worked on for a very long time, 
and I am glad that in a few moments 
we are going to pass it. 
I know that the people of Vermont 
and all over this country are increas-
ingly concerned about the long delays 
they are experiencing in getting the 
mail they need. Senior citizens and 
veterans are not getting the prescrip-
tion drugs they need on time. Working 
families have been forced to pay late 
fees because it is taking much longer 
than normal with the Postal Service to 
mail their bills. The Postal Service Re-
form Act is a step forward in address-
ing those concerns, and I am very 
proud to support this bill. 
This is a bill that will save the Post-
al Service billions of dollars a year by 
ending the absurd Bush-era mandate 
forcing the Postal Service to prefund 75 
years of future retiree health benefits 
for employees who haven’t even been 
born yet. It protects 6-day delivery 
service and gives the Postal Service 
the ability to offer new consumer prod-
ucts and services. 
The bottom line is, the Postal Serv-
ice is enormously important to people 
all 
over 
this 
country. 
This 
bill 
strengthens the Postal Service and will 
guarantee that the people of our coun-
try get the quality service they de-
mand.

NOT VOTING—2

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this 
vote, the yeas were 68, and the nays 
were 30. Three-fifths of the Senators 
duly chosen and sworn having voted in 
the affirmative, the motion is agreed 
to. 
The motion was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be 2 minutes of debate equally 
divided prior to a vote on passage of 
the bill. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
in support of the Postal Service bill be-
fore us. It is important reform. People 
know this needs to be done. The vote in 
the House of Representatives was 342 to 
92. It has to be done because the Postal 
Service’s business model just doesn’t 
work—having to deliver more and more 
packages and fewer and fewer more 
profitable first-class mail pieces to 
more and more addresses. So we have 
got to do something to reform it. 
Let me tell you what this bill does do 
and what it doesn’t do—first of all, 
what it does not do. It is not an appro-
priation, so there is no money here 
going into the Postal Service from the 
taxpayer. It does not change the ac-
counting or the cost structure for 
packages and letters. That way, it does 
not disadvantage the private sector 
carriers some were worried about. It 
also does not allow the Postal Service 
to enter into new commercial services 
like 
postal 
banking 
that 
we 
are 
against. Contrary to claims of some of 
the opponents, it actually does not im-
pact the solvency of the trust fund. So 
the Medicare hospital trust fund we all 
worry about, predicted to expire in 
about 2026, this does not affect it at all. 
Postal Service employees are already 
in Part A. And it does not increase the 
Part B or the Part D premiums. 
What this does do is it saves the post 
office, which is incredibly important to 
all of our constituents—to our veterans 
who 
get 
their 
prescription 
drugs 
through the mail, to people who are 
voting by mail, and to people who are 
relying on the Postal Service to pro-
vide them with what they need to be 
able to survive. 
This is an important bill that has 
been worked on for 15 years. I thank 
my colleague Senator PETERS
from 
Michigan for working on a bipartisan 
basis on this. 
Let’s get it done tonight. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, every 
day, the U.S. Postal Service faithfully 
delivers 
for 
the 
American 
people. 
Today, the Senate is finally delivering 
for the post office. 
Today, we can happily say that the 
postal reform is now signed, sealed, and 
delivered for the American people. Be-
cause of today’s bill, the Postal Service 
will be stronger, more efficient, and 
better able to serve more people, and 
we did it on a bipartisan basis. 
For over a decade, the USPS—one of 
the most important institutions in 
American life—has been on an ominous 
trajectory: shrinking revenues, fewer 
delivery routes, and finances in des-
perate need of a revamp. These prob-
lems led to late deliveries, reduced 
hours, and increased costs. And when 
the Postal Service suffers, America 
suffers. 
Today, after much hard work, the 
Senate is providing the Postal Service 
a much needed reset. The legislation 
we are about to pass is the most sig-
nificant step that Congress has taken 
in a long time to strengthen USPS. It 
will guarantee delivery services 6 days 
a week, put the Postal Service on a 
path to solvency, and will ensure that 
we care for our dedicated postal work-
ers, all while saving dollars. 
This postal reform bill is a win-win- 
win: a win for bipartisanship, a win for 
our postal workers, and most impor-
tantly, a win for the tens of millions of 
Americans who rely on the Postal 
Service every single day, from seniors 
to veterans, to small businesses, to 
rural Americans, to everyone in be-
tween. 
I want to really give a special shout- 
out to my colleagues who made this 
possible for us to pass this bill. Sen-
ators PETERS
and PORTMAN
led the 
charge, Senator CARPER worked long in 
the vineyards on this bill, and so many 
others as well. 
Of course, I want to thank the half a 
million postal workers who kept our 
country going every single day, espe-
cially during the pandemic. While so 
many other services were shut down

during COVID, the post office kept de-
livering goods and supplies and medi-
cines across the economy. They are 
public servants of the highest order. 
So it is a great day for our postal 
workers, and it is a great day for the 
American people. 
The bill has been in the works for 
over a decade, and today, after so much 
work, we are all thrilled to have finally 
gotten it done.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I am 
here today for two purposes. I will 
start with the first. 
The first is to rise in support of ad-
vancing the nomination of Elizabeth 
Watson to serve as the Assistant Sec-
retary for Congressional and Intergov-
ernmental Affairs at the Department of 
Labor. 
Ms. Watson is a highly qualified 
nominee who was nominated in April of 
last year, almost a year ago now. She 
has spent most of her career advo-
cating for workers through labor and 
economic policy. 
Ms. Watson previously served as 
labor policy director and chief labor 
counsel on the House Committee on 
Education and Labor. Given her labor 
expertise and commitment to public 
service, she would be an enormous 
asset to the Department of Labor. 
It is past due that the Senate con-
firm her nomination. 
Ms. Watson is one of many excellent 
pro-worker nominees that have been 
put forward by the Biden-Harris admin-
istration. 
Working families and unions built 
the American middle class, and work-
ing families and unions helped to make 
the Nation what it is today—the 
strongest, most powerful nation in the 
world. 
Every worker in America deserves to 
be paid a living wage and treated with

dignity and respect. Over the past few 
decades, corporations have worked to 
undermine and weaken workers’ funda-
mental rights to organize and collec-
tively bargain. We should, for example, 
pass the PRO Act, which would safe-
guard and strengthen workers’ funda-
mental right to organize and ensure 
that workers are able to decide wheth-
er or not to join a union through a fair 
process. 
It would help restore fairness to an 
economy that has been rigged against 
workers for too long. We owe it to 
workers and families to create an econ-
omy that works for them, not for cor-
porate interests. Pro-worker nominees, 
like Elizabeth Watson, will help us re-
alize this goal. The Senate should ad-
vance her nomination. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate consider the following nomina-
tion: Calendar No. 687, Elizabeth Schoff 
Watson, of Maryland, to be an Assist-
ant Secretary of Labor; that the nomi-
nation be confirmed and the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate; that no further motions 
be in order to the nomination; that any 
related statements be printed in the 
RECORD; and that the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Reserving the right to 
object, the Assistant Secretary of 
Labor for Congressional and Intergov-
ernmental Affairs works closely with 
congressional leaders and staff on a va-
riety of issues, including legislative 
proposals, hearings, briefings, requests 
for information, and general topics. It 
is essential that the nominee is willing 
to work with both Democrats and Re-
publicans in a bipartisan fashion. 
Elizabeth Watson is currently the ex-
ecutive director of the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus Center—director of 
the Congressional Progressive Caucus 
Center—hardly a springboard of bipar-
tisanship. 
During the previous administration, 
Ms. Watson retweeted posts such as 
‘‘White supremacists don’t belong in 
the White House,’’ referring to Presi-
dent Trump. 
Her past actions have cast doubt on 
her ability to be impartial and her will-
ingness to work in a bipartisan man-
ner. 
My concerns with this nominee are 
not unique, and there are many other 
Members that have concerns as well. 
There should be a vote on this nomi-
nee. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
STURDY ACT 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise 
this evening to share the urgent need 
to pass a bipartisan bill, a piece of leg-
islation we have been working on for 
years now that will save the lives of 
children. 
Every year, emergency rooms across 
the country treat over 22,000 prevent-
able injuries—22,000 preventable inju-
ries—caused by falling furniture, like 
dressers or television sets. On average, 
roughly half—half—of those injured are 
children, and of the vast majority of 
those killed by furniture tip-overs, 
some 81 percent are children. Eighty- 
one percent of all those killed by fur-
niture tip-overs are children. 
The death of a child is an unspeak-
able loss. There is no way to calculate 
it, and if you haven’t lived through it, 
I don’t think any of us can understand 
what some families have lived through. 
Yet in America, the most powerful Na-
tion on the Earth, in less than 20 years, 
more than 460 children have been killed 
by these furniture tip-overs, and that 
number is the reported fatality num-
ber. 
Compounding the grief and loss that 
these families experience is the fact 
that these deaths might have been pre-
vented. 
The answer here is pretty simple: 
mandatory stability standards that 
would make our homes safer for our 
children. For years now, Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, Senator BLUMENTHAL, Senator 
COTTON, and I have led a bipartisan ef-
fort to pass the STURDY Act. 
Here is what all of the letters in that 
acronym stand for: The Stop Tip-overs 
of Unstable, Risky Dressers on Youth. 
We call it the STURDY Act. 
The STURDY Act would require the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission 
to create a mandatory stability stand-
ard for furniture. That is all it does. It 
would create a mandatory stability 
standard. It would require companies 
to ensure their products are tested for 
safety and stability before being sold. 
It is a simple, commonsense require-
ment that will save the lives of chil-
dren and prevent injuries. 
Families in Pennsylvania and across 
the Nation have been waiting too long 
for the Senate to act. There are fami-
lies like the Lamberts and the Collases 
who have experienced every parent’s 
worst nightmare—the loss of a child. 
These families have given my staff per-
mission for me to share their stories 
tonight on the Senate floor. These are 
two stories I will start with. 
You can see on my left, Katie Lam-
bert. 
Katie Lambert, in 2005, was 3 years 
old, just 3 years old. Her mom Judy de-
scribes her as ‘‘everything a three- 
year-old child should be—full of love 
and spontaneity.’’ 
Katie loved Thomas the Tank En-
gine; she loved Buzz Lightyear; and, of 
course, she loved her older brothers. 
Katie’s family had just moved into 
their new home in Huntingdon Valley, 
PA, in Southeastern Pennsylvania. One 
day, Katie was playing in her room 
while her mom painted the room next- 
door. Suddenly, Judy heard an ‘‘awful 
crash’’ as she described it. Judy ran 
into the room to find 3-year-old Katie 
crushed beneath a tall, mirrored ward-
robe. The wardrobe had been on carpet 
and was unstable. 
Judy said: 
While we don’t know what Katie was 
doing, she was probably dancing and watch-
ing herself in the mirrors. She may have 
bumped up against it or tried to open one of 
the doors or maybe the vibration of her 
dancing in the room was just enough to 
cause it to become unstable and fall forward 
on her. 
That is what her mom Judy said. 
You can see in this photograph a 
beautiful little child, Katie Lambert, 
who died on that day. As her mom 
Judy held her, waiting for an ambu-
lance to arrive, Katie took her last 
breath. She would have been 21 years 
old this year, and Judy wonders what 
she would be like today. What would 
she look like as a young woman? What 
college would she have chosen and 
what career path? Would she like spicy 
food like her brothers do? 
Judy Lambert wanted me to share a 
message today, and it is quoted right 
here on this poster: 
Please, do everything you can to ensure 
that no other family suffers the pain we do. 
So said a mom about what we should 
do when we think of this child. 
Then, Judy went on to say: 
I am begging you to pass the STURDY Act 
now. 
We should listen to her words and 
act. 
The second child I will talk about to-
night is Curren Collas. Another family, 
the Collas family, experienced a simi-
lar tragedy in their home in West Ches-
ter, PA. 
Curren was just 2 years old—2 years 
old—with blond hair and deep blue eyes 
that his mom Jackie described as 
‘‘soulful.’’ Curren loved his cars. He 
would carefully display his collection 
of them in a perfect line. 
In February of 2014, Jackie walked 
into Curren’s bedroom to wake him for 
the day. She discovered Curren’s five- 
drawer dresser had fallen on him. 
Curren was trapped between it and his 
bed. As she waited for an ambulance to 
arrive, Jackie tried to resuscitate 
Curren but was later told by the para-
medics that he had no vital signs when 
they took over. 
In the months after Curren’s death, 
Jackie would sometimes stumble on 
his toy cars, hidden around the house— 
reminders of her spirited son, Curren. 
Obviously, Jackie and her family’s 
lives will never ever be the same. 
Here is what she told us in memory 
of her son. She said: 
Even if I live until 100, it’s going to be be-
fore Curren and after Curren. 
Just two stories tell us all we need to 
know about why we have to pass this 
bill. We could tell a lot more from 
Pennsylvania 
and 
so 
many 
other 
States that are represented by those 
Senators I mentioned and represented 
by Senators from other States. There 
is no reason—no reason at all—for fam-
ilies to endure this unimaginable grief, 
but, tragically, families across the Na-
tion share similar stories of losing chil-
dren to these horrific furniture tipover 
accidents. You will hear more of their

stories from my colleagues in the days 
ahead. 
In the memory of Katie and Curren 
and so many others who were lost to 
their families—killed in these trage-
dies—we must pass the STURDY Act. 
It is not complicated. It is not com-
plicated at all. We must ensure that 
the furniture sold to consumers is test-
ed—tested for safety and tested for sta-
bility. Congress must do all it can. We 
in the Senate must do all we can to en-
sure that no more children—no more 
children—are harmed or killed by fur-
niture tipovers.

Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
South

Madam President, for the last 4 years I 
have worked hard with my friends 
across the aisle on antilynching legis-
lation, legislation that has failed in 
this body 200 times. We passed it in 2019 
under Republican leadership in this 
Senate, only for it to fall apart in the 
House. 
Well, after more than a century of 
failed attempts, both Chambers of Con-
gress have finally passed this historic 
piece of legislation. I am proud to say 
we did the right thing not for Repub-
licans or Democrats, but for Americans 
who have watched their government 
fall short too many times. 
While we cannot erase our Nation’s 
past, today, we have taken a signifi-
cant step toward a better future for all. 
This long overdue piece of legislation 
sends a clear message: We will not tol-
erate hatred and violence against our 
fellow Americans.

∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor a true hero from 
Olathe, KS Officer Erik Clark. His 
brave actions during an active shooter 
situation at Olathe East High School 
helped keep an already tragic situation 
from taking students’ lives. 
On Friday, March 4, a senior student 
at Olathe East was called into the ad-
ministration office after a tip that he 
had brought in a gun to school. A few 
minutes into meeting with the assist-
ant principal, the senior wouldn’t open 
his 
backpack, 
prompting 
Officer 
Clark—the school’s resource officer—to 
step into the situation. Shortly after 
Clark arrived, the student pulled out 
his weapon and began opening fire. 
In a flurry, Clark responded and re-
turned fire, ultimately shooting and 
subduing the student, but not without 
himself and the assistant principal 
being wounded as well. Both, however, 
have thankfully been discharged from 
the hospital. I pray that something 
like that may never happen in those 
halls or any others across America 
again, for even though there were no 
fatal wounds, the scars of trauma ev-
eryone at Olathe East will surely run 
deep. 
Lastly, I want t thank this brave of-
ficer for being so courageous to dive 
headfirst into peril on that day. If it 
were not for Officer Clark, this situa-
tion could have turned out to be a 
much darker day in Olathe. As the son 
of a police chief, I know the risks our 
men and women in blue take on each 
day. I admire Officer Clark for contin-
ually working to ensure our safety. He 
has shown what true valor looks like, 
and Olathe East is safer because of 
him. I ask now that my colleagues 
show this same admiration and rec-
ognition for Officer Clark and that he 
may stay safe protecting his commu-
nity.∑

TRIBUTE TO DR. KALEB STOPPEL 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor a school adminis-
trator that went above and beyond the 
service to his students, Dr. Kaleb 
Stoppel. His brave actions during an 
active shooter situation at Olathe East 
High School helped keep an already 
tragic situation from taking students’ 
lives. 
On Friday, March 4, a senior student 
at Olathe East was called into Dr. 
Stoppel’s office after a tip was sub-
mitted saying the student brought a 
gun to the school. Dr. Stoppel first 
asked the student to open his back-
pack, which he did not comply with, 
prompting the school’s resource officer 
to step into the situation. Shortly 
after the officer arrived, the student 
pulled out his weapon and began open-
ing fire. 
In a flurry, the officer returned fire, 
ultimately shooting and subduing the 
student, but not without himself and 
Dr. Stoppel being wounded as well. 
Both, however, have thankfully been 
discharged from the hospital. I pray 
that something like that may never 
happen in those halls or any others 
across America again, for even though 
there were no fatal wounds, the scars 
of trauma for everyone at Olathe East 
will surely run deep. 
Lastly, I want to thank Dr. Stoppel 
for being so responsive to the situation 
and keeping students out of harm’s 
way. Had he not investigated the tip, 
this tragedy surely would have been 
much graver. Olathe East is safer be-
cause of him. I ask now that my col-
leagues show this same admiration and 
recognition for Dr. Stoppel and that he 
may stay safe while educating our fu-
ture leaders.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1051 
March 8, 2022 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 
301 of title 3, United States Code, I re-
port that I have issued an Executive 
Order finding that the Russian Federa-
tion’s 
unjustified, 
unprovoked, 
unyielding, and unconscionable war 
against Ukraine, including its recent 
further invasion in violation of inter-
national law, including the United Na-
tions Charter, further threatens the 
peace, stability, sovereignty, and terri-
torial integrity of Ukraine, and there-
by constitutes an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
As a result, I have prohibited the fol-
lowing: (i) the importation into the 
United States of the following products 
of Russian Federation origin: crude oil; 
petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and 
products of their distillation; liquefied 
natural gas; coal; and coal products; 
(ii) new investment in the energy sec-
tor in the Russian Federation by a 
United States person, wherever lo-
cated; and (iii) any approval, financing, 
facilitation, or guarantee by a United 
States person, wherever located, of a 
transaction by a foreign person where 
the transaction by that foreign person 
would be prohibited by this section if 
performed by a United States person or 
within the United States. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Ms. SMITH, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr. 
MARKEY, and Mr. DURBIN): 
S. 3774. A bill to address the dis-
parate impact of climate change on 
women and support the efforts of 
women globally to address climate 
change, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Women and Cli-
mate Change Act of 2022. This bill af-
firms the U.S. commitment to sup-
porting a group of people who are most 
often negatively impacted by climate 
change, yet too often left out of deci-
sionmaking and policy development— 
women. The bill creates a Federal 
interagency working group, established 
by the Department of State, that will 
collect data and develop policies and 
strategies to address the effects of cli-
mate change on women both at home 
and abroad. Communities all across the 
United States and the world are cur-
rently feeling the impacts of climate 
change. The time to empower women 
to respond to this crisis is now. As we 
commemorate International Women’s 
Day today, we are reminded of the im-
portant roles that women play in com-
munities across the world and seize 
this opportunity to reaffirm our com-
mitment to working towards equity. 
The United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change, UNFCC, 
highlights that the majority of the 
world’s poor is made up of women who 
rely on natural resources in their daily 
lives and are least likely to be able to 
respond to extreme weather events. 
These women disproportionately face 
the brunt of climate change impacts, 
yet too often have little power or say 
over how they, their families, and their 
communities are able to combat cli-
mate change. UNFCC notes that when 
women are allowed a role in developing 
strategies that address climate change, 
it often results in great responsiveness 
to local needs, enabling resilience and 
capacity building, and delivering peace 
across communities. 
The rising costs of climate change to 
communities at home and abroad, both 
in terms of fatalities and expenses, are 
sobering. According to the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion, NOAA, last year the United 
States alone experienced 20 weather 
and climate disasters that cost at least 
$1 billion each, netting a $145 billion 
price tag and resulting in 688 deaths. 
Data from NOAA indicates a trend of 
increasing billion-dollar disasters each 
decade since the 1980s, with the expec-
tation that the trend will continue. 
According to Christian Aid, a relief 
agency in the United Kingdom working 
to address poverty, the 10 worst global 
climate disasters in 2021 cost $170 bil-
lion. These included Hurricane Ida, 
which impacted the east coast of the 
United States and resulted in at least 
95 deaths, flooding in Europe that 
caused 240 fatalities, and July floods in 
China that killed over 300 individuals. 
The latest report issued by the Inter-
governmental 
Panel 
on 
Climate 
Change, IPCC, last month highlights 
the consequences that the world will 
face if countries do not take immediate 
and significant action to address cli-
mate change. These consequences in-
clude extreme heat, floods, wildfire, 
drought, and famine that could result 
in malnutrition and displacement of 
people across the globe. The report also 
noted that between 2010 and 2020, ex-
treme weather events fueled by climate 
change killed 15 times the number of 
people in poor countries as in wealthier 
nations. The report underscores how 
women will continue to face mounting 
challenges as the world experiences 
more severe and costly climate-fueled 
disasters. Women play a critical role in 
combating climate change—both with-
in their communities and on a global 
scale. By including them at all levels, 
from planning to implementation, and 
providing them with the platform and 
support to carry out these strategies, 
we have the opportunity to create fair, 
effective, and sustainable solutions to 
respond to the climate crisis. 
This bill is a companion to H.R. 260, 
which was introduced by my colleague 
Representative BARBARA LEE early last 
year. I thank her for her leadership on 
this bill and look forward to con-
tinuing our work to see that women all 
across the world are empowered to help 
confront this global crisis. 
Groups in support of this bill include 
Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood, the 
Women’s Environment and Develop-
ment Organization, Madre, Outdoor 
Afro, California Environmental Voters, 
Oxfam America, League of Conserva-
tion Voters, and Schools for Climate 
Action.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1062 
March 8, 2022 
S. 3788. A bill to address the home-
lessness and housing crises, to move to-
ward the goal of providing for a home 
for all Americans, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Housing Act 
for All Act of 2022, which I introduced 
today. 
The homelessness and housing crises 
have worsened in recent years. As of 
January 2020, more than 580,000 individ-
uals in the country, disproportionately 
people of color, were experiencing 
homelessness. 
Rates 
of 
unsheltered 
homelessness have increased over the 
last few years, and people experiencing 
unsheltered homelessness have a mor-
tality rate four to nine times higher 
than that of the general public. A lack 
of affordable housing and housing as-
sistance programs have contributed to 
homelessness. There is a shortage of 6.8 
million affordable rental homes in the 
United States. Even before the pan-
demic, one in four renters spent half of 
their monthly income on rent, and 
nearly a million tenants were evicted 
each year. I believe every person has a 
right to housing. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill, which represents a com-
prehensive approach to tackling hous-
ing and homelessness. If enacted, it 
would invest in and align Federal re-
sources to support those experiencing 
housing instability. To address the 
homelessness and housing crises, we 
must invest in policies that support 
strong, sustainable, inclusive commu-
nities and ensure quality affordable 
homes for all. 
Specifically, this bill will address the 
affordable housing shortage by invest-
ing in the housing trust fund, the Sec-
tion 202 Supportive Housing for the El-
derly Program, Section 811 Supportive 
Housing for Persons with Disabilities 
Program, and the HOME Program. It 
establishes a Commission to focus on 
racial equity in housing and homeless-
ness. 
It will address homelessness by in-
vesting in housing choice vouchers 
project-based rental assistance, emer-
gency solutions grants, and contin-
uums of care. It will create grant pro-
grams to strengthen mobile crisis 
intervention teams; to support hotel 
and motel conversions to permanent 
supportive housing with services; to 
aid libraries in supporting persons ex-
periencing homelessness; and to pro-
vide people living in vehicles with a 
safe place to park overnight and facili-
tate a transition to stable housing. 
And it commissions a report on the 
connection 
between 
evictions 
and 
emergency rental assistance during the 
pandemic, so we can make smarter pol-
icy moving forward. 
When I have traveled around the 
State—from LA County to Inland Em-
pire, to Fresno, to San Diego, to San 
Francisco—to get a sense of the needs 
for housing in different communities, 
some key elements stood out. On the 
production side, there is a need for 
more dedicated funding for affordable 
housing from the Federal Government. 
There is also missing middle housing 
for families, especially people of color. 
And there is not enough housing near 
transit. That is why my bill focuses on 
supporting inclusive, transit-oriented 
development. When I talked to re-
searchers 
about 
keeping 
families 
housed, one main point they made is 
that we don’t have enough data on 
renters and evictions, and that is why 
I wanted to include a section of the bill 
on data—so we can make evidence- 
based policies. Right now, the cost to 
build low-income housing in California 
is very high because of land and mate-
rial costs as well as the fragmented 
way that funding gets doled out in 
California. That is why I included a 
section to provide technical assistance 
for localities navigating Federal and 
State housing funding sources. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has under-
scored the need for affordable, safe, and 
supportive housing for people experi-
encing homelessness. Because of the 
pandemic, many lost their housing, 
while others struggled to make rent for 
the first time. Some didn’t know where 
to turn as shelters faced capacity lim-
its and food banks saw overwhelming 
demand. These hardships were espe-
cially prevalent for those who had al-
ready 
been 
marginalized—including 
communities of color, low-income com-
munities, and those with disabilities. 
As we begin to recover from the pan-
demic, it is our job to rebuild a more 
inclusive and equitable world for all. A 
just recovery includes expanding af-
fordable housing options to provide 
people with a sense of stability. It also 
means respecting the dignity and sup-
porting the health of all community 
members. Affordable housing is essen-
tial infrastructure. Every person de-
serves dignity, security, and space of 
their own. 
I want to thank Representatives LIEU 
and CARBAJAL for introducing this bill 
with me, and I hope our colleagues will 
join us in support of this solution to 
our housing and homelessness crises.

Mr. RISCH (for himself and Mr. DUR-
BIN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 538 
Whereas meaningful and consistent high- 
level multilateral engagement between the 
United States and Africa is necessary for the 
foreign policy of the United States to keep 
pace with the rapid transformation and de-
mographic shifts in Africa and to ensure that 
the United States understands and responds 
to the dynamism and ambitions of its Afri-
can partners; 
Whereas successive United States’ Presi-
dential administrations and Congress have 
identified strategic competition with the 
People’s Republic of China, the Russian Fed-
eration, and other malign actors as a threat 
to the national security priorities of the 
United States that requires building and 
maintaining networks of bilateral and multi-
lateral partners and allies, including coun-
tries in Africa; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China, 
the European Union, India, Japan, the Rus-
sian Federation, and Turkey, among others, 
have held high-level summits with African 
leaders to discuss policy priorities and deep-
en economic, political, and security partner-
ships; 
Whereas, during August 4 through 6, 2014, 
President Barack Obama hosted the first and 
only United States-Africa Leaders Summit 
(referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘2014 
Summit’’) in Washington, D.C., with African 
leaders representing 50 countries, the Afri-
can Union Commission, and various private 
sector and civil society leaders under the 
theme ‘‘Investing in the Next Generation’’; 
Whereas the 2014 Summit provided a forum 
for African leaders to engage in frank ex-
changes with the Government of the United 
States and congressional leaders, business 
executives, and members of civil society re-
garding— 
(1) development and economic challenges; 
(2) trade, investment, and economic co-
operation; 
(3) democracy, human rights, and govern-
ance; and 
(4) peace and regional security; 
Whereas, on February 5, 2021, at the 34th 
Ordinary Session of the African Union As-
sembly, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., out-
lined the vision of his administration for a 
United 
States-Africa 
partnership 
to 
strengthen relationships and build on mu-
tual interests and respect with the govern-
ments, people (including people of the Afri-
can Diaspora), and regional multilateral in-
stitutions of Africa; 
Whereas, on November 19, 2021, during a 
speech to the Economic Community of West 
African States in Abuja, Nigeria, Secretary 
of State Antony Blinken announced that the 
United States would host a second United 
States-Africa Leaders Summit ‘‘to drive the 
kind of high-level diplomacy and engage-
ment that can transform relationships and 
make effective cooperation possible’’; and 
Whereas a well-organized and resourced 
second United States-Africa Leaders Sum-
mit, with an established mechanism for con-
tinuity and follow-up, will create a platform 
upon which the United States and African 
partners can better structure United States- 
Africa relationships, deliver on commit-

partners on areas of mutual interest: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the administration of Presi-

United States-Africa Leaders Summit (re-
ferred to in this resolution as the ‘‘Summit’’) 
as a vital opportunity to strengthen ties be-
tween the United States and African part-

(2) underscores the importance of bipar-
tisan, bicameral congressional participation

(4) urges the Biden administration— 
(A) to conduct adequate and diverse con-
sultation with African leaders, the African 
Diaspora, educational institutions, private 
sector and civil society organizations of the 
United States and Africa, and public policy 
institutions in planning the Summit; 
(B) to consider hosting the Summit in a lo-
cation outside of Washington, D.C., that 
will— 
(i) draw broad participation from State

than governments, is the primary driver of 
the commercial relationship between the 
United States and African countries;

leaders to other cities in the United States 
and inviting like-minded partners from Eu-

and other similar initiatives; 
(E) to include a theme for the Summit that 
focuses on shared democracy, governance,

(F) to create opportunities during the 
Summit for direct congressional engagement 
and to ensure the participation of multiple

540—SUP-
PORTING THE GOALS OF INTER-
NATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 
Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. COL-
LINS, 
Ms. 
BALDWIN, 
and 
Ms. 
DUCKWORTH) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 540 
Whereas, as of March 2022, there are ap-
proximately 3,803,000,000 women and girls in 
the world, making up 1⁄2 of the world’s popu-
lation; 
Whereas women and girls around the 
world— 
(1) have fundamental human rights; 
(2) play a critical role in providing and car-
ing for their families and driving positive 
change in their communities; 
(3) contribute substantially to food secu-
rity, economic growth, the prevention and 
resolution of conflict, and the sustainability 
of peace and stability; 
(4) are affected in different and often dis-
proportionate ways by global, country, and 
community circumstances, including eco-
nomic downturns, global health concerns, 
conflict, migration, and climate events; and 
(5) must have meaningful protections and 
opportunities to more fully participate in 
and lead the political, social, and economic 
lives of their communities and countries; 
Whereas the advancement and empower-
ment of women and girls around the world is 
a foreign policy priority for the United 
States and is critical to the achievement of 
global peace, prosperity, and sustainability; 
Whereas, on October 6, 2017, the Women, 
Peace, and Security Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 
2152j et seq.) was enacted into law, which in-
cludes requirements for a government-wide 
‘‘Women, Peace, and Security Strategy’’ to 
promote and strengthen the participation of 
women in peace negotiations and conflict 
prevention overseas, enhanced training for 
relevant United States Government per-
sonnel, and follow-up evaluations of the ef-
fectiveness of the strategy; 
Whereas the United States Strategy on 
Women, Peace, and Security, dated June 
2019, recognizes that— 
(1) 
the 
‘‘[s]ocial 
and 
political 
marginalization of women strongly cor-
relates with the likelihood that a country 
will experience conflict’’; 
(2) there is a ‘‘tremendous amount of un-
tapped potential among the world’s women 
and girls to identify, recommend, and imple-
ment effective solutions to conflict’’, and 
there are ‘‘benefits derived from creating op-
portunities for women and girls to serve as 
agents of peace via political, economic, and 
social empowerment’’; and 
(3) barriers to the meaningful participation 
of women and girls in conflict prevention 
and resolution efforts ‘‘include under-rep-
resentation in political leadership, pervasive 
violence against women and girls, and per-
sistent inequality in many societies’’; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Entity for Gender Equality and the Em-
powerment of Women (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘UN Women’’), peace negotiations are 
more likely to end in a peace agreement 
when women and women’s groups play a 
meaningful role in the negotiation process; 
Whereas, according to a study by the Inter-
national Peace Institute, a peace agreement 
is 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 
years if women participate in the develop-
ment of the peace agreement; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of Inter-
national Narcotics and Law Enforcement Af-
fairs of the Department of State, the full and 
meaningful participation of women in crimi-
nal justice professions and security forces 
vastly enhances the effectiveness of the re-
sulting workforces; 
Whereas, 
despite 
the 
contributions 
of 
women to society, hundreds of millions of 
women and girls around the world continue 
to be denied the right to participate freely in 
civic and economic life, lack fundamental 
legal protections, and remain vulnerable to 
exploitation and abuse; 
Whereas, 
every 
year, 
approximately 
12,000,000 girls are married before they reach 
the age of 18, which means that— 
(1) nearly 33,000 girls are married every 
day; or 
(2) nearly 23 girls are married every 
minute; 
Whereas, despite global progress, it is pre-
dicted that by 2030 more than 150,000,000 
more girls will marry before reaching the 
age of 18, and approximately 2,400,000 girls 
who are married before reaching the age of 18 
are under the age of 15; 
Whereas girls living in countries affected 
by conflict or other humanitarian crises are 
often the most vulnerable to child marriage, 
and 9 of the 10 countries with the highest 
rates of child marriage are considered fragile 
or extremely fragile; 
Whereas, on August 15, 2022, the Taliban 
entered Kabul, Afghanistan, and toppled the 
elected government of the Islamic Republic 
of Afghanistan, resulting in de facto Taliban 
rule over the people of Afghanistan; 
Whereas the Taliban has prohibited girls 
and young women from receiving secondary 
education and has restricted access to pri-
mary and university education; 
Whereas, according to the United Nation’s 
Children’s Fund (commonly referred to as 
‘‘UNICEF’’)— 
(1) approximately 1⁄4 of girls between the 
ages of 15 and 19 have been victims of some 
form of physical violence; 
(2) approximately 120,000,000 girls world-
wide, slightly more than 1 in 10, have experi-
enced forced sexual acts; and 
(3) an estimated 1 in 3 women around the 
world has experienced some form of physical 
or sexual violence; 
Whereas the overall level of violence 
against women is a better predictor of the 
peacefulness of a country, the compliance of 
a country with international treaty obliga-
tions, and the relations of a country with 
neighboring countries than indicators meas-
uring the level of democracy, level of wealth, 
or level of institutionalization of the coun-
try; 
Whereas, despite the achievements of indi-
vidual female leaders and evidence that de-
mocracy and equality under the law form a 
mutually reinforcing relationship in which

higher levels of equality are strongly cor-
related with the relative state of peace of a 
country, a healthier domestic security envi-
ronment, and lower levels of aggression to-
ward other countries— 
(1) women around the world remain vastly 
underrepresented in— 
(A) national and local legislatures and 
governments; and 
(B) other high-level positions; and 
(2) according to the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union, women account for only 25.6 percent 
of national parliamentarians and 21 percent 
of government ministers; 
Whereas the ability of women and girls to 
realize their full potential is critical to the 
ability of a country to achieve strong and 
lasting economic growth, self-reliance, and 
political and social stability; 
Whereas, although the United Nations Mil-
lennium Project reached the goal of achiev-
ing gender parity in primary education in 
most countries in 2015, the COVID–19 global 
pandemic has set back gender equality in 
education and more work remains to be done 
to achieve gender equality in primary and 
secondary education, and particularly in sec-
ondary education worldwide as gender gaps 
persist and widen, by addressing— 
(1) discriminatory practices; 
(2) harmful cultural and social norms; 
(3) inadequate sanitation facilities, includ-
ing facilities to manage menstruation; 
(4) child, early, and forced marriage; 
(5) poverty; 
(6) early pregnancy and motherhood; 
(7) conflict and insecurity; and 
(8) other factors that favor boys or devalue 
girls’ education; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organi-
zation— 
(1) approximately 132,000,000 girls between 
the ages of 6 and 17 remain out of school; 
(2) girls living in countries affected by con-
flict are 2.5 times more likely to be out of 
primary school than boys; 
(3) girls are twice as likely as boys to never 
set foot in a classroom; and 
(4) up to 30 percent of girls who drop out of 
school do so because of adolescent pregnancy 
or child marriage; 
Whereas women around the world face a 
variety of constraints that severely limit 
their economic participation and produc-
tivity and remain underrepresented in the 
labor force; 
Whereas the economic empowerment of 
women is inextricably linked to a myriad of 
other human rights that are essential to the 
ability of women to thrive as economic ac-
tors, including— 
(1) living lives free of violence and exploi-
tation; 
(2) achieving the highest possible standard 
of health and well-being; 
(3) enjoying full legal and human rights, 
such as access to registration, identification, 
and citizenship documents, and freedom of 
movement; 
(4) access to formal and informal edu-
cation; 
(5) access to, and equal protection under, 
land and property rights; 
(6) access to fundamental labor rights; 
(7) the implementation of policies to ad-
dress disproportionate care burdens; and 
(8) receiving business and management 
skills and leadership opportunities; 
Whereas, pursuant to section 3(b) of the 
Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic 
Empowerment Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 2151– 
2(b)), it is the international development co-
operation policy of the United States— 
(1) to reduce gender disparities with re-
spect to economic, social, political, edu-
cational, and cultural resources, as well as 
wealth, opportunities, and services; 
(2) to strive to eliminate gender-based vio-
lence and mitigate its harmful effects on in-
dividuals 
and 
communities, 
including 
through efforts to develop standards and ca-
pacity to reduce gender-based violence in the 
workplace and other places where women 
work; 
(3) to support activities that secure private 
property rights and land tenure for women in 
developing countries, including— 
(A) supporting legal frameworks that 
give women equal rights to own, register, 
use, profit from, and inherit land and prop-
erty; 
(B) improving legal literacy to enable 
women to exercise the rights described in 
subparagraph (A); and 
(C) improving the capacity of law en-
forcement and community leaders to en-
force such rights; 
(4) to increase the capability of women and 
girls to fully exercise their rights, determine 
their life outcomes, assume leadership roles, 
and influence decision making in households, 
communities, and societies; and 
(5) to improve the access of women and 
girls to education, particularly higher edu-
cation opportunities in business, finance, 
and management, in order to enhance finan-
cial literacy and business development, man-
agement, and strategy skills; 
Whereas the Millennium Challenge Cor-
poration (commonly referred to as the 
‘‘MCC’’), an independent United States for-
eign assistance agency, recognizes that in-
equality and the exclusion of women from 
economic opportunities can inhibit efforts to 
promote economic growth and reduce pov-
erty and decrease a country’s economic 
growth trajectory, which is why the gender 
policy of the MCC requires gender inequal-
ities to be identified and considered in every 
stage of agreements with participating coun-
tries; 
Whereas, according to the World Health 
Organization, global maternal mortality de-
creased by approximately 44 percent between 
1990 and 2015, yet approximately 830 women 
and girls continue to die from preventable 
causes relating to pregnancy or childbirth 
each day, and 99 percent of all maternal 
deaths occur in developing countries; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations, 
of the 830 women and adolescent girls who 
die every day from preventable causes relat-
ing to pregnancy and childbirth, 507 die each 
day in countries that are considered fragile 
because of conflict or disaster, accounting 
for approximately 3⁄5 of all maternal deaths 
worldwide; 
Whereas the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees reports that 
women and girls comprise approximately 1⁄2 
of the 67,200,000 refugees and internally dis-
placed or stateless individuals in the world; 
Whereas the initial days of the Russian in-
vasion of Ukraine that began on February 24, 
2022, have resulted in a disproportionate 
number of women and children seeking safe-
ty outside of Ukraine; 
Whereas those women and girls, like 
women and girls in all humanitarian emer-
gencies, including those subject to forced 
displacement, face increased and exacerbated 
vulnerabilities to— 
(1) gender-based violence, including rape, 
child marriage, domestic violence, human 
trafficking, and sexual exploitation and as-
sault; 
(2) disruptions in education and livelihood; 
(3) lack of access to health services; and 
(4) food insecurity and malnutrition; 
Whereas malnutrition poses a variety of 
threats to women and girls specifically, as 
malnutrition can weaken their immune sys-
tems, making them more susceptible to in-
fections, and affects their capacity to sur-
vive childbirth, and children born of mal-
nourished women and girls are more likely 
to have cognitive impairments and higher 
risk of disease throughout their lives; 
Whereas it is imperative— 
(1) to alleviate violence and discrimination 
against women and girls; and 
(2) to afford women and girls every oppor-
tunity to be equal members of their commu-
nities; and 
Whereas March 8, 2022, is recognized as 
International Women’s Day, a global day— 
(1) to celebrate the economic, political, 
and social achievements of women in the 
past, present, and future; and 
(2) to recognize the obstacles that women 
face in the struggle for equal rights and op-
portunities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of International 
Women’s Day; 
(2) recognizes that the fundamental human 
rights of women and girls have intrinsic 
value that affect the quality of life of women 
and girls; 
(3) recognizes that the empowerment of 
women and girls is inextricably linked to the 
potential of a country to generate— 
(A) economic growth and self-reliance; 
(B) sustainable peace and democracy; and 
(C) inclusive security; 
(4) recognizes and honors individuals in the 
United States and around the world, includ-
ing women human rights defenders, activ-
ists, and civil society leaders, who have 
worked throughout history to ensure that 
women and girls are guaranteed equality and 
fundamental human rights; 
(5) recognizes the unique cultural, histor-
ical, and religious differences throughout the 
world and urges the United States Govern-
ment to act with respect and understanding 
toward legitimate differences when pro-
moting any policies; 
(6) reaffirms the commitment— 
(A) to end discrimination and violence 
against women and girls; 
(B) to ensure the safety, health, and wel-
fare of women and girls; 
(C) to pursue policies that guarantee the 
fundamental human rights of women and 
girls worldwide; and 
(D) to promote meaningful and significant 
participation of women in every aspect of so-
ciety and community, including conflict pre-
vention, 
protection, 
peacemaking, 
and 
peacebuilding; 
(7) supports sustainable, measurable, and 
global development that seeks to achieve 
gender equality and the empowerment of 
women and girls; and 
(8) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe International Women’s 
Day with appropriate programs and activi-
ties.

his abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida, by 
a white supremacist, antiabortion extremist, 
in the first known instance of murder of an 
abortion provider on March 10, 1993; 
Whereas abortion providers and clinic staff 
play a critical role in a world where people 
must be able to make essential and time-sen-
sitive decisions about their bodies, lives, and 
futures; 
Whereas abortion providers and clinic staff 
help to ensure that all people who can be-
come pregnant can make their own decisions 
about their bodies and their pregnancies, and 
support their patients’ decisions by treating 
them with dignity, empathy, compassion, 
and respect; 
Whereas abortion providers and clinic staff 
play an essential role within the reproduc-
tive justice framework, which was created by 
a group of Black women in 1994, who deter-
mined the necessity of adopting a human 
rights framework that demands every person 
has the human right to bodily autonomy, 
which includes if, when, and how to have 
children, to not have children, and to parent 
the children they have in safe and sustain-
able communities; 
Whereas people seeking abortion care 
across the United States also rely on the 
work of abortion funds and practical support 
organizations to access abortion care for 
themselves and their families; 
Whereas abortion funds and practical sup-
port organizations that rely on donations 
face increasing demand as people are forced 
into the vicious cycle of having to travel 
longer distances, find childcare or lodging, 
and raise money to obtain an abortion and 
cover associated costs; 
Whereas restrictions on accessing abortion 
care have far-reaching consequences in both 
deepening existing inequities caused by 
structural racism and systemic discrimina-
tion in the maternal health care system and 
worsening health outcomes for pregnant peo-
ple, people giving birth, and their families; 
Whereas abortion care restrictions in some 
States have forced many abortion clinics to 
shut down, such that 90 percent of counties 
in the United States today do not have an 
abortion provider, the number of inde-
pendent abortion clinics in the United States 
has declined by 1⁄3 since 2012, and efforts to 
undermine critical supports for patients, in-
cluding family planning supports, have fur-
ther threatened the work of abortion pro-
viders; 
Whereas restricting access to abortion care 
creates and increases the out-of-pocket costs 
and logistical burdens that patients face to 
get care while exposing the remaining abor-
tion providers and staff to increased levels of 
harassment and politically motivated re-
strictions; 
Whereas the National Abortion Federa-
tion’s 2020 statistics on violence and disrup-
tion found an alarming escalation in inci-
dents of obstruction, vandalism, and tres-
passing at abortion clinics, with abortion 
providers reporting an increase in death 
threats and threats of harm from 92 inci-
dents in 2019 to 200 in 2020; 
Whereas Black, indigenous, and other pro-
viders and patients of color face heightened 
levels of threats, harassment, and violence 
as compared to their white counterparts; 
Whereas 2021 marked the worst year for 
abortion rights since Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 
113 (1973), was decided, and the passage and 
enforcement of restrictions on abortion ac-
cess and the criminalization of abortion has 
emboldened antiabortion individuals and 
groups to continue to harass providers and 
the patients they care for; 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States is now (as of the date of adoption of 
this resolution) considering Dobbs v. Jack-
son Women’s Health Organization, 141 S.Ct. 
2619 (2021), a case that the justices could use 
to overturn or severely undermine Roe v. 
Wade, and at the same time has refused to 
block Texas’s blatantly unconstitutional ban 
on abortion at approximately 6 weeks of 
pregnancy, allowing Texas to ban the major-
ity of abortions in the State; 
Whereas the ripple effects of Texas’s abor-
tion ban have been felt by communities and 
abortion providers across the country as 
abortion clinics try to absorb the massive in-
flux of Texas’s patients who have the re-
sources to travel and are seeking abortion 
care elsewhere; 
Whereas, should the Supreme Court over-
turn or severely undermine Roe v. Wade, 
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Geor-
gia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Lou-
isiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Mon-
tana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Okla-
homa, South Carolina, South Dakota, Ten-
nessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wis-
consin, and Wyoming could act as soon as 
possible to prohibit abortion and criminalize 
abortion providers; 
Whereas Roe v. Wade alone has never been 
sufficient to ensure that all people, espe-
cially Black people, indigenous people, peo-
ple of color, working class and low-income 
people, LGBTQIA+ people, people who are 
immigrants, younger people, people with dis-
abilities, geographically isolated people, and 
people with multimarginal identities, can 
get the abortion care they need; 
Whereas the unraveling or overturning of 
Roe v. Wade threatens the ability of abortion 
providers and the clinic staff who support 
them to serve their patients; and 
Whereas in the face of multifaceted at-
tacks on their work, abortion providers re-
main an essential and valued part of their 
communities, providing high-quality, com-
passionate, and necessary health care, and 
courageously delivering this care despite 
pressures, 
restrictions, 
political 
inter-
ference, and violent threats to their personal 
safety: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) recognizes March 10, 2022, as ‘‘Abortion 
Provider Appreciation Day’’ to celebrate the 
courage, compassion, and high-quality care 
that abortion providers and clinic staff offer 
to patients and their families across the 
country; 
(2) lauds communities across the country 
who are proud to be home to abortion pro-
viders and clinic staff; 
(3) affirms Congress’s commitment to en-
suring the safety of abortion providers, their 
ability to continue providing the essential 
care their patients need, and the right of 
their patients to access abortion care no 
matter where they live, free from fear of vio-
lence, criminalization, or stigma; and 
(4) declares a vision for a future where ac-
cess to abortion is liberated from restric-
tions and bans universally, and affirms 
Congress’s commitment to working toward 
this goal in partnership with providers, pa-
tients, advocates, and their communities.

SOUTH FLORIDA CLEAN COASTAL 
WATERS ACT OF 2021 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 203, S. 66. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 66) to require the Inter-Agency 
Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and 
Hypoxia to develop a plan for reducing, miti-
gating, and controlling harmful algal blooms 
and hypoxia in South Florida, and for other 
purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am proud to be a champion of the 
Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Re-
search 
and 
Control 
Act—or 
HABHRCA—program. The program was 
first created in 1998 to help address 
harmful algal blooms in water bodies 
across the country. Congress recog-
nized the devastating impact of harm-
ful algal blooms, both ecologically and 
economically, and the importance of 
providing resources to the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion (NOAA) to advance scientific un-
derstanding of harmful algal blooms, as 
well as the ability to detect, monitor, 
assess, and predict bloom events. 
In 2014 and again in 2018, I worked 
with then-Senator Bill Nelson to reau-
thorize the program in a bipartisan 
way. And in the 2014 legislation, I 
worked to ensure that freshwater bod-
ies, specifically the Great Lakes, were 
a focus for the program for the first 
time. Since then, I have worked to se-
cure funding for the HABHRCA pro-
gram through the annual appropria-
tions process. 
I am pleased to report that, today, 
NOAA’s work through the HABHRCA 
program is being used by my constitu-
ents and others across the Great Lakes 
basin. For example, I hear from the 
fishing and charter boat industries 
that they rely on NOAA’s biweekly 
forecasts to monitor the location of the 
blooms so they know what areas of the 
lake to avoid in order to continue oper-
ating their tourism and fishing busi-
nesses. 
It also helps our drinking water sys-
tems prevent contamination in drink-
ing water because they are able to an-
ticipate additional treatment needs if 
the location of the bloom is near a 
water intake valve. This will help pre-
vent crises similar to the 2014 water 
crisis in Toledo, OH, in which nearly 
half a million people lost access to safe 
drinking water because a harmful algal 
bloom contaminated the city’s water 
supply. 
As cochair of the Senate Great Lakes 
Task Force, I am committed to ensur-
ing our Great Lakes communities have 
the resources they need to create jobs 
and protect the water quality and 
health of the lakes. 
My colleague from Florida, Senator 
Rubio, has a bill that would amend the 
HABHRCA program to require NOAA 
to conduct harmful algal bloom and 
hypoxia work specifically for the South 
Florida ecosystem. I am supportive of 
this legislation and of efforts to ad-
dress harmful algal blooms across the 
country, so long as it does not take 
away or divert resources that are used 
in the Great Lakes. 
To that end, I ask for unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
a letter from NOAA Administrator 
Spinrad committing that the work 
done in South Florida, such as would 
be the case with passage of Senator 
RUBIO’s legislation, S. 66, the South 
Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act, 
would have no impact on the resources 
and work currently being conducted to 
support the Great Lakes. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
MARCH 3, 2022. 
Hon. ROBERT PORTMAN, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Se-
curity and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Sen-
ate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR PORTMAN: Thank you for 
your letter regarding the importance of 
maintaining harmful algal bloom (HAB) and 
hypoxia research and monitoring activities 
in the Great Lakes region. I appreciate the 
discussion that you and I had about this 
issue last week. 
As you know, NOAA has monitored and 
forecast cyanobacteria bloom location and 
concentration in Lake Erie since 2009. The 
early seasonal ‘‘rolling’’ outlook beginning 
in May estimates bloom severity based on 
measurements of phosphorous loading from 
the Maumee River combined with long-range 
forecasts and historical records. The Lake 
Erie HAB Seasonal Forecast issued in early 
summer allows coastal managers, lake users, 
and drinking water facility operators to 
make informed decisions based on the poten-
tial severity of the bloom. In addition, the 
Lake Erie HAB forecast issued twice a week 
during bloom season (July–October) provides 
the current bloom extent and 5-day outlooks 
of where the bloom will travel and what con-
centrations are likely to be seen, allowing 
managers to determine whether to take pre-
ventive actions. 
As we discussed, NOAA is committed to 
continuing this important work and to pur-
suing improvements to Lake Erie HAB de-
tection, monitoring, and forecasting to keep 
communities in the Great Lakes region safe. 
Additional proposals to complete HABs work 
in the South Florida ecosystem will not im-
pact the resources necessary for Great Lakes 
HABs work through the Harmful Algal 
Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control 
Act of 1998. The President’s Fiscal Year 2022 
Budget Request includes an increase for 
NOAA’s Coastal Science and Assessment pro-
grams that, if appropriated, will support 
these efforts and build capacity in other 
areas. 
We appreciate your interest and look for-
ward to our continued partnership. If you 
have 
further 
questions, 
please 
contact 
Makeda Okolo, Director of NOAA’s Office of 
Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Sincerely, 
DR. RICHARD W. SPINRAD, 
Under 
Secretary 
of 
Commerce 
for 
Oceans and Atmos-
phere 
and 
NOAA 
Administrator. 
Mr. CASEY. I further ask that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 66) was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed, as follows: 
S. 66 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
SAMUEL DUVALL 
HON. MARK DESAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today along with Speaker NANCY PELOSI to 
recognize the life of Robert Samuel ‘‘Sam’’ 
DuVall, 
legendary 
San 
Francisco 
restauranteur. 
Born in Mississippi, Sam graduated from the 
University of Mississippi in 1962. During his 
time in college, Sam hosted dinner parties for 
his friends, introducing them to different kinds 
of food and unknowingly honing the hospitality 
that would foster his future career. Following 
graduation, Sam moved to San Francisco in 
1964, which he ultimately made his home. 
While passing an empty storefront one day in 
1967, Sam decided to open a restaurant, 
Front Room Pizza. He conducted research by 
eating pizza throughout San Francisco and 
hiring the best pizza chef he could find. With 
the opening of Front Room Pizza, Sam started 
a more than 50–year career as a restaurateur, 
during which he opened 30 restaurants. 
One of Sam’s most famous restaurants, 
Izzy’s Steakhouse, opened in 1987 and be-
came a gathering place for the community. 
Patrons were welcomed, not only with com-
forting meals, but also by Sam’s renowned 
warmth and generosity. The restaurant was 
awarded Legacy Status on its 30th anniver-
sary as part of an initiative to recognize iconic 
establishments in San Francisco. Sam’s leg-
acy lives on through his daughter, Samantha,

Group and continues operations of Izzy’s. An-
other one of Sam’s restaurant’s, Elite Cafe,

rience that allowed them to escape the bus-
tling city. 
Sadly, Sam passed away on November 1,

member of our communities and he will be 
deeply missed. Please join us in honoring

HONORING CAPTAIN TIM CELLI 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Captain Tim 
Celli in celebration of his outstanding career in 
the Clearlake Police Department. 
Captain Celli was raised in Clearlake, Cali-
fornia, attending Burns Valley Elementary 
School, Oak Hill Middle School, and Lower 
Lake High School. His interest in law enforce-
ment began at an early age and led him to be-
come a youth explorer in 1986. After grad-
uating high school, Captain Celli joined the 
California National Guard in 1993, serving as 
a military policeman in the 649th Military Po-
lice Company. 
The next year, Captain Celli graduated from 
the police academy and began serving as a 
reserve police officer in the city of Waterford, 
California. In 1995, Captain Celli returned 
home to Clearlake and served as a reserve 
police officer and community service officer 
until 1999, when he was promoted to a full- 
time police officer. In his new role, he served 
as patrol officer, detective, field training officer, 
narcotics agent, explorer advisor, and presi-
dent of the Clearlake Police Officers’ Associa-
tion. 
In 2005, he was promoted to sergeant, su-
pervising both the patrol unit and the Crime 
Suppression Unit, which was formed to ad-
dress violent crime in Clearlake, California. In 
2012, Captain Celli was promoted to Lieuten-
ant, based on his excellent supervisory skills 
and his devotion to the community. In October 
2015, Captain Celli took on the role of as in-
terim chief of police, which he served as for 
over two years. In this role, he improved com-
munity engagement, introduced a dedicated 
traffic enforcement officer, addressed violent 
crime associated with illegal cannabis grows, 
and oversaw the department’s response to nu-
merous major fires. 
In addition to being a devoted officer of the 
Clearlake Police Department, Captain Celli is 
an active community member through his par-
ticipation in the Lion’s Service Club and a de-
voted husband to his wife, Amanda, who he 
has been married to for 24 years. Additionally, 
he has served as a coach of youth football, 
high school football, and youth wrestling in 
Lake County. Captain Celli is retiring after a 
26-year career in law enforcement. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Captain 
Celli has dedicated his life to the people of 
Clearlake through his public service. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor him 
here today.

HONORING VILLA DEL MAR 
RESTAURANT 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Villa Del Mar 
Restaurant of McAllen, Texas, an international 
family business celebrating 35 years of busi-
ness. 
Mr. Homero and Mrs. Marı´a Cristina Garza 
de Villarreal opened Villa Del Mar in Reynosa, 
Tamaulipas, Mexico in 1987. In 2005, the 
Villarreal family opened its first location in 
McAllen, Texas, quickly setting the standard 
for Mexican seafood in the Rio Grande Valley. 
Since then, Villa Del Mar Restaurant has 
united two countries and its people through 
their delicious cuisine. 
Villa Del Mar stands as a living testament to 
the success that can come when passion and 
hard work meet opportunity. The Villarreal 
family has faithfully served our community and 
now serves as an inspiration for all Texans as-
piring to succeed in business. Now, after a 
total of 35 years of service to the people of 
South Texas, I am proud to acknowledge their 
contributions to our region on the House floor. 
Villa Del Mar is a staple of Valley cuisine, and 
because of their hard work, it will continue to 
be one of South Texans’ favorite restaurants. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today to ac-
knowledge the countless achievements and 
successes of Villa Del Mar Restaurant and the 
Villarreal family, who have devoted their lives 
to giving the people of South Texas the high-
est quality of seafood and service. South 
Texas will be forever grateful.

ANNIVERSARY OF THE BAKU AND 
SUMGAIT POGROMS 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, as the Rep-
resentative of America’s largest and oldest Ar-
menian population, I rise today to commemo-
rate the Baku and Sumgait Pogroms and to 
reaffirm that the U.S. stands on the side of de-
mocracy and peace—and that means standing 
with the Armenian people. 
Over 30 years ago, as the lines of the So-
viet Union were fading, the people of Artsakh 
were united and voted for greater independ-
ence from Azerbaijan. But this peaceful move-
ment for self-determination was followed by 
premeditated and government-sponsored at-
tacks. Over the next two years, the Armenian 
population of Artsakh was repeatedly victim to 
brutal and racially motivated pogroms. Hun-
dreds were murdered, and thousands were 
displaced in Baku, Sumgait and Kirovabad. 
These pogroms were a direct assault on the 
right of self-determination in Artsakh, And it is 
an assault that is continuing today. In the fall 
of 2020, as the world was struggling to contain 
the 
corona 
virus 
pandemic, 
Azerbaijan 
launched yet another war of aggression 
against the peaceful people of Artsakh, de-
stroying homes and villages and once again 
displacing thousands. 
This violence is unacceptable, which is why 
I immediately called for a cease fire and have 
called for an end to U.S. military assistance to 
Azerbaijan. We must also ensure the humani-
tarian needs of the Armenian people are being 
met, which is something I have pushed 
Samantha Power, the Administrator of USAID, 
to help us do. 
Having had the privilege of visiting Artsakh 
in October 2019, I’ve seen the pride of the 
people there and I know how strong they are. 
That is why I know that, just as their spirit 
could not be defeated after the Sumgait and 
Baku pogroms, it will not be defeated today. 
I am proud to stand with the Armenian peo-
ple in their fight for democracy and human 
rights and stand united in rejecting the vio-
lence from Azerbaijan that has destroyed too 
many lives.

HONORING 
2022 
‘‘FORCE 
OF 
NA-
TURE’’ AWARD WINNER CAROL 
BROWNER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ms. Carol Browner, on 
being awarded the ‘‘Force of Nature’’ award 
by global non-profit Pure Earth. Her lifetime of 
dedication to protecting the environment and 
fighting for vulnerable populations makes Ms. 
Browner a true force of nature. Her significant 
contributions to environmental progress and 
sustainability are worthy of commendation. 
Born in Miami, Florida, she is a graduate of 
the University of Florida and the University of 
Florida College of Law. At home in South 
Miami, Ms. Browner grew up around nature 
and developed her love and appreciation for 
our environment and their natural resources 
early on by spending time visiting the nearby 
Everglades. Her first role was in the Florida 
House of Representatives as General Coun-
sel, working to revise the Conservation and 
Recreational Lands Program. She later moved 
to Washington, DC to advocate for the envi-
ronment and ended up working on Capitol Hill. 
She worked for Senator Lawton Chiles, the 
Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources, and as Legislative Director for Sen-
ator Al Gore. She then returned to her home 
state of Florida to serve as Secretary of Envi-
ronmental Regulation. 
After the election of President Bill Clinton, 
Ms. Browner was nominated for the position of 
Environmental Protection Agency Adminis-
trator. She was unanimously confirmed by the 
Senate on January 21, 1993. During this time, 
she notably helped strengthen the Clean Air 
Act and upped the United States position in 
the fight against global warming. After the end 
of the Clinton administration, she joined the 
Albright Group where she continued her works 
as an advocate for strengthening environ-
mental 
regulations 
and 
fighting 
climate 
change. At the start of a new Democratic ad-
ministration in 2009, President Barack Obama 
named her Director of the White House Office 
of Energy and Climate Change Policy. She 
helped negotiate the new automobile emission 
standards in 2009 and was a leader during the 
BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill of 2010. Dur-
ing the Obama administration, she secured a 
historic investment in clean energy and estab-
lished the first ever greenhouse gas reduction 
standards. Ms. Browner now serves on the 
board of directors for environmental groups, 
including as Chair for the League of Con-
servation Voters. 
Ms. Browner’s accomplishments are numer-
ous and impactful, and in every place that she 
has served, she has done all in her power to 
create positive change and put beneficial cli-
mate policy in action. She has been on the 
front lines of environmental policy for the past 
three decades and shows no sign of stopping 
anytime soon. She was named winner of the 
‘‘Force of Nature Award’’ for this year because 
of her ongoing efforts to protect children from 
environmental hazards, and for her recent es-
tablishment of the Protecting Every Child’s Po-
tential lead contamination prevention initiative. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Ms. Carol Browner as this 
year’s ‘‘Force of Nature’’ award winner. We 
are grateful for her continued work on behalf 
of our environment and congratulate her on 
this great honor.

‘‘everyone is our dear neighbor.’’ While Cal 
Poly’s Newman Catholic Center brought the 
gifted educator to the Central Coast, it is 
through her social and restorative justice work 
that she has truly made her mark. 
On the heels of her energetic work with stu-
dents and community parishes, and following 
medical leave for serious illness, she brought 
the ‘‘Get on the Bus’’ program to California 
Men’s Colony in San Luis Obispo County. A 
bus filled with the children and spouses of 
prisoners travels to the prison for a reunion 
party that offers hope for the families. 
Sister Theresa has worked with the SLO 
County Sheriff, the California Department of 
Corrections, Parole and the Courts to make 
restorative justice a reality in San Luis Obispo 
County. This tireless, well respected commu-
nity leader believes offenders were once vic-
tims whose own traumas were never ad-
dressed. She is devoted to healing those inju-
ries so that once released, prisoners can 
move forward to productive lives. 
Her fervent dedication to helping the incar-
cerated led to founding Restorative Partners, a 
program providing re-entry services to the in-
carcerated. Sister Theresa is a certified 
facilitator for the Alternatives to Violence 
Project, the Aggression Replacement Training 
and the Thinking for A Change Program. She 
has implemented and taught non-judgmental 
techniques and most importantly, restorative 
justice, which provides healing for all parties, 
both victim and offender. 
Restorative Partners, founded over an In N 
Out Burger conversation with Sheriff Ian Par-
kinson, celebrates its tenth anniversary this 
year. The successful program has brought to-
gether law enforcement, private business and 
faith-based organizations, under the shared 
mission to ‘‘get to the source’’ of individual’s 
issues and move forward. 
In just ten years, Restorative Partners has 
expanded mentorship to help returning citizens 
navigate reentry. With an eye on the high cost 
of living on the Central Coast, RP now pro-
vides re-entry homes for men and women, in-
cluding Anna’s Home for Women and Chil-
dren, which reunites formerly incarcerated 
mothers with their children while offering a 
drug treatment program. The challenges of 
COVID created an entirely new set of needs, 
chief among them domestic violence treatment 
and expanded drug and alcohol treatment. 
With Sister Theresa’s leadership, Restorative 
Partners continues to evolve and offer life- 
changing support. What began started as an 
in-custody service, the non-profit organization 
has grown to meet any need of families af-
fected by incarceration and the challenges of 
re-entry. And it is working: the recidivism rate 
for those Sister Theresa works with is only 10 
percent. 
Sister Theresa is an incredible presence in 
our community. I am honored to recognize 
Sister Theresa for her continued commitment 
to residents of San Luis Obispo County. I ask 
all Members to join me today in honoring an 
exceptional woman of California’s 24th Con-
gressional District, Sister Theresa Harpin, for 
her incredible service to her community.

Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Ellysia Vega is a student at Jefferson Jr./Sr.

her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Ellysia 
Vega is exemplary of the type of achievement

TROY WADE EULOGY 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the accomplishments and celebrate the 
life of Troy E. Wade. 
Robert Oppenheimer once said of the great 
physicist Niels Bohr about his contribution to 
the development of the atomic bomb: ‘‘It was 
a heroic time. It was not the doing of any one 
man; it involved the collaboration of scores of 
scientists from many different lands. But from 
first to last, the deeply creative, subtle and 
critical spirit of Niels Bohr guided, restrained, 
deepened, and finally transmuted the enter-
prise.’’ 
I believe the same thing could be said of 
Troy Wade and the nuclear weapons testing 
program. He guided, restrained, deepened, 
and transmuted the enterprise for policy mak-
ers, posterity, and for me personally. 
Troy certainly guided and transmuted the 
testing program for policy makers in his many 
positions in state and federal government, in-
cluding as President Reagan’s Assistant Sec-
retary of Energy for Defense Programs. As 
NTS historian Darwin Morgan said, ‘‘He was 
not a Washington stuffed shirt.’’ Instead, he 
was known to be a listener and used tact and 
tolerance to move his agenda which was al-
ways to protect this country and help promote 
peace. 
This was confirmed when I had a political 
event at Desert Research Institute during my 
first campaign for Congress. Troy was there to 
keep an eye on things and reassure the sweet 
little lady docents that the secret service dogs 
were not going to run off with the prehistoric 
bones in the museum. When Vice President 
Biden arrived, before I could introduce them, 
he said, ‘‘Oh, I know Troy Wade. I sat across 
the table from him many times in the Senate 
Foreign Affairs Committee. He was a tough 
but fair negotiator. A straight shooter, some-
one you could trust.’’ Obviously, no introduc-
tion was necessary. 
Troy also translated the testing program for 
posterity. He wanted people to know the story, 
the whole story, of the test site and the men 
and women on the front lines who helped us 
win the Cold War. To this end, Troy leaned on 
Nick and Chuck and Bruce and Linda who re-
financed their houses (without telling their 
spouses, although I bet Mary knew) to fund an 
atomic testing museum. The museum, thank-
fully, was a success. It is Smithsonian-sanc-
tioned and draws thousands of visitors annu-
ally, from local school children to foreign dig-
nitaries alike. And it indeed tells the whole 
story. In addition to bomb replicas, it relates 
the plight of the downwinders and offers a 
wonderful exhibit on the impact of the bomb 
on U.S. popular culture. 
Troy and I got in a bit of trouble, however, 
when I introduced a bill in the state legislature 
to create a special license plate to raise 
money for the museum. We wanted to put a 
mushroom cloud on it. As George Knapp 
quipped on Channel 8 News, it ‘‘would kick 
sand in the face of any other plate on the 
road.’’ Governor Guinn, unfortunately, vetoed 
our choice and we settled for the stylized atom 
design offered today. 
Finally, Troy transmuted the enterprise for 
me personally. He patiently answered ques-
tions as I did research for my book and often 
steered me in the right direction. He helped 
me secure AEC documents and records for 
the public reading room of the museum and 
he spoke to my classes. Most importantly, he 
became my friend. I often referred to Troy as 
the ‘‘ultimate cold warrior’’. I hope he took it as 
a compliment, because that’s certainly how I 
meant it. Like so many of his family, friends, 
and coworkers, I will miss him very much. As 
will a grateful Nation.

CONGRATULATING 
WILLIAM

BAKER 
ON 
HIS 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
THE 
CHESAPEAKE 
BAY 
FOUNDATION 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House to join me in recognizing 
William C. Baker for his thirty-nine years of 
environmental advocacy as President of the 
Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF). Will has 
demonstrated a sincere passion for improving 
the health of the Bay and ensuring that its en-
vironmental resources are preserved for future 
generations. Will has been a good friend, and 
I’ve been proud to work closely with him 
throughout the years to fight for a cleaner and 
healthier Chesapeake Bay. 
Since he first began his distinguished career 
with the CBF as an intern in 1976, Will worked 
relentlessly to protect and restore the Chesa-
peake Bay. Will became president in 1982, in-
heriting an immediate crisis: the 1982 Chesa-
peake Bay Study had just concluded that the 
Bay was dying. He spoke to the United States 
Senate, urging senators not only to maintain 
the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 
presence on the Bay but to establish an office 
to coordinate and monitor restoration efforts 
among the states in its watershed. Thanks to

his advocacy and hard work, Maryland, Vir-
ginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, 
the EPA, and the Chesapeake Bay Commis-
sion together signed the Chesapeake Bay 
Agreement and committed jointly to clean up 
the Bay. 
During Will’s tenure as president, the CBF 
reached new heights of success. His work 
helped expand the CBF’s membership to over 
300,000 and inspired so many Marylanders to 
share his passion for preserving one of our 
nation’s greatest natural treasures. He raised 
the CBF’s national profile, and the Save the 
Bay movement received international atten-
tion. Under Will’s leadership, the CBF received 
the 1992 Presidential Medal for Environmental 
Excellence—our 
nation’s 
highest 
environ-
mental honor—for its environmental education 
program. He was instrumental in the CBF’s ef-
forts to help restore the Bay’s oyster popu-
lation, which is critical not only to preserving a 
fragile ecosystem but also to sustaining and 
supporting one of the key aquaculture indus-
tries in our state. Although challenges remain, 
the CBF’s efforts have greatly improved the 
Bay’s health and continue to drive efforts for-
ward today to ensure that generations of 
Marylanders and Americans will be able to 
treasure the Chesapeake in the future. 
Madam Speaker, I offer Will my congratula-
tions on retiring from public service after a ca-
reer of great contribution to the well-being of 
Maryland’s beloved Chesapeake Bay. I hope 
all of my colleagues will join me in recognizing 
William C. Baker as he celebrates this mile-
stone and in wishing him all the best in the fu-
ture.

tion’s annual gathering on Friday, March 11, 
2022. James joins an impressive cohort of 
men recognized by the Friendly Sons as Man

descent. He has been, and continues to be, 
involved in many of the Friendly Sons’ en-
deavors, including the guest bartender pro-
gram, the annual Wilkes-Barre St. Patrick’s 
Day celebration, and the Irish teacher’s pro-
gram. In 2014, he was awarded the pres-
tigious Michael ‘‘Mickey’’ Hayden Memorial 
Award by past president and Hayden’s grand-
son, Patrick Peters, for his commitment pre-
serving the region’s Irish heritage. 
In addition to his service to the Friendly 
Sons, James has been a familiar face 
throughout the community, lending his time 
and expertise to organizations in the area. As 
a former collegiate baseball player, he shared 
his love and knowledge of the game as an of-
ficial for the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Ath-
letic Association (PIAA) and as president of 
the Wyoming Valley Chapter of the PIAA 
Baseball Umpires. He spent ten years on the 
board of the Wyoming Valley Sanitary Author-
ity as chair of the Personnel Committee and 
assistant treasurer. As a lifelong resident of 
Wilkes-Barre, James has been actively in-
volved in promoting the growth and develop-
ment of the city. He currently sits on the 
boards of the Wilkes-Barre Parking Authority 
and Wilkes-Barre Municipal Authority. He also 
serves as ad hoc chair of the Wilkes-Barre 
Redevelopment Authority. 
It is an honor to join with the Greater 
Wilkes-Barre Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in 
recognizing James as the Man of the Year. He 
has been a great champion of the City of 
Wilkes-Barre and the preservation of Irish 
American heritage in the region. I wish him all 
the best on St. Patrick’s Day.

CONGRATULATING CONNIE MILLER 
ON 45 YEARS AT THE BROWN 
HOUSE 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Ms. Connie Miller of Auburn, who just 
celebrated her 45th year working at The 
Brown House restaurant. 
Known for delicious ice cream and savory 
coney hot dogs, The Brown House has served 
the community of Auburn since 1949 when it 
first opened as a concession stand at the 
DeKalb County Free Fall Fair. Few things 
have changed about it since. 
Two weeks before her 16th birthday in 
1977, Connie started working at The Brown 
House. At the time, she was a sophomore 
working part time and did not intend to be 
there long. She was hired by owners Tom and 
Marcia Armstrong, who would operate the 
business for a total of 43 years until their re-
spective retirement in 2019—yet further proof 
of the restaurant’s continuity. 
Connie is definitive when asked what she 
enjoys most about her job. ‘‘People,’’ she 
says. When regulars patron the restaurant, 
they talk with her and ask about her on the 
occasion she is not there. She provides more 
than just a well-prepared meal, but a smile 
and fellowship to friends and patrons—in her 
eyes, one in the same. 
People like Connie make our community 
and country great. As American hero Agnes 
Meyer Driscoll once said, ‘‘Fortunate are the 
people whose roots are deep.’’ Few people’s 
roots run deeper in Auburn than Connie, and 
our community is eternally grateful for it.

HONORING REAR ADMIRAL 
RAYMOND CHARLES SMITH, JR. 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Rear Admiral 
Raymond Charles Smith, Jr. in celebration of 
his outstanding career in the U.S. Navy. 
Rear Admiral Raymond Charles Smith, Jr. 
was born and raised in Vallejo, California, 
graduating from St. Vincent’s High School in 
1961. Admiral Smith began his career in the 
Navy in 1962. Shortly after enlisting, he at-
tended the U.S. Naval Academy, which he 
graduated from in 1967. Later, in 1974, he 
earned a master’s degree in Physical Ocean-
ography from the Naval Postgraduate School 
in Monterey, California. 
Admiral Smith served as First Lieutenant on 
USS Floyd B. Parks for two years before par-
ticipating in Basic Underwater Demolition/ 
SEAL Training. After graduating from his 
SEAL Training in 1970, Admiral Smith served 
in a variety of positions on Underwater Demo-
lition Team Thirteen, including as Ordinance 
Officer, Operations Officer, and Platoon Com-
mander. 
In August 1990, he deployed to the Arabian 
Gulf in response to the Iraqi invasion of Ku-
wait, where he led Naval Special Warfare 
Task Group Central during Operations Desert 
Shield and Desert Storm. Then in June 1992, 
he assumed command of Naval Special War-
fare Command at Coronado, California, where 
he was responsible for over 2,300 SEALs and 
support personnel. From 1996 to 1998, Admi-
ral Smith moved to Tampa, Florida, and 
served as both Director of Resources and the 
Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Special 
Operations Command. He retired from active 
duty in 2001 after 34 years of service. 
During his retirement, Admiral Smith de-
voted himself to his three passions: family, fit-
ness, and community service. Admiral Smith 
was described as a great husband, father, and 
friend. He was married to his wife, Kathleen, 
for 54 years, with whom he had three sons: 
Raymond III, Nate, and Adam. Admiral Smith 
passed away peacefully at his home in Coro-
nado, California, on February 6,2022. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Rear Ad-
miral Raymond Charles Smith, Jr. dedicated 
his life to military service and our country. 
Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor 
him here today.

IN RECOGNITION OF SHEN YUN 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Shen 
Yun, and welcome it back to Lincoln Center 
for its 17th anniversary. Shen Yun is a clas-
sical Chinese dance and music company with 
the mission of preserving traditional Chinese 
culture. The name Shen Yun means ‘‘the 
beauty of divine beings dancing.’’ Shen Yun 
preserves, memorializes, and revitalizes an-
cient Chinese stories and traditions, intro-
ducing this rich culture and art form to New 
Yorkers and many other people around the 
world. 
In 2006, a group of Chinese artists, per-
secuted by the Chinese Communist Party for 
practicing Falun Dafa, founded Shen Yun to 
preserve their traditions and ancient history, 
which has been under threat since the Cultural 
Revolution. These artists chose to gather in 
New York, a testament to this city’s status as 
a haven for the arts, culture, and freedom. 
Shen Yun creates a new performance each 
year dedicated to these principles. 
Shen Yun’s performances draw from histor-
ical Chinese stories and legends such as 
Mulan and Journey to the West. Its dances 
are accompanied by traditional Chinese instru-
ments such as the pipa, suona, and dizi. 
Three of Shen Yun’s performers were recipi-
ents of the Chinese Ministry of Culture’s ‘‘Na-
tional First-Class Performer Awards’’. 
Shen Yun currently has seven troupes that 
travel and perform all around the world. The 
troupes perform in over 130 cities in North 
America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin 
America. In their first three years of touring, 
over 1 million people attended Shen Yun per-
formances. 
I congratulate them for their unwavering de-
votion not only to putting on a fantastic show, 
but to preserving cultural treasures for future 
generations. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Shen Yun for celebrating 
thousands of years of Chinese culture and his-
tory through traditional dance, orchestration, 
costumes, and more.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO RETIRED BIG 
BEAR 
LAKE 
MAYOR 
NEAL 
HERTZMANN ON THE OCCASION 
OF HIS PASSING 
HON. JAY OBERNOLTE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, it is 
with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor 
the passing of Neal Hertzmann, a constituent 
of my district and former Mayor of my home-
town of Big Bear Lake, California. Neal was 
an exceptional and dedicated public servant. 
He served Big Bear Lake as its mayor from 
1994 to 1998 and served Southern California 
for over twenty years including as a member 
of the Big Bear Lake Department of Water and 
Power Board, a Councilman for the City of Big 
Bear Lake, and as Big Bear Lake’s represent-
ative on the League of California Cities, just to 
name a few of his roles. In each position, Neal 
never lost sight of the unique qualities that 
make each of us proud to call our community 
home. 
In addition to his extensive public service, 
Neal was an innovative mechanical engineer 
by trade, and diligently worked on several of 
the Falcon missiles for Hughes Aircraft, which 
were among the very first operational guided 
air-to-air missiles adopted by the United 
States Air Force. His creative originality and 
expertise also proved vital in the development 
and success of the Surveyor program, which 
consisted of seven unmanned lunar missions 
launched between May 1966 and January 
1968, five of which successfully soft-landed on 
the lunar surface. The legendary success of 
the Apollo 11 mission would not have been 
possible if not for the crucial developments pi-
oneered by great men like Neal. 
Throughout his life, Neal sought opportuni-
ties to directly engage with neighbors, to meet 
new people, and to lend a helping hand wher-
ever he could. I am honored to have had the 
chance to know him and call him my friend, 
and I can say from firsthand experience how 
impactful his continuous dedication has been 
for our community. My prayers are with his 
family and the City of Big Bear Lake as we 
mourn the loss of this dedicated public serv-
ant.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF LIEUTENANT PETER BLUME, 
JR. 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
profound sadness that I rise today in recogni-
tion of the loss of a champion of his commu-
nity—Fire Police Lieutenant Peter Blume, Jr., 
of Vernon, Connecticut. Pete, as he was 
known, tragically left this world, still active in 
his service as a first responder, on March 2, 
2022, at the age of 53. A guardian to his fel-
low service members, Lieutenant Pete Blume 
has served with the Fire Police company for 
the last six years. He was known for his par-
ticularly infectious degree of optimism and was 
eating to all. 
Born to Carolyn Bolk Blume and Peter 
Blume on December 24, 1968, in South Wind-
sor, Pete was destined to live out his life as 
a source of energy within eastern Connecti-
cut’s communities. Upon graduating from 
South Windsor High, Pete went on to Eastern 
Connecticut 
State 
University 
where 
he 
achieved a degree in physical education in 
1991. A true steward of the community, he de-
voted the next nearly 20 years of his life to 
teaching as an elementary school physical 
education teacher for Ashford and Union, Con-
necticut. He was deeply passionate toward the 
growth of our region’s youngest generation, 
engaging with students as a youth program 
leader, the coach for the Ashford boys’ bas-
ketball team and even by taking on the title of 
Chef Blume as a cook for Union’s annual spa-
ghetti dinner fundraiser. 
Amidst his earlier days in teaching, Pete 
fostered a relationship with the love of his life, 
Wendy, who he married in 1996. It was 
through their relationship that Pete’s love for 
raising children transformed him into quite the 
family man, with the birth of their two children 
Allison and Timothy. Together, the family 
moved to Vernon, Connecticut where the chil-
dren became an inspiration to Pete, catalyzing 
an entirely new era of community involvement. 
It was throughout this new era that Pete grew 
in his already known love for youth sports, 
coaching and volunteering for his kids’ teams 
in Vernon Little League, Vernon Soccer and 
Vernon Basketball. 
Pete’s involvement with the Town of Vernon 
did not stop with his coaching the next gen-
eration. As we all know, he took an interest in 
and joined the Vernon Fire Department as a 
fire police officer, becoming the man respon-
sible for the safety of fellow first responders at 
the scene of an incident. Pete was the perfect 
man for the job—he was the kind of person 
who would give you the shut off his back if 
you needed it. As such, he was known for 
bringing an unmatched sense of diligence and 
care to the role, which he took incredibly seri-
ously. For Pete, the safety of those who dis-
played similar care toward his own neighbors 
was paramount. He was most recently recog-
nized for his diligence, becoming a lst Lieuten-
ant with the Vernon Fire Police company 
which he again served with for more than six 
years. 
Madam Speaker, we ask firefighters and 
their families to do an enormously important 
job across our community, our state, and our 
nation. Standing by every day of the year at 
all hours, Pete, Vernon’s ‘‘gentle giant,’’ has 
given true example to the dedication that first 
responders arm themselves with while serving 
their respective communities. In Pete’s case, 
he was also armed with a heart the size of 
Vernon. These brave men and women un-
questionably deserve the very best we can 
offer as a small form of gratitude for their sac-
rifice. While we mourn the void left by Pete’s 
loss, we find consolation in the memory he 
leaves behind. He is survived by his loving 
family, namely, his wife Wendy, who is also a 
teacher in Manchester. his two children Tim-
othy and Allison Blume, his mother Carolyn 
Blume, his brother, David Blume, and his sis-
ter Kristin McCauley. While his family will un-
doubtedly carry the legwork in extending the 
reach of his memory, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in supporting this effort, thanking Pete 
for a life of service and setting his name and 
character further into stone.

International Women’s Day to honor the life of 
Ms. Dorothy L.W. Smith, a dedicated educator 
and San Diego community leader who passed 
at the age of 82 on February 16th. Ms. Smith

Grossmont Community College, and later San 
Diego City College, where she was a pro-
fessor for 24 years. While teaching at San 
Diego City College she designed various 
courses, including one entitled ‘‘Black Women 
in Literature and the Media.’’ This course has 
now been taught in the San Diego Community 
College District for more than 45 years. She 
also lectured at San Diego State University, 
where she taught courses in teacher edu-
cation, rhetoric, and writing. She also lectured

be elected to the board. She served on the 
school board for eight years and twice was the

ture teachers.

IN RECOGNITION OF HARDIN 
WATKINS 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mr. Hardin Watkins’ recent retire-
ment as City Manager of Burlington, North 
Carolina. 
With his retirement on March 4, 2022, Mr. 
Watkins ended a 32-year career in public 
service. For the past six of those years, he 
has diligently worked to better the lives of the 
people of Burlington. Residents and city em-
ployees alike will miss his wealth of experi-
ence and institutional knowledge. 
A native of Hendersonville, North Carolina, 
Mr. Watkins attended the University of North 
Carolina where he earned both his Bachelor of 
Arts in Public Policy Analysis and his Masters 
of Public Administration. After completing his 
education, he accepted a position as a city 
planner in Bennettsville, South Carolina. He 
was soon offered a new challenge in Decatur, 
Georgia, where he was hired as an assistant 
to the city manager. Mr. Watkins was re-
warded for his hard work and dedication to the 
communities he served, and he was offered 
the position of City Manager of Suwanee, 
Georgia. However, after nearly a decade in 
that role, he returned to his home state in 
2007 to manage the Town of Garner, North 
Carolina. Finally, in 2016, he was hired as the 
City Manager of Burlington. 
The breadth of his work to improve the City 
of Burlington is remarkable. Within his six 
years at the helm of city government, Mr. Wat-
kins was instrumental in creating the city’s 
Economic Development Department, estab-
lishing the Community Police Advisory Team, 
and launching Link Transit in Burlington. Resi-
dents of Burlington will also be thankful for his 
efforts to restore the city’s antique Dentzel 
carousel and overhaul the city’s publicly 
owned golf course. 
Although Mr. Watkins has begun a new 
stage of life, he does not intend to idle in his 
retirement. Instead, he intends to continue his 
long record of improving communities. But 
perhaps most importantly, he will have well- 
deserved time to spend with his family. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking 
Mr. Hardin Watkins for his three decades of 
public service and wishing him the best in his 
future endeavors.

OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 5681 the Shadow Wolves 
Enhancement Act, to authorize the reclassi-
fication of the tactical enforcement officers 
(commonly known as the ‘‘Shadow Wolves’’) 
in the Homeland Security Investigations tac-
tical patrol unit operating on the lands of the 
Tohono O’odham Nation as special agents. 
The ‘‘Shadow Wolves’’ are a Native Amer-
ican tactical patrol unit assigned to Homeland 
Security Investigations (HSI) unit in Sells, Ari-
zona located on the Tohono O’odham Nation 
and was established by Congress in 1974. 
These officers specialize in the interdiction 
of human and drug smugglers in the rugged 
terrain of the Sonoran Desert. 
Under this bill, Shadow Wolves serving in 
these positions would be reclassified as GS– 
1811 special agents. 
As GS–1811 special agents, these officers 
would gain the statutory authority to carry fire-
arms, conduct searches & seizures, make ar-
rests, and receive a pay increase from an av-
erage of $37,000 a year to $50,000. 
Under existing authority, ‘‘Shadow Wolves’’ 
can only be hired as tactical officers at a lower 
paygrade, and those who wish to become HIS 
special agents receive no special consider-
ation, which has caused pay and mobility limi-
tations. 
Due to these limitations, the Shadow 
Wolves program is at risk of becoming non-
operational as officers retire. 
There are currently eight Shadow Wolves 
employed by ICE, five of whom meet the train-
ing requirements for conversion to the new 
pay status. 
The Act would also require the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to develop a strategy to re-
tain existing Shadow Wolves, recruit new offi-
cers to the unit, and expand comparable units 
along the Canadian and Mexican borders. 
One year after the development of the strat-
egy by the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
would be required to submit a report, as well 
as annually for the following 2 years, that will 
assess the effectiveness of this strategy and 
provide recommendations for improvement. 
I would like to personally thank the eight 
members of the Native American Tactical Pa-
trol Unit in the Tohono O’odham Nation for 
their work on preventing human trafficking and 
drug smuggling along our borders. Their work 
is of vital importance to the security of our Na-
tion and our citizens. 
And on behalf of the constituents of the 18th 
Congressional District of Texas, I would also 
like to thank all tactical enforcement officers 
from the United States Secret Service, United 
States Drug Enforcement Administration, Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
sives, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 
Homeland Security Investigations. 
It is our duty as Members of Congress to 
ensure that these officers are receiving fair 
pay for the hard work that they have under-
taken. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support this leg-
islation and urge all Members to vote in favor 
of H.R. 5681, the Shadow Wolves Enhance-
ment Act.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF 
JENIFER JEAN WRIGHT JOHNSON 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention today to recog-
nize the life of Jenifer Jean Wright Johnson. 
Jean passed away on February 6th, 2022. 
Jean was born on January 25, 1938, in Ro-
anoke, Alabama. She attended classes at 
Jacksonville Teachers College on the GI Bill 
and met her husband, Earl ‘‘PeeWee’’ John-
son at a school dance. 
The two were married on March 5th, 1957, 
at West Side Baptist Church. They were 
blessed with four children. 
After Jean graduated college, she worked 
as a substitute teacher. She took a job at 
Johnston Junior High in Anniston as the phys-
ical education teacher responsible also for the 
cheerleaders and girls’ sports teams. 
A few years later, she was approached by 
church elders and city council members from 
Jacksonville to start a low-income day care 
program. She worked to help raise funding to 
update the former Eastwood High School as 
well as working with the State of Alabama 
help secure funding. 
On September 30, 1970, the Jacksonville 
Day Care Center opened and also created a 
summer program. Jean took over as Director 
of East Alabama Child Development Centers 
and was responsible for over 20 day care cen-
ters across 11 counties. 
Jean had a heart for children and a great 
love for accessories. She will be missed. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Jean’s life of service.

DHS BASIC TRAINING ACCREDITA-
TION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 5616, the ‘‘DHS Basic 
Training Accreditation Improvement Act of 
2021’’ which addresses issues involving ac-
creditation and law enforcement training, re-
search, and development at the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS). 
This bill requires DHS to report annually to 
the congressional homeland security commit-
tees on the accreditation status for each basic 
training program within DHS.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E234 
March 8, 2022 
If a basic training program loses accredita-
tion, the relevant DHS component shall notify 
the department within 30 days after such loss. 
H.R. 5616 also would require the DHS 
Science and Technology Directorate to carry 
out research and development to enhance 
state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforce-
ment access to training on homeland security 
threats. 
Program level academic accreditation re-
quires a discipline to have identified and vet-
ted a set of student learning outcomes. 
Without accreditation it remains extremely 
difficult for a discipline to demonstrate true le-
gitimacy because there would be an absence 
of standards associated with the curriculum 
and teaching methods. 
Professional legitimacy requires that, inte-
grated with the discipline, is a recognized ac-
creditation process which helps develop incen-
tives for academic programs to adopt accredi-
tation into a widespread practice. 
There is a recognized need for responders 
from all disciplines, including public sector re-
sponders and private sector security profes-
sionals, to have the knowledge, skills and 
abilities that allow them to participate in 
Homeland Protection activities. 
Homeland Protection activities are common 
to both the public and private sector and in-
clude prevention, preparedness, protection, 
mitigation, response and recovery from, ‘‘all 
hazards’’, including terrorism. 
Employers must know that their employees 
and 
prospective 
employees 
have 
dem-
onstrated competency in the area of Home-
land Protection. 
Professionals must have a predetermined 
blend of experience and education, show com-
pleted course work in the knowledge areas re-
quired by the Certification Board and take an 
online course and pass the Homeland Protec-
tion Professional test. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates 
that meeting the reporting requirements of the 
bill would cost DHS less than $500,000 over 
the 2022 through 2026 period. 
For programs that are not accredited, the 
Secretary must provide the reasons for not ob-
taining or maintaining accreditation, the activi-
ties, taken to achieve accreditation, and the 
anticipated timeline for accreditation of the 
program. 
Unfortunately, several DHS law enforcement 
basic training programs are not accredited, in-
cluding the U.S. Border Patrol Academy, Cus-
toms and Border Protection’s Field Operations 
Academy Officer Basic Training Program, and 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ Of-
ficer Basic Training Program. 
In some cases, programs have been 
unaccredited for several years, e.g., the Bor-
der Patrol Academy submitted an initial appli-
cation in 2006 but did not pursue accreditation 
further. 
As the Chairwoman of the Crime, Terrorism, 
and Homeland Security Subcommittee, I be-
lieve efficient training can and will save lives, 
and that Department of Homeland Security of-
ficers deserve the highest standards of prepa-
ration. 
Proper training is the only way our authori-
ties can safely and effectively carry out their 
missions. 
Madam Speaker, we need to ensure that 
our DHS officers are properly trained and edu-
cated on their basic trainings. 
I urge all members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 5616, the ‘‘DHS Basic Training Ac-
creditation Improvement Act of 2021’’, which is 
critical to ensuring the safety of all Americans.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF 
FRANK CROW 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 8, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention today to recog-
nize the life of Frank Crow who passed away 
on February 23, 2022, doing what he loved to 
do—spending time outside on a snowmobile in 
Gallatin National Forest in Yellowstone Na-
tional Park. 
Frank lived in Jacksonville, Alabama, and 
was born on June 11, 1956. Everyone knew 
when Frank Crow entered the room because 
he always ended up being the center of atten-
tion. Not surprisingly, he even exited this world 
as the center of attention. 
Frank was born in Ludwigshafen, Germany, 
as the first of two children. After traveling the 
world as a military brat, his family relocated to 
Oneonta, Alabama, where he graduated with 
the class of 1974 from Oneonta High School. 
He received his undergraduate from Jack-
sonville State University in 1977, where he 
was an active member of the Sigma Nu Fra-
ternity. Frank served in the U.S. Army for 12 
years with training as an Airborne Ranger In-
fantryman ‘‘Grunt’’. His leadership talents were 
used with two company commands and two 
overseas tours (Germany and Korea). His at-
tention to detail and vision groomed his sol-
diers to raise the bar and exceed in all areas. 
He exited the military with the rank of Major in 
1989. He loved this country. After leaving the 
Military, Frank received two Masters’ Degrees 
from Jacksonville State University. He also en-
joyed substitute teaching and coaching football 
at Jacksonville High School. 
He lived a robust and full life. He was 
blessed with a loving family and wonderful 
friends. He loved being outside, hunting, fish-
ing, skiing, motorcycling and snowmobile 
riding. His talent for helping Veterans was his 
passion. He loved receiving calls from the indi-
viduals he helped with positive news from the 
VA. Many of the veterans he helped appre-
ciated his knowledge of the process that aided 
in the veterans increased benefits. ‘‘After you 
have suffered for a little while, the God of all 
grace, who called you to His eternal glory in 
Christ will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, 
and establish you.’’ 1 Peter 5:10 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Frank’s life of service and dedication to 
our country and our Veterans. He will be 
greatly missed. 
HOMELAND SECURITY 
CAPABILITIES PRESERVATION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 5615 the Homeland Secu-
rity Capabilities Preservation Act, to direct the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a 
plan to make Federal assistance available to 
certain urban areas that previously received 
Urban Area Security Initiative funding and 
were removed from the program. 
Then, the DHS Secretary is required to sub-
mit a plan to Congress on how to make Fed-
eral assistance available to former UASI juris-
dictions to help them take on the costs of pre-
serving UASI-funded homeland security pro-
grams. 
In the wake of September 11, 2001, there 
was a recognition that U.S. urban centers 
could be terrorist targets and did not have the 
resources to develop core capabilities to pre-
vent, protect against, and respond to terrorist 
attacks and other catastrophic events on their 
own. 
Over the past 18 years, UASI has played an 
instrumental role in helping these cities pre-
vent and respond to terrorist threats and at-
tacks. 
As a member of the Homeland Security 
Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, 
Response, and Recovery, I received testimony 
from Orlando Police Chief Orlando Rolon that 
addressed this issue. 
Police Chief Rolon testified that, for local 
law enforcement who are on the ‘‘front lines of 
responding to any emergency, whether it be a 
terrorist attack, natural disaster, or global pan-
demic, FEMA preparedness grants are critical 
resources that bolster law enforcement’s abil-
ity to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks 
and other associated threats.’’ 
Year-to-year changes in the terrorism risk 
picture, fluctuations in grant funding levels, 
and changes in DHS’ risk formula can result in 
jurisdictions suddenly falling out of the pro-
gram, after years of critical investment. 
The sudden loss of Federal support for 
maintaining essential homeland security capa-
bilities can place great strain on cities that 
may not have the resources to cover these 
costs. 
Jurisdictions that lost UASI grant funding 
often seek to continue partnering with DHS to 
ensure that they can maintain the security ca-
pabilities they achieved with UASI. These ju-
risdictions could be helped under H.R. 5615. 
This bill will help jurisdictions preserve their 
level of security capabilities by directing DHS 
to develop a plan for how to support the tran-
sition of costs associated with maintaining 
UASI-funded homeland security core capabili-
ties. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support this leg-
islation and urge all Members to vote for the 
H.R. 5615, Homeland Security Capabilities 
Preservation Act.
