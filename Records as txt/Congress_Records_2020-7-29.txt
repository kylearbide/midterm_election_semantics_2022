REALIZING AMERICA’S RACIST 
PAST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of legislation we just passed, 
the Commission on the Social Status of 
Black Men and Boys that was spon-
sored by my fellow Floridian, Congress-
woman WILSON. 
Slavery lasted for over 246 years in 
America, from 1619 to 1865. It is one of 
America’s original sins. People think 
of the Civil War as ancient history, but 
there are actually still even children of 
slaves alive today. They may be in 
their late eighties, early nineties, but 
it makes you realize it wasn’t that 
long ago. 
In the 13th through 15th Amend-
ments, we saw a great change prohib-
iting slavery, creating citizenship, due 
process, and the right to vote for Afri-
can Americans. 
Then, you had the Reconstruction 
Era. It started out with promising po-
tential. Federal troops helped ensure 
votes throughout the Nation. We elect-
ed African Americans to the House and 
Senate, and according to Sherman’s 
promise, everyone would get 40 acres 
and a mule. 
It all came tumbling down, though, 
starting with the assassination of 
President Abraham Lincoln, and Presi-
dent Johnson began to dismantle Re-
construction. Then, President Hayes 
ended Reconstruction in 1877 as part of 
a corrupt deal to ensure his Presi-
dency. 
Those in the South, African Ameri-
cans, were arrested and put on chain 
gangs, among other ways, to force 
them into indentured servitude. Those 
in the North and West faced discrimi-
nation, discrimination in jobs, housing, 
justice, education, healthcare, mar-
riage. 
Even 
facilities 
became 
seg-
regated. 
It reached a fevered pitch with ‘‘The 
Birth of a Nation’’ in 1915, restarting 
the KKK and lynchings and renewed in-
terest in the Confederacy, its leaders, 
and its symbols. It played upon every 
terrible stereotype of African-Amer-
ican men on the silver screen for an 
impressionable public to see. 
But it didn’t stop there. Financial 
segregation was generationally pun-
ishing. African-American troops fought 
in World War I and World War II in seg-
regated units for a country that dis-
criminated against them. Then, they 
came home and were shut out of the 
New Deal programs during the Great 
Depression, shut out of VA student 
loans and home loans. 
They missed out on the greatest ex-
pansion of the middle class during the 
1950s, and it was then that their re-
newed civil rights fight was just begin-
ning. 
With the success of the Civil Rights 
Act and Voting Rights Act of the 1960s, 
we saw some improvement, victories 
fought hard by JOHN LEWIS, who we 
just lost. 
Even with these advances, discrimi-
nation persisted in the systems of jus-
tice, finance, business, and other foun-
dations of our society. 
Add in the 1980 war on drugs and the 
1994 crime bill, and the list of laws and 
rules to systematically break up Black 
families, especially the arrest of Black 
men, reverberates today as our Nation 
looks inward after the murder of 
George Floyd about our country’s rac-
ist past and institutional bias against 
Black men and boys, as well as Black 
women and girls. 
This is why the Commission on the 
Social Status of Black Men and Boys, 
as well as the Justice in Policing Act, 
are so important. 
There must be an investigation, a re-
alization, and reckoning in America 
about the racist past of this country 
and generational theft. We must de-
velop lasting solutions if we are to 
progress as one Nation where every 
American is created equal.

DEMOCRAT INACTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, my colleagues across the aisle 
have developed a habit of harping 
about how Republicans are incorrectly 
addressing the priorities of the Amer-
ican people during the pandemic. 
This is a bold claim coming from 
them, seeing as they are the ones being

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

July 29, 2020 
caught playing political games on mul-
tiple occasions. Every day, Democrats 
echo 
those 
same 
fatigued 
talking 
points, and you can’t help but wonder 
if they realize that, in fact, they are 
the ones who have been wasting time 
all along. 
Denial is a powerful thing, Mr. 
Speaker. At a time when the American 
people demand leadership and account-
ability from Congress, Democrats have 
leaned on their political playbook for 
answers. 
At this point, are we really sur-
prised? Let’s recap what the Democrats 
have done to date. 
They have passed the so-called HE-
ROES Act, a $3 trillion socialist wish 
list that was crafted behind closed 
doors without bipartisan collaboration. 
They have undermined 200 years of 
precedent by implementing proxy vot-
ing. 
They have held virtual hearings 
where their Members are not phys-
ically present in the Capitol, and even 
one of their Members decided to phone 
in his vote to the committee while he 
was on his boat. 
Now, juxtapose that with the work 
we have taken up. 
Republicans have fought for schools 
to reopen safely. We have placed a high 
priority on strengthening our Nation’s 
economic 
recovery, 
and 
we 
have 
worked tirelessly to support frontline 
workers. 
Let President Trump and the admin-
istration be an example as well. 
Secretary Scalia of the Department 
of Labor recently came to my district 
to meet with frontline workers, edu-
cators, and members of the private sec-
tor to learn about North Carolina’s 
progress. 
Deputy Secretary Hargan of HHS vis-
ited Wake Forest Baptist Hospital in 
Winston-Salem to see the work being 
done by medical professionals to treat 
and protect North Carolinians. 
This week, President Trump traveled 
to North Carolina to meet with rep-
resentatives of a biotechnology com-
pany that is currently manufacturing a 
promising coronavirus vaccine. 
Mr. Speaker, the differences between 
the Republican approach and the Dem-
ocrat approach are night and day. I 
have said this before, and I will say it 
again: Democrats are choosing pos-
turing over progress. They have ample 
opportunities to work with us, but they 
are more interested in creating the 
newest media sound bite, further in-
flating the Federal bureaucracy and 
appeasing their far-left base. 
This isn’t an observation. This is a 
fact. When you think of progress, you 
think of frontline workers; you think 
of private-sector innovation; you think 
about the millions of children around 
the country safely returning to school; 
and you think of businesses reopening 
their doors to the public. 
When Republicans think of progress, 
that is what we envision. Sadly, Demo-
crats have become so entrenched in 
their own political narrative that they 
have failed to recognize the true prior-
ities of the American people. Repub-
licans will continue to work on the 
pressing needs of our Nation without 
delay. We can only hope that our Dem-
ocrat colleagues will come to their 
senses eventually.

THANKING CRAIG ROBERTS FOR 
HIS SERVICE AS CHIEF OF STAFF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
heard it said that being a chief of staff 
to a Member of Congress is one of the 
best jobs on the Hill. 
It takes a special person to keep the 
staff performing at the high level re-
quired of them. Burnout could easily 
occur because of long hours, high 
stress, and low pay. 
That is why I come to the floor to 
thank my chief of staff, Craig Roberts, 
for his 24 years of service to me, the 
people of Illinois, and the people of this 
country. Yes, you heard me right, 
Craig has been with me for 24 straight 
years. It really has to be some kind of 
record. 
Craig was born and raised in the 
Alton-Godfrey area of Madison County. 
He was one of those kids who was 
drawn to politics as a young kid, vol-
unteering for campaigns in high school. 
While attending Western Illinois Uni-
versity, he continued his studies and 
political activities. He graduated with 
a degree in political science and was an 
active member of the College Repub-
licans. 
Craig easily was hired by the Repub-
lican House staff in Illinois. I may have 
met him then, but my first direct and 
consistent contact with Craig was back 
in 1991 when he worked for the sec-
retary of state. He volunteered to take 
on the task of running my first con-
gressional campaign against an en-
trenched incumbent. 
Running for Congress is difficult. 
Running against an incumbent is even 
more difficult. Running against a pow-
erful, well-entrenched incumbent is 
crazy. Well, I was a little crazy, and I 
am glad Craig was, too, as he started 
the task to win the race. 
The district consisted of 19 counties. 
Neither of us had personal money, but 
we put a little bit of our own in. I paid 
for gas and my food. He ate the last 
month of his salary cost. 
We lost in the Clinton landslide in Il-
linois, but Craig’s involvement helped 
provide immediate legitimacy to the 
campaign and made it competitive. 
In 1996, I ran again, and this time, 
Craig was involved as an unpaid ad-
viser. This race, I won narrowly. Once 
I won, I knew I had to ask Craig to join 
me in D.C. and run my office. 
I made many local Republicans mad 
by taking Craig away from Springfield. 
In his time there, he had become high-
ly respected. That respect would be 
easily duplicated in D.C. 
Craig’s leadership style is uplifting 
and empowering. He softened my big- 
hammer style and calmed the seas 
when storm Shimkus was billowing. 
He is a mentor and a friend to all 
who come through his door. Team 
Shimkus staff members can be found 
all over D.C., from the executive 
branch to the Senate and the chief of 
staff of offices. They all stay in touch 
and reach out to Craig for advice. 
I left the D.C. hiring decisions to 
Craig. My theory is, if you hire some-
one and it doesn’t work out, you have 
to be the one to fire that person. 
My office staff is known for being 
open, accessible, friendly—most of the 
time—hardworking, 
and 
knowledge-
able. This is a tribute to Craig. Our 
limited turnover is also a tribute to 
him. 
Craig is a father figure to a bipar-
tisan group of chiefs of staff. Active in 
the Chief of Staff Association, he has 
helped Congress and Members work to-
gether. In the heat of Member battles, 
chiefs talking to chiefs can help work 
things out. 
He is also a proud and active Repub-
lican. He is known for his knowledge, 
organization, and planning. He volun-
teers and is an active member of the 
Capitol Hill Club, which is a Repub-
lican club up here on the Hill. 
But a good chief of staff has to be a 
confidential adviser to the Member. 
Members of Congress live in the gov-
ernmental and the political worlds si-
multaneously. So does the chief of 
staff. 
The chief of staff has to ensure that 
the ethical boundaries are known and 
obeyed. Action people take action and, 
many times, cross the line. Chiefs, and 
particularly Craig, pulls a Member— 
and that would be me—aside and keeps 
me away from the brink of doing some-
thing really stupid. 
Craig was and is available 24/7, 365 
days a year. Maybe upon my retire-
ment, he can get some rest, but I doubt 
he will. 
We both carry the political and gov-
ernmental scars of 24 years of service. 
Some can be seen while others cannot 
be seen. It is those scars that will for-
ever bind us together. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Craig for join-
ing me in D.C., thank him for staying 
with me, and thank him for being the 
best chief of staff on the Hill.

DO NOT LET DEATH OF ENRIQUE 
ROMAN-MARTINEZ GO UNSOLVED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. TORRES) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to decry a trag-
edy that has pierced the heart of my 
community, a tragedy that continues 
to cut deeper with each passing day be-
cause we still don’t know what hap-
pened. We still have no answers. 
All we know is that one of our very 
best, one of our brightest, is dead. Our 
hearts are broken, and we demand an-
swers. Army specialist Enrique Roman- 
Martinez was a Chino native who 
makes the whole Inland Empire proud.

He joined the Army before he was 
even old enough to vote. He begged his 
mother to sign the release forms. That 
is how committed he was to our coun-
try and to others. 
He was stationed at Fort Bragg in 
North Carolina and went camping in 
the Outer Banks over Memorial Day 
weekend with seven other soldiers. We 
don’t know what happened that night 
on May 22, but what we do know is it 
cost Enrique his life, and the seven 
people who would seemingly have a lot 
of explaining to do, remarkably, had 
nothing to say. 
When a police officer walked up to 
their campsite the next day and asked 
those seven soldiers to move their ille-
gally parked vehicles, not a single one 
thought it was important enough to 
mention that someone who had been 
camping with them, their friend and 
their fellow soldier, was missing from 
the night before. It took a full 17 hours 
before they spoke out and reported 
Enrique gone. When they did so, they 
said they were worried that Enrique 
was suicidal. 
It is hard for me to imagine why any-
one would hesitate to tell a police offi-
cer that their fellow camper, their 
friend, and their fellow soldier was 
missing if they thought he was suici-
dal. 
A week later, Specialist Roman-Mar-
tinez’s remains were found washed 
ashore not far away. The question of 
whether or not he was suicidal was set-
tled by the simple fact that they only 
found a severed head—his head. That is 
it. 
He was just 21 years old. He had just 
started out in life. He had dedicated his 
few short years as an adult to a cause 
much greater than himself. He was 
only 3 months away from completing 
his duty and coming home as a vet-
eran. Someone like that deserves bet-
ter than this. His family deserves bet-
ter for the son and brother that they 
have loved and lost. 
I would like to take a moment to 
talk about Enrique’s family, his moth-
er, Maria, and sister, Griselda, because 
one of the most solemn and sacred du-
ties our military has is their commit-
ment to leave no one behind on the 
battlefield. It is their duty to inform 
the family when something goes wrong. 
Mr. Speaker, as the mother of an Air 
Force veteran, I can tell you the fear of 
receiving a notice like that was with 
me every single day my son served. It 
is an ongoing unease in the back of 
your mind that never goes away. It is 
something I can still feel today. 
Now, imagine if Enrique were your 
son. The only thing worse than a con-
versation like that is if that conversa-
tion never happens—never. That is 
what happened to Maria and Griselda. 
The Army was so slow to inform the 
family 
that 
they 
learned 
through 
media reports their son had been muti-
lated—through media reports. 
The 
medical 
examiner 
ruled 
Enrique’s death a homicide on that 
Monday, and it took the Army until 
Friday to reach out to the family. The 
lack of notice was bad enough, but the 
lack of answers is still far worse. It is 
time to hear more from the seven indi-
viduals. Their silence isn’t acceptable. 
It is time to hear from the community 
in North Carolina. If they know some-
thing, say something. 
As a mother, I plead with them, if it 
were their son, if they are the mother 
of one of those seven young soldiers, 
male or female, say something. They 
need to talk to their son or daughter 
and demand that they speak out. 
Lawyering 
up 
is 
not 
enough. 
Lawyering up is not enough. They de-
serve to bury their son and brother. 
f 
NATIONAL PARKS AND 
RECREATION MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
July as National Park and Recreation 
Month. 
Our Nation is blessed with a robust 
park system across the country on the 
Federal, State, and local levels. Sum-
mer is a popular time to take advan-
tage of all that our parks have to offer. 
The coronavirus pandemic and the 
shelter-in-place orders that have fol-
lowed have left many of us desperate 
for fresh air, and as many parks begin 
to reopen, there are plenty of beautiful 
landscapes and outdoor activities to 
enjoy at parks across the country. 
As a lifelong resident of rural Penn-
sylvania, an avid outdoorsman, and 
someone who was a former recreational 
therapist at one point, I know first-
hand the positive impact that our Na-
tion’s parks system can have on com-
munities, and I am proud to be a strong 
supporter. 
My district, Pennsylvania’s 15th Con-
gressional District, is home to count-
less parks and outdoor recreational fa-
cilities, including the Oil Region Na-
tional Heritage Area and the Allegheny 
National Forest, just to name a few. 
This month is an opportunity to un-
derscore the role that parks play in our 
everyday lives and in the fabric of 
American culture. It is also an oppor-
tunity to recognize the hard work and 
contributions of our park employees. 
Our parks give us all an opportunity to 
connect with the nature around us. 
They create a sense of community, 
stimulate local economies by attract-
ing businesses, jobs, and tourism, and 
increase the quality of life for all resi-
dents. 
Mr. Speaker, public parks and rec-
reational facilities foster a variety of 
activities 
that 
contribute 
to 
a 
healthier society. There is an undeni-
able connection between parks and 
public health. Studies show that Amer-
icans who live within a 10-minute walk 
of a park see increased physical activ-
ity and lower obesity rates. 
Recreational 
programs 
at 
public 
parks provide children with a safe 
place to play, access to healthy foods, 
opportunities to be physically active, 
and enrichment activities that help 
prevent at-risk behavior such as drug 
use and gang involvement. 
Just last week, the House passed the 
Great American Outdoors Act, legisla-
tion that will ensure our national 
parks are around for future generations 
to enjoy. 
As summer continues, it is my hope 
that families across the country will 
find an opportunity to take advantage 
of our Nation’s parks and recreation fa-
cilities. If considering a visit to one of 
our national parks, visit the National 
Park Service website at nps.gov to find 
an open park in your community. 
f 
APPROPRIATIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to stress the importance of investing in 
programs that expand opportunities for 
every person in every corner of our Na-
tion, including my district in Califor-
nia’s San Joaquin Valley. 
Just last week, we passed a spending 
bill that will benefit our farmers, re-
pair aging water infrastructure, help 
food-insecure residents from going hun-
gry, support revitalization efforts on 
our public lands, and combat the cli-
mate crisis by cleaning our air. 
This week, we have an opportunity to 
make further investments in the future 
sustainability of our Nation. 
Face it, Mr. Speaker, we are living 
off the investments our parents and 
grandparents made a generation ago. 
The availability of a reliable supply 
of water is the foundation of the San 
Joaquin Valley’s economy and, I might 
add, California and much of the West, 
which grows food that feeds the world. 
As we say, where water flows, food 
grows. 
We also must ensure access to clean 
drinking water so our communities can 
thrive. No one should have to worry in 
the richest nation in the world of hav-
ing access to clean water in their 
homes. 
These bills will provide more than 
$100 billion to help repair the aging val-
ley canals, such as the Delta-Mendota 
Canal, the Friant-Kern Canal, and the 
California Aqueduct, which are critical 
to delivering water to not only our 
farmers but to our valley communities. 
These bills would also make small, 
disadvantaged communities safer and 
healthier by providing nearly $1 billion 
for infrastructure repairs, communities 
like Dos Palos, Livingston, Fairmead, 
and Los Banos in the San Joaquin Val-
ley to name but a few. It also provides 
more than $10 billion for clean water 
and drinking water State revolving 
funds, which are important. It matches 
funds and is the best use of money. 
We have been living off these invest-
ments, as I said, for way too long. The

coronavirus pandemic has worsened 
Americans’ food insecurity crisis as we 
have witnessed, but with this bill we 
have an opportunity to ensure hungry 
Americans, especially children and sen-
iors, have access to nutritious food. 
For more than 50 years, hungry 
Americans have relied on the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program, 
known as SNAP, to keep from going 
hungry. These are the working poor 
and young and old alike. Thirty-eight 
million Americans, including 25 per-
cent of my constituents, depend on 
these programs. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I 
fought to increase funding and expand 
eligibility for this program, which has 
come under constant attack from the 
administration, and I don’t understand 
it. There has never been a right time to 
cut support for the most vulnerable 
residents in our country, and doing so 
now certainly is not righteous in deal-
ing with this worldwide pandemic. 
The package also includes significant 
funding for agriculture research pro-
grams to help mitigate crop diseases, 
eradicate invasive species like the 
navel orange worm, and also has cost 
billions of dollars in California’s agri-
culture economy. In addition, we need 
to do more for farmworkers’ safety, 
people who are working in partnership 
with farmers to, every day, put food on 
America’s dinner table, as well as for 
our packing sheds and our food proc-
essing facilities. 
The climate crisis is having an un-
questionable impact on the planet. 
This bill makes significant invest-
ments to preserve America’s land-
scapes and prevent the worst impacts 
of climate change. 
California’s San Joaquin Valley, un-
fortunately, has some of the worst air 
in the Nation. By providing $450 billion 
in grant funding for the Diesel Emis-
sion Reduction Act, this bill will help 
replace and retrofit emission diesel 
fuels for cleaner burning options to 
help clean our air. 
These DERA grants have already re-
moved dozens of air-polluting vehicles 
from our valley roads, creating imme-
diate and tangible results. I have 
worked for decades to improve our air 
quality and remain committed to find-
ing resources to improve our environ-
ment and reduce pollution. 
In California, sadly, we have wildfires 
that have caused incredible destruction 
and hardship to California’s mountain 
communities. There are estimated to 
be more than 100 million dead trees in 
the State from multiple causes. This 
spending bill will provide nearly $6 bil-
lion to help maintain our forests and 
fight deadly fires. We must do more to 
manage our fires and prevent dev-
astating fires. This bill will help us do 
just that. That is why these appropria-
tions bills are so important. 
Finally, it makes strong investments 
in our nature preservation, wildlife 
conservation, and ecological protec-
tions by providing $500 million to sup-
port areas like San Luis National Wild-
life Refuge near Los Banos, the impor-
tant refuge area for the Pacific Flyway 
between Canada and Mexico, an impor-
tant wildlife refuge. 
This spending bill prioritizes public 
health and safety, invests in our aging 
infrastructure, protects the environ-
ment, and prepares us for a brighter fu-
ture. I am proud to vote for it, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same in a 
bipartisan fashion. 
Finally, we must also pass a bipar-
tisan version of the HEROES Act for 
all the right reasons, which is con-
tained in that legislation: for our 
States, for our counties, for our cities, 
for those who work there, for our 
healthcare workers, for further testing, 
and to create a safety net for American 
agriculture. 
I encourage my colleagues across the 
aisle to do that as well. We must work 
together during this pandemic that is

EXCEPTIONS TO POSSE 
COMITATUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BYRNE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, the Insur-
rection Act was passed in 1807 and 
signed into law by Thomas Jefferson as 
a delegation by the Congress to the 
President of the power granted under 
Article I, Section 8, Clause 15 of the 
Constitution to call forth U.S. Armed 
Forces, number one, to execute the 
laws; number two, suppress insurrec-
tions; and, number three, repeal inva-
sions. 
In 1827, the President’s power to do so 
was upheld by the Supreme Court in 
Martin v. Mott. 
In 1861, it was amended to add a sec-
tion empowering the President to use 
the Armed Forces against the will of 
the Governor of a State in the case of 
a rebellion against the authority of the 
Government of the United States. 
In 1871, it was amended again to 
allow the President to use U.S. Armed 
Forces to enforce the Equal Protection 
Clause of the 14th Amendment and pro-
tect Black people from the Ku Klux 
Klan. President Grant used it three 
times. 
To get Democrat support for Presi-
dent Rutherford Hayes in this House 
during the aftermath of the disputed 
1876 
Presidential 
election, 
Hayes 
agreed to remove Federal troops from 
the South, which ended Reconstruc-
tion. 
The Posse Comitatus Act was passed 
in 1878 to limit the use of U.S. Armed 
Forces in domestic matters, thus codi-
fying the compromise. 
b 0930 
The Insurrection Act provisions are 
construed as specified exceptions to the 
Posse Comitatus Act. As such, it has 
been used by Democrat Presidents, 
Grover Cleveland, Woodrow Wilson, 
Franklin Roosevelt, JOHN
KENNEDY, 
and Lyndon Johnson. 
Roosevelt used it to put an end to a 
Detroit race riot during which 25 Black 
people were killed, and over 400 were 
injured. 
President Eisenhower used it to de-
segregate Little Rock schools. 
Kennedy used it to end the race riot 
at the University of Mississippi in 1962, 
after James Meredith, a Black man, 
was enrolled there. He used it again in 
my home State when Democratic Gov-
ernor, George Wallace, disgracefully 
tried to block the enrollment of Vivian 
Malone and James Hood, both Black 
people, at the University of Alabama. 
He also used it to enforce the desegre-
gation of public schools in Alabama in 
reaction to the hate-filled environment 
around the State Wallace encouraged. 
In 1989, it was used by George H.W. 
Bush in St. Croix in the aftermath of 
Hurricane Hugo; and again in 1992, 
when the Governor of California asked 
for assistance in the riots which fol-
lowed the beating of Rodney King. 
It has not been used since. Nor did 
President Trump use it earlier this 
summer here in Washington. All mili-
tary personnel used here this year were 
National Guard, the authorization of 
which was not needed under the Insur-
rection Act in this Federal city. 
Nonetheless, last week this House ap-
proved an amendment to the National 
Defense Authorization Act to substan-
tially weaken the operations of the 
military under the Insurrection Act. 
Let me be clear: Over the last 200 
years, this law has only been used spar-
ingly and only under extreme cir-
cumstances, which is only appropriate 
in a country which highly values the 
civilian control of our military. Our 
Armed Services have a primary mis-
sion to protect us from enemies with-
out our country. They should rarely be 
used to do so with people within our 
country. 
This unwise House amendment for-
bids our military when they are called 
out under the Insurrection Act from 
participating in search, seizure, arrest, 
or ‘‘other similar activity,’’ unless 
‘‘otherwise expressly authorized by 
law.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the Insurrection Act is 
the primary provision that is expressly 
authorized by law. This amendment 
would effectively make the Insurrec-
tion Act toothless. 
Imagine General Grant cleaning out 
the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina 
with the limiting language of the 
amendment. 
Imagine Franklin Roosevelt quelling 
the Detroit race riot and protecting in-
nocent Black people with that limita-
tion. 
How about President Kennedy pro-
tecting Black students just trying to 
attend their State universities in Mis-
sissippi and Alabama in the face of vio-
lent racists and the Ku Klux Klan. 
What is this House thinking? I sub-
mit, in this instance, the House didn’t 
think. It just reacted, as it has these 
last 2 years, with blind indignation 
against President Trump. I say ‘‘blind’’

because I don’t believe many would 
have voted for such language if Hillary 
Clinton was President. Thank God the 
Senate didn’t include this language in 
their version of the NDAA. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the conferees from 
both Houses and both parties to reject 
this rash amendment and for all of us 
to return to our senses. Insurrections 
are rare but ugly things. Let’s not tie 
a future President’s hands at a time 
when our people may need his, and our 
military’s, protection here at home. 
f 
CITIZENS UNITE FOR PEACEFUL 
PROTESTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
morning to express the extent to which 
I am proud of my constituents in 
southwestern Connecticut in Connecti-
cut’s Fourth Congressional District, 
but also to observe that just as in this 
country we have work to do in address-
ing the racial disparities that exists in 
all of our institutions, we have work to 
do in Connecticut’s Fourth District. 
Mr. Speaker, I was enormously proud 
that after we began to bend the curve 
on coronavirus—thanks to the leader-
ship of our Governor, Ned Lamont— 
just as we saw those numbers begin to 
decline, like the rest of the country, 
my constituents were appalled by the 
brutal murder of George Floyd in Min-
neapolis. Nobody was unaffected by 
what we saw that day. 
To the great credit of my constitu-
ents, people rose up in the broad diver-
sity of my constituency. My constitu-
ency includes some of the wealthiest, 
small, and—yes—very White towns in 
the country: Towns like New Canaan 
and Darien. It also includes diverse cit-
ies that struggle with the issues of 
urban poverty: Bridgeport, Norwalk, 
and Stamford. 
But as one, my constituents rose up— 
young, 
old, 
poor, 
wealthy, 
Black, 
White, 
straight, 
LGBTQ—and 
de-
manded progress and change, and they 
did it peacefully. They did it side by 
side with the leaders of the Police De-
partment of Stamford, of Wilton, of 
New Canaan—police chiefs standing 
side by side with Black Lives Matter 
protestors. That was a good thing. 
That was an example of how we come 
together in the face of something 
awful. 
But I also rise because there is no 
room for complacency. I remind my 
fellow citizens of Connecticut, while we 
are a progressive State, and while we 
did come together in all of our commu-
nities, it could happen here. I remind 
my constituents that Connecticut was 
actually the last State in New England 
in 1848 to eliminate slavery. That is 
just a few years before Abraham Lin-
coln did so in the South and around the 
country. So there is no place for com-
placency amongst my constituents. 
And the truth is, as I have observed 
and many have observed, what hap-
pened to George Floyd is the pinnacle 
atop a structure of four centuries of 
racism and discrimination. Of course, 
George Floyd is not alone. The names 
echo in the chamber of shame in this 
country. 
Breonna 
Taylor. 
Tamir 
Rice. 
Ahmaud Arbery. The names echo, and 
they go on and on. 
But those Black Americans who have 
been killed unjustly sit atop a struc-
ture of the denial of equal access to op-
portunity. And that is in our systems 
of housing, our systems of education, 
and in the private sector. 
So even as I celebrate and express my 
pride in my constituents, we need to be 
there for the broader struggle. We need 
to be there as we consider how we 
make one of the more segregated 
parts—at least with respect to housing 
in the United States—more fair. We 
need to be there when we contemplate 
the fact that too many of our Black 
and Brown brothers and sisters don’t 
have the access to the extraordinary 
educational institutions in the State of 
Connecticut and around the country. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to be there. It 
is good to show up and protest peace-
fully when a Black man is murdered at 
the hands of the police, but it is not 
enough because that act sits atop an 
edifice—a four-century long edifice—of 
discrimination, the effects of which 
still echo through every aspect of our 
society. 
Mr. Speaker, it is not just my con-
stituents. It is this Chamber and this 
Congress that must get serious about 
addressing the unequal distribution of 
opportunity in this country. That is 
our mission. I just said goodbye, with 
so many of my colleagues, to JOHN 
LEWIS. I know that is what John would 
have us do, and I know that he would 
have us do it with grace and with dig-
nity and humility. 
Mr. Speaker, that is what I charge 
my constituents with, and that is what 
I hope this Congress will address, in 
the memory of JOHN LEWIS, who just 
left us this morning.

CLIFTY FALLS 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Clifty Falls State Park for 
its 100th anniversary. Located in beau-
tiful Madison, Indiana, Clifty Falls 
gives its visitors an experience that 
you can’t get anywhere else. 
For 100 years, Hoosiers and Ameri-
cans across the Nation have enjoyed 
beautiful hiking trails and waterfalls 
in Clifty Falls. I congratulate Clifty 
Falls State Park for its 100-year anni-
versary. Indiana is lucky to have such 
a beautiful place. 
KEEP AMERICA SAFE 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to challenge mayors, Governors, lead-
ers of this country to stand up and shut 
down the rioting we are witnessing in 
communities across our Nation. Anar-
chists are destroying homes, busi-
nesses, and whole communities. These 
people are not peaceful protestors. 
They are violent agitators. 
The leaders of these cities need to get 
their act together and end this vio-
lence. American citizens are getting 
hurt and, yes, even killed, and it is 
time to stop this madness. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in calling to end this lawless-
ness and to help keep all of our com-
munities safe across this country. 
REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to voice my strong support for reopen-
ing schools across our Nation. I have 
been talking to parents in my district, 
Indiana’s Sixth District, and the con-
sensus is in: Let’s get our kids back to 
school. 
The science is on our side. Both the 
CDC and Academy of Pediatrics agree 
it is safe to reopen our schools. In fact, 
it would be unsafe to keep our schools 
closed. The emotional scarring, unre-
ported abuse, and learning deficits of 
keeping our kids stuck inside staring 
at a screen and away from socialization 
is far too great. Working parents doing 
everything they can to put food on the 
table, they need our support. 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot let an entire 
generation fall behind in education. We 
must find a safe way to reopen our 
schools. 
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to voice my support for President Don-
ald J. Trump. 
Perseverance in the face of lies from 
the media and his political opponents 
shows fearless leadership and should be 
admired. 
The D.C. swamp continues to attack 
him relentlessly, stopping at nothing 
to take him down. The collateral dam-
age in this grotesque war against our 
President is the American people. 
President Trump created an economy 
where minorities were thriving, work-
ers and families had good-paying jobs, 
and businesses were finally flourishing. 
When Democrats and the media do ev-
erything 
in 
their 
power 
to 
halt 
Trump’s work, they are actually at-
tacking the very American way of life 
that we hold dear. 
Mr. Speaker, I pledge to continue to 
support President Donald Trump and 
his agenda to make the American peo-
ple stronger than ever. 
MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR NATION 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to bring attention to the mental health 
crisis our Nation faces as we navigate 
the COVID–19 pandemic. The pandemic 
and the resulting economic crisis have 
resulted in a mental health and sub-
stance abuse crisis like we have never 
seen before. 
Veterans, 
students, 
families, 
and 
Americans with a history of mental ill-
ness or addiction are really suffering. 
To continue to shut down our country 
does not make scientific sense, eco-
nomic sense, or common sense. It is

NORTH CAROLINA’S ROLE IN PRO-
DUCING CORONAVIRUS VACCINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight the amazing work being 
done to produce a vaccine for the 
coronavirus. Some of the best work in 
our country is coming from FUJIFILM 
Diosynth Biotechnologies’ Innovation 
Center in my home State of North 
Carolina. 
On 
Monday, 
July 
27, 
President 
Trump visited the Morrisville labora-
tories and touted the progress that has 
been made in Operation Warp Speed to-
ward producing an effective vaccine in 
historic time. The Morrisville labora-
tories play a crucial role in that effort 
because they are working on a bulk 
drug substance for one of the possible 
vaccines. 
It is impossible to overstate how im-
portant a vaccine will be for our Na-
tion, and I am proud that North Caro-
lina is on the front lines of that re-
search. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the President 
for highlighting these facilities’ excit-
ing work, and especially thank the re-
searchers, the doctors, and the sci-
entists for their tireless work, and wish 
them every success possible. 
RESTORING LAW AND ORDER 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to stand up for law and order and safe-
ty and security in our country. 
In an era where some in the opposi-
tion party advocate for defunding the 
police, violent crime and rioting has 
swept across the Nation. No city has 
endured more violence and less govern-
ment action than Portland, Oregon. 
For 60 days, local officials have re-
fused to protect the fundamental rights 
of their citizens, mainly the right to 
life, to liberty, and to personal prop-
erty. I believe that if State and local 
officials won’t secure these rights for 
their fellow Americans, then the Fed-
eral Government should do it for them 
at the direction of the President. I 
fully support the President’s deploy-
ment of Federal officers to restore law 
and order and safety and security on 
the streets of Portland. 
One of the most heartbreaking epi-
sodes of the violent crime that has oc-
curred recently occurred in Kansas 
City, Missouri, where a four-year-old, 
LeGend Taliferro, was shot and killed 
while he was asleep in his own bed. It 
was just a month ago on June 29. 
Mr. Speaker, the only way to deal 
with violent criminals is to meet them 
with strength. And that is what the 
President is doing by initiating a Fed-
eral law enforcement operation, appro-
priately named Operation Legend. Very 
simply, this operation will focus on 
putting more cops on the streets in 
high-crime cities, making more fund-
ing available for local police depart-
ments, and use Federal officers when 
local officials refuse to act. 
Mr. Speaker, we are never going to 
defund the police. Instead, we are going 
to empower them to stop this crime 
surge that is terrorizing our American 
brothers and sisters.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick

Lord God, thank You for giving us

Please excuse us for coming to You, 
day after day, asking for Your blessing 
and grace as the coronavirus plague 
continues to ravage our Nation. We 
struggle, still, to address the crisis in 
any way that slows this deadly ad-
vance. Lord, have mercy. 
Bless the Members of this people’s 
House with wisdom and a purpose of 
cooperation in addressing so many dan-
gers facing us, from health to financial 
threats. Bless the Senate, too, and the 
administration, that together our Na-
tion might move forward with hope and

GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR STREETS 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, illegally obtained guns are 
pouring over the streets of commu-
nities across the country, including in 
my community of Buffalo, New York. 
These illegal guns are responsible for 
tragic deaths. Last year, 30,000 Ameri-
cans, 
including 
262 
children, 
were 
killed by gun violence. 
The number of slain Americans are 
more than just statistics; they are real 
people: fathers, mothers, grandparents, 
sons, daughters, and grandkids. They 
had dreams, they had aspirations, and 
they had their whole lives ahead of 
them. 
This is an urgent call to action 
against gun violence. Members of my 
community are coming together and 
they are calling on Congress to repeal 
provisions that prohibit our govern-
ment from knowing if firearms have 
been lost or stolen. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this call to ac-
tion and urge this body to continue to 
work to make our communities safer 
for all. Those whose lives were lost 
would still be with us today if legisla-
tion this House passed, commonsense 
gun 
reforms, 
universal 
background 
checks, and a ban on assault weapons, 
were enacted into law. 
We must do better. Repeal the Tiahrt 
amendment now. 
f 
CENSORING BY SOCIAL MEDIA 
PLATFORMS 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to bring attention to an alarming 
trend: the censorship of Americans by 
American 
companies, 
particularly 
those in the social media sector. 
Over and over, we hear about social 
media 
platforms 
silencing 
conserv-
atives and their views, only to turn 
around and ask this Congress for con-
tinued liability protections. 
If social media companies expect 
such legal protection, they must recog-
nize the fundamental free speech of 
their users. To be clear, I am not refer-
ring to hate speech or calls for vio-
lence. I am referring to political views 
that differ from those who own and 
manage these companies. 
As this Congress considers and de-
bates the regulation of these compa-
nies into the 21st century, we should 
take this political censorship into ac-
count. No American, no matter what 
their affiliation or opinions, should 
ever be prevented from lawfully exer-
cising 
their 
constitutional 
rights, 
whether online or in person. 
Social media, for sure, has done won-
ders to connect people, but it has also

SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY HAS RE-
CENTLY 
BEEN 
DECLARED 
A 
CORONAVIRUS HOTSPOT 
(Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, the 
COVID–19 pandemic continues to take 
its toll on communities throughout the 
country, and my region is one of the 
latest to be declared a hotspot. 
In San Joaquin County, more than 
10,000 have been diagnosed and 110 have 
lost their lives to this disease. Our hos-
pitals have less than 14 percent avail-
ability in the ICUs, and my district, 
like many others, is in dire need of as-
sistance. 
Mr. Speaker, over 2 months ago, the 
House of Representatives passed the 
HEROES Act, but this critical legisla-
tion is still sitting in the Senate ma-
jority leader’s desk being ignored by 
Senate Republicans. This week, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL announced his alter-
native to the HEROES Act, which falls 
way short, leaving individuals, cities, 
and States without the resources they 
need to survive this crisis. 
My 
district 
deserves 
better, 
the 
American people deserve better, and 
the House Democrats have offered bet-
ter. It is time for the Republican-con-
trolled Senate to join us and meet this 
challenge head-on. 
f 
RECOGNIZING SHIRLEY LOVE 
(Mrs. MILLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize my friend and 
former colleague Mr. Shirley Love, 
who passed away on July 17, 2020. 
Born in May 1933 to Earl and Winona 
Love, Shirley was named after the pop-
ular West Virginia newspaper col-
umnist, 
Shirley 
Donnelly. 
Unbe-
knownst at the time, he was also des-
tined for media greatness. 
For 45 years, Shirley worked at 
WOAY-TV station entertaining and in-
forming many. He is known for becom-
ing one of southern West Virginia’s 
first nightly TV news anchors, and 
with his terrific voice, Shirley was a 
welcomed radio presence in households 
throughout 
the 
region, 
ultimately 
landing him in the West Virginia 
Broadcasting Hall of Fame. 
After retiring from WOAY, he self-
lessly represented Fayette County in 
the State legislature for 16 years. Ap-
pointed by Governor Caperton to the 
senate, Shirley eventually moved to 
the house of delegates, where I had the 
honor to work alongside him. 
Shirley constantly lived up to his 
reputation of integrity and honesty. He 
will always be remembered by his fam-
ily, friends, and countless people he im-
pacted throughout his life. 
I send my sincerest condolences to 
his wife, Audrey, his children, and his 
grandchildren. 
May God bless Shirley Love. 
f 
HONORING UTAH HEALTHCARE 
WORKERS 
(Mr. MCADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, in 
March, I was infected with COVID–19 
and spent 8 days in the hospital strug-
gling to breathe and too exhausted to 
get out of bed. The dedicated doctors, 
nurses, and hospital staff were my al-
lies in the fight against the virus, put-
ting their own health at risk to care 
for me. It gave me an up-close and per-
sonal 
perspective 
of 
what 
our 
healthcare 
workers 
have 
been 
up 
against since the start of this pan-
demic. 
So dedicated are Utah’s healthcare 
heroes that, when the call went out 
from New York for help, 100 volunteers 
responded, giving the exhausted doc-
tors, nurses, and respiratory therapists 
much-needed backup. They spent 14 
days assisting New York area hos-
pitals, working day and night to care 
for desperately sick people, people who 
were not even allowed to have family 
members at their bedside. 
Utah healthcare heroes are not just 
found at hospitals; they are in our 
long-term care facilities, our veterans’ 
homes, and in parking lots, standing in 
the heat to collect test samples for 
hours at a time. They are found in 
blood banks and laboratories, search-
ing for the treatments and working on 
drug trials to offer relief and hope to 
patients now and in the future. 
No summer vacations or even holiday 
weekends for these extraordinary care-
givers, their own families must take a 
backseat. The fight against the virus 
and the demand on their skill con-
tinues for the months ahead. 
They gave me my health back and re-
turned me safely to loved ones. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank them for their help. 
f 
REMEMBERING CATHY MARCHEL 
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember one of 
Texas’ finest servants, Cathy Marchel. 
Cathy went home to be with the Lord 
in January after serving our Cleburne 
community for almost two decades 
with strength, grace, and unmatched 
character. She took all of the gifts she 
possessed and used them in powerful 
ways to improve her world and those 
around her. 
She radiated joy with her beaming 
smile and gracious attitude. She was a 
leader and a fighter and someone we all 
looked up to for guidance. No one 
worked harder for their constituents 
than she did, and her impact will be 
felt for decades to come. 
Our community has lost a selfless, 
devoted servant, and many of us have 
lost a dear friend. There is most cer-
tainly a void in her absence, but we 
find hope in the promise that she is 
now with our savior, and we look for-
ward to the day when we all will be re-
united. 
May God bless the entire Cleburne 
community and the Marchel family. 
In God we trust.

OUR NATION STILL LACKS A 
NATIONAL TESTING STRATEGY 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, we are half-
way through this year and 6 months 
into this pandemic, and our Nation 
still lacks a national testing strategy. 
The President claimed that he was a 
wartime President, but with 150,000 
Americans dead, this administration 
has not given this the wartime serious-
ness it deserves. 
The administration must get serious 
about this virus. Invoke our full powers 
through the Defense Production Act 
and urge the Senate to pass the testing 
resources the House has made available 
in the HEROES Act. Protect American 
citizens across this Nation. 
Our Nation needs a national strat-
egy. It needs results, not long waiting 
times making it impossible to manage 
and mitigate the pandemic. In my dis-
trict alone, people are waiting for 10 
days or more to receive their results. 
That is simply unacceptable. And while 
they wait, they may be going out, put-
ting others at risk. 
Mr. Speaker, it is dangerously irre-
sponsible to have such inadequate test-
ing in the United States of America, 
where our resources are so vast. I urge 
this administration to summon our 
vast resources and the courage to com-
mand a national testing strategy.

THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
ERADI-
CATING 
THE 
SPOTTED 
LANTERNFLY IN PENNSYLVANIA 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stress the 
importance of researching, combating, 
and eradicating the spotted lanternfly. 
This invasive pest is native to China, 
Bangladesh, and Vietnam, but has been 
wreaking havoc in Pennsylvania since 
2014. 
The spotted lanternfly is a relentless 
menace that continues to harm Penn-
sylvania’s agricultural sector, dam-
aging trees, and destroying crop yields. 
These insects lay egg masses on trees, 
causing oozing sap, mold growth, and 
more.

While the spotted lanternfly is harm-
less to humans, it can seriously impact 
our surroundings. The Pennsylvania 
Department of Agriculture estimates 
the potential damage in lost revenue 
from 
the 
spotted 
lanternfly 
could 
amount to $18 billion per year, state-
wide. 
I have been pleased to work with my 
colleague, Congresswoman HOULAHAN, 
to stress the importance of ridding the 
Commonwealth of this pest. It will 
take continued support to eradicate 
the spotted lanternfly and prevent fur-
ther harm to our environment and 
economy. 
I would like to encourage any Penn-
sylvanian who encounters a spotted 
lanternfly to get rid of it and to report 
an infestation to the Pennsylvania De-
partment of Agriculture.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF FRED 
CERULLO, JR. 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the legacy of Fred 
Cerullo, Jr., a family man, a business 
owner, and a fellow Army vet. 
For more than 40 years, Mr. Cerullo 
welcomed friends and neighbors to 
Owl’s Head Service Center, the busi-
ness his father established in Bay 
Ridge in 1956. He treated everyone who 
stopped by this neighborhood landmark 
as if they were family, so much so that 
even those who did not own a car would 
stop by to visit Fred. 
After serving in the Army at Fort 
Dix, Fred passed his devotion on to his 
children, to include his son, Fred, my 
dear friend, who served New York City 
as a four-term city councilman and in 
several other roles in city government. 
Today, my heart goes out to Fred 
Cerullo’s family and to everyone whom 
he touched in such a wonderful way. 
May he rest in peace. We will never for-
get Fred’s incredible legacy.

HONORING FRANCES COLEMAN 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize retiring Mississippi 
State University Dean of Libraries, 
Frances Coleman, for her outstanding 
contributions to Mississippi’s higher 
education and to the Starkville com-
munity. Over the course of her career, 
Dean Coleman championed unprece-
dented expansions of facilities, tech-
nologies, and programming throughout 
the MSU library system. She was in-
strumental in the transfer of the Ulys-
ses S. Grant collection to Mississippi 
State’s Mitchell Memorial Library, 
which established the university as one 
of only six campuses to hold a Presi-
dential library. 
Dean Coleman has received numerous 
recognitions for her service to our 
State, including the G.V. ‘‘Sonny’’ 
Montgomery Excellence in Leadership 
Award, and the lifetime achievement 
honor bestowed by the Mississippi leg-
islature. 
In 
addition 
to 
her 
professional 
achievements, she is also active in her 
community through the Rotary Club, 
the Starkville Chamber of Commerce, 
and the Aldersgate United Methodist 
Church. 
Please join me in recognizing Dean 
Frances Coleman for her significant 
contributions to the great State of 
Mississippi.

WISHING 
GARRY 
AND 
JACKIE 
SMALL A HAPPY 65TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
wish a happy 65th anniversary to Garry 
and Jackie Small of Chico. The couple 
wed in 1955 after meeting as students 
at Chico State University, but that is 
not where the close ties to the univer-
sity stop. 
Garry was a lifelong administrator, 
with titles ranging from director of 
plant operations to associate vice 
president for administration. Jackie 
worked at the bookstore working her 
way up, and eventually retiring from 
the Meriam Library on campus. 
The Smalls have three daughters, 
Kari, 
Julie, 
and 
Lynn, 
and 
two 
grandsons, Keaton and Tyler. 
Mr. Speaker, again I congratulate 
Garry and Jackie on 65 years and send 
them my best wishes and blessings for 
many years to come.

REMEMBERING ANDY QUINNEY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
my friend, Andy Eugene Quinney, of 
Georgia’s First Congressional District 
who passed away at the age of 64. 
Mr. Quinney was born in Savannah, 
Georgia, and graduated from Robert W. 
Groves High School. 
Andy was a dedicated insurance 
agent, serving Chatham County and 
the Lowcountry of South Carolina for 
over 4 decades, most recently working 
with Jimmy Swain of James M. Swain 
& Associates. 
Andy took his leadership skills to 
new heights when he was the mayor of 
Garden City, Georgia, from 2002 to 2009. 
One of his goals as mayor was to ‘‘put 
the garden back in Garden City,’’ and 
that he did. He was blessed with a 
green thumb and could bring any plant 
or city back to life. 
Garden City thrived thanks to his de-
vout leadership and commitment to 
improving the lives of its citizens. 
Andy was pivotal in making it the suc-
cess it is today. 
Andy was a pillar for the Masonic 
Lodge through his service as Worship-
ful Master and was one of the founders 
of the Band of Brothers. 
Andy loved music, reading, and gar-
dening, and he used all those gifts he 
was given for God’s glory. 
Everyone 
who 
encountered 
him 
would be met with an infectious smile, 
and it was evident that the joy of the 
Lord was his strength. 
My thoughts and prayers will con-
tinue to be with my brother in Christ’s 
friends and family during this most dif-
ficult time.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for

tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-

ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN: Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 1067, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 
7617, the Defense, Commerce, Justice, 
Science, Energy and Water Develop-
ment, Financial Services and General 
Government, 
Homeland 
Security, 
Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, 
Transportation, 
Housing 
and Urban Development Appropria-
tions Act of 2021. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.R. 7617 under a structured rule, with 
90 minutes of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on Appropriations. It self-executes a 
manager’s 
amendment 
from 
Chair-
woman LOWEY. It makes in order 340 
amendments and provides that the 
chair of the Committee on Appropria-
tions or her designee may offer amend-
ments en bloc, which will be debatable 
for 30 minutes. Finally, the rule pro-
vides one motion to recommit with or 
without instructions. 
Mr. Speaker, the measure before us is 
what it looks like when you don’t take 
an ax to our priorities, as the President 
has advocated, but instead, you invest 
in what is important to the American 
people. This is what it looks like when 
we actually lay the groundwork for a 
real recovery from the coronavirus 
pandemic, instead of just wishing it 
away as this President has done. 
There are billions and billions of dol-
lars in emergency funding here to build 
and repair water projects, to modernize 
energy infrastructure, and rebuild our 
Nation’s crumbling infrastructure in 
this time of COVID–19. These projects 
will help get Americans back to work 
and kick-start our economy. 
The bills included in this underlying 
package also make long-term invest-
ments in our Nation: In food safety, 
curbing tobacco use, and combating do-
mestic abuse and sexual assault; all at 
levels that exceed the President’s budg-
et request. 
There is also landmark grant funding 
to carry out police reform efforts, and, 
yes, even funding to address the health 
impacts of climate change because, Mr. 
Speaker, this majority believes in 
science, and we believe in facts. 
This bill also includes provisions to 
stop costly, endless wars by sunsetting 
the 2001 Authorization for the Use of 
Military Force, the AUMF, repealing 
the 2002 AUMF, and prohibiting funds 
for the use of force against Iran. 
Just as important as what this meas-
ure does is what it ensures this admin-
istration cannot do: Like steal money 
for President Trump’s ineffective bor-
der wall, implement its dangerous plan 
to restart explosive nuclear testing, or 
launch another endless war using the 
2001 AUMF. 
This is about addressing our Nation’s 
emergency needs during this pandemic 
today, while building a strong founda-
tion for the future. 
Thinking that this pandemic will 
magically vanish, as this President has 
suggested, is not a plan. Hoping that 
COVID–19 just goes away without a 
vaccine, as this President has done, is 
not a plan. 
Real resources like those in this bill, 
especially when taken with those in 
the HEROES Act that passed this 
House over 2 months ago, will enable 
us to confront this virus and build a 
true recovery. 
340 amendments were made in order 
under this rule, many of which will 
make this bill even stronger. 
Among them is an amendment I au-
thored to provide more money for 
radon testing and mitigation. A na-
tional investigation recently uncov-
ered this harmful chemical in public 
housing units across the country, in-
cluding in my hometown of Worcester, 
Massachusetts. 
This administration, and HUD in par-
ticular, has an obligation to act. This 
language will help ensure more funding 
is there to help protect people’s health 
and safety. 
I am also proud that the underlying 
bill sets aside $10 million to create a 
new nationwide pilot program to help 
the many grandparents who are raising 
their grandchildren today. This fund-
ing will provide more access to safe, af-
fordable, and appropriate housing. 
Mr. Speaker, there are two policy 
ideas put forward during this process 
that I especially want to highlight. 
The first was an effort led by my 
good friend, Congressman BOBBY RUSH, 
to create a more 21st century approach 
toward Cuba. This President has taken 
us back to a failed Cold War policy 
that held our country back for more 
than 50 years, a policy that hurts the 
Cuban people, and a policy that denies 
American farmers and American busi-
nesses the opportunity to engage with 
their counterparts in Cuba. In short, 
our policy, Mr. Speaker, is an embar-
rassment. 
The gentleman from Illinois wanted 
to mitigate some of the pain U.S. poli-
cies impose on the Cuban people by 
providing easier access to food and 
medicine and by making it easier for 
families in the United States to send 
support to their relatives still on the 
island, especially during this pan-
demic. 
Now, although the gentleman from 
Illinois has withdrawn his amend-
ments, I want to recognize him for his 
leadership. He has shined a bright light 
on a failed policy that badly hurts the 
Cuban people, and it urgently needs to 
change. 
Mr. Speaker, we have to change our 
policy. We must and we will change our 
policy, and I look forward to being part 
of that effort. If we can trade with 
China and Russia and Vietnam, we cer-
tainly can trade with Cuba. If Ameri-
cans can travel virtually to any coun-
try in the world, we ought to be able to 
travel to Cuba without restriction. And 
if we really care about human rights 
and human suffering, then we ought to 
recognize that the American blockade 
on Cuba is causing tremendous suf-
fering to the Cuban people. 
b 1030 
So I hope, Mr. Speaker, that we will 
in short order take a fresh look at our 
policy and move to a more mature, sen-
sible, thoughtful approach to dealing 
with Cuba.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3892 
July 29, 2020 
I thank my colleague from Massachu-
setts, 
Representative 
AYANNA 
PRESSLEY, along with Representatives 
LEE, OCASIO-CORTEZ, SCHAKOWSKY, CHU, 
DEGETTE, TLAIB, OMAR, POCAN, and 
SPEIER. 
Together they led an important ef-
fort to repeal the Hyde Amendment. 
This disastrous policy prevents so 
many, particularly low-income women 
and women of color from deciding their 
own future. 
Constitutional rights should not be-
long to just the wealthy or the privi-
leged. They belong to every single 
American, regardless of where they get 
their health insurance. 
And although this amendment wasn’t 
able to be made in order here because 
of several budgetary points of order, I 
want to say loud and clear here today 
that they are right. We need to end 
this discriminatory policy, and I look 
forward to working with them to do 
just that. This is a fight that we must 
have. 
Mr. Speaker, getting this broad pack-
age here today was a herculean effort 
by so many in this Chamber, and I urge 
all of my colleagues to support this 
rule and the underlying measure. Let’s 
get our communities the resources 
they need, and let’s get our economy 
back on its feet. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend, the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts, the distinguished chairman 
of the Rules Committee, for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes, and, Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s debate is on a 
rule providing for consideration of H.R. 
7617, which contains 6 of the 12 annual 
appropriations bills recently reported 
by the House Appropriations Com-
mittee. These six bills include the two 
largest, Defense, and Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, as well as 
the titles covering Commerce, Justice, 
Science, Energy and Water Develop-
ment, Financial Services and General 
Government, and finally, Transpor-
tation, Housing, and Urban Develop-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Ap-
propriations Committee, it is always 
encouraging to see the appropriations 
process moving forward. Passing these 
12 bills is one of the biggest respon-
sibilities we have as Members of Con-
gress; to fund the government and keep 
it open and operating for our constitu-
ents. 
Despite that great responsibility, I 
am disappointed by the partisan ap-
proach taken by the majority in 
crafting the bills in this package, and I 
cannot support them at this time. 
I single out the majority in my com-
ments because the 12 bills that were re-
ported out of committee this year were 
all written to satisfy the concerns and 
wishes of one party, the Democratic 
party. While that is often how the ap-
propriations process begins, it is ulti-
mately never where it ends. At the end 
of the day, for us to pass 12 full-year 
fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills, in 
an era of divided government, it will 
require Members on both sides of the 
aisle and in both Chambers of Congress 
to reach consensus. That ultimately 
means that the partisan bills like those 
we are considering today are non-
starters and cannot become law. 
During markup on these measures in 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
and 
again yesterday in the Rules Com-
mittee, Republicans rightfully raised 
several reasons why these bills cannot 
become law and should not pass the 
House. Those objections were ignored. 
Consequently, today’s bill will have 
very little, if any, Republican support. 
That means these bills are effectively 
dead on arrival in the United States 
Senate and would never be signed by a 
Republican President, and there are a 
lot of reasons for that. 
First, all 12 appropriations bills are 
marked at 302(b) allocation numbers 
that violate the fiscal year 2021 total 
spending limit negotiated in the cur-
rent budget agreement just last year. 
b 1030 
Indeed, I remind my friends, Congress 
is lawfully bound to uphold that agree-
ment. 
Instead of abiding by the negotiated 
numbers that were agreed to in both 
Houses of Congress by both parties and 
by the President, the majority has used 
a 
huge 
amount 
of 
emergency-des-
ignated funds as a workaround scheme 
to break that good faith budget agree-
ment. 
In this bill alone, there is well over 
$200 billion in so-called emergency 
spending. That violates the budget 
agreement. This will make it much 
more difficult to negotiate final bills 
with the Senate that can actually be-
come law. 
But what is more disappointing than 
the widespread use of budget gimmicks 
is the prolific use of partisan policy 
riders throughout the appropriations 
bills, including these six. These riders 
are simply unacceptable, and they 
must come out before bipartisan agree-
ment can be reached. 
Consider the bill that I am most fa-
miliar with, which came out of the 
Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee, where I am the ranking 
member. The text of that bill includes 
a wide variety of harmful riders. 
In the first instance, the bill includes 
partisan policy prescriptions that will 
tie the hands of the administration 
with respect to Title X family plan-
ning. Most notably, the riders would 
force the administration to resume 
grants awarded to controversial groups 
that 
provide 
abortions, 
such 
as 
Planned Parenthood, and it would pre-
vent the administration from granting 
waivers that protect deeply held reli-
gious beliefs of institutions, organiza-
tions, and individuals that provide 
vital services funded in the bill. 
The Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices title includes riders that would 
undo the Department of Labor’s rule 
clarifying the so-called joint employer 
standard. If this policy rider were en-
acted, it would cause chaos for thou-
sands of businesses and millions of em-
ployees, leaving them uncertain about 
the nature of their employment rela-
tionship. 
Not to be outdone, the bill also in-
cludes riders micromanaging and sec-
ond-guessing how Health and Human 
Services administers the Unaccom-
panied Alien Children Program, which 
will ensure that the individuals devot-
ing their energies to assisting such un-
accompanied minors will find them-
selves devoting their energy, becoming 
wrapped up in evermore deeply and 
congressionally mandated red tape. 
The same can be said for the other di-
visions in this package. Throughout 
this minibus, the majority has inserted 
policy riders that tie the hands of the 
administration. 
They have limited the ability of the 
administration 
to 
reprogram 
funds 
even when necessary. They have in-
serted rider after rider aimed at pre-
venting the President from spending 
money on barriers and security meas-
ures at the southern border. And they 
have removed countless bipartisan pol-
icy revisions that have been routinely 
carried in previous years’ bills. 
Let me say it again: Partisan riders 
like these must come out before a bi-
partisan agreement can be reached. 
On top of this, while I understand we 
are living through unprecedented times 
and have had to rightly limit our phys-
ical interactions, I have serious con-
cerns about considering these bills in a 
six-division, 
trillion-dollar 
spending 
bill. 
Debating these measures together as 
one shuts out the ability of most rank- 
and-file Members to have their ideas 
heard on the floor, or limits them to 
having their amendments included in 
massive all-or-nothing en bloc pack-
ages, and places many Members in an 
untenable all-or-nothing vote on both 
the en bloc packages and ultimately 
final passage of the bill. 
We can do better than that, Mr. 
Speaker, and we must do better than 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I am still hopeful that 
we can reach a bipartisan appropria-
tions deal for the full year. If we can 
get the prolific emergency spending 
and budget gimmicks out of these bills, 
and if we can eliminate all partisan 
policy riders, then I think the majority 
in the House will have a workable 
starting point to begin negotiations 
with the Senate toward a bipartisan 
deal. 
Under 
such 
circumstances, 
they 
would still not be the bills I would have 
written, but they would be a reason-
able basis on which to begin negotia-
tions. But until then, these bills are 
going absolutely nowhere. They will 
not pass the Senate, and they will not 
be signed by the President into law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3893 
July 29, 2020 
Frankly, I do not believe they should 
be passed by this House, either. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule and the underlying legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I appreciate the gentleman’s com-
ments. And I acknowledge, I think we 
all acknowledge, that we are living in 
an unusual moment, dealing with a 
health pandemic that has already 
claimed the lives of 150,000 of our fellow 
citizens, that has infected millions of 
our other fellow citizens, and we are 
trying to do our best to operate and to 
get the people’s business done amidst 
this pandemic. 
So, we have given committee chairs 
en bloc authority to try to consider 
amendments en bloc so we can consider 
more ideas. 
In the package that we are bringing 
before the House today, there are 341 
amendments in order. Some of them 
will require separate votes on amend-
ments because, quite frankly, there 
isn’t a consensus on some of them. But 
many of them are good ideas that can 
be put in an en bloc amendment and be 
incorporated into this bill. 
I just say that because the alter-
native in the middle of this pandemic 
is to have fewer amendments, and I 
don’t think that that is something that 
Members would want to see happen. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
MATSUI), a distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee. 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the rule for H.R. 
7617, the second appropriations pack-
age. 
The funding included in this bill will 
advance crucial priorities like in-
creased broadband access, advancing 
medical research, and supporting po-
lice reform. These investments are nec-
essary as we continue to combat the 
spread of COVID–19 and encourage eco-
nomic recovery. 
By providing $61 billion in emergency 
funding to the FCC, we can expand 
internet access to unserved and under-
served households. As schools continue 
to adjust to distance learning, I believe 
every student, regardless of their fam-
ily’s ZIP Code or income bracket, de-
serves a reliable internet connection to 
participate in the modern classroom. 
The rule also provides consideration 
of my amendment to advance break-
throughs 
in 
medical 
research. 
My 
amendment directs an additional $4.5 
million to DOD’s Congressionally Di-
rected Medical Research Program. This 
program funds high-impact projects, 
including medical research for rare dis-
eases like bone marrow failure. 
Some of you remember we lost my 
late husband, Bob Matsui, to MDS, a 
bone marrow failure disease. Countless 
other families across the country rely 
on the Defense program’s work to dis-
cover and develop new therapies and 
cures, especially for rare diseases. 
I am also very glad that this program 
dedicates $400 million in grant funding 
to help implement needed police re-
form. This includes pattern and prac-
tice analyses and independent inves-
tigations of law enforcement depart-
ments across the country. 
While there is still much work to be 
done, this funding will move us closer 
to an America where all are treated 
equally under the law. 
This is a strong comprehensive bill, 
and I look forward to supporting it on 
the floor soon. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume to re-
spond quickly to my friend. 
While we appreciate the number of 
amendments made in order, let’s just 
look at the statistics. Twenty percent 
of all the amendments in this bill are 
Republican, 60 percent are Democrat, 
20 percent are bipartisan. 
Frankly, I am pleased to have hit 20 
percent, because for the year, we are 
down at about 17 percent of the amend-
ments. 
So while we appreciate the difficult 
conditions, I also remind my friend 
that in the last Congress, when we held 
the majority, they actually always had 
more amendments than the Repub-
licans did. So let’s not get carried away 
with the difficulties of the situation or 
the fairness of the process. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS), my good friend, 
a distinguished Member, and an out-
standing member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for yielding me the time. 
We should at least comply with the 
law. I would think that a law-writing 
body, Congress, and the Appropriations 
Committee should at least follow the 
law. 
Well, again, this rule doesn’t do that, 
and this bill doesn’t do that. Let me 
explain what I am talking about. 
Spent nuclear fuel and defense waste 
is at 121 sites in 39 States across this 
country. The DOE, Department of En-
ergy, was supposed to take title to this 
spent fuel and this defense waste in 
1998. 
Appropriators will like to hear this 
number. We spend unbudgeted out of 
the Judgment Fund $2.2 million every 
day—$2.2 
million 
unbudgeted—unap-
propriated through legal action be-
cause we are not complying with the 
law. 
b 1045 
The Nuclear Waste Fund currently is 
booked as having $40 billion in it, Mr. 
Speaker, and that $40 billion comes 
from ratepayers, not even Federal 
money. It is people whose States have 
nuclear power. They pay into this fund 
to find a safe disposal site. 
Over the past 30 years, $15 billion has 
been spent. I brought examples of that 
$15 billion. Mr. Speaker, this is one box 
of five of the Department of Energy’s 
scientific analysis of the safety of 
Yucca Mountain, the long-term reposi-
tory. They finished that, and then they 
turned over all of their science. 
Let me tell you who was part of this 
billions of dollars of research by eight 
national labs, which comes through 
this appropriation bill. Eight labs, the 
U.S. Geological Survey, and many uni-
versities helped do this research. Then, 
they sent this research to our inde-
pendent nuclear safety agency called 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
and they issued a five-volume report. 
This is the fifth volume of that, 
which says: Using Yucca Mountain as a 
long-term geological repository would 
be safe for a million years, not 10,000 
years, not 100,000 years, not 500,000 
years, a million years. 
Now, who did this research? Well, 
you had experts in geochemistry, hy-
drology, climatology, structural geol-
ogy, 
volcanology, 
seismology, 
and 
health physics, as well as chemical, ci-
vilian, mechanical, nuclear, mining 
materials, and geological engineering. 
If we want to use science, want to 
talk about science, science from the 
Department of Energy, science re-
viewed by the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission says Yucca Mountain will 
be safe for a million years for long- 
term storage of not just spent fuel but 
also of our defense waste. 
So, what happens when we legally 
block the final portion of the law? And 
the final portion would be: Let’s get 
money to allow Nevada to argue the 
science. That is what they always say: 
Let’s argue the science. Well, this bill, 
like other bills coming out of the Ap-
propriations 
Committee, 
has 
zero 
money to debate the science and do the 
adjudication. 
So if it had money, and this is part of 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, if 
the adjudication were to resume, one 
or more boards would hear evidence 
and issue decisions on approximately 
300 admitted issues contesting DOE’s 
application or the NRC’s staff decision 
to adopt the DOE environmental im-
pact statement. 
If we would finish the last portion of 
this debate and have the—it is actually 
called the Atomic Safety and Licensing 
Board Panel. They would look at the 
science. They would hear Nevada’s 
complaints, and they would render 
judgment. That is why we go to courts 
and stuff to resolve conflict. 
If they don’t like that decision, Ne-
vada can appeal the Board’s decision to 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If 
they don’t like the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission’s final decision, they can 
go to the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
Now, let’s address a few things about 
the State of Nevada. I include in the 
RECORD
Nye County Resolution No. 
2020–11, which passed this year. I will 
read a few portions of it. The title is: 
‘‘A Resolution of the Nye County Board 
of County Commissioners Supporting 
the Efforts to Complete the Yucca 
Mountain Licensing Process and Re-
solve the Nuclear Waste Issue.’’ 
Here is one of the whereases. ‘‘Where-
as, almost 1,000 nuclear devices were 
detonated on the Nevada test site.’’

‘‘Whereas, Nye County and eight 
other Nevada counties have passed res-
olutions supporting the completion of 
the Yucca Mountain licensing process 
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
to determine if Yucca Mountain is 
safe.’’ 
So, that is nine Nevada counties that 
say we should move forward. 
‘‘Now, therefore, be it resolved that 
the Nye County Board of Commis-
sioners does hereby continue to sup-
port the efforts to complete the Yucca 
Mountain licensing process and resolve 
the nuclear waste issue.’’ 
So, that is Nye County, which has 
the site of Yucca Mountain. 
NYE COUNTY RESOLUTION NO. 2020–11 
A RESOLUTION OF THE NYE COUNTY BOARD OF 
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS SUPPORTING THE EF-
FORTS
TO
COMPLETE
THE
YUCCA
MOUNTAIN 
LICENSING
PROCESS
AND
RESOLVE
THE
NU-
CLEAR WASTE ISSUE 
Whereas, Nye County Nevada is the third 
largest county in the continental United 
States comprising over 11 million acres; and 
Whereas, almost 98 percent of this land is 
under either management or control of var-
ious agencies of the federal government; and 
Whereas, Department of Defense and De-
partment of Energy have withdrawn approxi-
mately 4 million acres from public access 
and restricted this land to defense, nuclear 
and other related government uses; and 
Whereas, almost 1000 nuclear devices were 
detonated on the Nevada Test Site; and 
Whereas, the 1987 Nuclear Waste Policy 
Act amendment selected Yucca Mountain as 
the single site to be studied, and in 2002 Con-
gress approved the site for development of a 
repository; and 
Whereas, Nuclear energy is needed to inte-
grate with renewable energy to significantly 
reduce CO2 emissions; and 
Whereas, the United States has over 80,000 
tons of Spent Nuclear Fuel and large quan-
tities of High-Level Waste and other radio-
active waste that will require isolation in 
geologic repositories; and 
Whereas, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act di-
rects the Department of Energy to pursue a 
licensing proceeding to determine if Yucca 
Mountain is a safe site to house a repository 
for Spent Fuel and High-Level nuclear waste; 
and 
Whereas, the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion is directed by the Nuclear Waste Policy 
Act to adjudicate if Yucca Mountain is safe 
to house a nuclear waste repository; and 
Whereas, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act has 
never been repealed and remains the law of 
the land; and 
Whereas, this waste is currently located in 
temporary storage facilities at over 100 sites 
in 39 states; and 
Whereas, reprocessing of spent fuel and 
fast reactors have the potential to reduce 
the amount of waste generated in the future, 
there will always be large quantities of ra-
dioactive waste for geologic disposal; and 
Whereas, Nye County and 8 other Nevada 
counties have passed resolutions supporting 
the completion of the Yucca Mountain li-
censing process by the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission to determine if Yucca Mountain 
is safe; and 
Whereas, the Nye County Board of County 
Commissioners have approved multiple reso-
lutions and letters to the federal government 
asking for negotiations with Nye County and 
the State of Nevada to identify a package 
that includes mitigation and benefits for Ne-
vada residents; and 
Whereas, the federal government has made 
no serious efforts to negotiate with State 
and local leaders or offer benefits to resi-
dents of Nevada; and now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Nye County Board of 
Commissioners does hereby continue to sup-
port the efforts to complete the Yucca Moun-
tain licensing process and resolve the nu-
clear waste issue; and be it further 
Resolved, That as part of that effort, Nye 
County supports the use of innovative tech-
nologies to minimize the amount of nuclear 
waste. The research and investments for 
these technologies should be done in Nevada 
creating jobs and enhancing Nevada’s Uni-
versities; and be it further 
Resolved, That pursuant to the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act, Nye County encourages 
the Trump Administration and Congress to 
develop a benefit package that offers jobs, 
educational benefits and with potential rev-
enue for services to residents and visitors of 
Nye County and the State of Nevada. 
Passed, Adopted, and Approved the 7th day 
of April, 2020. 
Ayes: Koenig, Strickland, Wichman, Cox, 
Blundo. 
Absent: None. 
Nayes: None. 
Nye County Board of County Commis-
sioners: John Koenig, Chairman. 
Attest: Kelly Sidman; Sandra L. Merlino, 
Nye County Clerk, and Ex-Officio Clerk of 
the Board. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, what if 
we don’t do this? Here is a chart. Here 
is Yucca Mountain, secure, in the 
desert, underneath a mountain, 90 
miles from Las Vegas. 
Right here in this Chamber, we are 44 
miles from the nearest nuclear power 
plant. It just happens to be Calvert 
Cliffs. It is on the Chesapeake Bay, and 
so it is close. 
The State of Nevada will argue it will 
hurt our tourism. Well, let me tell you, 
Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York 
City have more tourists than Las 
Vegas and are closer to spent nuclear 
fuel than any other place. 
Again, it is a travesty that we spend 
$2.2 million every day for not com-
plying with the law. This bill does not 
help us comply with the law. In fact, I 
would say this bill breaks the law, 
which is another example for the great 
American public to observe how dys-
functional we are in this day and age in 
the people’s House. It saddens me. 
I thank my colleague for yielding me 
the time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just to respond to my 
good friend, Mr. COLE, who I have 
great, great admiration for, but the 
gentleman said that more Democratic 
amendments were made in order. Well, 
let’s kind of put that into context. 
More Democratic amendments were 
submitted, period. Actually, more than 
half of the amendments were Demo-
cratic. 
Let me put it this way: Twice as 
many Democratic amendments were 
offered as Republican amendments, and 
there was a big chunk of bipartisan 
amendments that were made in order. 
I don’t like to compare our record to 
their record because the gentleman 
wasn’t chair of the Rules Committee 
when the Republicans were in charge. 
But I just want to throw this little tid-
bit out there so that people can have 
this: We have made in order 25 percent 
more amendments this month than 
were made in order in all of 2018 under 
the Republican control of the House. 
Again, I know my friend wasn’t the 
chair at the time, but I just wanted to 
point that out for the RECORD because 
I think it is a nice statistic. 
Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MCADAMS). 
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of my amend-
ments to H.R. 7617. My amendment 
would provide additional resources to 
the National Suicide Prevention Life-
line. The CDC reports that from 2001 to 
2017, the Nation saw a 31 percent in-
crease in the suicide rate. It is now the 
second leading cause of death among 
Americans ages 15 to 24 and the leading 
cause of death for Utahns in this age 
group. 
The lifeline is a nationally accessible 
service that supports people in crisis 
and connects them to the help that 
they need. The lifeline has had great 
success, but it is also under strain as 
its funding has not kept pace with its 
caseload, 
particularly 
amid 
the 
pandemic’s effects. 
I want my amendment to speak 
clearly to Americans in crisis: There is 
help; there is hope; and we are fighting 
for you. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today also in sup-
port of two amendments to protect 
children’s safety and well-being. 
First, the National Center for Miss-
ing & Exploited Children has reported 
staggering increases in online child sex 
abuse material, commonly called child 
pornography. 
The 
Federal 
Internet 
Crimes Against Children Task Force 
Program supports task forces in every 
State to investigate such online exploi-
tation and abuse of children and bring 
perpetrators to justice. My amendment 
enhances this grant program to sup-
port State and locally driven efforts to 
protect our children. 
Second, child advocacy centers are 
an incredible tool to support child sur-
vivors of abuse. These centers bring to-
gether specialized child welfare and 
law enforcement professionals to pro-
vide holistic services to children and to 
seek justice against abusers. COVID–19 
has put many kids at risk, and my 
amendment 
provides 
additional 
re-
sources for centers to meet this de-
mand. 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
amendments to protect, heal, and give 
hope to Americans. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately bring 
up S. 939, the CONFUCIUS Act, which 
passed the Senate by unanimous con-
sent a month and a half ago. 
If enacted into law, S. 939 will ad-
dress China’s influence on American

July 29, 2020 
colleges and universities through Con-
fucius Institutes, which are cultural in-
stitutes directly or indirectly funded 
by the Chinese Government. 
Specifically, colleges and universities 
receiving Federal funds will be re-
quired to certify that the institution 
ensures that any contract or agree-
ment between the institution and a 
Confucius Institute includes clear pro-
visions that protect academic freedom 
at the institution, prohibits the appli-
cation of any foreign law, and ensures 
the institution retains full managerial 
authority over the Confucius Institute. 
Mr. Speaker, in recent years, Confu-
cius Institutes have become common-
place among higher-education cam-
puses. While ostensibly high-minded, 
these organizations are funded by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China and focus on a Beijing-approved 
view of Chinese history. They are noted 
for 
presenting 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
propaganda, 
ignoring 
human 
rights abuses in Tibet and among the 
Uighurs, and insisting that Taiwan be-
longs to mainland China. 
What is worse, Chinese influence on 
American campuses comes at a time in 
which China is engaged in ongoing ef-
forts to steal American intellectual 
property and research, particularly in 
research institutions like those located 
on our higher education campuses. 
It is inarguable that Chinese espio-
nage efforts like these pose a clear 
threat to national security. Passage of 
the CONFUCIUS Act would help close 
an open loophole on our college cam-
puses currently being exploited by the 
People’s Republic of China. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me remind my colleagues what 
the previous question vote is all about. 
It really isn’t about substance. It is 
about turning control of the House 
over to my friends on the Republican 
side. 
As the chair of the Congressional-Ex-
ecutive Commission on China who is 
very, very concerned about these Con-
fucius Institutes and about China’s 
continuing 
escalation 
of 
activities 
within our country, I am happy to sit 
down with the gentleman and anyone 
else to try to bring legislation to the 
floor. 
We brought a lot of legislation to the 
floor to check China’s growing power 
in the world. But this is really not 
about the Confucius Institute. This is 
about turning power over to my friends 
on the other side of the aisle. 
If they were to succeed, they could 
bring up whatever they want to within 
the rules of the House. And based on 
some of the statements in recent weeks 
by some of my friends on the other side 
of the aisle about some of their prior-
ities, it could be some pretty, in my 
opinion, awful stuff. 
So, I would urge my colleagues to re-
ject the gentleman’s plea here. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to support pas-
sage of the House’s second package of 
appropriations bill for fiscal year 2021 
as a proud member of the Appropria-
tions Committee and chair of an appro-
priations subcommittee. 
The defense division of the bill will 
safeguard our national security and 
give our troops a much-needed pay 
raise. 
I appreciate the inclusion of language 
to expedite replacement of PFAS fire-
fighting foams and funding to study 
their health implications. 
The bill also supports research for 
metastatic cancer and encourages clin-
ical trials that affect the demographics 
of our population. 
b 1100 
The Commerce-Justice-Science divi-
sion includes language from my PACE 
Act, which I introduced with Congress-
man ALCEE HASTINGS. Our legislation 
seeks to disrupt the distrust and im-
prove communication between police 
and communities of color. 
I am also proud that my colleague, 
Congresswoman 
BRENDA
LAWRENCE, 
and I secured $8 million for the Mat-
thew Shepard hate crime investigation 
and prosecution grant program that 
was previously authorized and will now 
be funded for the first time. 
The bill addresses the growing prob-
lem of online child exploitation by 
carving out $40 million for Internet 
Crimes Against Children task forces. 
Funding is also included to research 
coral reef disease and harmful algal 
blooms, two significant problems for 
sea life in the State of Florida. 
I am particularly proud of the En-
ergy and Water division, as a member 
of that subcommittee. The bill funds 
Everglades restoration projects at a 
historic $250 million, a major bipar-
tisan achievement. I am also grateful 
for the inclusion of a fix to cut red tape 
that has delayed Everglades restora-
tion projects and will allow them to 
begin. To protect our investment, the 
bill includes language that I wrote to 
block oil drilling in the Florida Ever-
glades. 
I am encouraged that this bill pro-
vides increases for the Office of Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy and 
ARPA-E. 
I am glad that the Financial Services 
division includes $500 million for elec-
tion security grants for States to fight 
foreign intervention because, appar-
ently, the President isn’t interested in 
doing that. 
The report also includes language to 
improve postal security, which affected 
my office as well as the offices of Con-
gresswoman MAXINE WATERS and nu-
merous other leaders after a failed 
bombing attempt, an incident that 
raised serious postal security concerns. 
I am also pleased that the bill in-
cludes funding for pool safety grants 
that address swimming pool drownings, 
the number one cause of accidental 
death for young children in this coun-
try. 
Next, the Labor, Health and Human 
Services, and Education division in-
cludes vital funding for EARLY Act ac-
tivities, an initiative I passed to pro-
mote 
breast 
cancer 
awareness 
for 
young and at-risk women. I was diag-
nosed with breast cancer at 41 years 
old, and I am proud to say that I am 
now approaching my 13th year as a sur-
vivor, and I appreciate the opportunity 
to make sure we can educate more 
young women and women at higher 
risk of their risk of breast cancer so 
they pay attention to their breast 
health. 
Additionally, the bill includes sup-
port for Holocaust survivors, who face 
countless obstacles as they age. 
Further, the bill protects unaccom-
panied migrant children by ensuring 
Members of Congress can visit child de-
tention facilities with no prior notice— 
important accountability provisions. 
Language similar to my Families, Not 
Facilities Act was included to help un-
accompanied migrant youth find spon-
sors. 
Finally, the Transportation, Housing 
and Urban Development division pro-
vides investments in our transpor-
tation infrastructure and housing pro-
grams. I am glad to see $60 million for 
housing homeless veterans who have 
given so much for this country. 
I applaud the inclusion of provisions 
throughout the minibus to assert our 
authority as a coequal branch of gov-
ernment by prohibiting funds from 
being stolen by the President to pay 
for any border wall, which would be 
grossly irresponsible. 
I thank my fellow subcommittee 
chairs and, once again, thank Chair-
woman LOWEY as she retires from the 
Appropriations Committee, and their 
intrepid staff for the hard work that 
went into producing this minibus that 
takes care of the many needs people of 
all backgrounds face in this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the 
bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond 
quickly to the overall thrust of what is 
in these bills. There is no question, as 
my friend from Florida said, there are 
a lot of good things in these bills. 
My friend from Florida is actually a 
distinguished member of the Appro-
priations Committee, one whom I have 
had the opportunity to work with on 
many occasions. We don’t object to 
those. But what is undeniable is there 
is roughly $40 billion more in spending 
than my friends agreed to only last 
year. Now, that is a budget cap im-
posed by law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3896 
July 29, 2020 
Occasionally, Mr. Speaker, you have 
reason to do emergencies. We are living 
through an emergency right now. But 
if you need emergency spending, you 
negotiate that with the other side. 
There was no negotiation here with Re-
publicans in the House. You certainly 
negotiate with the other Chamber, Mr. 
Speaker, particularly when it is con-
trolled by the other party. There was 
no negotiation with the other Cham-
ber. And you certainly negotiate with 
the President of the United States—no 
negotiation with him either. It is just 
a number made up out of whole cloth 
to keep my friends from having to 
make some tough budgetary decisions 
that they agreed to make and passed 
into law only last year. 
The second thing, as I mentioned, is 
these bills are chock-full of partisan 
riders. That is just the reality. Now my 
friends know none of these riders are 
going to remain in these bills or the 
bills will never pass the United States 
Senate and never be signed by a Repub-
lican President, so I suppose they were 
put in there for some internal reason. 
I hope they are not put in there to 
keep us from going past the September 
30 deadline, which all these bills should 
be finished by, into later this year or, 
goodness knows, next year, when my 
friends might think they might have a 
more 
politically 
favorable 
environ-
ment. That is a disservice. 
This Congress ought to get its job 
done. It can’t get its job done when one 
side decides to break its agreement, 
add almost a quarter of a trillion dol-
lars in new spending, and add dozens of 
new policy provisions that they know 
are unacceptable. 
We can have those debates. They are 
good debates to have, but they don’t 
belong in the middle of appropriations 
bills. I am not naive enough to say that 
both sides don’t do this. We certainly 
did it when we were in the majority on 
some occasions. But when we did do it, 
it always slowed down the process and 
made agreement more difficult. 
Last year, 2019, the President, the 
Speaker, the minority leader, the Sen-
ate majority leader, and the Senate mi-
nority leader sat down and negotiated 
a deal. They said that these are going 
to be the spending limits, and we are 
not going to put any extraneous things 
in these bills. 
To my friends’ credit, last year they 
actually did that. They stayed within 
the limit that we had set, and they did 
not put extraneous things in the bill. 
Consequently, all those bills passed; 
they all got enacted into law; we have 
had no government shutdowns; and we 
have had regular order. 
Why they decided this year to aban-
don the agreement that they actually 
committed to last year and launch 
spending initiatives and policy initia-
tives that they said they would not do 
is beyond me, but I do remind them it 
will make it much more difficult to 
come to agreement. 
So, given that, and given the fact 
that my friends have not kept the 
agreement that they agreed to last 
year, assented to last year, I am going 
to oppose the rule and urge rejection of 
the underlying legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no more requests 
for time on my side. I would just say to 
my colleagues before I yield to the gen-
tleman for his closing remarks that I 
think these are good bills that will 
help us not only get through this pan-
demic, but help set the stage for the 
economic recovery that we need. 
While we are all here talking, I hope 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle are picking up the phone and call-
ing their Senate counterparts and call-
ing the White House and urging them 
to get serious about a coronavirus re-
lief package that we desperately need. 
Schools in some districts are about 
to open up, and there is no Federal aid 
to help with what they may need to 
keep our children and our teachers 
safe. There is no money going to our 
cities and towns that are financially 
strapped because of our economy hav-
ing shut down, no money to protect 
people so we can have safe elections, 
nothing—not anything—to help the 
millions of people in this country who 
are hungry. 
The Senate proposal, which I am not 
even sure it is a proposal anymore, has 
no money in it for SNAP. The most 
vulnerable people in this country get 
nothing when it comes to putting food 
on the table. They have reduced unem-
ployment benefits, and then they sneak 
in money for an FBI building and 
money for defense contractors while 
they shortchange everybody else. 
We are in a healthcare crisis, we are 
in an economic crisis, and we need to 
respond. These appropriations bills, 
again, are a way to help us get back on 
our feet; but, in the immediate term, 
we need to get the Senate to get seri-
ous and respond, as the House did over 
2 months ago, and extend a lifeline to 
the American people. 
This is serious. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
care whether you are a Democrat or a 
Republican. I hear from constituents of 
all political persuasions who are beg-
ging us to do something to help teach-
ers and superintendents. 
Where is the help? Mayors, town 
managers, and city managers are ask-
ing: Where is the help? 
The House acted over 2 months ago— 
nothing from the Senate. So I think 
these appropriations bills are good, but 
we need to get something else done 
even before these become enacted. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by tell-
ing my good friend that I have many of 
the same concerns he does about the 
coronavirus crisis and the need to act 
on another bill. 
That is not what is before us today, 
but I look forward to when that time 
comes and we have a negotiated prod-
uct to working with my friend and see-
ing if we can find the necessary support 
to make sure that is enacted into law. 
Indeed, the Senate is involved in doing 
that right now. 
What is before us today is the work 
of the Appropriations Committee of the 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
not 
coronavirus 
legislation 
per 
se, 
al-
though there are certainly elements in 
this bill that deal with that. 
Let me again reiterate what I said 
just a few minutes ago: There are a lot 
of good things in these appropriations 
bills. Appropriators work hard and 
quite a few often work together. We 
have an excellent chairman and an ex-
cellent ranking member, and so we co-
operate. So there are many good things 
in these bills. But what makes them 
fundamentally unacceptable is, first, a 
decision to insert almost a quarter of a 
trillion dollars of emergency spending 
that violates the budget agreement 
that my friends signed only last year. 
Mr. Speaker, if you need an emer-
gency 
measure—that 
happens—then 
you sit down and negotiate with the 
other side about what the amount is 
and what the nature of the response is. 
There was no effort to negotiate with 
Republicans on this emergency spend-
ing—not in the House, not with the Re-
publican-dominated United States Sen-
ate, and not with the Republican Presi-
dent. So these are just numbers willy- 
nilly sort of thrown in there, and they 
are not going anywhere. In that sense, 
we have wasted a lot of time. 
Second, my friends agreed, also, last 
year to no riders, no policy provisions 
in the bills. We will just have straight 
government funding bills. Last year, 
they did that. They kept that agree-
ment last year. They kept to the top 
line numbers, and they kept to their 
agreements in terms of policy. We 
passed all 12 bills in a bipartisan man-
ner. The President signed them, and we 
have enjoyed the benefit of that this 
year. We have had no government shut-
down and we have had no crises. The 
work was done in a timely fashion. 
Why my friends abandoned a formula 
and an agreement that worked last 
year to do this is beyond me. Frankly, 
it smacks a little bit of election-year 
politics; but, regardless, the purpose is 
to fund the government and to keep 
the government working for all of our 
citizens, providing basic services. 
These bills won’t do that because 
they violated an agreement last year 
and they contain things that my 
friends recognized a year ago that, if 
we do that, then we are not going to 
get to any agreement on spending. The 
same thing is true today. The political 
constellation hasn’t changed. It won’t 
change for the balance of this fiscal 
year, and it won’t change for the bal-
ance of the calendar year. 
If we were serious about legislating, 
we would write real bills that adhere to 
the agreements that both sides make, 
not add additional hundreds of billions 
of dollars of spending and add addi-
tional policy provisions that we know

the other side will not accept. Unfortu-
nately, that is what is being done here. 
So I regret that. I hope my friends at 
some point will decide to come back 
and bargain. I suspect they will. They 
usually do. But we are wasting pre-
cious time now. We could have com-
pleted all these bills. 
Frankly, I will chastise the Senate 
here, too, because they are not moving 
very fast on the basic necessity of 
these bills. They have a tougher proc-
ess. They can’t just get a majority and 
ram things through the way my friends 
have the ability to do when they are in 
the majority and we have the ability to 
do when we are in the majority. It is a 
little bit different in the Senate of the 
United States. I recognize that. 
But we should make a contribution. 
We should have stuck to our agree-
ment. We need emergency spending, 
which I think we do. That should come 
outside the confines of this legislation 
in standalone, emergency legislation 
agreed to by both sides negotiating in 
good faith. We have done that four 
times this year already. We are pretty 
good at it. If we would do it again for 
a fifth—and they are trying to do it 
now in the Senate—then I think we 
could deal with those other items that 
are in these bills that, quite frankly, 
belong in a standalone supplemental 
dealing with coronavirus. 
So, with that, I want to thank my 
friend for the time, and I want to 
thank him for the debate. As always, I 
look forward to working with him; but, 
for the moment, I urge the rejection of 
the rule and urge the rejection of the 
underlying legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thank-
ing the Rules Committee staff and 
members for all of their incredible 
work during the last few weeks. We 
have processed thousands of amend-
ments. We have had hours and hours 
and hours of hearings. We have listened 
to countless Members testify, and we 
were able to get through it all. 
But, again, I want people to appre-
ciate especially the work of the staff. I 
say that in a bipartisan way that the 
Democratic staff and the Republican 
staff of the Rules Committee worked 
incredibly hard. I don’t think most 
people even know it, but they ought to 
know it because this is a lot of work. 
I say to the gentleman from Okla-
homa who is my friend, we don’t al-
ways agree on everything, but I am 
very fortunate to have him as a rank-
ing member because I think he respects 
this institution and he fights very hard 
for his beliefs. I fight hard for my be-
liefs. But even when we disagree, it is 
not in a personal way. We can disagree 
without being disagreeable, and I ap-
preciate him for that, and my other 
colleagues as well. 
b 1115 
Mr. Speaker, this rule is about mov-
ing forward to consider a measure to 
get annual and emergency funding 
moving to help put people back to 
work, to reinvigorate our public health 
system, to rebuild our aging roads and 
bridges, and to put an important check 
on this administration. This rule also 
is about whether we should debate hun-
dreds and hundreds of amendments 
from Democrats and Republicans. 
Mr. Speaker, this is ultimately about 
whether we fulfill one of our most fun-
damental responsibilities. I urge all of 
my colleagues to come together in sup-
port of this rule and the underlying 
legislation. Let’s ensure this Congress 
continues to provide the leadership the 
American people are demanding. 
The material previously preferred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1067 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this

of order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the

and (2) one motion to commit. 
SEC. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of S. 939. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the

cluding to carry out data systems building and 
other activities that enable the disbursement of 
payments of such subgrants; 
(B) to provide technical assistance and sup-
port in applying for and accessing the subgrant 
opportunity under paragraph (2), to eligible

under this section and conduct widespread out-
reach to eligible child care providers, including 
family child care providers, group home child 
care providers, and other non-center-based child

child care networks, to ensure eligible child care 
providers are aware of the subgrants available 
under this section; 
(D) to carry out the reporting requirements 
described in subsection (f); and 
(E) to carry out activities to improve the sup-
ply and qualify of child care during and after

provements to child care facilities, increasing 
access to licensure or participation in the State’s 
tiered quality rating system, and carrying out 
other activities described in section 658G(b) of 
the Child Care and Development Block Grant 
Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858e(b)), to the extent 
that the lead agency can carry out activities de-

longer than 6 months) before March 1, 2020 and 
at minimum cover such operating expenses for 
the intended length of the subgrant; 
(ii) account for increased costs of providing or 
preparing to provide child care as a result of the 
COVID–19 public health emergency, such as 
provider and employee compensation and exist-
ing benefits (existing as of March 1, 2020) and 
the implementation of new practices related to 
sanitization, group size limits, and social 
distancing; 
(iii) be adjusted for payments or reimburse-
ments made to an eligible child care provider to

(II) for a provider described in subparagraph 
(B)(ii)(I), an assurance that, for the duration of 
the COVID–19 public health emergency— 
(aa) the provider will give priority for avail-
able slots (including slots that are only tempo-
rarily available) to— 
(AA) children of essential workers (such as 
health care sector employees, emergency re-
sponders, 
sanitation

child care employees, and other workers deter-
mined to be essential during the response to 
coronavirus by public officials), children of 
workers whose places of employment require

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour, equally divided among and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Ap-
propriations and the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
The gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO), the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GRANGER), the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), and the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of my bill to save the childcare in-
dustry: The Child Care Is Essential 
Act. 
Let me recognize my colleagues who 
join me here this morning, especially 
the Chair of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, Chairman BOBBY 
SCOTT. 
To make clear our fight and our pur-
pose, I quote The Washington Post 
from July 4. 
The title of the piece: ‘‘Lack of 
childcare slowing recovery. Working 
Parents Swamped At Home. Produc-
tivity slump pinned on school, center 
closures.’’ 
‘‘The childcare crunch triggered by 
the pandemic has rapidly become a cri-
sis for many workers and companies 
that is hindering the economic recov-
ery, 
disproportionately 
harming 
women and threatening to leave deep 
scars for years to come.’’ 
The Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices 
and 
Education 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee has been central to our 
response to this pandemic and has pro-
vided much-needed funding to deal 
with the crisis—providing $3.5 billion 
for childcare in the CARES Act, and $7 
billion in the House-passed HEROES 
Act. 
But, to be frank, $7 billion in the HE-
ROES Act is not enough to save the 
childcare sector. It could take at least 
$9.6 billion per month to keep current 
childcare providers in business. This is 
a crisis. More than half of childcare 
programs could close if we do not act 
quickly. 
The biggest worry of the providers in 
my State of Connecticut are the loss of 
revenue, how to pay non-payroll busi-
ness expenses, and they are concerned 
that families will not return after the 
public health emergency. Affordable 
childcare was a significant and a severe 
issue before the pandemic and will be 
after this pandemic is over. 
This is not about going back to nor-
mal. We cannot afford to do that ei-
ther. If we cannot make families feel 
safe that their kids are going to be in 
a safe and secure environment, we are 
not going to get our economy back on 
track. Parents are not going to send 
their children to unsafe places or they 
have no place to send them. 
Mr. Speaker, the Childcare Is Essen-
tial Act creates a $50 billion childcare 
stabilization fund within the existing 
Childcare 
and 
Development 
Block 
Grant Program. The bill provides grant 
funding to childcare providers to sta-
bilize the sector and support providers 
so that they can be safely reopening 
and running. 
This legislation helps childcare pro-
viders and working families by: 
Ensuring that the grants adequately 
support providers’ operating expenses 
and funding gets to them quickly; 
Requires that providers continue to 
pay their staff; 
Providing tuition and copayment re-
lief for working families; 
Promote health and safety through 
compliance with public health guid-
ance; 
Prioritize providers that serve under-
served populations; 
Ensuring grants are awarded equi-
tably across childcare settings; and 
Conducting oversight through robust 
reporting requirements. 
Mr. Speaker, we bailed out the air-
lines—almost 
$60 
billion—and 
we 
thought that that was necessary to do 
for our economy. 
Corporations have received $522 bil-
lion for PPP loans, and we knew that 
that was important to undergird our 
economy. 
Hedge fund managers and real estate 
developers got a $135 billion tax break 
completely unrelated to the pandemic. 
We did not need that. 
We need to save the childcare indus-
try. It is a matter of values, of right 
and wrong, and it is a matter of the 
values of who we believe needs to be 
protected: Our children? Our families? 
Or special interests? 
It is a matter of economic security 
for women and families, and lack of 
childcare has been cited as a reason 
why women are still highly reflected in 
the unemployment rolls. 
Small businesses are concerned. One 
half of all essential workers in this 
country are women. Who are the essen-
tial workers? Grocery store workers, 
public transport, cleaning and sanita-
tion, healthcare, retail workers. They 
have to go to work. Where do they put 
their kids? 
And it is a matter of addressing ra-
cial disparities, which this virus has 
further exposed, particularly when pro-
viders in communities of color con-
tinue to struggle to access small busi-
ness loans, like those through the PPP 
because of systemic discrimination in 
banking practices, the wealth gap, 
higher debt. We must help now. 
Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, I say: Let us 
move boldly in this historic moment 
for women, for families, for children, 
for small businesses, for communities 
of color. Let us stabilize the childcare 
sector. Childcare is essential. There is 
no reopening of our economy without 
it. So let us provide that $50 billion 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion of H.R. 7027. As the country navi-
gates 
the 
ongoing 
reality 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, childcare is one 
of the most important issues we have 
to resolve. Congress must put childcare 
solutions in place to help working fam-
ilies address their needs, but this bill 
before us is not the answer. 
This bill would appropriate $50 bil-
lion for the childcare industry—more 
than its entire annual revenue. Overly 
burdensome and complicated applica-
tion requirements would accompany 
those funds. This means providers 
would spend their time on applications 
and 
reporting 
requirements 
rather 
than caring for the children and keep-
ing them safe. The bill creates unnec-
essary confusion by requiring providers 
to follow CDC guidance and that of 
their State and local governments even 
when those requirements may conflict. 
The Committee on Appropriations 
has had no hearings or markups to con-
sider this bill. There has been no input 
from the minority, and there is no op-
portunity today for amendments. Un-
fortunately, the majority has yet again 
used this crisis as an opportunity to 
push through partisan policy proposals 
instead of working together to address 
the very real challenges we face. We 
can and we must do better than the 
bills we are considering today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask for 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman DELAURO for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here today not 
just as a representative of New Jersey’s 
11th District, but also as a working 
mom with four children—a mom who 
knows how important childcare is for 
our families, our businesses, and our 
communities. 
I have long said it is critical to have 
women serving in Congress to legislate 
on these important issues, and it has 
been my own experience—as I try to 
ensure that my children are doing their 
schoolwork while I am attending Zoom 
meetings, conference calls, and work-
ing to serve the families throughout 
the 11th District—that has led me to 
call experts to discuss the challenges 
to providing safe childcare during the 
pandemic. 
It is my experience now, as I try to 
piece together childcare between my 
husband and my two sisters and my-
self, and trying to come down to Wash-
ington to vote, that informs my under-
standing of what is going on across the 
Nation. 
Before the pandemic, 5 million chil-
dren and their families relied on 
childcare. 
How 
we 
address 
this 
childcare crisis will have deep rever-
berations throughout our economy and 
on the health and safety of our families 
and our workers. Without the proper 
support for childcare to open safely and 
effectively, there will be no real re-
opening for much of the workforce. 
Without proper childcare options, 
that means childcare facilities that 
have the money to implement health 
and safety precautions necessary to 
protect children and workers, women 
will be forced to choose between stay-
ing home or going back to work. If 
childcare is scarce or feels unsafe, 
moms will be staying home in the vast 
majority of cases. 
In fact, an economist at North-
western University who studies the 
gendered impact of the pandemic, 
noted that 19 million children live in 
single-parent households, 70 percent of 
which are led by single moms. If 
women have to leave the workforce or 
cut back hours, these decisions will 
have long-lasting impacts on the future 
of their careers, salary, promotions, eq-
uitable pay, and the economic security 
of their families. 
I have heard from leaders in research 
institutions who have said that while 
men are submitting research papers at 
a faster clip than ever, their female 
counterparts have not. They attribute 
this to the burden of childcare that 
rests on women without access to 
childcare services.

Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. WEXTON). 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support today for the Child Care 
Is Essential Act. 
As a working mom, I know that find-
ing quality, affordable childcare is not 
easy even under the best of cir-
cumstances, but the strain of COVID–19 
has pushed the childcare industry to 
the brink of collapse. 
Nearly half of all childcare providers 
have closed at some point during this 
pandemic, and those that have re-
opened are facing increased costs to 
implement new safety measures, in-
cluding reduced capacity, intense and 
frequent disinfecting and cleaning, and 
the purchase of PPE for providers. 
Without immediate financial support, 
many are at risk of closing perma-
nently. 
Congress and this administration 
must recognize there cannot be a 
strong and full economic recovery 
without access to quality, affordable 
childcare for working families. 
This important bill will create a $50 
billion childcare stabilization fund and 
invest in childcare across our country 
to ensure that providers have the re-
sources they need to safely reopen. The 
Child Care Is Essential Act would bring 
an estimated $985 million to my home 
State of Virginia to keep childcare pro-
viders open and their employees on 
payroll. 
Parents simply cannot return to 
work if they can’t find childcare. We 
are facing a crisis, and Congress must 
take decisive action on behalf of the 
working families and parents in Amer-
ica. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support the Child Care Is 
Essential Act. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Child Care Is 
Essential Act, a bill that will help 
childcare centers stay open through 
this pandemic and help us reopen our 
economy. 
For almost 5 months now, families 
have struggled to balance work and 
childcare. Meanwhile, essential work-
ers, including farmworkers, healthcare 
workers, police, and firefighters, rely 
on childcare for their families and for 
them to do their jobs. 
But as this pandemic continues, it 
gets more difficult for childcare pro-
viders to keep their doors open. Just 29 
percent of childcare and education cen-
ters in Monterey County in my district 
are currently open and operating. 
Without help from the Federal Govern-
ment, our childcare centers will have 
to close, and our essential workers will 
be unable to serve our communities. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
vote for the Child Care Is Essential 
Act, because, with these grants to 
childcare providers, they can stay open 
and safely operate during this pan-
demic but also play a critical part in 
our Nation’s rebuilding and recovery. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, can I in-
quire about the amount of time re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Connecticut has 5 min-
utes remaining. The gentlewoman from 
Texas has 131⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an extraordinary 
time in our Nation’s history. We are 
watching families today who are in the 
most serious economic and healthcare 
crises of their lives. What this pan-
demic has exposed are the serious, seri-
ous inequities that exist, the racial in-
equities that exist. 
What is becoming clear, from my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, is 
that there are two classes of people. We 
have essential workers, who I pointed 
out are the grocery workers, the tran-
sit workers, the sanitation people, the 
retail workers who clock in and out 
every single day and who have to be on 
the job, and they have been told if they 
don’t show up, they don’t get paid. But 
they have kids; they have families. 
What is the main responsibility of a 
parent? The pride you take in making 
sure that your children are safe, that 
they are secure, that you are doing all 
you can for them to be able to survive. 
So, what is your choice? Leave your 
kid by themselves? You can’t take 
them to work. You know, I had a 
lengthy conversation, almost 2 hours, 
on the phone with farmworkers in our 
country. Know what they do without 
access to childcare? They leave their 
kids home alone, or they take them to 
the fields. 
Who are we? This is the United 
States of America. Where are our val-
ues? What do we care most about? 
Let me just tell you about that $135 
billion that is in the CARES bill. I will 
just say that the Democrats took it out 
in the HEROES bill. But as I see the 
bill that our Republicans colleagues 
put forward in the last 24 hours, it is 
still in there. It is a tax break for 43,000 
people in this country, and they get a 
$1.6 million tax cut. They claw back to 
2018, 2019. No one knew the word 
‘‘coronavirus’’ in 2018 and 2019. It has 
nothing to do with this pandemic. 
I will mention those essential work-
ers again to you today because there 
are 17.9 million children under the age 
of 13. Their parents are frontline work-
ers, as I have laid out. 
I will also add, in full disclosure, that 
two-thirds of these children do not re-
quire emergency care because they

have another parent. They have a fam-
ily member or an adult caregiver avail-
able to them. But this implies that we 
have 6 million kids who need emer-
gency care at 45 hours per week. 
There are 6 million children who need 
to be in childcare. The providers that 
remain open are providing emergency 
care to these workers, and they are in-
curring costs, including paid premiums 
for staff, substitute workers for staff 
who are out on paid sick or family 
leave, higher prices for food and mate-
rials, including recommended personal 
protective and sanitation equipment 
and supplies. 
You know, public safety demands 
that each center or home-based pro-
vider serves fewer children than they 
normally do. Why? For safety reasons. 
Understand, people want to talk 
about the economy reopening. Are par-
ents going to send their kids to—first 
of all, we are talking about schools 
where the CDC has said that the worst 
situation is 5-day, in-person. Yet, what 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle want to do is to tie their edu-
cation funds to whether they do that, 
which is outrageous to begin with, and 
now they do not want to provide any 
funding for childcare providers. 
In the HEROES bill, it is $5 million 
and $10 million in grants. The National 
Women’s Law Center has told us it will 
be about $9.6 billion a month to deal 
with this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable. All 
I can say is, if we can bail out the air-
lines, if we can bail out the business 
community, we should be done with 
the $135 billion. Let’s move forward: $50 
billion for childcare legislation today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PA-
NETTA.) The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the Committee on Appropria-
tions has expired. 
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) and the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will

The gentleman from Virginia is rec-
ognized. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House of 
Representatives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support for this legislation. 
I salute Congresswoman DELAURO for 
her leadership over the years, constant, 
persistent, dissatisfied, and relentless, 
in terms of looking out for our chil-
dren. 
I thank the distinguished gentleman 
from Virginia, the chair of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, for his 
leadership throughout all of this. I 
think he knows this issue, chapter and 
verse, over the years, and so I am so 
happy that we are coming to the floor 
for this. 
In our community, there is such a 
need for childcare. It is endless. We 
don’t even come close. We have been 
thinking incrementally. We have to 
think transformatively. 
Even little children know. In our 
community, we have T-shirts, ‘‘Chil-
dren Learning, Parents Earning,’’ the 
direct 
connection 
between 
quality 
childcare, where children are given a 
good start on where they are going. 
I rise during this devastating time 
for America, as the health and eco-
nomic crisis of COVID–19 hurtles fur-
ther out of control. Ten weeks ago, the 
Democrats delivered a solution by de-
feating the virus and safely opening 
the economy with the HEROES Act—it 
was actually 10 weeks ago today—sup-
porting our heroes, crushing the virus, 
and putting money in America’s pock-
et. Yet, for 10 weeks, we haven’t had 
the action that we need on that. 
So, here we are. For all the state-
ments that were made over time about 
need for childcare, this virus has really 
shown a bright spotlight on why it is so 
important. 
Parents 
know; 
children 
know; we all know. But this virus has 
been an instructor, because if parents 
are forced to go to work as essential 
workers, who is going to take care of 
the children if their schools cannot 
open actually and some are virtual? 
Again, when I ran for Congress, over 
30 years ago, people said to me: ‘‘Who 
is taking care of your children?’’ My 
children were big. Four of them were 
already in college and one a senior in 
high school. But that was the question: 
Who is taking care of the children? And 
that is a question for our Nation: Who 
is taking care of the children? 
In order for us to succeed with this, 
we have to meet the needs of the chil-
dren, their families, and childcare 
workers. Our childcare workers are the 
workforce behind the workforce, risk-
ing their health and safety on the front 
lines to ensure that parents can go to 
work. 
But they face a devastating situa-
tion. The childcare system needs at 
least $50 billion in the next 6 months in 
order to survive. Just one in five 
childcare programs believes that they 
can stay open for more than a year 
without Federal support. 
This 
is 
essential. 
An 
estimated 
326,000 workers, nearly one-third of the 
sector nationwide, have lost their jobs 
since February—326,000 since February. 
b 1145 
Half of the providers have closed, and 
those that are open to serve children of 
essential workers are risking their 
health, too often without PPE, and 
parents are paying the price. We can’t 
get people back to work until we have 
widespread access to safe, quality, and 
affordable childcare. 
Here is the situation in the childcare 
workers’ own words. Terry from Wis-
consin said: I have gone from 81 kids a 
day to two. I can’t stay open with two, 
we are considered essential, but how 
can I stay open without the help need-
ed? I love my kids, staff, and families, 
but to ask me to go under because all 
of a sudden I am essential—really? This 
is what we say: People are essential. 
We have to treat them as if they are es-
sential. 
Traci from Pennsylvania says: We 
are a nonprofit center, mainly funded 
by families who pay out of pocket. We 
need a way to maintain payroll of staff 
so that they can be ready to return 
when we are allowed to reopen. We 
need help paying our rent and health 
insurance costs. We will need help un-
derstanding how to stay open safely 
and how to adjust to new regulations, 
how to afford related training, and 
what to do if our families can’t afford 
to return. 
And Mary in New York says: Since 
COVID, my childcare center has gone 
from 89 percent to about 10 percent. 
Fifteen employees will lose their jobs. 
We are the only center in a 1-mile ra-
dius in a very low-income area. We are 
the only voice for our parents and chil-
dren. Please help us be heard. 
And so action is needed now, which is 
why I am proud to support two bills 
that will be a lifeline for childcare 
workers and for the economy, while 
keeping our children safe and helping 
them and helping parents go back to 
work: 
H.R. 7027, the Child Care Is Essential 
Act, creating a $50 billion childcare 
stabilization fund to provide funding to 
childcare providers over the next 6 
months and helping them safely reopen 
and operate during and after the 
COVID–19 crisis; and 
H.R. 7327, the Child Care for Eco-
nomic Recovery Act, expanding access 
to quality childcare to help workers 
safely return to their jobs and stimu-
late the economy with Federal invest-
ments and tax subsidies. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman 
NITA LOWEY, a maestro of the legisla-
tive process, who has advanced im-
measurable progress for generations of 
Americans. 
I thank RICHARD NEAL for his leader-
ship on the tax credit and Federal in-
vestments work. 
Mr. Speaker, I salute Congresswoman 
ROSA DELAURO, chair of the House Ap-
propriations Subcommittee on Labor, 
Health and Human Services, and the 
godmother of much of the work for 
families and children that we do in this 
Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chairman 
BOBBY SCOTT and Senator PATTY MUR-
RAY, ranking member of the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee, for their leadership 
on this bill. Thank you, Mr. SCOTT, for 
every day reminding us and leading us 
on how we can help our children. 
And I thank and recognize the out-
side organizers who have been relent-
less, persistent, and dissatisfied, as is 
Rosa, as they have fought for the 
strong investments in the childcare 
sector that our children and workers 
need. 
When people ask me, ‘‘What are the 
three most important issues facing the 
Congress?’’ I always say the same thing

July 29, 2020 
and have for over 30 years. The three 
most important issues facing the Con-
gress are our children, our children, 
our children: their health, their edu-
cation, the economic security of their 
families, a safe environment in which 
they can thrive, a world at peace in 
which they can reach their fulfillment, 
and my motivation for even coming to 
Congress was one in five children in 
America who lives in poverty. 
But it isn’t only families in poverty 
who are affected by this childcare 
issue; it is our entire society and entire 
economy, and that is why we have to 
think transformatively about this. 
As we observe the 100th anniversary 
of women having the right to vote, as 
we observe the fact that we have over 
100 women in Congress, many of them 
moms of small children, we do have to 
recognize that, for our economy to 
thrive, we have to have the full partici-
pation and leadership of women, be-
cause we do believe, when women suc-
ceed, America succeeds, for that to 
happen. And dads have this responsi-
bility, too, so we want them to succeed 
as well. 
But for all of that to happen, we have 
to make sure that we know who is tak-
ing care of the children, and the role 
that we play is to facilitate all of that 
to make sure it is of the highest qual-
ity and safety for the children and en-
sure that they are served by the legis-
lation that we are considering. 
For the sake of the children, their 
health, their safety, and our children’s 
future, as we recover from COVID but 
learn from it, I urge our colleagues to 
support this important legislation. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 7027, Democrats’ partisan Child 
Care Is Essential Act, which, based off 
its troublesome provisions, would be 
better titled as the no care for children 
act. 
Republicans and Democrats agree 
that there is a critical need that exists 
in our country today: the need to help 
childcare providers reopen their busi-
nesses safely. 
Childcare is the cornerstone of the 
American workforce. If parents do not 
have a safe place to send their children, 
they cannot work. If our Nation is 
going to recover swiftly and success-
fully from the COVID–19 pandemic, 
childcare providers must be an integral 
part of the solution to getting America 
reopened and back to work. 
Unfortunately, the bill we are consid-
ering today, H.R. 7027, is just another 
messaging bill for House Democrats, 
who are more interested in political 
posturing than enacting meaningful so-
lutions. 
Before I get into the lowlights of this 
legislation, I would like to point out 
that childcare falls under the jurisdic-
tion of the House Education and Labor 
Committee. However, our committee 
did not hold a single hearing or a single 
markup on today’s bill. This is becom-
ing a recurring theme in Speaker 
PELOSI’s House of Representatives. 
The fact that Chairman SCOTT al-
lowed Speaker PELOSI
to make the 
opening comments on this bill is a fur-
ther indication that this is Speaker 
PELOSI’s bill. The blatant disregard for 
congressional precedent and proper 
way of doing our job is appalling. Too 
many pieces of legislation are being 
written behind closed doors in the 
Speaker’s office. This type of back-
room horse trading is not how the Na-
tion’s deliberative body should operate. 
On top of this, House Democrats are 
casting votes and conducting legisla-
tive business from the comfort of their 
own homes or, in some cases, their 
fishing boat, and bringing partisan 
messaging bills to the House floor 
without going through the legislative 
process, all while collecting a tax-
payer-funded paycheck. 
We have gone from a representative 
Republic to an autocracy. Members of 
Congress were elected to represent 
Americans here in Washington, yet 
Speaker PELOSI seems set on silencing 
those voices. This is downright shame-
ful and indicative of Speaker PELOSI’s 
out-of-touch 
politics-over-progress 
agenda. 
Back to the flawed legislation at 
hand. 
We all agree that Congress should 
help childcare providers reopen safely; 
however, we cannot spend taxpayer 
dollars recklessly while layering on ad-
ditional burdens when childcare pro-
viders on the ground are already facing 
burdensome red tape. 
The Democrats’ flawed, one-sided bill 
appropriates $50 billion, which is high-
er than the entire annual revenue of 
the childcare industry and substan-
tially more than Democrats felt was 
necessary to include in their so-called 
HEROES Act. 
We know the Democrats preferred so-
lution for any problem is to throw 
more taxpayer money at it, but the Bi-
partisan Policy Center estimated that 
the industry would need about half of 
the amount included in H.R. 7027 to re-
cover. 
Additionally, H.R. 7027 places burden-
some requirements on childcare pro-
viders, which could lead to providers 
spending more time and money apply-
ing for and reporting on the funds rath-
er than doing what is most important: 
serving children. 
Providers already have to figure out 
how to implement new and necessary 
health and safety rules, from social 
distancing and limits on group size to 
increased cleaning protocols. As if this 
isn’t 
already 
weighing 
heavily 
on 
childcare professionals, Democrats now 
want to enact even more cumbersome 
requirements for them to deal with. 
This legislation also tries to dictate 
from the Federal level how providers 
run their businesses, which can hamper 
their ability to reopen safely and stay 
open. 
This ill-advised bill also denies sup-
port for certain eligible providers, such 
as 
churches 
and 
public 
recreation 
camps who are licensed-exempt, oper-
ating legally in a State, and meeting 
all State and local requirements. 
H.R. 7027 fails to address the barriers 
many new providers face, an issue that 
can increase cost and limit slots for 
children. 
Mr. Speaker, the no care for children 
act will drive up costs substantially, 
tie many providers’ hands unneces-
sarily, and shift the focus away from 
serving children and supporting par-
ents returning to work. 
It is worth repeating that Repub-
licans and Democrats wholeheartedly 
agree on the overarching goal of this 
debate we are having today. A lack of 
childcare options could seriously delay 
our Nation’s economic recovery. That 
is why it is extremely disappointing 
that we are spending our time debating 
another partisan messaging bill from 
House Democrats rather than focusing 
on common ground and working in a 
bipartisan fashion to solve our dif-
ferences on this issue and deliver for 
American families. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on H.R. 7027, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would remind the dis-
tinguished ranking member that we did 
have a hearing in February and, actu-
ally, a briefing in May that the minor-
ity party decided not to participate in. 
And insofar as the Speaker, she was 
here. If I had opened, she would have 
had to listen to me and to you and 
would have been here waiting all that 
time. The Speaker is busy, so I called 
on the Speaker so she could speak and 
return to her busy schedule. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
MCBATH), a distinguished member of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, the 
childcare industry has suffered tremen-
dous losses since the start of this pan-
demic. Centers are facing increased op-
erating costs and are working overtime 
to provide adequate PPE and sanita-
tion materials to keep our children 
safe. 
Countless American families rely on 
the childcare industry, and we must 
provide them with the materials and 
equipment that they need to give our 
children the best possible care. To help 
small businesses grow, support hard-
working Georgians, and uplift our 
economy, parents must have a safe 
place to send their children. 
b 1200 
Truly, the childcare industry helps 
give our kids the foundation for their 
future, and it needs our help. 
Hardworking families deserve our 
support, and the Child Care Is Essen-
tial Act would give providers the fund-
ing and resources they need to nurture 
the next generation.

July 29, 2020 
I thank Representative DELAURO for 
her leadership and Chairman SCOTT for 
his leadership. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE). 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the Child Care Is Essen-
tial Act. 
Everyone in this Chamber can agree 
that access to childcare will be vital to 
the continued reopening of our econ-
omy, especially as more and more par-
ents return to work. However, this leg-
islation is not the answer. It would 
cost an astronomical $50 billion, an 
amount higher than the total revenue 
of the childcare industry in the United 
States, and twice as high as the Bipar-
tisan 
Policy 
Center 
reports 
that 
childcare providers actually need. 
Further, this legislation places so 
many reporting requirements on agen-
cies that $5 billion of that money, a 
whopping 10 percent, will go to admin-
istrative expenses, rather than helping 
children get the care that they need. 
This is not where the red tape is, by 
the way. The bill places additional and 
unneeded 
regulatory 
burdens 
on 
childcare centers that would increase 
their costs and require them to follow 
State and CDC guidelines on oper-
ations, even when those guidelines may 
directly contradict each other. The 
Child Care Is Essential Act also un-
fairly limits access to these funds. Li-
censed-exempt facilities like at many 
churches will be prohibited from ac-
cessing these funds. 
Childcare is essential as parents 
begin returning to the workplace, how-
ever, this bill spends too much tax-
payer money and places an undue and 
unworkable regulatory burden on fa-
cilities, Federal agencies, and yes, on 
families. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this legislation, and I ask my Demo-
cratic colleagues to actually come to 
the table on a bipartisan solution to 
this issue. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the Child Care Is 
Essential Act. This bill is badly needed 
to clear a massive roadblock on our 
Nation’s path to economic recovery. 
The choice is clear. Without assistance, 
only 18 percent of existing childcare 
programs will remain open a year from 
today. 
Last month, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, not known as a strong sup-
porter of social services, announced its 
support for emergency aid for childcare 
providers, declaring that ‘‘for millions 
of Americans, returning to work is not 
just contingent on the lifting of stay- 
at-home orders . . . but on securing 
care for their children.’’ This aid is 
critical because childcare providers are 
small businesses and have been oper-
ating at reduced capacity and much 
higher costs, if they are open at all. 
This 
situation 
is 
not 
sustainable. 
Every month more centers are closing 
as costs exceed revenues. Some esti-
mates predict that we may lose as 
many as 4.5 million slots nationwide 
unless Congress acts and acts fast. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation has long un-
dervalued the role that childcare plays 
in enabling our workforce, and the 
COVID–19 pandemic has exposed that 
deplorable lack of investment. Making 
sure the childcare industry survives, as 
the Chamber testified, will shorten the 
recession by getting parents back to 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
and 
neighbor, 
ROSA
DELAURO
and 
Chairman SCOTT for their work on this 
bill and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, as our Na-
tion continues to respond, recover, and 
reopen our economy following the out-
break of COVID–19, we can all agree 
that childcare is necessary in getting 
Americans back to work. 
No parent will return to work if they 
do not have a safe place for their child, 
which is another reason why schools 
safely reopening should be a priority of 
my Democratic colleagues. 
However, Democrats are pushing a 
partisan proposal that carelessly over-
spends taxpayer dollars and further 
burdens our childcare providers, who 
already face bureaucratic red tape, 
with more mandates, like overly exten-
sive application requirements that will 
cost them more time and money when 
their time is better spent caring for 
our children. 
These mandates will prevent new 
providers from entering the industry, 
ultimately increasing costs and lim-
iting the amount of available slots for 
children. 
This again is a one-size-fits-all, top- 
down government program. How much 
of this money will actually get there to 
take care of a child? 
H.R. 7027 appropriates $50 billion, 
which is higher than the entire annual 
revenue of the childcare industry— 
think 
about 
that—and 
twice 
the 
amount that the Bipartisan Policy 
Center estimated the industry would 
need. Is it going to cost another $25 bil-
lion to administrate this thing for all 
the burdensome red tape that goes 
along with it? 
Once again, the Democrats’ solution 
is more government control, more reg-
ulation, and more taxpayer dollars 
wasted with burdensome strings at-
tached. When are the American people 
going to wake up? 
It denies support for certain eligible 
providers, such as churches and public 
recreation camps, who are license-ex-
empt and operating legally in a State 
that meet all State and local require-
ments. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman from 
Georgia an additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I am dis-
appointed that, rather than finding 
common ground, my colleagues across 
the aisle are moving forward with a bill 
that will only hurt families who want 
to return to work and need access to 
childcare. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
bill, and let’s all go back to the draw-
ing board so that we can find support 
for our working families. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), the chair 
of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights 
and Human Resources. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Child 
Care Is Essential Act. 
Childcare is one of the most urgent 
and stressful issues facing families dur-
ing this pandemic and stabilizing it 
will be a key factor in opening our 
communities safely. 
I recently spoke about this issue with 
Oregonians who are struggling, par-
ents, early child educators, and small 
business owners. I released a report 
urging support for the childcare indus-
try. As one mom told me: ‘‘if childcare 
crumbles, if it even gets a fraction 
more difficult to find, then our collec-
tive ability to work crumbles too.’’ 
The childcare crisis disproportion-
ately affects women, who, because of 
entrenched gender roles, continue to 
take on the majority of childcare and 
household responsibilities. 
A lack of affordable childcare reduces 
the ability of women to work outside 
the home and extends the gender pay 
gap. This is also an issue of racial jus-
tice. 
Many 
childcare 
workers 
are 
women of color. 
I am grateful for previous stimulus 
efforts, but it is not enough. The Child 
Care Is Essential Act will provide im-
mediate relief through $50 billion, 
which I will note is less than the 
amount that went to the Nation’s air-
lines in coronavirus legislation. This is 
in 
direct 
grant 
funding 
to 
help 
childcare providers cover operating ex-
penses, purchase PPE and cleaning sup-
plies, pay providers through the pan-
demic and beyond, and importantly, 
give parents the relief they need from 
high copayments and tuition. 
Investing in our children now has 
long-term benefits for our families, for 
our communities, and for our economy. 
I thank Congresswoman DELAURO 
and Chairman SCOTT for their leader-
ship, and I urge all my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
could you advise me how much time is 
remaining on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 10 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
North Carolina has 41⁄4 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER).

July 29, 2020 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, parents 
can’t go back to earning until their 
children can go back to learning. The 
topic of reopening schools has been top 
of mind in recent weeks. We also need 
safe care for our young ones though, 
because their parents need to work, 
too. 
Childcare is essential, for parents and 
children. 
Many 
childcare 
providers 
have closed during this pandemic, some 
for safety, some for financial reasons. 
But childcare isn’t just about par-
ents’ jobs. High quality early childhood 
education is the single best way to 
close the opportunity gap and give dis-
advantaged children a strong start. 
Every dollar invested in early child-
hood education pays back $7 down the 
road, and that is a phenomenal invest-
ment. 
The Child Care Is Essential Act pro-
vides financial assistance so providers 
can reopen safely. 
By passing this bill, we support chil-
dren, working families, and childcare 
providers; all worthy of our invest-
ment. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Politico wrote recently, 
‘‘A lack of safe and affordable childcare 
amid the coronavirus pandemic is 
keeping many working parents from 
returning to the office as more compa-
nies call employees back to their jobs, 
threatening to extend the economic 
crisis and erode decades of gains for 
women in the workplace.’’ 
In fact, the Bipartisan Policy Center 
found that at the height of the COVID– 
19 outbreak, 60 percent of childcare 
centers closed, and one-third of the 
childcare workforce lost their jobs. 
The topic of today’s debate is an 
issue that both Republicans and Demo-
crats agree must be addressed. Unfor-
tunately, the legislation being pushed 
by Democrats spends taxpayer dollars 
recklessly and layers on additional 
burdensome requirements. 
That is why my Republican col-
leagues have introduced the Back to 
Work Child Care Grants Act of 2020, 
which is led by Senator ERNST and Sen-
ator ALEXANDER in the Senate and Rep-
resentative REED in the House. 
Unlike the Democrat bill we are con-
sidering today, the Back to Work Child 
Care Grants Act will offer childcare 
providers solutions and resources, not 
burdensome red tape. The GOP-led ini-
tiative would support childcare pro-
viders by offering short-term financial 
assistance, critical resources to reopen 
and stay open, all while holding pro-
viders accountable to State and local 
health and safety guidelines. 
Regrettably, 
the 
Democrats’ 
childcare bill picks winners and losers 
by denying help to many providers who 
are license-exempt and operating le-
gally, such as churches and public 
recreation camps. The Back to Work 
Child Care Grants Act of 2020, on the 
other hand, ensures all providers in 
need of support have access to funding. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 
7027, the Child Care Is Essential Act. 
Failing to solve this childcare crisis 
will set women back in the workforce 
for generations. 
We know that if we let our childcare 
industry collapse, the burden will fall 
heavily on women. 
I 
saw 
firsthand 
the 
challenges 
childcare providers face when I visited 
the Building Blocks Learning Academy 
in Batavia, Illinois earlier this month. 
They are doing heroic work, but they 
need support. 
If Congress doesn’t act, thousands of 
childcare providers will close, and mil-
lions of childcare slots will disappear. 
I am proud that Illinois has been a 
model for how States can respond to 
support childcare providers, but they 
still need the Federal help that this 
bill delivers, and we must pass it 
today. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Mrs. HAYES), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on Education and Labor. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Child Care Is Es-
sential Act. 
From the beginning, this pandemic 
has exacerbated the existing inequities 
in society and revealed the cracks that 
we have always known existed in our 
childcare system. 
The stress on this economy has left it 
teetering on the edge of total collapse. 
The tone from parents and providers 
who call my office about this issue 
have become increasingly more des-
perate. 
Providers in Connecticut tell me sto-
ries about being behind on rent pay-
ments, having to furlough workers, 
having to dip into their own savings to 
stay solvent, and trying to figure out if 
there is a way to safely open without 
continuing to mount debt. 
We may lose over half of licensed 
childcare providers in my State. 
Even 
before 
coronavirus, 
the 
childcare industry and families in Con-
necticut were struggling. We often hear 
that there is dignity in work, and with-
out childcare, work can’t happen for 
many people. 
I am a working mother. I rely on be-
fore and aftercare, and right now, like 
many of my constituents, I am strug-
gling. We live in a country where 
women contribute to the economy, 
where women contribute to societies, 
where families are struggling to go 
back to work.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut an additional 30 seconds. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, that is 
why I am excited to be here today with 
my colleagues, voting on legislation 
that will provide immediate relief to 
community providers and inject sta-
bility into the childcare industry. 
This bill would keep the workers that 
help our children learn, grow, and 
thrive employed. It would keep small 
businesses afloat and respond to the 
crisis at hand. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the Child Care Is Essential Act 
and put their money where their 
mouths are. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, we need more childcare 
slots, but rather than opening more 
doors, H.R. 7027 denies support for cer-
tain eligible providers such as churches 
and public recreation camps who are 
operating legally, and fails to address 
the barriers to entry new providers 
face, an issue that can increase costs 
and limit slots for children. 
Given the capacity issue of existing 
centers, legislative proposals should 
allow for more slots and reduce the 
barriers to entry for new providers. 
This bill does the opposite. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, we have 
a childcare crisis in America. 
In Michigan, when our auto manufac-
turers had to stop producing to address 
the impacts of COVID–19 and we saw 
production orders go to zero, with that, 
our daycare centers witnessed and ex-
perienced a dramatic drop in participa-
tion. Today, 40 percent of daycare pro-
viders in Michigan are at risk of immi-
nent closure. 
We say, ‘‘Let’s get back to work. We 
are ready to get back to work. We want 
to get back to work safely,’’ but we 
need our daycare centers. We need the 
Child Care Is Essential Act because of 
the very fact that childcare is essential 
in America. 
This is too much of an impediment 
for the hardworking people in Michigan 
and across this country, and it is a long 
overdue and realized endeavor that we 
must 
take 
on 
to 
address 
the 
coronavirus pandemic and what we 
need to do to get back to work safely 
in America. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CISNEROS).

ance, half the childcare capacity in

California and across the country is at 
risk of disappearing. This bill would 
provide much-needed relief for these fa-
cilities in my State and support work-
ing families. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
DELAURO
for her leadership on this 
issue and for working with my friend, 
Representative BACON, and me to in-
clude language from our bill in this 
package. 
My bipartisan bill ensures childcare 
providers can pay for cleaning supplies 
and safety equipment to protect chil-
dren and childcare workers from the 
coronavirus. 
According to a nationwide survey, 91 
percent of childcare centers are incur-
ring additional costs for cleaning sup-
plies. We must provide the necessary 
resources to protect the health and 
safety of our children and childcare 
workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in support of this bill to ensure 
childcare facilities nationwide can con-
tinue to serve our families. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am prepared to close when 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) is prepared to close. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN). 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SCOTT 
for allowing me to speak on this crit-
ical issue. 
I rise in strong support of the Child 
Care Is Essential Act and am grateful 
for the inclusion of my bill, the Chil-
dren’s Mental Health Care Access Act. 
Quality, affordable childcare is crit-
ical, not only for children and families 
across the country, but investing in 
the physical health and safety of our 
children as well as the mental health of 
our children is critical. 
After months of social isolation, dis-
rupted schedules, and an environment 
that has created stress, uncertainty, 
and anxiety for families, children are 
included in this. I introduced the Chil-
dren’s Mental Health Care Access Act 
to provide mental health services at 
childcare facilities through the Child 
Care and Development Block Grant. 
Before the COVID–19 pandemic, a 2019 
study showed that 16.5 percent of 
American children experience mental 
health issues, and fewer than half re-
ceive treatment. My bill ensures that 
caregivers have a support system and 
are prepared with evidence-based and 
trauma-informed solutions to help our 
children. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful my bill is 
included, and I urge support of the 
Child Care Is Essential Act. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the able Chairman SCOTT for allowing 
me this 1 minute, and I congratulate 
him on this legislation, also to Chair-
woman LOWEY on a related bill, and 
Chairwoman DELAURO. 
I rise in support of the Child Care Is 
Essential Act and the Child Care for 
Economic Recovery Act. 
Parents in our communities want 
and need quality, affordable childcare. 
Since the Childcare and Development 
Block Grant’s enactment in 1990, the 
program has been the largest source of 
financial assistance to families strug-
gling to afford childcare. 
Today, the need for childcare assist-
ance in this country has never been 
greater, and coronavirus has made the 
situation so much worse. In Ohio, the 
average annual cost of infant care is 
$9,697 a year. That is a staggering $808 
a month, which is unattainable for the 
majority of families in Ohio. 
With the ongoing pandemic, there 
could not be a better time for Congress 
to make investments in stabilizing the 
childcare sector to support providers, 
workers, and families they serve. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me the ad-
ditional time. 
The Child Care for Economic Recov-
ery Act adds to and modifies tax provi-
sions allowing for an increase and re-
fundable child and dependent care tax 
credit, allows employers payroll tax 
credits, while also increasing the gen-
eral funding for childcare entitlement 
under the Social Security Act. 
Furthermore, the Child Care Is Es-
sential Act allows providers to use sta-
bilization grants to support personnel 
pay and benefits, sanitization and PPE, 
training and professional development, 
and mental health services. According 
to the Economic Policy Institute, in-
vesting in children could increase eco-
nomic recovery by $5.6 billion in new 
economic activity in Ohio alone. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support these important bills. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time remains 
on both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) has 
23⁄4
minutes remaining. The gentle-
woman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) 
has 2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I am prepared to close. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Congress should provide childcare 
centers nationwide with resources that 
will allow them to recover from the 
many challenges they have endured 
over the last few months. Unfortu-
nately, this body has yet again missed 
an opportunity to come together in a 
bipartisan 
manner, 
solve 
our 
dif-
ferences, and tackle an issue we all 
agree needs to be addressed. Instead, 
we have more partisanship, more polit-
ical posturing, and more one-sided leg-
islation on the House floor absent of 
any committee consideration. 
Mr. Speaker, American families and 
childcare providers across the Nation 
deserve better than the legislation be-
fore us. I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the Democrats’ no care for children 
act, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
and 
friend, 
Congresswoman 
ROSA 
DELAURO, for her work in support of 
children, families, and childcare pro-
viders. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Child Care Is Essential Act. 
Access to affordable childcare is crit-
ical to working families in helping our 
economy recover from the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Without childcare, parents cannot re-
turn to work, businesses cannot re-
open, and young children cannot access 
invaluable early learning opportuni-
ties. 
At this moment, the childcare indus-
try stands at the brink of collapse. 
Childcare providers already struggled 
financially before the pandemic. Now, 
dramatically 
low 
revenue 
and 
in-
creased operating costs are pushing 
providers towards permanent closures. 
In fact, the COVID–19 pandemic has 
already cost the jobs of roughly one in 
four childcare workers, and researchers 
estimate that we could permanently 
lose up to 4.5 million childcare slots. 
The pandemic has already impacted 
the lives of parents, 13 percent of whom 
have had to lower their work hours or 
quit their jobs entirely due to difficul-
ties in childcare. 
Our constituents are calling us to 
take action. A recent survey found 
that more than 8 in 10 voters across the 
political spectrums favor a substantial 
Federal investment in childcare. We 
must save the childcare system, which 
is critical for working families, our 
economy, and the healthy development 
of our Nation’s children. We can do 
that by voting in favor of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise in support of H.R. 7027, the Child 
Care is Essential Act, a critical effort that I 
have proudly cosponsored, as child care pro-
viders have been among the hardest hit by the 
economic turmoil caused by this public health 
emergency. At least half of all providers have 
been forced to close at some point during this 
pandemic, and almost a quarter of child care 
staff have lost their jobs. 
The Child Care is Essential Act will estab-
lish and provide $50 billion for the Child Care 
Stabilization Fund, so that grants can be 
awarded to child care providers during and 
after this COVID–19 pandemic. Child care pro-
viders that are currently open or temporarily 
closed due to this pandemic are eligible to re-
ceive this funding, which will be calculated by

the provider’s operating costs before COVID– 
19 and adjusted for the increased costs of 
providing child care now. These providers will 
be able to use this stabilization funding for nu-
merous activities, including personnel costs, 
personal protection equipment, training for 
health and safety practices, mental health sup-
ports for children and staff, and fixed costs. 
As a Congress, we must stabilize our critical 
child care infrastructure, as they play a critical 
role in ensuring that our working families are 
not forced to make difficult decisions regarding 
reduction in work hours or loss of employ-
ment. For our nation to recover economically 
from this pandemic, we must strengthen the 
child care providers that enable our economy 
to function. 
In Texas, our providers, families, and com-
munities deserve this federal support. The 
Center for American Progress has estimated 
that my state will lose 54% of its child care 
supply and 483,632 licensed child care slots 
without adequate federal assistance, and this 
loss will be monumental in its impact. If this 
Congress can push the Child Care is Essential 
Act into law, Texas will receive an estimated 
amount of $5,372,096,736 from the $50 billion 
Child Care Stabilization Fund through alloca-
tions to my state. 
As representatives of Americans from all 
corners of our country, we have a responsi-
bility to protect the livelihood and well-being of 
our families and communities, especially dur-
ing this moment of national upheaval caused 
by this novel coronavirus. On behalf of my 
home state of Texas, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 7027. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1053, 
the previous question is ordered on the

Mrs. RODGERS of Washington (dur-
ing the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to dispense with 
the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS) is recog-
nized for 5 minutes in support of her 
motion. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, as we heard in the debate 
today, we all agree keeping children 
safe and healthy is our top priority. 
For people to get back to work, par-
ents need childcare; they need safe op-
tions and more flexibility for the care 
of their children. That is why Repub-
licans have introduced sensible legisla-
tion that supports all childcare pro-
viders so that we can expand access to 
childcare to pre-COVID levels and be-
yond. 
However, unlike our solution, there 
are problems with the majority’s un-
derlying bill that limits parents’ abil-
ity to find care. 
The underlying bill won’t help busi-
nesses start up new childcare options; 
it won’t help smaller childcare pro-
viders, often women- and minority- 
owned businesses, reopen or finally ac-
complish their dream of starting their 
own business. 
As a result, this bill will prevent 
more providers from opening. That is a 
serious problem, especially in places 
where shutdowns and stay-home orders 
force providers to permanently close. 
That means parents will have nowhere 
to turn if new options aren’t available, 
if they want a smaller setting for 
childcare, or if large childcare centers 
hit caps on enrollment. 
To fix this, my motion helps a new 
childcare business start and increases 
the number of available childcare slots 
for children. It would amend the under-
lying text to ensure that all providers 
are able to access funding, including 
those that have recently opened to sup-
port working parents. 
Republicans weren’t provided the 
chance to debate adding these provi-
sions to the bill because the majority 
seems to be more interested in scoring 
political points these days than actu-
ally working together to solve prob-
lems. 
Another issue they didn’t address 
today is child safety. While we talked 
about adhering to new recommended 
sanitation and social distancing re-
quirements—all critical—there was no 
discussion of keeping children safe 
from abuse, neglect, and violence. My 
motion will ensure we are focused on 
recognizing and addressing child abuse 
and neglect. 
Many of us in this Chamber have 
raised the alarm that the stress, the 
isolation, the fear caused by COVID–19 
has increased the threat of abuse and 
domestic violence. The numbers are 
alarming. 
b 1230 
This amendment to the underlying 
bill requires anyone receiving funding 
in this program to provide an assur-
ance that all their employees have 
completed education on safety proto-
cols and know how to recognize child 
abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a mom of three 
school-aged kids, and this spring was 
difficult for them and their mom and 
dad. I am speaking every day with 
hardworking men and women who want 
to keep their families healthy, who are 
eager to get back to work and eager to 
get their kids back in school and in 
daycare. 
There is a lot of fear about children 
losing an entire year of their education 
if we don’t get back on track. There 
are concerns about parents, parents in 
Pend Oreille County in my district, 
where 14,000 people live and work in in-
dustries like mining, timber, tourism, 
and 
healthcare. 
Even 
before 
coronavirus hit, there was only one 
childcare provider in the entire coun-
ty—just one. 
While there have been less than 40 
cases of coronavirus in Pend Oreille, 
they have been hit hard by economic 
shutdowns and stay-at-home orders. 
This community deserves every chance 
to come back stronger than before. 
For counties like Pend Oreille, and 
for places that have been hit hardest 
by the virus, we can’t afford to be lim-
iting parents’ choices. We need to give 
parents more control and the ability to 
navigate this new future, a future 
where we have the confidence to pro-
vide for our families and the courage to 
dream again because our kids are safe, 
healthy, and learning. 
For more options in child safety, this 
amendment should have been part of 
the underlying bill. I ask the majority 
to recognize that they missed this crit-
ical issue. Now is the time to correct 
them. 
I urge bipartisan support, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to the motion to re-
commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Connecticut is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, let me 
first start by saying that licensed pro-
viders already receive this training, 
that licensed providers already are 
equipped for identifying abuse and re-
porting abuse. Now is not the time to 
focus on startups.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3908 
July 29, 2020 
Today, I ask my colleagues to sup-
port childcare providers who need help 
now, to not allow these pillars in our 
community to go bankrupt, to prevent 
our most vulnerable children from be-
coming 
disconnected 
from 
their 
childcare providers and centers. 
Every working parent in this room 
and around the country knows the feel-
ing of vulnerability that comes with 
trusting your children in the hands of 
someone in order to support your fam-
ily. 
Every working parent in this room 
and around the country knows the 
sense of helplessness that comes when 
that critical care is in jeopardy and 
your family is left scrambling for an 
alternative. That feeling of helpless-
ness is what parents across the country 
are facing right now in the middle of a 
global pandemic as childcare centers 
have closed their doors, many of them 
permanently. 
Coronavirus has had a devastating ef-
fect 
on 
childcare 
providers. 
Since 
March, almost a quarter of providers 
have lost their jobs, and as many as 
two out of five centers have recently 
indicated that they will go out of busi-
ness without financial support. 4.5 mil-
lion childcare slots are at risk of dis-
appearing, including over 46,000 in my 
own home State of Connecticut. That 
is 4.5 million working families who will 
be left behind without childcare. 
It is frustrating to see my colleagues 
acting in such bad faith here today, at-
tempting to sabotage a commonsense 
plan that would help Americans get 
back to work, that would help working 
parents and children in their States as 
well as mine. 
Let us talk about what the bill actu-
ally does. The Child Care Is Essential 
Act provides $50 billion in grant fund-
ing within CCDBG for providers to re-
open and stay open safely. As part of 
receiving these grants, the bill requires 
all providers to commit to employ and 
pay their employees at pre-COVID–19 
levels and to provide families with re-
lief in the cost of care. 
H.R. 7027 requires providers to follow 
the CDC guidance and local authorities 
to keep children and staff safe. 
Yes, follow the science to keep chil-
dren safe. 
Childcare is not a partisan issue, or 
it should not be. Nine out of 10 Ameri-
cans support a relief package like the 
Child 
Care 
Is 
Essential 
Act. 
Our 
childcare industry enables millions of 
Americans to go back to work and will 
help millions of parents fully return to 
the workforce when the pandemic 
passes. 
We cannot calculate the revenue of 
this industry without considering the 
impact it has on the total overall econ-
omy. 
As a body, and in a bipartisan way, 
we supported $50 billion in relief to the 
airline industry. As a body, in a bipar-
tisan way, we supported $670 billion, 
without restrictions, to the restaurant 
industry to save those businesses. 
In 
all 
of 
these 
relief 
packages, 
childcare workers and providers were 
left behind. We all talk about the need 
to reopen the economy, but that can’t 
happen without the necessary funding 
to 
ensure 
the 
sustainability 
of 
childcare providers. 
As the pandemic continues to race 
through this country due to this ad-
ministration’s failed response, parents 
who are called back to work have to 
make a difficult decision: either send 
their child back to a childcare center 
or stay home and lose wages or poten-
tially their jobs. 
Show me your budget, and I will 
show you your values. That is some-
thing that I often say. If we will not 
make childcare resources a line item in 
our budget, we cannot claim it is our 
national priority. 
My colleagues have a habit of saying 
they agree with the Democratic pro-
posal on the issue of childcare. But 
when it is time to make any invest-
ments, they retreat. ‘‘It is not a good 
use of taxpayer dollars,’’ is what they 
often say. 
I remind you here today that the 
American families who are asking for 
this help are the taxpayers. 
In case there is any doubt here today, 
Republicans have made it abundantly 
clear to the American people that they 
would rather use taxpayer dollars to 
bail out private industry than support 
America’s working families and their 
children. 
House Democrats are here to work 
for the people, here today to address 
the childcare crisis in this country, 
something that my colleagues should 
get serious about fast. 
I encourage you all to join us in in-
vesting in high-quality childcare and 
the industry that helps to make that 
happen. 
Even as a high school teacher, it was 
always evident to me which students 
attended high-quality childcare cen-
ters. 
Their 
language, 
socialization 
skills, problem-solving skills, and in-
creased parental involvement were al-
ways evident. We have to support 
childcare. It is essential. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the

The SPEAKER Pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.

shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally 
divided among and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations and

ber of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. LOWEY), the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GRANGER), the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), and 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY) 
each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
offer H.R. 7327, the Child Care for Eco-
nomic Recovery Act, which I intro-
duced with our exceptional Labor, 
Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies Sub-

chairwoman, 
ROSA 
DELAURO; our esteemed Appropriations 
Committee colleague, Congresswoman 
CLARK; and our Ways and Means col-
leagues, Chairman NEAL, Chairman 
DAVIS, and Congresswoman SA´ NCHEZ. 
It 
is 
no 
secret, 
with 
quality 
childcare, children enter kindergarten 
ready to learn; hardworking families 
have better job security, knowing their 
children are healthy and safe; and our 
communities thrive. 
But even before COVID–19, millions 
of hardworking families, disproportion-
ately families of color, struggled to 
find and afford quality care that 
matched their work hours and ZIP 
Codes. 
At the height of the pandemic, more 
than half of childcare providers—many 
of them women, minority-owned small 
businesses 
operating 
on 
razor-thin 
margins—closed their doors. We risk 
losing more permanently. 
Every single industry counts on 
childcare. In order to save our econ-
omy, we need to save childcare.

Invest $10 billion in new infrastruc-
ture grants so providers have the re-
sources to address hazardous condi-
tions like broken heaters, mold, and 
lead paint, as well as necessary modi-
fications to protect our children and 
caretakers 
from 
the 
risk 
of 
coronavirus; 
Reimburse child and dependent care 
costs incurred by essential workers 
who have sacrificed so much to keep us 
safe; 
Make the child and dependent care 
tax credit fully refundable for the first 
time; keep the lights on and doors open 
with a new tax credit for childcare pro-
viders to help cover costs for rent, 
mortgages, and utilities; and 
Recognize childcare workers as es-
sential. 
What is good for our babies is good 
for our budget. With this bill, we can 
do what is good for our babies and the 
budget. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 7327. 
American parents want and need reli-
able and safe childcare options for 
their children while they are at work. 
Access to childcare is especially impor-
tant for those on the front lines ad-
dressing the coronavirus. Providers 
face many new challenges during this 
pandemic as they seek to understand 
new regulations and provide a healthy 
environment for the children in their 
care. 
Unfortunately, instead of helping 
American families and childcare pro-
viders, this bill misses the mark. The 
bill includes an increase of more than 
$7 billion in childcare funds, even 
though we know the CARES Act fund-
ing still has not been made to some 
providers who need it. 
There are also no safeguards to ac-
company the changes that are made to 
the child and dependent care tax cred-
it. We saw with the rollout of the Pay-
check Protection Program just how 
important it is to ensure programs are 
targeted and tailored to help those who 
need it most. 
Finally, programs for children have 
had a long history of bipartisan sup-
port, so I am disappointed to see that 
end today. We need to take a step back 
and ensure that any bill we pass ad-
dresses the problem without creating 
more bureaucratic red tape for the 
childcare industry. 
We 
must 
support 
parents 
and 
childcare providers so that they can 
get our economy up and running again. 
Instead of passing partisan bills made 
behind closed doors, we should be 
working together with the administra-
tion on a proposal that can be signed 
into law. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. 
HAALAND). 
Ms. 
HAALAND. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
childcare is a vital part of economic re-
covery. 
I know what it is like to struggle to 
make ends meet as a parent. I raised 
my daughter, Somah, on my own. And 
as a single mother working my way 
through law school, it was very hard to 
find childcare. In fact, I could never af-
ford childcare. 
When she was 2, I found a preschool 
where I could volunteer in exchange for 
lower tuition so that she would have a 
place to learn while I worked. It was 
helpful and shows just how much New 
Mexicans are willing to support each 
other. But that should not be the re-
ality for parents and kids across the 
country. 
During the pandemic, our State has 
helped childcare providers stay open by 
paying licensed providers a premium, 
but many of them still had to lay off 
employees because fewer children were 
showing up. 
As we look to a future when more 
parents get back to working outside 
their home, the childcare industry 
needs Federal support to safely adapt 
to the new normal and welcome fami-
lies and employees back. That is why I 
am supporting the Child Care for Eco-
nomic Recovery Act. 
This bill funds upgrades in childcare 
centers that are needed to meet new 
health and safety measures for the pan-
demic; it provides refundable tax cred-
its for parents to return to their jobs; 
and, most importantly, it ensures a 
satisfactory, affordable, and guaran-
teed future for the childcare industry. 
Madam Speaker, by investing in the 
childcare industry, we invest in our 
economic future. I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY). 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Chairwoman LOWEY for 
her leadership on this important piece 
of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, already in this 
country, the skyrocketing cost of 
childcare was solidifying deep eco-
nomic and racial inequities that have 
plagued us for decades. 
Already, 
many 
childcare 
workers 
were living in poverty because astro-
nomical tuition rates are not enough 
to pay teachers the salary that they 
deserve. 
Already, working moms and dads 
pause promising careers because their 
wages 
didn’t 
match 
the 
cost 
of 
childcare. 
Already, inability to find childcare 
locked many parents out of the work-
force altogether. 
And already, children were denied ac-
cess to high-quality early learning pro-
grams because of a broken childcare 
system. 
Then COVID–19 completely obliter-
ated a faulty system for parents, for 
childcare providers, for educators, and 
for children. 
Providers are going out of business 
completely, which will make it even 
harder for parents to find the childcare 
that they need. Costs will skyrocket as 
class sizes shrink. State budgets that 
are already stretched thin will un-
doubtedly decide childcare is dispen-
sable, despite big talk about how essen-
tial it is to our economic recovery. 
Madam Speaker, we will look back at 
this moment and regret that we are 
not doing more because, ultimately, 
this decision will leave families with 
young children behind. This is a deci-
sion to hollow out an entire generation 
of parents’ employment stability and 
economic opportunity. 
We have a decision as to whether to 
widen the achievement gap, because 
our children will not be going to pre-
school programs that set them up to 
thrive over the long term. It is a deci-
sion to perpetuate systemic racism, be-
cause it is Black and Latinx women 
who are suffering the most from our 
failure to act decisively. 
Madam Speaker, we need to pass this 
bill, 
and 
then 
we 
need 
universal 
childcare. 
I want to thank the chair for her 
leadership. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I am enthusiasti-
cally supporting this bill. Childcare is 
essential for every woman who has ever 
raised children with the struggling 
days that she manages to work and 
take care of the children, so I am a 
very strong supporter of this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the Committee on Appropria-
tions has expired. 
The gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL) and the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. REED) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we are considering 
H.R. 7327, the Child Care for Economic 
Recovery Act, which I introduced with 
my friend and colleague Chairwoman 
LOWEY, as well as Representatives 
DAVIS, CLARK, DELAURO, and SANCHEZ. 
This legislation is particularly im-
portant as our country continues to 
face a national emergency. All around 
America, our constituents, are strug-
gling to cope with the consequences of 
the 
pandemic, 
consequences 
made 
worse because of the policies of this 
current administration. 
People have lost loved ones and live-
lihoods. Many faced obstacles to work-
ing: pandemic restrictions and health 
conditions that make them vulnerable 
to COVID and, for millions of families, 
a lack of reasonable childcare options. 
Today, we have the opportunity to 
help Americans overcome one of the 
hurdles to work. By supporting mean-
ingful childcare relief, we can go a long 
way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3915 
July 29, 2020 
Even 
before 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, our Nation’s 
childcare system was strained. Millions 
of families had trouble finding quality 
dependent care, and when they did 
manage to locate it, they often discov-
ered long waiting lists and out-of-reach 
prices. 
As it has with so many other pre-
existing challenges, the pandemic has 
greatly intensified the stress on our 
childcare system. Now, daycare facili-
ties are closing. 
In April, the National Association for 
the Education of Young Children con-
ducted a survey of more than 5,000 pro-
viders and learned that nearly half had 
completely closed. The Center for 
American 
Progress 
estimates 
that, 
without Federal support, the pandemic 
could result in the loss of 4.5 million 
childcare slots, which is almost half 
the national capacity. 
Last week, I spoke with a group of 
working mothers. One told me that she 
fears we are at risk of losing a genera-
tion of working parents. Others empha-
sized how terrifying their situations 
are and how they lack choices that are 
needed to continue their careers and 
protect their children. Their words 
echo what we have heard from con-
stituents all over this country. 
Today’s bill tackles these problems 
through a combination of tax relief for 
parents and childcare providers, grants 
to States, and support for essential 
workers and their childcare needs. 
Specifically, it will double the child 
and dependent care tax credit and, for 
the first time, make it fully refundable 
so that low-income parents can access 
it like everyone else. It also establishes 
a 
refundable 
tax 
credit 
to 
help 
childcare providers cover their fixed 
costs. 
It will help parents carry over their 
dependent care flexible spending ac-
count contributions to next year and 
expand the employee retention tax 
credit, which is so important to help 
employers of domestic workers retain 
those employees. 
This bill triples the guaranteed Fed-
eral childcare funding from $2.9 billion 
to $10 billion a year for the next 5 
years. It suspends State match require-
ments and will also help more low- and 
middle-income families afford care. 
In sum, I want to say to the parents 
of this country: We have heard you 
loudly and clearly. This childcare cri-
sis is untenable, and it is pushing many 
of you to the breaking point. Nothing 
cuts deeper than worry over kids’ safe-
ty and well-being, and the choices you 
face are simply too hard. You need and 
deserve help accessing safe and afford-
able care for your kids, and your abil-
ity to obtain it is an essential pre-
condition of helping the economy move 
forward and helping it to grow in the 
future. 
This bill provides unprecedented Fed-
eral support for childcare because we 
are all in this together, and we have 
got your back. 
Madam Speaker, I urge our col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we agree. Families 
need access to childcare. It is key to 
making America’s recovery stronger. 
Childcare is an economic, education, 
and public health issue that demands 
our full attention, particularly now 
that millions of Americans want to re-
turn to work. 
Unfortunately, this crisis has hit 
childcare providers across the country 
especially hard. Many are facing an 
acute set of financial challenges. We 
must address this problem in a bipar-
tisan manner if we are to ensure our 
Nation’s children and the working fam-
ilies that support them are not left be-
hind during this crisis. 
Unfortunately, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle today have de-
cided to throw bipartisanship out the 
window, knowing that by doing so they 
are dooming their own legislation. 
They have once again shut us out of 
the process and crafted a bill that is 
out of touch with America’s needs. 
This is no more than a copy-paste of 
various Democratic childcare proposals 
superficially edited to link to the pan-
demic. 
This bill contains six childcare tax 
provisions that, combined, would cost 
more than $100 billion. Simply throw-
ing as much money as you can at the 
problem with no thought into the ac-
tual policy itself won’t work. These 
provisions haven’t been through our 
regular order in the committee of ju-
risdiction. This package has not been 
the subject of a single committee hear-
ing, let alone, a committee markup. 
It is abundantly clear, Democrats 
were so eager to achieve a messaging 
victory, they felt they could skip the 
whole policymaking process that is 
fundamental to how Congress is sup-
posed to work. We have been down this 
road before. In multiple States, the ad-
ditional childcare funding we have al-
ready provided through the CARES Act 
still has not made its way down to 
childcare providers on the ground. 
In my home State of New York, one 
of my constituents, Beth Starks, testi-
fied in front of the New York State As-
sembly on childcare issues. She high-
lighted that of the $164.6 million in 
Childcare Development Block Grants 
for New York State, less than half have 
gone out to the communities and pro-
viders who needed it yesterday. 
Her testimony also underscores the 
negative impact State leaders, like our 
Governor, have had by withholding 
Federal grants to families and pro-
viders. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a copy of her testimony. 
TESTIMONY
OF BETH STARKS, FOUNDER
AND 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CHAUTAUQUA LAKE 
CHILD CARE CENTER 
Before The NYS Assembly, Standing Com-
mittee on Small Business, Standing Com-
mittee on Ways and Means, Standing Com-
mittee on Agriculture, Standing Com-
mittee on Banks, Office of State-Federal 
Relations, Task Force on Food, Farm & 
Nutrition Policy 
Good morning! Thank you for inviting me 
to testify today. I am Beth Starks, the 
founder and Executive Director of Chau-
tauqua Lake Child Care Center. 
I am a third-generation Early Childhood 
Educator and have experience in everything 
from infant rooms all the way up through 
higher education. I am proud to serve on 
both the Governor’s Early Childhood Advi-
sory Council and the Child Care Availability 
Task Force. I come to you today to speak 
about child care as a small business. Below, 
in my written testimony, you will find links 
to a lot of statistics and additional informa-
tion on the topics that I will be discussing 
today. 
I know that time is of the essence and I am 
making an appeal to all of you. I come to 
you as the founder of a non-profit child care 
center and a supporter of public education. I 
come to you as a leader, a public servant and 
a voice for children and families. Other small 
businesses, and families need your help now 
by supporting childcare providers. Our small 
businesses are especially strained right now 
when it comes to their workforce. Workers 
need child care to do their jobs. I implore 
you to ensure more decisive steps are taken 
in NYS to assist families in paying for child 
care and to safeguard the safety and health 
of child care providers and the families they 
serve. We need you to ensure that New 
York’s child care providers are ready and 
able to play their vital role in restarting the 
economy as we emerge from this pandemic. 
In the past months, I have listened to our 
Governor and to many other leaders talk 
about the reality of this situation. We know 
this is a situation like no other, and there 
was nothing we could have planned for. We 
are building the plane as we fly it and we 
have true budgetary constraints. I do under-
stand that NYS has had the most cases and 
the most deaths. The health and medical cri-
sis and the medical decisions needed to come 
first. I understand that the decisions involv-
ing child care needed to come a little bit 
later. Yet child care providers are essential 
and have been on the front-line providing 
care for children of essential workers so that 
they can do their jobs—as nurses, doctors, 
law enforcement, and so on. Child care pro-
viders have allowed essential workers to 
work every day knowing that their children 
are healthy, safe and happy. I come to you 
today 
frustrated, 
heartbroken, 
sad, 
ex-
hausted, scared, discouraged and so close to 
giving up. I am frustrated at the lack of sup-
port, the lack of supplies and the lack of fi-
nancial resources. I am heartbroken. Heart-
broken for the child care facilities that have 
already closed, most never to reopen. I am 
heartbroken for the mom of the 9-week-old 
who just started in my care on Good Friday 
as she had to return to work as an essential 
worker. I’m sad for the staff that I have lost, 
for the parents crying in my office because 
they can’t afford child care. I am scared for 
my business of 14 years that I am trying to 
keep afloat and I am scared for every child 
care provider and for our industry. I am dis-
couraged at the lack of acknowledgement 
and awareness of the importance of Early 
Childhood and the lack of investment in 
children. 
First of all, I want all of you to understand 
that child care is a business that supports all

other small businesses. We are an essential 
business that has remained open throughout 
the COVID–19 emergency. By doing so, we 
have allowed all other small businesses (as 
well as all other industries) to remain open 
and now to re-open. So, all of your medical 
providers, restaurant workers, hospital staff 
and even farm workers have child care (& 
workers) thanks to our centers. As men-
tioned by our previous speaker, a farm needs 
workers in order to operate, there are child 
care centers that specifically serve migrant 
workers. Child care is an industry that is dif-
ferent from other small businesses because 
we enable other small businesses to operate. 
I chose to begin my verbal testimony by 
telling a few stories. The things that I told 
included: why I started my child care facil-
ity, the problems that child care had pre- 
COVID and what we’ve gone through during 
this COVID–19 Pandemic. I founded my cen-
ter as a non-profit 14 years ago while I was 
working at SUNY Fredonia in the Education 
Department. While I was there, I had my 
first son (who just turned 16) and could not 
find child care for him. I brought him with 
me to Fredonia every day and I found an in-
credible in-home child care provider for him. 
Soon, I decided to stop working at the col-
lege and became a licensed in-home child 
care provider myself. In NYS, an in-home li-
censed day care facility is also a small busi-
ness and there are a lot of them in WNY and 
across the state. After having my in-home 
facility for two years, realizing the need for 
child care in Mayville was so great, I then 
became incorporated and opened my center. 
Chautauqua Lake Child Care Center (CLCCC) 
provides care and education for over 100 chil-
dren ages 6 weeks to 12 years. CLCCC is a 
non-profit child care center leasing space in-
side Chautauqua Lake Central School. The 
partnership with the public school allows 
families to drop off & pick up their children 
all in one place. We provide full time care, 
part time care, UPK, before school and after 
school programming as well as a full day 
summer camp for school aged children. We 
also employ 11 full time staff and 10–15 part 
time staff, depending on the time of year. 
I’ve also been a part of a lot of initiatives 
in our County and across NYS. I serve on our 
Education Coalition here in Chautauqua 
County where we focus on bringing together 
educators & industries to meet the needs of 
the County. I lead the K-readiness subgroup 
where we focus on young children specifi-
cally. Our Education Coalition has had a lot 
of efforts county-wide to try to support child 
care. We started an initiative in the City of 
Dunkirk, as there are no licensed child care 
centers in the City of Dunkirk. Initially, 
Mayor Willie Rosas called together a Busi-
ness Roundtable, focused on child care. It 
was his most well attended roundtable dis-
cussion, which demonstrates the need for 
child care in the area. Our County Executive 
at the time, George Borrello, now a NYS 
Senator, made child care a county-wide pri-
ority. He recognized how important child 
care is as an industry and how inter-
connected it is to businesses and economic 
development. Last year, then-County Execu-
tive Borrello (in collaboration with the City 
of Dunkirk, private sector business, the 
County Chamber, and the County Planning 
office and also with the help and support of 
Assemblyman Andrew Goodell) was able to 
apply for some funding through the Gov-
ernor’s Workforce Development Initiative/ 
Economic Development Council to work on 
obtaining additional funding for child care. 
Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in ob-
taining funding, even though it was greatly 
needed. My point is that child care was in a 
crisis situation here, preventing people from 
going to work, pre-COVID. We are in what’s 
called a child care desert because there isn’t 
enough child care here in Chautauqua Coun-
ty (or in much of NYS). According to the 
Center for American Progress, 64 percent of 
New Yorkers lived in a child care desert (be-
fore the Pandemic), which means that there 
are more than 50 children under the age of 5 
in a census tract that contains either no 
child care providers or so few options that 
there are more than three times as many 
children as licensed child care slots. 
The past 3 months, the situation has got-
ten much worse. Over 50% of my colleagues 
in Chautauqua County have closed their 
doors. Nationally, it is estimated that about 
1⁄2 of them will never open again. We cannot 
re-open our county or NY without child care 
because there is nowhere for children to go 
and that includes children from infants all 
the way up through the teenage years. 
We’re an industry that needs financial sup-
port. My colleagues will tell you that they 
stayed open during COVID because it was 
what was right for children and families. I 
will tell you that we all made poor business 
decisions because we operated our businesses 
by leading with our hearts, instead of mak-
ing financially-based decisions. We are all 
fulfilling our mission in serving children and 
families. We remained open serving on the 
front lines, but every single day we are open 
we continue to lose money and there is very 
little support. I was fortunate enough to be 
able to get the PPP (Paycheck Protection 
Plan) and I will tell you my story in being 
able to do so. I had to find the only lender in 
Chautauqua County that was able to allow 
me to apply for a PPP loan; there was only 
one. I searched all weekend to find the lender 
and it was KeyBank. The manager let me 
call her on a Sunday and come to meet with 
her first thing on a Monday morning to open 
an account with her. None of the other lend-
ers would let me apply and/or open an ac-
count with them. Once I was able to open an 
account, we were able to apply for the PPP 
and were thankfully approved. If you look at 
child care centers statewide, I was told that 
only 10% received the PPP, and that’s just 
for the centers. None of the in-home pro-
viders were eligible because they are sole 
proprietors. So, the PPP money has only 
helped a few of us. The EIDL (Economic In-
jury Disaster Loan) money I was able to 
apply for, but I was denied. I don’t know the 
rationale behind it, but we just received the 
email that told us we were not eligible for 
that funding. As far as federal funding, there 
was CARES Act money that was set aside for 
child care federally and we were really ex-
cited because we were told we would receive 
$164.6 million in NYS specifically for child 
care, but we have yet to receive that fund-
ing. Of that $164.6 million in CARES funding, 
only $30 million was allocated, $20 million 
was designated for scholarships for families 
(the scholarship only assists families making 
up to 300% of the poverty level and luckily in 
Chautauqua County we were already serving 
that population. So, very few families here 
were able to take advantage of this money.) 
and $8 million for supplies. We are so thank-
ful for the supplies, which just came this 
past Saturday. Beyond that there has been 
no help directly to child care facilities. The 
biggest need is purely financial. We need 
working capital. Most of the remaining pro-
viders in Chautauqua County literally have 
weeks left until they too close their doors. 
We cannot look at supporting childcare as 
a ‘‘subsidy’’. It is truly an investment in eco-
nomic development and infrastructure. We 
cannot rebuild our economy without an in-
vestment 
in 
something 
as 
critical 
as 
childcare. 
In closing, I will tell you that there are 
also bright spots. In the beginning, I spoke 
about feeling frustrated, heartbroken, ex-
hausted, scared, discouraged and so close to 
giving up. Well, I also come to you energized, 
inspired, hopeful and encouraged and deter-
mined to never to give up. I am energized by 
my insightful colleagues, in my community, 
across the state and across the nation. I am 
energized by my staff who are incredible and 
dedicated and selfless. I am energized by my 
students who are the future educators. I am 
inspired by my community coming together 
in a way that it never has and bridging di-
vides. I am hopeful for our future and a 
chance to fix all of this. I am encouraged by 
the hard-working families, the families 
struggling to go to work every day to pro-
vide the best opportunities for their chil-
dren. I am encouraged by the child I sat with 
yesterday talking about the people he loves 
and I am encouraged with the knowledge 
that he is healthy, happy and safe in our 
care. 
This issue to me is not political. It is very 
much bipartisan and I believe that we have 
to all come together to support children and 
families. In doing so, we support our eco-
nomic infrastructure and the future of our 
state. If we aren’t making decisions based on 
what is best for our youngest citizens, then 
we are doing a disservice to our entire popu-
lation. 
So, I offer to you my assistance as part of 
the solution. I trust your leadership. I trust 
your judgement. Families and providers need 
to be heard. They need your support and 
they need it now. I recognize the need for 
funding and the CARES Act allows emer-
gency federal funds to be used to provide 
child care to the essential worker keeping us 
safe and to every other worker trying to go 
back to work. We need to follow the lead of 
many other states around the country and 
use that funding immediately to assist fami-
lies and providers. We need additional fund-
ing for child care in the next round of 
CARES relief from the federal government. 
There are also so many other sources of 
funding that could be used for child care in 
our state. We need to do innovative things 
like use FEMA dollars, community develop-
ment block grant funds, and economic devel-
opment money to invest in child care. We 
have to try to find other funding sources and 
make NYS the leader in early childhood edu-
cation during this time and in the future. 
I will always believe every challenge is an 
opportunity and we have the opportunity 
now to do the right thing for our current 
workforce and for our state’s youngest citi-
zens, our future. 
Thank you for your time. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, up until 
now, Republicans and Democrats have 
consistently worked together to pro-
vide additional support for childcare. 
Again, this is an issue we fundamen-
tally all agree on. 
On the Committee on Ways and 
Means, we have demonstrated time and 
time again our commitment to improv-
ing access to high quality childcare. 
That is why we are disappointed today. 
Today’s vote is a wasted opportunity. 
I started today by saying we all care 
deeply about childcare. As COVID con-
tinues to disrupt American life, that 
focus has only grown. As co-chair of 
the Problem Solvers Caucus, I can tell 
you we are committed to reaching 
across the aisle and actively looking 
for issues where we can come together 
to find common ground. 
Leader MCCARTHY has further made 
clear 
his 
support 
for 
prioritizing 
childcare as part of COVID relief and 
more than 40 Republican Members, in-
cluding myself, echoed that support in 
a letter to leadership.

In addition, Republicans have intro-
duced a number of bills that include 
smart provisions, such as the bills in-
troduced by my colleagues, Represent-
ative WALORSKI
of Indiana and Mr. 
WENSTRUP of Ohio. 
Earlier this week, we led the intro-
duction of a bill called the Back to 
Work Child Care Grants Act of 2020 to 
support working families, advance our 
Nation’s economic recovery, and help 
those parents who want to go back to 
work. The bill provides a framework 
for childcare providers to access the re-
sources they need to reopen and stay 
open. We are proud that we were able 
to make this bill bipartisan because we 
care about getting results, not head-
lines. 
Thanks to the leadership of folks like 
Senator ERNST and Senator ALEXANDER 
in the U.S. Senate, this proposal has a 
real chance of moving forward. 
Clearly, 
there 
is 
some 
common 
ground and shared goals among us, but 
Democrats have skipped regular order 
and any semblance of meaningful bi-
partisan discussion and compromise. 
There is an important role for Congress 
to play in alleviating the economic 
stress COVID has placed on American 
families. To the reasonable Members of 
my colleagues across the aisle, come 
work with us. Our door is always open. 
Until you do, Congress will continue to 
waste these good opportunities of good 
will to bring the American people to-
gether. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, in the 
spirit of bipartisanship, the RECORD 
should note that the second to the gen-
tleman’s request came from the Demo-
cratic side. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
DANNY
K. DAVIS), chairman of the 
Worker 
and 
Family 
Support 
Sub-
committee, and original cosponsor of 
this legislation. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely believe 
that the best way to evaluate the effec-
tiveness and greatness of a society is 
by how well it treats its old, how well 
it treats its young, and what it does for 
those who have difficulty caring for 
themselves. 
Childcare is one of the most essential 
needs that exists in our community. 
And I have just heard my colleague say 
$100 billion helps to put childcare on 
the map. I know individuals who work 
in the childcare industry who cannot 
put their own children in the programs 
that they work for because they earn 
so little. 
Madam Speaker, if we are to move 
America as we confront the pandemic, 
as we deal with racism, as we deal with 
structures that have kept disadvan-
taged people and communities dis-
advantaged, nothing would do it better 
than making sure that every individual 
who needs childcare will have it avail-
able. 
Madam Speaker, events of the past few 
months have shown the need for policies to 
strengthen child well-being as thousands of 
youth across America marched and dem-
onstrated as they challenged our systems of 
social, educational and economic justice. 
Child care powers both family economic 
well-being and our national economic growth. 
Prior to the pandemic, federal funding only 
provided child care for one in six eligible chil-
dren. And parents in communities weighed 
down by poverty and systemic racism experi-
enced a shortage of high-quality, affordable 
child care. 
Today, we face a global pandemic that has 
disproportionately infected and killed people in 
these same struggling communities, and the 
child care crisis we had before is now much, 
much worse. Now, parents have lost millions 
of additional child care options, and providers 
confront new costs to keep children and work-
ers safe, risking financial losses for busi-
nesses already operating on the knife’s edge 
of profitability. 
In Illinois, nearly half of all previously avail-
able child care slots are at risk of disappearing 
altogether due to the pandemic, and sixty per-
cent of child care programs are fully-closed. In 
Chicago, we did not have much to lose. Pre- 
pandemic, five out of six Chicago children 
lived in a ‘‘child care desert’’ where children 
outnumbered child care slots by 3 to 1, or 
more. 
The high cost of quality child care dispropor-
tionately affects Black families because Black 
children are disproportionately likely to live in 
homes with only working parents, but Black 
working parents earn 40 percent less, on aver-
age, than white working parents. For workers 
with low wages, work is impossible without 
child care subsidies, and difficult even with as-
sistance. Latinx and Black workers are more 
likely to work nonstandard schedules than 
their peers, which often makes child care 
harder to find and more expensive. Moreover, 
people of color are disproportionately rep-
resented in the child care workforce. About 40 
percent of the child care workforce are people 
of color who are concentrated in low-level po-
sitions with lower credential requirements and 
relatively low pay. The child care workforce 
alone is 94% female and 40% persons of 
color. Latinas—who represent 15% of all work-
ers—comprise 21% of child care workers, and 
Black women represent 15% of all child care 
workers. These data demonstrate that pro-
tecting the child care industry is key to both 
economic priority and racial equity. 
As states lift stay-at-home orders and other 
economic restrictions, more parents are re-
turning to work, if they can. Quality, affordable 
child care is a cornerstone of parents’ ability to 
work and move up the economic ladder. I 
know essential workers who couldn’t work be-
cause they had no one to watch their kids. I 
know parents who have lost so much income 
that they can’t afford child care to work. 
As a Black man living in Chicago, I have 
grieved at far too many funerals for friends 
lost to COVID–19, and I know far too many 
parents who legitimately fear for their family’s 
health when they return to work and their chil-
dren go back to child care. When I see the 
devastation caused by this pandemic and the 
barriers to working due to child care, I am of-
fended by claims that people will refuse to 
work because of the availability of supple-
mental unemployment benefits. This charge is 
simplistic, insulting, and refuted by data show-
ing that low-wage workers stay at work and 
return to work even when faced with unsafe 
working conditions and inadequate wages. 
As our nation grapples with structural rac-
ism, policymakers need to enact policies that 
support workers and address the barriers they 
face, taking care not to penalize communities 
weighed down by poverty and racism. Big 
challenges call for big solutions. Now is the 
time for this Committee and this Congress to 
take meaningful action to ensure that high- 
quality child care is available to all who need 
it. 
The two bills before us today demonstrate 
Democratic commitment to growing our work-
force and our economy by investing in families 
and in our child care infrastructure—both the 
people and the buildings. I am extremely 
proud to co-lead the Child Care for Economic 
Recovery Act and to cosponsor the Child Care 
is Essential Act. Together, these bills parents 
afford and help businesses provide safe, qual-
ity child care. 
In addition to increasing the guaranteed in-
vestment in child care via the Child Care Enti-
tlement to States funds to states from $2.9 bil-
lion to $10 billion for the next 5 years, the 
Child Care for Economic Recovery Act helps 
ensure states can use these funds by waiving 
the requirement that states match the funds 
for the first two years. The bill includes critical 
investments in child care infrastructure to help 
states and providers adapt, expand, and re-
configure child care facilities and infrastructure 
in response to coronavirus. Further, it helps 
qualified child care facilities weather the pan-
demic with targeted tax benefits to help cover 
rent, mortgage, and utility costs. 
The bill also includes two bills I have cham-
pioned to substantially help families afford 
child care. One centers on providing targeted 
support to essential workers who need care 
for children or adults so they can work, and 
the other modernizes the Child and Depend-
ent Care Tax Credit to provide tens of billions 
of dollars to help working family cover child 
care costs. Specifically, there is an additional 
$850 million in funding for the Social Services 
Block Grant to help essential workers pay for 
family care. Importantly, states can use the 
funding to support child care for any group of 
workers they deem essential for in-person 
work, including sanitation and public safety 
workers, grocery store employees and other 
workers designated by the state. Further, the 
bill makes the full amount of the Child and De-
pendent Care Tax Credit available to more 
families by raising the current phase-out of 
$15,000 to $120,000, almost triples the max-
imum credit from $1,050 to $3,000 per child, 
and it ensures that families with the greatest 
need benefit by making the credit fully refund-
able. 
The Child Care is Essential Act creates a 
$50 billion Child Care Stabilization Fund to 
help stabilize the child care sector and help 
providers reopen and operate safely. These 
grants will support providers’ ability to maintain 
employee benefits and salaries; follow Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention health and 
safety guidelines in the classroom; train em-
ployees on health and safety standards; make 
mortgage, rent, and utility payments; and mod-
ify child care services as needed as a result 
of the pandemic. 
Substantively investing in child care is the 
right thing for our economy, the right thing for 
our children, and the right way to give every-
one a fair shot in America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3918 
July 29, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I do have to say that I am dis-
appointed and, frankly, saddened to 
stand here today to point out my dis-
appointment that we are debating a 
bill that I think many would consider 
to be unrealistic and certainly highly 
unlikely to become designated as a so-
lution or even achieved to be a solution 
to the issues we are facing today. 
Madam Speaker, as my colleague 
from New York already pointed out, no 
Republican input was sought on this— 
zero. Zilch. And it is unfortunate, espe-
cially at a time such as this where our 
country is wanting us to come together 
to form solutions that are effective and 
can positively impact our country. 
We, on the Republican side, stand 
ready on a bipartisan basis to accom-
plish our goals of safely reopening 
schools, safely reopening childcare cen-
ters so that our children can learn, 
grow, develop, and their parents can re-
turn to work. We agree. Access to safe, 
affordable childcare is essential to get-
ting Americans back to work and a 
strong economic recovery. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, the bill we are considering 
today is not a path forward. It is a re-
hash of partisan ideas. We can do bet-
ter. The American people expect us to 
do better. Republicans have construc-
tive ideas to offer with demonstrated 
bipartisan support. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. 
DOGGETT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
childcare is so very neglected—a ne-
glect that has been amplified by this 
pandemic. Without adequate care, par-
ents simply cannot go back to work. 
Always essential for economic develop-
ment, 
adequately 
funded, 
quality 
childcare is more than daycare, more 
than babysitting. It should play a key 
role in educating the next generation. 
The National Association for the 
Education of Young Children has esti-
mated that without adequate Federal 
support, over 4 million American chil-
dren will lose their childcare this year. 
In Texas, with Governor Abbott of-
fering inadequate State support, and 
temporarily, but recklessly, suspending 
facility safety precautions, like taking 
temperatures, the lives of children and 
their families have been endangered 
with coronavirus infections at more 
than 1,400 childcare facilities. 
Our two-pronged legislative approach 
today cannot undo such ineptness, but 
it does offer much-needed resources for 
both childcare providers and parents in 
making one of their most important in-
vestments. This is the first of many 
steps needed to build an early learning 
system truly worthy of our youngest 
children. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the great gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. ESTES). 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 7237 and 
H.R. 7027. 
As a father of three, I understand 
how important it is that our children 
are cared for in a nurturing, loving en-
vironment. For many working parents, 
that means utilizing quality, affordable 
daycare for all or part of the week. My 
wife and I utilized daycare for our chil-
dren when they were younger. It pro-
vided a beneficial, educational experi-
ence for them. 
Republicans in the House know that 
when it comes to childcare, we have to 
get this right and we have to do it to-
gether. In that spirit, we have been 
working with our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle during the past 
5 years to pass meaningful legislation, 
like doubling the Childcare and Devel-
opment Block Grant funding, and in-
cluding support for childcare providers 
in the CARES Act. 
Yet, now, when our country needs us 
to put politics aside and focus on the 
actual needs of families, we are debat-
ing partisan bills that do not go 
through regular order, had no input 
from Republicans, put future taxpayers 
on the line for billions of dollars with-
out addressing the childcare needs of 
today and have no safeguards to pre-
vent wealthy Americans from hiring 
maids and butlers instead of helping 
everyday families. 
Madam Speaker, that is right. My 
colleagues on the left are more inter-
ested in throwing money at a problem 
to score political points rather than 
making 
sure 
hurting 
families 
and 
childcare facilities receive needed as-
sistance. But it doesn’t have to be that 
way. Instead of debating another polit-
ical messaging bill, we should be work-
ing together on commonsense meas-
ures, like the Back to Work Child Care 
Grants Act, which provides 9 months 
financial assistance to providers to 
safely 
open, 
disburses 
more 
funds 
quickly without administrative red 
tape, and requires providers receiving 
support to follow State and local safety 
guidelines. 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
have 
common ground here. We want to pro-
vide relief to childcare facilities and 
families during this healthcare crisis. 
Unfortunately, the bills we are debat-
ing today don’t rise to the challenge we 
face. We can and must do better. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject these partisan bills 
and pursue bipartisan legislation, like 
the Back to Work Child Care Grants 
Act. Our families deserve it. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
as 
communities 
across our country continue to battle 
COVID–19 
and 
as 
school 
districts 
around the country continue to plan 
for virtual-only education, it is more 
important 
than 
ever 
for 
parents, 
healthcare 
professionals, 
essential 
workers, and our children to have ac-
cess to quality, affordable childcare. 
This bill helps families by making 
the childcare tax credit fully refund-
able and offers new assistance to 
childcare facilities to help them weath-
er the storm and continue providing 
the vital services our children need. 
Every Member of this House has 
heard from constituents who are grap-
pling with this challenge. Americans 
need our help. 
Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to 
vote for this important bill. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. WENSTRUP). 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
thoughtful opposition to H.R. 7327. 
Everyone in this Chamber agrees 
that protecting our children is our top 
priority and that childcare is one of 
the most critical pieces of the equation 
in getting our economy back to the 
record levels that we had achieved ear-
lier this year. 
I have talked to parents across my 
district in Ohio who want to go back to 
work but don’t have reliable care op-
tions available for their children. It is 
about more than just returning to 
work. Children need to be able to grow 
socially and emotionally by inter-
acting with their peers regularly. 
Instead of rushed partisan legisla-
tion, we need bipartisan solutions, like 
my Family Savings Flexibility Act 
that I introduced with Representatives 
KELLY and AXNE. Our bill allows par-
ents to increase the contribution limit 
to 
their 
Dependent 
Care 
Flexible 
Spending Accounts, as well as roll over 
the funds from the 2020 plan year—a 
huge help to working parents. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to work 
with us on finding bipartisan solutions, 
and I oppose this bill. 
b 1315 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy 
in permitting me to speak on this, as I 
applaud his leadership. 
Under his leadership, the Ways and 
Means Committee has been in the mid-
dle of the recovery efforts. There are 
many of these elements that we are 
proud of, but none is more significant 
than what we are doing here today to 
strengthen 
the 
opportunities 
for 
childcare. 
I hear my friends on the other side of 
the aisle lament the fact that they feel, 
well, this is not going to go anywhere; 
they would like to work with us. Well, 
work with us. The Senate is moving in 
our direction, as they have with the 
major package. If you would come 
work with us, move this forward, we 
would be able to accomplish it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3919 
July 29, 2020 
Putting at risk half our childcare 
slots is unacceptable. This is essential 
if we are going to recover, protect our 
families, move forward. Childcare is an 
essential service for workers today, for 
families tomorrow, for children for 
generations to come. 
I am proud to lend my support. I ap-
preciate what our Ways and Means 
Committee has done, and I anticipate 
we have got more in store. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. SA´ NCHEZ), who is an origi-
nal cosponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
Child Care for Economic Recovery Act. 
I want to thank Chairman NEAL, Chair-
woman LOWEY, Chairman DAVIS, Chair-
woman 
DELAURO, 
and 
Vice 
Chair 
CLARK for working with me on this 
critical bill. 
Access 
to 
quality, 
affordable 
childcare was out of reach for many 
parents before the COVID pandemic, 
and now our childcare crisis is far 
worse. 
Families juggling full-time jobs and 
caring for their kids at home des-
perately need our help. And millions of 
healthcare, grocery store, and other es-
sential workers who cannot work from 
home are out of options. 
Thankfully, this package includes a 
bill I coauthored with Chairman DAVIS 
to help States provide childcare for es-
sential workers. It also provides long- 
term support to help working families 
afford childcare. Finally, it invests in 
facilities to help them adapt to serve 
families safely. 
This pandemic is nowhere near under 
control, and it isn’t safe for many to 
return to work. But parents must have 
access to safe and affordable childcare 
before our economy can reopen. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and, again, I thank those involved 
with the writing of it. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ala-
bama (Ms. SEWELL). 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
7327, the Child Care for Economic Re-
covery Act. 
In my State of Alabama, 52 percent 
of the supply of childcare is projected 
to be lost as a result of this pandemic. 
This is a crisis that is not only dire 
today but may hold lasting damage in 
our communities without bold actions. 
We know, Madam Speaker, that the 
pandemic has disproportionately af-
fected African-American communities 
and that so often Black workers are on 
the front lines of being essential work-
ers, especially Black women. They are 
in greater need of safe, affordable 
childcare. 
At the same time, there are many 
more that are likely to live in under-
served and rural communities that 
simply do not have childcare options. 
I am proud that this bill will make 
important investments in our childcare 
system, including making the child 
care tax credit fully refundable, ex-
panding funds for the Child Care Enti-
tlement to States program, and ex-
panding childcare tax incentives. These 
bold investments are critical for the 
well-being of working parents and their 
children, 
especially 
in 
underserved 
communities that I represent. 
I urge the passage of this bill. Let’s 
protect our children by making sure 
they have adequate childcare. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JUDY CHU). 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I stand today in support of 
the Child Care for Economic Recovery 
Act. 
As families juggle working from 
home and childcare, this pandemic has 
made it clear just how vital childcare 
is to our economy. If we want to 
prioritize economic growth and im-
prove outcomes moving forward, we 
will have to make investments that 
improve quality and access today. 
Even before the COVID–19 crisis, 
many families of color were not able to 
access childcare. In fact, only 3 percent 
of federally eligible Asian children, 6 
percent Latinx children, and 15 percent 
of Black children were able to access 
childcare based on Federal eligibility. 
This bill helps by adding billions of 
dollars to our childcare infrastructure. 
It also makes the child and dependent 
care tax credit refundable so families 
could receive a childcare credit of up to 
$6,000. 
Finally, the bill ensures that essen-
tial workers have access to safe care 
for their children while they are pro-
viding invaluable services to our com-
munities. 
Without investments in childcare, 
our economy cannot recover. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, the 
Bible tells us: ‘‘Raise up a child in the 
way they should go, and they will not 
depart from it.’’ 
As a parent, I have sometimes, if not 
always, reflected that that seems to be 
the case. But it surely is the case that 
we need to provide our families and our 
children with safe and positive places 
so that we can raise them up in the 
way they should go. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the bills on the floor today to 
protect childcare workers from losing 
their jobs and to help more families af-
ford the cost of childcare. They build 
on provisions that we had in the HE-
ROES Act. 
First, the Child Care Is Essential Act 
would create a $50 billion childcare sta-
bilization fund to keep childcare pro-
viders from going out of business. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Chairwoman 
DELAURO
of the Subcommittee on 
Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies, as 
well as Chairman BOBBY SCOTT of the 
Education and Labor Committee. 
Secondly, the Child Care for Eco-
nomic Recovery Act takes a long-term 
approach by improving infrastructure 
and designating childcare providers as 
essential and providing tax credits to 
help more families qualify for and af-
ford safe and accessible childcare. 
I want to thank Chairwoman LOWEY 
of the Appropriations Committee and 
my dear friend Chairman NEAL, chair-
man of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, for sponsoring this legislation. 
As noted yesterday, in an editorial 
by 
The 
Washington 
Post: 
‘‘The 
childcare industry is collapsing under 
pandemic-inflicted financial pressure.’’ 
They went on to say: ‘‘Without swift 
action from Congress, childcare centers 
are at risk of permanent closures that 
could severely undermine the country’s 
economic recovery.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I am the father of 
three daughters and a granddaughter 
who has four children, my four great- 
grandchildren. She is fortunate that 
she is able to stay home with those 
children. Three of them are in school. 
I have two other daughters who are 
now older, and their children are older. 
But when they had children at a young 
age, childcare was critical and very dif-
ficult to obtain and very expensive. 
Dad and mom helped out. But there are 
so many millions who don’t have a dad 
or mom or a grandfather or grand-
mother to help out. And when we don’t 
help them, the cost is to everybody. 
Governor Agnew was elected Gov-
ernor the same year I was elected in 
the State of Maryland. I remember a 
line from his inaugural address: ‘‘The 
cost of failure far exceeds the price of 
progress.’’ Failure to bring up these 
children in the way they should go and 
have them in safe childcare settings 
will result in a cost far higher than 
providing that service. 
If the Congress fails to take actions 
like those, like the House is taking 
today, we risk our economic recovery 
by forcing parents to drop out of the 
workforce or lose work hours due to 
the demands of dependent care. It 
would place a substantial burden on 
working families with young children 
or elderly parents to care for, and it 
would disproportionately hurt minor-
ity workers and their families because, 
as The Washington Post editorial fur-
ther pointed out, minority parents 
‘‘are more likely than White parents to 
experience 
job 
disruptions 
due 
to 
childcare.’’ 
That is not good for them; it is not 
good for their children. 
Madam Speaker, it is not good for 
America. 
House Democrats are determined to 
help families get through this public 
health and economic crisis, but we 
must have a longer vision, as Chairman 
NEAL pointed out, because it is not just

the pandemic that caused this problem. 
It has been a problem that has been 
with us for a long period of time. 
We refuse to do what some have sug-
gested, again and again, for the past 
decade, which is to tell the American 
people: You are on your own. 
‘‘You are on your own’’ is not a 
moral stance. It is not. Am I my broth-
er’s keeper? The answer to that is yes, 
I am my brother’s keeper because I 
want my brother healthy; I want my 
brother educated; and I want my broth-
er 
well-housed. 
Why? 
Because 
my 
brother affects my life and my chil-
dren’s lives and my grandchildren’s 
lives 
and 
my 
great-grandchildren’s 
lives. 
If you are going to make America 
great, you need to make all our people 
great. So, I am here in support of this 
legislation. It is critical legislation for 
our country—yes, for the children, yes, 
for the families, but for our country. 
I hope all of my colleagues, Repub-
licans and Democrats, will join us in 
passing these bills. Let’s do that today 
to keep childcare providers open, ex-
pand the availability of childcare for 
working families, and help workers re-
turn to their jobs when it is safe to do 
so. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ for America’s families 
and for America. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS). 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Child 
Care for Economic Recovery Act. 
Even before the pandemic, childcare 
in Pennsylvania cost twice what is con-
sidered affordable, and working fami-
lies struggled with a shortage of qual-
ity care. Now, Pennsylvania could lose 
half of its childcare supply due to the 
pandemic. 
This bill funds improvements to help 
childcare centers reopen and operate 
safely and addresses longstanding bar-
riers to help families secure quality 
care. 
We should invest now to upgrade 
childcare facilities of all sizes and en-
sure children have a safe place to be. 
We must act to protect children and 
the providers who care for them. 
I would like to close by thanking all 
the childcare workers who provide es-
sential services to American families. 
Now, let’s pass this bill. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of two im-
portant bills, H.R. 7027, the Child Care 
Is Essential Act, and H.R. 7327, the 
Child Care for Economic Recovery Act. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has exacer-
bated the gaps in America’s childcare 
system. Even before the current crisis, 
America faced a dire shortage of qual-
ity, affordable childcare. 
Now, with daycares closed, schools 
out, and many working from home, 
parents are struggling between fully 
attending to their kids’ needs and fo-
cusing on their jobs. 
These two bills will lend a hand to 
working parents. The Child Care for 
Economic Recovery Act will help en-
sure parents have quality childcare 
within their reach. The Child Care Is 
Essential Act will provide necessary 
emergency funding for childcare pro-
viders, the majority of which are small 
businesses. 
Adequate, quality childcare for every 
working family is critical to success-
fully opening our economy. Passing 
these bills will help our children, our 
working parents, and the countless 
businesses dependent on their talents. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1330 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GOMEZ). 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in support of these important 
pieces of legislation. 
The coronavirus pandemic has high-
lighted the challenges that working 
families have always faced in the 
American economy: that the economy 
is not structured around the needs of 
working families and that the solu-
tions that do exist, like childcare, are 
not sufficiently funded. 
As such, our Nation’s lack of support 
for affordable childcare forces many 
working families to make an impos-
sible choice: either go to work to sup-
port your family to put a roof over 
their head, food on their table, or 
clothes on their backs, or not in order 
to stay at home to make sure that they 
are safe and well taken care of. 
Unfortunately, parents don’t face an 
even playing field when it comes to 
childcare. For example, Latino and 
Asian children are most likely to have 
a lack of childcare options in their 
communities and face long waits and 
long lines to get a spot. 
Despite 
the 
fact 
that 
quality 
childcare is a cost-effective way to re-
duce poverty, funding for childcare is 
simply not enough. I am proud to sup-
port this important piece of legislation 
and these two pieces of legislation. It is 
a way forward, and I look forward to 
voting on it later today. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I am 
ready to close. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman from Massachu-
setts has expired. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I was 
prepared to close after Mr. REED. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has no 
time remaining. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I would 
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 53⁄4 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, to restart the econ-
omy in the wake of COVID–19, parents 
will need sufficient childcare to return 
to the workplace. A lack of childcare 
options could keep parents from re-
turning to work or could force parents 
to cut back the amount of time spent 
at work. Either of these scenarios 
would cripple our households’ finances 
and a healthy economic recovery. 
New requirements for childcare pro-
viders in schools, including smaller 
class sizes, enhanced cleaning require-
ments, new and likely evolving teacher 
education on new protocols, and liabil-
ity risks, will also increase costs. Pol-
icy interventions are needed to in-
crease both the supply of affordable 
childcare and working families’ de-
mand for childcare. 
As you have heard from my col-
leagues here today, Republicans share 
concerns about the impact of the pan-
demic on the childcare industry and 
lives of working families across the 
country. 
We have bipartisan, feasible, com-
monsense solutions to address this 
problem. Whether it is tax relief for 
families and businesses to purchase 
childcare or additional support to keep 
existing childcare providers in busi-
ness, our solutions would have an im-
mediate impact on the industry and 
parents. 
Successful childcare solutions have 
received bipartisan support in the past, 
and they will moving forward. It is a 
shame we can cooperate in good times 
but not in the midst of a global pan-
demic. Our families and children de-
serve better. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all 
my colleagues to oppose this bill, and 
let’s come together to pass a bill that 
will help the American people in a true 
bipartisan fashion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the remain-
der of my time to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL). 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I spoke 
with a group of working mothers. One 
told me that she fears we are at risk of 
losing a generation of working parents. 
Others emphasized how terrifying their 
situations are and how they lacked 
choices that will allow them to con-
tinue their careers and protect their 
children. 
Parents all across the country have 
been doing the hard work of holding 
their families together while the White 
House ignores the plight and exacer-
bates the public health crisis. We owe 
it to these parents to show that we in 
Congress hear them and that we are 
going to do something about it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation.

in strong support of H.R. 7327, the ‘‘Child 
Care for Economic Recovery Act’’, which ex-
pands the availability of quality child care, 
helps workers return to their jobs when it is 
safe, and enables America’s economy to re-
cover from the COVID–19 recession. 
The Child Care for Economic Recovery Act 
creates a new tax credit that helps employees 
access quality, affordable child care, and by 
expanding the employee retention tax credit, it 
incentivizes employers to keep child care 
workers on payroll. 
Further, this bill provides $850 million to 
states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. 
territories to fill in the gaps in dependent care 
for essential workers during the COVID–19 
pandemic as well as invests $10 billion in in-
frastructure to improve child care safety. 
Madam Speaker, just last week, the United 
States reached a historic and unfortunate 
milestone with over 4,000,000 confirmed 
coronavirus cases. 
Today, there are over 4,400,000 cases na-
tionwide and 151,000 deaths. 
In my home state of Texas, a current 
hotspot, there are over 413,000 cases and 
6,500 deaths. 
At the county level, Harris County, which in-
cludes my district, has approximately 67,660 
cases and 1,127 deaths. 
As we seek to regain control over this virus 
and poise our economy to rebound from the 
effects of the coronavirus, we must take the 
necessary steps to address the cracks and 
disparities that have come to light by way of 
the pandemic. 
The child care industry has served as a cru-
cial backbone to the United States’ economy 
for many years, and it too continues to be 
rocked by the coronavirus. 
Child care facilities provide an immense and 
unquestionable public value. 
This was demonstrated by the key role child 
care centers had as they continued to provide 
child care for essential workers who continued 
to work at the beginning of the pandemic. 
According to the Washington Post, before 
the coronavirus pandemic, approximately one- 
third of all children under 5 attended a paid 
care facility, day-care center, preschool or pre-
kindergarten. 
Workers in every industry rely on child care 
centers to provide capable care for their chil-
dren, helping them juggle both parenting and 
employment responsibilities. 
The child care industry is even more essen-
tial to single parent households. 
In 2019, 15.76 million children lived with a 
single mother and approximately 3.23 million 
children lived with a single father. 
For these millions of families, child care is a 
lifeline. 
However, as millions of businesses continue 
to feel the economic effects of the coronavirus 
and fight for survival, the child care industry is 
facing its own crisis. 
Nationwide, 
an 
estimated 
1.5 
million 
childcare workers have lost their jobs. 
Before the pandemic, Texas had more than 
11,000 child care operations. 
Yet, as a result of this disease, there were 
only 883 facilities still operating in the state as 
of early this month, according to CNN. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today, voicing 
my support for H.R. 7327 because it serves as 
a vital component to our nation’s economic re-
opening strategy. 
The federal government must do everything 
in its power to ensure that the child care in-
dustry remains available to all who need it, 
and that means voting yes on this bill. 
By enacting this piece of legislation, Con-
gress commits to ensuring the long-term suc-
cess of the child care industry by investing 
$10 billion over the 2020–2024 period to im-
prove child care facilities and infrastructure. 
Doing so will address longstanding inad-
equacies of child care facilities as well as re-
spond to the immediate infrastructure needs 
that the COVID–19 pandemic has caused, in-
cluding structural changes to facilitate social 
distancing and improve sanitation. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation also re-
quires the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) to conduct a first-ever 
comprehensive inventory of the structural chal-
lenges facing child care in the United States 
and its territories. 
For far too long, the child care industry has 
been overlooked and undervalued, and it is no 
coincidence that this industry is comprised of 
94 percent women, a majority of whom are 
women of color. 
But child care is not just a woman’s issue. 
Everyone has a stake in ensuring the viabil-
ity of the child care industry. 
I have been a long-standing advocate for 
the child care industry because I understand 
the challenges many working families face 
when it comes to obtaining reliable, affordable, 
and quality child care. 
Prior to the pandemic, HHS considered 
childcare affordable if no more than 10 per-
cent of a family’s income was put towards it, 
but parents were ultimately spending much 
more, on average. 
However, because of the coronavirus and 
the economic devastation it has caused, what 
was once deemed affordable is bound to 
change. 
By passing H.R. 7327, we have the oppor-
tunity to bring much-needed relief to financially 
struggling child care providers, to families who 
need child care in order to return to work, and 
to the U.S. economy. 
With this legislation, we will expand access 
to care and ease the financial burdens placed 
on parents and employers, so that we can re-
open and recover from this public health crisis 
without leaving kids, parents, and businesses 
behind. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 7327, the ‘‘Child Care for Economic Re-
covery Act.’’

SAMI’S LAW 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4686) to amend title 23, 
United States Code, to compel States 
to require illuminated signs and other 
measures on ride-hailing vehicles, to 
prohibit the sale of such signs, to re-
quire ride-hailing companies to imple-
ment an electronic access system on 
ride-hailing vehicles, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4686 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as ‘‘Sami’s Law’’. 
SEC. 2. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR RIDE- 
HAILING VEHICLES AND RIDE-HAIL-
ING COMPANIES. 
(a) REQUIREMENTS FOR TNC PLATFORMS.— 
Not later than 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act, each transportation 
network company shall establish and imple-
ment a system and policy within the trans-
portation network company’s TNC platform 
that shall make available to each passenger 
a digital method to verify that the driver 
with whom the passenger has been matched 
through the transportation network com-
pany’s TNC platform has been authorized by 
the transportation network company to ac-
cept the passenger’s trip request prior to the 
beginning of the trip. Such system shall in-
clude— 
(1)(A) an initial notification sent to the 
passenger’s personal mobile device, or other-
wise communicated to the passenger, con-
taining verifiable information specific to the 
TNC driver or TNC vehicle with which the 
passenger has been matched; 
(B) the ability for the passenger, driver, 
and TNC platform to confirm the verifiable 
information matching the passenger to the 
authorized TNC driver or TNC vehicle prior 
to the beginning of the trip; 
(C) a TNC platform restriction on a TNC 
driver from commencing a trip via the TNC 
platform until both the passenger and the 
TNC driver verify the other’s identity using 
the system; and 
(D) a way for a passenger to use a non-vis-
ual arrangement to verify the TNC driver 
under the system used in accordance with 
this subparagraph; or 
(2) as an alternative to implementing the 
system required under paragraph (1), a trans-
portation network company may implement 
any successor technology-based system that 
enables verification that the driver with 
whom the passenger has been matched 
through the transportation network com-
pany’s TNC platform has been authorized by 
the transportation network company to ac-
cept the passenger’s trip requests received 
through its digital network prior to the be-
ginning of the trip. 
(b) OPT OUT.—A transportation network 
company may offer a passenger an option

not to use the system that the transpor-
tation network company has implemented 
under subsection (a). Any trip completed by 
a passenger who opts not to use the system 
shall not be a violation of this section. 
(c) EXEMPTIONS.—This section shall not 
apply to any trips in which— 
(1) a third party, including any third-party 
business, non-profit, or government entity, 
facilitates the trip for the individual who is 
transported in the TNC vehicle; or 
(2) compliance with subsection (a) is im-
practicable due to circumstances beyond a 
transportation network company’s control, 
including instances where a passenger’s per-
sonal mobile device has failed to operate or 
there is degraded, reduced, or otherwise in-
sufficient cellular connectivity in order for 
the system to properly operate. 
SEC. 3. SUCCESSOR TECHNOLOGY PERFORM-
ANCE STANDARDS. 
(1) PERFORMANCE
STANDARDS.—Not later 
than 180 days after the establishment of the 
‘‘SAMI’s Law Council’’ pursuant to section 4, 
such Council shall recommend to the Sec-
retary of Transportation performance stand-
ards for the successor technology-based sys-
tems permitted under section 2(a)(2) and the 
Secretary shall thereafter issue performance 
standards consistent with the Council’s rec-
ommendations and provide a reasonable time 
for a TNC to comply. Such standards shall 
require, at a minimum, that— 
(A) any successor technology-based system 
that enables the verification that the driver 
with whom the passenger has been matched 
through the TNC platform has been author-
ized by the transportation network company 
to accept the passenger’s trip request re-
ceived through its TNC platform prior to the 
beginning of the trip; 
(B) confirmation protocols are visually and 
non-visually accessible; and 
(C) a transportation network company im-
plement a system incorporating a driver edu-
cation and public awareness program related 
to the use of its successor technology and its 
required verifiable information. 
(2) UPDATING
PERFORMANCE
STANDARDS.— 
Six months after the establishment of the 
performance standards required by this sec-
tion, and, at a minimum, annually there-
after, the Secretary shall solicit input from 
the SAMI’s Law Council, established under 
section 4, about whether the performance 
standards need to be updated or expanded to 
incorporate new technological developments. 
The Secretary may amend the performance 
standards to account for new technological 
developments. 
(3) INTERIM STANDARDS.—Prior to the adop-
tion of performance standards, a transpor-
tation network company may adopt and de-
ploy any other successor technology-based 
system that enables a passenger to verify 
that the driver with whom the passenger has 
been matched through the transportation 
network company’s platform has been au-
thorized by the transportation network com-
pany to accept the passenger’s trip requests 
received through its platform prior to the be-
ginning of the trip. A successor technology- 
based system deployed under this subpara-
graph shall be considered to fulfill the re-
quirements of section 2(a). A successor tech-
nology-based system adopted under this sec-
tion shall be presumed to meet such require-
ments unless the Secretary determines oth-
erwise. If the Secretary makes such a deter-
mination, a reasonable time to cure shall be 
provided. 
(4) REPORTS.—Upon first issuing perform-
ance standards under paragraph (1), and each 
year thereafter, the Secretary shall transmit 
a report to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Committee on Com-
merce of the Senate detailing the perform-
ance standards recommended by the SAMI’s 
Law Council, established under section 4, 
and issued by the Secretary under paragraph 
(1), including any updates to such standards 
and explaining the rationale for issuing such 
performance standards.

Amend the title so as to read: ‘‘A bill 
to require ride-hailing companies 
to implement an enhanced digital 
system to verify passengers with 
their authorized ride-hailing vehi-
cles and drivers.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to insert extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 4686, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4686, Sami’s Law. This leg-
islation marks the first step in Federal 
oversight of the safety of transpor-
tation network companies. 
I particularly applaud the gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey, 
Representative 
SMITH, and the gentleman from New 
York, Representative SUOZZI, for intro-
ducing legislation on this subject and 
tenaciously working through many 
iterations of the bill in order to bring 
it to the floor of the House with strong 
support. 
Mobility and transportation patterns 
in cities have been upended in recent 
years by companies that, through 
transformative technology platforms, 
have revolutionized how we travel. In a 
very short time, many people have 
come to rely on TNCs as a regular 
transportation option. These services, 
however, have operated with little 
transportation safety or regulatory 
oversight. 
There are many aspects of TNCs that 
the Committee on Transportation has 
examined, including their impacts on 
congestion, their impacts on wages, 
their impacts on public transportation 
use. We held a hearing last October in 
which a range of troubling aspects of 
the TNC model were brought to light. 
We had hoped at that hearing to ex-
plore the safety issues, but neither 
Uber nor Lyft would come to the hear-
ing. 
The committee included provisions 
in H.R. 2, as passed by the House ear-
lier this month, that focused on how to 
put some guardrails around this new 
‘‘mobility on demand’’ model to ensure 
these services supplement, rather than 
compete, with transit services. 
But today, in this legislation, we 
focus on the most critical and chal-
lenging policy aspect of the TNC 
model: how to ensure the safety of pas-
sengers and drivers who utilize a ride- 
hailing platform. 
This bill is known as Sami’s Law in 
honor of Samantha Josephson, a 21- 
year-old college student who was bru-
tality murdered after she entered a car 
which was mistakenly identified as the 
Uber she had hailed. 
I met with her parents, Seymour and 
Marci 
Josephson, 
and 
heard 
their 
heart-wrenching story firsthand of how 
this split-second decision to enter that 
vehicle cost their daughter her life. 
They have worked tirelessly on the leg-
islation before us today so that mil-
lions of other ride-hailing services 
users can do so with safety protections 
in place. 
It is appalling that it took this trag-
edy for TNCs to admit that developing 
an app connecting passengers and driv-
ers through technology and hoping for 
the best is woefully insufficient as a 
safety protocol. I am glad that Uber 
and Lyft were finally willing to come 
to the table and agree to the basic safe-
ty precautions contained in H.R. 4686. 
This bill requires TNCs, within 90 
days of enactment, to establish and im-
plement a digital means for passengers 
to verify that the driver has been au-
thorized by the TNC to accept the pas-
senger’s trip request prior to the start 
of the trip or the person entering the 
car. 
Such a system must include the abil-
ity for the passenger, the driver, and 
the TNC platform to confirm the infor-
mation matching the passenger and the 
authorized TNC driver or TNC vehicle 
and the ability to restrict the trip from 
commencing until both the passenger 
and TNC driver verify the other’s iden-
tity using the system. 
The bill further ensures that TNCs 
will be able to continue to improve and 
innovate ways to maximize passenger 
and driver safety by establishing a 
process for the Secretary of Transpor-
tation to issue performance standards 
for successor verification technologies. 
The bill also establishes an advisory 
council of Federal officials, representa-
tives of TNCs, TNC drivers, law en-
forcement, victims’ advocacy groups, 
and individuals with disabilities to de-
velop recommendations on successor 
technologies. 
The bill further prohibits the sale of 
any signage that is designed to help a 
passenger identify a TNC vehicle and 
contains a TNC’s proprietary trade-
mark or logo, unless authorized by the 
TNC. 
During our hearing last fall, I just 
went on to Amazon and I found I could 
have had delivered by Prime, in 2 days, 
a lighted sign to put on my dashboard 
that I would plug into the cigarette 
lighter saying I was an Uber or Lyft 
driver. That has got to stop. 
Finally, the bill directs the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to conduct 
a study on the incidence of assaults on 
TNC passengers, TNC drivers, and

background checks conducted on pro-
spective drivers of TNC vehicles, in-
cluding State and local laws which 
may require such background checks. 
I have been focused on the potential 
danger of pairing passengers with poor-
ly vetted drivers for years. In 2015, I 
wrote 
to 
then-Uber 
CEO 
Travis 
Kalanick urging the company to con-
duct 
fingerprint-based 
background 
checks. 
b 1345 
In my district, dozens of applicants 
with serious criminal convictions, in-
cluding a convicted murderer, a reg-
istered sex offender, and 10 people with 
serious DUIs, were cleared, they were 
cleared 
through 
Uber 
and 
Lyft’s 
screening process, and they were driv-
ing people around. It wasn’t until the 
local police department in my State— 
we are the only State who hasn’t been 
preempted by Uber and Lyft from going 
further than their very cursory back-
ground checks—the police conducted 
the same background checks that they 
would conduct for taxi drivers in the 
city, and then they found the mur-
derer, the sex offender, and the others, 
and those people were removed from 
service. That just shouldn’t ever hap-
pen. 
Strong and thorough vetting of po-
tential drivers is the first line of de-
fense to ensure passenger safety. While 
the study initiated by this bill will 
yield important data, I believe we will 
ultimately have to do more to truly 
protect the ride-hailing community. It 
will do little good to verify that you 
have the right driver if that driver has 
a history and the desire to do harm to 
passengers. 
Lawmakers at the State, Federal, 
and local level need to think beyond 
whether ride-hailing gets people from 
point A to point B, and work to ensure 
that TNCs deliver a public service equi-
tably and safely, and it is not a race to 
the bottom by exploiting drivers. This 
bill is an important step in setting an 
appropriate regulatory floor. 
I thank those I mentioned earlier for 
bringing this legislation before the 
House, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port its passage. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
COMMITTEE
ON
ENERGY
AND

OF
REPRESENTA-
TIVES, 
Washington, DC, July 27, 2020. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO: I write con-
cerning H.R. 4686, ‘‘Sami’s Law,’’ which was 
additionally referred to the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce (Committee). 
In recognition of the desire to expedite 
consideration of H.R. 4686, the Committee 
agrees to waive formal consideration of the 
bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule 
X jurisdiction of the Committee. The Com-
mittee takes this action with the mutual un-
derstanding that we do not waive any juris-
diction over the subject matter contained in 
this or similar legislation, and that the Com-
mittee will be appropriately consulted and 
involved as this bill or similar legislation 
moves forward so that we may address any 
remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I 
also request that you support my request to 
name members of the Committee to any con-
ference committee to consider such provi-
sions. 
Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of 
this letter into the Congressional Record 
during floor consideration of H.R. 4686. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, July 27, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman, Committee on Energy & Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. PALLONE: Thank you for your 
letter regarding H.R 4686, Sami’s Law. I ap-
preciate your decision to waive formal con-
sideration of the bill. 
I agree that the Committee on Energy & 
Commerce has valid jurisdictional claims to 
certain provisions in this important legisla-
tion, and I further agree that by forgoing 
formal consideration of the bill, the Com-
mittee on Energy & Commerce is not 
waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant 
subject matter. Additionally, I will support 
the appointment of conferees from the Com-
mittee on Energy & Commerce should a 
House-Senate conference be convened on this 
legislation. Finally, this exchange of letters 
will be included in the Congressional Record 
when the bill is considered on the floor. 
Thank you again, and I look forward to 
continuing to work collaboratively with the 
Committee on Energy & Commerce on this 
important issue. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I rise today to thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO, Ranking Member GRAVES, 
and all who have worked hard in the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee to get this legislation to 
the floor known as ‘‘Sami’s Law.’’ I, 
too, support this legislation. I also 
want to applaud the dedication and the 
hard work of the sponsor of Sami’s 
Law, and that is none other than my 
good friend, the Representative from 
New Jersey, Mr. CHRIS SMITH. 
I met with Sami’s parents at the urg-
ing of Mr. SMITH a few months ago. 
Marci and Seymour Josephson, your 
government today will show you that 
it is working for you and for all Ameri-
cans, and that is because you have a 
tireless advocate, somebody who I have 
never seen work harder on an issue 
that is so important to so many young 
people in this country than Mr. SMITH 
did. There has been no one in my time 
in Congress who has come to me on 
this floor advocating for a single issue 
that can mean so much to kids like my 
daughter who is in college, like my 
sons who are in college that is going to 
have an impact on their generation as 
much as the advocacy of Congressman 
CHRIS SMITH because this bill is going 
to pass today. We are one step closer to 
making Sami’s Law law. 
As we know, this law is going create 
minimum standards and requirements 
for safety for passengers who utilize 
ridesharing platforms. We want to 
make sure that digitally they know 
that the driver they have reserved is 
the driver who is rolling up next to 
them to pick them up. This verifica-
tion process is essential in making sure 
tragedies that took Sami’s life don’t 
happen to other families. 
This bill also creates an advisory 
council, Sami’s Law Council, to make 
safety-related performance standards 
and recommendations to the Secretary 
of Transportation. 
Also a very important point: To keep 
bad actors out of this arena, we are 
also going to ban something that I 
learned about, again, from Congress-
man SMITH, that there are bad actors 
that were able to purchase Uber and 
Lyft stickers, put them on their car, 
and they were able to do it on Amazon, 
and they had zero experience and zero 
intention of ever legally getting the 
clearance 
to 
participate 
in 
those 
rideshare programs. 
This is going to save people in Amer-
ica. I support this legislation. 
And my last message to Marci and 
Seymour 
Josephson: 
Sami’s 
legacy 
lives on after we pass this bill in the 
House of Representatives today. Thank 
you for your tireless advocacy, Marci 
and Seymour, and thank you for send-
ing such a tireless advocate to the 
House of Representatives in Congress-
man CHRIS SMITH. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the dis-
tinguished majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Let me begin by thanking my friends 
Mr. SMITH, Mr. DAVIS, Mr. DEFAZIO, 
and Mr. SUOZZI, for bringing forth this 
bipartisan bill. 
In March 2019 Samantha Josephson, a 
21-year-old native of New Jersey, was 
finishing her senior year at the Univer-
sity of South Carolina in my congres-
sional district. She was a great student 
and had earned a full scholarship to 
study at Drexel University School of 
Law to pursue her dream of practicing 
international law. Sami, as she was 
known to her family and friends, did 
not get a chance to fulfill those 
dreams. 
After an evening out with friends, 
she decided to order a rideshare home. 
Video captured her getting into a black 
car that she assumed was her ride. In-
stead of being her ride, the unmarked 
car was driven by a predator who kid-
napped and killed her. 
Today, we will vote on Sami’s Law to 
put protections in place to prevent 
similar tragedies. 
This legislation makes it illegal for 
anyone other than rideshare companies 
to sell rideshare vehicle signs so preda-
tors can’t impersonate an authorized 
driver. It also institutes the additional 
safeguard of a new code system that 
will allow the passenger to verify that

the vehicle is their ride before they get 
into the car. 
Finally, the bill sets up a new council 
at the Department of Transportation 
to develop performance standards for 
rideshare technologies to ensure that 
our safety protocols keep up with the 
pace of technology. 
I thank, once again, Congressman 
CHRIS SMITH, my Republican colleague 
from Sami’s New Jersey hometown, for 
his sponsorship of this bipartisan bill. 
I have met with Sami’s parents, and 
I want to thank them for their 
strength and commitment to ensuring 
this legislation becomes law. 
I thank my colleagues in advance of 
their votes, hopefully, in favor of this 
legislation that will honor Sami’s leg-
acy and enacts important safeguards to 
protect rideshare users from predatory 
behavior. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WAL-
DEN), another tireless advocate for 
Sami’s Law and the ranking member of 
the House Committee on Energy and 
Commerce. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4686, Sami’s Law, as 
well. 
I commend my colleagues who have 
been down here today talking about 
this law and the tragedy around it and 
the tragedy around the loss of Sami. 
And while she may never have gotten 
the opportunity to become a lawyer, 
she will have a law. And the advocacy 
of her parents to get this law in place 
is a lifetime statutory memorial for 
her for an incredible tragedy that 
should never have existed in the first 
place, the kidnapping and murder. 
We think about our kids, and we 
think about all we do to protect them 
and to encourage them to do the right 
things. And you think about con-
vincing them to take a rideshare, don’t 
drive, whatever, and then to have this 
happen is truly horrible. 
So this legislation that is brought be-
fore us today is extraordinarily impor-
tant. I thank my colleague from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH) for his tireless lead-
ership on this and Mr. SUOZZI as well 
and everyone who has worked on it. 
You should, as a rider, have the op-
portunity to know that you are safe 
when you get in that vehicle and that 
you don’t risk your life the way Sami 
did and lost it. 
Madam Speaker, I hope we can all 
rally around this bill and help get this 
into law and have a memorial for Sami 
and a safeguard for all others. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. SUOZZI), who was a key 
person in getting this legislation mov-
ing through the House of Representa-
tives. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of Sami’s Law. Con-
gressman SMITH and I introduced this 
legislation to address passenger safety 
issues with the transportation network 
companies, TNCs, such as Uber and 
Lyft. 
I thank Congressman SMITH again for 
his tireless advocacy on this issue, and 
I also thank Chairman DEFAZIO. There 
is no way this would have made it to 
the floor unless he had worked to-
gether with House leadership to get 
this bipartisan and commonsense legis-
lation on the floor. 
It is a tremendous challenge to deter-
mine what policies are necessary to en-
sure that the new industry of transpor-
tation network companies, TNCs, pro-
vide safe, efficient, and cost-effective 
solutions to consumers and employees. 
Earlier this year, when news reports 
surfaced about the tragic, horrific 
death of Sami Josephson, a friend of 
mine, who is also a friend and neighbor 
of the Josephson family, contacted me 
to work on legislation to ensure that 
no other parent would experience the 
devastating loss of a child in the way 
that the Josephsons did. 
I later discovered that Congressman 
SMITH, who represents the Josephsons, 
was also working on the issue. 
Sami Josephson called for an Uber, 
entered the wrong car, and was mur-
dered. 
The Smith/Suozzi legislation pro-
vides consumers with a level of safety 
before entering a vehicle. Our bill’s 
safety provisions are commonsense and 
easy to implement, including the fol-
lowing requirements: 
One, requiring companies like Uber 
and Lyft to connect with passengers 
and drivers to positively establish their 
identities before the trip starts. 
Two, prohibiting the unauthorized 
sale of ride-hailing signs and spells out 
the civil penalties of violating the law. 
Three, establishing an advisory coun-
cil comprised of representatives from 
Federal agencies, TNCs, law enforce-
ment, disability and advocacy groups 
to recommend standards for positive 
identification systems. 
As we began researching this issue, I 
was surprised to learn that TNCs, a rel-
atively new business model, are regu-
lated differently across States and 
local borders. 
While some States and cities, such as 
New York City, have implemented new 
rules, such as creating a new license 
category for high-volume for-hire serv-
ices, TNCs have been mostly left to 
create their own policies for preventing 
and tracking violence or abuse to their 
passengers. 
We have all heard about the horrific 
reports of assault and abuse incidents 
involving both TNC passengers and 
drivers. That is why our bill also re-
quires a Government Accountability 
Office study on the prevalence of as-
sault and abuse perpetrated on riders 
by TNC drivers of ride-hailing vehicles 
and on TNC drivers by passengers. 
This data will be instrumental in de-
termining any other safety procedures 
that may be necessary to ensure the 
safety of everyone who uses a ride-
sharing app. 
There is no way to describe the sad-
ness, the horror, the pain that Sami’s 
death caused for her family and to her 
community. She lived a vibrant and 
loving life. She had her whole life 
ahead of her. She planned to study law. 
She had hopes. She had dreams. We 
must do everything we can to prevent 
what happened to Sami and so many 
others from happening to anyone else. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this critical, commonsense legislation. 
b 1400 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know if I can 
say anything more about my colleague. 
I yield as much time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from New Jer-
sey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the ranking member 
of the subcommittee for yielding. I 
thank him for his leadership. I thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO so very, very much 
for his championing this legislation. I 
thank my good friend, TOM SUOZZI. We 
have partnered before on human rights 
legislation, particularly as it relates to 
China. It is great to be working with 
him so closely again today. I thank 
Ranking Member GRAVES. I will get to 
some further thank yous in a few mo-
ments. 
Madam Speaker, in late March of 
2019, University of South Carolina sen-
ior Samantha, or Sami, Josephson left 
a late night outing with her friends 
alone because she had to work in the 
morning. 
The extraordinarily talented student, 
who had recently earned a full scholar-
ship to Drexel University Law, ordered 
an Uber. 
In a congested part of Columbia 
known as Five Points, a predator pre-
tending to be her Uber driver took her 
in his car and brutally murdered her. 
Less than 24 hours later, Sami was 
found in a field. The alleged murderer, 
Nathaniel Rowland, was caught, jailed, 
and awaits trial. Last month, a judge 
rightly denied bond. 
Almost immediately after her death 
and notwithstanding their excruciating 
agony over the loss of their precious 
daughter Sami, her parents, Seymour 
and Marci, began pushing for com-
prehensive new protection policies at 
Uber and Lyft and legislation to ensure 
that no one else ever loses his or her 
life or gets assaulted by a rideshare 
driver or a predator who pretends to be 
one. 
They created the #WHATSMYNAME 
Foundation in ‘‘honor of their daughter 
to educate the world on rideshare safe-
ty. . . . Samantha may be gone,’’ they 
write, ‘‘but our goal for the rest of our 
time on Earth is to share her story and 
make a lasting change.’’ 
For over a year, especially given the 
pain due to the unimaginable loss of 
their daughter, Seymour and Marci 
have been heroic, tenacious, and ex-
traordinarily persuasive. They have 
been a critically important part of the 
often intense negotiations with mul-
tiple stakeholders, including Uber and

Lyft, on both the substance and the 
text of Sami’s Law. 
Marci and Seymour made frequent 
trips to the Capitol to meet lawmakers 
and staff on both sides of the aisle, in-
cluding Speaker PELOSI
and Leader 
MCCARTHY, as well as Chairman DEFA-
ZIO, Ranking Member GRAVES, and Mr. 
DAVIS and Chairwoman NORTON, all of 
whom welcomed them with such com-
passion and empathy. 
Mr. Speaker, I am especially grateful 
to the Speaker for her strong personal 
commitment to this cause and for 
bringing Sami’s Law to the floor today 
and who, like KEVIN MCCARTHY and 
others, also welcomed them with such 
deep respect, with kindness, and empa-
thy. ‘‘How can we help?,’’ was the ques-
tion I heard over and over again, and 
Sami’s Law is what has been produced 
as a result of that. 
Mr. Speaker, underscoring the need 
for Sami’s Law, in addition to the fake 
Uber driver that murdered her, last 
year declaring that, ‘‘We don’t believe 
corporate secrecy will make anyone 
safer,’’ Uber released its first safety re-
port. Uber found that over a 2-year pe-
riod, 2017 to 2018, the company received 
5,981 allegations of serious sexual as-
sault in the United States, and 19 peo-
ple were killed in physical assaults 
during or soon after an Uber ride. They 
also found that data shows that drivers 
report assaults at roughly the same 
rate as riders. 
Sami’s Law is designed to protect 
both, passengers and drivers. 
Uber supports Sami’s Law. 
Danielle Burr, head of Uber Federal 
Affairs, said, ‘‘The tragic death of 
Samantha Josephson left the rideshare 
community 
heartbroken 
and 
dev-
astated. Passage of ‘Sami’s Law’ is an-
other step in the ongoing work to help 
improve 
safety 
on 
rideshare 
by 
leveraging education and technology. 
We are grateful for . . . the support and 
the collaboration of the Josephson 
Family.’’ 
They have talked to the Uber folks, 
especially Danielle, over and over and 
over again and really have made a real-
ly, really lasting impression and dif-
ference. 
Again underscoring the need, CNN re-
ported last December that Lyft has 
been hit with more driver rape, sexual 
assault allegations: ‘‘Twenty more peo-
ple are suing Lyft over alleged sexual 
assault, sexual misconduct or rape by 
drivers while using its service. . . . The 
lawsuit comes on the heels of a similar 
lawsuit filed . . . on behalf of 14 anony-
mous women, in addition to numerous 
other individual suits that have been 
filed in recent months.’’ 
Dan Katz, Senior Director, Public Policy, 
Lyft, said: ‘‘The Josephson family and Con-
gressman Smith have worked tirelessly to 
champion Sami’s Law. Their determination 
has led to today’s passage in the U.S. House 
of Representatives. We have and will continue 
to prioritize safety within the Lyft community.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, Sami’s Law requires 
each transportation network company 
like Uber and Lyft to establish and im-
plement a system that makes available 
to each passenger a digital method to 
verify that the driver with whom the 
passenger has been matched has been 
authorized by the TNC prior, I say 
again, prior to beginning the trip. 
The bill stipulates in pertinent part 
that ‘‘Such a system shall include an 
initial notification sent to the pas-
senger’s mobile, or otherwise commu-
nicated to the passenger, containing 
verifiable information specific to the 
TNC driver or TNC vehicle with which 
the passenger has been matched.’’ 
That also puts into this whole system 
much more accountability. Everybody 
knows who is driving that car or that 
vehicle. 
All TNC companies that wish to con-
tinue operating in the U.S. must estab-
lish such a system within 90 days of en-
actment. 
I note in the early days of this legis-
lation, we discovered that we needed to 
make some changes. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the National Federation of the 
Blind, who helped craft provisions to 
the bill to ensure that there was a way 
for a passenger to use a nonvisual ar-
rangement to verify the authenticity 
of the TNC driver. 
Sami’s Law not only sets minimum 
safety requirements for today’s tech-
nology. It also puts into effect a proc-
ess for successor technology perform-
ance standards. 
It also establishes a 15-member advi-
sory council that reports to the Sec-
retary of Transportation, known as 
SAMI’s Council, comprised of Federal 
agency and public stakeholders to ad-
vance safety standards in the rideshare 
industry. 
I was so glad when Chairman DEFA-
ZIO at the hearing when we were talk-
ing about how you could just simply go 
on Amazon or Wal-Mart, anywhere, 
type in ‘‘Uber signage’’ or ‘‘signage,’’ 
and you can buy a sign. It is an en-
graved invitation to a predator to act 
like, particularly at or near our college 
campuses, in proximity to, and then to 
impersonate an Uber driver. 
I will never forget at the hearing 
after I mentioned the ease of buying an 
Uber sign in my testimony, the chair-
man pulled out his smartphone and 
then made a very, very, very good 
point about how easy it is to access 
that signage. 
Sami’s Law would make that unlaw-
ful. 
It also requires, a GAO report on the 
incidents of assault and abuse on both 
passengers and drivers, and requires 
that the GAO also examine the nature 
and specifics on background checks 
conducted by companies and the var-
ious standards set by States regarding 
background checks. 
We have got to know who is behind 
the wheel, and this certainly will help 
to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I have appre-
ciated the chairman’s focus on back-
ground checks for such a long time. 
This hopefully advances that concern. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me offer my 
profound gratitude to the professional 
staff. We all know how important they 
are. They really make a huge dif-
ference. They sweat the details, work 
on text. 
Mr. Speaker, let me begin. And this 
is not totally inclusive. I may have left 
somebody out, and I apologize. I thank 
Robert Edmonson, chief of staff to the 
Speaker; Emily Domenech and Will 
Durham, Republican Leader MCCAR-
THY’s office; Helen Zyblikewycz, who is 
staff director, T&I Subcommittee on 
Transit 
and 
Highways;

drafting and frequent redrafting of the 
text and insights he provided; Kelsey 
Griswold from my office; and my very, 
distinguished

of 
staff,

Speaker, again, I thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO; Ranking Member GRAVES; all 
Members who worked on this bill; my 
good friend Mr. SUOZZI, who was here 
not too long ago, another cosponsor of 
Mr. SMITH’s bill. 
This is a day that we ought to re-
member here in Congress as getting 
back to bipartisan solutions. 
As I said earlier, Sami Josephson, her 
life was tragically taken, but because 
of bipartisanship in this institution 
and good policy coming from good 
Members of Congress, her legacy will 
live on and protect many others like 
her from ever being put in the exact 
same position of getting in an Uber, a 
Lyft, or any other future ridesharing 
company’s vehicle without knowing ex-
actly if that car was coming to get her. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. SMITH 
again for his tireless advocacy. I thank 
all who worked on this. I look forward 
to seeing this bill pass unanimously, I 
hope. It should. 
But in the end, I also thank the com-
panies who worked with Members of 
Congress to put this good policy in 
place today that I urge everyone to 
support. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I think we have said what we needed 
to say here today on the floor. Nothing, 
nothing will ever totally heal Sami’s 
parents and friends, but this bill in her 
name will hopefully prevent there 
being any future tragedies like her 
death. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COURTNEY). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
4686, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the

(1) to identify water resources development 
projects authorized by Congress that are no 
longer viable for construction due to— 
(A) a lack of local support; 
(B) a lack of available Federal or non-Fed-
eral resources; or 
(C) an authorizing purpose that is no 
longer relevant or feasible; 
(2) to create an expedited and definitive 
process for Congress to deauthorize water re-
sources development projects that are no 
longer viable for construction; and 
(3) to allow the continued authorization of 
water resources development projects that 
are viable for construction.

which— 
(i) planning, design, or construction was 
not initiated before the date of enactment of 
this Act; or 
(ii) planning, design, or construction was 
initiated before the date of enactment of this 
Act, but for which no funds, Federal or non- 
Federal, were obligated for planning, design, 
or construction of the project or separable 
element of the project during the current fis-
cal year or any of the 10 preceding fiscal 
years.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7575, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we continue the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee tradition by considering 
the 
fourth 
consecutive 
bipartisan 
Water 
Resources 
Development 
Act 
since 2014, a tradition started by my 
friend and predecessor, Bill Shuster. It 
is a great tradition, and it is an incred-
ible service to our Nation. 
I am proud to be joined by Ranking 
Member SAM
GRAVES, Subcommittee 
Chair NAPOLITANO, and Subcommittee 
Ranking Member BRUCE WESTERMAN in 
sponsoring the Water Resources Devel-
opment Act of 2020. 
The bill under consideration today 
was developed in a bipartisan manner 
with input from both sides of the aisle. 
The legislation was considered in com-
mittee and favorably reported by voice 
vote. 
H.R. 7575 includes projects and policy 
provisions that impact communities 
across the Nation. It authorizes con-
struction of 34 projects studied and ap-
proved by the chief of engineers since 
WRDA 2018 was signed into law. 
It authorizes 36 new Corps of Engi-
neers feasibility studies and directs the 
Corps to expedite the completion of 41 
ongoing studies, which were submitted 
to the Corps by local sponsors willing 
to share the costs of these project stud-
ies. 
H.R. 7575 continues our work to en-
sure the full utilization of the harbor 
maintenance trust fund by unlocking 
nearly $10 billion. This is $10 billion 
under an initiative started by Ronald 
Reagan of taxes collected from ship-
pers that are ultimately paid by con-
sumers in the United States. So, for 
years, we have been taking money 
under false pretenses and not spending 
that money on its designated purpose. 
This bill will finally rectify that 
problem. There is ample need to invest 
that $10 billion in our ports and har-
bors around the country. 
The legislation also directs the Sec-
retary of the Army to equitably allo-
cate maintenance funds to pay for har-
bor 
operation 
maintenance 
needs, 
while addressing the ongoing needs of 
the Nation’s largest ports, the Great 
Lakes harbors, its emerging harbors. 
This is especially important in com-
munities like my district along Or-
egon’s southwest coast, where the dif-
ference between life and death for 
those who both recreate or fish com-
mercially is in the conditions of our 
harbors, jetties, and breakwaters. It is 
literally life and death in very cold 
water. So, this is incredibly important. 
Before earmarks were banned, I used 
to get my harbors dredged by ear-
marking. Since that was banned when 
the Republicans took over in 2010, I 
managed in the first WRDA bill in 2014 
to get a 10 percent set-aside for small 
and emerging harbors. That has pro-
vided the critical dredging for my dis-
trict and many, many harbors around 
the United States of America. 
This bill, because we will have a lot 
more money, will provide actually 20 
percent to small and emerging harbors. 
We have delayed and deferred projects 
all around the country. 
This bill also recognizes the impor-
tant role that inland waterways play in 
our Nation and provides a cost-share 
shift to help in completing construc-
tion of much-needed projects. I would 
give a shout-out to CONOR LAMB from 
Pennsylvania as being a tireless advo-
cate on that, as well as other Members. 
WRDA 2020 also includes specific 
policies that focus on climate change,

natural infrastructure solutions, and 
affordability, and provisions that assist 
minority, Tribal, and rural commu-
nities. 
The bill recognizes the important 
role of resiliency in helping commu-
nities meet the current and future 
challenges of changing hydrologic con-
ditions and repetitive and more fre-
quent flooding events. I am glad to in-
clude provisions in this bill that will 
ensure taxpayer dollars are spent on 
infrastructure that will be resilient 
and will contribute to the resiliency of 
communities across the country. 
It also ensures that all communities, 
especially communities with socio-
economic challenges, have a path for-
ward in getting the tools they need for 
flood protection and ecosystem res-
toration. H.R. 7575 continues this tradi-
tion with a 2-year extension of the 
process. 
We 
accommodated 
many, 
many 
Member requests from both sides of the 
aisle in this bill. There are some provi-
sions in this bill, however, that will 
need further review. This legislation 
continues in conference. 
For example, H.R. 7575 authorizes six 
projects where the studies were devel-
oped by the non-Federal interest under 
section 203 of WRDA–86. 
The committee has received letters 
of 
concern 
about 
whether 
these 
projects have undergone sufficient en-
vironmental review, which would in-
clude public input of an equivalent 
level to studies developed by the Corps 
of Engineers. These are valid questions, 
and they may require changes to the 
203 process as we go to conference with 
the Senate. 
I would like to recognize a few indi-
vidual members on the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure for 
their valuable contributions to this 
bill: Chairwoman GRACE NAPOLITANO, 
for her dogged support in addressing 
the maintenance needs of our largest 
ports, particularly southern California, 
and for meeting future water supply 
needs of arid regions around the Na-
tion, and the dedication of some of the 
newest members of my committee. 
The vice chairwoman of the sub-
committee is Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL 
from Florida, and her dedication to 
getting provisions to protect and re-
store the national treasure that is the 
Everglades was tireless. 
I also recognize the work of the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER) 
for her incredibly strong advocacy for 
the Port of Houston and their needs, 
and for the protection and sustain-
ability of the businesses and commu-
nities along the Texas Gulf Coast that 
depend upon that navigable area. 
I also recognize the new Member, the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Iowa 
(Ms. 
FINKENAUER), for her advocacy in ad-
dressing flooding risks of rural and eco-
nomically disadvantaged communities 
within the Mississippi River Valley. 
As I mentioned before, CONOR LAMB 
contributed. ANGIE CRAIG, Mr. PAPPAS 
from New Hampshire, Representative 
DELGADO, HARLEY ROUDA, and SHARICE 
DAVIDS, they were all instrumental in 
bringing important issues to the com-
mittee and contributed to the forma-
tion of WRDA 2020. 
The Water Resources Development 
Act 
is 
essential 
to 
communities 
throughout the country that depend 
upon the safe and affordable uses of 
their ports, harbors, and inland water-
ways. Our economy, safety, and envi-
ronment will benefit from passage of 
WRDA 2020. 
I am proud of our work on this bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to join me in 
support of this legislation. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, July 24, 2020. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: I write to con-
firm our mutual understanding regarding 
H.R. 7575, the Water Resources Development 
Act of 2020. H.R. 7575 contains provisions 
that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the 
Committee on the Budget. However, in order 
to expedite floor consideration of this impor-
tant legislation, the Committee agrees to 
waive formal consideration of the bill. 
The Committee on the Budget takes this 
action with the mutual understanding that, 
in doing so, we do not waive any jurisdiction 
over the subject matter contained in this or 
similar legislation, and that the Committee 
will be appropriately consulted and involved 
as the bill or similar legislation moves for-
ward so that we may address any remaining 
issues within our jurisdiction. The Com-
mittee also reserves the right to seek ap-
pointment to any House-Senate conference 
convened on this legislation or similar legis-
lation and requests your support if such a re-
quest is made. 
Thank you for agreeing to include our ex-
change of letters in the Congressional 
Record. I appreciate your cooperation re-
garding this legislation and look forward to 
continuing to work with you as this measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN A. YARMUTH, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES, COM-
MITTEE
ON TRANSPORTATION
AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, 
Washington, DC, July 24, 2020. 
Hon. JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman, Committee on the Budget, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. YARMUTH: Thank you for your 
letter regarding H.R 7575, the Water Re-
sources Development Act of 2020. I appre-
ciate your decision to waive formal consider-
ation of the bill. 
I agree that the Committee on the Budget 
has valid jurisdictional claims to certain 
provisions in this important legislation, and 
I further agree that by forgoing formal con-
sideration of the bill, the Committee on the 
Budget is not waiving any jurisdiction over 
any relevant subject matter. Additionally, I 
will support the appointment of conferees 
from the Committee on the Budget should a 
House-Senate conference be convened on this 
legislation. Finally, this exchange of letters 
will be included in the Congressional Record 
when the bill is considered on the floor. 
Thank you again and I look forward to 
continuing to work collaboratively with the 
Committee on the Budget on this important 
issue. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7575, the Water Resources De-
velopment Act of 2020, or WRDA 2020. 
Two weeks ago, we advanced this bi-
partisan legislation out of committee 
by voice vote. In taking up this bill, as 
the chairman pointed out, we are main-
taining 
Congress’ 
consideration 
of 
WRDA legislation on a 2-year cycle, 
something that we have done for some 
time now, since 2014. 
We are also demonstrating that when 
we work in partnership instead of par-
tisanship, we can accomplish great 
things for the infrastructure and for 
the American people. 
I want to thank all the members of 
the committee and staff, especially the 
Subcommittee on Water Resources and 
Environment, for their hard work and 
their willingness to work together on 
this important piece of legislation. 
WRDA authorizes 39 critical projects 
across the country that originate at 
the local level but provide far-reaching 
benefits throughout their regions and 
the national economy. 
WRDA is going to strengthen our 
American competitiveness. It is going 
to provide greater safeguards and peace 
of mind to our constituencies and help 
create jobs. Importantly, this bill sup-
ports the Nation’s inland waterway 
networks and flood protection infra-
structure. 
In my home State of Missouri, we ex-
perienced devastating high water in 
2019. RECORD flooding along the Mis-
souri River destroyed homes, farms, 
and businesses in communities like Big 
Lake and Craig, Missouri, and many of 
those affected are still recovering to 
this day. 
The threat of flooding remains for 
many Americans, and this bill author-
izes some bold new plans to evaluate 
flood risk reduction in many of the 
major river basins. 
This is a good first step to providing 
greater protections for the lives and 
property of the folks in the Lower Mis-
souri River Basin. My district also bor-
ders the Mississippi River, with local 
communities facing very similar chal-
lenges with flood control and naviga-
tion. 
To address these issues, WRDA pro-
vides new authority for the construc-
tion of permanent flood control struc-
tures in communities that experience 
repetitive losses as a result of flood 
events. We simply have to stop rebuild-
ing back to the same inadequate stand-
ards in repeatedly flooded communities 
like mine in north Missouri. 
This bill also streamlines the Public 
Law 84–99 program to ensure critical 
projects under this program can be 
done more efficiently and more effec-
tively.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3953 
July 29, 2020 
It has been more than a year since 
floods devastated parts of my district, 
and I am still getting calls from levee 
districts and communities on both the 
Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers 
about issues they are having with this 
program. Under this bill, some of that 
is going to be alleviated. 
The bill also delays construction and 
requires further evaluation of intercep-
tion-rearing complexes, or IRCs. These 
expensive and unproven projects are 
supposedly designed to save the pallid 
sturgeon, but we don’t know if they 
will actually do that. What we do know 
is that they are disastrous for naviga-
tion and disastrous for flood control 
along the Missouri River. 
This bill recognizes the Corps should 
not build any more IRCs until it is 
proven that they won’t negatively im-
pact navigation and flood protection 
for many of our towns, farms, and busi-
nesses along the river. 
Additionally, this legislation pro-
vides important new tools and funding 
set-asides for rural communities. It en-
sures that major construction and re-
habilitation efforts on the inland wa-
terway system are completed more 
quickly, and it offsets new project au-
thorizations with deauthorizations of 
old, out-of-date projects to ensure fis-
cal responsibility. 
This is a commonsense, bipartisan 
bill, and I want to thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO, Chairwoman NAPOLITANO, and 
Ranking Member WESTERMAN for their 
partnership in this bipartisan effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support H.R. 7575, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Water Resources Devel-
opment Act. 
This bill, which was artfully and 
carefully drafted by Chairman DEFAZIO 
and the chair of the Water Resources 
and Environment Subcommittee, Con-
gresswoman NAPOLITANO, enjoys broad 
bipartisan support. 
In particular, this bill includes provi-
sions that will protect the Great 
Lakes, which contain 90 percent of 
North America’s fresh surface water. 
It includes a specific authorization of 
the invasive species control system at 
Brandon Road Lock and Dam. Once 
completed, Brandon Road will prevent 
Asian carp and other invasive species 
from entering the Great Lakes. 
The Great Lakes delegation has 
fought for that authorization for near-
ly a decade. Since 2010, when Congress 
authorized the Great Lakes interbasin 
study, our delegation has worked for a 
long-term and basin-wide solution to 
the threat posed by the Asian carp. 
Today’s authorization is not the end, 
but it sends a bipartisan and clear mes-
sage to our Nation that we take the 
protection of America’s greatest $7 bil-
lion recreational, fishery, and fresh-
water system seriously. 
In addition to the bill’s commitment 
to the Brandon Road project, I also 
commend the committee and its chair 
for taking important steps updating re-
quirements for resiliency, embedding 
beneficial reuse into the Corps’ project 
development process, and investing and 
rebuilding the Nation’s water infra-
structure for the 21st century, all of 
which will create good jobs across this 
Nation. 
Let me applaud Chairman DEFAZIO 
and the ranking member for their care-
ful work to develop a bipartisan bill. 
The Water Resources Development Act 
of 2020 enjoys broad support and will 
ensure our Nation’s continued pros-
perity.

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN), who 
is on the Water Resources and Environ-
ment Subcommittee. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Republican leader and our 
ranking member, Mr. GRAVES
from 
Missouri, for their continued leader-
ship on the consideration of the Water 
Resource 
Development 
Acts, 
or 
WRDAs. 
Today I rise in strong support of H.R. 
7575, WRDA 2020. H.R. 7575 strengthens 
our Nation’s ability to withstand se-
vere weather and flood events. It au-
thorizes the construction of key water 
infrastructure projects, creates jobs 
here at home, and directly contributes 
to our economic growth and competi-
tiveness. 
The Subcommittee on Water Re-
sources and Environment, where I have 
the honor of serving as ranking mem-
ber, has jurisdiction over the water re-
sources development missions of the 
U.S. Corps of Engineers. H.R. 7575 au-
thorizes vital Corps projects for navi-
gation; flood control; shoreline protec-
tion; recreation; water supply; environ-
mental protection, restoration, and en-
hancement; and fish and wildlife man-
agement. 
This WRDA bill focuses on sup-
porting more resilient infrastructure, 
increasing rural flood protection, ad-
dressing the maintenance backlogs at 
our Nation’s ports and harbors, and 
prioritizes our Nation’s inland water-
ways. 
This bill will help key projects in my 
home State of Arkansas that will spur 
economic development and prevent fur-
ther environmental degradation. It ad-
vances the long-stalled MKARNS deep-
ening project, protects the water sup-
ply for users of the Ouachita-Black sys-
tem, and begins the process of pre-
venting bank destabilization of the 
Sulphur River. 
Our committee passed this bill 2 
weeks ago by a voice vote, continuing 
the strong bipartisan support and the 
WRDA tradition. 
H.R. 7575 is fiscally responsible, with 
new project authorizations fully offset 
by deauthorizations of projects that 
are outdated or no longer viable. 
Above all, this legislation represents 
the continued bipartisan commitment 
to regular order for consideration of 
water resources projects. Regularly 
overseeing the improvement of our Na-
tion’s infrastructure is one of Congress’ 
most important responsibilities. 
This is a good, commonsense bill, and 
I want to thank Chair DEFAZIO and es-
pecially Chair NAPOLITANO for her lead-
ership on our Water Resources and En-
vironment Subcommittee, and both of 
them for working across the aisle with 
us. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to rec-
ognize the incredible staff work on 
both sides of the aisle, but, in par-
ticular, the Republican staff, which in-
cludes Ian Bennitt, Jon Pawlow, and 
Victor Sarmiento. I also want to recog-
nize Jefferson Deming on my staff for 
his work. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support H.R. 7575. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I in-
cluded in the RECORD a letter from 
Chairman JOHN
YARMUTH
from the 
House Committee on the Budget agree-
ing to waive consideration of H.R. 7575, 
as amended, as well as my response to 
Chairman YARMUTH expressing appre-
ciation for his willingness to work co-
operatively on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I also include in the 
RECORD several letters of support from 
organizations and stakeholders in sup-
port of H.R. 7575. 
JULY 28, 2020. 
DEAR MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES, 
The farmers, ranchers, food and beverage 
manufacturers, processors, package suppliers 
and agricultural product marketers that 
comprise our memberships are dedicated to 
providing the safe, abundant and affordable 
food, fiber and feed required to ensure our 
country stays healthy and fed. 
Because American agriculture’s competi-
tive advantage largely depends upon the 
quality, reliability, accessibility and cost-ef-
fectiveness of the national transportation 
system, our organizations commend Con-
gress for consistently examining water infra-
structure projects every two years and write 
today to urge your support of H.R. 7575, the 
Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) 
of 2020. 
As you know, agricultural commodities 
move via truck, rail, barge and ocean-going 
vessels. Consistent and timely focus on the 
U.S. inland waterways transportation net-
work is vital to agricultural stakeholders be-
cause 20 percent of a farmer’s income de-
pends on exports. Inland waterway barge 
transportation is the least expensive, most 
efficient and most environmentally friendly 
mode, and U.S. locks and dams help relieve 
congestion and wear-and-tear on highways as 
well as discipline rail rates. 
With respect to U.S. port and inland water-
ways infrastructure, H.R. 7575 includes two 
notable provisions we wish to highlight. 
Both Section 101 concerning the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) and Sec-
tion 108 pertaining to inland waterways 
projects would positively affect the ability of 
our organizations’ members to fulfill their 
role in the agricultural value chain to serve 
American farmers and domestic and global 
customers. 
As you know, the intent of Section 101 of 
H.R. 7575 is to ‘‘unlock’’ the more than $9 bil-
lion that’s been collected and deposited in 
the HMTF by those that pay the 0.125 per-
cent ad valorem tax based upon the value of

cargo imports. The inability thus far to ac-
cess and spend those dollars on much-needed 
port dredging further has eroded the United 
States’ comparative transportation advan-
tage and contributed to lost export opportu-
nities to the detriment of U.S. economic 
growth. Our organizations strongly support 
Section 101, which would provide critical and 
overdue access to the existing balance in the 
HMTF so that these funds can be spent on 
dredging as intended. 
In addition, we believe that adjusting the 
cost-share formula for inland waterway con-
struction and major rehabilitation of naviga-
tion projects, as proposed in Section 108 of 
H.R. 7575, is a prudent policy that would help 
address a critical problem facing our inland 
waterways transportation system. As you 
know, the majority of U.S. locks and dams 
are operating on borrowed time, having long 
outlived their 50-year design life. Further, 
most are not of sufficient capacity to handle 
modem 1,200-foot barge tows, and others re-
quire more maintenance. Each of these fac-
tors costs shippers valuable time and re-
sources. 
Section 108 amends the cost-share formula 
for the construction and major rehabilita-
tion of each inland waterways navigation 
project from the current 50 percent general 
revenue and 50 percent Inland Waterways 
Trust Fund (IWTF) funding to 65 percent 
general revenue and 35 percent IWTF. The 
policy is a step in the right direction that 
would expedite completion of such projects 
and help bring the U.S. inland waterways 
transportation system into the 21st century. 
For these reasons, we support making per-
manent the cost share formula adjustment 
in H.R. 7575 to provide certainty for these 
projects, which reduces construction costs. 
Our organizations strongly support passage 
of H.R. 7575 because Section 101 and Section 
108 would enhance U.S. agriculture’s com-
petitiveness, contribute to the overall effi-
ciency of the U.S. transportation system, 
and promote overall U.S. economic growth 
and job creation. We urge you to support and 
approve this critical infrastructure bill so 
that negotiations can proceed with the Sen-
ate with the goal of enacting a new WRDA 
law in 2020.

Re Water Resources Development Act of 
2020. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER GRAVES: The American Association 
of Port Authorities (AAPA) supports passage 
of H.R. 7575, the Water Resources Develop-
ment Act of 2020 through the House of Rep-
resentatives. On behalf of our 78 United 
States member ports, AAPA appreciates that 
this legislation expands the budget cap ad-
justment to all the Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund revenues for the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers (Corps) which would 
unlock approximately $10 billion from the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. We are 
pleased to see that the legislation recognizes 
the needs of donor ports, emerging harbors 
and Great Lakes navigation projects and 
look forward to working with you prior to 
enactment on these provisions. 
The legislation also authorizes new naviga-
tion channel improvement studies as well as 
authorizing projects to proceed to construc-
tion. The legislation continues to improve 
the efficiency and cost effectiveness of Corps 
study efforts and product delivery. These ef-
forts are essential for our Nation’s future 
economic growth as well as providing family 
supporting jobs. 
I thank you for your work on these issues 
and others related to maritime infrastruc-
ture, both included in this bill and other-
wise. Our Association looks forward to work-
ing with you, your Committee staff, and the 
rest of Congress on passage of this legisla-
tion. 
Respectfully, 
CHRISTOPHER J. CONNOR, 
President and CEO.

Speaker NANCY PELOSI, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Re H.R. 7575, the Water Resources Develop-
ment Act of 2020. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the Associated 
General Contractors of America (AGC)—the 
leading association in the construction in-
dustry representing more than 27,000 firms, 
including America’s leading general contrac-
tors, specialty-contracting firms, service 
providers, and suppliers—I urge you to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 7575, the Water Resources De-
velopment Act of 2020, which is expected to 
be considered by the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives under the suspension of the 
rules this week. 
H.R. 7575 is an essential step forward as 
Congress works to continue the biennial 
process of passing legislation that invests in 
our nation’s water resources infrastructure. 
The predictability of the biennial passage of 
water resources development acts is critical 
for all stakeholders invoked in the planning 
and execution of water resources projects. 
Through these investments, H.R. 7575 will 
create jobs, improve the quality of life for all 
Americans, protect our communities, facili-
tate waterborne commerce, restore environ-
mentally sensitive areas of the country, and 
help grow our economy. 
AGC appreciates that the bill will help en-
sure that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
(Corps) Civil Works Program is appro-
priately responsive to the water resources 
needs identified by local communities. Spe-
cifically, the bill authorizes more than 30 
pending Corps Chief’s Reports, which will fa-
cilitate important water resources projects 
across the country, authorizes dozens of new 
feasibility studies, and expedites the comple-
tion of many existing feasibility studies. In 
addition, AGC supports the provisions of 
H.R. 7575 that ensure funds from the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund go towards their in-
tended uses, extend a pilot program that al-
lows non-federal interests to carry out feasi-
bility studies and projects, and modify the 
cost share of projects funded by the Inland 
Waterways Trust Fund, among others. 
AGC applauds the bipartisan process used 
to develop H.R. 7575 and is hopeful that the 
House and U.S. Senate will reach an agree-
ment between their respective legislative 
proposals this year. Again, AGC urges you to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 7575 and looks forward to 
working with the Congress as the legislative 
process continues. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES V. CHRISTIANSON, 
Vice President, Government Relations.

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO, 
CHAIRWOMAN 
NAPOLITANO, RANKING MEMBER GRAVES, AND 
RANKING MEMBER WESTERMAN: On behalf of 
the Port of Los Angeles, I am writing to 
thank you for your leadership in advancing 
the Water Resources Development Act of 
2020 and to express our strong support for its 
swift enactment. 
Combined, the San Pedro Bay ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach handle more than 
one third of the nation’s containerized im-
ports and exports. In fact, every single Con-
gressional district in the nation is reached 
by the goods moving through the San Pedro 
bay, so maintaining the in-water infrastruc-
ture at these ports is essential for American 
competitiveness in the global economy. 
In previous communications we noted that 
historically the San Pedro Bay ports receive 
a disproportionately low return of Harbor 
Maintenance Trust (HMT) revenues, and 
what we do receive cannot be used for vital 
infrastructure maintenance. We are grateful 
that you have recognized the importance of 
equity for donor ports in your legislation 
and addressed these priorities: 
Fair share of HMT funding for donor ports. 
Expanded uses for emerging harbors and 
donor ports. 
Extension of the 2106 program for donor 
and energy transfer ports. 
A robust and healthy port industry is vital 
to our nation’s economy. Donor ports, such 
as the Port of Los Angeles, play a funda-
mental role in supporting the national 
freight system and the Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund. Full spend of HMT revenues (in-
cluding the trust fund balance), and fair and 
equitable allocations, will ensure that this 
important funding is used to enhance our na-
tion’s competitiveness. 
Language in the recently passed CARES 
Act includes ‘‘full-spend’’ to be implemented 
with either the passage of WRDA reauthor-
ization or in January 2021. This makes ad-
dressing donor equity and expanded uses ex-
tremely urgent and I am grateful for your 
work to address these vital issues and am 
happy to express my strong support for this 
bi-partisan legislation. 
We applaud your efforts to address this 
vital infrastructure need and hope to work

WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT 
INCLUDES WINS FOR WILDLIFE, COMMUNITIES 
WASHINGTON, DC—The Water Resources 
Development Act of 2020, which is being 
marked up by the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee, includes numer-
ous provisions to advance ecosystem restora-
tion and strengthen climate resilience. The 
Senate Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee reported out a related bill, America’s 
Water Infrastructure Act of 2020, earlier this 
year. 
‘‘Nature has long been an underutilized 
tool in the Army Corps’ toolbox. This bill 
takes important steps to remedy this, with a 
suite of reforms that remove barriers to 
using healthy rivers, floodplains, wetlands 
and shorelines to protect communities from 
hurricanes and floods,’’ said Melissa Samet, 
senior water resources counsel at the Na-
tional Wildlife Federation. ‘‘The National 
Wildlife Federation is grateful for the strong 
leadership 
of 
Chairman 
DeFazio, 
Sub-
committee Chair Napolitano, Ranking Mem-
ber Sam Graves and Subcommittee Ranking 
Member Westerman for their bipartisan ef-
forts to advance important provisions to pro-
tect frontline communities and vital eco-
systems 
including 
the 
Everglades, 
Mis-
sissippi River Delta, and Great Lakes.’’ 
The National Wildlife Federation supports 
many important provisions of this bill, in-
cluding: 
Provisions that remove barriers to, and 
drive use of natural infrastructure, including 
by ensuring that natural infrastructure solu-
tions will benefit from the same cost-share 
requirements as non-structural measures. 
Careful evaluation of natural infrastruc-
ture solutions to protect communities from 
storms and floods, including a robust pilot 
program that provides full federal funding 
for flood and storm risk reduction studies for 
economically 
disadvantaged 
communities 
and ensures robust evaluation of natural in-
frastructure solutions. 
Implementation of the Water Resources 
Principles, 
Requirements 
and 
Guidelines 
(PR&G) by the Corps, including fully engag-
ing the public in that effort. Effective imple-
mentation of the PR&G will bring the Corps’ 
water resources planning process in line with 
21st Century water resources management 
principles, and improve water resources 
planning across the board. 
Comprehensive review of the Corps’ miti-
gation record by the Government Account-
ability Office. Ensuring full compliance with 
mitigation requirements is critical for fish 
and wildlife and for the communities and 
economies that rely on these vital resources.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
July 14, 2020. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO,

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER GRAVES: The U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce applauds the bipartisan approach 
taken by your Committee in advance of to-
morrow’s markup of the Water Resources 
Development Act (WRDA) of 2020. Reauthor-
ization of America’s water resources pro-
grams is critical to economic growth and en-
vironmental stewardship, and we support 
this legislation. 
WRDA would ensure the viability of the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Civil Works 
programs including navigation, flood risk 
management, recreation, and associated en-
vironmental infrastructure. Enactment of 
this bill would provide critical economic and 
environmental benefits to the United States. 
Reauthorizing these programs prior to 
their September 30 expiration would provide 
the certainty of federal commitment needed 
to allow state, local, and private partners to 
move forward with needed planning and con-
struction of modern, resilient infrastructure. 
These important water projects would bring 
economic benefits to both rural and urban 
regions. 
The Chamber also applauds the inclusion 
of 34 new project authorizations, additional 
provisions to ensure modern, resilient infra-
structure, improvements in water supply de-
livery, and increased investment from the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, a long-time 
priority of both your Committee and the 
Chamber. 
With less than three months until the cur-
rent authorization expires, the Chamber is 
pleased that House leadership anticipates 
floor consideration of the bill later this 
month. We appreciate your Committee mov-
ing promptly to ensure timely action on 
these critical issues.

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER GRAVES: The members of Waterways 
Council, Inc. (WCI) thank you for your lead-
ership and commitment to the Water Re-
sources and Development Act (WRDA) bien-
nial process. 
America’s inland waterways system in-
cludes 12,000 miles of commercially operated 
and maintained navigable channels that di-
rectly affect 38 states. The inland waterways 
system is tasked with transporting the na-
tion’s bulk commodities that keep America 
competitive in the most energy-efficient and 
environmentally friendly way. In 2016, 558 
million tons of commodities valued at $300 
billion transited the waterways, supporting 
541,000 American jobs. 
WCI thanks you for Section 108. This sec-
tion adjusts the cost-share formula for the 
construction and major rehabilitation of in-
land waterways navigation projects from the 
current 50 percent general revenue and 50 
percent 
Inland 
Waterways 
Trust 
Fund 
(IWTF) to 65 percent general revenue and 35 
percent IWTF for seven years. The policy is 
a step in the right direction and will help ex-
pedite the completion of inland waterways 
construction 
and 
major 
rehabilitation 
projects during the applicable years. WCI 
looks forward to working with the Com-
mittee as they proceed to conference on 
making the cost-share permanent. 
Passing this legislation in regular order is 
critical to ensuring waterways reliability in 
order to keep America competitive. WCI of-
fers its support of passing WRDA 2020.

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. GARCI´A), who is a member of the 
committee. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of the Water Re-
sources Development Act of 2020 and 
commend the leadership of Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Subcommittee on Water 
Resources 
and 
Environment 
Chair 
NAPOLITANO. 
I hail from Chicago and the Nation’s 
Gold Coast along Lake Michigan, and 
we know how important a healthy 
Great Lakes system is. Lake Michigan 
is not only Chicago’s primary drinking 
water source, it is part of the largest 
freshwater source in the world—our be-
loved Great Lakes. 
Lake Michigan is a tremendous rec-
reational resource and economic asset, 
and it needs to be protected. This legis-
lation authorizes projects important to 
my constituents. 
First, the Brandon Road Lock and 
Dam project must be completed to pre-
vent Asian carp, an invasive species, 
from migrating into Lake Michigan. 
We must also restore Bubbly Creek, a 
degraded waterway that was polluted 
by Chicago’s meatpacking industry in 
the early 1900s and made famous by 
Upton Sinclair’s ‘‘The Jungle.’’ Restor-
ing the waterway will create a healthy 
ecosystem and benefit neighborhoods 
like McKinley Park, Bridgeport, and 
Pilsen. 
Managing storm water systems can 
be challenging in Chicago because it is 
heavily urbanized. This bill promotes 
more natural infrastructure and stud-
ies for Chicago area rivers and the 
Great Lakes river basins to make sure 
future projects preserve our drinking 
water, protect people’s homes and busi-
nesses from flooding, and restore our 
environment so that all communities 
benefit from our rivers and Great 
Lakes. 
I am proud of the bipartisan effort 
developing and passing this legislation 
through the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee.

I also want to give a shout-out to my 
incredible Brookings Institution fel-
low, Christine Gallagher, who has done 
tremendous work for my office on 
transportation and water issues. This 
is her last week before she returns to 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, and I congratulate 
her. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise also, 
today, in support of the Water Re-
sources and Development Act of 2020. 
This piece of legislation is a top pri-
ority for my constituents in south 
Florida on the Treasure Coast because 
it is critical to our public health, our 
environment, and our economy. 
Now, I am smiling because this legis-
lation includes a number of provisions 
that I was proud to write to protect 
Florida’s waterways, including accel-
erating construction of the EAA res-
ervoir, reducing discharges from Lake 
Okeechobee to the St. Lucie Estuary, 
and to combat harmful algal blooms— 
all yeomen’s work. 
Now, 
demanding 
that 
the 
Army 
Corps of Engineers must seek to reduce 
discharges into our coastal estuaries is 
a huge victory that everybody in our 
community should be proud of. 
However, I ask my colleagues this: If 
their constituents were being, literally, 
poisoned by the Federal Government, 
would they fight for anything less than 
a complete stop to that poisoning? 
That is why I am going to continue 
to be in this fight with everything that 
I have got, build on this momentum to 
eliminate all toxic discharges into my 
community and send more water south 
into Florida’s Everglades. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. LAMB), who is a member 
of the committee and who was key in 
getting the additional investments in 
the inland waterways. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, others be-
fore me have said why it matters that 
we have working locks and dams. It 
has always mattered. 
The United States has more miles of 
navigable rivers, lakes, and canals than 
anywhere else in the world. It made us 
who we are as a nation. We could move 
iron ore to make steel faster, cheaper, 
and easier than all of our competitors 
because of our water, but especially be-
cause of our locks and dams that con-
trol the water. So we need to fix them, 
and this bill will help. 
I hope that America will take note of 
something else here today, which is 
that this Congress still works. It might 
not be as well as people would want 
every single day, but this is a major 
bill. This is a major infrastructure bill, 
and this is a major infrastructure bill 
that has been bipartisan from the very 
beginning and, hopefully, will end bi-
partisan when our friends in the Senate 
work with us to get this done. 
I want to give a special thanks to my 
Republican friend and colleague from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN). Together, we led a 
big group of Members from both parties 
in support of a better way to fund these 
locks and dams. 
I especially want to thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES, 
who agreed. Now we have a better 
chance to rebuild the locks and dams 
and to deliver on the promise we made 
to the American people. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES), who is 
the ranking member of the Aviation 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I want to com-
mend Republicans and Democrats for 
coming together. This bill is a bipar-
tisan bill. It doesn’t mean it is perfect, 
but it means that we all came together 
and we worked together to ensure that 
we are advancing our Nation’s water 
resources. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill does every-
thing from ecological restoration, to 
our navigation channels, to flood con-
trol, to hurricane protection. 
This is about the resilience and sus-
tainability of our community and the 
resilience and sustainability of our 
ecosystem and our economy. These are 
projects that we need to be working to-
gether on. 
I want to thank my friend, the chair-
man, Mr. DEFAZIO; the ranking mem-
ber, SAM GRAVES; as well as the sub-
committee—friends—chairman 
and 
ranking member, GRACE
NAPOLITANO 
and BRUCE WESTERMAN. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill advances im-
portant priorities like ensuring section 
1043 can be expanded to allow our State 
and non-Federal sponsors to be a part-
ner with the Corps of Engineers—a true 
partner—and lead some sections of the 
projects; allowing our continuing au-
thorities programs to be expanded; in-
corporating tools like natural infra-
structure into the toolbox of achieving 
these objectives that we all share; en-
suring that we attack—and I want to 
thank my friend from Florida (Mr. 
MAST) for leading on this—the harmful 
algal blooms off the coast of Louisiana, 
which I represent, largest dead zone in 
this Nation on a national basis; and 
importantly, ensuring that we main-
tain and take a different sustainable 
approach to the authorized depth of the 
Mississippi River system, which is 
America’s 
commerce 
superhighway, 
connecting 31 States with the least ex-
pensive and lowest emissions form of 
transportation; putting shipments on 
barges and on oceangoing vessels so 
America can compete globally with the 
great products that we develop here. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all the 
great staff who worked on this, includ-
ing Ian Bennitt, Victor Sarmiento, 
Ryan Seiger, Maggie Ayrea, Paul Saw-
yer, and all the folks who helped put 
this bill together. I urge adoption. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. RUIZ). 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, the Water 
Resources Development Act contains 
important language to help prevent a 
public health crisis at the Salton Sea, 
California’s largest lake, which is in 
my district. 
The Salton Sea’s shoreline is rapidly 
receding, exposing thousands of acres 
of lake bed and sending dust loaded 
with selenium and pesticides into the 
air and into the lungs of residents in 
my district. 
My 
provision 
will 
authorize 
the 
Army Corps of Engineers to take the 
next steps and study the construction 
of a northern perimeter lake project at 
the sea, which is the next major 
project under the State of California’s 
Salton Sea Management Program, and 
it will strengthen the Federal-State 
partnership. 
Later this week, we will pass the En-
ergy and Water Development appro-
priations bill, which contains another 
one 
of 
my 
provisions 
which 
will 
prioritize the Army Corps’ efforts at 
the Salton Sea. 
I would like to thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO, Congressman VARGAS, and 
Congresswoman NAPOLITANO for their 
partnership on this pressing and impor-
tant issue, and I urge support for this 
legislation. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), who 
is the ranking member on the High-
ways and Transit Subcommittee. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
GRAVES for his leadership on this issue 
and also the ranking member of the 
Water 
Resources 
and 
Environment 
Subcommittee, 
a 
good 
friend, 
Mr. 
WESTERMAN, 
along 
with 
Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Chair NAPOLITANO of the 
Water 
Resources 
and 
Environment 
Subcommittee. 
This is a great day. This is a continu-
ation of what was started in 2014 under 
Chairman Shuster at the time, and it 
was with bipartisan success that we 
began getting the water resource devel-
opment bills passed on a 2-year basis. 
This is another shining example of 
what bipartisan work can do. We are 
here to talk about the successes of au-
thorizing all of the Corps of Engineers’ 
programs, which is extremely impor-
tant to my district, which is sur-
rounded by the inland waterway sys-
tem. 
If we don’t do our job in this institu-
tion in the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee to pass a Water 
Resources Development Act on a bian-
nual basis, then what happens is we put 
the effectiveness of our farmers and 
our manufacturers from getting their 
products from their manufacturing fa-
cilities or their fields into the inland 
waterway system and out into the 
global marketplace in a cost-effective 
way and in a way that is going to allow 
them to continue to provide jobs in my 
district. 
One aspect of this bill I am particu-
larly grateful for is the cost share ad-
justment in the Inland Waterways 
Trust Fund. This is a big deal for us to

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BARRAGA´ N). 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman DEFAZIO for working 
in a bipartisan manner, and sub-
committee Chairwoman NAPOLITANO, 
to make sure this bill got through on a 
bipartisan basis. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud that two 
policy changes that I led the fight for 
have been included in this legislation. 
Flooding disproportionately impacts 
low-economic communities and people 
of color. 
Mr. Speaker, 18 months ago, a severe 
storm in my district flooded the streets 
of Compton and shut down parts of the 
710 freeway. Many communities lack 
the money to pay for studies to plan 
and develop projects that can reduce 
damage from flooding and storms. As 
part of a new program funded by this 
bill, the Federal Government will now 
cover 100 percent of the cost of these 
studies for a select number of disadvan-
taged communities. 
This bill also makes it less costly for 
communities to restore nature in ways 
that will reduce the risk of flooding 
and help provide cleaner air and water. 
For example, it will be easier to re-
store areas where water covers the soil, 
known 
as 
wetlands, 
such 
as 
the 
Dominguez Gap Wetlands along the Los 
Angeles River. Or we can more easily 
afford planting street trees and trees in 
local parks to absorb flood water, cool 
the community, and clean the air. 
In short, this bill will make our com-
munities stronger, built to last, and 
better prepared for the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the Water Resources Development Act 
of 2020. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I appreciate the gentleman yielding 
me time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
the Water Resources Development Act 
of 2020. I appreciate the Committee on 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
bringing us a strong bipartisan prod-
uct, of which you have heard. This 
meets the water management needs 
across our country. 
The Third District of Nebraska was 
heavily impacted by unprecedented 
flooding last year. These floods ravaged 
farmland, destroyed essential infra-
structure, like highways, water treat-
ment plants, and levees that had with-
stood the test of time for decades. The 
Army Corps of Engineers has worked 
within their authority to address these 
water management issues around our 
State; however, they have not been 
able to address every concern. 
I appreciate the chairman and rank-
ing member working with me to ensure 
inactive levees have an opportunity to 
receive 
assistance 
from 
the 
Army 
Corps of Engineers if they meet certain 
criteria. Peru, Nebraska, is one of the 
many 
communities 
that 
could 
be 
helped by this legislative language. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bipar-
tisan bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CUELLAR). 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO and Ranking Mem-
ber GRAVES and their staff for the won-
derful work that they did for putting 
this bipartisan bill together, and also 
Chairwoman GRACE NAPOLITANO. 
Mr. Speaker, for the last 14 years, I 
have been working in Congress to advo-
cate for the full authorized funding of 
Laredo, Texas’ Chacon Creek Restora-
tion Project. 
The Army Corps now, once we get 
this done, can carry out the flood risk 
management and ecosystem project to-
taling about $52 million. The flood 
mitigation component will evacuate 
250 homes from the floodplain, from 
Lake Casa Blanca all the way down to 
the Rio Grande along the Chacon 
Creek. 
This ecosystem restoration compo-
nent will also include 417 acres of wet-
land and riparian restoration. This is a 
natural treasure that we have in La-
redo, Texas, and it will provide hun-
dreds of acres of new recreational and 
educational parklands. 
Mr. Speaker, the Chacon Creek is a 
tremendous natural resource in La-
redo, and I thank the ranking member 
and committee staff for doing this 
great work. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member GRAVES and Chair-
man DEFAZIO. 
Mr. Speaker, Southeast Texas is the 
global leader in creating reliable, af-
fordable energy that powers America 
and, quite frankly, much of the world. 
But we can’t do that without modern-
izing and improving our water infra-
structure, which it is my honor to have 
achieved in this bill for the people of 
the 36th Congressional District of 
Texas, and by extension, all American 
families. 
My district has four ports, including 
the main port terminal of the Port of 
Houston. The Houston Ship Channel is 
the busiest U.S. deep-draft waterway, 
and it is the top exporting port in the 
Nation. 
This bill turns years of advocacy to 
dredge, widen, and improve two-way 
traffic on the Houston Ship Channel 
into real results. This will allow for a 
more efficient, safe, and productive wa-
terway for all. But I also recognize 
that there is still much work to be 
done. It is not an exaggeration to say 
that by spending $1 million today on 
hurricane and flood prevention infra-
structure, we can save a billion dollars 
in damages down the road from an-
other storm like Hurricane Harvey, 
which dumped 60 inches of rain on my 
district—a North American rainfall 
record, by the way. 
Thankfully, this bill contains numer-
ous provisions for me and my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle that 
work to address these critical needs. It 
is a great honor to serve the people of 
Southeast Texas in Congress in pro-
ducing 
legislation 
like 
this 
bipartisanly—one of the biggest rea-
sons why. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank the bipar-
tisan work of the chairman, the rank-
ing member, and also the staff and the 
subcommittee chair. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington State (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, in Washington State, 
we are blessed with an abundance of 
rivers and lakes that support fish and 
wildlife. Right now, projects like modi-
fying tide gates and restoring or recon-
necting floodplains and wetlands are 
not getting the priority they need to 
protect these important ecosystems. 
I am so pleased that the bill I intro-
duced with Congressman RICK LARSEN 
was included in WRDA. By prioritizing 
rivers with the greatest chance of re-
covery, we have the best shot at pro-
tecting these waterways and achieving 
the largest return on our investments. 
Healthy rivers mean clean water for 
fish, wildlife, and communities, and 
healthy salmon runs help us meet our 
treaty rights obligations, ensure thriv-
ing local economies and recreational 
opportunities, and protect our endan-
gered salmon and orca populations. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from West Virginia (Mrs. MIL-
LER). 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO and Ranking Mem-
ber GRAVES. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this year’s bipartisan Water Re-
sources Development Act. 
Our country was built on an elabo-
rate system of inland waterways, ports, 
and harbors to facilitate trade and 
transportation. And nearly every com-
munity in our country relies on open 
waterways to move their products. 
My district is no exception. We are 
home to the Port of Huntington Tri- 
State on the Ohio River. This inter-
connected water system creates jobs 
and ensures that Appalachia remains a 
competitive 
region 
of 
economic 
growth.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3958 
July 29, 2020 
As we rethink and reform America’s 
supply chains post-COVID, we must 
continue to open, update, and mod-
ernize key water infrastructure to 
maintain safety and efficiency. WRDA 
investments secure this mission. 
WRDA also delivers protection from 
hurricanes and flooding. In my district 
in southern West Virginia, we saw dis-
aster strike in 2016 when our dams 
overflowed, and our rivers tore through 
many vibrant communities. As we re-
cover and rebuild, we must also prepare 
for the future. 
If we pass this bill, we can double the 
funding for flood protection in central 
West Virginia and triple the funding in 
southern West Virginia. The vast ma-
jority of American communities lie 
along key U.S. waterways. And while I 
work for my district, countless others 
will also see increased protections. 
Mr. Speaker, for the good of our 
country, I implore my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman and the ranking member. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the 2020 Water Resources Develop-
ment Act, a bill that includes language 
that I fought for to ensure that the 
Federal Government not just supports 
and funds flood control projects, but 
also supports those projects in eco-
nomically disadvantaged communities. 
For too long, the Army Corps has re-
lied on an outdated metric when mak-
ing decisions whether or not to invest. 
Unfortunately, it is a metric that 
doesn’t always capture the project’s 
full value, including the potential loss 
of valuable agricultural land, like that 
in the Pajaro Valley in my district on 
the central coast of California. 
Mr. Speaker, I have to say, though, 
with continued pressure by me and 
many other stakeholders, I am proud 
that the 2020 WRDA contains language 
that directs the Army Corps when they 
re-scope projects to take into account 
non-Federal interests, especially in 
economically disadvantaged commu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and 
ranking member for their leadership on 
WRDA, and I look forward to working 
with them to reach a final compromise 
with the Senate that maintains this 
language to properly invest in all com-
munities, not just to save money, but 
to save lives. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS). 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Chairman DEFAZIO 
and Ranking Member GRAVES for in-
cluding my request to fund Section 531, 
the program for Southern and Eastern 
Kentucky. 
In the region that I serve, we are still 
fighting for clean water and reliable 
wastewater systems for our families, 
our schools, and our businesses. Many 
of our folks, like those in Martin Coun-
ty, are often forced to boil water be-
cause lines are failing, and believe it or 
not, we are still finding straight pipes 
dumping raw sewage into some of our 
beautiful streams. 
Thanks to Section 531, some 35,000 
families in Southern and Eastern Ken-
tucky now have their own septic sys-
tem or access to a reliable wastewater 
system, and over 90 percent of my rural 
region now has access to clean water. 
But it should be 100 percent in every 
part of America. Anything less is 
shameful. And that is why this funding 
increase and this bill are so critical. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member, Mr. GRAVES, and Chairman 
DEFAZIO for bringing a great bill out, 
and I urge its support. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman DEFAZIO and Ranking 
Member GRAVES for answering the plea 
of so many of us in relation to our dis-
tricts. I thank subcommittee chair-
woman, Mrs. NAPOLITANO, and Ranking 
Member WESTERMAN. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad for all these 
years I have been working on issues 
dealing collectively with our Houston 
port or bayous and the flooding crisis 
that we have in Houston, Texas, Harris 
County. 
I am glad that this legislation au-
thorizes the Houston Ship Channel Ex-
pansion Improvement Project, part of 
my district, the Federal contribution 
to which is approximately $463 million. 
I remember standing at the edge of our 
port looking at the mud collecting and 
impeding the going and coming of 
those vessels. 
It authorizes the construction of all 
34 pending Corps Chief’s Reports re-
ceived since the enactment of WRDA; 
Authorizes 35 feasibility studies for 
water resources development projects; 
And directs the Corps, which we have 
worked with, to expedite the comple-
tion of 41 feasibility studies currently 
underway, including the Houston Re-
gional Watershed Assessment, Flood 
Risk Management feasibility study, 
which I have introduced over and over 
again. It is now going to move. 
It fully unlocks the approximately 
$10 billion currently held in the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund. 
It helps bayous in my district, 
Greens Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunt-
ing Bayou; and, of course, it recognizes 
that Hurricane Harvey—we had 21 tril-
lion gallons of water, losing housing, 
203,000 homes were damaged and 12,700 
were destroyed. 
Finally, what is so important, the 
bill directs the secretary to issue final 
agency procedures for its Principles, 
Requirements, and Guidelines to en-
sure that future water resources devel-
opment projects will maximize sustain-
able development and affordably ad-
dress the needs of economically dis-
advantaged communities. 
The bill authorizes the Corps to 
study, design, and construct water re-
sources. 
Mr. Speaker, the most disadvantaged 
persons are the ones that suffer the 
most. I am grateful for this bill, and I 
ask support for this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong and enthusi-
astic support of H.R. 7575, the Water Re-
sources Development Act for 2020, which 
strengthens America’s competitive edge by in-
vesting in our ports, harbors and inland water-
ways, builds more resilient communities, and 
creates additional flexibility for the Corps to 
address the water resources needs of eco-
nomically disadvantaged communities, com-
munities of color, and rural communities. 
I thank Congressman DEFAZIO and Con-
gressman GRAVES of Missouri, the Chair and 
Ranking Member of the Committee on Trans-
portation and Infrastructue, and Congress-
woman 
NAPOLITANO
and 
Congressman 
WESTERMAN, the Water Development Re-
sources Subcommittee Chair and Ranking 
Member, respectively, for their work in shep-
herding this important bipartisan legislation to 
the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bipartisan legis-
lation because it: 
1. Authorizes the Houston Ship Channel Ex-
pansion Channel Improvement Project, the 
federal contribution to which is approximately 
$463 million. 
2. Authorizes the construction of all 34 
pending Corps Chief’s Reports received since 
the enactment of WRDA 2018. 
3. Authorizes 35 feasibility studies for water 
resources development projects, those identi-
fied through the public review process estab-
lished by section 7001 of the Water Re-
sources Reform and Development Act of 
2014. 
4. Directs the Corps to expedite the comple-
tion of 41 feasibility studies currently under-
way, including the Houston Regional Water-
shed Assessment Flood Risk Management 
Feasibility study, which is certainly needed 
given the frequency and severity of historic- 
level flood events in recent years in and 
around the Houston metropolitan area. 
5. Fully unlocks the approximately $10 bil-
lion currently held in the Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund (HMTF) by providing the authority 
to appropriate additional funds for harbor 
maintenance needs from the existing balance 
in the Trust Fund. 
Mr. Speaker, these water development 
projects managed by the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers in consultation with local partners 
are key to preserving our Nation’s economy, 
to protecting our communities, and to main-
taining our quality of life. 
The Army Corps of Engineers has been 
working with the Harris County Flood Control 
District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flood-
ing within Harris County. 
Current projects include 6 federal flood risk 
management projects: 
1. Sims Bayou; 
2. Greens Bayou; 
3. Brays Bayou; 
4. White Oak Bayou; 
5. Hunting Bayou; and 
6. Clear Creek. 
In addition to these ongoing projects, the 
Army Corps of Engineers operates and main-
tains the Addicks and Barker (A&B) Detention 
Dams in northwest Harris County. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legisla-
tion because it is essential in minimizing the 
risk of flood damage to Houston and Harris

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3959 
July 29, 2020 
County metropolitan area, the nation’s fourth 
largest, is a matter of national significance be-
cause the region is one of the Nation’s major 
technology, energy, finance, export and med-
ical centers: 
1. The Port of Houston is the largest bulk 
port in the world; 
2. Texas Medical Center is a world re-
nowned teaching, research and treatment cen-
ter; 
3. Houston is home to the largest conglom-
eration of foreign bank representation and 
second only to New York City as home to the 
most Fortune 500 companies; and 
4. The Houston Watershed Assessment 
study area sits within major Hurricane Evacu-
ation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf 
Coast region. 
At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third 
of Houston was underwater due to Hurricane 
Harvey flooding. 
There were over 41,500 square miles of 
land mass impacted by Hurricane Harvey and 
the subsequent flooding that covered an area 
larger than the States of Connecticut, Massa-
chusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and 
Vermont combined. 
Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons 
of rainfall on Texas and Louisiana, most of it 
on the Houston Metroplex. 
In September 2017, NASA’s Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory reported that Hurricane Harvey’s 
rainfall created 275 trillion pounds of water, 
which caused the crust in and around Houston 
to deform and sink nearly 1 inch because of 
the weight. 
Over 300,000 structures flooded in south-
eastern Texas, where extreme rainfall hit 
many areas that are densely populated. 
Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing dis-
aster to strike the U.S. in our Nation’s history. 
Hurricane Harvey damaged 203,000 homes, 
of which 12,700 were destroyed. 
Texas flood control districts are still strug-
gling to recover from this record breaking flood 
event. 
Nineteen trillion gallons of flood waters 
poured into the Houston Ship Channel from 
area rivers and bayous on the way to the Gulf 
of Mexico. 
As a consequence, tens of millions of tons 
of sediment and debris flowed through the big-
gest waterway in the nation. 
The Port of Houston produces 27 percent of 
the nation’s gasoline and about 60 percent of 
the U.S. aviation fuel. 
Investments in all aspects of our Nation’s 
water infrastructure pays dividends in the form 
of economic activity. 
The Houston Ship Channel generates $617 
billion in the U.S. with $265 billion of that in 
Texas representing 16 percent of the state of 
Texas’s GDP. 
The Port of Houston sustains 2.7 million 
jobs nationally with 1.2 million of them within 
the state of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, let me list a few of the provi-
sions in this bill that will benefit my commu-
nities I represent. 
The bill directs the Secretary to issue final 
agency procedures for its Principles, Require-
ments, and Guidelines (PR&G) to ensure that 
future water resources development projects 
will maximize sustainable development and 
affordably address the needs of economically 
disadvantaged communities. 
The bill authorizes the Corps to study, de-
sign and construct water resources projects 
for communities that have been subjected to 
repetitive flooding events and have received 
emergency flood assistance, including con-
struction of temporary barriers. 
This authority will help repetitive loss com-
munities, especially those in economically-dis-
advantaged communities, obtain critical flood 
protection. 
The legislation requires the Corps to under-
take an inventory of water resources develop-
ment projects and associated properties that 
are or may be contaminated with PFAS, and 
to develop a plan to remediate and limit poten-
tial human exposure to the contamination. 
The bill requires the Corps to complete its 
review on minority community and tribal con-
sultation, as well as update Corps’ policies on 
environmental justice considerations and com-
munity engagement and consultation. 
Finally, the legislation authorizes and cre-
ates additional flexibility for the Corps to ad-
dress the water resources needs of economi-
cally disadvantaged communities, communities 
of color, and rural communities, such as au-
thorizing the Corps of Engineers to provide 
technical assistance for resiliency planning, 
with priority given to economically disadvan-
taged communities. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 7575, the bipartisan Water Resources 
Development Act of 2020. 
b 1500 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire as to the remaining 
time? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 121⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Oregon 
has 10 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. ZELDIN). 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honor of representing the First Con-
gressional District of New York, lo-
cated on the East End of Long Island, 
a 
district 
almost 
completely 
sur-
rounded by water. We were hit really 
hard by Superstorm Sandy, and the 
widespread devastation emphasized the 
dire need to ensure our communities 
were better prepared for the future. 
Working hard with my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, Colonel Thomas 
Asbery of the Army Corps, and their 
entire hardworking team, this bill 
prioritizes local projects that are vital 
to my congressional district. 
That includes the Fire Island to 
Montauk Point project, which includes 
essential 
dredging 
and 
shoreline 
projects over 83 miles of coastline. 
Coastal storm risk management for 
Hashamomuck Cove in Southold is in-
cluded, where right now local resi-
dents, businesses, and first responders 
are paralyzed even during a severe 
thunderstorm. 
Equally as important, this legisla-
tion continues to build on these vic-
tories, 
jump-starting movement on 
projects at Reel Point Reserve and 
Shelter Island, Goldsmith’s Inlet in 
Southold, and Wading River Creek in 
Riverhead through authorizing feasi-
bility studies. 
The Water Resources Development 
Act is great news for our shorelines on 
Long Island and across the country, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ). 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I would like to thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES 
for the opportunity to briefly speak on 
the bipartisan 2020 Water Resources 
Development Act. 
I am pleased that this bill includes 
my legislation, the Tuscarawas River 
Flooding Study Act, which authorizes 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to 
conduct a comprehensive feasibility 
study on the Tuscarawas River water-
shed. 
Northeast Ohio is justifiably proud of 
our historical heritage regarding the 
Ohio and Erie Canal. From the Portage 
Lakes to Canal Fulton, this heritage is 
embedded 
throughout 
my 
district. 
However, this legacy also means that 
cities and villages often encounter re-
curring flooding events because of the 
historical building patterns from the 
19th century. 
Just last summer, southwest Summit 
County 
saw 
significant 
flooding 
throughout 
the 
Tuscarawas 
River 
basin. This study will serve as a first 
step toward beginning to find solutions 
to address these challenges. 
I would like to thank the Huntington 
District of the Army Corps for their ex-
tensive work with my office on this 
issue and Muskingum Watershed Con-
servancy District for their knowledge 
and guidance. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight an issue in my dis-
trict that I have been working tire-
lessly on, and that is to preserve the 
pool at the New Savannah Bluff Lock 
and Dam. 
I am extremely disappointed this leg-
islation was brought before the House 
with no opportunity to amend the bill 
before negotiations began with the 
Senate. 
The lock and dam, and the pool it 
creates, is critical to the Augusta com-
munity and is utilized for municipal 
and industrial water supply as well as 
recreation. 
The Corps of Engineers recently se-
lected a rock weir as an alternative to 
replace the lock and dam, a design that 
drops the pool level and was dem-
onstrated last year with disastrous re-
sults. Not only does this plan not meet 
the requirements of the WIIN Act, but 
local stakeholders have expressed seri-
ous concerns with the Corps of Engi-
neers’ proposal. This option does not 
meet the intent of Congress and main-
tain the pool.

Moving forward with the rock weir is 
unacceptable, and I thank my col-
leagues from Georgia for their bipar-
tisan effort to champion this issue in 
the recent committee markup. 
I urge the committee to work with 
me to include language in the final bill 
that will repair and maintain the lock 
and dam and the pool, while still ac-
commodating the mitigation project. 
It is essential. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N), who understands water issues. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
this bill that includes language for 
flood control in Puerto Rico. We are 
now in the hurricane season, and 
today, it is announced a tropical storm 
between today and tomorrow. 
The flood control projects included in 
the bill are Rio Guayanilla, Rio Manati 
in Ciales, and Rio Culebrinas on the 
northwestern part of the island, as well 
as important provisions to study flood 
damage, provide resiliency planning as-
sistance, and evaluate seismic risks. 
I am also most proud to have secured 
in this bill an increase to the author-
ization cost for the Cano Martin Pena 
project, $232.4 million, as established 
during the feasibility phase in 2016, fix-
ing a discrepancy in WRDA 2007. This 
increase ensures updated costs are con-
sidered as the project moves forward, 
which is especially critical for the de-
velopment of eight communities in the 
San Juan area. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, WRDA 2020 
is a good bipartisan piece of legislation 
that is going to improve flood control 
infrastructure and improve ports, har-
bors, and inland waterways across the 
country. 
This is infrastructure that is critical 
to protecting our communities and our 
farms and businesses in north Missouri 
and the rest of America. It is essential 
to the efficient movement of goods, 
products, commodities, and resources 
nationwide. 
Again, I want to thank the many co-
sponsors and the members of the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infra-
structure for their hard work on this 
very important bill. 
Also, committee staff on both sides 
put a lot of work into this piece of leg-
islation, Mr. Speaker, and I want to 
thank them all for their hard work. 
Specifically, from the Subcommittee 
on Water Resources and Environment, 
the Republican staff, I want to thank 
Ian Bennitt, Jon Pawlow, and Victor 
Sarmiento. From the Democrat staff, I 
want to thank Ryan Seiger, Navis 
Bermudez, Camille Touton, and Alexa 
Williams. From the Republican full 
committee staff, I want to thank Paul 
Sass, Jack Ruddy, Corey Cooke, Tara 
Hupman, 
Abby 
Camp, 
Nick 
Christensen, Justin Harclerode, Tyler 
Micheletti, Jamie Hopkins, and Shawn 
Bloch. In addition, I very much want to 
thank Kathy Dedrick, Mohsin Syed, 
and the rest of the Democrat full com-
mittee staff. 
WRDA is a perfect example of Repub-
licans and Democrats working together 
to address America’s infrastructure 
needs, as this committee is meant to 
do. I would urge all Members to sup-
port this legislation. 
I want to add, too, Mr. Speaker, the 
gracious work of and being able to 
work with Chairman DEFAZIO. When 
we work together, it actually works 
quite well, and I want to thank him for 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for his kind words. We find many op-
portunities to work together. There are 
times when we have significant policy 
differences, and we get through it. And 
we will keep plugging. 
This bill is great for our Nation. On a 
daily basis, of our Nation’s 58 largest 
ports, they only have about 40 percent 
of their capability due to deferred 
dredging. 
We have jetties failing around the 
Nation. We heard from CONOR LAMB 
from Pennsylvania. We did great engi-
neering work in the 1800s and early 
1900s. I viewed a lock in his district 
built in the early 1900s, but these 
things do have a lifetime. 
The increase in cost share for inland 
waterways is going to make a great dif-
ference. We are finally going to spend 
the $10 billion that the American peo-
ple have put into an account for harbor 
maintenance on harbor maintenance. 
Things take a long time in Wash-
ington, D.C. I started on that with Bud 
Shuster in 1996, but finally, we are 
going to get there. 
This money can and will be very pro-
ductively spent. It will put people to 
work, and it will make our Nation 
more competitive. 
We had, for quite some time, a dis-
pute among the various ports, large, 
small, and in between. We worked all of 
that out. It is easier to do when there 
is more money. So, this bill is going to 
be good for large, medium, and small 
ports, and emerging harbors. And just 
to be parochial, it is going to be great 
for my district. 
We have many, many dangerous bar 
entrances. Fishers, particularly com-
mercial, sometimes recreational, die 
there. The dredging needs are always 
going to be there. Also, we have failing 
jetties that need replacement, so the 
additional cost share there will help. 
Then an additional cost share by 
statute for the Great Lakes, although I 
did talk with Ms. KAPTUR, and she feels 
that we didn’t quite get it right. We 
will work on that in conference. 
I would like to thank staff: Ryan 
Seiger, who is chief counsel on the sub-
committee; Camille Touton; Alexa Wil-
liams; Navis Bermudez; Joe Sheehy, 
who works for GRACE NAPOLITANO, who 
couldn’t be here today; and legislative 
counsel Kakuti Lin. Legislative coun-
sel has been fabulous. Then, the other 
side of the aisle: Ian Bennitt, Victor 
Sarmiento, Jon Pawlow. Again, thanks 
to my friend and colleague, the rank-
ing member. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 7575, the Water Resources Develop-
ment Act for 2020. This legislation is the result 
of bipartisan work and leadership of Com-
mittee Chairman DEFAZIO and Ranking Mem-
ber GRAVES and many others. It deserves to 
be passed by the this House as a vital con-
tribution to improving and maintaining our Na-
tion’s ports system, inland waterways, dams, 
levees, aids to navigation, flood control, and 
the many critical support and operational func-
tions of our U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 
support of national, state and local water re-
sources development needs. 
Alaska’s 33,904 miles of shoreline dwarf the 
Lower 48 and with fewer miles of paved road 
than Rhode Island, Alaska’s rivers are our 
highways and our ports are the lifeblood of our 
state’s communities. The Committee continues 
to make incremental progress on embracing 
the unique challenges Alaskan communities 
face with respect to port and harbor improve-
ments, inland waterway navigation, flood and 
storm protection and other water resource in-
frastructure overseen by the Army Corps of 
Engineers. 
The Army Corps Alaska District is an inte-
gral partner to Alaska’s communities man-
aging significant project demand with limited 
resources. However, need continues to out-
pace available appropriations and Corps re-
sources to get projects completed. The re-
forms to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
included in this bill is a step in the right direc-
tion and I will continue to advocate for greater 
federal investment for our nation’s water infra-
structure. 
I am particularly pleased that WRDA 2020 
contains an authorization for improvements to 
the Port of Nome, Alaska as well as other pro-
visions for ports and harbors in Alaska. It is 
rewarding to see that a majority of my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle in this 
House and in the other body, have come to 
recognize, along with the Administration, the 
essential and indispensable strategic, national 
defense and commercial importance of the 
Arctic for our Nation’s future. 
The authorization of $490,919,000 for the 
Arctic Deep Draft Port project in Nome in-
cluded in this bill has been a long time com-
ing, and it is a positive step forward for Alaska 
and the country. The Port of Nome, due to its 
geographic location, is a strategic transpor-
tation hub that meets the needs of U.S. Arctic 
Policy by strengthening U.S. present in the re-
gion. The Port of Nome expansion is critical to 
ensure more effective search and rescue and 
environmental response activities as vessel 
traffic increases throughout the Arctic. The 
port will serve the country’s National interests 
and support Coast Guard and Navy oper-
ations. It will also expand an existing logistics

hub for more than 50 Alaskan coastal commu-
nities to help reduce the cost of living and cre-
ate economic opportunity throughout Alaska 
and the Pacific Northwest. 
I want to commend the Army Corp’s Alaska 
District, General Semonite and Assistant Sec-
retary James for all their hard work to get the 
Chiefs report done in time for this bill. As a 
former tugboat captain in Alaska, I know how 
important it is to have good ports, and I would 
like to thank the Chairman and the Ranking 
Member for including this provision in the bill. 
The bill also provides for the authorization of 
two other much needed projects to benefit 
Alaskan 
harbors. 
The 
bill 
authorizes 
a 
$34,937,000 dredging project for Unalaska 
Dutch Harbor. Dutch Harbor is one of the na-
tion’s top fishing ports measured by catch vol-
ume and value and is essential to the Alaska 
fishing economy and the nation’s food supply. 
The project will dredge the entrance channel 
of the harbor to 58 feet improving the ability of 
commercial, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, 
U.S. military assets and ships from allied na-
tions to utilize the harbor. 
The bill also includes language to include 
the authorization for St. George’s navigation 
improvements project pending the timely re-
lease of a positive Chiefs Report from the 
Army Corps. The project will provide for the 
operability, safety and reliability of the St. 
George Harbor as promised by the federal 
government to aid the transition of the econ-
omy of the Pribilof Islands away from fur seals 
to commercial fishing. 
Importantly, the bill makes an improvement 
to the Tribal Partnership Program by increas-
ing the per project federal cost share cap to 
$15 million dollars from $12.5 million. This im-
provement is a step in the right direction and 
the increase begins to take into account the 
challenges Alaska faces with higher project 
costs. In forthcoming WRDA bills, I will con-
tinue to work with my colleagues and the 
Committee to ensure that Corps policies re-
garding benefit-cost ratios, existing authorities 
and cost share requirements treat Alaska fairly 
and take into account all the unique environ-
mental challenges present in Alaska. 
As this bill moves into the Conference proc-
ess, I will continue working with my colleagues 
to include language, present in the Senate’s 
draft bill, that will protect nonfederal project 
sponsors from shouldering cost liabilities in-
curred by the Army Corps through no fault of 
their own. This language is needed for Project 
Cooperation Agreement in instances where 
the Army Corps has been assessed a large 
adverse judgment by the Armed Services 
Board of Contract Appeals or another court of 
competent jurisdiction. 
In December 2018, the Aleutians East Bor-
ough was notified by the Army Corps that the 
Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals 
had awarded Kelly-Ryan, Inc. a $20,000,000 
judgement for a procurement dispute arising in 
2006–09 over the construction of a breakwater 
and other general navigation features in False 
Pass, Alaska. The standard Project Coopera-
tion Agreement between a non-federal project 
sponsor and the Corps for any Civil Works 
project sets out the specific cost-sharing re-
quirements applicable to the project. The 
Agreement includes a definition of ‘‘total costs 
of construction of the general navigation fea-
tures’’. This definition includes ‘‘the Govern-
ment’s costs of contract dispute settlements or 
awards’’. The costs of disputes, claims, and 
equitable adjustments are added to the final 
cost of a project and allocated between the 
non-federal and USACE based on the cost- 
share formula. 
The Army Corps has verbally informed the 
Borough that 20 percent of this judgement ($4 
million) may be allocated to the Borough’s fi-
nancial share of the project in the future. Nota-
bly, the dispute had nothing to do with the 
project’s design, engineering, or construction. 
The dispute was instead focused on the man-
ner in which the USACE’s contracting officer 
sought to comply with a congressional direc-
tive changing the manner in which the Corps 
funded continuing contracts. Non-federal spon-
sors, especially smaller rural communities, 
should not be required to carry a significant 
share of the financial burden when there is a 
violation of procurement law peripheral to the 
actual design, engineering, and construction of 
the project itself. 
As many know one of my mottos is ‘‘Alaska 
to the future.’’ Looking ahead, as the only 
‘‘Arctic State’’ in the Union, Alaska will play 
the central role in hosting future arctic infra-
structure including as ‘‘System of Ports’’ and 
safe harbors as national security, government 
and commercial activities inevitably increase in 
and around the Arctic in the coming years. 
The Army Corp’s Alaska Deep-Draft Arctic 
Port System Study and recent Defense De-
partment and U.S. Coast Guard strategic stud-
ies have shown that, U.S. strategic interests 
will benefit from increased arctic infrastructure 
including port infrastructure to cover Alaska’s 
vast arctic land mass. 
What is needed, and what has been called 
for, is a ‘‘System of U.S. Arctic Ports’’ whereby 
the improvements at Nome should be the first 
in a series of needed improvements at other 
key Alaska locations that will provide the 
United States with the breadth of assets in-
cluding a specialized Ports System for cov-
erage and access to the Arctic. 
One location that should warrant due con-
sideration for future improvements in an Arctic 
Ports System is Port Clarence/Point Spencer 
located immediately adjacent to the Bering 
Strait. Today’s U.S. year-round ice free ‘‘Arc-
tic’’ ports are in Dutch Harbor, Adak, and St. 
Paul, Alaska which play important roles be-
cause of their locations. As ice navigability im-
proves the natural and protected deep-water 
port of Port Clarence can serve as a year- 
round potential forward service center and port 
of refuge close to, and directly adjacent to the 
key ‘‘choke point’’ of the Bering Strait. 
The following is a brief overview of key in-
formation about this strategically located nat-
ural deep-water port in the Arctic: 
Port Clarence is north-northwest of Nome 
(70 miles), on the Seward Peninsula, and is a 
protected natural deep-water harbor. It is shel-
tered by a long isthmus called Point Spencer. 
Most recently, the U.S. Coast Guard based a 
LORAN facility at Point Spencer with associ-
ated power and an 8,000-foot airstrip (4,500 
feet of paved runway and 3,500 feet of ex-
tended gravel-covered runway). 
Port Clarence’s protected harbor served In-
digenous people of the region before contact 
with European cultures. 
Port Clarence served as a port of refuge for 
whaling vessels in the mid-1850s while Alaska 
was under Russian sovereignty. It still serves 
as the Port of Refuge from storms for vessels, 
including U.S. Coast Guard vessels and other 
government and commercial vessels travelling 
through the Bering Strait or docked tempo-
rarily in Nome. 
From 1866 to 1867, Port Clarence served 
as the forward operating base for the Western 
Union Telegraph Expedition in the attempt to 
link the continents with an undersea telegraph 
cable. 
Around 1884 it became the central summer 
refitting port for the Arctic fleet, which usually 
arrived in July and headed south around Sep-
tember (unless they elected to overwinter 
there). 
The Port of Nome project and potential de-
velopment Port Clarence/Point Spencer is po-
sitioned to become a key part of America’s 
deep-water Arctic Ports System, ready to re-
ceive and assist vessels moving to and from 
Arctic destinations, trans-Arctic shipping, or 
Navy and Coast Guard vessels and aircraft 
undertaking a wide variety of missions from 
those dealing with national security to eco-
nomic development, search and rescue, ship-
ping safety, oil spill prevention, response and 
clean up, arctic research, maritime law en-
forcement on the Bering Sea, the Chukchi 
Sea, and the Arctic Ocean. 
The Congress authorized the transfer of cer-
tain tracts of land at Point Spencer to Bering 
Straits Native Corporation (BSNC) while pro-
viding the opportunity for retention of certain 
tracts by the USCG and the State of Alaska 
should the USCG and the State wish to retain 
those tracts. Port development at Point Spen-
cer-Port Clarence should proceed as a coop-
erative effort among the State, the Federal 
government, and BSNC in coordination with 
the enhancements of the Port of Nome. 
Port Clarence has, historically been and will 
continue to be a valuable ‘‘Port of Refuge’’ be-
cause of its naturally deep waters and natu-
rally protected harbor—as shipping vessel traf-
fic continues to increase in the Arctic. 
BSNC is working now with U.S. Corps of 
Engineers to place 30-ton and 60-ton indus-
trial grade mooring system buoys at Port Clar-
ence to serve maritime safety needs for the 
entire Bering Strait Region. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues Chair-
man DEFAZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES 
for their leadership in this unusually chal-
lenging time in the Congress and for our na-
tion by bringing this bipartisan Water Re-
sources Development Act legislation to the 
House Floor. I look forward to the positive im-
pact that WRDA 2020 will have on our na-
tion’s water resources development for dec-
ades to come. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
express my support of the Water Resources 
Development Act. This strong, bipartisan bill 
will help assure that our nation’s ports, har-
bors, and waterways are developed and main-
tained to enhance economic and environ-
mental vitality. 
I am particularly pleased with the commit-
ment to beneficial reuse of dredged material 
from Corps water resources projects. Dredged 
material is a valuable resource that can help 
restore impacted shorelines and ecosystems 
and that can create resilient coastlines and es-
tuaries. Environmental groups in California 
have emphasized the importance of beneficial 
reuse, specifically because the dredged mate-
rial can play a vital role in restoring and pre-
serving shallow water habitats such as tidal 
marshes and mudflats. The beneficial use pilot 
program, first authorized in WRDA 2016, was 
so successful that H.R. 7575 increases the

number of eligible projects. Notably, our own 
San Francisco Bay estuary faces a number of 
issues associated with resiliency and sustain-
ability, and the reuse of dredged material can 
be enormously helpful in addressing these crit-
ical issues around the Bay. In its report for 
WRDA 2020, the Committee highlighted Rich-
mond Outer Harbor, Pinole Shoal, and the 
San Francisco Bay as priorities for consider-
ation in the next round of pilot projects. 
This year’s bill also highlights the role and 
value of alternative dredging methods and 
equipment to beneficial reuse of dredged ma-
terial. Specifically, I am encouraged that the 
Committee clarifies that the use of alternative 
dredging methods and equipment must be 
part of the overall beneficial use program. This 
is important as, too often, we find that the old 
ways utilized by the Corps for maintaining 
navigation channels will not meet modem day 
demands to protect our natural resources and 
build a resilient future through reliable stra-
tegic management plans that allow annual 
dredging. 
This bill will go a long way toward improving 
our environment, providing much-needed di-
rection to the Army Corps, and supporting 
California’s 11th District. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 7575, the Water Re-
sources Development Act of 2020. I would like 
to thank Chairman DEFazio and my fellow col-
leagues on the House Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee for their diligent work 
to produce this much needed water resources 
bill. Everyone is the U.S. is impacted by the 
need for clean water and I believe this bill 
takes a giant step forward to ensuring this be-
comes a reality for every American. 
Within my district, The City of Dallas is ap-
preciative to the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers (Corps) for their funding of the Dallas 
Floodway, Dallas Floodway Extension flood 
risk management projects and Lewisville Dam 
repairs and their continued efforts to complete 
these projects quickly. I look forward to con-
tinuing to hear good reports on the progress of 
these projects. I am pleased that the Corps is 
moving forward with these projects. 
Please allow me to note that it is helpful for 
the Corps to accept input from non-federal 
sponsors in the development of WRDA guid-
ance. The Corps, working with local non-fed-
eral sponsors instead of developing guidance 
independently, will result in more resilient 
projects with multiple benefits. The role of re-
siliency in the construction, operation and 
maintenance of projects carried out by the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) must 
continue to be a priority. 
The Dallas area falls within the South-
western Division of the Army Corps of Engi-
neers. Flooding and flood control continue to 
be issues that are ever-present on the minds 
of residents along the Trinity River. I have 
held several meetings on flooding in the Dal-
las area to address this issue and hope to 
continue to work with the Corps to combat 
flooding in Dallas. 
Other parts of North Texas have also bene-
fited from projects included in previous 
versions of WRDA legislation. The projects ad-
dressing pump stations and levy heights in 
Dallas, along with bridge projects in Ft. Worth 
would not be where they are today without the 
Corps and this legislation. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
Dallas-Fort 
Worth 
metroplex is growing at a quite rapid pace and 
this updated legislation will help to provide 
adequate water and wastewater infrastructure 
to meet the demands, given the rapid pace of 
growth and development in our area. Further-
more, the bill will help in addressing mainte-
nance needs, replacing aging infrastructure, 
and help in accounting for human behavior in 
all aspects of our water system—from sewer 
overflows, to promoting water conservation 
through drought tolerant outdoor landscaping. 
Lastly, I want to thank the committee for 
working with me to include language in the bill 
regarding the embankment of Lake Waco, on 
which Lake Shore Drive is located, so that we 
may keep the public safe from danger. I un-
derstand that there is also language in the 
Senate bill on the Lakeshore Drive issue that 
may be more direct. As we move through 
completion of this bill in conference, I hope to 
continue to work with the committee to ensure 
that Lakeshore Drive is not a safety hazard. 
Mr. Speaker, the projects I just mentioned 
are a tiny piece of the multitude of projects the 
Army Corps of Engineers works on to help ad-
dress the water needs of the United States 
and its residents. Every American is impacted 
by this legislation and I urge my colleagues to 
support it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3965 
July 29, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will take 
this occasion to make an announce-
ment concerning the wearing of masks 
in the Hall of the House during the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Under clause 2 of rule I, the Chair is 
required to preserve order and decorum 
in the Chamber. This includes the re-
sponsibility to ensure the protection of 
Member and staff safety and health 
during proceedings. This responsibility 
is of paramount importance, particu-
larly in the midst of a pandemic. 
To that end, the Chair announces 
that, during the pendency of a covered 
period pursuant to House Resolution 
965, Members and staff will be required 
to wear masks at all times in the Hall 
of the House, except that Members may 
remove their masks temporarily when 
recognized. The Chair expects all Mem-
bers and staff to adhere to this require-
ment as a sign of respect for the 
health, safety, and well-being of others 
present in the Chamber and sur-
rounding areas. 
The 
Chair 
would 
further 
inform 
Members and staff that they will not 
be permitted to enter the Hall of the 
House without wearing a mask. Masks 
will be available at the entry points for 
any Member who forgets to bring one. 
The Chair would also like to remind 
Members that the Speaker has the au-
thority to direct the Sergeant-at-Arms 
to remove a Member from the floor as 
a matter of decorum. To reiterate, the 
Chair views the failure to wear a mask 
as a serious breach of decorum. 
As always, the Chair appreciates the 
cooperation of Members and staff in 
preserving order and decorum in the 
Chamber and in displaying respect and 
safety for one another by wearing a 
mask. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 
12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the 
House in recess for a period of less than 
15 minutes. 
Accordingly (at 6 o’clock and 5 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
f 
b 1813 
AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Ms. HAALAND) at 6 o’clock 
and 13 minutes p.m.

Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged 
from further consideration of H. Res. 
1046, and ask for its immediate consid-
eration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-

women, Asian American women, Hispanic 
American women, and other women of color 
in America continued to face legal and social 
barriers to voting throughout the twentieth 
century; 
Whereas the suffragists persevered in their 
quest for women’s equality through genera-
tions of hardships, including the Civil War, 
Reconstruction, World War I, and the Span-
ish Flu pandemic; and 
Whereas the Women’s Suffrage Centennial 
Commission was created to encourage, plan, 
develop, and execute programs, projects, and 
activities to commemorate the centennial of 
the passage and ratification of the 19th 
Amendment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-

ists who fought for generations to secure 
women’s access to the ballot;

right to full participation in American de-
mocracy; 
(5) recommits to uplifting an inclusive, di-
verse, and complete history of women’s fight 
for the vote; 
(6) recommits to persevering through these 
unexpected times to celebrate the suffra-
gists, educate new generations about this 
critical chapter in the history of American 
democracy, and create a legacy that will in-
spire for the next 100 years; 
(7) recommends that Members of Congress 
demonstrate their support for the suffrage 
centennial through local and national com-
memorative efforts, such as the Women’s 
Suffrage Centennial Commission’s Forward 
Into Light Campaign; and 
(8) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe National Women’s Suffrage 
Month and commemorate this milestone of 
American democracy by ensuring that the 
untold stories of women’s decades-long bat-
tle for the ballot are recognized and cele-
brated across the United States. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 3010 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that my name 
be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 3010. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
WILD). Is there objection to the request 
of the gentleman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
f 
PROVIDE CITIES FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT 
(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of our local cities 
in the 39th Congressional District and 
across America. Our cities continue to 
combat the coronavirus and provide 
central services, but they are losing 
revenue fast. 
Citizens in my district sent a letter 
urging support, and since the beginning 
of this pandemic, I have been advo-
cating on their behalf. Without Con-
gress stepping up, public safety will be 
on the chopping block. 
While my Republican colleagues and 
the White House want to speak out 
against defunding the police, their lack 
of support for our towns and cities 
means they are not only defunding the 
police but also the fire department and 
other public safety services. 
This last-minute Senate Republican 
COVID relief bill does just that and 
puts the safety of the American people 
at risk. It also ties school funding to 
reopening and puts big corporations 
over frontline workers. 
I renew my call to all of my col-
leagues and to the White House to not 
put our cities in a situation where they 
have to lay off first responders and cut 
community programs. 
Let’s provide our cities with the fi-
nancial support they need.

b 1945 
CHINESE ESPIONAGE IN ACADEMIA 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, whether we like it or 
not, every day the Communist Govern-
ment of China seeks the downfall of 
our great Nation. Since 2000, there 
have been well over 100 documented 
cases of Chinese espionage in the 
United States. 
Many of these have come from the in-
filtration of American academic insti-
tutions. This past year, even the chair-
man of the Department of Chemistry 
at Harvard University was charged 
with academic espionage. 
This is a national crisis and why I in-
troduced the INFLUENCE Act today. 
Existing law requires institutions of 
higher learning to report any gift or 
contract from a foreign source valued 
at $250,000 or more. That is simply too 
high a threshold. My bill lowers this 
threshold to $50,000 so we can have a 
better idea of who is influencing Amer-
ican higher education. 
We cannot be naive to the fact that 
China desires this Nation’s downfall, 
and their infiltration of American 
higher education is a clear and present 
danger to this great Nation’s security. 
I hope my colleagues will bolster our 
national security by supporting the IN-
FLUENCE Act. 
f 
CHILDCARE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise for the thousands and millions of 
childcare workers—essential workers— 
and their families and the children in 
support of legislation that provides $50 
billion to reaffirm childcare essential 
workers and, as well, to provide relief 
to desperate parents. 
COVID–19 has taken an enormous toll 
on our community. It has taken a toll 
because people have not worn masks, 
there have not been stay-at-home or-
ders, and Houston and Harris County 
are suffering. This legislation will be a 
lifeline. 
In addition, I fight for and advocate 
for the moneys for our States and local 
communities. We cannot suffer a Re-
publican bill. We must have $600 for our 
unemployment extension or addition, 
and, as well, it is imperative that we 
have testing money. The way you stop 
COVID–19 is testing, testing, testing, 
social distancing, wearing a mask, and 
giving authority to local jurisdictions 
to be able to issue stay-at-home orders. 
This is a pandemic and a crisis. When 
is the Nation going to stand up to an 
administration that refuses to under-
stand that? 
We in the Congress, this majority in 
the United States House of Representa-
tives, will fight against eliminating 
$600, not getting the money for our 
States and local governments, and not 
getting testing money. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CHRIS MARTIN IV 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, as he pre-
pares to retire as CEO after four dec-
ades, I rise to recognize a constituent 
of mine, Chris Martin, for his leader-
ship of Martin Guitars, an exceptional 
business in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, 
that has been a source of pride in my 
community for generations. 
For almost 200 years, C.F. Martin & 
Company has produced acoustic guitars 
widely recognized as the finest in the 
world. The product of an unparalleled 
legacy of craftsmanship, Martin Gui-
tars have been proudly used by leg-
endary musicians across our country 
and the world: Bob Dylan and Eric 
Clapton, Paul McCartney and Joan 
Baez, Willie Nelson and Kurt Cobain, to 
name only a few. 
I want to express my gratitude to 
Chris and the Martin Guitars team for 
their continued dedication to contrib-
uting to a made-in-the-USA economy 
based on excellence; for their commit-
ment to maintaining and expanding 
music education in our classrooms; and 
for their determination to advance so-
cial, economic, environmental, and ra-
cial justice. 
I congratulate Chris on all he has 
achieved. As he looks forward to a new 
chapter, I wish him the very best.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3968 
July 29, 2020 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Leb-
anon declared in Executive Order 13441 
of August 1, 2007, is to continue in ef-
fect beyond August 1, 2020. 
Certain ongoing activities, such as 
Iran’s continuing arms transfers to 
Hizballah—which include increasingly 
sophisticated weapons systems—serve 
to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, 
contribute to political and economic 
instability in the region, and continue 
to constitute an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
For this reason, I have determined that 
it is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13441 with respect to Lebanon.

REFLECTIONS 
OF 
MEMBERS 
OF 
THE 
WAYS 
AND 
MEANS 
COM-
MITTEE WITH RESPECT TO CON-
GRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
WILD). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I have 
asked the members of the Ways and 
Means family to assemble on the floor 
tonight so that we might offer appro-
priate praise to the life of one of the 
iconic figures of not just the civil 
rights movement, but of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
I sat next to John Lewis for 25 years 
on the Ways and Means Committee, 
and I must tell you, Madam Speaker, 
he was the bravest and most gentle 
person I ever met. 
He nearly lost his life in pursuit of 
justice and confronted some of the 
darkest facets of our society at the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge as a very young 
man, but he never lost faith in what 
America could become. 
During those many conversations— 
and he offered a tutorial to me about 
the life and the legend that he had of-
fered to America—his unyielding opti-
mism and hope lifted the spirits of his 
fellow Members of Congress and the 
American people in our Nation’s most 
trying moments. 
With quiet strength, grace, and love, 
he shouldered unthinkable burdens and 
changed this world for the better. 
Through it all, he was unfailingly hum-
ble, selfless, and kind. 
I must say—and I was commenting a 
moment ago to some colleagues on the 
committee—if he was in the room, 
Madam Speaker, you would have to get 
him to come to the microphone. That 
was that reluctance that he had. And 
we all had known about the great 
achievements that he had offered to 
this Nation, but it was never, ‘‘Let me 
get to the microphone.’’ It was always 
a much more humble arrangement. 
He came to my constituency in 2015. 
He was invited by the Sisters of St. Jo-
seph, who staffed a small Catholic col-
lege in Chicopee, Massachusetts. They 
invited him to commemorate the fact 
that on Bloody Sunday on the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge they were the only ones, 
with members of the Edmundite priest-
hood, who would care for them when 
others closed their doors. 
When John greeted Sister Maxyne 
Schneider upon introduction for the 
commencement address, the two of 
them broke out in tears, and 5,000 peo-
ple in the Springfield Civic Center 
broke out in tears with them. He re-
membered that moment, and they re-
membered him—another great story in 
the legacy of John Lewis. 
It is rare that a person has an oppor-
tunity in this institution to work 
alongside a real hero. We had that 
here, and we sometimes forget that in 
the din of incendiary debate. But for 
three decades, I, along with other 
members of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, had that honor. To be in his 
presence, his wisdom, and his joyful 
spirit day in and day out was a blessing 
beyond words. 
John served in this Congress until his 
last day, in part because his work was 
not done. Despite all the advancements 
he achieved, glaring inequities remain 
in our Nation that demand reform. But 
lucky for us, John Lewis inspired gen-
erations of young people to follow in 
his steps, to stand up to injustice, and 
to fight for what is right. 
Now he can clearly rest, and our 
prayers are with him as we carry on his 
vital and unfinished business. It is up 
to all of us to pick up where John left 
off and to be part of his legacy in ac-
tion. 
For those of us who will join his fu-
neral service tomorrow in Atlanta, 
what a great journey this has been to 
have served with him in this Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY). 
Mr. 
BRADY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman for bringing the 
Ways and Means family, as he termed 
it, together for this important evening. 
These past few days, our country has 
taken time to reflect on the life and 
the legacy of John Robert Lewis, from 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge to Auburn 
Avenue. Through streets of the South 
to the rotunda of the United States 
Capitol, our Nation has come together 
to celebrate the life of a man who rose 
to the occasion to fight for the rights 
of all human beings. 
A Congressman for the great State of 
Georgia and an esteemed member of 
the Ways and Means Committee, John 
Lewis was a blessing to our institution. 
It was an honor of a lifetime to sit next 
to such giants as he, Congressman Sam 
Johnson, and others who made their 
way through the Ways and Means Com-
mittee in the Longworth House Office 
Building. 
I was lucky to not just sit near John 
in the committee room, but I realized 
early this session, as I went to look at 
my old office in the Cannon House Of-
fice Building, that John Lewis was 
serving there, too. That day I had a big 
smile on my face as I greeted John, and 
we reminisced a bit about sharing our 
offices. 
Madam Speaker, you couldn’t help 
but smile if you ever crossed paths 
with him. He was one of the better an-
gels of our nature. He was one of our 
thousand points of light. 
The man who walked in the wind to 
bring equality to America now is walk-
ing in the heavens with his creator. We 
are a better nation and a better people 
because of him, and this institution 
and all of our country will miss him 
dearly. 
To know John, as every member of 
this committee will tell you, is a bless-
ing. His life, his career, and his legisla-
tive achievements will be studied by 
future students for generations. 
It was an honor to have worked on 
such important issues with him, in-
cluding the first reforms of the IRS in 
over two decades and in making im-
provements to Medicare for our Na-
tion’s seniors. 
It is common knowledge in D.C., and 
certainly in the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, that our room happens to be 
one of the coldest rooms in the Capitol. 
But that was not the case when John 
walked in. His presence alone brought 
that room warmth, calmness, and reas-
surance that, if we work together, we 
all can make a difference. 
When I look down the dais in the 
weeks ahead, I will be sad to miss our 
friend, but I will always be proud to 
have had the privilege of working with 
such a remarkable man. Each day he 
walked in these Halls, we all witnessed, 
firsthand, his remarkable integrity, his 
intelligence toward the complex policy 
issues we debate, and his willingness to 
work across the aisle if it means Amer-
icans will have greater dignity, oppor-
tunity, and equal rights. 
I will tell you, Madam Speaker, if 
you were poor, if you were born on the 
wrong side of the tracks, or if you felt 
powerless, John Lewis was your man. 
John Lewis would fight for you. 
God loved this remarkable servant, 
and I know John is walking hand in

hand with God and his beloved Lillian 
today. 
Tomorrow, I will be honored to join 
Chairman NEAL to attend his funeral in 
Atlanta with many of our House col-
leagues. 
John, it will be a celebration of your 
life, a chance for us to honor you and 
reflect on all the joy, passion, and love 
you brought to this Congress, to our 
lives, and to this country. 
May you rest in peace, my friend, and 
may God continue to shower you with 
faith, hope, and love each day. 
I thank Chairman NEAL for having 
me as part of this dedication today. 
b 2000 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. THOMP-
SON), another esteemed member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, in my time in Con-
gress rarely have I participated in Spe-
cial Orders, but tonight, this is more 
than a Special Order. 
John Lewis was one of the greatest 
men to have ever served in the Con-
gress of the United States of America. 
He devoted his entire life to helping 
others and to making our country a 
better place. It was an incredible honor 
to serve with him in Congress and on 
the Committee on Ways and Means. 
My wife, Jan, and I walked with him 
over the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the 
50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. 
That was 50 years after John was al-
most killed on that bridge after peace-
fully protesting discrimination that 
disenfranchised Americans in our coun-
try. 
He visited my district, and hundreds 
of my constituents came out to see 
him. One man came in a wheelchair, 
pushed by his daughter. And his daugh-
ter said: My father was a Freedom 
Rider and marched with John Lewis. 
And he checked himself out of the hos-
pital tonight so he could be here to see 
John Lewis. After they said their hel-
los, he got back in the wheelchair and 
said: Take me back to the hospital. 
I am thanked to this day for bringing 
John to our community. 
When you would pass John in the 
halls of Congress, and he would greet 
you with, ‘‘Hello, my brother,’’ he 
made you believe that you were actu-
ally his brother. We must all commit 
to working harder to be a little more 
like John Lewis. 
Good-bye, John, and thank you. God-
speed, my brother. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Connecticut 
(Mr. LARSON). 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman NEAL. What 
an honor to be here with the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means’ family. 
They said pictures are worth a thou-
sand words, and I am going to try to go 
through these as rapidly as I can. 
The first picture is my son and 
daughter, who came—as Mike was just 
explaining as part of his family—to the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge, but they had to 
be back in school the next day and so 
they couldn’t actually march across 
the bridge that Sunday. 
John said: Wait a minute. That won’t 
do. He put them in a car and drove 
them out there, and for 20 minutes 
talked to them about that experience 
and what it was. And it was very tense, 
very graphic, the violence that he en-
dured and what they went through. 
And I could see both my daughter and 
my son looking at him, and they were 
taking it all in. 
And my daughter, very innocently— 
she was 13 at the time—said: Mr. 
Lewis, did you ever have any fun? 
And John Lewis put his head back 
and had the broadest grin. He said: 
Well, sure, darling, we did. You know, 
at night we used to go back and we 
would pitch our tents, and we would 
make campfires, and we sat around and 
told stories. And we sang and we 
danced. He said: I can still see Andy 
Young in his coveralls doing the jitter-
bug, and he could dance. Andy Young 
in his coveralls doing the jitterbug. 
Madam Speaker, I will include in the 
RECORD our other items, but this iconic 
photo says it all about John Lewis. 
Madam Speaker, on the day that we 
passed the Affordable Care Act, the day 
before, he had been spat on. So was 
Reverend Cleaver, and so were others 
who were walking over here to vote on 
that bill that day. But John Lewis said: 
No—we had a caucus that morning 
with President Obama—he said: Say 
nothing of this. Remember that during 
the movement, we cast this aside. This 
is a distraction. Don’t be taken in by 
this crowd. 
We learned about it the next day. 
And at that caucus I asked him to get 
up and address the caucus. And he said: 
Let’s stay calm. Let’s stay together, 
and let’s make sure that we keep our 
eye on the prize. 
He went to walk away from the 
microphone, and then he stepped back, 
and he said: 45 years to the day, we 
marched from Selma to Montgomery, 
he said, and let me tell you, we faced 
far worse crowds than are out here 
today. So let’s lock arms. Let’s go 
across that street and pass that bill. 
And we did. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Oregon 
(Mr. 
BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for convening 
our Committee on Ways and Means’ 
family. 
It was a bittersweet moment this 
morning as we gathered outside the 
Capitol saying good-bye to John. His 
visits to Portland touched thousands of 
people, and I heard so much about 
them. He was not just a civil rights 
icon and a tremendous human being 
and an inspiration, he was a moral 
compass of our Committee on Ways 
and Means. He was the living, breath-
ing manifestation of policy that im-
pacts every family in America, not just 
merely numbers and dry policy, but 
things that matter. 
Too seldom does the consideration of 
everyday citizens—especially the poor, 
the weak, and the disadvantaged—get 
the same attention as the rich and 
powerful 
and 
well-connected. 
Well, 
that is not the fault of John Lewis. 
And I would hope that all of us here 
who are celebrating his life, would be 
inspired by his deeds, by his life’s 
work. 
As John would say, ‘‘not just our 
words, but our deeds.’’ And I hope our 
moral compass of the Committee on 
Ways and Means will guide us as we 
move forward to give the American 
people the policies that John would 
have expected. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
KELLY), our friend, who asked me on 
the floor last week, will the committee 
be paying a tribute to John Lewis. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, we all have these memories of 
Mr. Lewis, and some of you knew him 
far longer and far better than I did, but 
I can just tell you this: The time that 
I spent with Mr. Lewis that I remember 
the most was not so much in a com-
mittee hearing or not so much on the 
floor, but in March of 2015 when I took 
my 8-year-old grandson to Selma for 
the 50th anniversary of crossing the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
We started off in Birmingham and 
went to the Baptist church. And 
George, my grandson, could not under-
stand, when we were looking at this, he 
was looking at some men in hoods. He 
said: Grandpa, who are those guys? 
I said: Those are the Ku Klux Klan. 
He said: Who are they? 
I said: George, these are people that 
you don’t want to be associated with. 
They are haters. 
He said: Well, what did they do? 
I said: Well, this is the church they 
bombed, and they killed little girls 
that were practicing for a choir. 
And he goes: Why would anybody 
want to kill little girls? 
I said: Because they were filled with 
hate. They weren’t filled with love. 
Now, at that same trip, Mr. Lewis 
was with us. Mr. Lewis was there. And 
I said: Mr. Lewis, I just want you to 
meet my grandson, George. 
And he stopped and he talked to 
George. 
And George said to him: Mr. Lewis, 
why do they have on hoods? If they are 
so tough and they are so brave and 
they are so courageous, why did they 
have to wear a hood? 
He said: George, at 8-years-old, you 
get it far better than some adults do. 
Now, we go to the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge, and Mr. Lewis stops to take 
time to talk to a little boy. Not for a 
minute, not if you stand off to the side, 
son, I will get with you later on. 
No, he stops, he walks away from 
other people who were surrounding him 
and talking to him, and he stoops down

and he talks to an 8-year-old boy to 
tell him how proud he is that that 
child is going to walk across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge with him. 
And as I watched that, I thought, 
what better example could any person 
give to a child than to spend that time 
with them. And I thought at that 
point, Mr. Lewis and I are both grand-
fathers. What an example for grand-
fathers, not just an example for fellow 
Americans, but what an example of 
who this man really was. 
And if you look on his tombstone, it 
is going to say born February 21, 1940; 
died July 17, 2020—80 years. The time 
between his birth and the time between 
his death are some of the most signifi-
cant years in our country’s history of 
someone who stopped to recognize 
what was going on and said: Not on my 
time. I will do everything I can to 
change this. I will go through any sac-
rifice. I will endure any type of pain, 
any type of ridicule, any type of beat-
ings to prove a point to say, It is time. 
The one thing I always thought—I 
never, ever called him ‘‘John’’ by the 
way, because I just thought that would 
be disrespectful. Some of you know 
him much better than I did, so it was 
always ‘‘Mr. Lewis.’’ 
Mr. Lewis, every time I would see 
him, I would say: Good morning, Mr. 
Lewis. He would say: Good morning, 
my brother. We would have a sub-
committee meeting, and I would say: 
Mr. Lewis, it was really good being 
with you. He would say: It was good 
being with you, my brother. 
And I say tonight, as we are here, we 
are not saying ‘‘good-bye, my brother.’’ 
We are saying, ‘‘until we meet again, 
my 
brother.’’ 
What 
a 
phenomenal 
human being and somebody who is 
going to be missed forever—80 years of 
being the finest example of humankind 
you could possibly be. 
Mr. Chairman, thank you for allow-
ing us to speak tonight. This is truly a 
family of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. We really do appreciate each 
other. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman. 
Madam Speaker, for the past 3 years, 
it has been my good fortune to sit next 
to Mr. Lewis on the dais of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means. 
His warmth, his humility, his lack of 
bitterness after all that he endured was 
truly extraordinary. His decades of 
service touched so many lives. With his 
multi-volume graphic novel, ‘‘March,’’ 
he found a way to reach a younger au-
dience with his enduring message of 
struggle, hope, and love. 
Reading it to my own grandchildren, 
they were hooked early when John 
talked about the fact that, as a young 
boy, he preached to his chickens—and 
that is how he became the great orator 
that we know him as being. He noted 
that: They would never quite say 
amen. 
The dedication in March reads, ‘‘To 
the past and future children of the 
movement.’’ Not just this work, but his 
entire life’s work was dedicated to the 
past and future children of the move-
ment. For all that you have done, for 
all our children, John, we say ‘‘amen.’’ 
John knew that America could not 
call itself a democracy until everyone 
could cast a ballot, and that the strug-
gle for voting rights was a struggle for 
democracy itself. He dedicated himself 
to completing the promise of the Dec-
laration of Independence as he ex-
horted the crowd down the Mall here at 
the Lincoln Memorial at the March on 
Washington to ‘‘Get in and stay in the 
streets of every city, every village and 
hamlet of this Nation until true free-
dom comes, until the revolution of 1776 
is complete.’’ 
And, again, in 2015, as he annually 
commemorated that March across the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge, John asked 
‘‘Get out there and push and pull until 
we redeem the soul of America.’’ 
John Lewis worked so tirelessly to 
get in ‘‘good trouble.’’ When the LBJ 
Foundation from Austin awarded him 
with the Liberty & Justice For All 
Award, I learned that he had experi-
enced over 40 arrests, physical attacks, 
and serious injuries. But then I had 
seen, sitting next to him, some of the 
marks on his balding head of those 
very attacks. 
Through it all, he maintained that 
‘‘good trouble’’ was what America real-
ly needed. There will never be a time 
when America can afford to forget the 
legacy of John Lewis. He fought so 
long, so selflessly to advance our de-
mocracy, and he called the right to 
vote ‘‘sacred.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we honor his tire-
less labor by picking up the baton and 
voting. We honor his legacy when we 
vote and enable more of our friends and 
neighbors to do the same. John Lewis 
now rests, but we cannot. Inspired by 
his sacrifice, we must continue his 
struggle. 
No one can ever replace him, but no 
one person must. There are so many 
who share John Lewis’ dream. And we 
will grow our numbers, and when we 
do, we will overcome. 
b 2015 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), a very close 
friend of John Lewis. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, you know, if there are 
angels on Earth, John would be one. He 
was the most angelic person I have 
ever known, generous to a fault, easy 
to get along with. 
John was known for marching, but I 
am reminded that the Bible says that 
the steps of a good man are ordered by 
the Lord. John was and is a good man, 
always looking out for the underdog, 
always looking out for the disadvan-
taged, the poor, the needy, the hope-
less, the helpless. 
John has been an inspiration for me 
for more than 50 years, when he was a 
mere teenager. If I had a message, I 
would say that the songwriter probably 
had John in mind when he said: 
If you give the best of your service, 
Telling the world that the Savior is come; 
Be not dismayed when men don’t believe 
you. 
Pick up the cross and run swiftly to him. 
He’ll understand. 
And we all say: John, well done. Well 
done. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. SA´ NCHEZ). 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today with a heavy heart. Few 
men ever achieve what John Lewis has 
in his life, and few men do so while 
genuinely caring about every single 
person they meet. 
When I joined the Ways and Means 
Committee as a new member, John 
made a point to make me feel welcome. 
Despite all that he had accomplished 
in his life, John was never too busy or 
too important for you. 
John made such a profound impact 
on all of us because his kindness, hu-
mility, and gentle strength were rooted 
in his nature. 
He understood that his life’s work 
could never be finished, and he never 
missed 
an 
opportunity 
to 
inspire 
younger generations to carry that 
work forward. 
I will never forget when John’s inspi-
ration healed deep wounds in my own 
community. In 2005, a high school in 
my district was struggling with racial 
tension between Black and Latinx stu-
dents. Students were hopelessly di-
vided, and John offered to visit the 
high school with me. 
He spoke to students and their par-
ents and helped them understand that 
the civil rights movement benefited all 
disenfranchised communities. He re-
minded us that when minority commu-
nities allow ourselves to be pitted 
against each other, we all suffer. 
As serious as John was, he also had a 
lighthearted and fun side to him as 
well. I will never forget when he made 
a video of himself dancing ‘‘Gangnam 
Style’’ to encourage young people to 
vote. He was up for anything that pro-
moted voting and civic engagement. 
John had a profound impact on my 
son, Joaquin, when we walked together 
in Selma across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge. Joaquin, who was 7 at the time, 
was able to walk with John Lewis and 
retrace the footsteps of history with a 
living legend. Joaquin was so moved 
that he read all of John’s books and 
wrote a report on him during a unit on 
African-American history in school. 
I will always cherish the memories 
that my family and I were lucky 
enough to share with John. 
It is a cruel irony that we should lose 
John when the qualities that made him 
great are needed so desperately today 
in our government. But his passing is a 
heartbreaking reminder of what really 
matters. 
Because of John, we know that rid-
ding our society of injustice requires

all of us to get in good trouble. Because 
of John, we know we can withstand 
true adversity. 
History will remember John Lewis as 
a hero who made the world better for 
all. It is worth remembering that he 
did so by showing and reminding us all 
to be better versions of ourselves. 
I am so grateful to have called him a 
friend, a colleague, and a mentor. My 
husband and son were here this morn-
ing to say good-bye to Mr. Lewis for 
the last time. My son thought it was 
important to see him off on his journey 
to walk with angels. We will miss him 
dearly. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, as has been said, John Lewis 
grew up on a chicken farm to share-
croppers in Troy, Alabama. During 
that time, there was great pain and 
suffering 
for 
our 
African-American 
brothers and sisters in the segregated 
South. 
John Lewis’s mother, in the summer 
of 1951, when John was 11, wanted to 
get him out of the heat of the seg-
regated South, and she sent him to a 
place called Buffalo, New York, my 
hometown. Mrs. Lewis had baked for 3 
days, because stopping in a diner along 
the way was not an option for the 
Lewis family. 
John Lewis, when he got to Buffalo, 
he saw young kids, Black and White, 
playing together in Olmsted Park, now 
appropriately called Martin Luther 
King Jr. Park. He saw White women 
and Black women drinking from the 
same water fountain. He saw his un-
cles, Black men, working aside White 
men in the steel and flour mills of Buf-
falo, New York. 
It was from that experience in Buf-
falo, in the summer of 1951, at age 11, 
that John said that he believed the de-
segregation of the South was possible, 
and he committed his lifework to that 
cause. 
On March 7, 1965, as we know, John 
led a peaceful civil rights march over 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The idea 
was to march from Selma to Mont-
gomery, the State’s capital, a distance 
of about 55 miles. There were 148 State 
troopers waiting at the foot of the 
bridge for John and the peaceful dem-
onstrators. 
The State troopers said to cease and 
disperse. John led his fellow marchers, 
and they kneeled and prayed. Then, 
they were attacked. 
They broke John’s skull. But before 
John went to the hospital to be admin-
istered to, he insisted on waiting till 
the news media got there. With blood 
pouring down his face, he admonished 
the President of the United States to 
take up the civil rights cause. 
On August 6 of that year, the Voting 
Rights Act was signed into law by 
President Johnson. 
John said, oddly, one time that he 
was grateful for the police beating be-
cause had that event not occurred, had 
that not become Bloody Sunday, it 
would have just passed as a local news 
story. Nobody would have witnessed it, 
and nothing would have changed. 
John always said, you sometimes 
have to give a little blood to redeem 
the soul of a nation. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a 
testament to the vision of John Lewis, 
a man of goodness and a man of grace, 
who at the age of 11, in the summer of 
1951, was inspired by what he saw in 
Buffalo and had the presence of mind 
and the courage to act on that inspira-
tion. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ala-
bama (Ms. SEWELL). 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise again to honor the life 
and legacy of John Robert Lewis, a 
civil rights hero, mentor, and dear 
friend. 
It is rare that you grow up to meet 
your hero and rarer still that you get 
to befriend them. 
Growing up in Selma, Alabama, and a 
lifelong member of Brown Chapel AME 
Church, year after year, I would sit and 
marvel at those foot soldiers coming to 
my church to reenact that Bloody Sun-
day. There was Coretta Scott King and 
Joseph Lowery. There was Amelia 
Boynton Robinson, but, of course, 
there was John Lewis. 
Never in my wildest dreams did I 
think that I would grow up and become 
Alabama’s first Black congresswoman 
and not only walk the halls with John 
Lewis but get to sit on the same com-
mittee with John Lewis. 
John was a slice of home for me in 
Congress. You see, looking into his 
eyes, I would see home, and all I would 
want to do is emulate home. John was 
a chief deputy whip, so I wanted to be 
a chief deputy whip. John was on the 
Ways and Means Committee. Sounded 
good to me. 
John was always allowing people to 
radiate in his smile and in his light. He 
could never talk about voting rights— 
if I were within earshot, he would say: 
‘‘And TERRI SEWELL represents Selma. 
Where is Terri?’’ And we would laugh. 
Those private moments were so pre-
cious to me. Those are the moments 
that I will cherish. 
When I would call him the boy from 
Troy, he would call me the girl from 
Selma. We would laugh at how far our 
State had come, how far our Nation 
had come. I would say: ‘‘But, John, we 
have so much more to do.’’ He would 
remind me that the better days of our 
Nation were ahead of it. 
I don’t know how I will continue to 
fight for the right to vote and restore 
the Voting Rights Act that he shed a 
little blood on a bridge in my home-
town for, but I know that I am not 
alone, that John has sowed seeds of 
hope and inspiration into so many of 
us. 
We are all disciples of John, and we 
all owe it to him to pick up that man-
tle and to continue the march, the 
march toward a more perfect Union. 
For, you see, John has sowed seeds in 
all of us. Can’t you hear him? Just 
close your eyes. If you see something 
that is unjust, unfair, you have a moral 
obligation to do something about it, to 
get in the way. 
Never give up. Never give in. Keep 
the faith. Keep your eyes on the prize. 
Rest in peace, my friend. Know that 
we all will pick up that mantle and 
continue your march. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. DELBENE). 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I was 
born in Selma, Alabama, and I was 3 
years old when John Lewis crossed the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
My family moved away when I was 
young, but I still carried my birth-
place. We moved quite frequently, and 
every new town we would go to, I would 
go to a school, and a teacher would ask 
where I was born. I would say Selma, 
and that started a whole conversation 
about what happened in Selma. 
It is on my passport: Selma, Ala-
bama. So many people who have seen 
that have started a conversation about 
what John Lewis and so many people 
did, crossing that bridge in Selma. 
The story has become part of me, 
part of my life. 
And I never, ever imagined, first, 
that I would be a Member of Congress, 
let alone have the opportunity to serve 
on the Ways and Means Committee 
with my hero, John Lewis. 
One of the first trips I ever took as a 
Member of Congress was to go to 
Selma, to go back to my birthplace 
with TERRI SEWELL, with John Lewis. 
We were the Selma caucus, the three of 
us, on the Ways and Means Committee. 
Just to be able to experience that, to 
talk to John—I had the chance to go to 
South Africa with John when he gave a 
talk at the 50th anniversary of Bobby 
Kennedy’s ‘‘Ripples of Hope’’ speech 
and talk to John and hear his stories. 
He lifted all of us up. He was an icon, 
yet when you were with him, I think 
we all became better people. He lifted 
us up, and he reminded all of us—in 
fact, he showed all of us what is pos-
sible, what each of us can do, how we 
can create change if we stand up, if we 
speak up for what is right and for what 
is just and what is fair. 
b 2030 
So we will continue to honor John, 
each of us, by doing that, by speaking 
out, by getting into ‘‘good trouble,’’ 
necessary trouble. 
And, John, we will always remember 
your words, your kindness, your lead-
ership. Thank you for passing a little 
bit of that on to each of us. Rest in 
peace. We will miss you terribly. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. JUDY CHU). 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember my 
friend and colleague, John Lewis. 
To say John Lewis was a civil rights 
icon barely captures his legacy because

he was so much more than that. He was 
a living piece of the civil rights move-
ment, a connection to historic injus-
tice, and a reminder of our power to 
remedy it. 
John didn’t just talk about voting 
rights, he nearly died defending the 
right to vote. And because of him and 
his determination to do what was 
right, to stand up to injustice when-
ever he saw it, and to cause a little 
‘‘good trouble’’ whenever it was need-
ed, our country is a more just and equi-
table one. 
It was one of the greatest privileges 
of my life that I was not only able to 
serve alongside John on the Ways and 
Means Committee, but I was able to 
march alongside him as well. In Ala-
bama, he led many of us on the annual 
pilgrimage of Selma across that Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge. 
But throughout his life, he gave voice 
to the voiceless, fought to empower the 
powerless, and stood up for those who 
could not. 
I will never forget that June day here 
in Washington, D.C., after 49 people 
were shot dead in Florida in yet an-
other senseless mass shooting. John 
said, ‘‘Enough is enough.’’ He came to 
the House floor, right there, in fact, 
and sat down. We joined him for 26 
straight hours while the Nation tuned 
in, transfixed. 
When the President was keeping im-
migrant children in cages, John led us 
on a march to the CBP offices to de-
mand these children be released. It was 
so hot and humid that many of us felt 
like fainting, but I looked over at 
John, and there he was still standing 
strong and marching. I thought to my-
self: His strength is the result of dec-
ades of civil disobedience. 
This past week, we passed the his-
toric NO BAN Act to stop the senseless 
travel ban against Muslims. And it was 
John who, 3 years ago, went to the At-
lanta airport when the ban was first 
announced to demand answers and re-
lease. And when he was essentially ig-
nored by Customs and Border Protec-
tion, he started a sit-in right that mo-
ment at the airport. 
John was always a moral voice urg-
ing us to think of others and to do all 
that we can to improve their lives. 
Even in the face of the worst, John 
never stopped believing in our capacity 
for the best. I will miss him and his 
guidance. John may be gone, but we 
will keep marching. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for arranging for 
this opportunity for the Ways and 
Means Committee to come together to 
honor our brother, John Lewis. 
Just listening to my colleagues gives 
me a greater sense of just how privi-
leged we all have been. I think we often 
take for granted the people who are 
around us, and I don’t think we can 
ever take John for granted, but to a 
certain extent, when I arrived here, I 
got used to seeing him on the floor. 
And it is hard to come to this floor 
without having a little bit of anticipa-
tion that, of the many privileges that 
come with serving our country in this 
place, the one privilege that I could al-
ways count on was that, even on those 
tough days when the job wasn’t so 
great, we could always plan on seeing 
John Lewis and getting some encour-
agement from him. 
I met John before I came to Con-
gress, just about 8 years ago, through 
my Uncle Dale. Dale Kildee served here 
for a long time. He served almost a 
quarter of a century with John and 
loved John—still does. 
I have talked to Dale about John 
quite often. That was a relationship 
that led to me wanting to make sure 
that I tried to develop that same rela-
tionship and, of course, becoming a 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
We spend so much time together, de-
spite the fact that we haven’t been able 
to the last couple of months. As a com-
mittee, we spend an enormous amount 
of time working together and having 
meals together and talking to one an-
other. It felt like I had a chance to get 
so much closer to John, and I will 
never forget that. 
As big and monumental a life as he 
led, as important a voice as he was, as 
such a soldier for justice and a figure 
in American history, as good and de-
cent as a man he was in that respect, 
as we all know now, of course, is that 
he was that good a friend. He was that 
good a human being. He was that gen-
erous a person. 
For me, the last couple of months, 
obviously, it has been hard, but it has 
been special, because John, under our 
temporary 
rules, 
John, 
of 
course, 
hasn’t been able to be with us in these 
last couple of months as he was bat-
tling a sickness but asked if I would be 
willing to carry his proxy and cast his 
votes here on the floor. 
I don’t know that a greater honor 
could ever be bestowed upon me by 
him, but he was always grateful to me. 
I had to speak to him before each vote 
series, and he was always so grateful. 
I thought to myself: John, I am 
grateful to you that you have given me 
this honor to cast a vote for the person 
who is most known for the sacred right 
to vote of anyone in our generation, 
perhaps anyone in our Nation’s history. 
The way we honor him, though, is 
with moments like this; but the best 
way that we honor him is to carry his 
work forward, to continue to do his 
work. And so the way I view it, while, 
for a couple of months I did carry his 
vote to this floor, even though John is 
gone, I think we can all continue to 
carry his vote, carry his voice, carry 
his work to this place and all across 
the country. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man for giving us this opportunity. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. 
ESTES). 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the life and legacy of our 
colleague, John Lewis. 
In my short time in Congress, I have 
had the privilege of working with John 
as members of the Ways and Means 
Committee. And in that time, I can tell 
you John is a true statesman. 
Here in Washington, and even inside 
this Chamber, we see some individuals 
with personal agendas who are only in-
terested in transactional relationships; 
however, John was a compassionate 
soul, dedicated to the cause of equality 
and justice. 
Because of John’s experiences with 
discrimination and hate, he brought to 
this body a thoughtful and passionate 
approach to ensuring that all Ameri-
cans can experience the blessings of 
liberty that are guaranteed in our Con-
stitution. 
He understood the pain of a divided 
nation, the progress we have made over 
the past century, and the challenges we 
still face. Through it all, he met anger 
and violence with peace and love, a 
demonstration of his character that I 
think all of us can learn from. 
I used to live in Nashville, Tennessee, 
and one of John’s earliest acts was 
seeking peaceful change and organizing 
sit-ins at Nashville lunch counters. 
This is reminiscent to me of a coura-
geous group of young people in my 
hometown, Wichita, who also sought 
equal treatment at a popular down-
town lunch counter. The 1958 Dockum 
Drug Store sit-in was part of an early 
movement in cities across the country 
that helped advance desegregation. 
I am so thankful that the youth in 
Wichita, along with men and women 
like John Lewis, had the boldness and 
fortitude to advance necessary and 
overdue changes in a racially seg-
regated environment. 
While we served on different sides of 
the aisle, his compassion for others was 
evident and his love of country unwav-
ering. My memories of John will be of 
his legacy and his service. I am grate-
ful to have served alongside him during 
my tenure in Congress, and I am 
thankful for his dedication to equality 
for Americans, the Georgians he rep-
resented, and the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man for leading this special hour. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlemen from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE). 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for organizing this oppor-
tunity for those of us who served with 
John on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee to be able to come together as a 
committee and mourn him. 
I have to say sitting here for the last 
hour or so and listening to all of my 
colleagues share their remembrances 
about John Lewis and just how special 
he was to them has truly been one of 
the best hours that I have spent on the 
House floor, and it has just been beau-
tiful to listen to. I think it is a side of 
Congress that people rarely get to see, 
and I think we would be better off, all 
of us would be better off, if we were 
able to do this more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3973 
July 29, 2020 
When I hear the name John Lewis, 
obviously, this is one of the great 
American heroes in history, but that is 
not the first thing I think of. 
When he comes to mind, the first 
thing I think of was just what a kind 
and quiet and humble and gentle man 
he was, always so nice to me from my 
very first day as a freshman, when I 
heard a voice behind me that said, 
‘‘Young man, is this seat taken?’’ And 
I looked to the side of me and it was 
John Lewis, and I couldn’t even speak. 
He was just always that person to ev-
eryone. And, to me, that is a great les-
son that should inspire us all to be bet-
ter people. 
I also believe, as a matter of faith, 
that I don’t think it was an accident or 
a coincidence that the Lord called him 
home at this time during this summer 
of crisis in our Nation. 
America has not quite become. We 
are constantly in the act of becoming. 
America is a nation born not of a race 
or a tribe, but out of ideas, a commit-
ment to ideals. Someone who firmly 
believed that with every fiber of his 
being to deep in his soul was John 
Lewis. And throughout this year, and 
at this time, I know there are many in 
our society who are questioning the fu-
ture of America, as it seems like we are 
coming apart at the seams. 
Well, let’s listen to the voice again of 
John Lewis, someone who never lost 
his faith and his optimism in this coun-
try, what it stands for, what it is called 
to be, and what he truly believed it will 
be. He gave his blood for this cause. He 
lived his life for it. And let him con-
tinue to be an example for all of us 
today. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Chairman NEAL for doing this. I found 
this the most healing experience since 
John’s loss. 
Madam Speaker, as we approach the 
end of our life, it is fitting to think 
about how we will be remembered. Will 
they say: Was he brave? Was he kind? 
Was he humble? Was he honest? 
But time wipes all memories away, 
and what is left? What impact did we 
have on the lives of others, of the peo-
ple to come? 
John Lewis is the best of men, the 
most Christ-like person I have ever 
known, and he changed the personal 
trajectories of tens of millions of peo-
ple. 
Born into poverty and racism, John 
has become the desperate hope that we 
need. Hammarskjold wrote that all life 
asks of us is that we live it with cour-
age. I grieve, we all grieve deeply this 
most courageous man, and thank God 
for his life. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. EVANS). 
b 2045 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise to honor truly a great Amer-
ican, a real-life hero, who I was fortu-
nate enough to have as a colleague for 
4 years, including the 2 years serving 
together on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. Congressman John Lewis has 
been an inspiration to me from a very 
young age. 
I remember the first time I saw him 
on the Walter Cronkite evening news. 
He was walking across the Pettus 
Bridge in Selma. I felt very strongly 
about him and what he was doing. 
Madam Speaker, I was 10 years old, and 
I found him to be inspiring. He was 
purposeful. He was driven to make a 
difference. He was driven for ‘‘good 
trouble.’’ 
As a result of his action and because 
of the action of another gentleman who 
was a part of the Big Six, Whitney 
Young, I worked at the Urban League. 
I recall being elected to the Pennsyl-
vania State House at 26 years of age, 
and it was John Lewis that inspired 
me, though I had never been to Ala-
bama, but I had seen him on television. 
I remember that impression that he 
left upon me, because—although I had 
heard all the words I have heard 
today—I had never seen such deter-
mination. 
So you can imagine growing up in 
the city of Philadelphia in Pennsyl-
vania, him from Selma, Alabama, and 
the influence he was having. 
I also honored him by welcoming 
Congressman Lewis to the southeast 
part of Pennsylvania for a gun reform 
ceasefire. I recall introducing him. I re-
call all of that. 
But now, Madam Speaker, we must 
carry on his work of civil rights, equal 
opportunity. Most of all, we must re-
dedicate ourselves to protecting the 
right to vote and making use of hard- 
won rights, a right for which John 
Lewis and many others sacrificed for 
all of us. 
So I say to you, Madam Speaker and 
Mr. Chairman, he should rest in peace 
and power. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for organizing this Special Order this 
evening. 
This morning the Capitol bid farewell 
for the last time to our colleague and 
friend, the inimitable American hero, 
our beloved John Lewis. 
In the days since his passing, count-
less words have been delivered in trib-
ute to John’s life, his accomplish-
ments, his character, his importance to 
our Nation. 
I have no doubt in the years to come 
John Lewis will take his place in our 
history books among not only the 
champions of the civil rights move-
ment but also in the pantheon of his-
torical giants who have literally re-
shaped the foundation and recalibrated 
the moral compass of our Nation. 
But as our Speaker clearly recog-
nized on Tuesday when his body was 
brought to lie in state under the Cap-
itol’s dome, no words, no matter how 
great the tribute, can match those of 
John himself. From his famous speech 
in 1963 at the March on Washington to 
his frequent and inspired remarks to 
his fellow Members of Congress, often 
in what seemed like the darkest mo-
ments, John Lewis’ voice thundered, 
but his words were always uplifting. 
He talked to us about ‘‘good trou-
ble,’’ noting that there is nothing 
wrong with a little agitation for what 
is right and what is fair. 
He instructed us to see all sides of an 
issue, ‘‘You have to tell the whole 
truth, the good and the bad, maybe 
some things that are uncomfortable for 
some people.’’ 
And he always looked to the future 
with hope and optimism. ‘‘Take a long, 
hard look down the road you will have 
to travel once you have made a com-
mitment to work for change. Know 
that this transformation will not hap-
pen right away. Change often takes 
time.’’ But he also said: ‘‘If you’re not 
hopeful and optimistic, then you just 
give up. You have to take the long, 
hard look and just believe that if 
you’re consistent, you will succeed.’’ 
John may have left this Earth, but 
his inspiration remains deep within us. 
I hope in the days ahead we can honor 
his memory by passing into law the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
And wouldn’t it be fitting to also re-
name the Edmund Pettus Bridge— 
where 55 years ago John put his life on 
the line to change the world—the John 
Robert Lewis Memorial Bridge to re-
flect the change that John brought to 
the world. 
May his memory remain a blessing 
for each of us and for our country at 
these most difficult times and hope-
fully in better times ahead. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
SUOZZI). 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, it was 
such a great gift and honor when John 
Lewis would call me like he called 
many of us, ‘‘my brother,’’ to serve on 
his committee, to ask him to give the 
closing prayer at this year’s National 
Prayer Breakfast, to travel to Selma 
with him, and like all he came in con-
tact with, to learn from him. 
When the Christian church was in its 
infancy, there was tremendous infight-
ing, different tribes and sects, different 
personalities battling over the direc-
tion of this new organization that will 
go on to transform the world. 
Paul the Apostle, one of the earliest 
and most prolific leaders, was impris-
oned by the Romans and ultimately be-
headed for his belief in Jesus. 
While in prison in 62 AD, Paul wrote 
a series of letters to the followers of 
Jesus instructing them how to conduct 
themselves. 
In his letter to the Ephesians, Paul 
gave this instruction in chapter 4, 
versus 1 to 3: ‘‘I, then, a prisoner for 
the Lord, urge you to live in a manner 
worthy of the call you have received,

with all humility and gentleness, with 
patience, bearing with one another 
through love, striving to preserve the 
unity of the spirit through the bond of 
peace.’’ 
John Lewis also a prisoner for the 
Lord many times, lived that model life 
worthy of his calling with humility and 
gentleness, with patience, bearing with 
everyone through love, striving to pre-
serve unity through the bond of peace. 
John Lewis showed us that strength 
comes from humility and gentleness 
and patience and love, striving for 
unity through peace. 
I know I need to be better. Thank 
you, John Lewis. Rest in peace, good 
and faithful servant. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

REFLECTIONS 
OF 
MEMBERS 
OF 
THE 
WAYS 
AND 
MEANS 
COM-
MITTEE WITH RESPECT TO CON-
GRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLY) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for having this Special Order in which 
we rise, remember, and recognize one 
of our country’s civil rights champions, 
one of America’s heroes, my friend, our 
colleague, and, yes, the conscience of 
Congress, Congressman John Robert 
Lewis. 
Now, unlike some other Members 
that spoke earlier, even though John 
was a fellow Member of Congress, he 
was a fellow Member on the Ways and 
Means Committee, I have to say I 
never got used to having John Lewis as 
a fellow colleague. 
As Mr. KELLY alluded to and said, I 
should say, we do have a family here on 
the Ways and Means Committee, but it 
was clear that John was that favorite 
child. All of us were in awe as to every-
thing he did and everything that John 
stood for. 
And that is part of the reason why 
my wife and I took our two daughters 
down to Selma, Alabama, this last 
March to walk arm in arm with John 
Lewis 
across 
the 
Edmund 
Pettus 
Bridge for the last time. 
Now, obviously, with the ceremonies 
this week in John’s passing we have 
been thinking a lot about John, but 
this past weekend I could not get him 
out of my head. And it resonated with 
me the most when my wife and I took 
our two daughters up to Gettysburg, 
Pennsylvania, and we stood on the bat-
tlefield, in that cemetery and at that 
monument and read the speech that 
President Lincoln gave to consecrate 
that hallowed ground. And I can tell 
you it reminded me of the lifelong 
fight of John Lewis. It reminded me of 
our Nation’s lifelong fight for equality. 
And it reminded me of our continued 
fight today. And you will see what I 
mean when I use some of that speech in 
my following remarks. 
Although we are a Nation conceived 
in liberty and equality, it seems as if 
now our Nation is divided and being 
tested as to whether we can endure to-
gether. Now we gather here tonight to 
honor the death of a man who literally 
shed blood so that our Nation can live 
together. But in a larger sense what we 
say here tonight is nothing compared 
to what John Lewis did throughout his 
life. 
See, as with most of our speeches on 
the House floor, the world will little 
note nor long remember what we say 
here tonight, but it can never forget 
what John did, not only in this Cham-
ber, but also for civil rights and for 
this country. 
So it is for us, from Congress Mem-
bers to frontline workers to peaceful 
protestors to be dedicated to the unfin-
ished work which John fought for and 
so nobly advanced. And with the pass-
ing of John Lewis let us be dedicated to 
the task remaining before us, that 
from John’s life we take increased de-
votion to the cause for which he gave 
full measure of devotion that we here 
highly resolve, that his actions, his 
service, his sacrifice shall never be in 
vain, that this Nation under God shall 
continue to have freedom and equality 
and that our government of the people, 
by the people, and for the people shall 
never perish from this Earth, but shall 
always live with the conscience of our 
country, John Robert Lewis. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GOMEZ). 
Mr. 
GOMEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for doing this Special Order hour to re-
member the life of John Lewis. 
He called other people ‘‘brother.’’ He 
called me ‘‘young brother,’’ so I guess I 
was the little guy. 
He was such an amazing man. He had 
a huge character. He was a civil rights 
giant who amplified the voices of a 
generation. His commitment to dis-
mantling hatred and oppression in 
whatever its form was something that 
inspired generations, and it is some-
thing that we all know that we stand 
on his shoulders on for our own fights 
for greater equality in this country. 
His strength and resolve, showcased 
during the Nashville sit-in movement, 
the Freedom Riders, and the March on 
Washington gave us the momentum to 
carry on through adversity and taught 
us what it means to get into some 
‘‘good trouble.’’ 
And those who knew John and 
marched with him, whether it was to 
protest the detention of immigrant 
children, as I did a few years ago, or to 
speak out against racial injustice, al-
ways felt a little bit more hopeful when 
he was around. It created that little bit 
of a ripple of hope from person to per-
son when he was marching with you. 
I believe he also created a little bit of 
a ripple of change in every single per-
son he met that transformed and em-
powered communities and for future 
generations still unborn. That is the 
kind of legacy he left. 
But I also got to see him as just a 
humble person, a regular person. And I 
noticed when we would walk from the 
Ways and Means Committee room back 
here to vote, I would always kind of 
walk with him, and people would come 
up and ask for a photograph, you know, 
school children and adults alike. And 
they would get around him and, you 
know, I was pushed aside, and I took 
the phone and I was proud to take the 
photographs. He would always say: Hi, 
I am John Lewis. What is your name 
and where are you from? And he took 
that moment to make it about them, 
not about him. 
Imagine if we were all like that, 
where we just paused a little bit and 
took the moment to make it about the 
other person, the other party, the other 
State, the other person from a different 
country. Imagine what this country 
would be like. It would be a lot better. 
It would be a lot more hopeful and 
would create that ripple of change that 
we all desire. 
I know John is getting up to the 
pearly gates of Heaven with Saint 
Peter, who is the guardian of those 
gates, and John is going to say: Hi, I 
am John Lewis, nice to meet you. 
b 2100 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments. 
Madam Speaker, the Nation had a 
chance tonight to hear about the affec-
tion and regard that we held for a very 
important member of the Ways and 
Means family, John Lewis. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. KELLY 
for yielding me the time. He did urge 
at a moment last week: I hope that we 
will be able to do a bipartisan tribute 
to John. 
I said we planned one, and we want to 
make sure both sides are involved. 
I just want to close on this note, as 
we travel to Atlanta tomorrow to say 
good-bye to John. At a Committee on 
Ways and Means Democratic retreat in 
New York about 2 years ago, with a 
very distinguished alumnus of the 
Democratic Party as well, Charlie Ran-
gel came over to the dinner. John, my-
self, and former Chairman Rangel, we 
were sitting and just talking at the end 
of the night. After the conversation, 
when John got up and left, Charlie 
Rangel said to me: You know, Rich, 
there were many of us who did the 
right thing along the way. Many of us 
participated fully in the civil rights 
movement. But John Lewis would have 
died for the cause. 
Pretty 
remarkable: 
John 
Lewis 
would have died for the cause. 
Tonight, Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank the Members of the House, both 
political parties, and the Ways and 
Means family for a nice tribute to our 
friend, John Lewis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3975 
July 29, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Chair, I thank Chairman NEAL so much 
for hosting this Special Order. 
We truly are a family, and at times 
like this, that really comes out. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor my friend John Lewis. A giant of the 
civil rights movement in life, John Lewis’ leg-
acy now transcends his death. Nearly two 
hundred years after our Founders dedicated 
our nation to the proposition that all men are 
created equal, John Lewis worked to secure 
that precious truth. He did so with a warm 
heart and a smile on his face. He brought that 
same spirit to Congress, where we served on 
the Ways and Means Committee together and 
his presence was always uplifting. 
Facing racial segregation and violence, 
Congressman Lewis held an unwavering con-
viction in the ability of nonviolence to deliver 
equality to all Americans. 
His tireless and bold efforts were met with 
determined resistance and brutality. He suf-
fered vicious beatings and unwarranted ar-
rests. Through all strife and opposition, he 
stood bloody but unbowed. 
John Lewis helped move our nation, and he 
will be dearly missed in this House. 
f 
HONORING DR. HAFEEZ MALIK 
AND DR. LYNDA MALIK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
FITZPATRICK) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in tribute to a man whose life not 
only stands as a testament to his own 
achievements but also as an illustra-
tion of the greatness of the United 
States of America and as an embodi-
ment of the American Dream. 
Dr. Hafeez Malik, whose son Dean 
Malik has resided in Bucks County 
with his family for almost 20 years, 
passed away on April 20, 2020, at the 
age of 90 years old. 
Dr. 
Malik 
was 
a 
professor 
at 
Villanova University for over 50 years, 
teaching undergraduate and graduate- 
level courses in political science, inter-
national relations, American history, 
and American government. 
Dr. Malik was a world-renowned 
scholar who dedicated much of his life 
to strengthening the relationship be-
tween Pakistan, the country from 
which he emigrated, and the United 
States. 
Dr. Malik provided lectures to Amer-
ican diplomats and senior military offi-
cers on multiple occasions at the U.S. 
State Department, while also forming 
the Pakistani American Congress in 
the 1990s. 
Dr. Malik’s scholarship has become 
an invaluable contribution, enabling 
the United States to understand the 
nuances of diplomacy throughout the 
Muslim world and has guided American 
foreign policy for nearly half a cen-
tury. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. Malik’s success 
and acclaim would not have been pos-
sible without the love and support of 
the love of his life, his wife of 64 years, 
fellow Villanova professor Dr. Lynda 
Malik. 
Hafeez and Lynda met as students at 
Syracuse University in the early 1950s. 
They got married in 1956. 
These two amazing people embarked 
upon an amazing, productive, and re-
nowned public partnership grounded in 
the bonds of everlasting marriage, end-
ing only with Hafeez’s recent death. 
Throughout the Villanova University 
community, in the international world 
of academia, as well as in their social 
circles in southeastern Pennsylvania, 
where I represent, and elsewhere in the 
United States and in their home coun-
try of Pakistan, Hafeez and Lynda were 
known as a married power couple. 
Throughout the years, they shared in 
each other’s successes as well as each 
other’s hardships and served as produc-
tive, upstanding members of our com-
munity. 
Hafeez and Lynda were also proud, 
patriotic Americans. Their son Dean, 
who is a friend of mine, is a former Ma-
rine officer, a former criminal pros-
ecutor, a practicing attorney, and a 
proud Iraq war veteran. 
Madam Speaker, in death, Dr. Malik 
leaves behind his lifelong spouse and 
partner, who is suffering from demen-
tia, and a disabled older son. Neverthe-
less, it is a comfort to all who know 
them that the success earned by this 
couple throughout their lifetime shall 
go to support these family members 
now in their time of vulnerability and 
their time of need, and that their son is 
to carry on Hafeez’s legacy of public 
service in this life. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in tribute to a 
man and his wife whose life not only 
stands as a testament to his own 
achievements but also as an illustra-
tion of the greatness of the United 
States of America and as an embodi-
ment of the American Dream itself. 
Madam Speaker, let us honor not 
only the life of Hafeez Malik and his 
wife, Lynda, but also his lifelong part-
nership with his wife, Lynda; their 
amazing family; all they have done for 
the community of Pennsylvania; all 
they have done for Villanova Univer-
sity as a couple; and all they have done 
for the United States of America as a 
couple. 
They are a great family. They were a 
very, very special couple, and I wanted 
to honor them on the floor of the 
House of Representatives tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I ask to have this 
speech and the life of Hafeez and his 
wife, Lynda, permanently entered into 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

S4553 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JULY 29, 2020 
No. 134 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Eternal God, You have taken care of 
us in the years that have gone. We 
honor You for Your glory and strength. 
May we place our hope in You and 
never forget that You can also sustain 
us in the future. 
Today, give our Senators the wisdom 
to trust You in the small things, real-
izing that faithfulness with the least 
prepares them for fidelity with the 
much. As they seek to be stewards of 
Your justice, mercy, and grace, use 
them to fulfill Your purposes. Lord, 
given them a love for Your wisdom and 
a passion to be guided by your pre-
cepts. 
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
now that the United Kingdom has sepa-
rated from the European Union, it is 
our opportunity to sit down with the 
United Kingdom and do some business. 
Therefore, I am pleased that the United 
States and the United Kingdom are 
making strides in our negotiations to 
complete a free trade agreement. 
Our two countries, as you know, have 
a centuries-old relationship. That rela-
tionship will be further strengthened 
by a comprehensive deal that presents 
economic opportunities for our farm-
ers, our manufacturers, and our service 
providers to the benefit of both sides of 
the Atlantic. 
I will continue to insist that an 
agreement reached between our two 
countries will allow us to reach our full 
potential as trading partners, particu-
larly when it comes to agricultural 
trade. 
The United Kingdom has been subject 
to very restrictive European Union 
rules that have no scientific basis. We 
call those sanitary and phytosanitary 
rules. 
I urge the administration to work 
with the United Kingdom negotiators 
to achieve greater marketing access 
for U.S. farmers. In other words, I am 
tired of the EU restrictions that we 
have had over the last couple of dec-
ades on our GMO grains. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
when the Senate passed the CARES 
Act back in March, we were trying to 
prepare the Nation for economic paral-
ysis and the medical battle of the cen-
tury at the very same time. Hospitals, 
healthcare providers, small businesses, 
and working families needed help fast, 
and the Senate stepped up in historic 
fashion. 
For 
months, 
our 
legislation 
has 
helped cushion the pain of this crisis 
from coast to coast, but our Nation is 
not finished with this fight. More 
Americans are dying every day. Mil-
lions and millions are unemployed. And 
the institutions of American life can-
not stay totally shut down until our 
race for a vaccine hits the finish line. 
Our Nation needs to smartly and 
safely reopen while keeping up the 
medical battle. We need to get kids 
safely back to school and adults safely 
back to work without losing ground in 
the healthcare fight. 
The coronavirus does not care that 
we are divided. The coronavirus will 
not care if Washington Democrats de-
cide it suits their partisan goals to let 
relief run dry. The American people are 
hurting, and Congress should have 
their backs. 
On Monday, I laid down a marker to 
shape 
the 
bipartisan 
conversations 
that need to happen now—not a loony, 
ideological fantasy like the House 
Democrats bill from a few months ago, 
which would have cut taxes for rich 
people, raised taxes on small business, 
and provided no additional round for 
the Paycheck Protection Program. No, 
serious talks actually require a serious 
starting point. 
That is why we wrote a serious bill 
containing largely bipartisan policies. 
It has another round of cash for house-
holds—more than $3,000 for an eligible 
family of four, with even more support 
for adult dependents; another round of 
additional Federal unemployment ben-
efits assistance, which would otherwise 
simply expire; and another targeted 
round of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram to prevent even more layoffs and 
keep paychecks coming to American 
workers. It has powerful new incen-
tives to jump-start rehiring, bring 
down unemployment, and create safe 
workplaces for workers and customers. 
It has more support for hospitals and 
health providers; more support for test-
ing, PPE, and diagnostics; and more re-
sources for the sprint toward a vaccine. 
It has historic support for schools to 
reopen—a higher dollar amount than 
House Democrats managed to propose 
in their bill, which costs three times as 
much as ours.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4554 
July 29, 2020 
And—uniting all three pillars of kids, 
jobs, and healthcare—we have legal 
protection 
for 
medical 
workers, 
schools, nonprofits, and businesses so 
that well-connected trial lawyers can’t 
get even richer off of stopping the re-
covery in its tracks. 
This is a more-than-fair, more-than- 
bipartisan framework for Democrats to 
engage with. The only reason I can see 
that Speaker PELOSI and the Demo-
cratic leader would sabotage negotia-
tions is if, as some concluded when 
they killed police reform in June, they 
actually think bipartisan progress for 
the country would hurt their own polit-
ical chances. That is why I said a few 
days ago that we would quickly learn 
whether the American people would be 
getting the responsible Democratic 
Party from March or the cynical, ob-
structionist Democratic Party from 
June that blocked police reform. So 
let’s review the early going. 
Almost the instant we put out this 
proposal—which would send thousands 
of dollars in cash to families and even 
more cash to unemployed people—the 
Democratic 
leader 
proclaimed 
that 
‘‘those Republican, hard-right money 
people . . . don’t want the Federal Gov-
ernment to help anybody.’’ 
A trillion dollar proposal for kids, 
jobs, and healthcare just proves Repub-
licans don’t want to help anyone. 
Yesterday, after meeting with the ad-
ministration, the Speaker of the House 
said this ‘‘isn’t a negotiation.’’ 
So here we go again. It is the script 
from police reform all over again. 
We have had weeks of talk from 
Democrats about the urgency of the 
issue, weeks of Democrats thundering 
that people will be hurt if we don’t act. 
But then, when it is time to actually 
make a law, Democrats would rather 
keep political issues alive than find a 
bipartisan way to resolve them. 
Take the issue of additional Federal 
unemployment insurance. For weeks 
now, it has been clear to a majority of 
Americans that we should not pay peo-
ple more to stay home than we pay 
people who continue working. 
Should we have generous unemploy-
ment insurance in this crisis? Of 
course. Republicans want to continue 
the Federal supplement at eight times 
the level that Democrats themselves 
put in place during the last recession. 
But, obviously, we should not be tax-
ing the essential workers who have 
kept working so the government can 
pay their neighbors a higher salary to 
stay home. 
Let me say that again. We should not 
be taxing the essential workers who 
have kept working so the government 
can pay their neighbors a higher salary 
to stay home. 
Until about 5 minutes ago, this was 
not a controversial opinion. Democrats 
shared it with us. The House Democrat 
majority leader said yesterday: ‘‘That’s 
an argument that . . . has some valid-
ity to it. . . . It’s not $600 or bust.’’ 
A few days earlier, our Democratic 
colleague 
Senator 
COONS
said 
he 
thought we would be ‘‘finding some 
path forward’’ with a different dollar 
figure. 
The day before yesterday, our col-
league Senator CARDIN said: ‘‘What is 
the right number? Well, we certainly 
understand we don’t want someone to 
have higher benefits than what some-
one can make working.’’ 
At the State level, the Democratic 
Governor of Connecticut agrees. This is 
what he said: ‘‘I think sometimes it 
discourages work. . . . I would put off 
this extra $600 true-up they’re talking 
about. . . . I don’t think we need that.’’ 
That is the Democratic Governor of 
Connecticut. 
Like I said, it is not controversial. 
The Congressional Budget Office says 
that five out of six recipients of this 
aid—83 percent—receive more to stay 
home than they made on the job. 
Let me say that one more time. The 
Congressional Budget Office says that 
five out of six recipients of this aid—83 
percent—receive more to stay home 
than they made on the job. We all 
know that is not fair, and it is not 
workable in a reopening job market. 
We have already heard from small busi-
ness owners who had trouble reopening 
because it would be financially irra-
tional for their employees to come 
back. 
This is why Republicans propose to 
continue providing Federal aid—con-
tinue providing hundreds of dollars per 
week—but do it in a more targeted way 
while providing even more incentives 
for rehiring. 
But now the Speaker of the House ap-
parently signals she rejects this bipar-
tisan consensus and will not let a pack-
age go forward unless we continue pay-
ing people more not to work. That is 
apparently the Speaker’s position— 
that she will not let a package go for-
ward unless we continue paying people 
more not to work. That is what Speak-
er PELOSI apparently signaled yester-
day: No money for schools, no money 
for households, no second round of the 
PPP, no more money for hospitals or 
testing, nothing at all unless we con-
tinue to pay people more not to work. 
If the Democrats don’t get to con-
tinue taxing essential workers to pay 
other people more to stay home, then 
nobody gets a dime. 
To put it gently, that is a completely 
unhinged position. Sixty-two percent 
of Americans say that paying people 
extra to remain unemployed creates 
the wrong incentive. A Democratic 
Governor says he doesn’t want that 
continuing. Her own deputy, the House 
Democratic majority leader, said yes-
terday that there should be room to ne-
gotiate. 
But Speaker PELOSI is literally mov-
ing the goalposts so fast that even 
Democrats can’t keep up, and now she 
apparently feels that any rescue pack-
age will have to be to the political left 
of her own Democratic majority leader, 
to the political left of the Democratic 
Governor of Connecticut or she will not 
even consider it. She will just refuse to 
legislate until the election and wish 
the American families good luck in 
dealing with the pandemic. 
These are not the positions of people 
who are putting the common good 
above politics. These are not the posi-
tions of people who actually want to 
reach an agreement to save Federal un-
employment 
insurance 
from 
com-
pletely expiring. 
The American people deserve better 
than this. The American people cannot 
afford for Democrats in Congress to 
have decided in June that they are fin-
ished legislating until November—not 
during a crisis like this. The country 
needs help. The country needs action. 
If Democratic leaders decide they will 
not negotiate, they will answer to the 
American people.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
over the past 3 months, as Americans 
stayed home and forfeited their rou-
tines and their livelihoods to combat 
the spread of the virus, as essential 
workers risked their safety and their 
families’ safety, as 50 million Ameri-
cans filed unemployment claims, as 
small businesses folded, and as the dis-
ease spread rapidly through the sum-
mer, the Republican majority paused 
on addressing COVID–19 while it con-
firmed more rightwing judges. Ameri-
cans pitched in and sacrificed, and 
many suffered greatly while the Senate 
Republicans kept their assembly line

July 29, 2020 
of extreme judicial nominees humming 
along and did little else. 
Now, after an interminable delay, the 
Senate Republicans have finally admit-
ted that the country needs relief, but 
they can’t even get their act together 
to produce a halfway legitimate legis-
lative proposal. We all witnessed a 
week and a half of infighting on the 
Republican side as the country ca-
reened toward several cliffs created by 
Republican 
delay. 
The 
Republicans 
bickered amongst themselves as the 
moratorium on evictions expired, State 
and local governments shed jobs and 
cut public services, and the last en-
hanced unemployment checks went out 
the door. 
When the Republicans finally con-
vinced themselves they were ready to 
unveil a plan, instead of presenting a 
single, coherent bill, the Republicans 
released several incongruent drafts 
that were littered with corporate give-
aways, K Street handouts, and Presi-
dential pet projects. 
Some Republicans proposed billions 
of dollars for large agribusinesses and 
defense contractors but not a dime to 
help American families stay in their 
homes. The Republican bill has a tax 
break for three-martini lunches but no 
food assistance for hungry kids. There 
is $2 billion for a new FBI building, the 
location of which will increase the 
value of the Trump hotel, but no fund-
ing to help State and local govern-
ments retain teachers, firefighters, 
busdrivers, and other public employees. 
There is no support for Medicaid, for 
nursing homes, or for those with dis-
abilities. 
The proposals to support our health 
system and to meet our testing needs 
are wildly insufficient. 
If you are one of the 20 to 30 million 
Americans who lost their jobs through 
no fault of their own and you can’t find 
work, Senate Republicans think you 
have it too good right now. You should 
take a 30-percent pay cut, Republicans 
are saying. 
This is not a serious proposal for a 
country in the midst of a once-in-a- 
generation crisis. So, as you can imag-
ine, when reviews started rolling in 
yesterday, they weren’t too positive. 
One Republican Senator said: ‘‘There 
are 100 problems with the plan.’’ An-
other Republican: ‘‘It is a mess. I can’t 
figure out what this bill is about.’’ An-
other Republican of this Chamber said: 
‘‘You look at the package that was 
rolled out by the Republican leader-
ship, and it contains virtually nothing 
that will actually aid in the recovery.’’ 
Those would be harsh criticisms if they 
came 
from 
Democrats, 
but 
those 
quotes weren’t from Democrats; those 
were 
Republican 
Senators 
talking 
about their own party’s plan. 
Two senior Republican Senators have 
said that the Republican proposal 
would be lucky to get even half of the 
Republican conference to vote for it. 
Leader MCCONNELL warned Democrats 
against blocking the Republican pro-
posal. It turns out that Senate Repub-
licans are blocking the Republican pro-
posal. 
So it is abundantly clear that the 
Senate Republican proposal for the 
next phase of COVID relief is not a use-
ful starting point. You don’t have to 
take my word for it; just ask President 
Trump, who took the podium yesterday 
afternoon and called the Senate Repub-
lican proposal ‘‘semi-irrelevant.’’ At 
this point, I am beginning to wonder 
who does support the Republican pro-
posal on COVID–19. 
So here is where we are. We need to 
turn the page on the Republican pro-
posal—and 
quickly. 
The 
legislative 
train wreck by Senate Republicans 
cannot derail our efforts to provide ur-
gent, comprehensive, and necessary re-
lief to the American people. 
Speaker PELOSI and I have started 
negotiating with Chief of Staff Mead-
ows and Secretary Mnuchin. We want 
to work with our Republican col-
leagues and the White House on a bill 
that actually meets the needs of the 
American people in these unprece-
dented times, but it is going to take 
good faith and compromise. We are not 
hearing that from Leader MCCONNELL. 
Leader MCCONNELL is already draw-
ing lines in the sand, insisting that any 
agreements include his specific cor-
porate immunity provision—no nego-
tiation. Put this provision—extreme 
provision—in the bill without negotia-
tion. That sure doesn’t sound like 
someone who wants to reach a bipar-
tisan agreement. We are going to need 
everyone to pull together. We are going 
to need to focus on the needs of the 
American people. 
With all due respect to the Repub-
lican leader, Americans on the brink of 
eviction are not crying out for a sweep-
ing corporate liability shield. No one 
should be willing to torpedo all the re-
lief Americans are counting on unless 
there is a giant corporate giveaway at-
tached. 
Time is short. Speaker PELOSI and I 
will be back at the negotiating table 
with the White House later today. It is 
time for our Republican colleagues to 
roll up their sleeves and get serious as 
well. 
One final point on this subject. Again 
this morning, the Republican leader 
continued his ‘‘Alice in Wonderland’’ 
interpretation of what has happened. 
When what has happened is black, he 
says white. When what has happened is 
white, he says black. He is totally the 
opposite of the truth on what has hap-
pened. 
He has suggested that Democrats 
might be trying to block progress on 
COVID relief because it might suit our 
party in the election, that we Demo-
crats had decided to stop legislating 
until 
November—I 
mean, 
shocking 
stuff. 
Over 10 weeks ago, Democrats— 
Democrats—passed a bill three times 
the size of the Republican proposal 
that was more generous and beneficial 
to the American people on nearly every 
measure. Leader MCCONNELL dismissed 
it. Senate Democrats spent the entire 
month of June asking our Republican 
colleagues, including Leader MCCON-
NELL, to pass crucial legislation related 
to jobs, healthcare, and small business. 
We went on the floor and made those 
requests. Republicans blocked every 
single one—nearly every single one of 
those requests. So this absurd, nasty 
insinuation by the Republican leader 
doesn’t pass the laugh test. 
The fact that Leader MCCONNELL 
would even consider the idea that a po-
litical party might deny support for 
the American people in order to help 
win an election says more about the 
Republican leader than anybody else. 
NLRB NOMINATIONS 
On another matter, today the Senate 
will vote on two nominations to the 
NLRB—the National Labor Relations 
Board—one nominee from the Repub-
lican side and another from the Demo-
cratic side. On bipartisan boards and 
commissions like the NLRB, this used 
to be the tradition. The President’s 
party always enjoys a majority on 
these boards, but it is crucial for the 
opposite party, whoever it is at the 
time, to have their recommendations 
approved to these bipartisan boards. 
Unfortunately, the vote comes today 
after more than 2 years during which 
the Republican majority refused to 
even schedule a vote on a Democratic 
nominee to the NLRB, Mark Pearce. 
The Republicans waited so long that 
both Democratic nominees who were 
already on the NLRB had their terms 
expire. 
While Democrats look forward to 
confirming Lauren McGarity McFerran 
to the NLRB later today, we are still 
frustrated that the Republican major-
ity denied any Democratic representa-
tion on the Board for too long, and 
they continue to deny a vote on the 
second Democratic seat. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I in-
tend to talk about section 230 here in 
just a moment. I just want to react to 
what the Democratic leader said and 
also make some observations generally 
about where I think we are with re-
spect to a coronavirus relief bill. 
The Democratic leader indicated that 
the Republican bill wasn’t a serious 
bill. Frankly, I think it could be ar-
gued that the bill he has endorsed, 
passed by the House of Representa-
tives, was not a serious bill. It was 
about $3.5 trillion, which would make 
it about $1 trillion larger than the mas-
sive coronavirus relief bill we passed 
unanimously in the Senate back in 
March. That bill, at the time, for a lot 
of people, represented something un-
like anything they had ever seen be-
fore, both in terms of scale and scope, 
the expanse of all the issues that it ad-
dressed. I think in many respects it 
was a bill that most Members believed 
at the time that we needed to get as 
much assistance out there as quickly

July 29, 2020 
as we could, and as a consequence of 
that, there was broad support for that. 
We are at a different point now, obvi-
ously, several months later, and have 
some perspective that enables us to 
look at what might be effective, what 
has worked, and what hasn’t worked. 
We have gotten a lot of input from 
State and community leaders, from 
businesses, 
schools, 
hospitals, 
and 
healthcare providers who have been im-
pacted by the virus, and have been able 
to respond to what has already been 
done by the Congress in terms of as-
sistance. 
So I think at this point, as we look at 
what the greatest needs are, it is pret-
ty clear that we have to do something 
to provide safety net assistance for 
those who have lost jobs in the form of 
unemployment insurance. I think there 
is a commitment on both sides to ad-
dress that. 
I would argue that the proposal ad-
vanced by the Democrats, which would 
just be a continuation of the existing 
program, is not one that I think most 
people across this country think is 
wise policy, and certainly to the degree 
that it provides an incentive for people 
to stay home and not go back to work, 
it does provide a disincentive to work. 
I think that is something this legis-
lation ought to address, and that is 
pretty much a widely held view, not 
just by Republicans but by Democrats. 
There are Democrats here in the Sen-
ate, Democrats in the House, and 
Democratic Governors who have said 
that the existing unemployment ben-
efit needs to be modified, needs to be 
reformed, needs to be revised. 
The question has been raised: What 
level? It strikes me, at least, that we 
ought not be putting a benefit out 
there that exceeds the amount that 
people would make if they were actu-
ally working, because what that essen-
tially says is that those who are work-
ing, those who stayed in the workforce 
are basically paying benefits to those 
who did not, when, in fact, if there 
weren’t a benefit that exceeded the 
amount that they made when they 
were working, they might get back in 
the workforce if those jobs become 
available 
again. 
That 
is 
certainly 
something we want to incentivize. 
So I would hope that in any deal that 
is struck where we address unemploy-
ment insurance, we can come up with a 
solution that does tailor it to the need 
of the moment, and that is to get peo-
ple back to work. We want to have 
policies that create jobs. That is some-
thing I think ought to be first and fore-
most in this bill. 
We have indicated that this ought to 
be about kids, getting them back to 
school in the fall. It ought to be about 
healthcare, about coming up with 
therapeutics and more testing, better 
testing. It ought to be about ulti-
mately, hopefully, getting a vaccine 
and in the meantime making sure that 
we are addressing the needs of our pro-
viders, those doctors and nurses and 
nursing home caregivers who are on 
the frontlines. 
So those are the priorities that I 
think ought to be in this bill. It seems 
to me there is plenty of room for bipar-
tisan cooperation, and it will take 
that. It also strikes me that this sug-
gestion that you have to do more dol-
lar-wise isn’t always necessarily a 
sound approach. In fact, I would argue 
that anything we do right now ought to 
be targeted. It ought to be focused on 
those who have needs. If it is assist-
ance to State and local governments, if 
it is assistance to small businesses that 
are out there creating jobs—anything 
that we do at this point ought to be 
based and predicated upon where the 
needs are, and we ought to have ac-
countability for the funds that are 
going out there. 
My impression from the bill passed 
by the House Democrats and supported 
by many Senate Democrats here is 
that the more we spend, the better it 
is. I don’t think the American people 
subscribe to that view. I think they re-
alize, like I do, that we are operating 
in an environment where we have a $26 
trillion debt, and we have already 
added this year, because of the first 
coronavirus bill, about another $3 tril-
lion to that debt and increased our 
debt to GDP ratio up over 100 percent, 
which is pretty dangerous territory if 
you look at any relevant metric in his-
tory. 
So I would argue that the approach 
that we take right now ought to be fo-
cused, it ought to be targeted, it ought 
to be measured, and it ought to be di-
rected to those who really have needs— 
by that, I mean people who are unem-
ployed—through unemployment insur-
ance. It ought to be small businesses 
that are trying to keep their employees 
employed and trying to get back and 
going again and creating jobs. It ought 
to be healthcare providers who are 
dealing with the frontline crisis and 
also the heavy investment we need to 
make in the ultimate solution, which 
will be the vaccine, and, of course, in 
terms of the fall, getting kids back to 
school. That entails a whole lot more 
testing. Those are all things that are 
included in the bill that was put for-
ward by Republicans. 
Most of the Democratic objections to 
that bill are that it doesn’t spend 
enough, that it is just not generous 
enough. Well, again, I think we have to 
be very, very careful, very thoughtful 
and aware and conscience of the fact 
that we are operating at a time when 
we have $26 trillion in debt, where 
every dollar we spend is a borrowed 
dollar, and we need to be effective, sur-
gical, targeted, and wise about how we 
spend the American people’s hard- 
earned tax dollars. 
I am hopeful these discussions will 
lead to a solution. We knew right away 
that there wasn’t going to be unani-
mous support for this. It is not like the 
last time around, and I have said all 
along that I wouldn’t expect every Re-
publican to support the bill that came 
out and was released a couple of days 
ago. I think it is a starting point. 
I hope the Democrats will negotiate 
in good faith and not simply try to 
raise the ante because they have a bill 
that has already passed the House at 
$3.5 trillion. That, to me—not to men-
tion the size of it but also the compo-
nents of it—was a very irresponsible 
bill. That is not a serious bill. And the 
fact that it mentions the word ‘‘can-
nabis’’ more times than it mentions 
the word ‘‘jobs’’ I think gives you all 
you need to know about how serious 
that effort was. 
But there is a place that we can land 
that addresses those critical elements 
that I mentioned, and I hope that, not-
withstanding the rhetoric we are hear-
ing from the Democratic leader, the 
Democrats will enter into good-faith 
discussions and play a constructive 
role in trying to come up with a bipar-
tisan solution to the challenges we face 
because of an unprecedented and his-
toric pandemic. 
PACT ACT AND SECTION 230 
Madam President, yesterday in my 
role as head of the Commerce Sub-
committee on Communications, Tech-
nology, Innovation, and the Internet, I 
led a hearing looking at proposed re-
forms of section 230 of the Communica-
tions Decency Act. 
So what is section 230? Section 230 
provides internet sites that host user- 
generated content—sites like YouTube 
or Twitter or Facebook—with immu-
nity for the content users post on their 
sites. So, for example, if somebody 
uploads a YouTube video with defama-
tory content, YouTube isn’t held re-
sponsible for that content. 
It is not fair to say that section 230 
has enabled the internet as we know it. 
Without section 230 protections, many 
of the sites we rely on for social con-
nection or news or entertainment 
would never have come into being. If a 
solo blogger, for example, could be held 
responsible for monitoring each and 
every comment on his or her site, no 
matter how many hundreds or thou-
sands there are, it is unlikely blogging 
would ever have taken off. If YouTube 
were responsible for the content of 
every one of the millions of videos on 
its site, it is unlikely that YouTube 
would have grown the way that it has. 
There is a reason that user-generated 
sites like Twitter and Facebook are 
U.S. companies and not, for example, 
European companies. That is because 
other countries do not offer the liabil-
ity protections of section 230. 
But section 230 was written in the in-
fancy of the internet, long before sites 
like Twitter and Facebook were cre-
ated. As we have seen the internet 
grow, we have come to realize that 
there are also some changes that need 
to be made. 
For example, while I support the 
principle that sites should not be held 
responsible for everything users gen-
erate, there is a difference between an 
inappropriate video a site misses and a 
site that knowingly allows itself to be 
used for criminal purposes. 
In 2018, after it became obvious that 
certain sites were knowingly allowing

themselves to be used by child traf-
fickers and predators, Congress passed 
a law to hold these and other sites re-
sponsible for enabling child sex traf-
ficking. 
As the previous chairman of the Sen-
ate Commerce Committee and current 
chairman 
of 
the 
Commerce 
Sub-
committee on Communications, Tech-
nology, Innovation, and the Internet, I 
have been focusing on internet issues 
related to user-generated content sites 
for the past couple of years. I have 
chaired several hearings on the topic, 
including a hearing on terrorist con-
tent 
on 
sites 
like 
Twitter 
and 
Facebook and a hearing on the opaque 
algorithms that these sites use to filter 
the content that users see. 
At the end of June, Senator SCHATZ 
and I introduced legislation, the Plat-
form Accountability and Consumer 
Transparency Act, or the PACT Act, to 
address some of the issues surrounding 
section 230 and user-generated content 
sites. 
Our bill would preserve the benefits 
of section 230, like the internet growth 
and widespread dissemination of free 
speech it has enabled, while increasing 
accountability and consumer trans-
parency. One reason section 230 has be-
come so controversial is that internet 
platforms have cultivated the notion 
that they are merely providing the 
technology for people to communicate 
and share their thoughts and ideas. 
But the reality is somewhat dif-
ferent. The truth is that websites have 
a strong incentive to exercise control 
over the content each of us sees, be-
cause if they can present us with con-
tent that will keep us engaged, we will 
stay on that site longer. Today, sites 
like Facebook and Twitter make use of 
sophisticated content moderation tool, 
algorithms, and recommendation en-
gines to shape the content we see on 
these platforms. 
Moderation can certainly improve 
the user experience. Most of us would 
prefer that YouTube suggest videos 
that match our interest rather than 
something completely unrelated. The 
problem is that content moderation 
has been and largely continues to be a 
black box, with consumers having lit-
tle or no idea how the information they 
see has been shaped by the sites they 
are visiting. The PACT Act would ad-
dress this problem by increasing trans-
parency around the content modera-
tion process. 
It would require internet platforms 
like Facebook and Twitter to submit 
quarterly reports to the Federal Trade 
Commission outlining the material 
they have removed from their sites or 
chosen to deemphasize—for example, 
posts they have chosen to mostly ex-
clude from users’ feeds. 
Sites would also be required to pro-
vide an easily digestible disclosure of 
their content moderation practices for 
users and, importantly, they would be 
required to explain their decisions to 
remove material to consumers. Until 
relatively recently, sites like Facebook 
and Twitter would remove a user’s post 
without explanation and without an 
appeals process. Even as platforms 
start to shape up their act with regard 
to transparency and due process, it is 
still hard for users to get good informa-
tion about how content is moderated. 
Under the PACT Act, if a site chooses 
to remove your post, it has to tell you 
why it decided to remove your post and 
explain how your post violated the 
site’s terms of use. The PACT Act 
would also require sites to create an 
appeals process, so that if Facebook re-
moves one of your posts, it would not 
only have to tell you why, but it would 
have to tell you a way to appeal that 
decision. To some extent, some plat-
forms like Facebook are already start-
ing to do this, but by no means are 
they all doing so. 
The PACT Act would preserve com-
panies’ 230 protections for material 
posted on their sites, but it would re-
quire companies to remove material 
that has been adjudicated as illegal by 
a court. Large sites like Facebook and 
Twitter would be required to remove il-
legal content within 24 hours, while 
smaller sites would be given additional 
time. Failure to remove illegal mate-
rial would result in the site’s losing its 
230 protections for that content or ac-
tivity, a provision that matches a re-
cent recommendation made by the De-
partment of Justice for section 230 re-
form. 
Finally, in addition to promoting 
transparency and accountability, the 
PACT Act also contains measures to 
strengthen the government’s ability to 
protect consumers. As the Department 
of 
Justice 
has 
noted 
in 
its 
rec-
ommendations to reform section 230, 
broad section 230 immunity can pose 
challenges for Federal agencies in civil 
enforcement matters. 
It is questionable whether section 230 
was intended to allow companies to in-
voke section 230 immunity against the 
Federal Government acting to protect 
American consumers in the civil en-
forcement context. This contributes to 
the creation of a different set of rules 
for enforcing consumer protections 
against online companies, compared to 
those in the offline world. 
I am grateful to Senator SCHATZ for 
his work on this bill, and I am proud of 
what we put together. We both have 
done a lot of work on these issues, and 
this bill is a serious bipartisan solution 
to some of the problems that have aris-
en around section 230. Our hearing yes-
terday, which included one of the origi-
nal authors of the section 230 provi-
sion, former Representative Chris Cox, 
confirmed that the PACT Act would go 
a long way toward making our user- 
generated internet sites more account-
able to consumers. 
I look forward to working with Sen-
ator SCHATZ to advance our legislation 
in the Senate, and I hope that we will 
see a vote on our bill in the near fu-
ture. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Illinois. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, to 
date, America has lost nearly 150,000 
people who have died with diseases re-
lated to coronavirus. We are quickly 
approaching 5 million cases of infec-
tions in the United States of America. 
Consider this for a moment. The 
United States has 5 percent of the 
world’s population. Yet we have almost 
25 percent of all the COVID infections 
in the world. How did we reach this 
point that we have such a rampant rate 
of infection in what is considered one 
of the most developed nations on 
Earth? 
Part of the problem is the President, 
who peddles worthless medical advice, 
and part of the problem is that the Re-
publican Senate has been unwilling to 
face the economic hardships which 
have been created by this pandemic on 
our economy. 
It was 101⁄2 weeks ago that the House 
of Representatives, under Democratic 
control of Speaker PELOSI, passed the 
Heroes Act. That was 101⁄2 weeks ago. 
They knew this day was coming—when 
the unemployment benefits that we put 
in the original legislation would ex-
pire, as they will this week, and the 
help for those who are renting to meet 
their obligations would expire, as it did 
last week. So 101⁄2 weeks ago, Speaker 
PELOSI put on the table her proposal to 
deal with America after these things 
occurred. 
Today, on the floor of the Senate, 
Senator MCCONNELL, the Republican 
leader, called her efforts ‘‘a looney ide-
ological fantasy’’—‘‘a looney ideolog-
ical fantasy.’’ The obvious question to 
Senator MCCONNELL, who is the leader 
of the majority here in the U.S. Sen-
ate, is, Where have you been for the 
last 101⁄2 weeks? Where is the Repub-
lican alternative, the Republican sub-
stitute? Why have we not seen that 
come forward and a real negotiation 
take place between the House and the 
Senate? 
For 
the 
longest 
time, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL told us that he just did not 
feel ‘‘a sense of urgency’’ to take up 
this matter. He did not feel a sense of 
urgency. Well, history was made in the 
Senate Chamber this last Monday, be-
cause Senator MCCONNELL came to the 
floor and used the word ‘‘urgent.’’ Fi-
nally, urgency is stirring in his loins, 
and he announced this week a Repub-
lican alternative—but not quite. What 
he announced was a series of bills to be 
introduced by the Republican side—a 
series of bills. We are just days away 
from the situation where these issues 
are expiring, such as unemployment as-
sistance, and yet, in this circumstance, 
we are dealing with the problem where 
we do not have alternatives from the 
Republican side. Well, we have some. 
One was addressed this morning, when 
it came to unemployment assistance. 
Understand 
what 
happened 
last 
March 26 when we passed the CARES 
Act. This bill passed 96 to nothing in 
the Senate Chamber—unanimous, bi-
partisan. But when we sat down to es-
tablish the amount of money to be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4558 
July 29, 2020 
given to unemployed workers in Amer-
ica, we ran into a problem—one we 
didn’t anticipate. The Secretary of 
Labor in the Trump administration, 
Secretary Scalia, came to us and sat 
down at the table and said: You have a 
lot of interesting formulas when it 
comes to unemployment compensation, 
but just remember the reality. The re-
ality is that 50 different States have 50 
different computer systems, some of 
which are very modern and up to speed 
and others which are ancient and not 
up to speed. When you start coming up 
with complex Federal formulas for 
sending money to unemployed workers 
in these States, you are going to run 
into 50 different reactions. And that is 
exactly what we faced. 
So the alternative was simple. We ei-
ther gave a flat-dollar amount in the 
unemployment benefit supplement or 
we just wondered what the States 
might do with any other formula. So 
the decision was made—with the White 
House, with the Republicans—for the 
$600 a week Federal supplement to un-
employment. There was argument on 
the floor that some workers may come 
out ahead if that happens. Well, un-
doubtedly that might be the case, be-
cause the Federal supplement was in 
addition to whatever a person qualified 
for in State unemployment, and each 
State has a different formula for State 
unemployment assistance, and each 
worker has a different work experience 
and salary experience. But we went for-
ward, believing we needed to do some-
thing dramatic and significant for the 
economy and the first place to start 
was with unemployed workers. Econo-
mists will state that when you are fac-
ing a recession, when there is a lack of 
consumer demand, the first dollar you 
want to hand out as a government is to 
an unemployed worker. You know they 
are going to spend it. They have to 
spend it to pay the rent or the mort-
gage, to pay the utility bills, to put 
food on the table, clothes on the kids, 
and to pay for health insurance. So we 
put money into the economy, and it 
worked. We managed to slow the de-
cline of the economy, even though we 
see more unemployment still coming 
around. It would have been much worse 
if we hadn’t made this commitment 
and invested in unemployment bene-
fits. 
So now, with the expiration of this 
Federal unemployment benefit pro-
gram on July 31, just a few days away, 
the question is, What will we replace it 
with? 
Democrats proposed in the Heroes 
Act in the House that we extend the 
current program to the end of this 
year. That is certainly a direct way to 
deal with this and one that would pro-
vide continuing assistance to these 
families. 
The Republicans have come up with a 
much different approach. What they 
suggested is that we take the $600-a- 
week Federal supplement and reduce it 
to $200 a week, and then by October 1, 
we require the States to implement a 
program that would give the unem-
ployed workers 70 percent of their last 
wage. They obviously ignored what 
Secretary Scalia told us just a few 
months ago, and that is that the States 
would run into a terrible challenge try-
ing to meet this new Republican stand-
ard of 70 percent of your last paycheck. 
We were told we couldn’t do that back 
in March. 
Has the landscape changed so much 
when it comes to State computer sys-
tems? I doubt it. I doubt it very much. 
In Illinois we have a good system, but 
it has been dramatically overwhelmed 
by the Federal supplemental payment 
and the new pandemic unemployment 
insurance and other provisions that we 
passed in Washington. So to think that 
we could move to a new formula in Illi-
nois while meeting our current obliga-
tions is very difficult in our State, 
which is more modern than some. 
Having said that, though, Repub-
licans have argued that if by October 1 
you can’t provide 70 percent by formula 
to the unemployed workers, I suppose 
they will go back to the $200 a week. 
So what is behind this? What is at 
the heart of this? Well, there are sev-
eral things that I think need to be 
noted on the floor. Here is the assump-
tion. Listen to this. You have heard it 
over and over, and we heard it again 
this morning—the assumption that has 
been made by the Republicans in their 
approach to unemployment insurance. 
They assume that if people are re-
ceiving $600 a week in a Federal supple-
ment to unemployment, that they are 
going to refuse to go back to work, 
even when offered a job. They are mak-
ing more money to stay home than 
they did on the job; at least, that is 
what has been repeated over and over 
again. 
This morning, I would like to put in 
the RECORD an article from the Yale 
News. This Yale study, which was just 
released this week, says: The Yale 
study finds expanded jobless benefits 
did not reduce employment. This is ex-
actly the opposite of what we have 
heard over and over again from the Re-
publican side. 
This report from Yale economists 
said as follows: 
[It found] that workers receiving larger in-
creases in unemployment benefits experi-
enced very similar gains in employment by 
early May relative to workers with less-gen-
erous benefit increases. People with more 
generously expanded benefits also resumed 
working at a similar or slightly quicker rate 
than others did, according to the report. 
The data do not show a relationship be-
tween benefit generosity and employment 
paths after the CARES Act, which could be 
due to the collapse of labor demand during 
the COVID–19 crisis. 
Put in simple terms, there aren’t 
that many jobs out there looking for 
workers, and as it turns out, some un-
employed workers have gone back to 
work, even though they might make 
slightly less than they did under unem-
ployment. Why? The reason is obvious. 
Unemployment is a temporary benefit. 
Unemployment may not be as good and 
generous as what a person has in the 
workplace when you count the benefits 
that come with some jobs. Ultimately, 
many workers who are unemployed 
today want to get back to work. 
We should not assume, as some poli-
ticians do, that if a person is unem-
ployed, they must be lazy. With 30 mil-
lion unemployed Americans, that is 
hardly the case, and certainly when it 
comes to whether or not people have 
the incentive to go back to work, I be-
lieve most Americans do want to work. 
The notion that we have to change the 
whole system for fear that some might 
not is definitely unfair. 
Let me just say this, as we move for-
ward with this. I see a colleague on the 
floor seeking recognition in a few min-
utes. As we move forward with this at-
tempt to deal with the economy, we 
have to face the reality, and the reality 
is, as made clear by the Chairman of 
the Federal Reserve, that if we take 
our foot off the accelerator right now, 
we are going to plunge it over the cliff 
in a deeper economic mess than we are 
in today. 
They are trying, by every means in 
monetary policy and the interest rates, 
to enliven this economy and create an 
environment where it may reopen soon. 
I hope that happens. But if we take the 
Republican approach, a little bit of this 
and a little bit of that, it is not going 
to work. We are going to find ourselves 
with a recession that is even worse. 
And for those deficit hawks, how 
badly do you think our deficit will look 
if we face an even deeper recession? It 
is going to get worse and dramatically 
so. Shouldn’t our first obligation be to 
the workers across America who have 
lost their jobs so they can keep their 
families together? This notion of cut-
ting the Federal benefit from $600 a 
week to $200 a week, I can guarantee 
you, will mean much more traffic and 
activity at the food pantries around 
America as these unemployed families 
try to keep things together. 
Then there is a proposal from the Re-
publican side for a three-martini lunch 
Federal tax break. A three-martini 
lunch—is that the way out of our eco-
nomic morass? And at the same time 
they are encouraging the three-martini 
lunch Federal tax break, they will not 
give any additional assistance to those 
who are receiving SNAP benefits— 
those low-income Americans who are 
needing some help just to feed their 
families. It seems that things are up-
side down. 
The last point I will make is this. 
Senator MCCONNELL has said repeat-
edly for months: Nothing is going to 
happen in the Senate—nothing—to help 
anybody in America, unless he gets his 
wish to give immunity to American 
corporations from coronavirus law-
suits. 
Finally, we get to see his proposal. It 
was released this week. I want to tell 
you, it is the most dramatic tort re-
form proposal I have seen since I have 
served in the U.S. Senate. It basically 
takes away the rights of workers, as

well as those who are customers of 
businesses, from recovering under a 
coronavirus lawsuit. It lowers the 
standard of care that is required of 
businesses to a level which basically 
will not protect Americans who face 
this pandemic across the country. At 
the same time, it is providing assist-
ance and relief, it is, unfortunately, 
creating an environment where some 
businesses—some, unfortunately—will 
not be as careful as they should be in 
the way they conduct their businesses 
with customers and their employees. 
We know that we face a challenge here 
with this pandemic, but giving this 
kind of corporate break when it comes 
to immunity and liability only will 
make things more dangerous for cus-
tomers 
and 
employees 
across 
the 
United States of America. 
Let me say a word about what has 
been said on the floor over and over 
again by Senator CORNYN and Senator 
MCCONNELL—the so-called tsunami of 
lawsuits, the epidemic of frivolous law-
suits, the trial lawyers on parade to 
the courthouse because of this pan-
demic. Well, we have checked every 
lawsuit filed in the United States this 
year 
that 
mentions 
the 
word 
‘‘coronavirus’’ or ‘‘COVID–19.’’ Do you 
know how many COVID medical mal-
practice cases have been filed so far 
this calendar year with this so-called 
tsunami of lawsuits? Six. Six. And how 
many consumer personal injury cases 
have been filed this year mentioning 
‘‘COVID–19’’ or ‘‘coronavirus,’’ this epi-
demic, this flood of lawsuits? There are 
15 across the entire United States of 
America. It is an imaginary problem 
that they are creating at this point. We 
can deal with it, and 28 States have al-
ready by changing their State laws, 
but giving immunity to corporations 
from coronavirus lawsuits will not 
make us safer, will not make the work-
place safer for workers, or the business 
safer for customers. 
If we are going to restore consumer 
confidence, everybody has to pull to-
gether. We ought to have standards es-
tablished by the CDC based on public 
health and not politics. And busi-
nesses—conscientious businesses, I am 
sure, will follow those standards be-
cause they do care. Currently, we don’t 
have these standards, and this effort 
will make it even less likely that we 
will. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Yale News article 
dated July 27, 2020 be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the YaleNews, July 27, 2020] 
YALE STUDY FINDS EXPANDED JOBLESS 
BENEFITS DID NOT REDUCE EMPLOYMENT 
(By Mike Cummings) 
A new report by Yale economists finds no 
evidence that the enhanced jobless benefits 
Congress authorized in March in response to 
the COVID–19 pandemic reduced employ-
ment. 
The report (PDF) (https://tobin.yale.edu/ 
sites/default/files/files/C–19% 
20Articles/ 
CARES-UI identification vF(1).pdf) addresses 
concerns that the more generous unemploy-
ment benefits, which provide $600 per week 
above state unemployment insurance pay-
ments, would disincentivize work. 
The researchers assessed this claim using 
weekly 
data 
from 
Homebase 
(https:// 
joinhomebase.com/), a company that pro-
vides scheduling and timesheet software to 
small businesses throughout the United 
States. The findings suggest that, in the ag-
gregate, the expanded benefits neither en-
couraged layoffs during the pandemic’s onset 
nor deterred people from returning to work 
once businesses began reopening. 
The enhanced unemployment benefits were 
initiated under the CARES Act, a $2.2 tril-
lion economic stimulus package enacted on 
March 
27 
that 
attempted 
to 
ease 
the 
pandemic’s severe economic consequences. 
The expanded benefits, which are set to ex-
pire July 31, provide a $600 weekly payment 
in addition to any state unemployment in-
surance. The supplemental payment was de-
signed to cover 100% of the average U.S. 
wage when combined with existing unem-
ployment benefits. The generosity of an indi-
vidual’s unemployment benefits depends on 
several factors, including their earnings his-
tory and their state’s schedule of benefits. 
The report found that workers receiving 
larger increases in unemployment benefits 
experienced very similar gains in employ-
ment by early May relative to workers with 
less-generous benefit increases. People with 
more generously expanded benefits also re-
sumed working at a similar or slightly 
quicker rate than others did, according to 
the report. 
‘‘The data do not show a relationship be-
tween benefit generosity and employment 
paths after the CARES Act, which could be 
due to the collapse of labor demand during 
the COVID–19 crisis,’’ said Joseph Altonji 
(https://economics.yale.edu/people/faculty/jo-
seph-altonji), the Thomas DeWitt Cuyler 
Professor of Economics in the Faculty of 
Arts and Sciences, and a co-author of the re-
port. 
Critics argued that the expanded benefits, 
which exceeded many people’s normal week-
ly wages, would incentivize businesses to lay 
off workers to cut costs and disincentivize 
recipients from returning to work. If the en-
hanced benefits had these effects, the re-
searchers said, the data should show a sig-
nificant drop in employment in the week 
after the CARES Act took effect; it should 
also show subsequent decreases in relative 
employment as workers with more generous 
unemployment benefits put off returning to 
work. The data did not yield results that 
support these predictions. 
The researchers found no evidence that re-
cipients of more generous benefits were less 
likely to return to work. They also found 
that workers who received larger increases 
in their unemployment benefits relative to 
their wages did not experience greater de-
clines in employment after the CARES Act 
was enacted. 
The Homebase data primarily covers small 
businesses that require time clocks for day- 
to-day operations. The majority are res-
taurants, bars, or retail operations. The 
workers represented in the dataset are hour-
ly employees who earn relatively low wages. 
While the data does not represent the entire 
U.S. labor market, it captures a segment of 
it that has been disproportionately affected 
by the pandemic, the researchers noted. 
The analysis controlled for the severity of 
the COVID–19 pandemic and for the various 
restrictions that states imposed on busi-
nesses during the public health crisis. The 
researchers tested their results against em-
ployment outcomes in the federal govern-
ment’s Current Population Survey, a more 
representative sample of the labor market 
than the Homebase data, and obtained simi-
lar findings. But they stress that their re-
sults pertain to the current pandemic period 
of slack labor demand and do not speak di-
rectly to the effects of unemployment bene-
fits on employment during normal times.

Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from Pennsyl-
vania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this 
morning to cover a couple of topics. 
One is on some comments on the legis-
lation that I hope we are going to com-
plete to provide relief to the Nation 
with regard to both the public health 
crisis and the jobs crisis, and then I 
will have two other sets of remarks in 
different parts of the RECORD, but let 
me start with what we are facing right 
now. 
We know that it has been 4 months 
since the CARES Act, way back at the 
end of March, and we all expected, I 
think at that time, that that piece of 
legislation and the legislation prior 
thereto and subsequently would have 
an impact on Americans, we hoped, in 
a positive way. I think there is some 
evidence to indicate that the CARES 
Act had a positive impact. Obviously, 
it was not perfect legislation, but I 
don’t think any of us thought that was 
the end of the road. 
And then we saw, just 10 weeks ago, 
the Heroes Act pass the House of Rep-
resentatives. So you have the CARES 
Act enacted into law and operative— 
and thank goodness for that—as well as 
several other pieces of legislation. But 
the Heroes Act only passed by the 
House and no action by the Senate in 
those intervening 10 weeks. 
If you were on the majority side of 
the aisle, the Republican side, as Lead-
er MCCONNELL has outlined, and you 
wanted to delay—wait to see the full 
impact of the CARES Act—there is an 
argument that some would make in 
that direction. I don’t agree with it. 
But what I don’t understand is why, 
even if you believe that you should 
wait, why would you not be preparing 
for the worst? Why would you not be 
preparing for the kind of outbreaks we 
have seen across the country when the

virus moved away from the Northeast, 
generally, to the South and Southwest, 
and then to the West even more so? 
Why would you not prepare at least an 
outline of legislation? Why would you 
not begin negotiations many, many 
weeks ago, as opposed to waiting until 
the last minute not just to respond to 
the overall problem—the worst public 
health challenge in a century—but 
also, in a particular way, why would 
you wait, as the majority did, until the 
very last minute on the issue of unem-
ployment insurance when we know 
benefits are running out in a matter of 
hours, really, not even a few days now? 
So if that is your perspective that we 
should have waited, why wouldn’t you 
prepare for the worst so that when the 
worst was hitting, or something com-
parable to that, you would have legis-
lation ready to go? 
The majority chose to delay, and I 
think, in a real sense, seemed to adopt 
the President’s kind of virus denial 
that if you just don’t talk about it or 
if you try to change the subject or, in 
the case of the majority, if you don’t 
legislate about it or prepare—just pre-
pare to legislate about it, it will some-
how recede into the background, and 
we don’t have to worry about it. Well, 
that delay and that denial has proved 
to be, I think, misguided, and I think 
that is being charitable. 
So we are faced with a number of 
challenges at the same time as we face 
a public health and jobs crisis. I will 
start with nursing homes and long- 
term care and the very related issue of 
home- and community-based services. 
We know that in long-term care set-
tings, most of those settings being 
nursing homes, the Nation has endured 
more than 59,000 deaths. That number 
may have hit 60,000, but we know that 
it is more than 59,000 deaths. So more 
than 40 percent of all the deaths in the 
United States of America, which is now 
about to reach 151,000, I think, from 
what we saw this morning—more than 
40 percent of those are in long-term 
care settings and most of them in nurs-
ing homes. This isn’t theoretical to 
people out there. This isn’t theoretical 
to families across my home State of 
Pennsylvania or a lot of other States 
where, in many States, 60 percent or 
more of all the deaths were in long- 
term care settings. The deaths are, of 
course, 
residents 
of 
those 
nursing 
homes, in addition to workers. 
So when you combine resident deaths 
and worker deaths, you get more than 
59,000. We have to ask ourselves as 
Americans: Is that just going to be ac-
ceptable? Are we going to stand here 3 
months from now or 4 months or 6 
months from now and say: Wow, it is 
really tragic, all these deaths, and an-
other 59,000 people died in long-term 
care settings, mostly nursing homes? Is 
that the America we want? Is that the 
America we are going to settle for? 
And, oh, I know, I can hear the argu-
ment: Oh, you know, it is a terrible 
virus. It is. It is a virus that hits the 
very old in disproportionately higher 
numbers, and if you happen to be an 
older citizen and you have all kinds of 
chronic conditions or other health 
issues that might compromise your im-
mune system or otherwise, you are es-
pecially susceptible. 
So some would argue: Well, this is 
just going to happen. But we know ex-
actly how to get the numbers down— 
the case numbers down and the death 
numbers. Is it perfect? No. Can we get 
the 59,000 to zero? Of course not. No one 
would argue that. But the idea that the 
United States of America, in addition 
to not responding effectively to the 
onset of the virus itself—I am just 
talking about a subset or a part of the 
tragedy, and that is the tragedy in our 
nursing homes, both for residents and 
their families and for workers and 
their families. 
We know exactly what works, and I 
have a bill that would substantially re-
duce the deaths and the cases. What is 
it? Well, first of all, it is important to 
know the number—3768. That is the 
bill. I hope that my bill will be in-
cluded wholly, or in substantial fash-
ion, in the next bill. S. 3768, what does 
it do? It allocates $20 billion. 
Now, we have heard numbers that 
this next piece of legislation might hit 
$1 trillion or more, and I think that is 
likely. We should ask ourselves: Can’t 
we set aside $20 billion of that, a frac-
tion of that trillion dollar-plus or more 
bill that we will pass, we hope? Can’t 
we set aside a fraction of that for older 
citizens and their families and the 
workers who take care of them? These 
are Americans who fought our wars. 
They worked in our factories. They 
built the strongest middle class the 
world has ever seen over the course of 
the last 75 or so years. These are people 
who were inventors and innovators. 
These are people who made America 
what it is today. They are our fathers 
and our mothers, our grandmothers 
and grandfathers. They gave us life and 
love. The least we could do is make an 
American effort to get the death num-
bers down and the case numbers down. 
Anyone who says we can’t do that is 
defeatist and I think invoking an anti- 
American spirit. We know how to do 
this. 
What will the $20 billion go for? It is 
simple but could be profound in its im-
pact. 
No. 1, we know that one practice in a 
nursing home that reduces the number 
of cases of people contracting the virus 
and the death number is cohorting. 
What does that mean? Separating—sep-
arating those with the virus in the 
nursing home from those who don’t 
have it. Nursing homes that did that 
were successful in getting their num-
bers down. They did it early, way back 
in early March—maybe even earlier in 
some cases—and it worked. It has been 
implemented in a number of States. 
But that has a cost to it. You might 
have to build out, and you might have 
to retrofit. 
You also need extra dollars for per-
sonal 
protective 
equipment. 
There 
should be no question that in the 
United States of America, every nurs-
ing home has every piece of personal 
protective equipment it needs. PPE is 
lifesaving—lifesaving for the resident 
to be guarded from contracting the 
virus and essential for the workers as 
well. 
What else do we need the money for? 
If you have a problem in a nursing 
home with an outbreak, we ought to be 
able to surge expertise from other set-
tings. That nursing home might need 
more doctors in that crisis or that out-
break. It might need more nurses or 
certified nurses assistants or other per-
sonnel. We should have the dollars at 
the State level to serve those profes-
sions. We also need more money for 
testing in nursing homes—vitally im-
portant. 
I think families across the country 
expect us to directly address this. Un-
fortunately, the Republican bill pro-
posed the other day does not do that, 
does not invest, as my bill would. 
Here is a headline from just this 
week, July 24, in the New York Times. 
I will not read the story, but the head-
line is ‘‘FEMA Sends Faulty Protective 
Gear 
to 
Nursing 
Homes 
Battling 
Virus’’—faulty protective gear. We are 
months into this, and we have FEMA 
sending faulty protective gear. Here 
are the first lines of the story: 
Expired surgical masks. Isolation gowns 
that resemble oversize trash bags. Extra- 
small gloves that are all but useless for the 
typical health worker’s hands. 
It goes on and on. I don’t have time 
to read it all today. But that article 
and so many other documented reports 
indicate that these facilities don’t have 
the protective gear they need. 
The second issue is unemployment 
insurance. We are told that the major-
ity, in their proposal, wants to cut the 
$600 per week down to $200. Do the 
math—cutting it by $400 a week. This 
is at a time when we are told that since 
February, the United States has lost 15 
million jobs. My recollection is that in 
the great recession of around a decade 
ago—between the fall of 2008 and some-
time in the spring of 2009, roughly— 
about half a million jobs were lost. We 
have already lost, basically, double 
that—15 million jobs. We were told: Oh, 
don’t worry. April is going to be a bad 
month, and May and June are going to 
be a lot better. That unemployment 
rate is just going to roll down from 
there. 
I was hoping that would be the case, 
but in Pennsylvania, in April, 1 million 
were unemployed. What was May? For-
tunately, it went down—849,000. I ex-
pected June in our State to be a lot 
lower than 849,000. Maybe it would go 
down by 100,000 or 150,000; I hoped even 
more. But, unfortunately, it went from 
849,000 to about 821,000—821,000 people 
out of work in Pennsylvania in the 
month of June. 
We still have a jobs crisis that will 
endure for a good while yet and, there-
fore, an unemployment crisis. The 
worst time to cut those benefits, those 
extra benefits, would be right now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4561 
July 29, 2020 
I know we have heard the argument 
that if you continue this, you are cre-
ating a disincentive to work. That is 
what we are told. According to the 
Washington 
Center 
for 
Equitable 
Growth, in a report this month—just a 
couple of days ago—they found: ‘‘Lack 
of opportunities to work, not a dis-
incentive to work, are keeping unem-
ployment elevated.’’ That is what they 
found. They documented more than 
that statement would entail, but that 
is what they found in their research. 
They also found 23 percent fewer job 
openings in July of 2020 versus July of 
2019. So there were fewer job openings. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the 
Department of Labor said that there 
are almost four unemployed in the 
United States for every job opening. 
The third issue, State and local fund-
ing: The Republican proposal has noth-
ing to help States and local govern-
ments. We know that State and local 
governments have to balance their 
budgets, so extra dollars can come only 
from one source—the Federal Govern-
ment. State and local governments 
have had to spend more to protect 
their citizens with the onset of the 
virus, the COVID–19 disease, and the 
impact of the virus and the pandemic 
blew a hole in their budgets. 
So what is going to happen? A State, 
whether it is a red State or blue State 
or whatever the political conditions— 
they are all the same when it comes to 
revenue loss. Here is what is going to 
happen, as sure as night follows day: 
They are going to have to cut edu-
cation. So I would say to school dis-
tricts: Get ready for cuts because if 
your State cannot balance its budget, 
there are going to be education cuts. 
There will be cuts to healthcare, 
probably Medicaid in most instances, 
and there will be other cuts. Public 
transit—we were on a call last night 
with transit advocates from around 
Pennsylvania, and our side is asking 
for more help for transit. But you can 
go down a long list, whether it is edu-
cation or healthcare or even public 
safety itself at the local level. 
So we should do a lot more. We 
should be replicating or at least ap-
proximating what the House did when 
they allocated $875 billion for State 
and local governments combined. 
How about the Supplement Nutrition 
and Assistance Program? The majority 
has refused over and over again—cat-
egorically refused—to increase SNAP 
by the percentage that our side has ar-
gued for. I know it is a little easy in 
Washington to talk about hunger and 
food insecurity as some kind of distant 
issue because those of us who serve in 
this Chamber are not food insure. We 
don’t have to suffer the pain of hunger 
that many families are suffering. Many 
suffered food insecurity long before the 
pandemic, but many others—even mid-
dle-class families or people trying to 
get to the middle class—are suffering 
from food insecurity because of the 
virus and the economic downturn. 
Families, we know, are literally choos-
ing between the food they need for 
their families or paying the mortgage, 
choosing between the food they need— 
groceries—versus paying for their kids’ 
medications. 
The last issue in this part of my re-
marks is on Medicaid. We know that 
the Senate did the right thing in the 
Families First legislation way back in 
early March when it increased the 
matching dollars for Medicaid by 6.2 
percent. Those matching dollars are 
vital for States to be able to pay for 
Medicaid and to be able to balance 
their budgets. The House bill, the He-
roes Act, passed 10 weeks ago, I believe, 
set forth another increase of a higher 
amount—14 percent—for those match-
ing dollars. I think that makes a lot of 
sense, especially when people are los-
ing their jobs every day. 
We just read a story in the New York 
Times last week, I think it was. More 
than 5 million people in the country 
have lost their health insurance be-
cause they lost their jobs or for other 
reasons. So a lot of those folks who are 
out 
of 
luck 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
healthcare itself are turning to Med-
icaid. We should increase the matching 
rate to 14 percent. 
The Republican proposal has no addi-
tional dollars for Medicaid. I guess we 
should not be surprised because the 
White House budget proposals in the 
last several years—and I think sup-
ported in large measure by the Repub-
lican majority here in the Senate— 
have not only not wanted to increase 
dollars for Medicaid, but, in fact, the 
White House has proposed cuts of sev-
eral hundred billion dollars to Med-
icaid over a 10-year timeframe several 
years in a row. Republicans in the Sen-
ate have said very little, if anything, 
against those kinds of proposals. 
Let me just move to a separate set of 
remarks. 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. President, I have some remarks 
about U.S. Representative John Lewis, 
whose casket just left in a hearse from 
the grounds of the Capitol this morn-
ing. It was moving to see the number of 
people who would stand in line for a 
long period of time in 97- or 99-degree 
heat to pass by his casket. 
There is so much we could say about 
John Lewis. It is difficult to summa-
rize or encapsulate or not repeat our-
selves, but I think in so many ways 
John Lewis was courage personified. 
Very, very few Americans—other than 
those who served in combat itself or in 
other instances—could say that they 
have put themselves on the line as he 
did with his courage in the face of ha-
tred and in the face of brutal beatings 
and otherwise. 
John Lewis helped the United States 
in its ongoing work to form a more per-
fect union. There is so much more we 
could say about that. He was beaten on 
multiple occasions for standing up for 
civil rights and, of course, the right to 
vote itself. He did all of this—all of 
this—by practicing nonviolence. I don’t 
know how he did that. I really don’t. I 
would like to be able to think that I 
could do that in the face of beatings, 
but I don’t think I could. I really doubt 
that I could and that most people 
could. But he practiced nonviolence 
and thereby had a huge impact on the 
American people and American law. 
He served 33 years here in the U.S. 
House of Representatives. He also 
served on the Atlanta City Council. 
When President Obama was bestowing 
the Medal of Freedom on John Lewis, 
he said that John Lewis was ‘‘the con-
science of the U.S. Congress.’’ It was so 
well said. 
I think, at a time like this, we are 
summoned by his enduring example. 
We are summoned by his heroic exam-
ple to pass the voting rights bill, H.R. 
4, which has been basically sitting here 
since December, when the House passed 
it. That is the best way to demonstrate 
our gratitude for John Lewis’s con-
tributions. 
The fight against injustice must con-
tinue. We can’t just say what a great 
man he was or what a great leader he 
was; we have to continue to be inspired 
by and act against injustice whether it 
is in housing or food insecurity or edu-
cation or employment or healthcare or 
otherwise. 
Martin Luther King said one time, 
‘‘Until justice rolls down like waters 
and 
righteousness 
like 
a 
mighty 
stream.’’ John Lewis’s life was in fur-
therance of that goal—to bring about a 
world where justice rolls down like 
waters and righteousness like a mighty 
stream. 
I think John Lewis was a patriot in 
the broadest sense of the word. We 
know from the song ‘‘America the 
Beautiful,’’ that wonderful line, ‘‘O 
beautiful for patriot dream that sees 
beyond the years,’’ that the dream of a 
patriot, when they are fighting on a 
battlefield, is not just about the fight 
they are in; the dream of a patriot, of 
course, is about what happens after, 
that their sacrifice brings about a bet-
ter world, a more secure country in the 
context of a war or a battle. 
John Lewis also had the dream of a 
patriot, the dream of a better life for 
Americans, the dream of equal protec-
tion under the law, the dream of voting 
rights being protected. In the largest 
sense of the word, John Lewis was a pa-
triot. 
I am almost done. I know I might be 
overtime, and I know we have a col-
league waiting. I will be brief. I apolo-
gize for going a little long. 
We know that there has been a lot of 
debate about what happened when we 
had reports in the New York Times and 
other reports, in June, about the U.S. 
intelligence community learning that 
Russian intelligence had offered pay-
ments as high as $100,000, transferred 
through a middleman, to kill U.S. serv-
icemembers in Afghanistan. 
I know that we don’t have time to 
get into all the details of that today, 
but we know that the President has, I 
think, on the record, not said anything 
about this until maybe yesterday in an

interview, and in my judgment, he did 
not address and did not respond appro-
priately to those reports. 
I was hoping what the President 
would say in the interview that I saw 
on television this morning—I guess it 
was yesterday—and what he would 
have said long before that is that we 
are going to investigate this and we are 
going to make a determination about 
the conclusion that we reach—that he 
would reach as President and that he 
would directly confront Vladimir Putin 
and challenge him on this. But he had 
a recent phone call with him, and all 
the reporting indicates and even the 
President indicated in his interview 
that he did not challenge Vladimir 
Putin. That is beyond disturbing, and I 
think it is not in furtherance of our na-
tional security interests. 
In the interest of time today, I will 
not say more because I know we are 
over time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to complete my 
remarks prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it 
is interesting to hear my colleagues 
talk about China and COVID and our 
response. I think many of us looked at 
2019 and felt like that was really a sig-
nificant year for U.S.-China relations. 
It marked the 40th anniversary of bi-
lateral diplomatic relations between 
Washington and Beijing, and we also fi-
nalized a phase 1 trade deal. 
This led many of us to being opti-
mistic, but remember that 2019 also 
marked the 70th anniversary of Chair-
man Mao’s ascension to the chairman-
ship of the Chinese Communist Party 
and the 30th anniversary of the mas-
sacre at Tiananmen Square. 
When you start asking questions 
about that history and how it has in-
formed the decisions of current Chinese 
leadership, the capitalist facade that 
has been so carefully constructed by 
the propagandists in Beijing starts to 
peel away, and it starts to crack. 
After decades of espionage, military 
aggression, and horrific political vio-
lence inflicted on their own people, 
many here in Washington have grown 
numb to Chinese hostility. They kind 
of expect or accept that is the way 
they are going to act. That is the only 
explanation I could come up with for 
the shock that rippled through this 
town when we discovered that the Chi-
nese Communist Party spent 51 days 
muzzling the doctors, lawyers, and 
journalists who desperately tried to 
warn the rest of the world about the 
growing 
threat 
from 
the 
novel 
coronavirus. 
Our relationship with China has 
reached a tipping point. We will never 
be able to go back to what had been 
that cautious optimism that we had in 
2019. 
Fortunately, it looks like both my 
colleagues here in Washington and 
many of our allies are allowing them-
selves to process the threat posed by 
Beijing’s standard operating proce-
dures. The UK has banned the use of 
equipment from Chinese tech giant 
Huawei for their ongoing 5G rollout, 
and France has implemented policies 
that restrict the use of Huawei’s prod-
ucts. These decisions are giving some 
hope to the people I am talking to back 
in Tennessee every single day. They 
are happy to see that allies are fol-
lowing in our footsteps. This is a good 
thing. It is an opportunity for us to 
role-model how you work to unravel a 
relationship with an aggressor. 
They would also want me to tell you 
that 
they 
appreciate 
the 
Senate’s 
growing bipartisan support for legisla-
tion like my SAMC Act, which will se-
cure our pharmaceutical supply chains 
from Chinese interference, and Senator 
MCSALLY’s Civil Justice for Victims of 
COVID Act, which will allow Ameri-
cans harmed by this pandemic to sue 
the Chinese Communist Party officials 
in U.S. court. 
But we all know that there is no sin-
gle-shot bill we can use to decouple 
from China and put control back in the 
hands of American businesses, edu-
cators, institutions, and innovators. 
We have to begin to unravel these ties 
with China. Now, there are a lot of peo-
ple in this town who think that this is 
impossible, and they will say: Oh, that 
is ill-advised. You do not want to try 
to unravel from China. 
I think they are wrong, and I think 
that we can and we must do this. But 
lipservice is not going to cut it. Over 
the past few months we have talked at 
length about what needs to be done, 
but, with few exceptions, we are light 
on specifics. So last Wednesday I pub-
lished a white paper laying out the cur-
rent state of affairs between the United 
States and China and talked about 
what got us to this position. Then, I 
have 120 specific policy recommenda-
tions that Congress can use as a basis 
for future legislation, whether it is 
trade or agriculture or telecommuni-
cations or 5G or our military complex. 
I would like to use my remaining time 
to lay out a few of these recommenda-
tions as a place to start. 
By now most Americans are at least 
familiar with the term ‘‘Belt and Road 
Initiative.’’ This is an initiative pro-
gram the Chinese have used to buy 
their way. They have bought their way 
into the good graces of governments in 
Asia, Africa, and Europe. The trillions 
of dollars in investment buys inroads 
and influence across countries of every 
economic background and in organiza-
tions like the United Nations. 
While we cannot and should not com-
pete dollar for dollar, we should part-
ner with our allies to prevent strug-
gling governments from falling into 
this debt diplomacy or these debt 
traps. We must also secure our supply 
chains across every sector of our econ-
omy and bring critical manufacturing 
and technologies back to the United 
States. 
I mentioned the SAMC Act. It would 
incentivize companies to bring their 
manufacturing operations back to the 
United States and also fund partner-
ships between pharmaceutical compa-
nies and universities so that they can 
train the workforce we need in order to 
pull this manufacturing out of China 
and bring it back to communities right 
here. 
We should not hesitate in moving for-
ward on this legislation. Once we in-
vest in this new technology and infra-
structure, we are going to have to in-
vest in securing it by securing our 
emerging 5G networks. To that end, we 
need to make more spectrum available 
for the commercial wireless sector to 
ensure our continued leadership in 5G 
and other emerging technologies. If we 
fail to do so, we risk ceding ground to 
China in the standard-setting bodies 
that are going to define 5G internation-
ally. 
We will not be able to stop China 
alone. We must look toward those 
international organizations, as well as 
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, 
to help us deter Chinese aggression and 
foster stable economic growth. This in-
cludes providing support for Hong Kong 
and Taiwan and promoting universal 
human rights standards, both in China 
and across the globe. We will also in-
crease defense investment in the region 
through a newly created Pacific Deter-
rence Initiative. 
Most importantly, we must accept 
the fact that, at its core, China is not 
a normal country. It does not behave 
like 
a 
normal 
country. 
When 
Xi 
Jinping ascended to the head of the 
Chinese Communist Party in 2012, 
many assumed he was going to act as a 
reformer and turn away from the 
Maoist thought, but, predictably, he 
did not. 
We cannot simply wait for this prob-
lem to go away. Last week, Beijing es-
calated tensions by ordering Americans 
to vacate our only consulate in western 
China, distancing its abuses in Tibet 
and Xinjiang from American diplo-
matic personnel. You know what. It is 
not going to stop with this. They are 
accelerating their aggression. 
We have to become more independent 
of China. We are too dependent on 
them at this point. It is time for the 
United States to deny this era of Chi-
nese impunity and change the way we 
are doing business. It is time to rees-
tablish rules to guide the global econ-
omy, to encourage our allies to join us, 
and to hold Beijing accountable. 
I yield the floor.

CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise to address the impact that the 
coronavirus pandemic is having on 
rural America. 
We know that it affects every area of 
this country. In the urban areas of our 
country, we have seen what this has 
meant to the people who are in crowd-
ed housing and to the people who work 
every day in our urban hospitals. We 
have seen it in the suburban areas with 
small businesses and with moms who 
are trying to figure out how to handle 
the summer with their kids, but the 
rural areas sometimes don’t get as 
much attention. The Presiding Officer 
knows of this in his home State of 
Oklahoma. He understands this. 
There are a lot of rural areas in our 
country that have suffered as well. 
They have suffered not only because of 
spikes in the virus, like we have seen 
recently, but also because of the eco-
nomic implications—a farm economy 
that was already in trouble because of 
the price of commodities, because of 
world trade barriers, because of weath-
er events. You name it. It has affected 
rural areas in a big, big way. 
According to several recent reports, 
as of July 14, one-third of all rural 
counties are now considered red zones, 
places that in the last week of testing 
added 100 or more new cases per 100,000 
people. Between June 13 and July 12, 
the number of new cases in rural coun-
ties increased by 150 percent. That is 
why we must take immediate action to 
provide the critical support that the 
rural areas need. 
They are areas that may not have 
easy access to hospitals or that may 
have smaller hospitals. That is why the 
issue of funding for State and local 
governments, as long as we make sure 
the rural areas are able to share in this 
funding as well, is so important for the 
rural hospitals, for their equipment— 
all of this. 
This is beyond what we all know al-
ready of the food supply chains and our 
nutrition programs. We certainly don’t 
want a situation in which one can’t get 
homegrown American food. Just as we 
have learned with the medical equip-
ment supply chain, we can’t always get 
the swabs that we need for so much of 
our testing and the like. 
I just want to make clear that people 
sometimes see rural areas as though 
they are out there, doing fine—all of 
these idyllic pictures. I don’t think 
they understand the struggle, the fact 
that rural poverty for kids is often 
higher than it is in urban areas, and 
this was before the pandemic. To me, 
the pandemic has just put a big magni-
fying glass on some of these disparities 
that we knew already existed. 
There is a more senior population in 
rural areas, so you have people trying 
to keep themselves safe. They are iso-
lated in seniors’ homes or in areas of 
smaller assisted living, where they are 
very, very isolated, even more so than 
they might be, but where they have 
their families nearby who can at least 
visit them through a window. That is 
even harder. So, really, all of these 
challenges conspire to make this a 
topic that we must discuss. 
The operation of public hospitals, 
long-term care facilities, and first re-
sponder services during a public health 
crisis requires a significant mobiliza-
tion of resources, and this relief pack-
age that I am pleased we are debating 
now—I would like to see more move-
ment, but at least the negotiations are 
ongoing—must include the funding for 
rural area hospitals as well as for State 
and local governments. Local govern-
ments in rural areas are facing both 
falling revenues and increased emer-
gency expenses. They have smaller 
margins under which they operate, 
which threatens their ability to pro-
vide essential public services and their 
ability to continue paying teachers and 
first responders. 
The public health crisis is putting in-
credible pressure on our public health 
system, and many rural hospitals and 
health systems already have limited 
ICU beds and resources. The dispropor-
tionately low number of healthcare 
providers across rural America has 
been brought into sharp focus by this 
crisis. We have already heard stories of 
the hospitals that were once delivering 
babies but that lost one OB/GYN doctor 
and could no longer deliver babies. 
Then the family has to go miles and 
miles and hours and hours just to have 
the delivery of a baby in a safe situa-
tion. That is why we need to do much. 
It is the funding. 
There is a bill that Senator GRASS-
LEY and I have that will actually allow 
some of the smaller hospitals—this was 
prepandemic—to exist in different cir-
cumstances, like emergency room cir-
cumstances, so they don’t entirely 
close down. It is why I have led the re-
authorization of the Conrad 30 Waiver 
Program, which has brought in over 
15,000 immigrant doctors to fill the 
gaps. We also know there are issues of 
personnel in these hospitals—nurses 
and doctors. This is a program that al-
lows for immigrant students who have

gotten degrees from American medical 
schools to be able to serve out their 
residencies in underserved areas in 
America, which sometimes means in 
urban areas that don’t have enough 
personnel and which, lots of times, 
means in rural areas. That is why, in 
fact, the initial author of this bill was 
Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota. 
It is because of the problem North Da-
kota had. 
As I have traveled through the coun-
try in the last year, I have continued 
to hear about all of the problems we 
have in our VA hospitals and the like. 
They want to have these physicians 
who have been trained in America and 
have degrees from America to stay and 
not have to go back to their home 
countries when, in fact, they want to 
stay in America. 
Helping rural hospitals also means 
ensuring they have vital protective 
equipment, like masks, gowns, and 
gloves; and medical supplies, like ven-
tilators. 
That is why I have urged the admin-
istration to deliver supplies from the 
Strategic National Stockpile and to 
protect consumers’ access to medical 
and hygiene products. 
It also means delivering additional 
resources for testing and for contact 
tracing, like the $75 billion that the 
House passed in the Heroes Act, and it 
means expanding telehealth services, 
which my bill with Senators Casey and 
Capito—the ACCESS Act—would do. 
I recently had the experience of my 
own dad, at age 92, with coronavirus. 
He ended up at age 92 surviving it, with 
just having lost 10 pounds and a very 
poor appetite, but he came out of it as 
strong as he went into it. But I didn’t 
know that was going to happen, and I 
will never forget that moment of our 
family standing outside the window be-
cause, of course, we couldn’t go in. We 
are standing out there en masse while 
he is in his room—or in a room that 
they had given him, because he got 
coronavirus—and they put the tele-
phone on so that he can hear us on 
speaker phone, but he cannot figure 
out what is going on. He doesn’t really 
understand, with his disease, why we 
are wearing the masks and we can’t 
even hold his hand. And you don’t 
know if that is the last time you are 
going to see your loved one at that mo-
ment. As it turned out, it had a happy 
ending for him, and he is doing fine, 
but not for everyone else that was in 
his home. 
That is why these services, where 
maybe he could see us on a big TV, in-
stead of maybe on the little iPhone 
when we do FaceTime, would make 
such a difference, not just to people in 
his situation who are in a small as-
sisted living, with the need of services, 
but if people are there because they 
wanted to have a living situation 
where they could hang out with their 
friends and play bridge and the like. 
We are going to have to think of those 
senior facilities and the access we can 
give not only to doctors to consult 
with patients, but also for them to be 
able to see their families. 
This means broadband. That is why I 
introduced the Accessible, Affordable 
Internet for All Act—comprehensive 
broadband legislation led by Represent-
ative JIM CLYBURN of South Carolina. I 
was honored that he asked me to carry 
this bill in the Senate. It would invest 
$100 
billion 
to 
build 
high-speed 
broadband 
infrastructure 
in 
under-
served areas. Underserved areas, a lot 
of times, as he knows from his State of 
South Carolina, include a lot of rural 
areas and rural farmers. In his case, 
there are so many African-American 
communities that are underserved by 
broadband, and it would make a big dif-
ference all over the country. 
Senator CRAMER of North Dakota and 
I introduced the Keeping Critical Con-
nections Act, which, again, is another 
way of focusing on low-income and on 
rural areas to help our small broadband 
providers who, in my experience, have 
tended to really put their money where 
their mouth is and actually build out 
in these areas so that people get high- 
speed broadband. 
Our bill now has 34 cosponsors—half 
Democrats, half Republicans—and I 
keep working to ensure that students 
in low-income families, regardless of 
their ZIP Code, are connected. 
I don’t want to hear another story 
like I heard of the high school student 
who had to take her biology exam in 
the liquor store parking lot in town be-
cause she didn’t have high-speed ac-
cess; or the doctor who can, yes, see 
the x rays at his rural hospital, but if 
he wants to do work from home, as so 
many of us are doing in the pandemic, 
he has to go to the McDonald’s parking 
lot to be able to view these x rays. 
Iceland can do this. They have volca-
noes. They are covered at times in ash, 
and they have been able to get high- 
speed internet to every person in their 
country. We should be able to do the 
same. 
Farmers. I spent the morning on a 
number of Zoom calls with our farmers 
in Minnesota—our soybean farmers and 
others—and I have to say that they are 
in hard times right now. They are in 
hard times because, as I said, before 
this pandemic, we were having prob-
lems. Our food supply chain has been 
hit—from the farmers who grow our 
food, fuel, and fiber, to the workers in 
the processing plants, of which I have 
many in my State. 
I was just in Worthington, MN, which 
is the home of one of biggest food proc-
essing plants that was hit hard by the 
coronavirus. They have put in place 
some better safety measures, and they 
are now operating. 
There are the truckdrivers and barge 
operators, who deliver products to 
stores and export terminals and the 
families who may be struggling to put 
food on the table due to sudden unem-
ployment. 
When many businesses began shut-
ting down in March, commodity fu-
tures prices tumbled, given the lower 
demand for food and fuel. At the begin-
ning of the pandemic, dairy producers 
estimated that milk prices would drop 
by $2.85 billion in 2020. Cattle ranchers 
and hog producers saw the value of 
their livestock drop by 30 to 40 percent, 
and the futures price for corn and soy-
bean fell 10 to 15 percent per bushel. 
These losses occurred as farmers 
were still recovering from weather con-
ditions that delayed or prevented har-
vest last year. Many farmers were 
barely breaking even as it was, and 
they began this spring planting season 
behind, and then they confronted the 
pandemic. 
In March, we passed the CARES Act. 
It was not perfect. We all know that, 
but it provided $23.5 billion in disaster 
assistance for farmers and livestock 
producers impacted by the pandemic. 
The Department of Agriculture began 
making payments in June, and, as of 
yesterday, they had processed over $6.5 
billion in payments to more than 
473,000 producers. 
But there is still money that has 
been unspent. That is $14 billion. In ad-
dition to funding for the next package, 
it must reach producers of all sizes. 
This has been particularly hard in my 
State, waiting for that help. 
The House has already taken action 
to provide additional direct assistance 
for farmers and dairy and livestock 
producers. I met with Representative 
COLLIN PETERSON, who heads up the 
House Ag Committee, this weekend, 
when we were both here, marooned in 
Washington, and went through the 
work that he had done, and I am very 
hopeful that we can do something simi-
lar in our bill here. 
While farmers and livestock pro-
ducers need emergency relief, we also 
must recognize that the pandemic has 
placed a significant strain on workers 
and consumers. We cannot slow the 
spread of the coronavirus when tests 
can take as long as 12 days to provide 
results. 
A friend back in Minnesota, just a 
week ago or so, got a test. He felt sick, 
didn’t want to get his family infected, 
and spent 6 days in the basement not 
being able to see his family, and it 
took that long to find the result. And 
then he found out he didn’t have it. 
Those stories are just as similar but, of 
course, 
much 
more 
fortunate—but 
similar to people who wait when they 
are sick, and they need to know if they 
are sick. And not everyone has a base-
ment to stay in. So the point of this is 
that these delays in testing are very, 
very difficult on our economy. 
That is why, in May, I joined Senator 
DEBBIE STABENOW, the ranking member 
of the Agriculture Committee and my 
Democratic colleague on the Senate 
Agriculture Committee, in introducing 
the Food Supply Protection Act. The 
bill would provide support for food 
banks to upgrade their infrastructure 
to 
handle 
additional 
demands, 
strengthen food partnerships to pre-
vent food waste, and protect workers 
through grants—and here we get to

July 29, 2020 
what I was talking about—for protec-
tive equipment, test kits, and cleaning 
supplies. 
Also, last week, I joined Senator 
JERRY MORAN of Kansas in introducing 
the Requiring Assistance to Meat Proc-
essors for Upgrading Plants Act, or the 
RAMP-UP Act, that we are doing to-
gether. 
The closure of meat packing plants 
highlighted the need to provide con-
sumers with more choices and farmers 
with more flexibility when marketing 
their livestock. 
Our bill would help small and me-
dium-size meat packers make improve-
ments to their facilities so they can 
meet the standards necessary for Fed-
eral inspections. This will allow them 
to make sales across State lines and in-
crease market opportunities. 
These two important pieces of legis-
lation—the Stabenow bill I mentioned 
and the one that Senator MORAN and I 
just introduced—should be included in 
the next relief package. 
Another critical component to the 
rural economy is our Nation’s biofuel 
industry. In the first quarter of 2020, 
biofuel processing plants purchased an 
estimated 1.3 billion bushels of corn 
and supported over 350,000 jobs. 
Many of them are based, of course, in 
rural communities. In fact, a lot of our 
farmers own the plants. In fact, a lot of 
our local people depend on these plants 
for one of the major businesses in their 
small towns. 
Even before the pandemic, the misuse 
of small refinery exemptions under the 
renewable fuel standard by the EPA 
had led biofuel plants to shut down. 
I will never forget visiting a biodiesel 
plant in Iowa that had been shut down, 
and there was one worker left. His job 
was to maintain the plant, and he took 
me on a tour of the empty plant and 
then pulled out a coat rack that con-
tained the uniforms of the people—his 
friends—who used to work there. And 
embroidered on the uniforms were the 
names of the workers, with names like 
Bob, Joe, Salvador. A tear goes down 
his cheek, and he said: I kept these uni-
forms. I keep them pressed on this coat 
rack because I hope they will come 
back and work here. 
That was before the pandemic, and 
that is what we have seen because of 
some policies by this administration 
that claim that they wanted to help 
the Midwest but instead granted whole-
sale a bunch of exemptions, not just to 
the refineries. It is in there for a good 
reason—to help struggling refineries— 
but they, literally, granted those ex-
emptions to Exxon, to Chevron, to doz-
ens and dozens and dozens of compa-
nies. And that is before the pandemic. 
That is why Senator GRASSLEY and I 
have taken this on in a big way. These 
losses—this is, again, prepandemic— 
have resulted in over 100 biofuel proc-
essing plants nationwide idling produc-
tion or closing altogether. It is com-
bined, prepandemic and during the pan-
demic. 
That is why in May I introduced leg-
islation with Senator GRASSLEY to sup-
port biofuel producers during the pan-
demic. Our bill involves reimbursement 
for their feed stock or commodity pur-
chases through the first quarter of this 
year. 
It is also why I led a letter with 19 
Senators urging the EPA to deny 52 pe-
titions for waivers that would enable 
more billion-dollar oil companies to re-
ceive small refinery exemptions. 
The approval of these retroactive ex-
emptions at this moment would only 
worsen the unprecedented economic 
challenges facing the biofuel industry. 
Competition is good in America. That 
is why we have the renewable fuel 
standard, because it is a nascent new 
fuel, and it had to really get into that 
market in a big way against Big Oil, 
which gets many more subsidies than 
the biofuels do. And this is not a time 
to go backward and shut down every 
biofuel plant in America, and that is 
where this administration is headed, if 
it keeps up these practices. 
There is much more we must do to 
help our rural communities. I would 
note that one of the emerging issues I 
have heard about a lot in my State is 
these childcare deserts, and that is 
that rural families are seeing unavail-
able 
childcare. 
This 
is, 
again, 
prepandemic. It was a big problem, 
where you would have so many people 
who wanted to work but were unable to 
get childcare to be able to do that 
work. 
That is not just in my State. It is all 
over the country. That is why Senator 
SULLIVAN and I introduced the Child 
Care Workforce and Facilities Act 
prepandemic, which would address the 
national shortage of affordable, quality 
childcare in these rural areas to help 
them 
expand 
their 
childcare 
workforces. 
Right now, the economy is slowly but 
surely starting to reopen, and we know 
that for families who have been at 
home and the parents are still working, 
this has become harder and harder for 
moms and dads to figure out what they 
are going to do about childcare. 
So this should be a time where we 
step back and say: OK, how are we 
going to deal with this, not just with 
the threat moving from the pandemic 
now, today, but the day after tomor-
row? And I mean that as a metaphor 
for next year. How are we going to 
make this work for rural areas? 
And I have gone through everything I 
think we need to do to get there: the 
healthcare, making sure that we have 
healthcare available in rural areas; the 
broadband, making sure that some-
thing we can do is available; the 
childcare deserts; and the ag economy. 
I will say that there is a big argu-
ment for rural America right now, as 
we have seen that people are able, with 
the right connections, to work from 
home, and we need new ideas and new 
startups, and it is actually less expen-
sive to start new companies in the 
rural part of this country, where the 
cost of living is lower. 
We know that there are farmers that 
want to keep farming their small plot 
of land in places like South Carolina 
and in places like Oklahoma and in 
places like Minnesota. But if we just 
allow rampant consolidation in the ag 
industry and the tech industry—where 
there is a hearing going on, as I speak 
right now, over in the House that 
maybe a few more people are watch-
ing—the point of it is this: We have to 
also take on consolidation during this 
pandemic and look at our laws next 
year. And I am not just going to wait 
for a bunch of judges to make decisions 
when they have been going against the 
antitrust laws now at the Supreme 
Court level for years—one loss after an-
other. It just so cries out for a change 
in our antitrust laws. We have adapted 
these laws over the years. 
I will end with one story involving 
that. I was at a small cafe a few years 
ago in Albert Lea, MN. A woman was 
there with her farmer husband and her 
brother-in-law. 
She turned to me and she said: ‘‘I 
just saw you on TV.’’ 
I said: ‘‘Was it about Russia and the 
elections?’’ 
The Presiding Officer and I were 
doing a lot of work at the time nation-
ally on protecting our elections from 
foreign interference. 
I said: ‘‘Was that it?’’ 
She said: ‘‘No. That wasn’t it.’’ She 
said that it was on the local station. It 
was about States. It was about how 
things are getting too big, and it 
makes it hard for us. 
We want to maintain our rural 
spaces. It is not just a romantic vision 
of the past. We want to maintain our 
rural areas for America. It is about 
having food that is ours, having it 
made in America so we are not depend-
ent on foreign foods. It is about having 
our own energy supply, which can be 
varied and vast. It is about having our 
own technology and developing the 
next new idea and the next new iPhone. 
We are not going to be able to do that 
if we shut out a big swath of our coun-
try. That is not going to work. We ac-
tually want to encourage development 
in rural America. That is what I think 
we need to do. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just 75 
days ago today, the Democratic House 
passed the Heroes Act. The Heroes Act 
was a comprehensive and I think very 
bold bill that addressed the very real 
needs that face this country as we 
struggle to contain the coronavirus. 
During the 75 days that passed, we 
Democrats 
pressed 
the 
Republican 
leadership to take up the Heroes Act in 
the Senate, and for 75 days, we have 
been told no. The point was simple:

Bring it up, vote for it or against it, 
amend it if you want, but let’s have 
some real action. 
For 75 days we have watched the 
virus spread. We saw the death toll rise 
as President Trump stood by, denying 
the severity of the crisis, attacking the 
science, and assuring the American 
public that the virus would just go 
away on its own. For 75 days we 
watched as critical deadlines bore down 
on us for programs that offered a life-
line to the American people, including 
the expiration of Federal unemploy-
ment benefits and a moratorium on 
evictions. 
This week, on Monday, after 73 days 
of waiting, Senate Republicans finally 
unveiled their proposals to address the 
coronavirus pandemic, and even some 
Republicans have said it is disjointed 
and in disarray. One has to ask, what 
has been done all this time? 
Instead of one bill, it is a collection 
of eight different pieces of legislation, 
introduced by eight different Members. 
Instead of a cohesive package to ad-
dress the needs of the American people 
and to get the virus under control, 
their proposals prioritize corporations 
over people. They put business inter-
ests ahead of society. 
It is unclear whether the White 
House has blessed this package. It is 
even less clear whether it has the sup-
port of the majority of Republicans in 
this body. One thing that is clear: The 
priorities are completely misplaced. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle seem to think they can fix our 
Nation’s problems by simply forcing a 
reopening of the economy, forcing peo-
ple back into the workplace, and forc-
ing children back to school as if the 
virus isn’t still spreading like wildfire. 
It is a terrible approach and would 
make us less safe. 
Everybody wants to get the economy 
on track. We want schools to reopen, 
and we want to return to the work-
place. But the only way to accomplish 
that is to contain the virus, slow the 
spread. That is the only thing that will 
give people the confidence to emerge 
from their homes and reengage in soci-
ety and our economy. To do that, there 
are certain things we have to do. 
We have to have quick and efficient 
testing and contact tracing. We need a 
vaccine, but we will have to have a way 
to mass-produce that vaccine, once we 
have it, to the people. We need to sup-
port unemployed Americans until we 
get through this crisis. We need to 
keep people from being evicted and los-
ing their homes. We need to create safe 
working environments and safe learn-
ing environments for our children. 
Where children must learn from home 
with parents working from home, we 
need to make investments in the infra-
structure they need to be successful. 
The Republican bill fails on all these 
points. It has insufficient funding for 
testing and contact tracing. It has in-
sufficient funding for a mass-vaccine 
campaign once we have a vaccine. It 
underfunds education programs. It uses 
the money as a stick to force school 
districts to open even if the locality 
and public health agencies say it is not 
safe. It fails to provide much needed in-
vestment in broadband and internet ac-
cess for rural areas to allow for dis-
tance learning where it is needed. 
One teacher said to me: If you force 
us to open, what happens when a week 
after it opens, two children and two 
teachers have COVID–19? The school 
closes down for a period of time. Let’s 
be realistic. 
There is no increase for SNAP bene-
fits even though more people are going 
hungry today in America. There is no 
new funding for State and local govern-
ments that are laying off teachers and 
healthcare workers and first respond-
ers as revenues dry up. 
The Republican proposal inexplicably 
cuts Federal unemployment benefits to 
millions of workers. They insist this 
incentivizes people to go back to work. 
Where are they going to work? Where 
are the jobs? People want to work, but 
jobs are hard to come by. All this does 
is make more people destitute, put peo-
ple more at risk of not being able to 
put food on the table or pay the rent. 
To show why this proposal is a non-
starter, let me share a few stories from 
Vermonters who have written or called 
or come into my office as I have been 
around Vermont this past weekend. 
One man wrote to me because he is 
concerned he will be evicted from his 
home in the next few days. He has been 
out of work since March, only able to 
survive because of the Federal unem-
ployment benefits in the CARES Act, 
which in this bill have been callously 
stripped away. His wife is taking class-
es at the local community college in 
the hopes of one day getting a better 
job. In just a few short days, they could 
face eviction because they can’t afford 
to make their $750 rent payment. In-
stead of inching ever closer to achiev-
ing the American dream, that dream is 
being snatched away through no fault 
of their own. Homelessness is now a 
real possibility for them. 
He writes: 
I hope that you and your fellow Senators 
can find a solution as soon as possible, be-
cause we are all affected by what happens in 
the Capitol. 
He is right. Whatever is done here af-
fects him and his family and all other 
families. What are the solutions being 
proposed? 
Unemployment 
benefits 
slashed, no rental assistance, and the 
expiration of the eviction moratorium. 
When is the last time anyone in this 
room struggled to make rent? Who are 
we to tell this man he does not deserve 
continued help from his government in 
the middle of a pandemic? 
Another voter contacted me over the 
fate of her 98-year-old mother. Since 
March, her mother and the other resi-
dents of her nursing home have been 
confined to their rooms, unable to join 
each other for dinner and unable to 
participate in activities. The nursing 
home staff lack the necessary personal 
protective equipment and testing capa-
bility. She has not been able to even 
hug her own mother since the pan-
demic started. 
She writes: 
We can’t just have a single-state or single- 
country response to this pandemic. We must 
all work together to take action now to sup-
port the most vulnerable members of our so-
ciety. 
I couldn’t agree more. We need to 
work together. We need to protect the 
most vulnerable among us. We need to 
prioritize the most urgent of needs, but 
the Republican proposal doesn’t do 
that. 
Across our country, children are 
going hungry because their parents are 
out of work and the cost of food is on 
the rise. The Republican proposal in-
cludes nothing for SNAP and nothing 
for child nutrition. But there are 
multibillion-dollar giveaways to the 
defense industry. Republicans say they 
want 5 years of immunity for large cor-
porations so they will not be sued if 
they force their workers back to work 
if they get sick, but they have no 
money in there for the protection of 
those workers. They protect the own-
ers of the company who probably don’t 
even come in the company. They pro-
tect them but not the workers in the 
company. 
They take money to replace money 
that the White House basically took 
away to build a wall that Mexico was 
supposed to pay. Then, when I saw this 
in the proposal, here was $1.7 billion for 
an FBI building that was going to be 
built either in Virginia or Maryland— 
$1.7 billion to protect the aging build-
ing and prop it up. Why? Because if it 
were gone, somebody might build a 
hotel there. There would be potential 
competition 
with 
Donald 
Trump’s 
hotel across the street. They are going 
to put $1.7 billion of taxpayers’ money 
in there to protect his hotel from any 
competition, but there is no money in 
it to ensure people can safely vote in 
our upcoming elections. What is going 
on? This is ‘‘Alice in Wonderland.’’ 
In the absence of a President who 
takes this virus seriously or is able to 
lead this country through the crisis, 
the American public needs Congress to 
step up. The Republican proposal fails 
to do this. It leaves people behind and 
our country and our economy even 
more vulnerable. 
Let’s stop playing partisan games 
and offering solutions only one party 
can get behind. Let’s get something we 
can all get behind. Let’s start bipar-
tisan, bicameral negotiations on a bill 
that can be sent to the President by 
the end of next week. Let’s make prior-
ities of those programs that help us 
contain this virus and help us protect 
the vulnerable families like those I 
have seen the past several days in 
Vermont—a bill that puts us on the 
right track to reopening our economy. 
Frankly, the American people can’t 
wait any longer. The Vermonters who 
call and write into my office and stop 
me in the street to talk with me, they 
are pleading for help. They can’t wait

any longer. And to do nothing—to do 
nothing is an abdication of our sworn 
responsibility to serve our constitu-
ents. 
But to advance this patchwork series 
of bills offered by the Republican ma-
jority is worse. It is a disservice to the 
thousands of Americans who have died 
and the millions of Americans who 
have contracted this virus and the hun-
dreds of millions of Americans who are 
looking to their government to do 
something so they can have their coun-
try back. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Virginia. 
(The remarks of Mr. KAINE
per-
taining to the introduction of S. 4349 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. KAINE. With that, I yield the

The legislative clerk proceeded to

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
HEALS ACT 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, 4 
years ago, Jill Larsen opened Crayons 2 
Pencils Early Learning Center in Nor-
walk, 
IA. 
This 
state 
of 
the 
art 
childcare center offers full day, before 
and after school care, and preschool- 
only programs for children from 6 
weeks old to school age. They have 
even expanded to include a learning 
center and recreation center. It truly is 
topnotch. But when COVID–19 hit, 
Crayons 2 Pencils’ enrollment dropped 
from 150 children to 32. And it was only 
through the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram that this childcare center was 
able to stay afloat and keep their 
workers paid. 
Jill Larsen’s story is not unique. 
Without the help of the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, so many of our small 
businesses 
and 
childcare 
programs 
across the country would have gone 
under. Ninety-nine percent of Iowa’s 
businesses are small businesses, and 
the Paycheck Protection Program has 
been a critical lifeline for so many of 
them. 
I hear it time and again on my 99- 
county tour—most recently on a Main 
Street tour in Albia with some out-
standing female small business owners. 
Nearly 60,000 small businesses in Iowa 
have received PPP loans, saving hun-
dreds of thousands of jobs. But, folks, 
there are more funds left in the pro-
gram, and many of these folks need ad-
ditional help. That is why we should 
allow our most distressed businesses to 
receive a second PPP loan—so they can 
continue to keep workers paid and 
their doors open. The HEALS Act 
would make that possible. 
While the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram helped the Crayons 2 Pencils 
daycare center keep their employees 
paid, as folks are getting back to work, 
these critical facilities are facing new 
challenges—making up for losses from 
decreased enrollment, trying to expand 
to accommodate more kiddos due to 
school closures, or acquiring critical 
medical supplies or PPE to create a 
safe and clean environment for these 
families. 
Just recently, I held a telephone 
townhall, and I was joined by Iowa’s di-
rector of health and human services, 
Kelly Garcia. We heard the concerns of 
Iowa parents and talked about the so-
lutions we are working on at the State 
and Federal levels when it comes to 
childcare access and affordability. 
Our working parents are anxious and 
concerned about what lies ahead. Do 
they have to quit their jobs to stay at 
home with the kids? How much will 
childcare 
cost? 
What 
happens 
if 
childcare providers can’t open back up? 
This is the reality for so many. That 
is why I made it a top priority to pro-
vide 
additional 
resources 
for 
our 
childcare programs and our families. 
Included in the HEALS Act is my bill 
to 
create 
back-to-work 
childcare 
grants, which would give providers the 
resources they need to make it through 
this crisis. It would also help them ac-
cess PPE and other medical supplies so 
they can adhere to the safety guide-
lines and provide a clean and safe envi-
ronment. 
But it doesn’t stop there. I am also 
working to assist our lower income 
families, those who rely on the child 
care and development block grants and 
those who simply need access to clean 
diapers. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, I was in 
Davenport, IA, where I got to take part 
in a diaper distribution with the Hiney 
Heroes of the Quad Cities—yes, Hiney 
Heroes. As a result of this visit, the 
folks over at Huggies and the National 
Diaper Bank donated 25,000 diapers to 
this important diaper bank. We know 
that during this pandemic, the diaper 
supply has run short. I have teamed up 
with Democratic Senator CHRIS MUR-
PHY on this effort to include additional 
assistance for our diaper banks. 
COVID–19 has also created challenges 
for our farmers. These hard-working 
folks are facing new challenges while 
working around the clock to make sure 
Americans have adequate access to 
food and fuel. I was visiting with some 
farmers at the Bloomfield Livestock 
Market in Davis County not long ago, 
and they described these hardships 
firsthand. I hear the same from our 
ethanol and biodiesel producers. That 
is why I helped ensure more aid for our 
farmers and producers, including our 
ethanol producers and so many other 
important commodities in Iowa. 
In 
our 
rural 
communities—like 
Montgomery County, where I live— 
COVID–19 has only amplified existing 
financial pressures on our healthcare 
centers. Most rural hospitals rely on 
services such as elective surgery to 
keep them financially afloat, but be-
cause of the pandemic and the response 
to it, many hospitals have had to can-
cel these elective surgeries as protec-
tive measures due to the pandemic. 
Additionally, the need for PPE and 
other equipment has significantly in-
creased. 
Lower revenue combined with higher 
expenses has made it incredibly dif-
ficult for these rural hospitals to stay 
afloat. We absolutely can’t leave these 
folks behind. We need our hospitals to 
keep their doors open so that quality 
healthcare is accessible to all Iowans, 
whether they live in the big cities like 
Des Moines and Polk County or small 
communities like Red Oak, where I 
live, in Montgomery County. 
As I have toured Iowa over the last 
several weeks, I have also visited with 
many of our essential workers. Our 
nurses, grocery store clerks, truck-
drivers, childcare providers, and so 
many more have been working on the 
frontlines of this pandemic, rising to 
the challenge to care for and protect 
Iowans. That is why I am pushing hard 
to allow these essential workers to 
keep more of their hard-earned dollars 
by suspending Federal income and pay-
roll taxes. These folks deserve a reward 
for their tireless efforts. 
No amount of financial relief will 
make this virus go away, but Congress 
has a role to play in helping families 
get back on their feet, but it is also 
every single one of us doing our part— 
wearing our masks, washing our hands, 
and social distancing as much as pos-
sible. Together, with the help of every 
individual and all levels of govern-
ment, we will get through this. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
talk about the portion of the bill that 
we have made available to our col-
leagues and the country this week 
after lots of input from our colleagues 
on the Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, and Education part of the bill. It 
is about 25 percent of the bill, almost 
$250 billion. That money would be used 
to get us back on track toward vac-
cines that work, toward treatments 
that work, to provide additional re-
sources for testing, for treatment, for 
care, to get us back to school, to get us 
back to work, and to get us back to 
childcare. These are all things that are 
critical for our economy and families 
to return in the way they want to. 
For those things to work the way we 
would want them to work, our col-
league Senator ALEXANDER put it very 
succinctly: All things run through test-
ing. If you are going to go back to 
school, if you are going to go back to 
work, if you are going to go back to 
childcare, if you are going to be in a 
nursing home between now and the 
time we have a vaccine, we need tests 
that are easy to take and quick to re-
spond. A test that you can take and 
have the answer in 10, 12, or 15 minutes

July 29, 2020 
will make all the difference, and we 
continue to push for that in this bill. 
In fact, there is about $9 billion in a 
fund that maybe should have been des-
ignated a little more specifically, but 
it hasn’t been spent. It was designed to 
be a testing fund. We should combine 
that with another $16 billion and make 
testing available for those priorities— 
for nursing homes or in that State-Fed-
eral partnership. 
In this bill, we say that a priority for 
the Federal Government in that part-
nership is tests that work in nursing 
homes, tests that work in childcare 
centers, tests that work in elementary 
and secondary education, and tests 
that work in colleges and universities, 
that allow people to get back into 
those situations, including a residen-
tial campus, to know that when you 
are there, you have a way to not only 
test people quickly but get an answer 
quickly. 
Frankly, President Trump is right 
when he says that the way current 
testing has been working really doesn’t 
do much but measure how many people 
had the disease. It doesn’t even say 
how many people necessarily have the 
disease but how many people had the 
disease. If you have a test and you 
don’t get an answer for 5 or 6 or 7 days, 
what good did it really do you to take 
the test? It certainly didn’t do you 
much good in terms of not infecting 
others because you didn’t know that 
you had it—particularly if you are in 
that high percentage of people who 
don’t have symptoms but are still able 
to spread the disease. 
That is why a test that gives you an 
answer in 15 minutes makes all the dif-
ference in the world. If you are on a 
college campus and take that test and 
in 15 minutes you have the answer, and 
if the answer is that you have this, 
your next place to go is somewhere by 
yourself. 
I think almost every campus return-
ing to residential campus living is set-
ting aside some of their dorm space— 
on some campuses, all their dorm space 
is single-student dorm rooms—but for 
every campus I talked to, some rooms 
are set aside just so the student has a 
place to go. 
If you show up at the nursing home 
as a worker and in 15 minutes you find 
out you have COVID, the last place you 
need to be is that nursing home. But if 
you don’t know for 5 or 7 days whether 
you have COVID, it doesn’t help out 
very much. 
I think what the President has said 
on testing makes a lot of sense. But it 
doesn’t mean the tests aren’t good; it 
means better tests. We have put a lot 
of money and effort behind those tests. 
Sometime in the next few days, I think 
the National Institutes of Health will 
be announcing tests that are moving 
forward that will do just what I sug-
gested. 
We put another $26 billion toward a 
vaccine. Our colleague Senator DAINES 
has been very helpful in looking at this 
organization called BARDA, which was 
designed a decade ago to be able to re-
spond to a pandemic and never has 
been effectively used in that way, in 
my view. This time, we are using it and 
intend to continue to use it to form 
those partnerships with the private 
sector early on to begin to produce a 
vaccine, even when we don’t know ab-
solutely for sure that it is going to be 
FDA-approved. But we do know that if 
it is FDA-approved, we want it as soon 
as it can possibly be available. If it is 
not FDA-approved, it never gets used, 
but if it is FDA-approved, the dif-
ference between a vaccine that is avail-
able January 15 and a vaccine that is 
available May 15—it is worth the loss if 
it doesn’t work out. Let’s say you went 
forward with five of these vaccines, and 
three of them worked. Then you have 
vaccines—maybe 300 million doses on 
January 15, and you have to destroy a 
couple of hundred million doses be-
cause that didn’t get through the full 
safety requirement. That makes all the 
difference in the world. Lives are 
saved, and the economy is restored. 
And we are moving forward with that. 
We are putting another $26 billion be-
hind that. 
We also have language in our bill 
that requires an effort that was an-
nounced yesterday, which is for a 
group of scientific ethicists to start 
talking 
about 
what 
the 
priorities 
should be for that vaccine when we 
have it. Who should get it first? What 
should our priorities be? How do we 
distribute this in a way that seems fair 
and equitable? How do we distribute 
this in a way that somebody who can’t 
get in a car and drive 100 miles to a 
doctor and pay for the shot has the 
same chance to get the vaccine as 
somebody who could do all of those 
things? Our bill requires that. 
All of our discussions on this bill, 
plus our public discussions in a hearing 
we had a month ago, have said we want 
the administration to have a plan as to 
how to distribute the vaccine before we 
have the vaccine. Everybody thinks we 
might have a vaccine available by the 
end of this year or early next year. 
There is no reason to wait for that to 
happen to have a plan. I would like to 
see a plan on October 1. I told the Chief 
of Staff of the President that again 
yesterday. 
This bill provides money to be sure 
that people who go to places like com-
munity health centers are going to 
have a community health center that 
can respond to what they need. There 
is $7.6 billion for community health 
centers. 
There is another $25 billion for pro-
viders that lost income—which is al-
most every provider—during the last 
several months as our hospitals and 
our doctors and our surgical centers 
and other places were told: Here is 
what we want you to do. We want you 
to stop your income. We want you to 
stop all the elective things you can 
possibly stop. At the same time, we 
want you to be ready for the greatest 
healthcare crisis your facility will ever 
meet. 
So fully engaged in spending money 
and being ready to meet a crisis, but 
because you stopped income that you 
would normally have, we are trying to 
do what we can—not to exceed the in-
come they would have normally had 
but to replace some of that income. 
There is also money for rural clinics 
that would step up and do that. 
Senator CAPITO and Senator COLLINS 
were particularly vigorous in making 
sure we had the money needed for peo-
ple who have mental health challenges, 
many of whom have gotten worse dur-
ing this isolation period and this job- 
loss period, or if you or somebody in 
your family is sick. 
The opioid deaths, the substance 
abuse deaths have gone back up for the 
first time in about 3 years. That is to-
tally logical when you think about it. 
Had this headed in another direction, 
you would have a support system work-
ing that keeps you from returning to 
that habit, that dependency. Then you 
are suddenly by yourself. Maybe you 
are not only by yourself, but you are 
by yourself and you lost your job. 
Maybe you are by yourself, and your 
mother is sick with COVID, and you 
can’t see your mom or dad or somebody 
in your family, and you are thinking: I 
wonder—surely I can do that thing that 
made me feel so good just one time and 
not be addicted. We know it doesn’t 
work that way. 
Our Nation continues to face chal-
lenges, and with those challenges, we 
have asked the National Institutes of 
Health to look one more time and more 
closely at people’s underlying condi-
tions that might put them more at risk 
for COVID–19, see what has happened 
with minorities, with pregnant women, 
with children, and begin to drill down 
and figure out what we can do. 
As I have said before, bipartisan pri-
orities should include school. Frankly, 
they also need to include childcare. If 
you are going to get America back to 
work, you are going to have to have a 
childcare system that works, and that 
is not going to happen on its own. 
About half of our childcare facilities 
have been closed since the 1st of 
March. The other half that has been 
open has struggled to stay open. Many 
have benefited from the PPP program, 
but at the same time, when they stay 
open or when others reopen with social 
distancing and the reluctance of people 
to send their kids back to a place 
where there are lots of other kids, 
there is probably no more than 50-per-
cent occupancy. You are not going to 
make up for that by doubling the 
amount that families pay for childcare. 
You need to make up for that with the 
kinds of grants and assistance that are 
in this bill. It is about getting students 
back to school, getting people back to 
work, and getting childcare facilities 
working. 
Senator ERNST, who was just on the 
floor, and Senator LOEFFLER have both 
been big advocates of what we need to 
do to make childcare a priority.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4569 
July 29, 2020 
Schools need to reopen safely based 
on State and local criteria. This bill in-
cludes money for schools to do that. 
There is about $70 billion for elemen-
tary and secondary schools. Frankly, 
we are a little bit ahead of where the 
House was with the Heroes Act. If you 
get into a bidding war with the House, 
you are never going to win. You need a 
realistic discussion. Only 90 days ago 
or so or 60 days ago, the House felt it 
needed $100 billion to reopen schools. 
We suggested $105 billion. In some re-
port, I read that the House then de-
cided, well, maybe it should be $400 bil-
lion if the Senate were willing to spend 
$105 billion. 
We should be able to figure this out 
and figure this out quickly, with some 
of that money being available only if 
you go back to school in person and 
some of it being available if you go 
back to school virtually, as others will 
do, depending, again, on their situa-
tions locally. 
We are ready to move forward. An-
swers to these important questions are 
in this bill. I look forward to talking 
about it not only with our Democratic 
colleagues in the Senate but with our 
colleagues in the House. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to 
discuss the relief that the HEALS Act 
will provide to those in farm country 
and rural America as they weather the 
challenges of COVID–19. 
It is so important, for they are out 
there for us every day, producing that 
food supply. They had incredible chal-
lenges before this COVID–19 started. 
The Presiding Officer is from an ag 
State. He knows the kind of challenges 
we are facing. Obviously, we need to be 
there for them as we go through this 
coronavirus fight. 
I want to start by thanking them. 
They provide us with the lowest cost, 
highest quality food supply in the 
world. Think about it. Every single 
American benefits every single day 
from what our farmers and ranchers do 
with food, fuel, and fiber. Just the food 
piece alone means that Americans have 
the highest quality, lowest cost food 
supply in the history of the world. This 
is thanks to our farmers and ranchers. 
Rarely, if ever, has there been a more 
appropriate time to say thank you to 
the men and women who provide us 
with that food supply, and the resil-
ience of our ag producers, in the face of 
tremendous hardship that has been 
caused by the global health pandemic, 
serves as a real testament to their grit 
and to their determination. 
That is why we have worked to pro-
vide additional support for farmers, 
ranchers, 
and 
processors 
in 
this 
HEALS Act. The legislation includes 
$20 billion in direct appropriation, 
which will be used for our farmers and 
ranchers, along with other funding 
that we were able to secure in the 
CARES Act. We are trying to also do it 
in a cost-effective way. In recognizing 
that we have a debt and deficit we have 
to be mindful of, what we are trying to 
do is to actually utilize funding that 
we put together in the CARES Act for 
the CCC, or the Commodity Credit Cor-
poration. We are taking $14 billion of 
that and combining it with the $20 bil-
lion from this legislation to make sure 
that we have adequate funding—a total 
of about $34 billion—to address the 
needs in farm country. 
Prior to the coronavirus, farmers en-
tered 2020 after 7 years of rural reces-
sion caused by low commodity prices, 
trade disruptions, and some really 
tough weather and natural disasters. 
Yet our farmers and ranchers are the 
eternal optimists—they have to be—so 
they go into every year with that grit 
and determination and continue to pro-
vide that food supply that we all rely 
on. 
Now, of course, you add COVID–19 
into the mix. Storefronts have closed. 
Restaurants 
have 
shuttered 
their 
doors. Processing plants have limited 
and, in some cases, shut down oper-
ations. Of course, ag prices are also 
down. Farmers and ranchers came into 
a tough situation and now face further 
challenges with the pricing and the 
other challenges created by COVID–19, 
as I said. Though it will take some 
time to really quantify those losses, 
the reports we have right now indicate 
that losses in the ag sector could be 
near $42 billion. For example, losses in 
the cattle industry alone could total as 
much as $13 billion. 
We need to be there for them be-
cause, again, they are not only out 
there producing the food; they are 
doing other things to help out as well. 
For example, there are a couple of sto-
ries about our farmer groups that are 
making an effort to help others. 
In May, R.D. Offutt Farms, which is 
one of our Nation’s premier potato 
growers that is based in Fargo, ND, do-
nated 37,000 pounds of frozen potato 
products to the Great Plains Food 
Bank. The North Dakota Stockmen’s 
Association and its foundation donated 
$20,000 to the same food bank to pur-
chase beef from North Dakota ranch-
ers. The North Dakota Farmers Union 
and Farmers Union Enterprises teamed 
up to donate 30,000 pounds of pork ribs 
to the Great Plains Food Bank as well. 
Those types of stories go on. 
So while the farmers and ranchers of 
America are out there, fighting their 
own challenges, they are helping others 
at the same time, and I think that it is 
truly, truly remarkable. 
In the CARES Act, we took the first 
important step by providing $9.5 billion 
to the USDA, the Department of Ag, 
along with the $14 billion, which I just 
referenced, to replenish the CCC. As I 
mentioned earlier, we have utilized 
some of that funding to provide assist-
ance, but now we are going to take 
that additional $14 billion and combine 
it with the funding here of $20 billion 
to make sure we can get that assist-
ance off to the farmers. 
Again, we are working to do this in a 
way that is prudent with our tax-
payers’ dollars in recognizing the chal-
lenges we have with debt and deficit. 
We have to be mindful of it, but at the 
same time, we have to make sure we 
are getting adequate assistance out to 
those 
great 
farmers 
and 
ranchers 
across America who are getting it done 
for all Americans every single day. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise to 
discuss the HEALS Act. 
As we continue to confront this 
coronavirus pandemic, we have to en-
sure that our schools and our employ-
ers can safely reopen. Our healthcare 
providers must also have the resources 
they need to continue to provide essen-
tial care to all Americans to fight this 
virus and to help this Nation return to 
some semblance of normalcy as quick-
ly as possible. We have to also provide 
liability protection for those schools, 
businesses, and healthcare providers 
while they do their very best to oper-
ate safely during this unusual, once-in- 
a-generation, once-in-multiple-genera-
tions pandemic. The HEALS Act will 
help to provide these protections. 
The HEALS Act also includes several 
provisions that I have been cham-
pioning, including legislation to ad-
dress unemployment insurance system 
reform. 
We note that there have been a lot of 
challenges associated with the legacy 
computer systems, and we should never 
ever have to endure this again. 
Financial 
assistance 
to 
help 
childcare providers reopen has also 
been another priority of mine. I recog-
nize that our childcare providers play 
an essential role in not just caring for 
our children and ensuring they remain 
educated and in a safe environment 
when their parents aren’t around but in 
also being critical to our broader econ-
omy. If your kids aren’t taken care of, 
you can’t go to work, and Hoosiers 
want to go to work. 
Finally, we have telehealth legisla-
tion that has been included in this 
HEALS Act that will lead to greater 
affordability and access, especially as 
many of these authorities are made 
permanent in the future. This is a way 
to bend the cost curve down and pro-
vide a higher value for each of those 
healthcare dollars in our moving for-
ward. 
It also includes the TRUST Act, 
which is something that I helped to in-
troduce in order to establish a bipar-
tisan national plan to finally begin 
tackling the long-term drivers of our 
national debt once we get through this 
coronavirus pandemic. I have been 
talking about this and have sometimes 
been criticized for talking about fiscal 
responsibility and the largest drivers of 
our long-term national debt. I am 
unapologetic every time I talk about 
it. This TRUST Act would establish a 
bipartisan national plan to finally 
begin tackling this, and I hope it will 
remain in the package as negotiations 
continue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4570 
July 29, 2020 
Most importantly, I am glad the 
HEALS Act includes some really im-
portant features of my RESTART Act, 
which is a bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion that I introduced with Senator 
BENNET. We now have somewhere north 
of 42, 44 bipartisan cosponsors. We have 
50 national groups—and growing—that 
are supportive of this legislation. It is 
very important that these features re-
main in the HEALS Act. 
Like my RESTART Act, the HEALS 
Act recognizes the need for having 
long-term working capital loans and 
targeting that relief toward businesses 
that have suffered significant revenue 
decline. We don’t want more examples 
of businesses that are doing just fine in 
the wake of the pandemic getting ac-
cess to moneys that, frankly, they 
don’t need. Instead, we want to target 
our resources toward the hardest hit 
businesses that will not survive this 
pandemic. That is what the RESTART 
Act does, and I am proud of those fea-
tures that were included. However, I 
have to say, in order to truly assist the 
hardest hit small- and medium-sized 
enterprises that have fallen through 
the gaps of previous programs, more of 
the RESTART Act is going to have to 
be included throughout this negotia-
tion process. 
Last night, I received a text from a 
longtime friend of mine. Her name is 
Sheila. Sheila is a resident of Dearborn 
County, IN. Gosh, Sheila is an incred-
ibly hard-working person, and she 
texted me the following: 
Todd, I saw you on C–SPAN today. I really 
appreciate how you bring up the Hoosiers. 
When you are writing this next bill, please 
consider small businesses like my husband 
and I have. Pat is the lone legal owner of our 
catering business. We invested all of the rev-
enue made over the few years into our busi-
ness, buying equipment, et cetera. Because 
of this investment, we had an impressive 
schedule of events this past spring, summer, 
and fall lined up. This time of year gives our 
barbecue business our greatest exposure and 
opportunity for financial gain. We were in-
eligible for a PPP loan because we did not 
show a profit. When composing the next 
PPP, please consider single-person business 
owners like our barbecue and catering busi-
ness. God bless you. 
Well, God bless you, Sheila. It is 
hard-working people and couples and 
partnering Americans who help build 
this country. It is innovators and en-
trepreneurs and doers and dreamers 
and workers like Sheila. 
If we don’t provide this much needed 
relief now, I am really concerned that 
we are going to be in a far worse posi-
tion in the weeks and months to come. 
As more businesses close perma-
nently, they go bankrupt; they are no 
longer paying payroll taxes. Then there 
is greater damage done to the economy 
and to our Nation’s balance sheet. 
I am also concerned about our ability 
as a country to fully recover once there 
is a vaccine available. It is our small 
and medium-sized enterprises, which 
you disproportionately find in States 
like Indiana, the heartland of the coun-
try, where so much innovation occurs. 
It is not always in these large busi-
nesses; it is the smaller enterprises 
where the innovation occurs. Then, ul-
timately, it is the big businesses that 
acquire these innovative businesses. 
So we want these engines—these in-
cubators of innovation, these small 
businesses, 
medium-sized 
businesses 
that 
are 
innovative 
and 
entrepre-
neurial—to survive this difficult time. 
They are also pillars, frankly, of 
Main Street, America. We take pride in 
our small businesses, many of which 
have been so hard hit. We don’t want to 
hollow out Main Street America on the 
back end of this. The most fiscally irre-
sponsible thing we could do here at the 
Federal level of government is to fail 
to respond to the needs of these small 
and medium-sized enterprises. 
So the additional assistance that I 
am calling for is critical to, for exam-
ple, the more than 500,000 manufac-
turing employees in the State of Indi-
ana, the most manufacturing-intensive 
State in the country. 
It is also critical to the 200,000 Hoo-
sier restaurant employees laid off or 
furloughed since March. We have been 
able to provide them some short-term 
assistance, but this virus and the chal-
lenges associated with it have lingered 
on much longer than all of us had 
hoped, and we are going to have to help 
out these employers so that they have 
a place to go back to work once we fig-
ure this thing out. 
This assistance is critical to the 
small music venues that enrich our 
local 
communities 
throughout 
the 
State of Indiana and across our coun-
try, which are facing permanent clo-
sure, 
too, 
and 
the 
countless 
res-
taurants, gyms, salons, boutiques, ho-
tels, retailers, and other small busi-
nesses that are essential pillars of our 
community. 
I grew up in a small business family. 
We had our up years; we had our down 
years. We had some rough Christmases. 
My dad, my mom—they took great 
pride in that family business. They 
made it. They worked hard. But they 
saw nothing like this virus. We need to 
help these businesses. These businesses 
are in dire straits not because any bad 
business decisions were made, but, in-
stead, because this virus came from 
overseas, disrupted our lives, and in 
the interest of public health, our em-
ployees had to stay home. People 
stopped buying the same things they 
were buying. Our shopping patterns 
changed. 
At some point we will resume some 
semblance of normalcy. We are getting 
there. But in the meantime, we need a 
bridge to the other side of this virus. 
We need to make sure that all of the 
provisions of the RESTART Act make 
it into the HEALS Act. 
Since Senator BENNET and I intro-
duced the RESTART Act in May, our 
legislation has received support from 
more than 40 bipartisan Senators. I am 
proud of that. There is a lot of hard 
work going on in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to get Members of the 
House to sign up as well. It has also 
been endorsed by roughly 50 national 
organizations and more than 50 Indiana 
businesses, and these are prominent 
national organizations, including, for 
example, the National Association of 
Manufacturers. 
Given the widespread support for the 
RESTART Act, I will continue to work 
with my colleagues to ensure that 
more of it is included in the final 
coronavirus package. I hope we get all 
of it included. We have to ensure that 
we are caring for those who have suf-
fered the most. 
To Sheila and to Pat, you have my 
word—you have my word, as you did 
the first day we met, that I would do 
everything I could to fight for the peo-
ple of Indiana, to fight for what is 
right, to fight tirelessly on behalf of 
my customers—you and the millions of 
Hoosiers I represent—answering only 
to my ultimate bosses: God and the 
Constitution. 
I will fulfill that pledge and continue 
fighting for all of you during this dif-
ficult time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, first of 
all, I want to associate myself with the 
message delivered just a little bit ago 
by my senior Senator from North Da-
kota, Senator HOEVEN, and echo his 
words about the importance of farmers 
and ranchers, all of our agricultural 
producers—those who produce the food 
and the fiber and the fuel for our coun-
try. 
They need assistance, and I am really 
grateful that Senator HOEVEN
has 
played such a lead role in getting them 
assistance in the HEALS Act. It is crit-
ical. 
I want to join the rest of my col-
leagues today in discussing the HEALS 
Act and demonstrating our support for 
the merit of this important bill. The 
ultimate answer to the problems that 
we face as a result of this virus, of 
course, lies in the healthcare industry 
and in our healthcare in fighting 
against this enemy, the virus. That is 
why we are calling for more funding for 
testing 
and 
treatments 
and, 
ulti-
mately, a vaccine, hopefully, and hope-
fully soon. 
As we do so, we also have to make 
sure that our economy is healthy, that 
our economy survives, and that our 
education system remains available 
and accessible to our students in the 
classroom. 
Jobs, kids, and healthcare, students, 
parents, and patients—these are what 
Senate Republicans are fighting for. 
I have introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion to further this goal. I believe we 
should include it in the HEALS Act in 
its entirety. Many pieces of it are in, 
but I think we can do more. 
The 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Small 
Business Forgiveness Act would offer 
streamlined forgiveness for any bor-
rower of a Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram loan of $150,000 or less who fills 
out a simple one-page form attesting 
that they spent the loan dollars the 
way they are supposed to.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4571 
July 29, 2020 
With the expected forgiveness guid-
ance from the bureaucracy, businesses 
and lenders will have to spend billions 
of dollars to receive the forgiveness 
that was promised them. In fact, we es-
timate that each borrower would have 
to spend $2,000—and each lender $500 
per loan—just to comply with what the 
bureaucracy 
comes 
up 
with. 
That 
doesn’t even include the dollars we 
have to spend on the bureaucracy 
itself. 
We created the PPP to help small 
businesses and their employees survive, 
not to create a bureaucracy that will 
bury them in paperwork. 
So who are these borrowers of PPP 
loans of $150,000 or less? Well, loans of 
this size make up—listen to this—85 
percent or 4.2 million of the loans but 
only 25 percent or $132 million of the 
loaned amount. Imagine that: 85 per-
cent of the loans are in this category— 
4.2 million of roughly 5 million loans. 
So that means 15 percent of the author-
ized PPP loans make up 75 percent of 
the borrowed money. 
In North Dakota, the average loan 
was only $91,000, but under current law, 
the bureaucracy would, regardless of 
loan size, seek to indiscriminately 
verify and approve forgiveness applica-
tions, and they haven’t even come up 
with the form to do it with yet. 
This would require a significant 
growth in the government and in the 
bureaucracy that we cannot afford, 
only to make small businesses and 
lenders spend time and money they 
can’t afford to spend to comply with 
this bureaucracy. It makes no sense. 
Lest we forget, when the Senate 
unanimously passed the CARES Act, 
we made our intent clear: PPP loans 
would become grants for the businesses 
that spent the money properly, and the 
banks were there to help guide them. 
There was no caveat that the loan 
would come with unnecessary bureauc-
racy. In fact, quite the opposite was 
true. The implication was that it would 
not come with additional bureaucracy. 
The bipartisan bill that I introduced 
with Senators MENENDEZ, TILLIS, and 
SINEMA—and now has 25 Senate spon-
sors—would fulfill our original intent 
and the promise we made to lenders 
and applicants by creating a simple, 
accountable process for loan forgive-
ness. 
Our bill also includes a provision 
which makes sure that the lenders will 
not be held responsible for improper 
actions of the borrowers, while still en-
suring proper enforcement action can 
be taken if necessary. In fact, the ac-
countability structure is intact. 
When we passed the CARES Act, we 
literally 
encouraged 
businesses 
to 
apply for PPP and urged the bureauc-
racy and the lenders to get the money 
out the door fast. We were in a crisis. 
We were trying to keep people from 
being laid off and let go. 
Largely, we were successful, but that 
success could be undone if we do not 
take the next steps properly. We 
shouldn’t backtrack on the guidance 
we gave lenders by holding them ac-
countable for the decisions the bor-
rowers made. 
Fraud is a concern, for sure, which is 
why my proposal keeps all audit au-
thorities intact. If a borrower falsely 
attests to using the funds correctly, 
the Federal Government is able to in-
vestigate and hold them accountable. If 
this sounds like a commonsense ap-
proach, that is because it is. 
This bipartisan measure was popular 
from the start, and it is gaining sup-
port still, with a quarter of the Senate, 
a sizable number in the House, and now 
close to 200 business associations and 
groups from the entire political spec-
trum supporting it. 
Why wouldn’t it be popular? It aligns 
with the very same principles we are 
fighting for right here today—jobs, 
kids, and healthcare. 
No small business owner figuring out 
how to safely send their kid to school 
should have to worry about unneces-
sary red tape. No employee of a shop on 
Main Street should have to live in fear 
of being laid off because their employer 
might not perfectly comply with the 
arbitrary requirements put forth for 
them by a bureaucrat in Washington. 
No brother, sister, son, or daughter 
should have to sit down and crunch the 
numbers to make sure they have 
enough money to apply for loan for-
giveness while supporting their family 
at home. 
The fear they face is real. ‘‘Small 
business’’ is not just an arbitrary des-
ignation. They are the backbone of 
America. They are the employers of 
the vast majority of people in our 
country, and their anxiety is our anx-
iety. 
Earlier this month, Treasury Sec-
retary Mnuchin told the House com-
mittee that this is an idea we should 
consider, and I agree. We should con-
sider it in bipartisan negotiations and 
add it to the HEALS Act in its en-
tirety. It will give our small businesses 
the peace of mind they need, like the 
rest of us, while they fight for their 
livelihoods during this pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be allowed to 
complete my remarks before the roll-
call vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, first, 
let me say I concur with the comments 
by the Senator from North Dakota. I 
think he makes wonderful points about 
what is being done in terms of pan-
demic relief and the issues that we as a 
nation are facing. 
As his State and mine are similar, 
with so many small businesses, and we 
see the impact and the success related 
to the Paycheck Protection Program, I 
just want to associate my beliefs with 
those that we have just heard ex-
pressed from the Senator from North 
Dakota. 
PROTESTS 
I come to the floor today to talk 
about another epidemic, and that is the 
epidemic of violence that is sweeping 
our country. 
Monday’s Washington Post headline 
warns: ‘‘Protests explode across the 
country; police declare riots in Seattle 
and Portland.’’ 
Tuesday’s Wall Street Journal edi-
torial is headlined: ‘‘A Weekend of 
Urban Anarchy.’’ ‘‘A weekend of Urban 
Anarchy.’’ In Seattle, on Saturday, ri-
oters blew a hole in a police precinct. 
They hurled explosives, and they in-
jured 53 police officers. In Portland, ri-
oters threw Molotov cocktails Friday 
night. Several officers were hit with 
heavy explosives. The rioters returned 
Sunday and attacked the courthouse. 
In spite of what the Democrats say 
when they call these ‘‘peaceful pro-
tests,’’ these are not peaceful and they 
are not protests. This is active vio-
lence. This is organized violence, and it 
is meant to destroy and to intimidate. 
Portland has now endured 60 days of 
senseless destruction. These violent 
protests are a powder keg for our en-
tire Nation. The rioters threaten entire 
communities. They are ruining lives, 
and they are ruining neighborhoods. 
They are wrecking public property, and 
they are wrecking private property. 
They burn, they loot, and they kill. 
Across the country, a number of po-
lice officers have been killed. Accord-
ing to the New York Times report, 
murder rates in our big cities are now 
up 16 percent compared to last year. In 
New York alone, murders are up 24 per-
cent. In Atlanta, murder is up 31 per-
cent. In Chicago, murder is up 51 per-
cent. In Chicago, last week, 15 people 
were shot while attending the funeral 
of a victim of gang violence. Children 
are being hurt and killed. A 7-year-old 
girl and a 14-year-old boy were among 
those shot and killed in Chicago over 
the Fourth of July weekend. 
This is a crisis of leadership in our 
liberal cities. Where are the Demo-
cratic mayors? They have surrendered 
to the mob. Where are the Democratic 
Governors? They have surrendered to 
the mob. Instead of leading, they are 
turning their backs on the safety and 
security of the law-abiding citizens of 
our communities. In these liberal cit-
ies, mob rule has replaced the rule of 
law. We are seeing in realtime—in 
realtime—the result of the radical 
‘‘defund the police’’ movement that is 
embraced by many Democrats. 
We should defend, not defund, the po-
lice and law enforcement. Americans 
do not want to defund the police. Ac-
cording to a recent Rasmussen poll, 
two out of three Americans oppose cut-
ting police funding. A majority say 
that they want the Federal Govern-
ment to help fight crime in these cit-
ies. One thing is clear: The violent riot-
ing plaguing our cities cannot con-
tinue. The police are being targeted for 
doing their job, and their jobs come at 
great personal risk. At the same time, 
elected Democratic mayors and city

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 585 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I rise 
today amid what we all know to be a 
global health and economic crisis that 
we are in. I rise to propose a solution 
that has been in front of us all along 
from the very beginning. It is a solu-
tion that has existed for 55 years to-
morrow—55 years. 
Medicaid has brought millions of peo-
ple to better healthcare. It has brought 
billions of dollars into States. That is 
important 
when 
we 
have 
both 
a 
healthcare crisis and an economic cri-
sis, but for 55 years, Medicaid has lifted 
the health outcomes of people all 
across this country and especially in so 
many States that need it—States like 
Alabama that are poor States, that are 
unhealthy States. 
But we can do better. A solution of 
Medicaid would bring billions of dollars 
into my home State of Alabama along 
with about a dozen other States. It 
would create thousands of new jobs. It 
would help shore up rural hospitals 
that are facing financial struggles, a 
condition made worse by this pan-
demic. It would provide healthcare cov-
erage in Alabama alone to between 
300,000 to 400,000 Alabamians who do 
not have it right now. Some didn’t 
have it before this pandemic. Others 
don’t have it now because they have 
lost their jobs. They have lost their 
employer-sponsored healthcare. 
Expanding Medicaid would generate 
$935 billion, with a ‘‘b,’’ in new tax rev-
enue for the State of Alabama. It 
would help local economies across the 
State by creating good jobs and ensur-
ing workers and their families have 
good healthcare. 
In 
our 
rural 
areas, 
especially, 
healthcare is dependent on Federal dol-
lars. Folks, expanding Medicaid was 
the right thing to do before this pan-
demic and some 37 States or so did just 
that. In fact, two States did that fairly 
recently. Conservative States of Okla-
homa and Nebraska are both in the 
process of expanding Medicaid. It was 
important before the pandemic, but it 
is vital that we do it now. It is abso-
lutely vital, especially, as so many 
people have lost their jobs, lost their 
employer-sponsored 
healthcare 
through no fault of their own. 
Alabama didn’t take that step back 
in 2011 when it should have. Alabama

S4573 
July 29, 2020 
held back. There is little doubt that 
the main reason—not the sole reason— 
but the main reason that they held 
back was purely political. The Ala-
bama Legislature and the Alabama 
Governor refused to legitimize the Af-
fordable Care Act and put their name 
on anything having to do with it. The 
people of Alabama—hundreds of thou-
sands—have suffered because of it. 
That excuse is waning thin today, es-
pecially when so much is needed to pro-
vide healthcare to the people of my 
State. Just this morning, a new poll 
came out from Auburn University that 
showed that a majority of the people of 
Alabama, including a majority of Re-
publicans and a majority of Democrats, 
favor expanding Medicaid. Our hos-
pitals 
and 
healthcare 
professionals 
have long advocated for this all across 
Alabama. 
We did a program just recently. The 
American 
Hospital 
Association 
has 
been begging for this for years to keep 
our hospitals open. They advocated for 
an understanding that without this, 
more and more of our hospitals will 
have to close their doors. They are 
working on either thin margins or they 
are underwater already, and the pan-
demic has made it worse. More than a 
dozen of our hospitals, rural and urban, 
have shuttered while Alabama has re-
fused to expand Medicaid. 
Today, we have a chance to save the 
ones we still have and perhaps even re-
vive some outpatient services that 
have lost their provider. Every preg-
nant mother who has to drive hours for 
a round trip for prenatal appointments 
or a rural Alabamian who lives 45 miles 
from the nearest emergency room or 
the workers who are employed would 
benefit from this. Those who still do 
not have good healthcare and have to 
take their children to an emergency 
room for routine healthcare, it is for 
those people that I am committed to 
finding a way to expand Medicaid. 
Today, I stand with my colleague 
Senator WARNER from Virginia to once 
again call for the passage of our pro-
posal to incentivize States to expand 
Medicaid. Our bill, the SAME Act, 
States Achieving Medicaid Expansion 
Act, would restore the financial incen-
tives for States that expanded late and 
would give them the same fair shot at 
Federal support as the early expanding 
States. 
The legislation would have the Fed-
eral Government cover 100 percent of 
the costs for the first 3 years, then 
would scale back to eventually cover 90 
percent in perpetuity. 
I want to make sure folks understand 
this bill does not mandate an expan-
sion of Medicaid; it still gives States 
the choice. If the 13 or 14 States, in-
cluding Alabama, choose not to expand 
Medicaid, even with a second bite of 
the apple, then they don’t have to. 
Shame on them for not doing so, but 
they don’t have to do it. More impor-
tantly, if they were to do that, thou-
sands 
of 
people 
would 
get 
this 
healthcare coverage, including a very 
important point for the State of Ala-
bama, which is expanded mental health 
coverage. So many places that I have 
been to in the State of Alabama are 
begging for mental health coverage 
that they cannot afford in their com-
munities. Expanding Medicaid would 
do just that. 
Let me be clear. Even without this 
bill, I still believe Alabama should 
take this step. We literally can’t afford 
not to. We need to be investing in our 
citizens’ health the same way we invest 
in trying to bring businesses into Ala-
bama. We need to try to invest in our 
people’s health because it will lift all 
boats. 
If this incentive is what is needed to 
get us over the finish line, let’s just do 
it. Again, it is not mandated. States 
don’t have to do it. But for those 
States that do, they will see better 
health outcomes for their citizens and 
better economic advantages in areas 
that need it. Millions of Americans in 
these remaining States are struggling, 
and we can no longer allow politics to 
get in the way of their access to qual-
ity healthcare. 
I urge my colleagues to please let my 
State have the chance. Let us have the 
opportunity to right the wrong that we 
did in 2011 by refusing to expand. Give 
me that opportunity to go back and try 
to convince the folks in Montgomery, 
AL, that this is the right thing to do. 
It is a commonsense solution. Let’s not 
stand in the way of more Americans 
getting 
healthcare 
amid 
a 
global 
health crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Vir-
ginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I 
want to thank the Senator from Ala-
bama for his partnership on the SAME 
Act. I am going to repeat some of the 
same arguments he made because I 
think they are quite compelling. 
We are talking about healthcare, 
which is an issue that is weighing on 
too many American families at this 
point—and not just healthcare but ac-
cess to healthcare coverage. I think we 
would all agree that regardless of what 
we feel about this issue, we are in the 
midst of the greatest public healthcare 
crisis in generations. In this unprece-
dented time, I think it calls for unprec-
edented action from Congress. 
Today, in a couple of moments, I am 
going to ask that this Senate take up 
and unanimously pass legislation I in-
troduced along with Senator JONES 
from Alabama and several of my col-
leagues—legislation that could provide 
access 
to 
quality 
and 
affordable 
healthcare coverage for millions of 
Americans. To be clear, the SAME Act 
is the bill I have been pushing for more 
than 3 years. This bill was a good idea 
before the pandemic, but the need for it 
has become even greater in light of the 
COVID–19 outbreak. 
The SAME Act would ensure that 
States like Virginia—and we did pass 
Medicaid expansion, but we passed it 
later than other States—that States 
that have expanded their Medicaid Pro-
gram to serve more Americans can get 
their fair share of Federal matching 
dollars. 
It would also incentivize additional 
States—like the State of Alabama 
which hasn’t yet expanded Medicaid— 
to expand this critical program to mil-
lions of more Americans. I can think of 
no better time to pass this legislation 
than right now, when more than 5 mil-
lion Americans find themselves having 
lost their healthcare coverage in the 
last 3 months alone. 
In fact, some reports actually esti-
mate that nearly 27 million Americans 
have lost their employer-sponsored 
health insurance and are now in jeop-
ardy of becoming uninsured. 
Our legislation would provide much 
needed financial support to States that 
are seeing an increase in Medicaid en-
rollment as folks face the fallout of 
this crisis. For those millions of peo-
ple, the SAME Act would provide a sig-
nificant lifeline. Estimates show that 
if every State were to expand its Med-
icaid Program, about 3 million addi-
tional 
Americans 
would 
have 
healthcare coverage. 
I don’t believe this is a political ar-
gument nor a philosophical exercise. 
This legislation has a real-world im-
pact, and it is clear that Americans 
want and need this legislation to pass. 
As my colleague just mentioned, 
there are a number of States—Red 
States and Blue States—which have 
taken advantage of this opportunity, 
including, just recently, Oklahoma. A 
few weeks ago, Oklahomans went to 
the polls and voted to expand their 
Medicaid Program to provide broader 
access to coverage. We have seen simi-
lar actions from citizens in Utah, 
Maine, Idaho, and others. Across our 
Nation, Americans are making it clear 
that they want expanded access to 
healthcare coverage, and I believe Con-
gress needs to listen. 
With all due respect to my Repub-
lican colleagues, you can’t say you 
want to help Americans in this dev-
astating time and simultaneously op-
pose this bill, which would actually 
provide that help. 
As we stand here in this Chamber, we 
have the privilege of knowing that we 
and our families have access to the 
healthcare coverage we need so that, if 
something were to go wrong, we would 
be covered. So why shouldn’t we ensure 
the same access for more Americans? 
The median cost of a hospitalization 
due to COVID–19 is $14,000. For Ameri-
cans without health insurance—the 
nearly 30 million and growing—that 
could mean losing their homes or their 
cars. For many, it could put them into 
bankruptcy. 
Now, I know that my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle want to do 
right by their constituents and the 
millions of other Americans who need 
help. So I ask us to come together 
today to support the SAME Act. No 
one should go bankrupt because one

got sick and sought medical care, but 
more importantly, no one should go 
bankrupt when this legislative body 
has the opportunity to act. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Finance be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 585, the 
States Achieve Medicaid Expansion 
Act; that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed; and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, in reserving the right to object, I 
appreciate we all want to help Ameri-
cans get the healthcare they need, but 
what my colleagues are proposing is a 
Federal bailout that will help a handful 
of States but do little to directly help 
patients. That is not fair to Americans 
across the Nation who need better ac-
cess to affordable healthcare. 
We have seen that a government 
takeover of healthcare does not work. 
ObamaCare was sold on a lie, plain and 
simple. 
Let’s 
remember, 
when 
ObamaCare passed, they promised it 
would save $2,500 per family. Not true. 
Costs and premiums went up. They 
promised that you could keep your doc-
tor. Not true. Provider networks got 
narrower, and people lost their doctors. 
They promised, if you liked your plan, 
you could keep it. Again, this was not 
true. The promise of ObamaCare didn’t 
happen. Actually, the opposite hap-
pened. Under ObamaCare, costs sky-
rocketed, and families lost the doctors 
they liked. 
The American people don’t want 
more lies. Actually, they want more 
solutions. The solution is not to create 
more inequity in the system. What we 
need is to take concrete steps to make 
sure we help all families across the Na-
tion actually get the healthcare they 
need. My colleague’s bill does nothing 
to help patients. States will make their 
own decisions on Medicaid. Giving cer-
tain States free Medicaid is nothing 
more than a bailout for State budgets. 
In June, I wrote to all 50 Governors 
and requested information on how 
their States have allocated the tril-
lions of dollars in taxpayer funding 
from the Federal coronavirus response 
measures that had been passed by Con-
gress. Unfortunately, a majority of the 
States simply chose not to respond, in-
cluding Virginia and Alabama. 
The Federal Government already al-
located $1 trillion to States and local 
governments 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
coronavirus, but these States are refus-
ing to tell us how they are spending 
these extra funds, including the esti-
mated extra $50 billion in Federal Med-
icaid dollars they received in the Fami-
lies First Act. Since the Families First 
Act has passed, Medicaid costs have ac-
tually gone down, but the States don’t 
want to tell us that because they sim-
ply want bailouts. 
Instead of pursuing a partisan bail-
out of a select number of States, I want 
to use this opportunity to propose a 
commonsense solution that would use 
bipartisan principles to help every sin-
gle American in this country. Though 
ObamaCare was a failure, I support 
protecting people with preexisting con-
ditions and ensuring that young adults 
can stay on their parents’ health plans 
until age 26. I think my colleagues 
would also support these principles. 
I have been working with Senator 
TILLIS on the PROTECT Act, which 
would directly assist Americans by, 
one, guaranteeing coverage for pre-
existing conditions and prohibiting in-
surance companies from excluding cov-
erage of treatment for a patient’s pre-
existing condition; two, prohibiting in-
surance 
companies 
from 
charging 
Americans higher premiums due to 
their 
preexisting 
conditions; 
and, 
three, guaranteeing the availability of 
health insurance coverage in the em-
ployer or individual market regardless 
of one’s preexisting condition. My 
amendment builds on the PROTECT 
Act and adds protections to allow 
young adults to stay on their parents’ 
health insurance plans until they are 
26. 
We 
could 
pass 
this 
amendment, 
which I believe has bipartisan support, 
and ensure that every American with a 
preexisting condition is protected no 
matter how the Supreme Court rules 
on ObamaCare. 
The American people and, certainly, 
the people of Florida, Virginia, and 
Alabama want us to get something 
done 
that 
would 
actually 
reduce 
healthcare costs and increase access to 
care. That is what my proposal does. 
Protecting Americans with preexisting 
conditions is a commonsense step we 
can and should take today to lower the 
costs of healthcare for all Americans. I 
hope my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting these bipartisan healthcare re-
forms. 
Therefore, I ask the Senator to mod-
ify his request to include my substitute 
amendment, which is at the desk; that 
it be considered and agreed to; that the 
bill, as amended, be considered read a 
third time and passed; and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, in 
reserving the right to object, I have 
great respect for my friend, the Sen-
ator from Florida. I know he has a long 
and deep background in healthcare, but 
I have some news. The Affordable Care 
Act already provides strong protec-
tions for millions of Americans with 
preexisting conditions. 
I believe, unfortunately, the legisla-
tion my colleague is proposing would 
allow insurance companies to, once 
again, impose arbitrary annual and 
lifetime cap limits on care, and it 
would allow insurance companies to 
refuse to cover essential health bene-
fits, like mental health coverage, sub-
stance use disorder, or maternity care. 
I don’t believe we can go back to the 
days when a certain number of compa-
nies held all the power and consumers 
were 
routinely 
denied 
access 
to 
healthcare. I do believe the SAME 
Act—again, sponsored by my good 
friend, the Senator from Alabama— 
would simply continue to extend the 
right to have the same level of Federal 
subsidies for all States. We are seeing 
voters across the country, as they have 
a chance to weigh in on this, agree to 
this principle, which is that those same 
rights ought to be extended to States 
like Alabama, which has chosen not to 
move forward, and to States like Vir-
ginia, which has moved forward but a 
little bit late. I still strongly believe 
that the SAME Act, which would 
equalize and level the playing field, is 
the appropriate action. 
Respectfully, I object to the unani-
mous consent request of the Senator 
from Florida to pass this bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there an objection to the original 
request? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, in reserving the right to object, 
first of all, I thank my colleagues, and 
I hope to work with them to figure out 
how we can drive healthcare costs 
down because, as we know in all of our 
States, healthcare costs are too high, 
and as my colleagues have said, we 
have people who are being impacted be-
cause they can’t afford the cost of 
healthcare. 
I am clearly disappointed. My col-
leagues don’t want to protect those 
with preexisting conditions and ensure 
that young adults can stay on their 
parents’ 
plans 
until 
age 
26 
if 
ObamaCare is actually ruled unconsti-
tutional by the Supreme Court. Wheth-
er by figuring out how to bring drug 
prices down or just the whole cost of 
healthcare, I hope that we can figure 
out how to work together because the 
costs shouldn’t be this high. 
Therefore, respectfully, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

objection, it is so ordered.

HEALS ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor to talk about some of 
the steps that Congress should take in 
response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
I am going to start with talking about 
the legislation that the majority lead-
er, Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, intro-
duced yesterday. 
One of the aspects of it that hasn’t 
gotten much attention and that, I 
think, is very positive and a very effec-
tive way to get the economy moving in 
a safe way is with some tax legislation. 
These are tax credits and tax deduc-
tions that help to encourage the hiring 
of new workers but that also do so in a 
safe way. These are the kinds of things 
that make a lot of sense and that have 
a lot of bipartisan support and appeal, 
so I think it should be part of whatever 
final package we end up with. 
The goal of these tax incentives is to 
say that we want people to reenter the 
workforce but to do it in a safe and 
sustainable way. For example, in the 
McConnell proposal is legislation I 
have introduced, called the Healthy 
Workplaces Tax Credit Act. It is very 
simple. It says there will be a credit on 
the employer’s side of payroll taxes 
against qualified employee protection 
expenses and workplace reconfigura-
tion expenses to ensure employers can 
afford additional safety measures. 
As I travel around the State of Ohio, 
I see the Plexiglas dividers. You have 
probably seen those in offices where 
there are more open settings. You see 
it in a lot of retail places now. There is 
a cost to that, but there is also a cost 
to personal protective gear—the masks 
and the gowns and the gloves and the 
other things that people are needing in 
order to have a safe workplace. As I 
have been in some of the factories 
around Ohio, I have also seen that they 
have had to reconfigure the factory 
spaces in order to provide more social 
distancing. At one plant, in its floor 
plan, it had expanded the lunchroom in 
order 
to 
provide 
more 
social 
distancing, and that, of course, meant 
there was less space for manufacturing. 
These are costs, and these are the 
kinds of things that could be part of 
this credit. 
So my hope is, whether it is a ther-
mometer check or whether it is more 
testing or whether it is PPE or whether 
it is more hand sanitizer, that we could 
encourage people to use these things by 
having a tax credit. It would provide an 
immediate stimulus to the economy as 
well, which is a good thing because 
many businesses would be operating at 
a loss and not have taxable income, but 
they would have payroll tax liability, 
and this is a credit to the payroll tax. 
It also applies, by the way, to non-
profits, as it should, and to the 
501(c)(3)s. I was at one of the alcohol 
and drug addiction entities in one of 
our counties the week before last, and 
it had Plexiglas up. Frankly, it is hurt-
ing in terms of its budget right now, 
but it felt like it had to have a safe 
place for people to work. We want ev-
erybody to have a safe place. We want

people to go back to work and to go 
back safely. 
I commend Senator MCCONNELL for 
including that bill in the CARES 2.0 
package that was released this week. 
This tax credit will support efforts to 
make the workplace safe and healthy 
and build consumer confidence in that 
all of the appropriate measures are 
being taken. It is important to get con-
sumers back in the mix. Whether it is 
going back into a restaurant and feel-
ing safe or going back to a retail estab-
lishment, if people feel safe, they are 
more likely to go back, and this econ-
omy can get going again. So I think it 
is something, again, both sides of the 
aisle should be able to support, and it 
will show we are doing everything we 
can to get people back to more normal 
lives. 
Second, with the unemployment rate 
still at about 11 percent, we need to en-
courage hiring and employee retention 
as this virus continues to affect our 
economy. In the McConnell proposal, 
we have a way to create this incentive 
that builds on legislation we have al-
ready passed in the form of the work 
opportunity tax credit. This is an ex-
isting law that gives employers an in-
centive to hire individuals who might 
not otherwise be able to get a job. 
Categories now include, as an exam-
ple, our veterans. So, if you are a vet-
eran and are having a tough time get-
ting a job, you can go through the 
work opportunity tax credit, and the 
employer can get a credit for hiring 
you initially. By the way, almost ev-
eryone I talk to says these people end 
up being hired full time and being paid 
their full wages. In the meantime, they 
get a credit to bring them on during a 
first transition period, so it works. 
Another category, as an example, is 
the folks who have been let out of pris-
on. Second chance individuals have a 
chance under the work opportunity tax 
credit, WOTC, to get a job. 
We have proposed adding a new cat-
egory, which is qualified COVID–19 em-
ployees—those who are on unemploy-
ment insurance immediately prior to 
their hiring date. It increases the work 
opportunity tax credit amount for this 
new targeted group of individuals from 
40 percent of the first $6,000 in qualified 
wages to 50 percent of the first $10,000 
in qualified wages. Again, it encour-
ages us to help get people off unem-
ployment insurance and back to work. 
Let’s say they work for a company that 
is not going back because of COVID–19. 
Let’s say it is a movie theater or a 
bowling alley or, maybe, a bar. Those 
individuals would qualify. 
Third, I support a proposal in this 
McConnell draft that builds on what is 
called the employee retention tax cred-
it. That is already in law. We put it in 
law in the first CARES Act. The credit 
was a good start, but it needs to be up-
dated and expanded given the course of 
our economy since March and what has 
happened with the coronavirus. This 
credit applies to employers who have 
operations partially or fully suspended 
due to COVID–19 and any related gov-
ernment order saying that one has to 
shut down but has chosen to retain 
one’s affected employees. It is a credit 
that increases from the CARES 1 from 
50 to 65 percent per employee—from 
$10,000 under current law for the whole 
year and $10,000 per quarter. It also 
helps businesses that have had a 25-per-
cent decline in revenues, not a 50-per-
cent decline in revenues. 
It is for the group of companies that 
may not have qualified for a PPP cred-
it or a PPP loan—they may not have 
gotten one—but is having a tough time 
keeping their workers. This would en-
courage them to keep those workers 
and to bring on new workers. Again, it 
is the kind of support that our work-
force needs as the economy reopens and 
companies resume ramping up oper-
ations. It helps to bring people off the 
unemployment rolls. It is a pull into 
the workforce, and that is a good 
thing. 
These are commonsense proposals. 
What is more, historically, they have 
been policies that have had bipartisan 
support. I worked with my friend Sen-
ator BEN CARDIN, on the other side, in 
designing the employee retention tax 
credit back in March, and expanding 
the work opportunity tax credit has al-
ways had bipartisan support. 
On the healthy workplace credit, 
Senator SINEMA, of Arizona, has a simi-
lar bill that goes a little further, but it 
is very similar. I see no reason we can’t 
take what we all agree on works and 
make it even better in this new pack-
age. 
Again, these tax incentives are the 
kind of bipartisan consensus-builders 
that we ought to be looking at right 
now to get into a new package, hope-
fully, by the end of this week. We have 
to ensure—I think all of us agree—the 
safe reopening of our economy, and 
these tax provisions do that. 
CHINA 
Mr. President, another aspect of the 
COVID–19 legislation is a part of the 
bill that focuses on how we deal with 
bringing back our personal protective 
gear production from overseas, particu-
larly from China, and how to deal with 
the concern we have that other coun-
tries are taking the research we are 
doing on therapies and cures. By the 
way, there are substantial, more re-
sources, billions of dollars that go into 
that in this bill. Right now, in labs all 
around America, some of the best and 
brightest minds are at work on thera-
pies, cures, and vaccines for COVID–19. 
It has changed all of our lives in the 
past few months, and we stand to ben-
efit from these medical breakthroughs, 
and we want them to have them. So, 
again, Congress has already appro-
priated billions of dollars. In the 
McConnell proposal, there are billions 
more for this purpose, and that is ap-
propriate. 
Yet, as we work to find a cure, there 
are troubling reports emerging that 
China, in particular, is actively trying 
to take this research for itself. As the 
FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency warned in 
May, there has been a pattern of ‘‘tar-
geting and compromise of U.S. organi-
zations conducting COVID–19-related 
research by PRC-affiliated cyber actors 
and non-traditional collectors.’’ 
FBI Director Wray was even more 
pointed about this threat earlier this 
month, stating on July 7: ‘‘At this very 
moment, China is working to com-
promise American health care organi-
zations, 
pharmaceutical 
companies, 
and academic institutions conducting 
essential COVID–19 research.’’ 
Just last week, the Justice Depart-
ment filed charges against a Chinese 
researcher who failed to disclose her 
ties to the People’s Liberation Army 
while conducting medical research at 
Stanford University. While she was not 
accused of stealing the research in this 
case, this kind of arrangement, where-
in scholars are essentially agents of 
the Chinese Government in order to 
gain access to our cutting-edge labs 
around the country to find research to 
sneak back into China, is all too com-
mon. 
That China would attempt to steal 
our research for its own benefit is, un-
fortunately, not surprising. As we have 
all seen over the past few months, Chi-
na’s failure to live up to its inter-
national 
commitments 
on 
critical 
issues like transparency and human 
rights have led to some of the issues we 
have had, particularly with regard to 
the lack of transparency on the un-
checked spread of the coronavirus from 
Wuhan. 
Frankly, relations with China are 
not good right now, in part, because of 
that. Unfortunately, our problems with 
China extend to our labs and our uni-
versities. As chair of the Senate Per-
manent Subcommittee on Investiga-
tions, I led a bipartisan investigation 
last year into this issue. Over the 
course of a year, we learned how the 
Chinese Communist Party has used so- 
called talent recruitment programs— 
notably, its Thousand Talents Plan—to 
systematically target the most prom-
ising U.S.-based research and research-
ers and pay them to take their Amer-
ican taxpayer-funded research back to 
Chinese universities. 
While stealing this research is bad 
enough, what is worse is that it is not 
taken for academic purposes. Instead, 
according to the State Department 
witness at our hearing last November, 
‘‘the Chinese Communist Party has de-
clared the Chinese university system 
to be on the front line of military-civil-
ian fusion efforts for technology acqui-
sition.’’ That means there is a clear 
link between the research being taken 
from American labs and the latest ad-
vancement in China’s military and its 
economy. 
There has been more recent attention 
to this topic of research theft, which is 
a good thing. We need to talk about it 
and we need to expose it and we need to 
deal with it. Recently, both FBI Direc-
tor Wray and Attorney General Barr

July 29, 2020 
have spoken about this threat. In fact, 
Director Wray announced that the FBI 
is opening a new China-related inves-
tigation on this topic every 10 hours— 
a new investigation every 10 hours— 
with around 2,500 counterintelligence 
investigations now going on around the 
country. 
We have seen this type of research 
theft in my home State of Ohio, unfor-
tunately. 
Just a couple of months ago, a Na-
tional Institutes of Health-funded re-
searcher, 
affiliated 
with 
both 
the 
Cleveland Clinic and Case Western Re-
serve University, was accused of hiding 
that he had received more than $3 mil-
lion from the Chinese Government to 
effectively 
take 
and 
replicate 
his 
Cleveland Clinic research at a lab in 
China. He is actually accused of taking 
biological samples from Cleveland, OH, 
to Wuhan, China. And this was tax-
payer-paid research by the NIH. 
He is not alone. The NIH has recently 
reported that 54 scientists and re-
searchers have either resigned or been 
fired as a result of an NIH investiga-
tion into American taxpayer-funded 
grant recipients for their failure to dis-
close financial ties to foreign govern-
ments, particularly China. In fact, ac-
cording to the NIH investigation, more 
than 90 percent of the scientists had 
undisclosed ties to China. 
Unfortunately, as it stands, our law 
enforcement agencies can’t go directly 
after these researchers for hiding their 
foreign conflict of interest—for not 
telling the truth—while taking tax-
payer money. 
As important as it is that we speak 
out against these improper actions by 
China around the world, it is also crit-
ical that we take steps to clean up our 
own house right here in the United 
States and make America more resil-
ient against China. One way we can do 
that is by stopping research developed 
in our labs and universities from going 
to benefit China’s military and econ-
omy at our expense. 
I am pleased to say we have an oppor-
tunity to change that right now be-
cause this legislation is included in the 
COVID–19 legislation and in doing so 
take a stand in a bipartisan manner in 
defense of our values of research trans-
parency, collaboration, fairness, and 
national security. 
Our legislation is called the Safe-
guarding American Innovation Act, 
and I introduced it, along with Senator 
Tom Carper and a group of bipartisan 
Senators, to ensure that individuals 
are held accountable for failing to dis-
close their foreign ties on Federal 
grant applications. It will also reform 
the State Department’s vetting process 
for issuing visas to foreign researchers. 
It will require more safeguards on sen-
sitive research from our research insti-
tutions and our universities and will 
help us better track who is working on 
taxpayer-funded research. 
This bill is ready to pass the Senate. 
The Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee voted to ap-
prove it last week with bipartisan and 
unanimous consent. 
I am pleased to say that, again, Lead-
er MCCONNELL has chosen to include 
this legislation in his phase 5 proposal, 
the CARES 2.0 package, because it will 
help protect taxpayer-funded COVID–19 
research and serve as a safeguard for 
the $150 billion that Americans give to 
scientists to conduct research every 
year. That is the taxpayer funding that 
goes into our research institutions. In 
that 
regard, 
including 
the 
Safe-
guarding American Innovation Act in 
this CARES 2.0 bill can and should be 
viewed as a fiscally responsible meas-
ure as we continue to take a firmer 
stance against behavior that China has 
gotten away with for way too long. 
Let’s do all we can to put vulnerable 
American institutions on a solid foot-
ing as well. It is time to put an end to 
the Chinese Communist Party’s theft 
of our taxpayer-funded research, in-
cluding COVID–19 research. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
supporting the Safeguarding American 
Innovation Act. 
MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS 
Mr. President, I am also here on floor 
today to talk about another critical 
issue we should be addressing. 
As we speak, there continues to be a 
looming crisis involving what is called 
our multiemployer pension system, and 
without reform, it is going to result in 
pension benefit cuts of over 90 percent 
for more than 1.4 million American 
workers and retirees and unnecessary 
bankruptcies for a lot of small busi-
nesses, including many in my home 
State of Ohio. 
Multiemployer pension plans are de-
fined benefit plans maintained by a lot 
of different companies, multiple com-
panies, and a labor union that pool to-
gether their pension assets to cover all 
workers and retirees in the plan. The 
multiemployer system now comprises 
roughly 1,400 plans covering almost 11 
million participants and their families. 
Unfortunately, it is on the verge of 
collapse. Years of bad Federal policy 
with respect to funding and with-
drawal, liability rules, losses on risky 
investments, 
and 
failure 
to 
take 
proactive action have led to this crisis, 
and the current economic slowdown 
caused by the coronavirus has made 
the situation even worse. 
Not only is the system underfunded 
by about $638 billion, but the Federal 
entity that insures these pensions, the 
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 
is also projected to become insolvent in 
less than 5 years. So the multiem-
ployer part of the PBGC, Pension Ben-
efit Guaranty Corporation, is projected 
to become insolvent in less than 5 
years. We can’t let that happen. 
In my home State of Ohio, we have 
more than 50,000 active workers and re-
tirees in multiemployer pension plans 
who are facing deep benefit cuts if we 
do nothing, with hundreds of small 
businesses contributing to these plans 
that could be forced to close if we fail 
to act. 
There are about 200 small businesses 
in Ohio that are going to have huge li-
abilities, many of which are not going 
to be able to continue to operate. We 
can’t let that happen. 
Nearly 42,000 of those Ohioans, by the 
way—many of them veterans—partici-
pate in a single plan called the Central 
States Pension Fund, which is also the 
largest plan considered to be in what is 
called critical and declining status and 
is projected to become insolvent by 
2025. It is that insolvency that will 
take down the PBGC if it is not already 
insolvent. 
The good news is that proactive ac-
tion now will reduce the cost of fixing 
the problem, will ensure a secure re-
tirement for these participants and 
their families, and will ensure cer-
tainty for employers to make invest-
ments in good-paying jobs. 
The further good news is that the 
House 
Democratic 
proposal 
which 
passed as part of the Heroes Act—it is 
called the Emergency Pension Plan Re-
lief Act—is more similar to the Senate 
version, the Senate Republican struc-
ture, than the previous Democratic 
plan. So not only is the Democratic 
plan in their COVID–19 response bill, 
called the Heroes Act, but it is also 
more similar in structure to legislation 
that some of us have been working on 
over here on the Senate side. That 
means we have a better shot, I believe, 
this year than we have had in a long 
time to try to solve this crisis and do 
it in a bipartisan way. 
In my view, in order to solve this, it 
is going to entail three key principles: 
First, we are all in this together, and 
that means we all have a shared re-
sponsibility. 
House 
Democrats 
have 
proposed 
using only taxpayer money to rescue 
these plans. None of the stakeholders 
are asked to, again, have any shared 
responsibility. That is not the way to 
get bipartisan support in Congress. 
Employers and participants must also 
share 
the 
responsibility, 
especially 
since about 94 percent of taxpayers do 
not participate in this system, many of 
whom are struggling with their own re-
tirement security. As an example, 
somewhat higher employer contribu-
tions are required if multiemployer 
plans are to sustainably provide the 
benefits they promise. 
Second, we need to ensure that we 
safeguard 
the 
long-term 
financial 
health of the PBGC so we aren’t back 
in this fiscal crisis again soon. Part of 
that should be a new, small, variable- 
rate premium for plans, but we also 
need participants in federally rescued 
plans to pitch in with solvency fees 
paid directly to the PBGC. These do 
not have to be large payments. 
The Federal Government and the tax-
payer, I think, are willing to play a 
role as long as this is viewed as some-
thing that is part of shared responsi-
bility. But it is important that all 
stakeholders are contributing to the 
health of the PBGC in addition to us

here in Congress and therefore the tax-
payers because insolvency would be in 
no one’s interest. 
Finally, we have to ensure that there 
is long-term solvency for these multi-
employer plans. That entails enacting 
some restructuring, some structural 
reforms to the funding rules governing 
employer contributions so that bailing 
out these plans doesn’t become a habit 
of the Federal Government. We don’t 
want to fix this problem and be right 
back in a few years having to fix it 
again. 
We should gradually phase down the 
rate of return which plans assume in 
budgeting for promises that are made 
to participants, partly because that 
keeps these plans from going bankrupt 
and partly because that is just fair. In-
vestment risk is a problem in these 
plans now, and we need to give more 
certainty to workers and retirees. 
The pension crisis is an issue that I, 
along with Senator GRASSLEY, Senator 
SHERROD BROWN from Ohio, and many 
other colleagues here in the Senate, 
have been trying to solve for quite a 
long time. We had a bicameral and bi-
partisan solution very close at hand at 
the conclusion of a committee process 
that ended about a year and a half ago, 
but we weren’t quite able to get there. 
I think it is achievable, particularly 
now, but only if we are willing to listen 
to each other and willing to come 
around the table for a real discussion. 
Republicans have reached out. I 
reach out today. We are ready to find 
an acceptable compromise. We are 
ready to talk, but that discussion 
needs to be driven by the merits of 
solving this issue, not just the politics 
of the moment. We owe solving this 
problem to those beneficiaries—the re-
tirees, the workers, the active workers 
in these plans—and to the small busi-
nesses participating in these plans. We 
have to find common ground. We have 
to deliver a sustainable and lasting so-
lution. 
I believe we have an opportunity 
right now, this month, to try to come 
together, working with the House and 
the Senate and the administration. Ev-
erybody has a responsibility to do it. 
We talked about shared responsibility 
with regard to the plans; there is also 
a shared accountability here in the 
U.S. Congress. This is our job. We can 
get this done. I think we are quite 
close now with similar structures and 
having gone through various iterations 
during the select committee process a 
year and a half ago. Let’s do the right 
thing. Let’s act now.

TRIBUTE TO U.S. SENATE INTERNS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
summer, it was my privilege to select 
several talented young Kentuckians for 
an internship in my Washington Sen-
ate office. As a former Senate intern 
myself, I am proud of the individuals 
who are eager to apply themselves to 
public service. 
I would like to take a moment to 
commend James Adams of Jefferson 
County, William Cohen of Jefferson 
County, Julian Colvin of Jefferson 
County, Garland Ellis of Bell County, 
Mary Grace Furnish of Harrison Coun-
ty, William Miller of Taylor County, 
Lauren Reuss of Spencer County, Sam-
uel Rickert of Oldham County, Eliza-
beth Rupp of Fayette County, Madelin 
Shelton of Owen County, Victoria Sisk 
of Christian County, Jordan White of 
Campbell County, and Erdin Zukic of 
Warren County for their interest in 
serving the Commonwealth of Ken-
tucky and our great Nation. Each of 
these young people has developed an 
impressive list of leadership experi-
ences and extracurricular activities. 
Their applications stood out, and I was 
proud to offer them an internship. 
Unfortunately, the coronavirus crisis 
forced the cancelation of this summer’s 
internship program. The virus may 
have taken away this opportunity, but 
it can never change the great potential 
these Kentuckians have in store. I 
would like to thank each of them for 
pursuing public service and to extend 
my best wishes for a bright future. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO U.S. SENATE PAGES 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it 
was my privilege to select three out-
standing high school students from 
Kentucky for this summer’s U.S. Sen-
ate Page Program. These talented 
young people completed a highly com-
petitive application process, and they 
represent the next generation of Ken-
tucky’s leaders. 
I would like to take a moment to 
commend Jackson Hester, Charlotte 
McCarthy, and Thomas Schrepferman 
for their interest in serving the Com-
monwealth of Kentucky and our great 
Nation. Their applications showed a 
broad range of leadership experiences 
and extracurricular activities. These 
Kentuckians and their families should 
be proud of all they’ve accomplished at 
this young age. 
Unfortunately, the coronavirus crisis 
made it impossible for the Senate Page 
Program to bring these students to 
Washington this summer. The virus 
may have canceled this opportunity, 
but it can never change the great po-
tential these young people have in 
store. I would like to thank Jackson, 
Charlotte, and Thomas for their com-
mitment to public service and extend 
my best wishes for a bright future.

NOMINATIONS 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, work-
ers right now are dealing with unprece-
dented challenges and are making 
great personal sacrifices to keep the 
country running during this crisis. 
And the nominees under consider-
ation today for the National Labor Re-
lations Board will play a critical role 
in safeguarding their rights and protec-
tions. 
That is why I voted for Lauren 
McFerran to serve another term on the 
NLRB. 
She is a dedicated, qualified, and 
well-respected public servant who had 
a proven track record of fighting for 
workers before she joined the Board 
and has stood by workers in enforcing 
these fundamental protections during 
her time on the NLRB. 
But unfortunately, the opposite is 
true for Marvin Kaplan, the Republican 
nominee to the NLRB. 
Mr. Kaplan spent his career working 
to further corporations’ interests and 
gut workers’ rights instead of pro-
tecting them. That is why Democrats 
opposed his nomination in 2017, and 
that is exactly what he has done since 
joining the NLRB. 
He is exactly wrong to serve another 
term on the NLRB, and that is why I 
voted against his confirmation. 
I am also extremely disappointed we 
do not have the nomination of another 
highly 
qualified 
Democrat 
to 
the 
NLRB, Jennifer Abruzzo, to consider 
today. 
Years of Republican obstruction of 
highly qualified Democratic nominees 
to critical worker protection agencies 
like the NLRB and the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission shows a 
blatant disregard for longstanding def-
erence to the minority party and is a 
significant departure from the customs 
of this institution. It is unacceptable, 
and I will not stop pushing for Demo-
cratic nominees. 
I urge my colleagues to vote today to 
stand up for workers and their rights. 
I would also like to say that, after 
months of delay from my Republican 
colleagues, the COVID relief proposal 
Republicans put forward this week is 
incredibly late, profoundly inadequate, 
and can’t credibly be considered a 
starting point for negotiations. 
It gives corporations a ‘‘get out of 
jail free’’ card to prevent employers 
from being held accountable for keep-
ing their workers safe and a license to 
discriminate including on the basis of 
age, race, sex, and disability status. 
And instead of expanding unemploy-
ment benefits that have been a lifeline 
for workers in my home State and 
across the country—which by the way, 
are due to expire tomorrow—Repub-
licans have slashed them. 
This bill doesn’t get us anywhere 
near where we need to be on developing 
a vaccine that is accessible and afford-
able to every person and is completely

inadequate in addressing our testing 
and contract tracing shortfalls. 
And while Democrats want schools to 
reopen for in-person learning if it can 
be done safely, the partisan Republican 
proposal 
would 
put 
students, 
edu-
cators, and communities at risk. 
Republicans need to abandon this 
dangerous one-size-fits all approach to 
reopening schools in-person and pass 
our Child Care Education and Relief 
Act, which would provide $430 billion to 
address the national child care and 
education crises during this pandemic. 
My question to Republican leaders is 
why, when things are already so hard, 
are you determined to make them 
harder for people who are already 
struggling so much? 
It is shameful, and we are going to 
keep calling you to account for it until 
workers, families, and communities get 
the support they need. 
Thank you.

IDB PRESIDENCY 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak about the campaign cur-
rently underway to select the next 
president of the Inter-American Devel-
opment Bank in September of this 
year. 
The IDB has served as the pre-
eminent development bank in the 
Americas since 1959. For more than six 
decades, it has brought together the 
United States, Canada, and our part-
ners from Latin America and the Car-
ibbean to advance an agenda for devel-
opment and inclusive economic growth 
in our hemisphere. The United States 
has proudly been a leading voice to 
strengthen the IDB’s critical mission 
in the Americas, and donors from the 
European Union to Japan and South 
Korea, have provided enduring support 
to the institution. 
In September, the IDB will hold elec-
tions to select its next president. Last 
month, the United States announced it 
would 
nominate 
Mauricio 
Claver 
Carone, the current National Security 
Council senior director for the Western 
Hemisphere, as our candidate to be the 
next president of the IDB. Since Mr. 
Claver Carone’s nomination was an-
nounced, more than 15 governments in 
the region have offered their support 
for his candidacy. These governments 
represent a wide range of ideological 
perspectives, levels of economic devel-
opment, and different historic relation-
ships with the IDB. In recent weeks, 
the Secretary General of the Organiza-
tion of American States, our hemi-
sphere’s other premier multilateral in-
stitution, offered words of support for 
Mr. Claver Carone’s candidacy. 
I have known Mr. Claver Carone for 
over two decades. During this time, Mr. 
Claver Carone has demonstrated a com-
mitment to inclusive economic devel-
opment in Latin America and the Car-
ibbean, and he has been an outspoken 
advocate for democracy and human 
rights in our hemisphere. In his more 
recent roles at the National Security 
Council, the International Monetary 
Fund, and the Treasury Department, 
he 
has 
worked 
with 
governments 
across the region and across the ideo-
logical spectrum to advance United 
States’ partnerships in the Americas. 
He has also worked to address the po-
litical, economic, and humanitarian 
crisis in Venezuela, and counter the 
agendas of governments that seek to 
counter U.S. interests in the region, 
from Cuba’s authoritarian regime to 
Putin’s Russia to China’s Government. 
Of equal importance, he has shown the 
ability to work in a bipartisan manner 
with Democrats and Republicans in the 
United States, including in the U.S. 
Congress. 
While I have been and remain an ar-
dent critic of many aspects of the 
Trump administration’s foreign policy 
towards Latin America and the Carib-
bean and I have not always agreed with 
every policy decision that Mr. Claver 
Carone has made during his service to 
our government, I recognize his con-
sistent commitment to advancing U.S. 
national security, our foreign policy 
interests, and an agenda of shared pri-
orities with our partners in the hemi-
sphere. 
For these reasons, I support Mr. 
Claver Carone’s candidacy and would 
welcome the opportunity to continue 
working with him as the next president 
of the Inter-American Development 
Bank. 
I recognize that selection of the next 
IDB president is taking place 2 months 
before the United States holds general 
elections and that some have concerns 
about the implications of this timing. 
Given that the United States is the 
IDB’s largest shareholder, the next IDB 
president must commit to working in a 
bipartisan manner with the next U.S. 
President and their administration, re-
gardless of party. This is an essential 
task for the success of the IDB. As the 
senior Democrat in the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, I would look forward 
to working with Mr. Claver Carone to 
ensure that this happens. 
As COVID–19 continues to spread 
across the Americas and severe eco-
nomic impacts follow, the IDB will 
play an absolutely essential role in the 
recovery of countries across the region. 
This makes the selection of the IDB’s 
next president of the utmost impor-
tance. The IDB needs leadership that 
can achieve consensus across the West-
ern hemisphere and set the stage for a 
decade-long recovery effort. The task 
is formidable, but I remain confident 
that the United States can and will 
play an integral part in supporting the 
IDB’s efforts and our partners in the 
region.

TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL 
MICHAEL SCOTT SCIRETTA 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I 
honor a superb leader, liaison, and war-
rior. After 3 years of service as director 
of the Navy Senate Liaison Office, 
RDML Scott Sciretta recently pro-
moted from captain to rear admiral, 
lower half. On this occasion, I believe 
it is fitting to recognize Rear Admiral 
Sciretta’s distinguished service and 
dedication to fostering the relationship 
between the U.S. Navy and this Cham-
ber. 
Rear Admiral Sciretta is a 1992 grad-
uate of the Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity. A surface warfare officer by des-
ignation, Rear Admiral Sciretta has 
led our Nation’s young men and women 
on shore and at sea, most prominently 
in command of USS Jason Dunham, 
USS Cowpens, and USS Lake Erie. The 
Navy has consistently relied upon Rear 
Admiral Sciretta for his exceptional 
leadership and unparalleled work ethic. 
Rear Admiral Sciretta has excelled 
in numerous other leadership positions 
in the Navy, most recently as the di-
rector, Navy Senate Liaison. In the 
Russell Senate Office Building and 
around 
the 
globe, 
Rear 
Admiral 
Sciretta filled the role that was ini-
tially created and held by Senator 
John McCain after his return from 
Vietnam as a Navy captain. Decades 
later, Rear Admiral Sciretta had the 
job of coordinating a weeklong series 
of logistical movements around the 
country 
that 
enabled 
present 
and 
former Members of both Chambers to 
honor a late colleague and dear friend. 
Over the course of the last few years, 
Rear Admiral Sciretta led 45 congres-
sional delegations to 35 different coun-
tries. He escorted over half of the Mem-
bers of this Chamber on travel and be-
came a trusted adviser and friend to 
many of us. I have had the pleasure of 
traveling with Rear Admiral Sciretta 
on a number of trips. He distinguished 
himself by going above and beyond the 
call pf duty to facilitate and success-
fully execute each and every trip, de-
spite any number of weather, aircraft, 
and diplomatic complications. 
Recently, Rear Admiral Sciretta de-
parted Washington for Key West, FL, 
to serve as the deputy director of Joint 
Interagency Task Force South and lead 
operations 
to 
combat 
illicit 
traf-
ficking. This Chamber will feel Rear 
Admiral Sciretta’s absence. I join 
many past and present Members of 
Congress in my gratitude and apprecia-
tion to Rear Admiral Sciretta for his 
outstanding leadership and unwavering 
support of the missions of the U.S. 
Navy. I especially recognize his patient 
and supportive family, Mrs. Sharon 
Diane 
Sciretta, 
Navy 
Lieutenant 
James Francis Sciretta and his wife, 
Ms. Delma Eylin Sciretta, and Navy 
Midshipman Adam Joseph Sciretta. I 
wish this Navy family ‘‘fair winds and 
following seas.’’

July 29, 2020 
Coastal 
Ocean 
Observing 
Systems, 
NERACOOS. During his 10 years at 
NERACOOS, Dr. Morrison has been a 
visionary in the world of ocean observ-
ing for the people of New Hampshire, 
the Northeast, and this country. I 
know I speak for so many others when 
I say that we are deeply grateful and 
thank him for his service. 
Originally from Scotland, Ru became 
a true advocate for New Hampshire 
when he began his position as an as-
sistant research professor at the Uni-
versity of New Hampshire in 2003. Dur-
ing his tenure at UNH, Ru was an inspi-
rational teacher whose work advanced 
the science of remote sensing. A pri-
mary focus of his efforts centered on 
building a better understanding of 
Great Bay, a resource that many in 
New Hampshire consider to be a cor-
nerstone of our coastal environment. 
When Ru transitioned to NERACOOS 
in 2009, he brought with him his exten-
sive knowledge of marine science and 
technology, the coastal and ocean envi-
ronment, and, most importantly, his 
collaborative nature, which was instru-
mental in establishing a successful re-
gional 
ocean 
observing 
system. 
NERACOOS, 1 of 11 regional associa-
tions of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Ob-
serving System—IOOS—addresses the 
ocean 
monitoring 
and 
forecasting 
needs of the people of the Northeast. 
As executive director of NERACOOS, 
Ru’s charisma and outgoing nature, 
coupled with his ocean science exper-
tise, allowed him to bring together sci-
entists, resource managers, fishermen, 
NGOs, and the public into a system no-
table for its espirit de corps. My staff 
and I all have many fond memories of 
joining him for boat rides on Great Bay 
to get a firsthand look at NERACOOS’s 
work on the estuary. Anyone who’s 
worked with Ru can attest to his 
warmth, wit, and self-deprecating sense 
of humor, which made working with 
him and NERACOOS a real pleasure. 
Over the past decade, Ru has grown 
the organization’s prominence and ex-
panded collaborations among its many 
users. Even more impactful, though, is 
a decade’s worth of Ru’s infectious en-
thusiasm, which invigorated the orga-
nization and its stakeholders alike. 
Under Ru’s stewardship, NERACOOS 
became a morning ritual for fishermen 
preparing for their day at sea, and with 
the formation of the Northeast Coastal 
Acidification 
Network—NECAN— 
NERACOOS has become a national 
leader 
in 
facilitating 
regional 
re-
sponses to changing ocean chemistry. 
Ru’s influence extends far beyond his 
backyard. He is the past chair of the 
IOOS Association; a member of the 
IOOS Federal Advisory Committee; 
councilor of the bi-national Gulf of 
Maine Council on the Marine Environ-
ment; board director of the Marine and 
Oceanography 
Technology 
Network; 
and science advisory board member for 
the Lake George Jefferson Project. I 
was pleased to invite him to Capitol 
Hill in 2016 to testify before the Senate 
Democratic 
Steering 
and 
Outreach 
Committee to share his expertise with 
Congress. I and my staff are greatly in-
debted to him for all of his advice and 
counsel over the years. It is truly dif-
ficult to overstate the breadth and sig-
nificance of his service. 
Ru would be the first to say that the 
foundation of his success is his family: 
his wife Ann Michelle and their chil-
dren, Alistair and Marin. I know that 
everyone at NERACOOS and through-
out the ocean observing community 
joins me in thanking Dr. Morrison and 
his family for his instrumental leader-
ship and vision. We wish him all the 
best in retirement.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL JOSEPH D. WALL 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a great American and 
an exceptional member of the U.S. Air 
Force. 
Lt. Col. Joseph ‘‘Joe’’ Wall has dis-
tinguished himself through his profes-
sional character and dedication by 
serving this Nation in uniform. A lead-
er and expert communicator, he has 
provided distinguished service to our 
country while assigned to the Air 
Force Senate Liaison Office. He is an 
outstanding leader and has been the 
perfect airman to represent the Air 
Force on Capitol Hill. Joe is a com-
mand pilot with more than 3,000 hours 
in the T–37B, T–1A, and KC–10A aircraft 
with over 100 combat and combat sup-
port missions, supporting operations 
over Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and the 
Horn of Africa. 
Throughout his career, Joe has dem-
onstrated his exceptional abilities; he 
was a ROTC distinguished graduate at 
the University of Miami, graduate of 
the Air Mobility Command Phoenix 
Mobility 
program, 
and 
he 
is 
an 
Olmsted Scholar fluent in German. 
Prior to his current assignment, Joe 
had the privilege of leading airmen as a 
squadron commander for the 79th Air 
Refueling 
Squadron 
at 
Travis 
Air 
Force Base. As a legislative liaison in 
the Air Force Senate Liaison Office 
from June 2018 to July 2020, Lieutenant 
Colonel Wall performed his duties well 
and without reservation. His strategic 
thinking 
and 
foresight 
helped 
to 
strengthen and improve our national 
security. Joe accomplished this uti-
lizing his in-depth Air Force knowledge 
with numerous engagements between 
Congress and the Department of the 
Air Force. 
During this assignment, Joe con-
ducted congressional engagements to 
provide Members of Congress and staff 
insights into the development of the 
‘‘Air Force We Need’’ plan required to 
support the National Defense Strategy. 
He also actively engaged Members of 
Congress regarding the fielding and 
production of the KC–46A Pegasus 
Tanker. Last year, Joe led the effort to 
make sure that the New Hampshire 
Congressional Delegation was front and 
center to receive the first KC–46A at 
Pease Air National Guard Base. 
Joe organized dozens of direct en-
gagements between senior leaders at 
the Department of the Air Force and 
Members of Congress in order to con-
vey important information on behalf of 
the Air Force. All of these conversa-
tions and engagements helped stake-
holders understand the defense equities 
and the impact on national security. 
Due to his direct involvement, Mem-
bers of Congress were able to make in-
formed decisions and ensure the De-
partment of the Air Force was properly 
resourced. 
After serving in this important role 
for the past 2 years, Lieutenant Colo-
nel Wall will move to his next assign-
ment, 
the 
Dwight 
D. 
Eisenhower 
School at the National Defense Univer-
sity. Joe, his wife Trysta, and their son 
Tavin have sacrificed much as a family 
in service to our Nation. I am thankful 
for Joe’s service and his work with my 
office and the Senate over the past 2 
years on issues important to the State 
of New Hampshire and this great Na-
tion. I salute him, an American patriot 
whose service has kept our country 
safe and strong. Thank you.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING HYDRA ENGINEER-
ING AND CONSTRUCTION, LLC 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-
try. It is my privilege to recognize a 
woman-owned small business known 
for its excellence in industry and envi-
ronmental stewardship. This week, it is 
my pleasure to honor Hydra Engineer-
ing 
and 
Construction, 
LLC, 
of 
Crawfordville, FL, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
In 
2008, 
Leslie 
Hope 
established 
Hydra Engineering after she left her 
position as a partner in an engineering 
firm to pursue her dream of being a 
small business owner. After graduating 
from the University of South Florida, 
Leslie started planning how to open 
her own engineering company. Leslie 
turned to her local Small Business De-
velopment Center where she enrolled 
Hydra Engineering in the U.S. Small 
Business Administration’s 8(a) business 
development program. This program 
provides resources, mentorship, and 
training 
to 
help 
small 
businesses 
owned by socially and economically 
disadvantaged 
persons 
compete 
for 
government contracts. 
Over the next 12 years, Leslie re-
branded her enterprise as Hydra Engi-
neering and Construction to reflect its 
growth and expansion. She completed 
the 8(a) program, was certified by the 
State of Florida as a Minority Business 
Enterprise and as a Disadvantaged 
Business Enterprise by the U.S. De-
partment of Transportation. 
Hydra Engineering has worked for 
several Florida private companies and

agencies, including the Florida Fish 
and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 
They have completed projects in 16 
other States, working for the National 
Park Service, the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, and the U.S. Forest Service. 
For their entrepreneurship, innova-
tion and environmental stewardship, 
Hydra Engineering has been recognized 
by local, State, and industry organiza-
tions. In 2018, they were nominated as 
a GrowFL Florida Company to Watch, 
recognizing their status as a Floridian 
second-stage company demonstrating 
high marketplace performance and in-
novation. As one of the world’s fastest 
growing USF-alumni owned or led busi-
nesses, Hydra Engineering earned the 
USF Fast 56 Award in 2016 and 2018. Ad-
ditionally, Leslie was nominated as the 
2011 SBA North Florida Region Small 
Business Person of the Year. She also 
sits on the Florida Agricultural and 
Mechanical University-Florida State 
University Department of Civil and En-
vironmental 
Engineering 
Advisory 
Board. 
Like many small businesses across 
Florida, Hydra was impacted by the 
coronavirus pandemic. When the U.S. 
Small 
Business 
Administration 
launched the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, Leslie applied for funding. The 
PPP provides forgivable loans to im-
pacted small businesses and nonprofits 
who maintain their payroll during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Thanks to the 
PPP, Hydra Engineering is able to sup-
port its employees, many who work 
and reside in Wakulla County. 
Hydra Engineering and Construction 
demonstrates how small firms use SBA 
resources to grow. I applaud their com-
mitment to excellence and unique role 
in supporting Florida’s critical infra-
structure. 
Congratulations to Leslie and the en-
tire team, I look forward to watching 
your continued growth and success in 
Florida.∑

REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13441 OF AUGUST 1, 2007, WITH 
RESPECT TO LEBANON—PM 57 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Leb-
anon declared in Executive Order 13441 
of August 1, 2007, is to continue in ef-
fect beyond August 1, 2020. 
Certain ongoing activities, such as 
Iran’s continuing arms transfers to 
Hizballah—which include increasingly 
sophisticated weapons systems—serve 
to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, 
contribute to political and economic 
instability in the region, and continue 
to constitute an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
For this reason, I have determined that 
it is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13441 with respect to Lebanon.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–217. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress and the 
Louisiana congressional delegation to re-
move the revenue sharing cap on the Gulf of 
Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) of 
2006 for Gulf producing states and to take 
such actions as are necessary to rectify the 
federal revenue sharing inequities between 
coastal and interior energy producing states; 
to the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 11 
Whereas, many of the energy resources en-
joyed by the entire United States are de-
pendent upon the health of Gulf Coast eco-
systems which provide access to those re-
sources and related infrastructure and pro-
tection for communities that house its work-
force; and 
Whereas, Louisiana is home to thirty per-
cent of the nation’s wetlands and ninety per-
cent of its wetlands loss, a crisis that im-
pacts communities, ecosystems, and the very 
economic engines that contribute to the na-
tion’s energy security; and 
Whereas, under the Mineral Lands Leasing 
Act of 1920, fifty percent of the mineral reve-
nues generated from federal lands onshore 
are shared with the host state to offset im-
pacts of the federal mineral development; 
this includes royalties, severance taxes, and 
bonuses, all under no cap: and 
Whereas, under GOMESA. Gulf producing 
states, including Texas, Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi, and Alabama, share only thirty- 
seven and one half percent of the mineral 
revenues generated by oil and gas production 
from active leases since 2006 in federal 
waters and the Outer Continental Shelf 
(OCS); and 
Whereas, currently annual GOMESA reve-
nues for Gulf producing states are capped at 
three hundred seventy-five million dollars 
per year, apportioned to the mineral activity 
supported by each Gulf state; and 
Whereas, according to the most recent 
data from the United States Energy Informa-
tion Administration (EIA), Louisiana, within 
its territorial boundaries, is the ninth larg-
est producer of oil in the United States, but 
it is the second largest oil producer in the 
country if oil production from adjacent fed-
eral waters is included; and 
Whereas, according to the most recent 
data from the EIA, Louisiana, within its ter-
ritorial boundaries, is the fourth largest pro-

already permitted, more LNG facilities than 
any other state in the country, and the Lou-
isiana Offshore Oil Port, the nation’s only 
deepwater oil port, Louisiana plays an essen-
tial role in the movement of natural gas and 
crude oil from the United States Gulf Coast 
region to markets throughout the country 
and the world; and 
Whereas, the majority of the oil and gas 
production from the Gulf of Mexico enters 
the United States through coastal Louisiana 
with all of the infrastructure necessary to 
receive and transport such production; and 
Whereas, because Louisiana is losing more 
coastal wetlands than any other state in the 
country, in 2006 the people of Louisiana over-
whelmingly 
approved 
a 
constitutional 
amendment dedicating revenues received 
from OCS oil and gas activity through 
GOMESA to the Coastal Protection and Res-
toration Fund for the purposes of coastal 
protection, including conservation, coastal 
restoration, hurricane protection, and infra-
structure directly impacted by coastal wet-
land losses; and 
Whereas, the state of Louisiana has devel-
oped, through a science-based and stake-
holder-involved process, a ‘‘Comprehensive 
Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast’’ which 
identifies and prioritizes the most efficient 
and effective projects in order to meet the 
state’s critical coastal protection and res-
toration needs and has received many acco-
lades from the country’s scientific commu-
nity; and 
Whereas, the Coastal Protection and Res-
toration Authority is making great progress 
implementing the projects contained in the 
‘‘Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustain-
able Coast’’ with all available funding, 
projects that are essential to the protection 
of the infrastructure that is critical to the 
energy needs of the United States; and 
Whereas, for the state of Louisiana and our 
coastal 
parishes, 
the 
GOMESA 
revenue 
stream is a critical recurring source of rev-
enue that allows our state and coastal par-
ishes to address our coastal protection and 
restoration needs to support our working 
coast. Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress and the Louisiana congressional 
delegation to remove the revenue sharing 
cap on the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security 
Act of 2006 for Gulf producing states and to 
take such actions as are necessary to rectify 
the federal revenue sharing inequities be-
tween coastal and interior energy producing 
states. 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–218. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress and the 
Louisiana congressional delegation to take 
such actions as are necessary to clarify and 
provide guidance regarding the ability of 
freshwater fisherman or fishery-related busi-
nesses affected by the COVID–19 pandemic to 
receive assistance funding from CARES Act 
dollars; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 16 
Whereas, three hundred million dollars in 
fisheries assistance funding has been pro-
vided 
by 
Section 
12005 
of 
the 
federal 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act: and 
Whereas, the United States Secretary of 
Commerce, through the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, 
has allocated fourteen million seven hundred 
eighty-five thousand two hundred forty-four 
dollars with the specific purpose of assisting 
Louisiana commercial fishermen, charter 
businesses, qualified aquaculture operations, 
subsistence users, processors, and other fish-
ery-related 
businesses 
affected 
by 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic through direct aid pay-
ments; and 
Whereas, the United States Department of 
Commerce’s 
determination 
has 
limited 
qualified applicants to those who participate 
in various sectors of coastal and marine fish-
eries, 
thereby 
precluding 
eligibility 
for 
freshwater fisheries; and 
Whereas, Louisiana has thousands of com-
mercially licensed freshwater fishermen; and 
Whereas, in 2019 the freshwater fisheries 
harvest, including wild caught crawfish, ac-
counted for a dockside value of nearly twen-
ty million dollars, illustrating how vital 
freshwater fisheries are to the people and the 
economy of Louisiana; and 
Whereas, the full scale of the economic im-
pact of the COVID–19 pandemic on fresh-
water fisheries has not yet been determined; 
however, these fisheries have been directly 
impacted; and 
Whereas, the impacts to freshwater fish-
eries and other Louisiana fisheries partici-
pants result in individuals who would benefit 
greatly from a direct payment program; and 
Whereas, the Louisiana Department of 
Wildlife and Fisheries is charged with devel-
oping programs to expend these funds; and 
Whereas, the Legislature of Louisiana sup-
ports the development of direct payment 
programs to industry participants: Therefore 
be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress and the Louisiana congressional 
delegation to take such actions as are nec-
essary to clarify and provide guidance re-
garding the ability of freshwater fishermen 
or fishery-related businesses affected by the 
COVID–19 pandemic to receive assistance 
funding from CARES Act dollars; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–219. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress to extend 
certifications for an 8(a) business by one ad-
ditional year if the business was certified by 
January 1, 2020; to the Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 22 
Whereas, the 8(a) Business Development 
Program (program) is a business assistance 
program that exists to level the playing field 
for small businesses owned by socially and 
economically disadvantaged people or enti-
ties; and 
Whereas, the program offers a broad scope 
of assistance to businesses that are at least 
fifty-one percent owned and controlled by so-
cially and economically disadvantaged indi-
viduals whose personal net worth is two hun-
dred fifty thousand dollars or less, and who 
own four million dollars or less in assets; and 
Whereas, the 8(a) program is an essential 
instrument for helping socially and economi-
cally disadvantaged entrepreneurs gain ac-
cess to the economic mainstream or Amer-
ican society and helps thousands of aspiring 
entrepreneurs to gain a foothold in govern-
ment contracting; and 
Whereas, beginning as early as March 11, 
2020, many states declared a public health 
emergency as a result of the imminent 
threat posed by the outbreak of a respiratory 
disease caused by a novel coronavirus known 
commonly as COVID–19; and 
Whereas, the Centers for Disease Control 
suggested aggressive measures for limiting 
the possible interaction of the public with 
individuals who are exposed to or test posi-
tive for the virus; and 
Whereas, the response by many states to 
the contagion of COVID–19 required a large 
scale disruption of the state economies as 
many businesses were closed in order to pro-
tect the public health and to prevent a spike 
in demand for health care services that 
would have overwhelmed the capacity of the 
health care system to provide services; and 
Whereas, a participant in the certified 8(a) 
Business Development Program receives a 
program term of nine years from the date of 
the Small Business Administration’s ap-
proval letter certifying admission to the pro-
gram, including four years in the develop-
mental stage and five years in the transi-
tional stage; and 
Whereas, efforts to slow or disrupt the 
spread of COVID–19 has resulted in the tem-
porary closure of many 8(a) certified busi-
nesses; and 
Whereas, temporary closures of 8(a) cer-
tified businesses may have prevented these 
businesses from reaching the program goal of 
maintaining a balance between their com-
mercial and government business, and this 
may result in poor performance reviews, in-
complete business planning, and unfair eval-
uations due to the unforeseen and unavoid-
able consequences of COVID–19: Therefore be 
it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
memorializes the Congress of the United 
States to extend certifications for 8(a) busi-
nesses for one additional year beyond the 
requisite nine-year term, thereby allowing 
those 8(a) certified businesses that are in the 
first four years of certification to remain in 
the developmental stage an additional year 
if the business was certified before January 
1, 2020, and similarly, the 8(a) certified busi-
nesses currently in the five-year transitional 
stage would be extended by one additional 
year; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the secretary of the United 
States Senate and the clerk of the United 
States House of Representatives and to each 
member of the Louisiana delegation to the 
United States Congress. 
POM–220. A joint resolution adopted by the 
legislature of the State of Colorado urging 
the Department of Defense to permanently 
base the United States Space Command 
(USSPACECOM) in Colorado; to the Com-
mittee on Armed Services. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 20–018 
Whereas, Our nation and the world have 
significantly benefitted from technological 
and scientific advances resulting from space 
exploration and aerospace activities, and 
Colorado is paving the way for new discov-
eries in the frontiers of space by having a 
rich history in aerospace development and 
being at the forefront of space travel, explo-
ration, and aerospace research; and 
Whereas, Colorado is ranked number one in 
the country for aerospace employment with 
a strategically located aerospace center of 
excellence with over 30,000 Coloradans di-
rectly employed in aerospace and a payroll 
exceeding $3.9 billion; an aerospace cluster 
that supports more than 190,000 jobs; and 7.5 
percent of Colorado’s labor income derived 
from Department of Defense (DoD) employ-
ment, and 6.5 percent of the state’s gross 
state product that is DoD-related; and 
Whereas, Colorado is a leader for business 
growth, with the number one economy in the

country in 2019 according to the U.S. News & 
World Report and ranked fourth in high-tech 
employment and fourth on the State Tech-
nology and Science Index, supporting Colo-
rado’s position as a top aerospace state econ-
omy and workforce; and 
Whereas, Colorado’s aerospace industry is 
home to a broad range of companies that cre-
ate products and systems for commercial, 
military, and civil space applications, such 
as spacecraft, launch vehicles, satellites, 
command and control software, sensors, and 
navigation operations. These companies in-
clude Ball Aerospace, Boeing, DigitalGlobe, 
Harris Corporation, Lockheed Martin Space 
Systems, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Si-
erra Nevada Corporation, Teledyne Brown 
Engineering, and United Launch Alliance, 
which make up the aerospace sector; and 
Whereas, Colorado is uniting global part-
ners around the world to ensure space access 
for developing nations via the first planned 
United Nations space mission. Sierra Nevada 
Corporation, located in Louisville, Colorado, 
together with the United Nations Office for 
Outer Space Affairs, will use its Dream Chas-
er spacecraft to allow developing countries 
the opportunity to develop and fly micro-
gravity payloads for an extended duration in 
orbit; and 
Whereas, Colorado has an existing edu-
cated workforce, ranked second in the nation 
with residents with a bachelor’s degree or 
higher, and a pipeline of higher institutions 
to sustain future growth. We are home to the 
United States Air Force Academy and many 
colleges and universities, including the Uni-
versity of Colorado Boulder and the Univer-
sity of Colorado Colorado Springs, Colorado 
School of Mines, Colorado State University, 
Metropolitan State University of Denver, 
University of Denver, Colorado Mesa Univer-
sity, and Fort Lewis College. Altogether, 
they provide access to world-class aerospace- 
related degrees and offer aerospace compa-
nies one of the country’s most educated 
workforces; and 
Whereas, Colorado is home to some of the 
most prestigious research institutions, such 
as the Laboratory for Atmospheric and 
Space Physics (LASP) at the University of 
Colorado Boulder. It began in 1948, a decade 
before NASA, and is the world’s only re-
search institute to have sent instruments to 
all eight planets and to Pluto, combining all 
aspects of space exploration through science, 
engineering, mission operations, and sci-
entific data analysis; and 
Whereas, Colorado is also home to the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion’s (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction 
Center, a world-leading center of predictions 
of the solar and near-Earth space environ-
ment and the nation’s official source of 
watches, warnings, and alerts of incoming 
solar storms, using satellite observations to 
protect and save lives and property; and 
Whereas, Colorado is strategically located 
at the center of our national and space de-
fense. We are the home to five key strategic 
military commands: North American Aero-
space Defense Command (NORAD), United 
States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), 
United States Strategic Command’s Joint 
Functional Component Command for Space 
(JFCC Space) Missile Warning Center, the 
United States Air Force Space Command, 
and the United States Army Space and Mis-
sile Defense Command/Army Forces Stra-
tegic Command; and five military installa-
tions, including United States Air Force 
bases Buckley, Cheyenne Mountain, Peter-
son, and Schriever and Fort Carson Army 
base; and 
Whereas, The 460th Space Wing at Buckley 
Air Force Base provides operational com-
mand and control of three constellations of 
space-based infrared missile warning sys-
tems, has been defending America continu-
ously since 1970, and is a critical part of 
global defense and national security; and 
Whereas, Colorado is already the center for 
United States military space operations and 
strategy. According to the Colorado Space 
Coalition (CSC), the state’s military com-
mands are the primary customers for space- 
based research, development, acquisitions, 
and operations, representing nearly 90 per-
cent of space-related expenditure by the 
military. Moving the United States Space 
Command to any other location than Colo-
rado will be incredibly disruptive to the Na-
tional Defense Strategy. In addition, it will 
cause a major upheaval in existing infra-
structure and jobs in the state, which will 
result in higher costs and less efficient out-
comes for the United States military; and 
Whereas, Colorado leads the charge in 
bringing current and future global posi-
tioning system (GPS) assets to life, a service 
provided free to the world by Air Force 
Space Command in Colorado Springs. From 
the operation of GPS satellites by Schriever 
Air Force Base to GPS III, the most powerful 
GPS satellite to date being designed and 
built by Lockheed Martin and launched by 
United Launch Alliance with Raytheon de-
veloping the command and control capabili-
ties, and with companies such as Boeing, 
Harris Corporation, Braxton Technologies, 
and Infinity Systems Engineering also sup-
porting GPS development and operations 
from locations in Colorado, our GPS tech-
nologies enable an integral part of our global 
economy to have an incalculable impact that 
has improved the everyday lives of billions 
of people around the world; and 
Whereas, Various organizations are key to 
Colorado’s prominence in aerospace, such as 
the Colorado Space Coalition, a group of in-
dustry stakeholders working to make Colo-
rado a center of excellence for aerospace; the 
Colorado Space Business Roundtable, work-
ing to bring together aerospace stakeholders 
from the industry, government, and aca-
demia for roundtable discussions and busi-
ness development and to encourage grass-
roots citizen participation in aerospace 
issues; the Colorado chapter of Citizens for 
Space Exploration, whose mission is to pro-
mote better understanding of aerospace and 
its importance in our economy and daily 
lives, as well as to promote the importance 
of human space exploration; Manufacturer’s 
Edge, a statewide manufacturing assistance 
center that encourages the strength and 
competitiveness of Colorado manufacturers 
by providing on-site technical assistance 
through coaching, training, and consulting, 
by providing collaboration-focused industry 
programs, and by leveraging government, 
university, and economic development part-
nerships; and the Space Foundation, founded 
in 1983, with its world headquarters in Colo-
rado Springs, Colorado, which holds an an-
nual Space Symposium, bringing together 
civil, commercial, and national security 
space leaders from around the world to dis-
cuss, address, and plan for the future of 
space: Now, therefore, 
Be it resolved by the Senate of the Seventy- 
second General Assembly of the State of Colo-
rado, the House of Representatives concurring 
herein: 
That we, the members of the Colorado Gen-
eral Assembly: 
(1) Recognizing Colorado’s unique blend of 
military installations and major commands, 
private aerospace companies, academic and 
research institutions, and government enti-
ties, and the valuable synergies this eco-
system produces, strongly urge the Depart-
ment of Defense to keep the existing United 
States Space Combatant Command in Colo-
rado; 
(2) Furthermore, we strongly urge the De-
partment of Defense to permanently base the 
United 
States 
Space 
Command 
(USSPACECOM) in Colorado, recognizing 
that Colorado provides the existing com-
mand structure, base infrastructure, and 
communications platforms necessary to suc-
cessfully host additional national security 
initiatives and ensure coordination of efforts 
without committing restrictive additional 
funds; 
(3) Proudly express that Colorado has deep 
ties with the Department of Defense and im-
mense patriotic commitment to providing 
for the nation’s security and bolstering our 
defense; 
(4) Express our most sincere and deepest 
appreciation to our service members and ci-
vilian employees working in and supporting 
military and civilian aerospace companies, 
military installations, and civil organiza-
tions in Colorado; and

SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 124 
Whereas, The COVID–19 Pandemic has led 
to an unprecedented economic crisis in the 
United States. Governors across the country, 
including 
Michigan 
Governor 
Gretchen 
Whitmer, have ordered non-essential busi-
nesses and schools to temporarily close and 
mandated that residents do not leave their 
homes, except for specific essential activi-
ties, in order to limit the spread of COVID– 
19 and save lives; and 
Whereas, The cost of preventing the spread 
of COVID–19 and protecting Michigan’s citi-
zens has been a dramatic decline in state tax 
revenue. As businesses are shut down and 
residents are out of work, the projected rev-
enue from income, sales, and other taxes has 
dropped precipitously. In Michigan, pro-
jected General Fund revenue has been re-
duced by $2 billion and projected School Aid 
Fund revenue has declined by $1.2 billion for 
Fiscal Year 2020. Even as businesses re-open 
and restrictions on movement are lifted, the 
economic fallout from fighting COVID–19 
will remain. Significant budget holes are 
projected in Fiscal Year 2021; and 
Whereas, Local governments and schools 
are also facing a dire fiscal situation. In ad-
dition to falling revenues from property, ca-
sino, and local income taxes, the fall in state 
revenue may necessitate severe cuts to state 
revenue sharing to local governments. Simi-
larly, the substantial shortfall in School Aid 
Fund revenue may lead to similar cuts in 
state funding for local school districts; and 
Whereas, While government revenues have 
declined, the costs of providing some critical 
public services has increased as a result of 
the Pandemic. About 14,000 ‘‘essential’’ state 
employees are eligible for extra pay on each 
paycheck during the crisis. Several munici-
palities have enacted hazard pay for employ-
ees who are working during the crisis. In 
Wayne County, sheriff’s deputies are receiv-
ing an additional $30 per day worked with ad-
ditional hazard pay available for overtime 
shifts; and 
Whereas, While Congress has already en-
acted some federal aid for states and local 
governments, its limited scope and restric-
tions will be insufficient to weather the ef-
fects of the Pandemic. Michigan is currently 
expected to receive about $3.8 billion from 
the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security (CARES) Act, but the funds 
may only be used for expenses associated 
with the Pandemic. In addition, since the act 
only provides direct aid to local govern-
ments with a population exceeding 500,000, 
only a handful of Michigan’s nearly 2,000 
local units of government will be eligible for 
direct payments from the federal govern-
ment; and 
Whereas, Increasing the flexibility states 
have when using CARES Act aid will help 
mitigate these dramatic cuts. Allowing 
states and local governments to use CARES 
Act funding for costs that are not directly 
associated with the Pandemic will help to 
address their projected revenue shortfalls. 
Providing flexibility will ensure aid is avail-
able to local governments that were left out 
of the CARES Act and further address state 
and local budget shortfalls; Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we memori-
alize the Congress of the United States to 
help the state of Michigan, schools, and local 
governments address revenue shortfalls dur-
ing the COVID–19 Pandemic; and be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent of the United States Senate, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–223. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress

Act of 1970; to the Committee on the Judici-

HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 151 
Whereas, Despite federal law criminalizing 
marijuana, many states have exercised their 
authority to enact marijuana laws that re-
flect the needs and interests of their citizens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4585 
July 29, 2020 
Currently, the state of Michigan is among a 
majority of states that have chosen to regu-
late marijuana under state law; and 
Whereas, The federal government’s lack of 
clarity and inconsistency in its interpreta-
tion of the legality of marijuana under the 
Controlled Substances Act of 1970 has cre-
ated confusion and uncertainty for states 
legislating marijuana operations. This, in 
turn, affects law enforcement, banking, tax-
ation, and zoning; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge the Congress of the United 
States to clarify its position on the legality 
of marijuana under the Controlled Sub-
stances Act of 1970; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation.

Common Council of the City of Syracuse, 
New York, urging the President of the

use of force policies through federal legisla-
tion; to the Committee on the Judiciary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4594 
July 29, 2020 
Mostly, Lorna Breen was a beloved, 
compassionate, and demanding doctor. 
A colleague said of her: ‘‘She had some-
thing that was a little bit different and 
that was this optimism that her per-
sistent effort will save lives.’’ 
Dr. Breen suffered from something 
very common among health profes-
sionals—the deep stress of dealing with 
patients day in and day out—helping 
them, 
worrying 
about 
them, 
cele-
brating with them, praying for them, 
and mourning for them. 
Healthcare 
professionals 
routinely 
experience high levels of stress. As 
many as 45 to 55 percent of this critical 
workforce suffers from burnout. Physi-
cians have the highest rate of death by 
suicide of any profession in this coun-
try, with a suicide rate more than 
twice that of the general population. 
That was the case before COVID–19. 
In November 2019, Dr. Breen and 
three colleagues published a short arti-
cle in the American Journal of Emer-
gency Medicine titled: ‘‘Clinician burn-
out and its association with team- 
based care in the Emergency Depart-
ment.’’ The article that she coauthored 
begins this way: 
Recent work has noted the alarming preva-
lence of clinician burnout among providers, 
particularly among acute care physicians. 
Burnout is characterized by emotional ex-
haustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive 
weariness, which may lead to feelings of de-
personalization 
and 
reduced 
accomplish-
ment. 
The article went on to describe how 
staffing models—in this case, the use of 
fixed working teams—could mitigate 
the effects of stress on staff and also 
improve patient outcomes. Within just 
a few months of the publication of this 
article, healthcare professionals like 
Dr. Breen, already dealing with high 
stress 
levels, 
faced 
a 
new 
foe: 
coronavirus. 
Dr. Breen’s hospital was overrun by 
the virus in March and April, as were 
others in New York, as are others in 
this country. By late March, the Allen, 
a small community hospital serving a 
low-income population in Northern 
Manhattan, was blitzed with an emer-
gency department clogged with nearly 
three times its normal number of pa-
tients. Dr. Breen shared the sense of 
anxiety now understood by the whole 
country: ‘‘People I work with are so 
confused by all the mixed messages and 
constantly 
changing 
instructions.’’ 
And then Dr. Breen got the virus her-
self, coming down with fever and ex-
haustion on March 18 and quarantining 
in her New York City apartment as she 
tried to recover. While she was trying 
to recover, she was texting her col-
leagues to see if they were OK. She was 
trying to help them find supplies that 
they could buy to use at the hospital. 
Finally, she returned to work on 
April 1, and the situation in her emer-
gency room, her hospital, her city, was 
even grimmer. Her sister, Jennifer 
Breen Feist, described what Lorna 
faced. 
When [Lorna] returned to the hospital, she 
was confronted by an overwhelming, relent-
less number of incredibly sick patients. She 
and her colleagues worked 24/7 during the 
peak in New York with limited personal pro-
tective equipment, insufficient supplies, not 
enough beds, not enough help. Many of her 
colleagues were out on medical furlough. She 
told me patients were dying in the waiting 
rooms and hallways. . . . There was so much 
suffering, so much death. 
During the peak of the crisis in New 
York City, nearly a quarter of all pa-
tients 
admitted 
to 
the 
Allen 
for 
COVID–19 would die. Dr. Breen mes-
saged her Bible study group: ‘‘I’m 
drowning right now—may be AWOL for 
a while.’’ She kept right on working. 
By mid-April, Dr. Breen reached out 
for help to deal with the stress she was 
feeling by talking to colleagues and 
family. She admitted that she had 
thought about hurting herself. She told 
one friend: 
I couldn’t help anyone. I couldn’t do any-
thing. I just wanted to help people and I 
couldn’t do anything. 
Dr. Breen was admitted to a psy-
chiatric hospital for 11 days and went 
home when she was discharged to be 
with her family in Charlottesville to 
recover, and on April 26, Dr. Breen died 
by suicide, leaving no note. 
Dr. 
Breen 
was 
a 
victim 
of 
coronavirus, even though her death is 
not counted among the 151,000 people 
who have succumbed to the virus. But 
she was also a victim of another condi-
tion that is a preventable condition 
that affects our healthcare profes-
sionals. We place enormous demands 
upon our healers. Our society, includ-
ing the medical profession itself, does 
not do enough to recognize the real 
cost that the work inflicts upon the 
mental health of our caregivers. Per-
haps even our use of the term ‘‘hero,’’ 
meant as the highest praise, subtly 
communicates an expectation that our 
healers must be strong superheroes, 
placed high on a pedestal by society, 
thereby making it even more difficult 
for a caregiver to admit vulnerability 
and simply ask for help. 
Loice Swisher, an emergency room 
physician in Philadelphia, puts it this 
way: 
We don’t want to be seen as a weak link. 
We don’t want to be seen as incompetent or 
place an extra burden on our colleagues. It’s 
almost like you’re being kicked off the is-
land—you don’t belong any more—if you 
admit to [needing help]. 
It is still common practice in this 
country for State medical boards and 
hospitals to ask doctors seeking licens-
ing and credentialing whether they 
have ever been treated for depression 
or other mental illness. This heightens 
the barriers to asking for help when we 
should be making it easier to do so. 
Lorna’s sister Jennifer attests to this: 
And when [Lorna] became so overworked 
and despondent that she was unable to move, 
do you know what she was worried about? 
Her job. She was worried that she would lose 
her medical license, or be ostracized by her 
colleagues because she was suffering burnout 
due to her work on the front lines of the 
Covid19 crisis. She was afraid to get help. 
Lorna’s worries were not unusual. A 
2019 survey of physicians by the Amer-
ican Medical Association showed that 
nearly 40 percent of surveyed physi-
cians are wary about seeking mental 
health counseling, while another 12 
percent indicate that they would only 
do so in secret. 
Dr. Breen’s family is devastated by 
her passing, but they are honoring her 
by advocating for the cause of a more 
humane profession, one in which men-
tal health challenges are acknowl-
edged, mental health resources are 
available, and the healer accessing 
those services is encouraged. 
I am proud today to introduce the Dr. 
Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Pro-
tection Act, together with my col-
leagues, Senators YOUNG, REED, and 
CASSIDY. The act aims to reduce and 
prevent suicide, burnout, and other 
mental and behavioral health condi-
tions among healthcare professionals. 
In particular, the act would establish 
grants for training healthcare profes-
sionals, students, and residents with 
strategies to improve their mental 
well-being and job satisfaction; iden-
tify and disseminate evidence-based 
best practices for combating burnout 
and suicide; establish a national edu-
cation and awareness campaign tar-
geting healthcare professionals to en-
courage them to seek support and 
treatment for mental and behavioral 
health concerns; create grants for em-
ployee education, peer support pro-
gramming, and mental and behavioral 
health treatment with a priority for 
providers in COVID–19 hotspots; and 
initiate a comprehensive study on 
healthcare professional mental health 
needs, including the impact of COVID– 
19 on our providers, that can produce 
recommendations for all levels of gov-
ernment and the medical professions 
themselves. 
We introduced this bill mindful of 
the many priorities that are currently 
being discussed while we negotiate our 
continuing response to the Nation’s 
coronavirus challenge. It is our hope 
that this bill might make it into the 
next COVID–19 bill as a tribute to 
Lorna Breen and so many like her. 
How should we honor the work and 
sacrifice of a Lorna Breen? How do we 
honor those healthcare frontline work-
ers whom we call heroes every day? 
How do we recognize the tremendous 
work they are doing and also the tre-
mendous burden that they carry? Let’s 
pass this bill and show that we care 
about our healers and are committed 
to providing them the resources and 
the culture they need to keep healing.

S4595 
July 29, 2020 
my top priorities for Southern Cali-
fornia. The wastewater, trash and sedi-
ment that continues to flow into San 
Diego and Imperial Counties is a dan-
ger to public health and our economy 
and it must be addressed. 
This legislation is a key piece of ad-
dressing this decades-long issue. 
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS 
Polluted water from the Tijuana and 
New Rivers flows north across the bor-
der into the United States causing un-
sanitary water conditions, pollution 
and beach closures across Southern 
California. It also jeopardizes military 
training exercises for Navy Seals in 
Camp Pendleton. 
Three-quarters of the 1,700-square- 
mile Tijuana River watershed lies in 
Mexico. However, the watershed, along 
with all its pollutants, drains into San 
Diego County and the Tijuana River 
Valley. 
IMPACTS OF THE WATER POLLUTION 
In addition to jeopardizing human 
health and safety, two of the most 
drastic effects from this cross-border 
water pollution are harm to wildlife 
and damage to the tourism industry, 
integral to Southern Californian com-
munities. 
Pollution from Mexico harms sen-
sitive areas that provide critical habi-
tat for more than 300 species of birds as 
well as marine animals like leopard 
sharks and bottlenose dolphins, includ-
ing: Tijuana River’s National Estua-
rine 
Research 
Reserve, 
the 
River 
Mouth State Marine Conservation Area 
and River Valley Regional Park Pre-
serve. 
The beaches in the region are vital to 
San Diego’s tourism economy. Beaches 
in the communities of Coronado and 
Imperial Beach have been closed for 
more than 200 days this year alone due 
to pollution. 
Health and safety of residents and 
workers are also at risk. In recent 
years, local Border Patrol union offi-
cials reported that 80 officers suffered 
from contamination, rashes, infections, 
chemical burns and lung irritation due 
to toxic cross-border flows. 
The harmful effects of pollution in 
the Tijuana River Valley on our resi-
dents, businesses, economy and envi-
ronment are simply unacceptable. 
CURRENT STATUS 
In February 2020, the Government 
Accountability Office issued a com-
prehensive 
report, 
‘‘International 
Boundary Water Commission: Opportu-
nities Exist to Address Water Quality 
Problems.’’ My office worked closely 
with the GAO to utilize their findings 
to craft meaningful change through 
this legislation. 
Simultaneously, we were able to se-
cure $300 million in the U.S.-Mexico- 
Canada trade agreement to address pol-
lution in the Tijuana River Valley Wa-
tershed. 
With significant funding and detailed 
findings by the GAO investigation, we 
developed this legislation in concert 
with federal, state and local agency 
input. 
WHAT THE BILL DOES 
The Border Water Quality Restora-
tion and Protection Act includes some 
key reforms to advance concrete solu-
tions. 
One of the problems is that no one 
agency is in charge of this problem. A 
whole range of agencies—EPA, Inter-
national Boundary and Water Commis-
sion, State Department, Department of 
Homeland Security, Customs and Bor-
der Protection, Defense Department— 
all have jurisdiction or interest in this 
international issue. 
What we need is one agency in 
charge, taking input from the others so 
decisions can be made. This approach is 
similar to other large, regional envi-
ronmental challenges like the Great 
Lakes, Gulf of Mexico, Everglades and 
Chesapeake Bay. Here in California, we 
have also seen great success with this 
model of interagency coordination at 
Lake Tahoe. 
Here’s how the bill would work: 
The EPA would be officially named 
the agency with overall control of this 
effort. 
The EPA, along with its federal, 
state and local partners, would be di-
rected to identify a list of priority 
projects. It also would be authorized to 
accept and distribute funds to build, 
operate and maintain those projects. 
Would permanently authorize the 
Border Water Infrastructure Program 
to manage storm water runoff and 
water reuse projects. 
State and local authorities would 
also be authorized to contribute fund-
ing to federal projects, which is cur-
rently not allowed. 
The 
International 
Boundary 
and 
Water Commission would be authorized 
to mitigate storm water from Mexico 
and the pollution that comes with it 
and is required to construct, operate 
and maintain projects on the priority 
list developed by the agencies within 
the U.S. that improve water quality. 
CONCLUSION 
We need a new and comprehensive ap-
proach to this issue that has plagued 
border communities for too long. This 
bill creates a formal process to con-
sider effective, long-term solutions and 
additional wastewater infrastructure 
to mitigate cross-border pollution and 
I hope the Senate can move on this bill 
quickly. 
I want to thank California Environ-
mental Protection Agency, California 
Natural Resources Agency, San Diego 
and Imperial counties, cities of Impe-
rial Beach and Coronado, Mayor of 
Chula 
Vista, 
Mary 
Casillas 
Salas, 
Mayor of San Diego, Kevin Faulconer, 
and the Port of San Diego for sup-
porting this legislation. These commu-
nities, and others, have been nega-
tively impacted by this issue for far 
too long. 
It’s past time that we finally solve 
this problem to safeguard local health 
and economic growth. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
Floor. 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. BENNET): 
S. 4361. A bill to automatically ex-
tend and adjust enhanced unemploy-
ment assistance for the duration of the 
COVID–19 emergency and economic cri-
sis, and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, the unem-
ployment crisis we are facing due to 
the pandemic has devastated the lives 
of tens of millions of Americans—many 
of whom may not see their jobs come 
back for the foreseeable future. The ex-
panded unemployment insurance we 
passed in the CARES Act—especially 
the coverage for gig workers and the 
self-employed and the $600 weekly 
boost—have enabled workers to keep a 
roof over their heads, feed their chil-
dren, and pay for health insurance. 
If these benefits expire or are dras-
tically reduced, it could cause an evic-
tion and hunger crisis. It could also 
tank consumer spending while increas-
ing business closings that will lead to 
even more unemployment. Addition-
ally, it could further exacerbate this 
public health and economic crisis by 
forcing more Americans into desperate 
situations, instead of ensuring that 
people can return to the workforce 
when it is safe. 
And yet knowing this, the Repub-
lican have proposed to slash weekly 
benefits to $200 a week for the next two 
months, after which benefits would be 
limited to no more than 70% of pre-
vious wages. This plan, which would 
cut the average worker’s unemploy-
ment benefits by roughly 43%, would 
take states months to get up and run-
ning. This would further delay benefits 
at a time when some workers are still 
waiting for assistance. 
Instead of this half-baked, ineffi-
cient, and disingenuous proposal, we 
must work together on a bipartisan 
basis to enact targeted, effective, and 
smart measures that will offer fami-
lies, businesses, and the economy the 
needed stability to get us through this 
crisis. That is why I am introducing 
the Worker Relief and Security Act, 
along with Senator BENNET and Con-
gressman 
BEYER. 
Our 
legislation, 
which reflects input from top econo-
mists, would take politics out of the 
equation, basing continued enhanced 
unemployment insurance benefits on 
‘‘automatic stabilizers’’ that are tied 
to the public health emergency and 
economic conditions. Specifically, this 
legislation would automatically extend 
the $600 weekly boost and additional 
benefit weeks, on top of regular state 
unemployment, through the duration 
of the public health crisis. Once we 
begin to enter the recovery phase, this 
legislation would continue providing 
supplemental 
weekly 
compensation 
and additional benefit weeks until na-
tional and state total unemployment 
rates get closer to pre-crisis levels. 
Time is of the essence, so I urge our 
colleagues to join us in pressing for im-
mediate action on this legislation. We 
must extend and enhance unemploy-
ment insurance benefits, tying them to 
economic and health conditions—as

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
663—SUP-
PORTING MASK-WEARING AS AN 
IMPORTANT MEASURE TO LIMIT 
THE 
SPREAD 
OF 
THE 
CORONAVIRUS 
DISEASE 
2019 
(COVID–19) 
Mr. TOOMEY (for himself and Mr. 
BENNET) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 663 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention believes that the spread of 
the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘COVID–19’’) occurs pri-
marily through respiratory droplets; 
Whereas research shows that shedding of 
the virus that causes COVID–19 can occur 2 
to 3 days before the onset of symptoms; 
Whereas research conducted long before 
the COVID–19 pandemic has shown the util-
ity of wearing masks in providing protection 
against the transmission of respiratory in-
fections; 
Whereas various types of cloth masks, in-
cluding masks made of cotton, gauze, and 
other fabrics, reduced infection rates among 
health care workers and others during the 
Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 and the Man-
churian plague of 1920 through 1921, and were 
used by health care workers and others to 
protect against tuberculosis in the 1930s and 
1940s; 
Whereas a study published on July 9, 2008, 
that tested the efficacy of homemade face 
masks in reducing respiratory infections 
among the general population concluded 
that any type of general-use mask is likely 
to decrease viral exposure and infection risk 
on a population level; 
Whereas a study published on May 22, 2013, 
that attempted to test the protective value 
of homemade masks compared to commer-
cial masks in an influenza pandemic con-
cluded that homemade masks would be bet-
ter than no facial protection at all; 
Whereas, on April 3, 2020, the Centers for 
Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 
rec-
ommended that the people of the United 
States wear nonmedical, cloth masks in pub-
lic places; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention has found that cloth face 
coverings fashioned from household items 
can substantially reduce the dispersion of ex-
haled 
droplets 
and 
provide 
acceptable 
breathability; 
Whereas a survey conducted by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention from 
May 11 through May 13, 2020, found that 76 
percent of adults support mask-wearing out-
side of the home; 
Whereas a study published by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention on July 
17, 2020, found no secondary cases of COVID– 
19 in 139 mask-wearing clients of 2 sympto-
matic mask-wearing hair stylists with con-
firmed cases of COVID–19; 
Whereas the benefit of each additional 
cloth mask worn by members of the public 
has been estimated to be between $3,000 and 
$6,000 due to the ability of masks to slow 
COVID–19 transmission and, as a result, to 
decrease mortality relating to the virus that 
causes COVID–19; and 
Whereas a study published in BMJ found 
that mask-wearing by both infected individ-
uals and the contacts of those individuals to 
be 79 percent effective in reducing COVID–19 
transmission: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of mask- 
wearing in limiting the transmission of the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘COVID–19’’); 
(2) recognizes that medical-grade masks 
should be reserved for use in health care set-
tings and among vulnerable populations 
throughout the COVID–19 pandemic; 
(3) recognizes that mask-wearing should be 
coupled with other measures recommended 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention and State and local public health 
agencies, including frequent handwashing 
and physical distancing, to further reduce 
the risk of COVID–19 transmission; and 
(4) encourages the people of the United 
States to wear masks in indoor public places, 
in accordance with the guidelines estab-
lished by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 
at 
times 
when 
physical 
distancing 
is 
not 
allowable 
to 
protect 
against unknown transmission of COVID–19.

HONORING MR. ROBERT YOUNG 
HON. BEN McADAMS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize one of my constituents, Mr. 
Robert Young, for his heroic efforts to protect 
his neighborhood from a threatening wildfire. 
Mr. Young lives in Saratoga Springs, where 
nearby flames recently forced 13,000 people 
to evacuate their homes. In a show of great 
courage, Mr. Young sent his family off in their 
car while he stayed behind, working to protect 
his neighborhood despite the back pain that 
recently forced him out of work. He placed the 
safety of his community over his own. 
As the fire raged, he spent hours in a CAT 
plowing away at the fields behind the homes 
of Heppler Lane, creating a firebreak in the 
hope that, if needed, it would slow the 
progress of blaze. Thankfully, all homes on 
Heppler Lane were spared. 
In a show of humility, Mr. Young downplays 
the bravery it took to do what he did. He at-
tributes all credit to the valiant firefighters who 
battled the flames day and night for a full 
week. 
Communities are built by individuals coming 
together to sacrifice for the greater good. It is 
my hope that the story of Mr. Young’s heroic 
actions can be an example to us all.

IN MEMORY OF ROBERT JOSEPH 
DONOHUE 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
remembrance of a dear family member, Bob 
Donohue. Bob was a loving father, grandfather 
and wonderful friend. 
Bob spent his entire working career with 
General Motors, starting in the 1950’s as a nu-
clear physicist and retiring in 1996. Bob al-
ways had the ability to light up a room and 
keep people smiling. 
Bob enjoyed planning and orchestrating va-
cations and trips for his children and grand-
children. He loved being around his family and 
went out of his way to comfort anyone. 
Bob was an avid fan of history, physics and 
mathematics. He often listened to classical 
music and enjoyed going to orchestra perform-
ances. Bob was a true joy to be around and 
his presence was always delightful. 
I give my dear wishes to Bob’s wife of 63 
years, Marianne, and his beloved children. 
Bob will be greatly missed but he is now rest-
ing easy in Heaven. 
May God rest his soul and bring comfort to 
his family and friends as we mourn his loss 
and celebrate Bob’s life here on earth.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DOROTHY 
PRISCILLA JOHNSON 
HON. BRIAN J. MAST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of one of my constituents, Mrs. 
Dorothy Priscilla Johnson. Mrs. Johnson 
passed away earlier this year, on April 25, 
2020, after years of faithful devotion to the 
Stuart community. 
Since her move to South Florida in high 
school, Dorothy invested heavily in the area, 
marrying and raising five sons. She also 
worked for and eventually received her Doc-
torate in Education from FIU, using her edu-
cation to pour into the lives of her students as 
a teacher for 34 years. Beyond her work in the 
classroom, she showed her generosity by giv-
ing and volunteering with a number of local or-
ganizations and Catholic charities. 
Madam Speaker, it’s an honor to get to rec-
ognize Dorothy and the life she devoted to the 
flourishing of her family and her community, 
and I know that those she leaves behind miss 
her greatly.

COMMISSION ON THE SOCIAL STA-
TUS OF BLACK MEN AND BOYS 
ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Commission on the Social 
Status of Black Men and Boys Act, which will 
establish a 19-member commission to exam-
ine the social disparities disproportionately af-
fecting Black males in America. Commission 
members will be directed to review homicide 
rates, arrest and incarceration rates, poverty, 
violence, fatherhood, mentorship, drug abuse, 
death rates, disparate income and wealth lev-
els, school performance in various grade lev-
els, and health issues. The commission also 
will investigate potential civil rights violations 
affecting Black men and boys. 
By authorizing this Commission to conduct 
this systematic study of the conditions affect-
ing Black men and boys, it will better inform 
us on the community impacts of relevant gov-
ernment programs and provide recommenda-
tions on how we can remedy the underlying 
causes of these disparities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E690 
July 29, 2020 
This bill is part of a critical effort to force our 
nation to examine how racism and social in-
justices create heavy mental and emotional 
burdens for Black men and boys. Our society 
must create an environment that will better en-
able them to achieve their full potential. This 
bipartisan effort rises to meet our moment of 
national reckoning over racial injustice. As a 
Congress, we must address the social dispari-
ties which limit and constrain the success of 
Black males in America. 
As a longstanding member of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, I am proud to support 
the Commission on the Social Status of Black 
Men and Boys Act, and I urge my colleagues 
to vote in favor of this bill.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE AND SERV-
ICE 
OF 
HUMBERTO 
TRUJILLO, 
JR. 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and work of Humberto 
‘‘Junior’’ Trujillo, who passed away July 15, 
2020. Mr. Trujillo was the Phoenix postmaster 
for the United States Postal Service (USPS), 
the first Latino to hold that position. 
Mr. Trujillo’s tenure as postmaster in Phoe-
nix was the culmination of a career based in 
hard work and service. He worked for USPS 
for 31 years, beginning as a mail handler on 
the night shift and rising steadily through the 
ranks, as he demonstrated a commitment to 
excellence and passion for his work. He was 
sworn in as postmaster in January of 2015. It 
is also notable that prior to his USPS career, 
Mr. Trujillo worked as a mason foreman and 
helped construct the main post office facility 
near Van Buren and 48th streets that he 
would later go on to lead. 
In addition to his leadership and profes-
sional achievements, Mr. Trujillo was known 
throughout the community as a man of posi-
tivity, humor, and faith. His family and cowork-
ers have spoken about his widespread impact 
on the lives of those around him and his dedi-
cation to coaching, community engagement 
and volunteering. 
Mr. Trujillo’s story was one of success and 
determination, ascending through the USPS to 
become one of its leaders. He is a reminder 
of the power of hard work and confidence, and 
the profound impact they can have when com-
bined with compassion and kindness. On be-
half of myself, the U.S. Postal Service, and 
the state of Arizona, I wish to express my 
gratitude for the achievements of this great 
man.

Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Paige Brophy for receiving 
the Arvada Chamber’s Young Professional 
Award. 
Paige took over the role of Director of the 
Outdoor Lab Foundation in January 2019 and 
quickly got to work rebuilding the team and 
implementing a successful strategic plan that 
helped lead the organization to have its larg-
est-ever fundraising year in 2019. Paige’s col-
leagues describe her leadership style as pas-
sionate and someone who leads by example. 
Under Paige’s leadership, the Outdoor Lab 
program serves more than 900 students in Ar-
vada, allowing them to participate in a life- 
changing program that helps create good 
stewards and future community leaders. Paige 
is passionate about ensuring every student at-
tends Outdoor Lab, regardless of their phys-
ical abilities or ability to pay. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Paige Brophy for this well-deserved award and 
appreciate her contribution to our community.

REMEMBERNG C. DUANE DAUNER 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise with my California colleagues to remem-
ber C. Duane Dauner, who tragically passed 
on July 13th. Mr. Dauner led the California 
Hospital Association as CEO for three dec-
ades, where he dedicated his life to healthcare 
reform, access, and coverage for not only 
Californians but all Americans. 
During his tenure as president and CEO, 
Mr. Dauner represented nearly 400 hospital 
and health systems, played a major role in the 
development of the Affordable Care Act, and 
participated in the development of the Cali-
fornia Medicaid reform policy option. As a re-
cipient of the American Hospital Association’s 
Distinguished Service Award, Mr. Dauner ex-
emplified his ability to build consensus and 
dedication to bettering the healthcare system 
for patients and hospital alike. Mr. Dauner’s 
legacy will always be remembered, and we 
are incredibly grateful to have had the ability 
to work with and learn from Mr. Dauner. 
I am pleased to be joined in this statement 
of remembrance today by: Speaker of the

COMMISSION ON THE SOCIAL STA-
TUS OF BLACK MEN AND BOYS 
ACT (H.R. 1636) 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I am a co-
sponsor of the Commission on the Social Sta-
tus of Black Men and Boys Act (H.R. 1636), 
which passed the House on July 27, 2020. 
The social disparities that impact Black men 
and boys have long needed special attention. 
In light of these challenges and the demand 
for community-based solutions, I established 
the first D.C. Commission on Black Men and 
Boys in 2001 to educate Members of Con-
gress and staff on issues and problems Black 
men and boys face and to support ideas and 
community initiatives that improve their quality 
of life. 
This commission stoked so much interest in 
Congress that in 2013, Congressman DANNY 
DAVIS and I established the Congressional 
Caucus on Black Men and Boys, which seeks 
to bring the myriad issues facing African- 
American men and boys to the forefront of 
congressional and public attention. 
The Commission on the Social Status of 
Black Men and Boys Act would create govern-
ment responsibility for the first time. It would 
create a Commission on the Social Status of 
Black Men and Boys within the United States 
Commission on Civil Rights that would have 
responsibility for addressing important issues, 
such as disparities in employment and incar-
ceration rates for African-American men and 
boys. 
When Members are able to meet once 
COVID–19 subsides, our Congressional Cau-
cus on Black Men and Boys has called for a 
Caucus hearing to hear directly from the Afri-
can-American community on the state of jus-
tice in America for African-American men and 
boys following the killings of George Floyd in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, by white police offi-
cers and Ahmaud Arbery, an African-American 
jogger killed by two armed white men in Geor-
gia. In both cases videos exposed attacks, 
marking a new social media era for seeking 
racial justice in real time. The bill I am sup-
porting today would help further address these 
important issues. 
I stand in strong support of the Social Sta-
tus of Black Men and Boys Act because it 
makes improving conditions for Black men and 
boys an official government responsibility.

the embodiment of a full and meaningful life. 
I am thankful to have lived in a time where 
these men and women were pillars of our 
community and the foundation of their families. 
Almost 75 years ago today—a price was paid 
for the life we live today, owed to the men and 
women that fought in World War II to preserve 
the foundations of our Republic. One such 
warrior is Perry Arthur Justice. As part of the 
Second Engineer Special Brigade operating in 
the Pacific Theater, Perry saw first-hand the 
price that must be paid to preserve the peace 
of this world. Through six campaigns and 22 
landings on beachheads throughout the Pa-
cific, the Second Engineer Special Brigade 
provided mission-critical services to win the 
battle. Even in the midst of the chaos of com-
bat, surely aware of his impending doom, 
Perry said ‘‘I just wanted Dad to know I died 
like a man. When I knew I was going to die, 
I stopped being scared and have never been 
afraid since.’’ Amazingly, Perry’s fearless life 
continued years after his time in the Pacific 
with his marriage to Norma Ploss, his career 
at Dow Chemical Company, his time as a 
teacher, and his legacy carried through his 
children and grandchildren. Even in retirement, 
Perry enjoyed his time as editor of the ‘‘Farm 
and Ranch Reporter.’’ I am always amazed 
that such individuals in the heat of battle, con-
tinuously facing death, came home and lived 
their lives to the fullest. Truly, Perry Arthur 
Justice is an example of a life well-lived. He 
is also a sign of the debt we owe to those who 
came before us to ensure our freedoms and 
way of life. The oppression of distant terrors 
was hurled back at a time when hope was 
bleak but the Greatest Generation responded 
as true heroes and prevailed. I am honored to 
highlight the life of Perry Arthur Justice. May 
God bless him, his family, and our great coun-
try.

Award. 
The recipient of the Chamber’s Man of the 
Year award is selected by a committee and is

As 2019 Man of the Year, Ed was selected

olent and community-centered. 
In addition, Ed has served on numerous 
local boards and committees, worked to sup-
port local schools, and volunteered his time, 
treasure and talent for many organizations 
such as the Arvada Festivals Commission, 
Adopt a Street and the Arvada Harvest Fes-

HONORING THE SERVICE OF NICH-

NATIONAL

CON-

COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SE-
CURITY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, as the Chairman of the Committee 
on Homeland Security, I rise to honor Mr. Eric 
Nicholas Alexandre Generous, or as we call 
him Nick Generous, upon the conclusion of his 
service to the Committee as a Congressional 
Fellow from the Los Alamos National Labora-
tory. 
We brought Mr. Generous onto our staff in 
April 2019, hoping to utilize his specialized 
knowledge to enhance the Committee’s over-
sight and legislative activities. When we 
onboarded him, little did we know how fortu-
itous it was that we had someone with a back-
ground in epidemiology and data analytics on 
our staff. When news began emerging about a 
novel coronavirus (COVID–19) in Wuhan, 
China, Mr. Generous was immediately en-
gaged and, over the past six months, he has 
proven to be an invaluable resource, helping 
me and the Committee Members navigate the 
cascading effects and underlying questions 
around the pandemic. 
More broadly, Mr. Generous has served as 
a reliable resource to our Committee Members 
and staff on not only COVID–19 but ongoing 
questions about how the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) can better partner 
with the scientific community as well as State, 
local, tribal and territorial governments to en-
hance detection, preparedness, response to 
biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear 
threats. Among Mr. Generous’ numerous con-
tributions to the Committee’s work with respect 
to bolstering resilience within America against 
disinformation during crises like COVID–19. 
His efforts are reflected in legislation that the 
Vice Chair, Representative Lauren Under-
wood, introduced in June to DHS to analyze 
disinformation threats that may pose a health 
to public health or emergency response and to 
provide federal resources and guidance to 
help local public health and safety profes-
sionals 
mitigate 
the 
impact 
of 
such 
disinformation in their communities. 
Throughout his time on the Committee, Mr. 
Generous displayed a high degree of profes-
sionalism and personal commitment to pro-
viding Committee Members and staff valuable 
insight and information. His ability to commu-
nicate complicated scientific matters in an ac-
cessible manner enhanced the Committee’s 
ability to carry out its oversight and legislative 
responsibilities. 
We thank Mr. Generous for his service to 
the Committee and our country and wish him 
the very best as he returns to the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory and continues his service 
to the country by applying his considerable tal-
ents to tackling COVID–19.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JOE 
WILLIAMS 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life of Joe Williams, 
a great Texan who became an angel on July 
24, 2020. I salute his lifetime of service and 
join his loved ones in mourning his loss. 
Joe’s dedication to both nation and family 
reflect the values we hold dear in Central 
Texas. A fellow graduate of Texas Tech Uni-
versity, he spent a lifetime working in and ad-
vocating for the retail and groceries industries. 
Starting in the 1960’s, Joe spent 24 years at 
Mrs. Baird’s Bakeries—Bimbo Bakeries USA, 
before serving as president of the Gulf Coast 
Retailers Association beginning in 1994 until 
its merger with the Texas Retailers Associa-
tion in 2006. Joe finished his career with the 
Texas Retailers Association as Vice President 
for Regulatory and Member Services and 
head of the Texas Food Council. 
A tireless champion for the food sector, Joe 
played a key leadership role in several indus-
try-related organizations, including the Amer-
ican Leadership Forum, Food Industry Asso-
ciation, Food Industry Association Executives 
Board of Directors, Texas Interagency Task 
Force for EBT, and the Texas Attorney Gen-
eral’s Employer Task Force. He also served 
on the advisory board for The University of 
Houston’s Retailing and Consumer Science 
Department and was appointed to USDA’s 
Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition National 
Advisory Council, which he chaired in 2006. 
Joe’s advocacy wasn’t limited to the inter-
ests of the food industry. He also served as 
the President of his community’s Municipal 
Water District and served many years on the 
Board of a local non-profit (SEARCH) that 
works with the homeless, and in addition 
served on the Board of The Greater Houston 
Chapter of the Red Cross. His work at these

In addition to his leadership in the business

husband of more than 50 years to Jackie, fa-
ther to Jeremy and Jo Leigh, and a proud 
grandfather. He was a dear friend and mentor 
to many in both Texas and well beyond our 
borders. 
While we mourn Joe Williams’ passing, his

The positive and lasting impacts he had on 
the lives of others will remain forever in our

Monday, July 27, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of this important legislation. As our 
country faces a public health and economic 
crisis, we are in desperate need of the talents 
of black men and boys to address these un-

Our country’s history of institutional racism 
has caused tremendous inequality. This legis-

disparities experienced by black men and 
boys for far too long. 
This nation will rise when all of us are able 
to rise together.

HONORING ROBERT BENDORF 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Robert Bendorf and his incred-
ible 31-year career devoted to the people of 
Yuba County. As Mr. Bendorf retires from his 
position at the helm of Yuba County, he offers 
a prime example of the beneficial impact that 
a single person can have to his or her com-
munity. 
Mr. Bendorf began his career with the Yuba 
County Sheriffs department in 1986 and joined 
the County Administrator’s office in 2000. He 
has been appointed to serve on numerous 
state and local committees and commissions 
including AB 109, Court Transfers, County— 
Court Mediations, CSAC—League of Cities 
Task Force on Homelessness, the Governor 
Brown’s No Place Like Home Advisory Com-
mittee and the CSAC Finance Corporation. He 
is President of the Yuba-Sutter-Colusa United 
Way. Mr. Bendorf has been serving as the 
County Administrator in Yuba County for the 
past 15 years. 
Along with his duties as County Adminis-
trator, Mr. Bendorf also serves as the Director 
of Emergency Services. Along with a Deputy 
OES Director and two additional full-time staff, 
Yuba County has developed a state-of-the-art 
Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and al-
ternate sites ready at the ‘‘flip of a switch.’’ 
Supplemented by national, state and locally 
trained section chiefs, EOC equipment is al-
ways ready and designed to rapidly be relo-
cated to different locations. In recent years 
Yuba’s EOC has had to activate, along with 
our partners, for two high water events, the 
Oroville 
Damn 
Incident, 
CASCADE 
Fire, 
CAMP Fire and most recently the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Mr. Bendorf’s career in Yuba County has 
been truly noteworthy over the years through 
his active involvement and work for the better-
ment of the community. While his presence on 
the board will surely be missed, the 15 years 
that he dedicated to serving the residents of 
Yuba County has undoubtedly left a legacy 
that will last for many more years to come. On 
behalf of the people of California’s 3rd Con-
gressional District, please accept my sincere 
gratitude for your dedicated service and best 
wishes upon your retirement and future en-
deavors and accomplishments.

as Food for Thought, Community Table, Ral-
ston House, Police K9 Association, Morgan

CHILD CARE FOR ECONOMIC RE-
COVERY ACT AND THE CHILD 
CARE IS ESSENTIAL ACT 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of legislation that is before the House to 
ensure access to child care, a critical work 
support for tens of millions of Americans. 
Childcare is a necessary work enabler. Con-
versely, lack of access to childcare hinders the 
ability 
of 
many, 
including 
women 
and 
marginalized persons, to enter, re-enter, or 
stay in the workforce. High quality and afford-
able childcare is a necessity, not a luxury so 
I am glad that these two excellent bills are 
being debated today. 
Even with recent increases in federal appro-
priations for programs like the Child Care and 
Development Block Grant, only about 1 in 6 
eligible children received federal childcare as-
sistance prior to the pandemic, fewer children 
than were helped in 2006. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has exacerbated 
prior childcare shortages, making it difficult for 
essential workers to find care during their work 
hours—even for those who had reliable 
childcare before the pandemic. In the mean-
time, childcare providers have been hit hard, 
laying off employees and closing permanently 
or facing the threat of permanent closure. Dur-
ing this pandemic, childcare facilities that want 
to stay open or reopen are generally serving 
far fewer children. A recent survey found that 
the majority (65 percent of those childcare fa-
cilities that remain open report operating at 
less than 25 percent capacity, so that even 
while open they continue to lose money. 
Yet as great as the need was before this 
pandemic, it may get worse. 
One estimate by the Center for American 
Progress found that nearly 4.5 million existing 
childcare slots are at risk of being lost perma-
nently. 
Without access to childcare, many Ameri-
cans cannot go back to work. Without support 
from the federal government, quite frankly, I 
am concerned that the loss of childcare slots 
will continue to hinder our communities even 
long after we hit public health milestones 
needed to safely reopen. 
With the Child Care for Economic Recovery 
Act (H.R. 7327) and the Child Care is Essen-
tial Act (H.R. 7027), House Democrats are 
again leading the way in helping ensure we 
meet the real needs facing Americans hard hit 
by this pandemic. I urge my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle in both chambers to join 
us. 
Among other provisions, H.R. 7327 would 
make the Child and Dependent Care Tax 
Credit refundable, allowing many low- and 
middle-income families to claim the credit for 
the first time. To help childcare providers, the 
bill would create a 50 percent refundable pay-
roll tax credit for mortgage obligations, rent 
obligations, and utility payments incurred by 
childcare facilities that have been affected by 
COVID–19. 
H.R. 7327 would also increase mandatory 
federal funding through the Child Care Entitle-
ment to States (CCES) program for the first 
time in over decade, raising the amount to $10 
billion per year. The bill also supplies an addi-
tional pot of funds—some $850 million—to 
help essential workers find childcare.

H.R. 7027 would create a Child Care Sta-
bilization Fund within the existing Child Care 
and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) pro-
gram and invests $50 billion into that fund to 
help providers through these challenging 
times. These funds would be targeted to pay 
salaries, purchase PPE and cleaning equip-
ment, rent and other fixed costs, and other 
goods and services necessary to maintain or 
resume operation. 
Additionally, H.R. 7027 would require pro-
viders helped by these funds to pay their staff 
at the same compensation level as pre- 
COVID–19. Finally, the bill would require pro-
viders who open or who remain open to meet 
health and safety guidance issued by the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention and 
state and local authorities. Assisted providers 
who are closed would have to provide an as-
surance that they will reopen their program 
when they are able to implement such guid-
ance. 
I am pleased to support these bills and urge 
my colleagues to do the same.

HONORING 
THE 
75TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF WERSELL’S BIKE SHOP 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and extend warmest congratula-
tions to Wersell’s Bike shop, owned by Jill 
Wersell. Her father started the business in 
1945, and Wersell’s has been a positive addi-
tion to the Toledo community for 75 years. 
As Wersell’s Bike shop celebrates its 75th 
year of existence, we can also celebrate the 
many years of service to Northwest Ohio the 
Wersell family has given. Jill Wersell takes 
pride in the community in which she was born. 
Whether it is by spending time working with 
organizations that help children with autism 
learn to ride a bike, or donating bikes to chil-
dren and those in need, giving back to the 
community is important to Jill and her shop. 
Wersell’s Bike Shop also sponsors the To-
ledo Glow Roll where hundreds of bikes deco-
rated in lights ride through Toledo to raise 
money and awareness for ovarian cancer. The 
Toledo Glow Roll is a healthy community 
event that brings family and friends together. 
The Wersell family has worked tirelessly 
serving Toledo families year after year. Their 
number one priority has always been cus-
tomer service, which keeps the family at the 
shop a minimum of six days per week. With 
countless stories, events, and support, we 
wish them a very happy 75th Anniversary. 
Onward, Wersell’s.

MENT 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, next 
month the United States will celebrate the 
100th anniversary of women’s suffrage. On 
August 26, 1920, our nation finally recognized 
the right of women to vote with the passage 
of the 19th Amendment. For the past 100 
years, women increasingly have been partici-
pating in the democratic process, not only as 
voters but as those who serve their constitu-
encies in the U.S. Congress, state legisla-
tures, and numerous other elected positions. 
While we commemorate this important mile-
stone, we must give thanks to those men and 
women who worked to ensure that women 
were fully included in the political process. It 
took the courage of trailblazers like Sojourner 
Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton, and the women who gathered at 
Seneca Falls so many decades ago to de-
mand that their voices be heard. As we cele-
brate the centennial anniversary of women’s 
right to vote, I urge women across our nation 
to continue to use their voices and actively 
participate in the democratic process, as they 
have already for so many years. Our nation’s 
political system, as well as our families, econ-
omy, and culture, are made stronger through 
the full participation of women. 
In March, the House celebrated Women’s 
History Month and acknowledged the accom-
plishments of women across the nation and 
around the world. Throughout the years, I 
have been proud to recognize key female fig-
ures in my district who have played significant 
roles bettering South Florida. From edu-
cational leaders to dedicated city employees, it 
has truly been a privilege to celebrate their im-
pressive achievements and highlight the dili-
gent work that they do for Florida’s 25th Con-
gressional District. 
Over the nearly two and half centuries since 
our nation’s founding, successive generations 
have worked to extend the sacred promises of 
liberty to all Americans. We are ever striving 
toward the more perfect union for which our 
government was established, and we have 
come a long way. We have more work ahead 
of us, and I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to ensure that these foundational 
rights and freedoms are secured for all Ameri-
cans. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in 
celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th 
Amendment, and in thanking women across 
the United States for their activism, leadership, 
and service in creating the vibrant democracy 
of today.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Zachary Marcolina for re-
ceiving the Arvada Chamber’s Rising Star 
Award. 
Zachary’s passion for helping other people 
and making his community a better place has 
been obvious at an early age. He spends 
much of his free time volunteering to help the 
homeless, tutor fellow students and coach 
youth soccer. He also organized a book drive, 
collecting more than 2,000 books for families 
in need. 
A natural leader, he was captain of his soc-
cer team for all four years at Arvada West 
High School. Zachary also served as secretary 
of the National Honor Society and volunteered 
with numerous organizations around Arvada 
such as the library, Santa House, various 
homeless shelters and others. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Zachary Marcolina for this well-deserved 
award and appreciate his contribution to our 
community.

Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
on behalf of myself and Mr. THORNBERRY, as 
the chair and ranking member of the House 
Armed Services Committee, it is our honor to 
pay tribute to an accomplished leader and 
senior executive of the Department of De-
fense, Mr. Robert R. Hood. 
Mr. Hood has served as the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Legislative Affairs from 
August 2017 to July 2020. As he prepares to 
leave this position, we commend him for his 
outstanding leadership, advice and sound pro-
fessional judgement on numerous critical 
issues of enduring importance to the Depart-
ment of Defense, Congress, and this Nation. 
Robert Hood has served our Nation for 
more than 18 years serving in various capac-
ities within the Federal Government. His serv-
ice to our nation includes roles as a Profes-
sional Staff Member for the House Committee 
on Science, Senior Legislative Assistant, Sen-
ior Policy Advisor, and Assistant to the Speak-
er of the House of Representatives for Policy. 
Mr. Hood also served five years as the Direc-
tor of Congressional Affairs for the National 
Nuclear Security Administration, a semi-auton-
omous agency within the Department of En-
ergy. 
Mr. Hood previously served in the White 
House as a Special Assistant to President 
George W. Bush in the Office of Legislative 
Affairs, overseeing coordination with the Sen-
ate, including the Armed Services, Homeland 
Security, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence

House staff, Mr. Hood served at the Pentagon 
as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Legislative Affairs where he was 
responsible for promoting the policies, strate-
gies, and budget of the Department of De-
fense to the United States Congress. Mr. 
Hood also served as the Deputy Under Sec-
retary of Defense (Comptroller) for Budget and 
Appropriations Affairs, working closely with the 
Appropriations Committees of the Congress. 
For the past three years as the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, 
Mr. Hood deftly managed and guided the De-
partment’s congressional relations, ensuring 
the preparation of key senior leaders for Sen-
ate confirmations, Congressional hearings and 
briefings, while simultaneously developing and 
leading a highly skilled and focused legislative 
affairs team. His leadership, knowledge, and 
personal efforts greatly contributed to one of 
the most successful legislative years in DoD 
history, culminating with the establishment of 
the U.S. Space Force, signed into law on De-
cember 20, 2019 as part of the FY 2020 
NDAA. 
Mr. Hood provided significant contributions 
and leadership during the development and 
execution of the Secretary of Defense (SD)’s 
Congressional Engagement Strategy, ensuring 
an integrated legislative program directly 
aligned with the National Defense Strategy. 
This comprehensive plan supported the de-
partment’s priorities, aligned tangible legisla-
tive objectives to the congressional calendar, 
and guided the execution of over 4,000 con-
gressional engagements within the Office of 
the Secretary of Defense, and oversight and 
alignment of over 10,000 congressional en-
gagements across the Department during his 
three-year tenure. The strategic execution of 
these engagements directly led to the attain-
ment of DoD legislative priorities in the Fiscal 
Years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 National 
Defense Authorization and Appropriations Acts 
(NDAAs). 
On behalf of the House, we thank Robert R. 
Hood, his wife Jennifer, and children Evan, 
Caroline, Megan, Emma for their contributions 
and dedication to this great Nation. We join 
our colleagues in wishing him future success 
as he leaves the Department of Defense.

to receive this honor in recognition of their out-
standing academic achievement, commitment 
to the betterment of their communities, civic 
works, and leadership in the classroom. This 
year’s recipients are no exception and I am 
glad that their hard work and dedication can 
be celebrated and recognized in this way. 
This year’s recipients for Brevard County 
are Jenna Reed, Astronaut High School, Don-
ald Burkhardt, Bayside High School, Amber

High School, Kylei Oakes, Saint Edward’s 
School, Christopher Cordner, Sebastian River 
High School, and Benny Rackard from Vero

This year has presented many challenges 
for students, most of who were unexpectantly 
forced to transition to online learning and un-
fortunately didn’t get to experience in person 
graduation ceremonies. I am proud that these 
distinguished individuals braved through and 
continued to promote and practice excellence 
during this trying time. 
Let me say to these fine students that while 
we are unable to congratulate you this year 
with an in-person ceremony, please know how 
proud I am of each of your accomplishments 
and it is an honor to bestow the Congressional 
Medal of Merit to you this year. I know that 
you will take what you have learned and go on 
to serve our community in myriad ways. I look 
forward to seeing what you will achieve in the 
future. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in applaud-
ing these outstanding students for their dedi-
cation to excellence.

REMEMBERING JOHN CAMPBELL 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of John Campbell from 
Goodyear, Arizona. 
John married his wife, Wally, on June 17, 
1967, and they spent 53 wonderful years to-
gether. He was a loving father to Suzanne 
Wininger, Steve Brown, Stuart Brown, and 
John Campbell II, a grandfather to seven, and 
a great-grandfather to seven. 
John proudly served our great nation in the 
United States Air Force for twenty-four years. 
He retired as an accomplished aviator, earning 
the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. 
During his time in service, John acquired a 
long list of achievements and awards including 
spending over 6,000 hours flying the Air Force 
KC–135 as a Master Navigator, the meri-
torious service medal with one leaf cluster, the 
Air Medal with four leaf clusters, and the Re-
public of Vietnam Campaign Medal. 
After retirement, he continued to serve his 
community as a deputy registrar of contractors 
for the California Contractors State Licensing 
Board. He also served as a member of Ben 
Ali Shrine, the Union Kit Carson Lodge No. 
58, the National Sojourners, and New Hope 
OES. He was a proud life member of both the 
American Legion AWO and the Military Offi-
cers Association of America. 
On this day, we as a community would like 
to thank Mr. Campbell for his service to his 
country, and pray for his family and loved 
ones during this time of mourning.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
SILVESTRE DURAN 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the life of Silvestre Duran, an 
outstanding member of our Toledo community. 
Silvestre worked at the Jeep plant before 
settling into a long career at the Catholic Dio-
cese of Toledo as its Hispanic Outreach Coor-
dinator. He was one of Ohio’s pioneers of 
Tejano music, hosting his own Saturday radio 
program, Radio Fiesta, from 1955 to 2008. He 
saw it as an opportunity to bring joy into the 
lives of many migrant families who were work-
ing the fields and those, like his family, that 
had settled in the area. 
During these busy years, Silvestre also 
owned and operated a Mexican restaurant in 
South Toledo called Don Ysidro’s. Many 
churchgoers and late-night revelers would go 
to Don Ysidro’s for all the Mexican favorites. 
He engaged his entire family in working at the 
restaurant. 
Silvestre was an advocate for the Latino 
community in the Toledo area during its form-
ative years. He served on countless commit-
tees, boards and organizations advocating on 
behalf of Latino community. He received nu-
merous awards and accolades for his hard 
work. He taught GED classes early on and 
worked to get people from the community 
hired into good paying jobs at the Jeep plant. 
He was a founder and served as board 
President for La Raza Unida de Ohio, and 
founder and commissioner for the Ohio Com-
mission on Hispanic/Latino Affairs. Silvestre 
was a lifetime member of the Farm Labor Or-
ganizing Committee (FLOC) of the AFL–CIO, 
attending rallies and demonstrations in support 
of Baldemar Velasquez. Last year, prior to his 
90th birthday, he traveled with FLOC to North 
Carolina to protest the treatment of migrant 
farmworkers in the tobacco fields. 
Silvestre dedicated his last decades of life 
to music and singing. He could be seen at 
many Latino social events singing and playing 
his guitar with the trio Los Distinguidos along-
side Francisco Ibarra and Jesse Ponce. His 
musical influence was passed on to his grand-
children Steve Longoria; Silvestre Roberto and 
Jose Duran; and Ricky May who all sing and 
play the guitar and piano. 
Silvestre also enjoyed traveling with his fam-
ily, whether it was visiting Texas or traveling to 
Spain and Mexico. You could find him at SS 
Peter & Paul Church attending Sunday Mass 
every week. He was a man of integrity, inspi-
ration, and kindness. 
Whether serving his community, entertaining 
a crowd, or bringing joy to countless people,

RENEE NELSON 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Renee Nelson for receiving 
the Arvada Chamber’s Woman of the Year 
Award. The recipient of this award is selected 
by a committee and is awarded to a local 
community leader who has gone above and 
beyond to selflessly serve their community. 
Renee’s endless compassion and passion 
for her community has helped ensure the City 
of Arvada continues to be a vibrant and 
healthy community, from grass roots up. 
Renee frequently works around the clock on 
community projects and helping individuals in 
their hour of need, as well as helping injured 
animals. She often spends her vacation days 
to make Arvada a better place, and on occa-
sion, has even worked without rest or sleep to 
ensure the completion of community projects. 
Those that have the privilege of working with 
Renee describe her as someone who is gen-
uine, hardworking, respectful, and honest. 
Renee’s passion for volunteerism started 
early when she became the youngest chair of 
the Arvada Harvest Festival Committee at just 
nine years old. Since then, she has never 
stopped giving back. She has a passion for 
helping the homeless, reading at schools, and 
spends much of her time volunteering for 
Habitat for Humanity, the Jaycees, and the Ar-
vada Historical Society, among others. 
Renee is a shining example of an individual 
with great integrity who selflessly and continu-
ously devotes her time, energy and resources 
to help her community and those in need. I 
extend my deepest congratulations to Renee 
Nelson for this well-deserved award and ap-
preciate her many contributions to our commu-
nity.

HONORING MARGARET SILVEIRA 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Margaret 
Silveira and to celebrate her retirement after 
ten years of public service to the city of 
Lakeport. 
Ms. Silveira earned an Associate of Arts de-
gree from Modesto Junior College and grad-
uated magna cum laude from Chapman Uni-
versity with a Bachelor of Arts in Organiza-
tional Leadership. Since then, she has dedi-
cated her career to supporting California’s 
rural cities, serving as the Housing and Eco-
nomic Development Manager for Riverbank 
and the City Manager for Gustine before being 
appointed as the City Manager for Lakeport in 
2010. 
Ms. Silveira has drawn upon her almost thir-
ty years of leadership experience to guide the 
city of Lakeport through several crises. In the 
aftermath of the Great Recession, she led the 
economic revitalization efforts by stabilizing 
the city’s budget, establishing the Lakeport 
Economic Development Advisory Committee, 
and creating multiple downtown improvement 
projects. As Director of Emergency Services, 
she has helped the city navigate through sev-
eral winter storms, wildfires, and, more re-
cently, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Her 
passion for the city is evident by her efforts to 
improve the cultural scene in Lakeport through 
the promotion of public art projects and the 
construction of a new community center. 
Ms. Silveira’s success as City Manager can 
be attributed to her ability to lead staff mem-
bers and inspire them with her positivity and 
tenacity. However, her dedication to Lakeport 
extends beyond her official role as City Man-
ager. She is an active member of both the Ro-
tary Club and Kiwanis Club and serves as a 
leader in multiple professional organizations, 
including the Lake County Friends of Medicine 
College, the Sutter Lakeside Hospital Commu-
nity Advisory Council, and the California Asso-
ciation for Local Economic Development. 
Madam Speaker, Margaret Silveira is the 
kind of citizen we should all strive to be. The 
community of Lakeport is certainly better. as a 
result of her dedicated service. It is therefore 
fitting and proper that we honor her here 
today.

IN MEMORY OF REVEREND 
CLINTON RIDDLE 
HON. CHARLES J. ‘‘CHUCK’’ 
FLEISCHMANN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Reverend Clinton Elmer Riddle 
of Sweetwater, Tennessee and recognize his 
lifetime of service in his community and to our 
nation. Reverend Riddle passed on December 
3, 2019. 
Born on February 24, 1921 in Sweetwater, 
Reverend Riddle is a hometown hero. He 
graduated from Sweetwater High School in 
May of 1941. At the age of 21, Clinton Riddle 
joined the U.S. Army and during World War II 
he served in Company B—325th Glider Infan-
try of the 82nd Airborne Division. During his 
more than 30 months of service in Europe and 
Africa during the war, Reverend Riddle served 
with honor and distinction. On June 6, 1944 
he survived a crash landing of his ‘‘canvass 
coffin’’ troop-carrying glider behind enemy 
lines in Normandy during the D-Day invasion 
and fought with his unit in the Battle of the 
Bulge. In all, his unit sustained over 400 days 
under fire during his time with the B 325th. 
Reverend Riddle wedded Blanch Bernice 
Montooth in 1949 and they would remain mar-
ried for more than 60 years until her passing 
in 2010, having reared three children. He 
pastored four churches including the New 
Bethany Baptist Church, Murray’s Baptist 
Church, Cedar Valley Baptist Church, and 
Union McMinn Baptist Church. He also served 
as the interim pastor for several other area 
churches. 
Beyond his service in the ministry, Rev-
erend Riddle was an active member of his be-
loved community. He was a member of 
Sweetwater Valley Odd Fellows Lodge 280, 
Monroe County Veterans of Foreign Wars 
Post 5156, American Legion Post 106, and 
the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. 
Reverend Riddle often shared his experiences 
and memories speaking with classrooms of 
children in local schools. 
Before his passing the City of Sweetwater 
honored Reverend Riddle, proclaiming Feb-
ruary 24, 2019 as Clinton Riddle Day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E696 
July 29, 2020 
dear friend and colleague, the Honorable John 
Lewis of Georgia. John had been diagnosed 
with pancreatic cancer and he was undergoing 
treatment. Yet it didn’t affect his kindness, his 
warm smile, or the gentle touch of his hand. 
John greeted me and we chatted. It was mem-
orable because it was so natural, normal, and 
it turned out to also be good-bye. 
For nearly twenty years I have served in the 
Congress with John Lewis, a civil rights cham-
pion and legend. His personal journey ex-
tended from sharecropper fields in Alabama to 
civil rights leader, Member of Congress to na-
tional treasure. John’s voice had the moral au-
thority of a man who had been tested by injus-
tice and tormented by the defenders of injus-
tice. John marched on the frontline of Amer-
ica’s struggle for civil rights, voting rights, 
equal rights and he still had the profound 
goodness to listen to adversaries, seek good-
ness in all people, and forgive those who hurt 
him. John Lewis marched with Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. on behalf of Black Americans 
who were treated as second class citizens by 
Jim Crow laws, but his lifetime of service and 
sacrifice, his lifetime of love, was for all man-
kind. John was a powerful force for good, for 
righteousness, and for justice. 
There are many books written about John’s 
civil rights legacy and many more will be writ-
ten. His life should be a lesson to all of us and 
especially to future generations of Americans 
who will continue to work to overcome in-
equality as our country strives to be a more 
perfect union. The courage, commitment and 
compassion of John’s life is well documented 
and rightly honored. There was another John 
Lewis that I will remember and cherish. 
On numerous occasions over the years 
John and I had the opportunity to sit on the 
House floor during votes and just chat. We 
chatted about everyday matters. John loved 
gardening. He talked with great expertise 
about flowers. It was a special joy in his life 
that I loved hearing him talk about. And some-
times a conversation on flowers would lead to 
one on climate change. 
Once, we discussed another matter of 
seeming significance to John—fishing. He told 
me he liked to go fishing but obligations and 
official commitments made finding the time dif-
ficult. I invited him to visit me in Minnesota 
during the winter and told him I would share 
a special experience with him—ice fishing. 
Well, John smiled and laughed and very gra-
ciously informed me that such a thing made 
no sense to him and he would pass on the in-
vitation. 
John Lewis lived by the ‘‘Golden Rule’’—Do 
unto others as you would have them do unto 
you. He worked so hard to live by that rule 
that he made it look easy for those of us who 
are not as strong, disciplined, or courageous. 
I know John had his struggles, but he was a 
shining example for all who knew him and my 
life is richer, more full because of his gen-
erosity, kindness, and determination. 
The passing of Rep. John Lewis is a sad 
and painful loss for his family, friends, and his 
congressional staff who loved him very much. 
It is also a difficult loss for his Georgia con-
stituents, his congressional colleagues, and 
our entire nation. May God bless the soul of 
John Lewis and all who loved him. I am eter-
nally grateful to have known John and called 
him my friend and colleague. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
ROBERT J. SCHWANZL 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker. I rise today 
to remember the life of Robert Schwanzl who 
had a distinguished career and was an out-
standing Ohioan. He dedicated his adult life to 
protecting and serving his community and na-
tion. 
Bob was born and raised in the Toledo 
area. He attended Central Catholic High 
School, where he decided to join the Army 
after graduation. He started as a sergeant in 
the U.S. Army, working in intelligence during 
the Korean War. Upon returning to Toledo, he 
served at the Toledo Fire Department for 40 
years before retiring in 1998. 
Working at the fire department was a source 
of pride for Bob, saying ‘‘it’s not work if you 
love what you do’’. He worked his way to Fire 
Chief in 1994, where he proudly took on major 
responsibilities for his community. He oversaw 
the first female firefighters complete their train-
ing and supported the creation of the Toledo 
Fire Department’s water rescue unit. After his 
graduation from Owens Tech with a degree in 
their inaugural Fire Science class. he worked 
as a fire science instructor at Owens for fifteen 
years. 
Above all his love for his family exceeded all 
other passions. He and his wife Carolyn spent 
53 years together and had four children to-
gether and later sixteen grandchildren. Late in 
his career and through retirement, Bob be-
came highly involved with the Toledo Fire-
fighters Museum, and served as its President 
since 1993. His family and extended family 
enjoyed trips to the Museum, listening to Bob 
explain the exhibits with enthusiasm and pride. 
This was especially true when he and the 
other volunteers were able to locate a new ar-
tifact from other museums or private owners. 
Bob also became deeply involved in his 
church, St. Joe’s of Maumee. He was a fre-
quent lector and usher and an active member 
of the Knights of Columbus, serving as Grand 
Knight in 2016. 
He also enjoyed traveling, whether it was to 
visit his children and grandchildren or to visit 
Ireland, where at 85 years old he kissed the 
Blarney Stone, or Rome, where Bob was able 
to see the Pope for a second time in his life. 
Bob will be remembered for his love and 
commitment to his nation community, family, 
friends, and colleagues. He was a man of in-
tegrity and an inspiration to countless people 
throughout his life, demonstrating humility and 
kindness always. Whether heroically com-
manding a scene, teaching a class or telling a 
story, Bob had a commanding voice that can-
not be forgotten. He will be remembered admi-
rably by our community. Chief Schwanzl as-
sumed the awesome responsibility of leading 
one of the largest Fire Divisions in Ohio and 
ably served for four decades. His dutiful works 
for the city of Toledo built a finer city and 
place him in the ranks of citizens who become 
a father for all of Toledo. May the angels raise 
him to a place of peace and comfort which he 
has richly earned. 
LARAINE LOCKHART BORMAN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Laraine Lockhart Borman 
for receiving the Arvada Chamber’s Image 
Award. 
For 33 years, Laraine, as the director of out-
reach for the Mother’s Milk Bank, has been 
giving back to moms, dads, babies and edu-
cating families about the benefits of breast 
milk. Her tireless efforts to spread the word to 
local 
birthing 
centers, 
health 
clinics, 
midwiferies, pediatrics offices, hospitals and 
public health departments have helped build a 
community of support around and for the Milk 
Bank in Arvada and Denver, and around Colo-
rado and the country. 
Laraine is one of the founding members of 
the Human Milk Banking Association of North 
America and actively sits on their board, help-
ing to advance the cause nationally and inter-
nationally. She is instrumental in shaping the 
lives of many children, their children, and now 
their children’s children. She does all of this 
because it’s her biggest passion, her life’s 
work and her purpose. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Laraine Lockhart Borman for this well-de-
served award and appreciate her contribution 
to our community.

FORMER REP. CHET EDWARDS RE-
MEMBERS THE LATE REP. JOHN 
LEWIS 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, on July 21, 
our former colleague, Chet Edwards, who rep-
resented Texas’s Eleventh District from 1991 
to 2010, wrote an op-ed in the Waco Tribune 
to share his remembrances of our friend Rep. 
John Lewis, who today will depart the Capitol 
for the last time before returning home to At-
lanta for his funeral and burial. I am privileged 
to share Mr. Edwards’s moving article about 
his friendship with Rep. Lewis and include it in 
the RECORD. 
[From the Waco Tribune July 1, 2020] 
HOW WE CAN HONOR JOHN LEWIS 
(By Chet Edwards) 
In his Gettysburg Address, President Abra-
ham Lincoln spoke eloquently of his humil-
ity in the wake of great service and sacrifice 
for our nation when he said: ‘‘In a larger 
sense, we can not dedicate—we can not con-
secrate—we can not hallow—this ground. 
The brave men, living and dead, who strug-
gled here, have consecrated it, far above our 
poor power to add or detract . . .’’ 
Today, as I think about the passing of Con-
gressman John Lewis, I find it difficult to 
conjure the words to adequately hallow his 
lifetime of service, sacrifice and courage. 
Our founding fathers embedded in the first 
sentence of the Constitution the ideal of 
making ours ‘‘a more perfect union.’’ In 
doing so, they sent a message to every one of 
us in each generation that true patriotism is 
about making ours ‘‘a more perfect union.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E697 
July 29, 2020 
By that high standard, John Lewis was a 
true patriot. His entire life was committed 
to bringing our nation ever closer to the 
principle enunciated in our Declaration of 
Independence that ‘‘all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their Cre-
ator with certain unalienable rights . . .’’ 
At the age of 23, on Aug. 28, 1963, just be-
fore Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his his-
toric ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech, a youthful 
John Lewis spoke powerfully about the need 
to ensure real freedom for all Americans. 
John led the Student Non-Violent Coordi-
nating Committee; rode in the Freedom bus 
rides in the South; and on March 7, 1965, led 
the march in Selma, Alabama, in support of 
a national voting rights act at a time when 
black World War II and Korean War veterans 
were being denied the right to vote all across 
the South. The nationally televised image of 
John nearly losing his life that day, of peace-
ful marchers being brutally beaten by Ala-
bama state troopers, awoke a powerful con-
science across our nation and led to passage 
of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. It made our 
nation a more perfect union. 
I served in Congress with John Lewis for 20 
years. For eight years we worked together 
almost daily as two of the four Democratic 
chief deputy whips in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. Every time I was in his pres-
ence, I knew I was in the presence of true 
greatness . . . and goodness. John was a his-
toric figure, one of the Big 6 of our nation’s 
Civil Rights Movement, but he was also one 
of the most decent, kind and humble persons 
I have ever known. 
History will record that John Lewis made 
our nation a better place, a more perfect 
union. I agree. But what I respected most 
about John was that, despite all of the racial 
hatred he faced in his life, there was not one 
ounce of hatred in his body or soul. Not ever. 
One day in a conversation just off the 
House Floor, I asked John how he kept from 
hating those who had mistreated him and 
even tried to kill him. He told me that the 
real key to his life, and to the Civil Rights 
Movement’s progress, was the ideal of Chris-
tian love—to love one’s neighbor as thyself 
and to even love one’s enemy. John stayed 
committed to those principles of his faith 
and to the cause of non-violent protest, even 
when others within the Civil Rights Move-
ment criticized him for not supporting vio-
lence and when many white Americans 
threatened him. 
Make no mistake. John Lewis was pas-
sionate about the cause of justice; he was 
willing to go to jail more than 40 times in 
agitating for change in America. But his ac-
tions were always peaceful and he was al-
ways motivated by love, not hate. I used to 
savor it when John would get a twinkle in 
his eye talking to young people and encour-
aging them to get into ‘‘good trouble.’’ 
John Lewis was the conscience of Con-
gress, and in 2001 I saw the power of the bi-
partisan respect he had earned. In the wake 
of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on our 
nation, then-Majority Leader Tom DeLay of-
fered a resolution on the House floor that 
said it was the ‘‘necessary duty’’ of all Amer-
icans to pray for our nation. As a person of 
faith, I was concerned that prayer, a solemn 
choice between a person and God, would be 
demeaned by Congress in declaring prayer to 
be 
a 
government-mandated 
‘‘necessary 
duty.’’ On a nearly vacant House floor, I 
found John and asked him to speak against 
this misguided resolution. John, never one to 
back off from fighting for his principles, 
spoke eloquently from the well of the House 
about his reverence for prayer and the con-
stitutional separation of church and state. In 
a testament to the respect he had among his 
colleagues, we were able to defeat this badly 
flawed resolution. 
As someone who will always cherish the 
blessing of knowing John Lewis, I am 
thrilled that across America today journal-
ists and citizens from all walks of life are 
honoring John with heartfelt words of 
praise. As I hear those well-deserved words 
about this great and good American, I’m also 
challenged by the question posed by Presi-
dent Lincoln at Gettysburg. After recog-
nizing that we could not further hallow the 
ground of those who died at Gettysburg, Lin-
coln went on to ask how we could truly 
honor those who died there. He said these 
powerful words: ‘‘It is for us the living, rath-
er, to be dedicated here to the unfinished 
work which they who fought here have thus 
far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to 
be here dedicated to the great task remain-
ing before us—that from these honored dead 
we take increased devotion to that cause for 
which they gave the last full measure of de-
votion . . .’’ 
John Lewis dedicated his life, and risked 
his life, in the of racial justice and the right 
of all Americans to vote. I will never forget 
when he spoke at the Waco Convention Cen-
ter and shared stories of the sacrifices made 
and lives lost in the Civil Rights Movement 
and its effort to protect for all Americans 
the fundamental right to vote. You could 
hear a pin drop in a room of hundreds of peo-
ple when he leaned over the lectern and said, 
‘‘Given the sacrifices I have seen, I cannot 
imagine anyone not exercising the right to 
vote.’’ 
John Lewis never thought that patriotism 
was to love our country or leave it. As the 
son of Alabama sharecroppers and as a child 
who could not check out books at his local 
library because of the color of his skin, he 
learned that we should love our country de-
spite its imperfections and commit ourselves 
to making it ‘‘a more perfect union.’’ 
If we truly want to honor the life of John 
Lewis, we should each be dedicated to his un-
finished work of bringing about racial justice 
in our community and nation and protecting 
the right to vote for all Americans, for which 
he nearly gave his life 55 years ago in Selma, 
Alabama. 
If we truly want to honor the life of John 
Lewis in an age of political division and ani-
mosity, we should each do better in honoring 
his faith in the power of love, in the power of 
hope, in the power of respecting others. We 
should strive for the ideal that he called the 
‘‘beacon’’ of his life—the ideal of a ‘‘beloved 
community.’’ 
Here on earth, John Lewis marched with 
the people for a divine cause. Now, in heav-
en, he will soar with the angels. He will reap 
what he sowed here on earth. 
God speed, my dear friend. And thank you 
for teaching us so much by the sermon of 
your life.

SUPPORTING H.R. 7027, THE CHILD 
CARE IS ESSENTIAL ACT AND 
H.R. 7327, THE CHILD CARE FOR 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 7027, the Child Care Is Essential 
Act and H.R. 7327, the Child Care for Eco-
nomic Recovery Act. Taken together, these 
bills make critical investments in our nation’s 
child care programs to meet the short and 
long term needs of America’s families which 
are so long overdue. 
The next frontier is high quality, affordable, 
universal child care. Without it, American 
workers and in particular women to whom 
child care often falls, will not be able to reach 
their full economic potential. In the short term, 
Americans will not be able to return to work 
and the economy will not be able to reopen 
unless there are adequate, safe child care op-
tions for parents. 13 percent of Americans re-
port having to reduce their work hours or 
leave their jobs because they don’t have ac-
cess to child care during the pandemic. 
Options for affordable child care are already 
scarce in many parts of the country, if avail-
able at all, and child care providers operate on 
very thin margins. This has been exacerbated 
by the COVID–19 pandemic, which threatens 
to permanently close thousands of child care 
providers, resulting in a permanent loss of 4.5 
million child care slots according to the Center 
for American Progress. 
Congress has sought to address the most 
immediate child care crises created by the 
pandemic by providing over $4 billion for exist-
ing federal programs that support the care and 
education of young children and their families 
and expanded funding for child care providers 
to meet payroll, benefits, rent and other ex-
penses. The House-passed HEROES Act pro-
vided an additional $7 billion for child care 
providers, but this is a relatively small amount 
compared to the growing need for stabilization 
of the child care sector as the pandemic rages 
on. 
H.R. 7027 doubles down on the House’s 
commitment to child care providers by creating 
a $50 billion stabilization fund to be used for 
grants to child care providers to pay for in-
creased costs during periods of low enrollment 
during the COVID–19 crisis and requires em-
ployers to keep child care workers on payroll 
to ensure that these providers will be able to 
reopen their doors once the pandemic ends. 
Most importantly, this stabilization funding re-
quires child care providers operating during

COVID–19 to meet strict health and safety 
guidance that ensures American children are 
kept safe from the virus. 
H.R. 7327 makes critical investments in the 
long term needs of child care providers and 
expands the availability of high quality child 
care in our country. It provides funding to 
states for existing child care programs, invests 
in child care infrastructure, and fills in gaps in 
child care for essential workers on the front 
lines of the COVID–19 pandemic. The bill also 
makes the Child and Dependent Care tax 
credit fully refundable and creates new tax 
credits for employees and employers to ac-
cess child care. 
Together, these bills will address one of our 
nation’s enormous challenges—access to high 
quality, affordable child care. I’m proud to sup-
port both H.R. 7027 and H.R. 7327 and I urge 
my colleagues to vote for them.

PAYING 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
CAPTAIN 
STEPHANIE DUARTE, OHIO NA-
TIONAL GUARD 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to Captain Stephanie Duarte, Ohio Na-
tional Guard, 237th Brigade Support Battalion. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, many people 
in our communities rose to high occasion to 
support those in need—nurses and doctors 
turned into family for patients and their loved 
ones, neighbors turned into delivery services 
and PPE manufacturers, and National Guards-
men turned into hunger lifelines. Cpt. Duarte 
was one of those tireless servants. 
Cpt. Duarte serves as Officer in Charge at 
the Second Harvest Food Bank of North Cen-
tral Ohio in my district. As COVID–19 surged 
and job security waned, many were forced to 
turn to local food banks for the first time. Un-
derstanding this harrowing position, Cpt. 
Duarte ran into action without hesitation. 
Among many notable efforts in this assign-
ment, she helped to organize, coordinate, and 
implement Second Harvest’s No Touch Drive 
Thru Mobile Pantry distribution. This process 
remains instrumental in efforts to feed the 
overwhelming demand of new families in need 
of assistance, and in an expedited means. Her 
strategic leadership was invaluable in devel-
oping and implementing such a monumental 
challenge. Because of her dedication, the peo-
ple of Lorain, Erie, Huron and Crawford coun-
ties were given food and more importantly, 
hope. 
On August 7, 2020, Cpt. Duarte will depart 
from her duties at Second Harvest Food Bank 
as she moves onto a new assignment with the 
Ohio National Guard. Her unparalleled leader-
ship and keen sense of intellect and duty will 
not be forgotten. Her system and capable 
guidance has ensured that the remaining 
guardsmen can continue the mission without 
hesitation or interruption. That is a sign of true 
leadership, mission above self. We wish her 
all the best as she continues to serve her 
country. 
Captain Stephanie Duarte, a hero during 
one of America’s darkest hours. The people of 
Ohio’s 9th Congressional District, Ohio, and 
America owe her a debt of gratitude. God-
speed, and I thank Cpt. Duarte for her endur-
ing spirit and service.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE 
AMERICAN LATINO ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 27, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of H.R. 2420, This bill would 
direct the Smithsonian Institution to create a 
National Museum of the American Latino, This 
museum would highlight the important con-
tributions made by Latinos and Latinas 
throughout the history of the United States. 
As a Texan, I have seen firsthand the con-
tributions made by Latino Americans through 
science and culture. The history of Texas is 
intertwined with contributions made by people 
of Latin origin. From their role in Texas declar-
ing its independence from Mexico, to the food 
we eat and the music we listen to today. Sim-
ply put, my state would not be where it is 
today without these individuals and their cul-
tural influences. 
For too long, we have failed our brothers 
and sisters in the Latino community by not giv-
ing them the space to share their journey 
through the history of our country. In fact, it is 
likely that anti-immigrant voices that arise from 
some corners of our country are there simply 
due to a lack of knowledge and understanding 
of the roles Latino Americans have played 
throughout the history of the United States 
and the impact that they have on our culture 
today. 
Madam Speaker, it is my hope that the Na-
tional Museum of the American Latino will pro-
vide clarity to all Americans on the important 
role of Latino Americans in our American story 
I hope this museum will also allow the over 58 
million Latinos and Latinas that call the United 
States home to remember and celebrate how 
their values, culture, and heroes are also 
those of this country.

Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to posthumously recognize, Mr. William Paul 
Cole, Jr. Paul was born to William Paul Cole, 
Sr. and Harriet Foote Cole on December 21, 
1931, in New York City, New York. However, 
Bluefield, West Virginia, is where the Cole 
Family planted its roots and where Paul grew 
up. Paul started serving the Bluefield Commu-
nity in his adolescence and teenage years by 
working alongside his father and grandfather 
at the Cole family-owned West Virginia Hotel. 
Entrepreneus and Community leaders them-
selves—Paul’s father and grandfather taught 
him the beginnings of business management, 
entrepreneurship, and public service; skills he 
would cultivate throughout young adulthood, 
which lead to many successes later in life.

July 29, 2020 
After Paul graduated from Beaver High 
School in 1949, he left Bluefield to further his 
education at Davidson College. He returned 
home in 1954 with his degree in-hand. That 
same year, he married the love of his life, 
Carol Ann McHugh. To provide for his wife 
and future children, Paul joined the United 
States Army. He served our country fearlessly 
in active duty for two years and continued his 
service in the Reserves until reaching the rank 
of Captain. He would later attend Harvard 
School of Business, earning a Master’s in 
Business Administration. 
Thereafter, he was hired by IBM to work at 
their Headquarters in New York City as a Sys-
tems Engineer. He pursued this role and lived 
in New York City until his father’s unexpected 
death in 1965. He quickly took a one-year 
‘‘leave of absence’’ from IBM—which he never 
came back from—and returned to Bluefield to 
take over the Cole family estate. 
Paul took up his father’s mantle as the 
Head of Operations over the Cole Motor Com-
pany. At that time, the Company was inter-
nationally known as a Harvester Dealership. 
Through his up-bringing and education, Paul 
was a natural Captain at the Helm. His leader-
ship brought forth many opportunities for the 
Company. The two most prominent were the 
formation of Truck City Parts in 1975 and the 
purchase of Evans Chevrolet in 1982 (Later to 
become Cole Chevrolet). 
As his father and grandfather did, Paul con-
tinuously sought ways to give back to the 
community. He was elected to Bluefield’s May-
oral office in 1981. He was consecutively re-
elected between the years of 1981 and 1993. 
He served one nonconsecutive term from 
2000 to 2001. Paul is known as Bluefield’s 
longest serving Mayor. Pulling from his busi-
ness experiences, Paul brought integrity, hon-
esty, and fiscal responsibility to the office. The 
city truly thrived under his leadership. 
A list of Paul’s other accomplishments in-
cludes—Chairman of the American Truck 
Dealers Association from 1978 to 1980, life-
long member of the West Virginia Auto Deal-
ers Association and was elected for a period 
of time as their President, the first West Vir-
ginian to be inducted into the Automotive Hall 
of Fame, lifelong member of the Bluefield 
Chamber of Commerce and was elected for a 
period of time as their President, lifelong 
member of the Bluefield Rotary Club and was 
elected for a period of times as their Presi-
dent, received an honorary Doctorate Degree 
from Northwood University for his leadership 
in helping to establish a Truck Marketing Cur-
riculum, traveled with Bluefield State College’s 
delegation to Taiwan to help establish a part-
nership between Bluefield State College and 
three higher education institutions within the 
People’s Republic of China, lifelong member 
of Mesa, inducted into Bluefield High School’s 
High of Fame in 2003, Bluefield State College 
named their School of Business after Paul’s 
namesake in 2010, husband, father of three, 
grandfather to thirteen, and great-grandfather 
to fourteen. 
Today, Paul’s legacy can be seen all 
throughout Appalachia. The Cole Automotive 
Group, formally known as the Cole Motor 
Company, is now operated by generations of 
Coles—all striving to uphold the precedent of 
excellence achieved by Paul, his father, and 
grandfather. With many locations in Bluefield 
and in the surrounding areas, the Coles con-
tinue to provide an exceptional service to my 
constituents in West Virginia’s Third Congres-
sional District. 
May God bless William Cole, Jr. I wish I 
could thank him for all he did for the great 
State of West Virginia. He will always be re-
membered by his family, friends, and the 
countless people he impacted throughout his 
life. I send my sincerest condolences to the 
Cole family, especially his wife, Carol Ann, 
and children, Bill, Tom, and Charles.

REMEMBERING DON˜ A GRACIELA 
CRUZ 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Don˜a Graciela 
Cruz. It is with a heavy heart that I reflect on 
our loss of a valued member of our community 
in my district. Ms. Cruz, who passed in early 
June, left us with a legacy of compassion and 
kindness, which lives on in both the memories 
of her loved ones and those in Williamsburg 
she inspired. 
Ms. Cruz spent the majority of her life in 
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and sought to repay 
her community for the kindness it showed her. 
She did not spend her days idly, instead pre-
ferring to pour her energy into the neighbor-
hood around her. In the 1970’s, she served as 
the coach for a women’s softball league at 
McCarren park, teaching others how to find 
the same joy she had for her favorite sport. 
Throughout her life, she was an active mem-
ber of her local church, regularly putting all of 
her effort into events and activities for the 
local youth. Her work with the children was 
borne of a true love for seeing those around 
her flourish. 
Ms. Cruz possessed the strong spirit of an 
activist, putting that energy towards the better-
ment of her community where we needed it 
most. She always believed in political em-
powerment and the importance of encouraging 
more people to vote. Some might say she 
loved two sports equally: softball and politics. 
Ms. Cruz, along with other members of her 
community, fought to start a garden in her 
neighborhood, later known as the Keap Street 
Community Gardens. Despite opposition from 
some local elected officials, Don˜a Graciela 
persevered. She and neighbors broke down 
both physical and political barriers to take a 
previously unused space and transform it into 
a valuable community anchor. 
Over many decades, she became a stead-
fast activist for tenants’ rights, and attended 
countless rallies over the years to fight for fair, 
livable housing. Her devotion is truly inspiring 
to everyone she knew, myself and my staff in-
cluded. 
Don˜a Graciela is survived by her children, 
extended family, and friends, as well as a 
community that has felt her loss deeply. My 
thoughts and prayers are with her family. I 
hope they may take some comfort during 
these difficult times in knowing just how deep-
ly she is missed by us all.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE MIAMI 
CITY BALLET 
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 29, 2020 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of the Miami City Ballet on the oc-
casion of its 35th anniversary. 
The Miami City Ballet was founded in 1985. 
A majority of the company’s performances are 
made up of the work of George Balanchine, 
one of the most influential choreographers of 
the 20th Century. Today, the Miami City Ballet 
is widely considered the chief interpreter of 
Balanchine’s choreography. The foundation of 
the company’s repertoire—consisting of more 
than 100 ballets, including 12 world pre-
mieres—was built on Balanchine’s style and 
technique but has now expanded to include 
notable 
classical 
works 
and 
new 
groundbreaking, contemporary artists. The 
Miami City Ballet has performed in more than 
100 cities in the United States, and inter-
nationally throughout Canada, Europe, Israel, 
South and Central America. 
This year, the Miami City Ballet is returning 
to its original home on Lincoln Road in Miami 
Beach to celebrate its 35th anniversary sea-
son with ‘‘A Love Letter to South Florida’’. I 
am proud this organization is representative of 
our Miami community with its diverse inter-
national ensemble of over 50 dancers. It is an 
honor to join the South Florida community in 
celebrating the Miami City Ballet’s vibrant his-
tory. 
Through engagement programs aimed at di-
minishing barriers to access to the arts, the 
Miami City Ballet continues to give back to our 
community, serving over 19,000 youth, sen-
iors, and historically underserved populations 
at home. As the Miami City Ballet honors 
South Florida with their love letter to the com-
munity, I am grateful for all this organization 
has done to contribute to the rich culture of 
the Magic City.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E700 
July 29, 2020 
Texas, the Committee on the Judiciary, I rise 
in strong and enthusiastic support of H.R. 
2420, the ‘‘National Museum for the American 
Latino,’’ which the newest museum of the 
Smithsonian Institute. 
The United States is a symbol of democ-
racy, freedom, and economic opportunity 
around the world, and the legacy of Latinos is 
deeply rooted in the very fabric of the history, 
democracy, freedom, and economic oppor-
tunity of the United States. 
As hard as it is to imagine, currently there 
exists no national museum within the Smithso-
nian Institution that is devoted to the docu-
mentation and explication of Latino life, art, 
history, and culture. 
This legislation rectifies this regrettable situ-
ation. 
The major purpose of the Museum is to illu-
minate the story of Latinos in the history of the 
United States for the benefit of all by featuring 
Latino contributions. 
Another important purpose of the museum 
is to provide for the collection, study, research, 
publication, and establishment of exhibitions 
and programs relating to Latino life, art, his-
tory, and culture. 
That life, art, history, and culture encom-
passes Latino contributions in the early history 
of what now encompasses the United States 
of America and its territories. 
Madam Speaker, Latino contributions in the 
armed services date from the earliest days of 
the American Revolution to current military ac-
tivities in defense of our freedoms. 
The National Museum of the American 
Latino will also document and preserve the 
history of Latino contributions to the freedom, 
well-being, and economic prosperity of all peo-
ple in the United States through historical 
movements, entrepreneurial and charitable ac-
tivities of Latinos; as well as contributions by 
Latinos to the social, natural, and physical 
sciences; and art, history, and culture, includ-
ing food, music, dance, film, theater, sports, 
and other forms of popular culture in the 
United States. 
Finally, the Museum will collaborate with re-
search centers of the Smithsonian Institution, 
and other museums and educational institu-
tions throughout the United States and 
abroad, to promote the study and appreciation 
of Latino life, art, history, culture, and its im-
pact on society in the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud that Texas is 
generally regarded as the most Hispanic state 
in America, and Texas is rich with the history 
of Latinos in America. 
The state of Texas is 39.2 percent Hispanic, 
which is 22.47 percent more Hispanic than it 
was in 2010, and there are six cities along the 
Texas/Mexico border where the population is 
effectively 100 percent Hispanic, including Hi-
dalgo, Texas. 
The Hispanic population in my home city of 
Houston is 44 percent; corresponding num-
bers are 42 percent in Dallas, 80 percent in El 
Paso. 
According to the 2010 census, in Texas, 
Hispanics accounted for nearly half of all 
births. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, the establishment 
of the National Museum of the American 
Latino will be consistent with the purposes of 
the Smithsonian Institution, created by Con-
gress in 1846, ‘‘for the increase and diffusion 
of knowledge.’’ 
I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 2420, 
the National Museum for the American Latino 
Act.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, Evelyn S. (Edwards) Carson, better 
known to her friends and neighbors in New 
Bern as Evelyn Edwards, died peacefully at 
her home in Greenwich, CT, on Tuesday 
evening. Mrs. Carson, until her retirement from

Mrs. Carson moved to Connecticut to be clos-
er to Linda and her husband Vince, their two 
children, Shane, his wife Marissa; Stephanie 
and her husband, Paul. She was either at the 
hospital or there within minutes when all six of 
her great-grandchildren were born. Mrs. Car-
son was 93 years of age and by all accounts 
of everyone who knew her, lived her life to the 
fullest and urged everyone to do the same. 
In addition to her immediate family, Mrs. 
Carson is survived by her brother Lawrence 
Strickland of Virginia Beach, VA, and sister, 
Cindy McHone of Knoxville, TN, and many 
nieces and nephews. 
In lieu of flowers, the family would appre-
ciate donations be made in Evelyn’s Memory 
to The Connor’s Cure Fund, c/o Children’s 
Hospital Foundation, 4401 Penn Ave., Pitts-
burgh, PA 15224 or at givetochildrens.org/do-
nate. 
Visitation was held from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 
p.m. Sunday, July 5, 2020 at Cotten Funeral 
Home, followed by Her funeral service at 1:00 
p.m. in the chapel. Burial followed Greenleaf
