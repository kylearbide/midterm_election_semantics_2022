PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, on this 50th anniversary 
of the Vietnam war, we pray Your di-
vine blessing on those veterans who 
left hearth and home to respond to the 
call of our Nation. We give tribute to 
their faithfulness to the ideals of free-
dom and democracy, even when the 
winds of war blew with increasing un-
certainty. 
We pray for those who, in the ambi-
guity of conflict, found themselves 
faced with unimaginable ethical dilem-
mas and who are now left with indel-
ible moral trauma. Bless those who yet 
tend to lingering physical and emo-
tional injury. Give each of them peace 
when the nightmares overwhelm and 
the echoes of battle resound in their 
slumber. 
May all who returned unwelcome find 
themselves received into Your warm 
embrace and upheld by Your loving and 
everlasting arms. 
Grant eternal rest to those comrades 
whose names are ever memorialized on 
granite walls and gravestones across 
the country. May they now know Your 
peace. 
Holy and merciful God, mend the 
wounds of war, both seen and unseen, 
individual and corporate, that as we 
commemorate this anniversary, we 
would acknowledge the cost of war and 
honor the value of peace. 
In the everlasting strength of Your 
name we pray. 
Amen.

HONORING ARMY SPECIALIST 
ROGER DEARMYER 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on National Vietnam 
War Veterans Day to honor U.S. Army 
Specialist Roger Dearmyer, a western 
New York native and Purple Heart re-
cipient who passed in December 2021. 
Roger deployed to Vietnam in 1966 
with the Fourth Infantry Division of 
the United States Army. Spending 
much of his deployment in the jungles 
of Vietnam, he was injured in action in 
April 1967. 
Roger returned home and served as 
an Erie County sheriff’s deputy for 31 
years. 
He remained active in the veteran 
community as a member of the Fourth 
Infantry Division Association and the 
Military Order of the Purple Heart 
Chapter 187. 
In 2019, we presented Roger with the 
medals he earned while serving, includ-
ing a Purple Heart, a Vietnam Service 
Medal with a triple Bronze Star attach-
ment, 
and 
a 
Combat 
Infantryman 
Badge. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Roger Dearmyer, a man who 
lived a life of service to his family, his 
community, and his country.

CONGRATULATING 
IOWA’S 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
BASKETBALL 
ALL- 
STATE HONOREES 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the achieve-
ments of several young ladies from my 
district. 
In early March, the Iowa high school 
women’s basketball State champion-
ships were held in Des Moines. These 
young women took to the court, gave 
it their all, and made their schools 
proud. I was thrilled to see several 
young women recently earned all-State 
honors from the Des Moines Register. 
Kelsey Joens of Iowa City was named 
to the All-Iowa Elite team. Halle Vice 
of Pleasant Valley was named to the 
Class 5A team, and Callie Levin of 
Solon was named to the Class 4A team. 
Kaylee Corbin of Louisa-Muscatine and 
Kelsey Drake of Wilton were named to 
the Class 2A team.

City Liberty, Macy Daufeldt of West 
Liberty, Journey Houston of Davenport 
North,

she has brought to her father and me. 
f 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO FIX SOCIAL 
SECURITY 
(Mr. LARSON of Connecticut asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, clearly, the COVID pandemic 
has struck America extraordinarily 
hard. Nearly a million Americans have 
died from COVID–19, but it has been es-
pecially hurtful to our elderly. More 
than 720,000 of the people who have per-
ished were over the age of 65. 
This underscores all the more reason 
why the United States Congress needs 
to fix Social Security. Congress has not 
addressed the issue of extending Social 
Security for more than 50 years. It is 
long overdue that the United States 
Congress live up to its responsibility 
and make sure it enhances the benefits. 
A gallon of milk cost 72 cents in 1971. 
You-all know what it costs today, as 
well as the price of gas, prescription 
drugs, and the cost of rent, et cetera. 
Yet, Social Security has not been en-
hanced in more than 50 years. 
Mr. Speaker, this is exactly why the 
United States Congress needs to act. I 
am proud of the proposal of President 
Biden and the fact that Social Security 
2100: A Sacred Trust will be brought to 
the floor. 
f 
HONORING KKOB RADIO ON ITS 
CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY 
(Ms. HERRELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor New Mexico’s first radio 
station, KKOB, which this year cele-
brates their 100th anniversary in broad-
casting. 
KKOB was founded in 1922 by Ralph 
Goddard and has remained in the Land 
of Enchantment. 
KKOB has won four Marconi Awards 
from 
the 
National 
Association 
of 
Broadcasters and, since 2000, has re-
ceived ‘‘Station of the Year’’ 12 times 
from the New Mexico Broadcasters As-
sociation. 
To celebrate their 50th birthday, in 
1972, the radio station invited an ad-
venturous bunch of hot air balloon op-
erators to the Coronado Mall parking 
lot, creating a tradition that has now 
become known as the Albuquerque 
International Balloon Fiesta. 
KKOB is the leading voice for south-
west New Mexico, sharing news, sports, 
traffic, weather, opinions, and the oc-
casional joke—some good, some bad, 
some just dad jokes. They have loved 
our community for over 100 years. 
I commend KKOB’s dedication to 
New Mexico, and I look forward to 
their next century of broadcasting. 
f 
MOURNING THE LOSS OF 
SERGEANT DANIEL MARTINEZ 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to mourn the untimely loss 
of Sergeant Daniel Martinez. 
I express my deepest condolences to 
my friends and neighbors, the Martinez 
family. There is no greater pain than 
that of losing a child, and there are no 
words I can provide to mend your pain. 
But I want you to know that the entire 
Southwest Side of the region has your 
back. 
Sergeant Daniel Martinez served his 
country 
with 
pride, 
forming 
close 
bonds with his fellow marines during 
his 4 years of service. 
He will be remembered as a young 
man with a sense of humor who en-
joyed watching movies and television 
with his siblings and loved to travel. 
Daniel will be remembered by his 
family and our community for his com-
mitment to his country. Above all, he 
will be remembered for his kindness 
and devotion to his family and friends. 
Rest in peace, Daniel. 
f 
THANKING HEIDI GALLEGOS 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to thank Brea Chamber of 
Commerce CEO and President Heidi 
Gallegos for her dedicated service to 
our community. 
Heidi served in the Los Angeles Po-
lice Department for 11 years and on the 
Board of Trustees for Rowland Unified 
School District for 12 years. Most re-
cently, she guided the Brea Chamber of 
Commerce through the Great Reces-
sion and the COVID–19 lockdowns. De-
spite unprecedented economic chal-
lenges, Heidi led the chamber to build 
reserves and remain successful. 
She consistently operates with integ-
rity, energy, and compassion and has 
established a reputation for strong, 
trusted leadership. 
I thank Heidi for all that she has 
done for our community. I am proud to 
call her a friend, and I wish her a joyful 
retirement. 
f 
HEALTHCARE WORKER MENTAL 
HEALTH CRISIS 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, our front-
line healthcare workers face a mental 
health crisis. One in five healthcare 
providers experienced mental health 
problems during the pandemic. This 
should concern every American. 
On March 30, National Doctors’ Day, 
we recognize that to protect our public 
health, we must protect the well-being 
of our health workers. 
When doctors and nurses struggle 
with their mental health, they struggle 
to care for us. Nearly half of healthcare 
workers, 47 percent, are considering 
leaving their roles in the next 3 years. 
We need their talent, dedication, and 
expertise. 
Congress recently passed a law that 
will connect doctors and nurses with 
mental health resources, but we can 
and must do more. 
Healthcare workers helped keep us 
safe during the pandemic. We have a 
responsibility 
to 
get 
them 
the 
healthcare that they need. 
f 
PRESERVE TITLE 42 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, a few 
weeks ago, I went to the southern bor-
der, and I was shocked and appalled to 
hear about the humanitarian crisis, the 
violence, and the drug smuggling first-
hand, on-site. 
President Biden’s and the Democrats’ 
open border policies have allowed a 
record number of illegal immigrants 
and illegal drugs to enter our country. 
There are staggering numbers of en-
counters at the border each month, and 
more illegal immigrants are, unfortu-
nately, slipping past in areas without a 
fence or enough Border Patrol. 
Now, the Biden administration is 
thinking about repealing one of the 
more effective methods of deporting il-
legal immigrants, title 42. 
Title 42 is a public health law that 
authorizes 
U.S. 
border 
agents 
to 
promptly send back migrants and ille-
gal immigrants if they pose a health 
risk to Americans and are from a coun-
try with a communicable disease out-
break. 
During the height of the COVID cri-
sis, they want to let them in by repeal-
ing title 42. It will mean even more il-
legal immigration into this country 
and eliminate one of the few tools that 
the administration has used to expel il-
legal immigrants. 
The audacity of this administration 
that has tried to force vaccine man-
dates on Americans, force them to still 
wear masks on airplanes and at air-
ports, and at the same time allowing 
unlimited 
illegal 
immigration. 
We 
must preserve title 42.

RECOGNIZING 
NATIONAL 
AREA 
HEALTH 
EDUCATION 
CENTERS 
WEEK 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize this last week 
of March as National Area Health Edu-
cation Centers, or AHEC, week. 
The AHEC program is vital to this 
country and for Nevadans because we 
are facing an unprecedented shortage 
of healthcare providers. The doctor 
shortage in southern Nevada is nearing 
crisis levels, which means longer wait 
times, fewer choices, and less access to 
quality healthcare. 
The size of Nevada’s physician work-
force ranks near last in this country. 
As our community continues to ex-
pand, the challenges continue to grow. 
To solve this crisis, underserved com-
munities like Las Vegas need to expand 
the resources we offer so that medical 
providers can learn and grow their ca-
reers right here. 
That is exactly what AHECs do. They 
are part of the solution. The Nation’s 
300 federally funded AHECs are in near-
ly every State and in multiple U.S. ter-
ritories. In the past 5 years, they have 
trained 2 million healthcare profes-
sionals. 
Please join me in saluting AHECs as 
they continue to be committed to pre-
pare, plan, and train for a better 
healthcare future.

against a shipper, a shipper’s agent, or a 
motor carrier by refusing, or threatening to 
refuse, cargo space accommodations when

justly discriminatory methods because the 
shipper has patronized another carrier, has 
filed a complaint, or for any other reason. 
‘‘(e) CERTIFICATION.—A common carrier or 
marine terminal operator shall not charge 
any other person demurrage or detention 
charges under a tariff, marine terminal 
schedule, service contract, or any other con-
tractual obligation unless accompanied by 
an accurate certification that such charges 
comply with all rules and regulations con-
cerning demurrage or detention issued by 
the Commission. The certification require-
ment only applies to the entity that estab-
lishes the charge, and a common carrier or 
marine terminal operator that collects a 
charge on behalf of another common carrier 
or marine terminal operator is not respon-
sible for providing the certification, except 
that an invoice from a common carrier or 
marine terminal operator collecting a charge 
on behalf of another must include a certifi-
cation from the party that established the 
charge.’’. 
SEC. 409. PROHIBITION ON UNREASONABLY DE-

ation of reasonably foreseeable import and 
export demands; or 
‘‘(15) unreasonably decline export cargo 
bookings if such cargo can be loaded safely 
and timely, as determined by the Com-
mandant of the Coast Guard, and carried on 
a vessel scheduled for the immediate des-
tination of such cargo.’’. 
(b) RULEMAKING ON UNREASONABLY DECLIN-
ING CARGO.—

cline’’ for the purposes of subsection (a)(15) 
of section 41104 of title 46, United States 
Code (as added by subsection (a)). 
(2) CONTENTS.—The rulemaking under para-
graph (1) shall address the unreasonableness 
of ocean common carriers prioritizing the 
shipment of empty containers while exclud-
ing, limiting, or otherwise reducing the ship-
ment of full, loaded containers when such 
containers 
are 
readily 
available 
to 
be 
shipped and the appurtenant vessel has the 
weight and space capacity available to carry 
such containers if loaded in a safe and timely 
manner.

ble charge. 
‘‘(e) DEMURRAGE AND DETENTION PRACTICES 
AND CHARGES.—Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law and not later than 30 days of 
the date of enactment of this subsection, a 
common carrier or marine terminal oper-
ator, shall— 
‘‘(1) act in a manner consistent with any 
rules or regulations concerning demurrage or 
detention issued by the Commission; 
‘‘(2) maintain all records supporting the as-
sessment of any demurrage or detention 
charges for a period of 5 years and provide 
such records to the invoiced party or to the 
Commission on request; and 
‘‘(3) bear the burden of establishing the 
reasonableness of any demurrage or deten-
tion charges which are the subject of any 
complaint proceeding challenging a common 
carrier or marine terminal operator demur-
rage or detention charges as unjust and un-
reasonable. 
‘‘(f) PENALTIES FOR FALSE OR INACCURATE 
CERTIFIED
DEMURRAGE
OR
DETENTION 
CHARGES.—In the event of a finding that the 
certification under section 41102(e) was inac-
curate, or false after submission under sec-
tion 41301, penalties under section 41107 shall 
be applied if the Commission determines, in 
a separate enforcement proceeding, such cer-
tification was inaccurate or false.’’. 
(b) RULEMAKING ON DETENTION AND DEMUR-
RAGE.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 120 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Federal Maritime Commission shall initiate 
a rulemaking proceeding to establish rules 
prohibiting common carriers and marine ter-
minal operators from adopting and applying 
unjust and unreasonable demurrage and de-
tention rules and practices. 
(2) CONTENTS.—The rulemaking under para-
graph (1) shall address the issues identified 
in the final rule published on May 18, 2020, ti-
tled ‘‘Interpretive Rule on Demurrage and 
Detention Under the Shipping Act’’ (85 Fed. 
Reg. 29638), including the following: 
(A) Establishing clear and uniform defini-
tions for demurrage, detention, cargo avail-
ability for retrieval and associated free time, 
and other terminology used in the rule, in-
cluding establishing a definition for cargo 
availability for retrieval that accounts for 
government inspections. 
(B) Establishing that demurrage and deten-
tion rules are not independent revenue 
sources but incentivize efficiencies in the 
ocean transportation network, including the 
retrieval of cargo and return of equipment. 
(C) Prohibiting the consumption of free 
time or collection of demurrage and deten-
tion charges when obstacles to the cargo re-
trieval or return of equipment are within the 
scope of responsibility of the carrier or their 
agent and beyond the control of the invoiced 
or contracting party. 
(D) Prohibiting the commencement or con-
tinuation of free time unless cargo is avail-
able for retrieval and timely notice of cargo 
availability has been provided. 
(E) Prohibiting the consumption of free 
time or collection of demurrage charges

mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion for this Act’’, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 6865, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call up 
and speak in support of my bill, H.R. 
6865, the Don Young Coast Guard Au-
thorization Act of 2022. 
This bipartisan legislation will au-
thorize funding for the United States 
Coast Guard for fiscal years 2022 and 
2023 and address a number of important 
issues concerning the maritime indus-
try. 
I would like to take a moment to ex-
press my deepest sympathies to Con-
gressman Don Young’s wife, Anne, the 
rest of the family, and the people of 
Alaska. 
Don was larger than life. He was the 
dean of the House. He was affable, can-
tankerous, and sometimes funny. 
You know, I have stories like the 
Speaker mentioned today about Don 
and the buck knife in his pocket, but I 
won’t go into those now. But, anyway, 
we developed a good friendship. 
I feel fortunate that I had time to de-
velop that relationship with him, serv-
ing together on both the House Com-
mittee on Natural Resources for 26 
years and the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure for 36 years. 
His service as Chair of the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee 
had an extraordinary impact. It was 
capped by the passage of SAFETEA- 
LU, a surface transportation reauthor-
ization that was named for his beloved 
late wife. 
It was a strong bipartisan bill that 
provided much-needed investment in-
frastructure across the country, in-
cluding my home State of Oregon. 
Don believed in bipartisanship. We 
didn’t always agree, but we would often 
find a way to compromise, come to-
gether for the good of the country, and 
he always, always stayed true to his 
values and the people of Alaska. 
Given Alaska’s vast coastlines, the 
Coast Guard plays a particularly im-
portant role in the State, and Con-
gressman Young was always there to 
support the United States Coast Guard. 
That is why I am particularly happy 
to include several provisions important 
to the Congressman that will have a 
dramatic impact on the State of Alas-
ka and this bill. 
At a committee markup earlier this 
month, Don said, I have voted on 20 
Coast Guard authorization bills in my 
career. I have served on the Coast 
Guard subcommittee for 46 years. This 
is a good bill. It is really needed. And 
it is really needed. And naming it for 
Don Young is incredibly appropriate. 
I would like to thank my ranking 
member, 
SAM
GRAVES, 
and 
Sub-
committee Ranking Member GIBBS for 
their work. I particularly want to 
thank the chair of the subcommittee, 
Congressman CARBAJAL, for this very 
important and overdue additional in-
vestment in the Coast Guard and ad-
dressing a number of other issues relat-
ing to the maritime industry. This is 
evidence that bipartisanship can still 
live in Washington, D.C. today. 
It not only authorizes the Coast 
Guard but also reauthorizes the Fed-
eral Maritime Commission which is the 
center of the supply chain congestion 
that has plagued this country and the 
world for over a year. 
It incorporates the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act of 2021 which will begin to 
address several unfair shipping prac-
tices that have contributed to inflation 
across every sector of the American 
economy. 
This legislation gives the Federal 
Maritime Commission the authority to 
protect exporters, importers, and con-
sumers from unfair practices by ex-
panding their oversight and enforce-
ment capabilities. 
The largest three shipping companies 
in the world made more money in the 
last year than they made over the last 
decade. It is not warranted. They are 
essentially running a cartel, and it is 
time that we took action. 
The Federal Maritime Commission, 
under this administration, is finally 
waking up, and they are going to take 
action against these cartels and the 
price gouging that is going on on our 
consumers. 
It further amends title 46 to ensure 
shipping capacity once contracts are 
signed, increases penalties for retalia-
tion against shippers, and encourages 
reciprocal trade. 
H.R. 6865 increases the Federal Mari-
time Commission’s annual operating 
budget by 10 percent over 2021. It will 
give them the additional resources 
they need to provide effective over-
sight and ensure that all foreign car-
riers abide by fair shipping practices 
which they are not doing today. 
For the Coast Guard, this bill pro-
vides more than $12 billion for fiscal 
year 2022, $13 billion for fiscal year 
2023. These authorized funding levels 
support 
servicemembers, 
fund 
new 
asset acquisitions, and improve the 
Coast Guard’s crumbling shoreside in-
frastructure. 
I am particularly pleased with the 
improved vessel safety measures in-
cluded in the legislation, and H.R. 6865 
takes a leap forward in small passenger 
vessel safety by mandating common-
sense requirements for passenger am-
phibious vessels and others. 
Chairman CARBAJAL recently held a 
hearing on a horrible tragedy in his 
district which this will also have an 
impact in preventing in the future. 
Moreover, H.R. 6865 offers meaningful 
reforms to a culture of sexual abuse 
within the maritime industry. I am 
proud to have worked with Members 
from both sides of the aisle to deter-
mine what changes are necessary to 
begin to address the toxic culture in 
the industry and create a safe work en-
vironment for all mariners. 
H.R. 6865 includes language from my 
other bill, the Safer Seas Act, which 
will give the Coast Guard more lever-
age to investigate and remove preda-
tors who sexually harass and assault. It 
also includes important safety meas-
ures such as surveillance, master key 
control systems, and extends the stat-
ute of limitations for cases of sexual 
assault and harassment. 
This groundbreaking legislation is 
just one step towards bringing justice 
for victims and getting predators out 
of the industry. 
In closing, let me thank once again 
my Ranking Member SAM
GRAVES, 
Ranking Member GIBBS, and of course, 
Chair CARBAJAL for all their extraor-
dinary work on this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3920 
March 29, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6865, the Don Young Coast Guard Au-
thorization Act of 2022, an important 
piece of legislation that ensures that 
the United States Coast Guard has the 
funding that they need to carry out the 
service’s critical mission and keep our 
borders safe. 
Today it is with both great sadness 
and great respect that we name this 
year’s Coast Guard Authorization Act 
after former Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee Chairman Don 
Young. 
The passing of the dean of the House 
was a surprise to all of us and a tre-
mendous 
loss 
for 
this 
body. 
Our 
thoughts are with his wife, Anne; his 
daughters, Joni and Dawn; and the rest 
of his family, as well as his current and 
his former staff. 
I had the pleasure of serving as a 
freshman member of the Transpor-
tation Committee when Don began his 
chairmanship in 2001. And, as always, 
he brought his typical passion and zeal 
to the job. 
He was always working for Alaska 
but also constantly helping other Mem-
bers take care of their constituents. 
The chairman, as many still called 
him, always pointed out that Alaska 
missed the great infrastructure invest-
ment of the earlier centuries that had 
been made in the lower 48, and he was 
bound and determined to make sure 
that he made up for lost time. 
There isn’t a city or a borough or a 
town or village in Alaska that can’t 
point to at least one road, airstrip, har-
bor, dock, visitors center, or health 
clinic that Don didn’t have some role 
in establishing, building, authorizing, 
or funding. 
Recently, there has been a suggestion 
to name a volcano in Alaska after 
Chairman Young, a rugged and endur-
ing part of the Alaskan landscape, al-
ways with the potential to erupt at any 
moment’s notice, but always warm at 
its core. Part of me thinks this would 
be a very fitting tribute as well. 
And as has been noted many times, it 
was fitting that he passed away on his 
way home to Alaska, the State that he 
loved so much. 
I will always think of him and smile 
when I walk by his official—unofficial, 
I should say, unofficial but uncontested 
seat here on the House floor. His pass-
ing was truly a loss for the House. 
In the Transportation Committee, we 
will always have the almost life-sized 
portrait watching over us, reminding 
Members of the importance of the work 
and the bipartisanship it takes to get 
it done. 
One of Don’s priorities throughout 
his career, and also one of my prior-
ities, was strengthening the Coast 
Guard. This legislation authorizes the 
purchase of a 12th National Security 
Cutter as well as six additional Fast 
Response Cutters to ensure that our 
Coast Guard is prepared for its current 
and future role in securing America. 
During our markup of this bill earlier 
this month, Don remarked in his state-
ment that both his support for this 
bill, and as the chairman pointed out, 
he had voted on 20 Coast Guard author-
izations in his career, and I am deeply 
saddened today that he is not going to 
be able to cast his vote in support of 
yet one more. 
Fittingly, H.R. 6865 also includes a 
provision offered by the late dean of 
the House that allows the Coast Guard 
to keep Russian vessels out of U.S. 
waters during the ongoing Russian in-
vasion of Ukraine. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge sup-
port of this important legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the chair of the sub-
committee, Congressman CARBAJAL. 
Mr. 
CARBAJAL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
would like to express my support for 
H.R. 6865, this year’s Coast Guard Au-
thorization Act, which is named in 
honor of our departed colleague, Mr. 
Don Young, who tirelessly advocated 
for the Coast Guard and maritime 
issues in his many decades of public 
service. 
With his legacy in mind, I wish to ex-
press my thanks for the leadership of 
Chairman DEFAZIO, Ranking Member 
SAM GRAVES, and Subcommittee Rank-
ing Member BOB GIBBS that created 
this bipartisan agreement. 
H.R. 6865 will renew and enhance sup-
port for the critical missions of the 
United States Coast Guard. Every day 
Coasties work to protect our national 
security and enforce the laws in the 
maritime environment. 
They maintain our Nation’s water-
ways for the sake of commerce, save 
lives, and protect the oceans from pol-
lution. These brave servicemembers 
have 
time 
and 
time 
again 
dem-
onstrated their resourcefulness, but 
they need our support today. 
The increased authorizations in to-
day’s bill signals our confidence in the 
excellence of the Coast Guard and 
starts down the road to providing the 
resources Coasties need to successfully 
complete their missions. 
H.R. 6865 also tackles current chal-
lenges to our Nation’s supply chain 
which have recently caused frustration 
in not only the transportation indus-
try, but in the average families who 
are being confronted with shortages 
and increasing costs for basic house-
hold goods. 
H.R. 6865 reauthorizes the Federal 
Maritime Commission, the entity in 
charge of promoting fairness and com-
petition in ocean shipping. 
And it includes the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act of 2021 which would provide 
the Federal Maritime Commission with 
the authority to directly address inter-
national shipping’s contribution to the 
inflation we are experiencing. 
b 1530 
As chairman of the Coast Guard and 
Maritime 
Transportation 
Sub-
committee, I am proud that this bill 
also includes my legislation to amend 
an archaic 171-year-old maritime law 
that prevented victims and their fami-
lies from seeking fair recourse against 
vessel owners who were found to be lia-
ble for maritime incidents. This provi-
sion was developed in response to the 
Conception dive boat fire in my dis-
trict in 2019, which was the largest loss 
of life in a U.S. marine casualty in dec-
ades. 
Finally, with this bill, we can make 
significant strides toward stamping out 
sexual assault and sexual harassment 
from the maritime industry. Provisions 
in H.R. 6865 strengthen transparency 
surrounding companies’ sexual assault 
and sexual harassment policies, provide 
protections for mariners, and remove 
bad actors from the industry. Such 
criminal behavior and incidents have 
no place in the maritime industry. 
I am proud to have worked with my 
colleagues on this important legisla-
tion, and I look forward to ensuring 
that it becomes law. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS), the ranking 
member of the Coast Guard and Mari-
time Transportation Subcommittee. 
Mr. 
GIBBS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
am 
pleased to rise today in support of H.R. 
6865, the Don Young Coast Guard Au-
thorization Act of 2022. The bill rep-
resents this Congress’ commitment to 
the men and women serving in the 
Coast Guard and lays the groundwork 
for maintaining the Service’s mission 
capability in the future. 
It also honors our colleague Don 
Young, who passed away last week, and 
is lying in state in Statuary Hall 
today. Our thoughts go out to his fam-
ily and staff. 
The dean of the House, the Congress-
man for all Alaska, the former chair-
man of both the Committee on Natural 
Resources and Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure, the longest 
serving Republican Member of the 
House, the former mayor of Fort 
Yukon: His titles were many, but they 
failed to fully capture Don’s character 
and endless enthusiasm for the job he 
loved, representing the people of Alas-
ka in Congress. He did that job for 49 
years, and he did it well. His legislative 
record is as amazing as his personal 
legacy of the friendships he made over 
the last five decades. He was always a 
stalwart Representative for Alaska and 
will have a lasting legacy. 
It is appropriate that we are naming 
this Congress’ Coast Guard Authoriza-
tion Act for Don. He served on the Sub-
committee on Coast Guard and Mari-
time Transportation since it was estab-
lished in 1995 and on its predecessor 
subcommittee for 20 years before that. 
He was the only licensed tugboat cap-
tain in Congress, and the Coast Guard 
plays many vital roles in the always 
vast and beautiful, but often stormy 
and dangerous, waters of his home 
State. 
The Coast Guard is one of the six 
United States Armed Forces, and they

help secure our country’s borders. As 
we watch the Ukraine crisis unfold and 
recognize the apparent lack of readi-
ness in the Russian military, we should 
be especially aware of the need to pro-
vide our Armed Forces with the re-
sources they need. 
This 
bill 
includes 
provisions 
to 
strengthen the Coast Guard’s ability to 
keep Russian vessels out of U.S. water, 
a provision Don Young authored. Both 
sides of the aisle worked together to 
craft this legislation, recognizing that 
port and coastal security, drug inter-
diction, and maritime safety are im-
portant bipartisan issues to our Nation 
rather than Republican or Democrat 
issues. 
The Coast Guard plays an important 
and unique role in national security 
and maritime safety. The Service is a 
critical component in carrying out 
drug interdiction efforts, keeping our 
ports and coasts safe, and conducting 
icebreaking operations. H.R. 6865 helps 
the Coast Guard better perform these 
missions and encourages the use of cut-
ting-edge technology to improve oper-
ations, while also addressing ongoing 
issues like how to bring the Service’s 
crumbling IT infrastructure into the 
modern era. 
Despite the administration’s failure 
to seek appropriate capital funding lev-
els, this bill authorizes over $9 billion 
for the operations and support account 
and $3 billion for the procurement, con-
struction, and improvement account 
for fiscal 2022 and provides a 5 percent 
increase in FY23. We had hoped that 
would offset earlier budget shortfalls, 
but given the rise in inflation, it will 
be needed just to stay even. 
As others have noted, this legislation 
authorizes the purchase of a twelfth 
National Security Cutter and six Fast 
Response Cutters, which are necessary 
for the Coast Guard’s future mission 
capabilities. 
Vital to my district, I am also proud 
of the commitment made to the Great 
Lakes in this bill. Working with my 
colleague, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GALLAGHER), the bill in-
cludes an authorization of a new dedi-
cated icebreaker on the Lakes to keep 
commerce moving as much of the year 
as possible. 
Thank you to Chair DEFAZIO, Rank-
ing Member SAM
GRAVES, and Sub-
committee Chair CARBAJAL for working 
in a bipartisan fashion to give the 
Coast Guard the resources it needs to 
accomplish its missions. I urge support 
of this bill. 
On a side note, my first year as a 
freshman, I was chairman of the Sub-
committee on Water Resources and En-
vironment, and I inadvertently over-
looked Don Young in the questioning 
order. That was not a smart thing for a 
freshman Member to do. I realized my 
mistake, and I apologized to him, and 
we became the best of friends. He also 
invited all of us to go to his king salm-
on barbecue here in D.C. I am really 
going to miss Don Young. He was real-
ly an American patriot. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI), a senior mem-
ber of the committee. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
strongly support the Coast Guard Au-
thorization Act of 2022, and I would 
like to thank the chairman and the 
ranking member, also Mr. CARBAJAL 
and the minority team for putting to-
gether a good piece of legislation. 
This bipartisan legislation authorizes 
the U.S. Coast Guard, our fifth na-
tional military service branch, for fis-
cal years 2022 and 2023. 
We know the Coast Guard is criti-
cally important. We just heard that 
here. This bill also goes beyond just 
the Coast Guard. It deals with the 
Jones 
Act 
and 
something 
I 
have 
worked on for 13 years here, which is 
Make It In America and how we can do 
that in our maritime industry. 
In this bill, there are policies and 
proposals that include long overdue 
language to close some egregious loop-
holes to the Jones Act that would 
allow 
foreign 
vessels 
to 
undercut 
American-flagged vessels operating in 
America’s offshore environment and 
the intercontinental shelf. This amend-
ment, H.R. 6728, which is included in 
this bill, would close that loophole so 
that those foreign-flagged vessels are 
held to the very same high standards 
that American vessels have to hold to 
in those same offshore waters. 
A lot of this comes down to the new 
offshore wind industry that is flour-
ishing in the northeast and soon will be 
found in many other parts of this Na-
tion. Do you want those to be Amer-
ican jobs or do you want those to be 
foreign jobs? The question is pretty 
simple. This bill, as amended, would 
make sure that those ships and crews 
operating offshore would have to meet 
the same high standards. They would 
have to be certified that they know 
what they are doing, that they pass the 
various background checks as Amer-
ican mariners must. 
Now, if you want a wide open thing, 
then just forget it, but this bill is there 
to protect American workers in the off-
shore wind industry, the offshore oil 
industry, and further beyond that to 
the general Jones Act fleet. 
It is a good bill. There are other 
things in this bill that are good. I had 
the great pleasure of working with our 
former colleague, Don Young, on his 
Oil Spill Response Enhancement Act. 
We worked together on that for several 
years. It is included in this bill, and it 
would certainly be appropriate that 
that stay in this bill. 
We are going to have always the nor-
mal trouble with the Senate. They just 
seem to not understand all that they 
should, but this is a great bill. I want 
to compliment all who worked on it. 
The 
minority 
teams 
did 
excellent 
work. I thank them so very much. I see 
the coauthor of our amendment, the 
gentleman 
from 
Louisiana 
(Mr. 
GRAVES), who has done good work on 
this bill, has taken his position to 
carry on. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES), the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Aviation. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I want to thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO, Ranking Member 
SAM
GRAVES, 
Subcommittee 
Chair 
CARBAJAL, and Ranking Member GIBBS 
for their bipartisan efforts on this leg-
islation. I want to thank the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
GARAMENDI), my friend, for working 
with us to ensure that American mari-
ners are given a level playing field, and 
I want to thank all Members involved 
for the efforts to help to bolster the 
Coast Guard. 
Mr. Speaker, the Coast Guard is 
often described as a Swiss Army knife. 
You take all the laws that are enforced 
on terrestrial grounds, and we effec-
tively put all of those on the Coast 
Guard men and women to be carried 
out or enforced on America’s oceans, 
on our seas, and our near-shore waters. 
This is an incredible task. Everything 
from maritime safety, maritime secu-
rity, counter drug, alien interdiction 
and many, many other missions. 
We have got to make sure if we are 
going to ask them to do such a chal-
lenging task that we give them the 
equipment. This bill authorizes the 
twelfth National Security Cutter. It 
authorizes six of the Fast Response 
Cutter, the Sentinel-class vessels that 
are going to bring better interoper-
ability, better offensive capabilities, 
faster transit speed, the ability to op-
erate in much more adverse conditions 
in regard to sea state, many, many 
other things. 
This also includes a provision that 
Don Young included that prohibits 
Russian vessels from being in Alaskan 
waters, and I think that is very impor-
tant, especially considering what we 
are going through right now. I think 
that is absolutely critical. 
It also includes a provision that Con-
gressman HUFFMAN and I worked on on 
a bipartisan basis to ensure that AIS, 
the automatic identification system, 
requirements for fishing vessels of cer-
tain sizes are being applied to prevent 
illegal fishing or fishing that is beyond 
catch limits in our waters, so very, 
very important legislation being ad-
vanced today. 
I want to thank everybody for work-
ing on it and, most importantly, I want 
to thank the fact that this bill is being 
named after Congressman Don Young. 
This is much deserved. I had the 
chance to work for him under John 
Rayfield when he was chair and abso-
lutely very much deserve. I support the 
legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS), a member 
of the committee. 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for working with 
me to meet President Biden’s goal of 
deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind

energy by 2030 as we transition to a 
clean energy economy. 
While I support funding the Coast 
Guard, I am deeply concerned that a 
provision in this bill would prevent us 
from 
meeting 
this 
imperative. 
To 
achieve 30 gigawatts by 2030, the 
United States will need five to six wind 
turbine installation vessels. Currently, 
there are only three in the world. This 
provision would prevent the use of 
these vessels and halt the only means 
we have to install and maintain wind 
turbines in the short term. 
Not only would this put those 30 
gigawatts of clean energy out of reach 
by 2030, it would also threaten thou-
sands of good-paying union jobs in 
Massachusetts. I share the chairman’s 
goal of staffing offshore wind projects 
with American workers in the long 
term. 
Indeed, with my colleague, the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
KEATING), I have secured funding to 
help train those workers, but there will 
be no jobs and no offshore wind energy 
if this amendment is passed and the de-
velopment of offshore wind is stillborn. 
I ask for a commitment to work in con-
ference to ensure a seamless transition 
to American workers that does not 
jeopardize access to wind turbine in-
stallation vessels for current and fu-
ture development of offshore wind 
projects. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER), the 
ranking member of the Water Re-
sources 
and 
Environment 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, it is so 
fitting that today we are passing the 
Coast Guard reauthorization bill, a 
very good bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion, naming it in honor of our dear 
friend and colleague, Don Young of 
Alaska, who did so much during his 
time here for the Coast Guard. 
A fixture in the House for 49 years, 
Don Young took care of the needs of 
Alaskans like no other could. So it was 
a natural fit for him to serve as chair-
man of both the Natural Resources 
Committee and the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee during his 
time here. His accomplishments for 
Alaska and throughout the course of 
his life are well known and numerous. 
He was certainly a throw-back to the 
old days on Capitol Hill. He fought 
hard for his constituents, for Alaska, 
for America. He had the force of a lion, 
but great compassion. And, boy did he 
know how to live life to the fullest. He 
was the perfect public servant for he 
had two attributes one must have to 
survive and serve the public well: A 
tough hide but a tender heart. That is 
the gentleman from Alaska that I got 
to know. That is the man who, with his 
dear wife, Anne, by his side, told me at 
my birthday party last month that he 
wanted to get the show on the road, go 
up to the stage and sing happy birth-
day. I simply said, ‘‘Yes, sir,’’ and what 
a memorable night he made it. 
b 1545 
Sometimes words cannot properly de-
scribe a man, for the emotions that stir 
the heart are so powerful, words cannot 
possibly reflect them. That is how it 
feels for me, anyway. 
But let it be said many times over: 
Don Young was a force, a legend in his 
own time. And America is better and 
greater because of him. 
Let’s pass this Coast Guard reauthor-
ization bill in honor of our great friend, 
Don Young. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to the time remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 51⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Missouri 
has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. KEATING). 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I asso-
ciate myself with the remarks of my 
colleagues regarding our late colleague 
Don Young, my friend, someone I 
worked with on fishing issues, ferry 
issues, air service issues. He will be 
sorely missed. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6865, which makes significant invest-
ments in the extraordinary work of the 
United States Coast Guard. 
I have deep concerns, though, about 
one provision in the bill regarding the 
sole-sourced crewing of foreign vessels 
needed to construct the first offshore 
wind projects in our country. This lan-
guage will prevent existing crews from 
building already planned offshore wind 
projects years before the ships can be 
built and long before American seamen 
are trained to take on these jobs. 
We all support U.S. jobs, but here at 
home, this industry is at its relative 
infancy. The requirements in this pro-
vision will prevent participation of the 
existing fleet of vessels needed to begin 
construction on these projects while no 
U.S. alternative exists. 
This will cost us jobs, jeopardizing 
more than 3,600 jobs, largely union 
jobs, from the Vineyard Wind project 
in my district alone and create years of 
delays to the building of offshore wind 
projects with an estimated 20,000 new 
jobs across the eastern seaboard. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the chairman to 
work with me to amend this language 
in conference to ensure that the United 
States does not falter as we take our 
first steps into this burgeoning indus-
try, one that will increase our energy 
independence, create American jobs, 
and move us away from our reliance on 
fossil fuels. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, cer-
tainly, I would assure both this gen-
tleman 
and 
Representative 
AUCHINCLOSS that I will be happy to 
work with the two of them as the legis-
lation goes to the Senate. 
I want to move toward employing 
qualified American mariners and to 
have the people who work on these 
ships meet the same requirements as 
American mariners. 
Flags of convenience have destroyed 
the U.S. maritime industry. We are 
going to rebuild it, and we are going to 
rebuild it with American crews and 
ships. Dominion Resources is currently 
building an insertion ship. 
I certainly do not want to impede 
projects in the near term, Vineyard 
Wind and others that are immediately 
pending, and we will work to ensure 
there are no disruptions as we move to-
ward a cleaner energy future. 
I would be happy to work with the 
two gentlemen and others who are con-
cerned. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. 
BURCHETT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
stand here not to talk about the bill 
but to talk about my friend, Don 
Young. 
When I first got up here, I told Don 
that I was an avid gold panner in Knox-
ville, Tennessee, yet, in my lifetime, I 
had never found one flake of gold. He 
told me if I would come to Alaska, he 
said: ‘‘Timmy, I could put you on some 
gold.’’ And we talked about our love of 
the outdoors. 
We also talked about our love of tra-
ditional country music, Mr. Speaker. 
Rick Crawford had his little band over 
here playing one night, and they were 
playing some good old country music, 
some Johnny Paycheck, the music that 
speaks to your heart. Don and I were 
talking about the current state of 
country music and just how horrible it 
was, and if I wanted to listen to rock 
music, I would turn on a rock station; 
if I wanted to listen to rap, I would 
turn on a rap station; but, dadgummit, 
country music was what we wanted to 
hear, and these country music people 
today are not country music people. I 
would put it in Don’s words, but I 
would probably be called out on an eth-
ics charge, Mr. Speaker, so I will not 
do that. 
I stand here today as a friend of Don 
Young’s and someone who will miss 
him dearly. I will miss his abrupt, gruff 
way about himself. My daddy was quite 
like that, and I grew up in that house-
hold, and I understand completely. Don 
had a rough exterior, but he was a very 
gentle person, and I will miss him dear-
ly. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Missouri for yield-
ing. 
What a great tribute, to be naming 
this Coast Guard reauthorization bill 
after Don Young. While we mourn his 
loss today and pay tribute to Don in 
Statuary Hall, his family was here, and 
as you are paying tribute to a great 
life, the dean of the House who served 
49 years in this great Chamber from 
the 49th State of Alaska, you can’t

help but think of all the Don Young 
stories. 
Clearly, there is a tie to this bill be-
cause Don served on the Coast Guard 
and 
Maritime 
Transportation 
Sub-
committee for his entire tenure that 
the committee was in existence. Don 
loved the Coast Guard, loved the rela-
tionship they had in Alaska, just try-
ing to get more icebreakers so that we 
could keep up with Russians con-
tinuing to open up their shipping lanes, 
but our not having the ability to get 
enough Coast Guard cutters to break 
ice in Alaska. 
Don Young was always a champion 
for Alaska. He was a great friend. He 
was somebody who you knew where he 
stood all the time. And if you stood in 
his way, he would make it clear that he 
was going to keep moving forward. 
As we look at the seat that Don 
Young always sat in, in a Chamber of 
435 people where there are no reserved 
seats, everybody knows that is where 
Don Young sat. When you look over 
there today, it is a little bit sad, but 
you can only think of great memories 
of Don Young when you see the black 
cloth draped over that seat. 
We 
will 
always 
remember 
Don 
Young, a man who loved this country, 
surely loved the Coast Guard, and epit-
omized what is the great State of Alas-
ka. No better champion they had in 
Congress than Don Young. 
I look forward to passing this bill 
with overwhelming support. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD). 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Missouri for 
yielding. 
I rise today to recognize the passing 
of my friend and colleague, Represent-
ative Don Young. 
While many accomplished and effec-
tive men and women have served here 
in the House of Representatives over 
the years, very few have built a legacy 
like Representative Young. 
Over the last almost 12 years, I have 
had the honor of serving with him on 
the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee, where he spent untold 
hours fighting for stronger investment 
in American infrastructure. The Don 
Young Coast Guard Authorization Act 
on the floor today is just one of many 
examples of this. 
Don took his job as dean of the House 
seriously. He regularly offered advice 
to colleagues, like his warnings to me 
to never shave my beard. He was eager 
to welcome Members and their families 
to Capitol Hill. My kids loved getting a 
tour of his office and hearing his wild 
hunting stories. 
Representative Young will be remem-
bered for his boisterous personality and 
outrageous anecdotes, but above all, he 
will be remembered for his passion for 
the people of Alaska. 
I am thankful for the time I served 
with Representative Young, and my 
prayers are with his family, friends, 
staff, and constituents. 
Today, I encourage my colleagues to 
honor our friend and support H.R. 6865. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire as to how much time 
is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 41⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Oregon 
has 21⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. CALVERT). 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this legislation. 
Don represented Alaska in this House 
for nearly as long as Alaska has been a 
State. Don was a ferocious advocate for 
the people he represented, not the least 
of whom were Alaska’s Native people, 
who held a special place in his heart. 
We are going to miss Don. He was a 
champion for the North Slope, Alaska’s 
commercial fisheries, and infrastruc-
ture, obviously. Don spent his career 
fighting for his constituents to use 
Alaska’s vast natural resources to 
bring prosperity to his State. 
Don knew what made our country 
great and how to work across the aisle 
to deliver for the people of Alaska. 
Don was my first committee chair-
man when I came here 30 years ago, 
and he quickly found me and said: ‘‘I 
heard you want to be on my com-
mittee.’’ I said: ‘‘Yes, Mr. Chairman.’’ 
‘‘Well, do whatever I tell you, and you 
will be just fine.’’ I think, at some time 
or another, all of us have lived by those 
words. 
I will miss Don. I will miss his friend-
ship, his humor, and his passion. My 
thoughts and prayers go out to his 
wife, Anne, and the family. 
Rest in peace, Don. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I had the 
honor to serve 26 years here in the 
House with Don Young. 
There is an expression some of our 
Texans have about not messing with 
Texas. Well, with Don Young, you 
knew not to mess with Alaska. 
We butted heads on that several 
times, but we remained friends. When 
my family and I went to Alaska some 
years ago, he told us the places not to 
miss. It was a family vacation. It was 
wonderful. We stopped by the State fair 
there, and we picked up ‘‘I’m a Young 
Man’’ buttons—this is one today—and 
‘‘I’m a Young Woman’’ buttons for my 
wife 
and 
daughter. 
Periodically, 
I 
would wear it here in the House, and he 
always got a kick out of that. 
Now, Don Young is gone, and as they 
said about Lincoln, he now belongs to 
the ages. He will be long remembered 
in this place, and he will certainly be 
long remembered in Alaska. 
May Don rest in peace. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL). 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, what can 
you say about Don in 30 seconds? I al-
ways saw him as a captain, the tugboat 
captain, the captain of the ship. 
Don was the captain of this ship, this 
great institution, the House. Don was 
rough on the exterior like his State, 
rugged and larger than life, but he had 
a heart for serving others. 
I will never forget going to the White 
House when we signed the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act into law. ANWR opened up. 
He did a little jig in front of the White 
House. I think that may have been one 
of the days he broke his promise of 
maybe having a little drink. 
But I will say this: I will always 
cherish my last day in the House sit-
ting right next to him. The very last 
day, we were here for an hour talking 
about this great institution, talking 
about our families, what is important 
in life. Little did I know that the next 
day he would be lost. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman an addi-
tional 5 seconds. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, let 
me say in closing, Don planned to serve 
in Congress until God or the voters de-
cided it was his time. It is no coinci-
dence that God called him home on his 
49th year in Congress as a Representa-
tive for the 49th State. 
May God hold Don in the palms of his 
hands. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 21⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Oregon 
has 21⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ISSA). 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, Don 
Young has 50 years of stories, and I will 
tell you just one in 20 seconds. 
Madam Speaker, Don Young, faced 
with a young Member wanting to affect 
bypass mail in Alaska, could have 
dressed me down and told me over his 
dead body. Instead, he directed me to 
go to Alaska to see how bypass mail 
was done in the post office there. He 
sent me to an Aleutian Island, sent me 
to a few other appropriate places, and 
changed my view of why we have by-
pass mail. 
That is the Don Young I will remem-
ber. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding.

March 29, 2022 
I rise in support of the Don Young 
Coast Guard Authorization Act, which 
ensures that the dedicated men and 
women of the U.S. Coast Guard are 
adequately trained and equipped to ful-
fill their critical mission of securing 
America’s coastlines. 
It has been an honor for me, as a 3- 
year Member of Congress, to serve 
alongside Don Young and always sit be-
hind him and hear him. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1600 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. VAN 
DREW). 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Don Young Coast 
Guard Authorization Act of 2022. 
Congressman Young brought a dis-
tinct candor and a character to Con-
gress. This body and our country are 
better off thanks to his service, and he 
will be dearly missed. I am proud to 
note that this legislation authorizes 
$120 million for the construction of new 
barracks at the United States Coast 
Guard Training Center Cape May in 
New Jersey. 
The barracks project will expand op-
portunities for women to serve in the 
Coast Guard as well as expand the 
training center’s recruitment capacity 
by 25 percent. The United States must 
project strength, and this legislation 
will ensure that the United States is 
ready to address the challenges pre-
sented by adversaries such as Russia 
and China. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
my district is home to Coast Guard 
Station New York and is the largest 
Coast Guard station on the East Coast. 
This legislation authorizes $1.2 million 
in needed repairs to ensure their mis-
sion and day-to-day operations con-
tinue. I thank everyone for this bipar-
tisan effort. 
Madam Speaker, to say that Don 
Young was an amazing man would be 
an understatement. He was one of the 
first Members I met as a freshman. He 
advocated to help me to get on the 
Committee on Transportation and In-
frastructure. I know how much he 
loved the Coast Guard. I know how 
much he loved Alaska. And it is so fit-
ting that we are naming this legisla-
tion after him. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the life and service of 
the late Congressman Don Young of 
Alaska, former dean of the United 
States House of Representatives. It is 
fitting that this Coast Guard reauthor-
ization, 
which 
we 
are 
considering 
today, is named in his memory. 
Congressman Young made a lasting 
impact on this institution and his leg-
acy of service will endure far into the 
future. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 30 seconds 
remaining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, this is obviously a fitting 
tribute, but we ran out of time. A lot of 
people wanted to say something about 
Don, and I apologize that we ran out of 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I close by thanking 
the chairman of both the committee 
and the subcommittee and the ranking 
member, for putting this bill together. 
It is very much a bipartisan effort. But 
I particularly want to thank the staffs 
on both sides of the aisle for the work 
that they did, and in particular, John 
Rayfield, who had the opportunity to 
work with Chairman Young when he 
was chairman of the committee as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this very important 
piece of legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, it was very fitting 
the tributes that we heard. We all have 
stories about Don, and I wish we had 
more time to share, but his many dec-
ades of work will stand as a monument 
to his life, and this bill, in particular, 
will honor his extraordinary service on 
the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure. I think it was called 
Public Works when Don first came to 
serve here. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this bill. As I mentioned earlier, we are 
finally recognizing that the Coast 
Guard has been under resourced for 
decades. We are beginning to deal with 
that problem, their shoreside infra-
structure, their assets at sea, and in 
particular, the extraordinary people 
who serve in the United States Coast 
Guard. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have 
named the bill for Don. I would urge 
that this bill be unanimously approved 
by our colleagues, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of H.R. 6865, the Don Young 
Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2022. 
I’d like to first acknowledge the sudden 
passing of Don Young, the Dean of the 
House, and the former Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I 
extend my condolences to his wife and family, 
and also to his staff. I had the pleasure of 
working with him on the Carson/Young bill, to 
create the National Center for the Advance-
ment of Aviation, which is a bipartisan and a 
bicameral bill to improve aviation, which is so 
important to both of our states, Alaska and In-
diana. It’s only fitting that today’s Coast Guard 
bill is now named in Congressman Young’s 
memory. 
Chairman DEFAZIO, I commend your leader-
ship, and your collaboration on this Coast 
Guard bill, with Ranking Member GRAVES, 
Coast Guard Subcommittee Chair CARBAJAL 
and Ranking Member GIBBS. I am pleased to 
join our committee colleagues in supporting 
the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act because 
it will increase maritime safety and efficiency. 
Chairman DEFAZIO, I am especially grateful 
to you for working with me over several years 
to develop the language that will finally ad-
dress the persistent problems with unsafe ves-
sels, and including my Duck Boat Safety Im-
provement Act in today’s Coast Guard Reau-
thorization. 
My Duck Boat Safety requirements, in Title 
III, Section 305, will finally implement safety 
regulations for amphibious passenger vessels, 
particularly those known as Duck Boats. 
These safety recommendations were made by 
federal agencies to address repeated prob-
lems associated with Duck Boats that have re-
sulted in many injuries and fatalities that may 
have been prevented. 
I became much more aware of these prob-
lems when my constituents in Indianapolis, the 
Coleman family, were involved in a horrible 
Duck Boat accident on July 19, 2018 in 
Branson, Missouri. Tia Coleman was one of 
only two survivors from her family of 11, losing 
her husband Glenn and her children Reece 
(nine years old), Evan (seven years old), and 
Arya (one year old). Tia’s 13-year-old nephew, 
Donovan, was the other surviving family mem-
ber, losing his mother Angela, his younger 
brother Maxwell (two years old), his uncles 
Ervin (76 years old) and Butch (70 years old), 
and his aunt Belinda (69 years old). Boarding 
a Duck Boat on Table Rock Lake started out 
as a fun outing for family members, but it 
turned into an unspeakable tragedy when the 
boat capsized and sank. Seventeen of the 31 
passengers on board were killed. 
The National Transportation Safety Board 
(NTSB) and U.S. Coast Guard have sepa-
rately investigated the incident and the last 
few aspects of the investigation should be 
completed soon. 
But Congress should not wait to act. We 
know from past incidents that more can and 
should be done to make these vessels safer. 
Since 1999, more than 40 people have died in 
Duck Boats accidents, the vast majority of 
them from drowning when the vessel sinks. 
The NTSB in 2002 issued recommendations 
to improve the safety of these vessels in flood-
ing or sinking situations but little has been 
done to implement those measures. 
Duck Boats are hybrid vehicles that can 
travel on roadways and waterways, so the 
safety measures must be updated for both 
land and waterborne operations. 
The Duck Boat Safety Improvement Act will 
require vessel operators to implement com-
mon-sense boating safety measures, includ-
ing: 
Improving reserve buoyancy and watertight 
compartmentalization to prevent sinking, 
Requiring more monitoring and adherence 
to severe weather alerts and warnings, 
Requiring release of road safety seatbelts 
when Duck Boats become waterborne, 
Requiring stronger crew safety training and 
certification, 
Removing or reconfigure canopies and win-
dow coverings for waterborne operations, 
Requiring personal flotation devices for wa-
terborne operations,

Requiring installation of better bilge pumps 
and alarms, 
Installing underwater LED lights that activate 
automatically in emergencies, and 
Complying with other Coast Guard boating 
safety requirements. 
These basic safety requirements will help 
save lives and prevent future tragedies. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting today’s bill to make commonsense cor-
rections to the persistent safety problems fac-
ing duck boats. If we act today, we can help 
ensure that no other family has to suffer the 
kind of tragedy faced by my constituents on 
Table Rock Lake. I urge the House to support 
this bill. 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I come from 
a coastal district in Virginia, and the respon-
sibilities and duties of the Coast Guard are in-
tegral to our everyday activities. 
While I will vote to support the Don Young 
Coast Guard Authorization Act for all these 
reasons, I must express my concerns with lan-
guage that was added to the bill in committee 
that makes significant modifications to crewing 
aboard the important and unique vessels that 
do the work lifting turbines on our growing and 
important offshore wind farms including a new 
project in development off the coast of Vir-
ginia. 
This provision assumes that the United 
States presently has a sufficient number of 
vessels and mariners to perform this work. But 
as a recent report from DoE just states, we 
need 3–5 of these vessels and hundreds of 
skilled workers but unfortunately we currently 
lack them. 
The proposed crewing changes—which go 
into effect immediately—would block the 
progress Virginia and other states along the 
Atlantic coast are making to produce clean en-
ergy and reduce the negative impacts of cli-
mate change. 
I’m willing to continue working with the 
Members of the Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee on a reliable crewing scheme 
that protects our national interests while en-
suring that vital energy work can be done. 
This is not the right time to make this imme-
diate and drastic change in the law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 6865, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

ury 
Regulation

dividual’s account balance, and to make such 
corresponding changes to the regulations 
and related forms as are necessary to reflect 
the elimination of this requirement.

FITS.—The Secretary shall amend Q&A–17(c) 
of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)–6,

essary, to provide that, in the case of a 
qualifying longevity annuity contract which 
was purchased with joint and survivor annu-
ity benefits for the individual and the indi-
vidual’s spouse which were permissible under 
the regulations at the time the contract was 
originally purchased, a divorce occurring 
after the original purchase and before the 
annuity payments commence under the con-
tract will not affect the permissibility of the 
joint and survivor annuity benefits or other 
benefits under the contract, or require any 
adjustment to the amount or duration of 
benefits payable under the contract, pro-
vided that any qualified domestic relations 
order (within the meaning of section 414(p) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) or, in the 
case of an arrangement not subject to sec-
tion 414(p) of such Code or section 206(d) of 
the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1056(d)), any divorce or 
separation instrument (as defined in sub-

tled to the survivor benefits under the con-
tract;

former spouse as the beneficiary under the 
contract who is entitled to the survivor ben-
efits; or 
(C) does not modify the treatment of the 
former spouse as the measuring life for the 
survivor benefits under the contract. 
(3) PERMIT SHORT FREE LOOK PERIOD.—The 
Secretary shall amend Q&A–17(a)(4) of Treas-
ury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)–6 to ensure 
that such Q&A does not preclude a contract 
from including a provision under which an 
employee may rescind the purchase of the

days from the date of purchase. 
(b) DIVORCE OR SEPARATION INSTRUMENT.— 
For purposes of subsection (a)(2), the term

paragraph (1) of this subsection; and 
(B) taxpayers may rely upon their reason-
able good faith interpretations of subsection 
(a). 
(d) REGULATORY
SUCCESSOR
PROVISION.— 
Any reference to a regulation under this sec-
tion shall be treated as including a reference 
to any successor regulation thereto. 
SEC. 203. INSURANCE-DEDICATED EXCHANGE- 
TRADED FUNDS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than the date 
which is 7 years after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treas-
ury (or the Secretary’s delegate) shall amend

versification Requirements for Variable An-
nuity, Endowment, and Life Insurance Con-
tracts’’, 54 Fed. Reg. 8728 (March 2, 1989), and

the fund and to sell such shares to third par-
ties, but only if the contractual arrangement

stitution from— 
(A) purchasing the shares for its own in-
vestment purposes rather than for the exclu-
sive purpose of creating and redeeming such

TITLE III—SIMPLIFICATION AND CLARI-

SEC. 301. RECOVERY OF RETIREMENT PLAN 
OVERPAYMENTS. 
(a) OVERPAYMENTS UNDER ERISA.—Section 
206 of the Employee Retirement Income Se-
curity Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1056) is amended 
by adding at the end the following new sub-
section: 
‘‘(h) SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE
TO BEN-
EFIT OVERPAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) GENERAL RULE.—In the case of an inad-
vertent benefit overpayment by any pension 
plan, the responsible plan fiduciary shall not 
be considered to have failed to comply with 
the requirements of this title merely because 
such fiduciary determines, in the exercise of 
its fiduciary discretion, not to seek recovery 
of all or part of such overpayment from— 
‘‘(A) any participant or beneficiary, 
‘‘(B) any plan sponsor of, or contributing 
employer to— 
‘‘(i) an individual account plan, provided 
that the amount needed to prevent or restore 
any impermissible forfeiture from any par-
ticipant’s or beneficiary’s account arising in 
connection with the overpayment is, sepa-
rately from and independently of the over-
payment, allocated to such account pursuant 
to the nonforfeitability requirements of sec-
tion 203 (for example, out of the plan’s for-
feiture account, additional employer con-
tributions, or recoveries from those respon-
sible for the overpayment), or 
‘‘(ii) a defined benefit pension plan subject 
to the funding rules in part 3 of this subtitle 
B, unless the responsible plan fiduciary de-
termines, in the exercise of its fiduciary dis-
cretion, that failure to recover all or part of 
the overpayment faster than required under 
such funding rules would materially affect 
the plan’s ability to pay benefits due to 
other participants and beneficiaries, or 
‘‘(C) any fiduciary of the plan, other than 
a fiduciary (including a plan sponsor or con-
tributing employer acting in a fiduciary ca-
pacity) whose breach of its fiduciary duties 
resulted in such overpayment, provided that 
if the plan has established prudent proce-
dures to prevent and minimize overpayment 
of benefits and the relevant plan fiduciaries 
have followed such procedures, an inad-
vertent benefit overpayment will not give 
rise to a breach of fiduciary duty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3932 
March 29, 2022 
PARTY.—Paragraph (1) shall not fail to apply 
with respect to any inadvertent benefit over-
payment merely because, after discovering 
such overpayment, the responsible plan fidu-
ciary— 
‘‘(A) reduces future benefit payments to 
the correct amount provided for under the 
terms of the plan, or 
‘‘(B) seeks recovery from the person or per-
sons responsible for the overpayment. 
‘‘(3) 
EMPLOYER
FUNDING
OBLIGATIONS.— 
Nothing in this subsection shall relieve an 
employer of any obligation imposed on it to 
make contributions to a plan to meet the 
minimum funding standards under part 3 of 
this subtitle B or to prevent or restore an 
impermissible forfeiture in accordance with 
section 203. 
‘‘(4) RECOUPMENT
FROM
PARTICIPANTS
AND 
BENEFICIARIES.—If the responsible plan fidu-
ciary, in the exercise of its fiduciary discre-
tion, decides to seek recoupment from a par-
ticipant or beneficiary of all or part of an in-
advertent benefit overpayment made by the 
plan to such participant or beneficiary, it 
may do so, subject to the following condi-
tions: 
‘‘(A) 
No 
interest 
or 
other 
additional 
amounts (such as collection costs or fees) are 
sought on overpaid amounts for any period. 
‘‘(B) If the plan seeks to recoup past over-
payments of a non-decreasing periodic ben-
efit by reducing future benefit payments— 
‘‘(i) the reduction ceases after the plan has 
recovered the full dollar amount of the over-
payment, 
‘‘(ii) the amount recouped each calendar 
year does not exceed 10 percent of the full 
dollar amount of the overpayment, and 
‘‘(iii) future benefit payments are not re-
duced to below 90 percent of the periodic 
amount otherwise payable under the terms 
of the plan. 
Alternatively, if the plan seeks to recoup 
past overpayments of a non-decreasing peri-
odic benefit through one or more installment 
payments, the sum of such installment pay-
ments in any calendar year does not exceed 
the sum of the reductions that would be per-
mitted in such year under the preceding sen-
tence. 
‘‘(C) If the plan seeks to recoup past over-
payments of a benefit other than a non-de-
creasing periodic benefit, the plan satisfies 
requirements developed by the Secretary for 
purposes of this subparagraph. 
‘‘(D) Efforts to recoup overpayments are— 
‘‘(i) not accompanied by threats of litiga-
tion, unless the responsible plan fiduciary 
reasonably believes it could prevail in a civil 
action brought in Federal or State court to 
recoup the overpayments, and 
‘‘(ii) not made through a collection agency 
or similar third party, unless the participant 
or beneficiary ignores or rejects efforts to re-
coup the overpayment following either a 
final judgment in Federal or State court or 
a settlement between the participant or ben-
eficiary and the plan, in either case author-
izing such recoupment. 
‘‘(E) Recoupment of past overpayments to 
a participant is not sought from any bene-
ficiary of the participant, including a spouse, 
surviving spouse, former spouse, or other 
beneficiary. 
‘‘(F) Recoupment may not be sought if the 
first overpayment occurred more than 3 
years before the participant or beneficiary is 
first notified in writing of the error. 
‘‘(G) A participant or beneficiary from 
whom recoupment is sought is entitled to 
contest all or part of the recoupment pursu-
ant to the plan’s claims procedures. 
‘‘(H) 
In 
determining 
the 
amount 
of 
recoupment to seek, the responsible plan fi-
duciary may take into account the hardship 
that recoupment likely would impose on the 
participant or beneficiary. 
‘‘(5) 
EFFECT
OF
CULPABILITY.—Subpara-
graphs (A) through (F) of paragraph (4) shall 
not apply to protect a participant or bene-
ficiary who is culpable. For purposes of this 
paragraph, a participant or beneficiary is 
culpable if the individual bears responsi-
bility for the overpayment (such as through 
misrepresentations or omissions that led to 
the overpayment), or if the individual knew, 
or had good reason to know under the cir-
cumstances, that the benefit payment or 
payments were materially in excess of the 
correct amount. Notwithstanding the pre-
ceding sentence, an individual is not cul-
pable merely because the individual believed 
the benefit payment or payments were or 
might be in excess of the correct amount, if 
the individual raised that question with an 
authorized plan representative and was told 
the payment or payments were not in excess 
of the correct amount. With respect to a cul-
pable participant or beneficiary, efforts to 
recoup overpayments shall not be made 
through threats of litigation, unless a lawyer 
for the plan could make the representations 
required under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure if the litigation were 
brought in Federal court.’’. 
(b) OVERPAYMENTS UNDER INTERNAL REV-
ENUE CODE OF 1986.— 
(1) QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.—Section 
414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended by this preceding provisions of this 
Act, is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new subsection: 
‘‘(bb) SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE TO BEN-
EFIT OVERPAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A plan shall not fail to 
be treated as described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), 
or (iv) of section 219(g)(5)(A) (and shall not 
fail to be treated as satisfying the require-
ments of section 401(a) or 403) merely be-
cause— 
‘‘(A) the plan fails to obtain payment from 
any participant, beneficiary, employer, plan 
sponsor, fiduciary, or other party on account 
of any inadvertent benefit overpayment 
made by the plan, or 
‘‘(B) the plan sponsor amends the plan to 
increase past or future benefit payments to 
affected participants and beneficiaries in 
order to adjust for prior inadvertent benefit 
overpayments. 
‘‘(2) REDUCTION
IN
FUTURE
BENEFIT
PAY-
MENTS
AND
RECOVERY
FROM
RESPONSIBLE 
PARTY.—Paragraph (1) shall not fail to apply 
to a plan merely because, after discovering a 
benefit overpayment, such plan— 
‘‘(A) reduces future benefit payments to 
the correct amount provided for under the 
terms of the plan, or 
‘‘(B) seeks recovery from the person or per-
sons responsible for such overpayment. 
‘‘(3) 
EMPLOYER
FUNDING
OBLIGATIONS.— 
Nothing in this subsection shall relieve an 
employer of any obligation imposed on it to 
make contributions to a plan to meet the 
minimum funding standards under sections 
412 and 430 or to prevent or restore an imper-
missible forfeiture in accordance with sec-
tion 411. 
‘‘(4) OBSERVANCE OF BENEFIT LIMITATIONS.— 
Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a plan to 
which paragraph (1) applies shall observe any 
limitations 
imposed 
on 
it 
by 
section 
401(a)(17) or 415. The plan may enforce such 
limitations using any method approved by 
the Secretary of the Treasury for recouping 
benefits previously paid or allocations pre-
viously made in excess of such limitations. 
‘‘(5) COORDINATION WITH OTHER QUALIFICA-
TION
REQUIREMENTS.—The Secretary of the 
Treasury may issue regulations or other 
guidance of general applicability specifying 
how 
benefit 
overpayments 
and 
their 
recoupment or non-recoupment from a par-
ticipant or beneficiary shall be taken into 
account for purposes of satisfying any re-
quirement applicable to a plan to which 
paragraph (1) applies.’’. 
(2) ROLLOVERS.—Section 402(c) of such Code 
is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new paragraph: 
‘‘(12) In the case of an inadvertent benefit 
overpayment from a plan to which section 
414(bb)(1) applies that is transferred to an el-
igible retirement plan by or on behalf of a 
participant or beneficiary— 
‘‘(A) the portion of such overpayment with 
respect to which recoupment is not sought 
on behalf of the plan shall be treated as hav-
ing been paid in an eligible rollover distribu-
tion if the payment would have been an eligi-
ble rollover distribution but for being an 
overpayment, and 
‘‘(B) the portion of such overpayment with 
respect to which recoupment is sought on be-
half of the plan shall be permitted to be re-
turned to such plan and in such case shall be 
treated as an eligible rollover distribution 
transferred to such plan by the participant 
or beneficiary who received such overpay-
ment (and the plans making and receiving 
such transfer shall be treated as permitting 
such transfer). 
In any case in which recoupment is sought 
on behalf of the plan but is disputed by the 
participant or beneficiary who received such 
overpayment, such dispute shall be subject 
to the claims procedures of the plan that 
made such overpayment, such plan shall no-
tify the plan receiving the rollover of such 
dispute, and the plan receiving the rollover 
shall retain such overpayment on behalf of 
the participant or beneficiary (and shall be 
entitled to treat such overpayment as plan 
assets) pending the outcome of such proce-
dures.’’. 
(c) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The amendments 
made by this section shall apply as of the 
date of the enactment of this Act. 
(d) CERTAIN ACTIONS BEFORE DATE OF EN-
ACTMENT.—Plans, fiduciaries, employers, and 
plan sponsors are entitled to rely on— 
(1) a good faith interpretation of then ex-
isting administrative guidance for inad-
vertent benefit overpayment recoupments 
and recoveries that commenced before the 
date of enactment of this Act, and 
(2) determinations made before the date of 
enactment of this Act by the responsible 
plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its fidu-
ciary discretion, not to seek recoupment or 
recovery of all or part of an inadvertent ben-
efit overpayment. 
In the case of a benefit overpayment that oc-
curred prior to the date of enactment of this 
Act, any installment payments by the par-
ticipant or beneficiary to the plan or any re-
duction in periodic benefit payments to the 
participant or beneficiary, which were made 
in recoupment of such overpayment and 
which commenced prior to such date, may 
continue after such date. Nothing in this 
subsection shall relieve a fiduciary from re-
sponsibility for an overpayment that re-
sulted from a breach of its fiduciary duties.

holdings of the designated investment alter-
native;

ably designed to be understandable; and

rately satisfy the requirements of such regu-
lation for such asset class.

this section referred to as the ‘‘EPCRS’’), ex-
cept to the extent that such failure was iden-
tified by the Secretary prior to any actions 
which demonstrate a commitment to imple-
ment a self-correction. Revenue Procedure

the enactment of this Act to provide that 
the correction period under section 9.02 of 
such Revenue Procedure (or any successor 
guidance) for an eligible inadvertent failure, 
except as otherwise provided under such 
Code or in regulations prescribed by the Sec-
retary, is indefinite and has no last day, 
other than with respect to failures identified 
by the Secretary prior to any self-correction 
as described in the preceding sentence. 
(b) LOAN ERRORS.—In the case of an eligi-
ble inadvertent failure relating to a loan 
from a plan to a participant—

tion 6.07 of Revenue Procedure 2021–30 (or

sions related to whether a deemed distribu-
tion must be reported on Form 1099–R, and 
(2) the Secretary of Labor shall treat any 
such failure which is so self-corrected under

of the Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Pro-
gram of the Department of Labor if, with re-
spect to the violation of the fiduciary stand-
ards of the Employee Retirement Income Se-
curity Act of 1974, there is a similar loan 
error eligible for correction under EPCRS 
and the loan error is corrected in such man-
ner. 
(c) EPCRS FOR IRAS.—The Secretary shall 
expand the EPCRS to allow custodians of in-
dividual retirement plans (as defined in sec-
tion 7701(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986) to address eligible inadvertent fail-
ures with respect to an individual retirement 
plan (as so defined), including (but not lim-
ited to)— 
(1) waivers of the excise tax which would 
otherwise apply under section 4974 of the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986, 
(2) under the self-correction component of 
the EPCRS, waivers of the 60-day deadline 
for a rollover where the deadline is missed 
for reasons beyond the reasonable control of 
the account owner, and 
(3) rules permitting a nonspouse bene-
ficiary to return distributions to an inher-
ited individual retirement plan described in 
section 408(d)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 in a case where, due to an inad-
vertent error by a service provider, the bene-
ficiary had reason to believe that the dis-
tribution could be rolled over without inclu-
sion in income of any part of the distributed 
amount. 
(d) ADDITIONAL SAFE HARBORS.—The Sec-
retary shall expand the EPCRS to provide 
additional safe harbor means of correcting 
eligible inadvertent failures described in sub-
section (a), including safe harbor means of 
calculating the earnings which must be re-
stored to a plan in cases where plan assets 
have been depleted by reason of an eligible 
inadvertent failure. 
(e) ELIGIBLE
INADVERTENT
FAILURE.—For 
purposes of this section— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
paragraph (2), the term ‘‘eligible inadvertent 
failure’’ means a failure that occurs despite 
the existence of practices and procedures 
which— 
(A) satisfy the standards set forth in sec-
tion 4.04 of Revenue Procedure 2021–30 (or 
any successor guidance), or 
(B) satisfy similar standards in the case of 
an individual retirement plan.

the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL) and the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BRADY) each will control 40 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2954 will help 
all Americans successfully save for a 
secure retirement by expanding cov-
erage and increasing retirement sav-
ings, simplifying the current retire-
ment system and protecting Ameri-
cans’ retirement accounts. 
Retirement security has consistently 
been one of my top priorities as chair-
man of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. Too many workers in this Na-
tion reach retirement age without hav-
ing the savings they need. In fact—and 
I hope people will listen to this num-
ber—it is estimated that up to 50 per-
cent of the individuals in America who 
go to work every single day do not 
have enrollment in a qualified retire-
ment plan. That means those house-
holds are at risk of not having enough 
to maintain their living standards in 
retirement. 
We need to do more to encourage 
workers to begin planning for retire-
ment earlier and we need to make sav-
ing considerably easier. 
Last Congress, Mr. BRADY
and I 
worked together on a bipartisan basis 
to do that by enacting the SECURE 
Act, one of the most significant retire-
ment bills to become law in well over a 
decade. 
Thanks to the SECURE Act, 4 mil-
lion more Americans are now able to 
save for retirement through their em-
ployers, and as many as 700,000 new re-
tirement accounts will be formed. 
Last year, we built on this progress 
with the passage into law, my legisla-
tion, the Butch Lewis Act. After years 
of fighting for a solution to the multi-
employer pension crisis, the Butch 
Lewis Act saved multiemployer pen-
sion plans from insolvency and secured 
the financial future of over a million 
workers and retirees who have played 
by the rules and made responsible sav-
ings decisions. Think of that and cou-
ple it with what we are about to do 
today with the guarantee of Social Se-
curity, and we will help to improve the 
opportunity for members of American 
families to have a secure retirement. 
Madam Speaker, but more work 
needs to be done. That is why I am 
pleased the H.R. 2954, the Securing a 
Strong Retirement Act of 2022, is be-
fore us today. 
This bipartisan legislation—and by 
bipartisan, let me thank Mr. BRADY 
again for his good work on this legisla-
tion as well—will expand automatic en-
rollment in 401(k) plans by requiring 
401(k), 403(b), and SIMPLE plans to 
automatically enroll participants upon 
becoming eligible, with the ability for 
employees to opt out of coverage— 
which I think, by the way, is not the 
best idea, but we do provide that op-
tion. Expansion of automatic enroll-
ment will significantly increase par-
ticipation in retirement savings plans 
at work. 
H.R. 2954 also enhances the start-up 
credit, making it easier for small busi-
nesses to sponsor a retirement plan. 
And the legislation increases the re-
quired minimum distribution age to 75 
and indexes the catch-up contribution 
limit for individual retirement ac-
counts. These changes will make it

easier for American families to prepare 
for a financially secure retirement. 
On a related note, I think it is impor-
tant to highlight that U.S. defined con-
tribution plans have created a unique 
reservoir of capital in the innovation 
economy. Retirement plans are invest-
ing in areas such as tech, financial 
services, 
digital 
commerce, 
and 
biotech. That means that workers’ re-
tirement assets are directly tying mid-
dle-class workers to our national inno-
vation economy. That certainly is a 
win-win for all of us. 
Madam Speaker, I am really pleased 
that Ranking Member BRADY
and I 
were able to come together on a bipar-
tisan basis to develop this important 
legislation. Once again, it passed the 
Committee on Ways and Means unani-
mously. Our efforts have resulted in an 
excellent product that has broad sup-
port from organizations representing 
diverse interests, including retirees, 
charitable 
organizations, 
financial 
services 
providers, 
police 
officers, 
small businesses, and employers. The 
list of specific supporters is too long to 
read but we can start with the Amer-
ican Red Cross, AARP, and many oth-
ers, which we will submit for the 
RECORD. Hundreds of groups have en-
dorsed this plan. 
Let’s work together to expand retire-
ment savings in America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join 
with my friend, Chairman RICH NEAL, 
in jointly reintroducing SECURE 2.0, 
which will help hardworking Ameri-
cans approach retirement with both 
confidence and dignity. 
For 5 years now, members of the 
Committee on Ways and Means have 
worked tirelessly together to ensure 
Americans have the resources to save 
for a secure retirement. A lot of hard 
work and negotiation has gotten us to 
this point, and I am grateful to Chair-
man NEAL for his commitment to get 
this bill across the finish line to the 
President’s desk. 
It is important to remember how far 
we have come in our joint efforts to 
help Americans better prepare for their 
long-term financial goals. Following 
the historic rewrite of our Tax Code 
with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Re-
publicans moved toward building on 
this success for years to come. 
That happened when the Republicans 
and Democrats worked together to de-
velop and enact the Setting Every 
Community Up for Retirement En-
hancement Act, known as the SECURE 
Act, the most significant retirement 
legislation to become law in over a dec-
ade. 
We made it easier for Main Street 
businesses to offer retirement plans to 
their workers by easing administrative 
burdens, cutting down on unnecessary 
and often costly paperwork. 
The SECURE Act made significant 
improvements to our country’s retire-
ment system. And today, we will do 
even more. 
A recent AARP survey found that ris-
ing prices are taking a big toll on 
workers, making it difficult to cover 
everyday expenses or save for the fu-
ture. In fact, with a 40-year high infla-
tion, nearly a quarter of workers sur-
veyed reported that their financial sit-
uation is worse today than it was last 
year. 
A study also found that nearly 40 per-
cent of workers said that they have no 
emergency savings, with one out of five 
reporting they have nothing saved for 
retirement. Nothing. 
b 1615 
Both groups peg rising prices of ev-
eryday goods as the biggest barrier for 
planning for their financial future. 
Ensuring Americans have the re-
sources they need for a prosperous re-
tirement is a bipartisan priority. And 
with American families’ paychecks 
falling further behind through rising 
prices, it has really never been more 
important for Congress to help workers 
get back on track with their retire-
ment plans. 
With this bill we build on the land-
mark provisions in the SECURE Act, 
enabling 
more 
workers, 
especially 
those with low income and modest in-
come, to begin saving earlier and giv-
ing them piece of mind as they plan for 
the future. 
Our bill, SECURE 2.0 improves work-
ers’ long-term financial wellbeing by 
helping more Americans save for re-
tirement at every stage of their life. 
SECURE 2.0 contains more than 20 pro-
visions sponsored or cosponsored by 
Republicans and Democrats in stand-
alone legislation. 
By providing flexibility, for example, 
we make it easier for local businesses 
to tailor retirement plans to best fit 
the needs of their workers. These re-
forms help Americans not only save 
earlier in their careers, but helps fami-
lies save longer as well. 
We expand access to workplace re-
tirement by increasing the incentives 
for businesses, especially small busi-
nesses, to create new plans or join 
groups of plans while sharing the cost 
of administration. 
To further help small businesses 
shoulder the burden of creating a new 
plan, our bill matches employer con-
tributions with the new business tax 
credit. That can help a small business 
match up to the first $1,000 in match-
ing contributions for that work. 
For those Americans who are further 
along in their career or already in re-
tirement, this bill raises the amount 
these workers can contribute to catch 
up on their retirement savings as they 
near retirement, doubling it to $10,000 a 
year. Because we want Americans to 
save throughout their lifetime, to-
gether we increase the age at which re-
tirement plan distributions become 
mandatory to age 75 over time from 72 
today. 
These changes are especially impor-
tant because many workers find them-
selves making more at the end of their 
careers and are more open to focusing 
on retirement. Those already in retire-
ment often worry about the effects of 
mandatory taxable distributions on 
their long-term financial plans. 
Another recent study by Edward 
Jones and Morning Consult found 57 
percent of Americans who prioritize 
paying off a student loan are now be-
hind on their schedule on saving for re-
tirement. Our bill allows employers to 
essentially match their workers’ stu-
dent loan repayments with contribu-
tions to the workers’ retirement plan. 
This means from workers struggling 
to make ends meet under crushing stu-
dent debt and rising prices, they are 
able to tackle both, paying off their 
debt and getting help in working to-
ward a secure retirement. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairman NEAL and the members of 
the Ways and Means Committee from 
both parties for their long-term and 
diligent efforts. Together, we will en-
sure more hardworking Americans are 
confident in their retirement. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON), a real cham-
pion of retirement savings. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
NEAL and Ranking Member BRADY for 
their hard work on this important 
piece of legislation. 
The Securing a Strong Retirement 
Act of 2021 is bipartisan legislation 
that gives workers the tools they need 
to retire with the financial stability 
they deserve and worked so hard to ob-
tain. 
Importantly, this legislation allows 
individuals to pay down a student loan 
instead of contributing to a 401(k) plan 
while 
still 
receiving 
an 
employer 
match in their retirement plan. 
I have heard from thousands of indi-
viduals in my district who are facing 
an overwhelming amount of student 
loan debt. These are people who are 
struggling to start their careers while 
also trying to pay off their loans. The 
SECURE Act provides the opportunity 
to make payments on their student 
loans now while also investing in their 
future. 
I am proud to support this legislation 
that we are hearing today, and I thank 
you for this great bipartisan bill that 
you have put before us. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH), the Republican 
leader of the Trade Subcommittee. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I am glad we are finally con-
sidering SECURE 2.0, which will help 
every American family save. The Sav-
ers Credit improvements in this bill 
will help low-income families start 
putting aside money for the future, 
certainly a key to getting out of pov-
erty. 
The enhanced credit for small em-
ployers offering retirement plans will

help more businesses offer plans, an 
important factor in recruiting and re-
taining talent. 
New tools—like allowing employers 
to match workers’ student loan repay-
ments with retirement contributions— 
eliminate the need for young workers 
to choose between paying their debt or 
saving for retirement. 
Provisions like enhanced catch-up 
contributions and delaying required 
minimum distributions until age 75 
will help older workers have more con-
trol as they near retirement. This is a 
strong package for savers of all ages. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man and the ranking member for their 
efforts to get this to the floor and I 
certainly urge support. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. LARSON), a real champion 
of retirement savings, including all 
things Social Security. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman NEAL and 
Leader BRADY—what an outstanding 
example of bipartisan cooperation. But 
especially as it relates to what has 
amounted to a financial retirement cri-
sis, this clearly will help aid in the 
work that has already been done by 
Chairman NEAL with regard to both the 
SECURES Act and the Butch Lewis 
Act, but this even adds more flexibility 
and also provides an automatic oppor-
tunity for people to put money for-
ward. 
I went to the Aetna School of Insur-
ance and they said there are three legs 
on this table: personal savings, pen-
sion, and Social Security. This helps 
address the pension issue as no one 
can. Again, I want to commend Mr. 
NEAL and Mr. BRADY for their efforts, 
and point out that we have another leg 
on that stool that is called Social Se-
curity that Congress hasn’t addressed 
in more than 50 years. I commend the 
chairman as we go through the process 
of markup on that as well. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT). 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
it is neat to see us actually have some-
thing that we are all doing together. 
A bit of trivia, at the end of this dec-
ade, 22 percent of our population will 
be 65 or older. Retirement security is— 
besides just the moral imperative—it is 
going to be the financial, it is going to 
be the driver of almost all sovereign 
debt. 
Look, there are a couple dozen provi-
sions in this legislation, and in many 
ways they look like tinkering, but they 
come together. If you happen to have a 
profession where you have a mandatory 
retirement age that might be 60, 65, the 
ability to do catch-up—to be a small 
business and knowing what you can 
contribute to your 401(k) when you are 
doing your taxes instead of trying to 
guess at the end of the year—these 
things all come together. 
We are also going to have to look for-
ward in the coming year and deal with 
the reality of what did inflation do to 
the cost of future retirement? The tax-
ation on, really, gain, that isn’t pur-
chasing power, but is inflation. This is 
a terrific first step and it is neat to 
have us do something together. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. KIND), another real cham-
pion of retirement savings. 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of Securing a Strong 
Retirement Act, or SECURE 2.0, as it is 
being referred to. This falls on the 
heels of passage of the SECURE Act 
roughly 2 years ago, to try to make it 
easier for individuals to save for their 
retirement 
security, 
especially 
for 
small businesses to offer retirement 
savings plans for their employees, 
which has traditionally been a big 
black hole when it comes to individual 
savings. 
I am proud that a few of the provi-
sions in this legislation have been 
based on legislation I have been work-
ing on throughout the years with my 
friend and colleague from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLY). We offered legisla-
tion that would extend the startup tax 
credit to small employers that joined 
multiemployer plans. 
Again, with Mr. KELLY, this allows 
403(b) plans to participate in MEPS, in-
cluding pooled employer plans, or 
PEPS, as they are known under the 
SECURE Act. 
Finally, there has been an anomaly 
in the tax code that we are addressing 
in part trying to make it easier for S 
corporations to be able to convert to 
an ESOP model, or an employee share 
ownership plan. It is a very good busi-
ness model, but we are trying to bring 
that on par with C corporations. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. KIND. This has been a great bi-
partisan effort in committee. Again, I 
thank the chairman and the ranking 
member for creating the environment 
not just with today’s legislation, but 
the previous SECURE Act that we 
passed roughly 2 years ago, and the on-
going work that we will have. 
My friend from Arizona is right, with 
70 million baby boomers beginning 
their massive retirement, we have to 
figure out ways to make it easier for 
individuals to save for their own retire-
ment and for future generations to par-
ticipate and get a head start. I believe 
this legislation accomplishes that. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. LAHOOD). 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of SECURE 2.0. As a 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, I thank Chairman NEAL and 
Ranking Member BRADY for their bi-
partisan work on this legislation that 
will help workers save for retirement 
at all stages of their career and protect 
American futures. 
This bill includes two key provisions 
that I was proud to work on, Retire-
ment Parity for Student Loans Act and 
the Public Service Retirement Fair-
ness Act. 
The Retirement Parity for Student 
Loans Act allows workers to make stu-
dent loan payments while receiving 
employer matching contributions into 
their retirement plan. This will allow 
individuals to pay down student loan 
debt and save for retirement at the 
same time. 
The Public Service Retirement Fair-
ness Act creates parity between the 
public and private sectors, ensuring 
public-sector and nonprofit retirement- 
saving programs have the same access 
to low-cost investments as private sec-
tor retirement plans. 
SECURE 2.0 supports workers at all 
stages to save for retirement, helps 
small 
businesses 
create 
retirement 
plan options, and builds on bipartisan 
success of the SECURE Act passed last 
Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleagues that worked in a bipartisan 
effort for their work on this vital legis-
lation, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. CHU), another real cham-
pion of retirement savings. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2954, the Secur-
ing a Strong Retirement Act. This bill 
continues the work the Ways and 
Means Committee began 2 years ago 
with the SECURE Act to expand access 
to retirement savings and enhance re-
tirement readiness for millions of 
Americans across the country. 
I am especially proud of provisions 
drawn from my bill, the Encouraging 
Americans to Save Act, that strength-
ens the Saver’s Credit. This credit pro-
vides millions of low- and middle-in-
come taxpayers with an incentive to 
save for retirement each year. But cur-
rently it is split into three tiers of 10, 
20, or 50 percent. 
This legislation not only directs the 
IRS to promote the credit to more 
communities, including those with lim-
ited 
English 
proficiency, 
but 
also 
makes it both simpler and more gen-
erous by setting it at 50 percent for all 
eligible taxpayers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this bill. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. ESTES). 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in support of SECURE 2.0. Since 
my time as Kansas State Treasurer and 
a member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, increased retirement security 
for Americans of all ages has been a 
major policy priority for me. 
Building on our great success with 
the SECURE Act in 2019, SECURE 2.0 
includes a number of provisions for new 
employees and near-retirees, like my 
bill to improve the required minimum 
distribution rules, and my bill that

would make it easier for employees to 
save for retirement and pay off their 
student loans. 
Employers who are part of an em-
ployee stock ownership plan—like the 
Kansas workers I have talked to at In-
land Truck Parts, Conco, and others— 
benefit from the bipartisan ESOP pro-
visions in SECURE 2.0. 
The bill also ensures public-sector 
and 
nonprofit 
retirement 
programs 
have the same access to low-cost re-
tirements, just like for-profit retire-
ment plans. 
It allows individuals who have de-
cided to pay down a student loan in-
stead of contributing to a 401(k) to still 
receive an employee match for their re-
tirement plans. 
These commonsense retirement secu-
rity reforms deserve to be law, and I 
strongly encourage my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on SECURE 2.0.

Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. PANETTA), 
another real champion of Social Secu-
rity and retirement. 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 2954, the SE-
CURE 2.0. 
This 
bipartisan 
legislation 
would 
make it easier for something that has 
been getting harder and harder, saving 
for retirement for workers and working 
families. 
I commend the chairman and the 
ranking member for their very, very 
hard work, and I thank them for in-
cluding two of my bipartisan bills in 
SECURE 2.0. 
My Public Service Retirement Fair-
ness Act ensures that retirement sav-
ings programs for nonprofits and the 
public sector have the same access to 
low-cost investments as private-sector 
plans. 
This bill would greatly benefit many 
teachers and nonprofit employees who 
serve in my district and also have to 
spend an inordinate amount on housing 
by providing them access to affordable 
retirement plans. 
My Family Attribution Moderniza-
tion Act, which I worked on with my 
good friend, JODEY ARRINGTON, is also 
included in SECURE 2.0. 
This bill would modernize outdated 
family 
attribution 
rules 
so 
that 
women-owned 
businesses 
and 
other 
small businesses in community prop-
erty States, like California, have more 
flexibility and independence. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Mr. 
PANETTA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
these bills, along with many, many 
other provisions in this bipartisan leg-
islation, are commonsense solutions 
for the futures and the retirements of 
working families. That is why, Madam 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for SE-
CURE 2.0. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLY). 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I think we should mark this 
down, March 29, 2022, the day that the 
people who were elected and came to 
represent our folks back home actually 
got together and did something on the 
House floor that was good for every-
body in America. 
We are not firing bullets back and 
forth at each other. We are saying: Do 
you know what? Isn’t it great, when we 
work together, what we can get done. 
Mr. KIND and I were walking over to-
gether, and he said: MIKE, I am really 
happy this happened because there is a 
lot in there that we both worked on, 
and it looks like it is going to put a lit-
tle more gold in our retirees’ pockets 
when they hit their golden years. 
But this is one thing the press will 
never cover. They will never say: My 
God, these Republicans and Democrats 
got together for American workers to 
make sure that they go into retirement 
and lay their heads on pillows at night 
and sleep because they know they have 
enough to get through the rest of their 
lives. 
What a moment. What a moment. 
I have to tell you, I am so proud to be 
a part of this. I thank Mr. BRADY and 
Mr. NEAL. 
For both sides of the aisle, why don’t 
we use this as an example as we move 
forward as to what the heck we are 
supposed to do for the people who sent 
us here to represent them? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Kara Getz, from 
Chairman NEAL’s staff, and Payson 
Peabody, 
from 
Ranking 
Member 
BRADY’s staff, for working together on 
this. They get so little credit for all 
the midnight oil they burn to make 
sure that we can get legislation done. I 
thank them so much, not just for me 
but for all the retirees and future retir-
ees we have in this country. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, might I 
inquire of the ranking member how 
many more speakers he might have. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I have 
a few more. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
really proud to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MURPHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of SECURE Act 2.0. 
When our military members pledge a 
commitment to the United States, we 
promise, in return, to care for them 
and their families. As the proud Rep-
resentative of close to 90,000 veterans 
in North Carolina, I am committed to 
supporting strong legislation that im-
proves the lives of our veterans and 
their families. 
When servicemembers change base 
assignments, their spouses often relo-
cate with them, putting their own ca-
reers at stake and on hold. The SE-
CURE Act prioritizes military family 
retirements by providing a tax credit 
for small employers that make more 
benefit plans available for military 
spouses. 
Incentivizing job creators to hire and 
retain military spouses is an important 
step to strengthening military family 
retirement savings. 
I am proud of the bipartisan effort by 
the Ways and Means Committee to lead 
the charge to support our military 
families, who so often face many uphill 
challenges in attaining retirement se-
curity. We must always fight for those 
who have given us so much to keep our 
safety. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, first, I 
include in the RECORD a number of let-
ters and documents in support of SE-
CURE 2.0. 
Among a litany of letters advocating 
for swift passage, there are four I 
would like to include. These letters are 
led by the Employee-owned S Corpora-
tions of America, the American Bene-
fits Council, the American Retirement 
Association, and the Investment Com-
pany Institute, all of which were in-
valuable members in crafting this bi-
partisan legislation.

DEAR CHAIRMAN NEAL AND RANKING MEM-
BER BRADY: Employee-Owned S Corporations 
of America (‘‘ESCA’’) applauds your efforts 
to advance the bipartisan Securing a Strong 
Retirement Act. We are particularly sup-
portive of the inclusion of a key provision re-
flecting themes of legislation introduced by 
Committee members Ron Kind and Jason 
Smith to encourage the creation of more pri-
vate, employee-owned businesses. We thank 
you for recognizing the value of S corpora-
tion ESOPs to worker retirement savings, 
and for reflecting that recognition in your 
important legislation. 
ESCA is the national voice for employee- 
owned S corporations, and its exclusive mis-
sion is to preserve and promote employee- 
owned S corporations and the benefits pro-
vided to their employee-owners. Most S cor-
poration employee stock ownership plans (‘‘S 
ESOPS’’) are 100-percent owned by their em-
ployees. Our S ESOP companies engage in a 
broad spectrum of business activities rang-
ing from manufacturing to construction to 
playing critical supporting roles such as re-
tail grocery stores and other essential func-
tions to America’s infrastructure. 
As you know well, S corporation ESOPs 
were created 25 years ago with significant bi-
partisan support from Congress. Today S 
ESOPs accomplish exactly what Congress in-
tended: they create jobs, generate economic 
activity, and promote retirement savings.

Both specifically for S ESOP employees 
and more generally, your bill will increase 
retirement savings opportunities at a time 
when more than 30 percent of Americans do 
not have access to a workplace retirement 
plan and 20 percent of Americans have no re-
tirement savings at all. By contrast, we 
note, the vast majority of S ESOP companies 
offer their workers two retirement plans— 
typically the ESOP plus a 401(k). This focus 
on retirement security is a hallmark of em-
ployee-owned companies. 
A new study conducted by the National 
Center for Employee Ownership found that, 
heading into and during the pandemic, em-
ployees at S ESOP companies had greater 
job retention and retirement security, in-
cluding more than twice the average total 
retirement savings of Americans who work 
at non-ESOP companies. 
We appreciate you recognizing the value of 
having more S corporation ESOP companies 
and look forward to working with you to 
continue to identify more ways to enable 
more working Americans to be employee- 
owners. 
Thank you for your leadership. 
Sincerely, 
STEPHANIE SILVERMAN, 
President and CEO. 
DEAR PAIGE: I am writing on behalf of the 
American Benefits Council to express our 
support for bipartisan retirement security 
legislation that will soon be considered on 
the floor of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. This important legislation follows in 
the tradition of the Setting Every Commu-
nity Up for Retirement Enhancement (SE-
CURE) Act of 2019. 
The forthcoming ‘‘SECURE 2.0’’ bill re-
flects a thoroughness and thoughtfulness 
that provides enormous value to the Amer-
ican worker by expanding access to work-
place retirement plans and removing bar-
riers to financial well-being. We have re-
cently completed a study of the enormously 
beneficial impact of the past 25 years of bi-
partisan retirement legislation: 
Millions of Americans are facing short- 
term challenges that need critical attention. 
But it is also important to continue our 
work on enhancing retirement security be-
cause of the harmful effect of the pandemic 
on savings and retirement programs, which 
were facing challenges even before the pan-
demic. As we rebuild our economy, part of 
that effort needs to include even greater at-
tention to the role of retirement programs 
that have been jeopardized. We look forward 
to continued progress in the field of retire-
ment security and stand ready to assist in 
those efforts.

Re Letter of Support for the Securing a 
Strong Retirement Act of 2022. 
Hon. RICHARD NEAL, 
Chairman, Ways & Means Committee, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, Education & Labor Committee, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN BRADY,

Hon. VIRGINIA FOXX, 
Ranking Member, Education & Labor Com-
mittee, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NEAL, RANKING MEMBER 
BRADY, CHAIRMAN SCOTT, AND RANKING MEM-
BER FOXX: On behalf of the over 30,000 mem-
bers of the American Retirement Association 
(ARA), we hereby express our support for the 
Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022. 
We commend you for championing this im-
portant piece of bipartisan retirement legis-
lation. 
The ARA is the coordinating entity for its 
five underlying affiliate organizations rep-
resenting the full spectrum of America’s pri-
vate retirement system—the American Soci-
ety of Enrolled Actuaries (ASEA), the Amer-
ican Society of Pension Professionals and 
Actuaries (ASPPA), the National Associa-
tion of Plan Advisors (NAPA), the National 
Tax-Deferred Savings Association (NTSA), 
and the Plan Sponsor Council of America 
(PSCA). The ARA’s members include organi-
zations of all sizes and industries across the 
nation who sponsor and/or support retire-
ment saving plans and are dedicated to ex-
panding on the success of employer-spon-
sored plans. The ARA and its underlying af-
filiate organizations are diverse but united 
in their common dedication to the success of 
America’s private retirement system. 
The Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 
2022 (SSRA) builds upon the success of the 
Setting Every Community Up for Retire-
ment Enhancement (SECURE) Act to make 
it even easier for small businesses to adopt 
and maintain a workplace-based retirement 
savings plan. The SSRA further increases 
the small employer pension plan start-up 
credit to cover 100 percent of the cost to 
small employers to implement a 401(k) plan 
for the first three years. The SSRA creates 
an additional new credit to encourage small 
employers to make direct contributions to 
their 401(k) plan for their employees, offset-
ting up to $1,000 of these employer contribu-
tions for each participating employee. 
The SSRA contains several policy items 
championed by the American Retirement As-
sociation. The first item gives employers 
more time to adopt beneficial discretionary 
retirement plan amendments up until the 
due date of the employer’s tax return. This 
new deadline to adopt a beneficial discre-
tionary amendment is consistent with the 
deadline to adopt a new retirement plan that 
was provided for in the SECURE Act. This 
provision gives employers with existing re-
tirement plans the flexibility to make their 
401(k) plans more generous to rank and files 
workers after the end of the year. The second 
item corrects and modernizes the outdated 
and unfair family attribution rules to ensure 
women business owners are not penalized if 
they happen to have minor children or live 
in a community property state. A third item 
would broaden the scope of the SECURE 
Act’s pooled employer plan or open multiple 
employer plan provisions to allow unrelated 
public education and other non-profit em-
ployers to join a single 403(b) plan. 
The SSRA also creates a retirement plan 
matching program to encourage employees 
to pay off student loans. The latest version 
of this program addresses a problem that 
ARA identified about the impact this new re-
tirement plan design feature could have with 
the special test that applies to 401(k) plans 
called the average deferral percentage (ADP) 
test. Since that problem has been fixed in 
this bill, small businesses will now not have 
to worry that this benefit puts their retire-
ment plan testing at risk. 
While the SSRA has many good provisions, 
it is not perfect. The ARA remains concerned 
about the provision in the bill (Section 314) 
that would require at least one participant 
benefit statement be mailed in a paper for-
mat given the impact on the environment as 
well as plan and participant costs. ARA sup-
ports the provision that would direct the De-
partment of Labor, Treasury, and the Pen-
sion Benefit Guaranty Corporation to issue a 
report recommending ways to consolidate, 
simplify, standardize, and improve the var-
ious retirement plan disclosure require-
ments. The ARA will continue to work with 
Congress on ways to ensure retirement plan 
participants are effectively accessing the re-
quired disclosures. 
But on balance the Securing a Strong Re-
tirement Act of 2022 builds upon the success 
of the workplace-based retirement system 
and is yet another example of the extensive 
history of bipartisan legislating in this crit-
ical policy area. The ARA thanks Chairman 
Neal, Ranking Member Brady, Chairman 
Scott, and Ranking Member Foxx for your 
hard work and results to improve and en-
hance the retirement savings of the Amer-
ican workforce and would urge Congress to 
enact this bill into law.

partisan Securing a Strong Retirement Act 
of 2022 or SECURE Act 2.0, which would ex-
pand access to retirement savings plans and 
improve Americans’ ability to save. 
The ICI urges the House of Representatives 
to pass this landmark bipartisan bill as soon 
as possible and work with the Senate on a 
unified package of retirement-savings re-
forms. 
The ICI notes that the bill would: 
Allow savers to keep their retirement sav-
ings invested longer by increasing the age 
for required minimum distributions from re-
tirement accounts to 75 from 72; 
Ensure that workers get the same ‘‘bang 
for their buck’’ for their retirement saving 
efforts over time by indexing individual re-
tirement account (IRA) catch-up contribu-
tion limits to inflation; 
Broaden the ability of employers of various 
sizes, across different industries to band to-
gether in a new type of multiple-employer

retirement plan—called a ‘‘pooled employer 
plan’’ or ‘‘PEP’’—created by the original SE-
CURE Act; 
Streamline and clarify information retire-
ment savers receive concerning increasingly 
popular target date funds by allowing use of 
a single benchmark for the funds that more 
appropriately tracks its asset allocation; 
Allow employer matching contributions 
based on student loan payments; and 
Simplify and clarify more than a dozen re-
tirement plan rules. 
We hope that the legislation can be further 
improved by allowing 403(b) plans to invest 
in collective investment trusts. 
We wholeheartedly support these provi-
sions and believe your legislation is vitally 
important to the country and the financial 
well-being of millions of Americans. SE-
CURE Act 2.0 would strengthen our nation’s 
retirement-savings system by expanding cov-
erage, further increasing savings opportuni-
ties, and streamlining administrative rules. 
We look forward to seeing its enactment into 
law.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I re-

Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, we are

I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Actually, never make

they put in, along with Chairman 
NEAL’s folks, to develop this legisla-
tion, fine-tune the legislation, make

DEAR
CHAIRMEN
NEAL
AND
SCOTT
AND 
RANKING MEMBERS BRADY AND FOXX: On be-
half of the undersigned nonprofits, including 
charities and faith-based organizations, we 
want to express our strong support for the 
inclusion of the Legacy IRA Act in the bipar-
tisan Securing a Strong Retirement Act 
(H.R. 2954, section 310). The Legacy IRA Act 
was originally introduced as H.R. 2909 by 
Representatives Don Beyer (D–VA–08) and 
Mike Kelly (R–PA–16). 
We appreciate you placing a priority on 
families in America who are saving for re-
tirement and simplifying the retirement sys-
tem through the broader Securing a Strong 
Retirement Act. Specifically, the Legacy 
IRA provision will encourage more chari-
table giving by enabling seniors to make tax- 
free contributions from their traditional 
IRAs to charities through life-income plans. 
It is an important piece of broader efforts to 
increase charitable giving to enable non-
profits to continue to provide critical serv-
ices in local communities such as health re-
search and patient education, food assist-
ance, domestic violence services, childcare, 
youth homeless shelters, and cultural and 
arts programming. 
Many of our organizations are dependent 
on private philanthropy, including gift plan-
ning. We believe the Legacy IRA provision 
simply offers seniors another philanthropic 
option and would incentivize more giving to 
help charities while helping middle-income 
seniors who need a lifetime income. 
We strongly support the inclusion of the 
Legacy IRA Act in the Securing a Strong Re-
tirement Act and urge the House of Rep-
resentatives to approve this measure. Amer-
ica is stronger when everyone has the oppor-
tunity to give, to get involved, and to 
strengthen their communities.

Chair, Committee on Ways and Means, Wash-
ington, DC.

DEAR CHAIRS NEAL
AND SCOTT, RANKING 
MEMBERS BRADY AND FOXX: 
On behalf of our 38 million members and 
all older Americans nationwide, AARP ap-
preciates your leadership to improve retire-
ment savings opportunities via the Securing 
a Strong Retirement Act of 2022. While So-
cial Security continues to be the bedrock of 
retirement income for most American work-
ers and their families, individuals want and 
need additional retirement income sources. 
Your bipartisan legislation would make sev-
eral significant enhancements to current 
law. 
AARP strongly supports the provision in 
this bill that would provide an annual paper 
statement of benefits to ensure families 
know where they stand when saving for re-
tirement. As the U.S. increasingly relies on 
individual account-based retirement savings, 
workers and their families must timely un-
derstand, monitor, and manage their life-
time savings. Full and meaningful disclosure 
is critical to individual planning and pension 
law generally. As such, to be effective, Con-
gress needs to ensure all workers and plan 
participants will receive and can review im-
portant retirement plan documents in the 
form that most workers and families want. 
No document is more fundamental than an 
individual’s annual benefit statement. AARP 
also supports the optional delivery—and re-
tention—of important information electroni-
cally. 
The Securing a Strong Retirement Act 
also takes important steps towards improv-
ing worker access to retirement plans. Under 
this bill, more people who work part-time 
will be able to enroll in their employers’ re-
tirement savings plans by allowing them to 
save after only two (rather than three) years 
of employment. More than 27 million em-
ployees across the country work less than 
full-time. This provision will be especially 
helpful to the many older workers who can 
only find part-time work or need to work 
part-time due to caregiving responsibilities. 
In addition, employers with more than ten 
employees would be required to automati-
cally enroll workers in new retirement sav-
ings plans under this bill. This provision will 
help many employees benefit from auto-
matic savings tools. 
For workers who are struggling to save for 
retirement, the bill expands the current 
SAVERS tax credit to provide an enhanced 
matching contribution to millions of addi-
tional low- and moderate-income families. 
The matching contribution is both an incen-
tive for individuals to save for retirement 
while also providing additional retirement 
funds. 
Additionally, the creation of a national re-
tirement Lost and Found database will help 
workers locate retirement accounts they 
may have had with previous employers. This 
is increasingly important as more and more 
workers change jobs several times over the 
course of their careers. The legislation also 
establishes limitations and safeguards for re-
tirees who may have mistakenly received 
plan overpayments, including allowing a re-
tirement plan to forego recouping the over-
payment. Finally, we urge the retention of

the pretax option for catch-up contributions 
to help the 50+ save for retirement. 
We look forward to continuing to work 
with you to help every American adequately 
save for retirement in order to be inde-
pendent as they age. 
Sincerely, 
BILL SWEENEY, 
Senior Vice President, 
Government Affairs. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I think one of the things I am most 
proud of in this legislation began al-
most 2 years ago. After the passage of 
the SECURE Act, Chairman NEAL and I 
sat down on the floor talking about 
what more we could do to help people 
save for retirement. 
What we both talked about is what 
everyone knows exists, the savings gap, 
and what little is being done to address 
it. This is the gap of how many Ameri-
cans will spend their lifetime and save 
virtually nothing. When it is time to 
retire, their retirement isn’t in their 
hands. It is all owed to government or 
other help. 
We decided we would do the hard 
work to try to engage millions of 
Americans. We know who they are. 
They don’t make lots of money. It is 
low income or moderate income. They 
usually work for a very small business. 
They are the toughest to be able to 
begin getting into that savings envi-
ronment. 
We designed this bill to really focus 
on those who have not saved in the 
past and, unless we do something dif-
ferently, were not going to be saving 
for the future. 
That is why so much of this bill is de-
signed around them. That is why we 
help small businesses set up plans. 
Here is what we know, Madam 
Speaker. To have a secure retirement, 
we need to make sure a business offers 
a plan. 
Secondly, we need to make sure that 
worker is part of that plan. 
Thirdly, we need to have those con-
tributions matched. 
Fourthly, you need to save more over 
time as your income increases. 
This bill really takes significant 
steps to make sure small businesses are 
offering those plans and get help 
matching those first thousand dollars. 
We use the saver’s credit, which is 
pretty unused these days, and muscle 
it up, make it more available to help 
those with low income provide those 
first dollars. 
Then, we make the changes so it is 
easier for small businesses to either 
start their own plan or pool with oth-
ers, as we did in the SECURE Act, all 
of which we think are the elements to 
close that saver’s gap and give Ameri-
cans who really had no chance to save 
an opportunity to do that. 
That is what, in my view, is the im-
portance of this legislation, why I am 
proud of the work. 
Chairman NEAL and the Republican 
and Democrat members of our com-
mittee worked together beautifully on 
this bill. I think this is an important 
one that I urge the Senate to take up 
and pass as well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance 
of my time to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. ALLEN), and I ask unani-
mous consent that he may control the 
remainder of the time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Oftentimes in this Chamber, you will 
hear 
the 
phrase 
‘‘transformative.’’ 
Sometimes it is hyperbolic, but on this 
occasion, this is transformative legis-
lation. 
We have fundamentally changed the 
opportunities for retirement for the 
American family, for millions and mil-
lions of people. I want to acknowledge 
the work of the ranking member on 
this, Mr. BRADY, because his input has 
been invaluable in helping to get to 
this moment. 
We are proud of this work. We are 
helping Americans prepare for a secure 
retirement. The catch-up provisions 
alone are startling in this legislation. 
Remember, there are a lot of people 
in America who are trying to simulta-
neously educate their children and save 
for retirement. It is a real challenge. 
The catch-up provisions here mean 
that if people wish to work longer or 
begin to set aside more prescribed dol-
lars 
for 
retirement 
because 
they 
couldn’t do it during certain years of 
paying college expenses, we provide 
that opportunity. 
This has been meaningful for Mem-
bers on both sides. I have heard Mem-
bers on the Republican side point out 
their contributions to it, and they are 
entirely correct. 
We, on our side, have also included 
Mr. DAVIS’ legislation that ensures 
workers with student loans don’t miss 
out on 401(k) matching contributions. 
Representative MURPHY’s legislation to 
increase the required minimum dis-
tribution age to 75 is here as well. 
We created a higher catch-up con-
tribution amount for those years just 
before retirement, a provision particu-
larly important for pilots who have a 
mandatory retirement age. That was a 
priority of Representatives Sanchez 
and Pascrell. 
Mr. KIND’s bills have been included. 
His legislation fixing a problem with 
startup credits and multiple employer 
plans is here as well. 
SECURE 2.0 contains Representative 
CHU’s legislation that would enhance 
the saver’s credit, which was also a pri-
ority for Representative SEWELL. 
We have included Representative PA-
NETTA’s legislation that provides 403(b) 
custodial accounts that are permitted 
to invest in collective investment 
trusts, as well as his legislation re-
forming family attribution rules. 
We have included Representative SE-
WELL’s legislation to reduce by 1 year 
the period of service requirement for 
long-term part-time workers to par-
ticipate in 401(k) plans. This provision 
is particularly important for women 
who tend to work part-time more fre-
quently than men. 
Mr. SUOZZI
contributed legislation 
that would direct Treasury to issue 
regulations addressing a glitch with re-
spect to insurance-dedicated exchange- 
traded funds. 
Mr. BEYER’s legislation is included. 
That was important to the charitable 
community and would, among other 
things, index the inflation rate for an-
nual IRA charitable distribution lim-
its. 
The 
bill 
includes 
Representative 
MOORE’s legislation that would provide 
penalty-free withdrawals from retire-
ment plans for individuals in case of 
domestic abuse. 
We 
have 
included 
Representative 
EVANS’ legislation directing the Labor 
Department to update its disclosure 
rules 
to 
allow 
better 
comparisons 
amongst investments to aid partici-
pant decisionmaking. 
Finally, we have included Represent-
ative 
PASCRELL’s 
legislation 
that 
would allow first responders to exclude 
service-connected 
disability 
pension 
plans and payments from their gross 
income after they reach retirement 
age. That also touches upon Represent-
ative HIGGINS’ ESOP Fairness Act.

Mr. BRADY noted earlier, and let me 
reinforce, the exceptional work of the 
Ways and Means Committee staff on 
this occasion. As I have said many 
times before, we are blessed with 
amongst the brightest, smartest, and 
hardest working staff members in Con-
gress. Let me thank MaiLan Rodgers 
for her work and Kara Getz, who has 
been integral to the development of not 
only this legislation but also the SE-
CURE Act and the Butch Lewis Act, 
both of which became law. 
The SECURE Act was one of the 
most significant retirement opportuni-
ties, and this legislation will become 
law, I hope, in the near future. Let’s 
not wait another decade to enact the 
important provisions of this legisla-
tion. This bill goes a long way in ad-
dressing this country’s retirement cri-
sis. 
I want to point out something I said 
earlier. Half the people who get up and 
go to work every day in America are 
not in a qualified retirement plan. We 
need to continue to address that issue. 
This is important legislation. I know 
it will pass. I think the last time this 
legislation came to the floor, all but 
four Members of this Chamber voted 
for this legislation. 
I thank Mr. BRADY, again, for his 
good work and the good work of his 
staff. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance 
of my time to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT), and I ask unanimous 
consent that he be permitted to control 
the remainder of the time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3946 
March 29, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2954, the Securing a Strong Re-
tirement Act of 2022, which incor-
porates the bipartisan Retirement Im-
provement and Savings Enhancement 
Act, or RISE Act, that the Committee 
on Education and Labor approved by 
voice vote last fall. 
I thank the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. NEAL) for his hard work 
in incorporating this legislation into 
SECURE 2.0. Our committee was able 
to reach a bipartisan agreement on the 
RISE Act, thanks in large part to the 
leadership of the chairman and ranking 
member 
of 
our 
Subcommittee 
on 
Health, Employment, Labor, and Pen-
sions, the gentleman from California 
(Mr. DESAULNIER) and the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). I want to 
recognize them and thank them for 
their important contributions to this 
bill. 
American workers deserve a decent 
wage and the ability to retire with dig-
nity and security. Unfortunately, far 
too many Americans are working later 
in their lives and still relying on the 
next paycheck to cover monthly ex-
penses. This legislation makes mean-
ingful improvements to our retirement 
system, helping Americans prepare for 
and achieve the secure retirement that 
they deserve. 
I am particularly pleased that this 
bill incorporates several key priorities 
authorized by Committee on Education 
and Labor members. 
For example, it includes legislation 
sponsored by the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), the chair of the 
Subcommittee on Civil Rights and 
Human Services, which creates an on-
line retirement lost-and-found data-
base at the Department of Labor to 
help workers locate their hard-earned 
retirement savings as they move from 
job to job. According to the Govern-
ment Accountability Office, more than 
25 million people who changed jobs be-
tween 2004 and 2014 left behind one or 
more 
retirement 
accounts. 
Estab-
lishing this kind of database at the De-
partment of Labor is necessary and 
long overdue. 
The bill includes legislation spon-
sored by the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. MANNING) that reduces 
barriers preventing part-time workers 
from participating in their employer’s 
retirement savings plans. This simple 
change will benefit many part-time 
workers, particularly women. 
It also includes legislation sponsored 
by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. 
MRVAN) requiring the Department of 
Labor to review and update guidance 
from the mid-1990s regarding pension 
risk transfers. 
Importantly, Madam Speaker, this 
bill offers an opportunity to send a 
message to workers and retirees across 
the country that their retirement secu-
rity is a critical priority for every 
Member of this House. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2954, which includes the 
text of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee’s bipartisan Retirement Im-
provement and Savings Enhancement 
Act, the RISE Act, H.R. 5891, a bill that 
I was proud to cosponsor with the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Education 
and Labor Committee and Ranking 
Member FOXX. 
This bipartisan legislation is a much- 
needed push toward modernization that 
our country’s retirement system needs. 
Our economy has evolved and so have 
the ways Americans plan for retire-
ment. 
Neither employers nor employee ben-
efit plans fit into the same cookie-cut-
ter policies they did when the Em-
ployee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974 was first enacted. The RISE 
Act and H.R. 2954 include reforms that 
will benefit America’s workforce and 
job creators. 
Worker access to employer-sponsored 
retirement plans has improved over the 
last three decades, and participation 
has grown. Today, more workers are 
saving and saving more in employer- 
sponsored plans. 
However, there remains room for im-
provement, as too many Americans 
still lack access to these benefits. This 
legislation is a major step toward pro-
viding reasonable solutions to solve the 
problems hindering Americans from 
being able to save for a secure future. 
Building on the SECURE Act of 2019, 
the RISE Act and H.R. 2954 expand 
multiple and pooled employer plans, 
giving charities, educational institu-
tions, and nonprofit organizations the 
opportunity to offer affordable retire-
ment plans. Expanding pooled em-
ployer plans give small businesses ac-
cess to more affordable plans by allow-
ing them to band together, decreasing 
the costs and burdens associated with 
sponsoring a plan and providing more 
Americans with an opportunity to 
save. 
Allowing small businesses and non-
profits the opportunity to offer com-
petitive retirement plans so they can 
attract workers is extremely impor-
tant, as the labor shortage has hit 
them the hardest. 
Additionally, the RISE Act and H.R. 
2954 will allow employers to offer small 
financial incentives to employees for 
participating in a retirement plan. 
This will help encourage employees to 
start preparing for retirement earlier 
in their careers, which is vital for em-
ployee contributions to earn years of 
compounding benefits for their retire-
ment accounts. 
Finally, this bill expands access to 
retirement savings for part-time work-
ers who otherwise would be limited 
from participating in the employer 
plan. Removing barriers to saving en-
sures more Americans have a secure 
and self-sufficient retirement. Red tape 
and unnecessary barriers must not 
keep employees from building a strong 
retirement. 
The RISE Act and H.R. 2954 also ease 
the burden of administering retirement 
accounts by removing unnecessary dis-
closure requirements. The legislation 
directs the Department of Labor, De-
partment of the Treasury, and the Pen-
sion Benefit Guaranty Corporation to 
simplify reporting and disclosure regu-
lations, streamline the collection of 
contributions 
to 
pooled 
employer 
plans, and update benchmarking guide-
lines to accommodate a broader selec-
tion of plan investments. 
Importantly, 
retirement 
profes-
sionals themselves are in support of 
the RISE Act. Organizations like the 
American Benefits Council, the Insured 
Retirement Institute, the American 
Retirement 
Association, 
and 
the 
SPARK Institute are supportive of this 
legislation. 
Workers and plan sponsors alike can 
see that the RISE Act will make com-
monsense reforms and improve the 
lives and futures of the American 
worker. The RISE Act offers creative 
and practical solutions to the problems 
in our retirement system. 
As legislators, we must take action 
to tackle issues that affect the daily 
lives of our constituents. As a business-
man, I know firsthand the issues that 
are affecting American workers that 
can be improved upon. 
This legislation will improve the re-
tirement security for millions of Amer-
icans. I urge my colleagues to join in 
support, and I look forward to its pas-
sage in the House and for these reforms 
to be ultimately signed into law. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
MANNING), a distinguished member of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor. 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for yielding me 
this time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Securing a Strong Retire-
ment Act. 
Today, too many workers face dif-
ficulty saving for retirement. Even for 
those who have access to retirement 
plans, it can be difficult to grow and 
protect hard-earned savings. 
There are roughly 55 million Ameri-
cans who lack access to a retirement 
savings plan at work, with many lack-
ing any retirement savings at all. This 
is particularly true for women. Ap-
proximately 50 percent of women ages 
55 to 66 have no personal retirement 
savings, compared to 47 percent of men, 
and only 22 percent of women have 
$100,000 or more in savings, compared 
to 30 percent of men.

Women are also more likely than 
men to work in part-time jobs that 
don’t qualify for a retirement plan and 
are more likely than men to quit work, 
transfer jobs, or interrupt their careers 
to care for family members, resulting 
in lower retirement savings. 
This is why I am proud to have my 
bill, the Improving Part-Time Workers 
Access to Retirement Act, included in 
this important legislation. This provi-
sion will make it easier for long-term 
part-time workers to access retirement 
by shortening the amount of time they 
are required to work for their employer 
in order to participate in their 401(k) 
plan. This will have an important im-
pact on the ability of women and low- 
wage workers to be able to save for re-
tirement. 
As a member of the House Education 
and Labor Committee and a strong sup-
porter of college affordability, I am 
also pleased that this legislation will 
allow borrowers the option to pay down 
their student loans while still receiving 
an employer match in their retirement 
plan. This commonsense approach to 
retirement savings will help the nearly 
46 million Americans facing student 
loan debt become more financially sta-
ble while overcoming the barriers too 
many in our country face upon grad-
uating, like advancing in their career, 
buying a home, or starting a family. 
SECURE 2.0 will help workers save 
more longer, improve flexibility and 
protections for Americans’ retirement 
accounts, and eliminate some of the 
barriers small businesses face in pro-
viding comprehensive retirement op-
tions to their employees. 
These are bipartisan, commonsense 
provisions that will better serve work-
ers and employers across our country. I 
strongly urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of this critical legislation. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG), my good 
friend. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Securing a 
Strong Retirement Act. 
As an entire generation moves closer 
to retirement, we must ensure our laws 
are up to date to help Americans 
achieve their retirement goals. 
Last Congress, we passed the SE-
CURE Act, which made significant im-
provements to our Nation’s retirement 
policies. Today, we are building upon 
that success to ensure Americans can 
live their golden years with dignity. 
I would like to highlight one provi-
sion of this bill, which incorporates a 
bipartisan policy I have long cham-
pioned with my colleague, Representa-
tive SABLAN. Our provision will reduce 
the administrative costs for employers 
sponsoring retirement plans for their 
employees. 
Businesses often cite limited finan-
cial resources as a key reason for not 
offering retirement benefits. The Re-
tirement 
Plan 
Modernization 
Act 
would ease the administrative burdens 
on employers, especially small busi-
nesses, enabling more small businesses 
to offer retirement benefits and ensure 
employees are not needlessly paying 
higher fees. 
I thank both the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor and the Committee 
on Ways and Means for including text 
from our bill in H.R. 2954. 
Madam Speaker, the Securing a 
Strong Retirement Act will enhance 
opportunities for Americans to save for 
retirement. I urge all Members to sup-
port it. 
b 1700 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. MRVAN), a 
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for allowing me 
the time. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 2954, 
the Securing a Strong Retirement Act. 
I am grateful for the bipartisan col-
laboration to produce this legislation 
that makes commonsense improve-
ments to our Nation’s retirement sys-
tem. 
There are far too many challenges 
today that prevent workers from hav-
ing access to secure retirement bene-
fits and information to protect their 
hard-earned savings. 
I also appreciate the inclusion of the 
provisions of my legislation, the Pen-
sion Risk Transfer Accountability Act, 
which requires the Department of 
Labor to review existing rules on pen-
sion risk transfers. 
A promise made should be a promise 
kept for all workers and retirees. 
I encourage all my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation to further ensure 
that workers can retire with dignity, 
security, and peace of mind. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER), another good 
friend. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Georgia. I 
rise in support of the Securing a 
Strong Retirement Act. As part of the 
Education and Labor Committee, our 
goal is to provide employers and em-
ployees with opportunities to access a 
safe, effective, and productive work-
place. 
We also work on policy that encour-
ages people to save for retirement and 
provides opportunities for their fami-
lies. This bill accomplishes both by im-
proving employer-sponsored benefits to 
help workers make good decisions that 
will serve them well in the future. 
The bill increases access to retire-
ment accounts, lowers the cost of ad-
ministering programs for small busi-
nesses, and provides incentives for 
workers to voluntarily put money to-
wards savings. 
It also requires the Department of 
Labor to review existing reporting and 
disclosure requirements, making them 
easier to comply with and understand, 
updates the dollar threshold for auto-
matic distributions by plans to partici-
pants which was last updated in 1997. 
It streamlines the collection of con-
tributions to pooled employer plans 
and updates benchmarking guidelines 
to accommodate different investment 
products. The bill also adds tax incen-
tives for small businesses that offer 
employee stock ownership plans, a 
great tool and benefit for employees to 
have a stake with their employer. 
The Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 set a foundation 
for today’s policies, but the measure 
needs to be updated to reflect the 21st 
century workforce. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important measure and look forward to 
this legislation becoming law. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Oregon 
(Mr. 
BLU-
MENAUER), a distinguished member of 
the Committee on Ways and Means and 
chair of its Subcommittee on Trade. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the chairman’s courtesy 
for permitting me to speak on this 
issue and his leadership on an issue 
that concerns us all. 
We are facing a retirement crisis in 
this country. Too many people do not 
have adequate resources. The aging 
population is exploding, and we have 
seen financial uncertainty in the midst 
of the COVID crisis, in particular. 
I am pleased that we are able to come 
together as a Congress on a bipartisan 
basis to advance this legislation. 
Recently, we watched people come 
together dealing with trade relations 
with Russia, ratcheting up sanctions 
on a bipartisan basis, and this is an-
other strong signal, I think. 
I also appreciate Chairman NEAL for 
his leadership in spearheading the SE-
CURE 2.0 which takes the Oregon auto- 
enrollment model to the Federal level 
and provides new incentives to promote 
and expand employee stock ownership 
plans, ESOPs. 
I have long supported ESOPs as a 
successful model that provides a com-
pany’s workers with retirement sav-
ings through their investment in their 
employee stock. I have been stunned at 
the stories I have heard about people 
who have what one would think are 
unexceptional jobs who, through this 
mechanism, have been able to retire 
with significant savings as a result. 
Now, by giving employees skin in the 
game, the ESOP structure produces 
employees that are more likely to set 
aside money for retirement. They can 
retire earlier and worry less about re-
tirement income. 
The companies that use this mecha-
nism are fundamentally different. We 
have seen in times of economic strife, 
employee ESOP-owned companies are 
more generous with their employees. 
They are slower to lay people off, they 
bring them back, and, in fact, they are 
more profitable. 
It is an encouraging mechanism that 
I think epitomizes the best of the 
American ingenuity and the creation of 
wealth.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3948 
March 29, 2022 
This is a structure that works and 
one that is being expanded by this leg-
islation. By allowing for a deferral of 
gain on a small amount of the proceeds 
of sales of employer stock to an ESOP, 
there will be even more companies 
incented to sell stock to ESOPs, pro-
moting and expanding this innovative 
model. 
I am honored to support this legisla-
tion. I hope that we will be able to pro-
mote greater awareness and under-
standing of this powerful model. This is 
an important step forward. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), our great 
Republican leader. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Georgia for yielding 
me time. 
H.R. 2954 includes the text of the 
RISE Act, a bill that I am proud to 
lead with Chairman SCOTT of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee. 
This bill was born out of true bipar-
tisan collaboration, and I am pleased 
at the progress we have made with our 
colleagues across the aisle. 
Hardworking Americans deserve the 
opportunity to save for a secure future, 
yet too many workers aren’t putting 
anything towards their retirement nest 
egg. 
By removing the red tape tying up 
job creators and providing incentives 
for workers to save more, this legisla-
tion will strengthen and modernize 
America’s retirement system, so our 
Nation’s workers, retirees, and employ-
ers are better served. 
It truly is a much-needed step in the 
right direction. Practical solutions 
like the RISE Act and H.R. 2954 are a 
win for job creators, workers, and our 
Nation’s economic future. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to in-
quire if the distinguished chairman of 
the Education and Labor Committee 
would be willing to engage in a col-
loquy with me about the matter of fur-
nishing paper ERISA disclosures to 
participants and beneficiaries. 
I yield to the chairman. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I would be 
happy to enter into a colloquy with my 
colleague. 
Ms. FOXX. I thank the chairman. 
Madam Speaker, the underlying bill 
includes an imperfect provision requir-
ing retirement plans to provide a paper 
statement annually. 
The bill also directs the Department 
of Labor to revise its 2002 and 2020 safe 
harbor regulations to conform with 
this requirement. 
While I support the bill, I have seri-
ous concerns about this blunt provision 
which would undermine DOL’s 2002 and 
2020 e-delivery safe harbor regulations. 
Participants in plans have been relying 
on the 2002 safe harbor regulations for 
nearly 20 years. 
The Committee on Education and 
Labor has dedicated considerable time 
to this issue. I do not consider this a 
settled matter, and I will continue to 
engage with my House and Senate col-
leagues to find a workable solution 
that simplifies and modernizes the dis-
closure requirements for retirement 
plans. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Will the gen-
tlewoman yield? 
Ms. FOXX. I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the ranking member 
for yielding to me and for her com-
ments. 
It is my understanding that our 
staffs will continue their efforts, along 
with their Senate counterparts, to try 
to find a path forward on this issue 
that balances the interests of plan 
sponsors and the retirement plan par-
ticipants. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, reclaim-
ing my time, I thank the chairman for 
his willingness to continue working on 
this issue together. 
Again, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
bill. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), 
the chair of the Subcommittee on Civil 
Rights of the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT
for yielding, 
and I thank him for his leadership on 
this and so many important issues in 
the Education and Labor Committee. 
I rise in strong support of the Secur-
ing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022 or 
SECURE 2.0, which makes important 
and bipartisan improvements that will 
improve enrollment in and access to re-
tirement savings plans. 
As employers have shifted from pen-
sion plans to retirement plans such as 
401(k)’s, workers have increasingly be-
come responsible for tracking, man-
aging, and consolidating their retire-
ment accounts when they change jobs. 
There is no standard way for workers 
to consolidate their accounts, and 
many workers actually lose track of 
their hard-earned investments. 
According to a Government Account-
ability Office report, about 25 million 
people changed jobs between 2004 and 
2014 and left one or more retirement 
accounts behind. This problem is only 
expected to grow as young workers 
transition between jobs at greater 
rates than previous generations. 
The SECURE Act 2.0 includes provi-
sions from my Retirement Savings 
Lost and Found Act which will help ad-
dress the challenge of tracking retire-
ment savings. My bill creates a na-
tional lost-and-found registry for re-
tirement accounts housed at the De-
partment of Labor. 
The lost-and-found registry will pro-
vide workers with a centralized way to 
track their retirement accounts, and it 
will also help workers claim their 
hard-earned retirement funds regard-
less of how often they transition from 
job to job. 
I strongly support the commonsense 
improvements in the SECURE Act 2.0, 
including the creation of a retirement 
savings lost-and-found registry which 
will help working families retire with 
dignity. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote in 
favor of passage of this important leg-
islation. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, the goal of every 
American is to retire with security and 
dignity. The RISE Act and H.R. 2954 
will help workers do just that. This bill 
will expand the availability of private 
retirement programs to more Ameri-
cans. 
Neither small businesses, nor non- 
profits and educational institutions 
should be prohibited from accessing the 
benefits offered to larger retirement 
plans. 
Building on the success of the SE-
CURE Act of 2019, this legislation cuts 
red tape, streamlines reporting and dis-
closure 
requirements, 
and 
provides 
American workers retirement. 
I thank the chairman and our Repub-
lican leader for their commitment to 
bipartisanship and for defending the 
committee’s 
important 
jurisdiction 
over retirement issues in this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor 
of H.R. 2954, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
the time. 
Madam Speaker, as my colleagues 
have said, the bill makes meaningful 
and sensible improvements to Amer-
ica’s retirement system. It will help 
workers, retirees, and employers. 
I again congratulate my Education 
and Labor Committee colleagues who 
have authored provisions in this bill, 
and I want to recognize and thank the 
ranking member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor, Dr. Foxx, and her 
staff for their partnership and work on 
this important bill with my staff which 
includes Kevin McDermott, Richard 
Miller, Daniel Foster, and Eli Hovland 
who have worked hard on this bill from 
start to finish. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I strongly support the Securing a 
Strong Retirement Act because it will strength-
en the retirement coverage and savings of mil-
lions of Americans. I applaud the many provi-
sions included to expand retirement coverage 
and savings, such as automatic enrollment in 
the retirement plans, modernizing the Saver’s 
Credit, creating new incentives to small busi-
nesses to offer retirement plans, and increas-
ing charitable donations permitted through an 
IRA. 
I thank Chairman NEAL for including my bill, 
the Retirement Parity for Student Loans Act, 
that promotes increased retirement savings 
through an employer match for employees 
making student loan payments. By allowing 
employers to contribute an employer-match 
into a retirement plan based on an employee’s 
student loan payment, younger workers who 
currently cannot afford to save for their retire-
ment will begin saving much sooner.

March 29, 2022 
Although over three-quarters of Americans 
have access to an employment-based retire-
ment savings account, few Americans can 
make the maximum contribution of $19,500 to 
their retirement savings. Any contribution to 
retirement savings is particularly limited for 
millennials struggling with heavy student loan 
debt. The average student loan balance for 
2019 graduates was $32,731, and only 30 
percent of young workers use 401(k) pro-
grams to save for retirement. This policy is an 
important tool for employers to retain their 
workforce and for workers to improve retire-
ment savings and lower educational debt. 
I urge passage of this bill that does so much 
to expand retirement coverage and savings to 
improve workers’ long-term financial well- 
being. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, Ameri-
cans are living longer than ever before—about 
30 years longer, on average, than a century 
ago. To quote the founder of the Stanford 
Center on Longevity, ‘‘longevity is . . . among 
the greatest opportunities we have had in 
human history.’’ 
Those extra years mean more time spent 
with family and friends and enjoying retire-
ment. 
Unfortunately, while life expectancy in-
creases, Americans are falling behind on re-
tirement savings. 
More than 4 in 10 American adults have 
less than $25,000 saved for retirement. 
And the coronavirus pandemic has made it 
worse. According to a recent study, 1 in 5 
Americans said they are saving less for retire-
ment due to the pandemic’s impact on their fi-
nances. 
We need to act now to correct course to im-
prove retirement savings. 
The Securing a Strong Retirement Act is a 
comprehensive, bipartisan bill that eliminates 
many of the hurdles to workers enrolling in 
and remaining in retirement savings plans. 
As a former small business owner and as 
the current Chair of the Health, Employment, 
Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee, I have 
seen firsthand how reforms like the ones in 
this bill can help people live happier lives into 
their retirement. 
Importantly, this legislation incorporates the 
RISE Act, which I was proud to co-author with 
the Chairman of the full Committee Chairman 
SCOTT, Ranking Member FOXX, and the Rank-
ing member of my HELP Subcommittee Mr. 
ALLEN. Through that effort, we can: 
Help part-time workers join an employers’ 
retirement savings plan; 
Incentivize workers to participate in retire-
ment plans with small financial incentives; and 
Through the ‘‘Retirement Lost and Found’’ 
database at the Department of Labor help 
workers locate their hard-earned retirement 
savings as they move from job to job. 
I am proud to have played a part in this sig-
nificant and bipartisan effort, and will proudly 
vote in support of this legislation. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in support of the bipartisan Securing a 
Strong Retirement Act which includes the Leg-
acy IRA Act. This legislation, led by my col-
league MIKE KELLY and I, would encourage 
charitable giving by American seniors. Donat-
ing to charity is a hallmark of American soci-
ety. We are fortunate to have one of the most 
generous countries in the world. In spite of, or 
possibly because of, the upheavals in recent 
years, we have seen increases in American 
charitable giving to the highest levels in our 
history. 
We must do all we can to encourage this 
impulse, particularly among middle-income 
seniors who wish to continue giving post-re-
tirement. The Legacy IRA Act would enable 
seniors to make tax-free contributions from 
their traditional IRAs to charities through life- 
income plans. This bill is a win-win, for philan-
thropic seniors who want to continue giving, 
and for charitable organizations that benefit 
from donations. I would like to thank Chairman 
NEAL for his support in including this measure 
in the SECURE Act and Rep. KELLY for his 
partnership on this important legislation. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the Securing a Strong Retirement Act 
of 2022. Everyone can agree that the Amer-
ican Dream should be achievable for anyone 
willing to work hard. The American Dream is 
the ability for families to one day own a home, 
provide an education for their children, and re-
tire with dignity. The SECURE Act 2.0 does 
several things to help make retirement security 
easier for millions of hardworking Americans. I 
rise today not only in support of the bill, but to 
advocate for the inclusion of another bipar-
tisan bill, the ABLE Employment Flexibility Act, 
as SECURE 2.0 progresses through the legis-
lative process. 
Along with my colleague Mr. WENSTRUP, I 
introduced another practical solution that will 
allow more hardworking Americans the ability 
to participate in the labor force more fully by 
providing them access to benefits tailored to 
their needs. My bill permits employers to make 
tax-exempt contributions to ABLE (Achieving 
Better Life Experience) accounts in lieu of 
making contributions to existing tax-exempt 
defined contribution retirement plans. An 
ABLE account is established to pay expenses 
such as food, education, housing, transpor-
tation, employment training and support, and 
health care expenses of a designated bene-
ficiary who is disabled. In other words, it will 
allow millions of Americans with disabilities to 
receive, and their employers the ability to pro-
vide, similar tax-preferred benefits as their fel-
low employees. 
The ABLE Employment Flexibility Act would 
allow ABLE-eligible workers to permit an em-
ployer to make contributions to a 529A ac-
count in lieu of contributions to the employer’s 
defined contribution plan. The legislation is 
needed because, under current law, an em-
ployer that offers employees with a disability 
the choice to have employer contributions that 
would be made to the retirement plan instead 
contributed to a 529A account would jeop-
ardize the tax-qualified status of the retirement 
plan. 
Many defined contribution plans permit an 
eligible employee to defer compensation into 
that defined contribution plan, with the em-
ployer sponsoring the plan providing for a 
matching contribution on such deferrals. The 
plan may also have nonelective employer con-
tributions that are automatically made. Unfor-
tunately, assets in these plans could adversely 
impact the availability of means-tested bene-
fits. By eliminating this barrier, employers will 
be able to provide equitable opportunities to 
their employees to save for critical services 
while allowing them to retain critical govern-
ment support and services. 
Through the leadership of Chairman NEAL 
and Ranking Member BRADY, we are passing 
SECURE 2.0, a bill with overwhelming sup-
port. The bill has support from every stake-
holder, from advocates for seniors to the re-
tirement industry, and the practical solutions 
contained have garnered bipartisan support. 
Both things the American people are clam-
oring for in these hyper-partisan times. Like 
SECURE 2.0, the ABLE Employment Flexi-
bility Act has received support from an array 
of stakeholders from disability advocates to 
associations representing the retirement indus-
try. 
I want to thank the Chairman, Ranking 
Member, their staffs, and the Joint Committee 
on Taxation for their willingness to work with 
myself and Mr. WENSTRUP to address tech-
nical issues with the legislative text of the 
ABLE Employment Flexibility Act to achieve 
the underlying policy goal—help more Ameri-
cans save effectively and efficiently to live and 
retire in dignity. I look forward to our continued 
efforts and hope that we can resolve out-
standing issues as we advance the SECURE 
Act 2.0 to the President for his signature. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 2954, the Se-
curing a Strong Retirement Act, also known as 
SECURE 2.0. 
It is a sad reality that today too many hard-
working Americans enter retirement without 
enough savings. 
In fact, according to a recent report, only 36 
percent of working adults feel their retirement 
savings are on track to meet their goals and 
more than one-third of U.S. workers have 
never even had a retirement account. 
It’s clear that millions of Americans could 
face a financial crisis during their retirement 
years. Congress can help head off this avoid-
able emergency and give individuals, families, 
and businesses more tools to boost their re-
tirement nest eggs. 
Last year, the House Ways & Means Com-
mittee unanimously passed the bipartisan Se-
curing a Strong Retirement Act of 2021, legis-
lation providing new incentives to help improve 
the retirement financial landscape for Ameri-
cans across the country. 
This bipartisan retirement savings bill seeks 
to build on the momentum from legislation that 
passed last Congress. 
Specifically, this important new legislation 
would double the existing tax credit for busi-
nesses with 50 or fewer employees that start 
a company retirement plan, expand-auto-en-
rollment, push back the withdrawal retirement 
age, and allow workers to double their catch- 
up contributions. This bipartisan bill also au-
thorizes new protections for people paying 
down student loan debts and incentives to 
America’s veterans. 
SECURE 2.0 is also completely budget neu-
tral. 
Retirement doesn’t have to turn into another 
U.S. financial crisis. With responsible incen-
tives and smart planning, we can give more 
people the peace of mind they deserve as 
they grow older. I’m pleased to see Congress 
put aside partisan games and finally come to-
gether to enact SECURE 2.0 and strengthen 
America’s retirement security. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2954, the Securing 
a Strong Retirement Act of 2021, which will 
make various changes with respect to em-
ployer-sponsored retirement plans, including 
providing for the automatic enrollment of em-
ployees in certain plans and increasing the 
age at which participants are required to begin 
receiving mandatory distributions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3950 
March 29, 2022 
This legislation expands opportunities for 
Americans to increase their retirement sav-
ings, improves workers’ long-term financial 
wellbeing, and builds on the Setting Every 
Community Up for Retirement Enhancement 
(SECURE) Act of 2019. 
The purpose of this legislation is to expand 
automatic enrollment, simplify many retirement 
plan rules, and strengthen small businesses’ 
ability to offer workplace retirement plans. 
Among other things, H.R. 2954 would: 
Expand automatic enrollment of workers in 
employer-sponsored retirement saving plans. 
Employees would be automatically enrolled 
in plans such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s unless 
they opt out. 
The initial automatic enrollment amount is at 
least 3 percent but no more than 10 percent. 
And then each year that amount is increased 
by 1 percent until it reaches 10 percent. 
The age at which seniors must take re-
quired minimum distributions (RMDs) from 
their retirement savings accounts would be 
raised from 72 to 73. The bill subsequently 
would raise the age to 74 starting in 2029 and 
to 75 starting in 2032. 
Reduce the penalty for failure to take RMDs 
to 25 percent from 50 percent. If this failure is 
corrected in a timely manner, as defined by 
the bill, the penalty would be further reduced 
to 10 percent. 
Increase the limits on so-called catch-up 
contributions for employees ages 62 to 64. In 
2021, these workers were allowed to con-
tribute up to $6,500 to their retirement savings 
plans beyond the otherwise applicable limits. 
This bill would increase that amount to 
$10,000 and index it to inflation. 
The catch-up contribution limit for individual 
retirement accounts would be indexed to infla-
tion. Currently, savers ages 50 and up may 
contribute an additional $1,000 annually to 
their IRAs, but that limit isn’t indexed to infla-
tion. 
Allow employers to match a worker’s stu-
dent loan payment by making an equivalent 
contribution to that worker’s retirement savings 
plan. 
This provision is intended to help workers 
who can’t afford to save for retirement be-
cause of high student-loan debt, which causes 
them to miss out on their employers’ matching 
contributions to retirement savings plans. 
Today’s workplace is more generationally di-
verse than ever. 
Older employees are working longer, and 
millennials make up roughly a third of the 
American workforce. This bill helps both older 
and younger workers. 
For younger workers, this can help jump 
start the saving process earlier by making em-
ployer matches available for those who are 
also paying off student loans. 
For older workers nearing retirement, they 
would have more time to save, due to the in-
creased catch-up contribution limits and de-
layed required minimum distributions (RMD). 
By automatically enrolling every working 
person in a plan, with the option to opt out, we 
begin to solve the biggest reasons people 
don’t save for retirement. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 
three biggest reasons people do not save for 
retirement are: not having a plan at work (74 
percent of non-savers), being self-employed 
(14 percent) and not being included in a work-
place plan (12 percent). 
These proposed changes are beneficial to 
Americans of all ages, helping them reach 
their savings goals and provide more flexibility 
upon retirement. 
Though there are many paths to retirement, 
it’s critical to be financially prepared, espe-
cially as people are living longer. 
For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in voting for H.R. 2954 because we 
need to ensure that every American can ben-
efit from the best retirement plan for them. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the

hereby remove my name as cosponsor

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
ROSS). The gentleman’s request is ac-
cepted.

RECOGNIZING OHIO TUSKEGEE 
AIRMEN DAY 
(Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. 
BEATTY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today marks the first annual Ohio 
Tuskegee Airmen Day celebration at 
the National Veterans Memorial and 
Museum in my district. 
In March 1946, Tuskegee Airmen 
began to arrive at Lockbourne Army 
Airfield, today known as Rickenbacker 
Air National Guard Base in Columbus. 
The airmen were under the leadership 
of Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, the first 
Black officer to command an Air Force 
base in the continental United States. 
Their achievements during the war 
paved the way for full integration of 
the U.S. military, as pilots, navigators, 
and bombardiers. These brave, distin-
guished Black men received Purple 
Hearts, Silver Stars, and Bronze Stars. 
They were fighting for our country 
and for us during a time they were de-
nied access to the right to vote, hous-
ing in certain neighborhoods, and sepa-
rate but not equal educational opportu-
nities. 
Please join me in recognizing these 
heroic Black men. 
f 
PROTECTING AND EMPOWERING 
THE MODERN WORKER 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to highlight a bill I recently introduced 
with my good friend, Senator TIM 
SCOTT of South Carolina. 
The Employee Rights Act of 2022 up-
dates our labor policies to protect and 
empower the modern worker. 
Democrats continue to push their 
out-of-touch, Big Labor wish list in the 
PRO Act, which tilts the scale toward 
nonelected union leaders, tramples em-
ployee rights, and preempts State 
right-to-work laws. Meanwhile, Repub-
licans are focused on the worker of 
today and the future. 
The Employee Rights Act guarantees 
that employees will have secret ballot 
union elections, ensures control over 
the disclosure of their personal infor-
mation, keeps members’ dues from 
being used for political purposes with-
out their permission, and gives employ-
ees more flexibility to withdraw from a 
union if a majority of the employees 
agree. 
This bill also codifies the common 
law definition of ‘‘employee’’ to pro-
tect gig economy workers and other 
independent contractors and once and 
for all clarifies the definition of ‘‘joint 
employer’’ so that franchisees, entre-
preneurs, and anyone seeking flexible 
work options are not hamstrung into 
not running their own business. 
As a businessman, I have experienced 
firsthand the consequences of Big Gov-
ernment overregulation, and I am 
thankful for the support of dozens of 
proworker and probusiness groups that 
support the Employee Rights Act of 
2022. 
f 
TELLING THE AMERICAN COVID–19 
STORY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to applaud two legislative initia-
tives that passed this week. One in par-
ticular was the COVID–19 American 
History Project Act. 
With over almost a million Ameri-
cans who died from COVID–19, the his-
toric stories, the stories of tragedy and 
joy of the many hardworking medical 
professionals, like those in my par-
ticular congressional district, like Dr. 
Peter Hotez, who discovered an unbe-
lievable vaccine that is now being used 
in 
developing 
nations, 
Dr. 
Joseph 
Varon, Dr. Joe Gathe, and many, many 
others; hospitals far and wide; nurses 
and medical professionals, who had to 
take care of people who were lying in 
hospital hallways; and families who 
lost one and two and three and four. 
We must tell the COVID–19 story. 
It is an American story. We must tell 
of the heroes. We must tell of those we 
lost. We must say thank you. 
But one thing we must do, as the 
chair of the bipartisan COVID–19 Task 
Force, we must never, never repeat this 
again. We must be prepared, and we 
should be ready to save lives. There is 
nothing wrong with testing and vacci-
nating. 
f 
REMEMBERING JERRY MARSHALL 
GILL 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life of a valued member of the Savan-
nah community, Jerry Marshall Gill. 
Jerry was born in Bogalusa, Lou-
isiana, in 1931. He and his family moved 
to Savannah when he was at the young 
age of 5. 
Once in Savannah, Jerry attended 
Commercial High School, where he 
stood out immediately as a gifted bas-
ketball player. 
From Commercial High, Jerry pro-
ceeded to Armstrong Junior College be-
fore answering the call to join the 
United States Marine Corps. Jerry was 
called to Active Duty in 1950 and 
served in the Korean war. 
Back home, he was a volunteer for 
the Georgia Affiliates Federal Credit 
Unions for over 42 years, where he re-
ceived ‘‘Volunteer of the Year,’’ the 
‘‘Lifetime Achievement Award,’’ and 
the ‘‘Credit Union House Hall of Lead-
ers Award,’’ which is displayed here in 
D.C. in the D.C. Credit Union House. 
After retirement, Jerry worked with 
the Georgia Affiliates Credit Union for 
another 12 years. 
Jerry’s life of service was further 
demonstrated in his commitment to 
his fellow veterans. He volunteered 
with the USO and was a member of the 
Veterans Council League for many 
years. 
We will all dearly miss Jerry, his wis-
dom, and his service.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to praise a sensational basket-
ball team from my district. Saint 
Peter’s University is a small, excep-
tional school in Jersey City, New Jer-
sey. 
This year, Coach Shaheen Holloway’s 
Peacocks became the first 15th seed to 
reach the Elite Eight of the men’s 
NCAA basketball tournament. 
In the first round, the Peacocks 
shocked the world when they upset 
Kentucky, the number 2 seed and col-
lege basketball powerhouse. They did it 
again when they beat Murray State 
and Purdue to get to the Elite Eight. 
I was honored to watch the comeback 
victory over Purdue in the Sweet Six-
teen. I did it as a Congressman and 
proud parent of two Saint Peter’s grad-
uates, my sons, Donald III and Jack. 
Saint Peter’s University will be re-
membered as one of the most success-
ful teams in the NCAA tournament his-
tory, and I am extremely proud to have 
it in my district. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S FOREIGN 
POLICY BLUNDERS 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, once 
again, the President of the United 
States made a terrible foreign policy 
blunder when he embarrassingly said 
that Vladimir Putin cannot remain in 
power. 
Almost 
immediately, 
the 
White 
House communications team did every-
thing they could to save face and walk 
back the President’s remarks. Thank-
fully, the Secretary of State issued a 
statement clarifying the President’s 
comments, saying that the U.S. has no 
strategy of regime change in Russia. 
Unfortunately, it was too little, too 
late, as Moscow was quick to seize on 
the 
President’s 
gaffe 
to 
embolden 
Putin’s undeniably false message that 
Russia is the one under attack. 
Mistakes like these directly under-
mine Ukrainian efforts to protect their 
sovereignty and stall momentum for 
peace. President Biden’s actions have 
been misguided from the onset of this 
war. He has failed to deter Russia, and 
he was late to give Ukraine the mili-
tary assistance it so badly needed. 
The world expects clear and resolute 
leadership from the Oval Office. Unfor-
tunately, it doesn’t look like there is a 
chance of that anytime soon. 
f 
HONORING OHIO TUSKEGEE 
AIRMEN DAY 
(Mr. CAREY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CAREY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in honor of Ohio Tuskegee Airmen Day. 
Most know the Tuskegee Airmen as 
the first Black pilots in the military 
who overcame the headwinds of seg-
regation and racism to achieve unpar-
alleled success during World War II, 
flying nearly 1,600 missions and de-
stroying over 260 enemy aircraft. 
What you may not know is their suc-
cess continued after the war, both mili-
tarily and culturally, in Lockbourne, 
Ohio. 
In 1946, the Tuskegee Airmen arrived 
at the Lockbourne Army Air Force 
Base, where they operated the first and 
only Army Air Force base under the 
command of Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. 
Segregation 
continued 
to 
hinder 
their 
opportunities 
off 
base, 
but 
Lockbourne overcame and was lauded 
as the best managed base in the Air 
Force. Their work led President Harry 
Truman to issue an executive order in 
1948 that desegregated the military and 
mandated equal opportunity and treat-
ment. 
I am proud to represent an area of 
such historical significance and to 
honor the legacy of the Tuskegee Air-
men. 
f 
HOPE FOR PEACE IN UKRAINE 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to hope for peace in Ukraine. 
Estimates vary, but perhaps over 
20,000 people have died in this war al-
ready. 
Recently, both President Biden and 
Senator GRAHAM have weighed in on 
what they feel should happen to Vladi-
mir Putin. Obviously, their language 
could delay the end of the war and 
heighten tensions at the peace talks. 
Have they cleared their comments 
with the Ukrainian people, who lose 
more people every day the war goes on? 
Both President Biden and Senator 
GRAHAM got press from these remarks, 
and some politicians just care about 
that. 
I encourage all Senators and the 
President of the United States to re-
member that they are in the big 
leagues now, and their careless re-
marks to get a little bit more press can 
cost Ukrainian and Russian lives.

OFFICE OF THE SERGEANT AT ARMS,

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE HONOR-
ABLE DONALD EDWIN YOUNG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under

minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and submit extraneous 
materials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL). 
b 1845 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Louisiana for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to join 
my colleagues on this House floor and 
remember our good friend, the dedi-
cated dean of the House, Congressman 
Don Young, from the great State of 
Alaska. 
Don had a fire in him. He exuded joy 
in everything he did. And when he 
walked into a room, you knew he was 
there. 
Don was passionate in his desire to 
serve the people of Alaska, and for al-
most 50 years, he did just that. Don 
loved this House and chaired two of our 
key committees, Natural Resources 
and Transportation. 
As a freshman, yes, I, like, so many 
new members, sat mistakenly in his 
seat. The big bear growled me away. 
Once during a vote series, I voted 
‘‘no’’ on a Don Young bill building 
roads in Alaska and walked out of the 
Chamber. Three minutes later, the 
whip team is texting me. Representa-
tive ANN WAGNER is texting me: Don 
Young is screaming your name on the 
House floor. He wants to know why you 
voted ‘‘no’’. I went to dinner. 
The next morning, I found him and 
asked if he still needed me. He asked 
why I was a ‘‘no’’. I told him, and he 
smiled with that great big smile and 
asked if I could vote for his Alaskan 
fishing bill the next week. I said, yes, 
you bet, Mr. Chairman. You bet. 
I would like to extend my condo-
lences to Anne, his children, and all 
who loved him. Don was a great man 
who will not be forgotten. May his life 
of service be an example to us all. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from Louisiana.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3956 
March 29, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN). 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, there is so much I 
would like to say about my friend, Don 
Young. And some of you are probably 
wondering how could Don Young, the 
crusty, old conservative from Alaska 
be friends with a liberal Democrat from 
California like JARED HUFFMAN, an en-
vironmental radical. 
Well, it wasn’t because we agreed on 
Arctic drilling. It wasn’t because we 
agreed on the Endangered Species Act 
or so many other things. We fought 
about those things. 
In fact, I will always remember our 
colleague, MIKE LEVIN’s, first Natural 
Resource 
Committee 
hearing. 
Don 
Young was shaking his fist at me, say-
ing that he wanted to go out in the hall 
to settle our differences, and MIKE 
couldn’t believe it. And I told him that 
was nothing. That was tame by Don 
Young standards. You should have seen 
him last year. 
Don didn’t actually wink when he did 
these things, but he didn’t need to be-
cause we both knew that the next time 
I saw him, we would be laughing about 
it, having a glass of Chardonnay. 
Believe it or not, we did find some 
things to work on. We had a mutual 
love of fishing and salmon. We found 
lots of legislation to do together on 
those subjects. 
We both represent a lot of Indian 
country. 
We 
found 
common 
cause 
there. We worked together on national 
and international wildlife conserva-
tion. Now, he wanted to conserve wild-
life so he could kill it. I wanted to con-
serve it so I could admire it generally, 
but we found common cause, and we 
did a lot of good work together. 
I will always remember that when I 
met with Don in his office, I would be 
sure to bring a bottle of Chardonnay 
from my district because it was Anne’s 
favorite and because in the odd years, 
when Don was actually drinking, he 
liked it too. 
I am so glad that in addition to get-
ting to serve for almost 10 years with 
this legend of the House, I got to have 
a lot of fun with him. I got to play pad-
dle ball in the gym. I got to travel with 
him and Anne to Europe. I got to go 
fishing. 
In fact, I went to his fishing tour-
nament in Alaska last year. I was the 
only Democrat there. My reward was 
Don put me on his boat with Karl Rove, 
and I spent about 9 hours on the water 
with Don Young and Karl Rove. That is 
an experience I will never forget. And 
it too was an awful lot of fun, just like 
everything with Don Young. 
So with Don Young gone, I have no 
doubt there are going to be plenty of 
other people around here that I will 
find things to fight about with. It is 
the other part that I will miss, and I 
think the institution will miss. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend from Cali-
fornia. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend and neighbor across the 
Sabine River for having this special 
order honoring Representative Young. 
We are here to honor the dean of our 
House, Congressman Don Young. For 
nearly half a century, Don devoted his 
life to serving the people of Alaska and 
our Nation, starting his long career in 
Congress just 4 years after we landed 
an astronaut on the surface of the 
moon. A staggering thought. 
‘‘North to the Future’’ is the motto 
of our 49th State. It is meant to rep-
resent Alaska as the land of promise. 
Throughout 10 different administra-
tions, multiple wars and conflicts, na-
tional tragedies, the invention of the 
worldwide web, September the 11th, 
and much more, Don never stopped try-
ing to spread the motto of his home 
State to the rest of our Nation because 
he saw America as a land of promise. 
He understood the need to learn from 
our successes and our failures, adapt 
and push forward boldly, and bold he 
was. I will miss his fiery personality, 
his fearlessness, and his unique ability 
to get bills expedited if he concluded 
that they were taking too long. 
I share Don’s fierce love for Alaska 
and the great outdoors, and I routinely 
visited his great State to hunt and fish 
over many years. If you have seen 
Alaska’s 
breathtaking 
terrain 
and 
wildlife, you will never wonder why 
Don adored that State so much. He 
stood by his State through the thick 
and the thin. 
It was an honor to walk with him in 
these sacred Halls, to serve alongside 
of him in the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee, to hear the wis-
dom that he gleaned throughout his 
many years in Congress, and to call 
him my friend. 
God threw away the mold after he 
created Don Young. History will re-
member him fondly, as it very well 
should. Anne and his children are in 
my prayers. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER) that 
served on both the National Resources 
Committee and the House Transpor-
tation Committee with Congressman 
Young. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the dean of the 
House and my friend, Congressman Don 
Young. 
The great State of Alaska and the 
Eighth Congressional District of Min-
nesota, which I have the honor of rep-
resenting here in Congress, have many 
shared similarities and qualities. 
These are the values that Don and I 
shared to fight for our way of life, to 
promote the responsible use of our 
abundant natural resources, and to 
provide for our children and grand-
children infrastructure built to last. 
This made working alongside the 
dean such a pleasure and an honor. We 
served together on the Natural Re-
sources and Transportation Commit-
tees, and I will never forget the count-
less times he helped me out through 
the kindness of his heart. 
Since first being elected to office in 
1973, Don picked up a range of helpful 
tips, funny stories, and congressional 
experience that he was never shy about 
sharing. 
His wife, Anne, along with the rest of 
his family, are in my prayers. Don’s 
legacy of service will never be forgot-
ten, and he will always be remembered 
as a titan for the people of Alaska and 
our great Nation. May he rest in peace. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Louisiana for 
leading this tonight. I really appreciate 
it. 
There is so much that could be said 
about that. I think the really personal 
things about Don Young are what I 
would like to reflect around this place. 
When I first got here almost 10 years 
ago, we had kind of a common kinship 
in that we are both actually from 
northern California. He was born in a 
town near Meridian, California, not far 
from Yuba City, which is my back yard 
too, part of a rice farming outfit there. 
I knew his brother Doug from Wood-
land, part of Republican politics there. 
Both these guys are obviously char-
acters. 
So, for Don, though, you could tell he 
was just a pillar, just being around 
him. Of course, his portrait is on the 
wall in the committee room and such, 
his work on transportation, but it is 
the small things that really make a 
difference; his warmth, him and his 
wife Anne, for me and my staff that 
would be around him at various events 
going on around the district. 
We talk a lot about that chair over 
there, right. And so I sat in the chair, 
not because I didn’t know, because I 
did know, and I wanted to see what 
would happen. 
So I am sitting there, and he walks 
in. I got this thumb on my ear here. He 
grabbed it, and I said oh, I guess it is 
time for me to go. Sir, I am just warm-
ing the chair up because you are from 
Alaska. You need the chair warm for 
you. He bought that, but I got right 
out of there too. 
Now, just recently, I think it was last 
Wednesday, you know, he was in a 
wheelchair recently due to issues and 
such. And so we were heading to the el-
evator over here. And most of the time 
you might yield to that and let some-
body with that issue going on have the 
elevator to themselves. Not this group. 
Me and about four other guys, we all 
piled in there with him because we all 
wanted to be with Don Young, even 
just for a short elevator ride and see 
what he was going to say and what 
kind of things were going to go on. 
That is the man we all love and are 
going to miss terribly and whose sweet

wife, Anne, God bless you. It has just 
been a pleasure knowing and being 
with you here. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST). 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana for 
yielding. 
You know, a lot of people are saying 
a lot of things here about Don tonight 
as we are talking about his life and his 
service. 
Now, let’s put it in perspective. Many 
of the people in this House, whenever 
he first came in, many weren’t even 
born. In my case, I was in seventh 
grade, never knowing that I would 
meet somebody like Don Young. 
When I first came into this great as-
sembly, there was a gruff, noisy person 
that sat back in that chair that we 
have talked about all along, yelling 
about this and talking about that, and 
I just wondered who he was. 
After serving with him on the Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee, getting to know him, I realized 
that that gruff and that noise, let me 
explain something to you, has a heart 
that was bigger than the noise ever 
could be. The kindness that he didn’t 
want to show when you were around 
him for just a little bit, you under-
stood. 
But, also, what is so great is the 
amount of us that were able to tap into 
his knowledge of the institution, of the 
things that he has seen; ten Presidents, 
nine Speakers, someone said over 2,000 
Members that have come through that 
have served with Don Young. 
Anytime someone has been in a posi-
tion that long, the knowledge that 
they gain and the way that they can 
deliver for their district is amazing. 
This last week when we found out 
Don 
passed—unfortunately, 
in 
the 
world of social media, you put things 
out, and you put it out as positive as 
possible. But there was one person that 
responded in a statement, when I said 
he was there 50 years, well, that is why 
we should have term limits. 
Really? Don Young had term limits. 
Every 2 years. He went back to the peo-
ple of Alaska, and the people of Alaska 
spoke every 2 years. 
Why did they do that? They did that 
because they had a great Representa-
tive that knew and understood and 
loved the State that he represented. 
Now, think about this. He sat in this 
House when he could have moved on to 
the Senate. It was the same run. He 
could have been Governor, but he chose 
to stay in this House because he be-
lieved in this House and the job he was 
doing for the people of Alaska. He 
served them well. 
I was blessed by the fact that I got to 
go and participate in the fundraiser 
that his first wife had put together, 
and that is a fishing tournament that 
allows for that money to be given to 
the native children of Alaska that are 
in need. 
After that, he married Anne. And to 
Anne and the family, his first love was 
his family, and we thank them for giv-
ing him to us, not only the ones that 
serve here today but the ones that have 
served over the past 50 years, and to 
this Nation that will be forever grate-
ful for a man who stood up, told the 
truth, and used this institution to 
make this Nation better. 
b 1900 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. PALMER). 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
this evening with a heavy but grateful 
heart, heavy with the grief that comes 
from losing a friend but very grateful 
for having such a friend and colleague 
as Don Young. 
Congressman Don Young was truly 
an iconic figure in the history of the 
United States House of Representa-
tives. Serving the great State of Alas-
ka for three-quarters of its existence as 
a State, Don was determined to do all 
that he could for the people he both 
served and loved. 
One of my favorite memories of Don 
was at the beginning of my second 
term in our organizational meeting, 
and he was in disagreement with our 
Speaker. He said, ‘‘You may be the 
Speaker, but I am Don Young.’’ 
This House will not be the same. 
There may be Members who will sit in 
his chair, but there will never be an-
other that can take his place. There 
was and is only one Don Young. My 
colleagues and I extend our deepest 
sympathy to his family and his wife, 
Anne. We will all miss him. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, Don 
Young of Alaska was a fixture in this 
House. He was the kind of fixture that 
didn’t just look pretty, because that 
wasn’t his thing. He added immeas-
urably to everything else here. 
He and I have been on the Natural 
Resources Committee for years to-
gether, ever since I have been here. 
Since I ticked off Republican leaders 
over the years, I was not going to end 
up being the chairman, so I got to sit 
by him for years. That has been a real 
pleasure. 
He was a practical man and under-
stood the contribution that he was 
making, and it was truly a massive 
contribution to this country, to Alas-
ka, to the people of America. You 
never had to wonder where he stood, 
and I loved that about him. He didn’t 
pull punches. He told you what he 
thought, and he didn’t require a lot of 
words to do that. 
His laugh was contagious, but so was 
his love for America. He dedicated his 
life to making this a better place for 
all of us. He loved Alaska, he loved 
Alaskan people, and if someone tried to 
tell him that, gee, the Tribal folks in 
Alaska would be better off if you never 
drilled, he wouldn’t have any of it. He 
would get upset at that point, tell 
them they didn’t know. He had lived 
with those people, he had been there, 
he knew. 
Don Young was a survivor, and 
though we bid farewell to his remains 
today, his spirit will survive as long as 
there is a Capitol. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, Don Young was my friend. 
Years ago, before I entered Congress to 
serve my country at this level, as a po-
lice officer I was called upon to address 
the annual gathering of the Alaskan 
State Troopers. I will always remem-
ber, as our plane entered Alaska, the 
mountains rose from the Earth, and I 
had never witnessed such magnificent 
splendor of the Lord’s creation. It was 
awe inspiring. Frightening even. 
A couple of years later I met Don 
Young, and I understood more both 
about Alaska and creation and, by ex-
tension, I understood more about all 
children of God. 
Don Young, his spirit, his voice 
echoed through this Chamber, and 
every day that I sat next to him for 
over 5 years I recalled the Scripture 
that came to my mind when I felt and 
saw those magnificent mountains aris-
ing from the Earth. I recalled the 
Scripture advised us in Micah, said, 
‘‘Hear ye now the Lord saith; Arise, 
contend thou before the mountains, 
and let the hills hear thy voice.’’ This 
Chamber has echoed the voice of Don 
Young for five decades, and now he has 
gone to his reward. 
May I say to you, Don, you are the 
mountain of Alaska, you have been a 
dear and honored friend. You will be 
missed, loved, respected, and your 
memory shall always be honored. I am 
a better man, having known you. I 
thank my colleague, the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES), for lead-
ing this Special Order. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. I thank 
my friend from Louisiana for his heart-
felt message. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BAIRD). 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to pay tribute to my good friend, 
Representative Don Young. 
The House of Representatives has 
been home to many unique individuals 
throughout its history, perhaps none 
more memorable than my colleague 
and friend, Representative Don Young. 
His office walls are adorned with var-
ious mounted animals, and a 10-foot 
grizzly pelt, a homage to his favorite 
place, Alaska. For 49 years, Represent-
ative Young dutifully served his be-
loved Alaska, fiercely advocating for 
his home and the constituents he 
proudly served. 
When I first came to Congress, Don 
was among the first to welcome me and 
show me the ropes. This Chamber is far 
quieter without his boisterous laugh. It 
is dimmer without his smiling face. We 
will miss this unforgettable giant, and 
I will miss my friend. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. MAST).

March 29, 2022 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, dammit, 
I am going to miss my friend Don 
Young. My other close friend, Rep-
resentative HIGGINS and I, we sat next 
to him pretty much every single day 
for nearly the last 6 years, and I can 
tell everybody that for every story 
that you have heard about bears and 
bear traps and snowshoeing and dog 
sledding and Iditarods and eagles and 
hunting and everything else that you 
heard about him, there are a dozen sto-
ries that you have not heard but you 
wish you heard. They were that good. 
He was resilient. He was a mountain 
of a man, as you have heard from ev-
erybody. He was a fearless friend, and 
the only thing that he loved more than 
his country and his State of Alaska 
was his family and his wife, Anne, and 
that all encompassed just one of the 
most incredible men I have ever had 
the honor of knowing. 
My friend, Don Young, we are going 
to miss you, and may you rest in peace, 
my friend. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. I thank 
my friend from Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN), the ranking member of 
the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
it is my honor to stand in this Chamber 
tonight and to pay tribute to one of the 
longest serving and I think one of the 
most effective Members to ever stand 
in this Chamber. Don Young was not 
just the longest-serving Member, he 
was also a mentor and a friend; and he 
is someone who will be dearly missed. 
Outside of Don’s service as a legis-
lator, just sitting and talking with him 
and hearing the stories of his life, he 
told me one time about running a 100- 
mile trap line in the remote part of 
Alaska, and it was like I was speaking 
to some character out of a novel or out 
of an Outdoor Life magazine article. He 
seemed to have done everything. 
It is the stories that I think we are 
going to remember from Don. He 
passed very great legislation that had 
to do with everything from fisheries to 
the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. He was be-
hind that. But everybody who knew 
Don will remember the stories. We 
asked some of Don’s former staff mem-
bers if they could share stories, and I 
have got many pages, too many to 
read, just treasures here. 
I want to share one story from David 
Whaley, who was a staff member for 
Don. He says one of my favorite Don 
Young stories is about the original 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, then known as 
the Fisheries Conservation and Man-
agement Act, or FCMA. The legislation 
extended U.S. jurisdiction over fish-
eries out to 200 miles. Many people 
have heard the story about the House 
passing the bill first and doing all the 
heavy lifting, and then the Senators 
getting all the credit. But not many 
people know that both the State De-
partment and the Department of De-
fense were opposed to extending our ju-
risdiction out to 200 miles. 
In the old days, if the President was 
flying to a Member’s district, the Mem-
ber would often be offered a ride on Air 
Force One back to the district. After 
both the House and the Senate had 
passed the FCMA, President Ford was 
flying somewhere that required a re-
fueling stop in Anchorage, so Congress-
man Young was offered a ride. 
As it happened, the Secretary of 
State was also on board. After they 
took off, the President asked Congress-
man Young into his office on the plane 
and had the Congressman debate the 
merits of the legislation with the Sec-
retary of State. Congressman Young 
then got off the plane in Anchorage not 
knowing what the President was going 
to do. As we all know, the President 
signed the bill, and that is a story of 
how Don Young out-debated Henry Kis-
singer. 
What a remarkable career, what a re-
markable man. I got the privilege on 
my first trip to Alaska with Don to be 
on a fishing boat with him for the day, 
and the only thing I regret is that we 
didn’t have a video camera recording 
all the stories. Those are things that I 
will cherish about Don. 
But I want to share a personal story 
that Don shared with me out here on 
the House floor. A former member from 
Arkansas named Jay Dickey, who Don 
thought the world of, was always tell-
ing people about his friend Jesus, and 
after Jay died, Don just caught me on 
the floor and he said, ‘‘I want you to 
know something. Your predecessor told 
me about his friend Jesus,’’ and he 
said, ‘‘And I put my trust in him, and 
some day I am going to go see him.’’ I 
thought about the Scripture in Romans 
that says if you confess with your 
mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe 
in your heart that God raised him from 
the dead, you will be saved. That 
wasn’t the conversation I was expect-
ing to have with Don Young that day, 
but I am glad he had that conversation 
because I know some day I am going to 
see Don again. That is the way Don 
was. He told stories that gave encour-
agement, he told stories that were re-
assuring, and that was probably the 
most reassuring story that Don ever 
shared with me. 
We are going to miss him, but we can 
learn from his example. I again thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana for 
hosting this Special Order. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, it is an honor to yield to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the distinguished majority leader of 
the House. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my friend, the gentleman from 
Louisiana, GARRET GRAVES, for yield-
ing. I thank him for taking this Special 
Order for a special person. 
Now, I must say I am not going to 
have any funny stories about Don, al-
though funny stories there are. Nor can 
I say that I ever fished with Don, be-
cause I didn’t. Nor did I ever hunt with 
Don. I didn’t. But I served 41 years with 
Don Young, and I got to know him very 
well: As a friend, as a Member of this 
House, as a fellow American; and, yes, 
incidentally as a Republican and a 
Democrat because neither Don nor I 
proceeded in our relationship on the 
basis of our party affiliation but on the 
basis of common ideals, common objec-
tives, and common love for this coun-
try. 
b 1915 
I am honored to join my colleagues 
in paying tribute to my friend Don 
Young, who represented the State of 
Alaska in this House for 49 years. 
Don was one of three people who were 
senior to me in this House. There are 
two Republicans, Mr. SMITH and Mr. 
ROGERS, who I think both have the 
same seniority, so maybe they are co- 
deans of the House. But I am the senior 
Democrat in the House, and therefore, 
I had a long time to work with, to 
know, and to grow in respect for a 
crusty curmudgeon who could be as 
tough as nails but could also be as nice 
as you would hope a fellow colleague to 
be. 
As a matter of fact, I was here work-
ing as—I wasn’t an intern because I 
was getting paid. I was at Georgetown 
Law School working when Alaska be-
came a State. When Alaska and Hawaii 
became States, they became States to-
gether. The theory was that Alaska 
would be a Democrat State and Hawaii 
would be a Republican State. I use that 
analogy because who knows what we 
are going to be 10 years from now or 20 
years from now, so making decisions 
on a partisan basis probably is not 
what we ought to be doing. 
But Don loved Alaska, and as the 
junior Senator from Alaska said today 
at the memorial service held for Don as 
he lay in state, an honor few Ameri-
cans get—less than 50 Americans. Don 
Young got that honor. 
Many, of course, have commented on 
the sudden and unexpected nature of 
his passing. Surely, however, death had 
to take him by surprise because if he 
had seen death coming, death would 
not have stood a chance. 
Don Young was ferocious. He was fe-
rocious for his constituents, for whom 
he felt a sacred responsibility and de-
livered so much over his 25 terms in of-
fice. He said, ‘‘I will defend my State to 
the dying breath,’’ and that he did. 
When he was taken from us, Don was 
on his way home from legislative ses-
sion, headed back to meet with his con-
stituents and make sure they knew 
how he was fighting for them in Wash-
ington. 
Don was ferocious, but he also was 
gentle. Those who got to know him saw 
that behind that often-prickly facade 
was a tender and warm-hearted man 
who cared about his country and cared 
about his colleagues. He cared most of 
all about his family. 
The love he felt for his family, for his 
constituents, and for the institution 
was as enormous as the State he rep-
resented. 
I particularly was close to Don and 
fond of Don because he loved this insti-
tution. I love this institution. It is one

of the unique institutions of the world 
where the only way you can get here is 
for your neighbors to choose you. No-
body can appoint you. No Governor can 
appoint you. No President can appoint 
you. No majority here can appoint you. 
You come here because your neighbors 
respect you. And Don’s neighbors 25 
times over almost 50 years got the op-
portunity to say: DON YOUNG, we trust 
you, and we want you to go to Wash-
ington to represent us. 
There is only one Member of Con-
gress from Alaska. They have two Sen-
ators but only one Representative. 
What an honor for all of us to be se-
lected by our neighbors to represent 
and articulate their voice in the Halls 
of this Congress. 
I respected Don, and he respected me. 
On many occasions, we stood and 
worked together on behalf of this insti-
tution and on behalf of the Members of 
this institution. 
Don had a passion, as we all know, 
for decorum, known for tapping his 
cane and urging whoever sat in the 
chair to call the vote. ‘‘Regular order’’ 
would come from the seat at the back 
of the Chamber because he felt that the 
Chair was not bringing the vote to a 
close soon enough. And he was right. It 
didn’t mean that the Chair closed the 
vote because we were waiting for other 
people to come because they were 
late—but never Don Young. When the 
bell rang, Don Young answered the 
call. He never sat in the corner. He was 
always ready for the fight. He was al-
ways ready for the challenge. 
When votes were called, we weren’t 
always on the same side. That is what 
is written here. We were very rarely on 
the same side, but we were always on 
the same side when it came to Mem-
bers, this institution, and the Amer-
ican people. 
In fact, just because we were on oppo-
site sides, it did not mean that we were 
on opposite sides from a personal 
standpoint. I hope all of us could learn 
that lesson. We are all chosen by our 
neighbors, as I said, to be here. For 
that reason alone, we ought to respect 
one another. 
I don’t mean that everybody does 
things that ought to be respected all 
the time; they don’t. But it is impor-
tant to understand, particularly now as 
Putin is testing whether democracies 
can work. Xi, the leader of China, and 
Putin wrote a 5,000-page paper just 
about 6 weeks ago. Their premise was 
democracies cannot succeed because 
they cannot come together, and they 
cannot make decisions in a timely 
fashion. 
Don Young was somebody you could 
go to in a very collegial fashion, and if 
you disagreed, you disagreed with 
honor on each side. But if you agreed, 
you joined hands to accomplish the ob-
jectives of that agreement. 
I always knew that Don believed he 
was doing the best he could for those 
he served, and he spoke and voted with 
his convictions. Whenever, as I have 
just said, we found common ground and 
common cause, it was a pleasure work-
ing with him and knowing that I had 
alongside me someone so fiercely de-
voted to getting a job done on behalf of 
his people and on behalf of our country. 
It says here that now Don is at rest. 
The good Lord is saying, if that is rest, 
I am in real trouble because that guy is 
not stopping. He is still punching. He is 
still fighting. He is still yelling out 
‘‘regular order.’’ 
We are better for having known him 
and served with him. 
I join in offering his wife, Anne—who 
I hugged and gave a kiss to earlier 
today. I said how much I grieved his 
loss and shared her love for this ex-
traordinary man. His daughters will 
miss him. Their families will miss him. 
We will miss him. And this institution 
will miss him. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Maryland for his remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, Don Young served 
in this Chamber for nearly five dec-
ades, for nearly 50 years. Prior to that, 
he was a teacher, a trapper, a gold 
miner, a boat captain, a legislator—an 
incredible background for somebody to 
serve in this Chamber, such a diverse 
background and diverse experiences. 
I was in a meeting with him last year 
at the White House, and he stood up 
and said to President Biden: I need a 
picture with you. I have had a picture 
with nine other Presidents, and I need 
one with you. 
I mean, just think about that, with 
nine other Presidents that he worked 
with, that he served with. The history 
there is unbelievable. 
Everybody in this Chamber has a Don 
Young story. Everybody has an inter-
action that is incredibly memorable. 
One of them that I won’t forget is 
when we were at the White House and 
a bill was being signed into law that 
opened up the energy production in 
Alaska in an area—I think he told me 
he had been working on this for 30 
years. He was so excited about it, and 
he turned around, looks back, and says: 
What I lack in intelligence, I make up 
for in perseverance. 
Thirty years to get something done, 
but he wasn’t going to stop. 
There are so many stories about Don 
Young and that famous knife. That 
knife has been pulled out and involved 
in so many stories across that 50 years. 
I will bet that everybody in this Cham-
ber has a story about that knife. 
I believe there have been over 2,170 
Members of the House who served with 
Don Young, and I think that all of 
them have a story of the knife. 
I was standing in the back of the 
Cannon Caucus Room during a Con-
ference meeting where there was a 
heated discussion about changes in in-
direct spending, and Don Young took it 
to the back of the room with the then- 
Speaker of the House, John Boehner. 
Don is right up in Speaker Boehner’s 
face. I think that this is covered in 
Speaker Boehner’s book. He got right 
up in his face, and he is yelling at him. 
Don takes that knife out—and to be 
clear, it was not open—but he had that 
knife right at the Speaker’s neck. The 
Speaker’s security detail starts walk-
ing in, and Boehner looks at them, and 
he is like, no, he is harmless. 
There are so many stories, and they 
are all true—so many more. But I also 
want to say that while many people 
view this and believe this is the Don 
Young, the Don Young with the scowl 
that is portrayed in the media, I think 
this is the Don Young that so many of 
us actually know. 
Don Young would swear. He would 
scream. He would yell. He would have 
his growls and his scowl. But this is the 
Don Young that we knew. He was a 
grizzly bear on the outside, but Don 
Young was a teddy bear on the inside. 
I have been subjected to the yelling 
and the screaming and cursing and ev-
erything else, and I finally realized 
after years that I could just go to him 
and say, ‘‘Don, shut up,’’ and he would 
just make that face and start chuck-
ling, the biggest teddy bear of a man. 
There is a lot more to Don Young. 
This is Don Young and Congressman 
George Miller, who was the ranking 
member of the House Natural Re-
sources Committee. This was in the 
late nineties. 
Don Young actually enacted 123 
pieces of legislation, one of the most 
successful legislators to ever serve in 
this body. 
This picture was taken after years of 
negotiation among these folks. This is 
Congressman Chris John of Louisiana, 
as well as the famous Congressman 
John Dingell of Michigan and Con-
gressman Billy Tauzin of Louisiana. 
This was landmark conservation legis-
lation that these guys worked on. 
Don recognized the art of the deal. 
He recognized when you could actually 
get something done working together 
with other people. I will say it again, 
with 123 bills signed into law, Don was 
an amazing legislator. 
He was also tough as nails. Some-
thing that people don’t know, and I 
will go ahead and violate his HIPAA 
privacy here: Don Young was scheduled 
to have back surgery this week. He 
goes to the doctor, ‘‘I have been having 
back pain,’’ and folks will remember 
him walking around with a cane. He 
goes and gets a back X-ray and an MRI. 
He had a broken back. He had a broken 
back and was walking around, con-
tinuing to do his job fighting for the 
people of Alaska with a broken back. 
Don, I will say it again, was tough as 
nails. 
Madam Speaker, to the citizens of 
Alaska, I would like to tell you that 
Don Young absolutely bled for your 
State. He fought for it; he defended it; 
and he bled for the State of Alaska. I 
will tell you that I know this because 
I worked for him. I had the honor of 
working for Chairman Young on the 
Transportation Committee, and it was 
always Alaska first.

March 29, 2022 
There is a huge alumni class of hun-
dreds and hundreds of people. I would 
tease Don all the time that I was the 
only person that was able to overcome 
the stigma of Don Young and make 
something of myself. I said that in jest, 
I want to be clear to the hundreds of 
Don Young alumni who are out there 
that is a phenomenal group of people. 
Some people advocate for term limits 
in this body, and I agree. I think that 
term limits should happen. I think that 
some people when they are here for 2 
weeks it is pretty clear that they 
should be term-limited. 
But I will also tell you that Don 
Young, after nearly five decades fight-
ing 
for 
the 
State 
of 
Alaska, 
he 
shouldn’t have been subjected to term 
limits. He fought for that State every 
single day. 
b 1930 
On the Wednesday before his death, 
he and I stood right over on the side of 
this Chamber, he was in his wheelchair, 
and we had a conversation. He was 
talking about the House versus the 
Senate. He was talking about how in 
the Senate, his senators had to work 
together and figure it out. 
He talked about how, for Alaska, he 
was the people’s voice. He was the only 
one. He was the people’s voice. There 
was no delegation to fight with or ne-
gotiate with. It was Don—a State that 
is nearly one-fifth the size of the Conti-
nental United States; three times the 
State of Texas. Take that, Texas. 
Many people believe that the fact 
that Alaska has one Member of Con-
gress is because of a pesky little thing 
called the Census, or counting popu-
lation, or the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I submit to this 
body that the reason the State of Alas-
ka has just one Member is because all 
you needed was Don Young. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from the State of Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the 
House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
man GRAVES for arranging this special 
tribute to a devoted patriot, a serious 
legislator, and endearing colleague and 
friend, the dean of the House, Congress-
man Don Young. I thank Mr. GRAVES 
for his leadership in putting this to-
gether. I am pleased to join our distin-
guished Democratic leader, Mr. HOYER, 
who is still here on the floor now for 
this. 
Madam Speaker, this morning, Con-
gress had the sad and official honor of 
welcoming Congressman Young back to 
the Capitol to lie in state in Statuary 
Hall. As Speaker, it was my solemn 
privilege to join in paying tribute to 
this legendary leader, as his historic 
public service brought luster to the 
Congress and to the country. 
It was always clear that Don was pas-
sionate about his position and his pa-
triotism, and about working in this in-
stitution to make a difference. 
As an Army veteran, he was a force 
for ensuring our servicemembers, vet-
erans, and military families got the 
care they earned; 
As a former teacher and passionate 
advocate for quality education for all 
of our Nation’s children; and 
As a champion for Alaska—as Con-
gressman GRAVES pointed out, and Mr. 
HOYER as well—he was relentless in de-
livering investments to his beloved 
home State, especially lifting up Na-
tive communities in honor of his late 
wife, Lu. 
When Don became dean in December 
2017, he said right here on the House 
floor: I love this body. I believe in this 
body. My heart is in the House. 
He loved the House and the House 
loved him. Indeed, Don Young was an 
institution in the House of Representa-
tives. As was said this morning, 49 
years for the 49th State, The Last 
Frontier, which he loved; Alaska. 
While a committed conservative, he 
was more than willing to work across 
party lines if it meant delivering for 
his beloved home State of Alaska. And 
as dean, he cherished the duty to bring 
Members together and to defend the 
dignity and integrity of this institu-
tion. 
I, myself, was personally honored to 
be sworn in as Speaker two times by 
the distinguished dean, Don Young, in 
2019 and 2021. 
As dean, he cherished his duty to 
bring Members together, as I said. De-
spite political differences, many of us 
on the other side of the aisle enjoyed 
close personal friendships with him 
built on our shared reverence and re-
spect for this institution. 
His salmon dinners were legendary. 
His personality was similarly leg-
endary. 
While we are devastated by the loss 
of our dear friend and colleague, each 
of us has a duty to honor his unending 
love for the House and the towering 
legacy he leaves behind. 
Again, I call to attention the fact 
that George Miller, who served with 
him wrote—it is online in The Hill—an 
article he wrote with John Lawrence as 
opinion contributors. But George Mil-
ler and Don Young were back and 
forth, chair and ranking member, on 
the Interior Committee and the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources. You have 
to read it because any one sentence 
taken out of context, you might not 
appreciate, but let me just read what 
he said at the end: ‘‘Saying you miss 
Don Young doesn’t mean he was right 
all the time or that he was invariably 
wrong; it means the House is dimin-
ished by his loss. He was a great Con-
gressman and a great friend; Alaska 
was fortunate to have him.’’ 
May it be a comfort to his beloved 
wife, Anne, his dear children, Dawn and 
Joni, and his 20-some darling grand-
children that so many in the Congress 
and the country mourn their loss. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the statement of George Miller 
and John A. Lawrence. 
DON YOUNG: A CONSERVATIVE WHO BELIEVED 
IN THE HOUSE 
(By George Miller and John A. Lawrence) 
Don Young, the Alaska congressman who 
died on March 18 at 88 and who is lying in 
state today, was a hard-nosed, in-your-face, 
unapologetic, old-line conservative. An ar-
dent hunter and gun advocate, the walls of 
his legendary Rayburn building office looked 
like the workplace of an over-active taxi-
dermist: covered in heads, hides and horns of 
the creatures that had the misfortune to 
cross paths with this former teacher, trapper 
and river boat captain. A descendent of the 
early conservationist movement that pre-
served open lands and wildlife so he could 
drill and graze on the former and shoot the 
latter, he had no patience with public land 
purists who demanded minimal human intru-
sions on the natural ecosystem. It is fair to 
say he was much more Safari Club than Si-
erra Club. 
Don was not a subtle personality, as many 
discovered throughout his career. If he was 
unhappy with your criticisms or bored with 
your speechifying, he might pull out his 
hunting knife and hold it to your throat or 
jam it into the dais next to you at a hearing. 
The chief proponent of logging old forests 
and drilling the fragile coast, he was a hero 
to his Alaska constituents who sent him to 
Congress longer than any other sitting mem-
ber, but a desecrating exploiter of the 
public’s resources to environmentalists, es-
pecially those in the other 49 states. 
But if Don was a throwback to an earlier 
age of gruff, sharp-elbow politics, he also re-
tained that era’s deep love for the House in 
which he spent the bulk of his life, where he 
chaired two committees and served as 
Dean—and where it was not considered an 
act of treachery or political suicide to reach 
across the aisle. 
There is often a tendency when someone 
dies to sand off the hard edges and portray 
the recently departed as something of a 
saint. Don would be the first to acknowledge 
he was no saint, and he’d be furious with 
anyone who tried to sand off his rough edges. 
He would bellow like a wounded grizzly when 
he made concessions on the Tongass forest or 
the Alaska Lands law, but once the deal was 
struck in the negotiations, he would go out 
on the floor and defend the work product of 
his committee. 
Even so, Don remained a pariah to most 
national environmental activists for pro-
moting projects like the Trans-Alaska pipe-
line or drilling in the Arctic Wilderness 
(both issues on which we strongly disagreed 
with him), and many of his own colleagues 
were angry with him for pushing through the 
$400-million Gravina Island ‘‘bridge to no-
where’’ that became a paradigm of congres-
sional pork and provoked Congress to ban 
earmarks. But the people who worked on 
those projects and would have driven on that 
bridge (it was cancelled in 2005) were Don 
Young’s constituents, and he was doing what 
congresspeople have done since time imme-
morial: taking care of the district. And it’s 
worth noting that the House, after a decade 
of prohibition, has resurrected—with greater 
transparency—earmarks as a crucial way of 
securing the votes to pass legislation. 
Because he was very much his own man 
and did not suffer fools (or anyone else, for 
that matter) lightly, Don was skeptical of 
the 
new 
breed 
of 
hyper-partisans 
who 
emerged halfway through his long tenure in 
the House. Back in 1994, he was one of just a 
handful of Republicans who refused to em-
brace Newt Gingrich’s ‘‘Contract With Amer-
ica,’’ a collection of half-baked, rhetorical 
broadsides against the Democratic majority 
under which he had always served. Asked 
why he declined to embrace the campaign

document, he matter-of-factly declared, ‘‘Be-
cause it’s a crock of shit.’’ 
Later in the decade, Don unexpectedly 
joined with leading environmentalists to 
support the Conservation and Reinvestment 
Act (CARA) that offered up vast lands for 
both hunting and backpacking but also in-
cluded greater protections for landowners 
and restrained federal land acquisitions. 
Down at the White House, plying the bill’s 
key sponsors with Diet Cokes as they hap-
pily missed floor votes, Bill Clinton pro-
fessed his commitment to the bill to a dele-
gation that included Republicans like Young 
who had just voted to impeach him. When 
Young left the West Wing after a couple of 
hours, he marveled, ‘‘No president has spent 
that much time with me since Nixon’’ three 
decades earlier. 
Don helped build a stunning bipartisan co-
alition for CARA that passed the House with 
over 300 votes but stalled in the Senate. 
When asked why he could not get the bill 
past the upper house, he blamed ‘‘those 
crazy, 
god-damned 
right-wing 
bastards.’’ 
When he was reminded ‘‘Don, you’re a crazy 
right-wing bastard, you know,’’ he answered, 
‘‘That’s true, but I know how to cut a deal.’’ 
The House Don Young leaves behind is one 
where knowing how to cut a bipartisan deal 
is a much more difficult challenge than in 
his glory days, wielding the gavel at the Re-
sources and Transportation committees. His 
departure marks one more loss of the kind of 
people who were willing to take tough stands 
and live with the fallout, good or bad, be-
cause it was vastly better than gridlock and 
cheap shot sniping. 
Saying you’ll miss Don Young doesn’t 
mean he was right all the time or that he 
was invariably wrong; it means the House is 
diminished by his loss. He was a great con-
gressman and a great friend; Alaska was for-
tunate to have him. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, fre-
quently we will say at a service, ‘‘I 
mourn with you.’’ We are all mourning 
in the House with Anne, Dawn, and 
Joni because we have all lost a dear, 
dear friend, and we are praying for 
them at this sad time. He was a bless-
ing to our country. May Congressman 
Don Young forever rest in peace. 
When I asked George Miller this 
morning, what word would you use to 
describe Don Young. He said: He was 
amazing. He shouted over the phone: 
He was amazing. 
And how appropriate that the family 
had suggested ‘‘Amazing Grace’’ as the 
song to be sung at his service earlier 
today as he laid in state in Statuary 
Hall. 
Yes, Don Young. Amazing. ‘‘Amazing 
Grace.’’ 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I want to give tribute to 
Don’s wife Anne and to his daughters, 
Joni and Dawn, his sister, but his fam-
ily goes well beyond that. I have a 
number of statements from former 
alumni of the Don Young staffer world 
that submitted statements. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD several statements written by 
former staffers of Congressman Don 
Young: Michael Henry, Pamela Day, 
C.J. 
Zane, 
Sherrie 
Slick, 
Duncan 
Smith, Zack Brown, Jerry Hood, Jim 
Coon, Sophia Varnasidis, Lisa Pittman, 
Colin Chapman, Holly Lyons, David 
Schaffer, Jason Suslavich.

STAFFER TO DEAN DONALD EDWIN YOUNG (R– 
AK)—PERSONAL OFFICE 
(June 1996–November 1997) 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON RESOURCES 
(November 1997–January 2000) 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(January 20001–November 2002) 
Since the world lost the Dean of the House 
of Representatives, Congressman for all 
Alaska, husband to Anne, father to Joni and 
Dawn, friend and mentor, Don Young, I have 
been asked several times to share a story or 
memory. How do you sum up a person so 
impactful to your life, such a big personality 
and titan legislator? I have been frozen, un-
able to share much to encapsulate the man 
so important to so many, including my fam-
ily. 
What keeps returning to my mind is the di-
chotomy of Don Young. He was both gruff 
and held as large a heart as anyone I have 
ever met. He was strategic in what he did 
and said and will be remembered for what ap-
peared as gaffs. He lived without bias and 
will be remembered for straight forward 
opinions. And he lived every day on his own 
terms and was one of the most selfless people 
I have ever met. Which is why no one version 
of Don Young could ever sum the totality of 
his complex personality. 
While our society is unlikely to allow an-
other trapper turned tugboat captain turn 
into a prolific legislator, we should cherish 
the brash honesty that accompanied his sin-
cere caring and steadfast loyalty. While like 
all of us, I’m sure he would choose to handle 
many situations differently with the benefit 
of hindsight, I’m not sure he held any re-
grets. And for those who disliked, Don Young 
for the caricature he was made into, I will 
say it is that emotion which has fueled the 
love the rest of us hold for the Dean of the 
North. Nobody likes to be disliked, but that 
energy became part of his lore and so many 
fiercely loyal to him. 
One thing that wasn’t complicated about 
Don Young was his proficiency as a legis-
lator. The numbers simply do not lie. And, 
with his passing, we owe him the reflection 
of what he truly was—one of the greatest 
legislators our country will ever know. Don 
Young was the original sponsor of 123 bills 
signed into Law by 10 Presidents—8 more 
bills signed into law than the ‘‘Lion of the 
Senate’’, Ted Kennedy advanced during his 
similar time in the Congress. And while that 
statistic makes clear his importance to the 
legislative branch of government, it was one 
I don’t recall him ever boasting about. 
Don Young was far prouder of his service 
to the people’s body, the House of Represent-
atives. Which spanned nearly 50 years. He 
routinely spoke about the 10 Presidents he 
worked with and the 2,178 Members of the 
House of Representatives he served with. It 
was the people and the relationships that 
mattered to him, not how many votes he 
made (or missed), getting the better of an op-
ponent at a hearing or the deference that 
was paid to him everywhere he went. He ap-
preciated a good deal and a real connection 
to the people involved. He loved his col-
leagues and everyone he met with. These 
were the people, as he liked to reflect, who 
taught him something new every day. And 
that’s what kept him in Congress for so 
long—new issues that accompany each Con-
gress and the recalibration that comes with 
an ever-evolving body. 
As I try to bring a story to close my reflec-
tion on Congressman Don Young, my Chair-
man on two full Committees, House Com-
mittee on Resources and Transportation and 
Infrastructure, I am drawn to the fact that 
one of the greatest negotiations of his career 
occurred during the time I worked for him. 
It was a negotiation that had him to work-
ing, and often arguing, with Republicans as 
forcefully as Democrats. And ably navi-
gating the Senate as well as a formidable 
President Bill Clinton. At one point, his du-
tiful staffer (me) added in a relatively junior 
Congressman Richard Pombo (R–CA) to a 
high-level negotiation. Some of us were con-
cerned that Chairman Young needed a con-
servative backstop so as not to give too 
much to the Democrats as we pursued a deal. 
The result was his getting his way with all 
the various factions and the crafting the 
most significant conservation legislation of 
the time. Unfortunately, this bill was not 
one of the 123 Don Young sponsored that be-
came law, but nonetheless, one of his great-
est legislative achievements. Even though 
the Conservation and Reinvestment Act 
(CARA) was controversial on the left and 
right, he won a vote of 315 in the House. That 
is legislating and that is what Don Young did 
best. 
The speed in how fast legislators are for-
gotten is off putting, but Don Young’s legacy 
is secure. He was the best boss hundreds of 
staff could have dreamed to have. He empow-
ered us to be creative. He was mostly sup-
portive, even after a blunder. He always took 
the time to help us get better and never be-
grudged any the opportunity to grow outside 
his office with a career move. He spent every 
day with a servant’s heart. He worked to 
make the institution of Congress better and 
came to work each day seeking opportunities 
for Alaskans. We are all a less with his loss. 
PAMELA DAY 
TEAM DY 
(2003–2020) 
CHIEF OF STAFF 
(2009–2020) 
When I was hired by Congressman Don 
Young back in 2003, I had no idea that I 
would call him ‘‘Boss’’ for the next 17 years. 
I also didn’t know that when you joined 
‘‘Team DY,’’ you instantly inherited dozens, 
if not hundreds, of new family members. Be-
cause when you worked for Congressman 
Young, you were indeed treated like family, 
and even after you left the office and moved 
on to your next job opportunity, you never 
truly left. The Don Young alumni network is 
vast and full of great people who have gone 
on to do impressive things, but we all know 
that we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude 
to Congressman Young for taking a chance 
on us and giving us the opportunity of our 
lives to do something important—work with 
him and represent Alaskans. 
I was his only female Chief of Staff and the 
longest to serve in that position, 12 years. 
When I would tell people who didn’t know 
him that I was his Chief, they would look at 
me and wonder how I could stay in that posi-
tion for so long. It was a tough job, but the 
truth is, he was a great boss. He was loyal to 
a fault. He trusted staff to do the jobs they 
were hired to do. He believed that he always 
had the best staff on the Hill and was always 
gracious when one of us would tell him it 
was time to move on. He never held anyone 
back and was genuinely happy for staffers 
who left because he knew that we would al-
ways be there for him. And in the days since 
his passing, that is exactly what has hap-
pened. We’ve all been there for each other. 
Once a DY staffer, always a DY staffer. 
The Congressman had wonderful press staff 
over the years, but he was his own best pub-
lic relations department. There has been 
much written about his gruff exterior and, at 
times, cantankerous demeanor, but if you 
actually had the chance to meet him in per-
son then you know that wasn’t who he truly

was. I can’t count the number of times con-
stituents who had never met him came to DC 
for a meeting, nervous about sitting across 
from this giant personality and asking for 
his help. If you were an Alaskan in DC, you 
met with him; he always made time for 
them. They would be taken aback when he 
jovially swung open his door and bellowed, 
‘‘Who do we have here?’’ followed by a big 
smile, handshake, and photo opportunity in 
front of the giant Alaska map. During meet-
ings, he would share stories, compare notes 
about who was related to who and if he knew 
their relatives (most times he did), and then 
turn the floor over to them to make their 
presentation. He loved learning something 
new every day. He listened intently and 
asked thoughtful questions before signing 
copies of that picture that was taken just 
moments before and thanking them for cor-
ning in to see him. But my favorite memory 
of working for him is what would happen 
after the meeting. Almost inevitably, as 
they left the office and headed down the hall, 
someone would say, ‘‘wow—he’s so different 
in real life!’’ 
Alaskans will vote to send someone new to 
Washington to represent them, but no one 
will ever replace Congressman Young. He 
was one of a kind in every way possible. 
I want Alaskans to know that he loved 
Alaska. He loved fighting for Alaska. And he 
never forgot what a truly awesome gift and 
responsibility it was to be the Congressman 
for All Alaska. 
C.J. ZANE 
DY CHIEF OF STAFF 
(1980–1992) 
FORMER STATE STAFFER 
Many people who know and love Don 
Young know that he was obsessively ‘‘on 
time’’ for meetings and following the ‘‘sched-
ule’’ whether in DC or traveling around Alas-
ka. I was once traveling in Alaska with Mr. 
Young and his wife Lu as we did a series of 
stops in remote communities via small air-
craft (flown by long-time Young friend Paul 
Hagland), which is the way a lot of Alaskans 
get from place to place. We were on a tight 
schedule and Don was getting really impa-
tient because Lu and are were not plane-side 
ready to go. We were each using the rest-
room in a small building near the runway. 
When we emerged and approached the plane 
Don growled about our being late. Lu said 
forcefully (as she could do), ‘‘Damn it Young, 
you just relax, we Have To Have Time To 
Take Care Of Our Bodily Functions!!’’ Need-
less to say, Mr. Young knew when he was 
bested in an argument and needless to say 
the rest of community visits went well and 
we’re more or less on time, but everyone had 
time to go to the bathroom and there were 
no ‘‘accidents’’ on the plane. Even Don’s 
vaunted punctuality had to yield to the re-
ality of the situation and to the strength of 
his beloved wife Lu.

SENATORS STEVENS, FRANK MURKOWSKI, LISA 
MURKOWSKI, AND CONGRESSMAN YOUNG 
C.J. Zane and Congressman Don Young 
interviewed me and with the support of Sen-
ator Ted Stevens and Senator Frank Mur-
kowski, hired me in 1987 to work in the 
Ketchikan 
Congressional 
Office. 
Subse-
quently working for Senator Lisa Mur-
kowski. I retired after 25 years of service to 
the delegation. Congressional Record Vol-
ume 158 (2012) Part 7. 
I have forgotten exactly what bill Con-
gressman Young was addressing in Congress 
which had to do with the fishing in Alaska, 
but as he encouraged his vote, it was being 
televised and I had it on TV in the office. All 
of a sudden Congressman Young pounded 
loudly with his palm on the podium and 
raised his voice with some strong language 
to emphasis the importance of support for 
this bill which would support our fishing in-
dustry and the economy of Alaska. 
Immediately my 2 phone lines began to 
light up in the office. Calls from people who 
had been watching the proceedings: 
The first call I caught was an elderly lady. 
In a very soft and polite voice she asked me 
to thank Mr. Young for his work for Alaska 
but please convey to the Congressman her 
wishes that he return his manner of little 
more decorum in his passion introducing his 
bills. The second call was from a gruff, deep, 
loud voice: ‘‘I just watched Congressman 
Young fighting for fishermen and the indus-
try . . . . thank him and tell him to continue 
to give them ‘‘hell’’ and keep up his passion 
in the good fight for the people and success 
Alaska.’’ 
Illustrating that Congressman Don Young 
could be could brash and boisterous or gentle 
and kind . . . . but he was recognized as al-
ways being a strong, dependable ambassador 
for Alaska. 
DUNCAN SMITH 
TEAM DY 
(10 years) 
I was one of the few lawyers Congressman 
Young ever hired. I was his committee coun-
sel on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries 
Committee when he was Ranking Member on 
the Coast Guard Subcommittee. We had a 
good laugh when he received a Doctor of 
Laws degree from the University of Alaska. 
It was my pleasure to serve with him. May 
he rest in peace. 
ZACK BROWN 
DY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR 
(2019–2022) 
In the days since his passing, we have 
rightfully celebrated Congressman Young’s 
incredible accomplishments and recalled his 
larger-than-life 
personality. 
Specifically, 
much has been said about the gruff demeanor 
he was known for in the press. I came on to 
run Congressman Young’s press operations 
over three years ago. Back then, all I knew 
about the Congressman was his reputation 
for being cantankerous and eccentric. Ad-
mittedly, he himself was responsible for 
some parts of this reputation, but the full 
picture has never been understood. 
Here is the truth: Don Young did indeed 
run hot, but not because of anger or mean- 
spiritedness. No, Don Young ran hot because 
of his warmth, generosity, love of his staff, 
and relentless passion for Alaska. ‘‘Team 
DY’’ was and always will be a family, no 
matter what era of his career we served in. 
Growing up, I never knew my grandfathers. 
It is appropriate then that at the helm of 
this family was Congressman Young—a man 
of great maturity, wisdom, and grit who al-
ways had your back. Through him, I learned 
how to take on life with his independent 
spirit and unyielding authenticity. Team DY 
laughed, celebrated, and stood together on 
behalf of Alaska. Congressman Young was 
with us every step of the way, working just 
as hard as we did. The frequent downtime in 
between votes, meetings, and travels across 
the state gave us treasured time with the 
boss we loved. Over the years, this bond be-
tween the Congressman and his staff only 
grew stronger, and his loyalty to us under-
scored just how much our team meant to 
him. 
Like so many others, the Congressman 
took a chance on me and changed my life. He 
empowered me to always improve myself and 
be there for those around me. He truly 
meant the world to me, and I will never let 
anyone forget the work he did for those 
around him. I was with him at the end, and 
it has been difficult to process everything 
that happened. In the hours and days after 
he passed, I felt enormous grief and anger 
over my chance presence on-site as he left 
this earth. But as I have had time to reflect, 
I now see this as a blessing. The Congress-
man always trusted us to do the jobs we were 
hired to do. On his final day on this earth, it 
was a tremendous honor to support this in-
credible man at the end of his life, and to put 
the skills he taught me to use by being there 
for Anne and getting him back to the insti-
tution he loved. That was my final assign-
ment from the Congressman, and I hope I 
made him proud. I’ll miss this irreplaceable 
man dearly. I take comfort knowing that his 
indomitable spirit and unrelenting optimism 
will always be my North Star. 
JERRY HOOD 
DIRECTOR OF STATE AFFAIRS 
(2006–2009) 
Our friendship spanned more than four dec-
ades. He was truly a legend in his own time. 
He accomplished much. You can travel the 
entire State of Alaska and everywhere you 
look you will see his accomplishments. Don’s 
fingerprints are in every nook and cranny of 
the state. He loved Alaska but I will let oth-
ers tell you of all he did, and there is much 
to tell. 
If I could describe Don Young in one word 
it would be: LOYAL. Yes, LOYAL in all caps. 
He was LOYAL to a fault. Once he gave you 
his loyalty it was forever. He never gave up 
on you even though you may have let him 
down. And sometimes that loyalty didn’t 
serve him well. However, Don Young didn’t 
expect loyalty in return for his. You see, 
that’s the kind of guy he was. He was 
LOYAL to his state. He was LOYAL to Alas-
kans, he was LOYAL to his friends and he 
was LOYAL to his family. I can assure you 
that every decision he ever made was first 
and foremost made in the best interests of 
Alaska and its citizens. Alaska is a much 
better place because of Congressman Don 
Young. 
He spoke his mind. He told you what he 
thought. He never broke with his values. He 
was true to himself from the first day he 
took the oath until the day he died. Some 
say that Washington changed Don but I can 
tell you that up until Friday, March 18th, he 
was the same man as the guy I first met in 
1976. There aren’t many politicians over the 
course of history you can say that about. 
But then, he was one of a kind. 
He went out the way he wanted. In the sad-
dle. 
My fondest memories of Don were the 
times when we were able to steal an hour or 
two fishing on the Naknek River. Just the 
two of us. Our favorite cigars, fishing poles 
in hand and for a few moments in time—just 
relaxing. We were fishing. We certainly 
weren’t catching. But we didn’t care. Fare-
well my old friend. I will miss you terribly.

A former Transportation & Infrastructure 
Aviation Subcommittee Staff Director under 
Chairman Young, I recall several mornings 
when he would call me from his office. I 
knew he had someone with him because he 
always had you on the speaker phone—and 
when he did this he almost always had con-
stituents from Alaska with him. 
He would call and start out very nice, 
how’s your morning, did you get your beauty 
sleep, etc., and then on the turn of a dime in 
his most powerful and loud voice he would

say—‘‘that bill you are working on for me, I 
don’t want to see the word _ in that bill, not

there will be hell to pay. Have a nice day!’’ 
It was poetic. 
SOPHIA A. VARNASIDIS 
RESOURCES COMMITTEE STAFF 
(2004–2017) 
I had stopped by Rep. Young’s office to 
DY’s Chief of Staff, Pamela Day, as I would 
often do at the end of the work day early in 
2009. Rep. Doc Hastings had just taken over 
as Ranking Member of the House Natural 
Resources Committee, which DY held the 
previous Congress. DY came into Pam’s of-
fice, sat down next to me and said ‘‘how you 
doing’ young lady? They taking care of you 
over there?’’ To which I answered, ‘‘yes, of 
course’’ and thanked him for asking. He then 
chatted with us for a bit, and left for the 
evening. 
I still makes me tear-up thinking about 
the kindness he showed me in that moment. 
He lost his Ranking Membership, and yet 
was concerned his staff that was held over 
under new leadership were taken care of. I 
went through 4 changes of leadership in my 
13 years at Natural Resources, but DY was 
singular in his love for his staff. Invited us 
over to his home for Kentucky Derby view-
ing, threw the biggest Christmas parties, and 
stayed to hold court and tell stories in his 
office for hours. His personality was bigger 
than life, but so was his heart. The media 
loved to cover him in his more animated mo-
ments, but his real friends and those who 
worked for him knew him to be fiercely 
loyal, and a caring and kind soul. The true 
King in the North. May his memory be eter-
nal. 
LISA PITTMAN 
DEPUTY CHIEF COUNSEL, COMMITTEE ON 
RESOURCES 
(1995–2001) 
CHIEF COUNSEL 
(2001–2020) 
DY’s first wife, Mrs. Lu Young, attended 
the first Committee on Resources markup 
chaired by DY and sat in the back row. Half-
way through, she sent a note up to the Chair-
man. We were a little nervous about what 
she might say. Mrs. Young may have been 
petite, but she was fierce and thoroughly had 
the big gruff Don Young wrapped around her 
little finger. The note, which he opened in 
front of me (I sat to his immediate left dur-
ing markups) said ‘‘Smile more.’’ And he did. 
Don Young was also instrumental in the 
House rules change that allowed certain 
votes to be postponed and then voted in se-
ries in committee. Like many other non-
exclusive committees, the Committee on Re-
sources’ members served on multiple com-
mittees and given scheduling demands often 
had to be in two places at once. Maintaining 
quorums and vote margins was increasing 
difficult. DY successfully argued to the Par-
liamentarian, House leadership and the 
Rules Committee that if the Speaker could 
allow such action on the Floor, the practice 
should be allowed in committee. As one of 
the most active committees in the House, 
the Committee on Resources certainly took 
advantage of the rule to produce more sub-
stantive bills for the floor than just about 
any other committee. And staff had fewer 
heart attacks. 
Finally, DY taught me to always bring at 
least three copies of any remarks/talking 
points staff had prepared for him to the 
House Floor. I’d usually hand him one when 
he first reached the chamber and settled 
back in the unofficial Don Young seat on the 
aisle in the last row of the right rear of the 
chamber. Somehow he inevitably managed 
to misplace it before our bill was called up 
(no doubt distracted by the many Members 
who stopped by to talk to him). He’d often 
signal me to give me another copy before we 
began. I keep the third in the front of my 
Floor notebook for when he ambled down the 
aisle to take his place at the manager’s 
table, sometimes with the talking points out 
of order or missing a page. It didn’t really 
matter much anyway—he rarely followed the 
script and often spoke more eloquently from 
the heart than any words typed out by staff. 
COLIN CHAPMAN 
CHIEF OF STAFF 
(1997–2002) 
A story from my tenure as Chief of Staff, 
1997–2002 on the mischievous side of Chair-
man Young: In the late nineties and early 
2000’s, the Alaska delegation was at one of 
its highest points as far as seniority and 
power was concerned. The House and the 
Senate were controlled by the Republicans. 
All three members of the delegation, Rep. 
Young, Sen. Stevens, and Sen. Frank Mur-
kowski, had 20 or more years of seniority. 
They were each Chairman of powerful com-
mittees. They were each, in their own right, 
a powerful Member of Congress that liked to 
control legislation and have things done 
THEIR WAY! And they each had the strong, 
sometimes 
combustible, 
personality 
you 
might expect of a Senior Member of Congress 
with Alaskan heritage. 
In public, the Alaska delegation created 
and performed as a united front. But the del-
egation meetings- That was a different story 
. . . In the late 90’s, the delegation was work-
ing on opening Arctic National Wildlife Ref-
uge (ANWR), an ongoing battle that replayed 
Congress after Congress. I remember one del-
egation meeting where ANWR was the pri-
mary discussion topic. The delegation was 
trying to decide how to best move the legis-
lation, and as always, the Senate side strat-
egy was the sticking point. Sen. Murkowski 
wanted to move the legislation via the com-
mittee of jurisdiction, Energy & Natural Re-
sources, which he just happened to Chair. 
Sen Stevens wanted to move it via an Appro-
priations and Reconciliation process, a route 
that he controlled as Chairman of Appropria-
tions. Don Young’s position was for the Sen-
ate to pull their heads out of the . . . sand, 
pass the bill in whichever way they could, 
and he would get it done on the House side. 
At one particular meeting, held on Sen 
Stevens’ turf in his Capitol hideaway office, 
Chairman Young and Chairman Murkowski 
were present at the appointed time with 
their Chiefs of Staff. Stevens was late. After 
about 15 minutes of waiting, the Junior Sen-
ator was getting antsy. He had explained his 
plan for the ENR Committee while waiting 
and why his committee was the best option. 
After about 20 minutes of waiting, Sen. Ste-
vens waltzed into the room. Effusively apolo-
gizing for being late and launching into his 
plan of why the Appropriation route was so 
much better than the ENR route. Having 
just listened to the 15 minute ENR pitch, 
Chairman Young knew that nothing would 
get accomplished at this meeting because 
the Senate delegation’s path forward was 
still unclear. 
Mr. Young, who was standing in between 
the two Senators, popped off a comment 
about how the one Senator thought the other 
Senator didn’t have a clue what he was talk-
ing about. This launched the two Senators 
into a heated personal argument. DY looked 
at me, chuckled, and said, ‘‘Let’s go Colin, 
my work here is done . . .’’ As we left, DY 
was still chuckling to himself and com-
mented about how much fun it was to light 
the fuse and walk out of the room. 
As always, the delegation circled the wag-
ons and pushed forward with a united front. 
The ANWR fight wasn’t successful that year, 
but Chairman Young did eventually see it 
through! 
HOLLY WOODRUFF LYONS 
My favorite memory of Chairman Young 
was during my first year-and-a-half as a 
Committee staffer. I have to admit I was ini-
tially a bit intimidated by Chairman Young. 
However, that all changed in 2003. In October 
of that year, a toy gun was brought to the 
House Offices by a staffer as part of a Hal-
loween costume. It set off a security scare 
and the Capitol was locked down for several 
hours as the police looked for the ‘‘gun’’. 
I happened to be on the Floor with a few 
other T&I Members and staff as we had a bill 
on the schedule. Chairman Young was with 
us. There was quite a bit of confusion that 
day and things were already tense in the 
post-9/11 world. I will never forget how Chair-
man Young chose to come over and sit with 
his staff. He spent the time entertaining us 
while 
providing 
a 
calm, 
steady 
and 
unflappable example. He regaled us with one 
story after another of his time on the Hill. 
These stories, as you can imagine, were both 
funny and amazing, but I will not repeat 
them here. He also shared with us his knowl-
edge of the House Floor by pointing out 
things in the Chamber and sharing inter-
esting historical facts. He literally had a 
captive audience, but we did not feel like 
hostages. After that day, I was no longer in-
timidated by the Chairman. He always com-
manded respect, but I had seen his fun and 
friendly side. (The soft side of the grizzly 
bear, so to speak.) 
DAVID SCHAFFER 
TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
COMMITTEE STAFFER 
(1984–2004) 
A passage from the book ‘‘After: How 
America Confronted the September 12 Era) 
by Steven Brill, which illustrates Chairman 
Young’s no-nonsense approach to his posi-
tion as Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee Chair, in the wake of 9/11: 
‘‘But he (Staff Director Schaffer) was also 
a stickler for legislative procedure, which 
means hearings and debate, and more hear-
ings and more debate, and drafts and redrafts 
before anything important is allowed to 
pass. So he was shocked on Monday when is 
boss, Congressman Don Young, the burly 
Alaska Republican who chaired the Trans-
portation Committee, told him that they had 
to pass a bill within a day or two. When he 
protested that something this important and 
unprecedented, not to mention expensive, 
never moved that fast, Young thundered, 
‘‘We’re at war, we have to do this now.’’ 
JASON SUSLAVICH 
DY-CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE STAFFER  
(2008–2015) 
While Don Young focused on transpor-
tation and resource development, he was also 
a diehard champion of missile defense. In 
fact, what many do not know the leading 
role that Don played in locating our home-
land missile defenses in Alaska. In 1995, the 
Clinton Administration adopted a national 
intelligence estimate (NIE) which made one 
very startling conclusion—namely that U.S. 
homeland would not face the threat of a mis-
sile attack until at least 2010. Absurdly, the 
NIE arrived at this conclusion by excluding 
threats to Alaska and Hawaii, as if only the 
contiguous forty-eight states needed protec-
tion. 
Learning of this critical policy failure, 
Don jumped into action and introduced the 
‘‘The All-American Resolution.’’ This impor-
tant legislation expressed Congress’ view 
that ‘‘any missile defense system deployed to 
protect the United States against the threat

of ballistic missile attack should include 
protection for Alaska, Hawaii, the territories 
and the commonwealths of the United States 
on the same basis as the contiguous States.’’ 
Language from this resolution was soon 
adopted into National Defense Authorization 
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1999 and enacted into 
law. This language helped to set the stage 
for the U.S. to withdraw from the 1972 Anti- 
Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, thereby al-
lowing us to build our nation’s first home-
land missile defense system at Fort Greely, 
Alaska—a location which would protect ALL 
fifty states. 
From that point on, Don continued to 
strongly support missile defense. He fought 
for defense budgets that were driven by 
strategy, not defense strategies that were 
driven budgets. For decades, he ensured crit-
ical military construction for our missile de-
fense systems—located at Fort Greely, Clear 
Air Force Station, and Eareckson Air Sta-
tion—expeditiously passed the House and 
were fully funded. 
Then in 2017, amidst a resurgent North Ko-
rean threat, Don Young again championed 
our cause. He—along with Senator Dan Sul-
livan (the bill’s original author)—sponsored 
the ‘‘Advancing America’s Missile Defense 
Act of 2017’’ and led the charge to include it 
into the House’s FY 2018 NDAA. Critically, 
this bill authorized an increase to our na-
tion’s Ground-based Interceptor capacity by 
50% and it laid the groundwork for the con-
struction of a new missile field at Fort 
Greely—Missile Field 4—to house that added 
capacity. During the debate on his amend-
ment, the Congressman stated, 
‘‘I believe this reckless and calculated be-
havior by the North Korean regime speaks 
volumes to the importance of the strategi-
cally placed U.S. missile defense capabilities, 
including the Ground-based interceptors at 
Fort Greely, AK and other elements of the 
nation’s ballistic missile defense system. 
These forces guard this nation and are the 
first responders against weapons of mass de-
struction.’’ 
He was right then and his words ring even 
more true today. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today is a solemn day. 
Today, in the National Statuary Hall of the 
U.S. Capitol, we paid tribute to the Dean of 
the House of Representatives, the late Con-
gressman Don Young. And how fitting is it for 
Congressman Young to lie in state in National 
Statuary Hall. Much like this hall, Don Young 
is an icon—a pillar—in the history of the 
House of Representatives. 
Longevity as an elected official isn’t a 
given—it has to be earned. And for 49 straight 
years, Don Young earned the honor of rep-
resenting Alaska in Congress, which he con-
sidered the privilege of a lifetime. Congress-
man Young loved Alaska, and Alaska loved 
him. By the end of his tenure, not only was he 
the longest-serving politician in Alaska’s his-
tory, but also the longest-serving Republican 
Member of the House of Representatives in 
U.S. history. 
Now, you may not think that a nurse from 
Texas and a frontiersman from Alaska would 
have a lot in common. And for the most part, 
you’d be right. But that never stopped us from 
working together when it meant the betterment 
of our constituents. We partnered on legisla-
tion that provided Pell Grants to Gold Star 
Families. We led an annual letter advocating 
for increased funding for the Innovative Ap-
proaches to Literacy (IAL) program. We spent 
long days and late nights together in the 
Transportation & Infrastructure Committee 
hearings. The list goes on and on. 
We also had the opportunity to travel the 
world together on CODELs. He sponsored val-
uable and worthwhile trips that I never hesi-
tated to sign up for. And the farther away we 
got from Washington, the closer we became. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his be-
loved wife, Anne, with whom I had the pleas-
ure of getting to know over the years, as well 
as his children, grandchildren, and all those 
who loved him. He will be dearly missed. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the Congressman for all of Alaska, the 
45th Dean of the House, and my mentor and 
friend—Representative Don Young. 
Don was a soldier, a riverboat captain, and 
a teacher—but his true calling was serving 
and representing the good people of Alaska. 
Throughout his 49 years in Congress, he 
was an icon and mentor to countless Mem-
bers. When I first arrived here, Don was one 
of the first Members I met. In the short time 
I had with him, he taught me so much about 
the House and about being a true servant. 
Don’s love of his family and the people of 
Alaska was rivaled only by his love of the land 
itself. He took countless members and staff to 
his beloved state to show them the pristine 
natural wonder of his state. 
This summer he was going to take me on 
a working trip to Alaska—and one of my great 
regrets in this body will forever be never get-
ting to go with him. 
Rest in peace, my friend.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2954.

WOMEN OF THE REPRODUCTIVE 
RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent to give all 
members 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the subject of 
my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, 
this night, and this Women’s History 
Month, together with my colleagues in 
the Pro-Choice Caucus, I rise in sup-
port of the women of the reproductive 
rights movement. Women who stood 
up, spoke out, and reached out to pro-
tect the rights of women in this coun-
try to determine whether and when to 
become parents. Of course, this work 
required and requires to this day, a 
broad, bold coalition of people, people 
whose work has necessitated tremen-
dous sacrifice and has resulted in tre-
mendous progress. 
Some of them were denied access to 
contraception, 
abortion 
care, 
and 
healthcare, and agreed to become the 
face of legal challenges. Some of them 
were strategists who shaped the argu-
ments that became the fabric of legal 
protections for reproductive rights. 
Some of them were healthcare pro-
viders who saw the tragic consequences 
of the denial of those rights. As a law-
yer, I have known some of their names 
through the landmark cases that bear 
them—Griswold v. Connecticut, Roe v. 
Wade, and more. 
Tonight, we celebrate them, we cele-
brate their courage, their commitment, 
and their purpose in articulating, advo-
cating, and ensuring the rights to 
equality, privacy, and dignity that 
their work represents. 
Before yielding to my colleagues who 
are here this evening in person and in 
spirit, I will start with one of them 
who holds a special place in this work 
and in my own life. As a woman from 
Texas, it has always been a source of 
great pride that some fearless Texas 
women have been leaders in this fight. 
In the late 1960s, a group of Texas 
women came together to challenge our 
State’s ban on abortion. They found as 
their lawyer and lifelong advocate, a 
young 
woman 
named 
Sarah 
Weddington, who is pictured here be-
hind me. A recent law school graduate, 
Sarah Weddington was working for the 
University of Texas at that time. Per-
haps not surprisingly, although she had 
good grades and a law degree, she had 
a hard time finding a job in a law firm. 
But she was working to help people 
solve their problems in Austin, and 
this group knew she would be a good 
advocate. 
I heard her tell the story once that 
when the group came to see her, they 
told her that they thought the best 
way to deal with the law was to chal-
lenge the law itself. She said that she 
had a law degree, but she really hadn’t 
practiced in Federal court before. She 
wasn’t a courtroom lawyer, and she 
hadn’t handled a case like this one. So 
she told them she thought they should 
get someone with more experience. 
She recalled to us they asked her, 
Well, what would you charge us to do 
this lawsuit? 
And she said, Oh, I will do it for free. 
And they said, You are our lawyer. 
And that is how she got the case. 
Sarah called her law school class-
mate, Linda Coffee, and they agreed to 
work on the case together. Many UT 
law students and professors helped 
Sarah and Linda with the case. They 
heard from women, of course, and from 
doctors who treated women who had 
had complications from illegal abor-
tions and women who had died from il-
legal abortions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3965 
March 29, 2022 
Through their work, the strategizing, 
the organizing, the lawyering, these 
trailblazing Texas women brought us 
the framework to protect the health, 
privacy, dignity, equality, and freedom 
of women and families across this 
country in the case of Roe v. Wade. 
And 26-year-old Sarah Weddington and 
this team of Texas women took that 
case all the way to the United States 
Supreme Court. 
On January 22, 1973, the Court ruled 
in one of the most consequential deci-
sions in American history, the Texas 
State law banning abortions, except to 
save a woman’s life, was unconstitu-
tional. 
b 1945 
Sarah carried this fight with her for 
the rest of her life. She was elected to 
the Texas legislature. She served in the 
Carter administration where she helped 
get more women on the Federal bench. 
She worked for many years as a lec-
turer and professor teaching at schools, 
including the University of Texas. 
This year, 2022, was the first one that 
we marked the anniversary of Roe 
without Sarah Weddington. She left a 
legacy for us through her life’s work, 
the rights and protections for the 
health, privacy, dignity, equality, and 
freedom of women and families en-
shrined in that decision that has 
shaped our country and our opportuni-
ties as women for the last 50 years. 
She was part of a generation of trail-
blazing Texas women who made it their 
life’s work to make our world one of 
equality, opportunity, and possibility 
for women. It is fitting to remember, 
honor, and celebrate her tonight. 
Madam Speaker, several of my col-
leagues are here to remember and 
honor other women pioneers, trail-
blazers, and heroes of the reproductive 
rights movement. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Texas (Mrs. 
FLETCHER), who has been someone I 
have deeply admired as part of the 
women’s movement, as part of the 
women’s choice movement, and who 
has made herself a leader in this body 
and a leader in Texas, and for bringing 
us all here tonight as part of Women’s 
History Month. 
Madam Speaker, I am rising along-
side my pro-choice colleagues in hon-
oring the women of the reproductive 
heath, rights, and justice movement. 
Women, like my own mother, who re-
member 
being 
young 
and 
without 
choice—without choice over their bod-
ily autonomy. Women like my own 
mother who marched for women’s 
rights, who remember when Roe v. 
Wade came down. 
Madam Speaker, I am here today to 
rise for the brave providers, the fierce 
advocates, the trailblazing women of 
color who established the principles 
and coined the terms, and all those 
who believe in a society where women 
are entitled to make personal decisions 
about their bodies, work, families, and 
futures. 
For those who agreed to become the 
face of legal challenges to abortion ac-
cess, the litigators who helped shape 
the arguments that became the legal 
fabric of protections for reproductive 
rights, and the women who have served 
as the jurists and the justices who 
wrote 
landmark 
defenses 
of 
these 
rights. We must protect their progress 
from destructive efforts in the States 
to overturn precedent that has saved 
countless lives and determined count-
less futures. 
Rights are under attack. For nearly 6 
months now, patients in Texas have 
been denied a constitutional right to 
an abortion due to a statewide law de-
signed to restrict, shame, and penalize 
those who dare to terminate a preg-
nancy that they do not wish to carry to 
term. 
Just last week, Idaho became the 
first State to copy Texas’ model. We 
stand here in this Chamber across the 
street from another body of govern-
ance, our courts, the Supreme Court 
that might overrule Roe v. Wade. If it 
is overturned by the United States Su-
preme Court, my home State of Michi-
gan would automatically join that list. 
In fact, if Roe fails, if Roe escapes us, 
half the States in this Union will ban 
abortion entirely, leaving even more 
people across large swaths of the Mid-
west and South without access to care. 
This is not just an issue of bodily au-
tonomy, my friends, it is an economic 
issue. 
The U.S. is the only industrialized 
Nation without Federal paid leave pol-
icy, the emergence of COVID–19 has 
shown us the consequences of that 
foundational failure. Who are we to be-
come? What Nation are we that will 
not stand up for its people’s rights and 
the success of their families? 
We all know that women have been 
disproportionately impacted by this 
pandemic, being forced to leave the 
workforce 
at 
record 
rates. 
When 
childcare and abortion services are 
both out of reach, a parent’s financial 
future and ability to participate in our 
economy is severely jeopardized. 
Let us not forget that the individ-
ual’s most harmed by abortion restric-
tions are those who already face bar-
riers to accessing healthcare, including 
women, people of color, members of the 
LGBTQ 
community, 
immigrants, 
young people, those living in rural 
communities, and people with disabil-
ities. This is a wake-up moment in this 
Nation. We are here not just for his-
tory, but for our future. 
When I was elected to Congress, on 
behalf of Michigan’s 11th District, be-
coming the first women ever to rep-
resent Michigan’s 11th District. Sure, 
let’s be proud then as we are now for 
the unprecedented number of women 
who are serving in this body. Those 
who are unequivocally claiming that 
we have the right to choose. Abortion 
is healthcare. Hear us say that in the 
Chamber and on this floor. All women 
must be able to make the decision that 
is best for them, their family, and their 
body. 
Congress has a responsibility to 
stand with people in communities 
fighting for racial, economic, and re-
productive justice, and we must com-
mit to protecting the right of every 
person to make their own decisions 
about their bodies, free from discrimi-
nation and political interference. 
It is with immense gratitude and rev-
erence that I join my colleagues in 
honoring the women who have made it 
possible for so many of us to stand here 
today—to be here today. During Wom-
en’s History Month, let us all recom-
mit to supporting the activism, the or-
ganizing, the efforts all around this 
country, those who are watching and 
who are counting on us. 
Madam Speaker, we will vote today, 
we will vote tomorrow, and we will 
continue to do the work of the people. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
VEASEY). 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my friend from Houston 
(Mrs. FLETCHER) for putting this to-
gether because this is hugely impor-
tant as we wind down Women’s History 
Month. 
I think about my first term here in 
Congress, and previous to serving in 
Congress I was in the State legislature. 
The Republicans in the Texas State 
legislature were always trying to tear 
down women’s reproductive rights. It 
seemed like there was just an endless 
supply of bills that they had aimed at 
stripping away freedom from women 
across our State. 
I was giving a speech out on the tri-
angle and momentarily thought that I 
was back in Austin and accidentally re-
ferred to myself as State Representa-
tive MARC VEASEY, just because when 
you think about D.C. and the various 
States that are here, you think about 
people being able to celebrate those 
sorts of freedoms. 
We are fighting that battle not just 
in Austin but in D.C. and other States 
around the country. But today we are 
here to focus on Texas. Again, I just 
want to thank LIZZIE FLETCHER and the 
other women that are a part of the 
Texas delegation. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to thank 
the female State representatives in the 
State of Texas that really have just 
fought fearlessly on this issue for so 
long now. This past regular legislative 
session so many of the women in the 
north Texas delegation, where I am 
from, were very poignant in making so 
many points about how S.B. 8, a sweep-
ing anti-abortion law, was going to dis-
proportionately 
impact 
low-income 
and women of color and minority com-
munities. 
Imagine just barely being able to get 
by; you may be on SNAP; you may be 
a single mother; you may find yourself 
trapped in a low-income job and trying 
to accumulate enough money to be

able to travel across State lines. You 
could have these services and get them 
done safely. It is sad to see us go back 
in time to where women were not able 
to have these services done safely. 
That is something that we have to con-
tinue to fight against, and that is 
why—whatever it takes—we need to 
make sure that this bill one day is re-
versed. 
Passing the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act would codify Roe v. Wade and 
ensure that people can have the free-
dom to make personal decisions. I 
think that is something that every-
body—regardless if you are Democrat, 
Republican or Independent, whatever 
you may happen to be—you ought to 
have the choice to make personal deci-
sions. It used to be something that Re-
publicans used to value, and it is sad to 
see them backslide so much in this 
area. 
We need to make sure that we pro-
tect equal access to abortion care ev-
erywhere because it is essential to so-
cial and economic participation, repro-
ductive autonomy, and the right for 
people to determine their own lives. 
One of the things that really doesn’t 
get talked a lot about on this issue is 
just really the number of Republicans 
that are against any sort of birth con-
trol. I see them, they come to my town 
hall meetings. They don’t like to talk 
about it because they know that most 
people overwhelmingly, Democrats and 
Republicans, are for birth control. You 
hear them, they come and they say, no, 
no, no, birth control is wrong. 
We had a lawsuit filed in Fort Worth 
in Federal Court to try to stop people 
from being able to get birth control. 
People need to understand that this is 
a larger battle. Right now it is abor-
tion access, but believe me, Repub-
licans have their sights set on people 
not being able to have basic birth con-
trol, just basic contraceptions, and 
they are trying to make that harder 
and harder for people to get a hold of. 
It is a slippery slope. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague 
from 
Houston, 
LIZZIE 
FLETCHER, for leading this hour be-
cause it is hugely important. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. VEASEY and I join him in his 
remarks that we are so grateful to our 
State legislators and the Members of 
our Texas delegation as we face these 
challenges at home. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative FLETCHER
for 
holding this very important session. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to rec-
ognize the healthcare providers who 
have dedicated their lives working to 
ensure equitable access to reproductive 
healthcare. 
Today I am honored to highlight the 
work and courage of Susan Hill of 
North Carolina, the former president of 
the National Women’s Health Organi-
zation in North Carolina, and a fierce 
advocate for abortion access and repro-
ductive rights. 
Susan opened clinics across the coun-
try to ensure that women could access 
the healthcare they need, including 
abortion care, with dignity and safety. 
She focused her work on providing re-
productive 
health 
services 
in 
the 
Southeast, 
despite 
onerous 
restric-
tions, so that pregnant women could 
make the best healthcare decisions for 
themselves and their families no mat-
ter where they lived. 
In fact, Susan Hill founded Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization, which is 
now the last remaining health center 
providing abortions in Mississippi. This 
very clinic is at the center of the case 
directly challenging Roe v. Wade that 
is currently before the Supreme Court. 
If the Court decides to uphold Mis-
sissippi’s abortion ban and gut Roe, it 
will be overturning nearly 50 years of 
judicial precedent and undermining 
women’s fundamental right to make 
their own personal decisions about 
their bodies, their families, their fu-
tures. 
b 2000 
Susan Hill never wavered in her com-
mitment to protecting patients’ auton-
omy and safety, even as anti-abortion 
protestors used arson, fire bombing, 
and countless acts of vandalism to in-
timidate her into closing down her 
clinics. 
Today, the stakes for reproductive 
freedom are more dire than ever before. 
Extreme abortion bans and medically 
unnecessary restrictions are sweeping 
our country and posing an enormous 
threat to women’s health and constitu-
tional rights. Decimating abortion ac-
cess diminishes our equality under the 
law. 
The consequences of these egregious 
attacks most acutely impact commu-
nities of color and underserved commu-
nities which already face barriers to 
healthcare. 
Healthcare cannot just be for the 
few, as the legacy of Susan Hill re-
minds us. All people deserve access to 
the reproductive care they need, free 
from political interference, discrimina-
tion, and harassment. 
Years ago, I spoke on a panel about 
abortion rights with a physician who 
had done his residency in Philadelphia 
before the passage of Roe v. Wade. He 
told us about his experience working in 
the emergency room, trying to save 
desperate women who were near death 
from 
botched 
back-alley 
abortions, 
women who suffered irreparable dam-
age, women who didn’t make it. 
And he told us that history has 
shown there will always be abortions. 
The only question is whether abortions 
will be safe and whether they will be 
available to those who are faced with 
terribly difficult choices. 
We must ensure that all people have 
the right to control their own repro-
ductive decisions, and have the right to 
the reproductive healthcare they need. 
I am proud to recognize a fellow 
North Carolinian, Susan Hill, and to 
share her commitment to ensuring 
that abortion rights are protected, and 
comprehensive reproductive healthcare 
is accessible to all who need it. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative MANNING for the 
important points that she made, talk-
ing about the importance of access to 
safe abortions. 
Even today, the World Health Orga-
nization estimates that 47,000 women 
die from unsafe abortions each year. 
That is 13 percent of maternal deaths 
worldwide. 
Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from New Hamp-
shire (Ms. KUSTER). 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, as an 
adoption attorney for 25 years, I 
worked with more than 300 birth moth-
ers making the most personal, private 
decisions of their entire lives. They 
consulted their families, their loved 
ones, their doctors, but not one of 
these birth mothers looked to the gov-
ernment to make this choice for them. 
On January 1 of this year, sweeping 
abortion restrictions took effect in my 
home State of New Hampshire; in fact, 
the first abortion ban ever to pass the 
New Hampshire legislature and to be 
signed into law by our Governor, Chris 
Sununu, making it illegal to terminate 
a pregnancy after 24 weeks, with no ex-
ceptions; no exceptions for rape, for in-
cest, or for fatal fetal anomaly; and re-
quiring every person seeking an abor-
tion to undergo an invasive ultrasound. 
This new law places a felony penalty 
and fine of up to $100,000 for doctors 
who violate the law, making New 
Hampshire a less desirable place for 
doctors to work, and for patients to 
seek care. 
Granite State women and families 
are already feeling the impact of this 
harmful, regressive abortion ban. 
Earlier this year, a constituent of 
mine, the daughter of a dear friend, 
reached out to tell me her story and 
how this law is impacting families like 
hers across New Hampshire. 
Madam Speaker, 38-year-old Lisa, has 
a beautiful 1-year-old daughter at 
home and she is now pregnant with 
twins. Twenty-one weeks into her preg-
nancy, her doctors told her what no 
parent wants to hear: One of her twins 
had no chance of surviving outside the 
womb, and that twin was threatening 
the life of her other healthy twin. 
Because of New Hampshire’s abortion 
ban that makes no exceptions for late- 
term complications, fetal viability, or 
even maternal well-being, Lisa and her 
husband have had to travel out of state 
to get a second opinion on their op-
tions. 
After traveling four States away for 
a specialist consultation, they learned 
that an abortion had the potential to 
save the healthy twin’s life, and even 
the life of the mother. But in the time 
that it took to get this second opinion 
and to weigh her options, Lisa was past 
the 24-week threshold in New Hamp-
shire, and she will be unable to get this 
treatment, even if it becomes medi-
cally necessary.

March 29, 2022 
If Lisa chooses to deliver her healthy 
twin in New Hampshire, she runs the 
risk of losing both babies, and even her 
own life, as her doctors would not be 
allowed to perform an abortion, even to 
save her healthy twin’s life or her own 
life. 
Lisa and her family are already fac-
ing an impossible circumstance, which 
is being made even more excruciating 
by the New Hampshire extreme abor-
tion ban. 
Safe access to reproductive and pre-
ventative healthcare, including abor-
tion, is essential to the health and 
well-being of women and their families 
in New Hampshire and throughout this 
country. Restrictions on access to re-
productive care ignore the complex-
ities of maternal health and threaten 
the life of countless mothers and their 
children. 
New Hampshire’s new abortion ban, 
and those like it across the country, 
are harming families, and putting poli-
tics above health and science. This I 
know: New Hampshire voters believe in 
less government interference in peo-
ple’s personal and private lives. 
I want to thank Lisa for sharing her 
story, and for shedding light on the 
tragic impact that this abortion ban is 
having on mothers and grandmothers 
and husbands and families like her 
across the Granite State and through-
out this country. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the rep-
resentative from Texas for this oppor-
tunity. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative KUSTER for her 
leadership and for her impactful story 
here tonight, one of the many women 
of this reproductive rights movement. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
LOIS 
FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. My, 
my, my, Madam Speaker. Here we go 
again. 
I thank my friend from Texas for 
yielding. I keep saying that I think 
Texas and Florida, we are in the race, 
the race for the worst. I don’t know 
who is winning that one. 
But like the gentlewoman, those of 
us in Florida, we have been stuck in an 
unfortunate situation, battling with a 
State government that is actively 
harming the people they are supposed 
to protect and it is especially true 
when it comes to abortion care. 
They call us the so-called Freedom 
State. We are the Freedom State, 
which means that the Republican legis-
lature and the Governor believe they 
have the freedom to deny people the 
freedom to make one of life’s most per-
sonal decisions, and that is whether to 
bring a child into the world. 
Madam Speaker, I remember the 
days before Roe v. Wade, and I was 15 
years old, and I—literally, one of my 
friends was missing for a day, so I went 
looking for her and I found her in a bed 
covered with blood. And what had hap-
pened is she had had a back-alley abor-
tion, nearly died. We got her to the 
hospital in time, but how I wish she 
could have gone and gotten proper 
care. That is just an example. 
Here’s the thing. You can have all 
the laws you want to outlaw abortion. 
You are not going to stop abortion. All 
these laws do are try to stop illegal 
abortion, and they unfairly burden the 
people with the least amount of money, 
because if you are wealthy you find a 
place where you can get a safe abor-
tion. 
But I want to say, I really come to 
this as a mother, and as a grand-
mother. Those who know me know that 
I—and my grandchildren call me Lolo. 
I come to this as a Lolo. Really, it is 
the best part of my life. What a bless-
ing my son is to me and my two grand-
children. 
But I also know the responsibility. I 
know the responsibility, which really 
brings us to why we are here today be-
cause, whether or not to bring a child 
into the world, as I mentioned, I think 
is one of the most important personal 
decisions that a person makes. 
They shouldn’t have to call their 
Congressperson, their Governor, their 
State legislature. 
So tonight, I want to thank the gen-
tlewoman because we are recognizing 
those people that we know in our com-
munity who have really been advocates 
or providers for the healthcare that 
people deserve and need. 
So I am going to recognize two cou-
rageous leaders from my home State of 
Florida, champions for women’s access 
to full healthcare, not just abortions, 
which should be part, but all kinds of 
care. And they are Lillian Tomayo and 
Mona Reis. 
And like the gentlewoman’s advo-
cates that she talked about tonight, 
they are fighting against, they have 
been fighting against an unending tide 
of terrible State laws that try to un-
dermine reproductive freedom. 
And once again, once again, this time 
we are following Texas, we are on the 
cusp of enacting a dangerous restric-
tive abortion ban, which is a ban on 
abortion after 15 weeks that is now 
awaiting our Governor’s certain signa-
ture. 
But for decades, Lillian and Mona, in 
their own capacities, have fought hard 
for reproductive freedom in our State. 
For more than 20 years, Lillian has 
been advocate for women, teens, the 
LGBTQ community as president and 
CEO of Planned Parenthood of South, 
East, and North Florida. 
And Mona Reis is the founder of the 
Presidential Women’s Center in Palm 
Beach County. She ran that for about 
40 years, and she faced threats, arson. 
There was a period of time, even 
today, abortion providers are under 
danger. Some have even been mur-
dered. 
But both have persisted. They have 
persisted to make sure our underserved 
communities 
have 
access 
to 
the 
healthcare that they need. And they 
have been essential in providing access 
to reproductive care, and the freedom 
that people deserve in our State. 
Each are going on a new journey, but 
they leave a legacy of unrelentless pur-
suit of reproductive freedom. I say 
thank you to Mona and to Lillian. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Representative 
FRANKEL
for 
sharing her stories from Florida. 
At this time, it is a pleasure to yield 
to the gentleman from the great State 
of Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
b 2015 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing the time. 
Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I 
rise tonight to take a stand on behalf 
of 
the 
pro-choice 
movement 
and 
women who have had to make the 
choice, women who have had to make 
this tough decision, this choice. 
Let’s get the record straight. Hence-
forth and forevermore, let it be known 
that you are either pro-choice or you 
are anti-choice. 
It is easy to be anti-choice when you 
don’t have to make the choice. It is 
easy to be anti-choice when it is not 
your wife who was raped. It is easy to 
be anti-choice when it is not your 
daughter who has had the incestuous 
relationship, without her permission, I 
always say. But even with her permis-
sion, it is wrong. 
It is easy to make the choice when it 
is not your child or your wife. You can 
be anti-choice then. But I only wonder 
how many persons who have been anti- 
choice, when confronted with having to 
make this choice, became pro-choice. 
We will never know. You can be anti- 
choice before the public and then pro- 
choice when it serves your purpose. 
I sincerely believe, Madam Speaker 
and Mrs. FLETCHER, that the long arm 
of the law has no place in a woman’s 
womb. This is not where the law be-
longs. This is the property of a woman, 
and she should make these decisions 
herself with those who she has trust in, 
those who care for her, those who she 
believes will help her to come to the 
right conclusions. 
I stand for those who are pro-choice. 
For those who are anti-choice, I say: 
Thank God you have not had to make 
the choice. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative GREEN. 
Madam Speaker, I have worked close-
ly with my colleagues in the Pro- 
Choice Caucus to identify stories that 
need to be told during this Special 
Order hour this evening. I am grateful 
to my colleagues who have taken to 
the floor this evening to share with us 
the stories of their constituents, to 
share with us the stories of those who 
they know have been fighters for repro-
ductive rights, for reproductive justice, 
for choice. 
One of our Pro-Choice Caucus leaders 
could not be with us tonight but has 
submitted a statement for the record 
that I would like to read now. From 
Representative JUDY CHU:

the abortion rights movement who

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3968 
March 29, 2022 
have come before us. I remember what 
it was like before the days of Roe. So 
today, I am helping to remember and 
honor those who gave their lives, who 
put their own bodies in harm’s way so 
that we might have the ability to de-
cide what to do with ours. 
‘‘Women like Pam, who lives in my 
district in Pasadena, California—Pam 
is in her seventies, retired, and spends 
her time volunteering in her commu-
nity. But Pam told me about a time 
when she was 22 years old. It was 1969, 
and even though she and her partner 
had been using birth control, Pam 
found out she was pregnant. 
‘‘This happened in the days before 
Roe v. Wade, which meant that her op-
tions were limited. That is how Pam 
found herself standing on the curb of 
an airport in Mexico City, waiting for 
someone to pick her up. Finally, a 
large black car came up and rolled 
down the window. ‘Are you Pam?’ the 
driver asked. ‘Yes,’ she replied, and got 
in the car, forced to trust and hope for 
the best. Thankfully, Pam wasn’t hurt 
during this experience, but she told me 
she has never forgotten the fear and 
uncertainty of putting her life in the 
hands of a stranger who could have 
hurt her and abused her, especially 
when we know that this is a procedure 
that is safe and can be done in a doc-
tor’s office, not someplace unknown 
and unsafe. 
‘‘That is why, now, Pam is deter-
mined to ensure that no one ever feels 
as scared and alone as she did that day. 
Pam volunteers at the Planned Parent-
hood Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley, 
serving as a support system to women 
who need a hand to hold or a shoulder 
to lean on. Pam is an abortion advo-
cate in her community because she be-
lieves, like I do, that everyone, no mat-
ter where they grew up, what language 
they speak, or how much money they 
make, deserves to have a say in what 
happens to their bodies. 
‘‘I rise today, as part of Women’s His-
tory Month, to honor Pam and so many 
others like her who were forced to 
make history so that others could have 
the choices that they were denied. The 
fight for reproductive rights would not 
be where it is today without advocates 
like Pam who stand up, time and time 
again, and demand that women have 
the right to decide.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this evening, the 
Pro-Choice Caucus and I also want to 
recognize the women who launched and 
built the groundbreaking reproductive 
justice movement. While women of 
color have long fought for these prin-
ciples, ‘‘reproductive justice’’ as a term 
was coined in 1994 when a group of 
Black women gathered in Chicago 
ahead of the International Conference 
on Population and Development in 
Cairo. 
Loretta Ross is one of a number of 
women who built the reproductive jus-
tice movement. She was part of the 
1994 meeting and went on to co-found 
the organization SisterSong, which de-
fines ‘‘reproductive justice’’ as the 
human right to maintain personal bod-
ily autonomy; to have children, not 
have children; and to parent the chil-
dren we have in safe and sustainable 
communities. 
A scholar who teaches both at Smith 
College and who has published exten-
sively on reproductive justice, she re-
cently testified at the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government 
Reform in this legislative session. 
Dorothy Roberts is another pioneer 
of the reproductive justice movement. 
From Pennsylvania, she is also consid-
ered one of the leaders. 
There have been many leaders in our 
government and in our communities 
who we celebrate tonight. We, in the 
Pro-Choice Caucus, have identified a 
few women who we want to highlight 
this evening. 
I will start with some of the law-
makers and legislators who helped pave 
the way, including Shirley Chisholm, 
the first Black woman elected to Con-
gress in 1968. She was also the first 
Black woman to run for President. 
Throughout her trailblazing career, she 
was a strong supporter of reproductive 
rights. 
In 1969, she was named honorary 
president of the National Abortion 
Rights Action League, NARAL. In 1970, 
she supported legalized abortion in her 
home State of New York. In 1970, she 
described abortion as an issue of eco-
nomic and racial justice. 
Louise Slaughter, a longtime Mem-
ber from New York and chairwoman of 
the Rules Committee, during her long 
tenure in Congress, served as a founder 
and co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus. 
In addition to championing legisla-
tion to protect and expand access to 
abortion and contraception, Represent-
ative Slaughter condemned efforts to 
expand the so-called conscience protec-
tions at the expense of healthcare ac-
cess and was an early leader on mar-
riage equality. 
First elected in 1972, Pat Schroeder 
was one of only 14 women in the House 
at the time of the January 1973 Roe v. 
Wade decision. When a male colleague 
asked her how she could be a mother of 
two small children and a Member of 
Congress at the same time, she fa-
mously replied: ‘‘I have a brain and a 
uterus, and I use both.’’ 
Other figures who are large in the 
women’s reproductive rights move-
ment, of course, must include Ellen 
Malcolm, who, in 1985, led a group of 
friends in creating an organization 
dedicated to electing pro-choice Demo-
cratic women, giving them the credi-
bility and resources that they needed 
through her organization, EMILY’s 
List. 
We began this evening talking about 
Sarah Weddington, and there are many 
lawyers and judges who have been a 
part of this movement at some time in 
their careers, including, famously, of 
course, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
Kathryn Kolbert, Priscilla Smith, and 
Linda Coffee. 
Of course, we heard from several peo-
ple tonight, several of our Members, 
about the work done in their local 
communities at Planned Parenthood 
health centers across the country. As 
we touch on some of these important 
women leaders in our community and 
our country, we certainly recognize the 
leadership 
that 
we 
have 
seen 
at 
Planned Parenthood health centers, in-
cluding Faye Wattleton, who was the 
first Black woman to serve as the 
president of the Planned Parenthood 
Federation of America, as well as the 
youngest; Cecile Richards, who was 
president of the Planned Parenthood 
Federation of America and the Planned 
Parenthood Action Fund, and she is 
the daughter of the late Texas Gov-
ernor, another champion for reproduc-
tive rights, women’s rights, and wom-
en’s equality, Ann Richards. 
Alexis McGill Johnson, the current 
president and CEO of the Planned Par-
enthood Federation of America and the 
Planned Parenthood Action Fund, is in 
charge of and oversees Planned Parent-
hood’s vital health services to 2.4 mil-
lion people each year through more 
than 600 health centers across the 
country. She is a champion for social 
and racial justice, a respected political 
and cultural organizer, and a tireless 
advocate for reproductive freedom. 
The National Abortion Rights Action 
League, which I mentioned earlier, has 
always had an incredible role to play in 
the fight for reproductive rights. Its 
leaders—Karen 
Mulhauser, 
Nanette 
Falkenberg, Kate Michelman, Nancy 
Keenan, Ilyse Hogue, and, today, Mini 
Timmaraju—have left an incredible 
mark. 
The Guttmacher Institute and its 
current leadership under Dr. Herminia 
Palacio—the 
Guttmacher 
Institute’s 
mission is to advance sexual and repro-
ductive health and rights in the United 
States and across the globe. 
There are so many people, so many 
women, 
who 
have 
come 
together 
around these issues, who have come to-
gether to protect the health, the equal-
ity, the autonomy, and the dignity of 
women across this country. Whether 
named or not this evening on the floor, 
those are the people who we celebrate 
tonight. 
Madam Speaker, we began this hour 
with a celebration of trailblazing, fear-
less women from my home State of 
Texas. I am so grateful to my col-
leagues from Texas who joined me this 
evening and to my colleagues from 
across the country who spoke out to-
night. 
Today in Texas, and across the coun-
try, reproductive rights are under at-
tack. The passage of the draconian 
Senate Bill 8 in Texas, which Rep-
resentative STEVENS discussed, which 
Representative VEASEY discussed, has 
created a healthcare crisis for women 
and healthcare providers across our 
State. Sadly, but not surprisingly, 
other States are quickly following suit. 
As we have seen, and as we have 
heard from some of our colleagues this 
evening, it is not merely abortion. Ad-
vocates with cases pending before the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3969 
March 29, 2022 
United States Supreme Court today, 
including Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization, are arguing that 
the protections recognized in Roe v. 
Wade and Griswold v. Connecticut, 
which gave married couples the right 
to use birth control, that those prin-
ciples should be rejected. 
This is alarming. This is terrifying. 
This is not what the majority of Amer-
icans want. It is not what people have 
fought so hard for so long to achieve. 
That is why it is so important that 
this evening we remember and honor 
the work that people have done to en-
sure reproductive rights, reproductive 
health, and reproductive justice. It is 
also important that we recommit our-
selves to continuing that work. 
As my colleagues noted, in Sep-
tember, thanks to the leadership of 
Representative JUDY CHU and the Pro- 
Choice Caucus, the House passed the 
Women’s Health Protection Act to pro-
tect the right to access abortion care 
against restrictions and bans in every 
State in our Union. 
Passing this legislation is a critical 
step toward creating a world where 
every person, whoever they are, wher-
ever they live, whatever their cir-
cumstances, is free to make the best 
healthcare and personal decisions for 
themselves, their families, and their 
futures. 
We must continue to defend and pro-
tect the fundamental rights essential 
to our autonomy, our dignity, and our 
equality that are represented in the 
case of Roe v. Wade and the Women’s 
Health Protection Act. 
In times like these, it is important to 
me to remember, and it is important 
for all of us to remember, that Texas 
gave us S.B. 8, but it also gave us 
Sarah 
Weddington, 
Loretta 
Ross, 
Cecile Richards, and so many other 
people who we talked about this 
evening and who we know have been 
champions for women’s health, wom-
en’s reproductive rights, and reproduc-
tive justice. 
b 2030 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Like women across 
the country, from New Hampshire to 
North Carolina to Florida to Michigan 
to California, all of whom spoke this 
evening, Texas women have fought and 
will continue to fight for the right to 
safe, legal, accessible abortion care, to 
reproductive healthcare, and to repro-
ductive justice. I am proud to be one of 
them. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MARCH 29, 2022 
No. 55 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable ALEX 
PADILLA, a Senator from the State of 
California. 
f 
PRAYER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today’s 
opening prayer will be offered by our 
guest chaplain, Robert H. Thune, Pas-
tor of Coram Deo Church, from Omaha, 
NE. 
The guest Chaplain offered the fol-
lowing prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, every one of us in this 
Chamber now—whether Senator, staff-
er, or civilian—is, first of all, a human 
being made in Your image. And so we 
pray. 
Give us grace to acknowledge our 
limitations, admit our faults, and to 
affirm our fellow human beings despite 
our many differences. Let us always re-
member that to You and You alone, we 
must give account. Those who serve in 
this Chamber have been given a noble 
and weighty responsibility to seek and 
serve the common good of these United 
States. And so, as they attend to the 
work before them this day, grant them 
the wisdom of Solomon, the courage of 
Esther, the patience of Jeremiah, and 
the humility of Mary. May they be 
guided 
by 
Your 
providence 
and 
strengthened by Your common grace to 
fulfill Your purposes for this Nation. 
Through 
Jesus 
Christ 
our 
Lord. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, March 29, 2022. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable ALEX PADILLA, a Sen-
ator from the State of California, to perform 
the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. PADILLA thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would 
like to just begin by acknowledging 
and thanking Pastor Bob Thune for his 
opening prayer this morning. 
It should come as no surprise, based 
on the last name, we are related. He is 
my 
nephew. 
I 
have 
been 
blessed 
through the years with a rich, spiritual 
heritage, as has he. His father, my big 
brother, was the spiritual trailblazer in 
our family. He went on to pastor 
churches in the Midwest, on the West 
Coast for about 50 years. His son Bob, 
my nephew, is carrying on that great 
tradition. 
Bob pastors a church, as was noted, 
called Coram Deo Church in Omaha, 
NE. Coram Deo is Latin for ‘‘the pres-
ence of God.’’ Bob, on a weekly basis, 
proclaims the truth of the gospel from 
the pulpit. But on a daily basis, he and 
his congregation have, at the center of 
their daily lives, the presence of God as 
they seek to have an impact on their 
community and their region and on 
this world. 
Bob is, in many respects, as it says in 
the Book of Acts, fulfilling God’s pur-
pose for his generation. I am grateful 
for the spiritual heritage that we 
share, for the way that he continues 
that today. I want to encourage him in 
his work and just acknowledge how 
grateful we are that he was able to join 
us here in the U.S. Senate and offer 
that opening prayer which, on a daily 
basis, is offered by our Chaplain, Barry 
Black, who has been a great inspiration 
to me on so many levels and leads us in 
a weekly Bible study here on Capitol 
Hill for Senators. 
I always try and do an advertisement 
to get more Senators to come to that 
Bible study. It is a rich time where we 
can have an opportunity to reflect on 
the important work that we do and the 
way that our faith applies to it on a 
daily basis. 
I yield the floor.

Nani 
A. 
Coloretti, of California, to be Deputy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1812 
March 29, 2022 
second budget of his administration, a 
strong, forward-looking, and optimistic 
vision of our country’s potential. It is 
a budget calling for greater invest-
ments in the things that make the big-
gest difference in the lives of middle- 
class families and in those working to 
get to the middle class: more support 
for our schools, increased funding for 
childcare 
and 
healthcare 
services, 
strong investments in clean energy and 
climate change mitigation, support for 
our farmers and small businesses, as 
well as relief for our strained supply 
chains. 
The Republican leader asserted yes-
terday that the President’s budget is 
‘‘fundamentally 
disconnected’’ 
from 
what America needs right now. This 
begs the question: Just how does the 
Republican leader think the recovery 
of the past 12 months came to pass? 
We have seen the greatest jobs recov-
ery in history, the strongest economic 
surge in 40 years, and a steady return 
to normal after the worst health crisis 
of modern times. Does he think it hap-
pened by magic? Of course not. These 
were the results of the right leadership 
pursuing the right policies at the right 
moment in our country: robust invest-
ments in vaccines, aid for families try-
ing to feed their kids through a crisis, 
help for businesses and local commu-
nities struggling to stay open. 
And as our recovery continues under 
President Biden, Republicans seem to 
think the right answer is to short-
change the American people and cut off 
vital resources that help our country 
grow. 
Republicans can’t stand the thought 
of asking the ultrarich to pay their fair 
share, and as a result, efforts to 
strengthen the middle class, which 
would be paid for by taxes on those at 
the very top, are anathema to them. 
Keeping the wealthy wealthy is more 
important 
for 
Republicans 
than 
strengthening the middle class. 
Republicans, indeed, seem to think it 
is ‘‘fundamentally disconnected’’ to in-
crease investments in things like pub-
lic education, Pell grants, title 1, 
which helps kids most at need. Repub-
licans believe it is somehow wasteful 
or far left to dare help families afford 
childcare and pre-K, which never have 
been pricier than they are today. 
And beholden as they are to cor-
porate polluters, Republicans seem to 
think it is radical for the Federal Gov-
ernment to dedicate resources to a 
clean energy future: more renewables, 
more clean cars right here from Amer-
ica, and a more prosperous planet for 
our kids and our grandkids. 
But, of course, Republicans think it 
is perfectly fine to try and rip away 
healthcare for millions of Americans 
and push trillion-dollar tax cuts that 
overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, 
but helping the middle class with 
childcare and education and healthcare 
is a bridge too far for our Republican 
friends—sad. 
For all these reasons, the contrast 
between President Biden’s budget and 
the vision we are seeing coming from 
Republicans is stark and glaring. One 
budget, ours, is for the working and 
middle class; the other, the Republican 
budget, is an offering entirely for the 
ultrawealthy. 
NOMINATION OF LISA DENELL COOK 
Mr. President, now on the Cook nom-
ination, today the Senate will continue 
its 
work 
of 
advancing 
President 
Biden’s well-qualified nominees. Last 
night, I filed cloture on five additional 
nominees, and this morning the Senate 
will vote on a motion to discharge Ms. 
Lisa Cook from the Banking Com-
mittee. As a reminder, a motion to dis-
charge is necessary in this Congress 
whenever a nominee receives a dead-
locked vote in committee, so the steps 
we are taking later today are exceed-
ingly important, but, frankly, it is un-
fortunate that they are necessary at 
all. 
Not very long ago, a nominee of Ms. 
Cook’s qualifications would have sailed 
toward final confirmation with bipar-
tisan support. She serves on the advi-
sory board of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Chicago and is a professor of Eco-
nomics at Michigan State. Coming 
from humble beginnings in rural Geor-
gia, where her family fought back 
against racial segregation, she would 
be the first Black woman ever to sit on 
the Federal Reserve Board of Gov-
ernors. She is truly historic, in addi-
tion to being deeply qualified. 
For as much as Republicans talk 
about inflation, it is bewildering and 
totally discrediting for them to reflex-
ively oppose a qualified nominee like 
Ms. Cook, precisely tasked with help-
ing the Fed hold down costs and main-
tain strong employment. Nevertheless, 
we will move forward with her nomina-
tion today with a motion to discharge. 
The bottom line is this: The Fed is not 
a political institution. Ms. Cook’s posi-
tion is not a political role. And for Re-
publicans to obstruct her nomination 
purely for political purposes is deeply 
troubling and hurts our efforts to lower 
costs for American families. 
AMERICA COMPETES ACT OF 2022 
Mr. President, and now on the com-
petitiveness 
legislation, 
last 
night, 
with a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to 
28, the Senate passed an amended 
version of the House jobs and competi-
tiveness legislation. It was amended 
and passed, to be clear, with the same 
language the Senate approved last 
summer when we approved USICA, the 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. 
This bill now heads to the House, and 
I am optimistic that the House will be 
able to act on a motion requesting a 
conference committee very soon. It re-
mains our goal to initiate a conference 
committee by the end of this work pe-
riod. 
Once again, I want to thank all of my 
colleagues for their good-faith work on 
this bill. This is the culmination of 
years of work on both sides of the aisle. 
Senator YOUNG and I began work on 
the Endless Frontier Act in 2019. There 
is more work to be done, but we, never-
theless, took an important step last 
night toward our goal of enacting this 
legislation into law. 
And in doing so, I believe that this 
bill will go down as one of the most im-
portant steps Congress can take toward 
creating more jobs, fixing our supply 
chains, and refueling another genera-
tion of American ingenuity that will 
strengthen our economy for a long, 
long time. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, on COVID, I am con-
tinuing to hold negotiations with my 
Republican colleagues on much needed 
COVID public health response funding. 
Even though cases and deaths and hos-
pitalizations are, thankfully, down and 
falling across the board, it is still nec-
essary and a matter of great urgency 
that we replenish funding for more vac-
cines, more therapeutics, more testing, 
and for new vaccines to meet the chal-
lenge of any new variant. The sooner 
we have these in place when, God for-
bid, a new variant hits, the healthier 
we will stay, the more life will stay 
normal. To deny it now, and then 3 
months from now or 6 months from 
now, or whenever, be unprepared and 
let it spread unchecked until the 
COVID variant’s tentacles are too deep 
in our society, makes no sense whatso-
ever. 
But to pass more COVID public 
health response funding, we need bipar-
tisan cooperation. It is a responsibility 
of both Republicans and Democrats to 
make sure we have the tools and re-
sources in place that will keep the 
virus down, keep our schools, keep our 
communities open. 
We are not there yet on reaching an 
agreement, but we are going to keep 
working in good faith to get there. I 
hope we can reach an agreement with 
our Republican colleagues very soon 
because nobody wants to find them-
selves in a situation where cases sud-
denly start rising again, and we aren’t 
ready to respond quickly. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
Democrats’ massive inflation is an in-
escapable, painful, daily reality for 
working families. These policy failures 
have hammered my home State of Ken-
tucky. Last year, even as many Ken-
tuckians earned raises, prices sky-
rocketed faster. Used car prices shot up 
40 percent in the Commonwealth last 
year. In Louisville, the gas to drive 
those cars costs more than a dollar 
more per gallon today than a year ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1813 
March 29, 2022 
In typical Bluegrass fashion, neigh-
bors are helping one another as best 
they can. According to the owner of 
Parkette Drive-In in Lexington, even 
as prices for ingredients like chicken 
have nearly doubled, he has chosen to 
cut back as much as possible on his end 
to avoid raising prices for customers. 
But as hard as Kentuckians try, 
Democrats’ reckless policies are com-
ing home to roost. As one father of four 
who lost his job following the dev-
astating Mayfield tornado in December 
put it, ‘‘there’s no stretching money at 
this point.’’ 
An outright majority of Americans 
say inflation is not at all under con-
trol. Seven in 10 say our economy is in 
bad shape, and by all accounts, they 
know exactly whom to blame for a year 
of painful challenges. 
Sixty-three percent of Americans, 
nearly two-thirds, say they disapprove 
of how President Biden is handling the 
economy, and that number just keeps 
rising. 
But Washington Democrats do not 
appear to have gotten the message. The 
Biden administration’s new budget pro-
posal leans even further into the poli-
cies that got us here in the first place. 
Even as President Biden has already 
presided over soaring prices for gas and 
home heating fuels, he wants massive 
new tax hikes on American-made fossil 
fuels. He wants to skyrocket discre-
tionary domestic spending on a whole 
catalog of liberal wish-list items, and 
he wants to compound the pain on our 
economy by slapping the biggest tax 
hikes in American history right on top 
of all of it. 
So the past year has taught us how 
painful Washington Democrats’ poli-
cies can be for hard-working Ameri-
cans. The administration needs to stop 
trying to dig this hole any deeper. 
FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. President, now, on another mat-
ter, runaway inflation and historic tax 
hikes aren’t the only signs that Presi-
dent Biden’s budget was crafted in 
fantasyland. And, amazingly, yester-
day, even as the Biden administration 
was proposing the biggest tax hikes in 
American history, that wasn’t even the 
biggest problem of the day. 
Most of President Biden’s press con-
ference yesterday focused on seemingly 
major inconsistencies between his pub-
lic remarks on foreign policy and the 
actual policy of his administration. A 
few days ago, President Biden seemed 
to dramatically change American pol-
icy toward Putin’s regime during a 
major 
international 
speech 
before 
White House staff walked back his 
comment. Yesterday, the President 
suggested he was just sharing his per-
sonal moral view, not speaking in his 
policymaking capacity. 
We are talking about the Commander 
in Chief here. 
Another time recently, the President 
seemed to suggest that if Russia vio-
lated international law and used chem-
ical weapons in Ukraine, the United 
States would respond ‘‘in kind.’’ Again, 
his staff had to quickly explain what 
the administration actually meant. 
The United States does not maintain 
a chemical weapons stockpile for use. 
To the contrary, we are working hard 
to safely dispose of many decades-old 
munitions. 
I know a lot about that. Throughout 
my career in Washington, I have 
worked to ensure the stockpile of 
chemical munitions at the Blue Grass 
Army Depot in my State are safely but 
surely disposed of. 
But the head-scratching gaffes don’t 
stop there. After spending weeks gratu-
itously listing all the things America 
would not do, such as deploy troops 
into Ukraine, President Biden in Po-
land seemed to tell American troops 
they would soon be seeing the bravery 
of Ukraine’s resistance firsthand in 
person. 
Again, 
the 
White 
House 
claimed the President was not actually 
changing policy. 
The troubling inconsistencies go be-
yond isolated gaffes. The confusion ap-
pears to run deeper. For months, White 
House officials repeatedly insisted the 
President and his administration were 
focused on deterring Russian esca-
lation against Ukraine. They repeat-
edly stressed how the threat of sanc-
tions 
would 
serve 
as 
a 
deterrent 
against further invasion. 
But last week, with the world watch-
ing, 
President 
Biden 
shockingly 
claimed he never thought or intended 
that sanctions would actually deter 
Putin. This leaves unanswered the 
question of what he thought they 
would achieve. 
The wild swings between the admin-
istration’s 
overly 
cautious, 
almost 
skittish official posture and the Presi-
dent’s emotional freelancing is becom-
ing dizzying. 
As NATO allies scrambled to help 
Ukraine fight back, the President re-
fused to authorize a transfer of fighter 
jets. The administration strangely and 
unjustifiable felt if we merely facili-
tated—facilitated—such a transfer, it 
could be too provocative. But we are 
supposed to brush it off when the same 
President seems to actually call for re-
gime change in Russia? Facilitating 
the transfer of some old fighter jets is 
too provocative, but remarks like that 
are just speaking from the heart? 
Sadly, mixed messages and confusion 
have been one of the only consistent 
threads running through this adminis-
tration’s foreign policy from the very 
start. The White House chafed against 
clear warnings from its own military 
advisers about how quickly Afghani-
stan could fall after U.S. withdrawal. 
They stood by the President’s assertion 
that ‘‘there’s going to be no cir-
cumstance where you see people being 
lifted off the roof of an embassy of the 
United States,’’ until that exact scene 
happened in Kabul. 
With respect to both the Taliban and 
Putin, the administration has said re-
peatedly they think that the fear of be-
coming international pariahs will actu-
ally constrain their actions—as if these 
regimes cared a lick about global PR. 
At the risk of repeating what I and 
many others have said for years, des-
pots can’t be shamed into conforming 
to polite international society. You 
can’t check lawless violence with fin-
ger wagging. 
We know what deters aggression: 
American strength and American clar-
ity. That is what deters aggression. 
I have just explained how American 
clarity has been in too-short supply. 
But, unfortunately, the Biden adminis-
tration also seems unwilling to plan 
and invest in long-term American 
strength. 
Even 
under 
the 
administration’s 
wildly—wildly—optimistic projections 
about inflation, their budget proposal 
would only flat-fund our Armed Forces. 
In the best case scenario, they want 
American defense to just tread water, 
nowhere near the robust real growth 
that bipartisan experts say we need to 
modernize and keep pace with both 
Russia and China. 
And in the more likely event that 
Democrats don’t magically have infla-
tion plummeting in just a few months, 
then President Biden’s policy would 
amount to an actual cut—cut—to our 
defense spending, ramping down Amer-
ican military funding while China 
ramps theirs up. 
China is building for the battlefield 
of the future. Iran continues funding 
terrorists and plowing forward with nu-
clear development. Russian aggression 
is actively challenging our capacity to 
keep ourselves and our partners armed. 
And the Biden administration sees 
this as a moment to ease off the gas? 
That could not be more mistaken. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
week’s Judiciary Committee hearing 
gave Senators the opportunity to hear 
directly from President Biden’s nomi-
nee to the Supreme Court, Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson, to help them 
decide whether she is an appropriate 
candidate for the Nation’s highest 
Court. 
My approach to deciding whether or 
not to vote for a Supreme Court nomi-
nee or any judicial nominee is pretty 
simple. I look at the character and 
qualifications, and most of all, I look 
at the question of whether the nominee 
understands the limited role of the ju-
diciary and the separation of powers. 
Our Federal Government, of course, 
has three distinct branches: the legisla-
tive branch, which makes the laws; the 
executive branch—the President and 
executive 
Departments—which 
exe-
cutes the laws; and the judiciary,

which interprets the laws. Pretty sim-
ple, right? Civics 101. Too often, how-
ever, our colleagues on the left look to 
the judiciary to usurp the role of the 
legislative branch. They look for activ-
ist judges who will not just interpret 
the law but who will go beyond the law 
to deliver the policy outcomes that lib-
erals are interested in, whether that is 
an aggressive abortion agenda, re-
straint of the free exercise of religion, 
or liberals’ preferred approach to im-
migration. 
President Biden, for example, specifi-
cally noted that he would only appoint 
judges who could be relied on to rule in 
favor of Roe v. Wade and a right to 
abortion. Well, that is a big problem 
because delivering specific political 
outcomes is not the job of the judicial 
branch. In our system of government, 
policy decisions are vested in the legis-
lative branch and are made there by 
the people’s democratically elected 
representatives. Judges have discretion 
in applying the laws, but their discre-
tion is to be guided by the plain text of 
the law and by the intention of the 
people’s representatives in drafting the 
statute. Otherwise, we end up not with 
government of the people but with gov-
ernment by an unelected, unaccount-
able group of judges. 
President Biden has unfortunately 
placed himself squarely in the camp of 
those who would like to see the judici-
ary take an active role in making pol-
icy. ‘‘The people that I would appoint 
to the Court,’’ President Biden said 
during his campaign for President, 
‘‘are people who have a view of the 
Constitution as a living document, not 
as a staid document.’’ 
Well, let me just talk about that for 
a minute. What is a Constitution if not 
a staid document? If there is no fixed 
meaning to the Constitution, if it can 
be stretched and adjusted and expanded 
by judges at their discretion, then why 
have a Constitution? The whole point 
of the Constitution—of written law in 
general, I would argue—is that it is 
fixed, ‘‘staid,’’ to quote the President. 
The rule of law, equal justice under the 
law—these concepts rely on the idea 
that the law has a fixed meaning, that 
there is one law that applies equally to 
everyone. 
If the Constitution does not have a 
fixed meaning, it cannot be the su-
preme law of the land. It cannot be a 
guide to which we can all appeal. A liv-
ing Constitution is a meaningless one. 
Of course that doesn’t mean that the 
Constitution will always stay exactly 
the same. There is a process, as we all 
know, for amending the Constitution 
so that needed changes can be made. 
But these changes have to be made 
through the amendment process, with 
the concurrence of three-fourths of the 
States. 
That is not what the President is 
talking about. When the President 
talks about a living Constitution, he is 
not talking about periodically amend-
ing the Constitution via the process 
laid out within the Constitution itself; 
what he is talking about is nominating 
judges who will take it upon them-
selves 
to 
amend 
the 
Constitution 
through their rulings by finding new 
rights and authorities as needed to ad-
vance a particular political agenda. 
That is deeply concerning, particularly 
when we are talking about a lifetime 
appointment to the highest Court in 
the land. 
Unfortunately, after watching last 
week’s Judiciary Committee hearing 
and examining Judge Jackson’s record, 
I am concerned that her jurisprudence 
reflects President Biden’s belief in an 
activist judiciary. 
As has become clear, Judge Jackson 
has a strong point of view when it 
comes to sentencing guidelines in cer-
tain cases. That is not in and of itself 
a problem, of course. Judges can and do 
have strong opinions about any number 
of issues that come up in the law. What 
is a problem is it seems that Judge 
Jackson has allowed her personal opin-
ions to shape her judicial decisions. 
For example, as a Federal trial judge, 
she repeatedly chose to reject sen-
tencing 
guidelines 
and 
the 
rec-
ommendations of prosecutors in favor 
of lenient sentences for those who pos-
sess and distribute child pornography. 
It appears that she had a record of ad-
vocating for leniency with respect to 
these types of crimes during her time 
at the U.S. Sentencing Commission and 
that she then applied those opinions to 
her sentencing practices when she be-
came a Federal judge. 
For this reason and more, I am deep-
ly concerned that her record suggests 
that she would allow her personal opin-
ions on issues like sentencing to shape 
her decisions on the Supreme Court. A 
Supreme Court Justice’s allegiance 
must be to the plain words of the law 
and the Constitution, not to any per-
sonal political opinion, and I am not 
convinced that Judge Jackson meets 
that standard. 
My concern has only been heightened 
by Judge Jackson’s inability or refusal 
to define her judicial philosophy. It 
should not be difficult for a nominee to 
the Supreme Court to lay out her the-
ory of constitutional interpretation. 
Given how often her strong personal 
opinions have appeared to influence 
her decisions as a judge and absent a 
clearly expressed judicial philosophy 
that rejects personal opinion in favor 
of the plain meaning of the law and the 
Constitution, I am concerned that her 
judicial approach would follow the 
‘‘living 
Constitution’’ 
model 
that 
President Biden embraces. 
Finally, I was deeply concerned by 
Judge Jackson’s refusal to reject Court 
packing. Court packing, of course, is a 
long-discredited idea that has been re-
vived by members of the far left and in-
creasingly embraced by the Demo-
cratic Party. The idea behind it is sim-
ple. If the Supreme Court isn’t deliv-
ering the decisions you want, expand 
the number of Justices until you can 
be pretty sure you will get your pre-
ferred outcomes. 
The problems with this approach are 
obvious, starting with the question, 
where does it end? It is easy to envi-
sion a Democrat-led Congress packing 
the Court with additional Democrat-se-
lected Justices and then a Republican- 
led Congress coming in and matching 
those new Justices with additional Re-
publican-appointed Justices and on and 
on and on. Pretty soon, the size of the 
Supreme Court would be approaching 
the size of the U.S. Senate. I can think 
of no approach more guaranteed to 
bring 
about 
a 
complete 
delegitimization of the Supreme Court. 
Do Democrats seriously think that 
there 
is 
any—any—American 
who 
would regard the Supreme Court as a 
nonpartisan institution after it had 
been packed full of Democrat Justices 
or, if it were Republicans who were ad-
vancing this Court-packing plan, with 
Republican Justices? Court packing 
would instantly turn the Supreme 
Court into nothing more than a par-
tisan 
extension 
of 
the 
legislative 
branch, which is why it is so con-
cerning that Judge Jackson has repeat-
edly—repeatedly—declined to oppose 
it. 
Both Justice Ginsburg and Justice 
Breyer spoke out against Court pack-
ing during their time on the Supreme 
Court, so this is a subject on which 
Judge Jackson can and should have felt 
free to speak. That she did not do so 
only underscored my concern that she 
is too open to allowing politics to 
shape the judiciary. 
I enjoyed meeting with Judge Jack-
son, and I respect her achievements, 
but I cannot in good conscience vote 
for a Supreme Court Justice whose 
record indicates that she will allow her 
personal political opinions to shape her 
judicial decisions. 
The rule of law depends upon having 
Justices who decide cases based on the 
plain meaning of the law and the Con-
stitution, not on personal beliefs or po-
litical considerations. 
I can only vote to confirm a Justice 
who I believe will respect the separa-
tion of powers and the limited role of a 
Justice and refuse to allow her per-
sonal opinions to influence her deci-
sions on the Bench. 
For these reasons, I cannot support 
Judge Jackson’s confirmation to the 
Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1815 
March 29, 2022 
At stake with Professor Cook’s nomi-
nation is really how the Fed will re-
spond to one of the most pressing chal-
lenges facing Pennsylvania and the Na-
tion. 
Earlier this month, we learned that 
inflation hit a four-decade high of al-
most 
8 
percent. 
Prices 
are 
sky-
rocketing for just about everything: 
gasoline, food, rent. The amount of 
money Americans have to pay for basic 
goods and services that they need 
every week are going up, and they are 
going up much faster than their wages. 
That means working Americans are 
falling further and further behind. 
Under the guise of fighting this infla-
tion, my colleagues across the aisle on 
the Senate Banking Committee have 
urged the swift confirmation of Presi-
dent Biden’s slate of nominees to the 
Federal Reserve Board. The chairman 
of the committee said that President 
Biden’s nominees are ‘‘ready to get to 
work fighting inflation.’’ And yet we 
could have confirmed nominees many 
weeks ago. 
We still haven’t voted on two of the 
nominees who have unanimous Repub-
lican 
support 
and 
near-unanimous 
Democratic support, which makes you 
wonder about our colleagues’ commit-
ment to this urgency. Maybe it is be-
cause our Democratic colleagues know 
that even if we don’t confirm these 
nominees, the Fed has 9 out of 12 vot-
ing members on the FOMC in place. 
That is more than enough to raise 
rates if they decide they should raise 
rates to fight inflation. 
How do we know for sure that that is 
more than enough? Well, at their last 
meeting just 2 weeks ago, the Fed did, 
in fact, raise interest rates. So it was 
never the case that the Fed is somehow 
unable to fight inflation until the 
nominees are confirmed. 
What we really should be asking our-
selves is, Are these nominees going to 
be the inflation fighters that we need 
that the White House claims they are? 
In my view, one of these nominees in 
particular, Professor Lisa Cook, dra-
matically fails this test. 
First of all, Professor Cook has near-
ly zero experience in monetary policy. 
Now, she does have a Ph.D. in econom-
ics, but not a single one of her publica-
tions concerns monetary economics. 
The White House cites as her main 
qualification on U.S. monetary policy 
her appointment as a Chicago Fed di-
rector. That appointment was made in 
January of this year, 2 weeks before 
President Biden announced Professor 
Cook’s nomination to be a Fed Gov-
ernor. 
And Professor Cook made very clear 
in her conversation with me that she 
had not participated in any policy or 
decisionmaking so far in her term at 
the Chicago Fed. In fact, she described 
her role as limited to ‘‘filling out pa-
perwork’’—that is her quote—for her 
new position, which is understandable. 
She had been there for 2 weeks before 
she was nominated to the Fed gover-
norship. So that appointment to the re-
gional Fed certainly doesn’t count as a 
qualification to serve as a main Fed 
Governor. 
Professor Cook herself has acknowl-
edged that her academic work on mon-
etary issues is, let’s say, sparse. When 
asked to list her top few works on mon-
etary policy for the Banking Com-
mittee, she provided only one, and that 
was a book chapter about Nigerian 
bank reforms in 2005. 
What is even more troubling is that 
in addition to having no monetary pol-
icy experience, Professor Cook also ap-
pears to have no opinion at all on how 
the Fed should address inflation. 
Professor Cook repeatedly refused to 
endorse the Fed’s decision to pull back 
its ultraeasy monetary policy and only 
did begrudgingly say that she agreed 
with the ‘‘Fed’s path right now as we 
are speaking’’—that is a quote—at her 
nomination hearing in February. Prior 
to that, she couldn’t bring herself to 
acknowledge that maybe it was time 
for the Fed to change the policy that 
had contributed to the worst inflation 
that we have seen in 40 years. 
Professor Cook’s answers to basic 
questions about what tools the Fed 
should use and how should the Fed con-
sider using them in order to get infla-
tion under control, her answer was 
nothing more than an incomprehen-
sible word salad. 
Professor Cook has continued to in-
sist that she would need to be con-
firmed to the Fed before she can have 
a view on inflation because, in her own 
words, ‘‘We don’t have access to all the 
data that the Fed has,’’ and also, ‘‘We 
don’t have access to . . . the delibera-
tions at the time they are being 
made.’’ 
These statements are bewildering 
coming from someone who has been 
nominated to address the most press-
ing inflationary threat in nearly two 
generations. To be clear, the Fed has 
no secret data, as Professor Cook 
seems to believe. In fact, monetary pol-
icy, including the recent 41-percent in-
crease in the money supply, is ex-
tremely transparent. And if Professor 
Cook is counting on Fed economists to 
guide her in making a prediction about 
inflation, then, first of all, they have 
been wrong on inflation consistently, 
very wrong; and, secondly, what is she 
going to do on the Fed and what is her 
role there if all she is going to do is 
take instruction from the Fed staff? 
Look, just about every economist in 
the country has an opinion about infla-
tion right now because the data is all 
readily apparent and extremely dis-
turbing. Every other nominee to the 
Federal Reserve has an opinion about 
inflation, and certainly, every Penn-
sylvanian I talk to has strongly held 
views about inflation. 
Professor Cook’s claim made at her 
nomination hearing just last month 
that ‘‘We have to be patient with the 
data’’—and the data she was referring 
to was rising consumer prices—that 
certainly suggests, what is to me, an 
unacceptable toleration for the infla-
tion that is ravaging American con-
sumers. 
That brings me to my second point, 
and that is Professor Cook’s history of 
extreme leftwing political advocacy 
and hostility to opposing viewpoints, 
the combination which I think makes 
her unfit to serve on the Fed. As I have 
said many times, it is extremely im-
portant that we keep politics out of the 
money supply. The Fed is supposed to 
be independent. The Fed is supposed to 
be apolitical so that it can focus on its 
job. But unfortunately, we have seen 
the encroachment of politics at the his-
torically independent Federal Reserve, 
and we have seen that the Fed is not 
doing such a great job. 
There are people on the left, includ-
ing in the Biden administration, who 
openly advocate that the Fed use its 
regulatory powers to address complex 
political issues, including things like 
what to do about global warming, so-
cial justice, even education policy. 
Look, these are all very, very impor-
tant issues—very important issues— 
but they are completely unrelated to 
the Fed’s limited statutory mandate 
and expertise. 
Professor Cook’s record indicates 
that these are the topics that interest 
her the most, and she is likely to inject 
further political bias into the Fed’s 
work at a time, exactly the time, when 
we need the Fed to be hyperfocused on 
getting inflation back under control. 
We discovered that Professor Cook 
sent out, in recent years, over 30,000 
public tweets and retweets—30,000. In-
cluded among them, she supports race- 
based reparations; she has promoted 
conspiracies 
about 
Georgia 
voting 
laws; she sought to cancel those who 
disagree with her views, such as she 
publicly called for a colleague of hers 
to be fired because he dared to tweet 
that he was opposed to defunding the 
police of Chicago. 
After Banking Committee Repub-
lican staff highlighted these tweets and 
brought them to public attention, Pro-
fessor Cook blocked the Banking Com-
mittee Republican Twitter account 1 
day before her nomination hearing. 
Apparently, Professor Cook not only 
realizes how inflammatory her own 
tweets are but also has pretty little re-
gard for the Senate’s constitutional re-
sponsibility to vet her public state-
ments. 
See, the Fed is already suffering from 
a credibility problem because of its in-
volvement in politics, its departure 
from its statutorily prescribed limited 
role, and, frankly, the not-very-good 
job it has done in keeping inflation 
under control. 
I am concerned that Professor Cook 
will further politicize an institution 
that must get back to being apolitical, 
so I urge my colleagues to vote against 
the motion to discharge Professor 
Cook. 
I yield the floor.

March 29, 2022 
vote at 11:45, I be permitted to speak 
for 15 minutes and Senator SHERROD 
BROWN be permitted to speak for 2 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
week, the Senate Judiciary Committee 
was busy. We met for over 30 hours to 
consider 
the 
nomination 
of 
Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill a va-
cancy on the Supreme Court. 
During the meeting of the com-
mittee, hundreds of questions were 
posed to Judge Jackson. She spoke 
thoughtfully and at length about her 
years in public service, and, most im-
portantly, she really imparted to the 
committee—and to America that has 
watched—what she thought about this 
great Nation, her pride in being an 
American, 
the 
opportunities 
which 
were given to her, and opportunities 
which she used to make this a better 
place for many. 
I was one of the millions who came 
away from last week’s hearing deeply 
impressed 
with 
Judge 
Jackson. 
It 
proved to me during the course of her 
testimony that the words over the 
steps of the Supreme Court, ‘‘Equal 
Justice Under Law,’’ are a personal 
challenge and an invitation to a person 
just like Judge Jackson. 
But it appears some of our Repub-
lican colleagues are more reluctant to 
support her at this moment. She is still 
making the rounds. Over 50 Senators 
have received personal visits, and even 
more will during the course of this 
week. They have reservations, and I 
have spoken to some of them and lis-
tened to their statements. They say 
that they don’t have any question 
about her qualifications or experience. 
Well, thank goodness. She has a stellar 
resume. Anyone who is a lawyer in this 
Nation would look at her with envy to 
think what she has achieved against 
the odds in her life. 
Unfortunately, some of the members 
of the committee misrepresented her 
record on several issues. I would like to 
try to set it straight at this moment. 
There seems to be this passion 
amongst some Republicans to get this 
nominee to state in a word or two her 
judicial philosophy. I find that inter-
esting. If a person came up to one of 
my colleagues and said, ‘‘What is your 
political philosophy?’’ there are a num-
ber of things a person might say. They 
might say, for example, ‘‘I am a fiscal 
conservative.’’ 
You might then ask, ‘‘Well, then why 
did you vote for the Trump tax cuts 
that gave tax breaks to the wealthiest 
Americans and added almost $2 trillion 
to the national debt? And if you are a 
fiscal conservative, why is it that you 
only preach for a balanced budget 
amendment when there is a Democrat 
in the White House and never when 
there is a Republican?’’ 
Basically what you are saying is, ‘‘I 
can hear you and your declaration, but 
I want to know what you have done.’’ 
When it comes to Judge Jackson, 
those who seek her judicial philosophy 
and want a simple label one way or the 
other just haven’t done their home-
work. She has almost 600 published 
opinions. This woman, this jurist, has 
not held back in explaining, in case 
after case, how she views the law. It is 
there for the reading. Every Member of 
the Senate and the public has access to 
that information to get the true meas-
ure of a judicial philosophy. 
What she said over and over again at 
the hearing was, I believe in judicial 
restraint. I think that is exactly what 
we need in a judge, personally. That is 
exactly what you will find when you 
review the hundreds of opinions she has 
written to date. 
Then there is this litmus test ques-
tion that meant so much to Senator 
MCCONNELL, the Republican leader in 
the Senate, that he led off his opposi-
tion to Judge Jackson on the issue. 
And the issue, quite simply, is whether 
or not Judge Jackson is willing to say 
what her position is on increasing the 
number of Justices serving on the Su-
preme Court—interesting question. 
Most Americans think it has been 
nine for all time, but that is not true. 
I believe it was in 1869 that that num-
ber was established. Before then, it was 
a fewer number of Justices. It hasn’t 
been changed since. There is specula-
tion among some political quarters 
that people are thinking about chang-
ing it in the future. 
So when it came to Senator MCCON-
NELL’s opposition to Judge Jackson be-
cause she said it is a policy matter to 
be decided by Congress, not to be de-
cided by the Court, as to the composi-
tion and number on the Supreme 
Court, Senator MCCONNELL went on to 
say that that disqualified her; that was 
the leading disqualification. 
Well, you might ask Senator MCCON-
NELL: How did the previous nominee, 
Amy Coney Barrett—you went to great 
lengths in maintaining a vacancy on 
the Court so that a Republican judge 
could fill the vacancy—how did she an-
swer this probing threshold question 
when it came to the future composition 
of the Supreme Court? 
She 
said 
virtually 
exactly 
what 
Judge Jackson said: It is a matter for 
Congress to decide, not for the courts. 
That was an acceptable answer with 
Amy Coney Barrett, but for Senator 
MCCONNELL, it is an unacceptable an-
swer when it comes to Judge Jackson. 
The other questions that were raised 
were about her legal representation. 
Those of us who have practiced law un-
derstand that you don’t necessarily 
agree with the legal position of every 
client who walks in the office, and 
sometimes you have no choice. If the 
court appoints you as a defender or as 
an attorney to represent someone who 
is an indigent client, you often have a 
client before you—not necessarily a sa-
vory character—who might have some 
questionable background. Your job is 
to be a zealous advocate for that client 
but never to lie to the court, stick with 
the truth, do your best, and represent 
them in the course of litigation. 
That is what Judge Jackson has done 
in her private practice and her years 
working for the Federal public de-
fender. Most attorneys get it. Most of 
them understand that the client you 
are representing is not necessarily es-
pousing your point of view, nor, really, 
boasting a lifestyle that you admire, 
but you have a professional obligation 
to do your best as a lawyer to represent 
them before the court of law. 
Some of them were opposed to Judge 
Jackson because she represented de-
tainees at Guantanamo Bay. That is 
curious because these same lawmakers 
once claimed that judicial nominees 
should not be held accountable for the 
views and actions of their clients. 
It was the junior Senator from Mis-
souri who not that long ago argued 
that litigators ‘‘do not necessarily 
share the views of the people [they rep-
resent]’’ but must ‘‘represent them ef-
fectively and fairly.’’ He was right 
then, and he ought to remember it 
now. 
Consider the words of the junior Sen-
ator from Texas, who told us in Sep-
tember of 2019: 
Saying that the views of your clients or 
the positions of your clients are necessarily 
your own personal views is no more accurate 
than saying a criminal defense lawyer who 
represents capital defendants is advancing 
the cause of murder. 
That is the quote from the junior 
Senator from Texas. 
Finally, some of our Republican col-
leagues have accused Judge Jackson of 
being soft on crime. We had an inter-
esting panel the last day when we con-
sidered the judge, and on that panel 
was a gentleman who is the president 
of the Black law enforcement organiza-
tion known as NOBLE. 
I asked him point blank: We know 
the Fraternal Order of Police has en-
dorsed Judge Jackson’s aspiration to 
the Court. We know that the Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Police 
also endorsed her. You, NOBLE, rep-
resenting 
Black 
law 
enforcement 
agents across the Nation, have en-
dorsed her. Would you or any of these 
organizations have even considered the 
endorsement if you thought she was 
soft on crime or wanted to defund the 
police? He was unequivocal. No, he 
wouldn’t have considered her. But her 
critics ignore that reality. 
I want to make it clear that any Sen-
ator considering her nomination has 
the right to make their own choice in 
this process. They can also look beyond 
the fact that she comes from a law en-
forcement family to her actual deci-
sionmaking and sentencing. But to 
claim, as a few have—only a few—that 
somehow Judge Jackson was soft when 
it came to child predators or endan-
gering children is just inaccurate and, 
frankly, insulting. 
Look at the facts. Judge Jackson is 
well within the judicial mainstream of 
70 to 80 percent of sentences by Federal 
judges when it comes to child pornog-
raphy offenders—not out of the main-
stream, in it—and she has put many

behind bars for decades. Her approach 
to these cases is comparable to that of 
many of President Trump’s nominees 
on the bench today. 
Independent fact checkers have ex-
posed these baseless attacks for what 
they are. I can’t say it any better than 
the conservative Federal prosecutor 
who wrote in a conservative magazine, 
the National Review, that this line of 
attack 
against 
Judge 
Jackson 
is 
‘‘meritless to the point of dema-
goguery.’’ 
Let’s 
be 
clear. 
None—absolutely 
none—of the attacks that have been 
leveled against Judge Jackson stand up 
to scrutiny. I assume that is why only 
a few of my Republican colleagues have 
spoken out in support of them. 
So I want to thank the majority of 
Republican Judiciary Committee mem-
bers who treated last week’s hearing 
with dignity and respect. They posed 
challenging, 
probing 
questions 
to 
Judge Jackson, and that was their re-
sponsibility to do so. Judge Jackson’s 
forthright responses showed the Amer-
ican public why she deserves this his-
toric opportunity. 
She is a brilliant jurist, evenhanded, 
with a model temperament. There were 
so many moments—for those who fol-
lowed the hearing, they know what I 
am speaking of—when I looked up and 
saw her sitting at the table, thinking 
that she could stand up at this very 
moment and say ‘‘Enough. My family 
and I are leaving.’’ But she didn’t. She 
had the strength and the grace and the 
dignity and determination to weather 
even that political firestorm. 
I am honored to support Judge Jack-
son. I look forward to our Judiciary 
Committee vote on her nomination 
next Monday. 
(The remarks of Mr. DURBIN
per-
taining to the introduction of S. 3950 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
NOMINATION OF LISA DENELL COOK 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to 
urge my colleagues to join me in con-
firming Lisa Cook to the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Federal Reserve System. 
Dr. Cook hails from the Presiding Of-
ficer’s home State of Georgia. She grew 
up in Milledgeville, GA, where my 
mother’s 
college 
roommate—during 
World War II, before she moved to 
Washington to be part of the war ef-
fort—was a roommate of my mother 
who is from Mansfield, GA, as the Pre-
siding Officer knows. She roomed with 
someone from Milledgeville, GA. 
Lisa Cook has good smalltown val-
ues, good southern values. She now 
teaches at a great Midwestern State 
university with good midwestern val-
ues. 
She is unquestionably qualified, an 
economist with many years of experi-
ence. She is a graduate of Spelman. 
She was a Truman Scholar in England, 
something that very few Americans 
qualify for. It is a very small, elite, im-
portant program. She then got her 
Ph.D. at Berkeley. 
She brings a breadth of research and 
international experience on monetary 
policy, on banking, and on financial 
crises. In fact, she is one of the coun-
try’s leading researchers on inter-
national economic growth and innova-
tion economics. 
Dr. Cook currently serves as a dual- 
tenured professor of economics and 
international relations at Michigan 
State. She previously taught at the 
Kennedy School of Government. She 
served on the Council of Economic Ad-
visers during the eurozone crisis and at 
the Department of Treasury. 
She is a historic nominee. If con-
firmed, she would be the first Black 
woman ever in the more than 100-year 
history of the Fed. Think about that. 
In 1913, the Federal Reserve began, cre-
ated by this body and the House of 
Representatives, signed by President 
Wilson. So in 109 years, seven Gov-
ernors on the Fed—most stay no more 
than 5 or 6 or 7 years—and she will be 
the first Black woman to ever serve on 
the Federal Reserve. 
I am thrilled about this nomination. 
I am thrilled because of the diversity of 
gender and race but also—maybe espe-
cially—the diversity of experience. She 
knows, in her recognition, that work-
ers should be at the center of our econ-
omy. She knows that workers drive our 
economic growth. She knows how im-
portant local communities are. She 
spent her formative years in the South 
and a significant portion of her career 
in the industrial Midwest. She has seen 
how the economy works and sometimes 
doesn’t work so well for all different 
kinds of people in different parts of the 
country. 
She arrived on campus in East Lan-
sing, MI, a few years before the finan-
cial crisis. She saw its impact on the 
students, the professors, the entire 
community. She takes that with her— 
that experience, that knowledge, that 
insight—to the Federal Reserve. 
That is an unusual thing for a Fed 
Governor. She has made it clear she is 
dedicated to Fed independence. She 
will uphold the Fed’s dual mandate of 
maximum employment and price sta-
bility. 
Her nomination represents another 
example of the Biden administration’s 
serious effort to make the economy 
work for everyone, not just those at 
the top. That is what especially makes 
her an outstanding nominee. 
It is a critical time for the Fed. We 
need Dr. Cook and other qualified 
nominees on the job immediately to 
fight inflation. Dr. Cook is unquestion-
ably qualified. She possesses bipartisan 
support from top economists, former 
Fed Governors, bankers, civil rights or-
ganizations. 
Yet despite her broad support, a 
small but loud minority have wrongly 
claimed that she doesn’t meet the 
standards for this position, standards 
that only seem to apply for certain 
nominees. 
Still, she has met and she has exceed-
ed those high bars. She is a Ph.D. econ-
omist and a tenured professor. She is 
sought by organizations around the 
world for her input, for her knowledge, 
for her wisdom, for her perspective. 
She will bring a critical voice to the 
Fed, one that has been missing for far 
too long. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting Dr. Lisa Cook’s nomination 
and getting her on the Board right 
away to help with our economic recov-
ery. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
to talk about one of the Senate’s fore-
most constitutional duties, the advice 
and consent of executive nominations. 
The most senior nominees, like Cabi-
net Secretaries, go through a floor 
process that normally takes about 4 
days, if you run through all the proce-
dural steps by the book. Other nomi-
nees, typically people with highly spe-
cialized expertise, go through a rig-
orous committee process and are often 
confirmed by unanimous consent. 
Any Senator can object; that is the 
right of the Senator. If they feel that 
even one of hundreds of lower-level 
nominees should take up nearly a full 
week of the U.S. Senate’s time, they 
can insist upon that. 
I think Presidents are due an appro-
priate level of discretion in picking 
their teams, and I believe this is true 
whether or not the President is one I 
support or oppose. I believe in having 
the 
executive 
branch 
staffed 
with 
qualified professionals. I do draw the 
line at three areas: if a nominee is to-
tally unqualified for the job, if there is 
a well-justified reason to question a 
nominee’s ethics or honesty or impar-
tiality, and, finally, if a nominee is so 
outside the mainstream in ways that 
go beyond normal good-faith disagree-
ment on matters of policy. 
I opposed a number of President 
Trump’s nominees who met one or mul-
tiple of these criteria, but I also sup-
ported a larger percentage of President 
Trump’s nominees. Even though these 
were not people I expected to agree 
with on policy, they did not fall afoul 
of the three criteria that I look at in a 
primary way. 
I am here today because of several 
nominees within the jurisdiction of 
multiple committees I sit on; they are 
being blockaded, and I would like to 
focus on one just now. 
Amy Loyd is nominated to be the As-
sistant Secretary of Education for Ca-
reer, Technical, and Adult Education.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1819 
March 29, 2022 
Ms. Loyd designed and led programs 
across the United States in her prior 
role at the education think tank Jobs 
for the Future and the Native Amer-
ican educational advocacy group the 
Cook Inlet Tribal Council. 
She had a distinguished academic ca-
reer, 
attending 
community 
college 
first in Santa Fe, prior to a doctorate 
in education leadership from Harvard 
Graduate School of Education. She is a 
lifelong professional in the field of ca-
reer and technical education, and she 
brings personal life experience in the 
field, having begun her career at com-
munity college. I believe she is an out-
standing point person for President 
Biden when it comes to matters of ca-
reer and technical education. 
The Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions advanced 
her nomination by a voice vote, with 
no recorded opposition. I sit on the 
HELP Committee. I am the chairman 
of the bipartisan Senate Career and 
Technical Education Caucus. I was 
proud to support her. 
Although I do not know Ms. Loyd 
personally, I do have a personal con-
nection to her nomination. My dad ran 
a welding and ironworking shop. I grew 
up working in that shop with my two 
brothers and my mother. I saw the 
power of career and technical edu-
cation and the artistry of the iron-
workers who worked in my dad’s busi-
ness. 
When I was in the middle of law 
school, I took a year off to go be a mis-
sionary in Honduras, and I ran a school 
that taught kids to be carpenters and 
welders, again seeing the power of ca-
reer and technical education. And I 
think that there is a bipartisan under-
standing in this body and the House— 
really, in society at large—that we 
may have undervalued career and tech-
nical education in recent generations; 
and as we are contemplating things 
like an infrastructure bill or other im-
portant priorities to grow the econ-
omy, we need to put more stress, not 
less, on the value of career and tech-
nical education. 
So, as a Senator, I am proud to have 
made this one of my central policy 
fields: working on CTE bills with 
many, many colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle. 
There is a hold on Amy Loyd’s nomi-
nation, and that is the right of those 
who would hold her. But I am here spe-
cifically because I would like to know 
why. 
I would ask my colleagues under 
which of the three buckets does Ms. 
Loyd’s nomination fall short? Is there 
a perception that she is not qualified? 
Is there a perception that she is not 
ethical? Is there a perception that her 
views on career and technical edu-
cation are outside the mainstream? 
You don’t have to support President 
Biden’s nominees. If she is confirmed, 
part of her job will be answering tough 
questions from colleagues. 
But I would ask my colleagues, if you 
are voting against nominees of any 
President from the other party not be-
cause of flaws of the kinds that I have 
described, what does that get us? 
The American people put Democrats 
for a period of time in charge of both 
the 
executive 
and 
the 
legislative 
branches. The American public often 
vote for divided government. Does that 
mean that any time the White House 
and the Senate are controlled by dif-
ferent parties, the parties just won’t 
have anybody in their administration? 
What does that get our country? I 
think we know the answer: dysfunc-
tion. 
Clearly, Madam President, as I con-
clude, there are nominees who engen-
der significant controversy, either be-
cause of the peculiar nature of the post 
to which they have been nominated or 
because of aspects of their background 
or character. I know of no such con-
troversy with this nominee, either 
about the position or about the indi-
vidual herself. And I think if we are to 
succeed in the necessary project of ele-
vating the importance of career and 
technical education, we need to have 
Ms. Loyd confirmed in her position. 
For that reason, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate consider the 
following nomination; Calendar No. 
669, Amy Loyd, to be Assistant Sec-
retary for Career, Technical, and Adult 
Education, Department of Education; 
that the Senate vote on the nomina-
tion without intervening action or de-
bate; that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table; and that any statements related 
to the nomination be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
I do think it is significant that the 
party that is now in the majority that 
was previously in the minority took a 
different position when it was not in 
the minority—when it was not in the 
majority and when a President of their 
political party was not in power. There 
was elaborate and, I believe, an exces-
sive delay in the confirmation of a lot 
of nominees, even more so than what 
we are seeing now. 
I do have concerns that are par-
ticular as to this particular nominee 
and not generalized. They are not con-
cerns that could be dismissed simply as 
a result of basic partisan disagree-
ments, but based on views that are con-
siderably outside the mainstream and 
that are radical and harmful. 
Let me explain. As vice president of 
the think tank Jobs for the Future, Ms. 
Loyd was responsible for overseeing 
that organization’s workforce develop-
ment efforts through the lens of diver-
sity, equity, and inclusion. 
It is of great concern to me that this 
body of work produced reports that 
promulgated ideas aimed at furthering 
the divisive agenda of critical race the-
ory and ESG scores. One of the most 
alarming of these reports is one that 
was published on September 8, 2020, 
which asserted that due to ‘‘uncon-
scious or implicit bias toward minori-
ties,’’ managers are limiting the ad-
vancement or promotion of minorities 
in the workforce. 
These 
divisive, 
inflammatory 
as-
sumptions are dangerous to the civil 
fabric of our society. Elevating individ-
uals who espouse this dangerous and 
divisive ideology to key leadership po-
sitions within the Federal Government 
will only further divide Americans, pit-
ting them one against another. 
We should instead seek to elevate 
into positions of leadership those who 
aim to unify the American people and 
emphasize the importance of making 
sure that people are evaluated on the 
basis of the character of their heart, 
not the color of their skin. Her work 
has done the opposite of that. 
In good conscience, I cannot and will 
not support the nomination of Ms. 
Loyd; and on that basis, I object.

jection is heard.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to speak about 
unleashing American energy. Earlier 
this month, we saw the highest price 
ever for a gallon of gasoline in the 
United States. Inflation is over a high 
of 40 years. Energy costs are driving 
the cost of everything else, and there 
appears to be no end in sight. Joe 
Biden cannot hide from the fact that 
he is the President of high prices. 
Meanwhile, 
in 
Europe, 
Vladimir 
Putin continues his onslaught. The 
Russian killing machine continues its 
assault on innocent people. Thousands 
of civilians have been killed. This in-
cludes hundreds of children. 
Vladimir Putin’s war crimes are all 
paid for with Russian energy. Energy 
accounts for nearly half of Putin’s 
budget. Energy is the only successful 
industry in the Russian economy. If 
you want to defund Vladimir Putin, 
you have to drain his tank. You have 
to defund him on energy. 
So what have we seen from the Presi-
dent of the United States? Well, Joe 
Biden spent all last year acting like 
Vladimir Putin was his ‘‘Secretary of 
Energy.’’ Joe Biden played right along. 
Putin wanted it; Biden did it, followed 
the ‘‘Secretary of Energy.’’ 
Biden decided against sanctions on 
Putin’s Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. People 
in this body, on both sides of the aisle, 
said: Mr. President, sanction the pipe-
line; don’t allow it. 
Putin said: I want it. 
Biden gave it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1820 
March 29, 2022 
Actually, Joe Biden actually lobbied 
this body, the U.S. Senate, to not do 
what we knew was the right thing to do 
in terms of sanctioning Vladimir Putin 
and the pipeline. Biden caved to Putin. 
Biden also caved to Putin by extend-
ing our nuclear arms reduction treaty 
without any conditions. He essentially 
gave Vladimir Putin exactly what he 
wanted: a permission slip to build up 
the military. Even after the invasion, 2 
weeks in, Joe Biden was still fine with 
buying Russian oil. It took bipartisan 
Members of the House and the Senate 
to stop it. 
He didn’t ban Russian oil because of 
the war; it was because of this bipar-
tisan effort in Congress. We finally 
forced his hand. Democrats in Congress 
were willing to stand up to the Presi-
dent of the United States and say they 
were willing to join the Republicans in 
overriding the President on this very 
matter. Joe Biden dragged his feet, so 
a bipartisan group in Congress had to 
drag Joe Biden. 
Every Member of this body should re-
member what President Zelenskyy had 
to say to us. He said: If there had been 
sanctions, meaning in January, there 
would not have been a war. In January, 
I came to this floor, and I said history 
would not be kind to those who ran in-
terference for Vladimir Putin. It is 
even more true today. History will not 
be kind to those who stood by as Vladi-
mir Putin planned, prepared, and paid 
for the invasion. 
At every step in this crisis, Congress 
has had to take the lead, and the Presi-
dent had to be pulled along. Congress 
had to drag Joe Biden into banning 
seven Russian banks from the SWIFT 
payment system. Congress had to drag 
Joe Biden into revoking Russia’s trade 
status. 
Congress had to drag Joe Biden into 
sending lethal aid to Ukraine. Two- 
thirds of this aid still hasn’t been de-
livered. Congress signed a check for $3 
billion in weapons. So far, it looks like 
Joe Biden has provided to Ukraine 
about $800 million. 
So where are the weapons? Where are 
the weapons right now? There is no 
time to waste. Innocent people are 
being murdered. In so much of this, Joe 
Biden has been not just a day late but 
billions of dollars short, and he is lead-
ing from far, far behind. 
But Joe Biden seems to be proud of 
himself. He went to Europe last week, 
bragged about the sanctions on Russia. 
Well, there is still a lot of work to do. 
I am here on the Senate floor to tell 
you that we have more work to do in 
terms of dragging Joe Biden along. On 
Friday, Joe Biden announced an energy 
agreement with the European Union. 
The White House listed 14 things that 
they would do. Well, what was missing 
from that list? Well, I will tell you: the 
one thing that would actually work. 
Missing from the list of 14 was the 
thing that would actually work, which 
is increasing the production of Amer-
ican oil and gas. Under the agreement, 
Europe will buy an additional 15 billion 
cubic meters of natural gas each year. 
Now, that is about 10 percent of what 
they currently buy from Russia. So 
where is it going to come from? It is a 
legitimate question. They don’t know. 
On Friday, a Biden official said this. He 
said: We can’t speak to exactly where 
the natural gas is coming from. 
The White House also said that the 
United States will ‘‘maintain its regu-
latory environment.’’ In other words, 
no change to current policy. The war 
on American energy will continue. 
And if you took a look at the budget 
that came out yesterday, there are 36 
new taxes proposed, 11 of which are 
going to drive up the cost of American 
energy. At a time of the highest gas 
prices ever, 40 percent inflation, the 
Biden budget says we need to put more 
tax on the production of energy in this 
country. 
We need to produce more energy. We 
need it. We will use it. Europe needs it. 
We have promised it to them. Joe 
Biden’s regulators want to keep it in 
the ground. 
Now, Secretary Granholm waited 
until last week to approve two pending 
applications for liquefied natural gas 
exports. She could have approved them 
last year; didn’t. Waited until 2 weeks 
after Russia invaded Ukraine to finally 
approve two of six permits. It took 
weeks of bloodshed. There are still four 
more applications waiting on her desk. 
Oh, they have been sitting there for 
well over a year. 
Time to wake up and approve the ap-
plications. Europe has woken up. They 
are wide awake from their addiction 
and reliance on their enemies for their 
energy. Joe Biden is still sleepwalking. 
Now, Russia is still exporting energy 
all around the world. We put sanctions 
in place, but this is what the Wash-
ington Post had to say. They called the 
energy exports continuing today from 
Russia ‘‘the loophole that’s keeping 
Russia’s economy alive.’’ 
China is stocking up on Russian oil 
at a discount. None of Joe Biden’s 
sanctions do a thing to stop China—not 
a one. China can continue to prop up 
the Russian war machine. 
As Senator TOOMEY has said, we need 
secondary sanctions to stop the flow of 
cash to the Kremlin. Joe Biden’s bank-
ing sanctions explicitly avoid hitting 
Russian energy. It is the key to this 
funding: $5 to $7 billion a week to the 
killing machine from exporting Rus-
sian energy. 
The banking sanctions don’t even go 
into effect until June 24. It is still 
March. April, May—June 24. The war 
may be over by then, but in the mean-
time, thousands of people could die. 
Oh, and the President’s sanctions do 
not include Russian uranium. They 
should, but they don’t. As a result, our 
Nation, America, remains dependent on 
Vladimir Putin for one of the most im-
portant elements on Earth. You want 
to defund Putin’s invasion, it is time to 
finish the job with banning of imports 
from Russia to the United States, and 
we must ban uranium. We need to do it 
now. 
Now, earlier this month, I have intro-
duced legislation to do just that. Now, 
I am grateful that Senator LUMMIS and 
Senator 
MARSHALL
and 
Senator 
CRAMER have added their strong sup-
port. Here in America, we have vast 
uranium supplies, and it is especially 
true in my home State of Wyoming. 
There is no reason at all that America 
should be buying uranium from Vladi-
mir Putin and Russia. 
Now, Joe Biden is also helping sell 
Russian uranium in other countries be-
cause, right now, Joe Biden is pushing 
our Nation into a deal with Iran that 
was negotiated by Russia. Yes, you 
heard me right: negotiated by Russia— 
not negotiated by the Americans, not 
negotiated by—no. We let Vladimir 
Putin negotiate with Iran on a nuclear 
deal. 
A deal with Iran would mean billions 
of dollars for Russia. You don’t believe 
it? It is true. A Russia state-controlled 
nuclear energy company would get 
about $10 billion out of the deal. More 
bullets, more bombs, more bloodshed 
paid for by Joe Biden’s uranium deal. 
When it comes to Iran and Russia, no 
deal is a good deal. Whether it is ura-
nium, whether it is natural gas, the so-
lution for Russian energy is American 
energy. We have it. We have it in abun-
dance. This administration will not let 
us get it out of the ground. 
Today, we are still producing 1.3 mil-
lion fewer barrels of oil than we were 
prior to the pandemic. The administra-
tion is still sitting on 4,600 drilling per-
mits. Joe Biden still hasn’t had a sin-
gle lease sale on Federal lands for oil 
and gas. 
Just yesterday, Joe Biden proposed a 
$43 billion tax increase on American 
energy. Who pays these taxes? Clearly, 
the hard-working families of this coun-
try in the form of higher prices. This is 
the last thing the country needs now at 
a time of 40-year high inflation and the 
highest gas prices ever. 
Energy security is worth a lot more 
than climate zealotry. Our friends in 
Europe who are held hostage by Vladi-
mir Putin will tell you that today. We 
are much better off as a nation selling 
energy to our friends than being forced 
to buy it from our enemies. 
What President Biden and the Demo-
crats don’t seem to understand is this: 
Energy security is national security. 
For ourselves, for our allies, we need 
more American energy, and we need it 
now. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1821 
March 29, 2022 
The Senator from Iowa. 
BIDEN FAMILY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Yesterday, Senator 
JOHNSON and I discussed a joint inves-
tigation into the Biden family’s foreign 
financial entanglements. We reviewed 
much of our earlier work and provided 
a brief preview of the new material. 
Today, we will give our second speech 
on our Biden investigation series. Once 
again, we are going to make public and 
we are going to describe new financial 
records relating to Hunter Biden and 
his connections to the communist Chi-
nese Government. Most of that focus 
will be on his connections to the CEFC, 
a company that is effectively an arm of 
the Chinese Government. 
But first we must go back to 2015. At 
that time, Hunter Biden served on the 
board of Burisma and was paid tens of 
thousands of dollars each month. Its 
owner was a corrupt Russian-aligned 
Ukrainian oligarch. But that is not all 
that Hunter Biden was up to. 
In that year, CEFC International an-
nounced an agreement with Northern 
International Capital Holdings. North-
ern International is incorporated in 
China, and it is very much involved in 
the energy sector. 
One of Ye Jianming’s companies was 
a majority shareholder of CEFC Inter-
national. Northern International pur-
chased 123 million dollars’ worth of 
CEFC’s shares, binding the two compa-
nies together. 
We must also mention Hudson West 
III and its financial connection to 
CEFC. Hunter Biden was an investor 
and a manager of Hudson West III. He 
was tasked with advancing its inter-
ests. Hudson West III also involved Chi-
nese nationals connected to the com-
munist regime, such as Gongwen Dong, 
whom I talked about yesterday. 
Now let’s look at this first poster. 
I should note that Senator JOHNSON 
and I will make these documents public 
in full. We are providing snapshots for 
our presentation here on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. 
Here we have one portion of an LLC 
agreement from a bank. It shows the 
companies that have bound themselves 
together: Hudson West V, Hudson West 
III, and Owasco. Owasco is Hunter 
Biden’s firm. 
Now let’s turn to the second poster. 
The paragraph at the top shows the 
purpose for which the LLC agreement 
exists. 
So what this tells us is that Hunter 
Biden and James Biden linked up with 
companies connected to the communist 
regime to assist them with finding 
projects for global and domestic infra-
structure and energy. 
As we know from my and Senator 
JOHNSON’s report from last August, 
some energy project explorations be-
tween the Biden family and China were 
here in the United States. One example 
is a multimillion-dollar natural gas 
project in Louisiana. 
Now let’s move to the next paragraph 
at the bottom of this same poster, 
which defines the word ‘‘affiliate’’ in 
the agreement. 
For the avoidance of doubt, CEFC China 
Energy Company Limited or any of its Affili-
ates shall be deemed as an Affiliate of Hud-
son. 
Accordingly, this agreement between 
Hunter Biden’s firm and Hudson West 
III and Hudson West V directly con-
nects Hunter Biden to CEFC. 
So was this agreement executed? 
Let’s look at this third poster, which 
contains a signature block executing 
the agreement. 
Here we see Hunter Biden’s signature 
with Gongwen Dong. As previously 
noted, Gongwen was an associate of Ye 
Jianming. Both men were connected to 
the communist regime, including its 
military elements. 
Notably, Hunter Biden worked for Ye 
Jianming to get him involved in the 
natural gas project in Louisiana. That 
project eventually fell through. 
Now let’s bring up a fourth poster la-
beled a ‘‘Joinder Agreement’’ relating 
to the LLC agreement. 
Again, Hunter Biden is signing with 
Gongwen Dong with respect to the LLC 
agreement. Accordingly, we can now 
conclude the following: Hunter Biden 
was financially connected to CEFC, a 
company that was an arm of the com-
munist Chinese regime, for the purpose 
of advancing its energy interests. 
This agreement also shows two addi-
tional findings: first, Hunter Biden’s 
responsibility to advance Hudson West 
III’s interests as of August 2, 2017; sec-
ond, Hunter Biden’s close association 
with Hudson West III, CEFC, and its af-
filiates as of August 2, 2017. That date 
is important as I will show you soon. 
Let’s turn to a fifth poster. On this 
fifth poster, look at the top. 
This is a bank record showing an Au-
gust 8, 2017, wire transfer from North-
ern International Capital to Hudson 
West III for $5 million. This is $5 mil-
lion from a company that is connected 
to Ye Jianming and CEFC and its af-
filiates, which are essentially arms of 
the communist Chinese regime, and 
that transfer took place after Hunter 
Biden became closely associated with 
Hudson West III as the LLC agreement 
shows. 
So what was the money for? 
As noted, Hunter Biden was working 
with Chinese nationals linked to the 
communist regime to help them ex-
plore energy projects. 
Now look at the bottom of this post-
er. 
This is a paragraph from the LLC 
agreement. It shows that Hunter Biden 
was paid $100,000 per month; that 
James Biden was paid $65,000 per 
month; and that Hunter Biden will be 
paid a onetime retainer fee of $500,000. 
Again, this is money connected to 
Hudson West III, a company connected 
to CEFC and Gongwen Dong. Both are 
connected, in turn, to the communist 
Chinese regime. 
We can now conclude this with re-
spect to James Biden: James Biden was 
financially connected to CEFC, a com-
pany that was an arm of the com-
munist Chinese regime, for the purpose 
of advancing energy interests. 
After the LLC agreement was signed, 
money flowed from CEFC and its share-
holders into the bank account of Hud-
son West III, including the $5 million 
from Northern International. This LLC 
agreement was the trigger point for 
high-dollar financial transactions in-
volving Hunter and James Biden. 
Now let’s turn to poster six and view 
the top. 
This is a Hudson West III bank record 
that shows a wire transfer on August 
31, 2017, for $165,000. Notably, this is the 
same month as the $5 million wire from 
Northern International. It is also the 
same month that Hunter Biden signed 
the August 2, 2017, LLC agreement. The 
wire is to Wells Fargo Clearing Serv-
ices. 
Now look at the bottom of this post-
er. 
Senator JOHNSON and I have acquired 
more than just the bank statement; we 
have acquired underlying wire data. 
So look at the fourth line at the bot-
tom. It says: 
Further credit to Owasco PC. 
The underlying wire data shows that 
it went to Owasco, Hunter Biden’s 
firm. 
Senator JOHNSON and I have years of 
bank 
records 
that 
show 
multiple 
$165,000 wire transfers from Hudson 
West III to Owasco. There were also 
wire transfers for other amounts—some 
for more, some for less. Most likely, 
some of those payments were for ex-
penses under the LLC agreement. 
So you have an August 2, 2017, LLC 
agreement with Hudson West III and 
Owasco noting $100,000 a month to Hun-
ter Biden and $65,000 to James Biden. 
Then you have an August 8, 2017, wire 
transfer of $5 million from Northern 
International to Hudson West III. After 
that August 8 wire, you see years of 
wire transfers from Hudson West III to 
Hunter Biden’s company. The majority 
of these is for $165,000—the exact 
amount due under the LLC agreement. 
Based on the timing of the trans-
actions, Hunter Biden’s and James 
Biden’s payments under the LLC agree-
ment came from that $5 million wire— 
a wire, mind you, that came from a 
company connected to Ye Jianming 
and CEFC, which is an arm of the Chi-
nese Government. 
These years of records show that 
Hunter Biden and James Biden were 
more connected to the communist re-
gime’s elements than had been pre-
viously known. These records place 
them at the center of Hudson West III, 
Gongwen Dong, and CEFC. 
This is a finding that Senator JOHN-
SON and I made public in our Biden re-
ports last Congress. These are the same 
reports that Members of the other po-
litical party in this body and the lib-
eral press found fault with; that, some-
how, it was Russian disinformation. 
So I say this to the liberal media and 
our Democratic colleagues who tried to 
smear our work all of these years and 
accuse 
us 
of 
peddling 
Russian 
disinformation: You have seen all of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1822 
March 29, 2022 
these documents that we have pre-
sented. Are these official bank records 
Russian disinformation? 
To our Democratic colleagues and 
the liberal media, we deserve an answer 
because you made several efforts to 
smear our reputations as we were 
starting this investigation 2 or 3 years 
ago. 
Now I am going to turn it over to 
Senator JOHNSON to discuss a name 
that I gave you yesterday, Patrick Ho, 
and related records to Patrick Ho that 
we have acquired. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as my 
colleague, the senior Senator from 
Iowa, has shown, Hunter Biden and 
James Biden received millions of dol-
lars from companies connected to the 
communist Chinese regime. Frankly, it 
is worse than that. These companies 
were effectively an arm of the Chinese 
Government. 
This isn’t Russian disinformation; 
these are hard facts backed up by bank 
records of actual financial records and 
transactions that prove just how con-
nected the Bidens were and how com-
promised President Biden probably is. 
I use this next series of transactions 
to prove my point. 
The first chart here shows a bank 
record showing a $1 million wire trans-
fer into the account of Hudson West III 
from CEFC Limited on November 2, 
2017. As Senator GRASSLEY and I have 
already established, CEFC is effec-
tively an arm of the communist Chi-
nese regime. It is also important to 
note that at the time of this transfer, 
in November 2017, Hunter Biden was al-
ready invested in and providing man-
agement for Hudson West III. So a 
company that was effectively an arm of 
the Chinese Government transferred $1 
million in November 2017 to a company 
that Hunter Biden is managing and is 
invested in. 
I also bring up the second record. 
Focus on the $1 million wired out on 
March 22, 2018. Again, this is a record 
from Hudson West III’s bank account. 
Like the previous record, this is show-
ing the transfer of $1 million, but this 
time the money is being transferred 
out of Hudson West III to OWASCO, an-
other one of Hunter Biden’s firms. This 
transfer took place on March 22, 2018, a 
little less than 5 months after the $1 
million transfer from CEFC to Hudson 
West III. 
Hunter is transferring $1 million be-
tween two firms he manages and has 
ownership in. So what is the purpose of 
these two $1 million transfers? This 
next record seems to answer that ques-
tion. This record shows OWASCO’s re-
ceipt of the March 22, 2018, $1 million 
transfer. It also shows what the trans-
fer is for on the OBI line. ‘‘OBI’’ is an 
abbreviation for ‘‘originating bene-
ficiary information.’’ It is like the 
memo line on your personal check; it 
tells you really what that check was 
about. In this case, the OBI indicates 
the transfer is being made for ‘‘Dr. Pat-
rick Ho Chi Ping representation.’’ 
So, to recap, on November 2, 2017, 
Patrick Ho’s company, CEFC, wired $1 
million to Hunter Biden’s company, 
Hudson West III. On March 22, 2018, 
Hudson West III wired $1 million to 
OWASCO, another Hunter Biden com-
pany. The bank record clearly states 
that the $1 million payment was being 
made for the purpose of representing 
Patrick Ho. 
Represent him for what? Here is 
where things get interesting. We know 
that Patrick Ho was arrested by U.S. 
authorities in November 2017 for inter-
national bribery and money laundering 
charges. Keep in mind that this arrest 
occurred in the same month that Pat-
rick Ho’s company, CEFC, is wiring $1 
million to Hunter Biden’s company, 
Hudson West III. According to the De-
partment of Justice, ‘‘Ho orchestrated 
and executed two bribery schemes to 
pay top officials of Chad and Uganda in 
exchange for business advantages for 
CEFC China, a Shanghai-based multi-
billion dollar conglomerate that oper-
ates in multiple sectors, including oil, 
gas, and banking.’’ These are crimes 
for which Patrick Ho is eventually con-
victed and sent to Federal prison for 
committing. 
So the company that Patrick Ho was 
making bribes for sends $1 million to a 
company Hunter Biden manages and is 
invested in. That company, in turn, 
transfers a million dollars to another 
Hunter Biden company for the purposes 
of representing Patrick Ho, who is 
eventually convicted of international 
bribery and money laundering. 
Guess what Patrick Ho did around 
the same time he was arrested by the 
FBI for corruption and bribery. He con-
tacted James Biden, President Biden’s 
brother. Patrick Ho’s decision to call 
the Biden family around the same time 
he got arrested is revealing, particu-
larly in light of the fact that the same 
month, a million dollars just happened 
to be transferred to Hunter Biden’s 
company. 
Now, Hunter Biden isn’t a criminal 
defense 
attorney. 
Patrick 
Ho 
was 
charged and convicted for bribery and 
related Federal offenses and crimes. So 
what kind of representation was Pat-
rick Ho’s company paying Hunter 
Biden’s firm to provide? Were they pay-
ing for his firm’s legal expertise or for 
Hunter’s political connections? 
In March 2021, Senator GRASSLEY and 
I asked the Justice Department about 
Patrick Ho. Why? Because there is a 
Federal court filing that says the De-
partment has FISA records on Patrick 
Ho. We requested these records. In re-
sponse, the Department would not con-
firm 
whether 
they 
even 
had 
his 
records. Unfortunately, the Attorney 
General refuses to clarify that out-
rageous contradiction for Congress. 
Oh, and one more tidbit. In a re-
cently uncovered audio extracted from 
his laptop, Hunter Biden referred to 
Patrick Ho as the ‘‘[expletive deleted] 
spy chief of China.’’ Let that sink in a 
minute. Hunter Biden referred to Pat-
rick Ho in an audio as the ‘‘[expletive 
deleted] spy chief of China.’’ This quote 
alone tells you that Hunter Biden knew 
exactly who he was dealing with. He 
knew exactly who he was dealing with. 
He was dealing with the ‘‘[expletive de-
leted] spy chief of China.’’ Now, that 
fact should alert the media and our 
Democrat colleagues to seriously con-
sider the implications the Biden’s fam-
ily vast web of foreign financial entan-
glements have in the conduct of this 
administration’s foreign policy and our 
national security, but I am not holding 
my breath. 
In October 2020, Senator GRASSLEY 
and I requested to interview Hunter 
and James Biden about their financial 
dealings. If they had nothing to hide, 
they could have volunteered to come in 
and sit for an interview. If there was an 
innocent explanation for these foreign 
financial transactions, they could have 
used that interview to clarify what 
those transactions were about. Unfor-
tunately, rather than being trans-
parent, honest, and forthcoming, they 
declined to speak to us. Their silence 
speaks volumes. 
Fortunately, 
facts 
are 
stubborn 
things. As the Bidens, our Democrat 
colleagues, and the media are learning, 
it is difficult to keep them hidden for-
ever. Senator GRASSLEY and I will con-
tinue to investigate the Biden family’s 
foreign financial entanglements and 
provide the American people with the 
truth to the best of our ability. 
Our challenge is that the deep state 
does not give up its secrets easily. New 
evidence of Biden family influence ped-
dling is surfacing on a regular basis, 
often coming from records from Hunter 
Biden’s laptop—the same laptop, by the 
way, that the media and deep state for-
eign intelligence agency officials in-
ferred—strongly 
inferred—was, 
you 
guessed it, Russian disinformation. 
And their guile worked. 
Prior to the election, people bought 
the fact that that laptop was probably 
Russian disinformation. It wasn’t. As 
the New York Times just admitted 
about a year too late—more than a 
year too late—that laptop is authentic, 
and the evidence it is producing is real. 
But, of course, that laptop wasn’t Rus-
sian disinformation, nor is any of the 
information we presented in our re-
ports and here on the floor of the Sen-
ate. 
We may never know all the details of 
the Biden family foreign entangle-
ments or the full extent to which those 
entanglements compromise our current 
President, but I am pretty confident I 
know 
who 
does 
know—intelligence 
operatives in Russia, China, Iran, and 
North Korea. Elements within our U.S. 
intelligence 
agencies 
probably 
also 
know; they are just not going to tell us 
or you, the American people. 
Senator GRASSLEY and I will return 
for our third speeches in this series on 
the Biden family’s foreign financial en-
tanglements. 
Until then, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1823 
March 29, 2022 
UKRAINE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it has 
been more than a month since Russia 
launched an unprovoked and unwar-
ranted attack against the people of 
Ukraine. In the interim, the world has 
marveled at the strength, the resil-
iency, and the courage of Ukrainian 
forces, as well as their leadership in 
President Zelenskyy. 
Ukraine has a real shot at defeating 
this Russian aggression, but that can 
only happen if it has the weapons and 
resources it desperately needs. 
I recently traveled to Poland and 
Germany with a bipartisan group of 
Senate colleagues to learn more about 
what Ukraine needs and the challenges 
our NATO allies are up against. 
Over the course of 3 days, we met 
with American military leaders and 
diplomats, as well as members of the 
82nd Airborne. We spoke with our 
NATO partners, who are supporting 
both the military and humanitarian 
needs of Ukraine, and we had the op-
portunity to talk to some of the 
Ukrainian refugees themselves. The 
primary message we heard, consistent 
message that we heard was, we need 
more and we need it faster—more 
Stingers, more Javelins, more air de-
fenses, more lethal aid—and they reit-
erated their need for aircraft like the 
Poland MiGs. 
Statements of support are important, 
but they do nothing to help Ukrainian 
forces defeat this Russian aggression. 
It was an incredibly powerful and en-
lightening experience to hear directly 
from the incredible men and women on 
the ground, and I want to thank our 
friend, Senator ERNST from Iowa, for 
leading this bipartisan congressional 
delegation. I think it also sent a very 
strong message to our friends and al-
lies in the region that 10 Senators— 
one-tenth of the United States Sen-
ate—were willing to make this trip on 
a bipartisan basis. I think we all came 
back with a deeper understanding of 
Ukraine’s needs and a renewed sense of 
urgency to do everything in our power 
to make it happen. 
Over the last 4 weeks, Russia has 
bombed Ukrainian hospitals, schools, 
apartment buildings, humanitarian ref-
ugee corridors even, and even civilians 
waiting in a bread line. It is pretty 
clear that we need to use every tool 
available to bolster Ukraine’s defense 
and weaken the aggression of the Rus-
sian forces. It is not a matter of one or 
the other; we need to do both. 
To support Ukraine, we need to an-
swer the call for more defensive weap-
ons. Whether intentionally or not, the 
administration has given Ukraine the 
bare minimum—just enough to keep it 
from being completely overrun by the 
Russians but not enough to help it win 
the war. In other words, the Biden ad-
ministration is propping up Ukraine to 
keep taking further hits rather than 
giving it the full forces it needs to win 
the fight. 
We need to help Ukraine vanquish 
Russian forces from its territory en-
tirely, not just to extend the length of 
this war. Actually, by not giving 
Ukraine everything it needs in order to 
repulse Russian aggression, we are 
playing into Putin’s hands, because 
Putin has clearly changed his tactics. 
From the initial reports of trying to 
encircle Kyiv and perhaps assassinate 
President Zelenskyy and install a pup-
pet government, clearly, Putin has bit-
ten off more than he can chew when it 
comes to invading Ukraine and exe-
cuting on that original mission. 
But now, he is engaged in a war of at-
trition, flattening Ukrainian cities, 
killing innocent civilians from outside 
of Ukrainian airspace because he is 
worried about the anti-aircraft capa-
bilities of the Ukrainians using things 
like MANPADS and Stinger missiles. 
Well, time is on Putin’s side, and we 
need to level the playing field and ac-
tually give the Ukrainians what they 
need in order to stop this war as soon 
as possible, before further loss of life 
and further damage to their country is 
done. 
Now, the most effective way to do 
this—since Ukraine is not a member of 
NATO, we are not going to send troops 
there, as President Biden has said, ap-
propriately so; but we need to ensure 
that the Ukrainians have everything 
they need in order to do the job them-
selves. As President Zelenskyy has 
said: 
Ukraine can’t shoot down Russian missiles 
with shotguns and machine guns. 
Unfortunately, there are a lot of 
roadblocks standing in the way, and 
unfortunately, one of those is the re-
luctance of the Biden administration 
to quickly and expeditiously get the 
Ukrainians what they need. 
For example, Poland offered to trans-
fer its entire fleet of MiG–29 fighters to 
the United States for delivery to 
Ukraine. 
Ukrainian 
forces 
already 
know how to fly these Russian aircraft, 
and President Zelenskyy assured us 
that they are desperately needed. But 
the Biden administration rejected the 
offer after, first, Secretary Blinken 
seemed to give it the green light. The 
administration changed its mind out of 
fear that they might provoke Putin— 
once again, playing right into his hand. 
All Putin has to do is rattle his saber 
to deter the United States and its al-
lies from helping Ukraine to the max-
imum of our capability. 
Another 
big 
obstacle 
that 
the 
Ukrainians are finding is the redtape 
associated with anything that the Fed-
eral Government seems to do. Ukraine 
has provided a detailed list of the re-
sources it needs: fighters, anti-aircraft 
missile systems, more Stingers, more 
Javelins. It is not a list of items they 
will need next month or the next; it is 
what they need right now in order to 
survive. The process of getting defense 
articles into Ukrainian soldiers’ hands 
includes some big bureaucratic hurdles 
that not only make it harder to act 
quickly but make it more difficult to 
send Ukraine the resources they des-
perately need. 
Fortunately, there is strong prece-
dent from World War II that we could 
follow to help expedite the process. 
During World War II, when Britain was 
hanging on by a thread and the United 
States was a noncombatant in that 
worldwide war at the time, President 
Roosevelt vowed to transform the 
United States into the ‘‘arsenal of de-
mocracy,’’ as he called it; and he 
worked with Congress to pass the 
Lend-Lease Act. 
This legislation allowed the United 
States to use its industrial might to 
supply Britain and our other allies 
with the resources they needed at a 
critical time in World War II and with-
out lengthy delays. 
Borrowing inspiration from President 
Roosevelt, I introduced bipartisan leg-
islation with colleagues called the 
Ukraine 
Democracy 
Defense 
Lend- 
Lease Act, which will expedite getting 
Ukrainian forces the resources they 
need to win the fight without any un-
necessary delays. 
I also think that, in addition to the 
actions by the administration, I think 
it sends a strong bipartisan message of 
support from this body and gives en-
couragement to our friends in Ukraine, 
who are fighting for their very exist-
ence. This legislation authorizes the 
President to enter lend-lease agree-
ments directly with Ukraine and pro-
vide Ukrainian forces with lethal weap-
ons needed to defend their sovereignty. 
But I think, rather than the piece-
meal approach being used by the ad-
ministration, this would open this ar-
senal of democracy known as the 
American industrial base to provide 
Ukraine what it needs and give them 
the assurance that, whether they need 
it today or tomorrow or they need it 
replenished next week, it will be there 
for them as long as they need it. 
I am proud to have worked with a 
number of colleagues on this bipartisan 
bill, 
including 
Senators 
CARDIN, 
WICKER, SHAHEEN, and many others. So 
far, more than 20 Senators have co-
sponsored this legislation, and I hope 
we can pass it without any further 
delay. This is obviously an urgent cri-
sis. 
Putin thought this was going to be 
like the Taliban taking Afghanistan 
after the United States and NATO’s 
withdrawal. He thought he could take 
Ukraine without firing a bullet—well, 
so much for Putin’s plans, his arro-
gance, and his underestimation of the 
willingness of the Ukrainian people to 
fight for their own country. 
But we need to pass this legislation 
and ensure Ukrainian forces that they 
will have what they need when they 
need it. As I said, we have a moral obli-
gation—maybe not a treaty obligation 
under NATO, but I believe we have a 
moral obligation to support people 
fighting for their very freedom and 
their very lives in a democratically run 
country like Ukraine. 
The United States and our allies have 
imposed crippling sanctions on Russian 
businesses, banks, and oligarchs, which

March 29, 2022 
have sent the country’s economy into a 
tailspin. But in typical Russian fash-
ion, they planned for some of these 
sanctions, and they have found loop-
holes in the current sanction regime. It 
has taken a page out of Venezuela’s 
book by using the purchase and sale of 
gold to bring in cash with which to run 
their economy. The Russian Federation 
is buying gold to offset the devaluation 
of the ruble, its currency, and then 
selling that gold in international mar-
kets in exchange for high-value cur-
rency. 
In short, Russia is laundering money 
through the gold market, and we need 
to put a stop to it. I, along with other 
colleagues, introduced the Stop Rus-
sian GOLD Act that would bring an end 
to this practice. We talked to Sec-
retary Yellen, and she agreed that this 
would be supplemental to what the ad-
ministration has already done unilater-
ally. 
This legislation would apply sanc-
tions to parties who help Russia fi-
nance their war by buying or selling 
this blood gold. That means anyone 
who buys or transports gold from Rus-
sia’s central bank would be the target 
of sanctions. This would be a huge de-
terrent to anyone considering doing 
business with Russia and helping them 
evade sanctions. In short, we need to 
take every possible step to cut the fi-
nancing for Putin’s war machine, and 
this is one additional way to do so. 
Along with the lend-lease bill I men-
tioned a moment ago, I hope we can 
pass this legislation without further 
delay. 
There is more we can do to support 
Ukraine and hit Russia where it hurts 
and to raise the costs associated with 
its unprovoked and unwarranted inva-
sion of Ukraine, but it is past time to 
continue to ramp up the pressure to 
the maximum ability that we can. 
At this juncture, principled leader-
ship and decisive action are absolutely 
critical. As Leader MCCONNELL put it, 
President Biden has generally done the 
right thing, but never soon enough. For 
example, last year, the President ig-
nored the immense pressure to sanc-
tion the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. He fi-
nally, after resisting, imposed those 
sanctions last month. 
As 
Russian 
troops 
mounted 
on 
Ukraine’s borders late last year, the 
administration withheld millions of 
dollars in aid for weeks before finally 
releasing 
it. 
President 
Biden 
dis-
regarded bipartisan calls to impose 
paralyzing sanctions on Russia before 
the invasion in order to try to deter it. 
Instead, he waited until after the inva-
sion happened to try to impose costs on 
Russia. President Biden ignored calls 
to stop Russian oil imports until it be-
came clear that Congress would pass 
legislation to do just that. Once the 
handwriting was on the wall, the Presi-
dent announced an import ban to try to 
get ahead of congressional action. 
President Biden has been so pre-
occupied with how Putin might react 
that Putin has been deterring the ad-
ministration from acting with the sort 
of expediency and dispatch that are ab-
solutely necessary and called for. Wait-
ing until the court of public opinion is 
not the kind of leadership that this 
emergency requires. Mr. President, 
Ukraine is being bludgeoned by Russia 
every day. We need to act with all de-
liberate speed to get them the addi-
tional 
resources 
they 
need, 
which 
means we need to do it now so they can 
fight and ultimately prevail. 
The United States may be an ocean 
away from this conflict, but democracy 
itself is on the front lines. We know 
President Putin is motivated by a vi-
sion of restoration of the Russian Em-
pire, after having called the fall of the 
Soviet Union one of the greatest geo-
political tragedies in history. 
So we don’t know when Putin will 
stop or if he will stop, which gives us 
the only option of doing everything we 
can to assist our Ukrainian friends 
from stopping him themselves. We 
stand in solidarity with our partners in 
Europe, and we are committed to sup-
porting Ukraine as it defends its sov-
ereignty. 
So, in the coming days—hopefully in 
the coming hours—I hope the Senate 
will take action on these bipartisan 
bills and impose greater costs on Rus-
sia in the interest of peace and Ukrain-
ian sovereignty. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-

dered. 
NOMINATION OF NANI A. COLORETTI 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of Nani Coloretti’s nomination 
to be the Deputy Director of the Office 
of Management and Budget. 
Ms. Coloretti is a dedicated public 
servant and a proven leader who is well 
qualified to serve as OMB Deputy Di-
rector. She has over 20 years of experi-
ence at the Federal, State, and local 
level executing complex government 
programs, improving service delivery, 
and managing large organizations. 
Ms. Coloretti served with distinction 
in the Obama administration as the As-
sistant Secretary for Management at 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury 
and then as the Deputy Secretary at 
the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
It is absolutely critical that we have 
Senate-confirmed leaders in place at 
OMB, and I have no doubt that Ms. 
Coloretti’s experience will serve the 
Agency and the American people well. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting Nani Coloretti’s nomination 
to be OMB Deputy Director. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
NOMINATION OF AMY LOYD 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to 
do a couple of things. I am awaiting 
the arrival of the Senator from Mis-
souri. I am going to make a UC motion 
to bring up a very important nominee 
in the Secretary of Defense Depart-
ment, but before I do, I want to com-
ment on a UC that I made 2 hours ago. 
I stood here in this spot, and I sought 
unanimous consent to bring forward 
the nomination of Amy Loyd, who is 
the nominee to be Assistant Secretary 
of Education for Career and Technical 
Education. She passed out of the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee unanimously. 
We knew there was a hold on her 
nomination. We didn’t know why. So I 
sought to bring forward her nomina-
tion, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. 
LEE, appeared, and I asked him why he 
was objecting to Amy Loyd. The good 
news was, he answered. He didn’t have 
to, but he gave me an answer, and he 
said that her work indicated an attach-
ment to critical race theory. That was 
his response, and he cited an article. 
I went up to him after, and I asked 
him what the article was, and he re-
ferred me to an article dated August 
2020, titled ‘‘Diversifying Apprentice-
ship: Acknowledging Unconscious Bias 
to Improve Employee Access.’’ That 
was the reason he and, he said, on be-
half of others were opposing Ms. Loyd’s 
nomination for a really important posi-
tion focusing on career and technical 
education in the country. 
I went back to my office, and I got 
the article. The article is seven pages 
long, August 2020—it is actually six 
pages 
long. 
It 
is 
entirely 
uncontroversial. Listen to this. There 
is a block that says ‘‘What Is Uncon-
scious Bias?’’ Talk about fair and bal-
anced language: 
Unconscious biases are social stereotypes 
about certain groups of people that individ-
uals form outside their conscious awareness. 
Is that controversial? Is that con-
troversial? 
There are recommendations for di-
versifying apprenticeships because, as 
we know, there are a lot of apprentice-
ships where there are not many women 
in apprenticeships. Ms. Loyd is a 
woman. She wants to diversify appren-
ticeships. That doesn’t seem that un-
usual. 
The recommendations for diversi-
fying apprenticeships in this controver-
sial article where the phrase ‘‘critical 
race theory’’ is never mentioned are 
widen the selection pool; seek out 
workers across skill levels; develop 
transparent, detailed, and uniform cri-
teria; get multiple perspectives; com-
plement selection processes with pro-
gram designs that increase access. This 
is just basic human resources. There is 
nothing in this document about crit-
ical race theory. 
When I read it thinking I was going 
to find some real reason to oppose Ms. 
Loyd, I found this basic human re-
sources 
101—nothing 
about 
critical 
race theory. But then I realized some-
thing even more amazing. I looked at

the author of the article. This was 
being held against Ms. Loyd’s con-
firmation. The author of the article is 
Jessica Toglia, senior program man-
ager of JFF. Unless this is a nom de 
plume, Amy Loyd had nothing to do 
with the article that was cited to block 
her confirmation for this position. 
So then I looked further. There are 
acknowledgements 
on 
page 
7. 
Ms. 
Toglia thanks 10 different people who 
gave her ideas and thoughts that she 
put into these six pages. Amy Loyd’s 
name isn’t among the 10. 
There are then 28 footnotes and ref-
erences citing articles and other pieces 
of scholarship that were written. None 
of them are by Amy Loyd—none. 
So in response to my request as the 
son of a welder that we ought to have 
somebody at the Department of Edu-
cation who values career and technical 
education, 
this 
well-qualified 
indi-
vidual, who got out of the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
by unanimous vote, is now being sort 
of tarred with the ‘‘critical race the-
ory’’ label based upon an article that 
she had nothing to do with—nothing to 
do with. 
I knew if I came back and stated this, 
like, well, who would listen, and who 
would care? You can assert a reason. 
But the reason for opposition to her 
nomination has nothing to do with her. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. President, I am here on another 
nomination, the nomination of Chris-
topher Lowman to be Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Sustainment. 
That position, the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Sustainment, is 
the principal assistant and adviser to 
the Department on logistics and mate-
riel readiness. The Assistant Secretary 
prescribes the policies and procedures 
for the conduct of logistics, mainte-
nance, materiel readiness, strategic 
mobility, sustainment support in the 
DOD, supply, maintenance, and trans-
portation—extremely important func-
tions to have a military that works. 
We are watching the Russian mili-
tary bog down in Ukraine right now for 
a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons 
is that their military has not been sus-
tained and maintained, and a lot of 
their equipment is bogging down. 
Mr. Lowman is the person who would 
do this important job, and he has been 
pending before us since November with 
a vacancy in that position at the Pen-
tagon. 
Let me tell you about Mr. Lowman. 
He spent his entire life serving this 
country in the military, and I mean en-
tire life. He was born on a military 
base in Germany because his father 
was an Army civilian. When he grad-
uated from high school, he went to 
Monmouth University and then imme-
diately joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 
1984. 
Since 1984—38 years—Mr. Lowman 
has worked first as a U.S. marine and 
then as an Army civil servant, totaling 
more than 30 years. He most recently 
served as the Assistant Deputy Chief of 
Staff to the G–3/5/7 Directorate, which 
provides planning and staff manage-
ment for Agencies under the authority 
of the Combined Arms Support Com-
mand. He served as Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of the Army for Acquisition 
Policy and Logistics. He deployed as a 
Director of Sustainment for the Com-
bined Security Transition Command in 
Afghanistan from October 2017 to 2018. 
Prior to that deployment, he served as 
the Director for Maintenance Policy 
for the U.S. Army in the Office of the 
Chief of Staff. He was the Chief, Supply 
and Maintenance, at headquarters, U.S. 
Army Europe. 
He is a much awarded member of 
both the military and the military 
civil service—the Department of the 
Army Integrated Logistics Support 
Achievement of the Year Award; three 
Army 
Meritorious 
Civilian 
Service 
Awards; the Army Ordnance Corps 
Samuel Sharpe Award; the Army’s 
Quartermaster 
Corps 
Distinguished 
Order of Saint Martin. 
The Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Sustainment is the principal staff 
assistant and adviser to the Depart-
ment on logistics and materiel readi-
ness. This is a most important func-
tion. 
Mr. Lowman is a Virginian who has 
served his entire life from his birth in 
military families, serving this Nation 
as an Active-Duty marine and then as 
an Army civil servant. 
For that reason, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate consider the 
following nomination: Calendar No. 
777, Christopher Joseph Lowman, of 
Virginia, to be an Assistant Secretary 
of Defense; that the Senate vote on the 
nomination without intervening action 
or debate; that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table; and that any statements re-
lated to the nomination be printed in 
the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I thank the 
Senator from Virginia for accommo-
dating me here and allowing me to 
come to the floor, and I thank him for 
his remarks. I only got to hear the sec-
ond half of his remarks, but I thank 
him for his remarks and am sure that 
he is in earnest about this nomination. 
Let me tell you why I am here, and I 
will be brief. I know we have a vote 
that is about to kick off. But let me 
tell you what I am in earnest about. 
The crisis in Afghanistan—the attack 
at Abbey Gate this past August that 
cost 13 American servicemembers, in-
cluding 1 from my home State, from 
the State of Missouri, their lives—is a 
catastrophe unparalleled in our foreign 
policy in my lifetime. It is my firm 
conviction and it is also a promise that 
I made to the family of the fallen ma-
rine from my State that we should do— 
this Senate should perform its over-
sight functions related to the cata-
strophic withdrawal from Afghanistan 
and in particular the events leading up 
to that attack at Abbey Gate that re-
sulted in the deaths of those service-
members and the deaths of hundreds, I 
am afraid—hundreds—of civilians and 
many hundreds of other Americans left 
behind. 
I have come to this floor before many 
times now to ask the Senate to hold 
accountable those who planned and led 
or failed to lead, in some instances, 
this operation leading to the attack at 
Abbey Gate, leading to that cata-
strophic loss of life, and leading, I am 
afraid, to the disastrous turn in our 
foreign policy, the effects of which we 
continue to feel. 
So it is my humble but earnest re-
quest that the Senate perform its basic 
oversight functions, and, very briefly, 
let me mention one. 
U.S. Central Command ordered a re-
port of the events leading up to the 
Abbey Gate attack that we learned of 
in February. February 8, I believe, we 
learned that that report had been com-
pleted. It is several thousand pages 
long. I have the barest summary of it 
here. 
My staff and I have been through all 
of it, the thousands of pages. They had 
over 169 interviews that U.S. Central 
Command conducted, again, to try to 
understand how we got to this crisis 
point leading up to and including 
Abbey Gate. 
We have not had a single hearing in 
the U.S. Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee on this report. Now, I applaud 
Central Command for carrying out the 
report, for ordering it, for putting it 
together, but we should be learning 
what we can and holding accountable 
those who need to be held accountable. 
Who has been fired? No one. Who has 
been relieved of duty? No one. And if 
you read the report—and I commend it 
to my colleagues. If you read the re-
port, you will see individual after indi-
vidual, commanders on the ground 
warning that we are not prepared, that 
the administration was not prepared to 
get civilians to safety in Kabul; warn-
ing that the planning was not ade-
quate; warning that there were dan-
gers. 
So, Mr. President, I ask again that 
the committee do its basic oversight 
job, perform its basic function, hold a 
hearing on this report, hold account-
able those who failed in that cata-
strophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
Until that time, I am going to continue 
to ask that the Senate observe regular 
order in leadership positions in the De-
partment of Defense. 
And for those reasons, I object.

Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I respect

concerns, none of those concern this 
nominee, Christopher Lowman, and 
none of his concerns are addressed or

NOMINATION OF C.S. ELIOT KANG 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to express my support for 
the nomination of Dr. Eliot Kang to be 
Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-
national Security and Non-Prolifera-
tion, ISN. 
At a time of increasing concern 
about the potential use of chemical or 
biological weapons in Ukraine by Rus-
sia, it is vital the United States have a 
Senate-confirmed official in place to 
counter these dangers, as well as other 
nuclear threats. ISN leads the State 
Department’s efforts to halt the spread 
of weapons of mass destruction—nu-
clear, chemical, and biological—as well 
as the means to deliver them. We need 
a Senate-confirmed expert at the helm 
to coordinate prevention and response 
with the Ukrainian Government, our 
allies, and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. 
Dr. Kang is eminently qualified to do 
just that. He has the substantive exper-
tise to lead ISN and advance U.S. na-
tional security interests. During his 18- 
year career at the State Department, 
Dr. Kang has worked on a wide variety 
of nonproliferation issues. This in-
cludes the denuclearization of North 
Korea, international efforts to halt the 
spread of chemical weapons, and nu-
clear safety. He has held senior posi-
tions in ISN, where he currently serves 
as Acting Assistant Secretary, and 
served as the Department’s most senior 
official for Arms Control and Inter-
national Security. 
But because of Republican delays he 
has not yet been confirmed, despite the 
fact that he was first nominated 341 
days ago. Think about that—that was 
nearly a year ago—and he has not yet 
been confirmed. 
The 
delays 
and 
obstacles 
facing 
nominees on the Senate floor and in 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee are hampering our national se-
curity. Each day that goes by without 
critical national security posts being 
filled does a disserving to our country 
and our national security interests. Dr. 
Kang could have and should have been 
confirmed long ago. 
I strongly support confirming Dr. 
Kang, and I respectfully urge my col-
leagues to join me in advancing his 
nomination, along with all of the for-
eign affairs nominations pending be-
fore this body. 
VOTE ON KANG NOMINATION

the Senate advise and consent to the

FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, a 
lot of Americans are tracking day by 
day what is happening in Russia and 
Ukraine, as we watch the Russian 
Army continue to be able to roll its 
way through Ukraine and, city by city, 
pummel innocent people—so, literally, 
to shell homes, apartments, businesses; 
to level whole cities to the ground for 
the sake of Russia’s aggression. 
This Congress and this body in par-
ticular, in the Senate, have spoken out 
often on this issue. I am grateful that 
the President has engaged to be able to 
apply sanctions, to be able to cut off 
purchases with Russia, to be able to 
slowly open up the weaponry that we 
are giving to the Ukrainians, as they 
continue to ask for more. They are 
looking for help. The Oklahomans 
whom I talked to want us to provide 
help. 
But it is ironic, and some people may 
not know, that while we are isolating 
Russia in every way that we possibly 
can, right now, this administration is 
working with the Russian representa-
tives to be our spokesmen to Iran nego-
tiating a revised nuclear deal with 
Iran. We are not doing face-to-face ne-
gotiations with Iran. We are working 
through the Russian representative to 
represent our beliefs to the Iranians. 
Now, if anyone in this room could 
say they trust the Russians to rep-
resent our values at the table with 
Iran, please, rise, because we don’t and 
we shouldn’t, and it makes absolutely 
no sense that a revised nuclear deal is

March 29, 2022 
being done with Iran through the Rus-
sian negotiations while Russia is cur-
rently pummeling Ukraine. I wish I 
could tell you that is even the worst 
part of this deal. 
Iran has a couple of things that they 
need to be able to get to a nuclear 
weapon. The two things they need are 
time and money. They have the tech-
nology. They have the know-how. They 
have the facilities. They have the ad-
vanced centrifuges. They just need 
time and money. My frustration with 
the Iranian nuclear deal that was done 
under the Obama administration was 
that it gave them both time and 
money. It set a 10-year window where 
they couldn’t have nuclear material 
that could be usable for a nuclear 
weapon, but it allocated $100 billion in 
relief of sanctions to the Iranians—$100 
billion to the Iranian regime. 
Now, I have no beef with the Iranian 
people. They are remarkable people, 
extremely well educated, but they live 
under the thumb of a horrible regime. 
What did the Iranian regime do with 
the $100 billion that they were given? 
Well, we saw the advance of the war 
in Yemen that happened as the Ira-
nians were supplying the Houthis to be 
able to attack the Saudis and the 
Emiratis. We saw what happened in 
Lebanon 
with 
the 
support 
for 
Hezbollah to be able to attack Israel 
and to continue to destabilize. We saw 
what the Iranians did in Syria, sup-
porting Bashar al-Assad and becoming 
his army in many areas across Syria, 
and that ruthless dictator is still there 
today because of Iranian support, be-
cause of the $100 billion that was given 
to Iran so they could prop up Assad and 
so he could stay in place. That is what 
happened with the $100 billion that 
Iran was given last time. 
Then, 
the 
Trump 
administration 
came in and took away that and im-
posed maximum pressure on the Ira-
nians, walked away from the deal, and 
said: We are not going to give the larg-
est state sponsor of terrorism in the 
world billions of dollars of access to 
capital; that seems like a terrible idea. 
And I can assure you, the people of 
Syria understood that was a terrible 
idea. 
But now, what? President Biden has 
reopened negotiations, as I mentioned 
before, by using Russia as our proxy to 
be able to negotiate this. Today, we 
had negotiators that were brought on 
by the Biden administration, who are 
former negotiators under the Obama 
administration, 
to renegotiate this 
deal, who have quit the negotiating 
team and who have said that this nego-
tiation is going so badly that they will 
not be a part of it, and they walked 
away. 
We don’t know everything that is in 
this deal, and I would say to you, quite 
frankly, I am not encouraged by what 
bit of rumors that I am hearing in this 
deal. I am hearing that this deal puts 
us back into the timetable that was 
done years ago under the Obama ad-
ministration to give the 10-year win-
dow, that we are back into that same 
window that allows them to move to a 
nuclear weapon at an end-time period, 
that it doesn’t challenge their terrorist 
activities, that it doesn’t challenge 
their missile development. 
Literally, they are developing bal-
listic missiles designed to carry a nu-
clear warhead, and that is not part of 
this agreement, apparently, to restrict 
their development of a missile capable 
of carrying nuclear material, as long as 
they don’t actually work to develop 
that nuclear material. 
It releases sanctions to them. So, 
again, they get billions of dollars. And 
in the negotiations we hear, at this 
point, it lifts sanctions on the entities 
in Iran that took away the property 
and the homes from Iranian Jews in 
1979, which we have had sanctions on. 
We understand it takes the sanctions 
off of those responsible for the Beirut 
bombing in 1983 that killed 243 Ameri-
cans, mostly marines. 
We also understand that it changes 
the status of Iran from being recog-
nized as a state sponsor of terrorism— 
even though they are—and that there 
is a negotiation to take the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard Corps off the list 
of a foreign terrorist organizations. 
Are you kidding me? 
This is not a good deal for the peace 
of the region. This does not prevent 
Iran from becoming a nuclear power. 
This continues to destabilize our rela-
tionships with our allies in the region, 
as Saudi Arabia and the Emiratis and 
the Israelis and everyone stare at the 
Americans and say: Why in the world 
would you make this deal that would 
allow Iran to become a nuclear power 
in the days ahead? 
Let me tell you, this is personal for 
many American families who lost a 
loved one in the battle in Iraq, when 
Iran engages the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard to provide lethal equipment to 
the Iraqis so they could kill more 
Americans. Many Americans died in 
Iraq because of Iranian actions. 
On March 11, 2020, Technical Ser-
geant Roberts from Owasso, OK, was 
killed in Iraq when an Iran-backed mi-
litia group, equipped by Iranians, sup-
ported 
by 
the 
regime, 
arbitrarily 
launched rockets at American forces in 
Iraq, killing Technical Sergeant Rob-
erts. 
Listen, this is personal for a lot of 
families. This is not some theoretical 
negotiation. This is a problem. 
Why we would say to the Russians, 
‘‘Negotiate on our behalf,’’ while they 
are slaughtering Ukrainians and we are 
sanctioning 
those 
same 
Russians. 
Makes no sense. But a deal that lifts 
the sanctions on the Iranian Revolu-
tionary Guard, on those that killed 
Americans in 1983 in Beirut, to give ac-
cess to missile technology and to look 
away from their terrorist activities 
with Hezbollah and Hamas and in 
Yemen and in multiple other places in 
the world is not a deal Americans 
should make. 
Mr. President, walk away from this. 
There is a reason that your own staff is 
walking out of the conversation—be-
cause you are headed the wrong way. 
CHINA 
Madam President, this body is also in 
the process of negotiating issues with 
China. 
I have had quite a few folks from 
Oklahoma who have caught me and 
have said: Hey, while the world is fo-
cused on Russia and Ukraine, have we 
taken our eye off the ball in China? 
I would pray we have not, and I con-
tinue to be able to encourage our Pen-
tagon and officials across our govern-
ment to not lose focus on Taiwan and 
to not lose focus on what is happening 
in trade agreements. 
Right now, the Senate is actually ne-
gotiating a bill dealing with China, and 
I have to tell you I didn’t support this 
bill and don’t. It is a quarter trillion 
dollars in new spending—a quarter tril-
lion. It is enormous in size, but the 
basic philosophy is, the Chinese have a 
state-controlled system for how they 
are putting out semiconductors and re-
search; so we should do that in Amer-
ica and invest a quarter trillion to try 
to keep up with them in the way they 
are doing it. 
Can I tell you? The United States and 
our free market system have raised up 
the greatest entrepreneurs the world 
has ever known in areas of research. 
There are quite a few areas wherein we 
have government and private sector co-
operation, both in disease research and 
in technology. There are all kinds of 
research that have happened that have 
been very successful in transitioning 
into marketable products. Yet a quar-
ter trillion dollars is a big number and 
philosophically shifts us into a very 
different structure of trying to be able 
to ‘‘keep up with the Chinese.’’ 
Now, I do have to grant that the Sen-
ate bill is much better than the House 
bill. The House put together a bill deal-
ing with China that is classic House of 
Representatives at this point. They 
sent over a bill to us that they called 
their China bill, but it actually uses 
the word ‘‘climate’’ in it more than it 
uses the word ‘‘China’’ in it. It actually 
authorizes $4 billion a year into the 
U.N. Green Climate Fund, which actu-
ally gives grants to Iran, China, and 
North Korea to help with their green 
transitions. 
The House bill—also, again, their 
China bill—has a whole section in it on 
providing access to financial institu-
tions for marijuana. Now, if you are 
wondering why marijuana banking is 
ending up in the China bill, so am I. 
The only thing I can come up with is, 
if you are nervous about China, smoke 
some weed, and you will be more re-
laxed, I guess. I am not sure why that 
ends up in the China bill—to have a 
whole marijuana section in the United 
States on it. 
A meaningful China bill would focus 
in on critical minerals, which neither 
bill does. All of us see the supply chain 
issues that are happening with China 
right now. We all see it, but neither 
bill actually deals with the serious

issues that we have with critical min-
erals and rare Earth minerals. As to 
some of the areas on critical minerals, 
China has access to 85 percent of them, 
and we are not responding to that. 
That is a problem. 
The bill itself—the quarter trillion 
that is spent—actually exposes us even 
more 
to 
Chinese 
debt. 
Ironically 
enough, to be able to pay for this bill, 
we are going to have to borrow money 
from China to compete with China. I 
find that a little ironic. 
It doesn’t address the Belt and Road 
Initiative. As China continues to be 
able to expand around the world by 
putting in airports, by putting in ports, 
and to be able to do its expansion 
through its own system, we are not ad-
dressing that nor even trying to focus 
in on just keeping a list. I even asked 
for the ability just for us to keep a list 
of all of the places into which China is 
actually expanding, and that is actu-
ally not included in the bill. 
Another area, like internet freedom 
for the people of Hong Kong, who are 
living under the oppression of China, is 
not included. 
Countering the Chinese influence in 
multilateral organizations, like the 
U.N., the World Bank, and the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, as China 
moves to put key positions in place so 
they control these multilateral organi-
zations—there is no push in this bill for 
this. 
There is no push to be able to push 
the Chinese off our college campuses, 
as they move Confucius Institutes onto 
our campuses in order to plant the Chi-
nese influence on those campuses. 
It also doesn’t deal with something 
as basic as agriculture. Now, why do I 
bring up agriculture? Because the Chi-
nese are purchasing land all over the 
United States, especially in my State, 
as they snap up private land and start 
to do activities there wherein they own 
that land, control that land, and de-
velop it. There are no CFIUS restric-
tions that deal with Chinese espionage 
dealing with agriculture at all, and 
this bill doesn’t address that. I see that 
as a problem. 
We need expansive, very engaged 
issues to be able to deal with China. 
China is on the move. They are becom-
ing more and more aggressive. They 
continue to be more and more aggres-
sive as they deal with a multitude of 
issues—everything 
from 
agriculture 
and all the way through biotech engi-
neering, chemistry, the ownership of 
intellectual property, the theft of in-
tellectual property. They continue to 
be able to move across our supply 
chain to be able to dominate things 
worldwide. We need to address that. 
This fails to do those critical things. 
Now, does it take some steps? Yes, it 
does, but we are not even debating the 
other issues. We are not even dis-
cussing them. We are conferencing 
with a House bill that focuses more on 
climate than it does on China and that 
focuses on marijuana banking more 
than it does on the supply chain. We 
have got to get serious on these issues 
for the sake of our children and our 
freedom in the days ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
NOMINATION OF ALVARO M. BEDOYA 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
rise this evening to urge my colleagues 
to oppose the nomination of Alvaro 
Bedoya to be a Commissioner of the 
Federal Trade Commission. 
Recently, the Commerce Committee 
deadlocked on this nomination, with 
all Republican members voting no and 
all Democratic members voting yes. So 
it will take a discharge petition here 
on the Senate floor to move Mr. 
Bedoya’s nomination further. If our 
Democratic colleagues are successful, 
Mr. Bedoya will become the fifth tie- 
breaking Commissioner of the FTC. 
Let me just observe, as someone who 
has been on the Commerce Committee 
for years and years here in the U.S. 
Senate, that the Federal Trade Com-
mission, which is where Mr. Bedoya 
would become a member, has always 
approached issues and addressed the 
public in a spirit of bipartisanship. 
Unlike with the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, the FCC, where we 
are used to the vote being 2 to 3, in a 
very partisan manner—that is the FCC 
for you—we haven’t had that, over 
time, with the Federal Trade Commis-
sion. The Federal Trade Commission 
has had a tradition of bipartisanship. 
They have had a tradition of issuing 
policy statements with all five of them 
participating and issuing statements to 
the Commerce Committee, before testi-
mony, with the one statement speak-
ing for the entire Federal Trade Com-
mission. 
Mr. Bedoya’s records show that he 
would bring that sort of partisanship 
that we have had at the FCC to the 
Federal Trade Commission, and I hope 
we can avoid that. As a matter of fact, 
Mr. Bedoya has publicly supported 
eliminating the longstanding bipar-
tisan policy statements, and he has ad-
vocated for excluding minority party 
Commissioners from Agency investiga-
tions. This would be a troubling step 
for a Commission that has been bipar-
tisan. 
Mr. Bedoya has a long history of divi-
sive social media statements. For ex-
ample, he called for the elimination of 
the U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement Agency. He has called for 
the elimination of ICE. That is how ex-
treme and out in left field this nomi-
nee, Alvaro Bedoya, is. He has called 
on local law enforcement agencies not 
to cooperate with ICE. So, if you are a 
local police department, just don’t co-
operate with the Federal Agency in 
charge of immigration and customs en-
forcement. He has accused Cabinet- 
level 
Departments 
of 
committing 
human rights abuses. He has even de-
manded that several of our colleagues 
here in the U.S. Senate resign. 
He is a hothead, plainly said—more 
appropriate for a talk radio host of the 
far left rather than the fifth vote on 
the Federal Trade Commission. 
Additionally, as the Judiciary Com-
mittee continues to consider a Su-
preme Court nomination, I think it is 
instructive to recall that, in the fall of 
2020, this nominee, Mr. Bedoya, urged 
Senate Democrats to boycott the Judi-
ciary Committee’s hearings on the 
nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to 
serve on the Supreme Court. 
Now, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle would be outraged if Repub-
lican members of the Judiciary Com-
mittee actually refused to attend the 
committee’s hearings which occurred 
last week. This is exactly what Mr. 
Bedoya, the FTC nominee, called on 
the Democrats to do just 18 months 
ago. Clearly, he is out of the main-
stream. 
This is not the temperament we need 
to send to the FTC, particularly at a 
time when the Agency’s current leader-
ship has pursued a more partisan agen-
da as of late. We need to get away from 
that trend. 
Then, 
beyond 
temperament, 
Mr. 
Bedoya has demonstrated a lack of ex-
perience and a lack of knowledge on 
the major policy areas that he would 
be responsible for regulating as an FTC 
Commissioner. Although the FTC is 
the Nation’s premier regulator of con-
sumer privacy, Mr. Bedoya’s experience 
on the topic of privacy comes from his 
time on the staff of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee. There, he largely dealt 
with issues of government surveillance, 
which falls outside the FTC’s jurisdic-
tion. So even the limited experience 
Mr. Bedoya has gives him no help in 
dealing with Federal Trade Commis-
sion issues. 
Through the Commerce Committee’s 
vetting process, Mr. Bedoya has also 
shown a limited knowledge of the com-
petition and antitrust issues that are 
at the heart of today’s major policy de-
bates at the FTC. 
I don’t want the FTC to lack a tie- 
breaking vote forever—that is not the 
reason every Republican on the Com-
merce Committee voted no—but I do 
want the Agency to be able to tackle 
these important issues: to rein in Big 
Tech’s dominance of so many market-
places; to support a 21st century econ-
omy that spurs innovation; and to pro-
tect consumers from fraud and other 
unfair and deceptive business prac-
tices. I want the FTC to return to its 
traditional standing as an Agency driv-
en by bipartisanship and as an Agency 
that can be counted on to use its broad 
authority with a steady hand and a 
measured approach. 
I do not believe Mr. Bedoya is the 
right person to do this. I do not believe 
someone with his temperament and 
lack of experience and lack of knowl-
edge about the issues will be able to 
put the Federal Trade Commission 
back on track. 
For those reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support any effort to dis-
charge Mr. Bedoya’s nomination from 
the Commerce Committee to the Sen-
ate floor.

TRIBUTE TO DR. RIMA KHABBAZ 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
rise today to extend my most sincere 
gratitude to Rima Khabbaz, MD, the 
director of the National Center for 
Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Dis-
eases. Dr. Khabbaz is retiring after 
spending 38 years at NCEZID, where 
her work focused on fighting the spread 
of infectious diseases. 
For the past 5 years at NCEZID, Dr. 
Khabbaz has led staff who monitor and 
work to control dangerous pathogens 
in the United States and across the 
world. Her time as NCEZID director 
concludes three decades of leadership 
at the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, which is headquartered in 
the great State of Georgia, beginning 
with her role as chief of the Human Ep-
idemiology and Surveillance Unit in 
CDC’s Hantavirus Task Force in 1993 
and 1994. 
Dr. Khabbaz began her career at CDC 
as an epidemic intelligence service offi-
cer in CDC’s Hospital Infections Pro-
gram from 1980 through 1982. She re-
turned to CDC in 1986 and a year later 
became a medical epidemiologist in the 
Retrovirus Diseases Branch. She quick-
ly took up leadership roles in historic 
outbreak responses, including those for 
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, an-
thrax, SARS, monkeypox, Ebola, Zika, 
and COVID–19. 
Over the past two decades, Dr. 
Khabbaz has led CDC’s infectious dis-
ease activities through some turbulent 
times and at the highest levels. She 
was CDC’s deputy director for infec-
tious diseases and director of the Office 
of Infectious Diseases from 2010 to 2017, 
where she also temporarily served in 
dual roles as interim acting director of 
the National Center for Immunization 
and Respiratory Diseases and interim 
acting director of the National Center 
for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, 
and TB Prevention. 
Previously, she has served as director 
of the National Center for Prepared-
ness, Detection, and Control of Infec-
tious Diseases; director, acting direc-
tor, and associate director for epi-
demiologic science in the National 
Center for Infectious Diseases; and dep-
uty director and associate director for 
medical science in NCID’s Division of 
Viral and Rickettsial Diseases. 
Dr. 
Khabbaz’s 
departure 
from 
NCEZID marks the end of a truly dis-
tinguished career. She will be espe-
cially missed by her colleagues, who 
unfailingly describe her as an exceed-
ingly insightful and caring leader. Dr. 
Khabbaz’s contributions to the health 
of the State of Georgia, the United 
States, and the world are greatly ap-
preciated. I wish her a restorative and 
gratifying retirement following her 
nearly 40 years of government service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1830 
March 29, 2022 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO GABRYELLE PERKINS 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the distinct honor of rec-
ognizing Gabryelle Perkins of Sweet 
Grass County as Montanan of the 
Month for her devotion to the Big Tim-
ber community and her passion for 
educating and supporting young Mon-
tanans both in and out of the class-
room. 
Gabby was born and raised in the 
great State of Montana and, like my-
self, is a proud graduate of Montana 
State University—‘‘Go Cats!’’ Upon 
wrapping up her studies at MSU, Gabby 
earned a degree in English education 
and a minor in writing. For the past 11 
years, Gabby—or as her students know 
her, Ms. Perkins—has taught English 
at Sweet Grass County High School. 
Her passion for working with stu-
dents extends far beyond the class-
room. Gabby encourages her students 
to be involved in extracurricular ac-
tivities that have a positive impact on 
Big Timber and Sweet Grass County. 
Every year, she works with her stu-
dents to put on a play for their commu-
nity. When Gabby isn’t helping her stu-
dents on the stage or serving as a stu-
dent council adviser, she leads a volun-
teer group for Montana students to 
give back. Gabby’s students involved in 
SAVY, also known as Serving and Vol-
unteering Youth, participate in local 
coat and food drives, leadership work-
shops, recycling programs, and fund-
raising events. The SAVY group also 
develops resources to help provide 
clothes or food for students in need. 
I have no doubt that Gabby’s stu-
dents and everyone in Big Timber are 
grateful for her commitment to sup-
porting young Montanans. It is because 
of teachers like Ms. Perkins that Mon-
tana has the best and brightest stu-
dents in the Nation. It is my honor to 
recognize Ms. Perkins for her devotion 
to supporting young Montanans in and 
out of the classroom. Keep up the great 
work, Gabby.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DAVID URE 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize a remarkable 
Utahn who recently announced his re-
tirement after a long and fruitful ca-
reer for our great State. David Ure will 
conclude his civil service following his 
tenure as director of the Utah School 
and Institutional Trust Lands Admin-
istration, SITLA. 
David’s career in public service began 
with his election to the Utah House of 
Representatives in 1993. A dairyman 
and rancher by trade, he successfully 
balanced his legislative responsibilities 
with his livelihood, an accomplishment 
underscored by his Summit County’s 
1996 Rancher of the Year award. As a 
legislator, David was instrumental in 
guiding many pieces of legislation to 
the Governor’s desk, and after spending 
more than a decade in the statehouse, 
he continued his public service on the 
Summit County Council before joining 
the SITLA board of trustees. 
In 2016, Governor Herbert appointed 
David to serve as SITLA’s director. 
The independent State agency, created 
to generate funds for Utah’s school-
children and other trust beneficiaries, 
flourished under David’s stewardship. 
In this role, he led the agency’s oper-
ations and administrative functions, 
including a myriad of energy initia-
tives and real estate development 
projects. During David’s tenure as di-
rector, SITLA’s trust grew by 40 per-
cent and added over a billion dollars to 
the significant benefit of Utah’s public 
education system, State institutions, 
and communities in need. 
David has also served on a number of 
important State boards, including the 
Weber Basin Conservation District, 
Intermountain Healthcare board of 
trustees for the Heber Valley Hospital, 
the Park City Chamber of Commerce, 
and the National Association of State 
Trust Lands. 
Thank you, Dave, for your out-
standing career of public service to 
Utah. Your accomplishments will con-
tinue to yield positive outcomes for in-
dividuals, families, and communities 
across the State, and they will bright-
en the lives and livelihoods of genera-
tions untold.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself,

Mr. CASSIDY, Mrs. FEINSTEIN,

Mr.

S. 3950. A bill to establish the Baltic 
Security and Economic Enhancement 
Initiative for the purpose of increasing 
security and economic ties with the 
Baltic countries and to establish the 
Baltic Security Initiative for the pur-
pose of deepening security cooperation 
with the Baltic countries, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, Senator ROB PORTMAN of 
Ohio and I are cochairs of the bipar-
tisan Senate Ukraine Caucus. Tomor-
row, we are hosting a meeting for Sen-
ators with members of the Ukrainian 
Parliament. The Parliament there is 
known as the Rada. They are coming 
to Washington to discuss how we can 
help even more in assisting the valiant 
people of Ukraine defending against 
this barbaric invasion by Vladimir 
Putin. I hope our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle will join us to send a 
clear message to Ukraine that we stand 
united in their efforts. 
Putin’s unprovoked and unconscion-
able war on Ukraine has revealed what 
he is really all about. He is a tyrant 
seething with resentment, driven by 
delusions of great mother Russia, will-
ing to slaughter innocent men, women, 
and children to restore a lost Russian 
Empire.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1834 
March 29, 2022 
We know from his current ravings 
and his past actions, Putin’s ruthless 
pursuit of Russia’s lost empire didn’t 
begin with this war, and if we don’t do 
something about it, it won’t end there 
either. 
In 2003, the people of Georgia—an-
other Soviet Republic—waged a Rose 
Revolution to claim a place among the 
family of democratic nations. Putin’s 
aggrieved response was to send troops 
into that country to occupy portions of 
it—South Ossetia and Abkhazia—to re-
draw Georgia’s national boundaries by 
force. I traveled to that area in 2012 
and saw firsthand what Putin’s occupa-
tion of that tiny nation meant. 
In 2014, the people of Ukraine rose up 
to demand change as well—the Revolu-
tion of Dignity, they called it. They 
succeeded and threw out the deeply 
corrupt 
Russian-backed 
President. 
They ousted him from Parliament. 
When they did, he fled to Moscow, his 
real home. Putin’s revenge months 
later was to send Russian troops to in-
vade and annex the Crimean peninsula 
and the Donbas regions of eastern 
Ukraine by force. They have continued 
to wage that war. 
I have mentioned many times my 
concern for this region, and I guess it 
is attached to the fact that my mother 
was born in Lithuania and came here 
as a little girl. Her family fled from the 
oppression of czarist Russia, which 
then controlled the Baltic States and 
far beyond. 
During World War II, the Baltic 
States endured brutal Nazi occupation, 
and after the war, they were held cap-
tive behind the Iron Curtain by the 
USSR. 
In August 1989, 2 months before the 
fall of the Berlin Wall, 2 million people 
in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia 
physically, literally, joined hands in a 
peaceful protest. They formed a human 
chain, declared that they wanted to 
join Europe and be part of the family of 
democracies. 
Two years later, the Baltics threw off 
Russian occupiers and reclaimed their 
independence. It was a festive day. I 
was honored to be a witness to part of 
it. They worked to achieve the reform 
fundamental to democracies, to weed 
out 
corruption, 
establish 
market 
economies, and encourage the growth 
of civil society. 
In 2004, in a historic moment, a live- 
or-die moment for the Baltics, they be-
came part of NATO. It was the first 
time—the very first time that NATO 
had opened its doors to nations that 
had been part of the Soviet Union. Over 
the years, the Baltic States strength-
ened their militaries to prove they 
would be assets and not liabilities to 
the alliance. 
Today, the Baltics provide a home to 
activists and dissidents from Russia 
and Belarus and are a beacon of democ-
racy. And I say that with personal 
pride to have any association with 
these great nations. 
In 2008, after Russia had annexed 
parts of Georgia, the President of Po-
land visited Georgia’s capital of Tbilisi 
and warned of the threat posed by Rus-
sia to the entire region. He said: 
Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine, the day 
after tomorrow—the Baltic States and, later, 
perhaps, time will come for [his] country, 
Poland. 
Well, today, Senator GRASSLEY and I 
are introducing a bill to discourage 
Russia from extending Putin’s war into 
NATO territory and forcing the alli-
ance to invoke its article 5 collective 
security commitment. 
Our bill is called the Baltic Defense 
and Deterrence Act. It directs the De-
partment of State and the Department 
of Defense to establish and implement 
economic and security initiatives to 
deepen U.S. ties with the Baltic States. 
Our bill will strengthen our strong 
partnership. It will enhance the capa-
bility of the region’s critical allies in 
NATO’s eastern flank to respond to 
threats, including Russia’s misinforma-
tion and disinformation, their cyber 
warfare, and, in Lithuania’s case, grow-
ing economic pressure. 
Cosponsors come from both sides of 
the aisle: Senators STABENOW, KING, 
FEINSTEIN, BLUNT, BLUMENTHAL, BALD-
WIN, DUCKWORTH, BOOKER, and Senator 
SCOTT
of 
Florida. 
Representatives 
RUBEN GALLEGO and DON BACON are co-
sponsoring a bipartisan companion bill 
in the House. 
In conclusion, in 1997, Russian Presi-
dent Boris Yeltsin offered the Baltic 
States unilateral security guarantees if 
they would give up aspirations to join 
NATO. They refused. They were deter-
mined to become their own sovereign 
states, their own democracy, and they 
have succeeded. 
Kurt Volker, former U.S. Ambas-
sador to NATO and former U.S. Special 
Representative to Ukraine, has said 
that, far from being a burden on NATO, 
the admission of Latvia, Lithuania, 
and Estonia has reinvigorated the alli-
ance. In his words, the Baltic States 
turned out to be ‘‘the best democratic 
and economic reformers, the ones most 
committed to build fresh new mili-
taries, and the ones willing to support 
the U.S. in other fora.’’ 
They have sent troops on costly U.S. 
missions, and their troops have fought 
and died alongside NATO forces in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. By securing Amer-
ica’s economic and security partner-
ships with the Baltics, our bill will 
help deter Vladimir Putin from extend-
ing his barbaric war into NATO terri-
tory. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3950

resentatives of the United States of America in

Russian 
Federation’s 
illegal 
and 
unprovoked war in Ukraine that began on 
February 24, 2022;

Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. 
CASSIDY) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 559 
Whereas Ukraine declared independence 
from the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991, 
and that independence was reaffirmed in a 
popular referendum on December 1, 1991; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the Russian 
military invaded the sovereign country of 
Ukraine under the direction of President of 
the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘Putin’’), car-
rying out attacks on cities with ballistic 
missiles, heavy artillery, and tanks; 
Whereas Protocol I to the Geneva Conven-
tions includes the Protection of Victims of 
International Armed Conflicts, prohibiting 
attacks on civilian persons and populations, 
and defines journalists and war correspond-
ents as civilians; 
Whereas the Russian Federation was an 
original signatory to the Geneva Conven-
tions until Putin removed the Russian Fed-
eration from Protocol in October 2019, dem-
onstrating a clear disregard for innocent life; 
Whereas, as of March 29, 2022, thousands of 
civilians, including children, are recorded as 
having been killed during the Russian Fed-
eration’s invasion of Ukraine; 
Whereas journalists and news staff are on 
the ground in Ukraine, reporting freelance, 
reporting for global networks and media, and 
working on documentary efforts to record 
the ongoing humanitarian crisis and war 
caused by the Russian Federation’s invasion 
of the sovereign country of Ukraine; 
Whereas many of the journalists and news 
staff covering the war in Ukraine are United 
States citizens or working for United States 
news agencies; 
Whereas shelling by Russian Federation 
forces has included the shelling of humani-
tarian 
corridors, 
maternity 
hospitals, 
schools, and other primarily civilian loca-
tions; 
Whereas journalists and news staff are on 
the ground along Russian-targeted humani-
tarian corridors and in major cities across 
Ukraine; 
Whereas dozens of members of the free 
press have been murdered or injured by Rus-
sian Federation forces as of March 29, 2022, 
with more casualties and injuries likely; 
Whereas, on February 26, 2022, Danish jour-
nalist Stefan Weichert was shot and wounded

News camera operator Richie Mockler was 
shot and wounded when his car was am-
bushed by Russian soldiers in Kyiv, Ukraine;

journalist and camera operator Yevhenii 
Sakun was killed when Russian Federation 
forces shelled a television tower in Kyiv,

arms fire; 
Whereas, on March 15, 2022, United States 
Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall was 
wounded when his vehicle was struck by in-
coming arms fire in Horenka, Ukraine; 
Whereas it is possible that additional 
Ukrainian and foreign press have been or 
will be injured and killed so long as Russian 
Federation forces continue their brutal at-
tack on civilians; 
Whereas all civilians, including journalists 
and news staff, should be spared violence by 
military forces; 
Whereas Putin and his cronies have dem-
onstrated complete disregard for innocent 
life, the sovereignty of Ukraine, the right to 
free speech, and the rights and value of a free 
press; 
Whereas Putin is engaged in a propaganda 
war, as well as a military war, and the Rus-
sian Federation continues to push a false 
narrative about Russian military presence in 
Ukraine; 
Whereas the United States supports a free 
and fair press and rejects any and all propa-
gandist efforts by the Russian Federation to 
cover up and hide the truth behind the Rus-
sian Federation’s invasion;

ground in Ukraine who are reporting the 
truth to the world, including journalists and 
news staff from the United States, are in-
strumental in combating false propaganda 
pushed by Putin and his cronies; and 
Whereas, despite the overwhelming threat 
and risk to their lives and the sacrifices al-
ready made, journalists and news staff con-
tinue to report bravely from Ukraine: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) declares its gratitude on behalf of the 
people of the United States to the journalists 
and news staff who continue to put them-
selves in harm’s way to report on the human-
itarian crisis and ongoing war on the ground 
in Ukraine following the Russian Federa-
tion’s invasion; 
(2) remembers the journalists and news 
staff who have lost their lives or have been 
severely injured reporting from Ukraine and 
conveys the sympathies and appreciation of 
the people of the United States to their fami-
lies for their sacrifice; 
(3) condemns President of the Russian Fed-
eration Vladimir Putin, President of the Re-
public of Belarus Aleksander Lukashenko, 
and their officials for authorizing and exe-
cuting attacks on innocent Ukrainian civil-
ians, residential areas, and humanitarian 
corridors, resulting in the loss of life of civil-
ians, including journalists and news staff; 
and 
(4) honors the contributions of journalists 
and news staff reporting from the war in 
Ukraine as essential in the ongoing struggle 
for the rights of a free press and free speech 
internationally, pivotal in pushing back 
against false propaganda by tyrants, and 
crucial to informing the people of the United 
States and the world of the horrors being 
wrought against the Ukrainian people.

S1836 
March 29, 2022 
Whereas the only way currently available 
to be certain of an endometriosis diagnosis is 
to have a surgical procedure known as a 
laparoscopy; 
Whereas the primary symptoms of endo-
metriosis include pain and infertility, and 
many women with endometriosis live with 
debilitating, chronic pain; 
Whereas symptoms of anxiety and depres-
sion are common among women with the 
endometriosis, with reported rates as high as 
75 to 90 percent; 
Whereas, although endometriosis is one of 
the most common gynecological disorders in 
the United States, there is a lack of aware-
ness and prioritization of endometriosis as 
an important health issue for women; 
Whereas women can suffer for up to 10 
years before being properly diagnosed; 
Whereas 
approximately 
75 
percent 
of 
women with endometriosis experience a mis-
diagnosis; 
Whereas endometriosis is 1 of the 3 main 
causes of female infertility, and between 30 
and 50 percent of women with endometriosis 
experience infertility; 
Whereas health care providers must focus 
on 
managing 
the 
symptoms 
of 
endo-
metriosis, which may include in vitro fer-
tilization (IVF), low-dose oral contracep-
tives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), pain-
killers, including nonsteriodal anti-inflam-
matory drugs (NSAIDs), and gonadotropin- 
releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy; 
Whereas endometriosis is associated with 
increased health care costs and poses a sub-
stantial burden to patients in the health 
care system; 
Whereas, in the United States, the esti-
mated average direct health care cost associ-
ated with endometriosis per patient is more 
than $13,000 per year; 
Whereas 40 percent of women with endo-
metriosis report impaired career growth due 
to endometriosis, and approximately 50 per-
cent of women with endometriosis experi-
ence a decreased ability to work; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention found that the average num-
ber of ‘‘bed days’’ for patients with endo-
metriosis was 18 days per year; 
Whereas women with endometriosis can 
lose 11 hours per workweek through lost pro-
ductivity; 
Whereas the physical and psychological 
impact of endometriosis affects all domains 
of life, including social life, relationships, 
and work; 
Whereas medical societies and patient 
groups have expressed the need for greater 
public attention and updated resources tar-
geted to public education about this unmet 
health need for women; 
Whereas there is a need for more research 
and 
updated 
guidelines 
to 
treat 
endo-
metriosis; 
Whereas there is an ongoing need for addi-
tional clinical research and treatment op-
tions to manage this debilitating disease;

Whereas there is no known cure for endo-
metriosis: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) 
designates 
March 
2022 
as 
‘‘Endo-

(2) recognizes the importance of endo-
metriosis as a health issue for women that 
requires far greater attention, public aware-
ness, and education about the disease; 
(3) encourages the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, the Secretary of Defense, 
and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs— 
(A) to provide information to women, pa-
tients, and health care providers with re-
spect to endometriosis, including available 
screening tools and treatment options, with 
a goal of improving the quality of life and 
health outcomes of women affected by endo-
metriosis; 
(B) to conduct additional research on endo-
metriosis and possible clinical options; and

Mr. 
DAINES, 
Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, 
Mr. 
MERKLEY, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. PADILLA,

lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 561 
Whereas dangerous asbestos fibers are in-
visible and cannot be smelled or tasted; 
Whereas the inhalation of airborne asbes-
tos fibers can cause significant damage; 
Whereas asbestos fibers can cause cancer, 
such as mesothelioma, asbestosis, and other 
health problems; 
Whereas symptoms of asbestos-related dis-
eases can take between 10 and 50 years to 
present themselves; 
Whereas the projected life expectancy for 
an individual diagnosed with mesothelioma 
is between 6 and 24 months; 
Whereas little is known about late-stage 
treatment of asbestos-related diseases, and 
there is no cure for those diseases; 
Whereas early detection of asbestos-re-
lated diseases might give some patients in-
creased treatment options and might im-
prove the prognoses of those patients; 
Whereas, although the consumption of as-
bestos within the United States has been 
substantially reduced, the United States 
continues to consume tons of the fibrous 
mineral each year for use in certain prod-
ucts; 
Whereas thousands of people in the United 
States have died from asbestos-related dis-
eases, and thousands more die every year 
from those diseases; 
Whereas, although individuals continue to 
be exposed to asbestos, safety measures re-
lating to, and the prevention of, asbestos ex-
posure have significantly reduced the inci-
dence of asbestos-related diseases and can 
further reduce the incidence of those dis-
eases; 
Whereas thousands of workers in the 
United States face significant asbestos expo-
sure, which has been a cause of occupational 
cancer; 
Whereas a significant percentage of vic-
tims of asbestos-related diseases were ex-
posed to asbestos on naval ships and in ship-
yards; 
Whereas asbestos was used in the construc-
tion of a significant number of office build-
ings and public facilities built before 1975; 
Whereas people in the small community of 
Libby, Montana, suffer from asbestos-related 
diseases, including mesothelioma, at a sig-
nificantly higher rate than people in the 
United States as a whole; and 
Whereas the designation of a ‘‘National As-
bestos Awareness Week’’ will raise public 
awareness about the prevalence of asbestos- 
related diseases and the dangers of asbestos 
exposure: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the first week of April 2022 
as ‘‘National Asbestos Awareness Week’’; 
(2) urges the Surgeon General to warn and 
educate people about the public health issue 
of asbestos exposure, which may be haz-
ardous to their health; and 
(3) respectfully requests that the Secretary 
of the Senate transmit a copy of this resolu-
tion to the Office of the Surgeon General.

Whereas, in addition to leading farming 
operations, women working in agriculture 
make a difference across the United States

the Cooperative Extension System, and nu-
merous postsecondary agricultural science 
educator programs; 
Whereas March is National Women’s His-

NIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF

CER AND THE IMPORTANCE OF 
COMMISSION 
ON 
CANCER-AC-
CREDITED PROGRAMS IN ENSUR-
ING 
COMPREHENSIVE, 
HIGH- 
QUALITY, 
PATIENT-CENTERED 
CANCER CARE 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN (for himself and 
Mr. MARSHALL) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 566 
Whereas the Commission on Cancer was es-
tablished by the American College of Sur-
geons in 1922 as a consortium of professional 
organizations dedicated to improving sur-
vival rates and quality of life for cancer pa-
tients through standard setting, which pro-
motes cancer prevention, research, edu-
cation, and monitoring of comprehensive 
quality care; 
Whereas the Commission on Cancer is com-
prised of individuals and representatives of 
more than 50 cancer-related organizations; 
Whereas the Commission on Cancer estab-
lishes standards to ensure quality, multi-
disciplinary, and comprehensive cancer care 
delivery in health care settings; 
Whereas the Commission on Cancer con-
ducts surveys in health care settings to as-
sess compliance with those standards; 
Whereas the Commission on Cancer col-
lects standardized data from Commission on 
Cancer-accredited health care settings to 
measure cancer care quality; 
Whereas the Commission on Cancer uses 
data to monitor treatment patterns and out-
comes, and enhance cancer control and clin-
ical surveillance activities; 
Whereas the Commission on Cancer devel-
ops effective educational interventions to 
improve cancer prevention, early detection, 
cancer care delivery, and outcomes in health 
care settings; 
Whereas the Commission on Cancer has ac-
credited more than 1,500 cancer programs in 
the United States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico; 
Whereas accreditation from the American 
College of Surgeons is a voluntary commit-
ment by a cancer program that ensures pa-
tients will have access to the full scope of 
services required to diagnose, treat, rehabili-
tate, and support patients with cancer and 
their families; 
Whereas accreditation allows cancer pro-
grams to continually evaluate performance 
and take proactive, corrective actions when 
necessary; 
Whereas continuous evaluation reaffirms 
the commitment of the cancer program to 
provide high-quality, patient-centered can-
cer care; 
Whereas accreditation is regarded as im-
portant in improving oncologic outcomes 
through compliance with standards that in-
clude continuous quality improvement; 
Whereas quality standards required for ac-
creditation ensure that patients receive 
comprehensive care with a multidisciplinary 
team approach to coordinate the best avail-
able treatment options; 
Whereas patients treated by accredited 
cancer programs receive information about 
ongoing cancer clinical trials and new treat-
ment options and access to a cancer database 
that offers lifelong patient follow-up; 
Whereas accreditation promotes access to 
prevention and early detection programs, 
cancer education, and support services; 
Whereas patients treated in accredited 
cancer programs have access to the full con-
tinuum of patient-centered care, including 
distress screening, patient navigation, and 
delivery of survivorship care plans that de-
tail treatments received and provide detailed 
information on future care needs; 
Whereas accreditation requires evaluation 
of the entire scope, organization, and activ-
ity of a cancer program by external peer re-
view from specially trained surveyors who 
evaluate compliance with stringent stand-
ards designed to promote high-quality care; 
Whereas the quality reporting tools from 
the over 30,000,000 cases reported to the Com-
mission on Cancer’s National Cancer Data-
base provide feedback needed to initiate 
quality improvement studies, which ulti-
mately lead to implementation of quality 
improvements in accredited cancer pro-
grams; 
Whereas the cancer accreditation pro-
grams of the American College of Surgeons 
use data submitted to such Database to 
verify and improve quality of care in cancer 
programs and to further scientific research; 
and 
Whereas the American College of Surgeons 
accredited cancer programs in the United 
States and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico care for approximately 70 percent of 
newly diagnosed cancer patients in the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 
100th anniversary of the American College of 
Surgeons Commission on Cancer and the im-
portance of Commission on Cancer-accred-
ited programs in ensuring comprehensive, 
high-quality, patient-centered cancer care.

NOMINATION OF ALVARO M. 
BEDOYA 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
thank the leader for mentioning the 
move to have a vote on Alvaro Bedoya 
to be Commissioner of the Federal 
Trade Commission. This is such an im-
portant task, and I know that the lead-
er probably knows that Mr. Bedoya 
hails from New York, but it also must 
be a very proud moment for him as 
well. 
The FTC is the security guard for 
America’s consumers. If a company is 
lying to its customers about their 
products and what they can do or 
teaming up with competitors to keep 
prices high, the FTC is the policeman 
on the beat, saying those things are 
not allowed here. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator 
from Washington yield for a minute? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Yes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I want to thank the 
Senator for her leadership on this 
issue. 
We all know that we have seen prices 
go way up. We also all suspect that a 
lot of it is due to different kinds of 
gouging and manipulation. The FTC is

about the best Agency to look for this, 
but without Mr. Bedoya on the FTC, 
the chair and the members would be 
handicapped in moving that forward. 
This is a really important motion to 
discharge. 
I hope anyone who cares about infla-
tion and rising prices and collusion and 
all kinds of manipulation to prevent 
those prices from coming back down 
should be voting for this motion to dis-
charge and the nomination. 
Once again, the Senator from Wash-
ington has led the way on this issue, 
and I salute her. This is a very, very 
important motion to discharge. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
thank the majority leader for that con-
cise documentation of what really the 
FTC is about. It is about getting some-
body on there who is going to fight to 
protect consumers on issues. 
We know that we need the FTC now 
more than ever. We needed their mus-
cle during the COVID pandemic, as op-
portunistic scammers stole $5.9 billion 
out of the pockets of Americans, and 
that is just the reported amount. That 
doesn’t include people who never knew 
that they were scammed or were too 
embarrassed to report what happened. 
So Congress, on a bipartisan basis, 
pumped up the FTC’s power, and at the 
end of 2020, we passed the COVID–19 
Consumer Protection Act to help root 
out promoters of dangerous, fake treat-
ments and cures. 
Second, we gave the FTC $30 million 
in the American Rescue Plan to pro-
mote and protect Americans against 
scams that targeted their COVID stim-
ulus payments. 
Last year, we confirmed the FTC 
Chair, Lina Khan, with support from 21 
Republicans in this body, and today we 
are talking about the next important 
step in protecting consumers, and that 
is moving to confirm Mr. Bedoya to fill 
the last seat on the Federal Trade 
Commission. 
Mr. Bedoya has the right experience 
we need to tackle the problems that we 
are facing right now—some of the most 
complicated and pressing issues regard-
ing how to protect our privacy and pro-
tect children’s online privacy. I say 
that because I heard comments from 
my colleague about Mr. Bedoya and the 
fact that he issued various tweets 
about this or that in his time in the 
private sector. 
I guarantee you that if we voted for 
people based on what their tweets are, 
there would be a lot of people who 
wouldn’t be approved at all, including 
some of the people who have been 
through this process. 
Mr. Bedoya served as the chief coun-
sel of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Sub-
committee on Privacy, Technology, 
and Law. So I would say that as it re-
lates to the FTC’s ability to do some-
thing about reining in some of the bad 
practices that we see online, I think he 
is a very qualified person and indi-
vidual. 
Mr. Bedoya graduated summa cum 
laude from Harvard and holds a law de-
gree from Yale, where he served on the 
Yale Law Journal and received the 
Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for 
New Americans. 
So I think that Mr. Bedoya is a per-
son who has dug in on a variety of 
issues and has the experience and lead-
ership in one of the most critical 
areas—technology—that the FTC is 
dealing with today. 
So I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port him. That is why he is supported 
by the current Republican FTC Com-
missioners. They also support his nom-
ination. They say they recognize his 
willingness and expertise and ability to 
reach across the aisle and find common 
ground on solutions that work for peo-
ple. 
It is that skill set that we are look-
ing for at the FTC to help hard-work-
ing Americans get a fair shake in the 
marketplace, whether that is at the 
pharmacy, the gas pump, or online. 
And I know that as a proud immi-
grant, Mr. Bedoya will also use his role 
to expand the FTC’s work in under-
served communities. 
The FTC needs to be able to protect 
all Americans, and to accomplish that, 
we need to have a Commission that is 
not deadlocked now but has somebody 
like Mr. Bedoya, who can help us move 
ahead on these issues. 
He has experience working, as I said, 
in the Judiciary Committee. In 2009, he 
cofounded the Esperanza Education 
Fund, an immigration status-blind col-
lege scholarship for immigrant stu-
dents, and has been working on various 
issues within the community. 
Right now, we need an FTC that is 
going to look at market systems and 
make sure there is fair competition to 
make sure that consumers are pro-
tected and that there is a level playing 
field. 
I think his experience here on the 
Hill lets him understand exactly what 
that is. He has testified before Con-
gress and State legislatures and ap-
peared in numbers of publications 
about these critical issues on privacy 
and on the online world in which we 
need to have more oversight. 
So, finally, Mr. Bedoya’s experience 
on, as I said, data privacy specifically, 
the internet and making it a safe place 
for children—he exposed racial bias in 
facial recognition software, helped to 
protect innocent people from prosecu-
tion and companies that have already 
collected data on millions of Ameri-
cans. We need that kind of expertise 
that Mr. Bedoya knows and under-
stands how we are using that today and 
what we can do to better protect the 
American consumer. 
I hope that my colleagues will join us 
to approve and move quickly to dis-
charge 
the 
committee 
of 
Alvaro 
Bedoya’s nomination to be a Commis-
sioner of the FTC and support his nom-
ination as we get this to the Senate 
floor. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MAJOR 
GENERAL BILLY NABORS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the service of Major 
General Billy Nabors whom I have had the 
pleasure of serving with in the Mississippi Na-
tional Guard. He is celebrating his retirement 
after 27 years of service and I wish him all the 
best in this exciting new chapter in life. 
Major General Nabors was commissioned 
through Officer Training School and graduated 
Undergraduate Pilot Training at Columbus Air 
Force Base in 1985. He holds a Bachelor of 
Science degree from Millsaps College in Jack-
son. He served eight years active duty as a 
T–37 instructor, Air Training Command, and 
KD–135C/R aircraft commander, Strategic Air 
Command. As of his retirement, he has served 
as the Assistant Adjutant General and Com-
mander, Mississippi Air National Guard. He is 
responsible to the Adjutant General for direct-
ing Air National Guard operations and estab-
lishing policy to ensure the combat readiness 
and mission capability of the 186th Air Refuel-
ing Wing, 172d Airlift Wing and Combat Read-
iness Training Center. Major General Nabors 
is a combat veteran of Desert Shield/Desert 
Storm, Kosovo and Enduring/Iraqi Freedom. 
Prior to his current role, General Nabors was 
the Chief of Staff, Mississippi Air National 
Guard. 
Major General Nabors has served on a wise 
variety of assignments and received numerous 
awards over the course of his career including 
the Legion of Merit Medal, Air Force Achieve-
ment Medal, the Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal, and the Mississippi War Medal 
with bronze star, just to name a few. 
I am grateful for Major General Nabors’s 
lifetime of service to the state of Mississippi 
and this nation. I join him, his family and loved 
ones in celebrating his retirement and wish 
him well.

HONORING VIETNAM VETERANS 
DAY 
HON. DARRELL ISSA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
celebration of Vietnam Veterans Day. 
For too long, the veterans of the Vietnam 
War did not receive the recognition or appre-
ciation of a grateful Nation that their service 
warranted and their commitment earned. 
With the adoption of March 29 as National 
Vietnam Veterans Day, we take another step 
to rectify that. Every year going forward, we 
will now honor those who answered the call of 
their country, left home for faraway lands, and 
held the line in what was then America’s long-
est war. 
Abraham Lincoln said: ‘‘The soldier puts his 
life at stake, and often yields it up in his coun-
try’s cause. The highest merit, then is due to 
the soldier.’’ These words and this special day 
honor the service, sacrifice, and steadfast spir-
it of the more than nine million Americans who 
made and kept an oath to stand strong for 
freedom around the world . . . and to ensure 
the success and survival of liberty. 
In 2020, I was proud to host Vietnam Vet-
eran recognition ceremonies throughout the 
50th District of California. Here, veterans, fam-
ily members and the community gathered to 
salute more than 300 veterans and express 
our gratitude for their efforts. 
We owe a debt beyond words to these vet-
erans who wore the Nation’s uniform, many of 
whom went halfway around the world, set 
records for courage and commitment, and 
served with indomitable courage. I am proud 
to rise today to commemorate Vietnam Vet-
erans Day for these courageous veterans and 
their service to our Nation.

Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a number of outstanding 
public school teachers in Florida’s 16th Con-

I was once told that children are 25 percent 
of the population, but they are 100 percent of 
the future. 
And it’s true. The education of a child is an 
investment, not only in that student, but in the 
future of our country. 
Therefore, I established the Congressional 
Teacher Awards to honor educators for their 
ability to teach and inspire students. 
An independent panel has chosen the fol-
lowing teachers from Manatee, Sarasota, and 
Hillsborough counties to receive Florida’s 16th 
District’s 2022 Congressional Teacher Awards 
for their accomplishments as educators: 
Victoria Adriano for her accomplishments as

IN RECOGNITION OF JOE 
SCALLORNS’ RETIREMENT 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
profound gratitude that I rise today as Mis-
souri’s Fifth Congressional District celebrates 
the decades-long career of an individual who 
has gone above and beyond for the people of 
Missouri and the men and women of our 
armed forces: Mr. Joe Scallorns. Joe’s dedica-
tion to his community is truly exemplary. 
Through more than thirty years as a commu-
nity banker, enthusiastic support for America’s 
military as an Air Force Civic Leader, and as 
a board member of several community organi-
zations, Joe has always put the needs of oth-
ers ahead of his own. 
Before he began his distinguished career, 
Joe was a student at the University of Mis-
souri and Rutgers University, where he stud-
ied business, finance, and banking. Recog-
nized for his exceptional leadership abilities, 
Joe went on to serve as the President and 
CEO of the Farmers and Traders Bank in Cali-
fornia, Missouri. His educational background, 
industry knowledge, and professional experi-
ence have proved useful and insightful during 
his time as a board member for the Whiteman 
Air Force Base Community Council, the Civic 
Leaders Group of Air Force Global Strike 
Command, and the Whiteman Area Leader-
ship Council. As a founding member of the 
Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C., a 
board member for the Strategic Deterrent Co-
alition, and President Emeritus of both groups, 
Joe has helped bridge the divide between the 
members of our nation’s military and the civil-
ian population they faithfully protect. 
Joe’s commitment to our armed forces is 
demonstrated in his numerous honors: the 
Secretary of the Air Force Distinguished Public 
Service Award, the Air Force Scroll of Appre-
ciation, and his designation as Honorary Chief 
Master Sergeant by Whiteman Air Force Base. 
His devotion and leadership, though, has ex-
tended to all manner of causes: the Rotary 
Club, the American Bankers Association, and 
the Missouri Girls Town Foundation. You 
name it, and Joe has played a role in it, all 
across our district. These deserved achieve-
ments are a testament to his love and passion 
for giving back. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in recognizing Joe for his tremen-
dous accomplishments, his wisdom, and his 
tireless community service. His enthusiasm is 
infectious; his service is a model for all of us. 
I speak with the voice of Missouri’s entire Fifth 
District as we say a heartfelt ‘‘thank you’’ to 
Mr. Joe Scallorns. I congratulate Joe on 
reaching the next chapter of his life. I wish him 
health and happiness in his well-earned retire-
ment.

CABIN AIR SAFETY ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce the ‘‘Cabin Air Safety Act,’’ with 
U.S. Senator RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D–CT). I 
thank the original cosponsors for their support 
of this critical legislation: U.S. Senators ED-
WARD J. MARKEY (D–MA) and DIANNE FEIN-
STEIN (D–CA) and Congressmen BRIAN K. 
FITZPATRICK (R–PA), KAIALI‘I KAHELE, (D–HI), 
and DON BACON (R–NE). 
All Americans have the right to expect safe, 
clean air when travelling or reporting to work. 
I am deeply concerned by the documented 
cases where pilots, flight attendants, and air-
line passengers have been incapacitated or 
even hospitalized following exposure to toxic 
cabin air. 
The ‘‘Cabin Air Safety Act’’ takes common-
sense steps to protect airline crewmembers 
and the traveling public from toxic fume 
events, which occur when air contaminated by 
engine exhaust, fuel fumes, deicing fluids, and 
ozone enters the aircraft cabin through the jet- 
engine intake or the auxiliary air intake at the 
stern of the aircraft when on the ground. Ex-
posure to even low levels of these contami-
nants can incapacitate passengers and crew. 
Long-term exposure could lead to serious, de-
bilitating health issues. 
Our bicameral, bipartisan legislation would 
better protect airline passengers and crew by 
mandating training on how to respond to toxic 
fumes, requiring the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration (FAA) to record and monitor reports of 
toxic fume events, ensuring that investigations 
occur following reported toxic fume events, 
and installing air quality monitoring equipment 
such as carbon monoxide sensors on com-
mercial aircraft as standard equipment. 
At the start of the global COVID–19 pan-
demic, the FAA under the Trump Administra-
tion claimed it could not set standards to en-
sure cabin air quality and protect public health. 
Our reintroduced ‘‘Cabin Air Safety Act’’ for 
this Congress makes clear that the FAA can 
indeed set standards for cabin air quality to 
safeguard the health of airline crewmembers 
and the traveling public. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of the 
House to join me in cosponsoring this bi-
cameral, bipartisan legislation. As a senior 
member of the House Transportation and In-
frastructure Subcommittee on Aviation, I plan 
to make the ‘‘Cabin Air Safety Act’’ a major 
priority in the next FAA reauthorization.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
GLENN ADAMS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the retirement of Lieu-
tenant Colonel Glenn Adams after 32 years of 
service to the United States and the State of 
Mississippi. I thank him for his dedication and 
wish him well in this new chapter. 
Over the course of his career, Lieutenant 
Colonel Adams has served in every leadership 
role within the Commissioned Officer Ranks, 
from a Bradley Track Commander to the 155th 
Armored Brigade Combat Team Executive Of-
ficer. He enlisted into the Mississippi Army Na-
tional Guard on March 25, 1989 in Det 1, 
Headquarters Company, 1–198th Armor, Ful-
ton, MS. LTC Adams served as an NCO until 
March 1992 and was commissioned as a 2LT 
in August 1992 as an Armor Officer. He re-

INTRODUCTION OF THE CEREBRAL 
PALSY RESEARCH PROGRAM ACT 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize March as Cerebral Palsy Aware-
ness Month and to urge my colleagues to sup-
port federal funding for cerebral palsy re-
search. 
Cerebral palsy is the most common life-long 
physical disability, occurring in approximately 
1 out of 345 children in the United States. It 
is also the most common disability that has no 
dedicated federal funding. 
No dedicated federal funding for cerebral 
palsy means there are fewer treatment op-
tions, less prevention, less education, and a 
lack of standards of care across the lifespan. 
Additionally, there is not a reliable system to 
count how many people in the U.S. have cere-
bral palsy, so the estimates on cerebral palsy 
prevalence are just that—estimates. 
I am working to change that and urge my 
colleagues to join me. Today, I introduced a 
bipartisan 
bill 
with 
Congressmen 
BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK and EMANUEL CLEAVER to create a 
Cerebral Palsy Research Program within the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) to support research on the diagnosis, 
treatment, mitigation, health care costs, and 
societal costs of cerebral palsy. It also directs 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to up-
date and publish their Strategic Plan on Cere-
bral Palsy. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in this ef-
fort to support more research on cerebral 
palsy—a disability that affects approximately 1 
million people in the United States, has few 
reliable treatments, and no cure.

Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise

to the Contra Costa community and congratu-
late her on her retirement. 
Eva Garcia was born in Argentina and immi-
grated to the United States in 1971. Through

gration Program, which is now SparkPoint 
Contra Costa. In 2000, Eva advanced to the 
top leadership position at SparkPoint’s Career 
Center thanks to her hard work and dedica-
tion. 
In this role, Eva has assisted so many in the 
area with job training and mentoring. Eva has 
also been appointed to the Bay Point Munic-
ipal Advisory, serving on the advisory board to 
Supervisor Federal Glover, and is a member 
of the Mt. Diablo Unified School District Bay 
Point Ad/Hoc Committee, Vice President of 
the Bay Point Historical Society, and Secretary 
of the Bay Point Association. Eva’s leadership 
is commendable and Contra Costa has bene-
fited greatly thanks to her work. 
In her personal life, Eva is a mother to her 
twin children and has been a proud resident of 
Bay Point for the past 30 years. Her love for 
her family and her community is clear to all 
who know her. 
We thank Eva for her 24 years of service 
and for her passion for Bay Point and its resi-
dents. Please join me in honoring Eva and 
congratulating her on her retirement.

TRIBUTE TO BISHOP FREDERICK 
C. JAMES 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a dear friend, legendary 
faith leader, consummate community activist 
and astute political observer. 
Bishop Frederick C. James, a stalwart of the 
African Methodist Episcopal Church (AMEC) 
and civil rights activities, will celebrate his 
100th birthday on April 7, 2022. He was born 
in Prosperity, South Carolina, to Rosa Lee 
Gray and Edward James in 1922. His father, 
a mechanic with a 7th grade education, died 
when he was just 10 years old, and his moth-
er, instilled in him the desire to see the good 
in everyone. 
Bishop James graduated from Drayton 
Street High School in Newberry, South Caro-
lina. He earned a bachelor’s degree in history 
and English from Allen University in Columbia, 
South Carolina in 1943 and answered a call to 
the ministry at an early age. In 1947 he grad-
uated from the Howard University School of 
Divinity in Washington, D.C. and furthered his 
studies at Dickerson Theological Seminary in 
Columbia and Union Theological Seminary in 
New York, New York. 
Bishop James began his ministerial career 
as pastor of Friendship AME Church in 1945 
and Bishop Memorial AME Church in 1946, 
both in Columbia, and added Wayman AME 
Church in Winnsboro South Carolina to his 
charge in 1947. In 1949, James became Dean 
of Dickerson Theological Seminary and pastor 
of Chappelle Memorial AME Church in Colum-
bia in 1950. 
In 1953, Bishop James moved to my home-
town of Sumter, South Carolina, to become 
pastor of Mt. Pisgah AME Church, which is 
when I came to know him. He was very active 
in the activities that led to Briggs v. Elliott the 
initial federal court case that resulted in the 
1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme 
Court decision. I was serving as President of 
the NAACP Youth Council at the time, and we 
went on to have a lifelong friendship and close 
bond. 
In 1960, James was elected director of so-
cial action for the AME Church, and became 
close with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His ca-
reer was dedicated to faith and social activ-
ism, and he rose to great heights in both are-
nas. 
Beloved among those in the AME move-
ment, he was elected the 93rd Bishop of the 
AME Church in 1972. He served the 18th and 
15th Episcopal Districts from 1972 to 1976, 
the 12th from 1976 to 1984, the 7th from 1984 
to 1992, and the 2nd from 1993 to 1996. 
Among his many accomplishments, Bishop 
James led AME-sponsored colleges Shorter 
College, in Little Rock, Arkansas to full ac-
creditation in 1981 and Allen University to full 
accreditation in 1992. He also served as Ecu-
menical Bishop and Chaplaincy Endorsement 
Officer of the AME Church in 1992. In 1996, 
Bishop James retired from leadership in the 
AME Church. 
Bishop James’ interest in civic engagement 
began while he was very young. He joined the 
NAACP as a teenager and actively became in-
volved in voter registration efforts. He was 
very active in the student movement while on 
the campus of Allen University. 
While living in Sumter, he helped organize 
and chair the Sumter Citizens Committee. He 
also served as president of the Effective Sum-
ter Movement, These groups organized dem-
onstrations, raised bail to get protestors out of 
jail, and met with local white organizations and 
government officials in the effort to change 
hearts and minds. 
In addition to his civil rights activism, Bishop 
James served as chair of Allen University’s 
Board of Trustees and of the Howard Junior 
High School Center in Prosperity, South Caro-
lina. He was also a board member of the Co-
lumbia Housing Authority. In 1994, Bishop 
James was selected by his good friend, Presi-
dent Bill Clinton, to serve as a member of the 
delegation to attend the inauguration of South 
African President Nelson Mandela.

Bishop James is a former member of the 
White House Advisory Board on Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities and of the 
U.S. State Department’s Advisory Board on 
Religious Freedom and served as National 
Vice President of the Interfaith Alliance. 
Bishop James is a life member of the NAACP 
and Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and is a 33rd 
degree Mason. He was also the first African 
American to serve on the board of directors at 
the National Bank of South Carolina and as a 
member of the Greater Sumter Chamber of 
Commerce. 
Among his many honors, Bishop James 
holds an honorary doctorate of humanities 
from Monrovia College in Liberia. He received 
South Carolina’s highest honor, the Order of 
the Palmetto, in 2003. In 2020, Bishop James 
received the Leon A. Love Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award from the South Carolina African 
American Heritage Foundation and ‘‘Columbia 
SC 63: Our Story Matters.’’ He has been in-

December 30, 1944, and the couple enjoyed 
76 years of marriage before she passed away 
on January 25, 2021. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the centen-
nial anniversary of Bishop Fred James’ birth. 
He was a mentor to me and so many others 
as he preached the gospel and the need for 
equality and justice for all. This important mile-
stone, is a good time to let Bishop James 
know that we all feel blessed by his efforts to 
fulfill the charge of Micah to, ‘‘act justly, love 
mercy, and walk humbly.’’

HONORING L.A. BLACK BUSINESS 
ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN OF THE 
BOARD EARL ‘‘SKIP’’ COOPER II 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
acknowledge the legacy of Earl ‘‘Skip’’ Cooper 
II as he retires from the Black Business Asso-
ciation of Los Angeles. 
For the last 50 years, Skip Cooper has 
fought tirelessly to break down barriers and 
uplift not only African American businesses, 
but all minority businesses. He has developed 
programs to assure that businesspeople, art-
ists, and entrepreneurs had access to the fi-
nancing, contracting, mentoring, and support 
that it takes to succeed, and he has served as 
an advisor to both the Latin and Asian busi-
ness associations in Los Angeles prior to their 
formation. As a result, he has played a pivotal 
role in the success of countless businesses 
across the Los Angeles region. 
Young Skip had a newspaper delivery route 
by age I0, and he never forgot the power of 
relationships and mentoring. Skip would go on 
to serve as a medic in the Vietnam War, and 
he returned home from service to study at 
Oakland’s Merritt College, where he became 
one of the first in the country to earn an AA 
degree in African American Studies. He would 
later earn bachelor’s and MBA degrees as 
well. 
Early in his career, Skip interned at a Los 
Angeles area minority business resource cen-
ter where he saw the need to promote and 
support minority-owned businesses. At the 
end of Skip’s internship, he joined the staff of 
what became the Los Angeles Economic De-
velopment Corp. where, as program manager, 
Skip oversaw a state initiative that helped mi-
nority owned businesses secure purchasing 
contracts with public and private sector organi-
zations. That led him to join the BBA where, 
in 1976, he embarked on its first trade mission 
to Washington, D.C. 
Over decades of advocacy, Skip has had a 
significant role in the passage and implemen-
tation of legislation and regulations at the fed-
eral, state and local levels. He worked closely 
with legislators, especially the late California 
Asm. Gwen Moore and the late U.S. Rep. 
Parren Mitchell, to pass laws to address the 
historic disadvantage of minority businesses 
that had been shut out of public and private 
programs and funding opportunities. 
The BBA will continue its annual salutes to 
Black history, Black women and Black music, 
its twice-annual veterans’ procurement con-
ference, and its e-commerce venture: a Black 
business shopping guide, all of which will fur-
ther Skip’s legacy, and his lifelong commit-
ment to economic empowerment for people of 
color.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF GRADY 
WIGGINTON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and accom-
plishments of Grady Wigginton, as he passed 
away on February 12, 2013. 
Mr. Wigginton was born just west of 
Guntown, 
MS 
on 
June 
30, 
1937. 
Mr. 
Wigginton was proud to grow up in rural Mis-
sissippi where he was able to learn about the 
nature and creatures of God’s creation. After 
graduating from High school Mr. Wigginton de-
cided to join the USMC. In his time serving the 
country he achieved the great accomplishment 
of being promoted to the rank of Sergeant (E– 
4) in just twenty-two months. He believed in 
God first, Country second, and family third. 
We thank him for his commitment to service. 
After Mr. Wigginton’s service to his country 
he worked for CPI. At CPI he went on to be-
come both a district and regional manager. He 
enjoyed hiring and working with new employ-
ees as he saw it was his responsibility to moti-
vate them to do their jobs to the best of their 
ability. Due to his commitment to a hard-work-
ing staff both his district and regional teams 
won multiple awards for sales and profit. 
Mr. Wigginton will be greatly missed, and 
we thank him for his service to his country and 
community.

HONORING 
CRAIG 
MCLEAN 
ON 
FORTY YEARS OF SERVICE WITH 
THE 
NATIONAL 
OCEANIC 
AND 
ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION 
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend Assistant Administrator 
Craig McLean on his retirement after forty 
years of distinguished service in the National 
Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 
Administration 
(NOAA). This son of New Jersey grew up on 
the Passaic River and turned a childhood pas-
sion for ocean diving and exploration into a 
forty-year career that started as a commis-
sioned NOAA Corps deck officer charting the 
ocean floor and culminated as a preeminent 
champion of NOAA’s mission to understand 
and predict changes in climate, weather, 
ocean, and coasts. 
Craig started working on diving boats as a 
teenager. As a college student at Rutgers Uni-
versity, where he earned his B.A. in Zoology 
in 1979, he investigated barges dumping toxic 
sludge into waterways. While serving as a 
NOAA Corps officer and, later as a senior ex-
ecutive of NOAA, Craig was instrumental to 
founding NOAA’s Ocean Exploration and Re-
search Program and its mapping of U.S. 
waters to advance oceanographic scientific 
knowledge and discover deep ocean secrets 
including new species, historical shipwrecks, 
and undersea mountains. With Craig’s leader-
ship, NOAA mapped two million square kilo-
meters of the ocean floor, collected ocean 
data in the waters of sixteen countries and the 
high seas, and contributed to key conservation 
decisions for vital marine habitats such as es-
tablishment of new marine national monu-
ments and deep sea protection areas. 
Craig served as Assistant Administrator for 
NOAA Oceanic and Atmospheric Research for 
over six years. He expertly led an enterprise 
of ten federal laboratories across the country 
and six major programs. Under his tenure, 
NOAA Research achieved vital advancements 
for the benefit of the Nation, including im-
proved forecasting of weather extremes such 
as hurricanes, winter storms, and excesses 
and deficits of precipitation, enabling society to 
be better prepared to reduce the severe im-
pacts of these events on life and destruction

of property. These advancements greatly in-
creased our understanding of the earth’s cli-
mate system, improved modeling of the 
weather 
and 
climate 
seamlessly 
across 
timescales, and strengthened the scientific 
basis for investigating climate change. 
On the international stage, Craig helped 
broker a consensus on the Intergovernmental 
Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO for 
global biogeochemical Argo sensors that en-
abled a $53 million commitment to expand de-
ployments to improve ocean health and cli-
mate forecasting. He championed a global 
framework under the U.N. Decade of Ocean 
Science for Sustainable Development initiative 
to ensure ocean science can support countries 
and achieve the United Nations’ 2030 Sustain-
able Development Goals. 
Craig boldly stepped forward as a complain-
ant when NOAA experienced high-level, public 
political interference, putting himself at risk to 
uphold NOAA’s scientific integrity and reputa-
tion. Afterward, he worked with other federal 
agencies on the National Science and Tech-
nology Council’s effort to restore public trust in 
government through scientific integrity in pol-
icymaking. 
On behalf of the Committee on Science, 
Space and Technology, I thank Craig for his 
forty years of service. His leadership and per-
sonal commitment to scientific integrity and 
the public good exemplify the highest ideals of 
public service. I wish Craig a long and joyful 
retirement.

RECOGNIZING BOB WILLIAMS 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, my heart is heavy as I rise today 
with Rep. GARY PALMER to honor the life of my 
dear friend, Bob Williams, who passed away 
on March 15, 2022. My prayers are with Bob’s 
wife Jane, his family, and all who loved him as 
we mourn his passing. 
Bob was a humble public servant who loved 
Washington with all his heart. He dedicated a 
decade of his life to serving the people of 
Washington in the State House of Representa-
tives and even made a run for governor in 
1988. 
Shortly after, I met Bob for the first time in 
Olympia. I had just been elected to the State 
House, and I remember being struck by his 
big smile and even bigger heart. We became 
fast friends, bonding over our common pursuit 
of a more perfect Union. I was inspired by 
Bob’s commitment to individual liberty, free 
enterprise, and a limited accountable govern-
ment. 
In 1991, he founded the Freedom Founda-
tion to advance those very ideals we both held 
dear. Since its founding, the Freedom Founda-
tion has been a beacon of Bob’s vision for 
America, and his legacy will live on in their 
work for years to come. 
Bob was one of the brightest minds I’ve 
ever known, and I will always miss him stop-
ping by the office with a new idea or a word 
of encouragement. His commitment to fighting 
for freedom and opportunity for all was unwav-
ering, and it inspires me to this day. He be-
lieved in the importance and value of covering 
every day in prayer and impressed upon me 
how time on the plane was prime time to read 
my Bible and pray. Each and every one of us 
who had the privilege of knowing Bob in this 
life are better because of it, and I thank God 
for giving me the blessing of calling him my 
friend. 
Madam Speaker, Bob Williams lived an 
amazing life that deserves to be celebrated. In 
honor of his legacy, passion, and contributions 
that inspired so many, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing Bob Williams. May God 
grant him eternal peace in His kingdom.

RECOGNIZING THE ANNUAL MAY 
FAIRE 
EVENT 
OF 
MATHEWS 
COUNTY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Mathews County’s an-
nual May Faire event on Saturday, May 7, 
2022. In the event is a joyous celebration that 
brings the entire community together to cele-
brate its rich history. May Day Festivities were 
commonplace in Mathews from the early 1900 
to the 1980s. 
The Mathews Historical Museum reintro-
duced the festival concept in 2016 renaming it 
‘May Faire’. May Faire honors the heritage of 
Mathews County each year exploring different 
themes from the county’s past. The last and 
past event in 2019, celebrated Mathews’ vet-
erans on its ‘‘Wall of Remembrance’’ posting 
over 800 photographs of their sons and 
daughters dating back to the War of 1812 and 
to the war in Afghanistan. 
This year’s theme, ‘‘Celebrating Mathews 
Watermen’’ will be a tribute to the residents 
who work or have worked on the water. Some 
of the local watermen have made their living 
on the water for over 50 years, including sev-
eral working as successful menhaden cap-
tains. There will be a photo display, much like 
the veterans ‘‘Wall of Remembrance’’, that will 
display those local watermen and a permanent 
part of the museum. 
The Mathews May Faire event will be held 
on the Historic Court Green, at the Historic 
Court House as well as in the Mathews His-
toric Museum, Saturday, May 7, 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m. The opening ceremony will include thank-
ing the Coast Guard for remaining in Mat-
hews. The day will proceed with hosting con-
versations with watermen, exhibits on crab pot 
making, net mending and a traditional ‘May-
pole’ dance by local school children. 
The Museum will host for its first traveling 
exhibit, ‘‘Bay to Belly’’ on loan from the York-
town Watermen’s Museum from April 1–May 
30. During that time Mathews school children 
will be able to tour the museum to learn about 
the Chesapeake Bay and its incredible re-
sources. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
recognizing the celebration of Mathews Coun-
ty’s May Faire 2022 and their rich history it 
symbolizes.

HON. JACKIE SPEIER

Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I strongly 
support passage of S. 3294, legislation to ob-
tain and place statues in the Capitol or Capitol 
grounds of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the first two 
women to serve as associate justices of the 
Supreme Court of the United States. I would 
have voted in favor of this legislation; how-
ever, I was regretfully unable to be present on 
the floor because I was attending and asking 
questions at a hearing of the House Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence. I offer 
my congratulations to the family and friends of

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
POLICE CHIEF MITCH NABORS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the service of Fulton 
Police Chief Mitch Nabors. Chief Nabors has 
been serving the great state of Mississippi for 
the last 30 years. He has served the force 
since shortly after his 22nd birthday, and an-
nounced his retirement this year. 
Chief Nabors is a well renowned leader 
within the department. His colleagues speak to 
his loyalty and commitment to those with 
which he served. The city of Fulton is a better 
and safer place because of him. 
I congratulate Chief Nabors on a successful 
career in public service, and thank him for his 
lifetime commitment to the community.

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
CUM-
BERLAND 
COUNTY 
SHERIFF 
EARL BUTLER 
HON. DAVID ROUZER 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Cumberland 
County’s longtime former Sheriff, Earl Butler. 
Following a battle with leukemia, Sheriff Butler 
passed away while surrounded by his family at 
the age of 84 years old. 
Butler served as sheriff of Cumberland 
County for 22 years before retiring in 2016. He 
was beloved by his community, his family and 
friends, and his law enforcement colleagues. 
He believed in his work, and he was pas-
sionate about giving back to his community 
and keeping its citizens safe. 
He helped make the Sheriff’s office a fully 
accredited law enforcement agency, increas-
ing their ability to fight crime and protect the 
community. He also led the building and de-
velopment of a new detention center, and he 
was the founder of the Shop with A Sheriff 
Program which helps provide a memorable 
Christmas to less fortunate children within 
Cumberland County. Sheriff Butler and his 
wife, Julia, were dedicated members of 
Massey Hill Baptist Church where they at-
tended every Sunday and he taught Sunday 
school. 
The contributions Sheriff Butler made to 
Cumberland County were numerous. He made 
Cumberland County a better place to live leav-
ing behind a great legacy that will be felt for 
years to come. 
Sheriff Butler’s was a life very well-lived, 
and I extend my deepest condolences to his 
family and friends. He will be long remem-
bered and cherished in the hearts of all who 
knew him and those for whom his influence 
touched.

LAILANI AGUIRRE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Lailani Aguirre 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Lailani Aguirre is a student at Drake Middle 
School and received this award because her 
determination and hard work have allowed her 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Lailani 
Aguirre is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Lailani Aguirre for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments. 
HONORING WES WAGESTER FOR 
HIS SERVICE TO THE ALMONT 
TOWNSHIP COMMUNITY 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize a distinguished public servant of the 
Almont Township community, Wes Wagester. 
For over 30 years, Wes has served his 
community with honor and selflessness. He 
has served as a member of the Almont Town-
ship Parks and Recreation board, and since 
October 1991, has been a dedicated member 
of the Almont Michigan Lions Club. Recently 
he assisted in the installation of new play-
ground equipment at Almont Community Park, 
which will be enjoyed by families of the com-
munity for years to come. 
It is really no surprise that Wes dedicated 
decades of his life to his community. In the 
first part of his life, he served his country as 
a member of the United States Navy. 
Our country and state have been honored to 
have him as our own. I applaud Wes for the 
service he has given to his beloved commu-
nity. He has been a pillar, and the example he 
set will be hard to follow. I know Wes will con-
tinue to give his time to Almont whenever he 
can, and I wish him the best in whatever en-
deavors he next takes.

MARCH CONSTITUENT OF THE 
MONTH KAILLIE HUMPHRIES 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Carlsbad resident 
and Olympic athlete Kaillie Humphries as my 
Constituent of the Month for March. Kaillie has 
had a long and extraordinarily successful ca-
reer as a bobsled athlete, including four Olym-
pic medals and five championships in the 
International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federa-
tion (IBSF) World Championships, making her 
the most decorated woman in bobsled history. 
She had won two gold and one bronze medal 
for Team Canada in previous Olympic com-
petitions, and this year, she won gold in the 
monobob event for Team USA. She is the 
only female athlete in Olympic history to have 
earned Olympic gold medals for two nations. 
Kaillie had to overcome significant adversity 
during her journey to the 2022 Winter Olym-
pics. After leaving the Canadian team due to 
abuse and harassment she endured, Kaillie 
began the arduous process of becoming a 
United States citizen with little time to spare 
before the games, all while continuing to train 
vigorously for the competition. As a Carlsbad 
resident and constituent of mine, Kaillie 
reached out to my office for help. With assist-
ance from my staff, Kaillie became a United 
States citizen just two months before the 
Olympics began, allowing her to compete for 
Team USA. It is hard to overstate the stress 
and pressure Kaillie experienced, but she per-
severed and ultimately made our CA–49 com-
munity and our entire country very proud. 
Kaillie is not only an extraordinary athlete, 
she is a person of integrity and upstanding 
character who is an excellent role model for all 
of us. It is my honor to recognize her as our 
Constituent of the Month, particularly during 
Women’s History Month.

HONORING INMAN AND NELLIE 
MOORE 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the lives of Reverend Inman Moore, 
who passed away on January 26, 2022, at the 
age of 96, and his wife, Nellie Moore, who 
passed away on February 6, 2021, at the age 
of 95. Inman and Nellie were stalwarts in the 
San Gabriel Valley, dedicated to leaving their 
community better than they found it. And they 
did just that. 
Nellie Moore was born in rural Southern 
Mississippi in 1926 as an only child to a single 
mother after her father died of pneumonia 
right before her birth. Nellie married Inman 
Moore in 1947, and she dedicated herself to 
being a minister’s wife, becoming an active 
member of the church communities that she 
and her husband joined. After settling in Pasa-
dena in 1970 with her husband and children, 
Nellie served as an administrative assistant at 
the famous Jet Propulsion Laboratory and 
later started and ran two successful busi-
nesses in Pasadena alongside her husband. 
Inman Moore was born on September 8, 
1925, in southern Mississippi. While he in-
tended on attending medical school, Inman’s 
plan changed following his service in the Navy 
during World War II. Upon returning home, he 
enrolled in Millsaps College in Jackson, Mis-
sissippi and decided to follow in the footsteps 
of his father, a Methodist minister, by receiving 
a graduate degree in theology from the Can-
dler School of Theology at Emory University in 
Atlanta, Georgia. 
Inman went on to serve in various churches 
in Mississippi, a segregated state, during the 
rising civil rights movement of the 1960s. He 
was a founding member of the Mississippi 
Human Relations Council, an interracial orga-
nization dedicated to improving race relations 
through educational programs. Additionally, 
while serving as pastor at the renowned 
Leggett Memorial United Methodist Church in 
Biloxi, Mississippi in 1963, Inman was one of 
28 Mississippi Methodist ministers who signed 
a ‘‘Born of Conviction’’ statement opposing the 
perpetuation of a segregated society. 
Inman, Nellie and their children then relo-
cated to California in 1963 where Inman be-
came a pastor at the Palmdale United Meth-
odist Church and later became a minister at 
the Crescenta Valley United Methodist in La 
Crescenta. In 1970, Inman retired from the 
ministry and started two successful Pasadena 
companies with Nellie: Moore Vending and 
Tournament Souvenirs. After nearly 30 years 
in business, Inman and Nellie sold their com-
panies and retired in 1997. 
Years later, when Grace United Methodist— 
a predominantly Black congregation in Alta-
dena, CA—lacked the funding to afford a full- 
time minister, Inman came out of retirement 
without hesitation to serve as their part-time 
minister for four years. Inman even came out 
of retirement a second time to serve as asso-
ciate pastor at the First United Methodist in

Burbank, California for five years, and served 
as a guest pastor for several other churches 
throughout the Southern California region. At 
the age of 90, Inman penned his own auto-
biography, ‘‘On the Road to Civil Rights,’’ 
sharing his incredible journey of activism and 
faith. When a need presented itself in the 
community, Inman was there. 
Inman and Nellie were happily married for 
73 years, and are survived by their children, 
Linda, Robert, and David Leon Moore, their 
grandchildren Saul, Marisa, Nate, Sarah, 
Anna, and Nellie, and four great-grand-
children. Inman was known as a force of na-
ture for his powerful preaching abilities, his 
unyielding moral code and his commitment to 
racial justice and civil rights. Nellie will be re-
membered by kindness and humor, and her 
dedication to her community. Inman and Nellie 
Moore embody what it means to put the needs 
of others, whether that be family, parishioners, 
or community members, above their own. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in commemo-
rating the lives of these two extraordinary 
individuals.

Blake Albertson is an 8th grader at Bennett

cause their determination and hard work have

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MIKE 
HAINSEY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Mike Hainsey on 
his retirement from the Golden Triangle Re-
gional Airport. He has greatly served as the 
executive director for the last 19 years. Under 
his command, many great projects took place 
to help better the airport operations. 
I have witnessed personally the great ex-
pansions he has made in growing this busi-
ness. In his time, he oversaw 30 million dol-
lars’ worth of total expansion. In the 30 million 
worth of expansion projects the highlights 
were runway expansion to help Air Force, 
growth of two terminals, and an increase in 
passenger traffic which led to adding more 
parking. These are all viewed as important 
projects to help better the overall functionality 
of the airport. 
Lastly, I want to thank Mr. Hainsey again for 
his hard work for the first district of Mis-
sissippi. The community and I are very grate-
ful for what he has done. We are excited to 
welcome Matt Dowell as the new executive di-
rector, and we know he had a great teacher 
to learn from in Mr. Hainsey.

RECOGNIZING JOSEPH MOSSA 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Mr. Joseph Mossa. Mr. 
Mossa will be honored by the Amerigo Ves-
pucci Society of Long Branch, New Jersey as 
the 2022 Man of the Year, and I would like to 
join with its members in congratulating Mr. 
Mossa. 
Joseph Mossa takes great pride in his fam-
ily and heritage. The son of Carmine Anthony 
and Maryann (Cuccinello) Mossa, he was 
named after his maternal grandfather Joseph 
Cuccinello and can trace his lineage to various 
parts of Italy. He maintains his Italian heritage 
through his involvement with the Amerigo Ves-
pucci Society and by sharing his travel experi-
ences to Italy with others. 
A member of the Amerigo Vespucci Society 
for more than a decade, Mr. Mossa has be-
come an active and integral member. Cur-
rently serving as Vice President, Mr. Mossa 
has held several, executive positions on the 
board and has undertaken various projects 
and events, including the Saint Joseph’s Din-
ner. Near and dear to his heart, Mr. Mossa 
brought back the annual dinner in honor of his 
late father, which he continues to chair today. 
Mr. Mossa received his bachelor’s degree in 
Marketing from King’s College in Pennsylvania 
and has led a successful career in sales, re-
ceiving accolades for his performance. In addi-
tion to his work with the Amerigo Vespucci So-
ciety, Mr. Mossa is a member of the Business 
Advisory Council at King’s College—McGowan 
School of Business and an usher at Saint 
Veronica’s Parish, among other previous com-
munity service roles. Despite his active leader-
ship in the community, Mr. Mossa devotes his 
life to his family. Together with his wife, Lind-
say, he has three daughters and a son-in-law. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope that my 
colleagues will join me in congratulating Mr. 
Joseph Mossa as he is honored by the 
Amerigo Vespucci Society and thanking him 
for his service to the community.

IN MEMORY OF JOAN BUSER 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Mrs. Joan Buser, a very 
special person to me and all of Oakland Coun-
ty. She was an incredible community leader, 
beloved wife, mother, and friend to many. I 
was fortunate enough to also call her my aunt 
and mentor. Joan passed away surrounded by 
her family on October 4, 2021 and is genu-
inely missed by the many who loved her. 
Mrs. Buser was a dedicated public servant 
and trusted community leader in Oakland 
County, Michigan, and residents are better off 
because of her efforts. In 1988, Joan became 
Supervisor of Oakland Township, Michigan, 
being reelected multiple times and serving 
until 1999. She was beloved by the staff and 
community alike in this role, earning her many 
friends and confidantes. Upon her retirement 
in 1999, her staff presented her a sword to 
mimic that of Joan of Arc, on which was in-
scribed ‘‘Joan of Oakland.’’ This unique and 
thoughtful gift served as a testament to the 
tireless work Joan did to bring the community 
together and lead by example. 
Joan is also dearly missed by her beloved 
husband of 61 years, Donald Buser, and her 
sons Greg (Angie) and Steven (Megan). She 
was also a wonderful grandmother to her four 
grandchildren, Nicholas, Alexander, Brian, and 
Saila. She is also survived by her loving and 
adoring brother, James R. Stevens, who at-
tests to the profound impact she made on his 
life as his older sister and protector. 
Her legacy continues through the values 
she instilled in her community, including serv-
ice to others, kindness, and hard work. The 
Oakland County community is stronger as a 
result of her efforts, and I am proud to channel 
the lessons learned from Joan of Oakland 
when representing Oakland County in Con-
gress. 
Madam Speaker, Mrs. Joan Buser was a 
champion for Oakland County, a faithful serv-
ant, and loving friend and family member. All 
of us are better off because of Joan’s many 
years of leadership and mentorship that make 
our community stronger. Her legacy continues 
through the many people who pay her acts of 
kindness forward, and we all owe Joan our 
gratitude for the positive imprint she left on the 
world. Please join me in remembering the life 
of Mrs. Joan Buser and her legacy that sur-
vives.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
NATIONAL 
AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CEN-
TER (AHEC) WEEK 2022 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to acknowledge the contributions of 
the nation’s Area Health Education Centers 
(AHECs) and applaud the vitally important 
health care workforce programs they conduct 
to improve access to care for medically under-
served individuals, particularly in the Tampa 
Bay area. 
AHECs, established by Congress in 1971 as 
one of the Title VII Health Professions Train-
ing programs, are the workforce development, 
training and education machine for the na-
tion’s health care safety net programs. Over 
the past 5 years, the AHEC program has 
trained 2 million health care professionals who 
are prepared to deliver culturally appropriate, 
high-quality, team-based care, with an empha-
sis on primary care for rural and underserved 
populations. 
The nation’s 300 AHECs are in nearly every 
state and in multiple U.S. territories, offering 
hands-on and innovative health career curricu-
lums for pre-college level students. They are 
committed to continuing education, clinical 
training of health professionals, and respond-
ing to community health needs. This is accom-
plished by forming academic and community 
partnerships that link the resources of aca-
demic health centers with the needs of the 
communities. 
AHEC clinical training placements put health 
professions students in a variety of real-world 
settings, such as migrant, urban, and rural 
community health clinics and health depart-
ments that provide care to rural and under-
served communities. Connecting students to 
their communities helps facilitate future en-
gagement, encouraging health career students 
to remain in their clinical practice regions fol-
lowing their training. As the nation’s population 
becomes more diverse, it is important that the 
health care workforce follows suit. 
I have long supported the work of AHECs 
and particularly that of the University of South 
Florida AHEC program. Established in 1993, 
USF AHEC and its centers provide youth from 
diverse backgrounds with programs to inspire 
and support their interest in health careers 
through programs such as the Brain Expan-
sion Scholastic Training (BEST), Recruitment 
and Education Assistance for Careers in 
Health (REACH), and AHEC Scholars. Stu-
dents interested in medicine, nursing, den-
tistry, public health, pharmacy, and other dis-
ciplines are exposed to local free clinics in the 
Tampa Bay area—clinical training opportuni-
ties that illustrate the real-world impacts that 
poverty, racism, and inadequate access to 
health care have on the lives of their patients 
and families. 
As part of a statewide system of 15 feder-
ally and state supported AHEC program of-
fices and centers serving all of Florida’s 67 
counties, USF AHEC and its partners across 
the state have leveraged their statewide infra-
structure to create numerous programs to ben-
efit the residents of Florida. Since 2008, Flor-
ida’s AHEC network has conducted a $10 mil-
lion annual comprehensive tobacco education 
program and group cessation counseling initia-
tive; worked with the state’s Opioid Response 
Program to provide over $1 million in edu-
cation and training on opioids for health care 
providers, students, and community health 
workers; and partnered with the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention to deliver 
HPV vaccine education and training programs. 
Congress has tasked AHECs with an ex-
traordinarily important mission, and the need 
to strengthen the health care workforce in our 
country continues to grow. According to a new 
report by the Association of American Medical 
Colleges, the U.S. could see a shortage of up 
to 124,000 physicians by 2034, and the Amer-
ican Hospital Association says more than 
200,000 new registered nurses are needed 
each year to meet increasing health care 
needs and to replace nurses entering retire-
ment. AHECs continue to be committed to ad-
dressing shortage areas and expanding the 
health care workforce, while maximizing diver-
sity and facilitating distribution, especially in 
rural and underserved communities. 
On behalf of my constituents at the USF 
Area Health Education Center and the AHEC 
program more broadly, I call on my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing March 28th to April 
1st, 2022 as National AHEC (Area Health 
Education Centers) Week.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MAJOR 
GENERAL GARY WAYNE JOHN-
STON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
l rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Major General Gary Wayne Johnston who 
passed away on January 20, 2022. My deep-
est condolences are with his family, friends, 
and loved ones during this time of mourning. 
Gary Johnston was born on October 21, 
1964 in Russellville, Arkansas. He served in 
the U.S. Army for over 34 years. He served 
overseas in Germany, the first Gulf War and 
Afghanistan and commanded the U.S. Army 
Intelligence and Security Command at Fort 
Belvoir, Virginia. Additionally, he was a direc-
tor of intelligence of the United States Special 
Operations Command and the deputy chief of 
staff for intelligence for Resolute Support Mis-
sion. After retiring from the Army in 2021, 
Gory joined Touchstone Futures as the execu-
tive Vice President for Intelligence, Security, 
and Risk. He served on the advisory board for 
Leyden Solutions. 
Left to cherish his memory are his beloved 
wife, Brigadier General Amy Johnston; his 
mother, Bonnie; children, Lauren, Blake, and 
Parker. 
The Johnston family and all those who had 
the opportunity to know and serve with him 
are in my thoughts and prayers. 
BARNEGAT, NEW JERSEY 
VIETNAM WAR VETERANS DAY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to express my gratitude for the 
service of our Vietnam veterans and the patri-
otism shown by the community of Barnegat, 
New Jersey as they honor Vietnam War Vet-
erans Day. Today families gather to com-
memorate the 49th anniversary of final U.S. 
combat troops departing South Vietnam. 
I had the opportunity to attend the second 
annual event in 2019 and have seen firsthand 
how much this day means not only to the vet-
erans and their families, but to the visitors who 
travel from all over New Jersey to attend. Bar-
negat is the only town in the entire country to 
have a Vietnam veterans’ monument fully 
funded by an individual Vietnamese refugee. 
Barnegat is setting an example on how we 
can honor the sacrifices Vietnam veterans 
made for our country and I sincerely hope this 
inspires others to reimagine how we remem-
ber our Vietnam veterans and all of our vet-
erans. 
New Jersey’s 3rd Congressional District is 
home to one of the largest concentrations of 
veterans in the country, a place where more 
than sixty thousand veterans call Burlington 
and Ocean Counties home. With such a large 
population, we see brave servicemembers 
who have kept us safe every single day. To 
honor such a sacrifice, I know putting together 
a meaningful ceremony dedicated to the hun-
dreds of Vietnam veterans here today is no 
small feat. Truly, it is people’s passion and or-
ganizing that provides hope that military serv-
ice will never be forgotten. Thy Cavagnaro 
and her team have done an exceptional job 
putting this together. 
Our appreciation for our veterans should not 
solely be in ceremonies alone. The simple 
promise we make is that if someone steps up 
to protect us, our families, and our nation’s se-
curity, we will have their backs for the rest of 
their lives. This promise is one that we as a 
nation have not always kept, and I am trying 
to fix that so our veterans and their families 
receive the benefits they have earned. Wheth-
er it is passing the Honoring our PACT Act to 
ensure all veterans exposed to toxic chemicals 
during their service have access to the care 
and benefits they deserve, or making every-
day connections directly with veterans in the 
community, it is on all of us to recognize and 
celebrate our veterans every day. 
For the thousands of Vietnam War veterans 
and the hundreds being recognized today at 
this ceremony, know we are eternally grateful 
and free thanks to their service.

March 29, 2022 
At age 10, Barbara recorded her first radio 
performance, and moved to Los Angeles in 
the early 1970s at the age of 21. During her 
historic career she released numerous albums 
and performed alongside legendary musicians 
like Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Charles, Etta James, 
Tony Bennett, Nancy Wilson, and Dr. John. A 
three-time GRAMMY nominee, Barbara’s wide 
vocal range and her soulful interpretations of 
jazz and blues classics resonated deeply with 
audiences across the globe. 
Over her six-decade career, Barbara dedi-
cated her life to her music and her community. 
In 2009, she founded the Barbara Morrison 
Performing Arts Center in Leimert Park, a hub 
of African American arts and culture in my dis-
trict. There she provided music lovers with the 
opportunity to hear live jazz, blues, and soul 
music from musicians around the world. Two 
years later, she created the California Jazz & 
Blues Museum in the same location. 
Barbara also nurtured new talent and fos-
tered a love of music in young people, includ-
ing with nocost music and voice lessons for 
children. The Center and the Museum offer 
gathering places where lovers can come to-
gether, collaborate and learn. 
Committed to teaching, Barbara’s work ex-
tended to academia. She served as an adjunct 
associate professor of global jazz studies at 
the Herb Alpert School of Music at the Univer-
sity of California, Los Angeles. As a UCLA 
professor and as a music teacher in Leimert 
Park, Barbara’s joy for music brought genera-
tions together. Barbara led with compassion 
and grace, and used music to heal and uplift 
her community. In celebration of April as Inter-
national Jazz Month, the Center plans to 
honor Barbara Morrison’s music, spirit, and 
significant contributions to the City’s artistic 
history and its future. I’m proud to know that 
her legacy will live on.

AUDYANNA VIALPANDO 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Audyanna 
Vialpando for receiving the Adams County 
Mayors and Commissioners Youth Award. 
Audyanna Vialpando is a student in Adams 
County and received this award because their 
determination and hard work have allowed 
them to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Audyanna 
Vialpando is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Audyanna Vialpando for winning the Adams 
County Mayors and Commissioners Youth 
Award. I have no doubt they will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of their 
future accomplishments. 
HONORING THE DISTINGUISHED 
SERVICE OF BERNIE BLUESTEIN 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I wish to honor the distinguished service 
of Bernie Bluestein, a resident of Schaumburg, 
Illinois and of my district who is one of nine 
veterans of the ‘‘Ghost Army,’’ an elite U.S. 
military unit during World War Two, still alive 
today. 
During the war, the Ghost Army operated 
covertly, deploying tactics such as inflatable 
tanks, the use of sound effects, radio decep-
tion, and impersonation to gain an upper hand 
on the enemy by concealing the strength and 
location of American troops. In June 1945, the 
unit returned home after having served with 
four U.S. armies throughout England, France, 
Luxembourg, Belgium, Holland, and Germany, 
There is no doubt that the Ghost Army’s ef-
forts, while not officially declassified until 1996, 
were critical to our military’s success in turning 
the tide of the war in Europe. It is estimated 
that the brave missions undertaken by the 
Ghost Army saved around 30,000 American 
lives during the war. Mr. Bernstein’s service as 
a part of this unit was heroic, and Illinois’ 
Eighth Congressional District was incredibly 
proud to see him awarded the Congressional 
Gold Medal earlier this year. 
Mr. Bluestein has, however, done much 
more in his life in addition to his exemplary 
service as a soldier. Since returning home, he 
has become a lifelong learner, enrolling in 
classes at Harper College for more than 30 
years and finishing art school. This year, at 98 
years old, he is fulfilling his life-long dream of 
learning to sculpt by taking classes at Harper 
College. 
Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the 
tremendous sacrifice and accomplishments of 
this humble man from Schaumburg, Illinois. 
Mr. Bluestein is a distinguished serviceman 
and remarkable citizen. He represents the val-
ues of integrity, service, and character that 
make our country a beacon to others around 
the world.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
RONALD CURTIS KNIGHT 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Ronald Curtis Knight who passed away on 
Monday, February 21, 2022 at North Mis-
sissippi Medical Center in Tupelo. I join his 
family, friends, and loved ones in mourning his 
loss. 
Curtis was born December 9, 1953 in 
Amory to Hubert Caroll Knight and Emma Mill 
er Langford. He briefly lived in Texas before 
returning to Amory. He attended Amory High 
School and joined the Army, where he served 
for 6 years. He worked on a riverboat on the 
Mississippi River for 15 years and was also 
employed by True Temper Sports. In 1994, he 
began his 28 year career in law enforcement. 
He began his career with the Aberdeen Police 
Department then joined the Monroe County 
Sheriffs department. He served as a jailer, pa-
trol, chief investigator, and retired as Chief 
Deputy. He served as Sheriff of Monroe Coun-
ty from June to December 2021. 
Outside of his law enforcement career, Cur-
tis was a Master mason in the J.A. Mayfield 
Lodge and he played golf, fished, and 
woodworked. He was a member of the First 
Baptist Church in Amory. 
Left to cherish his memory are wife, Tina; 
son, Josh; daughters Nikki and Tiffany; along 
with his brother, sister, and grandchildren. 
I am grateful for Curtis’ lifetime of service to 
the state of Mississippi. My deepest condo-
lences are with his family at this time.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF SUNNY KING 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 100th Anniversary 
of the Sunny King Automotive Group. 
In 1922, E. D. King acquired the Ford Motor 
Company franchise currently operated by King 
Motor Co., Inc. As a Ford franchise continu-
ously operated by the same family in the 
United States, it’s the second oldest in the 
State of Alabama and 18th oldest in the 
United States. 
Through a 1922 merger involving principals 
E. D. King, J. F. King and J. C. Wheeler, as 
well as Wheeler Motor Company and Oxford 
Motor Company, King-Wheeler Motor Co. was 
formed. An advertisement appearing in the 
April 7, 1922, edition of The Anniston Star 
stated King and Wheeler had been ‘‘in the 
Ford business for a number of years’’ and 
claimed the new combination assured ‘‘the 
trade of the best and finest service available’’. 
King Wheeler Motor Co. was conveniently 
located at 110 East 11th Street in downtown 
Anniston and the business retailed both cars 
and tractors. The company operated under the 
core principle: ‘‘every transaction must be sat-
isfactory . . . to every customer.’’ 
J. F. King left King Wheeler Motor Co. to 
pursue and operate a Lincoln franchise while 
E. D. King retained King Wheeler Motor Co. 
The name of the company was later changed 
to King Motor Company which was initially in-
corporated as King Motor Co., Inc. on Decem-
ber 15, 1947. 
In the early 1950s the leadership of King 
Motor Company transitioned from E. D. King, 
Sr., the meticulous, organized businessman to 
E. D. ‘‘Sunny’’ King, Jr., the flamboyant, ener-
getic promotor with the magnetic personality. 
E. D. King, Sr. became President and major 
shareholder in Anniston National Bank, that is 
now Regions Bank. 
Under the leadership of Sunny King, Jr., 
Sunny King Ford became a local household 
name through advertising and promotion. 
NASCAR stock car racing was a constant 
through sponsorship of great drivers like Bill 
Elliot, Donnie Allison and Ken Schrader. 
In 1971, the expansion of Sunny King Ford 
required relocation to a newly constructed fa-
cility located at 1507 South Quintard Avenue. 
This expansion continued until 1989 with the

addition of Honda, Chrysler Plymouth, AMC- 
Jeep-Renault, Isuzu, Subaru, Yugo, Daihatsu, 
Hyundai, Volvo, Sterling, Pontiac-Cadillac- 
GMC and Toyota franchises. Additional Honda 
franchises were opened in Auburn and 
Sylacauga and Acura franchises were located 
in Hoover and Huntsville. 
E. D. King, III and Henry L. King continue to 
operate the Auburn Honda franchise and the 
Hoover Acura franchise, respectively, to this 
day. 
Sunny King became a well-known, accom-
plished community leader throughout his ca-
reer. His many accomplishments included 
Time Dealer of the Year for Alabama (1988), 
Anniston Star Citizen of the Year in 1988 and 
an invitation to join the national Honda Dealer 
Council. 
King was a huge contributor and supporter 
of his community. Organizations such as Knox 
Concert Series, Northeast Alabama Boys and 
Girls Club, J. S. U. Foundation, Rainbow 
Omega, Salvation Army, United Way, Cerebral 
Palsy Center, CAST, Alabama Baptist Chil-
dren’s Home and numerous schools, churches 
and local charities have benefitted from this 
long-term generosity. Notable annual events 
such as the Sunny King Charity Classic, the 
Woodstock 5K and the Sunny King Criterium, 
continue to receive support from the Sunny 
King Automotive Group organization. 
On September 11, 1990, King, Jr. passed 
away following a brief battle with cancer. Patri-
cia M. King became the third successive King 
to assume the leadership role of the organiza-
tion, taking control during a difficult business 
and legal environment. In 2015, John T. 
Bryan, Jr. became the fourth President of King 
Motor Co., Inc. and the first not named King 
to assume that position. Through the leader-
ship of Patricia M. King and John T. Bryan, Jr. 
the Sunny King Automotive Group organiza-
tion was able to survive and grow. 
The company focused its financial resources 
on the Ford, Honda and Toyota franchises. 
New facilities were constructed for Sunny King 
Honda (2002) and Sunny King Toyota (2006) 
in Oxford. A major renovation to the 1507 
South Quintard facility of Sunny King Ford 
was completed in 2013. 
The Sunny King organization will celebrate 
this milestone on April 22 at the Anniston 
Country Club. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Sunny King Automotive Group on 
their 100th Anniversary.

Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
Colonel John C. Michaud has honorably 
served the United States Army for more than 
twenty-six years. He has served in numerous 
leadership roles within the officer corps from 
platoon leader to the Command Inspector 
General for the Mississippi National Guard. 
Colonel Michaud leaves a legacy defined by 
selfless service and sacrifice which will have a 
lasting impact on the U.S. Army. 
Colonel Michaud received a commission as 
a Second Lieutenant after graduating from the

signed to the 25th Infantry Division at 
Schofield Barrack, Hawaii where he served in 
numerous leadership roles, culminating in his 
serving as a battery commander. 
In 2005, Colonel Michaud graduated from 
the Naval Postgraduate School with a degree 
in Operations Research and was subsequently 
assigned to the TRADOC Analysis Center in 
FT. Leavenworth, Kansas where he served in 
numerous roles as a strategic analyst. In 
2007, Colonel Michaud was mobilized in sup-
port of Operation Enduring Freedom and as-
signed to Combined Joint Task Force 82 lo-
cated in Bagram, Afghanistan. 
Upon his return from Afghanistan, he contin-
ued his service as an analyst for major com-
mands across the Department of Defense in-
cluding the Defense Logistics Agency; United 
States Central Command; and United States 
Strategic Command. 
In 2018, Colonel Michaud was assigned as 
the Command Inspector General for the Mis-
sissippi National Guard where he provided his 
assistance and expertise on complicated and 
critical matters affecting the Soldiers and Air-
men of the Mississippi National Guard. Colo-
nel Michaud will effectively retire on August 
31, 2022, after having led an exemplary ca-
reer. 
I am grateful for Colonel Michaud’s service 
to the state of Mississippi and this Nation.
