PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, ruler of the universe, we 
rejoice because You are near. Lord, we 
are grateful we belong to You, and You 
desire us to call You our Father in 
good and bad times. We can face any 
calamity with the knowledge that 
nothing can separate us from Your 
love. Death and life can’t. Our fears for 
today and our worries about tomorrow 
can’t. Whether we are high above the 
clouds or in the deepest ocean, nothing 
in all creation can separate us from 
You. May this knowledge of Your abid-
ing and indestructible love inspire our 
Senators to trust You with all their 
hearts and depend upon Your wisdom. 
We pray in Your awesome Name. 
Amen.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
our Nation is caught within a number 
of grave problems at the same time. 
This week, in cities all across Amer-
ica, the pain of racial injustice has 
been compounded by violent riots that 
have drowned out peaceful protests and 
hurt innocent people. Millions of work-
ing families continue to face the his-
toric 
economic 
fallout 
from 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, including unem-
ployment levels not seen in decades, 
and, lest we forget, the actual pan-
demic itself is still with us. The virus 
continues to claim hundreds of Amer-
ican 
lives 
every 
day, 
challenge 
healthcare professionals, and paralyze 
schools, universities, and employers 
that are eager to reopen. Of course, 
there is also the important business we 
would have needed to have addressed 
even before the pandemic. 
So, for all of these reasons and more, 
while the Democratic House of Rep-
resentatives may be absent—with no 
plans to return for weeks and weeks— 
the U.S. Senate is here and working for 
the American people. 
This week, we are filling more crit-
ical vacancies throughout our govern-
ment. Yesterday, we confirmed the 
Special Inspector General for Pan-
demic Response. This is a brandnew po-
sition born of immediate necessity and 
goals shared by Members of both par-
ties. Yet, though our Democratic col-
leagues said for weeks that CARES Act 
oversight was a top priority, our col-
leagues chose to delay this nomination 
for as long as possible. When the rubber 
met the road, yet again, picking small 
fights with President Trump took prec-
edence over urgent work for the com-
mon good. 
At the same time, we also hear from 
the very same Democratic colleagues 
that they wish the Senate would spend 
less time on nominations. Well, the 
good news is that the Senate Demo-
crats can change that whenever they 
want, but as long as they continue to 
visit delays and obstruction on even 
these lower level executive branch ap-
pointments, just for the sake of irri-
tating the White House, the Senate 
will continue to do our job the hard 
way. 
Of course, in the weeks ahead, we 
will also tackle significant legislation

for our country. We will turn to legis-
lation to strengthen the implementa-
tion of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram for the workers and small busi-
nesses that are struggling to weather 
this storm. We will consider a bipar-
tisan bill from Senators DAINES and 
GARDNER to safeguard America’s abun-
dant public lands. For the 60th con-
secutive year, we will also take up the 
National Defense Authorization Act to 
help guide the strategic and oper-
ational 
priorities 
of 
our 
Nation’s 
Armed Forces in the face of evolving 
threats. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
make no mistake, the foreign actors 
who seek to harm the United States 
have not let up while we have attended 
to other problems. For example, in Af-
ghanistan, 
despite 
agreeing 
just 
months ago to engage in further peace 
negotiations with the Afghan Govern-
ment and sever its ties with al-Qaida, 
the Taliban has, instead, continued its 
violent campaign against the Afghan 
people. 
President Trump has expressed frus-
tration with the Taliban’s failures and 
is reportedly considering withdrawing 
from Afghanistan even more rapidly. 
Yet, as we weigh our options, we must 
not forget the painful lessons of the 
last administration’s mistakes. 
Former President Obama and Vice 
President Biden were intent on beating 
a hasty retreat from Iraq, conditions 
on the ground notwithstanding. Just as 
many of us warned at the time, their 
recklessness left a vacuum that terror-
ists and Iran readily filled. ISIS flour-
ished. Tragically, the rest is history. 
The resulting chaos threatened our in-
terests and drew American efforts back 
into the region. 
By contrast, the Trump administra-
tion has seen a number of successes in 
this difficult region. The President’s 
strategy has secured a territorial de-
feat of ISIS. It has put new pressure on 
Iran and given the Iraqi people a fight-
ing chance, which their new govern-
ment seems inclined to take. 
Yet helping Iraq stand up to Iranian 
influence will not be an overnight 
project. Iran wants to drive the United 
States from the region. China and Rus-
sia would also be thrilled with a reduc-
tion of American presence and influ-
ence there. So, as we struggle to clean 
up the broken pieces of one rushed 
withdrawal, we need to avoid repeating 
those mistakes somewhere else. 
I applaud the Trump administration 
for its approach thus far in Afghani-
stan. The President has taken con-
straints off U.S. forces. We have helped 
Afghan forces go after the terrorists. 
We have ratcheted up the costs on the 
Taliban, bolstered the Afghan forces 
that bear the brunt of the violence, and 
won international support for our mis-
sion there. We have done all of this 
with fewer resources and fewer per-
sonnel than during the previous two 
administrations. The President’s strat-
egy and diplomacy have helped create 
a path for discussions among Afghans— 
the only thing that could actually se-
cure the country’s future. 
If these qualified successes continue, 
it would be appropriate to further re-
duce our American presence as certain 
conditions are met, but we must retain 
enough forces and influence to main-
tain our counterterrorism capabilities. 
Given recent reports and our long-
standing experience, we cannot just 
trust the Taliban will sever ties to al- 
Qaida and other terrorist networks. We 
need to be vigilant. We need to main-
tain enough presence to judge whether 
the Taliban complies with agreements 
and help the Afghan Government im-
pose consequences if it does not. We 
need to maintain enough presence to 
preserve our strategic foothold against 
ISIS, the Haqqani Network, and al- 
Qaida. We should also maintain enough 
presence to help prevent a full replay 
of Iraq or Syria—a bloodbath and a 
human rights collapse, particularly for 
generations of Afghan women. 
Last year, a bipartisan supermajority 
in the Senate voted for an amendment 
I authored, which warned against pre-
cipitous withdrawals from Afghanistan 
and Syria in ways that could jeopardize 
the hard-won progress we have at-
tained, embolden Iran and Russia, and 
create more pain for us and everyone 
else in the future. 
Our enemies would be thrilled if the 
United States would grow too tired to 
continue the hard work of standing 
with our partners, confronting our ad-
versaries, and maintaining measured 
leadership that projects our security 
around the world. Our enemies would 
be delighted if we would grow too 
weary to act in our own long-term in-
terest. We must not give them that 
satisfaction.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
PROTESTS AND BUSINESS OF THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this has been a very difficult week 
after what has been a very difficult few 
months. A nation, beleaguered by dis-
ease and economic depression, has once 
again come face-to-face with the racial 
injustice that infects our society. The 
death of George Floyd in police cus-
tody was a searing reminder of a long 
list of unarmed African Americans 
whose lives have been taken under 
similar circumstances—Breonna Tay-
lor, Ahmaud Arbery, and too many oth-
ers—a well of grief and loss and pain 
too deep to express. It was a searing re-
minder of the bigotry and discrimina-
tion that African Americans encounter 
as part of their daily reality. 
That is why so many Americans of 
all ages, colors, and faiths are out in 
the streets protesting right now. They 
are fed up with racial injustice in this 
country and want to see some change. 
Here in the Senate, Member after 
Member has come to the floor to share 
support for the same cause. 
Yesterday, our caucus held a somber, 
emotional, and very personal meeting, 
during which our Members shared their 
own lived experiences of racism and 
spoke about what we need to do next 
because the truth is, while speeches 
and protests are vital, they will never 
be enough. 
We need greater accountability and 
transparency in police departments 
and reformed police practices so these 
events don’t happen in the first place. 
We need to reform the criminal justice 
system that is still too short on justice 
and begin chipping away at the racial 
disparities that exist in healthcare, 
housing, education, and in the econ-
omy. 
These issues will not be solved in a 
week or a month or in a year. Let’s 
hope they can be solved in this decade. 
But I will be damned if we don’t at 
least try to make some progress. Al-
ready, my colleagues Senators BOOKER, 
HARRIS, 
CARDIN, 
KLOBUCHAR, 
DUCKWORTH, SCHATZ, SMITH, and others 
are working with the Congressional 
Black Caucus in the House to develop 
legislation to address a number of 
issues related to police violence and ra-
cial justice. Senate Democrats will not 
wait to propose and push for bold, bold 
change. 
Will our Republican colleagues join 
us? Leader MCCONNELL, commit to put 
a law enforcement reform bill on the 
floor of the Senate before July 4.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2661 
June 3, 2020 
I have made this request for several 
days without an answer from the Re-
publican 
leader. 
Even 
more 
dis-
appointing, 
the 
Republican 
leader 
blocked a simple resolution I offered 
last night that reaffirmed Americans’ 
constitutional rights to peaceful pro-
test, condemned the violence that is 
occurring in too many places, and con-
demned the President as well for hav-
ing gas and rubber bullets used on a 
peaceful protest in Lafayette Park, 
where there were families and children 
protesting in the grand American tra-
dition of peaceful protest. 
There was no partisan rhetoric in 
this resolution. It was three simple 
concepts, a recitation of the facts, but 
because Senate Republicans are so 
afraid—shivering—at the thought of 
criticizing the President, even when 
they know his actions are way out of 
line, Leader MCCONNELL
came and 
blocked this resolution. Shame, shame, 
shame. 
We all know there are very few 
checks on the President, especially a 
President who believes he can do any-
thing he wants—and he said it. One of 
the most effective checks on President 
Trump could be the caucus of Repub-
lican Senators for once standing up to 
him when he is way out of line. Where 
are they? Where are they? 
Even a columnist like George Will 
has shown a disgust at the Republican 
Senate, and he is a conservative, for 
their failure to stand up to Donald 
Trump on issues like this. All too often 
on thorny issues such as gun safety, ra-
cial justice, and police reform, my Re-
publican colleagues sort of say what is 
necessary to get through the day, when 
there is an immediate crisis, and then 
wait for public attention to fade. 
Leader MCCONNELL
called us back 
into session in early May during the 
height of the COVID pandemic, but we 
still have not considered a single piece 
of legislation on the floor. Now listen 
to 
this. 
Yesterday, 
when 
Leader 
MCCONNELL was listing legislative pri-
orities for June, he did not mention 
COVID legislation. Let me repeat for 
those who may have missed it in the 
swirl of news and events of the day. 
When listing his June priorities to re-
porters, Leader MCCONNELL
did not 
mention 
COVID-related 
legislation. 
Other Republican Senators have said 
that another relief bill might come in 
late July—might, might. 
This is shocking. This should be a 
wake-up call to the American people. 
Americans of all ages, races, creeds, 
and philosophies, call your Republican 
Senators. Demand action. 
The recession will get deeper. It 
could develop into a depression if we 
don’t have relief. We have not done 
enough in the eyes of every economist 
I have looked at and respected. Gov-
ernors and mayors across the country 
in red States are slashing budgets in 
advance of the new fiscal year, which 
for most States starts July 1. States 
will be forced to cut millions of jobs 
and critical services. These cuts mean 
increased school class sizes, longer 
emergency response times, fewer serv-
ices to keep the elderly at home and 
out of nursing homes. These cuts not 
only exacerbate the recession but the 
wrath of the coronavirus itself. That is 
what is happening while Senate Repub-
licans wait until July, maybe, to con-
sider another relief bill. 
America, look at what our Repub-
licans are doing: not giving the relief 
you need for your safety, for your 
schools, for the services that local gov-
ernment provides. 
The 
Republican 
majority 
doesn’t 
seem to have time to address a cas-
cading series of national crises—no 
time. Why is that? 
Where is President Trump? Where is 
his Cabinet? They all know that we 
need more. They all know we haven’t 
solved the economic problem—far from 
it. They all know that we have to do a 
lot more on testing. 
So our Republican majority doesn’t 
seem to have time to address the 
COVID national crisis, but do you 
know what it does have time for? Chas-
ing President Trump’s wild conspiracy 
theories. It sounds like the death knell 
of the Republican Party as we know it. 
They can’t deal with the two major cri-
ses of the day—racial justice and the 
COVID crisis—and they are busy pur-
suing conspiracy theories, some of 
them emanating from Russia, to go 
after President Obama and Vice Presi-
dent Biden. 
This makes no sense. This, again, 
sounds like the death knell of the Re-
publican Party. The Republican Party 
we used to know would have some prin-
ciples but not be afraid to run to every 
major issue—to any major issue al-
most. But that is what they are doing. 
Today, in the Judiciary Committee, 
the Republican committee chairman 
has called in Rod Rosenstein to dredge 
up the President’s favorite conspiracy 
theory related to the 2016 election. It is 
an egregious misuse of the institu-
tion—the Senate. 
Nearly a quarter of our workforce is 
unemployed. Over 100,000 Americans 
are dead from a strange and contagious 
disease; Americans are in the streets 
demanding racial justice; and shop-
worn, discredited conspiracy theories 
are what the Republican majority is fo-
cused on? What alternative universe do 
they live in? What alternative reality 
are they in the midst of? One detached 
from the real reality that the Amer-
ican people face: conspiracy theories to 
help 
President 
Trump’s 
reelection, 
rightwing judges, many of whom have 
antipathy to the civil rights we are 
talking about now. 
The Republican Party in the Senate 
has moved so far into a corner, the cor-
ner that Donald Trump is in, that they 
can’t address two of the most impor-
tant and major issues that have af-
fected this country in decades. 
The American people should be furi-
ous with the Republican Senate major-
ity, and the American people and histo-
rians will record with sadness how this 
once great party, even though I didn’t 
agree with it, has declined so—no cour-
age, no principle, but simply cowering 
for President Trump and his crazy 
theories that even they know are 
crazy. 
The American people, of course, 
should be furious with the President as 
well. On Monday night, Americans 
watched Federal officers, under the di-
rection of the President and the Attor-
ney General, use gas and rubber bullets 
to disperse a crowd of peaceful pro-
testers in a public park so that the 
President could stage a photo op in 
front of a church, waving the Holy 
Bible as a prop. 
Last night, Americans saw an even 
more haunting image on the internet 
and their televisions: rows of camou-
flage troops standing at attention on 
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, like 
an occupying force defending a critical 
position. 
When you see the image of troops 
dressed for combat flanking the Lin-
coln Memorial, an altar of freedom, 
you 
cannot 
help 
but 
think 
of 
Tiananmen Square. This administra-
tion ordered Federal officers to gas 
peaceful 
protesters 
and 
charge 
on 
horseback and defend our monuments 
like battlefield positions. 
What is President Trump doing to 
this grand democracy? What is he 
doing? And why are our Republican 
colleagues just going along? 
President Lincoln’s second inaugural 
address is engraved in that building 
where armed soldiers stood. During a 
moment of extreme political division 
and civil strife, President Lincoln 
urged malice toward none, charity to-
ward all, and sought to bind up the Na-
tion’s wounds. 
There could be no greater contrast 
between Lincoln and this President, 
this President who seems to have mal-
ice toward all and charity for none, 
who seeks to deepen our Nation’s 
wounds rather than bind them up. Our 
Nation is crying out for leadership, for 
direction, for some healing and some 
unity. Will this President even try to 
provide it? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip is recognized. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I 
want to speak here in just a moment to 
the issue of internet traffic and how 
that 
has 
been 
impacted 
by 
the 
coronavirus, how it has impacted our 
lives during the coronavirus. Before I 
do that, though, I want to just respond 
to a few things the Democratic leader 
mentioned. 
He again pointed out that the Repub-
lican Senate isn’t doing work here. It 
is hard to fathom how he can possibly 
come to that conclusion. The Demo-
crat-run House of Representatives is 
out of session for the entire month— 
the entire month of June. They are not 
even here. The Democratic House of 
Representatives isn’t even in town. 
The Senate is here doing work, and 
important work, I might add. He said

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2662 
June 3, 2020 
we haven’t passed any legislation. 
Well, the week before the Memorial 
Day break we passed the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act reauthoriza-
tion, a critical piece of national secu-
rity and intelligence legislation that 
all our intelligence experts tell us is 
critical to fighting the war against ter-
rorists. Pretty important legislation, I 
would say. 
He pointed out that the agenda for 
the month of June doesn’t include 
much. Well, that is only if you don’t 
think that the National Defense Au-
thorization 
Act 
is 
not 
important. 
Funding the military, authorizing the 
weapons 
systems, 
paying 
the 
per-
sonnel, 
the 
technology, 
the 
intel-
ligence, all the things that go into pro-
tecting the country seem to me to be 
pretty important. 
So the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act is a piece of legislation that 
the Senate will process during the up-
coming weeks here in the month of 
June. In fact, that will probably take a 
good week to move across the floor of 
the Senate. It typically does. It is 
something we have to do on an annual 
basis, but there is nothing more impor-
tant and more critical to the national 
security of the United States than the 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
We will be passing a major parks bill 
this next week, which will help fund 
the backlog in a lot of our national 
parks—something that has been a pri-
ority for many Democrats here in this 
Chamber for a long time. In fact, it is 
a great bipartisan bill. In fact, I think, 
out of the Democratic caucus, there 
are somewhere on the order of 43 of the 
47 Democrats who are cosponsoring the 
piece of legislation that will be called 
up later this week and be on the floor 
most of next week. 
So it is something that has been 
around here for a while. It is going to 
be a major legislative accomplishment. 
It will be a bipartisan accomplishment 
when it passes. 
So I would just say that the fact that 
we aren’t doing the things the Demo-
cratic leader wants to do doesn’t mean 
the Senate isn’t very busy. The things 
he wants to do, the things he talks 
about wanting to do, are things that we 
are doing. We are dealing with the 
coronavirus on a daily basis around 
here. 
I am a member of the Senate Finance 
Committee. Yesterday, the Senate Fi-
nance Committee had a hearing in 
which officials from the FDA, for ex-
ample, critical agencies when it comes 
particularly to pharmaceuticals in this 
country, attended, and the subject of 
the hearing was the pharmaceutical 
supply chain and what we need to do to 
shore that up, to make sure that in fu-
ture pandemics, with lessons learned 
from this one, we aren’t dependent 
upon unreliable supply chains in places 
around the world that, frankly, may 
not be dependable. That is a pretty im-
portant issue when it comes to dealing 
with the effects and the impacts of the 
coronavirus. 
Today, in the Senate Commerce 
Committee, 
another 
committee 
on 
which I serve, we are going to be exam-
ining the impact of the coronavirus on 
our transportation infrastructure and 
how important this transportation has 
been throughout the course of the 
coronavirus in ensuring that we keep 
commerce going, that we keep food in 
the grocery stores. 
We are going to be looking at both 
the highway aspect, the rail aspect—all 
of those—and how they are impacted 
by the coronavirus and what we might 
need to do to ensure that they continue 
to be able to provide the services that 
they do going forward. 
So we are consistently looking at, on 
a daily basis, the coronavirus, the im-
pact it is having on our economy, the 
impact it is having on the health of 
people in this country, the health 
emergency, and putting measures in 
place that would deal not only with 
that health emergency but also with 
the economic crisis created by it. 
In the meantime, we are seeing the 
economy start to open up again, which 
I think is a very good thing. I am hope-
ful we will see, as the economy opens 
up, that people will get out, consumers 
will spend, investors will invest, and 
we will see that economy start to grow 
again, jobs to come back. 
Obviously, we have very high unem-
ployment right now—a major concern. 
We also have a major unemployment 
insurance piece of legislation that was 
moved by this Congress earlier to pro-
vide assistance and help for those who, 
through no fault of their own, have had 
to go on unemployment. 
To suggest for a moment that we 
aren’t focused on the coronavirus is 
completely missing the point—as is to 
suggest, also, that we haven’t done a 
lot already. We passed four major 
pieces of legislation, totaling almost $3 
trillion, and that is $3 trillion if you 
don’t include the amount of leverage 
we gave to the Federal Reserve and the 
Treasury to extend credit and create li-
quidity out there. With the power of 
that leverage, it is somewhere on the 
order of about $6 trillion in assistance 
that we have put out there through dif-
ferent legislative vehicles to the Amer-
ican people. 
So you are seeing that translated 
into the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, which is keeping people em-
ployed, keeping jobs in this country, 
keeping businesses functioning and op-
erating. It has been a very successful 
program. 
You are seeing it in the form of di-
rect assistance to State and local gov-
ernments. And $150 billion has been put 
out there, much of which hasn’t been 
spent, and that is on top of a lot of 
other assistance to State and local gov-
ernments, which totals somewhere on 
the order of about $500 billion. Almost 
half a trillion dollars, so far, sum total, 
has gone out to State and local govern-
ments. 
Much of that, as I said, is in the pipe-
line, hasn’t been spent yet. It can be 
used, as the Treasury has pointed out, 
given the States’ flexibility, for emer-
gency personnel, first responders, po-
lice, all the things that the Senator 
from New York talked about. That is 
flexibility the States have now to be 
able to meet the needs that they have 
and to work with their local govern-
ments and meet the needs of the local 
governments. 
So there is a lot of money in the 
pipeline, not to mention, of course, 
first and foremost, the money we put 
out there for investment in thera-
peutics, in vaccines, in diagnostic test-
ing, and all the money that has gone 
out to hospitals and nursing home pro-
viders and long-term care facilities to 
help them get through this crisis in the 
form of direct assistance. So there is a 
lot of money in the pipeline—as I said, 
about $2.9 trillion that has already 
been authorized, and I think about 40 
percent, maybe, has been spent. So 
there is still a lot of assistance going 
out there. 
My friend, the Democratic leader, 
would just want to put a whole bunch 
more money out there without know-
ing what the need is, and I think, at a 
time when we are already running a $21 
trillion—now 
$25 
trillion—debt, 
we 
ought to be very circumspect and pay 
attention to what is happening in our 
economy, what the needs are, what we 
need to keep the economy opening up 
and responding, what we continue to 
need to do to help people who are un-
employed, what we continue to need to 
do to help families in this country who 
are struggling through this crisis. 
But we ought to do that based on the 
need, not just somebody saying: Well, 
let’s just throw a bunch more money 
out there and hope that it has an im-
pact. We have done that. We have 
flooded the zone with dollars. There is 
a tremendous amount of resources out 
there right now, a lot of which has yet 
to be spent, and it strikes me, at least, 
that, in the eyes of most Americans, 
they would view it as pretty impor-
tant, 
before 
we 
spend 
more 
tax 
money—all of which, I might add, is 
going to be borrowed money—that we 
see how what we have done already is 
working, if it has been effective and is 
having the desired impact. 
There is so much going on around 
here dealing with the coronavirus, it 
just completely defies any sort of logic 
to what the Democratic leader sug-
gested was happening here in the Sen-
ate. 
He made one other comment, which I 
think I have to respond to. He said that 
the Senate is in the process—Repub-
licans in the Senate are processing 
rightwing judges who have antipathy 
for the very civil rights issues that we 
are dealing with right now. 
I don’t know how you can make a 
statement like that. I don’t know how 
you can ascribe motive or intent to 
judges. You don’t know who these 
judges are. 
We have a judge we are going to be 
processing here for the DC circuit. It is

a pretty important circuit in this coun-
try. He is the district judge from Ken-
tucky. He has been rated as very ‘‘well 
qualified’’ by the American Bar Asso-
ciation. The American Bar Association 
isn’t a rightwing group at all. In fact, 
many on our side think they certainly 
drift the other direction. Yet they have 
said this judge is a well-qualified judge. 
Do you think they would be saying 
something like that about a judge who 
had antipathy for civil rights? I mean, 
that is just, I would say, a reckless and 
irresponsible 
statement 
unless 
you 
have something to back that up and 
support it. 
So I just thought it would be impor-
tant to respond to some of the things 
that the Democratic leader just said 
with respect to the agenda here in the 
Senate, which, as I pointed out earlier, 
is a very full one. If you compare it to 
the agenda of our colleagues in the 
Democrat-controlled House, which is 
zilch because they are not here for the 
entire month, it seems to me the Sen-
ate is getting a lot of work done. 
5G 
So, Madam President, what I came 
here to talk about—I came down to the 
floor a couple of weeks ago to talk 
about how the coronavirus is high-
lighting 
the 
importance 
of 
strong 
internet networks. 
Despite the surge we have seen in 
internet traffic that the coronavirus 
has produced, with Americans using 
the internet for everything from work 
to school to family dinners, U.S. net-
works have held up tremendously well. 
Americans have been able to enjoy 
the same speed and streaming quality 
that they typically enjoy, something 
that hasn’t happened in a lot of other 
countries, and that is a direct result of 
the United States’ light-touch ap-
proach to internet regulation, which 
has encouraged American companies to 
invest in the latest communications in-
frastructure and new technologies to 
make more efficient use of spectrum. 
Our Nation is currently preparing for 
the widespread adoption of the next 
generation of internet technology— 
what is known as 5G. We need to make 
sure that our 5G networks will be as 
strong as our current networks, but we 
still have some work to do to get to 
that point. 
I come down here frequently to the 
floor to discuss that work, which in-
cludes paving the way for the wide-
spread installation of the small cells 
that are necessary for 5G networks, en-
hancing the availability of the mid- 
band spectrum that is necessary for 5G 
deployment, and investing in a 5G 
workforce. 
But there is also another aspect we 
need to think about when it comes to 
5G, which is sometimes not talked 
about as much, and that is network se-
curity. With its incredible speed and 
connectivity, 5G will usher in a new 
era of innovation: advances in medical 
care, the large-scale deployment of pre-
cision agriculture, safer transportation 
technologies. 5G will bring all of these 
things and more. 
But like any new technology, 5G net-
works will present new risks and vul-
nerabilities. And because 5G will mean 
a vastly greater number of connected 
devices, the risks with 5G will be great-
er. That is the why a central part of de-
ploying 5G networks has to be looking 
at how we can mitigate security risks. 
We need to ensure that our compo-
nent parts of our devices and, criti-
cally, the component parts of tele-
communications networks, like cell 
towers and the small cells that will be 
required for 5G, are secure. A primary 
way to do that is by ensuring that 5G 
equipment comes from trusted vendors. 
Currently, one of the biggest sup-
pliers of 5G equipment worldwide is a 
Chinese company, Huawei, which is 
supported by the Chinese Government. 
China’s 2017 national intelligence law 
requires Chinese companies to support 
the Chinese Government’s intelligence 
activities. American security officials 
have raised concerns that much of 
Huawei’s equipment is built with back 
doors that give the Chinese Govern-
ment access to global communications 
networks. 
I don’t need to tell anyone that we 
should be wary of China’s motives and 
that China’s interests are frequently 
opposed to those of the United States. 
China’s handling of the coronavirus 
is a striking current example of the 
Chinese Government’s prioritizing its 
own interests or pride over the public 
good. As a New York Times article 
noted in February, ‘‘The [Chinese] gov-
ernment’s initial handling of the epi-
demic allowed the virus to gain a tena-
cious hold. At critical moments, offi-
cials chose to put secrecy and order 
ahead of openly confronting the grow-
ing crisis to avoid political alarm and 
political embarrassment.’’ 
Whether it was driven by the hubris 
of the Communist Party or merely the 
callous indifference the Communist 
state has for the well-being of its own 
citizens, China was not transparent 
about the grave danger of COVID–19. It 
failed to release accurate information 
about the nature and spread of the 
virus, and it took active steps to make 
sure the truth did not get out in other 
ways. Whistleblowers were punished; 
the centers were censored; and journal-
ists were expelled. 
Despite the fact that its negligence 
undoubtedly contributed to the global 
spread of COVID–19, China still con-
tinues to be less than forthcoming 
about the virus. Unfortunately, this is 
run-of-the-mill governing in China, as 
we saw with the SARS outbreak in the 
early 2000s and as we have seen in 
many other instances. 
Not content with its role in aggra-
vating the spread of the coronavirus, 
the Chinese Communist Party has also 
taken advantage of the pandemic to 
strip Hong Kong of its autonomy and 
freedom. China’s hope is that our Na-
tion is too preoccupied with this pan-
demic to notice its efforts to under-
mine what should be Hong Kong’s au-
tonomy under the one state, two sys-
tems construct. 
We have noticed. As many of my col-
leagues and I have expressed, we stand 
with Hong Kong. We must carefully 
consider an appropriate response, one 
that will rebuke the Communist Party 
of China without negatively affecting 
the people of Hong Kong, their well- 
being, and their democratic aspira-
tions. 
We didn’t need COVID–19 or China’s 
recent actions in Hong Kong to know 
that giving the Chinese Government a 
backdoor into American communica-
tions networks is a bad idea. But it cer-
tainly underscores the need to make 
sure that 5G infrastructure is not made 
by companies beholden to the Chinese 
Government. The United States has 
taken a number of steps to prevent 
equipment from Huawei and another 
suspect Chinese company, ZTE, from 
being used in U.S. communications 
networks, but these companies still 
pose a risk to the United States. 
For starters, some U.S. broadband 
providers, often in rural areas, still 
have equipment from Huawei and ZTE 
in their communications networks. A 
number of our allies and trade part-
ners—entities with whom we regularly 
share information, including sensitive 
national 
security 
information—have 
used or are using technology from 
Huawei and ZTE. 
What can we do? An initiative is al-
ready underway to replace suspect tele-
communications components in U.S. 
networks with hardware from trusted 
companies. 
In March, the President signed legis-
lation developed by the Commerce 
Committee chairman, ROGER WICKER, 
the Secure and Trusted Communica-
tions Network Act, to help speed up 
this process. This legislation, which I 
cosponsored, 
will 
help 
small 
tele-
communications providers with the 
cost of replacing network components 
that pose a security risk. 
Also, In March, I introduced legisla-
tion to help address the other part of 
the problem, and that is the use of 
Huawei technology by our allies and 
our trading partners. We regularly ex-
change 
information, 
including 
sen-
sitive national security information, 
with our allies and trading partners. 
And this information can only be se-
cure if networks on both ends are se-
cure. That is why the United States 
has called for other countries to reject 
telecommunications technology from 
Huawei and ZTE. 
A number of countries have com-
mitted to using trusted companies to 
build out their telecommunications 
networks, but other countries are still 
planning to make use of Huawei’s tech-
nology. My legislation, the Network 
Security Trade Act, would make tele-
communications security a key objec-
tive when negotiating future trade 
deals. 
We should be using trade agreements 
to push for enhanced network security 
globally, which would benefit not only 
our country but every country with 
which we do business.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2664 
June 3, 2020 
We recently opened negotiations on a 
new trade deal with the United King-
dom, which has been using Huawei 
technology to build its 5G networks. I 
am pleased that it now looks like the 
UK is reconsidering its use of Huawei 
components. I hope they will decide to 
reject the suspect technology. 
I hope the trade negotiations will 
emphasize the importance of using 
trusted companies to build out the 
UK’s 
telecommunications 
networks. 
The security of our communications 
with our trading partners and allies— 
particularly those allies like Britain— 
needs to be a priority. 
As we move forward into the 5G fu-
ture, we need to make sure that our 
technological 
advancements 
are 
matched with advancements and net-
work security. That starts with keep-
ing Huawei and other suspect tech-
nology out of our networks and, if at 
all possible, out of the networks of our 
allies. 
I will continue to do everything I can 
to ensure that we have not only the in-
frastructure but the security needed to 
keep American networks at the fore-
front of the telecommunications revo-
lution. 
Before I close, let me just say one 
more word about China. As I said ear-
lier, China’s coronavirus deception is 
undoubtedly partly responsible for the 
fact that this virus has now spread to 
every corner of the world. China’s re-
cent actions with regard to Hong Kong 
underscore the hostility of the Chinese 
Government to the values that free-
dom-loving countries hold dear. 
China has a lot of work to do if it 
ever hopes to rebuild trust with other 
nations. At a bare minimum, we expect 
China to uphold its recent trade com-
mitments, which are critical to Amer-
ica’s hard-hit farmers and ranchers. I 
will be looking, and our entire govern-
ment will be looking, to see if China’s 
word on trade agreements can be relied 
upon. I hope that the Chinese Govern-
ment will live up to its commitments. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that following my 
remarks, the senior Senator from Okla-
homa is recognized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
note with some interest that one Re-
publican colleague after another comes 
to the floor—their ‘‘protect the Presi-
dent at all costs’’ colleagues, no matter 
what he does, no matter what he says, 
no matter how he acts, no matter how 
incompetent, no matter how divisive— 
and continues to point their fingers at 
the Chinese for the coronavirus. God 
knows, China deserves heaps of blame 
for the outbreak in the early spread of 
the coronavirus. There is no question 
they deserve a lot of blame for the out-
break in the early spread, and they are 
lying about it. But keep in mind that 
we are 5 percent of the world’s popu-
lation, and 30 percent of the deaths 
from the coronavirus have been Ameri-
cans. This President continues to make 
excuses and point fingers. And the 
compliant, always obedient, sheeplike 
Members of the Republican caucus con-
ference of the Senate continue to stay 
quiet, continue to do nothing about 
this 
President’s 
behavior 
and 
the 
105,000 deaths from coronavirus in this 
country. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. President, the protests around 
our State, throughout our country, are 
an expression of fear and grief and frus-
tration and of anger. Black commu-
nities led the Nation in mourning the 
killings of George Floyd and Breonna 
Taylor over the last week. They are 
now leading calls for justice and long- 
term changes to dismantle the systems 
of oppression that hold them back. 
Instead of listening to those calls 
from the people who built this country, 
instead of offering leadership and ris-
ing to meet this moment—as every one 
of his predecessors of both parties did 
in times of trouble for our country— 
President Trump fails yet again. In-
stead of uniting, he divides. Instead of 
comforting, he stokes fear. He points 
fingers. He places blame. Instead of 
healing, he rubs salt in the open 
wounds of Black Americans. 
On Monday night, the President of 
the United States turned the arm of 
the state on peaceful protesters—we 
saw the video—tear-gassing the citi-
zens he is supposed to serve, all so he 
could walk across the street and stage 
a photo op at a church he doesn’t at-
tend and hold up a Bible that he 
doesn’t read. The timid—you choose 
the adjective—timid, cowardly, spine-
less Republican colleagues in this Sen-
ate just remained silent. How offended 
they would have been if a Democratic 
President had done what this President 
does and fails to do—the tear-gassing 
of citizens he is supposed to serve, the 
photo op at a church, the holding up of 
the Bible he doesn’t read, the excuses, 
the divisiveness, all of that. 
People are tired. People are angry: 
more Black sons and daughters and 
mothers and fathers killed by police of-
ficers—the very people who are sup-
posed to protect all Americans; more 
death, when many are already griev-
ing—so many in the Black community 
already grieving the loss of family 
members 
and 
friends 
for 
the 
coronavirus, grappling with the eco-
nomic stress this pandemic has caused. 
The pandemic has been the ‘‘great re-
vealer.’’ We know Black and Brown 
communities have been hit hardest by 
the coronavirus. They are more likely 
to get sick. They have less access to 
healthcare. They make up the commu-
nities hurt by Jim Crow laws and red-
lining and now the locking in of those 
rules and regulations by the Trump ad-
ministration. Black and Brown com-
munities disproportionately make up 
our essential workers. It is not because 
they don’t work as hard. It is not be-
cause of individual choices. We all 
work hard. We are all trying to do 
something productive for our families 
and our communities. We all want to 
build a better country for our daugh-
ters and our sons. No; it is because of a 
racist system that is making it harder 
for their work to pay off and putting at 
risk their lives for generations, long 
before this virus appeared. 
A grocery store worker in Cincinnati 
said to me: They tell me I am essential, 
but I feel expendable. I don’t feel safe 
at work, and they don’t pay me very 
much. I feel expendable. 
Long before this pandemic, millions 
of Americans knew we had a system 
that treats them like they are expend-
able. Their hard work isn’t paying off. 
For some, it feels like the system is 
broken. For Black and Brown workers, 
it never worked to begin with. 
In the midst of the trauma and the 
grieving, millions of those same Ameri-
cans still go to work day after day, 
week after week, in grocery stores, as 
delivery people, in drugstores, as bus-
drivers, and the people who do the 
linen and change the beds in hospitals, 
the 
food 
service 
workers, 
the 
custodians, the security people, the 
first responders. In the midst of the 
trauma and grieving, those same Amer-
icans—millions of them—still go to 
work day after day, week after week. 
Our job is to show the victims of sys-
temic racism at the hands of their own 
government that the same government 
can and will protect them from this 
pandemic. We hear them. We see them. 
We fight for them. Their lives matter. 
Our response to this crisis must be to 
stand behind all the people who make 
this country work, all workers, wheth-
er you swipe a badge or punch a clock, 
whether you earn a salary or make 
tips, whether you are raising children 
or caring for an aging parent; all work-
ers, whether your hard work isn’t pay-
ing off now or whether it never paid off 
the way it should. 
Dr. King said: 
One day our society will come to respect 
the sanitation worker. For the person who 
picks up our garbage, in the final analysis, is 
as significant as the physician, for if he 
doesn’t do his job, diseases are rampant. All 
labor has dignity. 
It is Black and Brown workers who 
have too often, far too long, far too 
often been robbed of their dignity on 
the job. If we want to be a country 
where all people have dignity, we need 
to start by recognizing that all labor 
has dignity. But so far, our response to 
the crisis is not the response of a gov-
ernment that believes that. This Sen-
ate, this President, can always find 
trillions of dollars for corporations— 
for tax cuts, for bailouts. But when 
hard-working families need help with 
rent or to put food on the table, Presi-
dent Trump and Leader MCCONNELL 
say we can’t afford it. 
The President and the administra-
tion have already made racial and eco-
nomic inequality worse and undone

civil rights protections. They have 
been pretty clear that they are willing 
to put American workers’ lives at 
risk—to reopen stockyards or just to 
juice the stock market. 
President Trump and his administra-
tion believe that millions of Americans 
are expendable. It is not a coincidence 
that many of the people they consider 
expendable are Black and Brown work-
ers. 
Since the President is unwilling to 
protect people—whether that is pro-
tecting their lives or protecting their 
financial future—we in the Senate 
must fill the leadership void. As we do 
that, we work for change. We need to 
be clear that part of leading is listen-
ing. 
The best ideas don’t come out of 
Washington—the solutions we need to 
fix the justice system, to address 
wealth inequality, to reverse dispari-
ties in healthcare, to help communities 
that have been hurt by redlining and 
Jim Crow laws and so much more. 
Whenever we talk about this, when-
ever people bring up the ways the sys-
tem has failed so many Americans on 
the Senate floor or at a protest march, 
there are always naysayers—almost al-
ways White, usually men, often pretty 
well-off—who say: How can you be so 
negative? Why do you want to dwell on 
all the worst parts of our history? 
Don’t you love our country? 
My 
response 
to 
our 
country’s 
naysayers and sunshine patriots is this: 
How can you be so pessimistic as to be-
lieve that this is the best our country 
can do? Do you really think the Amer-
ican people, with our ingenuity and our 
optimism and tenacity—do you really 
think the American people can’t create 
a fair economy and a more just govern-
ment? Do you truly believe we can’t 
have a society that works for every-
one—Black and White and Brown, 
women and men—no matter who you 
are, no matter what kind of work you 
do? Protesting, working for change, or-
ganizing, demanding our country do 
better—those are some of the most pa-
triotic things any of us can do. 
I love my country. If you love this 
country, you fight for the people who 
make it work, all of them. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Chair would remind Senators that 
under rule XIX, it is provided that ‘‘no 
Senator in debate shall, directly or in-
directly, by any form of words impute 
to another Senator or to other Sen-
ators any conduct or motive unworthy 
or unbecoming a Senator.’’ 
The Senator from Oklahoma is recog-
nized. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I 
want to respond to the accusations 
that were made. And I worded that 
carefully not to violate any rules. I am 
going to do that. 
I see kind of an active desperation 
that is creeping in on statements and 
things that are said about other people. 
And right now, we are experiencing 
some things that actually are a suc-
cess. 
I want to respond to some of the ac-
cusations that were made. First, I have 
something else to do that is kind of an 
awkward thing to be doing at this time 
because I am going to go back to talk 
about something that happened not 
yesterday or this week but back in 
1983. I think it is important that we do 
this. About every 10 years I do this. 
And we are going to be successful now 
because I have a commitment from the 
President that he is going to stay 
hitched on an issue—a huge issue in 
the past. 
In 1983, not much was known about 
Iran’s efforts to train and arm the rad-
ical proxies and to kill Americans and 
to kill our partners and our allies. Peo-
ple know now. In fact, only a few years 
earlier, Ayatollah Khamenei led a vio-
lent revolution in Iran. Khamenei’s re-
gime introduced himself to the world 
by taking American diplomats hostage 
for 444 days—444 days. We all remember 
when that happened. That was some-
thing unprecedented. It was all tied 
into Khamenei. Of course, he used 
other people. Nothing has changed 
since that time. 
Nonetheless, for the next decade, 
until his death in 1989, Khamenei was 
the ruthless face of an Iranian regime 
that applied a brutal version of reli-
gious law, murdered innocent people, 
suppressed religious and ethnic minori-
ties, and supported radical Islamists. 
He hated Western value, and he hated 
the freedoms that we enjoy. Almost 4 
years into his rule as Supreme Leader, 
October 23, 1983, 241 Americans, both 
U.S. marines and other service per-
sonnel serving a peace mission in Bei-
rut, were attacked at their barracks by 
a truck that was carrying 2,000 pounds 
of explosives by terrorists who were 
armed and trained by Iran. That was in 
1983. Two hundred and forty-one died. 
These terrorists later became what 
we know as Hezbollah. That is the first 
time they surfaced and were identified 
as they are today, as an arm of Iran. 
Hezbollah struck. 
In 2003, 20 years after the attack on 
our marines, the United States District 
Court for the District of Columbia 
ruled in a civil suit brought by the 
families of the victims—the 241 who 
were 
killed—that 
Iran 
had 
used 
Hezbollah as a proxy to bomb the Ma-
rine barracks in Beirut on that October 
day. 
Not much has changed with Iran, un-
fortunately. It is the same way they 
operate now. They don’t play by the 
rules. They never have. They are ter-
rorists. They are worse than terrorists. 
They are the ones who are training the 
terrorists. That became even more ap-
parent when we began to learn more 
about their ties to Islamist terror orga-
nizations and how they use proxy orga-
nizations, with no true allegiance but 
on behalf of a twisted interpretation of 
Islamic religious text, to murder and 
then sneak back into the shadows. 
That is the way they operated, and 
that is the way they operate today. 
It 
happened 
under 
Ayatollah 
Khamenei, and it happens under the 
current Supreme Leader as well. Noth-
ing has really changed. A lot of years 
have gone by. A lot of people have died. 
As I speak here on the floor, Iran is 
providing weapons and cover for the 
Houthi rebels, who are committing un-
thinkable atrocities in Yemen. Iran has 
continued to support terrorist groups 
that threaten our personnel in Iraq. It 
has repeatedly attacked our partners 
across the region. What is even worse 
is Iran seeks a nuclear weapon capa-
bility, and President Obama’s Iran deal 
would have, ultimately, let it have ex-
actly what it wanted. 
Fortunately, we now have a Presi-
dent who takes a strong stance against 
Iran with the imposing of sanctions 
and the pulling out of the flawed Iran 
nuclear deal that the previous adminis-
tration put us in. 
By the way, I had a joyful conversa-
tion for a half an hour yesterday with 
Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of 
Israel. He was reminding me that I was 
in Israel and in the Prime Minister’s 
office at the very moment that Presi-
dent Trump pulled out of the Iran deal, 
and I had never seen him so jubilant. 
We just talked about that yesterday. 
Go back now to October 23, 1983, 
when 241 Americans were killed by an 
Iranian-backed suicide bomber. It was 
a terrible day in U.S. history, and, in 
2003, a U.S. court ruled that Iran was 
responsible. That suit against Iran, 
brought by the victims’ families—the 
families of the 241 who died—provided 
punitive and compensatory relief in the 
form of Iranian assets. In 2007, the dis-
trict court judge awarded just over $2.5 
billion to the families of those mur-
dered in that atrocity. 
Our work isn’t done now. You would 
think that it would be, but it is not be-
cause there is nearly $1.7 billion in 
laundered Iranian assets in a Luxem-
bourg bank named Clear Street, and we 
need to make sure that it stays there. 
Yet I have this gnawing feeling that, 
once something is over in Luxembourg 
or someplace like that, all of a sudden, 
you wake up and find that Iran has $1.7 
billion it is not entitled to in order to 
spread terrorism throughout the world. 
In last year’s NDAA—now, the NDAA 
is the largest bill we do each year. I 
chair the defense authorization. It is 
called the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. We pass it every year. We in-
cluded language that made those assets 
available to the victims’ families, and 
the President signed it. I talked to the 
President, and he is anxious to do this. 
We have one obstacle that we have to 
get past, which is some activity by the 
second circuit where it is now being 
played out. 
President Trump has been a firm 
leader against the aggressive Iran, and 
I certainly stand with him. That is why 
this is a clear opportunity to continue 
President Trump’s maximum pressure 
campaign against the current Iranian 
regime so as to ensure these assets do 
not return to Iran, where they would 
surely be used to help the proxy orga-
nization, such as Hezbollah.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2666 
June 3, 2020 
I trust our Department of Justice 
with this, and I am glad we have a 
President who has made this a top pri-
ority—making sure the families of 
those 241 victims who were killed in 
Beirut receive this money as opposed 
to having the money go back. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. President, in responding to a 
couple of things that were said a few 
minutes ago, we all know this is a real-
ly trying time for our Nation. I begin 
with the obvious, which is what hap-
pened to George Floyd was a crime. It 
was a horrible crime, and it has caused 
a groundswell of people joining to-
gether and standing against injustice 
and hate, not just for George Floyd but 
for so many others. 
Protests are meaningful and positive 
events—standing up for dignity and re-
spect for all people. Protesting is a 
cherished part of our democratic soci-
ety that is enshrined in the First 
Amendment. The rights of peaceful 
protest should be supported and cele-
brated, period. We understand that. 
Yet those protests are not the same as 
the dangerous, destructive activity we 
have seen in many of our cities just in 
the last couple of days. Emotions are 
high, and tensions are high, which is 
understandable. We need law and order 
if we are going to move forward, and I 
think every reasonable person agrees 
with that. 
We are trying to have tough con-
versations about inequality, but we are 
facing a lot of misinformation, espe-
cially when it comes to our military. If 
we let this misinformation spread, it 
will just make things worse. All of the 
people out there—I am talking about 
the ‘‘hate Trump’’ people—are using 
this to try to lie to the American peo-
ple. So I would like to correct the 
record, and I hope every American here 
understands and believes these words. 
This is very important. Here is what is 
happening. 
Right now, the National Guard has 
not been federalized for response. Right 
now, Active-Duty troops have not been 
sent into any city, including DC. I was 
here last night. I was visibly looking 
around and making sure that this was 
not the case, and it was not. There 
were no Active-Duty troops in spite of 
things you have heard to the contrary. 
Right now, local and State law en-
forcement are being supported by the 
National Guard but only when they are 
requested by their States. The Depart-
ment of Defense believes that, and by 
and large, they are doing a fine job. I 
agree with that. Our military is pre-
pared to step in if the situation dete-
riorates dramatically and only if our 
President finds he has to step in. To be 
crystal clear, the President hasn’t done 
that yet. 
I ask my fellow Americans to slow 
down and understand what will happen 
if and only if the President does so. It 
doesn’t mean that our streets will im-
mediately be flooded with uniformed 
and armed troops. There is a process 
that has to be followed just as it was in 
1992 with the LA riots, in 1998 after 
Hurricane Hugo, and at every other 
time before that. 
First, this is the process. What has to 
happen is the President must issue a 
proclamation ordering any insurgents 
to disperse within a set period of time. 
Now, that is really important because 
that is the warning shot. He says this 
is going to happen, but only you can 
keep this from happening. The Presi-
dent has to issue the proclamation or-
dering any insurgents to disperse with-
in a set period of time. It will mean 
that our Nation’s military and security 
leaders, including our Commander in 
Chief—the President—will have deter-
mined that the situation will have de-
teriorated in a way that local officials 
will not have managed on their own. In 
virtually every case, local officials 
have agreed with that. 
We are not there now. We are not 
there at all, and I hope we don’t get 
there. This will only be as a last resort. 
If we do, I am confident this decision 
will be made with the advice of the top 
civilian and military officials who have 
all been confirmed with wide bipar-
tisan support and margins. 
GENERAL MARK A. MILLEY 
Mr. President, I would like to say a 
little something about simple military 
relations. This is something I care a lot 
about as chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on Armed Services. In par-
ticular, I want to speak about General 
Milley. 
General Milley is the Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In this job, 
General Milley is the President’s top 
military 
adviser. 
Don’t 
forget 
he 
doesn’t have any command authority 
over the military forces. This is impor-
tant. This is not what you hear people 
talking about when they misrepresent 
the situation. This is very important. 
He is there as the adviser to the Presi-
dent of the United States, and he 
doesn’t have any command authority. 
There has been a lot of criticism about 
his wearing his battle dress uniform— 
his BDU, as they call it—on Monday 
when the President spoke. Here is an-
other area in which I want to set the 
record straight. 
General Milley was getting ready to 
visit with troops around DC—I know 
that. I was talking to him that day— 
who were also in their BDUs. That was 
the dress uniform for their function at 
that time. Then he was called to the 
White House. We all know why he was 
called to the White House. He is the ad-
viser to the President. I think everyone 
can agree that we want that voice at 
the table in situations like this to pro-
vide the best military advice, as is his 
statutory authority and responsibility. 
On Monday, after General Milley 
walked outside with the President, he 
assessed the situation and immediately 
removed himself. Now, this isn’t just 
me talking. I know that he did because 
I was with him shortly before that and 
also after that. So that was a fact. He 
also told me that he intended to honor 
his oath and uphold the delicate bal-
ance between civilians and the mili-
tary. I fully believe him. He has always 
done that in the past and always will 
do that. 
The 
accusations 
against 
General 
Milley are especially troubling to me 
because I know, from working with 
him, of his commitment to our Nation, 
to the Constitution, and to the Amer-
ican people—of keeping them safe and 
giving his best military advice. It is 
striking below the belt to make these 
accusations and to try to scare the 
American people. It is my duty as 
chairman of the Committee on Armed 
Services to have strong oversight over 
this issue. We have oversight over it. If 
what they are saying is true, we still 
have the oversight. 
I assure you, right now, we are 
watching what our military is doing 
and what it has always done, which is 
its duty within the law and constitu-
tional limits, and that is exactly what 
General Milley has done and is doing 
right now. We are seeing a lot of finger- 
pointing and blame going around. We 
owe it to ourselves and our neighbors 
to believe the very best in each other, 
not assume the worse. We need to rec-
ognize everyone’s inherent value and 
dignity and treat each other with re-
spect and dignity as Christ calls us to 
do. Only then can we listen with both 
of our ears and with our hearts. That is 
what I am asking the American people 
to do. 
Many of those in the protests are in 
a group that has been referred to as 
antifa. Certainly, George Floyd’s death 
was a tragedy and went beyond un-
thinkable dimensions, but did any of 
them know who he was? I suggest, no, 
they really didn’t. So I would only say 
this: I think, in answer to the accusa-
tions that were made, that I would 
quote only one or two sentences out of 
a speech that our President made 2 
days ago in the Rose Garden. This is 
very self-explanatory and does explain 
the situation in response to the accusa-
tions that have been made falsely 
about him. 
We cannot allow the righteous cries and 
peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an 
angry mob. The biggest victims of the riot-
ing are peace-loving citizens in our poorest 
communities. And as their President, I will 
fight to keep them safe. I will fight to pro-
tect you. I am your President of law and 
order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
first thank my friend, Senator LEAHY, 
for allowing me to speak, for we are all 
dealing with the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. 
I ask unanimous consent that Sen-
ator LEAHY be recognized as soon as I 
finish my brief remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
want to say just a couple of things to 
Tennesseans and to Americans. 
All are expressing their rage and 
grief over the murder of George Floyd

S2667 
June 3, 2020 
in Minnesota. I will tell you that this 
event of May 25 cannot be written off 
as a simple use of force or as being un-
fortunate or regrettable. We all know 
that, on that day, George Floyd was 
killed by a police officer while other of-
ficers looked on and heard his begging 
for life and his cries for help. The offi-
cers responsible should be prosecuted 
to the fullest extent of the law. 
I offer my prayers and condolences to 
the Floyd family, just as so many 
other Members of this Chamber have 
done, and I support the President’s call 
for the Justice Department to inves-
tigate this death. 
CENSORSHIP 
Mr. President, our country was built 
on the premise of dissent, and we have 
seen the power that peaceful protests 
have in their ability to bring change to 
every level of government. Unfortu-
nately, over the past week, we have 
also seen what happens when criminals 
and 
shadowy 
professionals 
exploit 
these public expressions of frustration 
and pain. 
Every single day, Americans are 
waking up to find that their neighbor-
hoods have been destroyed, and they 
watch news reports that are dominated 
by lawlessness. Many activists and 
members of the mainstream media 
have attempted to force us into choos-
ing between solidarity and maintaining 
law and order. This is a false choice. It 
is one that we ought to reject. Instead, 
we should fight for accountability, 
compassion, and understanding. At the 
same time, we must condemn racism, 
hatred, and the violence that has torn 
apart so many neighborhoods this very 
week. 
We should also celebrate and defend 
our right to peaceful disagreement in 
the streets, in the classroom, and on-
line just as well as in this very Cham-
ber. Unfortunately, too often, this 
right is not celebrated. Over the years, 
we have documented Big Tech’s history 
of censorship, particularly the censor-
ship of dissenting conservative voices. 
During the 2018 election cycle, a series 
of pro-life ads that I sponsored on so-
cial media were taken down for having 
content the platform labeled as ‘‘in-
flammatory.’’ 
For years, conservatives have been 
fighting a losing war against content 
moderation policies that act as a drag-
net for dissenting opinions. Last week, 
Twitter rolled out a new ‘‘fact-check-
ing’’ feature and almost immediately 
botched a fact check on one of Presi-
dent Trump’s tweets. Unfortunately, 
for Twitter, the President was not 
afraid to point out how easy it is for 
private companies to make mistakes 
that turn moderation into speech polic-
ing. We know that social media compa-
nies have subjectively manipulated 
their algorithms to capture conserv-
ative opinions and conservative elected 
officials. They have been doing this for 
too long for it to just be a mere mis-
take. These are not unintended con-
sequences. 
Last week, President Trump signed 
an Executive order to bring some much 
needed attention to the issue, and we 
thank him for that. As head of the Ju-
diciary Committee’s Tech Task Force, 
I look forward to working with the 
White House and the Justice Depart-
ment to preserve free speech online for 
all Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we know 
that America is hurting. It is reeling 
from a deadly pandemic that has taken 
more than 100,000 lives and then from 
witnessing the broad daylight murder— 
murder—of yet another Black man by 
an officer of the law. It seethes with 
rage and sorrow about the racial injus-
tices that still plague our society. 
America is suffering from unprece-
dented political divisions that are rou-
tinely worsened and deepened by a 
President whose every utterance only 
tears us further apart. In my decades 
in the U.S. Senate, I have never seen 
our country so in need of healing. 
I was a prosecutor. So, when I first 
saw the video of George Floyd’s mur-
der—a human being who was pinned 
down by the neck, cried ‘‘I can’t 
breathe,’’ and desperately called out 
for his mother—I was shocked to my 
core. For millions of Americans and for 
me, that shock swiftly turned into 
anger. 
How could a police officer, who has 
sworn an oath to protect and serve, so 
casually take a human being’s life? 
Why did his fellow officers who wit-
nessed the murder that we all wit-
nessed on video stand there and do 
nothing to stop it? How could this hap-
pen in plain sight when multiple on-
lookers begged the officer to relent— 
stop his murderous conduct—as George 
fell unconscious? 
I was left sickened and shaken. 
I do not know and did not know 
George Floyd, but imagine if he were 
your neighbor or your friend. Imagine 
if George Floyd were your brother, 
your son, your husband, or your grand-
child. Imagine if George Floyd simply 
looked like your loved one and shared 
the same skin color. Imagine the con-
cern you would have for such a person 
who lived in constant fear of those who 
are responsible to protect us all. So it 
is no surprise that protests swept our 
Nation in the wake of this murder. 
Communities of color and all those who 
sympathize with them are fed up. They 
are sick and tired of the fact that Afri-
can Americans are nearly 21⁄2 times as 
likely as White Americans to be killed 
by police officers. No one of good con-
science can sit idly by while African- 
American lives are treated with less 
worth. Our country long ago promised 
equal rights and equal justice. 
Now protesters are aching for real ac-
countability for officers of the law who 
engage in lawless violence. It is not 
simply justice for George Floyd; it is 
justice for Eric Garner, Michael Brown, 
Tamir Rice. The list goes on and on, 
which is why the protests go on and on. 
Too often, people feel the police offi-
cers who take Black lives are treated 
like they are above the law. They feel 
the justice system has been fueled by a 
culture of impunity that shields the 
same officers who abuse the public’s 
trust. Too often the accountability 
comes after incontrovertible evidence, 
such as a damning video, happens to 
surface and the public demands justice. 
I can say, as one who served proudly 
in law enforcement and has served 
proudly in the Senate, ultimately ac-
countability will require dismantling 
this culture of impunity, as well as en-
suring that law enforcement agencies 
have training and policies in place to 
serve to rebuild trust in communities 
of color. 
The protesters demand more from 
our justice system. They demand more 
from a nation that promises that no-
body is above the law. Well, I stand 
with them, and Congress has to, too. 
None of us condone, and indeed I have 
strongly condemned, the looting and 
violence that has sadly taken place 
alongside the peaceful protests and the 
extremists and opportunists who have 
co-opted the peaceful process. They are 
not serving justice. They are not going 
to bring the change our country so 
badly needs. 
My hero, a dear friend who has called 
me his brother, Representative JOHN 
LEWIS, said just a few days ago: 
[L]ooting and burning is not the way. 
Organize. Demonstrate. Sit-in. Stand-up. 
Vote. Be constructive, not destructive. 
I hope everybody will listen to what 
Representative LEWIS said. I hope our 
fellow Americans will heed his wise 
words. I refuse to partake in efforts 
seeking to delegitimize all protesters 
and create even more distrust and divi-
sion. Demonstrators demanding ac-
countability are not thugs, as Presi-
dent Trump has called them. No one 
should threaten state-sanctioned vio-
lence against protesters, as this Presi-
dent and some of his allies have. I 
strongly oppose any efforts to invoke 
the Insurrection Act to unleash our 
military against these domestic dem-
onstrations, as President Trump has 
absurdly threatened. 
Our military is one of our Nation’s 
most sacred institutions. It serves to 
safeguard our constitutional rights 
against enemies abroad. They should 
never be ordered to American streets 
as the battlefield, which would only in-
cite further chaos and deprive Ameri-
cans of their right to peacefully assem-
ble. That is not the America we know 
and love. It is not the America I know 
and love. 
Unfortunately, President Trump has 
proven that he is incapable or perhaps 
he is uninterested in healing and unit-
ing our Nation. At every turn his in-
stinct is to divide and escalate. During 
every crisis he manages to manufac-
ture another of his own making. When 
Americans are in desperate need of a 
consoler in chief, a role that I have 
seen every past President play during 
my years in the Senate—every one of

those Presidents, Republican and Dem-
ocrat alike—President Trump, instead 
of being consoler in chief, shows that 
he knows only how to be instigator in 
chief. He has revealed himself really to 
be a President of his country in name 
only. I never imagined I would say that 
of any American President of either 
party, certainly not of all the prede-
cessors I have had the honor to know. 
So we must instead look to ourselves 
and each other. How do we heal our 
country? At the local, State, and na-
tional levels, we must carry on the 
cause of criminal justice and police re-
form. We must push for systematic law 
enforcement reform. We must elect 
leaders who will prioritize racial jus-
tice and work tirelessly to achieve 
some measure of that. We must work 
to build bridges in communities so that 
we better empathize with the struggles 
faced 
by 
those 
who 
have 
been 
marginalized for decades on end. 
On Monday, Terrence Floyd, George’s 
brother, stood on the spot where his 
brother died. He made an emotional ap-
peal to the hundreds of people watch-
ing and to the Nation. He pled for the 
protests to remain peaceful. He pled for 
those 
who 
believe 
they 
are 
marginalized and disenfranchised not 
to give up hope, that their voice mat-
ters, and he pled for justice. 
His brother died because he needed a 
breath. His family now asks to take a 
breath for justice, a breath for peace, a 
breath for our country, and a breath 
for George. We should honor his mem-
ory by heeding their anguished advice. 
There is so much to do. Congress 
must get to work. During my years in 
the Senate, I have seen America in cri-
sis. But every time, without exception, 
I have seen America emerge a more 
just and stronger nation. The crises 
America 
faces 
today 
feel 
over-
whelming, historic—some would say 
existential. But if we stay true to the 
values that define our Republic—equal-
ity, justice, the rule of law—I am hope-
ful we will make it through as a slight-
ly more perfect union. 
I weep for our country; I pray for our 
country; and I look for better days. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL PACK 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this 
week our majority leader is asking the 
Senate to vote on the nomination of 
Michael Pack to serve as Chief Execu-
tive of the U.S. Agency for Global 
Media. 
Mr. Pack’s nomination should trou-
ble all of us in this Chamber. It raises 
the question of whether the U.S. Sen-
ate is committed to being the check 
and balance on the qualifications of 
those potentially vested with substan-
tial responsibility into positions in our 
executive branch. 
His nomination draws into question 
the challenge we have, the responsi-
bility we have to ensure that only indi-
viduals of talent, experience, and of in-
tegrity serve America in the executive 
branch. Hamilton commented on this 
in the Federalist Papers. He said: 
To what purpose then require the co-oper-
ation of the Senate? I answer, that the ne-
cessity of [the Senate’s] concurrence would 
have a powerful though, in general, silent op-
eration. It would be an excellent check upon 
the spirit of favoritism in the President, and 
tend greatly to prevent the appointment of 
unfit characters. 
Those words should resonate in this 
Chamber now. The individual who will 
come before us, Michael Pack, set up a 
nonprofit called Public Media Lab, or 
PML, apparently for the sole purpose 
to channel contracts to his for-profit 
operation known as Manifold Produc-
tions. Over a period exceeding a dec-
ade, he channeled $4 million from the 
nonprofit to the for-profit. Not a single 
contract went anywhere else—no other 
contracts. 
Utilizing a nonprofit to launder for- 
profit contracts, in the process of 
which providing tax subsidies to your 
customers and advantage over your 
competitors, raises both ethical and 
legal issues. The legal issues, including 
potential criminal conduct, have not 
been resolved. Mr. Pack is, at this mo-
ment, under investigation by the attor-
ney general of the District of Colum-
bia. 
Mr. Pack, in tax filings to the IRS in 
2011 through 2018, did not accurately 
disclose a relationship between his 
nonprofit and his for-profit. When he 
was asked if, in fact, there were com-
mon officers between the two, he an-
swered no when the answer was clearly 
yes. He did not disclose that his for- 
profit benefited from the setup of the 
nonprofit. 
Mr. Pack did admit to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations that he made 
oversights; that is the term he used— 
‘‘oversights.’’ But he has refused to 
correct his tax filings. 
Mr. Pack, when he was renominated 
in 2020, inaccurately stated in the 
records to the committee that his tax 
returns were complete and accurate. 
He has refused to provide critical docu-
ments to the committee and, in that 
sense, to the Senate to examine these 
significant issues. He has refused to 
provide the agreements between PML 
and Manifold, his nonprofit and his for- 
profit, to examine the propriety of the 
relationship. He has said simply that 
those documents are confidential and 
proprietary. 
But we should realize that serving in 
the executive branch is a privilege. We 
asked for information so that we can 
exercise our constitutional responsi-
bility. When an individual confronted 
with substantial ethical and legal 
issues simply says ‘‘I will not provide 
them’’ and if the Senate committee 
says ‘‘That is OK,’’ then we are failing 
in our constitutional responsibility to 
examine the qualifications of the indi-
vidual. This is no light responsibility 
we bear in this Chamber. This is a very 
significant check and balance of the 
U.S. Constitution, which each and 
every one of us swore to uphold when 
we took our oath of office. 
Mr. Pack, when he was president of 
the Claremont Institute, directed sig-
nificant funds to his for-profit com-
pany for fundraising. His company is 
not a fundraising company; his com-
pany is a film company. So we have 
asked him to provide the details and 
documents related to that work to see 
if there was an inappropriate transfer 
of funds from a position of responsi-
bility to the personal profit of Michael 
Pack. But Mr. Pack has refused to pro-
vide details. He has refused to provide 
documents related to that work. 
In addition, he prematurely resigned 
from his role at the Claremont Insti-
tute, and it is shrouded in mystery. We 
do not know if the board found ethical 
issues. We do not know if they found 
criminal conduct because he has not 
responded to our request for documents 
related to his premature resignation. 
Given the gravity of these issues, it 
makes sense, when he was renomi-
nated, that he would reappear before 
the committee to help clear up these 
concerns and these issues. Well, we 
have not had such a hearing. 
To summarize, when an individual 
makes false statements to the IRS and 
refuses to correct them, when they 
make false statements to the com-
mittee, not in the first time before the 
committee but the second time before 
the committee, when they refuse to 
provide relevant documents to provide 
significant issues of ethical conduct or 
potential criminal conduct, when there 
is an active investigation into that po-
tentially criminal conduct, then we 
should simply say to the President: 
Send us a different name. 
This man may be well qualified, but 
he does not wish to provide the infor-
mation necessary for the Senate to do 
its responsibility as a check and bal-
ance on potentially unfit individuals. 
To exercise advice and consent in ac-
cordance with responsibilities charged 
to us, we must insist on upholding the 
standards for records and documents 
and truthfulness to the committee. We 
must insist that outstanding investiga-
tions be completed when they involve 
potentially criminal conduct. We must 
insist that verifiably false statements 
be corrected. These are not high or ex-
ceptional standards; these are funda-
mental, basic, elementary responsibil-
ities that we carry. 
That is why I have written a resolu-
tion declaring that the Senate should 
not vote on a nominee who has made 
verifiably false statements to Congress 
or the executive branch and who re-
fuses to correct those statements. 
Until those statements to both the 
Foreign Relations Committee and to 
the IRS are corrected, Michael Pack’s 
nomination should be set aside. We 
should simply tell the President and 
exercise our responsibility, for which 
we have taken an oath of office, to send 
us someone else. This individual is not 
prepared to provide the information 
necessary for the Senate to proceed 
with his nomination. That is what we 
should be saying, and we should still be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2669 
June 3, 2020 
saying it at this late date. I urge my 
colleagues to do the right thing by sup-
porting this resolution. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 604 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. Res. 604, which was 
submitted earlier today. I further ask 
that the resolution be agreed to, the 
preamble be agreed to, and the motions 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). Is there objection? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, what you are seeing 
here today is a pure, unadulterated ex-
ercise in politics—politics that are 
steeped with the difference of political 
philosophy between the two parties. 
With relation to the complaint that 
my colleague has just made that this 
nomination hasn’t been adequately 
vetted, this nomination was made 2 
years ago tomorrow, June 4, 2018. 
Mr. Pack came before the committee. 
He has been before the committee 
twice. He has produced numerous docu-
ments due to the complaints of the 
Democrats on the committee. He has 
been looked at by the White House. His 
business dealings have been looked at 
by the Justice Department, by the In-
ternal Revenue Service, and he has 
been cleared of anything. 
The U.S. Agency for Global Media is 
an important agency because it is 
charged with supporting international 
broadcasting outlets around the world 
in the face of the kinds of misinforma-
tion and things that are put out by 
other countries that are untrue. 
The real reason for the objection to 
Mr. Pack’s nomination is that this 
man is a patriot. This is a man who 
makes documentary films that portray 
the greatness of America. 
Anyone who disagrees with that 
ought to spend the time to look at the 
documentary he just made, which was 
run on public TV within the last 30 
days, regarding Clarence Thomas and 
what he had to go through to get on 
the Supreme Court. It was a superb 
representation of what happened in 
that. If you watch that, you will see 
why the Democrats are absolutely op-
posed to Mr. Pack. 
But don’t take our word for this. 
RealClearPolitics, 
after 
this 
whole 
thing started, did its own investigation 
into this, and they noted that the busi-
ness arrangements of Mr. Pack used to 
make these documentaries are very 
common for documentary filmmakers 
and, like Pack, filmmakers and tele-
vision producers also use nonprofits to 
collect contributions from donors and 
then set up a for-profit company to 
make these films. This is exactly what 
Senator MERKLEY was objecting to. 
Having said that, they went on to 
interview others, including attorneys 
and everything else. Another producer 
with no business ties to Pack told 
RealClearPolitics ‘‘that he set up the 
same two-pronged way of funding films 
last year on the advice of counsel, who 
told him it was standard operating pro-
cedure.’’ 
This has been looked at. It has been 
reviewed. Look, the committee has had 
this in its hands for almost 2 years. I 
have been really patient. Every time 
that I set this for a hearing and they 
wanted more time, I let that go. 
Finally, the last time, I was really, 
really disappointed in the Democrats’ 
engagement of the political system, en-
joining it with the potential criminal 
justice system, to try to stop this. 
The night before the business meet-
ing, I got a letter from the attorney 
general for the District of Columbia— 
obviously a partisan individual—that 
says that he is going to look at this 
and, therefore, he is investigating it. 
The Democrats then said: Well, we 
can’t go ahead with this because he is 
being investigated by this partisan per-
son from DC. 
Look, I am on the Ethics Committee. 
There are six of us. Half of us sit on the 
Foreign Relations Committee. In every 
instance I can think of on the Ethics 
Committee where the U.S. Justice De-
partment has asked us to stand down 
because they were doing a legitimate 
criminal investigation, we have done 
so. 
In this particular case, it was a par-
tisan agency of the District of Colum-
bia that noticed that they were going 
to do this investigation. 
I started my career as a prosecutor. I 
have always felt that the justice sys-
tem and the prosecuting system should 
be above politics, but to get a partisan 
individual to send a letter—after 2 
years—on the eve of the business meet-
ing, that he was going to open a busi-
ness meeting again, after many delays, 
was just too much. 
But I did delay the business meeting 
for 1 week, and after that 1 week we 
had a business meeting. The Democrats 
made motion after motion to delay. 
Again, I was as patient as I could be. 
I said during these motions that we 
were only going to go on so long with 
this. Finally, as was noted by some of 
the attorneys in the room, had this oc-
currence happened in a court of law, 
the attorneys would have been held in 
contempt of court for making repet-
itive motions that were obviously 
delay motions and done spuriously. 
So, after the eighth motion, I de-
clared the motions out of order, and we 
went to what democracies do. We went 
to a vote. To no one’s surprise, it was 
a straight party-line vote: 12 votes to 
send Mr. Pack’s confirmation to the 
floor for confirmation and 10 votes 
against that. 
This is a democracy. The way we do 
this is we have disagreements, particu-
larly when it comes to political mat-
ters such as this, but to try to engage 
the justice system in this I find just 
really, really disheartening. 
We are going to have a vote on Mr. 
Pack, and it is very simple. If you 
don’t want Mr. Pack to take this job, 
then you vote no, and if you do, then 
you say yes. But this has been inves-
tigated back and forth. Regardless of 
the breast-beating and the rending of 
garments over what an awful person he 
is and how awful his businesses have 
been, keep in mind, this is all politics. 
If you see the kind of work that he has 
done, he makes America proud when he 
makes a documentary. 
So I would object to the resolution 
that has been proposed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
to speak for up to 5 minutes before the 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
want to, first of all, thank Senator 
MERKLEY for his leadership on the reso-
lution and for his thoughtful and sub-
stantive contributions as a member of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee and to express our deep dis-
appointment that our Republican col-
leagues are blocking his resolution, 
which basically says that we should 
not move forward on a nominee—in 
this case, this nominee—when there 
are false statements to the IRS and to 
the Foreign Relations Committee for 
which he refuses to correct the record, 
which would have consequences. Those 
are indisputable. 
It is abundantly clear that we need 
to formalize some standards that apply 
equally to all nominees, Democrat and 
Republican alike, and we should think 
of it as a floor beneath which the Sen-
ate should not fall. 
Now, it is amazing to me that I know 
my Republican colleagues used to care 
about tax issues. As a matter of fact, 
they denied a previous distinguished 
majority leader of the Senate—on some 
arcane issue—the opportunity to be-
come the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. They have done it a 
bunch of times. 
This issue is a $4 million tax issue in 
which Mr. Pack took his nonprofit, to-
tally controlled by him—totally con-
trolled by him—and had all the moneys 
that were solicited to the nonprofit 
then sent to his for-profit company, to-
tally controlled by him—totally con-
trolled by him. And no other disburse-
ments were made from the nonprofit 
for anyone else, for any other entity. 
I didn’t hear until now that the Jus-
tice Department and the IRS has re-
viewed this. It should be forthcoming, 
then, that they have cleared this, that 
this is now in the course of business. 
We can create a nonprofit; go ahead 
and get moneys from people; they will 
get their deductions; and then we can 
send it to ourselves for profit. That is 
one heck of a process. 
Now, the chairman continues to say 
‘‘2 years.’’ Well, 2 years ago there was 
a Republican chairman of the com-
mittee—our colleague Bob Corker. He

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2670 
June 3, 2020 
did not move this nomination 2 years 
ago. So with this constant refrain of 2 
years, I guess you want to blame 
former Senator Corker for not moving 
it during that period of time. 
At the chairman’s request, I met 
with Mr. Pack. While he may not have 
been my nominee, I agreed to have a 
hearing, which is one of the standards 
we have in the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. There is an agree-
ment between the chair and ranking. 
That has been violated for Mr. Pack. 
He actually went to a vote before the 
committee without my agreement, so 
that comity has been violated for the 
future. 
At the end of the day, we have some-
one who will not ultimately—he says: 
Yes, I made a ‘‘mistake’’—it is a $4 mil-
lion mistake—and, yes, I should have 
answered differently. 
Well, why not correct it? If it is so 
simple, if it is so benign, why not cor-
rect it? The reason you don’t want to 
correct it is that there are con-
sequences that flow from that correc-
tion, including probably an IRS inves-
tigation. 
Finally, it is interesting that, I 
guess, when Attorney General Barr 
does something, it is not political, but 
when the attorney general of the Dis-
trict of Columbia does it, it is political. 
I didn’t know we were going to start 
choosing and picking which law en-
forcement entities are political in this 
country. 
The attorney general of the District 
of Columbia had an investigation that 
was preceding before any action of the 
committee—preceding before any ac-
tion of the committee or any informa-
tion brought to the attention of the at-
torney general. Evidently, he considers 
it significantly serious enough—poten-
tial IRS violations on taxes. 
So here are our Republican col-
leagues who, in the past, railed against 
anyone who had violations of the IRS 
Tax Code, saying they are not worthy 
of being a nominee, to going ahead and 
ramming through someone who ulti-
mately has some serious issues to the 
tune of $4 million, and that is not a 
problem. Under investigation—that is 
not a problem. 
So I urge my colleagues to consider 
what you are doing here. Not only was 
a precedent set at the committee, but 
you will set a precedent on the floor, 
and it will be very hard for you to get 
up and rail about somebody’s tax li-
abilities and what they did and didn’t 
do honestly with the taxes at the end 
of the day. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
CLOTURE MOTION

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 2 weeks 
ago, I came to the floor of the Senate 
to ask for consent on the simple, time-
ly Senate resolution sponsored by near-
ly half of the Members of this Cham-
ber. What did the resolution call for? 
Well, it urged the United States to join 
global coronavirus vaccine and treat-
ment efforts. That doesn’t sound like a 
radical idea, does it? In the midst of a 
global pandemic that is causing so 
much suffering and so many deaths, it 
would seem that asking the United 
States to join other countries of the 
world in searching for therapies and 
vaccines is just common sense. 
We don’t know where or when a vac-
cine will be discovered. We don’t know 
if an effective treatment will be discov-
ered in the United States or in some 
other place. Certainly, with the re-
spected medical and scientific leader-
ship in the United States, you would 
hope that it would be here, but let’s be 
honest. If a safe and effective vaccine 
against the coronavirus is discovered 
in some other country, the United 
States would want to be there and be 
part of the discussion about its produc-
tion and distribution. Wouldn’t we? 
That is all this resolution says. 
Why not team up with allies around 
the world since we are all looking for 
the same thing—a safe and effective 
vaccine. 
Whether 
that 
vaccine 
is 
stamped ‘‘Made in the USA’’ or is made 
in some other country is secondary. Is 
it safe? Is it effective? Will it save 
lives? Do we really want the American 
people to be left out of such an effort? 
It was a global effort to eliminate 
smallpox, Ebola, polio, and so many 
other deadly diseases we took for 
granted. We were all in it together. 
These viruses and diseases don’t 
know any boundaries. People around 
the world have the same fears and con-
cerns that we have in the United 
States about what we are paying in 
price of suffering and death until we 
find a way to avoid it. This resolution 
would just call on the United States to 
be part of a global effort to find a ther-
apy and a vaccine, but this resolution 
was blocked here in the Senate. Since 
then, since the 2 weeks that have 
passed, we have lost over 100,000 Amer-
ican lives. Sadly, the number still 
grows. This has been 100,000 lives in 
just a few months—the same number of 
American casualties in the wars of 
Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan 
combined. 
What was President Trump’s re-
sponse? Was there empathy or a mes-
sage of national unity or healing dur-
ing this tragic moment? No. Once 
again, President Trump refused to take 
any responsibility for leadership during 
this crisis. Sadly, he has cast blame in 
every direction and ignored his own re-
sponsibility amid a deadly global pan-
demic that has had devastating con-
sequences for the American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2671 
June 3, 2020 
Sadly, we lead the world in infections 
and death, but President Trump has de-
cided that now is the moment in his-
tory for the United States to pull out 
of the World Health Organization—the 
same body that is heading the global 
pandemic response. What is he think-
ing—that we would walk away from 
the organization that has called to the 
table countries from around the world 
in an effort to find a safe and effective 
vaccine? Here we are, on the 40th anni-
versary of the World Health Organiza-
tion’s historic achievement in eradi-
cating small pox, stumbling along with 
a President who is more interested in 
settling a score, casting blame, and 
finding ways to divide us. Once again, 
the majority of his party here in the 
Senate is not chiming in and joining us 
in this effort to pass this resolution. 
While we continue to have some of 
the world’s best researchers and ex-
perts, it is plausible that a vaccine will 
be found and developed elsewhere. In a 
rush to research and validate a vac-
cine, ramp up production, address glob-
al allocation and supply needs, ensure 
affordability and access worldwide, and 
make sure the United States gets its 
fair share of any safe and effective vac-
cine, where will we stand if the Presi-
dent insists on being on the sidelines, 
unengaged? When the United States 
pursues this Trump go-it-alone ap-
proach while the rest of the world is 
working together, where does that 
leave us? Pride cometh before the fall. 
Just as with the smallpox effort, a 
global, collaborative approach makes 
obvious sense, and it will save Amer-
ican lives. Joining forces with other 
countries around the world will help to 
speed the development and eventual 
distribution of the coronavirus vaccine 
we desperately seek. 
Do you want to know what one Re-
publican Senator from Tennessee said 
about this? He said: ‘‘I disagree with 
the President’s decision.’’ 
Withdrawing U.S. membership from 
the WHO could, among other things, 
interfere with clinical trials that are 
essential to the development of a vac-
cine. No one knows where this vaccine 
will eventually be perfected or pro-
duced. God willing, it will be soon. Yet 
why shouldn’t we be joining in this 
global effort? Why? Why, at this mo-
ment in history, has President Trump 
said we are stepping away from the or-
ganization that leads this effort? 
Given this President’s—sadly, I hate 
to use the word—‘‘obsession’’ with 
blaming everyone but himself for mis-
handling this situation, maybe his 
dereliction of duty should come as no 
surprise, but what a bitter, bitter dis-
appointment it is. 
I return to the floor to ask unani-
mous consent on a straightforward res-
olution—a 
simple 
resolution 
that 
should have passed without any fanfare 
by a voice vote unanimously in the 
Senate. This resolution calls on the 
United States to join in the global ef-
fort to find a safe and effective vac-
cine—something that we have done 
consistently throughout our history 
until this President took office. 
Ultimately, let’s remember that this 
is a pandemic that affects the world, 
and any solution has to be a worldwide 
solution as well. We cannot isolate our-
selves from the international ways of 
finding treatments and the develop-
ment of a vaccine. Doing so not only 
wastes time but risks there being a loss 
of life. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 579 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Foreign Relations be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. Res. 579, a resolution encouraging 
the international community to re-
main committed to collaboration and 
coordination to mitigate and prevent 
the further spread of COVID–19 and 
urging renewed United States leader-
ship and participation in any global ef-
forts on therapeutics and vaccine de-
velopment and delivery to address 
COVID–19 and prevent further deaths; 
that the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object. 
First of all, let me commend my good 
friend from Illinois for bringing this. I 
know he is frustrated, as all of us are, 
with what has happened with this pan-
demic that came out of China and 
swept the world and caused all the 
grief that it has for America and for 
every other country on the planet. 
It is important to note, I think, as we 
start, that the United States has been 
the single most generous donor of glob-
al health assistance around the world. 
We do hear people, from time to time, 
criticize the foreign assistance that 
America gives out. Probably the pan-
demic that we have just gone through, 
with this COVID–19 from China, is the 
best indication that there is for why 
certain foreign assistance is so crucial. 
This foreign assistance we give in the 
healthcare area is given, amongst 
other reasons, to keep those things 
from spreading to the United States. 
Last year alone, we, the United 
States of America, we American tax-
payers, provided over $9 billion in glob-
al health assistance through the State 
Department and USAID. That $9 billion 
does not account for the amount that 
the CDC spent in global health efforts. 
So it is well over $9 billion that we 
Americans have put out there. 
We strengthen health systems; we 
train health workers; we build supply 
chains; we connect health networks; we 
support cutting-edge research and in-
novation; and, yes, develop and expand 
access to therapeutics and vaccines, 
which is what my good friend from Illi-
nois is addressing here when it comes 
to vaccines. I am going to talk about 
that in a minute. 
We led the international efforts to 
combat AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, 
polio, Ebola, and other viruses that 
came out of China. We are the single 
largest donor to the Global Fund and 
U.N. agencies, including UNICEF. 
I hope that there isn’t a suggestion 
that we are withdrawing from collabo-
rative efforts to develop a COVID–19 
vaccine because we did not directly 
participate in the EU pledging con-
ference. In reality, leading partners in 
that effort include the Global Fund and 
Gavi, where we are the major donors, 
so we will be participating in the col-
laborative effort to develop vaccines 
for COVID–19. 
I think it is also important to note 
that the President has made a his-
toric—a historic 3-year pledge and is 
strongly supporting Gavi’s COVID–19 
efforts. Gavi stands for the global alli-
ance for vaccines. It was essentially 
the brainchild of Bill Gates. He and 
Melinda, of course, in my judgment, 
are on an equal level with Mother Te-
resa for what they have done with glob-
al health. We are participating with 
Gavi and, like I said, the President has 
made a historic 3-year pledge to that. 
I appreciate the feelings the good 
Senator from Illinois has about the 
President of the United States, and he 
did indeed put the brakes on WHO be-
cause he felt there were shortcomings 
with WHO when it came to WHO’s work 
with China and their failure really to 
get after China at the very beginning 
of this to do what it really should have 
done. 
I am going to object to this resolu-
tion not because the effort by the good 
Senator from Illinois isn’t well-taken. 
It is well-taken. We had a similar one 
2 weeks ago and they came out here 
and objected to it and the Senator is 
frustrated because he feels we should 
be doing more. 
First of all, during the 2 weeks—we 
obviously were gone for 1 week—but let 
me tell you what was going on during 
that week and the subsequent week. I 
promised, at that time, that the For-
eign Relations Committee was going to 
take this issue on because it is of such 
importance that we don’t go through 
this again, and there is a lot more that 
we can do than simply pass a resolu-
tion. 
It is my ambition to create a very 
significant piece of legislation that 
will be bipartisan, that creates a vehi-
cle to address a fast-moving virus like 
this. We can all argue about the WHO 
and what they did or didn’t do, their 
connections to China and that sort of 
thing, but that is not going to help us 
as we go forward. What we do know is 
that WHO has done good work in the 
past. They were a really good partner 
with us, as the Senator knows, when it 
came to implementing PEPFAR and 
doing great things in the battle against 
AIDS. They were very helpful with 
Ebola and very helpful with smallpox, 
but this was a different virus. This was

a house on fire. WHO is simply not, at 
this time, geared to be a fireman. When 
the fire bell rings, we need a vehicle to 
address a virus. 
This is going to happen again because 
in the Wuhan district, there is a vast 
bat population, and they are carrying 
about 2,000 different species of virus. 
Unfortunately, and frighteningly, we 
don’t know what all those viruses can 
do. Heaven help us if we get one out of 
there that is worse than COVID–19 that 
we have had, but we need a fire depart-
ment that can address this. 
I hope we are going to be able to en-
gage China. If not, we are going to have 
to find ways of dealing with this. 
Where is that vehicle going to be car-
ried? Is it going to be a new part of 
WHO? Is it going to be part of the CDC? 
Is it going to be a new international or-
ganization? I can’t answer that, but I 
can tell you this. On a bipartisan basis, 
Senator MURPHY, who is also on the 
Foreign Relations Committee, and I 
have introduced a bill to address a 
number of these things, including the 
vaccine question and including work-
ing on getting a vehicle to do what I 
have described. 
I think everyone is working on this 
in good faith. The bill that will be in-
troduced is written on paper. It is not 
written on stone. We are wide open to 
suggestions as to what kind of a vehi-
cle it is that will address this like fire-
men and not in a slower fashion like 
other health challenges have presented. 
Senator MURPHY and I have had a 
number of discussions on this. We are 
both committed to reach the goals that 
I know Senator DURBIN
and that I 
think this whole body wants to reach. 
We are going to hold a series of hear-
ings as to how to do this, how best to 
do it, how it should be funded, how it 
should be organized, and how the man-
agement should take place. What it is 
not going to focus on is the finger- 
pointing 
for 
what 
happened 
after 
COVID escaped from a bat into a 
human being in Wuhan, China, and 
what happened after it left Wuhan, 
China, and went around the world. We 
have really good information on that 
already. 
There is going to be a lot of other in-
vestigations and hearings and that sort 
of thing. We want to talk about, what 
do we do when this happens in the fu-
ture? How can we create an agency 
that just like the fire department, 
when the bell rings, they pull their 
boots on; they slide down the pole; 
they get on the truck; and they go put 
out the fire. 
I guarantee Senator DURBIN that we 
will continue to work on this. My staff 
tells me—and I am glad to hear that 
Mr. DURBIN’s staff is working with 
them on the language on this par-
ticular resolution, and I thank the Sen-
ator for that and I invite him and com-
mit to him that we will work with him 
as we develop this new legislation and 
as we go through the hearings. 
So, again, please don’t take this as 
combative. It is not. It is intended, in 
the best spirit, to help us all move for-
ward to get to a piece of very signifi-
cant legislation that will hopefully 
take us forward like PEPFAR did and 
as some of the other monumental 
pieces of legislation did that can ad-
dress this incredibly difficult situation 
and hurtful situation not only for 
America but for the world. 
And I state to the Senator that I in-
vite your participation, encourage your 
participation, and assure you that we 
will work in good faith to try to reach 
these goals. 
With that, I object for the reasons 
stated. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have 
respect for my colleague and thank 
him for his positive statement about 
the work to be done in the Foreign Re-
lations Committee. There is nothing in 
this resolution that preempts or tries 
to impact on anything he mentioned. 
The operative language is a few words, 
‘‘urging renewed United States leader-
ship and participation in any global ef-
forts on therapeutics and vaccine de-
velopment and delivery to address 
COVID–19 and prevent further death.’’ 
How we do that, whether we create 
an agency or not, this is simply an ex-
pression of policy that I hope we can 
embrace. I will be back if we don’t 
move forward with alternatives. Lives 
are at stake, and we should be part of 
the international conversation to avoid 
it. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, would the 
Senator yield for a few moments? 
Mr. DURBIN. Certainly. 
Mr. RISCH. Thank you. I appreciate 
these comments. There is nothing that 
the Senator just stated that I disagree 
with. One point, in passing, and I say 
this in the spirit of trying to get to the 
objective that I laid out, and that is, it 
is my intent to engage the second 
branch of government, not only the 
agencies that are responsible for this— 
Health and Human Services, Homeland 
Security, 
the 
State 
Department, 
USAID—but also the White House. The 
President has to have a role here. He 
has obviously undertaken the role. I 
have already spoken to him about this. 
I intend to have other lengthy con-
versations about this. I am engaging 
the President to assist us. This is not a 
partisan issue. 
As Mr. DURBIN has pointed out, and 
rightfully so, this virus doesn’t care 
whether you are a Republican or Demo-
crat; it doesn’t care whether you are an 
American or not an American. It 
doesn’t care if you are a President of 
the United States or, in the case of 
some countries around the world, a 
member of the highest authority there 
is in that country. The virus just 
doesn’t care. 
In order for us to accomplish this, it 
is going to be a bill—it is not going to 
be a resolution—and it has to be ap-
proved by the second branch of govern-
ment. They fully understand what we 
are trying to do here. They have com-
mitted their resources and their input 
to this, and I am convinced they are 
working in good faith, just as everyone 
here is, to try to reach these goals of 
doing something better in the future 
than what we have experienced just re-
cently. 
Senator, again, thank you for your 
attention to this. Thank you for your 
input, and I commend to you that we 
will work together on this as we go for-
ward. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Monday, 
President Trump stood in the Rose 
Garden and called for the use of mili-
tary force against individuals who have 
been gathering across the country pro-
testing racism and police brutality 
against Black Americans. This historic 
call for empowering the Commander in 
Chief to militarize law enforcement in 
our Nation pushes this President’s 
reach for new Executive authority to 
the most extreme level. 
This follows the President’s tweets 
since last week, threatening to turn 
‘‘vicious 
dogs’’—his 
words—on 
pro-
testers outside the White House and 
quoting the racist phrase from the 1967 
Miami police chief, stating: ‘‘When the 
looting starts, the shooting starts,’’ 
bringing to mind, sadly, for many, 
shameful moments in our Nation’s 
struggle for civil rights. 
President Trump said nothing to ad-
dress the anguish felt by many in this 
country, particularly people of color, 
and instead called on Governors to 
‘‘dominate the streets,’’ as though the 
Americans, who peacefully exercise 
their right to protest, are an enemy 
force. 
Initially, Defense Secretary Esper 
went even further when he referred to 
cities as a ‘‘battlespace.’’ I am heart-
ened by the fact that he has made it 
clear that he does not support the 
President’s suggestion of militarizing 
the police forces and police across 
America. These calls by the President 
to militarize cities across America ig-
nore that for far too long he urged law 
enforcement to ‘‘dominate,’’ as the 
President often says, rather than to 
protect and serve, which is exactly 
what is contributing to the challenge 
we face today. 
The other night, minutes before 
Mayor Bowser’s 7 p.m. curfew came 
into effect, the President used law en-
forcement personnel to use tear gas 
and rubber bullets on peaceful dem-
onstrators in LaFayette Square across 
the street from the White House. They 
even beat these peaceful demonstrators 
with batons and shields. There are con-
flicting reports as to whether the Na-
tional Guard participated in the vio-
lence. I have made a direct inquiry to 
the Department of Defense, and they 
have denied it. 
According to press reports, the as-
sault began with law enforcement 
kneeling, not to express any solidarity

with any racism efforts as we have seen 
some police officers do across the coun-
try; instead, they were kneeling to put 
on gas masks to protect themselves 
from the weapons they were readying 
to fire. 
As soon as this gathering was dis-
persed, the President marched across 
LaFayette Square to St. John’s Epis-
copal Church. The Attorney General, 
the Secretary of Defense, and the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
all followed—only the battle that they 
were witnessing was against Americans 
using their voices to stop racism who 
got in the way of a Presidential photo 
opportunity. 
I simply cannot understand what the 
President and each of these senior offi-
cials were thinking, if they were con-
sciously deciding to be part of this by 
taking a stroll in the aftermath of the 
violence 
in 
Lafayette 
Square 
and 
whether they approved of that treat-
ment of their fellow Americans. 
The Rt. Rev. Mariann Budde, the 
Episcopal bishop of Washington, DC, 
said she was not even given a courtesy 
call by the White House ahead of the 
President’s action. In fact, the bishop 
was outraged by the use of physical 
force and tear gas in the shadow of her 
church to remove peaceful protesters 
so that the church and the Bible could 
be used for some photo opportunity. 
President Trump has ‘‘not acknowl-
edged the agony of our country right 
now,’’ she said in an interview. ‘‘Every-
thing he has said and done is to in-
flame violence.’’ 
President Trump’s actions violate 
the sanctity of our First Amendment 
freedoms and represent an abuse of his 
authority. We know this President well 
after more than 3 years. As shocking as 
Monday night’s events were, they rep-
resent through and through who this 
President really is. It is wrong. 
The American people will have the 
last word in November, but I am en-
couraged to see that in my home State 
of Illinois officials have rejected the 
use of military force and are com-
mitted to American’s right to protest. 
Governor Pritzker said the President’s 
call to send troops to Illinois is ‘‘ille-
gal’’ and ‘‘ridiculous.’’ Chicago Mayor 
Lightfoot has called to ‘‘turn our pain 
into purpose’’ and to ‘‘learn from this 
moment and move forward together.’’ 
In my hometown of Springfield, IL, 
on Tuesday, three high school stu-
dents, young African-American women, 
sponsored a Black Lives Matter rally, 
and 1,000 people in Springfield, IL, 
gathered peacefully to demonstrate 
against racism in law enforcement. No 
windows were broken. No one was ar-
rested. They exercised their constitu-
tional rights, and I am damn proud of 
them. They speak for me and for Amer-
ica; that we still have the right to 
stand up and express ourselves, and 
they did so effectively. 
Right now those around the Presi-
dent should look themselves in the 
mirror and ask whose agenda they are 
serving and whether it is the right 
agenda for America. The collective 
leadership of our military, civilian and 
uniformed alike, needs to decide what 
kind of leaders they want to be for the 
men and women in uniform they com-
mand and what legacy they want to be 
associated with. Monday night was not 
the legacy this country deserves. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Washington Post article 
and the statements of the Episcopal 
bishop of Washington be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post] 
EPISCOPAL BISHOP ON PRESIDENT TRUMP: ‘EV-
ERYTHING HE HAS SAID AND DONE IS TO IN-
FLAME VIOLENCE’ 
(By Michelle Boorstein and Sarah Pulliam 
Bailey) 
The Right Rev. Mariann Budde, the Epis-
copal bishop of Washington, was seething. 
President Trump had just visited St. 
John’s Episcopal Church, which sits across 
from the White House. It was a day after a 
fire was set in the basement of the historic 
building amid protests over the death of 
George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis 
police. 
Before heading to the church, where presi-
dents have worshiped since the days of 
James Madison, Trump gave a speech at the 
White House emphasizing the importance of 
law and order. Federal officers then used 
force to clear a large crowd of peaceful dem-
onstrators from the street between the 
White House and the church, apparently so 
Trump could make the visit. 
‘‘I am outraged,’’ Budde said in a telephone 
interview a short time later, pausing be-
tween words to emphasize her anger as her 
voice slightly trembled. 
She said she had not been given any notice 
that Trump would be visiting the church and 
did not approve of the manner in which the 
area was secured for his appearance. 
‘‘I am the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese 
of Washington and was not given even a 
courtesy call, that they would be clearing 
[the area] with tear gas so they could use 
one of our churches as a prop,’’ Budde said. 
She excoriated the president for standing 
in front of the church—its windows boarded 
up with plywood—holding up a Bible, which 
Budde said ‘‘declares that God is love.’’ 
‘‘Everything he has said and done is to in-
flame violence,’’ Budde of the president. ‘‘We 
need moral leadership, and he’s done every-
thing to divide us.’’ 
In a written statement, Presiding Bishop 
Michael Curry, head of the Episcopal de-
nomination, accused Trump of using ‘‘a 
church building and the Holy Bible for par-
tisan political purposes.’’ 
‘‘This was done in a time of deep hurt and 
pain in our country, and his action did noth-
ing to help us or to heal us,’’ Curry wrote. 
‘‘The prophet Micah taught that the Lord 
requires us to ‘do justice, love mercy and 
walk humbly with our God,’ ’’ he continued, 
calling on Trump and others in power to be 
moral. ‘‘For the sake of George Floyd, for all 
who have wrongly suffered, and for the sake 
of us all, we need leaders to help us to be 
‘one nation, under God, with liberty and jus-
tice for all.’ ’’ 
Budde and Curry are among the pantheon 
of progressive religious leaders who have 
long been critical of Trump’s political agen-
da. The Episcopal Church’s policies include 
supporting abortion rights, refugee resettle-
ment, an expansion of health care and other 
issues that Trump has opposed or not em-
braced. According to the Pew Research Cen-
ter, 49 percent of Episcopalians are Demo-
crats or lean Democratic, compared with 39 
percent of church members who are Repub-
lican or lean Republican. 
Trump’s longtime religious allies, who are 
far more conservative on both domestic and 
foreign policy, saw his walk to St. John’s 
much differently. ‘‘What kind of church I 
need PERMISSION to attend,’’ tweeted Pas-
tor Mark Burns of South Carolina after 
Budde and others said Trump should have let 
them know he was coming. ‘‘Jesus welcomes 
All.’’ 
Johnnie Moore, a spokesman for several of 
Trump’s 
evangelical 
religious 
advisers, 
tweeted favorably about the incident as well. 
‘‘I will never forget seeing @POTUS 
@realDonaldTrump slowly & in-total-com-
mand walk from the @WhiteHouse across 
Lafayette Square to St. John’s Church 
defying those who aim to derail our national 
healing by spreading fear, hate & anarchy,’’ 
he wrote. ‘‘After just saying, ‘I will keep you 
safe.’ ’’ 
Trump did not enter St. John’s on Monday 
evening. No one associated with the church 
was present for his visit. 
Andrew 
Whitehead, 
a 
sociologist 
at 
Clemson University who studies Christian 
nationalism, said the president’s appearance 
was an attempt to promote the idea of Amer-
ica as a distinctly Christian nation after his 
Rose Garden speech. 
‘‘Going to the church, not going in it, not 
meeting with any clergy, holding up a Bible, 
but not quoting any scripture, after an au-
thoritarian speech, was about using the reli-
gious symbolism for his ends,’’ Whitehead 
said. 
‘‘It was a signal to the people that embrace 
the idea of a Christian nation, that he will 
defend Christianity in the public sphere,’’ 
Whitehead said. ‘‘He said he’ll make America 
safe. That raised the question, for whom? It’s 
largely for white, mostly Protestant Amer-
ica.’’ 
Budde—who spent 18 years in as a rector in 
Minneapolis before being elected bishop of 
the Washington diocese—said the Episcopal 
Church disassociates itself from the mes-
sages offered by the president. 
‘‘We hold the teachings of our sacred texts 
to be so so grounding to our lives and every-
thing we do,’’ she said. ‘‘It is about love of 
neighbor and sacrificial love and justice.’’ 
Following a tradition set by President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Trump attended a 
service at St. John’s before his swearing-in 
ceremony in 2017. He visited the church 
again that year to mark a national day of 
prayer for victims of Hurricane Harvey and 
in 2019 on St. Patrick’s Day. 
Budde said she learned he was headed back 
to the yellow, 19th-century building on Mon-
day by watching the news. 
‘‘No one knew this was happening,’’ she 
said. ‘‘I don’t want President Trump speak-
ing for St. John’s.’’ 
The Rev. Robert W. Fisher, the church rec-
tor, said he felt blindsided by the visit. Usu-
ally, the White House gives the church at 
least 30 minutes’ notice before the president 
comes by. 
‘‘We want St. John’s to be a space for 
grace, as a place where you can breathe,’’ he 
said. ‘‘Being used as a prop, it really takes 
away from what we’re trying to do.’’ 
Earlier in the day, Fisher said, he and 
other clergy were outside the church hand-
ing out water bottles and granola bars to 
protesters, and expressing solidarity with 
their cause. He said he left the area to be 
interviewed on television about the damage 
from the fire the previous night and later 
watched images of the protest being disman-
tled ‘‘with disbelief.’’ 
Fisher, 44, became the rector of St. John’s 
in June 2019 and has not yet hosted a presi-
dential visit. The church usually draws

about 400 people on a typical weekend. But it 
has been closed since mid-March due to the 
broad shutdown restrictions in place to com-
bat the novel coronavirus. 
Damage to the building from Sunday 
night’s fire and vandalism will cost at least 
$20,000, Fisher said. But he said the destruc-
tion should not become the focus of what has 
been happening in the streets outside the 
White House. 
Fisher said that when people have talked 
about the church being burned, he has tried 
to redirect them, saying it was likely one 
person who does not represent the majority 
of people protesting. 
‘‘That has pulled away from the more im-
portant message that we have to address rac-
ism in this country,’’ he said. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise at a 
time of crisis. For several months now, 
our Nation has been dealing with two 
simultaneous crises: a global health 
pandemic that has claimed the lives of 
over 100,000 Americans, over 300,000 
people across the globe, and an eco-
nomic crisis that has cost over 40 mil-
lion Americans their jobs. 
And in the midst of these two crises, 
we are now faced with yet another cri-
sis: a crisis of anger, a crisis of racial 
division, flames that are pulling this 
country apart. 
This crisis was precipitated by the 
wrongful death of George Floyd in Min-
neapolis, MN. At this point, most, if 
not all, of us have seen that horrifying 
video: 
Mr. 
Floyd, 
in 
handcuffs, 
facedown on the pavement, incapaci-
tated, not posing a threat to anyone, 
and a police officer with his knee on 
the neck of Mr. Floyd, pressing down 
hard on the neck of Mr. Floyd and 
keeping that knee there for 8 long min-
utes. 
Mr. Floyd begs the officer, pleads 
with the officer, says he can’t breathe. 
He is in obvious and serious physical 
distress. Other officers are standing 
there, watching a defenseless, hand-
cuffed man, pinned to the ground for 8 
long minutes, with a knee pressing 
down on his neck. 
As we all know, those actions took 
the life of Mr. Floyd, and, rightly, fol-
lowing what happened, the U.S. De-
partment of Justice opened a civil 
rights investigation into the police of-
ficers’ conduct. Also rightly, I believe, 
the local prosecutor opened—began—a 
criminal prosecution, a homicide pros-
ecution, against the officer for his con-
duct. 
Now, anytime you have an officer-in-
volved shooting, it is easy for people to 
let rhetoric get carried away. It is easy 
to jump to conclusions. And too many 
players in the political world, I think, 
quickly move to demonize the police 
officer and assume the officer is wrong 
in every circumstance. That is not how 
responsible leaders, that is not how re-
sponsible Americans should behave. We 
should wait to see what the facts and 
circumstances are. 
But here we have a video, and we can 
see what the facts and circumstances 
are, and there are zero legitimate law 
enforcement justifications for what 
happened to George Floyd—none. We 
witnessed police brutality and abuse of 
power, and that is why the officers are 
being prosecuted. 
Those should be propositions that 
bring all of us together. Watching the 
death of Mr. Floyd, for so many Ameri-
cans, brought forth the long history in 
this country of racial discrimination, a 
history that began with centuries of 
slavery in America, a history that has 
seen Jim Crow laws, that has seen the 
Ku Klux Klan, that has seen overt and 
also implicit discrimination. 
Young African Americans too often 
fear interactions with law enforce-
ment, fear that their rights will not be 
protected. Our Nation’s journey toward 
civil rights has had many troubled 
stops along the way, but I, for one, 
agree with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
that the arc of history bends toward 
justice. I also agree with the vision 
that Dr. King put forth standing on the 
steps of the Lincoln Memorial, to an 
assembled crowd and an assembled pro-
test, that he wanted to live in a nation 
where we would be judged—all of us 
would be judged not by the color of our 
skin but by the content of our char-
acter. 
That is a vision that has animated 
America on our journey toward justice, 
and outrage at what happened to 
George 
Floyd 
prompted 
Americans 
across this country to speak out, to ex-
ercise their First Amendment right to 
speak out for racial justice, to speak 
out against police brutality, to speak 
out against abuse of power. All of that 
is legitimate. All of that is protected 
by the Constitution. 
But then we saw things take an omi-
nous turn, a dangerous turn. What, for 
some, was legitimate First Amendment 
speech, speaking out for justice, be-
came co-opted, became taken over by 
violent criminal radicals. 
Now, let’s be clear because so much 
of the news media does not like clarity 
in this regard. When I say that, I am 
not saying that everybody speaking is 
a violent criminal radical. Indeed, 
there are a great many people speaking 
out whose heart cries for justice, cries 
for the justice that has been the many- 
centuries-long journey of this country. 
But there are radicals who cynically 
took advantage of these protests to 
sow division, to sow fear, to engage in 
murder, to engage in violent assaults, 
to engage in looting, to engage in 
theft, to engage in intimidation, to en-
gage in fear. 
The First Amendment protects your 
right to speak; the First Amendment 
protects your right to peaceably pro-
test; but none of us has a right to vio-
lently assault another person. None of 
us has a right to murder another per-
son. None of us has a right to burn the 
cars of police officers, to shatter the 
shop windows of shops throughout this 
country, to engage in acts of terror, 
threatening the lives of our fellow 
Americans. 
To those radicals who cynically tried 
to co-opt these protests, I will say 
their actions were profoundly racist be-
cause they were making a decision to 
take what should have been a unifying 
moment to say this will not stand in 
our Nation. Our law protects everyone, 
regardless of the color of their skin. 
Every 
American—African 
American, 
Hispanic, White, Asian American—it 
doesn’t matter; our laws protect every-
one. That should have been a unifying 
moment, and the cynical, violent, rad-
ical criminals decided to co-opt these 
protests to turn them into, in far too 
many instances, riots—violent riots, 
terrorizing their fellow citizens. 
George 
Floyd 
was 
a 
native 
Houstonian—my hometown. I love the 
city of Houston. George Floyd was ac-
tive in his church in Houston. Next 
week, Mr. Floyd will be coming back to 
Houston for the last time to be buried 
in Houston. I am proud that last night, 
in the city of Houston, thousands came 
out to protest, and there wasn’t vio-
lence last night; that the people of 
Houston demonstrated that you can 
speak, you can speak for racial justice, 
you can speak out against brutality 
without engaging in violence. 
But there has been too much violence 
across the country and, sadly, too 
many politicians who are complicit in 
violence, who have made the political 
judgment to turn a blind eye to rioters, 
to thugs, to murderers, to those terror-
izing communities. 
The riots must stop. The violence 
must stop. The first responsibility of 
government is to keep people safe. 
Right now, in too many of our cities, 
government is failing in that task. 
Across the country, we see the lives 
which have been taken. To date, 6 U.S. 
States and 13 U.S. cities have declared 
a state of emergency because of the 
riots they are facing. Chicago police 
superintendent David Brown said that 
over the weekend, 132 police officers 
were injured, there were 48 shootings, 
and 699 arrests. 
In Las Vegas on Monday night, riot-
ers shot a police officer who is right 
now on life support. Over the past 3 
days, Las Vegas police officers have ar-
rested 338 rioters. 
In St. Louis, four police officers were 
shot on Monday night. Fortunately, 
their wounds appear not to be life- 
threatening, but a beloved retired po-
lice captain, David Dorn, was shot and 
killed by looters at a pawn shop that 
same night. 
Mr. Dorn joined the St. Louis police 
force in 1969. He was a dedicated law 
enforcement officer for nearly 40 years. 
His wife and the St. Louis community 
are grieving his loss. Mr. Dorn was also 
African American. 
The phrase ‘‘Black lives matter’’ has 
become fraught with politics. It is ab-
solutely true that Black lives matter. 
We should be horrified at what hap-
pened to George Floyd, but we should 
also be horrified at what happened to 
David Dorn. To those with political 
agendas seeking demagogue that tear 
this country apart, somehow David 
Dorn—another Black man, a different

Black man—who doesn’t fit the polit-
ical story they are trying to tell, dis-
appears from their narrative. 
It has become politically controver-
sial to make a statement that every 
life matters. How far have we gone? 
Our country was founded on that prop-
osition. The Declaration of Independ-
ence tells us we hold these truths to be 
self-evident that all men—not some 
men, not just White men or White 
women, but all men—of every race, of 
every creed, of every religion—are cre-
ated equal and are endowed by their 
Creator with certain unalienable rights 
that, among them, are the right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
Now, our country has not always de-
livered on that promise for every 
American, but that is the journey we 
have traveled toward that vision. 
David Dorn’s life matters. For every 
reporter 
fanning 
up 
division 
who 
doesn’t stop to honor David Dorn, 
shame on you. His life mattered, and 
he didn’t need to be murdered by vio-
lent looters exploiting the tensions and 
division. 
In protests Monday night in Buffalo, 
NY, three police officers were run over 
by a car, breaking a leg and shattering 
the pelvis of one of the officers. 
In New York City, almost 2,000 people 
have been arrested since the rioting 
started, and 700 people were arrested 
just on Monday night. At least two 
New York City police officers were hit 
by cars on Monday and nearly 50 New 
York Police Department officers have 
been injured since the protests began. 
In Salt Lake City, 21 police officers 
were injured over the weekend, includ-
ing an officer who was hit in the head 
with a bat. 
On Sunday, during the riot that took 
place outside the White House when 
the historic St. John’s Church was 
burned, when arsonists burned the 
church, 14 Secret Service agents were 
injured. 
In San Francisco over the weekend, 
at least 20 fires were set, 33 people were 
arrested for looting, and 2 police offi-
cers were attacked. 
On 
Friday 
night, 
David 
Patrick 
Underwood, an officer in the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, was shot 
and killed during protests in Oakland, 
CA. 
David Patrick Underwood, like David 
Dorn, was African American. George 
Floyd’s life matters. So does David 
Dorn’s. 
So 
does 
David 
Patrick 
Underwood’s. No elected leader should 
sit idly by while David Patrick Under-
wood or David Dorn or George Floyd is 
murdered. If Black lives matter, then 
all Black lives matter, not just those 
which are politically convenient for 
politicians. 
It has been reported that at least 25 
cities in the United States have seen 
deadly, destructive riots in the last 
week. According to the Claims Journal, 
which reports and analyzes the prop-
erty claims industry, 75 businesses in 
Madison, WI, have been looted; 50 busi-
nesses in Seattle; 50 businesses in 
Pittsburgh; and 45 properties in Chi-
cago have suffered damages. In New 
York City, iconic stores up and down 
Broadway and Fifth Avenue have been 
vandalized and looted. 
In Atlanta, everything from big-box 
stores to small businesses have been 
destroyed, looted, and damaged. In At-
lanta, a Black-owned small business, a 
clothing store, was completely looted 
in the wee hours of a Saturday morn-
ing. To store owner Kris Shelby, the 
loss was devastating. 
Mr. Shelby told the New York Times 
that ‘‘as a black man, and this is a 
black-owned business, it’s just sad.’’ 
Looting and destroying Mr. Shelby’s 
business does not further the cause of 
racial justice. It is the act of a cynical, 
violent thief and a thief willing to be a 
bigoted racist on top of it. 
In Philadelphia over the weekend, 
nearly 250 businesses were burglarized, 
over 375 fires set ablaze. Pause and 
think about that number. One city, 
Philadelphia, the city of brotherly 
love—370 fires. 
This is wrong. This is shocking. This 
is horrifying. You are not exercising 
your First Amendment rights when 
you are lighting a police car on fire. 
You are not exercising any constitu-
tional rights when you are burning and 
terrorizing and assaulting your fellow 
citizens. Eighteen law enforcement of-
ficers were injured in Philadelphia— 
some hit by Molotov cocktails, others 
by rocks and bricks. Ross Martinson, 
the owner of a small business called 
the Philadelphia Runner, told the 
Philadelphia Enquirer: ‘‘What is left is 
mush’’ after rioters attempted to light 
three fires in his store, stole clothes, 
stole shoes, smashed the windows, and 
left the store flooding from the sprin-
klers. 
In Los Angeles, the rioting and 
looting 
has 
brought 
back 
painful 
memories of the 1992 Rodney King riots 
that resulted in 50 deaths, thousands of 
arrests, and the destruction of over 
1,000 businesses and buildings. 
One Santa Monica furniture store, 
the owner named Roman, told the L.A. 
Times that over the weekend, ‘‘we lost 
everything in 10 minutes.’’ Roman said 
that 10 minutes of looting resulted in 
$6 million in damages. 
Mind you, all of this is happening 
after months of small businesses being 
on the verge of bankruptcy from the 
coronavirus pandemic and the eco-
nomic catastrophe we are facing. 
Now we have local politicians saying: 
We are not going to let police officers 
protect your store. We are not going to 
let police officers protect your liveli-
hood. Everything you own can be taken 
and destroyed by violent criminals. 
In New York, according to ABC7 New 
York, businesses, such as delis, phar-
macies, beauty supply stores, were de-
stroyed and multiple fires set in Ford-
ham in the Bronx on Monday, while the 
flagship Macy’s store and scores of 
other retail stories were burglarized, 
looted, damaged, in downtown Manhat-
tan over the weekend and Monday. And 
throughout it all, New York police de-
partment officers are calling for the 
politicians to take the handcuffs off 
them, to let them actually protect 
their city and protect their fellow citi-
zens. But too many politicians have a 
different agenda. 
If you are not willing to say that 
what happened to George Floyd was 
wrong, it was unacceptable, it was 
criminal, then you should get the hell 
out of public office. But if you are also 
not willing to say that what has hap-
pened to these store owners, what has 
happened to these police officers—the 
stores that have been looted, the offi-
cers who have been murdered and as-
saulted—if you are not willing to say 
that is wrong, it is criminal, it is unac-
ceptable, and it must stop, then you 
need to get the hell out of public office. 
This ain’t complicated. Protect peo-
ple’s lives. Protect their rights. 
In Minneapolis, where George Floyd 
was killed, Tiwana Jackson, an Afri-
can-American small business owner 
with an eyelash extension studio, told 
a Business of Fashion reporter that her 
store had been looted and vandalized 
during the riots. Tiwana said: ‘‘Burn-
ing stores down, stealing things—how 
is that going to get justice for George 
Floyd?’’ 
She continued: ‘‘It almost took my 
focus away on why this whole thing 
started in the first place, which was 
racism.’’ 
In Richmond, VA, David Waller saw 
the jewelry store that he runs—that his 
grandfather founded in the year 1900— 
ransacked by rioters over the weekend. 
Waller and Company is one of the old-
est Black-owned businesses in Rich-
mond. How is that justice? 
In Washington, DC, not only was the 
historic St. John’s Church burned— 
where every President we have had has 
worshipped—but the Lincoln Memorial 
was vandalized, as well as the World 
War II Memorial was vandalized, and 
the Victims of Communism Memorial 
was vandalized. That is not standing up 
for justice. 
The 
Lincoln 
Memorial—Abraham 
Lincoln led this Nation during the 
bloodiest war we have ever encoun-
tered, the Civil War. Six hundred thou-
sand Americans died in the Civil War. 
And Abraham Lincoln’s vision, restor-
ing this country and ending the abomi-
nation of slavery—I have to say, the 
Lincoln Memorial is my favorite place 
in all of Washington to go and stand 
and read the words etched in stone, to 
read the Gettysburg Address, to read 
the second inaugural of the President 
who signed the Emancipation Procla-
mation, the President whose leadership 
through that Civil War, whose leader-
ship to end slavery cost him his life at 
the hands of an assassin. Yet vandals 
defaced it. 
The U.S. Park Police reported that 
the protests on the National Mall and 
at Lafayette Park across the street 
from the White House resulted in 51 in-
jured U.S. Park Police officers. Eleven 
of those injured officers had to go to

the hospital for treatment, and three 
had to be admitted because of their in-
juries. 
In my home State of Texas, we have 
seen riots in Austin, San Antonio, Dal-
las, and Houston, my hometown—the 
hometown of George Floyd. In Austin, 
over the weekend, protesters tried to 
block a highway and destroyed mul-
tiple businesses, including a gas sta-
tion, a Food Mart, a hotel, a Target, a 
Foot Locker, and other stores and busi-
nesses. 
In Houston, another group of pro-
testers closed down Highway 59, and ri-
oters destroyed businesses and injured 
police officers. 
This must stop. There are a host of 
tools that can be used to stop it. The 
first lines of defense when it comes to 
violent crime are the brave men and 
women of our police departments who 
are risking their lives every night as 
they engage with rioters and violent 
criminals. 
Just as it is a slander to say that 
every protester is a violent rioter, it is 
also a slander—an absolute vicious 
lie—to paint every police officer as a 
racist, to paint every police officer as 
someone who commits abuse of power 
and police brutality, as we saw with 
George Floyd. 
Yes, there are some who break the 
law, and that is why the officers are 
being prosecuted. The rule of law ex-
tends to everyone. If a police officer 
breaks the law, he or she should be 
prosecuted. But when we are looking to 
protect our own families, when we are 
looking to protect our spouse, when we 
are looking to protect our children— 
the people we call on to be our first 
line of defense are the men and women 
in blue. 
Local officials who have decided po-
litically that they are not going to let 
the police officers arrest the rioters, 
but they are going to release the riot-
ers; the media that turn a blind eye 
and don’t report on the police officers 
being murdered; the Hollywood celeb-
rities who virtue signal and raise 
money to pay the bail for the people 
being arrested for violent looting— 
every one of them is contributing to 
this problem. 
We also have Federal resources. I 
have spoken with U.S. attorneys in the 
State of Texas who are directing Fed-
eral resources. There are Federal laws 
on the books against rioting: 18 USC, 
section 2101, makes it a crime to travel 
in or use interstate commerce to incite 
a riot or participate in a riot; 18 USC, 
section 231, makes it a crime to ‘‘ob-
struct, impede, or interfere’’ with a law 
enforcement officer performing his or 
her duties ‘‘in any way’’ that affects 
commerce; 18 USC, section 844, makes 
it a crime to ‘‘maliciously [damage] or 
[destroy], or [attempt] to damage or 
destroy, by means of fire or an explo-
sive, any building, vehicle, or other 
real or personal property used in inter-
state or foreign commerce’’; 18 USC, 
section 1962, the RICO statute, makes 
it a crime for anyone associated with 
an enterprise to engage in a pattern of 
racketeering activity where racket-
eering activity includes arson and rob-
bery; 26 USC, section 5861(d) makes it a 
crime to possess a destructive device, 
which is defined in a way that includes 
a Molotov cocktail; and 18 USC, section 
2314, makes it a crime to transport 
interstate or sell goods that are stolen. 
All of those are Federal laws that are 
available for Federal prosecutors, that 
are available to the FBI. The message 
that needs to come clear—loud and 
clear—from every elected official is if 
you engage in violence, if you engage 
in looting, if you destroy shops, if you 
shatter windows, if you light police 
cars on fire, if you commit acts of vio-
lence, if you physically assault your 
fellow citizens, if you physically as-
sault police officers, if you kill your 
fellow citizens, if you kill police offi-
cers, you will be prosecuted. You will 
be prosecuted, and you will go away to 
jail for a very long time. 
There are organizations that are pro-
moting this, that are funding this, that 
are 
coordinating 
this—organizations 
like antifa. For 2 years, I have been 
calling on the administration to des-
ignate antifa as a domestic terrorist 
organization. They have engaged in 
acts of violence all across this country. 
But this past week has been antifa’s 
most shameful act. 
This week, the President rightly an-
nounced that antifa would be des-
ignated as a terrorist organization. 
That means we can use law enforce-
ment resources to track down—if you 
are providing funding and organizing, 
you will be prosecuted. We will use the 
RICO laws against you, the same laws 
that take down drug dealers. 
If you are handing out bricks to 
young African-American men, trying 
to incite them to commit acts of vio-
lence, that is a criminal activity. It is 
also a cynical, bigoted activity. This 
must stop. 
Our first responsibility is to protect 
our fellow citizens, to protect their 
lives, to protect their safety, to protect 
their rights. The President has that re-
sponsibility. The Attorney General has 
that responsibility. Every U.S. attor-
ney in the country has that responsi-
bility. The FBI has that responsibility. 
The Governors of all 50 States have 
that responsibility. Mayors have that 
responsibility. Police chiefs have that 
responsibility. 
It is time for this to stop. It is time 
for us to come together. And it is time 
for the demagogues who peddle the vi-
sion, who seek personal benefit in fan-
ning the flames of racial animosity, to 
stop playing games with people’s lives. 
If you are a Hollywood celebrity and 
want to make a contribution, make a 
contribution to a fund rebuilding the 
small businesses, the African-American 
businesses, 
the 
Hispanic 
businesses 
that have been looted and burned and 
destroyed. Make a contribution to a 
fund to the families of the police offi-
cers murdered. Don’t pay to bail out 
the criminals assaulting those police 
officers, burning those African-Amer-
ican small businesses, looting those Af-
rican-American small businesses. You 
are not a social justice warrior. If you 
are lining up, seeking accolades for 
your support of violent criminals who 
are deliberately targeting the African- 
American community, I will tell you 
right now, you are not advancing racial 
equality if you are supporting violent 
criminals who are destroying far too 
many African-American communities 
and Hispanic communities. That is not 
helping the problem. 
We need to keep America safe. We 
need to protect every American, re-
gardless of race, regardless of skin 
color. We need to come together and 
keep America safe. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, for 
months, as our Nation has confronted 
this pandemic together, everyone in 
America—every single one of us—has 
been asked to make serious sacrifices, 
whether that has meant working over-
time in a hospital caring for the af-
flicted, temporarily closing a family 
business, euthanizing hogs and cattle, 
or forgoing important life events like a 
high school prom or a college gradua-
tion. COVID–19 has brought with it 
very challenging times. 
While we have missed milestones and 
time together, Americans across the 
country have stepped up to help slow 
the spread of this virus and its toll on 
the lives of our fellow citizens. While 
we cannot return to life as usual just 
yet, we are entering a new phase. Step 
by step, State by State, America is 
safely reopening. 
In Iowa, Governor Kim Reynolds has 
led our State with a steady hand dur-
ing this critical time. Under Governor 
Reynolds’ thoughtful plan and guid-
ance from public health officials at the 
local, State, and Federal level, Iowa 
communities and businesses are start-
ing to safely reopen, and many activi-
ties are carefully resuming. Iowans can 
once again participate in America’s 
great pastime and play golf. Places of 
worship are opening for services while 
taking smart precautions. And while 
they will not be as crowded as they 
once were, restaurants and bars are 
taking the first steps in opening again, 
as well as are places that we all grew 
up going to in Iowa—our amusement 
parks, racetracks, outdoor performance 
venues, movie theaters, and museums— 
all with important public health guide-
lines in mind. 
All of this is contingent, of course, 
upon having smaller groups of people 
and 
continuing 
to 
practice 
social 
distancing—simple 
precautions 
that 
can make a big difference. 
While we all yearn for life to return 
back to how it was a few months ago, 
we must be smart about taking the ap-
propriate steps. Certainly, we want to 
see our elderly relatives, gather with 
our family and friends once again, and

return to work and school. But, folks, 
the pandemic is not over. Let’s take 
this one step at a time and keep in 
mind that while restrictions are being 
loosened, they are not eliminated, and 
there is a good reason for that. 
As this process moves forward, Wash-
ington can make this transition more 
safe and successful. Working in part-
nership with the administration, State 
leaders, and the private sector, we can 
continue to increase testing and ensure 
those who may be infected are fol-
lowing proper guidelines and getting 
the care and information they need to 
limit the spread of the virus. We need 
to make sure our essential workers and 
others returning to the workforce have 
the personal protective equipment—the 
PPE—necessary to allow America to 
get back to work while ensuring the 
safety of our great workers. 
In addition, these frontline essential 
workers should absolutely be able to 
keep more of their hard-earned pay-
check—something I am working on 
closely with the administration and 
my colleagues. Our small businesses 
must be protected from predatory law-
suits 
so 
that 
Iowa’s mom-and-pop 
shops can continue to provide pay-
checks to their hard-working employ-
ees. 
Of course, we must continue to sup-
port our families—our moms and dads 
who are struggling to purchase diapers; 
our childcare providers and workers 
who have continued to look after our 
kids; our family caregivers who are 
helping Iowa seniors and those who are 
most at risk during this pandemic—and 
make sure we are prepared for what-
ever might come next. 
Let’s not only focus on the imme-
diate needs but on the long-term na-
tional priority for critical medical sup-
plies and other materials to be pro-
duced right here in the United States 
of America. We should never again de-
pend on a foreign nation to protect our 
citizens, especially one like the Com-
munist Party of China, which has been 
continually and unsurprisingly decep-
tive about this threat from the very be-
ginning. 
Folks, while we still have a ways to 
go before we can return to life as we 
know it, we will get through this, and 
when we do, we will revive the great 
economy we have built together and 
prepare for an even stronger future to-
gether. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). The Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I am 
very pleased to join my colleague from 
Iowa to highlight the need to respon-
sibly reopen America and our economy 
as we continue to fight this COVID 
pandemic. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. President, before I talk about re-
opening America, I would like to ad-
dress a deep tragedy—the brutal death 
of George Floyd. 
It is clear that our entire country is 
united in horror and opposition to the 
violent killing. Racial discrimination 
has absolutely no place in this country 
whatsoever. This senseless murder is 
unacceptable, and those responsible 
should be held accountable. I am an-
guished at the death of George Floyd. I 
am anguished at the violence we are 
seeing all across our streets today. 
There is no question that we must do 
our part to change racist attitudes 
that, unfortunately, exist today, and 
this must be done in a peaceful way. 
Looting and violent riots are not the 
way to do this, and it is not the way to 
honor George Floyd or those who are 
protesting peacefully, which is the 
great majority of people. 
The other day, George’s brother en-
couraged all of us to peacefully protest. 
He said that violence will not bring his 
brother back. No, it will not bring his 
brother back. 
It makes me sad to see businesses 
and monuments that honor some of our 
bravest heroes destroyed and violence 
happening in cities across the Nation. 
In my State of West Virginia, there 
have been protests. However, they have 
been peaceful. I commend my West Vir-
ginians for peacefully protesting, and I 
encourage them to continue this. In-
stead of violence, we need to come to-
gether as a nation, to listen to one an-
other, and to learn from one another. 
This is how real change can happen. 
President George W. Bush and Mrs. 
Laura Bush published a statement yes-
terday, and I would like to read the 
last paragraph because I found it really 
quite moving as to how we are going to 
address this issue. 
The rule of law ultimately depends on the 
fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. 
And achieving justice for all is the duty of 
all. This will require a consistent, coura-
geous, and creative effort. We serve our 
neighbors best when we try to understand 
their experience. We love our neighbors as 
ourselves when we treat them as equals, in 
both protection and compassion. There is a 
better way—the way of empathy, and shared 
commitment, and bold action, and a peace 
rooted in justice. I am confident that to-
gether, Americans will choose the better 
way. 
I appreciate so much the entire state-
ment. Those last several words, as I 
said, really touched me. 
On the matter before us today, many 
communities in our country are begin-
ning to open, including in my State of 
West Virginia. As everywhere, COVID 
has had a terrible impact on many of 
our communities all across the coun-
try. The disease has affected every part 
of our lives. More than 105,000 of our 
fellow Americans have lost their lives 
because of this terrible virus. That in-
cludes 78 West Virginians. The unoffi-
cial unemployment rate is 14 percent in 
this country, but in my State of West 
Virginia, it is a shade over 15 percent, 
and we expect those numbers to rise 
when the May numbers are published 
later this week. 
State and local officials across the 
country closed much of our economy in 
order to slow the disease. Our goal as a 
nation was to bend the curve in order 
to prevent our hospitals and other 
medical providers from being overrun. 
In West Virginia, as in most of the 
country, we have been successful in 
bending the curve and reducing the 
spread of this terrible disease. It is im-
portant, as we move now to responsibly 
reopening our economy, to continue to 
follow the guidelines that have been 
prepared by our public health experts— 
washing our hands, social distancing, 
avoiding touching your face, and wear-
ing your mask. Following these guide-
lines will help to make America’s re-
opening successful. It will protect your 
health and the health of your commu-
nity. Hindering the spread of the dis-
ease while allowing businesses to re-
main open as they follow the guidelines 
will aid in our economic recovery as 
well. 
Most Americans understand there is 
no way to choose between public health 
and a strong economy because you can-
not have one without the other. We 
can’t have a strong economy if we are 
not protecting people from becoming 
sick, and we will not be able to make 
the necessary long-term investments in 
public health if we don’t have a strong 
economy. That is why a responsible, 
step-by-step approach to reopening the 
economy that is driven by the data in 
States and local communities is so 
very important. 
West Virginia’s cumulative percent-
age of positive tests now stands at 2 
percent, which is less than one-fifth of 
the national average. As of this morn-
ing, our daily positive test percentage 
was 0.88 percent. This is despite the 
fact that West Virginia has tested a 
higher percentage of our residents than 
the national average and all of our 
neighboring States. Even more encour-
aging is that, even as we began reopen-
ing our businesses in May, our cumu-
lative percent of positive tests has re-
mained below 3 percent since April 25. 
Yet we have faced challenges. Out-
breaks at our long-term care facilities 
in Monongalia County, Wayne County, 
Jackson County, and Kanawha County 
have resulted in 43 deaths, but do you 
know 
what? 
Our 
State 
responded 
quickly and tested every resident and 
every staff member in the nursing 
homes in our State. We were the first 
State in our Nation to do this and set 
the example that many have followed. 
Just last week, we had an outbreak at 
one of our prisons, where we had 118 
positive tests. So we know that this is 
still there and that it still presents a 
danger, but I am really proud of the 
way we have pulled together during 
this crisis and addressed these chal-
lenges. 
The progress reflected by the statis-
tics is only possible because our State’s 
residents have followed the guidelines. 
I thank all of the medical profes-
sionals, the first responders, and the 
frontline workers who have gone be-
yond the call of duty to protect public 
health and keep our communities run-
ning during this most difficult time. 
Opening our economy is paramount, 
and opening it responsibly must be

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
RESTART ACT 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, last 
week, I traveled around the great State 
of Indiana on my RESTART tour. 
I visited small businesses up and 
down the State—eight cities, in fact— 
where we have seen so many Hoosiers 
adversely impacted by this pandemic. 
Like many other States, Indiana is 
starting to open up our economy, and I 
know so many Hoosiers welcome that. 
Our Governor, Eric Holcomb, has been 
implementing a five-stage plan for 
safely reopening Indiana’s economy. 
The cities on my tour have busi-
nesses that are in various stages of re-
opening. 
Restaurants 
like 
Catablu 
Grille in Fort Wayne, Arni’s in Lafay-
ette, and Woody’s Library in Carmel 
are open at 50-percent capacity right 
now. The nonprofit Terre Haute Chil-
dren’s Museum remains closed, unfor-
tunately, and is struggling to pay its 
employees. I visited Zimmer Biomet 
Hibbard, which is a medical device 
company in Valparaiso. I enjoyed the 
tour and visiting with the employees, 
but I discovered that its sales had 
dropped 95 percent in March. Fortu-
nately, it received a Paycheck Protec-
tion Program loan, and that enabled it 
to keep all 23 of its employees on the 
payroll. 
It is clear that we need to continue 
evaluating additional relief measures 
for small businesses and Indiana’s non-
profits. My RESTART Act is a viable 
approach to help keep our hardest hit 
businesses and nonprofits going. The 
RESTART Act is a bipartisan measure 
I introduced with Senator BENNET. The 
effort here is to build upon the success 
of the Paycheck Protection Program. 
We have seen that more than 74,000 
Hoosier businesses have benefited from 
PPP, with loans totaling nearly $9.4 
billion in the State of Indiana. Just for 
context, that is an average loan of 
about $130,000. These are for small busi-
nesses like those that we see up and 
down our State. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
requires funds to be spent in just 8 
weeks, but most restaurants, gyms, 
boutiques, and so many other busi-
nesses were not permitted to be open 
during part or all of that 8-week pe-
riod. So the first part of the RESTART 
Act merely extends the timeframe to 16 
weeks for our Nation’s hardest hit 
businesses. 
Secondly, we know that the PPP was 
meant to be a bridge to reopening the 
economy, but many small businesses 
have much longer bridges to cross. 
That is why our new RESTART Pro-
gram would provide loans that would 
cover up to 6 months of payroll and 
fixed operating expenses. That is just 
for those businesses that have taken a 
substantial revenue hit during this 
coronavirus pandemic. My RESTART 
initiative would provide needed funds 
with the flexibility for employers to 
pay bills and to implement social 
distancing measures, like with those 
Plexiglas dividers I have seen at so 
many businesses. Most importantly, it 
would bring employees back to work, 
which is exactly where they want to 
be. 
Over the last several weeks, I have 
spoken to more than 22,000 Hoosiers by 
using Zoom teleconferencing capabili-
ties, having conference calls, and other 
means. I have to say I am truly in-
spired by the way Hoosiers have come 
together to help one another during 
this pandemic. Everyone has done his 
part. Hoosiers want to work, and busi-
ness owners are eager to pay them. The 
RESTART Act can help make sure this 
happens, and I hope my colleagues will 
give it strong consideration in the 
coming days. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senator 
BRAUN and I be allowed to complete 
our remarks prior to the rollcall votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
have to say that Tennesseans are en-
joying being out and about. They are 
so thrilled to see the restart of our 
economy. Whether you are going to 
hair salons, restaurants, shopping cen-
ters, office parks, or manufacturing fa-
cilities, what we are hearing from Ten-
nesseans is: Thank goodness we can get 
back to work. They are grateful that 
they have had the PPP to help them 
bridge from the shutdown to the re-
start. There has been $8.8 billion that 
has made its way into our State 
through the PPP program, and our 
Governor, our Tennessee General As-
sembly, and our mayors are really 
working diligently to be certain that 
our economy opens up, that people are 
at work safely, and that we continue to 
defeat this COVID–19. 
Over the past few months, we have 
seen Congress push forward, putting 
about $3 trillion into the economy for a 
restart, and State and local govern-
ments have already put over $139 bil-
lion worth of aid to good use by sup-
porting local healthcare, helping to 
rescue businesses, and keeping compa-
nies working and local payrolls going— 
keeping people on the job. 
Our Governor and general assembly 
in Tennessee have just announced a 
new program that they are doing in 
conjunction 
with 
local 
businesses. 
Now, imagine for a moment what it 
was like to watch the economy tumble 
from the perspective of a community 
that was already struggling and trying 
to make ends meet. The pandemic 
caused catastrophic damage to the tra-
ditional economy and also to many of 
the service organizations that were 
there to meet needs. In Tennessee, as 
in many States, struggling commu-
nities 
depend 
on 
these 
nonprofit 
groups. This is why we fought so hard 
to include eligibility for nonprofits in 
the rescue funding packages. 
I will tell you that this is making a 
difference in Tennessee for some of our 
nonprofit organizations, like the East 
Tennessee-based 
Appalachia 
Service 
Project. ASP teams travel throughout 
Central Appalachia. They repair homes 
for low-income families. Mayors in the 
communities that ASP visit are run-
ning on tight budgets, and they depend 
on volunteers to fix up unsafe or un-
inhabitable homes. You can only imag-
ine how it felt to the people at ASP to 
watch their funding evaporate, know-
ing that the leaky roof that needed at-
tention over in Sneedville would end up 
turning into a rotten floor and a moldy 
wall and would be a safety hazard for 
the individuals who lived there. Fortu-
nately, ASP was able to get an SBA 
loan that gave it a little bit of breath-
ing room. Although it has had to can-
cel its volunteer program, its essential 
staff and contractors will be able to 
continue working all through the sum-
mer. 
The various rescue programs that 
Congress agreed to implement were not 
perfect by any means, but did they 
have a positive effect? From what we 
are hearing in Tennessee, they did, and 
they have been put to good use. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I am a 
Main Street entrepreneur. I have spent 
my career building a little business 
into a large one over many years in my 
hometown. My wife, as well, has oper-
ated a home accessory and gift store on 
Main Street, literally. I am elated to 
see the American economy starting to 
get off to a smart restart. 
I addressed, in a couple of floor 
speeches before we left in March, the 
question of how to reopen our econ-
omy. I believe businesses are dis-
ciplined and ready to pay attention to 
the rules—the new normal—to make 
sure their employees and their cus-
tomers stay safe. Business owners will 
follow the rules. It is in their own best 
interests to do so. They have much to 
lose 
from 
a 
new 
spike 
in 
the 
coronavirus. 
Businesses 
are 
always 
more adept, more agile than govern-
ment, and I am heartened to see the in-
novative approaches many businesses 
are taking across our country to ad-
dress this challenge. 
The virus does not affect all popu-
lations, industries, and areas of our 
country in the same way. So, natu-
rally, the reopening in Indianapolis 
will be different from that on Main 
Street in Jasper, IN. 
We should remember that although 
this presents challenges, a one-size- 
fits-all is rarely the best policy course 
of action, and decisions that affect citi-
zens are best made by the level of gov-
ernment 
closest 
to 
them—mayors,

town councils, and State governments. 
We cannot use the blanket approach 
the government took in shutting down 
the economy to reopen it. Instead, we 
need to provide the tools to empower 
local leaders and businesses who know 
their communities best to reopen safe-
ly so that our country can function 
again. 
I believe that through the persever-
ance and innovation that American 
business has always exhibited, we can 
get our economy back on the path to 
recent heights without yielding back 
any territory to the virus.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 7010 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
moment I will ask unanimous consent 
to pass legislation that makes urgently 
needed reforms to the PPP to make the 
program much more functional for 
all—underline ‘‘all’’—small businesses. 
Let me just name a few of the 
changes. First, it expands the loan pe-
riod from 8 weeks to 24 weeks. Cur-
rently, workers may be brought back 
for the 8 weeks, but what good is it if 
they are again laid off after that short 
period? It is unrealistic, and small 
businesses need assistance that can 
cover the full length of this crisis. 
Second, the legislation removes the 
25-percent restriction imposed by the 
Trump administration on the use of 
loans for fixed costs, rents, mortgages, 
utilities, and replaces it with new 60–40 
payroll-to-nonpayroll 
expenses. 
This 
change will continue PPP’s support in 
getting workers back on the payroll 
but giving small businesses more flexi-
bility to survive in this crisis, which is 
essential to the long-term employment 
prospect of the workers. 
For my home State of New York, we 
have high rents, high utility costs. 
Many businesses were frozen out when 
there was 25 percent, but 40 percent 
will get them in, and that applies to 
the more high-cost areas throughout 
the country. Even though these are 
small businesses, they are struggling 
under those costs. 
Third, the proposal extends the pro-
gram to the end of the year and makes 
December 31 the deadline to rehire 
workers in order to get full forgiveness 
on the loan. We have a long way to go 
before the economy will come back in 
real ways. This will give businesses a 
more realistic timeline to get the help 
they need while bringing back employ-
ees. 
The bill ensures any amounts of the 
loan not forgiven will have at least a 5-

June 3, 2020 
year term of repayment so that small 
businesses will not be saddled with the 
need to be repaid within 2 years. The 
impact of this crisis is long-lasting and 
requires lenient terms. We have all 
heard from small businesses in our 
States that while they are glad there is 
a program—they would have gone 
under without it; it is a very good 
thing—it needed some changes to make 
it work for so many small businesses 
that have been left out or rejected. 
I say to small businesses across the 
country: After this changes, apply 
again even if you applied the first time 
because it will be easier to meet the re-
quirements and criteria. 
This is not controversial. The House 
of Representatives passed this legisla-
tion with a vote of 417 to 1. We can’t 
wait any longer. Businesses are really 
suffering for lack of these changes, and 
to wait and wait and wait—if someone 
wants to make changes, let’s do it 
when we get to the Heroes bill, to 
COVID 4. But to delay another week or 
2 weeks or 3 weeks to get this all bol-
lixed up—we can’t afford to wait. Our 
small businesses cannot afford to wait. 
These changes are universally agreed 
to as good ones, and we shouldn’t let 
someone who wants a small change 
say: Let’s stop it until we go forward. 
The bill has the broad support of 
small 
businesses 
across 
industries, 
mom-and-pop restaurants, underserved 
businesses, minority businesses, non-
profits that have been hit hard by this 
pandemic. It should be passed by the 
Senate right now. 
These fixes will not solve every prob-
lem in PPP. Too many underserved 
small businesses and minority small 
businesses are still struggling to get 
the help they need in these troubled 
times. These will not diminish in any 
way the urgency of passing legislation 
like the Heroes Act, which provides ad-
ditional help not only for businesses 
but for homeowners, renters, essential 
workers, medical facilities, local and 
State governments, and more. Our Re-
publican colleagues must come to the 
table and work with us to pass future 
reforms. 
Nor will it divert our caucus in its 
quest for police reform and racial jus-
tice. We have to do that as well. 
But today we have an opportunity to 
pass meaningful reforms that our small 
businesses need now. We must get this 
done. Businesses are going under every 
day. Small businesses that have strug-
gled and sweated—my dad’s was one of 
them—that need help and can’t get 
help because of certain problems in 
this bill will be so relieved when we 
pass this legislation, which has already 
passed the House. 
I want to particularly thank two peo-
ple on our side who have worked long 
and hard on this legislation, who will 
speak now. One is Senator CARDIN from 
Maryland, the ranking member of the 
Committee on Small Business, and one 
is Senator SHAHEEN, the senior Senator 
from New Hampshire, who is also a 
very active member of the Small Busi-
ness Committee. I hope that passing 
this legislation in a bipartisan way as 
it did in the House will give us momen-
tum to keep working on the medical, 
economic, and racial crises that still 
affect our Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let 
me thank Senator SCHUMER for bring-
ing this issue to the floor at this time. 
Senator SCHUMER
has been a great 
leader on what we need to do to help 
respond to COVID–19. He recognized 
from the beginning that we needed a 
balanced program to deal with the 
health pandemic, with the Marshall 
Plan, to deal with the help to our State 
and local governments, and to deal 
with the economic consequences of 
COVID–19. 
Senator SCHUMER helped us develop a 
balanced approach to deal with the eco-
nomic challenges while, yes, helping 
the individual through unemployment 
insurance and direct checks from the 
IRS but also helping our businesses. 
For small businesses we created new 
tools; for larger businesses we had 
loans. 
I was proud to be part of a task force 
that was charged with developing the 
tools for small business. I want to 
thank my partner Senator SHAHEEN for 
her incredible help and leadership in 
crafting the programs of the Paycheck 
Protection Program while also dealing 
with the economic disaster loan pro-
gram, which was new and a loan for-
giveness program. 
We did this working with Senators 
RUBIO and COLLINS. It was truly bipar-
tisan. We did it in a matter of literally 
a few days—a week or so, and we were 
able to get this program crafted in a 
way that it provided incredible relief 
to the small businesses of our country. 
So today, what is the record? There 
are 4.4 million loans that have been 
issued under the Paycheck Protection 
Program, and $510 billion has been 
made available to small businesses in 
this country. It literally has been a 
lifeline allowing small companies to 
continue to exist. You see, with small 
companies, we get more job growth 
than bigger companies. We get ideas on 
how to deal with economic challenges. 
But in economic downturns they don’t 
have the liquidity and resilience that 
larger companies have. That is why we 
had to pass this type of help. We did 
that in March, and when we passed 
those bills in March, quite frankly we 
thought that by now the economy 
would be in a much better shape than 
it is and that small businesses would be 
able to return to somewhat of a normal 
economy. Well, that is not the case. 
We 
recognize 
that 
certain 
busi-
nesses—such as those in the hospitality 
field, health clubs, caterers, museums, 
and the list goes on and on—have vir-
tually not been able to open at all yet, 
and they are going to need more help 
than just the 8 weeks that was planned 
in the Paycheck Protection Program. 
That is why the legislation that passed 
the House was part of this bipartisan, 
bicameral effort to give additional 
flexibility for those who had the pay-
check protection plan loans. We recog-
nize now that 8 weeks is not long 
enough, and that is why this legisla-
tion would change that 8 weeks to 24 
weeks, giving small businesses a great-
er opportunity to qualify for a max-
imum amount of loan forgiveness and 
giving small businesses more flexi-
bility on how they allocate those funds 
between payroll and nonpayroll ex-
penses. 
As we heard today in our first over-
sight hearing in the Small Business 
and 
Entrepreneurship 
Committee, 
small businesses are different. Maybe 8 
weeks works for some, but maybe it 
doesn’t work for others. Maybe 75 per-
cent of payroll works for one but 
doesn’t work for another. We need a 
program that can fit the vast majority 
of small businesses, and the changes 
represented in the House bill rep-
resents those changes that if we had 
recognized in March that this pan-
demic would have continuing impact 
on our economy well beyond 8 weeks, 
would have certainly been considered 
during that period of time. 
Now is the time to pass this. I just 
want to underscore this point. The 8 
weeks will expire for the first loans 
that were issued under the PPP pro-
gram next week. Small businesses need 
predictability. They need to know 
whether this is going to be the law or 
not before they apply for their forgive-
ness. So we don’t have any extra time. 
We need to pass this right now. It is a 
bipartisan effort and is a bipartisan 
bill. 
What Senator SCHUMER said is abso-
lutely correct. We will have other op-
portunities to deal with other provi-
sions to help small businesses. We are 
not finished. We recognize that there 
are small businesses that may need ad-
ditional help, particularly those who 
have seen dramatic reductions in their 
revenues and the smaller of the small 
businesses and those underserved com-
munities. We need to pay attention to 
do something about that. But let’s get 
this program working right today. 
Let’s give the notices to small busi-
nesses and get this passed through the 
Senate today so that small businesses 
can plan on how to deal with the next 
several months. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am 
so pleased to be able to join Leader 
SCHUMER and my colleague and rank-
ing member of the small business com-
mittee, Senator CARDIN. I am grateful 
for his leadership and for the partner-
ship that we had back in March with 
Senators RUBIO and COLLINS. It truly 
was a bipartisan partnership to try and 
address the challenges that small busi-
nesses are facing across this country. 
In New Hampshire small businesses 
are our lifeblood. They were going

June 3, 2020 
under because of this pandemic, so the 
Paycheck Protection Program has been 
a lifesaver. But we know there are 
things that need to change about it in 
order for it to continue to help those 
businesses. 
In New Hampshire we have 22,000 
small businesses and nonprofits that 
have received over $2.5 billion in for-
givable loans under the program. 
But we have also heard from many of 
those businesses that there are im-
provements and fixes that are nec-
essary, 
businesses 
like 
The 
Little 
Grille, a New Hampshire restaurant 
with 
locations 
in 
Littleton 
and 
Woodsville. They said that PPP has 
been a lifesaver. But they have only 2 
weeks remaining on their forgivable 
term, and if the terms of the loan are 
not addressed, the owners of The Little 
Grille told us that they will be back in 
the same position they were at the 
start of the pandemic, and they may be 
forced to lay off staff. 
We have heard from the Portsmouth 
Brewery, which received their PPP 
loan, and they want to rehire their 28 
employees but they need more flexi-
bility and extensions to the program to 
resume operations. 
Then, of course, we have heard from 
Big Dave’s Bagels & Deli in North 
Conway. His 32-year-old bakery was 
predominantly takeout before the pan-
demic, but he was able to keep his em-
ployees on and offer hazard pay be-
cause his approval for the PPP loan 
came through at the very end of April. 
Now he needs flexibility and loan terms 
if he is going to keep his employees on 
the payroll. 
I could go on and on with example 
after example, but the important thing 
is, as Senators SCHUMER and CARDIN 
have said so eloquently, those first 
loans are about to end, and if we don’t 
do something to help those businesses, 
they are going to be back in the same 
place that they were in in March when 
the shelter-at-home and the stay-at- 
home orders began in New Hampshire 
and across this country. 
So we need to do something. This leg-
islation addresses the concerns that 
people have expressed. I think we also 
need to provide additional funding or 
additional help over the next month 
until things open back up in the econ-
omy. 
But, in the short term, the legisla-
tion addresses the concerns that we 
have been hearing from small busi-
nesses, and I hope we are going to see 
our colleagues pass it by unanimous 
consent so that there is some certainty 
for those businesses as they try and 
open back up in this very difficult en-
vironment. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, let 
me thank my colleagues from Mary-
land and New Hampshire for their elo-
quence. 
Again, we need to act now. We have 
waited long enough to make these 
changes. The House passed them 417 to 
1. There may be changes people want to 
make, but I would urge that we pass 
this bill now—we pass this bill imme-
diately—because small businesses need 
the certainty. In the next week or two, 
many will be affected negatively if we 
don’t get this legislation passed. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of H.R. 710, which was re-
ceived from the House; that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I appreciate 
my colleague’s desire to help small 
businesses. I really don’t think there is 
a stronger advocate in support of small 
business in all of Congress. I think I 
have proved that with my work in tax 
reform, fighting for 95 percent of Amer-
ican businesses that are pass-through 
entities. 
I think my colleagues on the floor 
here today realize that what the House 
passed has one very significant flaw in 
it—probably a technical drafting error 
but a significant flaw—which says that 
if you don’t spend 60 percent of the 
PPP loan on payroll, you get no for-
giveness, which was a dramatic dif-
ference from what it was when you had 
75 percent. 
I am in favor of all those changes. As 
Senator SHAHEEN
pointed out, there 
are a lot of problems with PPP that 
need to be corrected. My only objection 
is, before we authorize this and put an 
authorization date all the way to De-
cember 31, we need to make sure those 
changes are made. 
So my only objection is we should 
not extend this authorization without 
significant reforms that I hope my col-
leagues would all agree with; for exam-
ple, the fact that many businesses— 
again, I am not denying that PPP pro-
vided very swift funding to businesses 
that truly needed it. It was a real life-
line. It worked from that standpoint. 
But, in our case, we all knew that we 
had to do something massive, we had 
to do something quick, but we also 
knew it was going to be far from per-
fect. In our haste in crafting this, we 
made it possible for many businesses 
that didn’t need it at all to have access 
to those funds, and we don’t have an 
unlimited checking account. 
When we give money to support busi-
nesses that don’t need it, we are going 
to have less money to give to those 
that truly do need it. 
Unfortunately, what we are down to 
here with this unanimous consent re-
quest—we have been working in good 
faith with the sponsors of the House 
bill, with the Republican leadership. I 
reached out to the Democratic leader, 
saying that we are very close; I think 
we will probably be able to pass the 
House bill, with assurances, by unani-
mous consent, just not at this moment. 
So, 
again, 
I 
appreciate 
their 
thoughts. I am really not disagreeing 
with the fact that we have to do some-
thing. I want to do something as well. 
I just want to make sure that if we do 
put more money into this thing, it is 
not going to be flowing to businesses 
that don’t need it, thereby denying 
those businesses that truly do need it 
in a more targeted fashion. 
So, Madam President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
respect the good faith and sincerity in 
my colleague from Wisconsin. 
I would say this: If we change this 
bill and then go to conference with the 
House, we risk too much delay. We 
should move the bill now. We are will-
ing to, certainly, look at the changes 
that my colleague from Wisconsin pro-
poses, and we can do that in a UC to-
morrow, next week, whenever—but not 
hold this bill up because, even if the 
Senator is right in his interpretation— 
which may be right; it may be wrong— 
it doesn’t affect 95 percent of the busi-
nesses in the next few weeks that need 
help. 
So we ought to pass this bill, help the 
urgent needs that those businesses 
have, and whatever corrections that 
my colleague from Wisconsin wishes to 
make, I am sure my colleagues from 
Maryland and New Hampshire and I 
would look at it. But to hold this bill 
up now, which passed 417 to 1 in the 
House and which does so many good 
and needed things, unaffected by the 
provision that he is having trouble 
with, I think would be a sincere mis-
take. 
So I would ask him to reconsider. We 
need to pass this bill today. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Democratic 
leader yield? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to 
yield. 
Mr. JOHNSON. What we are working 
on is not a change to this legislation. 
The way we are working this we will 
still be able to pass this piece of legis-
lation unamended, unchanged, with a 
letter of intent from the chairs and the 
ranking members of the Small Busi-
ness Committees of both the House and 
the Senate—together with a commit-
ment from the majority leader—and we 
can pass this as-is. 
We don’t have to delay it. We are just 
this close. I am objecting at this time. 
Give us a little bit more time to work 
out that method, and then we will be 
able to pass this measure without 
amendment—no changes—pass this and 
then work in good faith together to 
make those changes I think we all 
agree need to be changed in the future. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will my colleague 
from Wisconsin yield for a question? 
Mr. JOHNSON. Sure. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Do I understand 
that you think you will have some res-
olution of this by this afternoon, so 
you expect at that point to come back 
in with another UC request to pass this 
bill?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2682 
June 3, 2020 
Mr. JOHNSON. Yes. With coopera-
tion from the chairmen and the rank-
ing members of both committees, I 
think we will be able to get this thing 
done. 
Again, our request is really very sim-
ple. I am not the only one. We don’t 
want to see this program automati-
cally reauthorized until the end of De-
cember. Now, there is some dispute as 
to whether the language actually does 
that. It sounds like the intent was not 
to do that; it was just to allow people 
to spend money through the end of De-
cember, which we have no problem 
with. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. That is my under-
standing of the bill; it doesn’t allow 
you to apply for the loan through De-
cember. 
Mr. JOHNSON. So, again, CRS actu-
ally interprets it as a full authoriza-
tion, so we just need to show what that 
true intent is, put that letter into the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD so that we are 
certain that we are not reauthorizing 
this or authorizing it through Decem-
ber 31; that the authorization does end 
June 30 so that, if we do want to put 
more funds into a program like PPP, 
that new program will have the type of 
directed reforms that I think we really 
could gain agreement on. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague. I would simply 
say that it seems to me he has it a lit-
tle backward. 
We should pass this bill and then 
work on the changes—not hold this bill 
up. Who knows what can happen? 
Maybe it will happen today; maybe it 
will not. We have the moment to do it 
now. We waited 21⁄2 days. We could have 
done the UC Monday. We waited until 
Wednesday afternoon. We are leaving 
here tomorrow at about 1. 
The House is not in session now. It 
would be very, very wise and helpful to 
small business—and I have talked to 
many of them all across the country— 
to pass this bill now, and then we will 
work in good faith on the small change 
that my colleague wished to have. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator 
yield? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield. 
Mr. JOHNSON. The way we are work-
ing this out, there would be no change 
required, just a letter for the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD stating what I believe 
the intent was, just to allow people to 
spend to the end of December. We are 
just working out the details of that 
language, and then we will be able to 
allow this to pass by unanimous con-
sent. 
By the way, I have gotten other 
Members who are objecting to this to 
agree to this as well. 
So just give us a little bit more time; 
agree to that language. Hopefully, the 
ranking member would agree with that 
letter for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
Pass this bill, unchanged. Then, in the 
future—because this PPP will expire 
June 30, but the need does not. 
If you read my article in the Wall 
Street Journal, I have a number of, I 
think, innovative ideas for what we can 
do to help restore capital for businesses 
that are going to need it to reopen our 
economy, and I would love to work 
very closely. 
I obviously have experience in busi-
nesses and small businesses and would 
like to work with the chairman and 
ranking member of the Small Business 
Committee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. If the Senator would 
yield, he has mentioned several dif-
ferent issues. I appreciate the fact that 
we are trying to get this done today 
and that he is indicating we have a 
path forward to get this completed this 
afternoon and the House bill to the 
President, which is our objective, so 
that small business owners under-
stand—24 weeks before their loans ex-
pire and understand the additional 
flexibility on how they can spend the 
money because they are making those 
decisions, literally, today. 
The Senator mentioned several dif-
ferent issues that he is concerned 
about, but it appears that the one area 
in which he is seeking consensus here 
deals with the authority to issue a loan 
under the PPP program through June 
of this year, which is what the law is, 
and I don’t believe it is changed by the 
House bill. Is that the issue for which 
you are seeking to get consensus from 
the ranking member and chairman? 
Mr. JOHNSON. I believe so. Again, 
there is a dispute as to what the lan-
guage actually says. Again, I have no 
problem with the full $660 billion that 
has already been appropriated to be 
spent whenever. But I don’t want to re-
authorize the program past June 30 
without the types of reforms that we 
can talk about. Then we will pass it 
through regular order. 
What I am suggesting here is to just 
wait until we have this letter of intent 
for the RECORD. We are just asking the 
chairman or ranking member of the 
Small Business Committees of both 
houses to agree to and sign, and then 
we will pass this bill as-is, unchanged, 
to give those small businesses the cer-
tainty we want to provide them. 
Mr. CARDIN. I am just trying to fig-
ure out what I am supposed to be sign-
ing as ranking member of the com-
mittee. If I understand—because the 
Senator had mentioned problems with 
the 60 percent—— 
Mr. JOHNSON. We will deal with 
those in the future. 
Mr. CARDIN. I just want to make 
sure we have—— 
Mr. JOHNSON. I have no demands 
other than one—again, we are so close. 
We are first working it out on our side, 
and then we will consult you, and 
maybe we will pass it yet tonight or 
early tomorrow morning. That is my 
goal as well. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, if 
my friend from Wisconsin is willing to 
delay the other changes he wants and 
try to work those out, it would make 
eminent sense to delay this one, as 
well, and try to work that out and pass 
this bill. You never know what hap-
pens. 
We should pass it today, not wait for 
tomorrow. We should pass it now, not 
wait a few hours. Lord knows what can 
happen. Businesses are crying out. 
I think our moving here will move 
the process forward. It wouldn’t have 
moved as quickly as if we didn’t move 
the bill, but it is still a better bet to 
help small businesses, even with the 
concern my colleague has, to pass this 
bill now. 
I would make one final plea: Let’s 
pass it now. If not, we should pass it 
today. 
Mr. JOHNSON. I am happy to come 
back or let you come back and ask for 
unanimous consent if we get this ham-
mered out, and I will not object. But, 
at this point, I am going to object until 
we get this hammered out. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today as the United States of 
America, again, faces the enormous 
challenge and responsibility of striving 
to live up to the preamble of the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
The preamble provides: ‘‘We the Peo-
ple of the United States, in Order to 
form a more perfect Union, establish 
Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, 
provide for the common defense, pro-
mote the general Welfare, and secure 
the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves 
and our Posterity, do ordain and estab-
lish this Constitution for the United 
States of America.’’ 
I note that our Founders, who were 
far from perfect when it came to racial 
issues, thought that justice was more 
important than domestic tranquility. 
They listed justice first. 
Today, America is grieving over the 
brutal and unnecessary death of George 
Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. Both 
State and Federal law enforcement of-
ficers are moving quickly to bring the 
police officers in this case to justice 
and hold them accountable for their ac-
tions, as Mr. Floyd’s cries of ‘‘I can’t 
breathe’’ went unanswered as the life 
drained out of him. 
Video taken by several witnesses 
show that George Floyd—who was 
Black and was unarmed—was hand-
cuffed and pinned to the ground by a 
police officer who held his knee against 
Mr. Floyd’s neck as he pleaded for his 
life. Mr. Floyd was on the ground, re-
peatedly telling the officer that he 
could not breathe. And despite the fact 
that bystanders are all heard on video 
begging the officer to relent, he did not 
remove his knee from Mr. Floyd’s neck 
until after an ambulance arrived. 
Eventually Mr. Floyd lost conscious-
ness. He was pronounced dead after 
being transported to a local hospital. 
As leaders, regardless of party, we 
cannot 
stay 
silent 
about 
George

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2683 
June 3, 2020 
Floyd’s death. Black lives matter. 
George Floyd was a father, a son, and a 
brother. His life mattered. He did not 
need to die. He and his family deserve 
justice. How many other Black men 
and women have died at the hands of 
law enforcement or vigilante civilians 
due to the color of their skin but have 
not been caught on video? Those vic-
tims deserve justice too. 
We must act, working together, to 
fundamentally reform the ways police 
across this Nation interact with the 
communities they serve. 
On Monday night, President Trump 
once again failed to lead this Nation in 
a time of crisis, and he has forfeited his 
moral authority as President. Spraying 
tear gas at peaceful protesters to clear 
a path for a photo op is opposite of 
American values and basic human 
rights. It violates civil and human 
rights under any circumstances. 
President Trump fans the flames of 
racism and seeks to divide Americans 
for political purposes, just as he did in 
Charlottesville and far too many places 
since. He seems willfully blind to the 
reason people are protesting in the 
first place—to end systematic racism 
in the repeated and tragic targeting of 
Blacks by law enforcement. 
Congress, finally, must act to pass a 
comprehensive plan to reform police 
community relations, improve training 
and hiring of police officers, and hold 
police accountable for misconduct and 
use of excessive force. We must rebuild 
trust between the police and the com-
munities they serve. 
For those who are asking ‘‘Why did it 
take so long?’’ the answer is ‘‘We have 
been trying.’’ It should not have taken 
so long, but year after year too many 
of my colleagues have put partisanship 
before justice and equality. 
As both the House and Senate pre-
pare to hold hearings on police reform 
and racial profiling issues, I want to 
bring to my colleagues’ attention two 
pieces of legislation that I have filed: 
The End Racial and Religious Profiling 
Act and the Law Enforcement Trust 
and Integrity Act. If enacted, these two 
bills could make an enormous dif-
ference and constitute a giant step for-
ward in reforming police departments 
in America and rebuilding trust be-
tween police officers and the commu-
nities they are sworn to protect and 
serve. 
The 
End 
Racial 
and 
Religious 
Profiling Act is designed to enforce the 
constitutional right to equal protec-
tion under the law by eliminating ra-
cial profiling at all levels of law en-
forcement by changing the policies and 
procedures underlying the practice. 
First, the bill provides a prohibition 
on racial profiling, enforceable by de-
claratory or injunctive relief. It cre-
ates a standard definition of racial 
profiling, which now includes religion, 
gender, and other protected categories 
for Federal, State, and local law en-
forcement, enforcing criminal, civil, 
and immigration laws. 
Can law enforcement still provide a 
detailed description of a suspect that 
includes race? The answer is yes. But 
the bill prohibits blanket targeting 
solely based on race or one of the other 
protected categories. 
This bill also mandates training on 
racial profiling issues as part of Fed-
eral law enforcement training, the col-
lection of data on all routine and spon-
taneous investigatory activities, and 
the creation of procedures for receiv-
ing, 
investigating, 
and 
responding 
meaningfully to complaints alleging 
racial profiling by law enforcement. 
Systematic racism will not disappear 
overnight. We must engage all law en-
forcement in aggressive training and 
then have data to show where there is 
progress and where challenges remain. 
Our bill authorizes the Department of 
Justice grants for the development and 
implementation of best policing prac-
tices. 
The second bill is the Law Enforce-
ment Trust and Integrity Act that I 
have filed. The Law Enforcement Trust 
and Integrity Act takes a comprehen-
sive approach at addressing the issue of 
police 
accountability 
and 
building 
trust between police departments and 
their communities. 
This legislation provides incentives 
for local police organizations to volun-
tarily adopt performance-based stand-
ards to ensure that instances of mis-
conduct will be minimized through ap-
propriate management, training, and 
oversight protocols. The bill provides 
that if such incidents do occur, they 
will be properly investigated. 
The bill provides police officers—the 
vast majority of whom perform their 
job professionally, putting their lives 
on the line daily, protecting their com-
munities—with the tools necessary to 
improve community relations and en-
hance their professional growth and 
education. 
It authorizes $25 million for addi-
tional expenses related to the enforce-
ment of civil rights statutes, including 
compliance with consent decrees or 
judgments regarding police misconduct 
brought by the Department of Justice. 
In Baltimore City, for example, the 
Baltimore Police Department volun-
tarily entered into a consent decree in 
2017 with the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice to overhaul the police department. 
An earlier Department of Justice re-
port had found a widespread pattern 
and practice of illegal and unconstitu-
tional conduct by the Baltimore Police 
Department through targeting African- 
American 
residents 
for 
dispropor-
tionate and disparate treatment. 
The legislation I have authored also 
authorizes 
appropriations 
for 
addi-
tional expenses related to conflict reso-
lution, including programs managed by 
the Department of Justice’s Commu-
nity Relations Services within the 
Civil Rights Division. 
I am pleased that, to date, the pro-
tests in Baltimore have been largely 
peaceful, especially compared to 2015 
after the death of Freddie Gray in Bal-
timore Police Department custody. 
I do hope my fellow Americans look 
to Baltimore in 2020 as an example for 
how to peacefully protest and petition 
the government for redress of griev-
ances, 
as 
Baltimore 
has 
willingly 
agreed to work with the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice to overhaul its entire 
police force so that policing its citizens 
is both fair and effective. 
As many of my colleagues have said 
before, ‘‘Civil Rights is still the unfin-
ished business of America.’’ Prejudice, 
discrimination, and outright racism 
continues to limit the lives of the large 
number of our people. We must con-
tinue the struggle today in order to 
make urgent progress. 
As I close, I am reminded of my dear 
friend, the late Representative Elijah 
Cummings, who died last year. He was 
a fellow Baltimorean and fellow grad-
uate of the University of Maryland 
Law School. He gave the eulogy for 
Freddie Gray in 2015, who died after 
being arrested and taken into police 
department custody. 
During the church service, he closed 
with a quote from the Book of Amos: 
I want justice, oceans of it. I want fairness, 
rivers of it. That’s what I want. That’s all I 
want. 
Elijah also asked a pointed question 
of those of us at the funeral that day, 
as well as to the news cameras that 
were broadcasting the event nationally 
and around the world. Elijah asked: 
‘‘Did anyone recognize Freddie when he 
was alive . . . did anyone see him?’’ 
Elijah asked whether society had 
done all that it could have done when 
Gray was ‘‘struggling to simply be all 
God meant for him to be?’’ 
Today, I ask my fellow Americans to 
ask that question when it comes to the 
lives of not only George Floyd but 
Tony McDade, Sean Reed, Breonna 
Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. I say here 
today to Black Americans: I see you. I 
hear you. You are men and women. You 
have families. You have the same 
rights as every other individual in this 
country. 
In a 2019 interview with ‘‘60 Min-
utes,’’ Steve Kroft noted as follows: 
Cummings is not a patient man. It’s a les-
son he learned from his late grandmother, 
who imparted her mindset shortly before she 
died. White people, she told him, had been 
telling African Americans to wait—and he 
shouldn’t. 
She says, ‘‘Your daddy, he been waiting 
and waiting and waiting for a better day,’’ 
Cummings recalled. She said, ‘‘He’s going to 
wait, and he’s going to die.’’ She said, ‘‘Don’t 
you wait.’’ 
Then, in his late sixties, Elijah Cum-
mings said that when he looks into the 
future, he also reflects on his life. ‘‘I 
realized that with African American 
people, where we’ve been blocked from 
being all that God meant for us to be, 
I don’t have time to be patient.’’ 
Yes, Elijah often said of America 
that ‘‘we are better than this.’’ Let’s 
prove Elijah right. I urge the Senate 
not to be patient any longer and wait 
for the next death of an African Amer-
ican in police custody before taking ac-
tion. Let us hold our hearings and then 
expeditiously take up and pass legisla-
tion, including the two bills I have ex-
plained on the floor today, as the next

steps in establishing justice in our still 
imperfect Union. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I be al-
lowed to complete my remarks before 
the vote occurs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
since the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion launched the Crossfire Hurricane 
counterintelligence 
investigation 
in 
July of 2016, there has been no shortage 
of media coverage of Russia’s involve-
ment in our 2016 election. For the bet-
ter part of 3 years, there has been news; 
there has been speculation; there have 
been rumors; there have been partisan 
accusations made about that topic. 
Trying to keep up with the names 
and the dates, the allegations left you 
feeling like an old-school detective 
show—names and photos pinned to a 
board, with strings of yarn connecting 
all the pieces. Everyone expected the 
release of the special counsel’s report 
to be the moment when those dots were 
finally connected and it explained what 
happened and who was responsible. 
It is safe to say that did not happen. 
Even though the Mueller report did not 
find any collusion or obstruction, there 
was a lot of information that since has 
been made public about its origins, its 
motivation, and the means by which 
that investigation occurred. In fact, 
rather than settling the matter, these 
revelations have prompted a whole new 
range of questions about the investiga-
tion itself. 
First of all, we had Rod Rosenstein in 
the Judiciary Committee. He was the 
Deputy Attorney General. I asked him 
whether he was aware of any precedent 
for what happened in 2016 when, at the 
same time, both major parties’ polit-
ical nominees for President of the 
United States were the subject of open 
FBI investigations. He said: No, there 
is no precedent for that. 
First, of course, it was the Hillary 
email scandal, after which Director 
Comey made another unprecedented 
move and had a press conference saying 
that even though she had been essen-
tially grossly negligent in handling 
this private email server, he thought 
that no reasonable prosecutor would 
bring charges against her. 
As much as Secretary Clinton might 
have appreciated that announcement, 
or not, a few weeks later, the FBI Di-
rector wrote another letter and said: 
Hey, we have some Anthony Weiner 
emails that came up on his laptop, so 
we need to reopen the investigation 
just a few days before the general elec-
tion. 
Well, you can imagine Secretary 
Clinton didn’t appreciate that. Many 
people have said that it is because of 
the FBI’s unprecedented involvement 
in the middle of a Presidential election 
that it damaged, if not decided, the 
election in 2016. 
And then, of course, there is the 
Trump-Russia influence investigation, 
better known as Crossfire Hurricane, 
leading up to the Mueller investigation 
and where we are today. In the time 
since the special counsel completed his 
investigation and issued his report 
more than a year ago, we have learned 
more about the behind-the-scenes work 
that guided the Russia probe. 
Thanks to Inspector General Horo-
witz and his team at the Department of 
Justice, thanks to the DNI, the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence, and others 
for declassifying important informa-
tion, we have a whole lot more insight 
and transparency into exactly what 
happened. But these revelations have 
given all of us pause for grave concern. 
They have highlighted a pattern of 
sloppiness and outright abuse of power 
at the highest levels of the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation and beyond and 
raised red flags that must be addressed. 
In the Senate, it is our duty to get to 
the bottom of how and why this hap-
pened. I can’t imagine any Democrat, 
any Republican, any American saying 
what happened in the 2016 election to 
Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump 
was OK. Our law enforcement agencies 
should not play a starring role in an 
election leading up to the Nation’s 
highest office. 
This morning, the first step in our in-
vestigation into the origins, means, 
and methods of the Crossfire Hurricane 
investigation occurred in the Judiciary 
Committee. That is where we heard 
from Deputy Attorney General Rod 
Rosenstein. He wasn’t the Deputy At-
torney General until the spring of 2017, 
but he did play a key role in the inves-
tigation. He signed one of the applica-
tions for the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act warrant that allowed the 
FBI to essentially surveil an American 
citizen. He was the one who appointed 
Special Counsel Bob Mueller. He ended 
up being not only an investigator but 
also a witness in the process. 
His account of what happened in the 
Crossfire Hurricane investigation is 
important to understanding both the 
actions and the motivations that drove 
that investigation. In fact, he said this 
morning, in response to Chairman 
LINDSEY
GRAHAM’s question, if you 
knew then what you know now, would 
you have signed, sworn to this verified 
application for a warrant to surveil an 
American citizen, Carter Page? He 
said: No. To his credit, he said no. ‘‘If 
I knew then, what I know now.’’ 
Some of my greatest concerns stem 
from the Department of Justice Inspec-
tor General’s report about those FISA 
abuses, as they are called—Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act. This is ex-
traordinary authority given by Con-
gress under very strict rules, and they 
are supervised by the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Court, which was 
established to provide oversight of 
these surveillance activities, including 
surveillance 
of 
American 
citizens 
under 
very 
narrow 
and 
restricted 
guardrails. 
If the U.S. intelligence authorities, 
or law enforcement agencies, believe 
surveillance is critical to a national se-
curity investigation, they submit an 
application to the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court to receive that au-
thorization. This is an important step 
in protecting the rights of American 
citizens and making sure that our in-
telligence and law enforcement au-
thorities perform their job consistent 
with congressional intent and direc-
tion. But these verified, in other words, 
sworn documents are critical, in which 
accuracy is paramount. That is why 
they are required to be verified—that 
is, sworn to—by the top officials at the 
Department of Justice. 
We now know that the applications 
of the former Trump campaign aide 
Carter Page were riddled with errors. 
In the initial Carter Page FISA appli-
cation, 
Inspector 
General 
Horowitz 
identified what he called seven mis-
takes. In the three renewals, he had 
found an additional 10. These weren’t 
necessarily honest mistakes. In fact, 
they included significant and material 
errors, including the deliberate fal-
sification, lying—lying to the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Court about 
Carter Page’s past service to the U.S. 
Government. 
To make matters worse, even as new 
and exculpatory material came to 
light, this information was not re-
flected in renewal applications. It was 
sort of a cut-and-paste job. Those 
agents who prepared those materials 
that were signed by people like Rod 
Rosenstein lied to deceive the court so 
they could continue to surveil, or spy, 
on an American citizen—something we 
do not want to happen unless they are 
truly an agent of a foreign power and 
there is probable cause to show that 
they are such. 
These revelations were very trou-
bling in December of 2019, and they are 
just as troubling today. It does also 
raise questions about the motivations 
for the investigation, in the first place. 
Falsifying a FISA application is clear-
ly not an action one would take if you 
were in pursuit of the truth. We need 
to know why the initial application 
and three renewals were riddled with 
lies and omissions and how these inac-
curate applications were approved by 
high-ranking officials at the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
Second, this raises serious questions 
about the way investigations of aver-
age Americans are being handled. If 
these agents were able to break every 
rule in the book to spy on a Presi-
dential candidate—who ultimately was 
elected—and 
are 
facing 
no 
con-
sequences, no accountability, what pro-
tections exist for the rest of us in 
America? Who is going to notice their 
error-ridden FISA applications if it is 
John or Jane Q. Public? 
What is even more disconcerting is, if 
this happened once—and it did happen 
more than once—what is to stop it 
from happening again? The American 
people need and deserve answers to

June 3, 2020 
these questions, and today’s hearing in 
the Judiciary Committee was the first 
step in getting the answers to those 
questions and hopefully corrective ac-
tion. 
Chairman GRAHAM
has been clear 
that we will look at this investigation 
from all angles—covering the FISA 
abuses, unmasking requests, and the 
origins of both Crossfire Hurricane, and 
the appointment of special counsel. 
The trove of declassified transcripts 
that recently were released by the 
House Intelligence Committee—actu-
ally, declassified by the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence—only underscores 
the important need for oversight by 
the Senate and by the Congress. In 
reading these transcripts, which were 
taken in secret, in a secure facility, 
and only recently made public, I have 
been shocked at some of the state-
ments made by former Obama adminis-
tration officials. 
Based on the way Chairman SCHIFF 
repeatedly claimed to have direct evi-
dence, you would think these officials 
would provide the smoking gun to the 
committee. But no—witness after wit-
ness confirmed they had no evidence of 
collusion, coordination, or conspiracy 
between anyone in the Trump cam-
paign and Russia. What did they do? 
They walked outside of that secure fa-
cility, and they spoke to the TV cam-
eras assembled there, and they lied. 
They misrepresented what was said 
during that classified testimony. 
This really begs the question: Why 
did this investigation begin and how, 
without evidence, did it last for nearly 
2 years? 
Additionally, I have a lot of ques-
tions about the sloppy and incomplete 
investigative work surrounding Cross-
fire Hurricane when it came to the use 
of something called a confidential 
human source. 
Christopher 
Steele, 
former 
intel-
ligence officer from the United King-
dom, was hired by Fusion GPS to do 
opposition research against the Trump 
campaign for the Hillary Clinton cam-
paign. Yet, at the same time, he was 
considered by the FBI as a confidential 
human source. 
Inspector General Horowitz’s report 
makes clear Mr. Steele and his FBI 
handler did not even agree on the 
terms of their arrangement. Steele 
said: I am a businessman collecting in-
formation. The FBI said: Well, this is 
just between us, and you can’t talk to 
the public, which he clearly did, and he 
did so at the same time he was sup-
posed to be a confidential human 
source. 
The FBI background check into 
Christopher Steele was so sloppy, they 
didn’t even understand that his loyal-
ties were not with the FBI and the U.S. 
Government, they were with his pay-
master—Fusion GPS, his employer. 
That is one reason there were such in-
accuracies throughout this investiga-
tion, including in the FISA applica-
tions. 
So we need answers, and we need ac-
countability. Based on what I have 
seen so far, one conclusion is that 
there was a coordinated effort to ma-
nipulate our intelligence community 
and justice system for vindictive and 
biased purposes against a Presidential 
candidate and elected President of the 
United States. I realize that this is a 
grave and serious charge, but I think it 
is one conclusion you could draw based 
on what we know. 
It is high time we learned the truth. 
If this kind of misbehavior and decep-
tion becomes routine, it will jeopardize 
important legal authorities that we 
rely on to protect our national secu-
rity. It is counter to our values and is 
a direct blow to the foundation of our 
democracy. 
I 
appreciate 
Chairman 
GRAHAM’s 
prioritizing these oversight hearings. I 
know we have a lot of work to do in 
order to restore public confidence in 
our justice system as well as in our in-
telligence 
community—the 
people 
charged with protecting the American 
people. We need to learn what really 
happened so we can make sure this 
never ever, ever happens again.

IMMIGRANT HEALTHCARE HEROES 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Ameri-
cans owe a great debt of gratitude to 
the healthcare heroes on the frontlines 
of the fight against the COVID–19 
virus. 
Today I would like to spend a minute 
talking about one special group of 
those healthcare workers: immigrants. 
Consider this: One out of every six 
healthcare and social service workers 
in America is an immigrant—3 million 
out of 18 million immigrants. They are 
playing a critical role in the battle 
against the pandemic. Yet our broken 
immigration laws do not allow many of 
them to fulfill their dreams of actually 
becoming Americans. 
I have come to the floor today to tell 
the story of one of our immigrant 
healthcare heroes. I will continue to 
highlight these stories in the coming 
weeks. There has been so much nega-
tive publicity about immigrants. Yet, 
when you follow what is happening in 
hospitals across America—large and 
small, rural and urban—and so many 
times you ask ‘‘Doctor, where were you 
born?’’ you find they weren’t born in 
the United States, but they came here 
to practice medicine, and now their 
work is saving lives every day. 
I invite my colleagues and others to 
share stories from their own commu-
nities and their own States and to use 
the social media hashtag ‘‘Immigrant 
Health Heroes.’’ 
Thousands 
of 
immigrant 
health 
workers are suffering because of a seri-
ous problem in our immigration sys-
tem. It is called the green card back-
log. If you are not in immigrant status, 
you may not know anything about it, 
but trust me, they do. 
This backlog puts them and their 
families at risk of losing their immi-
gration status, and it hinders their 
ability to join in the fight against 
COVID–19. Under current law, there are 
not nearly enough immigrant visas— 
also known as green cards—available 
each year. As a result, many immi-
grants in the United States are stuck

June 3, 2020 
in crippling backlogs, not just for years 
but for decades. Close to 5 million fu-
ture Americans—close to 5 million—are 
in line waiting for green cards. Hun-
dreds of thousands are working in the 
United States on a temporary visa 
while many more are waiting abroad, 
separated from their American fami-
lies. 
Only 226,000 family green cards and 
140,000 employment green cards are 
available each year. The backlogs are a 
real hardship on these families caught 
in immigration limbo. For example, 
children in many of these families age 
out and face deportation. While their 
parents are waiting for the green card, 
the child reaches the age where they 
are deported, at age 21. 
The green card backlog includes 
thousands of doctors currently working 
in the United States on temporary 
visas. These doctors face many restric-
tions due to their temporary status, 
such as not being able to take shifts at 
hospitals in COVID–19 hotspots where 
they may be desperately needed. 
The solution to the green card back-
log is very clear: Increase the number 
of green cards. 
In 2013, I joined a group of four Re-
publicans and four Democrats who au-
thored bipartisan comprehensive immi-
gration reform legislation. Our bill, 
which passed the Senate on a strong bi-
partisan 68-to-32 vote, would have 
eliminated this green card backlog. 
Last year I introduced the RELIEF 
Act, legislation based on the 2013 com-
prehensive immigration reform bill, 
which would clear the backlogs for all 
immigrants waiting in line for green 
cards within 5 years. I will keep fight-
ing to help these immigrants here in 
the United States who simply want a 
chance to continue to serve this Na-
tion. 
Last month I joined with my col-
leagues—Senators PERDUE of Georgia, 
YOUNG of Indiana, CORNYN of Texas, 
COONS
of Delaware, and LEAHY
of 
Vermont—to introduce legislation to 
quickly address the plight of immi-
grant doctors and nurses stuck in this 
green card backlog. 
This backlog poses a significant risk 
to our ability to effectively respond to 
this pandemic. Our bill, the Healthcare 
Workforce Resilience Act, is a tem-
porary 
stopgap 
effort 
that 
will 
strengthen our healthcare workforce 
and improve healthcare for Americans 
in the midst of this national emer-
gency. 
Our bill would reallocate 25,000 un-
used immigrant visas for nurses and 
15,000 unused immigrant visas for doc-
tors. These are visas that Congress has 
previously authorized but were not 
used. 
It is important to note that our bill 
requires employers to attest to a very 
important fact. They have to attest 
that immigrants from overseas who re-
ceive these visas will not displace an 
American worker. We want to ensure 
that the beneficiaries of this bill help 
build our workforce but not at the ex-
pense of those already here in the 
United States. 
Our bill now has 13 Republican and 13 
Democratic cosponsors and broad sup-
port from the medical community. As 
Congress works on the next legislation 
to address the COVID–19 pandemic, I 
am going to join my Republican col-
leagues and push for the Healthcare 
Workforce Resilience Act to be in-
cluded. 
Today, let me tell you the story of 
one 
immigrant 
healthcare 
worker 
stuck in this green card backlog wait-
ing indefinitely, for years, and he 
would benefit from the Healthcare 
Workforce Resilience Act: Dr. Parth 
Mehta, born in India. 
As a child, he was inspired to pursue 
a career in medicine by his grand-
father, who worked as an assistant to a 
physician, and by his older sister, who 
is a surgeon. 
Dr. Mehta came to the United States 
in the year 2004. He has been here 16 
years. He obtained a master’s in public 
health at Saint Xavier University in 
the city of Chicago. He then completed 
his residency in internal medicine at 
St. Joseph’s Hospital in Chicago. 
In 2010, 10 years ago, Dr. Mehta began 
working as a hospitalist at UnityPoint 
Health Methodist Medical Center in 
downstate Peoria, IL. 
He sent me a letter, and here is what 
he says about being a doctor: 
I feel that it is a great privilege to help 
people, comforting them, healing them, and 
making them better when they are most vul-
nerable. 
Dr. Mehta lives in Peoria with his 
wife and his 10-year-old son and 4-year- 
old daughter, and he writes, in addi-
tion: 
We have called Peoria home for 10 years 
now and we love our community here. We 
have bought a home here, built a career here, 
and we plan to stay in this community as 
long as we can. 
Now Dr. Mehta is on the frontlines of 
the pandemic, treating COVID–19 pa-
tients. He was also selected as the prin-
cipal investigator for a COVID–19 trial 
for which the hospital has applied, but 
unfortunately, Dr. Mehta is one of 
thousands of doctors who are stuck in 
this green card backlog. He has been on 
a temporary work visa for 13 years. He 
has been forced to renew his visa four 
times since he became a doctor. His 
green card petition was filed in 2011, 
but he will have to wait years and 
years and years before he receives a 
green card. 
In the midst of this pandemic, Dr. 
Mehta’s immigration status puts him 
at great risk. If, God forbid, he con-
tracts COVID–19 and becomes disabled 
or dies, his family would immediately 
lose their immigration status and be 
forced to leave the United States. 
Dr. Mehta has written goodbye let-
ters to his wife and kids and prepared 
an emergency binder with all the nec-
essary information for his family if he 
dies. To keep his family safe, Dr. 
Mehta has isolated himself by living in 
the basement of his home. He is espe-
cially worried about his wife, who has 
asthma. In March, she was diagnosed 
with pneumonia and was hospitalized 
for 10 days, including a stay in the in-
tensive care unit. 
Here is what Dr. Mehta wrote to me 
about this: 
Seeing COVID patients, treating them, 
taking care of them, and saving their lives is 
part of my job, and I will never shy away 
from doing my job. But how is it fair that 
my family gets no protection if I die doing 
my job? 
Dr. Mehta’s story makes it clear why 
Congress needs to pass the Healthcare 
and Workforce Resilience Act. Under 
our bill, Dr. Mehta and thousands of 
others like him could receive their 
green cards. They and their families 
would get the permanent immigration 
status they deserve and be able to use 
their skills to serve on the frontlines of 
the pandemic, where they are needed 
most. 
Don’t put a sign in the window say-
ing that you love healthcare workers, 
don’t come out at 7 at night and beat 
on a pan to show that you care for 
healthcare workers and ignore the re-
ality that this man in Peoria, IL, is 
risking his life every day to treat those 
patients, and we have written a law 
that says you are basically not wel-
come in the United States. 
How can we say this to him, to thou-
sands just like him, doctors and nurses 
who are really caring for the people we 
love and risking their own lives in the 
process? 
It would be great, in these times of 
political division, if we could come to-
gether in this Congress to quickly aid 
these immigrant healthcare heroes. 
The bill that I have introduced with 
Senator PERDUE, Senator YOUNG, and 
others is a step toward reality, toward 
realizing that people just like these 
make us a better nation and a stronger 
nation. 
Dr. Mehta and his family, with all 
their fears, should know that there are 
many here in Congress, particularly 
here in the Senate, who want to move 
as quickly as possible and make sure 
that their lives are better because they 
have done so much to make the lives of 
others better. 
I yield the floor.

S2687 
June 3, 2020 
the Senate to talk about the death of 
two Americans last week. One tragedy 
is tearing our communities apart. The 
other may well show us a path back to-
ward unity. 
We all know about the brutal, sense-
less killing of George Floyd in Min-
neapolis last Monday. There is no ex-
cuse for what the police did to Mr. 
Floyd. His killers are being brought to 
justice. 
His death, we hope, will not be re-
membered for the senseless violence 
launched falsely in his name but, rath-
er, hopefully, in the long-term reform 
of policing policies across our country. 
In my home State of Utah, the city 
of Ogden is mourning another death, 
that of Police Officer Nate Lyday. 
On Thursday, May 28, a woman called 
9–1–1 saying that her husband was 
threatening her life. Lyday and a group 
of officers arrived promptly at the 
house. The man began shooting at 
them from inside the home. Lyday was 
mortally wounded. 
He was just 24 years old. He was 
about to celebrate his fifth wedding an-
niversary with his wife Ashley. 
He had been on the job as a police of-
ficer for just 15 months. By all ac-
counts, he did that job honorably and 
completely up to the last moment. 
Nate Lyday was an officer who sought 
to uphold justice and protect the inno-
cent, even making the ultimate sac-
rifice on behalf of a threatened and 
fearful family. 
Nate Lyday was a ‘‘son of Ogden,’’ as 
Police Chief Randy Watt said. Ogden 
was where he was born and raised, 
where he went to high school, and 
where he worked on a regular basis at 
the Fresh Market on 20th Street and 
where he got his degree in criminal jus-
tice from Weber State University. 
And it was where he was proud to 
serve and protect his community as a 
sworn police officer. According to Lieu-
tenant Brian Eynon, Lyday was an offi-
cer who ‘‘worked over and above the 
call of duty.’’ Eynon said that when-
ever he passed Lyday in the hallways, 
the young officer would always smile 
at him, even before he had a chance to 
smile first. 
As his colleagues, his friends, and his 
classmates remember him, Nate Lyday 
made everyone around him feel like a 
friend, no matter how well they knew 
him because they were indeed his 
friends. 
This Saturday, while far too many 
other communities throughout our Na-
tion were tearing themselves apart, 
Ogden came together. Hundreds of 
Ogden residents gathered near the 
front steps of the Ogden Municipal 
Building to honor the memory of 
George Floyd and to call for nation-
wide police reform. 
But this was not a divisive event de-
signed to make everyone choose sides 
between 
police 
and 
protesters. 
As 
Malik Dayo, an Ogden activist and or-
ganizer, said that day: 
This is a peaceful protest. . . . This is not 
an anti-cop rally. This is a solidarity rally. 
The protesters at the event honored 
George’s memory, they condemned rac-
ism, and they called for policing re-
forms. They also thanked the officers 
who were there, the same officers there 
protecting them and protecting their 
First Amendment rights to speak free-
ly and gather peacefully. And they 
honored the memory of Officer Lyday, 
who lost his life answering the call of 
duty just a few days before. 
‘‘I gave them my condolences for 
their fallen officer—our fallen officer— 
because we’re all part of the same com-
munity,’’ Dayo said of the police after 
the protest. 
And Dayo is right. Nate Lyday’s loss 
is our loss. George Floyd’s loss is our 
loss. And we ought to honor and re-
member them both. 
We must all work to uphold justice 
for all. Both of these tragic, horrific 
deaths last week show us just how far 
we still have to go to achieve this goal. 
It is work that must be undertaken by 
each and every one of us, each and 
every day. We cannot do that work by 
pitting ourselves against one another— 
race versus race, police versus pro-
tester. 
We will never move forward if we 
continue to reduce human beings to 
the color of their skin or the color of 
their uniform. We are all one Nation, 
and it will only be in standing and in 
working together, in peaceful soli-
darity, that we can finally heal the 
wounds in our Nation. 
What the people of Ogden did this 
weekend is an example for us all. And 
it is a reason for hope. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
f 
THE GULF OF MEXICO 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to talk for a few minutes today about 
the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security 
Act, the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, the Great American Outdoors 
Act, and fairness. 
Let me start with the Gulf of Mexico 
Energy Security Act—GOMESA, as you 
know. 
Louisianians started drilling off our 
coast in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1930s. 
They were Louisiana people, Louisiana 
companies. There were some other 
States represented, as well, but they 
were primarily Louisiana companies. 
A lot of people laughed at us, said it 
can’t be done: We know you can drill 
for oil and natural gas and supply the 
country’s energy needs by onshore pro-
duction, but offshore, man, you are 
dreaming. 
We did it. Then we did it again and 
we did it again and we did it again. 
All of a sudden, the Federal Govern-
ment said: Huh, there is money to be 
had. And the Federal Government 
came in and said: Louisiana, you can’t 
do that anymore. We own all the land 
under the oceans and the Gulf of Mex-
ico. 
Well, 
predictably, 
Louisiana 
dis-
agreed. We went to court. After 30 
years of litigation, Louisiana lost. The 
courts ended up ruling that Louisiana 
owns the land in the gulf from its 
coastline out to 3 miles, and the Fed-
eral Government owns the rest. And 
the Federal Government owns the rest. 
That is a little bit of oversimplifica-
tion but not much. 
I always thought that was unfair. For 
example, Texas, our sister State—I 
love Texas—owns from its coastline 10 
miles out. We only own 3 miles out. 
More oil and gas wells were drilled in 
the Gulf of Mexico. It became one of 
the major—if not the major—sources of 
oil and natural gas for energy needs of 
America up to the point that we were 
producing and still are producing about 
$5 billion that goes right into the 
Treasury of the United States of Amer-
ica. 
In 2006, Congress passed GOMESA. 
Thank you, Congress, for doing this. 
GOMESA said that the Federal Govern-
ment is going to start sharing some of 
those oil and gas royalties. We are not 
going to share all of them. We are just 
going to share the oil and gas royalties 
from lands under the ocean in the Gulf 
of Mexico for all future leases after 
2006—not 
past 
leases, 
only 
future 
leases. Here is the new deal, according 
to Congress. On all these new leases 
drilled after 2006, the U.S. Treasury 
will take 50 percent of oil and gas roy-
alties. The gulf-producing States will 
take 37.5 percent. By the gulf-pro-
ducing 
States, 
I 
mean 
Louisiana, 
Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. And 
12.5 percent of the oil and gas royalties 
from these new leases—not old leases, 
these new leases—will go to the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. I will 
come back to the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund in a moment. 
Keep in mind, I said that under 
GOMESA, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, 
and Mississippi share in 37.5 percent of 
all the oil and gas royalties from the 
new leases, not the old leases. But the 
amount that we are entitled to receive 
is capped. 
To give you an idea of the money we 
are talking about, in 2019, the four Gulf 
producing States received about $350 
million in offshore oil and gas royal-
ties. Louisiana received $155 million of 
that $350 million. There is a formula 
that apportions the money between 
and among the four gulf-producing 
States. 
GOMESA caps, in a fairly com-
plicated formula, the amount the gulf- 
producing States can receive under 
GOMESA at $375 million. Our four 
States will hit that cap in 2024. It 
doesn’t matter how much drilling in-
creases in the Gulf of Mexico, the four 
gulf-producing States can only receive 
$375 million, split among themselves, 
until, I think, 2055. 
Other States not located on coast-
lines also have Federal lands on which 
oil and natural gas and coal and other 
minerals are produced. I am happy for 
them. They, as a result of congres-
sional legislation—by ‘‘they’’ I mean 
those other States, 24 of them—get 50

percent of the royalties of all the oil 
and gas and coal and other minerals 
produced from Federal lands in their 
States. The Feds get 50 percent; the 
States get 50 percent. 
I am happy for them. I couldn’t be 
more pleased for my sister States. I 
wish we got 50 percent—‘‘we’’ meaning 
the gulf-producing States. It seems un-
fair to me that we don’t. We only get 
37.5 percent on certain leases. Our sis-
ter States onshore get 50 percent of all 
leases. Their money isn’t capped; ours 
is. 
Let me talk about the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. As you 
know, this is a fund that was set up in 
1964. It had to be authorized every now 
and then. We made it permanent 2 
years ago—‘‘we’’ meaning, of course, 
Congress. The purpose of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund is to take 
money appropriated by Congress and 
put it into that fund and use it to buy 
land and water to make that land and 
water public so that all Americans can 
enjoy it. I am supportive of that. I 
think most of us are. 
The only money dedicated to the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund is 
that 12.5 percent I talked about dedi-
cated to the fund through GOMESA. 
The other moneys that have been put 
into the fund through the years, other 
than the GOMESA moneys, have had to 
be appropriated by Congress on a year- 
to-year basis. Once again, I am sup-
portive of the concept, and I am happy 
as a clam at high tide that my sister 
States out west get 50 percent. I just 
think it is unfair that we only get 37.5 
percent. 
As you know, we are going to con-
sider a bill next week called the Great 
American Outdoors Act. Here is what 
it would do. No. 1, it will set up a dedi-
cated automatic funding source for the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
That dedicated source is going to come 
from oil and gas royalties produced in 
the Gulf of Mexico. 
Remember, I told you that under 
GOMESA, 
the 
Federal 
Government 
automatically gets 50 percent of the 
royalties from the new leases. Hence-
forth, at least half of the 50 percent 
that is going into the Federal Treasury 
will now go into the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. That is No. 1—per-
manent source of funding for the fund. 
Some have argued that we are—I 
mean, we are not having to borrow this 
money, and that is a good thing. But 
this money didn’t fall from Heaven. It 
is coming out of the moneys the U.S. 
Treasury would receive otherwise from 
oil and gas production offshore. That 
means if the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund takes this money from the 
share that goes to the Federal Govern-
ment and uses it for the fund, some-
body else is going to get screwed be-
cause the money is going to be taken 
from somebody else and given to the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
also does something else. It sets up an-
other sort of separate fund that a good 
bit of the oil and gas money is going to 
flow into for deferred maintenance on 
public lands that we already own. Of 
course, we all support that. I do. A lot 
of our parks are falling apart. I mean, 
they have roads that have holes big 
enough for a Mack truck to fall 
through. They have a backlog of de-
ferred maintenance of $12 billion. And 
we are going to dedicate some money 
to try to chip away at that deferred 
maintenance. That is a good thing too. 
Here is what we end up with. We end 
up with a lot of our States getting 50 
percent of all of the oil and gas and 
coal produced in their State with no 
cap. Now these States that have na-
tional parks—again, I am happy for 
them; I love national parks—they are 
going to get an extra big slug of money 
from the Gulf of Mexico. In the mean-
time, the gulf-producing States—pri-
marily Louisiana, but also Texas, Ala-
bama, Mississippi—we are going to be 
stuck at 37.5 percent. It is capped. It is 
capped. It is capped at a weeny $375 
million a year from now until 2055. 
With inflation, by 2055, it will be worth 
about 7 bucks and 23 cents. 
That doesn’t seem fair to me. It espe-
cially doesn’t seem fair to me when 
you consider that basically the Gulf of 
Mexico is producing the money—actu-
ally, oil companies are. But how do the 
oil companies do that? They do it with 
Louisiana. Most of the leases and wells 
are off Louisiana’s coast. I am not put-
ting down Mississippi, Alabama, or 
Texas because there is drilling off their 
coast as well. But facts are facts. Most 
of the drilling is off Louisiana’s coast. 
A lot of the workers are from Lou-
isiana. 
Do you know what makes that drill-
ing possible? Louisiana tax dollars. We 
pay for the roads that support Port 
Fourchon, which is vital and located in 
my State for that oil and gas produc-
tion. We pay for the schools that edu-
cate the kids of the workers. We take 
all the risk. 
We know what happened with the BP 
oilspill. If there is another oilspill in 
the Gulf, it is Louisiana and Texas and 
Alabama and Mississippi that are going 
to get slammed. It is not going to be 
the inland States. That is where I said 
I am going to talk about fairness. 
Senator CASSIDY—and I don’t see 
speak for Senator CASSIDY. Under-
stand, he is my senior Senator. But he 
and I are working on a way to improve 
the Great American Outdoors Act. It is 
going to make it so much better. 
I am introducing a bill tomorrow, 
and I am going to offer an amendment 
to the Great American Outdoors Act— 
once again, I don’t speak for Senator 
CASSIDY, but I think he will support 
it—that is going to remove the cap on 
the amount of oil and gas royalties 
that the four gulf-producing States can 
receive under GOMESA. 
Let me say it again. Right now, no-
body else is capped. We are capped. The 
most that Louisiana, Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, and Texas can receive, split 
among ourselves, is $375 million. We 
are going to hit that cap in 2024, and it 
will remain until 2055. We all know 
with inflation it is not going to be 
worth $375 million in 2055. It is capped. 
All I am saying and all Senator CAS-
SIDY is saying, and I think—I don’t 
speak for them either, but my col-
leagues 
from 
the 
gulf-producing 
States—all we are saying is: Let’s be a 
little fair here. If you don’t have a cap 
onshore, let’s don’t have a cap offshore. 
My little old amendment would just re-
move that cap and make the Great 
American Outdoors Act even greater. 
Senator CASSIDY and I and other Sen-
ators from the gulf-producing States 
are also working on some other ideas 
that I don’t feel comfortable talking 
about today, but we have some other 
ways we think we can improve the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
I wanted to come here today and say, 
once again, I am not criticizing any of 
my sister States. I am happy as I can 
be for all the States that don’t have 
caps and that do get to share in 50 per-
cent of the royalties. I am just asking 
for a little fairness and equity, just a 
little bit for the gulf-producing States 
by allowing us to remove that cap. 
With that, I either yield the floor or 
I suggest the absence of a quorum, 
whichever the Parliamentarian tells 
me to do. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

PROTESTS 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, for the 
past week, our Nation has been en-
gulfed by protests in dozens of cities 
over the senseless murder of George 
Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands 
of police officers. Americans are angry, 
frustrated, and grieving, not just for 
Mr. Floyd’s and Ms. Taylor’s deaths 
but for centuries of injustice and bru-
tality against African Americans. The 
instances are too numerous to count. 
Yet these instances of violence keep 
happening while meaningful reforms 
have not taken place. 
The protests are set against the 
backdrop 
of 
the 
deadly 
novel 
coronavirus pandemic. As our country 
copes with this crisis, African-Amer-
ican communities have suffered dis-
proportionately 
high 
infection 
and 
death rates. Compounding this tragedy, 
we are in the midst of an economic 
downturn that rivals the Great Depres-
sion, with communities of color bear-
ing the brunt of the economic fallout. 
Millions of hard-working Americans 
have lost their jobs through no fault of 
their own. They are struggling to pro-
vide for their families, put food on 
their table, and keep a roof over their 
head.

June 3, 2020 
These protests are not isolated. They 
are taking place in every State in the 
Nation and in many other countries. 
Protesters are of every race and eth-
nicity and run the gamut in age from 
high school and college students to 
parents and grandparents. The people 
participating in these protests rep-
resent 
the 
diversity 
that 
is 
the 
strength of America. 
The overwhelming majority of these 
protests are emotional but nonviolent. 
They embrace a fundamental tenant of 
civil engagement, which is the Amer-
ican right and tradition of peacefully 
protesting to make their voices heard 
and to rectify injustice. 
On the fringes of these peaceful pro-
tests, there are opportunists who are 
sowing mistrust and division. Their 
primary goal is to loot and destroy 
property, that cause chaos that puts 
innocent lives in harm’s way. Let me 
state clearly, theft and looting are a 
crime. They are unacceptable and un-
dermine the powerful message of thou-
sands demanding justice and change. 
They offer an easy way out to those 
who would rather turn away from this 
challenge of justice and simply indulge 
in their own petty objectives of vio-
lence, diversion, and destruction. 
Our Nation is in pain. We need lead-
ers who bring calm, unity, empathy, 
and aid. Instead, our Nation has a 
President who treats it as a field of 
war. He does not even attempt to bring 
people together, to listen to others, or 
to accept the reality that leaders in a 
democracy are neither infallible nor 
omnipotent. 
In a tweet on May 30, President 
Trump said: 
Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis will 
never be mistaken for the late, great Doug-
las McArthur or great fighter General 
George Patton. . . . Get tough and fight. 
In a call with our Nation’s Gov-
ernors, Secretary of Defense Esper 
said: ‘‘I think the sooner that you mass 
and dominate the battlespace, the 
quicker this dissipates and we can get 
back to the right normal.’’ 
These are American city streets that 
we are talking about, filled with Amer-
icans exercising their rights, not bat-
tlefields filled with the enemy. 
Then, in a statement in the White 
House Rose Garden on June 1, Presi-
dent Trump said: ‘‘If a city or a state 
refuses to take the actions that are 
necessary to defend the life and prop-
erty of their residents, then I will de-
ploy the United States military and 
quickly solve the problem for them.’’ 
America learned shortly thereafter 
what actions the President was pre-
pared to take. The U.S. Park Police 
and others near Lafayette Park used 
tear gas, flash-bang grenades, and rub-
ber bullets to aggressively push back a 
peaceful crowd 30 minutes before the 
DC curfew went into effect. 
Why was this assault undertaken? It 
wasn’t to step inside St. John’s Church 
and offer a prayer for George Floyd, his 
family, or the countless other Ameri-
cans who have been victims of police 
brutality. It wasn’t to reflect on the 
pain and division that is rife within our 
country and contemplate what actions 
he could take to heal our Nation, like 
President Lincoln often did during the 
Civil War. The President crossed a 
street, aggressively cleared of peaceful 
protesters for a photo op that was 
meant to say he was strong, and he was 
in charge. Unfortunately, for him, it 
had the opposite effect. 
President Trump’s rhetoric and some 
of the events that have occurred are 
not ones that many of us ever thought 
we would see on American streets or 
hear from an American President. 
They are the words and actions that 
happen in authoritarian states, words 
and actions that past American Presi-
dents have condemned. They are words 
and actions that violate the demo-
cratic norms our Nation has stood for 
and American servicemembers have 
died for. 
While the President does have the au-
thority to call up military personnel 
under the Insurrection Act, it does not 
mean he should. It was last invoked in 
1992 when California Governor Pete 
Wilson requested Federal military as-
sistance from President George Herbert 
Walker Bush to respond to the L.A. 
riots following the acquittal of police 
officers for the beating of Rodney King. 
Before that instance, the act was in-
voked in the 1950s and 1960s to enforce 
civil rights laws and end segregation in 
the South. 
The Insurrection Act serves as an ex-
ception to posse comitatus and to the 
broad principle embedded deeply in 
American democracy and history that 
the Active Armed Forces should not be 
used to enforce State laws or to exer-
cise police power reserved to the States 
unless absolutely necessary as a last 
resort. The act is, by design and tradi-
tion, rarely invoked. 
The Insurrection Act envisions that, 
when Active military forces are used to 
supplement State police forces to en-
force State laws, they do so only at the 
request of the Governor or legislature, 
which is ultimately responsible for the 
execution of the laws within the 
States. In the present moment, I am 
not aware of any Governor or legisla-
ture calling for the Federal Govern-
ment to step in and take control. Put 
simply, if they need help, I have no 
doubt they will ask for it. 
The President’s ability to invoke the 
Insurrection Act without the Governor 
or State legislature requesting assist-
ance rests on the need to enforce or 
protect Federal law, which is not the 
case here. If President Trump were to 
invoke the Insurrection Act today, ab-
sent a request from a State, it would 
only be to further his own political in-
terests. He would be using Active mili-
tary forces as a political and propa-
ganda tool in contravention of every-
thing our military stands for. 
Using the Insurrection Act on a whim 
risks politicizing the military. The 
military’s mission is to defend and 
serve the Constitution and the Amer-
ican people regardless of who is in of-
fice. Bringing the military into domes-
tic politics risks a rupture in the sa-
cred trust between the civilian and 
military leadership and undermines 
fundamental American values. 
As former Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff GEN Martin Dempsey 
stated shortly after the 2016 Presi-
dential conventions, ‘‘If senior military 
leaders—active and retired—begin to 
self-identify as members or supporters 
of one party or another, then the inher-
ent tension built into our system of 
government 
between 
the 
executive 
branch and the legislative branch will 
bleed over into suspicion of military 
leaders by Congress and a further ero-
sion of civil-military relations.’’ 
Over the last few years, that erosion 
has increased steadily as recent events 
have made eminently clear. This ero-
sion is a toxic force that will under-
mine one of the most essential ethics 
of the American military. Soldiers, 
sailors, marines, airmen, and coast-
guardsmen serve the Constitution, not 
the President. That is the oath many 
of us took as young men and women. 
That is the oath that defines the mili-
tary of the United States, unlike many 
other countries, fortunately, for us. 
According to press reports, Secretary 
of Defense Esper told senior military 
leaders to ‘‘stay apolitical during these 
turbulent days,’’ but I would urge Sec-
retary Esper to heed his own advice. 
Traditionally, the Secretary of De-
fense, while a Cabinet member and ap-
pointed by the President, has taken a 
nonpolitical stand—staying away from 
campaign events and avoiding even the 
potential of a political photo op. As 
General 
Milley 
discovered 
Monday 
evening, once the civilian leader of the 
military joins the political fray, it is 
difficult for the military to stay neu-
tral. 
Our Nation is in crisis, but it is not 
a crisis that can or should be solved by 
American military force against its 
own citizens. I think, if you ask any 
young man or woman who took the 
oath to join the forces of the United 
States—whatever branch—was he or 
she doing it to go fight Americans, 
they would answer no. He or she is 
doing everything they can to protect 
Americans, to protect the system of 
government, and, ultimately, the Con-
stitution. That is the oath we take. 
The strength of this Nation and of 
the great American experiment in rep-
resentative democracy goes far beyond 
our military strength. It goes to our 
civil traditions, our Constitution, our 
sense of civic responsibility, and our 
ability to constantly evolve and im-
prove ourselves even from our earliest 
days stained with slavery. We need 
leaders who will listen and commit to 
change 
and 
then 
implement 
that 
change. We need leaders who will not 
exacerbate the problem but will seek 
to solve it and bring people together as 
our greatest Presidents have done 
throughout history. In short, we need 
leaders who are builders, not destroy-
ers, and until those leaders emerge, I

f 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
back in March, as the coronavirus pan-
demic began to grip our country, the 
Senate’s historic CARES Act set up the 
Paycheck Protection Program to help 
protect American workers from layoffs 
during the crisis. 
Thanks especially to its chief archi-
tects, Senator RUBIO and Senator COL-
LINS, the PPP has literally saved tens 
of millions of American jobs. Our col-
leagues’ bold policy has meant the 
mailboxes of working families in all 50 
States have continued to bring people 
their regular paychecks instead of pink 
slips. 
Through the end of May, this re-
markable program has delivered more 
than half a trillion dollars to keep 
American workers on payroll all across 
our country. 
One recent survey found that more 
than 
three-quarters—three-quarters— 
of all small business owners have ap-
plied for a PPP loan and more than 90 
percent of those applicants have re-
ceived one. 
The Senate has always committed to 
standing behind this popular program. 
Back in April when it ran low on funds, 
we worked together to add more re-
sources, and today we are passing an-
other piece of legislation that makes a 
few targeted changes to the program. 
To help workers and small businesses 
through these lengthy shutdowns that 
are just now beginning to ease, we are 
increasing the loan forgiveness period 
from 8 weeks to 6 months. 
Since keeping workers on payroll ob-
viously requires small businesses to 
stay afloat in the first place, we are ex-
panding firms’ ability to use these 
funds to meet obligations like their 
rent, their mortgage, or their utility 
bills, but we maintain the overall re-
quirement to avoid layoffs to keep the 
strong protection for workers in place. 
And we are providing payroll tax defer-
ral for the small businesses involved. 
This is a bipartisan bill that passed 
the House overwhelmingly. I am proud 
the Senate is sending it on to the 
President’s desk to become law. 
I want to thank Senator COLLINS and 
Senator RUBIO
once more for their 
leadership in authoring this historic 
program in the first place. They have 
kept right on with their essential lead-
ership, carefully monitoring the policy 
as it has taken effect. 
I know they have identified further 
technical fixes in addition to the issues 
we are addressing today, and I hope 
and anticipate the full Congress will 
look at addressing those as well in the 
future. 
I also want to thank Senator DAINES, 
Senator TILLIS, and Senator GARDNER 
for their hard work on these modifica-
tions. 
The Senate delivered for workers and 
small businesses when we first passed 
the CARES Act. We delivered again 
when we added more money to this 
popular program back in April, and we 
are delivering again today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is 
a very good day because very much 
needed improvements to the PPP pro-
gram will now pass the Senate as they 
passed the House, 417 to 1. The PPP 
program is desperately needed by small 
business, and it was not in the original 
proposal of our Republican friends or of 
the President. We worked very hard 
and pushed hard to get this done, and I 
want to salute Senators CARDIN and 
SHAHEEN for their efforts. 
The program was not at all perfect. 
When it first rolled out, too many of 
the big shots got money and not 
enough of the small businesses—the 
mom and pops, the butcher, baker, and 
candlestick 
maker. 
And 
nonprofits 
were not entitled. I pushed very hard 
to get nonprofits, including church-re-
lated nonprofits, religious-related non-
profits, in the bill. They can now ben-
efit from the bill just like the small 
businesses can. 
We Democrats said, there has to be 
some money set aside—not just to give 
more money in COVID 3.5—to the ex-
isting businesses that had connections 
with bankers but to the smaller busi-
nesses, and $125 billion was set aside. 
That was a very good thing. Now it has 
changed from a program that has gone 
mainly to those that had good connec-
tions to bankers that were well con-
nected to many smaller businesses as 
well. 
In the second round, States that real-
ly needed the help got a greater per-
centage of the help, like my State of 
New York. So this program has been 
one that Democrats have been, ini-
tially, very positive about and helped 
propose 
and 
write 
but 
constantly 
worked on improving to make it bet-
ter, better, and better. That improve-
ment 
continues 
today. 
The 
House 
Democrats put together a bill that 
would deal with the kinds of problems 
we continue to see. 
Eight weeks is running out soon. Yet 
small businesses may not get all the 
money—may not be able to use the 
money when the program runs out, and 
extending it to 24 weeks is vital. In 
many States, like mine in New York, 
only 25 percent of the money could go 
to OTPS expenses, other than per-
sonnel expenses. That wasn’t enough. A 
lot of businesses didn’t want to apply. 
This bill moves it up to 40. Our Re-
publican friends had resisted that. I am 
glad now they have seen the light. 
You will have the loan—if you go to 
convert your loans and get them for-
given, it will be 5 years that you have 
to pay back, not 2. Lots of small busi-
nesses said they couldn’t dare be able 
to pay them back in 2. These are 
among the most important changes in 
the bill, as well as some others. 
I am glad our Republican friends 
have relented and passed the bill here 
as we are about to close session for this 
week. It passed the House. We Demo-
crats have been pushing to get it done. 
For the last 3 days, there were some 
problems on the other side, and I am 
glad they have been worked out. I want 
to thank Senator JOHNSON. He had 
problems, but we talked on the phone 
repeatedly and worked those problems 
out with the help of Senator CARDIN. 
And this is an improvement that is 
much needed and comes at the last 
minute but not too late. So many busi-
nesses—8 weeks—will expire so soon, 
and now it is extended to 24 weeks. 
So I am glad this bill passes. I am 
glad we can do it by unanimous con-
sent. We Democrats are fully in sup-
port of this, every Democrat. We have 
no problems moving it forward. I know 
it will help a lot of small businesses. 
I yield the floor.

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
FLEXIBILITY ACT OF 2020 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 7010, which was received 
from the House. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 7010) to amend the Small Busi-
ness Act and the CARES Act to modify cer-
tain provisions related to the forgiveness of 
loans under the paycheck protection pro-
gram, to allow recipients of loan forgiveness 
under the paycheck protection program to 
defer payroll taxes, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
appreciate the good faith efforts of 
Senator JOHNSON
to make sure the 
terms of the program and its legisla-
tive intent are properly understood. In 
addition, I commend his leadership in 
looking at the program overall, and 
making 
suggestions 
about 
reforms 
should Congress determine that addi-
tional money is needed in the future 
for the program. The program was de-
signed intentionally to get money into 
the hands of small businesses quickly 
as government took the extraordinary 
and unprecedented step of shutting 
down the economy because of the pan-
demic. However, should we need to re-
plenish the fund, he is absolutely cor-
rect that we should ensure that money

flows to small businesses and enter-
prises that truly need it. I look forward 
to working with him and our col-
leagues on reforms to the program 
should Congress make the decision to 
extend it. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the letter I send to the desk 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
CONGRESSIONAL INTENT FOR H.R. 7010 
We, the undersigned Members of Congress, 
would like to clarify the congressional in-
tent for H.R. 7010, the Paycheck Protection 
Program Flexibility Act of 2020. The Pay-
check Protection Program (PPP) was au-
thorized by Congress under the CARES Act 
as a short-term solution to help businesses 
make ends meet and continue to pay their 
employees during the initial shocks of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Under the CARES Act, 
authorized funds for the program are set to 
expire on June 30, 2020, allowing for no new 
loans to be issued after this date. 
H.R. 7010 amends the CARES Act to pro-
vide businesses with greater flexibility for 
their use of PPP loans. Section 3(a) of H.R. 
7010 changes the definition of the ‘‘covered 
period’’ defined by section 1102(a) of the 
CARES Act to be from February 15, 2020 to 
December 31, 2020 instead of from February 
15, 2020 to June 30, 2020, as under current law. 
We wish to clarify the congressional intent 
of this extension of the covered period to De-
cember 31, 2020, and our expectations about 
how the amended program will operate. 
The CARES Act requires that PPP loans 
may only be spent on allowable uses during 
the covered period. In addition to the uses 
otherwise allowed by section 7(a) of the 
Small Business Act, the CARES Act author-
izes as allowable uses ‘‘payroll costs; costs 
related to the continuation of group health 
care benefits during periods of paid sick, 
medical, or family leave, and insurance pre-
miums; employee salaries, commissions, or 
similar compensations; payments of interest 
on any mortgage obligation (which shall not 
include any prepayment of or payment of 
principal on a mortgage obligation); rent (in-
cluding rent under a lease agreement); utili-
ties; and interest on any other debt obliga-
tions that were incurred before the covered 
period.’’ The intention of the extension of 
the covered period in H.R. 7010 is to allow 
borrowers who received PPP loans before 
June 30, 2020 to continue to make expendi-
tures for allowable uses until December 31, 
2020. The extension of the covered period 
does not authorize the Small Business Ad-
ministration (SBA) to issue any new PPP 
loans after June 30, 2020, as this date remains 
fixed by section 1102(b) of the CARES Act. 
The extension of the covered period defined 
in section 1102(a) of the CARES Act should 
not be construed so as to permit the SBA to 
continue accepting applications for loans 
after June 30, 2020. Our intent and under-
standing of the law is that, consistent with 
the CARES Act as amended by H.R. 7010, 
when the authorization of funds to guarantee 
new PPP loans expires on June 30, 2020, the 
SBA and participating lenders will stop ac-
cepting and approving applications for PPP 
loans, regardless of whether the commitment 
level enacted by the Paycheck Protection 
Program and Health Care Enhancement Act 
has been reached.

TRIBUTE TO PIA CORONA 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there 
are so many critical jobs that go on 
around the Capitol that may not al-
ways get the spotlight or appreciation 
they deserve. 
Today, I would like to mention one 
such amazing person, Pia Corona, or as 
she is affectionately known, Ms. Pia. 
You see, Pia is a teacher at the Sen-
ate Employees Childcare Center, a car-
ing, nurturing, and deeply special com-
ponent of the Senate community. 
Six years ago, on the 30th anniver-
sary of the center, then-Senator Tom 
Harkin described the teachers and ad-
ministrators at the center as, ‘‘some of 
the unsung heroes of the Senate.’’ 
I couldn’t agree more, and it is a 
privilege to pay special tribute today 
to one of those unsung heroes. 
This month marks Pia’s 25 year anni-
versary teaching at the center, a mon-
umental accomplishment that has al-
lowed her the opportunity to have a 
lasting impact on countless young 
lives. 
A number of children of my staff 
were fortunate to have Ms. Pia as a 
teacher and cannot say enough wonder-
ful things about her, so much so that 
they still keep in touch and bring their 
children by to visit years after leaving 
the center. Elle, Oliver and Leo, just 
three of many examples, still recognize 
Ms. Pia as an impactful figure in their 
early lives and in their education. 
Pia, a stalwart New York Yankees 
fan, started at the Senate Employees 
Childcare Center in May 1995, always 
working in the pre-kindergarten class 
to help children prepare for the big 
jump to elementary school kinder-
garten. Over the last two and half dec-
ades, she taught more than 400 chil-
dren, including many siblings. 
Ms. Pia has a unique understanding 
of how each child learns differently and 
loving ability to meet those individual 
needs at such a tender and formative 
age. Not surprisingly, she is described 
by her colleagues as a walking encyclo-
pedia of knowledge on child develop-
ment, and her classroom lessons and 
caring style reflect these incredible 
talents. 
One of her special field trips was a 
walk over to the late Senator John 
Glenn’s office when her students were 
studying space. A picture of this outing 
still hangs at the center. 
Pia also helped organize a visit to 
this very Senate floor for her class. 
They listened patiently as the Sec-
retary of the Senate gave her own pre- 
K version of School House Rock. It 
was, without a doubt, the most well-be-
haved gathering that the Senate floor 
has seen in years. 
Pia makes such an impression on 
children that many of her former stu-
dents still reach out to her, including 
one recent college graduate who want-
ed to say thank you all these years 
later. I know children of some of my 
staff have returned to the center to 
read to Ms. Pia’s students during 
storytime. 
As we struggle with the coronavirus 
pandemic, we have all been reminded 
once again of the critical importance 
of our teachers and schools. Ms. Pia’s 
students certainly knew that was the 
case from their time in her class. 
We all remember a teacher or two 
who made a lasting impact on our lives 
growing up—challenging us, inspiring 
us, nurturing us. Ms. Pia will surely be 
one that many remember as just such a 
special teacher. 
I congratulate Pia Corona on her no-
table anniversary and deeply meaning-
ful contribution to the Senate commu-
nity. Our country and our world need 
good news and kindness right now. 
Simply put, that is Ms. Pia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2692 
June 3, 2020 
CONGRESSIONAL POWER OF THE 
PURSE ACT 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the au-
thors of our Constitution purposefully 
built checks and balances into the 
foundation of our democracy, and the 
power of the purse is a critical part of 
those checks and balances. Article 1, 
section 9 of the Constitution states 
‘‘No Money shall be drawn from the 
Treasury, but in Consequence of Appro-
priations made by Law.’’ That means 
Congress, not the executive branch, is 
charged with making decisions about 
how to invest and spend Federal rev-
enue. As the vice chairman of the Ap-
propriations Committee, I take this re-
sponsibility very seriously. 
When Congress appropriates Federal 
dollars, we expect those dollars to be 
used as directed. We expect appropria-
tions laws to be upheld, and we expect 
the administration to be transparent in 
its actions. 
But for too many years, Presidents of 
both parties have encroached on the 
power of the purse as they have tried 
to expand their budgetary powers and, 
in some cases, substitute their judge-
ment for that of Congress. This has 
been acutely true under this adminis-
tration. No President has pushed the 
boundaries of and contorted appropria-
tions law more than President Trump. 
When Congress refused to give Presi-
dent Trump the money he requested for 
a wall on the southern border, he di-
rected his administration to sidestep 
Congress and take it from funding for 
our military and their families. He con-
tinues to do so to this day. 
The President wanted to pressure the 
Government of Ukraine into inves-
tigating his political rival, so he with-
held security money for Ukraine in vio-
lation of the Impoundment Control 
Act. An action that would eventually 
lead to his impeachment. 
Last year, the administration as-
serted to Congress that it had the 
power to propose rescissions in the last 
quarter of the fiscal year and further 
asserted it had the power to allow the 
funds to lapse if Congress did not act 
on its proposal, essentially claiming 
the executive branch, not Congress, 
had the last word on spending. The 
Government 
Accountability 
Office, 
GAO, thankfully and rightfully, dis-
agreed. Last year, this administration 
also overturned a long held precedent 
that the executive branch did not need 
to respond to findings by GAO of viola-
tions of the Anti-Deficiency Act. Fi-
nally, this administration has sup-
pressed OMB and executive branch 
agency cooperation with GAO in inves-
tigating the execution of appropriated 
funds. 
The push and pull over the power of 
the purse between Congress and the ex-
ecutive branch did not start with 
President Trump and will not end when 
he is no longer in office. Administra-
tions of both parties have clashed with 
Congress over this authority. But the 
actions of this President make clear 
that Congress needs to reassert itself 
and defend its constitutionally granted 
prerogatives. This should not be a par-
tisan issue. The Founders chose to vest 
the power of the purse with Congress. 
It is an important part of our system of 
checks and balances, and we must de-
fend it. 
That is why I am introducing the 
Congressional Power of the Purse Act. 
This bill will restore Congress’s central 
role in funding decisions, increase 
transparency in the executive branch, 
and add teeth to existing budget laws. 
The bill strengthens the Impound-
ment Control Act, including the addi-
tion of penalties for failure to comply. 
The bill strengthens administration re-
porting 
requirements 
and 
congres-
sional oversight tools, so Congress can 
better follow the money and ensure the 
law is being complied with. Finally, 
the bill reforms the National Emer-
gencies Act of 1974 to provide more 
Congressional control over these des-
ignations and how they are used. I hope 
all members can support it. 
I commend Representative LOWEY 
and Representative YARMUTH for intro-
ducing a similar bill in the House, and 
I hope that the House will send the bill 
to the Senate in July. 
I ask unanimous consent that the fol-
lowing members be listed as original 
cosponsors: 
Senators 
MURRAY, 
VAN 
HOLLEN, FEINSTEIN, COONS, BALDWIN, 
WYDEN, 
MERKLEY,

DEFENSE NOMINATIONS 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
after Monday’s shameful display by the 
Secretary of Defense, I voted against 
the President’s nominees to be Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy 
and Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities. 
The language of war has no place on 
American streets in the face of peace-
ful protests. Secretary Esper’s dan-
gerous comment that the military 
needs to ‘‘dominate the battlespace’’— 
referring to American cities—threat-
ened the lives of American citizens ex-
ercising their constitutional rights. His 
willingness to accompany the Presi-
dent to a photo-op after gassing peace-
ful protesters underscores the moral 
rot in the Department’s leadership. 
At this time, I have lost confidence 
that any nominee can be trusted to 
stand up to the President’s attempts to 
weaponize the Defense Department for 
his personal and political ends. For 
that reason, I voted against his nomi-
nees in the Department.

INTERNATIONAL 
DAY 
AGAINST 
HOMOPHOBIA, 
TRANSPHOBIA 
AND BIPHOBIA 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to mark the start of LGBT Pride 
Month with reflections on the recent 
International 
Day 
against 
Homophobia, 
Transphobia 
and 
Biphobia—IDAHOBIT. For more than 
50 years, Pride Month has been a re-
minder that, despite recent progress, 
every day, millions of people around 
the world face social stigmatization, 
legal prosecution, and even violence 
based on their sexual orientation or be-
cause of their gender identity. COVID– 
19 is necessitating adjustments to how 
this month is celebrated, with orga-
nizers moving large-scale parades from 
the streets of towns and cities to the 
internet, where a 24-hour online Global 
Pride celebration is planned for later 
this month. 
Two short weeks ago was the annual 
commemoration of the International 
Day against Homophobia, Transphobia

and Biphobia—IDAHOBIT. Started on 
May 17, 2004, IDAHOBIT was estab-
lished by LGBTQ activists in 2004 to 
commemorate the World Health Orga-
nization’s historic decision in 1990 to 
remove homosexuality from the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases. As 
in the United States, despite the 
progress we have made since 1990, 
around 
the 
world, 
homophobia, 
transphobia, and biphobia continue to 
flourish in many parts of the world. 
The theme of this year’s Inter-
national 
Day 
against 
Homophobia, 
Transphobia and Biphobia was ‘‘Break-
ing the Silence.’’ Millions of LGBTQ 
individuals around the world continue 
to be forced to hide their identities be-
cause of who they are or whom they 
love. They struggle to achieve the most 
basic of human rights, let alone respect 
and visibility. The International Les-
bian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex 
Association—ILGA—lists 70 countries 
in which same-sex activities are out-
lawed, and penalties range from 8 
years’ imprisonment to the death pen-
alty. Even in countries that do not 
criminalize homosexuality, many still 
have laws on the books that make liv-
ing openly next to impossible. Only 
five countries, of which the United 
States is not one, ban the damaging 
practice of conversion therapy. 
This type of discrimination has only 
been compounded by the global out-
break of COVID–19. In addition to the 
widespread health and economic hard-
ship that this pandemic is creating, it 
is producing new risks and forms of 
persecution for the LGBTQ commu-
nity. 
In Uganda, security forces stormed 
an LGBTQ shelter, binding the occu-
pants’ hands with rope before marching 
them to a nearby police station on 
charges of disobeying social distancing 
rules. In Latin America, transgender, 
nonbinary, 
and 
queer 
people 
who 
present as gender-nonconforming are 
being detained or fined for going to the 
grocery store on days designated by 
the government as ‘‘men-only’’ or 
‘‘women-only.’’ Hungarian Prime Min-
ister Viktor Orban has used the pan-
demic as an excuse to move legislation 
that will ban the legal recognition of 
transgender citizens. Meanwhile, in 
South Korea, there is a disturbing rise 
in online hate speech blaming the 
LGBTQ community for spreading the 
coronavirus. A number of religious 
leaders around the world have cruelly 
attributed the spread of COVID–19 to 
divine retribution for recognition of 
same-sex marriages. 
The COVID–19 pandemic will eventu-
ally fade, but the abuse of LGBTQ peo-
ple will continue unless we come to-
gether as a global community to put an 
end to it. Historically, the United 
States has been a strong international 
leader on issues of human rights like 
this one. However, the current admin-
istration’s neglect of LGBTQ rights, 
both at home and abroad, has hurt our 
credibility and diminished our power to 
make positive change. 
Within the United States, the Trump 
administration has issued rules sanc-
tioning employment, housing, medical, 
and other forms of discrimination 
based on gender identity. It has also re-
peatedly used religious liberty as a 
shield to enable discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation. On a global 
scale, 
the 
administration 
has 
at-
tempted to undermine internationally 
recognized definitions of human rights 
through the U.S. State Department’s 
Commission on Inalienable Rights and 
turned a blind eye to the persecution of 
LGBTQ people in other countries. It is 
said that you can measure the strength 
of a democracy by the rights it affords 
to marginalized communities, these ac-
tions do not reflect the strong democ-
racy that we strive to be. 
Looking at the state of the world 
today, it is clear that we need more 
champions for LGBTQ rights on the 
international stage. We need more 
leaders to break the silence and speak 
up for everyone’s right to live truly as 
themselves. This Pride Month, I am 
hopeful that the United States will 
once again be one of those voices. For 
my part, I will keep fighting to protect 
LGBTQ rights at home and around the 
globe, so that all people can pursue 
happiness and love without fear.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO ART STAVENS 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want 
to honor the service and dedication of 
one of North Dakota’s most dedicated 
volunteer firefighters. 
Art Stavens of Hatton, ND, became a 
member of the Hatton Volunteer Fire 
Department in 1951 and has served ever 
since. Art turned 95 on May 19 and was 
honored by his fellow firefighters and 
community residents with a surprise 
drive-by parade past his home. It ap-
propriately 
included 
several 
fire 
trucks. 
His time in the department has in-
cluded being the fire chief for 6 years 
and assistant fire chief for another 3 
years. When Art stopped responding to 
fire calls, he could be found standing 
on the highway directing vehicles to 
the location of a fire. 
Art still attends firefighter functions 
such as meetings and conventions, and 
he remains as dedicated as ever to the 
role of volunteers who step forward to 
protect their communities. 
Art Stavens may be the longest serv-
ing volunteer firefighter in the United 
States. On behalf of all North Dako-
tans, I thank him for his 69 years of 
service on the Hatton Volunteer Fire 
Department. I congratulate him on his 
95th birthday and wish him many more 
years of health and happiness.∑

comprised of the Voice of America, Radio 
Free Europe, Radio and TV Marti, Radio 
Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting 
Network; 
Whereas Michael Pack created and con-
trols both Public Media Lab, a nonprofit 
company, and Manifold Productions LLC, a 
for-profit company which he owns; 
Whereas, since the creation of Public 
Media Lab, Michael Pack transferred 100 per-
cent of the tax-exempt grants that Public 
Media Lab received to his for-profit com-
pany, Manifold Productions; 
Whereas, for several years, in documenta-
tion submitted to the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice that asked whether Public Media Lab had 
provided grants to any entity controlled by 
an officer of the nonprofit, Michael Pack re-
sponded ‘‘no’’ when the true answer was 
‘‘yes’’; 
Whereas, for several years, in documenta-
tion submitted to the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice that asked whether Public Media Lab 
conducted business with any entity with 
which it shared officers or directors, Michael 
Pack responded ‘‘no’’ when the true answer 
was ‘‘yes’’; 
Whereas, in 2019, when the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate raised the 
subject of the false statements that Michael 
Pack had made to the Internal Revenue 
Service, Mr. Pack claimed, in response to a 
question for the record, that the false state-
ments were ‘‘an oversight’’; 
Whereas Michael Pack has refused to cor-
rect the false statements that he made to 
the Internal Revenue Service; and 
Whereas, in early 2020, Michael Pack pro-
vided false information to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate with regard 
to his taxes; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) should provide advice and consent to ex-
ecutive branch nominees only if those nomi-
nees have been truthful in their dealings 
with Congress and the executive branch; 
(2) should not vote on any nominee who 
has made verifiably false statements to Con-
gress or the executive branch and who re-
fuses to correct those statements; and 
(3) should not vote on the nomination of 
Michael Pack to be Chief Executive Officer 
of the United States Agency for Global 
Media unless and until Michael Pack cor-
rects his false statements to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the 
Internal Revenue Service.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
605—PRO-
VIDING FOR SUFFICIENT TIME 
FOR LEGISLATION TO BE READ 
Mr. PAUL submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Rules and Administra-
tion: 
S. RES. 605 
Resolved, 
SECTION 1. TIME FOR READING OF LEGISLATION. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—It shall not be in order 
for the Senate to consider any bill, resolu-
tion, message, conference report, amend-
ment between the Houses, amendment, trea-
ty, or other measure or matter until 1 ses-
sion day has passed since introduction for 
every 20 pages included in the measure or 
matter in the usual form plus 1 session day 
for any number of remaining pages less than 
20 in the usual form. 
(b) POINT OF ORDER.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Any Senator may raise a 
point of order that consideration of any bill, 
resolution, 
message, 
conference 
report, 
amendment, treaty, or other measure or 
matter is not in order under subsection (a). 
A motion to table the point of order shall 
not be in order. 
(2) WAIVER.—Paragraph (1) may be waived 
or suspended only by an affirmative vote of 
three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and 
sworn. All motions to waive under this para-
graph shall be debatable collectively for not 
to exceed 3 hours equally divided between 
the Senator raising the point of order and 
the Senator moving to waive the point of 
order or their designees. A motion to waive 
the point of order shall not be amendable. 
(c) CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.—This reso-
lution is adopted pursuant to the power 
granted to each House of Congress to deter-
mine the Rules of its Proceedings in article 
I, section 5, clause 2 of the Constitution of

SENATE RESOLUTION 606—DESIG-
NATING MAY 5, 2020, AS THE 
‘‘NATIONAL DAY OF AWARENESS 
FOR MISSING AND MURDERED 
NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS’’ 
Mr. 
DAINES 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
TESTER, Mr. HOEVEN, Ms. WARREN, Mr. 
CRAMER, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. LANKFORD, 
Mr. UDALL, Mr. CRAPO, Ms. MCSALLY, 
Ms. MURKOWSKI, and Mr. RISCH) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 606 
Whereas, according to a study commis-
sioned by the Department of Justice, in some 
Tribal 
communities, 
American 
Indian 
women face murder rates that are more than 
10 times the national average murder rate; 
Whereas, according to the most recently 
available data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, in 2017, homicide 
was the sixth leading cause of death for 
American Indian and Alaska Native females 
between 1 and 44 years of age; 
Whereas little data exist on the number of 
missing American Indian and Alaska Native 
women in the United States; 
Whereas, on July 5, 2013, Hanna Harris, a 
member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, 
was reported missing by her family in Lame 
Deer, Montana; 
Whereas the body of Hanna Harris was 
found 5 days after she went missing; 
Whereas Hanna Harris was determined to 
have been raped and murdered, and the indi-
viduals accused of committing those crimes 
were convicted; 
Whereas the case of Hanna Harris is an ex-
ample of many similar cases; and 
Whereas Hanna Harris was born on May 5, 
1992: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 5, 2020, as the ‘‘National 
Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered 
Native Women and Girls’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
and interested groups— 
(A) to commemorate the lives of missing 
and murdered American Indian and Alaska 
Native women whose cases are documented 
and undocumented in public records and the 
media; and 
(B) to demonstrate solidarity with the 
families of victims in light of those trage-
dies. 
f 
NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT TO 
PROCEEDING 
I, Senator RON WYDEN, intend to ob-
ject to proceeding to S. 482, a bill to 
strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, to combat international 
cybercrime, and to impose additional 
sanctions with respect to the Russian 
Federation, and for other purposes, 
dated June 3, 2020 for the reasons as 
stated in the RECORD. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to give notice of my intent to ob-
ject to any unanimous consent agree-
ment regarding S. 482, the Defending 
American Security from Kremlin Ag-
gression Act. 
I want to first start by making my-
self clear: I support the vast majority 
of the provisions in this bill. It has now 
been over three years since Russia 
meddled in our last presidential elec-
tion, and Congress has yet to hold 
Vladimir Putin accountable for it. I 
commend the bill’s sponsors for coming 
together, on a bipartisan basis, with 
legislation that would take real steps 
to address Moscow’s aggression. 
Unfortunately, the bill is burdened 
by one extremely problematic, unre-
lated section, Title IV, or what was 
previously known as the International 
Cybercrime Prevention Act. This is 
now the fourth time my colleagues 
have 
attempted 
to 
jam 
that 
bill 
through this very chamber. In fact, the 
same exact language was first floated 
in 2015, only to be defeated. It was 
brought up again in 2016, and was, 
again, defeated. Once more, in 2018, 
this bill was introduced as a standalone 
bill and, again, defeated. 
The authors of this problematic leg-
islation are giving it one more try, this 
time by attempting to bury it within a 
largely unrelated 100-page, bipartisan 
legislative vehicle. And, by adding this 
language onto an extraneous foreign 
relations bill, my colleagues have been 
able to bypass the jurisdictional scru-
tiny of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee altogether. 
Title IV of the bill is, at best, an ex-
tremely misguided piece of legislation. 
While its proponents claim the lan-
guage is meant to fight botnets and 
other malicious cybercrime in a lim-
ited context, its effects would be far 
more broad-reaching. What this bill 
would do, in reality, is significantly ex-
pand the badly outdated Computer 
Fraud and Abuse Act, or the CFAA—a 
law that the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) has time and time again abused 
against cybersecurity researchers and 
activists, including the late Aaron 
Swartz. 
Mr. President, advocates and legal 
experts have long warned that the 
CFAA chills legitimate speech and re-
search. DOJ has adopted an interpreta-
tion of the CFAA so extreme that it 
has argued in federal court that it is il-
legal merely for someone to violate a 
website’s terms of service, such as by 
lying about their height, weight, or age 
in an online dating profile. While I 
take a back seat to no one when it 
comes to protecting Americans from 
hackers and improving our nation’s cy-
bersecurity, DOJ has stretched this 
Reagan-era hacking law to absurdity. 
The 
last 
time 
the 
International 
Cybercrime Prevention Act was pro-
posed in this chamber, I voted against 
it because I believed then, as I do now, 
that the draconian CFAA must be mod-
ernized. I have sought to reform the

CFAA, and rather than addressing its 
many serious flaws, Title IV of DASKA 
expands it, creating broad new prohibi-
tions and harsh penalties. 
Mr. President, I’ve said it before and 
I’ll say it again. The bill before us is a 
resoundingly good bill—but it is one 
that is held back by one small and un-
related section. My hope is that, work-
ing in a bipartisan way, we can resolve 
this glaring problem with DASKA. 
However, until that happens, I will ob-
ject to any unanimous consent request 
to proceed to the legislation.
