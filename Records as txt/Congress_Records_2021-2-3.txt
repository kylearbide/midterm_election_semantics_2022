PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, whose way is in the 
sea and whose paths are in the great 
waters, we lift up our prayers in mem-
ory of four men who faced the violent 
storm that overcame the USAT Dor-
chester and her crew 78 years ago today. 
Remind us of the example of these 
four chaplains, who, though distinctly 
different in their faith traditions, in 
the face of mortal peril, united in a 
higher purpose and gave up their own 
chance for survival to save the lives of 
their shipmates. 
As we reflect on the actions they 
took, offering life jackets and last 
rites, sharing words of hope and dispel-
ling fear, and as we honor today Officer 
Sicknick, in bravery in this very place, 
may we so dare to sacrifice everything 
in order to unify our efforts for the 
safety and well-being of our democracy 
and the welfare of its people. 
If we are inclined to doubt, steady 
our faith; if we are tempted, make us 
strong to resist; if we should miss the 
mark, give us courage to try again. 
Guide us with the light of Your truth. 
We pray trusting in the strength of 
Your name to answer our prayer. 
Amen.

gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER) come forward and lead

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

REMEMBERING ANTHONY 
GALLOPO 
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in memory of Anthony 
Gallopo—a dear friend, a wonderful, 
caring family man, a leader in Sussex 
County, and a tireless fighter for his 
fellow veterans—who recently passed 
from COVID–19 complications. 
A Navy veteran, Tony served as vice 
commander of the New Jersey Amer-
ican Legion and commander of Post 86 
in Newton. For more than 5 years, 
Tony and I worked together to deliver 
the care and services that our veterans 
deserve: securing the long-awaited goal 
of the community’s first VA outpatient 
clinic, boosting in-person psychiatric 
care at the clinic, and serving on our 
district’s service academy selection 
committee, all focused on improving 
access to care for those who fought for 
our great country and preparing the 
next generation. 
Tony lived a life of service that will 
truly never be forgotten. We are in-
debted to this selfless patriot, all of us 
in northern New Jersey and the coun-
try. 
As we mourn Tony’s loss, we think of 
his daughters, Sarah, Alexandra, and 
Ashley, and we pray for his beloved 
wife, Betsy, who remains in the hos-
pital. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in remembering my friend, 
Tony Gallopo. 
f 
OBSERVING NATIONAL GUN 
VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. EVANS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to observe National Gun Vio-
lence Survivors Week. 
During this pandemic, gun violence 
has increased in many communities, 
including my city of Philadelphia. We 
suffered 50 homicides last month alone. 
We must pass reforms like universal 
background checks and closing the 
Charleston loophole. The House acted 
in 2019, but the Senate did not. While 
these bills would not stop 100 percent 
of shootings, they would certainly save 
some lives. 
We must also help the victims and 
the survivors of this violence. Too 
often, they don’t know where to turn 
or what kinds of things or help are 
available. That is why Senator CASEY 
and I will soon reintroduce our Re-
sources for Victims of Gun Violence 
Act. 
In the last session, we had nearly 80 
cosponsors in the House. I invite you

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Con. 
Res. 11. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been roughly 1 
year since the first COVID–19 case was 
diagnosed in the United States. Since 
then, more than 26 million Americans 
have been infected, and more than 
440,000 have lost their lives. 
Millions of Americans remain out of 
work as families are pushed to the 
brink of devastation. Our economy 
faces lows unseen since the Great De-
pression. 
Food insecurity is climbing. Wide-
spread school closures threaten to de-
rail our children’s education. And our 
most vulnerable communities are being 
forced to bear the brunt of these twin 
crises as underlying health and eco-
nomic inequities grow worse. 
Congress has previously come to-
gether to pass relief packages, but 
COVID is getting worse, not better. Our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H289 
February 3, 2021 
recovery is painful and the most un-
equal on record. We are still deep in 
the trenches. We have to do more, a lot 
more. 
As chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, I promised that we would do 
everything our committee could do to 
support our recovery, which is why I 
introduced the 2021 budget resolution 
being considered today. This budget 
resolution was designed solely for one 
task: providing Congress with the op-
tion of using reconciliation to imple-
ment the American Rescue Plan and 
deliver the critical relief we need. 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan lays out an aggressive legislative 
package to change the direction of 
these crises, including a national vac-
cine program; testing and tracing, paid 
sick leave to stop the spread, an exten-
sion of lifeline unemployment benefits 
that are set to expire in March; direct 
financial support for families; and sup-
port so schools can operate safely. 
Our country desperately needs this 
relief, and economists across the ideo-
logical spectrum agree. Past crises 
have made it clear that doing too little 
will cost us far more. Weak support 
will lead to a weak, prolonged, and K- 
shaped recovery, posing more severe 
risks to our economic and budget out-
looks than any deficits we might incur. 
Without the American Rescue Plan, 
CBO estimates that it will take at 
least 3 years before employment re-
turns to prepandemic levels. But with 
this vital support, economists estimate 
that we can bring the economy back to 
near full employment in a little over 12 
months. 
We have the plan and the ability to 
do this. And, thankfully, we can also 
afford to do it. Interest rates and infla-
tion are at historic lows, lower today 
than even before the pandemic, and the 
return on smart investments in the 
economy has never been higher. 
Economists of all stripes are telling 
us, begging us, to use the fiscal space 
we have. They are warning that if we 
don’t go big, we will be responsible for 
a long, painful, and unequal recovery, 
one that will cost more lives and more 
jobs, that will cause more businesses to 
close and result in more damage to our 
Nation’s economy, both in the short- 
and long-term. 
The resolution’s budget reconcili-
ation framework sets a budgetary tar-
get of up to $1.9 trillion, the estimated 
cost of the American Rescue Plan, allo-
cated across the 12 committees that 
have jurisdiction over some portion of 
the plan. The resolution instructs 
these committees to report legislation 
consistent with these budgetary tar-
gets to the Budget Committee by Feb-
ruary 16. The Budget Committee will 
then combine the legislation and pre-
pare it for floor consideration. 
There will be plenty of opportunities 
for my colleagues across the aisle to 
engage in this process and offer amend-
ments, but we cannot afford to slow 
down our response to these urgent cri-
ses while Republicans decide if they 
want to help or not. 
The American Rescue Plan can be 
the difference between getting a vac-
cine or a virus, advancing to the next 
grade or falling behind, keeping the 
doors open or shutting down businesses 
for good. 
The choice is clear. I look forward to 
passing this resolution and ensuring 
Congress delivers the American Rescue 
Plan to the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the so-called budget be-
fore us ‘‘squanders the opportunity to 
start this new Congress working to-
gether to address the concerns and pri-
orities of the American people in a con-
structive and bipartisan manner.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, those are not my words. 
That is what was said at this very same 
moment in 2017 by my colleague across 
the aisle who is now chairman of this 
committee. You see, he found the very 
same process they are starting today 
to be so objectionable, so one-sided, so 
partisan, such an abuse of power, that 
he spoke in opposition for an hour to 
the very same thing the House Demo-
crats are doing now. 
The truth is, I look forward to the 
time my colleague on the other side 
and I can actually formalize our com-
mittee, welcome our members, orga-
nize, and develop an oversight plan for 
the new administration, but that has 
yet to happen. 
b 1315 
But here we are on the floor with a 
bill already; a so-called budget resolu-
tion; a resolution which, in reality, 
isn’t any sort of budget. It is simply a 
mechanism for the Democrat leaders to 
enact a radical agenda rejected by 
Americans this fall. They know it. It 
was rejected because their caucus is 
much smaller now today than it was 
before the election. 
So why are they doing this? 
While five different COVID stimulus 
packages were negotiated and ulti-
mately signed into law on a bipartisan 
basis over the last year, they appar-
ently now need a more one-sided ap-
proach, one which is much more par-
tisan and bends the rules to radicalize 
this Congress and the policies it pro-
duces. Quite the opposite of the speech 
we all heard from out in front of this 
building 2 weeks ago today. 
The power of our example, isn’t that 
what we were told? 
Well, what is the example here? 
That the unification, the bipartisan-
ship, and work-together attitude that 
the President called for were just 
empty words for the House majority. 
Though I suppose with this partisan 
process, 
our 
House 
Democrat 
col-
leagues are, in a sense, following the 
example of President Biden from his 
first days in office. 
President Biden has spent his first 
few days signing one executive order 
after another and pushing policies that 
will destroy American jobs, make our 
country less secure, and raise the cost 
of living for American families. I will 
just name a few: 
Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline 
directly eliminates an estimated 11,000 
jobs, including 8,000 union jobs. 
Enacting a 60-day moratorium on 
new mining, oil and gas leasing, and 
permitting on Federal lands will cause 
severe damage to America’s economy 
and energy independence, and will re-
sult in the loss of over 100,000 jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, 100,000 Americans are 
fired by the stroke of a pen. 
Returning the U.S. to the failed Paris 
Agreement of 2015 will reduce U.S. 
competitiveness in manufacturing and 
next-generation technologies, as indus-
tries move to China. 
Terminating a national emergency 
declaration which immediately stops 
all wall construction at the Southern 
border leaves American taxpayers with 
an incomplete government project and 
the loss of thousands of jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, thousands of Americans 
are, once again, fired, again, by the 
stroke of the President’s pen. That is a 
powerful example by the President of 
how to make life harder for the work-
ing class and to weaken America. 
Again, I come back to: Why is this 
happening today? 
I think the American people deserve 
to know, and the answer is simple: 
Democrats in Washington are setting 
up a partisan process to have the Vice 
President cast the decisive vote in the 
Senate on an array of radical policies. 
At worst, their plans are to try and 
use this pandemic to seize more gov-
ernment control of your life; to grow 
government 
power 
over 
your 
healthcare choices; to place new rules, 
mandates, and regulations on your 
small businesses; and to grant citizen-
ship to millions here illegally. 
At best, their plan is to actually 
award hundreds of billions of dollars to 
the very same State governments 
which are shutting down our schools, 
telling restaurants they can’t open, 
and keeping families locked inside. 
They want to bail out their political 
allies who are telling small businesses 
they can’t open, who are blocking 
Americans 
from 
going 
into 
their 
houses of worship, and who are ruining 
more families by the day. 
America is suffering right now, but 
they are suffering because of the 
choices, 
the 
mandates, 
and 
the 
lockdowns being put in place by gov-
ernment. We all know the quote from 
President Ronald Reagan: ‘‘The nine 
most terrifying words in the English 
language are: ‘I’m from the govern-
ment, and I’m here to help.’ ’’ 
Well, I think there are about 3,800 
more families who have loved ones in 
New York nursing homes, who would 
agree with that statement right now. 
Government harm has gone on long 
enough. It needs to stop, yet we are 
setting up a process today to give hun-
dreds of billions more to those very 
same State governments. The numbers

February 3, 2021 
don’t lie. Adding in the President’s $2 
trillion 
proposal 
from 
earlier 
this 
month, we will have spent $6 trillion in 
less than 1 year in so-called COVID–19- 
related stimulus. That is larger than 
the GDP of every country on Earth 
other than the U.S. and China. It is the 
equivalent of $17,000 per every Amer-
ican and $70,000 per household. 
Do families really feel like they have 
gotten $70,000 out of their government 
in the last year? 
No way. 
What is worse is we have now crossed 
over. Government policies are now 
making the crisis worse, resulting in 
millions of needless deaths. Suicide 
rates among adults and children are 
way up. The U.S. National Bureau of 
Economic Research, just this past 
month, said that, over the next 15 
years, more than 890,000 Americans 
could die as a direct result of the un-
employment caused by COVID-related 
lockdowns. 
Here was the headline in The New 
York Times last week: ‘‘Surge of Stu-
dent 
Suicides 
Pushes 
Las 
Vegas 
Schools to Reopen.’’ 
Lockdowns, mandates, closures, vir-
tual: It is unrealistic, not sustainable, 
and not the way. 
Under remote virtual learning, stu-
dents are not getting the instruction 
they need, especially those who may 
not have access to reliable broadband. 
Not to mention the mental health and 
emotional development needs that are 
not being met. 
If we want to support families and 
communities, let’s follow the science 
and let’s reopen our schools. Our coun-
try is about giving Americans the 
power of information and letting them 
decide what is best for their family and 
for their loved ones, not government 
telling them: Stay indoors; don’t see 
your family; and I am going to destroy 
your job, small business, and every-
thing you have spent your life building. 
So here we are, setting new precedent 
under the Democrat-controlled House. 
In more than 30 years, Congress has 
never voted on a House-originated 
budget that has not first gone through 
committee. 
For what? 
To bail out the very governments 
who are the ones costing families ev-
erything right now. 
Is this how the Democrats intend to 
govern: to put Government ahead of 
the people? 
I remind my friends that the power of 
the majority is a fleeting thing, and 
the American people are watching. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great in-
terest to the passionate words of the 
ranking member, and I failed to hear 
one instance in which he expressed con-
cern or any ideas about how to help the 
hundreds of thousands of Americans 
who will die if this government does 
not act quickly and aggressively; or 
the hundreds of thousands of busi-
nesses that will close; or the schools 
that he wants to reopen, which we all 
want to reopen. We are looking for 
ideas, but so far all we have had is re-
sistance and obstruction. 
The President this week actually met 
with 10 Republican United States Sen-
ators in an effort to get a bipartisan 
approach to the crisis we face. I would 
still hope that we can do that, but we 
can’t afford to wait for that to happen. 
That is why this process is in place, 
giving plenty of opportunity for the 
Republicans in both the House and 
Senate to participate and to help us 
find a better plan to move forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL), who is the chairman of the 
Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to ac-
knowledge Mr. YARMUTH here for the 
clarity and the speed with which he has 
proceeded. 
A reminder in support of this resolu-
tion here to the previous speaker, the 
gentleman from Missouri: this is the 
opening salvo in a process. This is not 
the conclusion. To talk to the Presi-
dent of the United States this morning 
without any incendiary rhetoric and no 
divisive tone, but for him to reiterate 
good suggestions will be entertained as 
good suggestions as the process goes 
forward. 
The COVID–19 crisis is far from over. 
Record numbers of deaths—look at the 
numbers in front of us, Mr. Speaker. 
What has happened? 
The number of people who are pro-
jected to die by the next quarter, 
500,000 Americans dead, 25 million in-
fected, 19 million Americans receiving 
unemployment insurance. 
And we are going too fast in this 
process? 
President Biden and his American 
rescue plan contains the kind of bold 
policies that we have sought to ad-
vance here for months. We understand 
that the economy will not recover 
without first crushing the virus. Mr. 
Speaker, we will not get the economy 
back up and running until we defeat 
the virus and restore safe working con-
ditions, as previously noted. 
This public health emergency re-
quires aggressive, science-based action, 
and it is going to take time. In addi-
tion to passing measures to eradicate 
the pandemic, we must ensure that 
families and jobless workers are able to 
afford life’s basic necessities, or, as we 
might say, liquidity and cash flow in 
the system. 
Accomplishing these goals requires 
us to go big. Economists left, right, 
and center have all said the same thing 
in this chorus: Go big. 
The Ways and Means Committee is 
ready to meet this challenge. We are 
going to beat this virus and we are 
going to put money into the hands and 
pockets of the people in America who 
really need it, extending unemploy-
ment assistance, combating child pov-
erty, supporting hard-hit families, the 
retention tax credit, and the earned in-
come tax credit. We are going to give 
some help to people in America who, 
again, really are in harm’s way. Pas-
sage of this resolution will provide us 
with an additional pathway to swiftly 
advance these priorities. 
By the way, as of this morning, 76 
percent of the American people agree 
with what we are doing. 
In times as desperate as these, we 
need to prepare our mechanisms so 
they are ready at our disposal to get 
the American people the relief they 
need. 
Mr. Speaker, for millions of lives and 
livelihoods that are at stake, I urge all 
of my colleagues today, regardless of 
their party, to support this critical 
measure. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts. I will remind him that the 
government there in his State has al-
ready received $7.5 billion in bailouts 
and, under this plan, would receive an 
additional 
$7 
billion. 
During 
the 
lockdown there in his State, more than 
2,500 small businesses have been closed 
and the death rate has been more than 
the top five in the Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from the great State of 
Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT), who under-
stands what it is like to run a small 
business and the burdens that govern-
ment places on them. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I have 
to hand it to my colleagues on the 
other side. In the infamous words of 
Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, 
they ‘‘never let a crisis go to waste.’’ 
When the unemployment rate is up 
and incomes are down, when the job 
openings are few but the food lines are 
many, when the American people need 
their Representatives to put aside par-
tisan politics, my colleagues on the 
other side put forth this boondoggle 
proposal. 
This partisan $1.9 trillion bill is being 
forced through Congress when more 
than $1 trillion from previously passed 
laws remain unspent. 
How about let’s get that $1 trillion 
out the door before we come back to 
the trough? 
Mr. Speaker, they can’t let this crisis 
go to waste, so they are going to force- 
feed leftist policies to the American 
people and do their best to disguise it 
as COVID relief. 
My constituents back home are ask-
ing me: How does killing more jobs by 
doubling the Federal minimum wage 
help reopen our economy? What do cli-
mate change policies have to do with 
stopping the spread of COVID? How 
does expanding ObamaCare help reopen 
our children’s schools? 
The answer is none of these policies 
have anything to do with stopping or 
addressing the China virus. They are 
unnecessary and radical. This budget is 
just Democrats doing what Democrats 
do, trying to score political wins on the 
backs of Americans in crisis. 
So we will vote on this bill, Demo-
crats will claim their political wins,

and America will go further into debt. 
But the real relief that Americans 
need, the relief of a job, an open school, 
and a thriving economy, will once 
again go unaddressed. 
I urge my colleagues to get real and 
scrap this pipe dream. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. 
b 1330 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I just 
wanted to respond to the notion that 
this is a radical plan. The radical, very 
radical chairman of the Council of Eco-
nomic 
Advisers 
under 
President 
Trump, Kevin Hassett, said: 
But I think we need to be risk-averse and 
pass another relief package. There are so 
many businesses treading water, barely 
hanging on. Now they are getting hit by an-
other shock. You could end up in a negative 
spiral for the economy. 
January 22, 2021, the radical Kevin 
Hassett. 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleas-
ure to yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA), 
the distinguished chairman of the Nat-
ural Resources Committee. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the budget resolu-
tion and reality that is before us today. 
This resolution provides relief to the 
American people that has been needed 
and required for over a year. 
I want to thank Speaker PELOSI, 
leader HOYER, whip CLYBURN and, of 
course, Chairman YARMUTH for the fine 
work he and his committee did in pre-
paring this resolution to respond to the 
urgency before the American people. 
As we have seen in the Natural Re-
sources Committee, the effects of the 
pandemic, COVID–19, have been dev-
astating to many populations across 
this country. It has particularly and 
severely impacted indigenous people 
and Tribes across this country dis-
proportionately, 
four 
times 
higher 
than the national average in people 
that have been infected, and the mor-
tality rate is reflected in the same 
way. 
This resolution provides $20 billion 
for Tribal Governments, $5.8 billion for 
Indian Health Service, $900 million to 
assist Tribal Governments to develop 
culturally and linguistically appro-
priate programs for their communities, 
and provides adequate and necessary 
funding to Indian Health Service and 
providing a level of equity to the ques-
tion of relief that has to be central in 
everything we do. 
In addition, at the recommendation 
of the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee, to ensure that we can deal with 
a pandemic in the making, the package 
contains funding for tools to limit dan-
gerous wildlife trade and monitor wild-
life-borne diseases at home and abroad. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I thank the 
chairman for the time and his hard 
work. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CLINE), who proudly 
represents their Sixth District, a won-
derful new addition to the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
agree with the gentleman. Our families 
are hurting. Our farmers are suffering, 
and our small businesses are failing 
from the shutdown policies of Demo-
crat governors like mine in Virginia. 
They need our support as we manage 
through this pandemic. 
But what they don’t need is a $1.9 
trillion package packed full of Demo-
crat wish list items that will cripple 
our economy, including a minimum 
wage increase that would destroy 1.3 
million jobs, according to the CBO, and 
hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars 
to bail out poorly run State govern-
ments. 
Mr. Speaker, 1 month ago the last 
COVID relief bill, nearly $1 trillion, 
was signed into law and, together with 
previously enacted stimulus laws, over 
$1 trillion remains unspent. In fact, the 
CBO, just this week, announced that 
they project our economy to bounce 
back over the next several months, 
without trillions of dollars in addi-
tional stimulus aid from Congress, and 
that much of our recovery hinges on 
the removal of these shutdown require-
ments and the pace of vaccinations. 
That is where our focus should be, en-
suring that those who want to be vac-
cinated receive it, and ensuring that 
we reopen our businesses and schools 
as soon as possible. 
As a new member of the Budget Com-
mittee—or I hope to be a new member 
of the Budget Committee; we haven’t 
even organized yet for this Congress—I 
am outraged by the slipshod way this 
resolution is being rammed through 
the House. It is like being a member of 
the Judiciary Committee and having 
impeachment rushed directly to the 
floor without hearings. Whoops, did 
that. 
I see the chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee still here. I don’t 
know that he would like it so much if 
we had tax bills that came directly to 
the floor without going through Ways 
and Means. 
What is next, a farm bill that doesn’t 
go 
through 
the 
Agriculture 
Com-
mittee? A transportation bill that 
doesn’t go through the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee? 
You know, the circus being run by 
House leadership gives a bad name to 
circuses everywhere. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to yield 21⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS), the distinguished chairman of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this COVID supplemental 
package. This has been a dark and dif-
ficult past year for our world. More 
than 2 million people have died around 
the world, including more than 400,000 
in our great country. Economies are in 
crisis around the globe, and over a bil-
lion children are out of the classroom. 
Our country’s health and economic 
challenges require a bold response in 
scale, and more delay is not an option. 
We must work to beat back this virus, 
shore up our economy, and ensure the 
most vulnerable are prioritized and 
protected. 
But we cannot solve this problem 
without addressing the outside world 
also. Pandemics do not respect borders, 
and they don’t care about nationali-
ties. 
As chair of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, I firmly believe that the health 
and economic wreckage caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic will only end once 
it ends everywhere. We are currently 
addressing the monumental task of 
vaccinating our country, but after-
wards we must turn our attention to 
the remainder of the world. Only then 
can we fully put this worldwide pan-
demic behind us and put ourselves back 
on the path to economic prosperity. 
Crucially, this package includes sup-
port for global health efforts as well as 
lifesaving 
humanitarian 
assistance. 
This means support for vaccine pro-
curement, vaccine delivery, and sus-
tained engagement to build the capac-
ity of health systems throughout mul-
tilateral engagement. It means sup-
porting organizations like the World 
Food Program, UNICEF, and the WHO, 
that the United States must partner 
with in order to succeed. 
COVID–19 did not begin on our 
shores, but American innovation and 
global health leadership can end it. The 
cameras of history are rolling. The 
time to act is now. 
We must join with what Chairman 
YARMUTH is doing and make sure that 
we help those who have suffered as a 
result of this pandemic. Extending un-
employment insurance, helping those 
who can’t pay for their rent or mort-
gage, putting our children back into 
schools, helping our small businesses; 
this is what this bill does. This is why 
we have to do it, and we have to do it 
now because this is the emergency of 
our time and it takes bold moves. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from New 
York. I will remind him that his State 
government has already received $28.5 
billion in bail-out money and, under 
this proposal, would receive $20.5 bil-
lion under the plan; while that very 
same government has enacted some of 
the strongest lockdown policies in the 
Nation, resulting in the closure of 
more than 6,500 small businesses in the 
State of New York, with an unemploy-
ment rate currently at 8.2 percent. And 
the State of New York also has the sec-
ond highest COVID-related deaths per 
capita in the Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE), 
an 
entrepreneur 
from 
California, a leader in his State legisla-
ture on budgetary issues, and a new 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, the 
House Budget Committee was con-
stituted in 1974, and since then, not a 
single budget resolution has passed out 
of this Chamber without hearings and 
reasoned debate, until today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H292 
February 3, 2021 
Should H. Con. Res. 11 pass, it will be 
the first budget resolution in almost 50 
years to pass this Chamber without a 
single hearing, without a single vote, 
without a single witness. We are being 
told that the reason for this is the need 
for quick action in response to addi-
tional stimulus and relief for the 
coronavirus crisis. 
But Mr. Speaker, I have read this res-
olution. It is 55 pages. I can’t find a 
single item in this resolution related to 
the coronavirus crisis. 
Now we are being told that might be 
true. You see, this is just a shell that 
we pass this to the Senate, which trig-
gers a lengthy and complex process of 
budget reconciliation. 
But, Mr. Speaker, if our intent is to 
pass quick relief, and I think it should 
be, we could do that today. This Cham-
ber has passed in the last 12 months al-
most $4 trillion of relief. Mr. Speaker, 
of that, over 25 percent, over $1 tril-
lion, remains unspent. We could fix 
that today. We could fix that now, in-
stead of relying on this lengthy and 
complex process of budget reconcili-
ation. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a serious topic. 
It deserves serious consideration, and 
not the violation of almost 50 years of 
protocol and procedure in this Cham-
ber. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I wel-
come the gentleman from California to 
both Congress and the Budget Com-
mittee and I look forward to working 
with him. I will advise him that in just 
a few weeks he will have the oppor-
tunity, as a member of the Budget 
Committee, to go through a markup, 
offer amendments to the plans that 
will be proposed in another budget res-
olution that will actually come to the 
floor. So I look forward to that discus-
sion and hope that will satisfy the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to 
the distinguished gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO), the chair of the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I know Mr. OBERNOLTE is a new mem-
ber of the committee; he might even be 
brand new to the House. But he said he 
couldn’t find a single thing in this 
package that related to COVID? 
Oh, well there is $110 billion for vac-
cines, for testing, which has been pa-
thetic under the Trump administration 
with no help. Oh, and personal protec-
tive equipment, but I guess those 
things don’t have anything to do with 
COVID and the pandemic. 
Now, let’s get real here. The first 
gentleman spoke and said, We want to 
help schools, and this bill doesn’t help 
schools. 
Well, actually, yesterday they tried 
to cut our funding for schools. We are 
putting in $170 billion to reopen the 
schools. It is going to be very expen-
sive, new HVAC systems, a whole 
bunch of new furniture, all sorts of 
stuff to get kids safely to school for 
this and future pandemics, to be ready, 
to prepare. And they wanted to cut our 
170 to $54 billion. But they are for 
schools and we are not. 
Oh, by the way, they didn’t do any-
thing for childcare assistance which is 
a huge problem for people during this 
pandemic. 
Now, let’s talk about a few things 
that are in here: Cash payments prom-
ised by President Biden and the two 
people who helped us flip the Senate, 
they are in here. 
Extended unemployment, if we don’t 
do that—you don’t want to do it—20 
million Americans will have no income 
and no job on March 14; 100,000 people 
in my State. 
Assistance 
for 
small 
businesses. 
Food, well, I think that is pretty crit-
ical stuff on a day-to-day basis. 
Rental assistance, and that is some-
thing else the Trump political hack 
running OSHA wouldn’t do. 
We are going to have standards for 
protection of workers. We have had 
huge outbreaks in meatpacking plants 
and 
in 
transportation—people 
have 
died—and 
everywhere 
else 
because 
there are no Federal standards to pro-
tect workers. We are taking care of 
that in this bill and with some funding. 
And they say this is unprecedented. 
You used reconciliation for $3 trillion 
of tax cuts for the wealthiest among us 
and the biggest corporations in the 
world, to drill for oil in the Alaska Na-
tional Wildlife Refuges, and then you 
used it again to try and take away 
healthcare from tens of millions of 
Americans and their protection for pre-
existing conditions and other things. 
Yeah, unprecedented. Malarkey. Let’s 
talk about the issues and cut the BS. 
b 1345 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond 
to the gentleman from Oregon saying 
that this is unprecedented. What is un-
precedented is that this is the first 
time that a budget resolution that 
originated in the House bypassed the 
Budget Committee. 
Reconciliation has been used numer-
ous times, but this is the first time in 
the history of this country that the 
Democrats bypassed the Budget Com-
mittee in a budget resolution that 
originated in the House. The people are 
watching, Mr. Speaker. 
I also appreciate the gentleman from 
Oregon. I will remind him that his 
State government has already received 
$4.5 billion in bailouts, and they will 
receive another $4.5 billion in bailouts 
while their State has locked down 
small businesses, costing more than 
1,000 small businesses to close their 
doors. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), 
a true defender of commonsense, con-
servative values and a good friend. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition to the 
budget resolution. 
The American people have suffered. 
They have suffered greatly from this 
pandemic, and this body has taken ac-
tion to support those efforts. 
It should be noted that Republicans 
have voiced support for targeting relief 
where it is needed. Mr. Speaker, we get 
it. We know there are still needs out 
there. We know there are still people 
hurting. We understand that, and we 
agree that we need to have targeted re-
lief. 
Thus far, Congress has passed nearly 
$4 trillion in COVID relief funding on 
everything from the PPP program to 
direct payments to money for testing 
and for vaccinations. 
However, a significant amount of 
funding has yet to be utilized, with 
more than $1 trillion of available re-
sources waiting on the sideline to be 
spent. Of that $1 trillion, there is $280 
billion left in the PPP program, $239 
billion in health spending, $172 billion 
in unemployment insurance assistance, 
and $58 billion in State and local aid, 
to name a few areas with leftover fund-
ing. 
Now, we are discussing ramming 
through this budget resolution so that 
the Democrats can pass a $1.9 trillion 
COVID package without any bipartisan 
input or work. After weeks of talk of 
increasing bipartisanship and working 
together on big issues for our country, 
this resolution runs contrary to that. 
Not only does it do our budget process 
a disservice, but it moves forward with 
the idea that the bipartisan consensus 
of Congress should be cast aside. 
As I said earlier, there is more than 
$1 trillion that has been passed in 
COVID relief that is just sitting there 
unused. Unfortunately, this budget res-
olution doesn’t address that point or 
build upon that point. 
For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to oppose this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JOHNSON), the distinguished 
chair of the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
when the COVID–19 crisis hit, the Na-
tional Science Foundation rose to meet 
the challenge. The agency has already 
invested $200 million in research to un-
derstand the coronavirus, understand 
and model how the virus spreads, and 
enable approaches that lessen the harm 
of COVID–19 to public health, society, 
and the economy. 
The additional funding provided for 
in this budget resolution will enable 
our Nation’s best and brightest re-
searchers 
to 
continue 
to 
help 
us 
through this crisis and will contribute 
to better preparedness for the next one. 
Similarly, the National Institute of 
Standards 
and 
Technology 
reacted 
quickly as the pandemic unfolded, ask-
ing Manufacturing USA institutes to 
submit their best proposals for rapid, 
high-impact projects to help with the 
crisis. Several institutes had already 
redirected their efforts, but more fund-
ing was needed.

February 3, 2021 
Congress provided $10 billion in the 
Cares Act. The additional funding pro-
vided for in this resolution will support 
important manufacturing innovations 
across a range of needs, including 
therapeutics, accelerating production 
of critical supplies, and ensuring sup-
ply chains for the pandemic response. 
The Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee, which I chair, held numer-
ous 
hearings, 
briefings, 
and 
roundtables last year to discuss the 
role of the National Science Founda-
tion, NIST, and other science agencies 
in helping the Nation through this pan-
demic. $750 million represents just a 
fraction of what is needed, including to 
recover all the science and, more im-
portantly, the talent that is hem-
orrhaging from the STEM pipeline as a 
result of this crisis. I will continue to 
push for such funding as part of the 
stimulus discussions. 
Finally, while I do support the entire 
package, I want to lend my voice in 
particular to the support of vaccina-
tions and immunizations, another topic 
my committee has spent considerable 
time on. We will not begin to move be-
yond this crisis until we have wide-
spread immunization and vaccination. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentlewoman from 
Texas. I will remind her, as we debate 
how to improve the economy, the ad-
ministration’s hostility to the energy 
industry, as demonstrated by his exec-
utive orders, threatens at least 120,000 
jobs in the State of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA). 
As a freshman, he has already shown 
leadership as a true defender of con-
servative principles. 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the H. Con. Res. 
11, which paves the way for our na-
tional deficit to increase by $2.1 tril-
lion. 
Our current debt is $28 trillion. Let’s 
put that in perspective. This budget 
that we are looking at here will never 
balance. It will push our national debt 
to $41 trillion by the end of its forecast. 
Let me say that again: $41 trillion by 
the end of its forecast. 
This out-of-control spending is jeop-
ardizing the very future of Social Secu-
rity and Medicare. Every senior should 
be deeply concerned about the possi-
bility of losing Social Security based 
on this out-of-control spending by the 
Democrats. 
Currently, our country pays about 2 
percent on the debt that we have. It 
will not stay at 2 percent because 2 per-
cent is currently low. If our interest 
rate increases, we are going to struggle 
to try to fund our discretionary pro-
grams like defense and infrastructure 
because the money will go toward in-
terest. This is dangerous, fiscally irre-
sponsible, and reprehensible. 
Just like a business or a family, 
when the credit card bill comes due and 
there is not enough money, you have to 
cut. The Democrats have put our Na-
tion in a perilous situation with this 
out-of-control spending. 
We must take our growing national 
debt crisis seriously and not look at 
this laundry list of progressive ideas 
put forth by the Democrats. 
We are saddling our children and 
their grandchildren with this debt, fo-
cusing on the politics of today, and not 
worrying about our Nation’s future. 
This budget must be stopped. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, I welcome 
the gentleman from Iowa to the House 
of Representatives, and I will correct 
him. 
There is no 10-year budget outlook in 
this budget. This is a single budget res-
olution, only for this fiscal year, de-
signed to facilitate the use of the rec-
onciliation package to implement the 
President’s 
American 
Rescue 
Plan, 
which, by the way, he campaigned vig-
orously on throughout his campaign. 
While Republicans were saying, ‘‘Oh, 
it is too early to do something. Let’s 
pause. Let’s wait. Let’s do this,’’ the 
President was aggressive. The Presi-
dent was creative, forceful, and the 
American people rewarded him with a 
victory. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
BRENDAN
F. BOYLE), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, I was struck about 
15 minutes ago when one of the speak-
ers on the other side made the claim 
that the Democratic agenda was re-
jected by the American people in No-
vember. It was so rejected, Democrats 
won the House, the Senate, and the 
White House for the first time in a 
dozen years. That is rejection I can 
take. 
The reality is, the American people 
put us in charge because the previous 
administration’s response to COVID 
was so weak and so ineffective. 
It is a sad fact that more than 400,000 
Americans have died from COVID. This 
is now one of the four most deadly 
events in American history. We have 20 
percent of the COVID deaths and 20 
percent of the COVID cases worldwide. 
To deal with the enormity of the cri-
sis, we need a big, bold plan, such as 
the Biden 1.9 plan. 
Mr. Speaker, economists are famous 
for not agreeing. Because economists 
were so famous for saying, ‘‘Well, on 
the one hand, or on the other hand,’’ 
Harry Truman, when asked, said the 
one thing he wanted was a one-handed 
economist. So it is striking that econo-
mists all across the ideological spec-
trum—liberal, centrist, conservative— 
all favor going big in this moment. 
That is what this plan does. 
I am also struck by the fact that 
there must be a Democrat in the White 
House because the other side is sud-
denly talking about the deficit and the 
debt again. When there is a Republican 
in the White House, it is not a big con-
cern. 
Again, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
economists 
agree: This is not a moment that we 
should be concerned about the deficit 
and the debt. This is a moment when, 
once and for all, we need to finally 
tackle this pandemic. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania. I will remind him that his 
State government has already received 
$14 billion in bailouts. They will re-
ceive another $13.5 under this plan 
while that very same State govern-
ment has enacted lockdown policies, 
causing the closure of more than 3,000 
of their small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. DONALDS), 
a great addition to the Budget Com-
mittee and a true leader. 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, as I 
walked onto the House floor today, I 
heard the talk from the other side, 
talking about wanting to share in good 
ideas. But what is interesting is, as 
this budget resolution has come forth, 
there has been no sharing of ideas. 
We have seen a general framework 
coming from the Biden administration 
calling for $1.9 trillion, but that com-
pletely flies in the face of the fact that 
there is $1 trillion that this very body, 
the last Congress, appropriated last 
year that is still unspent. That money 
has not gone out the door. Yet, we are 
talking about solutions to help our 
country through COVID–19. 
Now, my career before politics was 
actually in finance and economics. I 
spent 17 years in that field. If you are 
going to talk about stimulating an 
economy, the first thing you want to 
do is actually study the current state 
of your economy. One of the metrics we 
always like to use in financial services 
is the unemployment rate. It is a pret-
ty popular statistic. 
Let’s take a look at the unemploy-
ment rates going on around the coun-
try. In my State of Florida, it is 6.1 
percent. In Alabama, it is 3.9 percent. 
In South Carolina, it is 4.6 percent. In 
Texas, it is 7.2 percent. 
b 1400 
Compare that to blue States in our 
country, New York and California, 
where they soar over 8 percent. 
Why is that happening? 
Because their governors and their 
mayors have refused to reopen their 
economies. 
If you want to stimulate something, 
actually let the American people get 
back to work. Let them run their busi-
nesses, and you would be surprised at 
what actually would happen in our 
economy. 
Let’s talk about the $15 minimum 
wage, which is in the Biden plan. I 
don’t know how a $15 minimum wage is 
going to help struggling small busi-
nesses continue to thrive in the cur-
rent environment. Furthermore, what 
we have already seen with the $15 min-
imum wage is that it has led to work-
ers actually getting less hours, less 
hours at the jobs that they have. I 
don’t see how that is actually helping 
anybody stimulate an economy.

February 3, 2021 
Let’s talk about education. In this 
plan, right now there is $170 billion, 
give or take, to go to local school dis-
tricts to reopen. 
But guess what? If they are picketing 
outside of the school district’s school 
board in Chicago to not go back into 
the classroom, what is this additional 
money actually doing? 
In Florida, we have been open in our 
schools. We have done this. There are 
tens of billions of dollars already avail-
able to help school districts reopen. All 
they need is leadership. They don’t 
need more money. 
The last thing I want to add is with 
respect to State and local govern-
ments. Every State government and 
every local government either gets 
their money from income taxes, sales 
taxes; like in the great State of Flor-
ida, property taxes on the local level. 
This is typically how you get your rev-
enue. If you want to help State and 
local governments take care of their 
revenue problems, they should open up. 
They should not come back to this 
Capitol and get money. 
Why should Florida pay for New 
York? 
Except for the fact that the only 
thing New York has done is help the 
real estate markets in Florida because 
New Yorkers are fleeing New York to 
come to the great State of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear. This 
budget resolution is not about econom-
ics. It is not about COVID–19. It is not 
about helping our schools reopen. This 
budget resolution is purely politics. It 
is an opportunity to push through an 
agenda through budget reconciliation 
where, if you actually studied our 
economy and studied the fact that now 
close to 40 million Americans have 
been vaccinated with the vaccine from 
the previous administration, we are on 
track to getting reopened. We should 
study this. We should be more tar-
geted. We should not be putting for-
ward a massive spending bill where no 
study has ever been given. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, once 
again, I welcome the gentleman from 
Florida to the House of Representa-
tives. I really think that we ought to 
stop talking about States bailing other 
States out. The next time that a major 
hurricane hits Florida, we are not 
going to say that New York and Cali-
fornia don’t want to help them. That is 
not the kind of body that I hope we are. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT), the distinguished chairman of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of the budget resolu-
tion. The COVID–19 pandemic is con-
tinuing to inflict widespread harm 
across our communities. In addition to 
the thousands of people who are dying 
every day from this virus, millions of 
workers remain unemployed, students 
are falling further behind, and an un-
precedented number of American fami-
lies are facing hunger and homeless-
ness. Anyone who doubts the need for 
urgent and immediate COVID–19 relief 
is not paying attention to the multiple 
ongoing crises affecting people across 
the country. 
We will continue working with our 
Republican colleagues to find areas of 
agreement so that we can provide our 
constituents with the support they des-
perately need, but we can’t put the 
label of bipartisanship ahead of the ur-
gent needs of our communities. Our 
constituents don’t want us to say that 
we could have provided relief checks in 
the amount of $1,400, but we needed to 
work with the Republicans, and now 
they are only $1,000. 
The upcoming COVID–19 rescue pack-
age must extend assistance for the un-
employed Americans, protect all work-
ers from COVID–19 infections, and sup-
port frontline workers who have cared 
for our loved ones and kept food on the 
table during the pandemic. 
The rescue package must also pro-
vide schools the necessary resources to 
open safely, to help institutions of 
higher education cope with severe fi-
nancial strain, and to keep childcare 
providers afloat. We must also expand 
nutrition assistance to ensure that our 
children and families do not go hungry. 
Finally, the COVID–19 rescue pack-
age must help close the massive State 
and local budget shortfalls, which will 
inevitably force painful cuts to edu-
cation and other public services if left 
unaddressed. 
Mr. Speaker, we are at a critical mo-
ment in the fight against COVID–19. 
We have the responsibility to do every-
thing in our power to meet the basic 
needs of the American people. This 
budget resolution gives Congress an ad-
ditional tool to pass a COVID rescue 
package that will confront the pan-
demic and deliver the immediate relief 
that our constituents deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the resolution. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from Vir-
ginia. I will remind him that his State 
government has already received $6.5 
billion in bailout money, and they will 
receive another $9 billion under this 
plan while that very same government 
has enacted lockdown policies directly 
leading to the closure of more than 
2,000 small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from the great Common-
wealth of Virginia (Mr. GOOD), who al-
ready is a leader in this conference. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 11, 
the House Democrat budget for fiscal 
year 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, in response to a pre-
vious speaker, it is always time to talk 
about the deficit. Our national debt has 
already climbed to $28 trillion, rep-
resenting about $85,000 per American 
citizen. This is over $200,000 per Amer-
ican family or household. 
How can we ever hope to repay that? 
The spending on our interest pay-
ments alone on this debt, even with the 
current artificially low interest rates, 
amounts to about 8 percent of our an-
nual budget as recently as fiscal year 
’19. It is projected to rise to 26 percent 
of our budget over the next 30 years or 
by fiscal year ‘50. 
This path of fiscal insanity is simply 
not sustainable. Without our currently 
artificial rates, we simply couldn’t 
even afford to pay our existing debt 
right now. Our national debt and cur-
rent fiscal situation truly represents 
one of the greatest threats to our coun-
try. The science, as we like to say, or 
more specifically the math, confirms 
this reality because a day of reckoning 
is coming. 
We are the first generation to ever 
leave a legacy of debt to our children 
and grandchildren. The Greatest Gen-
eration, the World War II generation, 
who also faced down the Great Depres-
sion crisis, didn’t even do this to us. 
So where do we find ourselves today? 
We are contemplating a $2 trillion 
spending package that will cost every 
American citizen an average of about 
$6,000 apiece, or $15,000 per family. 
For what? What will they be getting 
for their share of this new debt? 
Some will get a $1,400 check in return 
for their $6,000 share of the debt. That 
is not a very good deal. 
This proposal comes from the same 
folks who continue to unjustifiably 
clamp down on our freedoms, economi-
cally and otherwise. In fact, in my own 
home State of Virginia, 25 percent of 
businesses have permanently closed 
since the lockdowns began. There is 
simply no substitute for the American 
economy, and no relief or spending 
package will ever be sufficient. 
When has government spending ever 
truly fixed a problem or not made it 
worse? 
We have to turn the American work-
er, the American businessperson, and 
the American economy loose. We have 
to stop spending our citizens’ futures. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman from Virginia. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will put his mask on. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. We have to 
stop spending our citizens’ financial fu-
ture. Instead, we have to empower 
them to chart their own economic des-
tiny. 
To paraphrase the words of a famous 
young 
environmentalist: 
How 
dare 
you? And how dare we? 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I know 
it is fascinating, and I have heard this 
argument now year after year after 
year talking about how much every in-
dividual in this country has owed be-
cause of the debt—the national debt. 
We have been accumulating debt in 
this country for most of our 240-year 
history. 
I ask the gentleman: Has there ever 
been one American citizen or one 
American citizen’s ancestor who has 
ever paid any of that debt or who has 
ever been asked to pay for that debt?

Of course not. That is because we are 
a sovereign currency nation. We don’t 
pay attention to that. 
And just to clarify one thing he said, 
he said spending money has never 
helped in a crisis. Well, you will find 
virtually no economist who will not 
say that what we did last spring when 
we passed the CARES Act helped us 
mitigate the very first few months of 
this disaster. We didn’t do enough 
then. We can’t make the same mistake 
now. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO), the distinguished chair of the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Kentucky for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the 
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
I am painfully aware of the toll this 
pandemic has taken on our Nation’s 
veterans. I hear from veterans who are 
struggling to find work as unemploy-
ment numbers rise. I hear from vet-
erans who have had their critical com-
pensation and pension exams post-
poned, delaying much-needed benefits. 
Sadly, we have lost over 8,900 vet-
erans and 120 VA staff to the pandemic 
so far. 
Across the Nation and at the height 
of the pandemic, veterans have stepped 
up to serve their country, a trait not 
uncommon for the thousands of vet-
erans whose services continue even 
after they pack away their uniforms. 
Their service as first responders and 
healthcare workers battling COVID–19; 
as essential employees keeping our 
economy moving, packages delivered, 
and hospitals sterilized has served as 
an example of how strong America can 
be when we act together. 
Despite all of the setbacks our Na-
tion has faced, it is our duty to be opti-
mistic. Our veterans have shown the 
way. 
Mr. Speaker, VA has responded to 
crises across the country through its 
Fourth Mission, even landing on the 
Capitol Grounds yesterday to deploy 
mobile vet centers to support U.S. Cap-
itol Police, members of the National 
Guard, and the congressional staff 
after the insurrection on January 6. 
Throughout this pandemic, veterans 
and VA have continued to step up and 
serve their communities, not just their 
fellow veterans. 
The time for decisive action is now. 
Passing this resolution does not negate 
the need for bipartisan cooperation. 
The need now is real, and the pain 
caused by this pandemic is deep. The 
best way to provide direct relief to the 
American people and continue serving 
all those who have served is to act fast 
and to do it now. We cannot afford to 
wait for higher case counts, for addi-
tional variants of the virus to emerge, 
for more Americans to go without 
work or watch their savings dwindle. 
We must act fast, and that is why we 
are here today. 
I just will say to the gentleman from 
Missouri that I know that we have bil-
lions of dollars that came to the State 
of California, but I would like to re-
mind the gentleman that California is 
a net donor State, including money 
that I am sure has gone to the State of 
Missouri. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from Cali-
fornia. I will remind him that his State 
government, yes, indeed, has already 
received $43 billion in taxpayer bail-
outs and will receive another $42 bil-
lion in taxpayer bailouts if this bill 
passes. 
But let’s talk about California. This 
is the State that has some of the most 
stringent lockdowns in the entire coun-
try. In fact, their lockdowns are so sig-
nificant that more than 16,500 small 
businesses will never open their doors 
again. That is government that be-
lieves that it is okay to deny you to go 
to your house of worship and to eat out 
in an outdoor restaurant, but you can 
go to a strip club or get a tattoo. That 
is California. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from the great State of 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
GREENE), 
a 
small 
businessowner who proudly represents 
the people of the 14th Congressional 
District. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition to the 
blue State bailout budget. The Demo-
crats know they don’t have the votes 
to pass these radical policies in the 
Senate, so they are doubling down on 
reconciliation to destroy our economy 
with a $2 trillion taxpayer-funded 
spending spree. 
Democrats are using reconciliation 
for the exact opposite purpose for 
which it was created. With this budget, 
Democrats are bailing out failing Dem-
ocrat-run States like Illinois and New 
York, expanding the welfare state, ex-
ploding the deficit, groveling to teach-
ers’ unions and teachers who refuse to 
go to work, and hiking taxes on 
businessowners who don’t comply with 
the higher minimum wage standard. 
This is just the beginning. 
They want to pay people more money 
to stay home rather than allowing 
them to go back to work and earn a 
paycheck. They are fine letting school-
children 
and 
parents 
suffer 
while 
teachers’ unions ignore them and still 
collect taxpayer-funded paychecks. 
American politicians sent millions of 
children and young adults home, closed 
their schools, and banned them from 
going to their jobs. They forced them 
to stay in isolation from their peers. 
They canceled prom, canceled sports, 
and canceled graduation. 
b 1415 
They claim this was for their safety, 
but the results have been horrific. Sui-
cide and depression have been on the 
rise. Do you think any family will feel 
like a consolation prize of $1,400 will 
make them feel good about their teen 
that committed suicide because of the 
shutdowns? I don’t think so. 
Democrats are trying to raise the 
minimum wage for jobs that they 
won’t even let people go to work in. 
Democrats closed their States while 
Georgia stayed open. Why are we sup-
posed to bail them out? Why are my 
hardworking constituents being pun-
ished for wanting to go to work and 
support their families? 
Democrat Governors have run their 
States like tyrants of third-world 
countries, not like free Americans. 
They are oppressing the American peo-
ple and reaping the benefits. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The gentlewoman from Georgia said 
that this plan is going to destroy the 
economy. I think it is interesting that 
the American Rescue Plan has received 
praise from the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, the Business Roundtable, the 
National Retail Federation, 
among 
other business groups, and top eco-
nomic advisers from the last four 
Presidents: Kevin Hassett, who I men-
tioned earlier from the Trump adminis-
tration; Gene Sperling; R. Glenn Hub-
bard; and Alan Blinder have all said 
that additional spending is needed to 
rescue the economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
PALLONE), 
the 
distin-
guished chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this legislation which 
will give Congress the ability to swiftly 
enact President Biden’s American Res-
cue Plan. Our Nation and our people 
are hurting. While we have made his-
toric progress developing lifesaving 
vaccines in record time, we are now in 
a race to get these vaccines into the 
arms of Americans as new variants of 
the virus spread. 
Unfortunately, the Trump adminis-
tration left President Biden a mess to 
clean up. President Trump refused to 
develop a national strategy to crush 
the virus and said it was the responsi-
bility of the States. This led to a slug-
gish and flawed vaccine rollout, a dis-
jointed patchwork of State testing 
plans, and supply chain constraints on 
essential medical supplies and personal 
protective equipment. 
In December, Congress made a down 
payment to help jump-start our Na-
tion’s recovery. However, our work is 
far from done. Congress must provide 
the new Biden administration the addi-
tional resources and support necessary 
to implement a national strategy. The 
American Rescue Plan is a comprehen-
sive, multipronged national approach. 
It is robust because we need a big plan 
to tackle the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The American Rescue Plan will in-
vest billions to speed up the distribu-
tion and administration of COVID–19 
vaccines across the country. It will 
support the development of community 
vaccination centers, as well as mobile 
vaccination units that can go into 
hard-to-reach areas that are often un-
derserved.

February 3, 2021 
The American Rescue Plan invests in 
a national testing strategy with fund-
ing for rapid tests, expanding lab ca-
pacity, and assisting States. Expanded 
testing will ensure that schools can 
support safe reopening, that vulnerable 
settings like long-term care facilities 
can regularly test their populations, 
and that any American can get a test 
for free when they need one. 
Mr. Speaker, we will also provide spe-
cific funding for health services and 
underserved 
communities. 
This 
in-
cludes funding to hire 100,000 new pub-
lic health workers. They will perform 
vital tasks like vaccine outreach and 
contact tracing for underserved popu-
lations. The American Rescue Plan 
provides 
additional 
investments 
in 
community health centers and health 
services on Tribal lands, and these 
funds will support the expansion of 
COVID vaccinations, treatment, and 
care to underserved populations. 
Mr. Speaker, this plan delivers bold 
relief to the American people. It de-
serves strong, bipartisan support here 
in the House. I urge my colleagues to 
act with the urgency of the moment 
and support this resolution. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gen-
tleman from New Jersey, and I wanted 
to remind the Chamber that his State 
government has already received $9.5 
billion worth of taxpayer bailouts and 
under this proposal, would receive an 
additional $9.5 billion under this plan, 
while that very same government has 
enacted 
lockdown 
policies 
directly 
leading to the closure of more than 
3,000 small businesses. 
And that State, very sadly, actually 
has the highest per capita death rate of 
all States in the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON), who represents the 19th 
Congressional District and has been an 
active participant in the budget proc-
ess for as long as I have known him, a 
true defender of fiscal responsibility. 
Mr. 
ARRINGTON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
thank you to my friend from the Show 
Me State and the ranking member and 
our fearless leader on budget. 
Speaking of show me, I would like for 
somebody to show me why this is good 
for the American people, Mr. Speaker. 
We all want to help our fellow Ameri-
cans. We all want to help our country 
get back to its feet from this pandemic 
and the unintended consequences from 
government actions, but this resolu-
tion is a disaster in and of itself on so 
many levels, Mr. Speaker. 
Let’s start with this spirit of unity 
and peace and bipartisanship. This 
President, one after another, has taken 
more executive actions than all three 
Presidents combined that have killed 
jobs, that have undermined the secu-
rity of the American people, and now, 
the first major legislation is to use rec-
onciliation to ram this through. 
This isn’t about relief and recovery, 
Mr. Speaker. This is about a Trojan 
horse to sneak policies that would not 
otherwise go anywhere in this Chamber 
because it couldn’t. There are Federal 
wage mandates, when our small busi-
nesses are sucking air trying to get on 
their feet, make payroll, provide a 
service. And we want to kill 4 million 
more jobs. That is a CBO estimate. 
That is in healthy times. That is in 
good times. 
This isn’t a recovery relief bill. It is 
a massive bailout and a windfall to 
poorly managed cities and States. My 
colleagues are asking $350 billion. Cen-
sus data shows that we have lost State 
revenue to the tune of $37 billion. What 
is the $350 billion going to go to, Mr. 
Speaker? I ask my colleagues. 
It is to bail out cities and States 
with poor management who have been 
reckless and irresponsible in their be-
havior and they want the taxpayers to 
bail them out. 
They are asking 10 times the amount 
of what they need. It is irresponsible. 
This is a series of bad policies. These 
are barriers, not incentives, to recov-
ery. 
There is $500 billion, a massive redis-
tribution of wealth to people who are 
unaffected by COVID, to people who 
are in this country illegally, Mr. 
Speaker. 
This resolution increases the unem-
ployment insurance so that 80 percent 
of the people are actually being paid 
more on unemployment than at their 
previous job. Are you kidding me? 
Please, tell me this is not a recovery 
bill, Mr. Speaker. Look, we don’t need 
another job-killing Federal mandate, 
reckless 
spending, 
liberal, 
partisan 
wish list. We need to open up this great 
country’s economy, get our kids back 
to school, and bring America back. 
Please work with us to do that for 
the sake of this country. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the com-
ments from my friend from Texas, and 
I remind him that this, as I said in my 
opening statement, is plan B. We would 
prefer not to do this. We would prefer 
to have a bipartisan, regular order so-
lution to this. We could do it actually 
more expeditiously than the reconcili-
ation process. 
But when Republicans, in an effort to 
be supposedly bipartisan, offer $600 bil-
lion—when virtually everyone says we 
need relief and rescue money approach-
ing the $1.9 trillion figure—it is not 
genuine, bipartisan, good-faith nego-
tiation. That is posturing. 
We will have several weeks to reach a 
bipartisan agreement. I hope we can. 
But this is plan B. And we will proceed 
with it because the American people 
can’t wait as long as the Republicans 
seem to be able to. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 
21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), the distin-
guished chairman of the Agriculture 
Committee. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me tell 
my Republican friends this: All you 
have to do to know why we have got to 
go big for the survival of our Nation is 
look at the news recently. Have you 
seen the lines of cars? Some have been 
in line since 4 and 5 in the morning. 
And our community food banks are 
there. 
Why do you think that they are 
there? They are hungry. We have got 17 
million of our children going to bed 
hungry every single night because the 
American people don’t have the money 
to go buy groceries. And you know, 
what? One of the fastest growing 
groups of those out there hungry, who 
are starving, who are dying under the 
viaducts, who are committing suicide 
in record numbers, are our veterans. 
That is why we need to go bold, to go 
big. You talk about bipartisanship. 
That is what the American people 
want, bipartisanship to get money in 
their pockets. 
And look, friends, I am chairman of 
the Agriculture Committee. I am a 
businessman. I graduated from the top 
school of finance in the world, the 
Wharton School of Finance. I can 
speak on this economy. The basic tool 
of growth in economy is getting money 
in the pockets of people who are spend-
ing. That is how you keep your com-
munity going. They are not going to 
sit on that money. They are going to 
buy, go into Kroger and Publix and get 
food. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Georgia an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, now is the time. We can’t af-
ford more delays. The time for us to be 
bold is now. This is the time to be deci-
sive, to move confidently, and most im-
portantly, to move Democrats and Re-
publicans together to save our great 
Nation; not tomorrow. The time is 
now. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to high-
light that just in the last couple of 
days, the Congressional Budget Office 
released a report that, in fact, the 
economy will strengthen, grow, and re-
cover without any additional stimulus 
dollars by the middle of 2021. You are 
looking at in just 5 to 6 months, the 
Congressional Budget Office said that 
the economy will recover without one 
single penny being spent of stimulus 
money. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK), a leader on the Budget 
Committee. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, $2 
trillion in revenues, $6 trillion in 
spending. This is madness. This is how 
countries commit fiscal suicide: force

the economy to shut down, and then 
hand out government checks. 
The problem, of course, is that the 
government does not finance the econ-
omy. It is the economy that finances 
the government. 
And when you wantonly destroy mil-
lions of jobs by forcing small busi-
nesses to shutter, by canceling con-
struction and energy production across 
the country, when you flood the labor 
market with millions of illegal immi-
grants at a time when millions of 
Americans are out of work, you shut 
down the economy, and you shut down 
the tax revenues that the economy pro-
duces and that the government spends. 
And so we borrow instead. Now, this 
budget requires $4 trillion in bor-
rowing. Now, where will it borrow this 
$4 trillion from? The future earnings of 
your family, of course. 
b 1430 
Let’s add this up. There are 129 mil-
lion households in the United States. $4 
trillion comes to $31,000 added to the 
debt of every household in America, at 
the average. 
Now, this isn’t theoretical. That is 
real money that will be repaid by every 
family through its future taxes, tax- 
driven price increases, lower wages, 
and inflation. That is the future for our 
families that the Democrats set in mo-
tion today while they promise to help 
us through these tough times with this 
sorry excuse for a budget resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, it is not just our future 
that is being robbed. That money must 
be repaid in the future, but it must be 
borrowed in the present from the same 
capital market that would otherwise be 
available to loan to consumers seeking 
to make consumer purchases that drive 
two-thirds of our economic growth, or 
businesses seeking to recover, or to 
home buyers seeking to buy homes. 
That money will not be there for them 
because the government has borrowed 
it instead. 
Now, remember, the government can-
not put a single dollar into the econ-
omy that it has not first taken out of 
that very same economy. If I take a 
dollar from Peter and give it to Paul, it 
is true, Paul has an extra dollar to 
spend. That is what the Democrats are 
calling stimulus. But it is equally true 
that Peter now has one less dollar to 
spend in that same economy, which is 
why these stimulus schemes never 
work in the present and always dimin-
ish our future. 
Mr. Speaker, our country is in des-
perate condition because of govern-
ment-mandated lockdowns that have 
failed to slow the coronavirus while 
they have laid waste to our economy 
and the livelihoods of millions upon 
millions of Americans. 
There is only one relief measure that 
will rescue our Nation from this 
dystopian 
nightmare: 
End 
the 
lockdowns. 
History is screaming this warning at 
us. Countries that bankrupt them-
selves and destroy their economies 
simply aren’t around very long. Let 
that not be the epitaph of the United 
States of America. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ), the distin-
guished chair of the Committee on 
Small Business. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of this budget resolution be-
cause small businesses need help now. 
This pandemic has already darkened 
hundreds of thousands of storefronts on 
Main Streets throughout America. A 
recent study found that 800 businesses 
closed daily between April and Sep-
tember last year. 
Every day without Federal relief, 
this pandemic shutters businesses, de-
stroys lives, and wipes out good-paying 
jobs. COVID is devastating Black and 
Latino entrepreneurs, dropping the 
number of businesses by 41 and 32 per-
cent, respectively. Small businesses do 
not have time for drawn-out negotia-
tions nor debates over process. They 
need help immediately. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s budget resolu-
tion gives us a critical tool to deliver 
urgently needed aid to small firms and 
the American people by passing Presi-
dent Biden’s American Rescue Plan. 
This resolution will grant us the 
means to provide small businesses, par-
ticularly those that are underserved, 
with billions in new funding for loans, 
grants, and support programs. 
This resolution will enable us to ap-
propriate desperately needed funds for 
the national strategy to crush the 
virus. 
This resolution would allow us to 
make a difference in the lives of mil-
lions of Americans who have lost their 
jobs by expanding unemployment bene-
fits and extending the eviction morato-
rium. 
I welcome Republican support for 
these efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, what we are proposing 
are commonsense measures to offer a 
lifeline to struggling Americans. We 
must prepare to move forward. The 
price of inaction is too steep. The 
longer we wait, the more lives COVID 
will take. The longer we wait, the more 
businesses this pandemic will destroy. 
The longer we wait, the more people in 
my district suffer. 
We need a big, bold package. That is 
why I strongly encourage my col-
leagues to support this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish that the other 
side would care about the $2 trillion 
tax cut package. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, when 
we look at how much businesses in this 
country are suffering today and how 
many businesses are shutting their 
doors, it is our responsibility to help 
them get whole. The only way that 
consumers are going to go into the 
malls and the restaurants is when they 
have peace of mind that we have done 
everything to protect them. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentlewoman’s com-
ments, and the best way to help her 
constituents and to help those small 
businesses in the State of New York is 
to stop the lockdowns. 
Mr. Speaker, we have more than $1 
trillion that is lingering out there that 
has been appropriated to help these 
small businesses, to help healthcare 
professionals, to help with vaccina-
tions. They are still hurting, but the 
money is still there. 
Mr. Speaker, what is happening so 
bad in the State of New York is that 
they are not using science. They are 
using arbitrary items that have shut 
down more than 6,500 small businesses 
in the State of New York. Open up the 
State of New York so small businesses 
can operate and grow. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS), a 
distinguished Navy veteran, our leader 
on the Republican Study Committee, 
and a rising podcast star. 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member, and I congratu-
late my friend in his new leadership 
role in addressing what is one of the 
most important issues in our country 
today, which is fiscal irresponsibility 
and a now nearly $30 trillion national 
debt. I appreciate his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why today I rise 
in opposition to this, the Democrats’ 
sham $2.1 trillion parody of a budget. 
Democrats, in their own words, having 
failed again to pass a budget last year, 
now say: ‘‘The 2021 budget resolution 
has a single purpose. It gives Congress 
the option of using a budget reconcili-
ation.’’ 
However, this is a very different tune 
than what my Democrat colleagues 
said just a few years ago. In August 
2017, Senate Majority Leader SCHUMER 
said reconciliation is ‘‘the wrong way 
to do the business of the country,’’ and 
he demanded a bipartisan solution in-
stead. 
Democrats are once again shirking 
their duty to produce a budget while 
intending to ram a partisan spending 
bill down the throats of the American 
people. 
However, in 2019, the Republican 
Study Committee, which I chair, pro-
duced a budget that balanced in 6 
years. It reduced tax burdens on Amer-
ican families, limited the Federal Gov-
ernment to our core constitutional re-
sponsibilities, 
and 
prioritized 
indi-
vidual liberty. 
Speaker 
PELOSI
once 
infamously 
said: ‘‘Show me your values. Show me 
your budget.’’ 
Well, now we know what those values 
are. At a time when most small busi-
nesses are fighting for their lives, they 
would proudly impose minimum wage 
hikes and Green New Deal sanctions 
that would starve our economy. 
What they won’t tell you, though, is 
where they plan on getting this money

from—from American workers, Amer-
ican families, and robbing future gen-
erations. That is where. 
Mr. Speaker, every dollar taxed, bor-
rowed, or printed by the government is 
a dollar taken from a hardworking 
family. It is a credit on a small busi-
ness, or it ends up creating price bub-
bles that wipe out a lifetime of savings. 
Mr. Speaker, we know these are their 
values, but I ask: Are these America’s 
values? 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS), the distin-
guished chair of the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I happily 
rise in support of this joint budget res-
olution for fiscal year 2021 to enact our 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan 
and 
provide 
urgently 
needed 
COVID–19 relief. 
Thank God for President Biden. We 
have been without a plan with a Presi-
dent who was busy trying to steal votes 
and abandon the American people when 
he knew that we were suffering. 
Communities across the Nation con-
tinue to suffer during this pandemic 
crisis. Congress has a duty to act and 
come to the aid of struggling individ-
uals, families, and small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not about giving 
tax breaks to the richest people in 
America the way the past President 
and the Republicans are intent on al-
ways doing. 
President Biden’s plan provides the 
relief that America needs so badly. The 
plan increases the stimulus payments 
to individuals in December to $2,000, 
adding $1,400 for every individual; ex-
tends enhanced unemployment assist-
ance; and provides nutritional assist-
ance to address growing hunger. 
Mr. Speaker, people are hungry all 
over America. They are hungry in the 
cities, in the little towns, in the rural 
areas. This plan provides nutritional 
assistance to address this growing hun-
ger and includes $350 billion in funding 
for State, local, Tribal, and territorial 
governments. 
Mr. Speaker, as chairwoman of the 
House Committee on Financial Serv-
ices, I have been sounding the alarm 
about the urgent need for emergency 
rental and homeless assistance during 
this crisis, as millions are at risk of 
losing their homes. They don’t care on 
the other side whether families will be 
set out on the sidewalks with their 
children. The past President turned a 
blind eye to the fact that people have 
not been able to pay their rents since 
March. 
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to this resolu-
tion, my committee will quickly con-
sider an additional $25 billion to sup-
port renters and their landlords, in-
cluding by funding emergency housing 
vouchers, Tribal housing assistance, 
and rural housing. We will provide an-
other round of funding for people expe-
riencing homelessness, who are often 
the most vulnerable to the pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, my committee will also 
quickly respond to the urgent needs of 
small and minority-owned businesses 
by establishing programs used success-
fully during the financial crisis to pro-
mote growth in the economy. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, impor-
tantly, my committee will support our 
President’s effort to roll out a com-
prehensive Federal plan to address the 
pandemic by considering how to bolster 
the authorities under the Defense Pro-
duction Act to ensure our frontline 
workers have the medical equipment 
and supplies they need to fight this 
pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased we fi-
nally have a plan for America. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
the last 2 weeks, working-class Ameri-
cans have faced a great target on their 
backs from the new President. By the 
stroke of a pen—47 different executive 
orders and actions—he has fired hun-
dreds of thousands of American work-
ers. 
Mr. Speaker, by the stroke of a pen, 
in the last 2 weeks, the sitting Presi-
dent has fired hundreds of thousands of 
American workers who are wondering 
where their next paycheck will come 
from, who are wondering how they are 
going to pay their mortgage, who are 
wondering how they are going to sur-
vive in South Dakota, North Dakota, 
Texas, Wyoming, Colorado. 
Just because this President was try-
ing to unify his liberal base, he fired 
hundreds of thousands of American 
workers. It is war on the working class. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON), 
a distinguished journalist. 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Missouri. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to this sham budget resolution. 
When I came to Congress, I said I 
would work with anybody to get things 
done and deliver for Iowans. I know 
there will be opportunities to do that, 
and I hope there are across the aisle. 
But today, I have to say I am dis-
appointed that we are debating a 
hyper-partisan resolution instead. It is 
a disgrace to taxpayers. It was crafted 
in the back rooms. And Iowans’ seat at 
the table was taken away through this 
process today. 
As a result, this budget resolution 
will allow major legislation to move 
along partisan lines, including Presi-
dent Biden’s $1.9 trillion spending plan. 
Mr. Speaker, this plan isn’t about 
COVID relief at all. It is about jam-
ming through a liberal agenda, includ-
ing a $15 minimum wage mandate. 
b 1445 
This would absolutely decimate our 
rural economy in Iowa and would de-
stroy livelihoods across my district. 
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that a $15 minimum wage would 
kill at least 1.3 million jobs. So let’s 
talk about the real people here, the 
workers, the Iowans who make up 
these statistics. 
Cubs Auto Shop is a small business in 
Brooklyn, Iowa, in my district. The 
owner built his business from the 
ground up, and he told us that a $15 
Federal minimum wage would make it 
hard to expand his business at all. 
We need economic growth now more 
than ever before. He is just one of my 
many constituents who have told me 
they would have to lay off workers, 
raise prices, or even shut down perma-
nently if a $15 minimum wage becomes 
a reality. This might be right for Cali-
fornia and New York, but one-size-fits- 
all Federal minimum wage mandates 
would destroy small businesses and 
rural communities in my district. 
It is unacceptable that the budget 
would be used to push this through. In-
stead, we should be using it to stop 
Washington’s pork spending. 
So, today, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to oppose this 
faux budget resolution and stand up for 
taxpayers. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to welcome the gentlewoman from 
Iowa to the House of Representatives 
and just remark that when she said 
that this is a plan that was crafted in 
secret, this plan was crafted during the 
2020 campaign. It was part of President 
Biden’s agenda, and every American 
voter had a chance to register his or 
her support for that plan. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire from the 
Chair as to how much time remains on 
both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
SUOZZI). The gentleman from Kentucky 
has 20 minutes remaining. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 13 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. HIGGINS), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, the past year has tested 
America’s resolve and steeled our char-
acter. We enter a new year optimistic 
with still much work before us. 
The pandemic has taken much from 
us, but it has also shown us the best of 
our country: Americans helping one 
another through acts of charity and 
kindness; health workers going non-
stop to treat, test, trace, and vac-
cinate; teachers, firefighters, police, 
and sanitation workers serving the 
public at great risk to their own 
health. 
Vaccines are being distributed and 
administered. Hope is in sight. But 
many Americans are still in peril, and 
Congress must act. 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan is the bold initiative which meets 
this critical moment. Now is the time 
to go big, to guarantee every family 
has food and shelter over their heads; 
to safely get our children back into the 
classrooms; to protect our small busi-
nesses, restaurants, and workers who 
braved this pandemic; and to invest in

February 3, 2021 
our State and local communities that 
have fought this virus on the front 
lines. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to sup-
port 
this 
budget 
resolution. 
Only 
through bold action can we crush this 
virus, return to normal, and build a 
stronger Nation. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. KILDEE), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support 
of 
this 
budget 
resolution, 
which gives Congress the additional 
legislative tool it needs to pass the ur-
gently needed coronavirus relief for our 
constituents and for our communities. 
I am very pleased that President Biden 
has made defeating this virus his top 
priority. 
This pandemic is not over. COVID–19 
continues to pose both a health and 
economic crisis, so we have to respond 
with solutions that are scaled to the 
size and scope of this problem. By pass-
ing this resolution, Congress will be 
able to get relief to people more quick-
ly: more resources for vaccine distribu-
tion; more aid to reopen schools safely; 
additional support for families, for sen-
iors, for small businesses that are hurt-
ing. 
I know that Republicans and Demo-
crats share these common goals. In 
fact, they are speaking up all across 
the country. Republicans and Demo-
crats support this big and bold ap-
proach. 
We should work together in this body 
to manifest that and pass this legisla-
tion, so we get the people the help they 
need. 
Doing nothing is not an option, and 
neither is doing too little. In fact, we 
have heard so much about the long- 
term economic impact. The truth of 
the matter is, doing nothing or doing 
too little will cost us more money, an 
estimated 4 million jobs that could be 
lost. The impact on families, the im-
pact on all of us, would be tremendous 
if we fail to scale the response to the 
size of this problem. 
Mr. Speaker, my Republican col-
leagues were very quick to use this 
very same process to pass legislation 
that we received the day before we 
voted on it, to give massive tax cuts to 
the very people at the very top of the 
economy. Now, when we see a crisis 
that literally is threatening the lives 
and the livelihoods of Americans, we 
have to use every tool we can to get 
them the help they need. 
I support this resolution, and I urge 
my colleagues to do so as well. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gen-
tleman from Michigan, and I will re-
mind him that his State government 
has already received $10 billion in tax-
payer bailouts and will receive another 
$10.5 under this plan. 
However, if President Biden wouldn’t 
have done 1 of his 47 executive orders, 
his State would have received another 
$230 million. But the President short-
changed the State of Michigan by $230 
million because of one of his 47 strokes 
of the pen in the last 2 weeks. So, I 
think the gentleman would be a little 
upset with his President for that ac-
tion. 
Also, because of the lockdowns, the 
State of Michigan has lost more than 
3,500 small businesses. Such a shame. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. JA-
COBS), a great addition to the Budget 
Committee. 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the budget resolution put forth by the 
majority. 
Rather than seek bipartisan con-
sensus, Democrats are effectively shut-
ting out Republicans through this rec-
onciliation process. The Democrats are 
proposing to spend $1.9 trillion, one of 
the largest single expenditures in U.S. 
history. 
They will be funding this historic ex-
penditure by dramatically increasing 
our national debt, and these unprece-
dented and historic obligations are 
being undertaken without engaging in 
the Budget Committee at all. 
Just because the Democrats have 
control of both Houses and the Presi-
dency does not mean they should be 
abusing this power, bypassing the im-
portant and deliberative role of the 
legislative process instead of working 
in earnest with the Republican Mem-
bers. 
In the 116th Congress, we were able to 
find bipartisan consensus on COVID re-
lief, and I believe we can do the same 
here now. 
This go-it-alone approach is very un-
fortunate because there are many pro-
visions in President Biden’s proposal 
that I could support. I have been call-
ing for additional aid to local govern-
ments since I arrived here in Congress 
this summer. Further, we most defi-
nitely need more resources to ensure a 
more robust deployment of vaccines 
throughout the Nation. 
This partisan approach to relief legis-
lation is damaging and unproductive. I 
hope the majority will reconsider this 
process. 
I want to believe President Biden’s 
calls for unity, bipartisanship, and co-
operation. I was encouraged to see the 
talks between the White House and the 
Senate Republicans. This is exactly 
how we should be working to address 
the needs of the American people. 
During these very challenging times, 
I stand ready and willing to work with 
the Biden administration and any of 
my colleagues across the aisle to help 
the American people. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
vada (Mr. HORSFORD), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H. Con. Res. 11. 
And before I start, I want to just let 
the ranking member know, my job is to 
get as many resources to my State as 
possible from this COVID relief. So, I 
hope you report how much money my 
State has received, and please say ‘‘Ne-
vada’’ correctly when you do it. 
That money is needed to help work-
ers, families, and small businesses who 
are struggling during the worst pan-
demic that we have experienced in a 
generation. 
Now, 3 years ago, Republicans pushed 
through the biggest tax cuts in Amer-
ican history for the wealthiest Ameri-
cans and the biggest corporations. 
Those tax cuts added nearly $2 trillion 
to the national debt without a whisper 
about fiscal conservatism from my col-
leagues on the other side. 
Now, in the middle of a pandemic, 
one that has resulted in more than 
400,000 deaths of our fellow Americans, 
millions of jobs that have been lost, 
and countless small businesses that 
have been shuttered, my colleagues on 
the other side want to talk about the 
deficit. 
Well, I am calling your bluff. This 
isn’t about the deficit; it is about ob-
struction. And if Republicans would 
rather watch their constituents—to the 
ranking member, you have the same 
constituents. You have talked to me 
about the fact that your district is one 
of the poorest districts in the country. 
You and I have talked. You are also a 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. I have relatives in Missouri, so 
I am just as concerned about those 
workers, those families, and those 
small businesses. 
We want to crush the virus, but in 
my home State, we can’t recover and 
reopen our economy until we crush this 
virus. So, I need you to work with us. 
There is nothing in this resolution that 
says Republicans can’t join on board. 
The President said today that he is 
willing to entertain suggestions on how 
to move forward. 
But my vote for this resolution is a 
call to my colleagues to work with us 
to get this done because our constitu-
ents are counting on us, not blue State 
constituents or red State constituents 
but American constituents. 
I represent rural parts of my district 
that are conservative, and I have urban 
parts of my district that are not. I am 
fighting for all of them. 
I am taking a stand, and I am asking 
you to work with us to pass this Amer-
ican Rescue Plan for all families, for 
all workers, and for all small busi-
nesses that have suffered for far too 
long. I know that these are divided 
times, but bipartisanship can change 
that. 
Mr. Ranking Member, I am asking 
you to work with us, not in the major-
ity, but as colleagues to do the right 
thing on behalf of all of our constitu-
ents because that is why each one of us 
was elected. Courage is what American 
people deserve most, Mr. Speaker. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

H300 
February 3, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
gentleman from Nevada for his com-
ments and how we are eager to work in 
a bipartisan approach in this package. 
That is why we are kind of frustrated, 
because our committee has not even 
organized so that we could even have a 
discussion on a bipartisan approach. 
Instead, the majority’s side decided 
to force through this reconciliation 
without even going through the Budget 
Committee because they have not even 
organized. 
So, I would love to work with them, 
but you have already closed the door. 
Hopefully, you will reopen it so we can 
discuss this, and I would love to work 
with him. 
Also, in my State, in my congres-
sional district, we have operated under 
what I believe are the best processes in 
fighting COVID, not locking down and 
shutting the doors on your small busi-
nesses. 
We have some of the lowest unem-
ployment rates in the State of Mis-
souri, thanks to the leadership of Gov-
ernor Parson. Also, we have the lowest 
death rates of COVID in our State, 
thanks to the leadership of Governor 
Mike Parson. 
I wish the States of Nevada, Cali-
fornia, and New York, and a lot of 
other States, would open up and stop 
the lockdowns and follow the science. 
Then, there wouldn’t be bailout pieces 
of legislation to go to the States that 
have made the wrong choices. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. SPARTZ), a true pa-
triot. 
b 1500 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, as a fi-
nance professional and CPA who spent 
over a decade working in advanced fi-
nance, as former accounting college 
faculty, and as a mother of two young 
daughters, I am appalled at how reck-
less, irresponsible, and broken our 
budgeting process is. 
The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
and the intent of fast-track reconcili-
ations has been completely misused, 
often by both parties. These budgeting 
gimmicks are unacceptable. We must 
reinstate the deliberative process in 
our House and restore transparency, 
accountability, and basic principles of 
budgeting. 
I hope my Democrat colleagues will 
express similar concerns to their lead-
ership, since we all care about the fu-
ture of our children and our country. 
As their fellow Democrat Senator 
once said: We are in the process now of 
seeing the Pandora’s box, which has 
been opened to the abuse of the rec-
onciliation process. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT), who is a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. DOGGETT. ‘‘Reconciliation’’ de-
fines not only this budget process, but, 
to most Americans, it simply means 
that you come together to overcome 
prior differences. President Biden has 
made clear his desire to reconcile, to 
come together. We welcome Republican 
proposals, but we steadfastly reject Re-
publican delay. Too many Americans 
are struggling to let these filibustering 
Republican Senators repeat what hap-
pened last year. You remember, Mr. 
Speaker. We waited, we waited, and we 
waited more than seven months, and, 
finally, they yielded at the edge of 
Christmas and gave us too little, too 
late. 
After so much dithering, today rep-
resents an opportunity for Republicans 
to reconcile. They need to reconcile 
with the truth. They need to reconcile 
with the facts—not phony ‘‘alternative 
facts,’’ but reality; to come together, 
with us, for American families who 
never received those 100 million vac-
cines that President Trump told us 
would be here last year, to reconcile 
with the reality of anxious Americans 
today who are out there calling, stand-
ing in lines, and trying anxiously to 
get some protection from this pan-
demic that wasn’t provided last year. 
When the Senate is permitted to be-
come a graveyard for important legis-
lation for American families, too many 
Americans are sent prematurely to the 
graveyard. 
Could anyone have imagined here a 
year ago that Trump Republicans who 
refused to prepare and respond to this 
pandemic—remember 
when 
they 
claimed that the virus would simply 
just disappear like a miracle? 
Could anyone have imagined that 
now as a result of their approach, al-
most half a million Americans are dead 
and more to come from their vanishing 
virus? 
As that virus has evolved to become 
more transmittable, cannot our col-
leagues evolve to hear the need for vac-
cine, for food, and to not having people 
sleep under bridges? 
Let’s reconcile, let’s make amends, 
and let’s deliver relief now. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from Texas, 
but I would like to remind this Cham-
ber again that the administration’s 
hostility to the energy industry has 
demonstrated by just the stroke of a 
pen his executive actions have threat-
ened at least 120,000 jobs in the State of 
Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from the great State of Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN), who is a vet-
eran of the Budget Committee, whom I 
am glad to have back. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
know normally Congressmen take this 
opportunity to talk about some hot- 
button issue; therefore I feel a little re-
gret that I am going to have to delve 
into what the great English historian 
Thomas 
Carlyle 
called 
the 
dismal 
science. I am going to have to address 
economics. 
I am going to talk about two issues. 
I am going to talk about the monetary 
supply, and I am going to talk about 
inflation. It is a little bit boring, but 
they are both very important. 
First, the monetary supply. If you 
wonder where I get these numbers, Mr. 
Speaker, you can google John Wil-
liams’ ‘‘Shadow Government Statis-
tics.’’ I am going to talk about M1 and 
M2. 
M1 is a narrow definition of the mon-
etary supply. We are now up rocketing 
at over 65 percent increase. You can go 
back 20 years and the highest prior in-
crease is under 20 percent. So when you 
have this much of an outlier, look out. 
Some people would say M2, which is 
a more narrow definition, including 
things like certificates of deposit, is 
better; but even that amount is shoot-
ing up 25 percent a year. The previous 
high in the last 20 years was 18 percent 
in 2008. And you remember what hap-
pened after 2008. 
As the great James Garfield, Repub-
lican President—oh, how we wish he 
had a full 4 years—said: ‘‘He who con-
trols the money supply of a nation con-
trols the nation.’’ 
Please, I beg the chairman of the 
Budget Committee, before proceeding 
forth here, hold a hearing on the 
money supply. 
Secondly, I want to talk about infla-
tion a little bit. Sometimes it is for-
gotten that in both 1980 and 1990, we 
changed the definition of inflation. But 
I am old enough to remember the 
Jimmy Carter years and how dev-
astating it was when we used to have 
inflation of over 15 percent. 
Right now, if you had that definition 
back then, inflation would already be 
running at about 10 percent a year. 
Even if you looked after 1990, when, 
again, the definition changed, we ran 
inflation at about 5 percent a year. 
Now, you can only imagine what would 
happen if we throw another $2 trillion 
of money and the amount of inflation 
will go up. 
Look at the cost of housing in the 
supposed economic downturn. Already 
the cost of housing is going up. That 
should be a danger sign for everybody. 
I was critical of the past administra-
tion on a variety of things. I was op-
posed to President Trump’s $2,000-a- 
person thing for this reason. I think 
there is still time to turn back before 
we have a huge problem with the 
money 
supply 
and 
the 
overall 
stockmarket, and we can still show 
that this Congress has a little bit of 
fiscal responsibility. 
I again beg: Please have a hearing 
not just on the monetary supply, but a 
hearing on inflation. 
As Herbert Stein, an economist of 
some fame and even more famous as 
Ben Stein’s dad, said: ‘‘If something 
can’t go on forever, it won’t.’’ 
I ask the chairman to please have a 
hearing on monetary supply and infla-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H301 
February 3, 2021 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JEFFRIES), who is the chair-
man of the Democratic Caucus and a 
distinguished member of the Budget 
Committee. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair of the Budget 
Committee from the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky for yielding, as well as for 
his tremendous leadership in connec-
tion with this resolution and the effort 
to deal with this moment that we find 
ourselves in this country. 
These are challenging times in the 
United States of America, filled with 
pain, suffering, and death. More than 
425,000 Americans have died. Over 26 
million Americans have been infected 
by the coronavirus. More than 100,000 
small businesses have permanently 
closed. Tens of millions of Americans 
have been grappling with unemploy-
ment or food insecurity. Many are on 
the brink of homelessness. 
These are challenging times in the 
United States of America, filled with 
pain, suffering, and death. Now is not 
the time for obfuscation or modera-
tion. Now is the time to go big and to 
decisively deal with the problems that 
everyday Americans are confronting. 
COVID–19 is a once-in-a-century pan-
demic. It requires a once-in-a-century, 
comprehensive, continuing, and com-
passionate 
congressional 
response. 
That is what the American Rescue 
Plan put forth by President Biden is all 
about. 
We 
must 
crush 
the 
coronavirus 
through testing, tracing, treatment, 
and 
vaccinations 
for 
every 
single 
American. We must provide direct re-
lief to everyday Americans by increas-
ing survival checks to $2,000 per person. 
We must lay the foundation to super-
charge our economy so we can build 
back better for the people. That is 
what the American Rescue Plan is all 
about. That is what today’s vote is all 
about. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ so we can move America 
forward and put this virus behind us 
once and for all. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ROY), who is a true de-
fender of conservative principles. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
distinguished gentleman from Missouri 
for yielding. I enjoyed working with 
him on the Budget Committee the last 
2 years. I wish I was this time. Maybe 
we will do it in a couple of years. 
I enjoy working with the distin-
guished chairman from Kentucky, but I 
find it interesting that after 2 years on 
the Budget Committee I am finally see-
ing a budget resolution, because I sure 
didn’t see one for the last 2 years. 
But here we are. We are on the floor 
of the House of Representatives, alleg-
edly the people’s House. 
Do I get to offer an amendment? Do 
I get to say a single word about what is 
in this $2 trillion bill? 
No, because this is fake. 
The American people are looking at 
the people’s House. They are asking: 
What are we doing? 
We are surrounded by fences and 
razor wire. We are going through 
magnetometers. I am sitting here on 
the floor of the House with a $2 trillion 
bill larded up for political purposes 
that I never had a chance to amend, de-
bate or have any discussion about be-
sides 2 minutes or 3 minutes here with 
a prepackaged bill done in smoke-filled 
rooms, brought to the floor, and I am 
told to vote ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no,’’ push the 
green button, push the red button. 
That is what we have taken the peo-
ple’s House and reduced it to. 
We have $4 trillion that we have 
spent on COVID relief. With all due re-
spect to my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle who are saying go big, 
we have spent $4 trillion. 
I have worked on a bipartisan basis 
with my friend, DEAN PHILLIPS, to pass 
the PPP Flexibility Act. We are all 
working hard to help the American 
people, but this resolution is a sham. 
When are we going to get in com-
mittee and vote and debate and roll our 
sleeves up and offer amendments? 
When are we going to do the work that 
we were sent here to do? 
The distinguished leader from Mary-
land has been here a while, respect-
fully. This place has changed. The gen-
tleman from Maryland and I have 
talked about this. 
When are we going to offer amend-
ments? When are we going to debate 
and vote on those amendments? 
That is what bipartisanship is, not 
throwing a $2 trillion reconciliation 
measure to use as pressure with the 
Senate to play games so that you can 
try to force the hand of the Senate to 
get the 60 votes, and then come down 
here and say: Oh, yeah, we have done 
something great with some budget rec-
onciliation. 
Have we had any debate down here 
about what is actually affecting the 
people of this country? Or do we have a 
bunch of show speeches? 
When are we going to turn this body 
back into the people’s House? When are 
we going to turn this into something 
the American people can be proud 
about, that we are sitting here debat-
ing something serious? 
Should we have $300 billion for local 
governments? Should we have some 
help for small businesses? Should we 
have something? 
Let’s debate this out. No one over 
here wants to see their people suffer in 
the States that they represent. But we 
want businesses open. We want eco-
nomic growth and opportunity. We 
don’t want to point fingers. We have 30- 
something million vaccines distrib-
uted. Let’s not point fingers. Let’s take 
the work that has been done by the 
previous administration, by this body 
on a bipartisan basis, and let’s move 
forward and get this country working 
again. 
China is about to roll right over us if 
we don’t do our job, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
respond to my friend from Texas, to 
say that, in about 3 weeks or a little 
less, the Budget Committee will have a 
piece of legislation which actually goes 
into the details of the American Res-
cue Plan and includes those. There will 
be a markup. The gentleman will have 
every opportunity to offer amend-
ments, and then that bill will come to 
the floor as well. So don’t give up hope. 
Mr. ROY. Will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. ROY. I am no longer on the 
Budget Committee. So will I have the 
ability to offer amendments? 
Mr. YARMUTH. We will have a floor 
debate as well. In regular order, the 
gentleman will go through the Rules 
Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER). 
b 1515 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, Mr. ROY is 
walking off the floor, but I am one of 
those Members that has sympathy for 
his frustration. I have sympathy for his 
frustration because I have served here 
for a long time when we did things in 
a bipartisan, regular order way. 
But I hope the gentleman shared the 
same frustration when we passed a tax 
bill that did $2 trillion, at a time when 
the economy didn’t need a tax cut and 
the people who got the tax cut clearly 
did not need it. And I had the same 
frustration the gentleman has ex-
pressed. 
As the gentleman who chairs the 
committee pointed out, this is the first 
step, however, in giving instructions on 
what committees ought to do, and 
doesn’t tell them exactly how to do it. 
Next week is going to be an entire com-
mittee week in which 12 committees 
will consider how to achieve the objec-
tives set forth in the budget resolution. 
But I do share, and we ought all share 
that we don’t act in the bipartisan 
fashion in which we ought to. 
The President met with 10 Repub-
lican Senators. They are pretty far 
apart. I am going to speak a little bit 
about the substance of this, but I want 
to assure the gentleman that I am a 
big supporter of regular order. I think 
we ought to pass all 12 appropriations 
bills and not do these omnibus bills 
that nobody knows what is in them: 
not you, not me. I am the majority 
leader. You think, well, he knows all 
that is in there. I don’t. Why? Because 
they are so massive that you really 
don’t have an opportunity and we don’t 
debate them fully. So I want to say 
that I share the frustration. 
On this, I think we need to move 
quickly, and I am going say why in the 
comments that I make. But I didn’t 
want the gentleman to go off the floor 
thinking that everybody was simply 
dismissing, not so much the substance, 
but the frustration he feels, I feel, and 
I think so many of our Members feel 
about the process being either too 
quick or too slow, too comprehensive, 
too incomprehensible. So I just wanted 
to say that to the gentleman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H302 
February 3, 2021 
Mr. ROY. Will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. ROY. I would just ask if we 
might be able to at least meet in pri-
vate and have discussions about how to 
restore regular order and offer amend-
ments on the floor because to the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Budget 
Committee that is great to debate it in 
committee, but I am no longer on the 
Budget Committee, so I would love to 
have the ability to debate on the floor 
and have regular order. And I just 
think if we could just have a conversa-
tion, sit in a room and figure out how 
we can do that going forward, no mat-
ter who is in charge of the Chamber. 
Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, 
Mr. Speaker, we have passed four 
major 
pieces 
of 
legislation. 
They 
weren’t partisan pieces of legislation. 
They weren’t rushed through by Demo-
crats and, in fact, a Republican Presi-
dent had to sign all four of those bills. 
The first one, an $8.3 billion bill, four 
times what the President asked for, 
but ultimately, he said, yes, we need 
that much, and that was way, way, way 
too little. But we thought it was a huge 
sum of money at that point in time. It 
passed 415–2. 
On March 14, we passed the Families 
First Coronavirus Response Act, 363–40. 
On March 27, just a few days—this is 
all within weeks of one another, we 
passed the CARES Act, about $2 tril-
lion, voice vote, $2 trillion, about the 
same amount as this bill suggests. 
Frankly, since that time, we have had 
hundreds of thousands of Americans 
die from COVID, and our economy go 
up and down, but now it is tanking, and 
we are all concerned about that. 
George Bush came to the House when 
I was majority leader the first time 
and said, we need $700 billion, actually, 
a little more than that, $700 billion to 
loan to big banks. Loan to big banks? 
And Ben Bernanke, then the chair of 
the Federal Reserve said, if you don’t 
do it, we are going to go into a depres-
sion. 
So what happened, Mr. Speaker, was 
Democrats carried that bill for George 
Bush, a Republican President, and Re-
publicans gave him one-third of their 
votes, their President—he was our 
President, but theirs in the sense he 
was a Republican. 
So I am a little frustrated when I 
hear, well, we can’t do this because we 
passed the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram and Health Care Enhancement 
Act, very controversial, a big bill, 388– 
5. Now, what does that tell you? What 
does it tell the American people? That 
there was a consensus that it is a crisis 
in America that there is no example for 
it in the past. And so we need to move. 
We had an election. The President of 
the United States said we had to move, 
and we passed a $900-plus billion bill, 
and the President said, by the way, it 
wasn’t enough. He wanted to see more. 
He wanted to see substantially more in 
payments to the American people be-
cause they were struggling. 
So, Mr. Speaker, this is a continu-
ation of what has, throughout the 
year—we are not yet at the year, the 
first year of COVID, and so far, we have 
dealt with it in a bipartisan way, and 
robustly, because of the magnitude of 
the challenge. 
People are suffering from the most 
severe public health emergency in our 
lifetimes and the worst economic crisis 
since the Great Depression, and they 
are looking to Washington for help. 
After we enacted, Mr. Speaker, the 
CARES Act in March 2020 to get Amer-
ican workers, businesses, and commu-
nities through the spring and summer 
months, the Trump administration and 
Republican-controlled Senate hit the 
pause button. 
We passed the Heroes Act May 15. We 
then waited and waited and tried to ne-
gotiate. Mr. MCCONNELL said, no, let 
the States go bankrupt. And Mr. 
MCCARTHY said, let’s see what happens. 
And tens of thousands, hundreds of 
thousands of people died, and the econ-
omy has regressed. 
That pause crippled our Nation’s re-
sponse, both to the public health emer-
gency and the economic one as sup-
ports authorized by the CARES Act 
faded. 
While we were finally able to reach 
bipartisan agreement on COVID–19 re-
lief at the end of December, December 
16, to be exact, much damage had been 
done and we knew, we knew, we all 
knew that the December legislation 
would not be enough, Mr. Speaker, and 
that we would have to act again. Now 
we are doing so. 
Now, very frankly, when we were at 
the greatest recession, not depression, 
in December of 2007, and then 2008, and 
then when we took over and could act 
on a relief bill, we passed a $787 billion 
bill, relatively small by the kinds of 
sums we are talking about now, and it 
saved us from depression, and not a 
single Republican in the House of Rep-
resentatives voted for that. 
Now, remember, 172 Democrats voted 
for George W. Bush’s TARP legislation. 
Not a single Republican stepped in to 
help the American economy, not one. 
So when I hear about bipartisanship, I 
think to myself, gee, I am for biparti-
sanship, and we will all be for it. And I 
will tell you, the proof of the pudding 
is those 172 votes that voted for TARP; 
and without TARP, I think the country 
would have gone into depression. 
Now, President Biden has outlined 
the next steps we need to take as part 
of the American Rescue Plan. The 
budget resolution before us today pro-
vides us with one path to put that plan 
into action with the next round of 
major relief for our people. 
The gentleman from Texas lamented, 
well, this is a farce. Let me tell you, if 
this farce passes, millions of families 
are going to get thousands of dollars to 
support themselves and buy food and 
pay their mortgage and pay their rent. 
This is very real. 
Now, this is not the only path. Let 
me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we want this 
to 
be 
a 
bipartisan 
endeavor. 
Joe 
Biden’s entire career, which is an ex-
tensive career, shows his bipartisan-
ship, and I hope the discussions be-
tween the President and a small group 
of Senate Republicans will lead to a re-
sponsible and actionable bipartisan 
compromise that can pass the Senate 
with 60 votes and get to the President’s 
desk in the coming weeks. 
But make no mistake; we will not 
seek compromise at the expense of nec-
essary action. The American people 
cannot wait for Republicans to work 
their way through another pause. 
Democrats are taking this step today 
to ensure that we have all the proce-
dural tools necessary to move forward 
with the relief so sorely needed for the 
American people in case the preferred 
path of bipartisanship is unsuccessful, 
particularly because expanded unem-
ployment benefits expire on March 14. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me, to join the chair-
man in a bipartisan way in voting for 
this resolution so we can assure the 
American people that Congress is mov-
ing forward with the relief they need 
and in the timely manner they ought 
to expect. 
If we care about American families, 
if we care about children who are going 
hungry, if we care about renters who 
can’t pay rent and landlords who need 
that rent to pay their bills—now, some 
of them may be giants, but most of 
them are small—this bill cannot wait. 
This bill needs to pass as soon as we 
can possibly pass it. 
I urge all my colleagues, vote for this 
resolution, and let’s take a first, criti-
cally important step to passing this 
bill that will be constructed by 12 dif-
ferent committees here, committees in 
the Senate, and put together, as the 
chairman has just pointed out, and we 
will have to vote on it again as a final 
product, for the people. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 8 minutes remaining. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE), a distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank the distinguished chairman 
of the Budget Committee for the mas-
terful way that he has led the Budget 
Committee and the masterful way that 
he has led this debate. 
In the next couple of months, close to 
600,000 Americans will die; loved ones 
will be forbidden from going to their 
bedside; and some of them will find 
themselves 
lodged 
in 
refrigerator 
trucks. 
Individuals in our districts, like the 
woman in my district, will report that 
she has $8 in her bank account and the 
potential for being evicted. 
Mr. Speaker, what we are doing 
today is a rescue mission, like we need-
ed to do for the fires in California, or

February 3, 2021 
Hurricane Harvey, or like we needed to 
do when I fled the United States Cap-
itol as the planes were hitting the Pen-
tagon in 9/11. This is a rescue mission. 
And I will not take a back seat all 
the years that I have known President 
Biden to ever deny his sincerity about 
bipartisanship. I have worked alongside 
of him. He is the leader who brought us 
out of the depths of depression with the 
automobile collapse. He is the one that 
led us in the recovery act after the de-
bacle of the collapse of Wall Street in 
2007 and 2008. 
I was here when the Secretary of the 
Treasury said, America will not be the 
America that it was, we are going 
down. And so, we need to go big. The 
Secretary of the Treasury says—a re-
nowned economist—says we need to go 
big. 
This is a time for our friends to lis-
ten to Abraham Lincoln: ‘‘The dogmas 
of the quiet past are inadequate to the 
stormy present. The occasion is piled 
high with difficulty, and we must rise 
with the occasion. As our case is new, 
so we must think anew and act anew.’’ 
Our case is new. We are needing the 
$1,400. We are needing the eviction 
moratorium. We are needing unem-
ployment extension. 
And finally, let me say, Mr. Speaker, 
we are needing to ensure that this 
work is done on behalf of the American 
people. We need a rescue mission and 
we need it now. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, on the Budget, and as the Member 
of Congress for a congressional district that 
has experienced the worst of COVID–19 as a 
public health emergency and economic catas-
trophe, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 
11, which reorders budgetary priorities to pro-
vide $1.9 trillion to allow Congress to take im-
mediate and decisive action to crush the virus 
and vaccinate our people, build the economy 
back better, reopen schools, and provide 
needed support and assistance to state and 
local governments that have been asked to do 
too much with too little for far too long. 
So if our Republican colleagues are ame-
nable to reaching an agreement on a legisla-
tive response that is commensurate to the 
challenge facing Americans, nothing in the 
legislation before will preclude that from hap-
pening. 
But have no doubt, if they refuse to be part 
of the solution, the unified and bicameral 
Democratic congressional majority, in coordi-
nation with the new Democratic Administra-
tion, will take the lead and act boldly to ad-
dress and overcome the present crisis. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of the Republican Governor of 
West Virginia who said colorfully just a few 
days ago, ‘‘At this point in time in this nation, 
we need to go big. We need to quit counting 
the egg-sucking legs on the cows and count 
the cows and just move. And move forward 
and move right now.’’ 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion is 
piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with 
the occasion. As our case is new, so we must 
think anew and act anew. 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took 
last December was a step in the right direction 
but only a long-delayed down payment; we 
cannot afford any more delays, especially 
since Republican stalling already caused a 
painful lapse in critical unemployment assist-
ance last year, and additional unemployment 
assistance is set to expire in March. 
That why this resolution, which creates a 
failsafe alternative to debating, voting, and 
passing the American Rescue Act, is abso-
lutely crucial and the right thing to do, right 
now. 
The American Rescue Plan proposed by 
President Biden takes a multiprong approach 
to tackling the public health and economic cri-
ses stemming from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, by an overwhelming margin 
(79 percent), the public wants and is demand-
ing that we act to provide more economic re-
lief to address the damage caused by the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Repub-
licans and Republican-leaning independents 
believe an additional relief package is nec-
essary, while more than nine in ten (92 per-
cent) Democrats and Democratic leaners say 
more coronavirus aid will be needed. 
Even the most conservative Republicans 
favor more relief by a 56 percent–44 percent 
margin. 
Nearly nine in ten of all adults (88 percent) 
in lower-income households say an additional 
package is necessary, while 81 percent of Re-
publicans in lower-income households (81 per-
cent) say additional aid is needed now. 
Let me make clear at the outset Mr. Speak-
er, that nothing in this resolution precludes the 
reaching of a bipartisan and bicameral agree-
ment to pass and fund the President’s Amer-
ica Rescue Plan, which in nearly all material 
respects mirrors the Heroes Act passed by the 
House Democratic majority on May 15, 2020, 
nearly nine months ago, only to languish on 
the Republican Senate Majority Leader’s desk 
while hundreds of thousands of our fellow 
Americans succumbed to the virus and mil-
lions of others lost their livelihoods and busi-
nesses, and everyone faced an uncertain fu-
ture. 
It would send a powerful signal to the Amer-
ican people if our colleagues across the aisle 
would join us in this effort because nothing 
would better show them that elected rep-
resentatives can put partisanship aside and 
put America first. 
And that bipartisan achievement would por-
tend success for similar initiatives in the area 
of infrastructure, energy, national and home-
land security, and criminal justice and immi-
gration reform, all of which I am ready and 
willing to reach across the aisle to find com-
mon ground. 
To beat the virus and safely reopen schools, 
the plan will mount a national vaccination pro-
gram that includes setting up community vac-
cination sites nationwide and makes the in-
vestments necessary to safely reopen schools. 
It will also take complementary measures to 
combat the virus, including scaling up testing 
and tracing, addressing shortages of personal 
protective equipment and other critical sup-
plies, investing in high-quality treatments, and 
addressing health care disparities. 
The American Rescue Plan delivers imme-
diate relief to working families bearing the 
brunt of the crisis by providing $1,400 per per-
son in direct cash assistance to households 
across America, bringing the total (including 
the $600 down payment enacted in Decem-
ber) to $2,000. 
Additionally, the plan will also provide direct 
housing and nutrition assistance to families 
struggling to get by, expand access to safe 
and reliable child care and affordable health 
care, extend and expand unemployment insur-
ance so American workers can pay their bills, 
and give families with children as well as 
childless workers a boost through enhanced 
tax credits. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan 
provides much needed support for commu-
nities struggling with the economic fallout, in-
cluding hard-hit small businesses, especially 
those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and 
ethnic backgrounds that have experienced 
systemic discrimination. 
Finally, the plan also provides crucial re-
sources to protect the jobs of first responders, 
frontline public health workers, teachers, tran-
sit workers, and other essential workers that 
all Americans depend on. 
The 2021 budget resolution is not a com-
prehensive fiscal blueprint for the next 10 
years; it is designed solely to provide the op-
tion of using reconciliation to deliver critical re-
lief and achieve the goals of the American 
Rescue Plan. 
As such, the total spending and revenue 
levels in the resolution simply reflect current- 
law projections adjusted for the estimated 
costs of the American Rescue Plan. 
Once the American Rescue Plan becomes 
law, Congress will begin its work on a forward- 
looking, comprehensive budget resolution for 
2022 that will provide urgently needed eco-
nomic support and address longstanding defi-
cits in our communities and underlying inequi-
ties in our society, which have been so starkly 
revealed and exacerbated by COVID–19. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for its pas-
sage. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I am 
privileged to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY), a distinguished member of 
the Budget Committee.

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
am so proud. Only 2 weeks into the new 
Presidency, we are now moving ahead, 
right now, boldly, to answer the cry of 
the American people and to ultimately 
pass and implement the American Res-
cue Plan. If you don’t hear the cry of 
your constituents, then you aren’t lis-
tening. 
I want to focus on our communities, 
our States, our counties, our cities, 
large and small, that are in a crisis sit-
uation right now. They are starving for 
help to cover the basic costs that they 
have, and we have an opportunity to 
give them $350 billion in relief and 
flexible aid that can be used to make 
sure that our communities stay strong. 
It is not just about budgets, and it is 
not just about employees. It is about 
our constituents who will find that if

we aren’t able to fund the essence of 
what our communities need, then we 
are going to see firefighters lose their 
jobs; we are going to see paramedics 
and police and nurses and teachers and 
sanitation workers not available for 
our communities; and we will see 
towns and counties not able to fund 
their transportation systems. 
It is time for us to act. It is past time 
for us to act. Let’s do it. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SIRES), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, this resolu-
tion is a critical tool that we can use 
to provide relief to millions of Ameri-
cans by passing President Biden’s 
American Rescue Plan. 
COVID–19 has impacted every corner 
of our Nation, taken loved ones from 
us, sickened millions more, shuttered 
small businesses, and pushed hard-
working families into dire straits. 
As we look at the toll this pandemic 
has taken, we must pass an aggressive, 
large-scale response. We cannot con-
tinue in piecemeal relief that falls 
short of addressing the needs of com-
munities in every congressional dis-
trict. 
By setting a reconciliation frame-
work across numerous House commit-
tees, we can craft a plan that will ex-
pand testing and vaccination efforts; 
extend critical lifelines for those who 
have lost their job; support schools, 
local small businesses, and first re-
sponders; and send direct aid to those 
who are struggling. 
The burdens that our Nation has en-
dured over the last year are far too 
high for continued inaction, and I hope 
that my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting this resolution. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. CHU), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of getting the American 
people the help they need and getting 
it to them fast. 
The 
budget 
resolution 
before 
us 
today is simple. It allows Congress to 
act quickly to deliver much-needed as-
sistance to the American people so 
that we can defeat this pandemic. That 
means more survival checks, enhanced 
unemployment benefits, new grants 
and loans for small businesses, State 
and local aid, education funding, faster 
vaccinations, and much more. 
This winter has been the most chal-
lenging period of the COVID–19 crisis. 
People have been driven to desperation 
with skyrocketing cases, hospitaliza-
tions, and 440,000 deaths nationwide. 
But now we see the light at the end of 
the tunnel. 
Every day, over a million more 
Americans receive safe and effective 
vaccines, and that rate is increasing. 
That means that it is absolutely cru-
cial for Congress to act now to provide 
enough stimulus and support so that 
our 
economy, 
healthcare 
facilities, 
local governments, and schools have 
the resources needed to survive and 
begin to recover. 
The urgency can’t be overstated. 
Last year, Republicans allowed unem-
ployment benefits to expire and pushed 
8 million Americans into poverty. By 
acting now, we can avert a repeat of 
this disaster when benefits expire again 
in just 6 short weeks. We can make 
substantial 
improvements 
to 
make 
sure that we have a more inclusive re-
covery that includes low-wage workers 
and immigrant families. 
Let’s pass this bill and truly help the 
American people. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE), another distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman YARMUTH for his lead-
ership in putting forth this budget res-
olution. 
COVID continues to ravage our com-
munities. Black and Brown people have 
been disproportionately impacted the 
hardest. Now that vaccines are being 
distributed, the disparities in who has 
been vaccinated are quite shocking. 
On top of this health crisis is an eco-
nomic crisis. Eight million more fami-
lies have fallen into poverty since May. 
Food banks have lines around the 
block, and 12 million children are going 
hungry. Enhanced unemployment in-
surance expires next month; small 
businesses are going under; and our 
State and local governments are strug-
gling to make payroll for millions of 
essential workers. 
Our constituents and communities 
can’t wait. We have to go big, and we 
have to move fast. 
The relief package enabled by this 
budget resolution is the rescue needed 
to keep people from falling off the cliff. 
It will also allow us to address the 
glaring racial and ethnic disparities in 
our pandemic response. 
Let me tell you, I am one who be-
lieves we should provide ongoing pay-
ments until the end of the pandemic. 
Through no fault of their own, people’s 
lives and livelihoods have been shat-
tered, but we do provide in this pack-
age and in this budget enhanced unem-
ployment insurance and direct pay-
ments. 
We don’t have the luxury of time, nor 
of nickeling-and-diming our constitu-
ents. We must deliver for the American 
people a rescue package that matches 
the scale and the scope of the pain in 
our country. 
Remember, a budget is a moral docu-
ment that reflects our values, which, of 
course, means we must put people first, 
regardless of party affiliation. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, if this Chamber really 
cared about helping the working class, 
we would first call on the schools to re-
open immediately; end the small busi-
ness lockdowns so Americans can get 
back to work; and stop the President’s 
job-killing executive orders, which are 
firing hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans. 
I stand ready, with my colleagues, on 
policies that will help support the 
working class. I look for the oppor-
tunity that we actually come into the 
Budget Committee, where we can work 
together and help the working class. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

tleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER) and

piece of legislation.

Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, for the 
record, nothing in this proposal should 
come as a surprise. The resolution’s 
budgetary target matches the esti-
mated cost of the American Rescue 
Plan, every detail of which was put for-
ward during President Biden’s cam-
paign. Further, many of these provi-
sions have already passed the House 
but languished on Senator MCCON-
NELL’s desk. 
Nothing we are doing here precludes 
a bipartisan deal. But let’s be clear, the 
American people overwhelmingly sup-
port President Biden’s plan. 
And I can assure you they couldn’t 
care less about House procedures. They 
want us to act and get them the relief 
they need now. 
January was the deadliest month yet 
for COVID. Every 28 seconds, an Amer-
ican died from the coronavirus. At that

rate, more than 385 Americans will 
have died while we are debating this 
resolution. 
We cannot afford to slow down. We 
need to hurry the hell up. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I want to begin by recognizing Chair-
man YARMUTH, whose leadership of the 
Budget Committee is so routinely re-
markable that we take it for granted. 
The budget resolution we are voting 
on today will set us on a path to de-
feating the virus and providing urgent 
relief for millions of Americans. 
It is a big moment for this country, 
and this Chamber and Chairman YAR-
MUTH
have handled it with char-
acteristic skill and grace. 
I also want to thank Speaker PELOSI 
for her extraordinary leadership, guid-
ing the House through all the chal-
lenges since this pandemic began and 
now bringing up legislation that is ur-
gently needed and will ultimately sus-
tain millions of Americans during this 
crisis. 
President Biden has called for a 
package that meets the moment, and 
Speaker PELOSI has laid out a path 
that gets us there. The Speaker has 
guided this Chamber brilliantly as we 
passed the Cares Act; provided addi-
tional support to families and busi-
nesses in the spring and fall; and now, 
as we begin the expeditious process to 
beat the virus, get the American people 
the relief they need and deserve. 
I am honored that she has asked me 
to lead the Joint Economic Committee 
this Congress as our country recovers 
and 
rebuilds. 
I 
look 
forward 
to 
partnering with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle on the full range of 
economic challenges and opportunities 
before us. There is so much work to do. 
This legislation will save American 
lives and give tens of millions of Amer-
icans the help they need. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a businessman. 
One of my favorite ideas is: Don’t show 
me your values; don’t tell me your val-
ues; just show me your calendar. 
Well, budgets are a statement of val-
ues. If you want to know what a person 
or a party really believes, look at how 
they allocate their resources. Show me 
your budget. 
Four years ago, the Republicans held 
the White House, the Senate, and the 
House of Representatives. Their signa-
ture legislation was a $1.9 trillion tax 
cut bill, which overwhelmingly favored 
the wealthy, the top 10 percent. That 
was a statement of their values. 
Today, Democrats have the responsi-
bility of governing, with Joe Biden in 
the White House and majorities in the 
House and Senate. We declare different 
values. The most important value is to 
save American lives. The second most 
important value is to restore American 
prosperity. 
The budget resolution we consider 
today is a critical first step to achiev-
ing both overarching goals. We have to 
act quickly because those aren’t the 
only overwhelming goals that we are 
facing. 
Climate change. Secretary Yellen, in 
her confirmation hearing, called cli-
mate change an existential threat fac-
ing the globe. She is right, and we 
can’t waste any more time. Tempera-
tures are rising. Glaciers are melting. 
The frequency of forest fires is increas-
ing, as is the frequency of once-in-a- 
hundred-year storms. Carbon emissions 
are out of control. 
Soon, scientists say, we will reach a 
point of no return. Many believe we 
may already be there, and it doesn’t 
help that the previous administration 
spent 4 years pretending that climate 
change didn’t exist. 
b 1545 
And infrastructure: Despite years of 
‘‘infrastructure weeks,’’ we haven’t 
moved the ball on infrastructure at all. 
This harms our country in countless 
ways, not the least of which it makes 
the United States less competitive 
around the world. Bad for business, bad 
for consumers, harmful to the next 
generation. 
Our roads are filled with potholes. 
Our 
bridges 
are 
falling 
down. 
Broadband doesn’t reach millions of 
Americans and is priced out of reach 
for millions more. And on and on. 
We have the opportunity to build 
back better a more equitable, inclu-
sive, sustainable, and green economy. 
But we need policies that are aligned 
with the priorities and the needs of 
middle-class families, not geared to-
ward the wealthy and the well con-
nected. 
This budget resolution reflects deep-
ly held American values, preserving 
lives and health, and creating pros-
perity for every American. It reflects 
who we are, all Americans, and it de-
serves our complete support. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, first, because I don’t 
get the chance to do this very often, 
this is the Joint Economic Committee. 
We are basically here to talk about the 
economic impact of this piece of legis-
lation. I am joyful to have Mr. BEYER 
as my opposite. He is someone who I 
truly respect intellectually. If he sug-
gests you read a book, grab it. 
But this is one of those occasions 
where, having sat through the Com-
mittee on the Budget’s testimony dis-
cussion, I am both frustrated and a lit-
tle heartbroken on the number of 
things that were said that actually 
weren’t mathematically true or policy 
true or accurate. I am hoping that 
those of us on the Joint Economic 
Committee can actually raise the level 
of this argument and this discourse to 
being hyperfactual because we need to 
get this right. 
Do understand that a $1.9 trillion 
bill, if you do the interest, is $2.4 tril-
lion to $2.5 trillion. So we need to start 
getting our understanding of the types 
of dollars we are talking about. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t intend to stand 
here and just do a bunch of responses, 
but here’s the quarterly from the Cen-
sus Bureau about State and local reve-
nues and resources: A 17.7 percent in-
crease in receipts. 
Now, your State might not be that, 
but 17.7 percent from the Census Bu-
reau, their latest document. 
And if you have one of the munici-
palities that is hurting, that has a 
shortfall, there is still $58 billion sit-
ting in the account that hasn’t been 
spent, yet we are talking about adding 
another $1.9 trillion in spending. 
Until we also take a moment and un-
derstand the almost $1 trillion still sit-
ting in the accounts that haven’t been 
released or spent, part of this argu-
ment we are having today is absolutely 
absurd. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
quick response to my dear friend from 
Arizona. While we acknowledge that 
many of the States actually had in-
creased revenues last year, virtually no 
locality did. I represent Northern Vir-
ginia, a fairly wealthy part, yet every 
one of our local governments is getting 
creamed. We had 1.3 million job losses 
in State and local government in 2020. 
That is not nothing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
POCAN), the immediate past chair of 
the Congressional Progressive Caucus 
and the most distinguished magician in 
the U.S. House. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, the Amer-
ican people are hurting, and they need 
our help now. Millions have lost their 
jobs over the past year through no 
fault of their own, and more than 
100,000 small businesses have been 
forced to close forever due to COVID– 
19. The House has tried to do the right 
thing. We passed multiple relief pack-
ages last year that began to approach 
the scale needed to address the suf-
fering in our communities, only to 
meet resistance from MITCH
MCCON-
NELL’s Senate and the Trump adminis-
tration. 
Let’s be honest, the Federal Govern-
ment’s handling of this pandemic has 
been largely inept. The previous ad-
ministration said it was just the flu, 
that it would pass before we knew it, 
that injecting ourselves with unproven 
substances would take care of the prob-
lem. 
Extend that magical thinking to 
testing and vaccine distribution and it 
is easy to see why the American people 
and the economy are in crisis today. 
Now those same magical thinkers tell 
us that more aid for people suffering 
across the Nation is not needed. 
The Congressional Budget Office told 
all of us on Monday that the Nation’s 
unemployment rate will not return to 
prepandemic levels throughout the rest 
of this decade. This decade. 
Let’s stop nickel-and-diming our re-
sponse to this once-in-a-century pan-
demic. Let’s follow the advice of al-
most every major economist who has

February 3, 2021 
urged us to act big. Doing too little is 
the real threat we face. 
State and local governments have 
been providing tests and assisting in 
vaccine distribution, all while losing 
tax revenue. They need our help. 
The unemployed are at risk of losing 
their homes, and working people are 
going hungry. They need our help. 
Small businesses have lost demand at a 
time they need it most to keep people 
employed. They need our help. 
I am proud to support additional di-
rect payments to individuals, aid for 
schools, aid for State and localities’ 
public health programs. I am proud to 
support more aid for struggling small 
businesses, 
addressing 
our 
long-
standing 
need 
for 
widespread 
broadband access, and minimum wage 
that ensures no full-time worker in 
America lives below the poverty line. 
Let’s do this. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the resolution be-
fore us. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, just 
a couple points. There is still $280 bil-
lion sitting in the payroll protection 
account. There is still $239 billion sit-
ting in the health spending account. I 
am someone who, on a personal level— 
and I believe our Republican side of the 
Joint Economic Committee—believes 
we need to probably spend more, but it 
needs to be properly targeted so we get 
the impact. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today because people are hurting, 
small businesses are struggling to keep 
their doors open, and livelihoods are on 
the line. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has taken 
more than 440,000 lives to date. It has 
taken the life of my mother-in-law, and 
I am sure many of my colleagues’ loved 
ones, too. 
Now is the time for unity. Now is the 
time to come together. Now is the time 
to put down our partisan words and 
show that Congress can work together 
for the American people. 
Bypassing the chance for bipartisan-
ship is not the way to bring relief to 
the American people or to bring unity. 
I came to Congress to break the par-
tisan gridlock, but the reconciliation 
process drives us farther apart. 
We should strive to focus on issues 
that we all can get done, like providing 
$160 billion targeted funding for vac-
cine distribution and to reopen our 
schools safely, not a wish list to ad-
vance our other priorities unrelated to 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The Federal Government has also yet 
to spend about $1 trillion provided by 
the COVID–19 relief bills passed last 
year. Think about that: $1 trillion 
unspent. 
So I ask my colleagues, before we 
rush through more trillion dollars, 
let’s first have a real bipartisan discus-
sion so we can ensure that our commu-
nities with the most need are getting 
the relief right away. 
Instead, 
Democrats 
are 
throwing 
away the chance to work with Repub-
licans to get things done, provide our 
constituents with relief, and bring our 
country together. The only way we will 
get through this pandemic and get 
things done is by working together. 
Our constituents, the Nation, and the 
world are watching. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, let me just 
point out that we are not throwing 
away our chance to work with Repub-
licans. We would love to have a bipar-
tisan bill, but if it’s not possible, we 
have to have this reconciliation proc-
ess in place because it takes weeks to 
unfold. 
Mr. Speaker, we are in a deep hole. 
To build back better, we have to crush 
the virus, as Speaker PELOSI so beau-
tifully captured. But make no mistake, 
the COVID–19 pandemic has plunged us 
into a very, very big hole. 
Last week, we got the advance—or 
first—report on 2020 GDP, and it was 
ugly. The economy shrank by 3.5 per-
cent last year, the worst economic per-
formance since 1946. Very few of us 
were even born the last time our econ-
omy declined by this much. Let me say 
it again, the U.S. economy is the weak-
est it has been since the end of World 
War II. 
It could have been worse. It could 
have been much worse but for the ac-
tions we took in a bipartisan way in 
this Congress. We passed the CARES 
Act in May, and instead of the 5.6 per-
cent decline the CBO had forecast, we 
only got 31⁄2 percent. Just imagine if 
the Senate had taken up the Heroes 
Act that we passed. Unemployment in-
surance alone, which was strengthened 
with the $600 supplemental payment 
and the creation of pandemic unem-
ployment assistance, accounted for 
more than $550 billion in personal in-
come in 2020. These payments were a 
lifeline to individuals, and they bol-
stered the economy. 
We lost huge amounts of ground in 
the spring when second quarter GDP 
declined at a record 31.4 percent rate. 
That 4 percent in the fourth quarter 
helped, but not nearly enough to get us 
out of the hole. 
As Fed chair Powell and others have 
made clear, the risk isn’t doing too 
much. The risk is doing too little. This 
budget resolution before us recognizes 
that reality and uses it as a starting 
point. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY), 
the distinguished chair of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, a member of the 
Joint Economic Committee, and my 
dear friend. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, what I 
am going to say is for the American 
people because, for the past year, 
American people’s lives and livelihoods 
have been turned upside down because 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Whether contracting the virus, losing 
their jobs, working on the front lines, 
at the risk of eviction or struggling to 
keep their businesses open, many of my 
constituents—Republican constituents, 
Democrat 
constituents—have 
been 
forced to make unimaginable decisions 
and sacrifices. 
In response, Congress passed the 
strong bipartisan CARES Act. How-
ever, 10 months later, the virus is still 
wreaking havoc on our way of life, in 
large part due to the failures of the 
prior administration. 
So we are here to right the wrongs, 
and under the leadership of Speaker 
PELOSI and the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration, we are doing just that. We 
must meet the moment and bookend 
this pandemic with a big, bold package 
to ensure workers, families, and small 
businesses have the support and re-
sources to break through the dark win-
ter and start the process to build back 
better. 
Think about this, Mr. Speaker: The 
budget reconciliation will pave the way 
to doing just that. 
Who is against extending emergency 
unemployment? Who is against pro-
viding another round of direct stim-
ulus? Who is against offering rental as-
sistance to ensure that no family is 
forced to live on the streets? Who is 
against instituting a quicker rollout 
and production of vaccines after the 
disastrous rollout, or lack thereof, by 
the previous administration? Who is 
against expanding funds for child care 
and increasing the child tax credit? 
Who is against giving aid to the very 
States that we represent and local-
ities? 
So I say to my colleagues: Think 
about what your constituents have 
called for. Think about what they are 
losing, and let’s give our constituents 
hope. Let’s join together to meet the 
moment; not for us, but for the Amer-
ican people, for the economy, and for 
the future. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say that Congresswoman 
BEATTY has a great mask. It is wonder-
fully sparkly. 
I did want to share one thing very, 
very quickly. This is our CBO projec-
tion of where we are at right now. With 
the moneys that have already been au-
thorized right now, by the end of this 
year, we will be close to a 4 percent 
GDP growth. So last quarter wasn’t 
anywhere where we wanted it. The 
quarter before that was miserable. But 
you have to understand that this is 
where we are at. 
We keep hearing our fellow Members 
make comments, saying the econo-
mists said, ‘‘Go big.’’ But if you actu-
ally listen to their second line, mul-
tiple economists said, ‘‘Go big, but go 
targeted.’’ 
This document isn’t targeted. It is all 
over the board. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES). 
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, in addition 
to treating and vaccinating for COVID, 
our main priority should be getting 
people back to work. This legislation 
doesn’t do that. It is full of job-killing 
mandates and liberal special interest

handouts. So it keeps schools closed. 
Operation Warp Speed was such a great 
development to get the vaccine rolled 
out there so we can get the economy 
going. 
b 1600 
But one of the things that this reso-
lution does, it bails out States that 
help top off their tax revenue for 2020. 
However, in my State of Kansas, the 
2020 revenues are already higher than 
the 2019 revenues, including in our just 
completed month of January, 10 per-
cent higher than a year ago. 
So 
the 
States 
aren’t 
suffering 
through the revenue loss because of the 
ability for people to still continue to 
grow and work as they can. 
But the resolution does raise ex-
penses for Main Street, nearly doubling 
the Federal minimum wage at a time 
when thousands of small businesses are 
already struggling to keep the lights 
on. This legislation also fails to recog-
nize, as mentioned earlier, that there is 
nearly $1 trillion left from the previous 
COVID bills that Congress has already 
passed. 
By the way, these were five bipar-
tisan bills that were passed in 2020 in 
order to make sure that it addressed 
all of the issues that we reflect across 
our country. The Biden administration 
should instead be focused on families 
who are hurting the most, targeting, 
particularly, the more than 8 million 
people who have lost their jobs due to 
COVID. 
Workers, families, and small busi-
nesses don’t need more Washington 
regulations or mandates. They need to 
have the economy up and running 
again. Republicans believe we must in-
crease wages and job opportunities for 
all workers, and we have gotten real 
results with tax and regulatory re-
forms, achieving historic surges in jobs 
and wages. 
Unfortunately, this legislation does 
not build off of that successful play-
book, but, instead, shows that the 
Biden administration is far more inter-
ested in advancing a radical leftwing 
wish list over our common economic 
policies that will help our Main Street 
businesses and families. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I would agree with all of those econo-
mists who say go target, go big, and go 
targeted. In fact, that is what Joe 
Biden has said again and again. 
I think his speech on the American 
Recovery Act was extraordinarily tar-
geted, and while this budget reconcili-
ation bill is the big picture, we all 
know that by the time we pass those 
individual budgets, they will be tar-
geted at the most granular level. 
And to my friend, Mr. ESTES, with 
whom I serve on Ways and Means, I am 
glad that Kansas is doing well. I don’t 
know the answer to this, but I would go 
back and see how it is going in Wichita 
and some of those local governments. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), one 
of the leaders in so many different 
ways of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the former mayor of Providence. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I rise 
in strong support of the budget resolu-
tion for fiscal year 2021. 
It has been said that a budget isn’t 
just a series of numbers on a sheet of 
paper, it is a statement of your values. 
Well, if that is true, then this budget is 
a bold statement of our values as 
Democrats. This budget paves the way 
for a landmark COVID–19 rescue plan. 
It delivers a simple message to the 
American people: Help is on the way. 
Mr. Speaker, since the start of this 
pandemic, tens of millions of Ameri-
cans have been infected. Nearly half a 
million have died, with almost a quar-
ter of all deaths happening in the last 
month alone. Millions of Americans 
can’t find work. It is getting harder 
and harder to pay for food and housing. 
Schools are closed. Kids are being left 
behind. The American people can’t af-
ford any more delays or half measures. 
This is a time for bold action. That is 
why we have to pass this budget resolu-
tion and pave the way for President 
Biden’s American Rescue Plan, an ag-
gressive proposal that tackles our pub-
lic health and economic emergencies. 
The President’s American Rescue 
Plan meets the crisis before us. It in-
cludes nearly $2 trillion for a new 
round of survival checks; a national 
vaccination program; the resources cit-
ies and towns need to safely reopen 
schools; direct housing and food assist-
ance; expanding access to healthcare 
and safe and reliable childcare; ex-
tended and enhanced unemployment 
insurance; paychecks for the first re-
sponders, public health workers and 
teachers who are still on the front lines 
of this crisis; and critical support for 
the hardest-hit small businesses. 
During this historic crisis, the Amer-
ican people deserve to know that help 
is on the way. This resolution does just 
that. We all know from listening to our 
constituents how much suffering is 
happening in this country, and that we 
need a response that responds to the 
gravity of the economic healthcare cri-
sis that this pandemic has created. 
This resolution does it. Join us in this 
effort. Respond to the cries of the 
American people. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Once again—and I am probably going 
to keep making this point over, and 
over, and over—I care deeply and am 
desperately concerned particularly for 
the poor and the working poor in this 
country. And this document, if we are 
going to be honest about it, does not 
target their suffering. 
I will show a couple of boards here 
where, once again, we are going to be 
sending stunning amounts of money to 
places that it is just going to sit in a 
bank account. It is going to go to 
places where it is not actually creating 
that velocity, that multiplier effect of 
helping those who are suffering. 
And do understand—this is impor-
tant—there is still $172 billion sitting 
in the disaster loan accounts. There is 
another $172 billion still sitting in the 
unemployment 
insurance 
accounts 
from things we have already done to-
gether. 
In that case, it is not completely—I 
don’t want to use the word ‘‘disingen-
uous’’—but some of the things we are 
saying here that, yes, there is a crisis 
out there, and, yes, there is actually 
money sitting in the accounts. Get 
that damn money out of those ac-
counts to where the suffering is. 
And with that I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the first 
time as a Member of Congress in com-
plete opposition to the budget rec-
onciliation act. 
Today, adding almost $2 trillion to 
the national debt and eliminating 1.3 
million jobs is up for a vote. 
This partisan budget reconciliation 
package allows President Biden to 
shove $1.9 trillion of stimulus spending 
through Congress without any Repub-
lican consent. It is a blue State bailout 
to States who have shut down their 
business, closed their places of worship, 
and prevented families from earning an 
honest living. 
We don’t need bailouts. We need to 
get back to work. Taxpayers in States 
like Texas should not be left holding 
the bag for the failing governments in 
New York, California, and others who 
chose to close their economies. 
Congress just passed a $900 billion 
stimulus package in December, and 
over $1 trillion in COVID relief has yet 
to reach its intended recipients. The 
U.S. is already over $26 trillion in debt 
and counting. 
This is totally unsustainable and will 
have a disastrous consequence for our 
economy and future generations. We 
are talking about the future of our 
children and our grandchildren. Noth-
ing could be more important in this de-
cision. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would first like to 
welcome our new colleague from Texas 
to the floor. An excellent speech. 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. PETERS), a mem-
ber of the Joint Economic Committee 
and a distinguished businessperson in 
his own right. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
When Congress passed the emergency 
COVID bill in December, we knew more 
resources would be needed to fight the 
virus and provide additional relief for 
many Americans who have been dev-
astated financially. Now we are work-
ing to accomplish that by March 14 
when the enhanced unemployment ben-
efits will expire. 
I fully support the beginning of the 
process of budget reconciliation be-
cause we need to start the clock. In my

experience in Congress, and yours, too, 
we all know that this place works 
much better with a deadline. 
However, I would hope that we can 
respond to this challenge in a bipar-
tisan way as we did last March and 
again in December, and maybe this 
proposal could be better targeted. 
I am encouraged by the $600 billion 
proposal of 10 Republican Senators. 
Some have scoffed at this offer, called 
it an insult, or dismissed it as not seri-
ous. I don’t agree with that. $600 billion 
is a lot of money, but it is not adequate 
for the task at hand. We need more 
help to open schools and to keep people 
housed. State and local governments 
need assistance to prevent more layoffs 
and make up for lost revenue, and we 
should stop guessing how long we will 
need unemployment and food assist-
ance. 
As the New Democrat Coalition has 
advocated from the beginning, we 
should enact automatic triggers to 
keep them flowing and then shut them 
off according to economic conditions. 
Our biggest challenge as a nation is 
not one particular issue, but the deep 
division among us here in Congress and 
among citizens across America. Bipar-
tisanship has intrinsic value and we 
should prioritize it. But today’s action 
will ensure that we have a relief pack-
age on time no matter the politics. 
This is a step we have to take. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, maybe I am going to 
break protocol, but I am finding that 
this will be the second time I think I 
have complimented someone on the 
Democratic side. Triggers make a lot 
of sense in this type of mechanism 
when you have, functionally, $1 trillion 
still sitting in the accounts, and we are 
seeing projections from CBO saying, 
functionally, by the fourth quarter—I 
am sorry, I didn’t have a chance to 
print this large—but by the fourth 
quarter, unemployment—look, I am 
one of those who believes full employ-
ment is always the ultimate goal—but 
unemployment will be back to where 
basically we were in 2015–2016. 
Can we do better? Absolutely. But to 
do better, it is going to require 
thoughtful, 
targeted, 
well-designed 
spending, of our resources, our stat-
utes. And one of the reasons I talk 
about that is there is something very 
unique going on. And I hope our chair-
man of the Joint Economic Committee 
will actually think about this because 
we haven’t figured out how to turn this 
one into being partisan yet. I am sure 
we will figure it out. 
But right now, this is the sort of 
thing we should be talking about. 
There is this crazy renaissance going 
on in this country of people starting 
new businesses, filing new LLCs, start-
ing new concerns. 
Now, it may be because of the trag-
edy of the business they have right now 
which has been crushed by the shut-
downs and the virus, but there are a re-
markable number of new concerns be-
ginning. 
Wouldn’t it be both elegant, but also 
very powerful, as we watch unemploy-
ment, to find ways to access capital; 
access to streamlined permitting, li-
censing; crazy things like allowing 
someone to do a microbusiness out of 
public housing, things that actually 
have impact. 
And it turns out, those aren’t the 
sort of things you find in a $1.9 tril-
lion—functionally $2.5 trillion if you 
are going to be honest about the real 
cost—spending package. And I under-
stand this is a piece of legislation that 
if you actually look at it, it is just 
line, after line, after line, after line of 
numbers. 
If this passes—which it probably will, 
you know, the Democrats are in the 
majority—the ethical, moral obliga-
tions we have heard from multiple 
speakers here that a budget is your 
values, is the value the fact you can 
spend stunning amounts of money even 
when there is $1 trillion still sitting in 
the bank unspent, or is the value that 
you are going to do it in a way where 
we impact the working poor; where we 
impact those who are truly suffering, 
and not crushing someone like my 5- 
year-old daughter who is the one who 
is ultimately going to be paying this 
back. 
So if we are going to make the moral 
argument, I hope we think about the 
whole, shall we say, continuum of what 
we do here, what is moral, what is 
right. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, can I ask 
how much time is remaining on our 
side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The gentleman from Vir-
ginia has 15 minutes remaining. The 
gentleman from Arizona has 17 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, to my new 
friend from Texas, I would point out 
that Texas and California and New 
York—two 
of 
the 
bluest 
States 
around—are all net exporters of Fed-
eral dollars mostly to red States. 
Now, it tends to be the blue States 
who are helping out the red States in 
terms of our Federal allocations. I 
would also like to compliment the 
ranking member on the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee for his optimism in 
having a 5-year-old daughter. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
TLAIB), 
the 
distin-
guished Member who spent her life lift-
ing people out of poverty. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, this pan-
demic has taken the lives of nearly 
16,000 Michiganders with 25 percent of 
the deaths from Wayne County and the 
city of Detroit. 
Our 
communities 
are 
forever 
changed. The U.S. is on a course to 
reach 500,000 deaths by February 20. 
That is a half a million lives lost. 
And in response to this record death 
toll, Congress has sent out one $1,200 
check almost a year ago and another 
$600 check, for a total of $1,800. That is 
an average of $163 per month. 
Mr. Speaker, there is not a single 
person in this Chamber or in my dis-
trict who can survive on that little per 
month. My residents cannot afford to 
wait. The bills don’t stop after 1 
month; neither should the checks. The 
budget resolution ensures that we can 
do the work of delivering urgent relief 
to our families and every single dis-
trict across the country. 
b 1615 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, in 
many ways we are all saying the same 
thing. It is just, once again, trying to 
make the argument, if we do this 
smartly and well-targeted, we can do it 
for a dramatically more efficient cost 
and actually help more of the poor that 
we know are suffering, more of the peo-
ple who have been crushed, more of the 
small businesses. 
And a simple example, Opportunity 
Insights has predicted that, with a 
$2,000 check to functionally every 
household that makes less than $46,000, 
only $420, functionally, of what they 
receive will get spent. The rest goes in 
the bank. Maybe that is a good thing. 
Maybe that is the audience you want 
to target. But when you start doing the 
same thing to populations, and for 
some reason they use $78,000, only $105 
gets spent. So think of that. 
Mr. Speaker, increase the check an-
other $1,400, a population that makes 
$78,000 or more, they are only spending 
$105. The rest is going in the bank ac-
count. Maybe that is wonderful, but 
that is not what we are debating. We 
are trying to create a multiplier effect 
of some stimulus in our society to get 
the economy going so we see those 
GDP numbers go up; the unemploy-
ment go down; and we get back to the 
miracle we were at in 2018 and 2019, 
where income and equality actually 
shrank for the first time in 2 years, 
where food insecurity shrank for the 
first time in decades and decades and 
decades, where the working poor actu-
ally were doing better than they had in 
decades and decades and decades. 
How do we get back to, functionally, 
what was the miracle of 2018 and 2019? 
And my argument is, the model that 
we are reading in this resolution, isn’t 
it. It doesn’t get you there. If we truly 
have the same goal, I desperately hope 
our friends on the left and those of us 
on the right, who actually want to look 
at this almost like an economist of a 
laser beam, are saying: Let’s find those 
who are hurting and find out how to 
get the resources that are already ap-
propriated and get those to them, and 
then appropriate more where nec-
essary. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, last sum-
mer, when Donald Trump was pres-
suring governors to ignore the advice 
of health experts and reopen their 
economies, he was predicting we would

lead to a ‘‘V-shaped’’ recovery, in 
which the recovery would be as steep 
as the catastrophic decline. 
Others predicted a ‘‘U-shaped’’ recov-
ery, a more drawn-out version of the 
‘‘V.’’ And even others predicted a ‘‘W- 
shaped’’ recovery, an uptick, followed 
by another drop due to a probable sec-
ond wave of the coronavirus, and then 
hopeful 
improvement. 
Even 
Ian 
Bremmer talked about a scalloped re-
covery. 
Mr. Speaker, there has been recov-
ery, but with two big caveats. It has 
been a ‘‘K-shaped’’ recovery. It has 
come at the cost of over 440,000 Amer-
ican lives. 
As the Trump administration pres-
sured States to relax measures needed 
to control the coronavirus, the virus 
exploded. And this does have incredibly 
long-term cost on families, on genera-
tions in the economy. 
But this ‘‘K-shaped’’ recovery, which 
has really come into vogue right now, 
is some are doing quite well and some 
are doing pretty poorly. High-income 
workers have been able to work from 
home and save record amounts of 
cash—I think a 33 percent savings rate 
in the second quarter. 
The savings rate has gone through 
the roof because the paychecks, the 
stock gains, have kept coming in for 
those folks; but they can’t spend it on 
restaurants 
or 
movies 
or 
travel, 
flights, entertainment. 
American billionaires picked up $1.9 
trillion in net worth in 2020. Just the 
increase in billionaires’ net worth 
alone would pay for this package. The 
personal savings rate more than dou-
bled in 2020. Housing prices climbed 10 
percent in the last year. Stock market 
went up about 15 percent in the midst 
of the crisis. But, remember, the 
wealthiest 10 percent own 84 percent of 
the stocks. So they walked away with 
a vast majority of the stock gains last 
year, as they do every year. 
These factors probably explained why 
households of more than $75,000 in in-
come saved their $600 payments from 
December rather than spent them, as 
revealed in recent Opportunity In-
sights’ data. 
On the other side of the coin, low- 
wage workers have seen unemployment 
drop by 20 to 25 percent, and the unem-
ployment rates for Black and Hispanic 
workers exceeds 9 percent. The rich 
have gotten richer. The poor have got-
ten poorer. And the American Dream 
has become ever-less attainable for too 
many Americans. A ‘‘K-shaped’’ recov-
ery is unacceptable. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), my friend of almost 40 years, 
my godfather. 
Mr. 
CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend for yielding to 
me and for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, when I served in local 
government, I helped write and pass 14 
consecutive budgets—all balanced. And 
what the budget writing process taught 
me was that a budget is a values docu-
ment. 
So what does the budget reconcili-
ation process tell us about our respec-
tive values? 
Well, the last two times the budget 
reconciliation process was used by Re-
publicans, they used it on a $2 trillion 
tax giveaway to the wealthiest Ameri-
cans and corporations and to take 
away healthcare for more than 20 mil-
lion Americans. That was their value. 
The budget we are debating today 
shows the Democrats in Congress are 
going to use every bit of a fight we 
have in us to take decisive and com-
prehensive action to finally end this 
pandemic and alleviate the economic 
pain Americans are experiencing. 
We will not wait and see if another 
100,000 Americans die in a single month 
in order to deliver vaccines and testing 
that we need. We will not wait and see 
if the United States loses another 20 
million jobs, or if the American econ-
omy experiences another record-break-
ing year of GDP contraction. We will 
not wait and see if the U.S. loses an-
other 10 million jobs, or people con-
tinue to go hungry at record numbers. 
We will enact an American rescue 
plan that saves lives and livelihoods. 
Those are our values. 
Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
once again, back to facts over feelings: 
After the tax reform, what did we see 
in our society? 
It was the first 2 years that we actu-
ally saw income and equality shrink in 
modern economic times. I thought that 
was the Holy Grail. 
Did you see what happened to His-
panics, African Americans’ incomes, 
working poor incomes? 
The fact of the matter is, if you tell 
the truth about the post-tax reform 
model—just maybe because I was in the 
room—the top 10 percent actually were 
paying more of the Federal income 
taxes than prior. Yet that somehow 
isn’t the folklore that we so often hear 
from this floor. 
Mr. Speaker, there are couple other 
points I would like to make. And a cou-
ple of this is important because Chair-
man BEYER actually did a terrific job 
touching on some of this. And he was 
making a very powerful point. And, ac-
tually, I hate to say this, he was read-
ing part of my script, which actually is 
a little creepy. 
The total deposits in commercial 
banks, if you take a look at this line, 
have gone up dramatically. It is be-
cause too much of the money that we 
have done bipartisan in the last year to 
help stimulate and save the economy 
ended up in pockets of those very, very 
wealthy, or even medium wealthy, and 
it ended up sitting in the bank and not 
circulating, rotating in the economy 
and helping the workers, helping the 
working poor, helping those who are 
just trying to survive. 
My fear is this budget reconciliation 
document is going to be just a lot more 
of this, if you actually look. The other 
thing is—this is a tough one, and this 
is one I am hoping that the placeholder 
in this document isn’t what the Demo-
crats really are heading towards be-
cause, if it is, you are going to hear 
those who are on our side scream that 
this is a payoff to, shall we say, a con-
stituency that is very supportive of the 
Democrats. 
Mr. Speaker, not been a great year— 
the year 2000, about 350,000 State mu-
nicipal workers lost their jobs. This 
budget reconciliation bill has about 
$350 billion in the line item for that 
population. You do realize that’s $1 
million a job. And if you do the total 
number, it is still $350,000 a job. 
Is that compassion? Or is that lu-
nacy? 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, to add to 
my friend’s charts, let me point out 
that the Congressional Budget Office 
has estimated, without additional re-
sources, investment into the economy, 
it will take until 2024—3 more years— 
just to get back to where we were at 
the prepandemic level 1 year ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN), and not the singer. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in 
2017, when my Republican friends had 
control of the House, the Senate, and 
the Presidency, they passed an approxi-
mately $1.5 trillion tax break for the 
very wealthy. 
Mr. Speaker, the wealthy weren’t 
suffering. There was no pain. They 
were not about to be evicted. There 
were no mortgage payments behind. 
But they got $1.5 trillion approxi-
mately in tax breaks. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my dear friends on 
the other side to see this, if they will: 
As a tax break for the working class, 
let’s let people who are making $75,000 
a year have an opportunity to acquire 
some money to help them. If it goes 
into a bank account, it will come out. 
They are not wealthy. At some point 
we have to realize that those who are 
among the working class cannot do 
more with less, while the wealthy need 
more to do more. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to save 
this country, save these people who are 
suffering. I will vote for this resolu-
tion. I will vote for reconciliation. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
will tell you this: Mr. GREEN also can 
sing, and he is one of those I consider 
a friend. He and I have done a number 
of pieces of legislation, and he and I 
have a running discussion of what ac-
tually helps the working poor. We have 
different views, but we know we both 
have a passion of it. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s actually take sort 
of the theme that has been offered 
here. I believe it is absolutely mathe-
matically wrong, but an argument 
that, Hey, so much of this has helped 
the wealthy in tax reform and those 
things. Great. 
Mr. Speaker, if someone on the 
Democratic side can promise me that 
when I am looking at this budget reso-
lution, this is not creating a policy box 
for the Committee on Ways and Means

to turn around and re-implement pol-
icy where, functionally, the benefit 
goes mostly to the very, very wealthy. 
So when I see the box here that looks 
like it would allow for certain revenues 
to be raised, and then it goes to pos-
sibly a SALT—a State and local tax de-
duction, which we all know the top 1 
percent gets 57 percent of the value of 
it, the bottom 80 percent of our society 
only gets 4 percent of the value—that 
would be, actually, a tax break. Actu-
ally, I think I have been quoted as say-
ing, ‘‘It is the most regressive tax 
break that you can think of in our so-
ciety right now that is in play.’’ 
I am just desperately hoping that 
isn’t what I am reading in some of 
these pages as part of that setup. And 
I would love someone on the left to ba-
sically promise me that we are not see-
ing a setup here to, once again, sub-
sidize the rich. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I had the 
great honor of attending the Arlington 
funeral service for Capitol Police Offi-
cer Brian Sicknick. It was moving and 
very sad, eloquent. I only bring this up 
because I was transported with my 
friend, RALPH NORMAN of South Caro-
lina, to the cemetery and back with 
two Capitol Police Officers who were 
talking about how much they love 
their job but how exhausted they were 
at ages 40 and late 20s. 
I asked them, ‘‘What is your job?’’ 
They said, ‘‘We are security for the 
Speaker.’’ 
And she is indefatigable, tireless, 
works around the clock, and, to my 
mind, is the best Speaker America has 
ever had. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I thank 
him for his great leadership of the 
Joint Economic Committee, a place 
where we can really think in a way 
that is entrepreneurial and successful 
for the American people. His private 
sector experience, as well as respect for 
the public sector and the nonprofit sec-
tor, equips him well to lead that impor-
tant committee and to take us to the 
floor on this bill, following the Budget 
Committee, under the leadership of 
JOHN YARMUTH, a tireless worker for 
the budget and this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe that a budget 
should be a statement of our national 
values. What is important to us as a 
nation should be reflected when we put 
a budget together. 
It is curious to me to hear the distin-
guished gentleman on the other side of 
the aisle. It would be ludicrous if it 
weren’t so deadly serious. 
Mr. Speaker, $1.9 trillion, the Presi-
dent of the United States has deter-
mined is necessary to meet the needs of 
the American people at a time of a pan-
demic, at a time of consequences to our 
economy that are drastic—and I will go 
on to that in a moment. $1.9 trillion, 
which is almost exactly the cost of the 
Republican tax break that they gave to 
the richest people in America; 83 per-
cent of the benefits went to the top 1 
percent. 
b 1630 
This legislation, which helps meet 
the needs of the American people, to be 
considered a tax break bill for the rich, 
it is pathetic. It is pathetic. The fact of 
this Congress is that somebody can say 
things that aren’t true on the floor, but 
if you say that they said something 
that was untrue, you would be called 
out of order. 
But I would just say, the facts are 
these. $1.9 trillion, when you add in the 
interest—Mr. GREEN from Texas ref-
erenced this—if you add in the interest, 
$1.9 trillion, $2 trillion, added to the 
national debt, with no stimulus for our 
economy, only debt for our children. 
Instead, here today, we have a bill 
that meets the needs of the American 
people. In the election, the American 
people cast their ballot for big, bold ac-
tion and decisive leadership to turn the 
coronavirus pandemic and economic 
crisis around. Since then, the need has 
accelerated drastically. The time for 
decisive action is now. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why, today, we 
will pass a budget resolution to pave 
the way for a landmark coronavirus 
rescue, a rescue plan, which will do 
what is needed to save lives and liveli-
hoods. 
We hope that Republicans in Con-
gress would support a legislative pack-
age that will bring real relief to people 
and to our communities. 
Passing this budget does not preclude 
reaching a bipartisan agreement. I 
would rather not work under reconcili-
ation, but if that is the way we have to 
work in order to get results for the 
American people, we must use every 
option at our disposal. But I am hope-
ful that we can have bipartisanship. 
That does not ensure that Congress 
can move forward and meet the coun-
try’s needs. The need for this action 
could not be more urgent, and Ameri-
cans cannot afford to wait. They can-
not afford any further delay. 
Tens of millions of Americans have 
been infected. Nearly half a million 
have died, with one-fifth of those 
deaths occurring over the past month. 
Meanwhile, tens of millions of work-
ers are jobless; food and housing inse-
curity is skyrocketing; and school clos-
ings threaten our children’s education. 
And our most vulnerable communities 
are bearing the brunt of these crises, as 
the underlying health and economic 
disparities continue to grow. 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan will take a comprehensive, stra-
tegic, and science-based approach to 
tackling the public health and eco-
nomic crises. Here is what it will do. 
It will put money in the pockets of 
the American people. It will put vac-
cines in the arms of the American peo-
ple. It will put children back in school 
and workers back to work. 
It will crush the virus and help us 
safely reopen schools, mounting a na-
tional vaccination campaign that in-
cludes community vaccination sites, 
ramping and scaling up testing and 
tracing, addressing shortages of PPE, 
investing in high-quality treatments, 
and addressing healthcare disparities. 
It is sinful, Mr. Speaker, to see how 
few people in our communities of color 
have had access to vaccines up until 
now, but that will change under Presi-
dent Biden and with this legislation. 
It will deliver immediate relief to 
working families bearing the brunt of 
the crisis, providing $1,400 checks per 
person to households across America 
and providing housing and nutrition 
assistance. Tens of thousands of people 
are food insecure in our country. 
Maybe 17 million children are food in-
secure in our country. 
Access 
to 
safe 
and 
reliable 
childcare—let me say it again, safe and 
reliable 
childcare—and 
affordable 
healthcare, expanded unemployment 
insurance, and enhanced tax credits for 
families, low-income working families. 
Finally, the plan will support com-
munities struggling with the economic 
fallout, providing a lifeline for the 
hardest hit small businesses, especially 
those owned by minorities, and hon-
oring our heroes. Yes, $350 billion to 
honor our heroes, about one-fourth of 
what you were giving to the top 1 per-
cent in our country in your tax bill. 
Why is that important? Because 
these are the entities, State and local 
county governments, townships, and 
the rest, that provide the services that 
the people need: healthcare workers, 
first responders, police and fire, trans-
portation, sanitation, food workers, 
our teachers, our teachers, our teach-
ers. They need the State and local gov-
ernments to be funded. That is very 
important. In a bipartisan way across 
the country, it has bipartisan support. 
So, yes, it is $350 billion. 
Again, it is to meet the needs. These 
people risk their lives to save lives, and 
now they may lose their jobs because 
of the cost of the coronavirus and the 
lost revenue from the pandemic. 
Finally, the plan would support com-
munities struggling with the fallout, 
again, providing a lifeline—that is this 
point I am making now—for hardest 
hit small businesses, as I mentioned, 
that are owned by minorities, frontline 
health workers, teachers, transit work-
ers, and other essential workers risk-
ing their lives to save ours. It bears 
repetition. 
The cost of inaction is growing by 
the day. If we don’t enact this package 
now, we could end up with 4 million 
fewer jobs this year, and it could take 
a year longer to return to full employ-
ment. An entire cohort of young people 
may have lower lifetime earnings be-
cause they were deprived of another se-
mester of school. 
Millions 
of 
parents, 
particularly 
moms, can be forced to stay at home, 
reducing their wages and future job 
prospects. I believe the figure is 100

percent. But just about 100 percent of 
the jobs lost in December were women. 
But if this package is passed and en-
acted in full by March, economic 
growth is projected to jump by nearly 
8 percent this year and then by an ad-
ditional 4 percent next year. At that 
pace, we will create 71⁄2 million jobs 
this year alone and a total of 10 million 
jobs by the fall of 2022, reaching full 
employment. 
But don’t take it from me. Experts 
agree that this bold action is needed, 
especially as interest rates are at his-
toric lows and the return on small in-
vestments has never been higher. 
As Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, 
of whom we are very proud, stated: 
Without further action, we risk a longer, 
more painful recession now and long-term 
scarring of the economy later. Right now, 
with interest rates at historic lows, the 
smartest thing we can do now is act big. In 
the long run, the benefits will far outweigh 
the costs. 
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at 
Moody’s Analytics, said just last week: 
It is better to err on the side of too much 
rather than too little. Interest rates are at 
practically zero, inflation is low, unemploy-
ment is high. You don’t need a textbook to 
know that this is when you push on the fis-
cal accelerator. 
Also last week, the Chairman of the 
Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, stat-
ed: 
I am much more worried about falling 
short of a complete recovery and losing peo-
ple’s careers and lives that they built be-
cause they don’t get back to work in time. I 
am more concerned about that and the dam-
age that will do. 
Reconciliation bills have passed on a 
bipartisan basis 17 times in recent 
years, including one that I participated 
in to pass the Children’s Health Insur-
ance Program, CHIP, which delivered 
lifesaving healthcare to nearly 10 mil-
lion children. 
As I said, the need for action could 
not be more urgent. Americans cannot 
afford further delay. 
Listen, listen, listen to your con-
stituents. We should all be listening to 
our constituents. They are our bosses. 
We must meet their needs. 
Listening to our constituents, re-
specting President Biden’s proposal to 
meet their needs, we must work to-
gether to save their lives and their 
livelihoods. 
I wish we could have a strong bipar-
tisan vote on this budget bill because, 
as I said, this budget is a statement of 
our values, and our values are that we 
are here to meet the needs of America’s 
working families. It is about our chil-
dren, their health, their education, the 
economic security of their families, a 
safe world for them to thrive, a world 
at peace in which they can reach their 
fulfillment. It is always about the chil-
dren. 
It is not about heaping mountains of 
debt on them, as they did in their tax 
scam that they passed, and then to 
have the nerve to call this a tax break 
for the wealthy when it has low-income 
tax 
credits, 
childcare 
tax 
credits, 
refundability, billions of dollars for the 
working poor in our country. 
Economists and the Treasury Secre-
taries of both parties have said, if you 
really want to turn the economy 
around, help the neediest the most, 
help the neediest first. We do this in 
this legislation as we bolster the mid-
dle class and crush the virus. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the comment of ‘‘look 
at this budget and see a party’s val-
ues,’’ this may be a little ethereal, but 
have you all heard the term ‘‘blank 
check company’’? It is one of the rages 
on Wall Street right now. Take basi-
cally a shell, have a bunch of money 
put into it, and then they promise, say-
ing, we are going to find something to 
spend the money on. 
This is essentially a blank check 
budget reconciliation with actually 
none of the very elegant and persuasive 
words said. 
There is also one other thing, and I 
want to say this as respectfully as pos-
sible, so I am going to read someone 
else’s words. The well-worn and mis-
leading talking points is 83 percent of 
the tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 per-
cent. Just not true. Since the day of 
tax reform until 2025, the wealthiest, 
and maybe it is too much, get 25 per-
cent. At the very end of tax reform, 
when many of the different tax breaks 
and those things are expiring out, 
there is an anomaly in the year 2027. It 
is not 83 percent. 
Please, I beg of my friends on the 
left, I know we like our talking points, 
but there is a reason the public is so 
enraged with us. It is because we have 
this bad habit of getting behind these 
microphones and playing some real 
games with the facts, and the facts are 
the facts. 
Once again, the blank check com-
pany concept, this is now the blank 
check budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, may I ask 
how much time we have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 61⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ari-
zona has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER), the distinguished 
chairman of the Trade Subcommittee 
on Ways and Means and, in my opinion, 
the most thoughtful Member of the 
House. 
b (1645) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy 
and his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, the hardest hit sector of 
our economy is the 500,000 independent 
restaurants and their 11 million em-
ployees. That is why there are 2.3 mil-
lion of those employees unemployed. 
And one out of six restaurants has 
closed permanently, with the prospect 
of up to 85 percent being lost in the 
year ahead. Sadly, the impact has been 
disproportionately on women, minori-
ties, and immigrants. 
The PPE program didn’t work for 
restaurants. They don’t need com-
plicated loans. They don’t know, in 
many cases, whether they are going to 
be open in 2 or 3 months. 
The restrictions across the country 
are such that most restaurants simply 
do not have a viable economic model. 
That is why I introduced the Res-
taurants Act. I am pleased that $50 bil-
lion has been designated for small busi-
ness in this resolution, and I hope at 
least 50 percent of that will be dedi-
cated to the bipartisan and bicameral 
Restaurants Act that we have intro-
duced. It has over half the Members of 
the House of Representatives cospon-
soring and over half the Senate. 
We have an opportunity to move this 
forward in a way that will give a life-
line to our restaurants that are the 
cornerstone of our community. We give 
them that lifeline, and next year at 
this time most of it will be back to 
normal. They will be vaccinated, the 
weather will change, and we will be 
able to return to that vibrant part of 
our communities. But they need the 
lifeline. 
So I strongly urge support for the 
Restaurants Act which will be reintro-
duced and part of the reconciliation 
process that will make it possible to 
provide that necessary support to keep 
them afloat. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. BEYER) for his cour-
tesy. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, there is one other thing 
I wanted to share. First, the Res-
taurants Act is a good piece of legisla-
tion. I think there are many of us on 
Ways and Means who look forward to it 
or something very, very close to it. 
Also, one other comment, Madam 
Speaker spoke earlier, I was actually 
somewhat enthused about her focus on 
kids in school. As Mr. BEYER teased 
me, I am 58, my wife is 58, and I have 
a 5 year old. That is the ultimate defi-
nition of being optimistic for the fu-
ture. That is funny. 
But the fact of the matter is, I des-
perately hope that Madam Speaker 
will use her influence on the teachers’ 
union to encourage getting these kids 
back to school. I have some charts— 
but I am not going to show them to ev-
eryone because I may save them for 
evening floor time—on the devasta-
tion—and the Speaker actually just 
spoke about this, which is a great 
irony—of what we are doing to the fu-
ture earning power of everyone from 
the parents to the children themselves. 
How many saw the story, I think in 
The New York Times, this last week 
about children suicides in Nevada? 
It rips your heart out. But I don’t see 
it in this budget document. It is not in 
there.

If that is where we are heading, 
great. As Republicans we are going to 
help make good things happen, getting 
these schools open, but we actually 
need the influence from the left, par-
ticularly with the teachers’ union to 
make that a possibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
it has been almost 1 year since COVID 
hit the U.S., and the sick are still split-
ting pills, diabetics are still rationing 
their insulin, and families are doubled 
up in homes to keep relatives off the 
streets. I saw it in 2008, and I am seeing 
it again. Up and down the streets of my 
neighborhood on the southwest side of 
Chicago businesses are closed. Every 
week I am attending another wake. It 
is happening across this country. 
This has been a failure of the Amer-
ican Government. But finally, we have 
a President willing to move a signifi-
cant relief bill. Congress needs to pass 
this legislation and get people the re-
lief that they need now. 
Transit, stimulus checks for working 
people and immigrants, rental assist-
ance and small business grants—we 
can’t nickel and dime our way out of 
this pandemic. Let’s do our job. Let’s 
get the vaccine out, and let’s save our 
economy. We need to pass the $1.9 tril-
lion budget and get the American peo-
ple back on their feet now. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this has been actually a 
reasonable conversation. I desperately 
hope we are going to have more of this. 
But back to some of the principal 
points from the Republican side we are 
trying to share about this budget reso-
lution is the SBA paycheck protection. 
There is still $280 billion sitting in the 
account that hasn’t gone out the door; 
healthcare spending, still has $239 bil-
lion sitting in the account that hasn’t 
gone out the door; economic injury dis-
aster loans, $172 billion still sitting in 
the account that hasn’t gone out the 
door; unemployment insurance expan-
sion, another $172 billion still sitting in 
the account; education funding, $59 bil-
lion sitting in the account; assistance 
to State and local, $58 billion; stimulus 
checks, there is still $52 billion sitting 
in there; food stamps, there is still $33 
billion; 
childcare 
and 
development 
block grants, there is $10 billion sitting 
in that account; agriculture assistance, 
there is still $29 billion sitting in the 
account. That is $1 trillion. 
Is there a need for more help in our 
society? 
Absolutely. 
Does this document actually target 
it to those who are hurting, to the 
working poor, and to those who actu-
ally haven’t gained great wealth with 
the stock market? Are other dollars in 
their accounts? 
I just don’t see it in there. 
And functionally, this is $2.5 trillion 
of spending. When we authorize $1.9 
trillion and then do the interest on it, 
I think that is a fair interest calcula-
tion. 
I beg of us that as this moves forward 
and we actually get to put some policy 
behind these incredibly broad numbers, 
will those of us who actually care 
about math—because the running joke 
in our family is that Daddy works in a 
math-free zone. Somehow, I thought it 
would get a laugh. 
I desperately ask all of us, this is a 
stunning amount of money. I under-
stand the need for the administration 
and the Democrat majority to act like 
individuals of action. 
But what happens when that action 
is theater? 
On the conservative side we want to 
help, but $1.9 trillion isn’t the help. It 
is figuring out where the needs are and 
getting it to them. Instead—and I’ll 
show some of the charts—some of the 
dollar amounts that are in this docu-
ment are absurd and still don’t get us 
what we know we need in our society. 
So as part of my closing here, we 
have $1 trillion already still sitting in 
the accounts that haven’t gone out the 
door. 
What are we doing to get those re-
sources to those who need it? 
Because this is something that we 
could do instantly. The cash is already 
sitting there. It is already authorized. 
But also, what could we do as those 
of us in the Joint Economic Committee 
try to work on math saying: Here is 
how we get the maximum amount of 
stimulus to help those who are hurt-
ing? 
How do we get back to—forgive my 
cheat sheet—how do we get back to an 
environment where, once again, like we 
had in 2018 and 2019, income inequality 
actually shrank for the first time? 
How do we get back to where food in-
security was shrinking and where the 
working poor were getting substan-
tially less poor? 
I know there is a great difficulty for 
my brothers and sisters on the left to 
extend tax reform and regulatory re-
form any credit. Then don’t give it 
credit. But do at least accept we had 
some amazing things happening there 
for a couple of years for the very popu-
lations we come behind these micro-
phones and say that we care about. 
Is there a way that on this left budg-
et document—which is functionally a 
blank check company—being author-
ized to drop $1.9 trillion in immediate 
cash with an ultimate cost of about 
$2.5 trillion, could we actually take a 
look at what was working in our soci-
ety before the pandemic and figure out 
how to do more of what was working 
and take a look at what was done in 
the previous years where we spent lots 
of money and we had almost no multi-
plier effect, none of the folks we were 
trying to help were getting help, and 
do less of this? 
Because this document reads very 
much like we are going back to the bad 
old days of spend lots of money, do 
some great virtue signaling, and, ulti-
mately, the very people we talk about 
are no better off. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, how much 
time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 31⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend, the ranking member, for this 
hourlong discussion. I will point out 
that all those billions and maybe tril-
lions of dollars that apparently are 
still in coffers, one of the best things 
we can do is get new management at 
the executive level who will actually 
spend the money allocated by Con-
gress, and I think the Senate is work-
ing on those confirmations right now. 
There is nothing that has the sense of 
theater about the children in Virginia 
who are three times as food insecure as 
they were a year ago. We have millions 
of Americans out of work. We have this 
remarkable chart that shows that our 
unemployment rate hit an official 14.8 
percent back in the spring, and we 
knew that was undercounted by all the 
people who left the workforce who 
weren’t counted at all. They said it was 
probably closer to 20 percent, the high-
est since the Great Depression. 
Now, we are formally down to 6.7 per-
cent, but, once again, that is double 
the pre-pandemic level and doesn’t cap-
ture the nearly 5 million workers who 
have given up looking for a job and left 
the labor force since February. That 
would push the unemployment rate al-
most at 10 percent. We cannot afford to 
be passive. 
My friend, Mr. SCHWEIKERT, talks 
about the multiplier factor, and I am a 
huge fan of the multiplier effect. But 
the multiplier effect means putting 
money in the hands of people who will 
spend it. So we are in defense of our $15 
minimum wage. That is money that 
will go into the hands of people who 
will spend it that day, that Friday, 
that weekend. 
Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, two 
prominent economists, found that fis-
cal monetary responses in 2008 and 2009 
substantially reduced the severity and 
length of the Great Recession. Our 
wonderful chairman of the Federal Re-
serve, Jay Powell, a Republican, has 
said that monetary policy has gone as 
far as it can. Interest rates are near 
zero. It is up to us now, those who con-
trol fiscal policy, to make this come-
back. 
The Hamilton Project found that the 
Biden proposal would return us to the 
CBO’s pre-pandemic projections after 
the third quarter of this year, not 2024 
which would be where we were without 
it. 
We face a once-in-a-generation chal-
lenge: a public health crisis caused a 
massive economic hit worse than the 
Great Recession, and responding to ei-
ther one of these crises, the COVID or

February 3, 2021 
the economy, requires a smart, multi-
faceted, comprehensive approach. It is 
not a blank-check approach. We have 
outlined piece by piece by piece how 
this money would be spent, and we still 
have much granularity to go. We have 
don’t have the luxury of choosing 
which crisis we respond to. We have got 
to overcome both of them to save the 
lives of hundreds of thousands of Amer-
icans and ensure the livelihoods of mil-
lions more. 
Another luxury we don’t have is 
time. We can’t waste months and 
months and months trying to figure 
out whether we are actually going to 
spend that money in those coffers or 
whether bipartisanship will work. We 
have to set the structure up so that if 
reconciliation is necessary—the same 
reconciliation my Republican friends 
used on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—it 
is ready to go. 
The 
American 
people—Democrats, 
Republicans, Independents, and those 
who don’t fit in any of those groups— 
want us to take action. Giving shots in 
people’s arms, ramping up testing and 
tracing, ensuring unemployment bene-
fits don’t expire on March 14 and that 
they are there when they are needed 
most—I thank the gentleman, by the 
way, Mr. SCHWEIKERT, for piling on 
automatic stabilizers, almost every 
economist I know thinks that is a good 
idea—and helping families put food on 
the table. This is what Americans 
want. We need to move now to get our 
country and our economy back on 
track, and this budget resolution starts 
the process. 
Today, we are taking a very impor-
tant step for the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the 
resolution, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of 
this Budget Resolution. 
The pandemic has left millions of Americans 
hungry, homeless, or unable to make rent and 
mortgage payments. This resolution would 
provide critical support that is, quite literally, 
life or death. 
It’s a time to make life better for Americans 
who are hurting, using every tool available to 
us. 
From extending eviction and foreclosure 
moratoriums, to supporting public transit like 
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority so 
my constituents can still get to work and 
healthcare appointments, we must act holis-
tically. 
Upon passage, the Oversight Committee will 
immediately get to work on one of the most 
important aspects of this package—providing 
desperately needed funding for states, local 
governments, tribes, and territories. 
This money will allow these governments to 
help distribute vaccines, expand testing, keep 
frontline workers employed, and maintain vital 
services. It will also keep our economy afloat 
by allowing states, local governments, tribes, 
and territories to avoid laying off their employ-
ees en masse. 
The Committee will include expanded emer-
gency paid leave for federal employees, avail-
able for those who need to quarantine, isolate, 
or 
need 
to 
provide 
care 
due 
to 
the 
coronavirus. 
We also will include funding for oversight 
and transparency efforts to ensure every tax-
payer dollar included in this package is spent 
on its intended purpose. 
The President’s American Rescue plan 
would deal a decisive blow to this devastating 
pandemic, providing the resources that our 
families, communities, and economy need to 
survive. 
We must do everything we can, as fast as 
we can, to get vaccines in arms, to get re-
sources to struggling communities, and to get 
Americans back to work. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired.

previous question is ordered on the

ELECTING MEMBERS TO CERTAIN 
STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Democratic Caucus, I 
offer a privileged resolution and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 92 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
bers be, and are hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing standing committees of the House of 
Representatives: 
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE: Mr. Panetta. 
COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR: Mr. 
Yarmuth, Mr. Espaillat. 
COMMITTEE
ON NATURAL RESOURCES: Ms. 
McCollum, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Tonko, Ms. Tlaib. 
COMMITTEE
ON
VETERANS’ AFFAIRS: Ms. 
Lois Frankel of Florida, Mr. Brown, Ms. 
Slotkin, Mr. Trone. 
Mr. JEFFRIES (during the reading). 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that the resolution be considered as 
read and printed in the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
COUNTIES AND CITIES NEED 
ASSISTANCE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
today, earlier on the floor, I made one 
important announcement of one impor-
tant number. And I said that what we 
were doing with the budget reconcili-
ation resolution was we were rescuing 
America. Because 594,000 Americans 
are expected to die from COVID–19 by 
May 2021. 
This is what is happening in Texas. 
Half of Texans face financial hardship 
because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The new strain of COVID–19 has come 
to Harris County. We can’t do it alone. 
We need assistance for counties and 
cities. My mayor has been asking, and 
that is what this budget reconciliation 
will do. 
In addition, we must realize that 
roughly 22 percent of Texas residents 
are facing severe hardship. 
This is a catastrophe beyond our un-
derstanding. A pandemic. And my DE-
LIVER Act is ready to provide a dis-
tribution structure so that all over 
America you can get vaccinated. That 
is why we voted on the budget rec-
onciliation resolution; to save lives. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF BILL 
CLINE 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
my dear friend, Bill Cline, of Bradford, 
Pennsylvania, who passed away on De-
cember 29 at the age of 95. 
Bill is survived by his loving wife, 
Joyce, who he spent nearly 50 years 
with; and by daughters Terri Anne, 
Susan, and Mary Jo; and sons Willard 
and Mark. 
After serving in the United States 
Navy during World War II, Bill re-
turned home to chase his dream of one 
day owning his own oil production 
company. He would go on to serve as 
the sole proprietor of Cline Oil, Incor-
porated for more than 60 years and re-
mained the president of the company 
until his death. 
In 1859, Edwin Drake drilled the 
world’s first commercial oil well in my 
district, making history in the energy 
industry. About 7 years ago, I had the 
pleasure of presenting Bill with the 
Colonel Edwin L. Drake Legendary 
Oilman Award to celebrate his con-
tributions to the industry as well. 
Bill will be missed, and Penny and I 
wish his family the very best as they 
honor his life while mourning his loss. 
Rest in peace.

BUILDING A GREENER PLANET 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, cli-
mate change is an existential treat to 
our species. Atmospheric CO2 levels are 
now higher than at any point in the 
last 3 million years. Half of all those 
emissions were released since 1985. We 
are in trouble, and that trouble is ac-
celerating, but addressing that trouble 
is a massive economic opportunity. 
Rather than being paralyzed by fear, 
let’s inspire Americans toward that op-
portunity, because virtually anything 
we do to reduce CO2 emissions makes 
us wealthier. Making heat and power 
without burning fossil fuel means you 
don’t have to pay for fossil fuel. Clean 
energy is cheap energy. 
For those who still like pollution, all 
that future generations ask you is to 
love being rich a little bit more. And 
that is why I was so heartened to see 
President Biden’s recent executive or-
ders procuring clean energy for the 
Federal Government, phasing out mar-
ket-distorting fossil fuel subsidies, in-
corporating the social cost of carbon 
into our decisionmaking, to name just 
a few, and that is just the start. 
Madam Speaker, let us all in this 
body now build on that leadership. Let 
us build back better and build back 
greener. Let us leave our children a 
better planet than the one we inher-
ited. Let us embrace science. But most 
of all, let us lead. 
f 
THE GIFT OF LIFE 
(Mr. CARL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the lives of millions of 
innocent babies who lost their chance 
at life because of Roe v. Wade. 
Life is precious. Life is a gift from 
God, and every human is made in God’s 
image. Every person born, or pre-born, 
has inherent dignity and has the right 
to life. 
We have a fundamental duty to fight 
for the vulnerable and ensure that life 
is protected, recognizing the right to 
life is a worthy cause. It is not radical, 
and it should be bipartisan. 
I am proud to be an advocate for the 
unborn. I firmly believe in our respon-
sibility as a society to defend life. I 
will continue to push for pro-life legis-
lation in Congress, including elimi-
nating the use of taxpayers’ funding in 
any way to perform abortions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in fighting for life 
to protect the most vulnerable among 
us. Together, we can build a culture 
that respects God’s gift. That gift is 
life. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
LIEUTENANT MICHAEL BOUTTE 
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today with a heavy heart. On Feb-
ruary 1, south Mississippi tragically 
lost Hancock County Sheriff Deputy 
Lieutenant Michael Boutte in the line 
of duty. His end of watch was Monday, 
February 1, 2021. 
Madam Speaker, Boutte was a pas-
sionate servant in our community, and 
he will be greatly missed by many. He 
is remembered for his service not only 
as a distinguished law enforcement of-
ficer, but also as an Air Force veteran 
who served in Operation Desert Storm. 
In everything he did, Boutte wore his 
smile with pride and compassion.

A tireless leader in his community, 
Boutte was responsible for organizing 
the Silver Alert system and National 
Crime Night Out for the city of 
Diamondhead. He was also honored 
with the Lifesaving Medal and awarded 
the Officer of the Year Award by the 
Waveland Community Unity Organiza-
tion in 2018. 
Boutte made our community and his 
loved ones immensely proud. Our State 
and our Nation owe him and his family 
a debt of gratitude for his service and 
sacrifices. Let us go forth and carry his 
memory and service in our hearts and 
prayers. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that Members 
in the House Chamber please join me 
for a moment of silence to honor the 
life of Lieutenant Michael Boutte.

ROE V. WADE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. JA-
COBS of California). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. SMITH) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks on the topic of my Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, before yielding to my good 
friend and colleague, there are a num-
ber of Members who will be making 
their way over here. We do have an im-
portant caucus going on, on the Repub-
lican side, and that caucus is very in-
tense; but we will have Members com-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Missouri 
(Mrs. 
HARTZLER), my good friend and col-
league, who has been a big leader in the 
pro-life movement. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. It is 
an honor to work with him and to 
stand with him and some of the col-
leagues for life—for the unborn. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise to re-
member 621⁄2 million children who have 
lost their lives at the hands of abor-
tionists. It has been 48 years since the 
passage of Roe v. Wade, and our chil-
dren continue to suffer and die by the 
millions. It is unfathomable. 
We know many of these children per-
ished in the most horrendous and bru-
tal of ways. The pain must have been 
excruciating, yet we are still failing to 
hear their cries. The single most-effec-
tive life-saving protection to stopping 
the spread of this scourge is the Hyde 
Amendment. 
Over 2.4 million children are alive 
today because of Hyde’s protections, 
which prevents taxpayer dollars from 
going to pay directly for abortions. We 
know the Hyde Amendment can’t save 
every life, but it can and it has saved 
many. Yet this limitation on Federal 
funds is the number one target for 
many of my colleagues. Eliminating 
Hyde protection will cause more child 
deaths, not less. 
Madam Speaker, I also rise today to 
remember women like Keisha Marie 
Atkins and Jamie Morales, who died as 
a result of the abortion procedure. I 
also remember the women who mourn 
the loss of their babies, who suffer 
physical, emotional, and spiritual trau-
ma from their abortions. I remember 
abortion-seeking women today who are 
offered hopelessness and death and 
unsanitized, dirty, and subpar clinics 
when they should be offered hope, pre-
natal care, and life for the baby inside. 
Today is a day of remembrance. So 
let us not forget the women and chil-
dren who have suffered and perished 
from abortion. Let us hear their cry 
and silence them no more. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend for 
her remarks. 
Madam Speaker, tonight is really an 
appeal—an appeal to my colleagues. It 
is a cry for survival and justice for un-
born baby girls and boys. Unborn chil-
dren need the President of the United 
States and all of us to be their friend 
and advocate, not powerful adversaries. 
In his inaugural speech, President 
Biden said: ‘‘The dream of justice for 
all will be deferred no longer.’’ He 
spoke of ‘‘a cry for survival from the 
planet itself. A cry that can’t be any 
more desperate.’’ 
I—we—believe the dream of justice 
for all cannot be achieved if an entire 
segment of society is legally ignored 
and legally discriminated against be-
cause of where they live, in their moth-
er’s womb, and how small and unbeliev-
ably defenseless they really are. 
We know the President understands 
this. He gets it—or at least he once did. 
Years ago, then-Senator Biden wrote to 
a constituent explaining his support 
for a law against funding for abortion, 
and he said it would ‘‘protect both the 
woman and her unborn child.’’ 
Senator Biden said, ‘‘I have consist-
ently, on no fewer than 50 occasions, 
voted against Federal funding for abor-
tions.’’ He went on to say, ‘‘Those of us 
who are opposed to abortion should not 
be compelled to pay for them.’’ 
My colleagues on the floor and Amer-
icans all across the country agree with 
that. Those of us who are opposed to 
abortion should not be compelled to 
pay for them. According to public opin-
ion polls, most Americans,—60 percent, 
according to the most recent Marist 
Poll—agree that taxpayers should not 
be compelled to fund abortion. 
Madam Speaker, lives have been 
saved by the Hyde Amendment. More 
than 20 peer-reviewed studies show 
that more than 20 million people are 
alive today in the United States be-
cause of the Hyde Amendment, with al-
most 60,000 children spared death by 
abortion each and every year. 
Madam Speaker, over 2 million peo-
ple who would have been aborted, in-
stead, survived because public funds 
were unavailable to effectuate their 
violent demise; and their mothers, in-
stead, benefited from maternal and 
prenatal healthcare and support. As we 
all know, the science of human devel-
opment has not changed and, thanks to 
ultrasound, unborn babies are now 
more visible than ever. 
As we all know—my wife and I are 
grandparents—with each new child our 
children given birth to, our daughters 
and daughters-in-law, the first pictures 
we see, the first pictures we put on the 
refrigerator are ultrasound pictures. 
The first movies we see, the videos are 
of that ultrasound of that child suck-
ing his or her thumb, doing somer-
saults, having great activity that will 
be great activity when they are born, 
as well. 
Madam Speaker, it was Abby John-
son who quit as a Planned Parenthood 
director in Texas when she was told she 
had to assist in an ultrasound-guided 
abortion. And when she saw that child 
in realtime literally ripped and shred-
ded and then sucked out of the womb 
by the suction machine, she walked out 
of that abortion clinic and has never 
gone back. She is now a very powerful 
and articulate spokeswoman for the 
right-to-life cause. Her book ‘‘Un-
planned,’’ I recommend it. It is a book 
that changes hearts. She was on the 
other side for years, so much so that 
she was the director of a Planned Par-
enthood clinic. Yet when she saw the 
deed itself, the dismemberment of that 
child, she walked out, and walked out 
forever. 
The same goes for guys, abortionists 
like Bernard Nathanson, who said, 
Once you see that ultrasound—and he 
was one of the founders of NARAL, a 
very large abortion rights organiza-
tion. He said, ‘‘I have come to the ago-
nizing conclusion that I presided over 
60,000 deaths.’’ And he, too, became a 
pro-lifer. An ultrasound and prenatal 
surgery where the babies were treated 
as patients, not as a being, to be extin-
guished or exterminated changed his 
mind. 
Madam Speaker, growing numbers of 
Americans are shocked that the meth-
ods of abortion include dismember-
ment. They include the literal decapi-
tation of this helpless child. And, of 
course, drugs like RU–486 starve the 
baby to death before he or she is then 
forcibly expelled from the womb. 
Madam Speaker, the multibillion- 
dollar abortion industry is very clever, 
and they cleverly market to savagery 
of choice while going to extraordinary 
lengths to ignore, trivialize, and cover 
up the battered baby victim. 
Madam Speaker, abortion violence 
must be replaced with compassion and 
empathy for women and for defenseless 
unborn babies. We must love them 
both. Birth is an event that happens to 
all of us. It is not the beginning of life. 
That child is just as vibrant before 
birth as after, just too big to continue 
inside the womb.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H316 
February 3, 2021 
Sadly, more than 62 million babies 
have been killed by abortion in the 
United States since Roe v. Wade, a loss 
of children’s lives that equates with 
the entire population of Italy. I truly 
believe that someday future genera-
tions of Americans will look back on us 
like we look back on people who did 
other things in previous centuries, in 
years back, and wonder how and why a 
society that prided itself on human 
rights could have effectuated and en-
abled the loss of so many defenseless 
babies—62 million and counting. 
b 1815 
Madam Speaker, last week, President 
Biden overturned the Protecting Life 
in Global Health Assistance policy, the 
Mexico City policy. His executive order 
forces—forces—U.S. taxpayers to fund 
organizations that promote, lobby, or 
perform abortions on demand in for-
eign countries. 
Americans 
overwhelmingly 
oppose 
using U.S. foreign aid to subsidize 
abortion. The Marist poll just last 
week found that more than three in 
four Americans, 77 percent, oppose 
using tax dollars to support abortions 
in other countries—77 percent. Let’s 
use those tax dollars to combat AIDS, 
to help people with malaria. 
I am the author of the reauthoriza-
tion of the PEPFAR program, the 
AIDS program that is now in effect. It 
was originally sponsored by our good 
friend and colleague Henry Hyde, and 
George W. Bush, it was one of his 
greatest achievements. That is where 
our foreign policy dollars and foreign 
aid dollars need to be spent, on nur-
turing. There is nothing benign about 
dismembering an unborn child or giv-
ing poisons that effectuate their death. 
Among other pro-abortion executive 
orders, on January 29, the President 
announced steps to resume funding to 
the U.N. Population Fund, even though 
that agency has supported China’s 
forced abortion policy for decades. 
Madam Speaker, I have chaired hear-
ings, 66 of them, on human rights in 
China over these many years. I have 
been here 41 years. I can tell you that 
China treats its unborn and its women 
in the most horrific of ways. One child 
per couple, now two children per cou-
ple, where coercion is used to enforce 
it, has led to massive, massive losses of 
life and to broken women. The U.N. 
Population Fund has been right there, 
cheerleading, supporting, aiding and 
abetting these crimes against women 
and children. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, by reason 
of their age, dependency, immaturity, 
inconvenience, or unwantedness, un-
born children have been denied justice. 
When the President calls, we all want 
justice. And they have been rendered 
legally persona non grata. Yet, their 
cries for survival, using the President’s 
words, can’t be any more desperate 
than they are. 
These children need the President of 
the United States to be their friend and 
advocate, not another powerful adver-
sary. They need us to be their friend 
and advocate and not powerful adver-
saries. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA), my 
good friend and colleague. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the gentleman for yielding, 
and I want to thank the gentleman for 
his decades of support for life and the 
unborn in this country and for every-
thing he has done. Thank you very 
much. 
Since 1973, more than 62 million inno-
cent unborn babies’ lives have been 
taken by abortion in this country. 
Tragically, abortion continues to put 
women in danger, takes the life of an 
innocent child, and fails to recognize 
the dignity of all lives, regardless of 
how small. 
In 2017 alone, there were roughly 
860,000 abortions in the United States. 
That number is far greater than the 
population of the district I represent, 
Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. 
While the overall abortion rate is de-
creasing, the rate of using chemical 
abortion is going up, accounting for 
roughly 39 percent of procedures that 
year. 
I am proud that my legislation, the 
SAVE Moms and Babies Act, would 
recognize chemical abortions for what 
it is: dangerous. 
Thankfully, there is still reason for 
hope. Three-quarters of Americans, in-
cluding a majority of whom identify as 
pro-choice, want significant restric-
tions on abortion. This is most cer-
tainly thanks to the growing pro-life 
movement advocating for the protec-
tion of the unborn children who de-
serve the dignity of life. Without the 
right to life, we truly have no other 
right. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding and, again, for all 
of his work. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend for his 
leadership and bill, which will save 
lives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON), a 
new Member but a Member who has se-
cured an important post in the Appro-
priations and the Budget Committees. 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today as a voice for the voiceless. 
Since Roe v. Wade was enacted by 
the Supreme Court decision 48 years 
ago, 62 million abortions have been per-
formed—62 million. This is a tragedy. 
This is definitely something that is 
devastating to think about. 
We must stand up for the unborn, 
those who cannot stand up for them-
selves. I always will, and I am doing 
that here tonight. 
As a mom of two boys, this issue is 
close to my heart. While reflecting on 
the lives lost is difficult to do, I am in-
spired here tonight. I am inspired by 
the growing pro-life community and 
movement in our country. I am hopeful 
that the next generation will fight for 
life, and I am proud to help lead this 
fight in Congress, standing with you. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank my friend, the gentleman from 
New Jersey, for his leadership on this 
very important issue, and I am honored 
to add my voice to his and many others 
in the defense of life here tonight. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her very powerful statement and her 
leadership, which I know is going to be 
greatly appreciated. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER), my friend who is a new 
Member. She is on the Education and 
Labor Committee, the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, and she is a phar-
macist. 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
right to life. 
As a mother, a grandmother of two 
precious grandsons, and the other 
mother to many students and young 
people who I have mentored over the 
years, I am truly committed to saving 
the lives of the unborn. 
As a pharmacist, I have helped many 
women through the years with infer-
tility issues and helped them achieve 
successful pregnancies. These women 
were desperate to have and to hold 
those precious children that many 
women want to abort. That is why I 
will continue to advocate on behalf of 
the right to life. 
I believe it is a moral and a God- 
given responsibility that we protect 
these treasured trusts from Heaven. We 
always must remember to protect the 
most vulnerable among us and give a 
voice to those voiceless babies, those 
precious children that somebody would 
want and somebody would nurture and 
somebody would love. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for her 
statement, and I look forward to work-
ing with her going forward in this Con-
gress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES), a 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, the lead sponsor of the Pro-
tecting Individuals With Down Syn-
drome Act, which prohibits abortions 
based on Down Syndrome. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate my friend from New Jersey for 
yielding and for hosting this special 
hour. 
As Americans, we realize that our 
government was formed to protect our 
God-given rights, and among them are 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. However, we recently marked the 
tragic anniversary of the Roe v. Wade 
decision, an anniversary that reminds 
us that nearly 62 million babies never 
got a chance to see the world. 
This anniversary is also a call to ac-
tion. As elected officials, we must 
stand for the rights of the unborn and 
be a voice for the voiceless. Instead of 
working to protect innocent life, Presi-
dent Biden has neglected this duty by 
signing executive orders that are nei-
ther pro-life nor pro-taxpayer.

He has reversed the Mexico City pol-
icy, forcing U.S. taxpayer dollars to 
fund abortions in foreign countries, a 
policy that is opposed by 77 percent of 
Americans, 
Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans. And he signaled that he will re-
scind the Title X protect life rule, 
which restricts funding organizations 
that consider abortion routine family 
planning. 
I am proud to stand with Americans 
who believe in the sanctity of life, and 
I am proud to lead this movement in 
Congress with our Protecting Individ-
uals with Down Syndrome Act to safe-
guard babies with a prenatal diagnosis 
of Down Syndrome. 
Thankfully, more pro-life leaders, ac-
tivists, and legislators are rising up to 
defend the unborn across our country. 
In Kansas, over the last couple of 
weeks, our State legislature has passed 
a resolution that puts a Kansas con-
stitutional amendment on the ballot 
next year to say with certainty that 
Kansas values both the life of the 
mothers and the babies. 
There is so much more work to be 
done, and I look forward to rep-
resenting the many pro-life Kansans in 
Congress. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend for his 
leadership on that bill and his leader-
ship on the issue of protecting defense-
less lives for many years. 
Madam Speaker, some Members are 
making their way over from our cau-
cus, but I just want to say a couple of 
points before closing. 
Years ago, a friend of mine by the 
name of Jean Garton, who was the head 
of Lutherans For Life, was preparing a 
speech, a lecture. In that lecture, she 
had a few slides of unborn children, 
just beautiful slides of that life before 
birth. But she also had a couple of 
slides that spoke truth to power. It was 
of what the abortion actually looks 
like, 
mangled 
bodies, 
dismembered 
children. 
While she was preparing that talk, it 
was late into the evening. One of the 
children walked in, and out of the 
mouth of babes comes truth. That child 
said: Mommy, who broke the baby? 
Abortion breaks babies. It hurts 
women, and we need a reappraisal in 
this Congress, in legislatures, where 
they are not supportive of the right to 
life. 
As I said earlier, we will look back 
someday and say: How could we have 
allowed it, particularly in the age of 
ultrasound, where we speak so often of 
the importance of science? 
Babies need help, growth, nutrition, 
and they certainly need protection le-
gally from this assault on their lives. 
b 1830 
Again, I thank my colleagues for par-
ticipating. I have a number of Members 
who are submitting statements in the 
RECORD. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mrs. 
BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise this evening with a heavy heart. 
Like many Americans, I am saddened 
by the loss of millions of innocent and 
precious lives over the last 48 years 
since Roe v. Wade. 
I know that there are millions of pro- 
life Americans rising up to protect the 
unborn. Because of this, I am encour-
aged. I have hope. Over the last 4 years, 
we saw remarkable pro-life wins all 
across America. Georgia, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and 
Ohio, these States rose up to protect 
the most vulnerable among us. From 
both sides of the aisle, they passed 
heartbeat bills because they know 
life—every human life—matters. 
Madam Speaker, when Roe v. Wade 
was 
passed, 
we 
didn’t 
have 
3D 
ultrasounds 
readily 
available. 
We 
didn’t 
have 
readily 
accessible 
sonograms or the ability to provide 
lifesaving care to those whom we call 
miracle babies, children who are pre-
maturely born as early as 21 weeks. I 
have held a child in my arms, in my 
hands, who was born at 23 weeks, 1 
pound, 8 ounces. She is a miracle baby. 
America didn’t know that pre-born 
children could feel pain as early as 21 
weeks, or see videos of babies in the 
womb clapping as their mother sings to 
them. 
Sadly, not all States have seen the 
light. Back home in Colorado, we are 
one of only seven States that allows 
full-term abortion in America. We have 
to do better than this. 
The CDC states that, in 2017, 647,000 
Americans died from heart disease, 
making it the leading cause of death in 
America. That is not true. The leading 
cause of death in 2017, in the United 
States, was abortion, killing 862,000 
precious babies. This is not a tragedy; 
it is an atrocity. 
Madam Speaker, I am the mother of 
four children—four wonderful boys, 
who I am raising to be men. I am rais-
ing my boys to love America, to love 
people, and to always do their best. I 
have been in the doctor’s office, and I 
have seen my baby boys talking and 
turning in my womb. They are my chil-
dren. They are made in God’s image, in 
His likeness. They have a God-given 
purpose and a plan by their Creator 
who knows them intimately and deeply 
and loves them, who has a plan, a fu-
ture, and a desired outcome for their 
lives. It is my job to raise them accord-
ing to God’s bent. Before they had 
taken their first breath, God knew 
them, and I was blessed to carry them. 
Madam Speaker, I have seen women 
make the choice. I have a waitress in 
my restaurant who chose life. She was 
in a very questionable situation. Her 
life wasn’t what everyone thought it 
should be. She ended up with child, and 
she had a choice. She had a choice to 
not go forward and be a mom, but she 
chose life, and now she is one of the 
greatest mothers that I know. Her 
name is Jasmine Higgs, and her baby 
boy is Darius. He is alive today be-
cause, glory to God, she chose his life. 
She said that his life is worth any of 
the 
consequences 
that 
may 
come 
against her. 
Madam Speaker, today, with this 
rise, I encourage my colleagues to be 
hopeful because a culture that cele-
brates life is on the rise in America, 
and I am committed to working with 
pro-life patriots all across the country 
until we end the horror of abortion. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT) for that 
very passionate defense of life and the 
passionate and beautiful story of life. 
Madam Speaker, we know that Dr. 
JOHN JOYCE is on his way. Congressman 
JOYCE should be here momentarily. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to point 
out one final thing. I just want to point 
out to my colleagues that we know 
that this is a difficult time for the pro- 
life movement in this Chamber. I have 
been here when we have had majorities 
and when we have had minorities. 
Based on what we think are the votes, 
we probably are in the minority right 
now. But I have to tell you, Madam 
Speaker, that any victory that results 
in more child deaths is a Pyrrhic vic-
tory. It is no victory at all. These chil-
dren deserve our respect and our love, 
and the mothers as well, not the vio-
lence of abortion. 
I would point out, too, that we do 
face these enormous challenges. I have 
been in the movement for 48 years. So 
I can say this with some sense of know-
ing the people who make up the pro-life 
movement. We love those who disagree 
with us. We respect even those with 
whom we fundamentally disagree, even 
when it is not reciprocated. 
It is all about respect from womb to 
tomb and for each other. So as the de-
bates heat up and as we go through this 
session of Congress, we will, with re-
spect, hear you. We disagree fundamen-
tally because we do believe that it is a 
truth and a fact that these children are 
deserving of respect. So I want you to 
know, Madam Speaker, this will be a 
very rough couple of years for the pro- 
life movement in this House. 
It has happened before. I was here 
when Bill Clinton had majorities in 
both Houses and when Barack Obama 
had majorities in both Houses. But we 
will persevere and we will never quit 
because these children’s lives are worth 
it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN), who 
is a member of the Agriculture Com-
mittee and the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congressman SMITH for his work on 
this important endeavor. I appreciate 
his hosting this opportunity to lift up 
the sanctity of life. I think there would 
be no debate that every life is precious 
and worthy of dignity and respect. 
Jeremiah 1:5 says: ‘‘Before I formed 
you in the womb, I knew you.’’ 
I will repeat that. That is from the 
Holy Scriptures. ‘‘Before I formed you 
in the womb, I knew you.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H318 
February 3, 2021 
The right to life should not be a po-
litical debate. We should uphold the 
value and dignity of life, even those 
who are defenseless and not with us 
yet. 
This January marked the 48th anni-
versary of the 1973 Supreme Court rul-
ing on the case of Roe v. Wade that 
made abortion available throughout 
pregnancy for nearly any reason. Since 
that tragic ruling, over 62 million inno-
cent babies have been aborted. In the 
year following Roe v. Wade, one in 
every three abortions in the U.S. were 
funded via taxpayer funds. 
Again, from the Scriptures, Daniel, 
one of the great prophets, would not 
have paid taxes in this country and 
probably would have gone to jail on 
that basis. 
Congress made changes so that tax-
payer-funded abortions were prohibited 
in spending bills, but the Democrats 
are now placing the long bipartisan 
Hyde amendment on the chopping 
block while President Biden rescinds 
important pro-life protections, like the 
Mexico City policy, which allows tax-
payer dollars to go toward promoting 
abortion abroad. We are not only doing 
it here, we are doing this to the rest of 
the world. 
As a father of four and a grandfather 
of 14, I feel very passionately about 
protecting unborn babies. Any and all 
measures that take steps to ensure the 
life of an unborn child will have my 
complete support, and I will adamantly 
oppose any that promote or defend 
such an immoral practice. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
statement. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE), 
who is a member of the Homeland Se-
curity Committee and the Small Busi-
ness Committee. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, every precious life is made in 
the image of our Creator. As image 
bearers, each person is deserving of 
fundamental rights, including the right 
to life. 
As a doctor, I took an oath to protect 
all human life. That unequivocal truth 
was the foundation for my medical ca-
reer, and it has continued through my 
work here in the United States Con-
gress. 
From forcing American taxpayers to 
pay for abortions against their con-
science to rolling back our recent pro- 
life achievements, President Biden has 
cemented his anti-life agenda in the 
first few days of his administration. To 
paraphrase President George Wash-
ington, it is deeds, not words, that de-
fine a leader. 
Right now, pro-life Americans are 
facing a daunting path ahead. But we 
are not without hope. Together, with 
the help of our Creator, we will per-
severe in our pursuit to defend the 
most vulnerable among us. 
Our enduring commitment to life 
will always prevail. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, since 
the Supreme Court wrongly decided 
Roe v. Wade 48 years ago, we have lost 
62 million lives to abortion. Any loss of 
life 
to 
abortion 
is 
not 
only 
heartbreakingly preventable, it is com-
pletely unacceptable in our modern so-
ciety. 
This pin, I always wear on my collar.

exact size and shape of a baby’s feet 10 
weeks after conception. Every day, as I 
put this pin on my collar, I reflect on 
the millions of lives cut short and the 
innovations, ideas, and improvements 
lost to our world. If anything else was 
extinguishing life on the same scale as 
abortion, every American would be up 
in arms fighting to right that wrong. 
Why is the sanctity of life any dif-
ferent? 
As Members of Congress, if we are 
not willing to fight for life, then what 
are we willing to fight for? 
The Lord has blessed me with two 
children and now three grandchildren. 
Every individual can attest to the inde-
scribable feeling of joy meeting a new-
born for the first time and holding that 
child. Our Creator has a plan for every 
single one of us, and I will work tire-
lessly to ensure every life has the 
chance to realize its full potential. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend for his 
comments and for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, one of my friends 
now for quite a long time has been the 
niece of the late Dr. Martin Luther 
King. Alveda King is her name. Dr. 
King used to be pro-choice. Very 
strongly so. She actually had two abor-
tions. Then she became pro-life. And 
she has become passionately pro-life 
not just for the babies, but maybe even 
more so for the women. 
She has said: 
How can the dream of my uncle, Martin 
Luther King, survive if we murder the chil-
dren? 
She speaks and reaches out to women 
who are post-abortive with such com-
passion, as do so many organizations 
and women; to women who have the 
abortions, to help them, to love them, 
and to care for them. 
Alveda King is an example to be fol-
lowed. Like her uncle and his bold and 
tremendous civil rights leadership, she 
argues—again, she is the niece of Dr. 
King—that this is the new civil rights 
movement and we need to protect and 
provide legal protection for these inno-
cent unborn babies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). Dr. 
BRIAN BABIN is a member of the Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee and the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee. Dr. BABIN is 
the sponsor of H.R. 28, Protecting Life 
in Crisis Act. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, we real-
ly appreciate Representative SMITH. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sol-
emn memory of the 62 million innocent 
lives who have been aborted since the 
tragic ruling on Roe v. Wade. 
Tellingly, earlier this week, as my 
wife of 48 years and I welcomed our 
17th grandchild into the world, I was 
reminded of just how precious life real-
ly is. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has already shown a blatant dis-
regard for the unborn of our Nation. 
The President has promoted abortion 
at home and abroad by reversing the 
Mexico City policy and by taking the 
first steps in rescinding a protect life 
rule known as Hyde. 
Although the fight for life will be an 
uphill battle under this particular ad-
ministration, we will never give up. 
Life is just too important. In our Dec-
laration of Independence, it is written 
that we have the right to life. That is 
the first of the inalienable rights that 
we are granted, the right to life. And 
although the fight for life will be tough 
this administration, we will resolve 
ourselves to continue this battle. 
At a time when Americans are so 
deeply divided in our Nation, I pray to 
our good Lord above that we unite in 
the belief that life is precious and it 
should be defended at all costs. May we 
be the generation that will see Roe v. 
Wade overturned. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time.

HELPING WORKING MEN AND 
WOMEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
as we get ourselves sort of organized, 
one of the hazards of being someone 
that almost can’t speak without a 
chart with them, I wanted to do a cou-
ple of things in this time this evening. 
Some of it is the continuation of the 
debate that happened on the floor ear-
lier today. 
I will just try to add a little more 
meat, a little more detail on what 
some of us are seeing from the Joint 
Economic Committee and our econo-
mists there looking at the data, what 
is going on in our country; and also, 
the Ways and Means Committee and 
what we see and what we think we can 
do to truly help working men and 
women in this country, the working 
poor, and where the policy is going, 
and it is some of our angst as the legis-
lation moved out of the House today on 
sort of a blank-check budget document. 
Here is $1.9 trillion in immediate 
funding, ultimately costing about a 
trillion and half in the 10-year window 
because of interest and those things be-
cause it is not paid for. 
And where does that money go? And 
is it designed to truly maximize help-
ing our brothers and sisters around this 
country and their economic vitality, 
dealing with the shutdowns and the

economic devastation that we have 
seen in so many of our communities? 
But some of the other side is where 
we have seen around the country, even 
with the headwinds of the pandemic, 
where are we seeing the economy mov-
ing in the right direction? Where are 
we seeing communities that have, we 
used to use the term, green shoots. 
That is sort of overused anymore. 
And there is also a substantial dif-
ference from what we see in some of 
the coastal economies to much of the 
rest of the Nation. 
I am blessed to represent the Scotts-
dale, Phoenix, Carefree, Cave Creek, 
Fountain Hills area, so Phoenix and 
some of its suburbs. And we have some 
folks that have just been crushed, 
whether they be in the hospitality 
business 
and 
tourism-related 
busi-
nesses, some of the restaurants. 
But yet, we have been shocked at 
also how healthy our economy has been 
because of the creativity of some of 
these very same people finding other 
ways to survive. And that is actually 
one of the secondary things we want to 
try to talk about this evening is, as the 
Democrats who run this place, they are 
in charge, will they actually be cre-
ative enough? Will they be forward- 
thinking enough to say, as we are look-
ing at tax policy, where we are going to 
do stimulus policy, regulatory policy, 
are we building it for what the future 
of the economy looks like, for the fu-
ture of opportunity, and will it be de-
signed to actually help all Americans? 
So some simple examples, and I am 
going to then use some of the display 
boards. We know there is already $1 
trillion sitting in bank accounts at the 
Treasury right now that are supposed 
to be helping schools, States, others 
who are in need right now. And instead, 
today, we spent all day debating $1.9 
trillion of new spending over the next 
year. Instead of saying, hey, there is $1 
trillion sitting in these accounts. What 
can we do to help the Biden adminis-
tration get it out the door, get it to 
those schools, to healthcare workers, 
to the places that are already des-
ignated? 
That is part of the problem around 
this place is we engage sort of in the 
theatrics, but the really assisting and 
providing the resources for the man-
agement to actually get to where the 
need is, that is secondary because, in 
some ways, that doesn’t give you the 
same television time opportunity. 
So a couple of things I wanted to 
walk through is, if I come to you and 
tell you there is $1 trillion already sit-
ting in accounts right now—it turns 
out, CBO, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, just did some projections, and we 
want this better. But this is as if the 
additional $1.9 trillion of spending were 
not to happen; we would just stay 
where we are at with the dollars that 
are already appropriated, with the 
budget that is already sort of modeled 
out. 
If you actually look here, 2020, miser-
able fall in the size of our economy. 
But our projections are functionally, 
by the end of the year, we expect 
growth to actually be substantially 
positive. We are looking at a year with 
just under 4 percent GDP growth. That 
is terrific. I would like to see it more, 
and we could see it more if we would 
actually target some of the resources, 
instead of doing what is often referred 
to around here as a peanut butter 
spread, where we are going to spend 
lots of money so we make sure we don’t 
annoy any constituent groups; or par-
ticularly let’s put money where, you 
know, we made these public employee 
unions happy. We made this group 
happy. 
I think this needs to be less about 
making our politics happy and making 
this line go up even further. And that 
is actually what, if we would actually 
draft the legislation, I think you would 
see Republicans line up with Demo-
crats and probably, not for $1.9 trillion 
because we know that is just almost 
absurd. But there are some real oppor-
tunities to make this GDP growth sub-
stantially, substantially better. 
As we sort of walk through some of 
the ideas that I am trying to promote, 
and I am trying to find some of my 
friends on the other side, particularly 
the Joint Economic Committee Demo-
crats and some of the Ways and Means 
Democrats, there is something very 
special going on right now and we need 
to seize this as an opportunity. 
In a time that has been so difficult 
for so many small businesses in Amer-
ica, small entrepreneurs, microentre-
preneurs, something has happened. Do 
you know this last year was the biggest 
year ever in this country for people 
starting new little businesses? Filing 
for new LLCs, just starting new busi-
nesses. And you can see it here in the 
chart. 
That is a pretty big spike when you 
consider 2019 was one of the greatest 
economic expansion years in modern 
history. 2018, 2019 were remarkable 
years economically, and yet, 2020, in 
the middle of such difficulties, we are 
seeing 
people 
becoming 
entrepre-
neurial, taking risks. 
If we are going to work on public pol-
icy, where we want to build a more 
egalitarian, a more robust economy 
next year, this year, future years, how 
about a conversation where we get the 
Democrats to actually talk to us as Re-
publicans, instead of just run us over 
policy-wise. How do you provide access 
to capital to some of these micro-
businesses, these businesses that are 
being started in people’s back bed-
rooms? 
How do you actually provide them a 
cleaner path through the regulatory 
bodies, the licensing, the permitting? 
Are we willing to be creative enough 
that, if you are poor and you happen to 
be willing to start a microbusiness and 
you live in public housing, you are ac-
tually allowed to run that business in 
the public housing, instead of being 
threatened with losing your lease? 
If you actually care about people, 
this is the time we say there is some-
thing going on in our society and our 
economy; is this one of the great dis-
ruptions a lot of the economists have 
been talking about, that when we have 
gone through this upheaval of this last 
year, what the future is going to look 
like? 
And does Congress actually provide 
assistance in a way that makes this 
economic change happen in a positive 
way? Or do we do what we are seeing in 
today’s budget document, which was 
functionally, $1.9 trillion, and most of 
it just going to fund either legacy eco-
nomics, 
States 
and 
municipalities, 
where the numbers were stunningly 
out of whack? Or are we functionally 
funding the last decade’s economy and 
not moving to the future economy? 
Now, I can try to explain this. If you 
will take a look at the bottom chart 
here—I put two charts on one board— 
you will actually see spending per gov-
ernment job lost. And the only point I 
am trying to make with this board is 
there is about $350 billion set aside in 
the Democrats’ budget reconciliation 
bill. 
There have been about 350,000 jobs 
lost in the government sector. But let’s 
first just do it by States. If that money 
were used for States, that is $1 million 
a job. If it is all of them, it is still 
$350,000 a job. 
This is actually how—if you actually 
say, here is the problem, here is the 
math of how much money is in that 
bill, you start to realize something is 
not lining up. And I desperately hope 
we can actually have an intellectually 
honest conversation saying, you want 
to help States and municipalities? We 
know from the Census Bureau—and it 
was as of the end of the third quarter 
because that is the last number we 
had—State revenues were up. State and 
local revenues were up over 17 percent 
last year, which is remarkable to think 
about, because it is unlike everything 
we have been told. 
Yes, there are municipalities around 
this country where their revenues have 
been crushed. They are also the very 
municipalities that have been most ag-
gressive in their shutdowns. Maybe 
those are places we need to look at and 
figure out how we help them. 
But the math is the math, and State 
and local revenues are up, if you take 
the entire country, they are up rather 
dramatically. 
The top part is part of the argument 
of targeting. If you are going to have 
impact in the country while spending 
lots of money, do you spend it in a way 
where you actually put the money in 
places that—let’s be honest—don’t need 
it? Or do you put the money to those 
who are truly hurting? 
And we can actually tell, because we 
can see it just in the aggregate. This is 
actually about commercial bank depos-
its, and this is telling us big businesses 
that got access to capital, wealthier 
people that actually got certain types 
of stimulus; stunning, stunning, stun-
ning rise of cash sitting in banks right 
now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H320 
February 3, 2021 
Did the Democrats actually intend to 
hand these same people that much 
more money? 
So part of what we are arguing for is, 
please, could we actually take a step 
back and understand the data? It is not 
slowing things down. It is actually not 
sticking money into the very pockets 
that actually don’t need it. 
The brutal political part is the folks 
that actually have these huge deposits, 
they are also the ones that often fi-
nance those campaigns. 
So let’s actually walk through—and 
this one is a little tougher, and I prob-
ably will do more on the floor on it in 
the future because I want to go into 
some depth—$15 minimum wage. Okay. 
I am one of those who genuinely, des-
perately wants to find ways to help the 
working poor. 
Understand what was accomplished 
in 2018 and 2019. There seems to be this 
fear of actually acknowledging that 
there was an economic miracle going 
on. It was the fastest rise of wealth and 
income for the working poor in modern 
history. It was the first, not one, but 2 
years in modern economic history 
where income inequality in this coun-
try actually shrank. 
If you say you end up with a society 
that becomes dangerously fractured as 
income inequality splits and splits and 
splits apart, there should have been joy 
in this body in 2018 and 2019 when that 
very income inequality shrank. 
The left can make whatever reason, 
excuse, but they need to at least ac-
knowledge it happened. The working 
poor’s wages went up dramatically. 
Nutrition, if you care about hunger, 
it was the first time in modern years 
where, what do they call it, food fra-
gility, food stress, actually shrank. 
These are good things. Maybe we need 
to take a step back and say what did 
we do for 2018? What did we do, as a 
body, for 2019 that created such pros-
perity, where revenues—so tax receipts 
is the proper way to call it, ways and 
means, tax receipts actually went up? 
If you actually did inflation-adjusted 
dollars, I think we had the number two 
and number three best years in U.S. 
history post-tax reform. 
We need to have an honest dialogue, 
and I know this is really difficult for 
the left. There are things for us on the 
right that are really difficult. But the 
fact of the matter is; whether things 
have changed in regulation; whether it 
is the things that changed in our tax 
code, whether it was the adoption of 
technology, there were lots of things 
moving in those couple of years there. 
But the fact of the matter is, U.S. soci-
ety got much healthier, and not at cost 
to the Treasury. 
b 1900 
If the truth here is that we care 
about where we are going economi-
cally, that we care about the economic 
stress, that we care about the working 
poor, a $1.9 trillion spending stimulus 
while ignoring the fact that we had a 
couple of years where we actually had 
success in shrinking income inequality, 
maybe we need to understand what we 
did there and do more of it. 
There is a reality here. If you want 
the working poor to have a better life, 
we can raise their wages to $15 an hour. 
But you also have to accept there is— 
I think one of these charts says it is 
like 3.2 million American workers in 
that working poor category who are 
going to become much poorer because 
they will lose their employment. 
We will spend some more time on a 
couple of these boards in the near fu-
ture to try to understand: Do you do 
what happened in 2018 and 2019, where 
what we saw is wages, almost every-
where in the country, were substan-
tially above the minimum wage be-
cause of the scarcity of labor? Labor 
became valuable. 
There is also another controversial 
subject we are going to have to have an 
honest 
discussion 
on: 
immigration 
issues in regard to the importation of 
low-skilled labor. It was somewhat re-
stricted in that time. Competition for 
labor shrank; therefore, the value of 
that labor went up. 
There is a combination of a robust 
economy, a tax code that is working, 
earned income tax credit, and things of 
that nature being expanded, and also 
not flooding the market with others 
with similar skill sets. 
A couple of others we want to just 
sort of walk through. This one is sort 
of difficult to get our heads around, but 
it is the math: total monthly spending 
effects of first and second stimulus 
payments by household income. What 
you find is, when you get up into the 
higher income, almost none of the 
money was really getting spent. It 
functionally went to make people’s 
bank accounts more robust. When you 
went down, you saw more of the money 
actually getting spent. 
All we are trying to argue here is, if 
you are going to do direct stimulus to 
individuals, great, but make sure it is 
not going into populations that aren’t 
going to spend it because you don’t get 
any multiplier in the economy. Lots of 
good data exist on this, and you saw it 
in a previous chart when you saw how 
much is just sitting in bank accounts 
right now. 
Back to trying to make a point. This 
indicates income by households. I want 
to make sure I say this the right way. 
If you take a look at what I often refer 
to as sort of the miracle of 2018 and 
2019, you started seeing populations 
that were in the lower percentiles. All 
of a sudden, their curve was much 
steeper than those who had typically 
benefited. 
There are series of data like this that 
we will show you, if you care about the 
working poor, that mimic what the Re-
publicans accomplished in the tax re-
form and in the regulatory reform. If 
you are on the left, put it under a dif-
ferent name. But the fact of the matter 
is, the data is the data. There were 
some really wonderful things hap-
pening for the poor and the working 
poor in this country. 
Instead of going through the next 
couple of boards, I will save those for 
when we do a concentrated conversa-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, in sort of building a 
closing here, it has been a crappy 
month for a lot of us here in Congress. 
We have gone through some things I 
really thought I would never see. 
But I always thought, even outside, 
when many of us are standing in front 
of microphones and being a bit hyper-
bolic, thinking that the only way vot-
ers will actually hear our words is 
when we tell stories because math is 
too difficult, there have always been 
those moments in the back—or the joy 
of being in the Ways and Means Com-
mittee where we share a common back 
room, unlike so many other commit-
tees where you go off separately. 
In this time of COVID, we don’t have 
those conversations right now. We 
don’t hear each other’s arguments and, 
hopefully, build policy that is good for 
the country. 
What we saw on the floor earlier 
today, I think, is somewhat shameful, 
a $1.9 trillion budget box, which is de-
signed basically to be able to run 
through the process, get through the 
Senate with 51 votes, so they don’t 
have to negotiate with any Repub-
licans. 
But what was also sort of heart-
breaking is so many of the things that 
were said just weren’t true. They 
weren’t mathematically true. They 
weren’t policy true. They weren’t his-
torically true. 
The Speaker got up and said, I think, 
83 percent of the benefits of tax reform 
went to the top 1 percent. That just 
isn’t true. We have lots of papers and 
other things that say it isn’t. I am sure 
the smart people around her know it is 
not true. But around here, if you say 
something enough times, it becomes 
part of, sort of, congressional folklore. 
To be correct, it is 25 percent of the 
benefits went to the top 1 percent, but 
they pay just a stunning percentage of 
Federal income tax. 
How do we ever build policy, particu-
larly for economic growth, for oppor-
tunity for everyone, and build a much 
more, shall we say, fair and egalitarian 
society when in the debates we have, so 
much of the discussion is make-be-
lieve? The math isn’t true. Yet, if we 
say it enough times, you will hear it 
resaid over and over. I will argue that 
is where a lot of the crisis is around 
here. 
My family joke that Daddy works in 
a place that is a math-free zone was 
meant to be funny. It wasn’t supposed 
to be true. The problem is, it is true. 
How do you make public policy in 
times of difficulty, when you want to 
have an economic future that is good 
for everyone, but when so much of the 
debate has so little to do with the 
truth? 
I double my commitment. Leading 
the Joint Economic Committee, our 
economists, our team, I know we have 
all committed to working with our

Democrat colleagues on finding the 
things that look like they work and do 
more of it. 
I desperately hope we can find some 
Democrats who are less bathing in par-
tisan rage, or whatever the proper term 
would be, and are willing to look at the 
math that would be good for all of us, 
good for the country, good for someone 
like myself who has a 5-year-old. I 
want her future to be amazing. 
I truly believe our society is at the 
moment of an economic disruption 
that, if we can get policy right, the 
next couple of years can be pretty darn 
amazing. The next decade could be just 
awesome. But right now, our regu-
latory policy and our reimbursement 
policies aren’t there. 
How do we get the conversation to 
move back to things that will make 
this future amazing instead of just 
burying my 5-year-old daughter in

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
ORGANIZATION RESOLUTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
am happy to report this morning that 
the leadership of both parties have fi-
nalized the organizing resolution for 
the Senate. We will pass the resolution 
through 
the 
Senate 
today, 
which 
means that committees can promptly 
set up and get to work—with Demo-
crats holding the gavels. 
For the information of the Senate, 
the Democratic caucus has announced 
its committee memberships for the 
next 2 years. I am confident our Mem-
bers are ready to hit the ground run-
ning on the most important issues that 
face our country. 
Senate Democrats are not going to 
waste any time taking on the biggest 
challenges facing our country and our 
planet. I have already instructed the 
incoming Democratic chairs of all rel-
evant committees to begin holding 
hearings on the climate crisis in prepa-
ration for enacting President Biden’s 
Build Back Better agenda, which in-
cludes major climate legislation. 
It is long past time for the Senate to 
take a leading role to combat the exis-
tential threat of our time—climate. As 
we all know, climate change touches 
virtually every aspect of our economy 
and involves virtually every aspect of 
public policy. So as the Biden Adminis-
tration prepares a whole-of-govern-
ment approach to combating climate 
change, the Democratic majority will 
pursue a whole-of-Senate approach as 
well. 
Some of this work has already start-
ed. Two years ago, Senate Democrats 
established the first-ever Senate Spe-
cial Committee on the Climate Crisis. I 
have promised that any action we take 
on infrastructure, in particular, will 
prioritize green infrastructure and the 
creation of green jobs, and create many 
jobs—good-paying jobs—we will. 
Personally, I have introduced legisla-
tion to speed our country’s transition 
toward clean cars that has the support 
of the environmental community, the 
labor unions, and some of the car man-
ufacturers. 
Make no mistake, in several different 
ways, this Democratic majority will 
compel the Senate to forcefully, relent-
lessly, and urgently address climate 
change, beginning with work in all of 
the relevant committees. 
So as we set up new committee struc-
tures, I look forward to working with 
the new Democratic chairs on ways 
their committees will address the cli-
mate crisis. I look forward to speaking

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S274 
February 3, 2021 
with my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle about finding some common 
ground on this issue. And, most impor-
tantly, I look forward to propelling 
this Chamber into action on a crisis 
that concerns not only all of our fu-
tures but the futures of our children 
and our grandchildren. It is our solemn 
obligation to leave behind a planet 
upon which future generations can 
grow and prosper. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, now on COVID, 
yesterday afternoon the Senate took 
the first step in preparing the rescue 
package for an economy and a country 
that is still in the throes of crisis. The 
$1.9 trillion budget resolution is de-
signed to meet the needs of a country 
that has been devastated by disease 
and recession for nearly a year. It has 
been such a long time. We need real 
help. 
Unlike most crises, which affect one 
particular sector of the economy or an-
other, one part of the country or an-
other, the COVID–19 pandemic affects 
the entire country and nearly every as-
pect of American life. There is not one 
person in America, in my judgment, 
whose life hasn’t been significantly 
changed by this awful crisis. The chal-
lenges we must overcome are manifold. 
So we must produce a bill that address-
es each of those changes and challenges 
in turn—housing and agriculture and 
education, help for the unemployed, 
small businesses, our healthcare sys-
tem, and our State and local govern-
ments. And we cannot fall short of the 
needs of each of those areas. 
History has taught us hard lessons 
about the cost of small thinking during 
times of big challenge and about the 
cost of delay during moments of great 
urgency. 
Secretary Yellen told the Democratic 
caucus yesterday that it is her belief 
that if Congress fails to dedicate the 
necessary resources to meet the needs 
of the American people and survive 
this crisis, we will see long-term scar-
ring in our economy and our country 
would be mired in the COVID crisis for 
years. 
The income inequality and wealth in-
equality that plagues our Nation has 
been exacerbated by this crisis because 
it is certainly the lower half of the 
American people who have suffered the 
most and needs to be remediated. And 
that is what we aim to do. 
We must not—must not—repeat the 
mistakes of the past and do too little, 
too reluctantly, and too late. We will 
not repeat the mistakes of the past. 
Our goal is simple: to help the Amer-
ican people and the American economy 
and do it fast. Over the next 2 days, the 
Senate will be in session for debate on 
the budget resolution. There will be an 
open bipartisan amendment process. 
We invite participation from both sides 
of the aisle in that process, but I urge 
Members not to lose sight of what this 
legislation will mean for the American 
people. 
For Americans who have lost their 
jobs through no fault of their own, this 
rescue package will extend enhanced 
unemployment benefits. For parents—I 
have spoken to so many who are des-
perate for the day they can send their 
children back to school safely—this 
rescue package will include resources 
for schools to make that happen 
quicker. For teachers and firefighters 
and busdrivers and nurses worried 
about the fate of their jobs, this rescue 
package will follow through on pro-
viding aid for State and local govern-
ments. For restaurants and bars, for 
theaters and farmers, for small busi-
nesses of every stripe, this rescue pack-
age will make another round of Federal 
loans and grants available to you. And 
for every American struggling to make 
ends meet, who, month by month, has 
fallen further behind on the rent or 
mortgage, who has the power or the 
heat or the water shut off, for every 
American who has had to choose which 
meal they were going to skip that day, 
this rescue package will send direct as-
sistance in the form of a check. 
And, of course, this rescue package 
will support the production and dis-
tribution of the vaccine that is the key 
to ending the crisis. The past adminis-
tration—in terms of distribution, in 
terms of working with the States to 
get these vaccines out—has been so 
derelict. It has been one of the greatest 
failures of any Presidency. The new 
Biden Administration is focused on 
making more vaccines, getting them 
out quickly, getting them out fairly, 
and doing it effectively and efficiently. 
We have to help get that done. 
So I, alongside the Democratic com-
mittee chairs responsible for drafting 
this legislation, will be meeting with 
President Biden at the White House 
today, a few hours from now. Our cau-
cus is eager to discuss next steps, and 
we are united in our resolve to deliver 
on a rescue plan that provides the 
American people the relief they so des-
perately need. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
HONORING OFFICER BRIAN D. SICKNICK 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
morning, U.S. Capitol Police Officer 
Brian Sicknick lies in honor under the 
dome of the institution he swore to de-
fend—and died defending. 
Four weeks ago, the Rotunda was 
strewn with the debris of an insurrec-
tionist mob. Today, it is adorned in 
solemn thanksgiving for the sacrifice 
of a hero. On January 6, those who 
sought to obstruct our democracy were 
confronted by a sworn officer and mili-
tary veteran who was determined to 
protect it. In the face of lawlessness, 
Brian Sicknick paid the ultimate price 
to uphold a solemn oath. He gave our 
Nation the last full measure of devo-
tion. 
Our democratic Republic was built to 
endure, but it needs heroes like the of-
ficers of the U.S. Capitol Police to sup-
port and defend it. So, today, we mourn 
and give thanks for the true patriot 
who lies in the Rotunda. The Senate 
and the entire country send our deep-
est condolences to Officer Sicknick’s 
family and all who loved him. His name 
will never be forgotten. 
SCHOOLS 
Now, Mr. President, on an entirely 
different matter, this pandemic has 
forced Americans to confront numer-
ous and compounding tragedies. Al-
most 450,000 Americans 
have 
been 
killed; millions of livelihoods have 
been upended; and millions of Amer-
ican kids, especially those who attend 
public school, have been robbed of an 
entire year—and counting—of proper 
school. 
Despite heroic efforts from students, 
parents, and teachers, so-called remote 
learning has proven a poor substitute 
for the real thing. Research suggests 
that, even if the average remote-learn-
ing student had gotten back in the 
classroom last month, they would al-
ready have missed multiple months’ 
worth of learning compared to a nor-
mal year. 
Forty percent of high schoolers in St. 
Paul now have failing grades. In Hous-
ton, it is 40 percent of all students. 
Tampa’s school district has reportedly 
just lost track of thousands of kids al-
together—and this pain isn’t spread 
equally. The worst has fallen on the 
most vulnerable, including lower in-
come households, students of color, and 
students with special needs and their 
families. 
The fallout isn’t just academic. Re-
placing the structure, friendships, and 
activities 
of 
school 
with 
isolated 
screen time has predictably caused 
spikes in mental health concerns. 
Schools normally keep an eye on kids 
with challenging home lives and are 
too often the most reliable sources of 
hot meals and on and on. 
We know with certainty now that K– 
12 schooling cannot move online indefi-
nitely, like a white-collar workplace. 
It is more like routine medical proce-
dures—something that can be post-
poned a few weeks in a pinch but which 
our society really cannot do without, 
and some families aren’t having to. 
Many private and parochial schools 
have been in person since the fall, and 
many European countries have kept 
kids in school nearly this whole time, 
but in places across America, where 
public education depends on the whims 
of powerful public sector unions, the 
best interests of children have often 
come dead last. 
As the months have rolled by and the 
data have poured in, it has become 
clear that schools can open safely. Just 
last week, CDC researchers affirmed:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S275 
February 3, 2021 
‘‘With proper prevention efforts . . . we 
can keep transmission in schools and 
educational settings quite low.’’ 
This confirms what scientists were 
observing as far back as October, when 
it was reported: ‘‘Transmission by 
young children to adults seems to be 
negligible as long as safety measures 
are in place.’’ 
Dr. Fauci, whose expertise was sup-
posed to guide the Biden administra-
tion’s whole approach, said last week: 
‘‘We can keep the children in school 
and get them back to school safely.’’ 
That is Dr. Fauci. 
An administration that puts facts 
and science first would be conducting a 
full-court press to open schools. 
Federal funding is not an obstacle. 
That is more goalpost-moving. Con-
gress has poured more than $110 billion 
into making education safe. As of last 
week, States and local school districts 
had only spent about $4 billion of the 
roughly $68 billion we set aside for K– 
12 schools. That leaves $64 billion in 
the pipeline already. 
Remember, science tells us that 
schools are largely made safe with sim-
ple precautions. Science is not the ob-
stacle. Federal money is not the obsta-
cle. The obstacle is a lack of willpower 
not among students, not among par-
ents—just among the rich, powerful 
unions that donate huge sums to 
Democrats and get a stranglehold over 
education in many communities. 
Apparently, 
Big 
Labor’s 
talking 
points have already displaced Dr. Fauci 
as the White House go-to source. The 
President’s Chief of Staff keeps saying 
we need even more massive Federal 
funding before teachers can go back. 
There is no scientific basis for that, 
none whatsoever. 
The goalpost-moving doesn’t stop 
with money. In several places, these 
unions sought to elbow toward the 
front of the line for vaccinations—only 
to turn around and say: Thanks for 
those vaccinations but don’t think 
these will necessarily get our folks 
back in the classroom any time soon. 
Too often, local officials just roll 
over and submit to these tactics. In my 
hometown of Louisville, KY, the larg-
est school district in the State has a 
union-funded board of education vice 
chair. He is now saying that, even if all 
school personnel get vaccines, he would 
still be reluctant to open schools. In 
San Francisco, the 28-year-old board of 
education president—28 years old—ar-
gued a few days ago that vulnerable 
kids aren’t really missing out on learn-
ing; they are just learning different 
things, and it is the system’s fault for 
not measuring all of the valuable cul-
tural experiences they have had while 
being stuck at home. 
What nonsense. 
Families are losing patience—and 
fast. We could not function with re-
mote police or remote firefighters or 
remote dental surgeons, and we would 
never pretend otherwise. Kids, parents, 
and a lot of talented teachers have 
given online learning their all, but we 
will be deluding ourselves if we con-
tinue to accept this pale shadow of 
proper 
schooling 
when 
all 
of 
the 
science—all of it—points the other 
way. 
No more goalpost-moving. States and 
districts have got to follow the science 
and get American education back on 
track. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. President, on a related matter, in 
the past year, Congress has worked to-
gether to pass five major rescue pack-
ages on a bipartisan basis. The Demo-
cratic leader spent months saying that 
any pandemic relief should pass with 
broad bipartisan support. 
He said last July: ‘‘Sitting in your 
own office, writing a bill, and then de-
manding the other side support it is 
not anyone’s idea of bipartisanship.’’ 
But, yesterday, less than a day after 
several Senate Republicans spent, lit-
erally, 2 hours meeting with President 
Biden, Senate Democrats plowed ahead 
with a party-line vote to set the table 
for a partisan jam. The new President 
talks a lot about unity, but his White 
House staff and congressional leader-
ship are working with a different play-
book. 
We will be discussing the facts on 
schools, on jobs, and on healthcare in 
depth in the days to come, but the 
rushed budget process that will play 
out this week is exactly the wrong 
path toward making law. Senate Re-
publicans will be ready and waiting 
with a host of amendments to improve 
the rushed procedural step that is 
being jammed through. 
We will be getting Senators on the 
record about whether taxpayers should 
fund checks for illegal immigration, 
whether Democrats should raise taxes 
on small businesses in the midst of this 
historic crisis, and whether generous 
Federal 
funding 
should 
pour 
into 
school 
districts 
where 
the 
unions 
refuse to let schools open, and this is 
just a small taste. 
The American people will see Repub-
licans are focused on smart and respon-
sible policies to reopen the country, 
and they will see Democrats who seem 
desperate to make their first act in 
power the same kind of massive, par-
tisan, poorly targeted borrowing spree 
that permanently wounded the last 
Democratic Presidency right out of the 
gate. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IRAN 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think 
there is something that may be coming 
up that is worth addressing right now 
and addressing early. It has been a con-
cern, a bipartisan concern, for a long 
period of time, and that is that Presi-
dent Biden has made it clear that he 
intends to reenter the 2015 Iran deal, 
better known as the JCPOA. 
Now, this was something that dis-
turbed a lot of people—a lot of Demo-
crats as well as Republicans—back dur-
ing the Obama years, and I want to get 
it on record here to make sure that re-
entering that Iran deal would be a ter-
rible mistake and that the administra-
tion would face stiff opposition in Con-
gress if he tried to go that route. There 
are things that we can do but not reen-
tering that one. There can be no return 
to a deal with limitations on Iran’s nu-
clear program that begin to expire in 4 
years or the return to a deal that, ulti-
mately, allows Iran to enrich enough 
uranium for a nuclear weapon after 
those limitations. 
Keep in mind that Iran is the country 
that is right in the middle of all of the 
terrorist activity, promoting terrorism 
around the world, and to even think 
about allowing them to keep some kind 
of a nuclear capability that can be used 
as a bomb—it is just unthinkable that 
it could happen. We couldn’t return to 
a deal that lifts the sanctions on a gov-
ernment that is the leading state spon-
sor of terrorism and is targeting U.S. 
personnel and partners across the Mid-
dle East. You don’t need to take my 
word for it. My Democratic colleagues 
warned the Obama administration in 
2015. I was here. I remember when it 
happened. They were talking about the 
shortcomings of that deal. 
One was the senior Senator from New 
York, the current majority leader,

SCHUMER, who warned that, 
under the Iran deal, ‘‘inspections are 
not ‘anywhere, anytime,’ ’’ and ‘‘the 24- 
day delay before we can inspect is trou-
bling.’’ 
That would be right. Essentially, 
what he said was that they can do any-
thing they want to do for 24 days before 
we restrict anything that they are 
doing. He was right. 
He further said: ‘‘That delay would 
enable Iran to escape detection of any 
illicit building and improving of pos-
sible military dimensions—the tools 
that go into building a bomb but don’t 
emit radioactivity.’’ That door was left 
wide open that this could take place. 
Or listen to the Democratic colleague 
from New Jersey, Senator MENENDEZ. 
He is the new chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations, and 
he warned that the deal meant ‘‘we are 
now embarked not on preventing nu-
clear proliferation, but on managing or 
containing it, which leaves us with a 
far less desirable, less secure, and less 
certain world order.’’ 
Or listen to my Democratic colleague 
from West Virginia, Senator MANCHIN. 
He serves with me on the committee 
that I had chaired for quite some time, 
the Senate Committee on Armed Serv-
ices. He warned us. He said: ‘‘Lifting 
sanctions without ensuring that Iran’s 
sponsorship of terrorism is neutralized 
is dangerous to regional and American 
security.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S276 
February 3, 2021 
I mean, these are no-brainers. These 
are things that Democrats and Repub-
licans alike were warning us about—of 
the frailties that were in that proposal 
back in 2015. 
Now, my Democratic colleagues were 
pretty prophetic in what they were 
warning. They were warning three 
things. First of all, we still, after this 
period of time, do not know the full 
scope of Iran’s nuclear program. Sec-
ondly, 
Iran’s 
nuclear 
production 
slowed, but it did not end after that. 
Third, Iran did, in fact, use its sanc-
tions relief to fund terrorism, and it 
continues to support groups who target 
Americans for murder. 
I just wish that then-Vice President 
Biden had listened to my Democratic 
colleagues and their warning about the 
Iran deal’s shortcomings then, and I 
hope that he will listen now that he is 
President. It is more significant, and 
there is simply no good argument for 
returning to a bad deal. 
Too often, supporters of the Iran deal 
have accused the Iran deal’s critics— 
talking to me and others, I am sure—of 
being opposed to any deal at all. Back 
in 2015, the Obama administration de-
picted the opponents of the Iran deal as 
warmongers. 
Let me just be clear. Nobody wants 
war with Iran. If anything, I believe 
the Obama-era deal makes war more 
likely by enriching one of the worst 
state sponsors of terrorism and by giv-
ing it a clear pathway towards nuclear 
weapons capabilities. 
I am not making this stuff up. This is 
serious. Calling the people who oppose 
him warmongers couldn’t be further 
from the truth. 
In fact, after killing Iran’s arch-ter-
rorist, Soleimani, last year, President 
Trump explicitly called for a deal that 
makes the world safer and more peace-
ful. He was calling for that at that 
time. 
So we don’t want war, but we also 
don’t want a flawed Iran deal. That ter-
rible deal isn’t and never has been the 
only choice. But we would absolutely 
consider supporting a good deal. What 
would a good deal look like? I want to 
highlight four main principles that we 
would look for, and this is something 
the President can do now. 
First, the deal has to be comprehen-
sive. That means addressing all of 
Iran’s bad behavior: its funding of ter-
rorism, terrorist proxies, its ballistic 
missile program, its nuclear program— 
the things my Democratic colleagues 
were worried about back in 2015. 
Secondly, the deal has to be inclusive 
of the views of Israel and our Arab 
partners. The Obama administration 
sidestepped their concerns, and Presi-
dent Biden should not do the same 
now. We should have learned from that. 
Third, the deal must be permanent. 
The 2015 deal allowed for sunset provi-
sions that would ultimately allow Iran 
to possess a nuclear weapons capa-
bility. And I will be clear: Iran should 
never be allowed to have a nuclear ca-
pability. 
Fourth, the deal has to be trans-
parent. It has to allow for regular and 
unconditional inspections of Iran’s nu-
clear program, just as the majority 
leader called for 6 years ago. I mean, 
what is wrong with making sure that 
we are allowed to make inspections to 
make sure they are doing what they 
have agreed to do? There is nothing 
wrong with that. 
Now, these are things my colleagues 
and I agree on. President Biden can 
find bipartisan support here. To repeat, 
we want a diplomatic resolution, not 
war, but that means a good resolution. 
Of course, it is far from clear that 
the Iranian regime is ready and willing 
to engage in serious negotiations. So I 
call on the Biden administration to lay 
the groundwork now so that a new deal 
has the foundation to succeed when the 
Iranian regime is ready. You know, 
that is a logical thing that I think 
would encompass a lot of support from 
the Republican side and support from 
the House. 
Specifically, this means maintaining 
our leverage with Iran through sanc-
tions and a strong U.S. military pos-
ture in the region. It also means open-
ing discussions with our European al-
lies and our other regional partners to 
coordinate priorities for the new deal. 
Most importantly, it means working 
with Congress early and often so that 
there is a sustainable, bipartisan path 
forward when the time is right. 
Along those lines, I was disappointed 
by President Biden’s decision to ap-
point someone who negotiated the Iran 
deal as his new Iran envoy. A new deal 
requires new thinking. Bipartisan co-
operation won’t be achieved by ele-
vating the partisans of the past. If 
something didn’t work back then, just 
try somebody else. Send new personnel 
working on these problems. 
Moving forward, the Biden adminis-
tration should expect difficult con-
firmations for any nominee who was 
involved in negotiating that deal back 
in 2015. President Biden has an oppor-
tunity to correct the Obama adminis-
tration’s mistakes on Iran. It has a 
chance to build bipartisan congres-
sional support for a diplomatic resolu-
tion that is truly comprehensive, inclu-
sive, transparent, and permanent. 
A successful Iran deal allows the 
United States to focus more squarely 
on the challenges of Russia and China. 
A return to the Iran deal, however, will 
empower the Iranian regime and keep 
us mired in the region. 
I think everyone knows Iran. It is the 
world leader in terrorism, and we 
should do everything we can to make 
sure they don’t get a nuclear capability 
to develop a nuclear weapon. I can’t 
imagine that anyone could argue with 
that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we 
all 
have 
learned, 
the 
devastation 
caused by COVID–19 reaches far beyond 
the health impact of the virus itself. 
Tens of millions of Americans have lost 
their jobs or other sources of income. 
Countless small businesses no longer 
exist, and the stress and uncertainty 
surrounding the pandemic has taken a 
toll on the mental health of every 
American. That is especially true for 
children, 
whose 
worlds 
have 
been 
flipped upside down. 
Last spring, schools in Texas and 
across the country transitioned from 
in-person to virtual instruction in 
order to help stop the spread of the 
virus. In the beginning, we thought 
this was a short-term measure, a way 
to keep students, teachers, and their 
families safe from the virus we knew 
very little about at the time. I don’t 
think any of us expected that those 
closures would last as long as they 
have, with many students across the 
country coming up on their 1-year an-
niversary of virtual learning. 
As weeks turned into months, it be-
came clear that online instruction was 
no replacement for classroom learning. 
We know many families just don’t have 
the ability either to access broadband 
or they don’t have the supervision at 
home of family members to help keep 
children on task when it comes to vir-
tual learning. It is a poor substitute, in 
most instances, unless it is just abso-
lutely necessary. 
Last spring, schools in Texas and 
across the country transitioned to vir-
tual instruction, as I said, to stop the 
spread of the virus. We thought this 
would be a way to stop the spread, but 
as weeks turned into months, it be-
came clear that many kids were falling 
behind, especially in foundational sub-
jects like math and reading, and the 
learning deficit is even greater for stu-
dents of color and those in high pov-
erty communities. 
One study found that for math, White 
students began this year about 1 to 3 
months behind in their learning, while 
students of color fell 3 to 5 months be-
hind. 
We know that the impact is not pure-
ly academic. There is also a serious 
mental and emotional toll. The Texas 
Tribune recently shared a story of one 
student, a boy they refer to as Jordan. 
He was a student in the Frisco Inde-
pendent School District, and like kids 
across the country, he struggled with 
the challenge of virtual learning. This 
fall, his normal A’s and B’s dropped to 
F’s, and the further he fell behind, the 
harder it was for him to catch up. 
In October, Jordan opened up a 
Google doc and typed an absolutely ag-
onizing message. He said ‘‘give me 10 
GOOD reasons why I shuldnt kill my-
self here.’’ 
And when you think that can’t get 
any more heartbreaking, it does. The 
list was blank. An 11-year-old boy felt

so lost and defeated, he couldn’t come 
up with a single reason to continue liv-
ing. 
Well, if there is a bright spot in this 
otherwise very dark story, it is that 
this incident did not go unnoticed. Jor-
dan was using a school-issued com-
puter, and the school district’s tech-
nology department quickly flagged this 
alarming information for counselors, 
who alerted Jordan’s mother. She was 
able to intervene, thankfully, before 
those dark thoughts could be turned 
into action and get Jordan the mental 
health treatment he needed. 
While I am glad to report that Jor-
dan is now back in the classroom where 
his grades are improving and he is able 
to spend time with his friends—an im-
portant part of the socializing function 
of our schools and going to class with 
others—but, sadly, the pain and suf-
fering this student experienced is not 
unique. The Frisco Independent School 
District, where Jordan is a student, has 
already surpassed the number of stu-
dents hospitalized for mental health 
concerns from last school year, and the 
number of students considering at-
tempting or dying by suicide is also on 
track to break previous records. The 
pandemic has simply taken a dev-
astating toll on our children academi-
cally, socially, and emotionally. So I 
am here to add my voice to those who 
say we need our schools to open and, of 
course, to do so safely, which I believe 
they can. 
In December, the then-President- 
Elect Biden promised to safely reopen 
the majority of schools within the first 
hundred days in the White House. He 
said it should be a national priority to 
get our kids back into school and to 
keep them in school. I agree. Our chil-
dren deserve the quality and the sta-
bility that only in-person instruction 
can provide, and parents deserve the 
option to choose the learning model 
that works best for their kids. 
That is why Congress has appro-
priated more than $110 billion to sup-
port education, including $67 billion 
specifically for K–12 students. This 
funding has allowed schools to supply 
their students with what they need for 
virtual learning where that is required, 
including laptops and hotspots, while 
also preparing for a safe return to the 
classroom. 
Administrators 
at 
each 
school are able to evaluate their indi-
vidual needs and risks, and I am sure 
all of them vary by circumstance to 
some extent. But they also need to im-
plement the necessary precautions to 
keep, 
obviously, 
the 
students 
and 
teachers safe. 
Texas schools have used Federal 
funding to update their air filtration 
systems, purchase personal protective 
equipment, and implement regular dis-
infecting. The results are pretty clear. 
A headline from the Houston Chronicle 
in December read: ‘‘COVID Spread Re-
mains Minimal in Texas Schools De-
spite State Surge.’’ 
The truth is, the virus doesn’t affect 
all of us identically. There are a lot of 
differences according to age. 
The President has repeatedly empha-
sized his trust in science, so let’s take 
a look at the science here. Just last 
week, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention published a report that 
found ‘‘there has been little evidence 
that schools have contributed mean-
ingfully to increased community trans-
mission.’’ 
The lead author of that report af-
firmed that even in places with other-
wise high infection rates, there is no 
evidence that schools will transmit the 
virus at a higher rate than the general 
community. 
In short, it seems that schools are 
not a breeding ground for COVID–19, 
and as long as commonsense pre-
cautions are taken, then schools can 
reopen safely. I know that has been the 
case in a lot of the parochial schools 
where, frankly, if they didn’t have stu-
dents showing up for class, they would 
be out of business. It is only in the pub-
lic schools where you see this phe-
nomena of extended virtual learning 
and a refusal of many teachers to re-
turn to the classroom. 
I know this has presented a dilemma 
for President Biden because in this 
case the science is at odds with a key 
group of his supporters, which are 
teachers unions. 
Unions in a number of major cities, 
like Chicago, have refused to return to 
school, despite the fact that evidence 
shows that schools are able to open 
safely—again, if proper precautions are 
taken. And Congress has provided tens 
of billions of dollars to help them do 
so, and teachers, like others across the 
country are being vaccinated. Teachers 
unions demand, in some cases, that 
schools be closed altogether. 
Just outside of the District of Colum-
bia, in Fairfax County, VA, the situa-
tion is even more bewildering. The 
school board and teachers union have 
said they will not return to schools 
until all students are vaccinated. As a 
reminder, there is currently no ap-
proved vaccine for children under the 
age of 16 and, likely, won’t be for some 
time. Yet even with no return to in- 
person learning in sight, teachers are 
still receiving the vaccine, which I 
think is a good thing. More shots in 
arms ought to be all of our goal. 
But as you can imagine, the Biden 
administration is having a tough time 
explaining this one away—how, on one 
hand, the President said, ‘‘Let’s get 
children safely back into classrooms,’’ 
and, on the other hand, many teachers 
unions refusing to return. 
In a recent television appearance, the 
President’s Chief of Staff was asked 
why the teachers unions are overruling 
what the studies would otherwise show, 
and he appeared to come to the defense 
of the unions’ decision. Well, that is 
not a commitment to science, and it is 
important that all of us listen to the 
science when we make our decisions 
and that they not be made based on a 
political agenda or who is for or 
against the proposition. Our focus 
ought to be clearly on the students and 
the quality of education that they are 
receiving, as well as the collateral 
damage that is being done by keeping 
them out of the classroom. 
The science is clear. If the proper 
precautions are taken, it is safe for our 
schools to reopen. Again, we have pro-
vided tens of billions of dollars to sup-
port safe reopening, including $55 bil-
lion to K–12 schools in the omnibus 
that was signed into law just last De-
cember, just about a month ago. 
This funding is helping schools safely 
welcome their students back to the 
classroom, where they can better learn, 
socialize, and build a strong foundation 
for a successful future. 
We need our children to be well edu-
cated. This is the fundamental right in 
our democracy and a necessity in a 
self-governing form of government. 
The administration shouldn’t try to 
distance itself from the President’s 100- 
day promise. It should do more to en-
courage a safe return. When it comes 
to reopening schools, President Biden 
needs to take his own advice and listen 
to the science and not the teachers 
unions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
S. CON. RES. 5 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we 
are 11 months into the most severe 
healthcare crisis this country or the 
world has seen in more than a century. 
And for much of this past year, we 
haven’t done anywhere close to enough 
to help the millions of Americans who 
are suffering—suffering not only from 
the virus itself but from the economic 
implosion created by this pandemic. 
The American people are in desperate 
need of help. It has been many, many 
months since we passed the CARES 
Act. It was way back in March of last 
year. That is a long time ago—10 
months ago. Then the House, down this 
hallway, in May—middle of May— 
passed the Heroes Act, saying: Let’s do 
what we need to do for healthcare and 
housing, for education, for creating 
good-paying jobs to help America ad-
dress both the healthcare side and the 
economic side of this pandemic. And 
this Senate said no. This Senate said: 
We are sorry. We spent all of our 
money on tax breaks for the richest 
Americans. We don’t have the re-
sources to help out ordinary Americans 
in the face of this pandemic. We prefer 
to do nothing. 
And the prefer-to-do-nothing leader-
ship of this body proceeded to do noth-
ing in June and July and August and 
September and October, into Novem-
ber. Meanwhile, the American people 
were gearing up for an election, to ba-
sically weigh in on the direction that 
this country was going, and here the 
Senate sat and did nothing in the face 
of 
millions 
of 
struggling 
families 
across our country. Finally, after the 
election, a minimal amount was done 
with the omnibus bill. 
Well, the time for playing the fiddle 
while Rome burns or twiddling our 
thumbs while America suffers is over.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S278 
February 3, 2021 
In the campaign, Democrats said: We 
will end the inaction of this Senate in 
addressing the Nation’s challenges, the 
families’ struggle across America, if 
you put us in a place to do so. 
And they did. To the House down the 
hall, this Chamber, and the White 
House down Pennsylvania Avenue, the 
American said: Get your act together. 
Engage in competent, professional, di-
rect, bold assistance to these enormous 
challenges we face. 
And Joe Biden promised that if elect-
ed President, he would utilize every re-
source of the Federal Government to 
take on the COVID pandemic and help 
American families get back on their 
feet. 
The American people spoke loudly. 
They spoke clearly, and now we intend 
to deliver on the promises and provide 
real help to American families and 
businesses struggling in these difficult 
times. 
There are a variety of ways that we 
can go forward to address this chal-
lenge. Certainly, one is to have a bill 
on this floor, have it open to amend-
ments—relevant amendments, germane 
amendments—proceed to see what the 
majority of this body, 51 Members, 
would say should be changed in that 
bill or modified in that bill. But that 
tradition has been absolutely squashed 
by the leadership in this Senate over 
the past few years under Republican 
leadership. I would like to see it re-
stored. I would like to see it restored, 
but with it goes not blocking the bill 
from leaving this Chamber after thor-
ough deliberation has occurred. 
We know that in the 6 years that 
President Johnson led this Chamber, 
there was not but one—one—blockade 
to keep bills that had received major-
ity support from leaving this Chamber. 
But in the 6 years that Harry Reid led 
this Chamber, there were over 400 
times that the minority said: No, we 
will not let this bill leave this Cham-
ber. 
That is exactly—exactly—the type of 
obstruction and delay that is making 
this Chamber dysfunctional. We have 
already seen it in terms of the orga-
nizing resolution. It is still not done— 
still not done—because the minority 
leader—now-Minority 
Leader 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL—wants to delay and ob-
struct, delay and obstruct, delay and 
obstruct, delay and obstruct, as he did 
from the time the House passed the He-
roes Act until the modest bill in De-
cember. 
I would love to see this bill—this $1.9 
trillion bill—on this floor and let the 
majority works its way. Ask if more 
money was needed to help children re-
turn to the classroom—my colleague 
from Texas was just addressing that 
topic—and more assistance in helping 
families still unemployed by the melt-
down, more assistance to the small 
businesses. Or maybe some Members 
would like to propose less help here or 
less help there, but that goes with the 
ability to move the bill quickly for ac-
tion. We await that kind of pledge, 
that kind of pledge to end the delay- 
and-obstruct tactics of the minority. 
In the meantime, therefore, we must 
go forward on a double path and say we 
will prepare to go through the rec-
onciliation process, the simple major-
ity process that comes from the Budget 
Act of 1973—the same process Repub-
licans have used time and time again 
to give tax breaks to the richest Amer-
icans. Any process used in that fashion, 
I think, was abused. But using it to 
help ordinary families get back on 
their feet—that honors that process. 
Where do we stand now? One in five 
renters in America are behind on pay-
ing their rent because they are strug-
gling financially. Nearly 24 million 
Americans, 11 percent of all adults, re-
port not having enough food in their 
homes. Millions of children are affected 
by that shortage of food. Millions of 
American children are going hungry. 
That is where we are right now. Hun-
dreds of thousands of businesses are 
shuttering their doors for good, and 
hundreds of thousands more are on the 
verge of doing so. Too many classrooms 
echo with the sounds of silence rather 
than the laughter of children. 
This bill is about changing that. We 
need to move quickly. Our children are 
struggling so hard to do their class 
work over a computer, over a Zoom. It 
is so hard to feel good about life when 
you don’t have the chance to play and 
interact with other children, so de-
pressing when you are trapped in a 
house. 
Yes, we need to reopen the schools. 
So let’s pass this bill, and let’s pass 
this bill quickly, and let’s get those 
$1,400 payments in the hands of adults 
and children, stimulating the economy 
from the foundation up—not Wall 
Street down, the foundation up—help-
ing struggling families, helping strug-
gling small businesses—Main Street, 
not Wall Street—payments that will 
help put food on the table, keep the 
lights turned on, keep the internet 
turned on, make sure that a family 
doesn’t suffer eviction. 
And strengthen the payments for 
those who need it most, the unem-
ployed. Now, we are facing a deadline 
of March 14—March 14—when the Fed-
eral partnership in supporting the un-
employment benefits runs out. So we 
must act before that happens. 
Those who know the reconciliation 
process know that it is lightning fast 
to do it in a 6-week period, but that is 
what we must do, and we must start 
now. If, in the meantime, the minority 
decides to abandon its dedication to ob-
struction and delay and be full partici-
pants in helping America, then let’s 
get that bill on the floor and go that 
path. I am fine with that, but it cannot 
prevent us from acting. 
We were elected to act. The Amer-
ican people support strong, bold, gen-
erous action now to prevent years and 
years of recession ahead, of struggling 
ahead. 
These are unprecedented times, and 
in unprecedented difficult times we 
need to think of ourselves as all one 
community. We need to help and part-
ner with our States and our counties 
and our cities and our Tribes. We need 
to get them the help they need that 
has been so fiercely opposed—help to 
enable them to do basic education im-
provements, basic public safety, mak-
ing sure that the firefighters and police 
officers and teachers are still able to do 
the work they are called upon to do, 
and help those Tribal governments pur-
chase personal protective equipment 
and have access to telemedicine serv-
ices. 
There are no blue and red commu-
nities when it comes to a national cri-
sis across this country. When it comes 
to disease, it affects people, regardless 
of which party you belong to or what 
part of the country you live in. A bi-
partisan attack on our health should 
involve a bipartisan response in this 
Chamber, 
not 
the 
obstruction-and- 
delay tactics the majority has come to 
view as their core strategy. It must 
end. 
When hundreds of mayors wrote to us 
and said ‘‘We need help; act now,’’ they 
weren’t 
Democratic 
mayors; 
they 
weren’t Republican mayors. They were 
bipartisan mayors from all across this 
country saying: Now is the time. We 
need help now. 
Yet delay and obstruction was the 
strategy of the minority. They had 
spent all their money, they said, giving 
tax breaks to the richest Americans. 
There is no room to help ordinary 
working Americans. 
That philosophy doesn’t belong in a 
government of, by, and for the people. 
If you want a government of, by, and 
for the powerful, then find a different 
Constitution, a different system of gov-
ernment. But here the people have spo-
ken. They have spoken clearly, and it 
is our responsibility to respond. 
To those mayors, those bipartisan 
mayors, across this country: We hear 
you, and we stand with you. Let’s move 
promptly and boldly to address this 
crisis. 
The President has put out a very 
clear plan that addresses every signifi-
cant area that the mayors and commu-
nity leaders across this country have 
said they need help in. Let’s be their 
partner in that assistance and put 
America back on its feet.

HONORING OFFICER BRIAN D. SICKNICK 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, a few 
minutes ago, I had the opportunity to 
pay my respects to U.S. Capitol Police 
Officer Brian Sicknick, who lies in 
honor right now in the Capitol Ro-
tunda. 
By all accounts, Brian Sicknick de-
cided early on that he wanted to be a 
police officer. He joined the National 
Guard as a way to achieve this, serving 
our country for 6 years before finally 
joining the Capitol Police in 2008. 
On January 6, 2021, he joined his fel-
low police officers to defend the Cap-
itol from invasion by a violent mob. He

was attacked by the invaders, pepper- 
sprayed twice, and reportedly hit in 
the head with a fire extinguisher. He 
later collapsed at his office as a result 
of his injuries and was transported to 
the hospital, where he died the next 
day. 
While reading accounts of Officer 
Sicknick’s death, I was particularly 
struck by reports that he returned to 
his division office after the day that he 
had had. A lot of us, after having been 
pepper-sprayed twice and hit on the 
head, would probably have made a bee-
line for the hospital or for home. Even 
if, like Officer Sicknick, we weren’t 
aware of just how badly we had been 
injured, I am not sure we would have 
returned to the office. But Officer 
Sicknick did. 
His 
family 
noted 
that 
Officer 
Sicknick had ‘‘an incredible work 
ethic. He was very serious about show-
ing up to work on time and refused to 
call out sick unless absolutely nec-
essary.’’ 
We saw that dedication on January 6. 
His first thought was not of his injuries 
but of the job that he was committed 
to. 
We are the beneficiaries of the serv-
ice and dedication of men and women 
like Brian Sicknick, men and women 
who get up every day not knowing 
what they will face but willing to sac-
rifice up to and including their very 
lives to protect those that need pro-
tecting. 
In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells his 
disciples, ‘‘Greater love hath no man 
than this, that a man lay down his life 
for his friends.’’ 
All of us marvel and are moved when 
we hear stories of those who have laid 
down their lives to protect others: the 
soldier who jumps on a grenade to save 
his buddies, the mother who leaps in 
front of her child to protect her, the 
firefighter who dies trying to rescue 
someone from a burning house. 
But Officer Sicknick’s story hits par-
ticularly 
sharply 
because 
Officer 
Sicknick laid down his life for us. He 
died for us. He died for me, for every 
Senator in this Chamber, and for every 
Representative, for every staff mem-
ber, for every cafeteria worker and 
maintenance worker and administra-
tive worker in the Capitol Complex. 
We were in danger, and he stepped 
forward to protect us. And he died for 
us. Greater love hath no man than this. 
There is no repaying such a sacrifice. 
There is no earning it. We can only 
honor it and try to live our lives in 
such a way as to be worthy of it. 
Officer Brian Sicknick died as he 
lived: defending the U.S. Capitol and 
all those within it. 
My thoughts and prayers are with Of-
ficer Sicknick’s family and with all 
those who loved him as they mourn the 
life of this brave man. 
BIPARTISANSHIP 
Mr. President, in his victory speech 
and later in his inauguration address, 
President Biden made it clear that he 
intended to govern for all Americans. 
He pledged to be ‘‘a President who 
seeks not to divide, but to unify. Who 
doesn’t see Red and Blue states but a 
United States. And who will work with 
all my heart to win the confidence of 
the whole people.’’ 
I was encouraged by his words and 
hopeful of the potential for a new day 
in American politics and real bipar-
tisan legislative work on the priorities 
facing the American people. It is still a 
hope I have, but I am discouraged by 
the path that we are on here in Con-
gress. 
Yesterday, Senate Democrats voted 
to proceed to a budget resolution de-
signed to allow Democrats to pass 
COVID legislation on a purely partisan 
basis. 
As I noted a couple of weeks ago, it 
is common to talk about unity at inau-
gurations. I have been to a lot of them, 
but all too often that commitment is 
quickly forgotten. And, unfortunately, 
we are already seeing signs that Mem-
bers of the Democrat leadership are 
rapidly abandoning the President’s call 
for bipartisanship. 
Democrats’ turn toward budget rec-
onciliation—a process that allows cer-
tain legislation to pass the Senate with 
a simple majority instead of 60 votes, 
which is normal here—would be more 
understandable if Republicans had cat-
egorically refused to consider any addi-
tional COVID legislation, but that isn’t 
even close to being the case. 
Republicans share Democrats’ com-
mitment to COVID priorities, like vac-
cinating Americans and getting our 
children back in the classroom. In fact, 
we passed five—five—COVID relief bills 
so far in Congress, totaling more than 
$4 trillion, and every single one of 
those bills was passed under Repub-
lican leadership in the Senate, with bi-
partisan cooperation, at the 60-vote 
threshold. 
Just this week, a group of 10 Repub-
licans outlined a $600 billion COVID 
proposal that would fund vaccine dis-
tribution, extend enhanced unemploy-
ment benefits, and provide additional 
economic support to Americans who 
need it most. And on Monday night, at 
the same time that Speaker PELOSI re-
leased her budget bill, those 10 Repub-
licans were meeting with President 
Biden in the Oval Office for 2 hours. 
Republicans are more than ready to 
work with Democrats on additional 
COVID relief. Now, I won’t pretend 
that we don’t have reservations about 
some of the measures that Democrats 
have proposed. For instance, I don’t 
think an emergency COVID bill is the 
place to push through a change that 
would more than double the Federal 
minimum wage and directly increase 
expenses on businesses that have been 
decimated by the pandemic. 
I also think that sending checks to 
those who don’t need them and won’t 
spend them is not a good use of tax-
payer money. 
But disagreement over aspects of the 
Democrat proposal does not mean that 
Republicans are not willing to work 
with Democrats on COVID relief. 
Democrats’ move toward a purely 
partisan pathway on COVID legislation 
is troubling, but what is even more dis-
turbing is the noise that Democrats are 
making about gutting the Byrd rule, 
which was named for and introduced by 
Democrat Senator Robert Byrd of West 
Virginia and adopted to prevent abuse 
of the budget reconciliation process 
and protect the rights of the minority 
in the Senate. 
It limits the proposals that can be 
considered under budget reconciliation 
so that the majority party in the Sen-
ate cannot use the budget reconcili-
ation process to push through any leg-
islation it wants with a bare majority 
vote. 
But some Democrats are suggesting 
doing away with the Byrd rule as a way 
of getting around the legislative fili-
buster, and that is a big problem. Pre-
serving minority rights was a priority 
for the Founders. They knew that, in 
democratic forms of government, ty-
rannical majorities could easily tram-
ple the rights of the minority, so they 
were determined to put in place a sys-
tem of checks and balances that would 
protect the rights of the minority. 
One of those checks was the U.S. 
Senate. And as time has gone on, the 
legislative filibuster is the Senate rule 
that has had perhaps the greatest im-
pact on protecting minority rights in 
the Senate. 
But the Byrd rule has played a key 
role as well. By limiting Senators’ abil-
ity to use budget reconciliation to get 
around the filibuster, the Byrd rule has 
helped ensure that the minority has at 
least some voice in most legislation 
passed by the Senate. 
In 2017, when Republicans held the 
majority in Congress as well as the 
White House, there were calls within 
our party to gut the Byrd rule and to 
abolish the filibuster, but the Repub-
lican majority in the Senate refused. 
We knew that abolishing the legisla-
tive filibuster, or de facto abolishing it 
by gutting the Byrd rule, would seri-
ously weaken minority representation 
in the Senate. 
So for the long-term good of the Sen-
ate and the country, we refused. We 
knew that it would be a betrayal of our 
obligation to Senators to undermine 
the Senate’s key role as a protector of 
minority rights. 
I would just remind Democrats that, 
back in 2017, they strongly agreed with 
our decision. I trust that their opinion 
has not changed simply because they 
are now in the majority. 
Minority representation would be im-
portant even if elections tended to 
break 60–40 or 70–30 in favor of one 
party or another across the country. 
All Americans deserve to be rep-
resented in government, but it is par-
ticularly important when you consider 
that our country and the Senate is 
pretty evenly split right down the mid-
dle, which means any attempt to dis-
enfranchise the minority party means 
disenfranchising half of the entire 
country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S280 
February 3, 2021 
While the far-left wing of the Demo-
crat party would like to use this elec-
tion to implement every extreme, pie- 
in-the-sky, socialist proposal on its 
list, that is not what the American 
people voted for in this election. Amer-
icans voted for a Presidential can-
didate historically regarded as a mod-
erate. 
Democrats lost seats in the House of 
Representatives. And while, thanks to 
the Vice President, they have a tie- 
breaking vote in the Senate, they did 
not actually win a majority of seats in 
the Senate. 
My point very simply is that if any 
mandate was given in this election, it 
was a mandate for moderation, for bi-
partisanship, for unity. And I hope that 
Democrats remember that and resist 
calls from the far left to gut the Sen-
ate’s rules and fundamentally change 
the character of this institution. 
I still believe that we can come to-
gether in this Congress to address the 
challenges facing our country, but it is 
going to require a lot more bipartisan-
ship than we are seeing from a lot of 
Democrats. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HONORING BRIAN D. SICKNICK 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just re-
turned from the memorial service for 
Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. 
It was held in the Rotunda of the U.S. 
Capitol, a place which is reserved on 
such occasions for those who have 
brought special honor to the United 
States. It was appropriate that Brian 
Sicknick receive that honor. 
On January 6, Capitol Police Officer 
Brian Sicknick reported for duty and 
never returned home. A simple red 
wooden box contained his remains at 
the service. Tributes were given to 
him, all deserved, because this man 
gave his life to protect our Nation, to 
protect me. 
It was protection from an enemy— 
not foreign enemy but, as we say in our 
oath, a domestic enemy, American- 
born and -bred terrorists who streamed 
into this Capitol building on January 6 
at the instigation of President Donald 
Trump. He had summoned them to 
Washington on that day because the 
Constitution required that the Con-
gress meet that day, that we count the 
electoral votes and announce to Amer-
ica who would be the next President of-
ficially. We knew the results State by 
State. They had been verified over and 
over again, challenged and verified 
again. 
But this was the formal ceremony 
which involved calling the States and 
the vote counts in the House, and if 
there 
were 
objections, 
considering 
them, the objections, in both the House 
and the Senate. That was the process 
that President Donald Trump set out 
to disrupt, so he called a rally of his 
loyal followers. They met on the El-
lipse. He fired up the crowd and sent 
them to the Capitol Building to stop 
the count—as they said in their warped 
logic, ‘‘stop the steal.’’ 
They weren’t permitted to enter the 
building, and so they broke it down— 
the doors, the windows. We have seen 
the videos over and over. They as-
saulted every law enforcement officer 
who 
stood 
in 
their 
way. 
Brian 
Sicknick, of course, lost his life, but 
there were 140 other police officers who 
were beaten and maimed and stabbed, 
who still suffer from those injuries 
today. The same terrorist mob that 
took Brian Sicknick’s life stormed past 
everyone who stood in their path. What 
a day in the history of the United 
States of America. 
Their occupation of the Capitol in-
cluded their occupation of this Cham-
ber. They marched into this Chamber, 
opening desks, taking photographs of 
documents, posing for pictures at the 
President’s chair. They had a jolly 
time showing off to their friends that 
they could take over the U.S. Senate. 
Next week, we begin the impeach-
ment trial. The House of Representa-
tives has accused this President of in-
stigating an insurrection. When you 
think of it, could there be anything 
more serious than provoking a group 
for the violent overthrow of a legiti-
mate government process? 
Some say we shouldn’t do this im-
peachment. They argue any speech 
given by the President to his mob was 
protected by the First Amendment. 
Well, if the First Amendment was de-
signed to protect activities to over-
throw our government, then it was a 
recipe for democracy that would die of 
its own accord. I think we know better. 
The Founding Fathers expressly in-
cluded the impeachment clause in the 
Constitution for a President who would 
be so bold as to challenge the very ex-
istence of our democracy and the 
peaceful transition of power. 
After the ceremony in the Rotunda, I 
went to the Rayburn Room in the 
House and met with Officer Sicknick’s 
family. We stood and talked for a few 
minutes. In respect to them, I will not 
repeat our conversation, but I am 
going to remember it, and I am going 
to remember them. And although I 
didn’t meet him personally, I will re-
member him next week when this im-
peachment trial is underway. 
For anyone who makes the argument 
that when it comes to January 6, it is 
time for America to ‘‘get over it,’’ I am 
going to remember one Capitol Police 
officer who gave his life to protect me 
and this Capitol. I am also going to re-
member his family, the loss that they 
have endured because of a political ex-
ercise based on a big lie propagated by 
the former President of the United 
States. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, the headline in last 
Thursday’s Chicago Sun-Times cap-
tured the grim reality of tens of mil-
lions of Americans desperately seeking 
a COVID vaccine. The headline read: 
‘‘Looking for a vaccine appointment at 
your pharmacy? Get ready for ‘The 
Hunger Games.’ ’’ For those who don’t 
know ‘‘The Hunger Games,’’ it is a fic-
tional book turned into a movie about 
a dystopian future where people are 
forced to fight one another to the 
death just to survive. 
The Chicago Sun-Times assigned two 
reporters to try to book COVID–19 vac-
cine appointments for relatives older 
than 65 in any one of the major drug-
store chains in the Chicago area. The 
results were discouraging. The websites 
were hard to navigate, appointments 
were scarce to nonexistent, and even 
when they searched for appointments 
in pharmacies as far as 50 miles away, 
no luck. 
Reporters spoke to people who had 
gone online at 2 in the morning in the 
hopes of landing a coveted vaccination 
slot—no luck. They spoke to a Chicago- 
area woman who had been trying for 
days to book a vaccination appoint-
ment for her mother, who is 75 years 
old and battling cancer. That woman 
knew too well what failing to receive a 
vaccination could mean. Her mother- 
in-law is recovering from the virus. Her 
85-year-old father died from it 1 week 
shy of his first official vaccination. 
After several frustrating days, she was 
finally able to book an appointment for 
her mother to be vaccinated. She is re-
lieved for her mother. She is worried 
about others who are eligible but can’t 
find a vaccination. She said, ‘‘It’s not 
fair. It’s absolutely ridiculous.’’ 
Earlier this week, Illinois adminis-
tered its one-millionth dose of COVID 
vaccine—an important milestone—but 
in my State and nearly every State, 
the process for distributing vaccines or 
getting shots in the arm is still too 
limited, too slow, too confusing. Too 
many elderly and other eligible Ameri-
cans are still scrambling to receive the 
vaccination. 
Let me say in defense of the State I 
proudly 
represent. 
Under 
Governor 
Pritzker, we have a pretty good record 
of vaccination rates. He is doing his 
best. Unfortunately, the supply is lim-
ited and he needs more, and he cer-
tainly has plenty of people anxious for 
it. 
This isn’t just a Chicago problem. It 
is a statewide problem. It is a nation-
wide problem. It reflects that while the 
Trump administration worked quickly 
to discover the vaccine, it failed to 
work with the States in implementing 
a plan to vaccinate people. 
When Joe Biden took office, there 
were more COVID–19 vaccines in freez-
ers than in the arms of Americans. 
That was 10 or 12 days ago. The results 
of those earlier missteps are stag-
gering. Today, the United States, with 
5 percent of the world’s population, is 
home to more than 20 percent of the

February 3, 2021 
COVID infections and deaths. As of 
Monday, more than 26 million Ameri-
cans have been infected and nearly 
440,000 Americans have died of COVID– 
19. In my State of Illinois, we have seen 
1.1 million infections and more than 
19,000 deaths. 
Even as the Trump administration 
tried to conceal the truth and squan-
dered precious time in responding to 
this crisis, other Americans were work-
ing heroically to protect their neigh-
bors and friends. These heroes included 
doctors and nurses on the frontline, or-
derlies who kept hospitals and health 
centers clean and safe, even grocery 
store clerks, truckdrivers, mail car-
riers, teachers, and many other essen-
tial workers. They worked around the 
clock. They included brilliant sci-
entists and researchers who not only 
developed COVID vaccines but watched 
for the variants that were emerging 
that may or may not be protected. 
Sadly, 
their 
dedication 
was 
not 
matched by the performance of the pre-
vious administration. President Biden 
is trying to change that. He is trying 
to dramatically increase the produc-
tion of vaccine and also the distribu-
tion. His plan sets some worthy goals: 
100 million Americans vaccinated in 100 
days. Boy, I want him to be right. He 
even said there may be more if we 
count to the end of the summer. We 
want to get a pace and have a momen-
tum to break the back of this pandemic 
once and for all. He calls it the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. It includes necessary 
assistance for vaccinations first and 
foremost, and it should, but then it 
speaks to the economic crisis that also 
devastates this country. 
His plan provides economic assist-
ance for small businesses—many just 
barely hanging on; extends unemploy-
ment relief for millions of Americans 
who lost their jobs; and increases fund-
ing for food stamps, SNAP benefits, so 
that 1 in 10 Americans who right now 
can’t afford to put food on the table 
have an alternative. The President’s 
American Rescue Plan includes funding 
to dramatically ramp up production of 
COVID treatment. It includes funding 
to help schools and universities reopen 
safely and stay open. It includes fund-
ing to help get teachers vaccinated and 
key administrators. 
The 
American 
Rescue 
Plan 
rep-
resents the best thinking of leading 
economists and public health experts. 
We can debate it if we wish, but we 
can’t drag our feet. We can’t waste a 
day. People are dying every minute. In 
fact, every 30 seconds, another Amer-
ican dies from COVID–19. 
As the virus circulates and replicates 
and 
we 
dither, 
variants 
emerge, 
mutations emerge, and we wonder if 
our vaccine is ready for them. Sci-
entists warn that our current COVID 
vaccines are less effective with new 
strains. We could rush through this 
double-shot vaccination across Amer-
ica and perhaps reach our goal sooner 
rather than later and find that some 
mutant or variant is a new challenge 
that requires a booster shot. 
I am not a scientist. I certainly don’t 
have a medical degree. I am not pro-
fessing any expertise. But we do know 
that variations are emerging, and 
shame on us if they don’t spur us to ac-
tion as quickly as possible. We are in a 
life-and-death struggle, a race against 
the 
clock 
to 
vaccinate 
Americans 
against the variants before they be-
come dominant. 
The cost of the rescue plan that 
President Biden has proposed is $1.9 
trillion—about the same as the CARES 
plan that the Senate passed a year ago. 
We passed it with 96 votes a year ago. 
We passed some $900 billion more this 
last December. This $1.9 trillion is no 
small sum, but do you know what 
would be even more expensive? Con-
tinuing down this path of the pan-
demic, watching this deadly virus mu-
tate and eat up companies and jobs and 
hope and education for our kids. Doing 
nothing is unacceptable. Doing too lit-
tle is unacceptable. 
Remember when you took your kids 
to the doctor with that earache or sore 
throat or whatever it was? He said: I 
will tell you what I can do, Dad. I am 
going to give you a prescription for 
your little child, and it is for 5 days on 
the antibiotic. Now, I have to warn you 
ahead of time that the child is going to 
start looking better and feeling better 
in 2 days and, in 3 days, will want to 
run outside and play with the other 
kids, and you are going to think, 
‘‘Fine, that is behind us,’’ but don’t do 
it. Give that antibiotic all 5 days be-
cause we know, in many cases, if you 
stop giving the antibiotic, the illness 
returns. 
A similar situation faces us with 
COVID–19. If we don’t put enough into 
the vaccination effort, if we don’t put 
enough into strengthening the econ-
omy, if we don’t put enough into sus-
taining those unemployed and under-
employed—if we don’t put enough into 
this—we will be back again. It may not 
be $1.9 trillion then. It may be even 
more. So shouldn’t we take all of our 
medicine? Shouldn’t we do it as most 
doctors and, in this case, economists 
order to make certain that we have a 
positive impact on the economy? 
Now I want to say a word about the 
10 Republican Senators who met with 
the President of the United States the 
day before yesterday. 
I thank the President for the meeting 
because he was sincere, and I was told 
by those who attended that he was re-
sponsive to their questions, and he was 
well prepared. When they went in and 
started talking about the different pro-
grams and how much we should spend 
on each one, one Republican Senator 
said: He had a sheet of paper in front of 
him, with a few things written on it, 
and for 2 hours, we kept active con-
versation. It was like another Member 
of the Senate speaking to these 10 Re-
publicans. That to me is gratifying. It 
is the reason I supported this man to 
become our President. I knew he would 
be ready for the job and anxious to try 
to bring America back together. 
So the 10 Republicans who met with 
him have said they want to work on a 
bipartisan basis. Well, I know them. I 
know each and every one of them pret-
ty well. I sat through those meetings 
with them before, when we prepared 
the last COVID relief bill. They are sin-
cere. They are well prepared. They 
argue their cases. Even if I disagree 
with them, I respect the way they 
argue. 
I would say to them there are two 
things that are critically important. 
First, respond quickly. We can’t drag 
this out for weeks or months. It is un-
acceptable. We have deadlines looming 
in the middle of March when unem-
ployment benefits are going to be cut 
off for many Americans, and we cer-
tainly have a vaccination crisis we 
have to address right now. Secondly, 
don’t err on the side of stopping the 
medicine before you are really pro-
tected and well. We need to put the 
medicine into the economy. I am talk-
ing about the dollars—the money—into 
the economy to get people back to 
work so that schools can reopen, for 
goodness’ sake. Anyone with a child or 
a 
grandchild 
knows 
this 
is 
unsustainable for these kids to be out 
of the classroom. It is hurting them, 
and it is holding them back in terms of 
their educations. It needs to end and 
end quickly. 
So, to my Republican friends, thank 
you for joining us, but stick with us for 
a real solution to this. We can’t delay. 
Every day we wait is another day that 
this virus mutates and grows stronger. 
Every day we delay, thousands of 
Americans die from this virus; busi-
nesses close; workers lose jobs; families 
get more desperate. This is terrific dev-
astation we have lived through, but it 
can come out right in the end if we 
stick together on a bipartisan basis as 
a nation. 
We are going to soon deal with the 
budget resolution here on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate and then move to rec-
onciliation. I have tried my best, 
though I have been a Member of the 
Senate for a number of years, to under-
stand reconciliation and, particularly, 
to understand the famous Byrd rule. It 
is named after a man who was a Sen-
ator for many years, from West Vir-
ginia, named Robert C. Byrd. He used 
to sit at that desk. 
When he came to the floor, there was 
such respect for him and his knowledge

your remarks until he is finished. That 
was done over and over again. As a new 
Member of the Senate, I thought: Who 
is this man? Well, I came to understand 
the reputation which he had garnered 
in the U.S. Senate and he, I suppose— 
maybe others with him—was the au-
thor of the reconciliation process. 
Originally,

tended—I underline ‘‘may’’—for deficit 
reduction. Now it is something dif-
ferent. Deficit reduction is not the goal

per se. Instead, there have to be meas-
urable revenues and losses involved in 
any proposal within reconciliation. 
Holding to the Byrd rule is going to 
be a matter of interpretation by the 
Senate Parliamentarian and a decision 
by the Senate as to whether that inter-
pretation will be respected. There 
could be items that are objected to by 
the Parliamentarian and others that 
will be accepted. I think it is too early 
to speculate on that, but it is one of 
the more arcane elements of the Sen-
ate rule process; yet it has a massive 
impact. 
Years ago, when the Republicans 
were in similar positions as the Demo-
crats, they used reconciliation for tax 
cuts. Some who believed that reconcili-
ation dealt with deficit reduction could 
never 
understand 
how 
a 
tax 
cut 
wouldn’t add to the deficit. They ar-
gued the other way. They prevailed. 
Reconciliation was used for a tax cut. 
Now we come up with a proposal, the 
American Rescue Plan, which either, in 
part or in whole, is going to be offered 
in reconciliation, and the question is 
whether each category of that plan 
that is included in reconciliation is eli-
gible under the Senate rules. 
I will say there is one fundamental 
difference which one of my colleagues 
raised earlier. Instead of talking about 
tax cuts for the wealthiest, we are pro-
posing changes in the reconciliation for 
the American Rescue package by Presi-
dent Biden which are really designed to 
help working families and those who 
are struggling in our economy. 
For instance, the tax changes that 
are proposed in the American Rescue 
Plan, if they are included in reconcili-
ation, will include additional assist-
ance to families with children. There 
will be substantial tax relief and tax 
credits—refundable 
tax 
credits—to 
those in poverty, raising children. We 
have economists who tell us that, if the 
Biden proposal on these tax benefits for 
families with children are enacted into 
law, we will cut child poverty in half in 
America. Think about that—a dra-
matic change. 
We hear so many conversations about 
the state of the economy, of those who 
are being left behind, and whether or 
not income inequality is going to be 
addressed. Starting with the children, I 
will say to President Biden, is the right 
starting point. It would be wonderful if 
we had bipartisan support for helping 
these kids. I can tell you this: The 
money it costs for these tax cuts and 
credits is far less than the expense that 
would be incurred by America as a na-
tion if these kids don’t have an oppor-
tunity to grow up healthy, educated, 
and productive. So I am watching care-
fully as this debate continues. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
we are just weeks into a new adminis-
tration, and all hopes and promise of 
bipartisanship have been rejected. 
The Biden administration and my 
Democratic colleagues in the Senate 
lasted 10 days before they ditched any 
attempt at real compromise. Now, in-
stead of working together to provide 
targeted relief to those who are hurt-
ing from the coronavirus pandemic, the 
Democrats are moving forward with a 
reconciliation process to pass a nearly 
$2 trillion spending bill. 
Reconciliation is a process that was 
created to make quick changes related 
to budget and spending that were as-
sumed to have gotten bipartisan sup-
port. It was never meant to be a tool to 
pass major legislation, but the Demo-
crats know they can’t pass their harm-
ful policies through legislation, so they 
are looking for any tool they can find 
to ram them through the process. 
Senators SCHUMER and SANDERS keep 
pushing forward, without Republican 
support, to get the changes they need 
no matter what—no matter that the 
spending package includes a number of 
liberal policies that have nothing to do 
with the coronavirus; no matter that 
the spending package has a bailout of 
wasteful liberal States for their dec-
ades of mismanagement even though 
the latest data show that States across 
the country are reporting positive in-
come growth; no matter that the $2 
trillion would throw our Nation even 
deeper into unsustainable debt, hurting 
American families. 
We need to be very clear about this: 
America is in a debt crisis, and we need 
to start talking about it and taking de-
cisive action to reverse course. 
In 2020 alone, the Federal Govern-
ment increased its debt by more than 
$4 trillion. To date, it sits at a mas-
sive—an 
unsustainable—$27 
trillion. 
That is why, every time I am faced 
with a question of spending taxpayer 
dollars, I ask myself some simple yet 
important questions: What is the plan 
to pay for it? What is the return on in-
vestment for American families? Does 
the proposal include measures to pre-
vent waste and fraud and ensure ac-
countability? 
Asking these questions isn’t a novel 
idea. It is the same process I went 
through every day when I was the Gov-
ernor of Florida, and it is what most 
Americans go through when making fi-
nancial decisions at home or for their 
businesses. No family would needlessly 
spend money without a plan, and no 
business can afford to not get a return 
on its investment. 
Spending without consequence isn’t 
how things work in the real world, and 
it is not how things should work in 
government. Congress’s decades of fail-
ure to think and act responsibly has 
led to enormous deficits—insurmount-
able debt—and out-of-control spending, 
but instead of getting serious about 
this 
debt 
and 
its 
inevitable 
con-
sequences, the Democrats are focused 
on more government, more spending, 
higher taxes, and no accountability. 
Biden’s nominees are no different. 
In 2018, Janet Yellen, Biden’s new 
Treasury Secretary, was quoted as 
speaking about the unsustainable U.S. 
debt and said: ‘‘If I had a magic wand, 
I would raise taxes.’’ How is that good 
for an American family? 
Mayor 
Pete 
Buttigieg, 
the 
new 
Transportation Secretary, said he is 
open to raising the gas tax on Amer-
ican families. How is that good for an 
American family? 
Neera Tanden, tapped to run the Of-
fice of Management and Budget, has 
been a vocal supporter of the Green 
New Deal—a $93 trillion disaster that 
would devastate our economy and kill 
jobs. How is that good for an American 
family? 
These are the people who are going to 
get our economy on track and provide 
opportunities for American families? I 
don’t think so. 
My concern about the future of our 
country cannot be understated. In Au-
gust, Congress will have to deal with 
the expiration of the debt ceiling. This 
is a critically important issue, but, for 
years, Congress has ignored it. The 
debt ceiling has been suspended for 
more than 2 years, allowing the Fed-
eral Government to spend out of con-
trol and rack up insane debt on the 
Federal credit card, and we have to pay 
interest on this debt. Right now, inter-
est rates are at historic lows—less than 
1.5 percent—and we are still paying 
nearly $350 billion in interest on our 
debt each year. Think about it. We get 
no return on any of these dollars. 
Here is a chart. Look at this. 
This is the $345 billion we are going 
to spend in interest for 2020. Look at 
these programs: Medicare, 862; Med-
icaid; defense; Social Security. Look at 
the deficit we are running of $3.3 tril-
lion. If this interest rate goes up—and 
we were already running a big deficit 
even before COVID, and we are going to 
have a deficit this year of over $1 tril-
lion—what program does somebody an-
ticipate cutting, and what taxes do 
people believe we ought to increase? 
Of the $350 billion we are going to 
spend on interest, we will get no re-
turn. There is no family that gets any 
benefit out of this interest expense un-
less you are holding treasuries. It is in-
sane, but it is not the scariest part. If 
interest rates increase to the 50-year 
average of 6.2 percent—that is the 50- 
year average—we will be obligated to 
pay $1 trillion more in interest every 
year. So look at this. If the interest 
rates go to the 50-year average, we are 
going to go from a little less than $350 
billion to over $1 trillion in interest ex-
pense. 
So if we have $1 trillion in interest 
expense, how are we going to fund all 
these programs when we are already 
running deficits? And that is if the 
debt stops growing. 
Every additional dollar in debt we 
hold increases the dollars in interest 
we owe. It is an awful cycle that has 
disastrous consequences for American 
families. 
That is why we cannot allow the debt 
ceiling to simply be suspended again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S283 
February 3, 2021 
We cannot allow a radical liberal agen-
da to destroy America’s chance to ever 
get out of this hole. 
As we recover from the pandemic, in-
flation will rise from its 2020 low of 1.4 
percent to nearly 2.3 percent or more. 
That is a 60-percent increase in infla-
tion. 
But if Congress continues to reck-
lessly spend and do nothing about our 
growing debt, inflation will increase 
higher. There is a direct link between 
the 
Federal 
Government’s 
unsustainable spending and the rising 
cost of goods and services. 
Here is what that means for Amer-
ican families: The price of everyday 
goods will rise; gas prices will rise; and 
rental housing costs will increase. 
Increases in inflation hit America’s 
hourly workers and fixed-income fami-
lies the hardest. And these hits are ex-
acerbated when liberal politicians, like 
Pete Buttigieg, get their way and raise 
the gas tax and other costs on families. 
So while politicians in Washington 
keep spending money like it is a game, 
American 
families 
suffer. 
Radical 
spending and reckless proposals di-
rectly hurt families. 
Every dollar we allocate is borrowed 
from taxpayers, and if Congress is irre-
sponsible, it is the taxpayers that suf-
fer. 
Adding insult to injury, a rise in the 
debt will also either cause or be accom-
panied by a rise in interest rates. That 
is bad for everyone. 
When interest rates increase, every-
thing from car loans, to student loans, 
to mortgages become more expensive 
for the American people. 
And the interest on our debt, which 
is already the fourth largest expendi-
ture in the Federal budget, will become 
our largest expenditure. For every 1- 
percent increase in interest rate, we 
are going to spend another $2 trillion 
over 10 years. That is more taxpayer 
money getting no return. There is 
nothing. There are no services. There 
are no products. There is nothing for 
the American consumer. 
For people on fixed incomes, their in-
comes are going to stay the same, 
while the prices of the items they buy 
will go up month after month. For 
hourly workers, wages will never go up 
fast enough to cover the ever-increas-
ing cost of goods and services. 
I know all of this sounds scary. That 
is because it is. 
Politicians in Washington are afraid 
to tell you the truth, so here it is: If 
you want our country to survive and 
thrive and continue to be a beacon for 
freedom, prosperity, and hope around 
the world, we will need to make tough 
choices after this crisis is over. We will 
need to do way more with less. We will 
need to reassert the fundamental prin-
ciple of conservatism that the private 
sector and individuals—not govern-
ment—should be the driving forces be-
hind our economic stability and suc-
cess. 
We have to stand up for these values, 
and when Democrats try to spend $2 
trillion on their priorities that have no 
bipartisan support, we have to say no. 
We have to make sure that every dollar 
is spent strategically on things that 
actually help struggling families and 
businesses. 
When Democrats want to raise taxes 
to pay for government’s wastefulness, 
we have to say no. 
Short-term solutions aren’t going to 
work anymore. We are in a battle for 
the future of our Nation, and we cannot 
relent. 
As I stated after Congress passed the 
CARES Act, once this crisis is over, we 
must make a plan to cut Federal 
spending by at least the amount we 
spent during this crisis. There is no 
other option. 
In August, Congress will once again 
confront the expiration of the debt 
ceiling. It is time to take action. It is 
time to wake up. 
We can fix this and put our Nation on 
a fiscally responsible path. We fix this 
by doing what I did in Florida. We need 
to focus on growing the economy, cut-
ting taxes and burdensome regulations, 
and streamlining permitting. We fix 
this by helping every American get a 
good job. And we fix this by getting a 
return on every taxpayer dollar we 
spend. 
I am going to keep talking about this 
issue and proposing solutions because 
this is one of the most severe and most 
ignored crises facing our Nation. It is 
not going away, and the harder the 
Democrats push their wasteful, harm-
ful proposal, the harder I am going to 
push back. This problem is only get-
ting worse. 
As long as I am a Member of the U.S. 
Senate, I will fight to rein in the out- 
of-control spending that is putting our 
children and our grandchildren’s future 
at risk. 
I will be back on this floor again and 
again until something gets done. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Vir-
ginia. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to talk about some friends of 
mine. 
Roxie 
Raines 
Kornegay 
Allison. 
Roxie Raines Kornegay Allison, my 
across-the-street neighbor for nearly 30 
years, died of COVID last Thursday 
night at 6 o’clock. Roxie has been kind 
of the matriarch and the pillar of our 
little four-block-long neighborhood. 
We have the annual party in the me-
dian in October, and Roxie kind of pre-
sides. She has been sort of the care-
taker, always taking care of a family 
member or a friend. 
One of the first persons who reached 
out to me when Roxie passed was a city 
councilman in Pasadena, CA, who had 
heard instantaneously. He used to be 
the deputy police chief in Richmond. 
He said: When I moved to Richmond, I 
didn’t know anybody. Roxie was the 
one who kind of adopted me and 
showed me the ropes in Richmond. 
Roxie was a pioneer in Virginia gov-
ernment, making opportunities for Af-
rican Americans to get hired in key po-
sitions—a civil rights leader in the 
State. 
My wife and I and our whole neigh-
borhood are just absolutely devastated 
by the loss. My wife and I were talking 
about: How old do you think Roxie is? 
We always viewed her as sort of our 
age because she is so vigorous and fun 
and lively. She is 20 years older than 
my wife and me. 
Three 
days 
before 
Roxie 
Raines 
Kornegay Allison died, another neigh-
bor of mine, Sheila Mandt, who was 55 
years old, died of COVID. Sheila was a 
dynamic activist in the Richmond 
community, with a real heart for non-
profit organizations that focused on 
the needs of survivors of domestic vio-
lence. She had done pioneering work in 
that area and worked with other orga-
nizations too, like the Salvation Army 
and others. 
She was married for a long time to 
another friend, Chris Hilbert, who had 
been a member of the Richmond City 
Council. 
Three days before Sheila Mandt died 
of COVID, Patsy Arsenault died of 
COVID in Richmond. Patsy is the 
mother of my parish priest, Father Jim 
Arsenault. It is a tiny little parish in 
Richmond, and Patsy has been very 
much a part of our parish community. 
So in 8 days, three people that I 
know died of COVID. And this morning, 
I heard early in the morning that an-
other dear friend—and I am not going 
to mention his name, but another dear 
friend of mine—is in the hospital with 
COVID and on a ventilator. He is some-
body I know very, very well. I offi-
ciated at his wedding about 15 years 
ago, when I was Governor. 
I am a healthy and wealthy and priv-
ileged person, so if this is happening to 
me in my network of friends and fam-
ily, I know it is happening to others. I 
think this now makes nine people I 
know who have died of COVID. 
I was on the phone yesterday with 
Taiwan’s representative to the United 
States—representative 
is 
essentially 
their equivalent of the Ambassador. 
She told me that Taiwan has had nine 
COVID deaths—dozens of miles from 
China. They have had nine COVID 
deaths. I haven’t gone back to check 
that, but my wife and I have nine 
friends and family, including the moth-
er-in-law of my brother, who have died 
of COVID. 
We had 3,406 deaths yesterday in the 
United States to COVID. Basically, be-
ginning on about December 20, the 
daily death toll in the United States to 
COVID has virtually every day eclipsed 
the number of Americans who were 
killed on 9/11. We have now eclipsed 
447,000 deaths to COVID. 
So my own feelings of sadness about 
my friends are just shared in common 
with everybody. Everybody has been 
touched by this—knowing somebody 
who is ill, knowing somebody who has 
died, maybe having COVID themselves,

maybe having lost a job, maybe having 
lost a business, maybe having not been 
able to go see a parent or grandparent 
in a nursing home or not been able to 
travel to see a brandnew grandchild. 
This touches everyone. It doesn’t touch 
everyone equally. Those getting COVID 
and those dying of COVID are predomi-
nantly minorities. Those losing jobs to 
COVID are predominantly minorities, 
young people working at the lowest 
end of the salary scale. 
So why do I take the floor to talk 
about Roxie and Sheila and Patsy and 
my other friend who I just learned this 
morning is on a ventilator in the hos-
pital? I take the floor because this, to 
me, is just evidence underlined with an 
exclamation point that we have to act 
promptly to provide a suffering nation 
more COVID relief, and we shouldn’t be 
stingy about it. We have to be bold 
about it because the amount of suf-
fering people in this country are under-
going is still so staggering, nearly un-
precedented. 
The scale of the problem is so big, 
the health scale of the problem—that 
many deaths and millions having had 
COVID; the economic scale of the prob-
lem—we are still down 10 million jobs 
from where we were 1 year ago, and 
that is with some significant recovery 
occasioned by the investments that 
Congress has been willing to make in 
the first five bills that we passed. Even 
with those having had significant ef-
fect on our States and communities, we 
are still down 10 million jobs. And then 
we are also down in the intangibles. It 
is not just the number of cases, the 
number of deaths, the number of hos-
pitalizations, the number of businesses 
that are closed, and the number of peo-
ple who have lost jobs; it is the scale of 
sadness and unhappiness and the con-
sequences that will go on for some sig-
nificant period of time that we are still 
living under. 
Here are two examples, and I could 
give 50, just as any Senator who stood 
on the floor could give 50 examples be-
cause we are all hearing this. The men-
tal health needs of frontline healthcare 
workers—I had a Zoom session with 
doctors and nurses around the State 
not long ago, and the stories just break 
your heart. 
One nurse said: You know, I am used 
to death. I mean, this is what I do. I 
have been a nurse for 20 years in this 
hospital, and I am sort of used to 
maybe one death per week on the shifts 
that I work. I am not used to three 
deaths on a shift day after day after 
day. 
Another nurse jumped in from a dif-
ferent part of the State and said: That 
is right. Let me tell you what the hard-
est thing is for me. 
The nurse said this: Maybe the most 
important thing I do as a healthcare 
provider is, when somebody is dying in 
the hospital, I escort their family into 
their room so that they can have some 
last moments together as a family sit-
ting around the bedside and holding 
their hand or exchanging memories 
with their parent or their spouse or a 
child or a sibling. You can’t do that 
now. People dying from COVID—be-
cause of exposure risk, I can’t make 
this place sort of a sacred place for 
family to say a last goodbye, so it is up 
to me to do it. I have to go in there, 
and I am wearing a mask; I can’t even 
smile at the person. I am probably not 
even supposed to hold their hand, but I 
do anyway. And then what I do is I 
bring in my iPad, and I hold it a few 
inches from the dying person’s face so 
that they can have an end-of-life dis-
cussion with family members who can’t 
be there at their bedside and be there 
with them. 
The nurses who told me this said this 
is really tough. It is tough to do it day 
after day after day and be the last per-
son on Earth who so many people are 
seeing and trying to manage that real-
ly intimate and important sacred mo-
ment between a dying person and their 
family when they are gasping their last 
breath. 
A third nurse then cut in and said: 
All those things are true. Let me tell 
you, for me, what is the hardest for my 
mental well-being in terms of doing 
this every day. I do what the other two 
have just described, and then I get done 
with the shift, and I am just beat, and 
I don’t want to take that home to my 
family. 
I don’t want to take that frustration 
and depression home to my family, so I 
drive around for a while until I can 
kind of clear my head. Invariably, 
when I am driving around, I will go by 
someplace like a restaurant or a bar, 
and I will see a whole lot of people 
there with each other without masks 
on, people who think the mask thing is 
fake or it is a political thing, and they 
are making a statement by not wearing 
a mask and not following basic health 
guidelines. 
After the day that I have gone 
through and the challenge to my own 
mental health in seeing this, I see that 
happening, and I am like: You are 
going to be in the hospital next week. 
Do you know what you are doing to 
yourself? Do you know what you are 
doing to your family? Do you know 
what you are doing to me? I am going 
to be having to hold that iPad in front 
of your face or maybe somebody else 
you are with as they talk to family. 
The healthcare needs of our frontline 
healthcare workers who have been be-
sieged by this pandemic—they are not 
going to go away the day we say we are 
past COVID. The challenges people 
have endured to be the heroes we claim 
them to be are not just going to imme-
diately go away. Part of this COVID re-
lief bill needs to be about keeping our 
own healers healthy. 
A second example I will give quickly 
is housing. Thank goodness, in the 
COVID bills thus far, we have been able 
to find some bipartisan agreement to 
extend evictions—put a moratorium on 
evictions, put a moratorium on fore-
closures for properties that have some 
Federal connection, financed through, 
you know, Fannie or Freddie, or FHA. 
If they have a Federal nexus, we pro-
vide an eviction moratorium. 
OK, that is really important, but 
what about when we get to the end of 
the moratorium? Families have big ob-
ligations that are backed up. Maybe 
they lost jobs or lost income. Can they 
come current then on their obligations 
when we are done with the morato-
rium, or will they then face eviction? 
After they have gone through the un-
imaginable of COVID and now we are 
past it, will they then face eviction be-
cause their resources will not be suffi-
cient to catch them up with their back- 
due obligations? 
It is not just the residents. What 
about the landlords? So many land-
lords of rental properties are small 
business owners, and they provide 
housing to families, and they have to 
pay off mortgages too. We also want 
them to keep the properties up, to keep 
them safe, to keep them habitable, to 
keep them as dignified places where 
people can live, but if rent isn’t coming 
in to them, how can they pay off their 
own obligations? How can they keep up 
the quality of housing where people 
live? 
I could have talked about the needs 
of the unemployed or the needs of peo-
ple who use childcare. At one point in 
the summer, 40 percent of childcare in-
stitutions in this country were closed 
down. That makes it so hard to open 
our businesses. I could have talked 
about the tremendous needs of small 
businesses. Thank goodness it has been 
a bipartisan priority in all the bills we 
did in 2019 to prioritize small business 
assistance. These needs are intense. 
There are some positive signs. Hos-
pitalizations and cases are starting to 
go down even though the death toll re-
mains high, but this challenge—we are 
not done with it. We are not near done 
with it, and that is why we have to go 
big, in my view, and that is why we 
have to do it with a sense of urgency. 
I want to conclude and just say that 
the budget reconciliation tool that was 
part of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974 is about doing big things with a 
sense of urgency. I am getting asked 
sometimes 
by 
press, 
as 
I 
wander 
around: Should you use reconciliation, 
or should you try to be bipartisan? 
I said: Hold on a second. Reconcili-
ation isn’t partisan. Reconciliation was 
a part of the Budget Control Act put in 
place 35 years ago, and budget rec-
onciliation has been used for some of 
the most bipartisan, positive achieve-
ments of Congressmen in recent dec-
ades. CHIP, the Children’s Health In-
surance Program, was done with rec-
onciliation. The earned income tax 
credit was done with reconciliation. 
Reconciliation is a tool. You can use 
it in a bipartisan way or in a partisan 
way. It has also been used in a partisan 
way. The effort to undo the Affordable 
Care Act was done by reconciliation 
with no support on the Democratic side 
of the aisle. The tax cut bill in 2017 was 
done via reconciliation with no support

on the Democratic side of the aisle. 
But choosing the path of reconciliation 
is not the opposite of bipartisanship. 
I so applaud President Biden and 
Vice President HARRIS for their earnest 
dialogue with our Republican col-
leagues, and I applaud my Republican 
colleagues for going to the White 
House and talking about what should 
be in this bill because as they share 
their priorities, they are going to shape 
this bill. 
Without having seen the bill—I know 
no one has—I can make a guarantee 
about this bill, and I am 100 percent 
sure I am right about this. When this 
bill hits the table and the negotiation 
is done and before we have a final pas-
sage vote on it and we analyze what is 
in the bill, we are going to see so many 
priorities in this bill that are not just 
Democratic priorities but that are Re-
publican priorities, too, things that 
were drawn from bills that Republicans 
introduced or that Republicans cospon-
sored with Democrats, things that were 
raised by Republican Senators in their 
dialogue with President Biden and with 
us. We are going to see a bill that 
meets the need of Americans who are 
suffering to do something big and to do 
something urgent and includes prior-
ities that were Republican Senators’ 
priorities, that are good for Republican 
voters, and that are good for all Ameri-
cans. 
So this is the second time I have 
done a floor speech where I have gone 
over the names of people whom I know 
who died of COVID. I don’t want to do 
a third speech. I don’t want to do a 
third speech. I think it is important to 
say people’s names so we remember 
them and we honor them. But the best 
way we can honor them is not through 
a floor speech; the best way we can 
honor them is acting in a compas-
sionate and prompt and significant way 
to ease the suffering of Americans dur-
ing this most unprecedented time. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want 
to say what a pleasure it is to see the 
Presiding Officer in the Chair and to 
know that, together, we have the op-
portunity, the great privilege, to rep-
resent the greatest State in America— 
the State of Colorado. And welcome to 
the Chamber. It is great to have you 
here. 
S. CON. RES. 5 
Mr. President, I want to talk a little 
bit about our State. The last time I 
was running for office, 2016, I remember 
I went to Rifle, CO, which the Pre-
siding Officer knows well, and I met 
there with a group of moms who were 
showing off the early childhood center 
that was there. It was newly created, 
and they were extremely happy to have 
it because before that early childhood 
center was there, in order to get 
childcare or early childhood education 
for their kids, these moms were having 
to drive through the canyon to Glen-
wood Springs—about 35 miles away, I 
guess, or so—and then go to work and 
then go back and pick their kid up and 
bring them back. So they were very, 
very happy that it was there. 
But at a certain point during the 
conversation, one of the moms looked 
at me, and she said: Michael, I work so 
I can have health insurance. And every 
single dollar I make goes to pay for 
this early childhood center so I can 
work—that triangle that she is trapped 
in because of the compression of wages 
in this country that is a story that mil-
lions of American families can tell 
about an economy that, for 50 years, 
has worked really well for the people at 
the very top but not for anybody else. 
Ninety percent of the American peo-
ple, basically, for 50 years, have not 
seen a pay increase in this country in 
real terms. That is terrible for them, 
obviously, because they can’t afford 
health care, housing, higher education, 
or early childhood education. They feel 
like they can’t live a middle-class life 
or, if their kids are living in poverty, 
they can’t get their kids out of pov-
erty. 
It is a danger to our democracy be-
cause democracies do not do well when 
prosperity is not shared and when you 
have one group of people at the very 
top who are doing extremely well and 
everybody else is struggling to get by, 
everybody else is struggling to get into 
the middle class or stay in the middle 
class or lift their kids out of poverty. 
That is where we have been as a coun-
try for a long time. 
We have some of the lowest mobility 
rates of any industrialized economy in 
the world, and it is taking its toll. It is 
taking its toll on the American dream, 
and that is before COVID. COVID has 
made matters much, much worse for 
families in our State—for families in 
urban parts of the State and rural 
parts of the State. 
Even before COVID hit, when people 
would ask me—I used to be the super-
intendent 
of 
the 
Denver 
Public 
Schools—people would say: What has 
changed in education since you were 
superintendent until now, what I would 
tell people is mental health, mental 
health, mental health. That is what 
teachers talk about in the meetings 
that I have with them—the mental 
health of their students, the mental 
health of their families, and their own 
mental health. It comes up in every 
single conversation before class size, 
before how pitifully we pay teachers in 
this country. We have to confront that 
as a country now, too, on top of every-
thing else. 
And 
the 
economic 
inequality 
is 
greater. The folks who have been on 
the frontlines during this pandemic 
have had the toughest time economi-
cally of everybody. That is why I am so 
glad that the administration has come 
with the package that they have to 
this floor, $1.9 trillion—$1 trillion of 
which is direct aid to families and an-
other big piece of which is to support 
the public health infrastructure in this 
country so that we can actually vac-
cinate people in a timely way, so we 
can test people in a timely way, so we 
can distribute PPE. 
It has been shocking to see how poor 
the response has been from the United 
States, a developed country unable to 
contend effectively with this pandemic, 
and we have lost almost half a million 
Americans as a result. 
So that investment in our public 
health infrastructure—in effect, the 
health force, like the one that KIRSTEN 
GILLIBRAND
and I have proposed—is 
something we desperately need if we 
are going to reopen this economy 
quickly and if we are going to reopen 
schools and keep them open. 
There is one other piece of this I 
wanted to mention this morning on the 
floor, and that is the provision in this 
bill that is based on the work that I 
have done for many, many years with 
Senator SHERROD
BROWN
from Ohio. 
One bill is Bennet-Brown, and the 
other one is Brown-Bennet. I love both 
of them the same, even though the 
order is different. 
But the President has decided to in-
clude these bills in his package. It is a 
dramatic increase to the child tax 
credit, a substantial increase to what 
is called the childless earned-income 
tax credit, so we will stop taxing work-
ing people into poverty, which is what 
we are doing in this country today. 
With the passage of the American 
Family Act, this child tax credit alone, 
we will cut childhood poverty in the 
United States of America by almost 50 
percent. We will cut childhood poverty 
for Latino kids by 60 percent, for Black 
kids by more than 50 percent, for kids 
living in Tribes by more than 60 per-
cent without adding one bureaucrat to 
the Federal Government, without cre-
ating one more program. Just by tak-
ing the tax credit from $2,000 to $3,000, 
$3,600 for kids under the age of 6, by 
making it fully refundable, which 
means that the poorest people in Amer-
ica who have been left out of this tax 
credit—23 or 25 million children—now 
will have the benefit of the tax credit 
for the first time, we will cut childhood 
poverty in this country by almost 50 
percent. I can’t think of anything that 
we could do that would better recog-
nize the structural nature of the chal-
lenges that the American people are 
facing in this economy before COVID 
but, certainly, in the wake of COVID. 
I hope the proposal will be able to at-
tract bipartisan support in this Cham-
ber, and that once we have done it, 
that we will make it permanent, we 
will make it last, and that we will 
imagine that we could live in a country 
in the United States of America that 
actually has eradicated childhood pov-
erty because it is no American’s choice

to be born poor. It is no child’s choice 
to be born poor. 
There are many things we can do to 
improve economic mobility in this 
country, and I think that this new ad-
ministration is going to create the be-
ginning of an era that is going to lead 
us to a place that, when the economy 
grows, it grows for everybody—not just 
for people at the very top—and that 
families 
can 
move 
themselves 
up 
through hard work, save something for 
retirement, and leave something for 
the next generation. 
That is all anybody in this country 
has ever really wanted, and that hasn’t 
been true for most Americans for a 
very long time. This is the beginning of 
change in that, and that is why this 
bill has my enthusiastic support. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ENERGY POLICY 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
rise to discuss the importance of the 
American energy sector and my con-
cern about President Biden’s Executive 
orders regarding domestic energy pol-
icy. 
In the first hours of the Biden admin-
istration, the President signed an Ex-
ecutive order revoking the Presidential 
permit of the Keystone XL Pipeline, a 
project projected to add 11,000 Amer-
ican jobs this year and pump $1.6 bil-
lion in wages into our economy. The 
new administration’s actions ceased 
construction work, nullified contracts 
issued last October to hire an esti-
mated 7,000 union construction work-
ers, and disappointed our Canadian 
ally. 
It is deeply concerning that our na-
tional energy policy should take such a 
dramatic turn away from pro-jobs and 
pro-American 
energy 
independence. 
Americans’ unemployment rate is al-
ready in a precarious situation due to 
the ongoing global pandemic, and I fail 
to see how destroying more jobs unifies 
our Nation. 
Mississippians and Americans in the 
energy industry have worked tirelessly 
for our Nation, and in 2019 America be-
came energy independent for the first 
time in 60 years. It is thanks to our en-
ergy workers that we are no longer 
forced to rely on foreign powers who do 
not wish America well. 
Terminating the Keystone XL Pipe-
line was just the start of what we now 
recognize to be a concerted effort to 
bring down fossil fuel resources in our 
Nation. The administration’s subse-
quent ban on new oil and gas leases on 
Federal lands will result in an esti-
mated $33.5 billion in lost GDP across 
Western States in President Biden’s 
first term and risk over $8.8 billion an-
nually in conservation funding. 
Oil and natural gas from Federal 
lands accounted for 6.4 percent and 9.2 
percent, respectively, of the Nation’s 
total production. Jobs and economic 
opportunity 
are 
being 
carelessly 
stripped away. 
And while my State may not be 
burned by the Federal leasing ban as 
badly as Wyoming, New Mexico, and 
other Western States, Mississippi will 
certainly feel the heat from this. Mis-
sissippi has a significant energy infra-
structure which provides thousands of 
jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars 
in economic output. 
The Gulf of Mexico is one of the Na-
tion’s most important regions for en-
ergy resources and accounts for a large 
portion of our crude oil and Federal 
offshore natural gas production. 
My State is home to the 1,443-mega-
watt Grand Gulf nuclear power station 
in Port Gibson, MS, which is the larg-
est reactor in terms of generating ca-
pacity in the United States. We host a 
large petroleum refinery, a natural gas 
processing plant, and a liquefied nat-
ural gas terminal located along the 
State’s Gulf of Mexico coastline. 
Additionally, the Red Hills surface 
coal mine provides lignite coal to the 
Red Hills Power Plant, creating jobs 
and generation capacity in North Mis-
sissippi. 
Along 
with 
these 
great 
sources, Mississippi has growing in-
vestments in natural gas and in solar 
power. 
Destructive policies that make fuel 
sources more difficult to obtain could 
greatly harm economic growth and 
raise the cost of energy prices, which 
will ultimately harm low-income fami-
lies and many small businesses, not 
just in Mississippi but across the entire 
Nation. 
My concerns are not based on any ob-
jections to green or renewable energy 
sources. I believe the American people 
want balanced national energy policies 
that promote growth and price sta-
bility. However, the early actions of 
the Biden administration are cause for 
concern and not a source of unity. 
They signal a troubling willingness to 
sacrifice strategic industries that are 
important to our economy and for the 
jobs that they provide. 
This body should take into consider-
ation important legislation such as the 
POWER Act and the Conservation 
Funding Protection Act, which would 
allow Congress to enact responsible en-
ergy policies and move away from poli-
cies landed in executive edits. 
During a time when America’s en-
ergy businesses are seeking recovery 
from this global pandemic, losing pre-
cious jobs that keep the lights on for 
the constituents and feed their families 
cannot and should not be the route this 
administration is taking. 
TRIBUTE TO SARAH THOMAS 
Mr. President, now on a more posi-
tive note, I would like to speak on a 
separate and special matter. 
As Americans and people around the 
world settle in front of their tele-
visions this Sunday to watch the 55th 
annual Super Bowl, they will be tuning 
in to a historic event. I am not speak-
ing about the impact of the COVID–19 
pandemic on the game or Tom Brady’s 
record Super Bowl appearances. In-
stead, I am focused on the history that 
will be made by an exceptional woman 
from Mississippi, my good friend Sarah 
Thomas. 
Sarah 
Thomas, 
a 
native 
of 
Pascagoula, MS, will go down in sports 
history on Sunday as the first woman 
to officiate the Super Bowl. 
Sarah has always had a passion for 
athletics. She made a name for herself 
in high school sports. She became an 
Academic All-American in basketball 
at the University of Mobile, where she 
amassed a career record of 779 points, 
441 
rebounds, 
108 
assists, 
and 
192 
steals—accomplishments 
that 
illus-
trate her determination to perform at 
the highest levels. 
While the news of a female officiant 
for the Super Bowl is a historic first, 
Sarah is no stranger to making his-
tory. Following college, Sarah’s atten-
tion shifted to football—namely, offici-
ating games. She quickly earned a rep-
utation as an elite referee while offici-
ating high school games. 
Sarah became the first woman to of-
ficiate a Division 1A high school game 
in Mississippi. Sarah continued to do 
so well in her craft that it caught the 
attention of renowned NFL official 
Gerry Austin, who invited her to an of-
ficials’ camp. Here again, Sarah’s tal-
ents proved impressive, and she soon 
became the first woman to officiate a 
college football game and the first 
woman to officiate a college bowl 
game. 
The NFL hired Sarah as its first fe-
male official in 2015, and in 2019 she be-
came the first woman to officiate an 
NFL playoff game. 
To me and many others, Sarah’s se-
lection to officiate at Super Bowl LV is 
just a natural progression for a tal-
ented professional. I can assure you, 
anyone who knows Sarah as I do will 
not be surprised by her successful ca-
reer. 
Sarah—a mother, a career woman— 
has all the qualities I imagine the NFL 
wants in a good official: smart, con-
fident, decisive, reliable, and com-
mitted. 
My State of Mississippi is extremely 
proud of Sarah Thomas, and we look 
forward to watching her latest history- 
making appearance at the Super Bowl. 
And to Sarah’s children—these pre-
cious children: Bridley, Brady, and Bai-
ley—congratulations to you on this 
historic achievement, and you can be 
so proud of your mother. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate is engaged in what I 
personally 
believe 
to 
be 
a 
dis-
appointing exercise of, really, partisan 
political power at the expense of Amer-
ican taxpayers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S287 
February 3, 2021 
When it became clear that the Senate 
was going to be split 50–50—by the way, 
it doesn’t get closer than that—there 
was a moment of hope, I think, on both 
sides that this would be the oppor-
tunity that we would all have to really 
begin to seek ways to find how we 
could work together and not have any 
50–50 votes and not keep the Vice Presi-
dent busy in breaking ties on votes. So 
far, that hope appears to be a little bit 
short-lived. 
We are supposedly voting to pass a 
budget right now that expresses the 
priorities of the Congress on how lim-
ited tax dollars should be allocated. 
Now, you don’t have to be a genius to 
figure out that passing a budget—Octo-
ber, November, December—4 months 
into the calendar of the budget year 
probably isn’t, technically, just to de-
termine how you are going to allocate 
limited tax dollars. Frankly, there 
seems to be very little discussion in 
this budget about limited tax dollars. 
What we are really doing here is pass-
ing a budget that allows us to set up 
what, I think, is an ill-advised, par-
tisan moment, where one side believes 
it can do whatever it wants to without 
the other side. 
President Biden, when campaigning, 
said over and over again that he want-
ed to work with Republicans. I actually 
believe that is true. In his inaugural 
address, he said: ‘‘We have never ever, 
ever, ever failed in America when we’ve 
acted together.’’ Now, the inaugural 
address was only a few days ago. Here 
we are, 2 weeks later, and the Presi-
dent and my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have decided to go for-
ward, and the only way to go forward is 
to go forward their way. If that hap-
pens to be the way forward, it is going 
to be a long 4 years, and for the major-
ity, it might be a pretty quick 2 years 
because I don’t think that this is the 
message that people sent on election 
day—that they wanted one side to be 
able to do whatever it wanted to do. We 
have the narrowest House majority in 
about 150 years, and the Senate major-
ity—again, I will say—couldn’t be clos-
er than it is. 
We haven’t finished taking down the 
platform from the inauguration, and 
our colleagues are already forcing a 
one-sided endgame. Now, I would sug-
gest that the endgame in this case real-
ly just sets the stage for the rest of the 
time we are going to be trying to work 
together, and I think we will look back 
and find out it didn’t set the stage in a 
helpful way. 
The plan is to muscle through a real-
ly partisan $1.9 trillion package that 
claims to be about COVID relief but 
covers really a number of totally unre-
lated things. 
People have talked a lot about the 
fact that the minimum wage is there 
and whether it would meet the stand-
ard of reconciliation. 
We haven’t talked very much about 
the fact that the education money in 
the proposal that we are looking at for 
reconciliation doesn’t include private 
schools, even private parochial schools. 
It doesn’t include the schools that 
more than any other have done their 
best to stay open during the pandemic. 
It really breaks a pattern of recent 
years for all schools and post-World 
War II for higher education to where 
public schools was not the defining 
thing. The defining thing was, if you 
could qualify for government assist-
ance, you were able to take it to any 
accredited institution that you wanted 
to. 
Clean energy is in the COVID relief 
package. COVID relief is different from 
clean energy. It is certainly a debate 
worth having, but let’s not suggest 
that it is COVID relief when it is not. 
If one-half of the Senate is deter-
mined to impose its will on the other 
half without even working to find a 
real path forward, I think that is an 
unfortunate sign. 
Democrats have said there is an ur-
gent need for this COVID relief—so ur-
gent we can’t wait to have a real de-
bate. You know, we just passed $900 bil-
lion in relief. Now we are beginning to 
talk about such big numbers here that 
suddenly $900 billion is sort of passed 
away as, well, that is not nearly 
enough. But the truth is, the $900 bil-
lion bill was just signed into law De-
cember 27. That was 5 weeks ago—$900 
billion. Most of that money remains 
unspent, and suddenly we want to 
spend another $1.9 trillion. That is an 
aggressive pace even by the standards 
of some of my friends in the other half 
of this Chamber or the other half of 
Congress. 
It really in so many ways is simply 
too soon to really know exactly what 
we need next. We haven’t taken the 
time yet to get the other money out of 
the door. We haven’t taken the time to 
see how it is going and whether the 
policies we planned are the policies 
that really work. We haven’t taken the 
time to decide what else we might need 
to do. 
But here is what we have done al-
ready: We have provided $8.75 billion to 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention for vaccine distribution. So 
far, they have released $3 billion of 
that money. So we are rushing with 
billions more when 5.75 of that 8.75 
amount of money for vaccine distribu-
tion hasn’t been released yet. With 
nearly $6 billion left in that fund, how 
do we know exactly how it is working 
or exactly how much we need? We seem 
to be sure that what we have isn’t 
enough. I am not sure we even know 
that yet. But I have been an advocate 
in every one of the bills we have done 
for money for distribution of the vac-
cine, and I would love to see how the 
money that is out there works. 
We need to be thinking about what to 
do next, but there was a time when de-
bate was part of the Senate. Debate 
was very much part of the Senate when 
President Biden served in it. It should 
be part of the Senate now. 
Frankly, if we debated and figured 
out a bipartisan plan, we would get 
that done quicker than reconciliation. 
It is going to be several weeks before 
we can have the vote that we could 
have had to provide part of this money 
right now. A significant amount of this 
money is agreed to, particularly the 
amount that does relate to vaccine 
purchase and vaccine distribution. The 
parts that relate to testing, the parts 
that relate to getting kids back to 
school—that could all be available in a 
couple of weeks. But it won’t be a cou-
ple of weeks when we go through this 
process of reconciliation that I think 
my friends on the other side will find 
out is harder to do than they thought 
and substantially harder to do in a 50– 
50 Senate than it would be anywhere 
else. 
You know, in December, we provided 
$82 billion for schools and for edu-
cation. Elementary schools that were 
supposed to get almost $70 billion of 
that money to reopen haven’t re-
opened. Many of them haven’t had a 
chance to spend the money. In fact, 
many of the K–12 schools haven’t even 
spent all the money they got in April. 
So money from April not yet being 
spent, and we are rushing to decide 
how much more money they need right 
now in these last few weeks of the 
school year. 
Last week, Dr. Fauci said in an inter-
view that it was the goal of President 
Biden to get K–8 students back to 
school in the next 100 days, but at an-
other event that same day, he said— 
maybe as truthfully as you could pos-
sibly be—it might not work out that 
way. We need to be really committed 
to getting kids back to school. 
Now, there are more than a million 
people who have lost their jobs in edu-
cation at the State and local level 
since the pandemic started. That is 
often given as the reason we need more 
State and local money. But many of 
that million-person number were the 
busdrivers, the cafeteria workers, the 
coaches, the support staff who, frank-
ly—if you are not going to school, most 
districts have decided they shouldn’t 
be paying that staff who is not part of 
what the school is doing right now. 
Those losses are not about loss of rev-
enue; they are really about the loss of 
in-person school. 
You know, I have served as the chair-

challenges. I have hope the administra-
tion understands that. I believe my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
understand that. But we need to be 
sure that we know what we are doing 
before we commit another $1.9 trillion, 
as if that money is really—I am hear-
ing occasionally—not nearly enough. 
Two trillion more dollars after five bi-
partisan bills that produced real re-
sults, just kind of out of hand not near-
ly enough? 
Now, that is easier to say because 
virtually nobody in this Chamber or in 
the country, including me, really has a 
concept of how much money $1.9 tril-
lion is. So it is easy to say ‘‘Well, it 
should be 2.9 or 3.9’’ or ‘‘Whatever it is, 
it is not enough’’ because we really, I 
don’t think, have a sense of how much 
it is. 
We have had real success in devel-
oping vaccines. We need to have more 
success in getting out those vaccines. 
I have not seen the administration or 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle make the case yet as to why we 
need to spend the amount of money 
they are talking about spending. I have 
not seen anyone make the case of why 
it is good to start off this administra-
tion and this term of Congress in the 
most partisan, one-sided way possible 
before we have really had a chance to 
talk this out. 
There are a lot of things here we 
agree on. There are a lot of things here 
that could be improved around the 
margins, but you have to have the will-
ingness to talk about that before it 
goes forward. 
I was glad to see the White House ac-
cepted the offer of 10 of our Republican 
colleagues to at least meet and talk 
about some bipartisan issues, but the 
unwillingness of the Democratic leader 
here to slow down this process made it 
clear that, really, there may not be 
that much interest in really trying to 
find a solution, but at least there was 
some interest in talking about trying 
to work together. 
Bipartisanship is not something you 
do just for show. Compromise is not 
‘‘my way or the highway.’’ Unity is not 
telling everyone else that the only op-
tion is to accept your side of the argu-
ment. 
I hope my colleagues think better of 
this bipartisan exercise, come to the 
table, and explain what we really need 
and why we need it. If they don’t, I 
hope we can still figure out how to re-
cover and move forward in the only 
way a 50–50 Senate can move forward, 
and that is working every day to find 
things that more than 50 Members— 
and I would hope substantially more 
than 50 Members—of the U.S. Senate 
agree on and send those to the Presi-
dent and get our work done. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Iowa. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, on 
January 20, I joined my colleagues on 
the front steps of the Capitol for the 
inauguration of our 46th President, Joe 
Biden. At a time when divisions run 
deep within our country, I thought 
President Biden’s call for unity, where 
he pledged to be a President for all 
Americans, struck just the right tone. 
As my Democratic colleagues in this 
body can attest to, I am always willing 
to work with anyone—Republicans, 
Democrats and Independents—on issues 
that will improve the lives of my fel-
low Iowans and all Americans. Sadly, 
the actions we have seen in the first 
few days of this administration do not 
seem to honor the promise President 
Biden made to Americans throughout 
his campaign and again on Inaugura-
tion Day. 
In just 2 weeks, the President has al-
ready signed over 25 Executive orders, 
that is a significantly more amount 
than any President in recent history in 
a short amount of time. Let’s be clear, 
folks. He is not just breaking norms, he 
is obliterating them. Even the New 
York Times editorial board called on 
him to ‘‘Ease up on the Executive Ac-
tions.’’ And they are not wrong, folks. 
That is something that I don’t say very 
often. 
Now, I fully understand that the 
power of Executive order is often un-
popular when your party does not con-
trol the White House, but when you set 
out to be a ‘‘unifier-in-chief,’’ which is 
something we hoped President Biden 
would be, one would hope that the ac-
tions you take would unify or at least 
be a little more mainstream. 
The reality is, that has just not been 
the case. What the new President has 
done in just 2 weeks on the job is show 
us his true colors and his desire to ap-
pease the more radical wing of his 
party. It is disheartening for someone 
who believes that the way we should be 
working together is a bipartisan path. 
We have already seen disastrous deci-
sions harmful to American businesses 
and workers—decisions that resemble 
the likes of the radical Green New 
Deal. 
Keeping our air and water clean and 
protecting our environment for genera-
tions to come are shared concerns of 
every Iowan and all Americans. But on 
day one, as many predicted he would do 
at some point during his tenure, Presi-
dent Biden issued a harsh punishment 
for American businesses by rejoining 
the Paris climate agreement. This 
agreement saddles hard-working folks 
with overburdensome government reg-
ulations, all while letting one of the 
world’s biggest polluters, Communist 
China, completely off the hook. Instead 
of inhibiting economic growth, we 
should be focused on reducing our 
emissions and meeting our energy 
needs through market-driven, innova-
tive solutions. 
Iowa actually leads the way in cre-
ating renewable energy sources, from 
wind and solar to biodiesel and eth-
anol, but we haven’t done it through 
heavyhanded government mandates. 
The President has also raised con-
cerns for folks in my home State of 
Iowa who work hard to grow and 
produce clean ethanol and biodiesel 
with 
his 
recent 
action 
to 
begin 
transitioning Federal Government ve-
hicles to electric vehicles. 
Ethanol and biodiesel are actually 
cleaner choices of fuel for folks at the 
pump. A recent study found that green-
house gas emissions from corn ethanol 
are 46 percent lower than gasoline. At 
the same time, renewable fuels provide 
for the livelihoods of folks across the 
heartland. 
It is critical we continue to invest in 
our biofuel industry, not move away 
from it. That is why I urge President 
Biden not to give in to the misguided 
political demands of the left. Change 
course and, instead, promote the adop-
tion of higher biofuel blends and invest 
in expanding biofuel infrastructure. 
On the same day he got us back into 
the Paris climate accord, President 
Biden unilaterally canceled the Key-
stone XL Pipeline, destroying thou-
sands of jobs during a pandemic when 
millions of hard-working Americans 
are already struggling to make ends 
meet. Even Canada’s Prime Minister, 
one of our top allies and closest trade 
partners, expressed his disappointment 
in the decision. 
Unfortunately, the Green New Deal 
lite is not the only policy of the liberal 
left the Biden administration has al-
ready chosen to implement. As many 
Iowans know, I have long been working 
to pass Sarah’s Law, my bill in honor 
of Sarah Root, a 21-year-old Iowan who 
was tragically struck and killed by 
Edwin Mejia, who entered the country 
illegally and was driving drunk—three 
times the legal limit. 
While Mejia was initially detained by 
local law enforcement and faced State 
charges of motor vehicle homicide, a 
loophole in immigration policy under 
the Obama-Biden administration al-
lowed him to post bond, disappear, and 
escape justice. 
Sarah’s Law would close that loop-
hole and require U.S. Customs and Im-
migration Enforcement to take cus-
tody of an illegal immigrant who is 
charged with a crime resulting in the 
death or serious bodily injury of an-
other person. It is common sense, 
folks, and it would prevent tragedies 
like what happened to the Root family 
from ever happening again. 
The Trump administration was suc-
cessful in implementing parts of this 
important legislation. But as many ex-
pected, the Biden administration is al-
ready working to roll back immigra-
tion enforcement. That is why, last 
week, I reintroduced Sarah’s Law with 
the support of 19 of my colleagues— 
more than ever before—and I am going 
to keep fighting to get this bill across 
the finish line. 
If the November elections taught us 
anything, it is that the American peo-
ple want us to work together. They 
elected a 50–50 Senate and a slim ma-
jority in the House of Representatives. 
So, Mr. President, it is time the 
Biden administration follows its own 
advice.

S289 
February 3, 2021 
I am an eternal optimist, and I be-
lieve we can come together and truly 
deliver for all Americans, but I need 
my colleagues across the aisle and our 
new President to do the same so that 
his calls for unity don’t fall on deaf 
ears. 
MARCH FOR LIFE AND ABORTION 
Madam President, on another topic, 
we did have the March for Life this 
past week. So I want to begin today by 
recognizing the grassroots advocates of 
our pro-life movement. 
Last Friday, thousands of Americans 
and many Iowans joined in this year’s 
virtual March for Life. These folks are 
the ones who actively serve our vulner-
able women and families who need sup-
port in order to choose life. These hard- 
working Americans are the ones who 
are on the ground, changing hearts and 
minds all year long. 
Even though things looked a lot of 
different for this year’s event, I have 
no doubt that our grassroots pro-life 
movement will continue to grow in 
communities all across the country, 
thanks to these inspiring folks who un-
derstand that protecting life is not just 
a political issue for debate. 
In DC, lawmakers and executive 
branch bureaucrats get easily trapped 
into looking at abortion as just an-
other issue. But that mindset, even 
from the pro-life perspective, is a dehu-
manized approach. I challenge my 
friends and colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to instead approach the sanc-
tity of human life as more than just a 
policy issue. 
Surely, the challenges of 2020 re-
minded us how very precious life is, 
taking to heart that we must cherish 
life—all life at all stages. If we devalue 
life in the womb, then we are only set-
ting the groundwork for diminishing 
human worth and value at every other 
stage of life. 
This mindset is why I approach the 
duty to protect life with steadfast de-
termination. And it is why I know pre-
serving life is a cause that can and 
should bring us together. 
President Biden and his administra-
tion have clearly stated their goal is to 
unify our country, but the recent pol-
icy changes and Executive actions sur-
rounding the abortion issue have cer-
tainly signaled a different message to 
many Americans. 
There was a time when the most 
basic policy stance was that taxpayer 
dollars should not support the abortion 
industry. It was a bipartisan, non-
controversial stance—one that many of 
my Democratic colleagues used to 
hold. But the abortion lobby has moved 
the goalpost so far down the field by 
making commonsense safety regula-
tions on abortion absolutely untouch-
able; whereas, my pro-life colleagues 
and I have always been willing to meet 
in the middle. Think about it. 
I believe life begins long before 5 
months in the womb, but we know 
many colleagues feel differently. So 
Senator 
GRAHAM
has 
repeatedly 
brought the Pain-Capable Unborn Child 
Protection Act forward each Congress 
in the hopes that protecting our most 
vulnerable from painful death at the 5- 
month mark of pregnancy would be a 
unifying and humanitarian cause. 
Sadly, that has not been the case. We 
had an estimated 143 babies who died 
between 2003 and 2014 after surviving 
abortion attempts. This shows the cur-
rent 
law 
obviously 
needs 
to 
be 
strengthened there, which is why Sen-
ator SASSE brought forward the Born 
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection 
Act—but, no, even that bar was too 
high. 
Last year, Senator COTTON and I first 
introduced a bill that would ensure we 
have complete and accurate abortion- 
related 
data 
from 
every 
State. 
Wouldn’t a full picture of the abortion 
landscape in our country be knowledge 
that any lawmaker would want in 
order to make informed and respon-
sible decisions? And when it comes to 
ensuring women are treated with dig-
nity and respect as patients, I will be 
introducing the Informed Consent Act 
to solidify this commonsense cause. 
My colleagues may recall a whistle-
blower report from September 2020, 
claiming 
that 
hysterectomies 
and 
other 
sterilization 
procedures 
were 
being performed on immigrant women 
held at the Irwin County Detention 
Center in Georgia without their con-
sent. 
As it turns out, a sterilization or 
abortion procedure that occurs without 
informed consent from the patient is 
not already established as a crime in 
our Federal Code. My House colleague, 
Congressman CHRIS SMITH, and I are in-
troducing this legislation to strength-
en the law here. Surely, this is another 
baseline that we can find common 
ground on. I welcome my pro-choice 
colleagues to join us in this effort and 
take a step toward unity. 
I believe once you focus the heart 
and mind to approach life as more than 
just a policy issue, you will find that 
preserving life promotes unity. 
If you really look at how our culture 
is shifting, life is winning. At the State 
level, nearly 60 life-affirming laws were 
enacted across the country in 2019. The 
vast majority of Americans agree that 
Federal tax dollars should not be used 
to support the abortion industry. 
So, folks, we do have common ground 
to stand on going into this new Con-
gress. Protecting life brings us to-
gether, so we must stand up for the 
most vulnerable. We will be a stronger 
nation for it. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, yesterday, I had the opportunity 
to speak with a group about the legis-
lative priorities for this upcoming Con-
gress. I know the Presiding Officer and 
I are two Members of the Senate who 
like talking to the people we represent 
and doing that as much as we possibly 
can. I always try to cover as much 
ground as I can when I am visiting 
with a group. 
But what has struck me recently, and 
this was true yesterday, is that the 
conversation really started to center 
around 
our 
national 
security—pro-
tecting this Nation—and people seem 
to have defending this country on their 
brain—standing up for America. 
Some of the things that come up are 
what they have noticed since Novem-
ber. You have individuals who are now 
a part of the new administration work-
ing hard to try to erase every trace of 
the Trump era, even the successes—leg-
islation, many times, that moved for-
ward and things that were done on a bi-
partisan basis. 
Part of the problem that people are 
beginning to have is that President 
Biden signed off on more day 1 Execu-
tive orders and actions than any Presi-
dent in recent memory. Indeed, I think 
you would have to go back to the time 
of Ronald Reagan and combine all of 
those day 1 Executive orders and ac-
tions to equal what President Biden 
has done. 
I have a tendency to say they kind of 
lost the ability to keep track of them 
because there are so many. They are 
numerous—every single day—and this 
has people very unsettled. They see 
this strategy, and they think this is 
oddly familiar. Their most powerful 
leaders are treating policymaking like 
it is some kind of graduate seminar— 
all about theories and not about con-
sequences and not about concrete out-
comes, at least not as far as Wash-
ington is concerned. 
The message flowing from the White 
House hasn’t helped ease their con-
cerns. You see, the administration has 
given the impression that when it 
comes to national security policy, they 
are going to exercise strategic patience 
when engaging with our adversaries. 
And I will tell you this: Tennesseeans 
back home might not know all the de-
tails of what is in store, but they know 
that the tone has changed, and they 
don’t like what they are hearing. 
When strategic patience failed to 
yield results during the President 
Obama 
administration, 
analysts 
dubbed this tactic as strategic pas-
sivity, and I believe that is a very apt 
description because at the heart of 
strategic patience is the belief that the 
status quo, while less than ideal, is bet-
ter than many possible consequences of 
taking an action. 
It is a dangerous posture, especially 
when applied to powerful adversaries 
like China that are positioning them-
selves for global dominance. In fact, 
our regional allies in Japan and the 
Philippines immediately expressed con-
cern at the idea that the United States 
of America would embrace such a tac-
tic. 
For the past few decades, they have 
had a front row seat for the rise of Chi-
nese influence. They watched as China 
grew from a struggling regional player 
into our most significant competitor in 
every domain. It is important to real-
ize that we allowed that evolution in

February 3, 2021 
the hopes that China’s transition into 
a developed nation would foster within 
its leaders a sense of global responsi-
bility. This approach failed, and now 
China is a major international player 
intent—intent—on global domination. 
I can tell you that officials in Beijing 
are not taking a passive approach in 
their effort to surpass us. Through 
their Belt and Road Initiative, the Chi-
nese Communist Party has bought or 
extorted control over the economies of 
some of the most strategically impor-
tant nations on the planet. Until re-
cently, their grasp on global supply 
chains flew well under the radar. 
But we can no longer ignore the neg-
ative consequences of Beijing’s control 
over access to active pharmaceutical 
ingredients and prescription drugs to 
medical 
devices, 
natural 
resources, 
telecommunications equipment, and, 
even more, defense materials. Where 
they couldn’t buy influence, the Chi-
nese Communist Party seized it. If 
they could not buy it, they seized it. 
They took it outright by reducing 
themselves to intellectual property 
theft and money laundering schemes 
and, more subtly, by installing Confu-
cius Institutes in American classrooms 
and universities and putting Chinese 
Communist Party spies on those uni-
versity campuses in research positions. 
Beijing is just as brash militarily. 
Chinese aggression and violence in the 
Indo-Pacific threatens regional sta-
bility in defiance of basic global norms, 
rulings offered by international bodies, 
and showings of strength from Western 
military players. The Chinese Com-
munist Party has leveraged all of this 
against the most powerful nations in 
the Western world, and their bellig-
erence has paid off. 
Even when, time and again, news 
breaks of some human rights horror in 
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang, Inner 
Mongolia, or Tibet, global leaders hit 
the brakes on their rebuke of human 
rights violations because it could draw 
economic consequences. 
The term ‘‘strategic patience’’ had 
been used by now-Secretary Austin 
prior to his confirmation. We discussed 
that, both privately and during his re-
cent confirmation hearing, and I am 
confident he knows how important it is 
to check Chinese aggression now—right 
now—before it is too late. 
However, the general language used 
by the Biden administration officials 
in press conferences and other settings 
reflects former President Obama’s lib-
eral theories rather than concrete poli-
cies. Now, to be clear, I think I can 
speak for everyone here when I say 
that we are willing to work with the 
administration on this, but the threat 
from China isn’t merely theoretical, 
and I hope I have made it clear that we 
here in the Senate aren’t prepared to 
treat it like it is. 
For 
decades, 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party officials have been successful in 
using China’s modernized economy to 
distract from the threat their aggres-
sive tactics pose to the international 
order. The fact is, the concept of stra-
tegic patience simply does not apply to 
Beijing. 
The CCP’s influence grows by the day 
and far too quickly to be contained by 
a cautious wait-and-see attitude. We 
did wait. We tried. It did not work. We 
know it did not work. We see the en-
tanglements and the risk of simply 
poking at those knots and hoping they 
will resolve themselves. Instead, we 
need to take a great power competi-
tion-tailored approach right up to the 
CCP’s front door and craft policy and 
budget priorities to match. 
To those who would still embrace the 
kind of restraint the White House 
seems to have endorsed, I would ask: 
What about the status quo looks sus-
tainable to you when you are dealing 
with the aggressiveness of the Chinese 
Communist Party? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 2 
weeks ago, I heard these words: 
History, faith, and reason show the way, 
the way of unity. We can see each other not 
as adversaries but as neighbors. We can treat 
each other with dignity and respect. We can 
join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the 
temperature. For without unity, there is no 
peace, only bitterness and fury. 
President Biden’s inaugural address 
had some pretty glowing terms. I am 
grateful to hear statements about 
unity. The challenge now is to actually 
live that out and see that actually 
done, because while those words are 
beautiful, over the past 2 weeks, there 
have 
been 
almost 
two 
dozen 
hyperpartisan Executive orders that 
have come out of the White House, and 
there doesn’t seem to be a push toward 
actual bipartisan unity here on this 
floor. 
In fact, in the first 10 days of the 
Biden administration, he has signed 
more Executive orders than the last 
four Presidents combined in their first 
10 days. President Clinton signed 2; 
President Bush signed 2; Donald Trump 
signed 7; President Obama signed 9; and 
Joe Biden, in the first 10 days, signed 
22 Executive orders—22. And some of 
those Executive orders seem to be 
purely spiteful, just to say: President 
Trump put this in, so it must be bad. 
Let me give you an example. The 
Trump 
administration 
required, 
through an Executive order, every 
Agency to compile all their guidance 
documents into one place so that small 
business owners and people who work 
in small businesses could find the Fed-
eral requirements from each Agency in 
one spot. They didn’t have to hunt all 
over the place to be able to find their 
Federal 
requirements. 
Now, 
that 
doesn’t seem like a partisan statement. 
That just seems like good government. 
But in the first 10 days of President 
Biden’s term, he got rid of that good 
guidance piece and said: No, Federal 
agencies can go back to playing hide 
and seek with their rules again, and 
small business owners will just have to 
figure out where it is. There won’t be 
one place in each agency to find guid-
ance. 
Why would you do that, other than 
just, if Trump did it, it must be bad? 
Listen, we have to find ways to actu-
ally live unity and to be able to do 
what is best for the American people. 
We live in a constitutional system. We 
have more than 300 million people. We 
have great disagreements on policies, 
but we come together to work them 
out. 
During 2020, in a time of divided gov-
ernment, this body, the House of Rep-
resentatives, and the White House 
passed five different COVID relief bills, 
all with strong bipartisan majorities. 
We passed all 12 appropriation bills 
with strong bipartisan majorities. I 
didn’t agree with everything on every 
one of those bills, but we worked to-
gether to be able to resolve it. And 
now, suddenly, it has become a ‘‘we 
don’t want to talk across the aisle any-
more,’’ literally 2 weeks after saying: 
Do you know what we need as a coun-
try? Unity. 
Two weeks later it is: How do we 
cram through something on a straight 
partisan vote? How do we block out all 
Republican voices from the entire 
country and make sure their voices are 
not heard? 
Does that feel like unity, 2 weeks 
into a Presidency? 
Ten of my Republican colleagues sat 
down with President Biden. We appre-
ciate his time, and he gave 2 hours of 
his time to listen. 
He has proposed $1.9 trillion in addi-
tional spending the very first day on 
COVID—$1.9 trillion. This is only a few 
weeks after we just passed almost a 
trillion-dollar package dealing with 
COVID. Literally, two-thirds of that 
trillion-dollar package has not even 
gone out the door yet, has not even 
been spent, has not even been allo-
cated. 
There are billions and billions of dol-
lars still unallocated for vaccines, for 
testing, for schools—all kinds of dif-
ferent things that we allocated in De-
cember—and it is already like: That is 
not enough. We need more. 
Literally, the CDC and the NIH have 
billions of dollars unallocated right 
now from previous bills that have al-
ready been sent. And when my team 
contacted the White House team and 
said, ‘‘Hey, we see this big proposal; 
can you tell me what these dollars are 
allocated for?’’ their response was: It is 
an emergency. We need a big package. 
They literally couldn’t tell us what 
the money would be spent for. 
Now, I have to tell you, this is not 
just a partisan issue for me. I asked the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S291 
February 3, 2021 
exact same thing of the Trump admin-
istration. When they made a big pro-
posal, I went back to them with the 
exact same question: What is this 
money to be used for? They couldn’t 
answer it. So I continued to press for 
months until we got an answer, until 
we got a right amount. That seems like 
a reasonable thing for us to do, regard-
less of who is in the White House, to 
say: This is the American people’s 
money. And, in this case, none of it is 
actually money that is allocated. All of 
it is borrowed. 
So before we spend a dime of money 
that we borrow from China, we should 
probably know what it is actually for. 
In the $1.9 trillion package proposal, 
there is even a section in it that is a 
$50 billion fund to spend for needs, how-
ever the administration wanted to fill 
that blank in—$50 billion. No, thank 
you. We have a basic responsibility to 
be able to ask questions on this. 
If the reports are accurate, when 10 
Republican Senators sat down with the 
White House to talk about a different 
proposal to be more targeted toward 
the actual needs right now, if the re-
ports are correct—I wasn’t there at the 
time, but if the reports are correct— 
every time a proposal came up, some of 
the President’s team sitting against 
the wall facing the President would 
shake their head to signal the answer 
to President Biden: Say no to that one 
as well. 
We have to find a way to be able to 
actually work things out. Why is this 
so difficult when we did it five times 
with a divided government last year? 
And now the focus is that we can no 
longer talk to Republicans. Where did 
the unity go? 
Some of these Executive orders re-
quire a lot more attention and a lot 
more conversation instead of just im-
posing things on the American people 
because that makes a difficult situa-
tion worse. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden dismantled the title IX protec-
tions for women and imposed new gen-
der identity requirements. Now, I agree 
with President Biden, every person 
should be treated with dignity and re-
spect. But I also believe that extending 
respect and dignity means being honest 
about scientific and biological realities 
of sex and the differences between men 
and women. 
All people—all people—should be af-
forded equal opportunity, but that also 
includes women and girls. Title IX was 
put into place to make sure that we 
had equal opportunity for women and 
girls in all areas. And under the guise 
of ‘‘preventing discrimination,’’ sud-
denly now women and girls are being 
discriminated against. 
President Biden’s Executive order to 
‘‘prevent discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity’’ is now a mandate to force school 
districts to allow biological boys to 
compete against biological girls in 
high school sports. You might think: 
What is the big deal about that? Well, 
in Connecticut, two high school ath-
letes who were born male, but now 
identify as female, won 15 women’s 
championship titles that were once 
held by girls—in fact, 9 different girls. 
Those titles are gone from those girls. 
Female athletes are losing medals, po-
dium spots, and chances for scholar-
ships, or chances to play on a team 
with their peers. 
Every person should be respected in 
our Nation, but there is a reason that 
title IX was created. This should de-
mand more conversation in this body, 
not trying to impose it in an Executive 
order. Americans are not united in this 
issue. We are united that people should 
be respected and have every oppor-
tunity, but don’t run over one group to 
be able to provide special status to an-
other group. 
I was disappointed, but not surprised, 
when there was an Executive order 
that was released on the issue of abor-
tion—in fact, multiple Executive or-
ders—on the week of the 48th anniver-
sary of Roe v. Wade. 
For unity, President Biden gave the 
ironically 
titled 
‘‘Memorandum 
on 
Protecting Women’s Health At Home 
and Abroad’’—once again, message. It 
is a good message, but it falls short of 
a standard about unity. 
According to the most recent Marist 
poll, 77 percent of Americans oppose 
using taxpayer dollars to support abor-
tion in other countries. Yet under the 
guise of unity, we are now spending 
money overseas on promoting and pro-
viding abortion. At a time when we 
have record debts and deficits, the 
Biden administration made one of its 
first priorities in the very first week to 
take some of the dollars that we do 
have and spend it to promote and pro-
vide abortion overseas in other coun-
tries. That is our foreign aid now. 
As if funding abortion providers at 
home and abroad wasn’t enough, the 
memo also directs the United States to 
withdraw from the historic Geneva 
Consensus 
Declarations. 
Thirty-five 
nations have agreed to four basic pil-
lars. These are the four pillars that we 
just withdrew from: pillar No. 1, better 
health for women; pillar No. 2, the 
preservation of human life; pillar No. 3, 
strengthening 
of 
family 
as 
the 
foundational unit of society; and, pillar 
No. 4, protecting every nation’s na-
tional sovereignty in global politics. 
That was so controversial that the 
Biden administration withdrew from 
that with 35 other countries. 
Ironically enough, while President 
Biden pulled out of that treaty pro-
tecting women’s health, he actually in-
stalled us deeper into a treaty with 
Russia. In his first week in office, 
President Biden agreed to a straight 
extension for 5 years of the outdated 
New START Treaty with Russia. The 
treaty was supposed to manage the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons be-
tween the United States and Russia, 
the two big superpowers, but it was 
written so long ago and is so out of 
date that it completely leaves out 
other superpowers, like China. 
So while Russia has to mind an 
agreement, China continues to accel-
erate. The current status is that China 
will double its nuclear stockpile in the 
next decade, but they are not even in 
this treaty. 
In addition to that, multiple areas 
are not even addressed in this New 
Start Treaty. That is why there was 
such a push in the previous administra-
tion to renegotiate it, because the New 
Start Treaty doesn’t even include Rus-
sian weapons like ‘‘air-delivered bal-
listic missiles, nuclear powered under-
water drones, hypersonic glide vehi-
cles,’’ and ‘‘Nonstrategic nuclear weap-
ons.’’ They were not even included. So 
even under this agreement, Russia can 
accelerate in those areas and say they 
are still meeting the agreement. And 
President Biden just extended it for 5 
more years and said: We are not going 
to negotiate it for 5 more years. Let’s 
just keep going. 
The shift has moved from stopping 
nuclear proliferation to dealing with 
climate change. Why can’t we do both? 
Why can’t we pay attention to the en-
vironmental issues of our globe but 
also pay attention to the issue of nu-
clear proliferation? It is not like this is 
going away. It hasn’t. 
President Biden also took several 
issues on immigration, specifically bor-
der security. Right after the inaugura-
tion, speaking on unity, he puts out an 
Executive 
order 
with 
bizarre 
doublespeak in it that stated this: 
‘‘The United States is a country with 
borders and with laws that must be en-
forced.’’ But the order itself after that 
literally put a 100-day moratorium on 
all deportations. It is like: We need to 
enforce our laws. And then the first 
step of it was that for 100 days we are 
not going to actually enforce our laws. 
Now, this is not just some crazy piece 
here. The 100-day moratorium for de-
portations included individuals who are 
listed as criminal aliens. It also in-
cluded people who had what is called a 
final order of removal from a court. 
That means that they have gone 
through every appeal in our court sys-
tem here and a court has said: No, you 
do not qualify to be here legally. They 
have ordered them removed from the 
country. President Biden said no, we 
actually want them to be able to stay, 
even after a court order. 
There is this great myth that ICE is 
roaming through cities in America just 
rounding people up. The fact is, in 92 
percent of ICE enforcement and re-
moval operations, those individuals 
have a criminal conviction or a pend-
ing criminal charge—92 percent. But 
President Biden immediately put a 100- 
day moratorium on it and said: Those 
individuals don’t need to be deported. 
We will think about it for 100 days. 
Now, thankfully, a Federal court has 
already stepped in and stopped that. 
Their statement was that this morato-
rium has—this is the quote from the 
Federal 
court—‘‘no 
reasonable 
jus-
tification.’’ I agree. That is not enforc-
ing our laws. That is not engaging in 
bipartisan unity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S292 
February 3, 2021 
The vast majority of Americans want 
legal immigration. The vast majority 
of Americans also believe that if some-
one has committed a crime in our 
country and they are not legally in our 
country, they should be deported. But 
the message that is being sent out is 
that those individuals won’t. 
As odd as it may seem, on January 
26, President Biden instituted a travel 
ban from Brazil, the United Kingdom, 
Ireland, most of the EU, from South 
Africa, and said: Those folks can’t 
come because of COVID threat. But at 
the same time he said he wants to 
evaluate title 42, which may allow peo-
ple to come into the United States 
from Mexico, and do catch-and-release 
again here in the United States. So at 
the same time saying that business 
travelers from all over the world really 
don’t need to come because of COVID 
threat, they are also looking at our 
southern border and saying: Yeah, but 
people coming from South America, 
Central America, they may be OK to 
come into the country and then be re-
leased while there is still a hearing 
pending. 
May I remind this body, in the past 
year we have lost 21 people from the 
Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
along our southern border. Twenty-one 
agents and officers have died from 
COVID exposure while interacting with 
people coming from South America and 
Central America. 
Why in the world do you close down 
the borders to business travelers and 
then start talking about opening them 
up to people not legally crossing the 
border? This is not the America we are 
looking for. 
I had a lot of people in my State who 
were shocked, in the first days of the 
Biden administration, when he stopped 
the Keystone Pipeline and then he 
stopped all energy exploration on Fed-
eral lands. Those are jobs in my State. 
As President Biden likes to talk about, 
those are union jobs that are all over 
the country. 
Thousands of people lost their jobs 
on day one of the Biden administration 
with a unilateral declaration: We are 
not going to do energy exploration, and 
we are not going to complete this pipe-
line. 
What does that mean? That means to 
the Federal taxpayer, royalties are 
down because they are not gaining roy-
alties off of the use of that land, so the 
taxpayer loses. That means jobs are 
down all over the country, especially in 
the west. And that means prices will go 
up for the consumer. 
We are not running all on electricity 
right now. We are still running on oil 
and gas for the vast majority of our ve-
hicles. And while I am all for multiple, 
different types of energy, that is not 
what is happening right now. 
We should address this. We should 
work for unity. But right now, we are 
not even having dialogue. We are not 
even included in the conversation. If 
we are going to have unity, we have to 
talk about the hard issues and actually 
come to a decision on how we are going 
to resolve those. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
first I would like to associate myself 
with the remarks of the distinguished 
Senator from Oklahoma, who has such 
a good insight into the impact of the 
Executive orders of the Biden adminis-
tration on his State, very similar to 
my State. The concerns that he heard 
at home over the last 2 weeks are iden-
tical to the ones that I have heard in 
Wyoming the last 2 weekends. 
It is day 15 today of the Biden admin-
istration, and on day 1, President 
Biden—and we listened as he spoke— 
promised to usher in a new era of bi-
partisanship, he said, and healing. 
Well, within his inaugural address, he 
said the words: ‘‘With unity, we can do 
great things.’’ 
The Senator from Oklahoma and I 
agreed with the President and the 
words that he spoke on inaugural day, 
but here we are just 2 weeks later, and 
it seems to me it was all just talk. So 
far, we haven’t seen much bipartisan-
ship from the Biden administration. 
President Biden has already issued 
more than 45 Executive actions, and 
that is more Executive actions in the 
first 2 weeks than Presidents Trump, 
Obama, Bush, and Clinton in their be-
ginnings in office. 
It is interesting because, as President 
Biden was rolling out one Executive 
order after another, even the liberal 
New 
York 
Times, 
which 
endorsed 
President Biden, had this lead head-
line. And this was Thursday, January 
28, so this was a full week ago. It says: 
Ease up on Executive orders. The New 
York Times to President Biden: Ease 
up on Executive orders. When the New 
York Times has to call President Biden 
out on Executive overreach, you know 
that President Biden has abandoned 
the promises that he made during the 
campaign and that he made to us on in-
augural day. 
To just kind of go into the editorial 
and what they wrote, they said: ‘‘Ease 
Up on the Executive actions, Joe.’’ 
They said: ‘‘[T]his is no way to make 
law.’’ They said: ‘‘These directives . . . 
are a flawed substitute for legislation.’’ 
That is what we see the Biden admin-
istration adopting, a flawed substitute, 
as they say, for legislation. 
They go on to say that on the cam-
paign trail, President Biden touted his 
skills at making compromise. I saw 
that when I served with him in the 
Senate—before the Presiding Officer 
got here, but he and I served together 
in this body. I was on the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, which he 
chaired. He does have a history and a 
skill at finding compromise. 
The New York Times went on to say 
that President ‘‘Biden’s legacy will de-
pend on his ability to hammer out 
agreements with Congress.’’ That is 
why we have three branches of govern-
ment—the executive branch, the legis-
lative 
branch, 
and 
the 
judiciary 
branch; all of the branches of govern-
ment—and, as they say, the legacy will 
depend on his ability to hammer out 
agreements with Congress. 
The problem isn’t just how many Ex-
ecutive orders are being issued, as my 
friend and colleague from Oklahoma 
said; it is what is in them. 
President Biden has already launched 
a full-scale attack on American en-
ergy. To me, this is the whole Green 
New Deal dressed up as Executive or-
ders. In fact, a Congresswoman from 
Michigan who is part of the squad has 
been actually boasting about it. She 
said the principles and the values in 
the Green New Deal are in the Execu-
tive orders by President Biden. She 
went on to say that the Green New 
Deal pushed the President toward a 
much more aggressive approach. 
I think her statement is accurate. 
President Biden has already shut down 
the Keystone Pipeline. He drew a big 
target on the back of American energy, 
and then he pulled the trigger, killed 
the Keystone Pipeline. Hundreds of 
American workers have already re-
ceived pink slips. Thousands more will 
do so. And that will be soon. President 
Biden banned new oil and gas leases on 
Federal lands. Half of my State is Fed-
eral land, so we know how this works. 
If this President also keeps his promise 
to ban fracking, this could lead to a 
total of millions of Americans losing 
jobs over the next couple of years. 
At a time when 10 million Americans 
are already unemployed, these figures 
are shocking. Yet Democrats aren’t 
stopping there. Last week, the Demo-
cratic leader came to the floor, and he 
urged President Biden to go even fur-
ther, to do even more—much more 
than was criticized by the New York 
Times. He said President Biden should 
declare a national emergency because 
of climate change—a national emer-
gency, he said, the leader of the Demo-
cratic Party, on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate. Leader SCHUMER is admitting 
that this radical environmental agenda 
doesn’t have bipartisan support. It 
doesn’t seem to even have Presidential 
support to that level, but that is what 
Senator SCHUMER is calling for. 
Apparently, Senator SCHUMER isn’t 
just wanting to outsource energy jobs; 
he seems to want to outsource the 
work of the U.S. Senate as well. That 
is not what the American people sent 
us here to do. They didn’t send us here 
to stand by and watch a President go 
with one Executive order after another, 
after another; they sent us here to get 
things done. 
The truth is, despite what Leader 
SCHUMER says, there is actually bipar-
tisan support for action on climate 
change. Just over a month ago, the 
Senate passed a bill called the USE IT 
Act, which I authored with Senator 
CARPER. It came through the Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee, 
which I chaired. It was completely bi-
partisan. It came through the com-
mittee unanimously. It doesn’t cost a

single American a job. It makes a dif-
ference with regard to climate. That is 
what the American people sent us here 
to do, to work together to find solu-
tions that work, that don’t hurt. Un-
fortunately, it is not the Biden ap-
proach. The Biden approach turns out 
to be more mandates, less energy pro-
duction, and fewer American jobs. 
Now we see President Biden pushing 
a $2 trillion spending bill. He says it is 
to help fight coronavirus. We just 
passed a $900 billion coronavirus relief 
bill about a month ago, signed into 
law, and as a result, our economy is ac-
tually doing better than expected. 
Now President Biden, with his new 
bill, wants to send checks to families 
making in excess of $250,000 a year—a 
government check, paid for by tax-
payers, added to the national debt. 
Families making over a quarter of a 
million dollars a year getting a check 
from the government when they have 
never missed a paycheck in the first 
place? 
He also wants to give added bonuses 
for people who are out of work on un-
employment. People who are out of 
work on unemployment need that un-
employment but not with the added bo-
nuses to the level that President Biden 
is pointing to. And I hear about it in 
Wyoming. I heard about it last week. 
If we pass what President Biden is 
calling for, the average unemployed 
American would receive a little less 
than $800 a week total from the govern-
ment, by their regular unemployment 
and by the enhanced unemployment. 
That is equivalent to a job making 
$40,000 a year. People would, in many 
places, be paid more to not go back to 
work than they could earn if they went 
back to work. So the incentive is to 
keep them out of work. At the same 
time, we have ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs up 
around the State of Wyoming. 
President Biden’s proposal also in-
cludes billions of dollars in spending 
unrelated to coronavirus—completely 
unrelated—which 
is 
something 
the 
American 
people 
don’t 
understand. 
They understand we need to fight 
coronavirus. They understand we need 
to get people back to work. They un-
derstand we need to get kids back to 
school. But to add extraneous spending 
unrelated to coronavirus is something 
Americans don’t understand. 
Now, this bill includes a mandate 
from Washington, DC, a mandate to 
the small businesses all around the 
country—many of them struggling, 
many of them having a hard time mak-
ing their payroll—and the Washington 
mandate 
is, 
you 
will 
double 
the 
amount of money that you pay right 
now if you are paying the current min-
imum 
wage—doubling 
the 
national 
minimum wage; a mandate from Wash-
ington on small business; nothing to do 
with coronavirus but a lot to do with 
making it that much harder for the 
small businesses in the small towns of 
Wyoming to make their payroll and to 
stay open. 
Now, it makes common sense when 
you take a look at that impact—and 
even the Congressional Budget Office 
has looked at it, and they have come to 
the same conclusion that I have and 
that the people of Wyoming have: It is 
going to cost jobs. The Congressional 
Budget Office says it will cost 1,300,000 
jobs across America if President Biden 
has his way and forces a double of the 
minimum wage on small businesses of 
America. 
Now, in exchange for that Federal 
mandate, the bill pays off States, big 
cities, blue States with a long history 
of bad behavior, to the tune of $350 bil-
lion. A study from JPMorgan just came 
out, and the study shows that State 
tax revenues barely dropped at all in 
2020 as a result of the coronavirus. 
They dropped less than 1 percent. 
These States do not need $350 billion of 
additional Federal support. If the State 
needs a bailout, it is not because of 
coronavirus; it is because of a long his-
tory of mismanagement. 
The Biden administration made this 
proposal without any meaningful dis-
cussions with Republicans at all. And 
the administration is even ignoring the 
Democrats. Vice President Harris re-
cently went on television in West Vir-
ginia and in Arizona. Why? Not to put 
pressure on Republicans; to put pres-
sure on Democrats—big story in the 
New York Times today—putting pres-
sure on the two new Senators, Senator 
SINEMA and—the Senators from Ari-
zona—Senator KELLY, the newest elect-
ed Senator from Arizona, put on them 
to vote for the bill. She also went to 
West Virginia—Senator MANCHIN. Not 
only are they not talking to Repub-
licans; now they are trying to pressure 
Democrats. 
Let’s face it. The Democrats are try-
ing to cram this bill through Congress. 
That is what they are going to do with 
the vote-arama this week. 
On Friday there was an article in the 
Washington Post. The headline is this: 
‘‘Biden, Democrats prepare to move be-
yond efforts to woo Republicans.’’ I 
have to ask, what efforts? Haven’t 
reached out in any serious way. As 
some of my colleagues have said, we 
have proven we can work together with 
coronavirus relief. We did it five times 
in the last year. We passed five dif-
ferent coronavirus relief bills, and the 
total relief was $4 trillion. 
The article in the Post goes on and 
quotes Leader SCHUMER. He says that 
we must not repeat the mistakes of 
2008 and 2009. He is referring to the fis-
cal crisis back then. Well, that re-
sponse was then led by Vice President 
Joe Biden. Yes, there were plenty of 
mistakes. Leader SCHUMER
seems to 
think that the mistake was that it was 
too bipartisan, and that is the wrong 
lesson. The mistake Congress made 
under Vice President Biden in 2009 was 
to spend huge sums of money, com-
pletely unrelated to solving the under-
lying problem. Yet that is what the 
Democrats seem to want to do once 
again. The last time the Democrats did 
that, we had the slowest recovery since 
the Great Depression. Do you know 
what got us out of that slow recovery? 
American 
energy, 
which 
President 
Biden is now trying to kill. There are a 
lot of lessons to be learned here. 
So, on Monday, 10 Republican Sen-
ators went to the White House and 
made 
their 
own 
proposal 
on 
coronavirus relief. I really do hope the 
President listened because 2 weeks into 
this administration, the President’s in-
augural address is not something that 
is going to be remembered like John 
Kennedy’s inaugural address was in 
1960. This inaugural address is going to 
be remembered for empty rhetoric. 
President Biden has been trying to gov-
ern using a pen and a phone. Remember 
that from the Obama administration? I 
would say to President Biden: Time to 
just put down the pen and pick up the 
phone. 
A Democratic politician famously 
said that politicians campaign in po-
etry and govern in prose. President 
Biden campaigned in moderation, but 
that is not the way he is governing. He 
is governing in partisanship. It is not 
what the American people are asking 
for. It is not what they voted for. 
We have a 50–50 Senate. Democrats 
have a very narrow majority in the 
House. I would urge the administration 
to change course. This—if there is a 
mandate—is a mandate to move to the 
middle. I urge my Democratic col-
leagues to work with us on real 
coronavirus relief, on producing more 
American energy, and on creating more 
jobs across our country. Let us come 
together and get things done. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The junior Senator from

REMEMBERING JERRY ELLIG 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to honor the life of a dear friend 
and a former colleague of mine, Jerry 
Ellig. 
Some 2 weeks ago, at just 58 years 
old, Jerry passed away. Jerry and I met 
in June of 2001. We were both working 
in the George W. Bush administration. 
We were working together at the Fed-
eral Trade Commission. I had just been 
hired, at all of 30 years old, to run the 
Policy Planning Office, and Jerry was 
my Deputy. 
I hadn’t met Jerry. Our boss Tim 
Muris, the Chairman, had brought 
Jerry in beforehand. It is always a dan-
gerous thing when somebody else hires 
your Deputy, but in this case, Tim did 
me an enormous favor. Jerry was a col-
league of Tim’s from George Mason 
University, a Ph.D. economist, a bril-
liant man, a lover of liberty. And Jerry 
and I, for the next 2 years, ran the Pol-
icy Planning Office together, and we 
became dear friends. 
I don’t know that I ever saw Jerry 
without a smile, without a twinkle in 
his eye. He always had a joyful spirit, 
a mischievous grin. And he believed in 
the power of truth. He became an econ-
omist because, I think, Jerry was born

thought about supply and demand and 
price elasticity. And he believed in the 
power of free markets. 
One of the things that the Policy 
Planning Office did was something 
called competition advocacy. Now, the 
FTC statutory mandate is to defend 
the competition. There are some 75 
Ph.D. economists on the full-time staff 
at the FTC. And Jerry and I, together, 
when various State legislatures or 
State regulatory bodies across the 
country were considering a particular 
bill that would have potentially anti- 
competitive effects—if those State leg-
islatures or regulators asked for our 
input, the FTC would analyze the pro-
posed bill, and we would file testimony, 
written 
testimony, 
oral 
testimony. 
Both Jerry and I testified multiple 
places. In fact, I went to my office and 
pulled out the binder of all the com-
petition advocacy that we filed in our 
time together at the FTC on topic after 
topic after topic. 
You know, there are a lot of bad 
ideas that government considers, bad 
ideas that come from special pleaders— 
someone who will benefit—but the 
harm to consumers is usually diffuse, 
harder to see, and much greater. 
And what the FTC would do in com-
petition advocacy is simply quantify 
the harm, simply provide truth and 
light and sunshine. It was incredible 
that when we would be asked to come 
in and present that testimony over and 
over and over again, the decision mak-
ers would choose not to adopt bad poli-
cies, simply when they understood, 
through careful empirical analysis, 
how that would hurt the consumers. 
One area, in particular, that Jerry 
and I worked on quite a bit was e-com-
merce. We started an e-commerce task 
force. This was 20 years ago. E-com-
merce was in a much more nascent 
stage 20 years ago than it is today. We 
examined 10 different industries, every 
one of which there were barriers to 
entry. The existing bricks and mortar 
suppliers would go to their State regu-
lators and seek to erect barriers to 
entry to stop new e-commerce entrants 
from competing and driving down 
prices. 
Actually, much of the impetus for 
the entire e-commerce task force came 
from a white paper that the Presiding 
Officer will be interested to know 
where this white paper came from. It 
was the Democratic Leadership Coun-
cil, a centrist Democrat group that had 
written a white paper entitled ‘‘Re-
venge of the Dissenter Mediated.’’ And 
it talked about all these industries 
where e-commerce was benefiting con-
sumers but entrenched interests were 
fighting against it. 
Jerry and I, together at the FTC, we 
convened 3 days of public hearings of 10 
different 
industries—contact 
lenses, 
telemedicine, education, funerals and 
caskets, wine. 
It was interesting. At the end of the 
hearings, we prepared a series of re-
ports. Every single industry panel—all 
10 of the ones who testified—at least 1 
of the witnesses said some variance of 
the following: You know, I have looked 
at the anti-competitive restraints in 
these other nine industries, and those 
are terrible. Those are clearly hurting 
consumers, but our industry is dif-
ferent. 
One of the industries we looked at 
that Jerry took a particular passion 
for was wine. There were, at the time, 
extensive restrictions on direct ship-
ment of wine—shipment across State 
lines, shipment to your home. It was 
heavily, heavily regulated, and the 
wholesalers did not want to see that 
change. We began studying and work-
ing on what would become a wine re-
port. It is over 100 pages long of empir-
ical study on what that was doing. We 
concluded that for consumers, it was 
driving up costs dramatically, not just 
a little bit but dramatically. 
I will tell you, Jerry took great joy 
in traveling through Northern Vir-
ginia, going to wineries, sampling the 
wine—I will say, he enjoyed that proc-
ess of it as well—but collecting empir-
ical price data. 
At the time, numerous arguments 
were raised as to why you should not 
allow the direct shipping of wine. One 
was that it would lead to minors drink-
ing too much. I have to admit, Jerry 
and I laughed about that because I 
don’t know that I have ever known a 
15-year-old who wanted a nice, perky 
chardonnay. If you were dealing with 
home keg deliveries, that I will con-
cede would raise an issue, but wine 
connoisseurs does not match any teen-
agers I have known. 
But we decided, well, rather than 
argue about it theoretically, let’s find 
out. So we sent a letter to the alcohol 
control boards in each of the States 
that allowed direct shipment. We asked 
them a very simple question: Have you 
seen any problem? Have you encoun-
tered any problems with underage 
drinking as a result of this policy? And 
lo and behold, they all wrote back and 
said: No, we haven’t seen it at all. It 
hasn’t produced any of that. All that 
came together in a report detailing the 
harm to consumers that came from 
these restrictions. 
I will tell you, just a couple of years 
later, the U.S. Supreme Court took up 
a case challenging those restrictions on 
the interstate sale of wine, striking 
them down, so that now you or I, if we 
want to order a bottle of wine for our 
home, we can go and do it on our phone 
and get it delivered at our home. The 
Supreme Court decision striking that 
down cited that wine report that Jerry 
and I had done more than a dozen 
times. As I said, Jerry believed in the 
power of truth, the power of facts, sim-
ply shining a light: This is hurting peo-
ple. 
Jerry also took joy in that project. 
You know, Jerry was a fan of tiki cock-
tails and mixology and all of tiki cul-
ture, for that matter. He would proudly 
wear Hawaiian shirts—loud Hawaiian 
shirts that his daughter Kat had picked 
out for him. And he would wear them 
with the smile and joy he brought 
every day. 
He also made some of his own wine. 
For several years, Heidi and I enjoyed 
a bottle of cherry port that Jerry had 
made. He wasn’t at risk of suddenly 
going into the winery business, but it 
was still, nonetheless, an enjoyable 
bottle of cherry port. 
Another project Jerry undertook at 
the FTC was examining education and 
school choice. I sat down with Jerry 
and another Ph.D. economist at the 
FTC, and we talked about school 
choice. And I asked the two of them, 
Jerry and Ken, I said: Let’s examine 
the arguments that are raised against 
school choice. The most significant ar-
gument raised against school choice is 
that school choice will destroy the pub-
lic schools; that it will harm the public 
schools if you give low-income kids ac-
cess to scholarships. We sat down and 
said: All right, let’s treat that argu-
ment seriously. Let’s not dismiss that 
out of hand. Let’s treat it seriously be-
cause if it were true, I would oppose 
school choice. That is a serious reason 
to oppose it. Let’s find out if it is true. 
Jerry and Ken, as economists are 
want to do, they framed the problem 
more broadly. They said: What is the 
impact in a regulated monopoly or oli-
gopoly when competition is introduced 
and, in particular, what is the impact 
on quality for the customers who re-
main with the incumbent providers, 
not the folks who go to the new en-
trants but the customers that just re-
main with the incumbent provider? 
They went through and they examined 
multiple other industries that had been 
regulated monopolies or oligopolies 
and for which there were abundant 
data. 
They looked at telecom; they looked 
at airlines; they looked at surface 
freight transportation. And as they de-
tailed in each instance, when competi-
tion came in, quality went up. Com-
petition was good. They then examined 
every empirical study that had been 
done to date of school choice programs 
that had been implemented across the 
country. 
They 
found 
that, 
unsurprisingly, again, that competi-
tion was good—something we have seen 
in the two decades since; that when 
kids get options and competition is 
brought in and scholarships are avail-
able, that the quality of education in 
struggling public schools gets better 
and better and better. That article was 
published: ‘‘Competition and quality in 
deregulated industries: Lessons for the 
education debate.’’ It is another exam-
ple of how Jerry recognized that facts, 
that reason can be powerful. 
When I left the FTC, Jerry went on 
to take over the Office of Policy Plan-
ning. He led that office of lawyers and 
economists who loved Jerry, loved his 
principles, loved his drive, loved his 
warmth, loved his humor. He was a 
professor for decades, beloved by his 
students. 
He spent decades at Mercatus study-
ing regulations, studying the impact of

overregulation, analyzing it. He just 
finished his tenure as the Chief Econo-
mist at the Federal Communications 
Commission. He was a brilliant guy. 
When he passed 2 weeks ago—an un-
timely 
death—talented 
economists 
from governments and the academy 
mourned 
Jerry, 
writing 
touching 
words. And in Discourse Magazine, pub-
lished by the Mercatus Center, Ajit 
Pai, Chairman of the FTC, for whom 
Jerry worked as Chief Economist, 
wrote that he would always remember 
Jerry’s warm smile. 
Jerry would always start off the conversa-
tion with a warm smile, which would put ev-
eryone at ease. He would then explain in a 
collegial tone how he thought we should pro-
ceed—wisdom that always informed our ulti-
mate decisions. Smiling and speaking gently 
are small things, perhaps; but at a time 
when the currency of public policy discourse 
is too often pounding the table, Jerry’s ap-
proach was memorable. 
He loved his work. He loved econom-
ics. He loved free markets. And he 
loved his family. Jerry was blessed 
with an incredible wife Sandy, who is a 
dear friend as well; their daughter Kat, 
whom they adore—an incredible loving, 
fun family. You know, when they were 
on road trips, Jerry would eat grilled 
cheese sandwiches made by his daugh-
ter in a toaster oven in the car because 
he loved Kat so much. 
Jerry, like myself, is also a big fan of 
the movie ‘‘The Princess Bride.’’ Jer-
ry’s death so early is inconceivable. 
God bless the memory of Dr. Jerry 
Ellig. God bless the Ellig family. 
In Heaven, the lion lies down with 
the lamb and, Jerry, may there be no 
transaction costs and may the Coase 
theorem fully operate. 
We love you, and we miss you, Jerry. 
God bless you.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, we 
are 1 year into the worst pandemic in a 
century, and it is clear that Native 
Americans have felt some of the most 
severe impacts of COVID. 
Here is what we know: The number of 
confirmed cases per capita among Na-
tive Americans is 31⁄2 times that of 
White Americans; they are almost 
twice as likely to die from COVID than 
White Americans when they contract 
it; and over a third of all Native Ameri-
cans are at high risk of serious COVID– 
19-related complications—the highest 
percentage of any group in the United 
States. Native Americans need help 
now, and it is our job to deliver. 
President Biden has proposed a bold 
plan, one that meets the moment and 
one that helps our most vulnerable 
communities. The President’s plan in-
cludes more than $28 billion for Native 
people, making it the largest invest-
ment in Indian Country in American 
history. From Hawaiian homelands to 
villages, pueblos, rancherias, and other 
Native communities, our fellow Ameri-
cans who live on or near these lands 
need immediate relief, not half meas-
ures, not delays. 
As the new chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs, I urge my 
colleagues to join me in voting for this 
resolution and delivering critical relief 
to all Native Americans—Native Ha-
waiians, Alaska Natives, and American 
Indians. 
First, to help slow the spread in Na-
tive communities, we have to invest in 
healthcare, and that is why this resolu-
tion includes millions of dollars in crit-
ical resources to support the Native 
Hawaiian 
Healthcare 
Systems 
and 
more than $6 billion for the Indian 
Health Service, which is the primary 
vaccine distributor for more than 330 
Tribes and urban Indian organizations 
across the country. 
These funds are going to help en-
hance healthcare services, particularly 
by improving the IHS’s telehealth in-
frastructure. 
The 
IHS 
and 
Tribal 
healthcare facilities are overwhelm-
ingly located in rural and isolated set-
tings, with little access to specialty 
services, like cardiology. So expanding 
telehealth so that more people can get 
the specialty care they need wherever 
they are is a game changer for Native 
communities. Finally, these healthcare 
funds will support the medical workers 
who are on the frontlines every day, 
caring for Native families and fighting 
the virus. 
We also need to shore up Tribal gov-
ernments and Federal programs and 
services that Native people rely on 
with an infusion of resources. That 
kind of historic, critical investment is 
exactly what President Biden proposes 
to do. Because Tribes are uniquely de-
pendent on their business enterprises 
to fund essential government services 
for their citizens, this budget resolu-
tion calls for $20 billion to support 
Tribal governments. To put a fine 
point on it, the gaming operations are 
mostly closed, and that is how they 
fund health and education in many in-
stances. These funds will enable Tribes 
to continue to provide services like 
elder care and the deliveries of medi-
cine and food that are particularly 
critical during the pandemic, and it 
will help us to keep the lights on at 
their businesses. 
There is also $750 million to address 
overcrowding in homes and homeless-
ness—circumstances 
that 
dispropor-
tionately affect Native Americans be-
cause housing stock tends to be scarce, 
and this problem compounds with peo-
ple living in tight quarters and being 
unable to avoid the spread of COVID– 
19. Ensuring Native Americans have ac-
cess to safe and affordable housing is 
essential to stopping the spread of 
COVID and crushing this pandemic. 
The plan also includes $900 million 
for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to sup-
port critical programs that keep people 
safe, protect kids, and help to deliver 
water to Native families. Now, espe-
cially during this pandemic, the BIA 
should step up, own its fiduciary re-
sponsibility, and help the Tribes fight 
the negative impacts of COVID in their 
communities. 
There is also $850 million for the Bu-
reau of Indian Education’s schools, col-
leges, and universities to address crit-
ical education infrastructure and to en-
hance distance learning capabilities 
and, hopefully, bring kids back into the 
physical classroom. Yet you can’t do 
that without money. You can’t do that 
without crushing the pandemic. You 
can’t do that without safety. We must 
make sure that Native students don’t 
get left behind and that we protect the 
health and safety of students and 
teachers. 
We all need to work together and 
support Native families and commu-
nities across the Nation. I think about 
the history of the Senate Committee 
on Indian Affairs, and I think of my 
two predecessors, Senator Daniel K. 
Inouye and Senator Daniel Kahikina 
Akaka, and the legacies that they built 
of bipartisanship. 
I understand we are about to have a 
fight this week around a very silly 
process called vote-arama, but we need 
to remember what this is all about. 
This is not about a goofy 10-hour or 12- 
hour or 15-hour process where we stack 
amendments and try to set each other 
up that will somehow trick someone 
into taking a bad position that can be 
turned into a campaign advertisement. 
That is tomorrow, and it is nonsense, 
and everybody should ignore it if they 
can. Do anything to not watch vote- 
arama. It is boring, and it is the worst 
part of the U.S. Senate, but it is a very 
important means to an end. 
It is a very important means to an 
end because we were elected to deliver 
COVID relief. Once we get through this 
goofy 
process 
tomorrow 
night—or 
maybe it is Friday morning or when-
ever it is—we are going to be in a posi-
tion to deliver COVID relief. Then we 
are going to be in a position to talk to 
our Republican colleagues on and off 
the 
committee 
representing 
Indian 
Country, representing Alaska Native 
communities, and representing Native 
Hawaiian communities and figure out 
how to make sure that the people who 
are suffering the worst during this pan-
demic get the help they need and de-
serve, and that is something we can 
come back together on as we move for-
ward on this legislation. 
With that, I yield to the senior Sen-
ator from Nevada, a member of the In-
dian Affairs Committee, Ms. CORTEZ 
MASTO. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to join my good colleague, 
the chair of the Senate Indian Affairs 
Committee, the Senator from Hawaii, 
and I couldn’t agree more with him in 
my support of the budget resolution 
that is coming before the committee in 
the Senate this week. 
In Nevada and across the country, 
our Tribes are hurting. They are trying 
to do too much with far, far too little. 
Some of them are still under lockdown,

desperate to protect elders—often the 
gatekeepers of rich Native languages 
and cultures—from the impact of the 
virus that they see is devastating their 
communities, and many are struggling 
to keep business doors open. All of 
them are stretched too thin. Sadly, 
this isn’t new. Tribes were suffering 
from unstable funding streams and 
budget 
shortfalls 
even 
before 
the 
coronavirus pandemic affected their 
economies. Now on shoestring budg-
ets—with staffing levels that were in-
sufficient even before the pandemic 
hit—they are trying to address the 
myriad urgent needs of their commu-
nities. 
That means administering COVID–19 
testing and getting vaccines into arms, 
all while providing a whole range of 
other critical healthcare services like 
behavioral 
healthcare 
and 
primary 
care. It also means administering af-
fordable housing programs, supporting 
Tribal businesses, and ensuring the 
safety of the students and teachers in 
Native communities. The needs are im-
mense. 
Coronavirus relief for Nevada and the 
Nation’s Tribes has to address the dis-
parities that have made Natives up to 
3.5 times more likely to contract 
COVID–19, and it has to make sure 
Tribes can build back economically 
after the pandemic ends. To do this, we 
have to start by replenishing the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund, the Edu-
cation Stabilization Fund, and the 
Homeowner Assistance Fund, all of 
which have been providing valuable 
lifelines to Native communities im-
pacted by COVID–19. 
The Federal Government absolutely 
has to do more to support these efforts 
and uphold the Federal trust responsi-
bility. It can help Tribes navigate the 
Federal bureaucracy and ensure that 
funds allocated to Tribal priorities ac-
tually get into the hands of those who 
need them. 
Congress also needs to make sure 
that we are meeting our treaty obliga-
tions to provide healthcare for Amer-
ican Indians and Alaska Natives even 
when they live in urban areas rather 
than on Tribal lands. We can start by 
passing the Urban Indian Health Parity 
Act to shore up Medicaid funding for 
urban Indian healthcare facilities and 
put them on a level playing field with 
Indian Health Services run by the Fed-
eral Government or Tribes on reserva-
tions. 
Looking forward, we also must do 
more to permanently and robustly fund 
the Indian Health Service. This pan-
demic has only shown the risks of 
underinvesting in public health in Na-
tive communities, and we have to 
make sure that the IHS is able to pre-
pare for emergencies, like this one, far 
better in the future. Leaving American 
Indian and Alaska Native communities 
without sustainable funding streams 
for the health services that they were 
guaranteed by this government is a 
violation of our treaty obligations, 
plain and simple. 
I support every resource we can get 
for Nevada’s hard-hit Native commu-
nities and our communities across the 
country, and that is why I urge my col-
leagues to support this budget resolu-
tion that will help these hardest hit 
communities. 
I yield the floor to my new colleague 
from the great State of New Mexico. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam President, I rise 
to speak on the resolution’s invest-
ment of $8.6 billion through the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs. 
Our Native American brothers and 
sisters on Tribal lands are four times 
more likely to contract COVID–19 and 
twice as likely to die from it. The Nav-
ajo Nation has seen extended families 
ravaged by disease, families like the 
Muskets, who were careful to protect 
their elderly parents, Benjamin and 
Louise, from the virus. Despite taking 
the necessary precautions and having 
access 
to 
electricity 
and 
running 
water—something many of our Navajo 
brothers and sisters still lack—the 
whole family became ill. Because the 
overburdened IHS-run medical center 
closest to them was unable to treat 
Benjamin’s advanced condition, he was 
flown to one of the nearest hospitals in 
Albuquerque that would have taken 
hours to have gotten there by car. He 
died far from his beloved Louise. Five 
days later, Louise also passed. 
In New Mexico, community members 
and students are still mourning the 
loss of Laura Escalanti, a beloved Tewa 
teacher 
at 
Pojoaque 
Valley 
High 
School, from San Ildefonso Pueblo. 
‘‘Ms. Laura,’’ as she was known, im-
parted on her students pride in them-
selves through language. Her funeral 
procession from Ohkay Owingeh to San 
Ildefonso Pueblo brought mourners out 
from their homes to the roadways to 
bid farewell to their teacher of more 
than 20 years. Sadly, there are too 
many Native American families and 
communities mourning loved ones. 
This resolution strikes at the heart 
of the health disparities and cir-
cumstances that make Tribal commu-
nities more vulnerable to COVID–19. It 
provides Tribal and public governments 
with critical funding to take action 
against the deadly virus and the havoc 
it has wreaked on their citizens, their 
economies, and the public health infra-
structure. The budget resolution pro-
vides necessary investments to support 
Tribal governments that have strug-
gled to maintain public and social safe-
ty network services. 
It also provides the Indian Health 
Service, which is the primary vaccine 
provider for over 330 Tribal nations and 
urban 
Indian 
health 
organizations, 
with funding and resources to respond 
to this crisis. 
Access to nearby hospitals and emer-
gency services may be dozens, even 
hundreds of miles away in my State, 
and we must do everything in our 
power here in the Senate, here in the 
House, and in Washington, DC, to en-
sure that every hospital and clinic has 
the staff and supplies to get families 
the care they need. 
Our response to COVID–19 must sup-
port and protect the most vulnerable 
among us. Today’s resolution recog-
nizes that, and I am proud to support 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, for 
more than a year, our country has been 
in the grip of an unprecedented health 
and economic catastrophe. 
It was January, if we recall, of last 
year when the first confirmed case of 
COVID–19 was found in our country. 
Since then, more than 444,000 of our fel-
low citizens have died, more than 26 
million have been infected, millions 
have lost their jobs, and every day 
there are another thousands more 
deaths. 
A year ago, former President Trump 
boasted—just think of this. This is just 
a year ago. He said that there were 
only 15 COVID–19 cases in this country, 
and he said that soon the number 
would be zero. 
For months, he told the American 
people there was nothing to worry 
about. Nothing to worry about? Tell 
the 26 million who have been infected, 
the nearly half a million who have 
died, because it is obvious to anyone 
paying attention to the country’s pub-
lic health experts that, unfortunately, 
he had no idea what he was talking 
about. But, of course, he wasn’t inter-
ested in what anyone else had to say. 
All 
of 
us 
can 
see 
so 
many 
unforgiveable 
mistakes, 
so 
many 
missed opportunities in dealing with 
this virus that we and the world are 
now facing a calamity unlike anything 
in modern history. 
The last administration, rather than 
unite the country against the virus, 
chastised people for wearing masks. 
They vilified Governors who tried to 
stop the spread of the virus. Former 
President Trump said it would dis-
appear ‘‘like magic.’’ 
Over the summer we lost even more 
time with the inexplicable decision to 
take a ‘‘pause’’ and delay further 
COVID relief. That was precious time 
that could have been spent trying to 
get the pandemic under control. Time 
was wasted while the virus spread and 
mutated, and now we are dealing with 
multiple variants, some of which are 
more easily transmissible and possibly 
more deadly. 
The previous administration’s han-
dling of this disease was a monu-
mental, unforgiveable failure of leader-
ship. Tens of thousands of Americans 
would be alive today if the Trump ad-
ministration had done their job or, at 
the very least, stopped making it im-
possible for the people who wanted to 
do their job. Historians are going to 
judge him harshly. That was then. Our 
job now is to rally behind a President 
who understands the seriousness and 
urgency of what we are facing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S297 
February 3, 2021 
The $1.9 trillion package proposed by 
President Biden is the kind of bold, 
comprehensive proposal we have need-
ed since last spring. I felt privileged to 
sit with him this morning, along with 
other Senators, and discuss it, because 
we know the President’s plan would 
provide the resources to mount a na-
tional 
vaccination 
program, 
safely 
open our schools, restore American 
global leadership, and provide direct 
support to the people in need. 
Now, everybody here wants to reopen 
our economy, but we can’t do that if we 
don’t defeat the virus. President Biden 
understands that. He also understands 
that as long as the virus is spreading 
anywhere, it threatens people every-
where. That is why we need a global re-
sponse. 
As incoming chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, I am com-
mitted to supporting the President’s 
proposal expeditiously. The American 
people have endured enough despair, 
sickness, and death due to the incom-
petence of the previous administration. 
I also share President Biden’s desire 
to make this a bipartisan process. He 
and I served together in this body, and 
I know he wants to do that. But the 
price of bipartisanship cannot be a 
package that falls far short of meeting 
the needs of the American people. 
There were painful consequences for 
delaying another broad relief package 
between April and December of last 
year, even though many of us wanted 
to bring it to the floor of the Senate, 
and now there are reasons why States 
today don’t have the quantity of vac-
cines they need, why our schools are 
being closed, why millions are out of 
work, and why the virus is spreading 
out of control. Valuable time was 
squandered. Countless people suffered 
and died as a result. 
So I certainly cannot accept a piece-
meal approach or months of further 
delay. The clock is ticking. In mid- 
March, key benefits that millions of 
Americans are relying on to survive 
will begin to lapse. We can’t allow a 
self-inflicted wound to make their lives 
even worse. 
Now, I am glad to see several of my 
friends from the other side of the aisle 
bring forth their own plan, but I am 
afraid the plan they have shown so far 
shortchanges America in critical ways. 
It provides little of the resources need-
ed to reopen schools. It doesn’t include 
money for State and local governments 
that are on the frontlines fighting this 
virus. And those State and local gov-
ernments have been forced to lay off 
more than 1 million people since 
March. It cuts direct payments to 
struggling 
families 
from 
$1,400 
to 
$1,000. If you are one of those strug-
gling families, it not only hurts, it can 
be devastating. 
And their proposal completely ig-
nores what every single public health 
expert knows: If we don’t help the 
lower income countries protect their 
people, we cannot defeat the virus. 
This is a global pandemic, and as long 
as it is spreading in Central America 
and Africa and Asia, the virus and 
more deadly variants will find their 
way here. We learned that when we got 
together and fought Ebola when it was 
only an airplane flight away. Well, 
these strains are popping up all over 
the world. We have to work with other 
countries. 
So I am hopeful there may be a bipar-
tisan path forward, but I am not going 
to concede any tools at our disposal 
that can deliver the relief that the 
American people need—the relief long 
overdue. 
I support the budget resolution that 
has been introduced. It put us on a 
path to passing a COVID relief package 
through the budget reconciliation proc-
ess, and there is no reason a reconcili-
ation bill can’t be bipartisan. We have 
passed at least 17 bipartisan reconcili-
ation bills since 1980 on behalf of the 
American people, and I welcome any 
Republican who would like to discuss 
where we could reach a compromise. 
But let us not forget for a moment 
we are in the midst of a public health 
emergency, and right now the virus is 
winning. We are not winning; the virus 
is winning. So we can’t waste months, 
like we did last year, negotiating a 
plan that fails to mount an effective 
response to the virus or to fully re-
spond to the economic havoc it is caus-
ing. 
We need quick action. We need a bold 
and comprehensive plan to fight the 
virus. We need to get people back to 
work so our economy can recover. That 
is what President Biden proposed. 
You know, there is greater danger in 
doing too little than in doing too 
much. Secretary Yellen stated it so 
well when she recently stated, ‘‘The 
smartest thing we can do is act big.’’ 
It has been more than a year since 
this disease arrived in our country. It 
was never going to just ‘‘disappear.’’ 
Viruses never do that. So there is no 
excuse for dragging our feet. Let’s all 
support the bold package proposed by 
President Biden for the American peo-
ple. I know I will. 
I see the distinguished Senator from 
Ohio on the floor, so I yield to him. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, it is 
an honor to speak after Senator LEAHY, 
who has served his country and his 
State for over four decades. 
This debate is really about one sim-
ple question: Are we going to do what-
ever it takes—whatever it takes—to 
get our country through a once-in-a- 
generation crisis? 
We did that in March, a year ago. We 
haven’t done it since. Now is our oppor-
tunity. 
I joined some of my colleagues today 
at the White House to talk with Presi-
dent Biden about the urgency—the ur-
gency—to get this done, to go big, and 
his plan that will finally start to make 
real progress against the pandemic and 
make a real difference in people’s lives. 
The American people made it clear in 
this election: They want a government 
that is on their side. It is our chance to 
deliver for them. 
We know we can. As I said, we did it 
last spring. We came together across 
the aisle. We passed the CARES Act. 
We expanded employment insurance, 
and 
we 
provided 
direct 
stimulus 
checks. We kept—and this is remark-
able in the midst of a pandemic—13 
million people in this country out of 
poverty. It gave tens of millions more 
peace of mind with a bit of a cushion to 
weather this crisis. 
Think about that. Congress came to-
gether. 
Government 
did 
the 
right 
thing, and 13 million people were pre-
vented from falling into poverty. 
But then, as you know, what hap-
pened is, because we didn’t act in May 
and June, in July and August, that 
help started to fall away, and thou-
sands of people every single day in Mil-
waukee and in Cleveland and around 
this country, in Racine and in Day-
ton—thousands of people a day fell into 
poverty. 
So my colleagues now say we have 
done enough. Well, tell that to the 92 
percent of Americans who haven’t got-
ten a vaccine yet. Tell that to the par-
ents who wonder when it will finally be 
safe for their kids to go back to school. 
Tell that to the laid-off restaurant 
worker in Madison, wondering if she 
will be able to pay rent and pay the 
electric bill. Tell that to the busdriver 
in Columbus, wondering if she is going 
to lose her job. 
We are the wealthiest country on 
Earth. Doing the bare minimum simply 
isn’t good enough. 
Slowly vaccinating people—when we 
know we are facing a new, more con-
tagious 
virus 
variant—isn’t 
good 
enough. 
Letting our economic recovery limp 
along instead of roaring back isn’t 
good enough. 
Luckily, we have real leaders who 
aren’t willing to settle for less. Presi-
dent Biden is already doing everything 
possible to ramp up vaccine produc-
tion, to get new COVID tests on the 
market. He promised 1 million vaccines 
a day for the first hundred days of his 
Presidency. We are exceeding that 
number. It will help keep people in 
their homes. It will help keep workers 
from losing their jobs. 
We need to give the President and 
our leaders in States all over the coun-
try every tool we can. Our plan puts 
money directly into people’s pockets 
with the expanded stimulus checks, 
with tax cuts for workers and families, 
and through the expanded earned in-
come tax credit and child tax credit. 
As chair of the Banking and Housing 
Committee beginning tomorrow, I am 
committed to keeping a roof over peo-
ple’s heads, giving a lifeline to small 
businesses, keeping our buses and sub-
ways running, keeping workers on the 
job, and giving President Biden every 
tool possible through the Defense Pro-
duction Act to get more vaccines to 
more people. 
Our plan will help us dramatically 
expand American manufacturing. The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S298 
February 3, 2021 
Presiding Officer has led the Senate on 
‘‘Buy American.’’ We will do more of 
that through the Defense Production 
Act. We will produce vaccines and PPE 
and more and better tests. We will help 
State and local communities and pre-
vent layoffs and service cuts. 
Essential workers—and a grocery 
store worker in Southwest Ohio told 
me several months ago: You know, 
they call me an essential worker, but I 
feel expendable because they don’t pay 
me enough and they don’t protect us on 
the job. 
That has to change. Essential work-
ers need help. They need buses and sub-
ways to get to work, to hospitals and 
grocery stores. We need those transit 
systems running and running safely. 
We need to keep busdrivers and con-
struction workers on the job and on the 
job safely. 
Our plan will give more support to 
small and minority-owned businesses. 
We know the biggest corporations have 
done better than ever during this pan-
demic. Amazon, Walmart, Comcast—all 
the big guys are doing just fine. They 
pretty much always do no matter what 
is happening with the rest of the coun-
try. They have paid their shareholders. 
They have done stock buybacks. But 
we have seen restaurants close in our 
neighborhood, some that have been op-
erating for decades. We watched corner 
stores 
and 
drycleaners 
shut 
their 
doors. Small businesses are hurting. 
Our plan will not only keep PPP going, 
it will expand access to capital for the 
small entrepreneurs fighting for their 
dreams now. 
Our plan will keep families from los-
ing their homes. It will help them pay 
their bills and keep the heat on and the 
lights turned on. In December, 1 in 10 
homeowners reported being behind on 
their mortgage. For Black, Latino, and 
Asian homeowners, that number is one 
in six. One out of every five renters in 
this country is behind in their rent. 
For Latino renters, it is one in four. 
For African-American renters, it is one 
in three. 
Think about the daily stress that 
puts on people. They go to work every 
day. They are not paid enough. They 
are not sure they are safe at work. 
They come home, anxious about pass-
ing on this virus. They have to worry 
about paying their rent. They have to 
worry about food for their kids. They 
have to worry about whether the 
schools are open so kids can go there 
while they are trying to balance their 
workload. We have to do everything we 
can to alleviate that stress. 
A moratorium on evictions and on 
foreclosures helps keep people safe in 
the short-run, but there is simply not 
enough for all the people who are be-
hind with no way to catch up. Thank-
fully, we have had moratoriums on 
evictions. They haven’t always worked. 
They work most of the time. But every 
month that moratorium stops you 
from being evicted is another month 
that you owe rent when the time 
comes. We know that. 
Economists estimated that renters 
already owed $57 billion in back rent by 
the end of January. That is twice the 
aid we provided for renters in Decem-
ber. So the package that most of us 
voted for helped a lot in December, but 
it is clearly not enough. That is why 
President Biden, the Senate, and the 
House have to go big. How could we let 
millions of families lose the homes 
they love or get trapped in a downward 
spiral of debt, all because of a virus far 
beyond any one person’s control? 
So I ask my colleagues of both par-
ties—I just ask this: What do we do? 
Let’s get this done. There is no time 
for quibbling over Senate procedure. 
Working families don’t care about Sen-
ate rules. They care about when they 
get a vaccine. They care about when 
their kids get back to school. They 
care about keeping their jobs. They 
don’t care how we get it done. They 
care about results. 
The Senate has used these fast-track 
budget measures over and over in times 
far less dire than the ones we face now. 
Minority Leader MCCONNELL
had no 
problem using these fast-track proce-
dures that they now oppose to pour 
money into corporations’ coffers with 
their tax cuts. 
In fact, the last time—I was at the 
White House today with President 
Biden. The last time I was invited to 
the White House was President Trump 
inviting a group of us on the tax-writ-
ing committee to try to sell his big tax 
giveaway to corporate America and to 
the richest people in the country. We 
sat around the table in the President’s 
Cabinet Room with two, I believe, of 
his billionaire Cabinet members who 
benefited handsomely, as did his fam-
ily, from this tax cut. It was a big, big 
giveaway to the largest corporations in 
this country and a big, big giveaway to 
billionaires and the richest people in 
the country but so little for the econ-
omy and so little for workers. 
So Senator MCCONNELL, whose office, 
we know, is just down the hall—you 
often see lobbyists lining up. Back in 
the tax-cutting days, you saw lobbyists 
lined up out there outside his office 
waiting to get in to find out what tax 
break they could get. That was then. 
We used this fast-track procedure to 
get it done as if it were an emergency. 
Now it actually is an emergency. We 
just can’t wait and negotiate and nego-
tiate and negotiate and take forever to 
get this help. 
You know, someone came to our 
Banking and Housing Committee and 
said: You know, before D-day, they 
didn’t have a meeting at the White 
House and with the Congress saying: 
Can we afford this? Can we afford this 
war? Can we afford equipping our 
troops in Normandy? 
Of course we could because we had to 
win the war. We are in a global crisis 
now. It is a war. We marshaled all of 
our vast resources and talents to rise 
to beat the global crisis in World War 
II. Then we grew the economy from the 
middle class out. We paid down the 
debt with rising wages. 
Americans elected new leaders now— 
last 
November—because 
they 
were 
tired of a President and a majority 
leader who refused to treat this war 
against COVID with the same urgency. 
People are really sick and tired all 
over this country. They are sick and 
tired in Dayton and Akron and Canton 
and Mansfield of a President—of people 
or a President saying or then-Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL saying: We can’t do 
it. We can’t afford it. We have done 
enough. 
Let’s aim higher. Let’s deliver for the 
people we serve. Let’s raise the stim-
ulus checks to $2,000—money that will 
make a difference for so many families. 
Let’s cut taxes for working families. 
Let’s keep people in their homes. Let’s 
keep small businesses open. Let’s give 
every American a vaccine—a vaccine 
that will save their lives. That is the 
decision before this Senate. 
Do we just say ‘‘We can’t do very 
much. We ought to wait a while. Let’s 
see if the last thing worked’’? Let’s 
come together. Let’s pass this. Let’s 
make a real difference in the American 
people’s lives.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The

OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
S. CON. RES. 5 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of the budget res-
olution and the American rescue plan 
proposed by President Biden. It is, 
without question, a necessary next step 
in our fight against the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Just last month, roughly 100,000 
Americans lost their lives to COVID. 
To date, we have lost more than 430,000 
Americans to this virus. Included in 
this 
number 
is 
over 
15,000 
Michiganders. Millions of Americans 
have become sick as a result of this 
deadly virus, and far too many people 
in Michigan and across the country are 
suffering from the unprecedented eco-
nomic crisis that this pandemic has 
caused. Families are struggling to put 
food on the table and to put a roof over 
their heads and just to pay bills. 
The relief package that was passed in 
December provided important emer-
gency relief, but it didn’t go nearly far 
enough. I had the honor of meeting 
with President Biden and Vice Presi-
dent Harris today at the White House 
to discuss the need to work together 
and to act boldly and quickly to deliver 
urgently needed support. 
More than 120 economists are press-
ing Congress to pass the sweeping relief 
package, and the danger is not going 
big but rather failing to meet the ur-
gency of the moment. These 120 econo-
mists wrote: ‘‘History shows that what

S299 
February 3, 2021 
our nation cannot afford is inaction or 
timidity in the face of what many con-
sider to be the greatest economic dis-
aster since the Great Depression.’’ 
It is clear to me that we must extend 
unemployment benefits to those who 
are out of work through no fault of 
their own. We must pass an additional 
$1,400 in stimulus payments to individ-
uals. We must provide more food assist-
ance to ensure that no child or family 
goes hungry because of this crisis, and 
we must ensure small businesses can 
stay afloat. 
We must provide more funding to 
speed up the distribution of vaccines so 
that we can get more vaccines in the 
arms of Americans quickly, safely, and 
equitably. And we must provide more 
resources so that schools can reopen 
safely under the guidance of public 
health officials and experts. 
We must deliver relief to commu-
nities on the frontlines of COVID-re-
sponse efforts and make sure that they 
are not forced to cut essential services 
for residents or lay off health profes-
sionals or teachers or firefighters or 
law enforcement officials. We must re-
plenish the disaster relief fund, which 
will help give our cash-strapped State 
and local governments the resources 
they need to pay for personal protec-
tion equipment, aid in vaccine dis-
tribution, and provide additional sup-
port services to communities strug-
gling with overwhelming coronavirus 
cases. 
We must provide funding to ensure 
there is strong oversight of how Fed-
eral taxpayer dollars are actually being 
spent on Federal COVID efforts, ensur-
ing that resources and support that 
Congress has authorized is actually 
reaching the people who need it the 
most. 
One of my top priorities and an issue 
I 
hear 
about 
every 
day 
from 
Michiganders is the need to extend un-
employment benefits. Over 3 million 
Michiganders have claimed unemploy-
ment insurance since the start of this 
pandemic. That is around one-third of 
the entire population of Michigan. And, 
unfortunately, we are not out of the 
tunnel yet. Over half a million of these 
claims are still active. 
It is not just impacting one part of 
my State. All 83 Michigan counties are 
experiencing higher levels of jobless-
ness, a disturbing trend that we have 
seen 
continue 
into 
this 
year. 
Michiganders want to work, they want 
to keep their families safe, and they 
want to put food on the table. In order 
to do all of this, we must first get this 
pandemic under control, while helping 
families and workers make ends meet. 
They need and must have our contin-
ued help and our support. 
As the Biden American Rescue Plan 
recognizes, Federal unemployment as-
sistance programs are essential to bol-
stering our State programs, and while 
1.9 million unemployment claims in 
Michigan 
during 
2020 
have 
flowed 
through the State unemployment pro-
gram, nearly just as many claims, 1.7 
million, were made possible by the 
Federal Pandemic Unemployment As-
sistance Program. It is a program that 
I helped to establish last year in the 
CARES Act. 
Pandemic Unemployment Assistance 
is a lifeline to workers who are self-em-
ployed yet had their source of income 
interrupted by the pandemic, including 
gig workers and freelance workers and 
small business owners. 
I certainly agree with President 
Biden that we must continue Federal 
unemployment 
assistance 
programs 
through September of 2021. Imple-
menting this rescue package means we 
will not abandon millions of workers 
who otherwise would be ineligible for 
assistance or whose benefits would 
have long run out. It would also mean 
that the level of benefit that they re-
ceive is closer to the amount necessary 
for their families to have some meas-
ure of financial stability. 
In Michigan, far too many families 
are finding it difficult to feed them-
selves and their children. Michigan had 
the sixth highest rate of projected food 
insecurity in 2020. Nearly 2 million in-
dividuals lived in food-insecure house-
holds. That means each day almost one 
in five Michiganders worries about 
whether or not they or their loved ones 
are going to get enough to eat that 
day. 
The number of Michiganders strug-
gling with hunger has increased by 
around 600,000 since the start of the 
pandemic, and, sadly, most of this has 
been as a result of an uptick in child 
hunger. 
Our food banks across Michigan are 
doing all they can to step up to the 
challenge, but they are experiencing 
unprecedented surges in demand as 
more families seek assistance. Food as-
sistance is one of the top reasons peo-
ple contact my State’s emergency hot-
line. The Federal Government must do 
more in providing food assistance to 
these families. 
The American Rescue Plan will ex-
tend the 15-percent Supplemental Nu-
trition Assistance Program, or SNAP, 
benefit, while maintaining an increase 
through 
the 
coming 
months 
and 
through the summer, a time when 
childhood hunger is at its highest level 
due to the lack of school meals. It is a 
critical backstop against rising food 
insecurity, and this change will help 
keep hunger at bay for around 40 mil-
lion Americans. 
The rescue plan also supports these 
efforts by providing a one-time emer-
gency infusion of support for State 
anti-hunger and nutrition programs. 
This will ensure that benefits quickly 
and efficiently get to children and to 
those families that are in need. 
According to the nonprofit No Kid 
Hungry campaign, this funding will 
amount to around $25 more per person 
per month for those who are currently 
struggling. A family of four will get an 
extra $100 a month. This is an invest-
ment we must certainly make. 
The proposal before us will also in-
vest $3 billion to help women, infants, 
and children get the food they need. 
This multiyear investment in the Spe-
cial Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children, 
known as WIC, is needed to account for 
increased enrollment due to growing 
hunger and to increase outreach to en-
sure that low-income families have ac-
cess to high-quality nutritious food 
and nutritional education. 
During this dark, challenging winter, 
we must address the hunger crisis in 
Michigan and across the country. 
Another issue that I hear about con-
stantly from Michiganders is the addi-
tional support we must provide to our 
small businesses. Many small busi-
nesses—the very backbone of Michi-
gan’s economy and the economic driver 
in many of our local communities— 
have been forced to shutter or are just 
barely hanging on. 
Nationally, small business revenue is 
down 32 percent, and at least 400,000 
firms have permanently closed. Minor-
ity-owned small businesses and those 
in hard-hit industries, like restaurants 
and hotels and entertainment, have 
suffered disproportionately. 
Whether it is a boutique in Plym-
outh, a family-owned farm in Michi-
gan’s fruit belt, or a restaurant in De-
troit, these small businesses bring our 
State character, community, and a 
sense of place. 
Congress must do everything we can 
to assist our small businesses, and we 
must ensure that COVID–19 small busi-
ness relief assistance is clearly admin-
istered and is easy to access. That is 
why I fought for a vital increase in 
small business funding, like the Pay-
check Protection Program, which was 
included in the CARES Act and subse-
quent legislation that I was proud to 
help pass. 
In Michigan, over 128,000 Paycheck 
Protection Program loans were ap-
proved before the program first ex-
pired, totaling over $16 billion in fund-
ing. And although the PPP brought 
hope to many during this crisis, it 
alone was simply not enough. We must 
continue to expand access to small 
business grants and loans for our 
Michigan businesses. 
The American Rescue Plan is ambi-
tious, but it is achievable and will help 
our small businesses survive and help 
rescue the American economy as we 
work to recover. It will support com-
munities that are struggling in the 
wake of COVID–19 by providing support 
for the hardest hit small businesses, es-
pecially small businesses owned by en-
trepreneurs of color, and protecting 
jobs of the first responders and transit 
workers and other essential workers 
whom we depend on each and every 
day. 
It will provide grants to more than 1 
million of the hardest hit small busi-
nesses—flexible, equitably distributed 
grants that will help small businesses 
get back on their feet and put the cur-
rent disaster behind them. Addition-
ally, it will leverage government funds 
into additional small business lending 
and investment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S300 
February 3, 2021 
By investing in successful State, 
local, Tribal, and nonprofit small busi-
ness financing programs, Congress will 
exponentially 
generate 
low-interest 
loans and venture capital to help our 
small businesses survive, to create and 
maintain jobs, and to continue to pro-
vide the essential goods and services 
that our communities depend on. 
According to an independent analysis 
conducted by Moody’s Analytics, the 
American Rescue Plan will help create 
7.5 million jobs in 2021, double eco-
nomic growth, and return the United 
States to full employment a full year 
faster. Small businesses in Michigan 
and across the country need this help, 
and they need it now. 
Passing the American Rescue Plan 
will help us get through this economic 
crisis and come out stronger on the 
other side. And I know we all look for-
ward to the day when we can visit our 
small businesses. 
I 
know 
I 
am 
excited 
to 
see 
Michiganders going out to eat in 
Greektown before visiting Comerica 
Park. They will stroll through down-
towns like Birmingham and Grand 
Rapids. They will drive up north and 
spend time in small businesses in Tra-
verse City and Marquette, and just 
maybe swing by a local brewery, or 
enjoy boating on one of our beautiful 
Great Lakes. I will never stop fighting 
to make sure that when the day comes, 
Michigan’s small businesses will be up 
and running. 
But as we address the economic im-
pact to this pandemic, we must also 
use this relief package to address the 
public health crisis. 
Since the outset of the pandemic, 
FEMA has stepped up to assist in re-
sponse to the COVID–19 crisis by co-
ordinating medical supply acquisition 
and distribution and assisting State 
and local governments with funds for 
response activity, such as overtime pay 
for public health officials. And now 
FEMA is taking on an even larger role 
as we continue this critical phase of re-
sponse, which is vaccine distribution. 
When I spoke to the President and 
Vice President earlier today, I was 
pleased to hear their vision for using 
FEMA resources and expertise to pro-
vide essential staff, supplies, transpor-
tation, and other resources necessary 
to ensure that every vaccine dose is ac-
tually reaching the arm of an Amer-
ican. 
These activities are all supported 
through FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, 
and we must provide the funding need-
ed to ensure that FEMA can have the 
maximum flexibility to help our State 
and local governments and resources 
needed to deploy COVID–19 vaccines to 
combat this pandemic. 
There are so many faces that have 
been on the frontlines of responding to 
this unprecedented public health crisis: 
our healthcare workers, delivery work-
ers, grocery store employees, and so 
many others who have sacrificed so 
that we can have the care, the goods, 
and the services that we need to get by. 
Essential workers include our dedi-
cated civil servants who work tire-
lessly to serve the American people in 
countless ways—from providing med-
ical care to delivering our mail, to 
safeguarding our national security. We 
truly appreciate their continued serv-
ice under incredibly challenging cir-
cumstances. 
To help ensure the health and safety 
of Federal employees and their commu-
nities, we must provide funding to the 
Emergency Federal Employee Leave 
Fund. This fund offers emergency paid 
leave, which ensures workers can stay 
at home if they are feeling ill, and, by 
doing so, prevent community spread of 
COVID–19. 
This provision will also provide much 
needed flexibility to our civil servants 
and their families as they juggle 
caregiving for children and other fam-
ily members with their remote public 
service work. 
Our Nation’s postal workers, who 
work tirelessly to deliver prescription 
drugs, essential goods, and even our 
holiday gifts throughout the pandemic, 
are facing unique challenges. Federal 
employees who interact directly with 
the public, like our hard-working post-
al employees and letter carriers, need 
better access to workers’ compensation 
benefits if they contract COVID–19 in 
the line of duty. 
The effectiveness of our ongoing re-
sponse to this pandemic depends on our 
career Federal workforce, and these 
two policies are an important step in 
ensuring the safety of civil servants, 
their families, and their communities. 
Finally, we need robust oversight to 
make sure relief dollars are spent ap-
propriately and are going to families, 
small businesses, hospitals, and the 
communities that need them most. 
When 
this 
body 
considered 
the 
CARES Act, I worked across the aisle 
with Senator JOHNSON and the House to 
create two oversight mechanisms to 
provide 
transparency 
and 
account-
ability to the American people. 
First, we created the Pandemic Re-
sponse Accountability Committee, or 
PRAC. The PRAC is a new entity made 
up of new inspectors general—inde-
pendent 
industry 
watchdogs—and 
charged with overseeing the entire 
Federal Government coronavirus re-
sponse and all of the associated spend-
ing. We also charged the Government 
Accountability 
Office—Congress’s 
watchdog—to conduct similarly wide- 
ranging oversight. 
In just 10 months, these oversight 
bodies have published reports on issues 
ranging from vaccine development to 
the Paycheck Protection Program, and 
the PRAC has established a website 
where anyone can go and see exactly 
where their hard-earned tax dollars are 
going. 
We must continue to support both 
the PRAC and the GAO so they can 
continue this critical work, keeping 
Congress and the American people in-
formed, ensuring taxpayer dollars are 
used responsibly, and helping to re-
store public trust in our Federal Gov-
ernment during this coronavirus re-
sponse. 
So it is clear, we are facing a crisis 
unlike any other in our Nation’s his-
tory. We must work together to pass 
robust and bold COVID relief package. 
Michiganders and the American people 
are counting on us to do the right 
thing, and it is now our time to deliver. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. CON. RES. 5 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
will take this time, as the incoming 
chairman of the Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship Committee, to just 
go over with our colleagues the impor-
tance of this budget resolution as it re-
lates to the small business community. 
I think Members of this Chamber 
know that small businesses represent 
the growth engine of America. That is 
where job creation occurs at the great-
est numbers. Almost half of the jobs in 
America are in small companies. Just 
as importantly, when we look for inno-
vation, we see innovation in small 
businesses. They are the ones that fig-
ure out how to do things more effi-
ciently and better, and that has also 
been true during COVID–19. 
As we have seen small businesses 
around the Nation struggle, we have 
seen how creativity among small busi-
ness has saved so many small busi-
nesses in America, where they figure 
out a better way to deal with the food 
service because they can’t have in-res-
taurant service, in how they have dealt 
with the service industries generally, 
in how they have dealt with retail 
sales, safety with COVID–19 and deliv-
ery and internet. They have come up 
with better ways to do things, and that 
is why our economy is performing at 
the level it is—not the level we want it 
to be—because small businesses have 
figured out ways to do things better. 
But there is another characteristic of 
small business I think we all under-
stand. They don’t have the same degree 
of resiliency. They don’t have the deep 
pockets. They don’t have the outside 
financiers. So they don’t have the big 
reserves. So when we hit a bump in our 
economy, small businesses really suf-
fer. 
In every economic downturn, we 
know that small businesses are going 
to do worse than larger companies, and 
during this pandemic, it was particu-
larly important for us to respond to 
help our small businesses so that when 
we get out of this pandemic, when our 
economy returns, the small business 
community is healthy and our econ-
omy can continue to grow.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S301 
February 3, 2021 
This has been made even more chal-
lenging because we have imposed re-
strictions, as government, on the oper-
ations 
of 
small 
businesses 
during 
COVID–19. We have told restaurants 
they couldn’t serve in-restaurant. We 
limited the number of people who can 
gather. All that has affected the eco-
nomic strength of small businesses in 
America. 
So Congress has responded. We have 
responded. We need to do more. Our 
first major response was in the CARES 
Act. Let me remind the Presiding Offi-
cer and the Senate and all that that 
bill was passed in mid-March. It was a 
bipartisan bill, and it was bold. It was 
a major effort to deal with the pan-
demic as we understood it in March of 
last year. 
So we recognized that the first thing 
we had to do if we were going to help 
rebuild our economy, if we were going 
to help small businesses, the very first 
thing we had to do was get the virus 
under control. That is why the CARES 
Act in March had what we called the 
Marshall Plan for healthcare, to put 
money into the development of a vac-
cine, to put money into protective 
equipment, to put money into testing, 
to put money into public health—be-
cause we recognized that, yes, we have 
a responsibility as the Federal Govern-
ment to control this pandemic, and by 
the way, it will also help our economic 
recovery because we knew that con-
sumers could not go out until the 
virus—in 
right 
numbers—until 
the 
virus was under control. 
But we also knew we had to do things 
for small businesses directly, and we 
acted in a bold manner. We passed the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program, 
the 
PPP program, a new program. We did 
this in a bipartisan manner. We did it 
to keep employees on the payroll. 
We recognized at that time that, yes, 
you can lay off workers and they can 
collect unemployment, but wouldn’t it 
be better if we could keep them on the 
payroll? And the Paycheck Protection 
Program was an immediate influx of 
help for small businesses to keep their 
payrolls strong—and it worked—by 
these forgivable loans that, when used 
for that purpose, the entire loan could 
be forgiven. 
In mid-March when we passed this, 
we didn’t know the demand. We didn’t 
know how much would be needed, and 
we certainly thought that by some-
time, we hoped, during the summer of 
last year, the pandemic would have 
been behind us. Well, we were wrong on 
both accounts. There wasn’t enough 
money in the program, and we needed 
to recognize that more help was needed 
than what we just did in the CARES 
Act. So we replenished money, put 
more money into the PPP program. We 
made it more flexible for small busi-
nesses, recognizing that it was going to 
be a longer period of time during the 
pandemic. 
If you look at the numbers on how 
the Paycheck Protection Program has 
been used, through January of this 
year, 
6 
million 
loans—forgivable 
loans—6 million to the small business 
community, representing $595 billion of 
Federal help. That is a significant 
amount of funds. 
But we recognized last March and we 
have continued to realize that one size 
does not fit all for all small businesses, 
and where forgivable loans work for 
some small businesses, they don’t work 
for others. That is why we enhanced 
the Economic Injury Disaster Loan 
Program, the EIDL Program. The 
EIDL Program consists primarily of 
disaster loans that are given out dur-
ing natural disasters. 
The very first bill we passed after 
COVID–19, for the pandemic, was to 
make those who were suffering as a re-
sult of COVID–19—those businesses—el-
igible for EIDL loans. Normally it is 
natural disasters, but we included this 
pandemic. Now, why is that important? 
Well, yes, forgivable loans equal to 2 
months of your payroll, plus some ad-
ditional expenses, help keep your pay-
roll, but small businesses need addi-
tional capital beyond just covering 
their payroll and some rent expenses. 
So the EIDL Program provides much 
more flexible funds, a larger amount of 
money, so that small businesses can 
get through this economic downturn. It 
is low-interest, 30-year loans with very 
favorable repayment schedules. 
The good news about what we did in 
March is that we made the Paycheck 
Protection Program and the EIDL Pro-
gram—you could do both. So you could 
get the influx to help you with payroll, 
and you could get the longer term fi-
nancing. And the numbers are impres-
sive here. There were 3.7 million loans 
under the EIDL loan program; $200 bil-
lion in loans was given out under 
EIDL. But let me point out—as I said, 
one size does not fit all. Loans work for 
some businesses but not all. So we 
wanted to do a grant program for those 
small businesses that are intimidated 
by taking out a loan because they said 
they can’t even pay their existing 
loans; how could they take out more 
loans. 
So we started a new program, an 
EIDL Advance Program, that provided 
grants up to $10,000 for our most vul-
nerable small businesses. This was a 
lifesaver for so many small businesses. 
This Advance helped businesses get the 
resources, the immediate cash, without 
having to worry about an additional 
loan on their books. Quite frankly, this 
program, along with strengthening the 
existing tools that were very impor-
tant for small businesses, helped save a 
lot of small businesses. 
We also created a debt forgiveness 
program. For a certain number of 
months, we would forgive your current 
7a loan with the Small Business Ad-
ministration, or 504 loan. Not just the 
interest payments but the principal 
payments 
were 
forgiven. 
And 
we 
strengthened the Microloan Program, 
and we reinforced the Community Ad-
vantage 7a Programs. 
We did all that. We did this starting 
in mid-March with the hope that this 
pandemic would be over by last sum-
mer. We learned a lot from that bill 
after it passed. 
The lessons learned we need now de-
ploy in order to finish the job, to make 
sure small businesses are protected 
through this pandemic. So what were 
the lessons learned? Well, we first 
learned 
that 
the 
underserved 
and 
underbanked community had special 
needs. This is the minority commu-
nity. These are businesses located in 
low-income communities, businesses 
that don’t have traditional banking re-
lations with a commercial bank. They 
all, in the beginning part of the PPP 
program, were left behind. Why? Be-
cause in order to get the help under the 
PPP program, you had to find a com-
mercial lender who would make you 
the loan—100 percent guaranteed by 
the government, forgivable, so no real 
risk to the financial institution, but 
the financial institution wanted to pro-
tect their existing customers, and they 
wanted to make the larger loans be-
cause it was more lucrative for them. 
So the smaller of the small businesses 
and those that did not have a preferred 
relationship with bankers had a harder 
time getting that loan, and that 
showed up in the numbers we saw when 
the PPP program started last year. 
Now, it is interesting—Senator SHA-
HEEN and I recognized this as we were 
crafting the bill, so we put a provision 
in the CARES Act that said that the 
SBA needed to prioritize loans for un-
derserved small businesses. We knew 
that this was a likely thing to happen, 
so we asked the SBA to make a special 
effort to deal with the underserved 
community. They didn’t do it. The 
SBA IG, in its report, said that the 
SBA did not fully align to congres-
sional intent the way they imple-
mented the PPP as it relates to the un-
derserved community. 
It is interesting—a group of stake-
holders, of advocates on behalf of mi-
nority 
businesses, 
started 
what 
is 
known as the Page 30 Coalition. The 
provision I talked about was on page 30 
of the CARES Act. They have been ad-
vocating for change ever since. 
So starting with the replenishment 
of the PPP program and continuing in 
the omnibus bill we just passed in De-
cember, we have tried to build up the 
capacity for the underserved commu-
nities. We have done that by putting 
money aside for mission lenders. In the 
omnibus bill, there is $10 billion that 
was put aside to build up the capacity 
of CDFIs and minority repository insti-
tutions. I want to thank my colleague 
Senator MARK WARNER of Virginia for 
his efforts in putting that together. 
That provided greater capacity for mis-
sion lenders, who are more likely to 
help in the underserved communities, 
to be there with the capital necessary 
to participate in the SBA programs. 
We also decided that we had to do 
more than just that. We got set-asides 
for mission lenders in the act, and we 
had set-asides for the smaller of the 
small businesses because the smaller of

February 3, 2021 
the small businesses are the ones that 
had the greatest need. 
Lessons learned from what we did, 
and that was that the EIDL Program 
was not set up as Congress intended. 
When you look at the demographics as 
to what type of a company uses the 
EIDL Program as compared to the 
PPP, the smaller of small businesses, 
the more vulnerable small businesses, 
were more likely to use the EIDL Pro-
gram. 
So we anticipated, as I said, the 
EIDL Advance, which was so important 
to small businesses that really don’t 
believe they can take out a loan—we 
anticipated they would get $10,000. 
Guess what. The average grant size, as 
implemented by the Trump adminis-
tration, was between $4,000 and $5,000. 
The average size of the business that 
applied for an EIDL Advance was be-
tween four and five workers, the real 
‘‘ma and pa’’ businesses. But they 
needed more than $4,500; they needed 
$10,000. 
The EIDL loan program by statute 
could give you a loan up to $2 million, 
but the SBA, under the Trump admin-
istration, put a cap of $150,000 on those 
loans. Again, it compromised the effec-
tiveness of those programs. We need to 
learn from what we did. 
As I said earlier, more help is needed. 
The proposal that we are looking at in 
this budget resolution will provide that 
additional help, and that is why it is so 
important to pass this budget resolu-
tion. 
Let me just give you a few of the de-
tails of why it is important to move 
this budget resolution. First, as I said 
in the onset of my remarks, we have to 
get this virus under control. The budg-
et that is before us will provide sub-
stantial help for the vaccine distribu-
tions. 
I don’t know about what is happening 
in Minnesota, but I can tell you in 
Maryland, people are frustrated that 
we don’t have a more efficient system 
on the distribution of vaccines. We 
have to answer that. 
For the supply chain, use the Defense 
Production Act, use that in order to 
get the vaccine distribution done in a 
way that is fair to the American peo-
ple. The budget before us will help us 
achieve that. It will provide the money 
for testing and protective equipment, 
which is desperately needed to get the 
virus under control. 
The budget before us will allow us to 
open schools safely. We need that for 
American families. We need it for our 
children, and we need it for small busi-
nesses because when schools are closed 
and children have to stay home, our 
small businesses suffer. They suffer 
from their workers not being able to 
show up to work, and they suffer from 
the customers not being able to shop. 
But we also need direct help for small 
businesses. In this legislation, there is 
$50 billion allocated to the Small Busi-
ness Administration to deal with the 
hardest hit small businesses. 
Let me just mention where we need 
to put our attention: in the hospitality 
industry. We did that in the previous 
legislation. In the CARES Act, we 
made special provisions in regard to 
the affiliation rules for restaurants. 
That was the right thing to do. In the 
omnibus bill, we provided some addi-
tional help over and above other busi-
nesses under the Paycheck Protection 
Program’s second round, and that was 
right, but we need to do more. 
The National Restaurant Association 
has 
informed 
us 
that 
110,000 
res-
taurants have either closed tempo-
rarily or permanently as a result of 
COVID–19. There are 2.5 million less 
jobs in restaurants today than at the 
pre-COVID level. And at the worst 
point, we were down 8 million jobs in 
that industry through layoffs and fur-
loughs. So we need to take a look at a 
special way to help preserve our res-
taurants because they depend upon 
groups attending. They depend upon 
catering. They depend upon the res-
taurants being fully filled, and they 
can’t do that under COVID–19. So we 
need to provide some help, and this 
budget resolution will allow us to do 
that. 
In the omnibus bill, we provided 
money for shuttered venues. These are 
our entertainment venues, our muse-
ums which have been ordered to be 
closed. They can’t operate because of 
COVID–19 and government orders. 
I 
will 
give 
you 
one 
example: 
Merriweather Post Pavilion located in 
Howard County, not very far from here. 
One 
thousand 
jobs 
are 
impacted. 
Merriweather Post has not been able to 
have live entertainment since COVID– 
19 last March. 
We passed legislation to provide help. 
We need to improve that legislation, 
and the budget resolution before us 
will allow us to get that done. 
Let’s talk about nonprofits for one 
moment. Johns Hopkins University has 
told us we lost a million jobs in the 
nonprofit sector as a result of COVID– 
19. We have nonprofits that have not 
been eligible that should be eligible to 
get help under these packages, and this 
budget resolution gives us an oppor-
tunity to take care of that need. 
Then, lastly, let me talk about one of 
the priorities that President Biden has 
talked about, and that is getting the 
information out so small businesses 
can take advantage of these programs 
because so many have not taken advan-
tage. They are the most vulnerable. He 
has what he calls the community navi-
gators. We know from the Affordable 
Care Act how helpful they can be in 
getting information out, particularly 
in hard-served communities, so they 
understand the tools that are avail-
able. They can apply for the tools and 
get the help that they need. 
We build on the community naviga-
tors with our resource partners—our 
women business centers, our minority 
business centers. Let’s build on those 
centers—our veterans. Let’s build on 
our resource partners in order to make 
sure that the help really is targeted to 
the small businesses of greater need. 
This budget resolution is a bold ap-
proach because the problem is so great. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
budget resolution for so many reasons, 
but as the incoming chairman of the 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship 
Committee, on behalf of America’s 
small businesses, I urge my colleagues 
to support this budget resolution. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, it is 
good to see you in that Chair, and I am 
grateful for this opportunity. 
I just wanted to raise a couple of 
issues that are relevant to the budget 
resolution that we are going to be 
working on over the next few days and 
beyond. There are so many issues to 
highlight. I will only mention two 
issues—two big issues—but I think, 
most generally, when I consider what 
we should do, I think it is my belief 
that we need a substantial, robust bill 
to meet the moment that we are in. 
That means dealing with the pandemic 
effectively and putting the virus be-
hind us by accelerating vaccinations, 
making sure that we are taking every 
step possible to open our schools—to 
reopen schools, I should say, in some 
cases. 
Thirdly, to make sure we are helping 
those who are vulnerable, whether they 
are folks without a job or folks who are 
hungry or their families are hungry— 
so many other traumas that have been 
heaped upon our families. There is a lot 
to do, and that requires a substantial 
investment, not a limited investment. 
I will just mention two issues today. 
One is home and community-based 
services, and the other is childcare and 
a particular tax credit that is relevant. 
Home and community-based services, 
as many people know, have a huge im-
pact on both older citizens—seniors 
throughout the country—as well as 
people with disabilities and even has an 
impact upon children. I will focus most 
of the attention, for purposes of today, 
on the impact on seniors and people 
with disabilities. 
If there is ever a time when a care 
setting that is in the home or in a com-
munity was more beneficial to a senior, 
to a person with a disability—if there 
is ever a time, it is now. We know that 
if someone is living in a congregate 
setting, they are more likely to get the 
virus. And we know the horrific num-
bers. Just about 40 percent of the 
deaths that have occurred because of 
the pandemic in the United States have 
occurred in long-term care settings. It 
is, as of right now, at last count, ap-
proaching 150,000 Americans who lost 
their lives from the virus who were in 
long-term care settings. 
I think a lot of seniors—a lot of fam-
ily members would prefer, often, that 
their loved one is getting care in a 
home or in a community setting. The 
same is true, of course, for people with 
disabilities. 
We have a chance in this legislation 
to finally make an investment in home

and 
community-based 
services. 
Do 
those services exist right now? They 
do. How do they exist? Pretty much in 
the United States by way of a waiver, 
so it is not the standard policy; it is 
done by waiver. 
We want to make sure that it is more 
of a standard feature, really, a choice 
that people have to get the care in the 
community or in the setting that they 
want. It is critically important that we 
have in the reconciliation instructions 
a commitment to home and commu-
nity-based services. We have that now, 
and we want to make sure it remains 
in the bill in final form. 
The other benefit or, I should say, 
the other priority here is not simply 
those receiving the care in home and 
community-based settings; it is those 
providing the care, those heroic front-
line workers who often are not talked 
about enough who provide this care. 
Most of the care provided in these set-
tings 
are 
provided 
by 
low-income 
women of color who disproportionately 
make up the workforce and often are 
making about $12 an hour. They should 
have a decent wage. They should have 
benefits, like sick and family medical 
leave, and they should have access to 
PPE protection so that they have the 
protection they need to do their job 
and to care for those individuals.

er.

ORGANIZING RESOLUTION 
Madam President, in addition to the 
organizing resolution to which the Re-
publican leader and I have now agreed, 
Leader MCCONNELL and I would like to 
engage in a colloquy regarding certain 
understandings we have reached on two 
related issues. 
First, I have discussed with the Re-
publican leader concerns that have 
been raised by many Senators about 
the floor procedure known as ‘‘filling 
the 
amendment 
tree.’’ 
At 
various 
points over the last several decades, 
Senators have been prevented from ac-
tively participating in the legislative 
process because the ability of Senators 
to offer and receive votes on amend-
ments has been severely restricted. I 
appreciate and understand those con-
cerns, and I want to assure Senators 
that it is my intention to have active 
and dynamic debates on the many 
issues and crises facing our Nation 
today. The 117th Congress will not 
shirk from the important issues; rath-
er, we will discuss and debate legisla-
tive solutions to them. I am a strong 
supporter of the right of Senators to 
offer amendments and commit to in-
crease dramatically the number of 
Member-initiated amendments offered 
in the 117th Congress. I am also op-
posed to limiting amendments by ‘‘fill-
ing the tree’’ unless dilatory measures 
prevent the Senate from taking action 
and leave no alternative. Senators 
from both sides will be able to offer 
amendments. That is how we will oper-
ate in the 117th Congress under the new 
Democratic majority. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I appreciate these assurances from the 
majority leader. The right to offer 
amendments is important to Senators 
on our side as well, and we look for-
ward to full and vigorous debates, in-
cluding amendments, as the Senate 
takes up the many important issues be-
fore us. On a related note, I have dis-
cussed with the majority leader con-
cerns that have been raised about de-
bates on motions to proceed. I think 
many times cloture has to be filed on a 
motion to proceed because Members 
want to ensure they are given the right 
to offer amendments. Given the assur-
ances regarding the ability of Senators 
to debate and amend legislation in this 
Congress, that should help in alle-
viating that practice. Also, when we 
are proceeding to bills with broad bi-
partisan support, it is my hope that we 
will not need to have lengthy debates 
on motions to proceed. 
The resolution provides that the 
committee budgets and office space 
will be divided equally, subject to the 
customary set-aside for administrative 
expenses and nondesignated staff. It is 
our expectation that the details of 
those arrangements will be negotiated 
and agreed to by the respective chair 
and ranking member, in consultation 
with other members of each com-
mittee. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
thank the Republican leader for those 
assurances and for his cooperation in 
reaching agreement on the organizing 
resolution and the understandings we 
have just described. I look forward to 
working with him and all Senators to 
address the many urgent needs con-
fronting our Nation.

SETTING 
FORTH 
THE 
CONGRES-
SIONAL 
BUDGET 
FOR 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
GOVERNMENT 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
S. CON. RES. 5 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I will 
continue with the brief discussion 
about 
home 
and 
community-based 
services. 
It is so critical, as I mentioned ear-
lier, to have these services available 
for seniors and for people with disabil-
ities, and it is also relevant in the life 
of a child. We know—and as the Pre-
siding Officer knows well in her efforts 
to provide these services to those in 
the disability community and among 
seniors—that it is important to chil-
dren as well. Medicaid home and com-
munity-based services provide over $4 
billion right now in support so that 
children can receive therapy and other 
necessary services to participate in 
school, and as I mentioned earlier, we 
know the impact upon seniors and peo-
ple with disabilities. So that is the rea-
son we are emphasizing, among many 
reasons, the investment in this bill for 
home and community-based services in 
the context of the pandemic and the 
devastation of the virus and more 
broadly. 
The second issue I will raise—I know 
we are short on time—is an issue that 
I mentioned earlier. In addition to 
home and community-based services, 
this is an issue that relates to the fam-
ily’s ability to pay for childcare. So it 
affects the parents as well as the chil-
dren. It is the child and dependent care 
tax credit. Obviously, it is an existing 
tax credit, a credit that parents have 
been able to rely on, but it is nowhere 
near robust enough to make it possible 
for more parents to afford childcare. 
Here is the reality when it comes to 
what happens in the midst of this pan-
demic: We know that families have 
many reasons they can’t make ends 
meet, but, also, many families have 
members of their families who want to 
get back to work. We are told that 
about 20 percent of working adults say 
the reason they are not working is that 
COVID–19 has disrupted their childcare 
arrangements. So it is both a childcare 
access and affordability question. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics tells 
us that women accounted for all jobs 
lost in December of 2020—not most 
jobs, not some jobs. All jobs lost in the 
United States were among women. 
Women lost 156,000 jobs. Their labor 
force participation rate is at its lowest 
point in a third of a century. One of the 
big reasons is childcare. We need to ex-
pand the child and dependent care tax 
credit to give parents the ability to re-
coup 
thousands—not 
hundreds 
but 
thousands—of dollars in childcare ex-
penses. 
That is what my legislation will do. 
That is what the new administration 
wants to do, and that is what we should 
do in this next COVID bill, and there 
are a lot of reasons for it. 
I will end with this. Last year, the 
National Academy of Sciences released 
a roadmap to reduce child poverty. We 
have heard of the good provisions in 
this legislation on the child tax credit 
and the earned income tax credit and 
of the substantial impacts they have 
had on lowering child poverty—one es-
timate, by half. 
Also contributing to this and to 
lower child poverty even more would be 
to enhance the child and dependent 
care tax credit. Here are the numbers: 
9.2, 9.2, and 518. What do I mean? The 
National Academy of Sciences says 
that, if you have a robust child and de-
pendent care tax credit, you can reduce 
child poverty by 9.2 percent. Guess 
what happens to wages. There are 
raised aggregate earnings across the 
country also by 9.2, but it just happens 
to be billions—$9.2 billion. Then the 518 
refers to the jobs—increased net em-
ployment by more than 518,000 jobs ac-
cording to the National Academy of 
Sciences. 
So, among the many, many things we 
are doing in this bill, we need to invest 
in home and community-based services 
and also invest in a much more robust 
child and dependent care tax credit. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 75 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 75 and 
that the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. Further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object, this 
measure, essentially, is a pretextual, 
ideological, and extreme step that real-
ly detracts from what should be our 
primary purpose at this moment in our 
history. 
Literally, we are fast approaching 
450,000 deaths in this country, and peo-
ple continue to die at the rate of more 
than 3,000 per day. Our economic 
progress continues to be stalled. In 
fact, it is declining, with joblessness 
increasing across Connecticut and the 
country. People are struggling to stay 
in their homes, put food on their ta-
bles, and pay for the medicine they 
need. Our goal should be making sure 
people have vaccines and the economic 
support that they need. Instead, we are 
here on a measure that would, essen-
tially, take away rights, burden rights, 
for 
people—women—who 
need 
that 
right. 
We ought to be focusing our energy 
and attention on winning our fight 
against this pandemic, but, instead, we 
are here, debating a pretextual and ide-
ological bill, another anti-choice bill— 
yet another attempt to restrict a wom-
an’s right to choose about when and 
whether to have a child. This bill pur-
ports to be about protecting individ-
uals with Down syndrome, but it is 
merely 
a 
pretext 
for 
requiring 
healthcare 
providers 
to 
scrutinize 
women for their decisions to seek an 
abortion. The pretext is to take away 
those individual rights. 
As a matter of fact, this bill has 
nothing to do with protecting people 
with Down syndrome, and it has noth-
ing to do with addressing discrimina-
tion. If my colleague would like to 
genuinely help people with Down syn-
drome, he would ask for unanimous 
consent on legislation that the dis-
ability community actually has sup-
ported. The National Down Syndrome 
Society wants increased funding for 
medical research at the National Insti-
tutes of Health. It wants better edu-
cational opportunities and settings for 
people with Down syndrome. It wants 
laws and policies that ensure economic 
self-sufficiency and better workplaces 
and a fight against discrimination. 
Those are the legislative priorities of 
this disability community, but what 
this bill actually does is it essentially 
requires healthcare providers to inter-
rogate women about their decisions to 
seek an abortion. Healthcare providers 
who might violate this bill, if it ever 
became law, would incur fines, impris-
onment, or both. 
In conclusion, people have a right to 
make these kinds of deeply personal 
decisions. Those rights are protected 
under our Constitution. We should be 
protecting people with Down 
syn-
drome, and we should be expanding 
their opportunities and fighting dis-
crimination, not using them as a pre-
text for restricting and burdening a 
woman’s right to choose. 
Therefore, I object.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S305 
February 3, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I 
have a hard time with that, I say to my 
friend from Connecticut. 
Somehow, in protecting those with 
Down syndrome, you are killing those 
with Down syndrome. 
Right now, I am really shocked that 
people would talk about protecting 
children. The previous speaker was 
from Pennsylvania. He had a bill on 
childcare and taking care of kids. Yet 
now we are talking about the fact that 
a baby, in having been diagnosed with 
having 
Down 
syndrome, 
somehow 
should be aborted. I can’t think of how 
anyone could oppose this bill, espe-
cially because the American people 
overwhelmingly—70 percent of them— 
oppose aborting a child on the basis 
that the child would be born with Down 
syndrome. That includes 56 percent of 
the people who consider themselves to 
be pro-abortion people. Fifty-six per-
cent of the people who support abor-
tion oppose this on the basis of a Down 
syndrome diagnosis. 
In the United States, over two-thirds 
of the unborn babies diagnosed with 
Down syndrome are aborted right now. 
Why? Instead of receiving information, 
resources, and support, mothers often 
resort to feeling pressure to abort. 
Justice Clarence Thomas put it a lit-
tle bit more directly. He said: ‘‘I am 
deeply concerned that for babies with 
Down syndrome, abortion has become 
‘a tool of modern day eugenics.’ ’’ That 
was from a U.S. Supreme Court Jus-
tice. 
My bill would protect these innocent 
lives from systematic discrimination 
through abortion. We say that we sup-
port equality in the United States. Yet 
countless babies’ lives have been stolen 
because of their chromosome counts. 
So I am surprised that my colleagues 
can object to this commonsense bill 
and that they reject protecting the 
most vulnerable among us, and, cer-
tainly, those who are born with Down 
syndrome are among the most vulner-
able among us. 
I just want the people to know out 
there, our friends in the Down syn-
drome community—and there is a com-
munity—that a lot of people are con-
cerned about this. I am going to keep 
fighting for you even though some are 
using any kind of excuse that they can 
think of from protecting these babies. 
Before I yield the floor, I will respond 
to any comments from the Senator 
from Connecticut. 
Hearing none, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 137 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, the 
whole point of American foreign aid is 
to assist countries in times of need and 
in support of a common interest be-
tween us and them. Yet, for many 
years, our foreign aid dollars have been 
used to impose violent, cultural impe-
rialism by promoting and providing for 
the practice of abortion. 
Tragically, instead of helping to pre-
serve, strengthen, and sustain the lives 
of women and children abroad, our tax-
payer dollars have been used to harm 
women’s lives and to end the lives of 
their unborn children, especially baby 
girls. 
In some of these countries, girls are 
disproportionately aborted, precisely 
because they are female. U.S. aid is 
used not to affirm the equal dignity of 
girls and women but to violently deny 
it. And in some of these countries, 
abortion has been forced on women 
who don’t even want abortions—women 
in countries like Vietnam or Peru, for 
instance, who were forced to endure 
the coercive abortion and sterilization 
campaigns of the 1990s, just to name a 
few examples. 
What kind of aid does violence to 
women and girls? What kind of help is 
it to impose U.S. abortion extremism 
on countries that culturally and demo-
cratically reject it or contribute to 
international organizations that allow 
regimes to use abortion as a tool of op-
pression? And what kind of progress is 
it to encourage sex-selective abortion 
and the denigration of human dignity 
for both the baby and the mother? 
This cultural imperialism is not pro- 
woman. It is not pro-child. And it is 
not pro-healthcare. It is pro-sexism and 
pro-violence, and we must end it. 
According to the latest Marist poll, 
the American people overwhelmingly 
agree. Nearly 60 percent of Americans 
oppose using tax dollars to pay for 
abortions, and more than 75 percent of 
Americans oppose using tax dollars to 
support abortions in other countries— 
75 percent. 
Now, thankfully, President Ronald 
Reagan first took steps to reverse this 
kind of support in 1984, instituting 
what became known as the Mexico City 
policy to prohibit foreign aid from 
going to organizations that provide for 
or promote abortions or that advocate 
to change abortion laws within a for-
eign country. 
Since then, the policy has, unfortu-
nately, been rescinded and reinstated 
again and again between changing ad-
ministrations. 
Between 
Republicans 
and Democrats, it has been moved as a 
sort of political football. 
But the lives of babies and the dig-
nity of women—these are not political 
footballs. Women and children every-
where have immeasurable, innate, in-
herent dignity and worth, regardless of 
where they are from, and they ought to 
be entitled to the right to life and pro-
tection from harm, regardless of who 
happens to be in office at any given 
moment. 
The Protecting Life in Foreign As-
sistance Act affirms this very truth. 
This bill would permanently stop the 
use of our foreign aid money from fund-
ing or promoting abortions overseas. 
I also defend the women and babies 
everywhere and value the women and 
babies everywhere by supporting two 
other 
measures 
introduced 
by 
my 
friends Senator INHOFE
and Senator 
BLACKBURN. Senator INHOFE’s bill, the 
Protecting Individuals with Down Syn-
drome Act, would affirm that disability 
does not determine or demean the dig-
nity and worth of a human life. And 
Senator BLACKBURN’s bill would ensure 
that taxpayer funds under the Title X 
Family Planning Program do not go to 
any facility that performs or provides 
referrals for abortions. 
In our laws and throughout our lives, 
we ought to uphold the dignity of each 
and every human person, regardless of 
the race, sex, appearance, abilities, or 
age of the person in question. The 
measures before us today do just that, 
and we should support them. 
And now I would like to yield time to 
my friend and distinguished colleague, 
the Senator from Montana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague from 
Utah, Senator MIKE LEE, for his re-
marks. 
Last week, with the stroke of a pen, 
President Biden eliminated critical 
pro-life protections. He reversed the 
Mexico City policy and began the proc-
ess of dismantling title X protections 
against abortion. 
I am glad to join Senator LEE, Sen-
ator BLACKBURN, along with several 
other pro-life Senators fighting back 
and calling on the Senate to pass the 
important bills today to reverse Presi-
dent Biden’s pro-abortion actions. 
The bottom line is, President Biden’s 
actions were basically a handout to 
Planned Parenthood. It is no surprise, 
as Planned Parenthood spent millions 
to get the President elected. Now they 
are simply cashing in—this time, on 
the taxpayer’s dime. 
The United States should not spend 
taxpayer dollars to support a radical 
abortion agenda throughout the world, 
and we should absolutely not allow a 
slush fund of taxpayer dollars to line 
the pockets of Planned Parenthood. 
I also want to thank my colleague 
Senator INHOFE, who urged the Senate 
to pass his bill today to protect babies 
with Down syndrome from being tar-
geted for abortion. 
Now, I watched what happened here 
just minutes ago. The Democrats ob-
jected. It is truly astounding. This bill 
should have passed unanimously, and it 
really exposes a terrible hypocrisy. 
Most Republicans and Democrats 
today in Congress are unified in sup-
port for the Special Olympics. We are 
unified in supporting protecting those 
individuals with disabilities. Yet my 
colleagues across the aisle today op-
posed this commonsense legislation 
that would stop the most lethal kind of 
discrimination—the most lethal kind 
of discrimination imaginable—and that 
is being singled out and brutally killed 
simply because of a Down syndrome di-
agnosis. 
Last week, I stood right here to bring 
attention to this very chilling issue. 
Today, babies with Down syndrome are 
the most endangered on Earth. In fact,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S306 
February 3, 2021 
sadly, in the United States, 67 percent 
of babies diagnosed with Down syn-
drome are aborted. That is two out of 
three. 
And, for me, this is personal. Last 
week, I shared the story of a sweet 
baby boy named Andrew. He is the son 
of some of my very good friends. An-
drew has Down’s. He brings light and 
joy to his family’s life every day. He 
has an older brother, an older sister. I 
can tell you, this world, their family 
would not be the same without him. 
I am deeply concerned that for babies 
with Down syndrome, abortion has be-
come a tool of eugenics. It is the duty 
of this body to end this lethal discrimi-
nation. It is our duty to protect every 
innocent life, no matter how small, no 
matter how many chromosomes they 
may have. 
I believe every human being is cre-
ated with God-given dignity and God- 
given protection. No court, no legisla-
ture, no law can take that away. 
I will not give up this fight, and I 
know many of my colleagues standing 
here today will not give up as well. 
I want to thank Senator LEE. 
I yield the floor back to Senator LEE. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 137 and that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration. I further 
ask that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, 
my colleague from Utah tells a nice 
story, but it is not accurate. He is not 
being honest about what is going on 
with the global gag rule, and I am real-
ly disappointed that he is once again 
trying to push this dangerous legisla-
tion. 
As I pointed out when I objected to 
the same bill less than a year ago, the 
policy in question closes health clinics, 
decreases care, and needlessly puts the 
lives of women, children, and families 
at risk. In fact, instead of protecting 
life, the global gag rule erects new bar-
riers to critical health services, includ-
ing reproductive health services for 
people and communities that already 
have limited access to affordable, qual-
ity healthcare. 
And let’s be clear: America’s tax-
payer dollars do not go to fund abor-
tions overseas. 
What my colleague is objecting to is 
funding for family planning services to 
help women protect their families. And 
the policy that he wants to codify into 
law is dangerous in the best of times, 
but during a global pandemic, when 
care is already stretched, it is down-
right deadly. 
The Guttmacher Institute estimates 
that a 10-percent—just a 10-percent de-
cline in family planning services, in-
cluding reduced access to reversible 
contraception and pregnancy and new-
born healthcare, results in 49 million 
more women with unmet contraceptive 
needs; 15 million additional unintended 
pregnancies; 1.7 million women and 2.6 
million newborns who will experience 
major complications due to not receiv-
ing the care they need; and most unfor-
tunate and sad, 28,000 more maternal 
deaths and 168,000 more newborn deaths 
because of this policy. And that is just 
a modest 10-percent reduction in fam-
ily planning access. 
So if you really care about families 
and newborns, you will ensure that 
they have access to the critical serv-
ices that they need so they don’t have 
those unintended pregnancies. 
It is safe to say that the COVID–19 
pandemic, which has diverted care and 
shut down access to family planning 
clinics across the globe, is greatly ex-
acerbating the situation. So now is not 
the time to place draconian limits on 
family planning dollars. 
In fact, we need a renewed commit-
ment to comprehensive family plan-
ning. That is why last week, along with 
47 of our colleagues, we reintroduced 
the bipartisan Global Health Empower-
ment and Rights Act. The bill, also 
known as Global HER, would ensure 
that care is not limited based on the 
President in the White House because 
if we are going to actually get serious 
about improving the lives of women 
and girls, we should be working to end 
the global gag rule, not to expand it. 
So for all of these reasons, I object to 
my colleague’s request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, 75 per-
cent of Americans, regardless of how 
they feel on other issues—I understand 
my colleagues take different positions 
on issues related to the sanctity of 
human life. I understand that. As much 
as I disagree with them, I respect that 
it is their right to hold that opinion. 
This bill is about something much 
narrower, something upon which Amer-
icans—75 percent of them—overwhelm-
ingly agree, and that is that we 
shouldn’t be using U.S. foreign aid 
money to fund or promote abortions 
overseas. 
If we can’t accept that, it is terribly 
disappointing and would be news to 
most Americans. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, 
again, I would just like to correct what 
my colleague is saying. We do not use 
foreign aid money to perform abortions 
overseas. In fact, a poll conducted by 
CHANGE, Center for Health and Gen-
der Equity, demonstrates that 59 per-
cent of likely voters—if we want to 
talk about polls—59 percent of likely 
voters in America oppose banning U.S. 
global health assistance going to orga-
nizations in other countries that pro-
vide legal and safe abortions or abor-
tion referrals. Only 30 percent support 
this policy. 
Research published in the Lancet 
medical journal last July found that 
the global gag rule under President 
George W. Bush—which was imple-
mented on an exponentially smaller 
scale than what was done by President 
Trump and what is proposed in the law 
that my colleague from Utah is asking 
for unanimous consent to put forward, 
that kind of reduction in access to 
services increases a country’s typical 
abortion rate by 40 percent while re-
ducing the use of modern contracep-
tives by 3.5 percent. 
See, this is what happens when you 
don’t base policy decisions on scientific 
data. You get these kinds of narratives 
that are absolutely inaccurate. What 
we know and what is repeatedly evi-
dent through the research is that the 
global gag rule or, as my colleague 
calls it, protecting life in global health 
assistance, actually increases abor-
tions. 
It is, unfortunately, simple logic. De-
creasing access to family planning 
methods like modern contraception, 
counseling, and the health spacing and 
timing of pregnancies, directly leads to 
more unwanted pregnancies. But be-
cause this policy also limits abortion 
services that organizations 
provide 
with other non-U.S. funds, women with 
unwanted pregnancies are forced to 
seek out unsafe abortions. That is why 
we see the abortion numbers increase. 
So it is a lose-lose policy, and, of 
course, it is women and children who 
pay the price. 
The Foundation for AIDS Research 
found that one-third of 286 PEPFAR 
Programs implementing partners who 
were surveyed had altered their serv-
ices or organizational operations in re-
sponse to the global gag rule under 
former President Trump—a great pro-
gram, PEPFAR, under George W. Bush, 
that has saved millions of lives, and 
yet what we saw under the Trump im-
plementation of the global gag rule is 
that they had to alter the services that 
they provided, including reducing sex-
ual and reproductive health and preg-
nancy counseling, youth outreach, con-
traception services, and HIV coun-
seling, testing, and treatment. 
The policies that my colleague is ad-
vocating for makes the situation worse 
for women and families, and if he 
would look at the scientific data, he 
would understand that. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 88 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, since 1976, Federal law has pro-
hibited the use of Federal funds—tax-
payer dollars—for abortion. 
Section 1008 of the Public Health 
Service Act explicitly States that title 
X funds ‘‘shall not be used in programs 
where abortion is a method of family 
planning.’’ 
But, as often happens in Federal law, 
there is a loophole: Federal regulations 
do allow abortion facilities to be co-
located within clinics that are fol-
lowing the title X rules, and those

rules 
are 
providing 
healthcare 
to 
women. 
The Title X Abortion Provider Prohi-
bition Act would close that loophole by 
prohibiting the awarding of these funds 
to entities that perform abortions or 
that provide funds to entities that per-
form abortions. 
The bill allows for exceptions to be 
made in cases of rape or incest or to 
save the life of the mother. It would 
also require HHS to provide an annual 
report to Congress listing entities re-
ceiving grant funds, and specifying 
which of those grantees performed 
abortions under the exceptions. 
This is not a big change. As I said, 
this is a simple change. It is one that 
would add to the protections of women 
and their unborn children. It is a statu-
tory fix that will redirect tens of mil-
lions of dollars in funding to providers, 
our community care clinics that are of-
fering comprehensive healthcare serv-
ices for women. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 88, and the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. We are in 
the middle of a pandemic. Families are 
struggling, and we should be doing ev-
erything we can to make it easier for 
them to get the care they need from 
providers that they trust. 
The title X program has been incred-
ibly helpful to people seeking all kinds 
of healthcare, from cancer screenings 
to STI screenings, to birth control, and 
more. And before the Trump adminis-
tration’s gag rule slashed the capacity 
of the title X network in half by cut-
ting out trusted healthcare providers, 
over 4 million patients a year turned to 
title 
X-funded 
providers 
for 
their 
healthcare. 
These patients are disproportionately 
young people, women who have low in-
comes, and women of color. An over-
whelming majority of them have his-
torically 
turned 
to 
providers 
like 
Planned Parenthood, which would be 
permanently kicked out of the program 
by this bill. 
We need to be tearing down barriers, 
like former President Trump’s title X 
gag rule, that are jeopardizing access 
to care for patients, not reinforcing 
them. And we need to be focused on ad-
dressing the pain of this pandemic and 
on taking steps to finally end it, not 
wasting time with blatantly ideolog-
ical bills that appeal to the far-right 
base at the expense of our families. 
While Republicans seem intent on 
keeping patients from getting the 
healthcare they need, I am glad we fi-
nally have a President who is listening 
to women and men across the country. 
He has made clear that he wants 
healthcare to be a right, not a privi-
lege, and he has already directed his 
administration to review the damage of 
title X gag rules that have been so 
harmful to so many people—an impor-
tant step toward rescinding the rule, as 
I continue to push for. 
So I urge my Republican colleagues 
to stop these attacks on women’s 
healthcare and turn their attention to 
something 
families 
actually 
want, 
which is serious action to end this pan-
demic. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I appreciate the opportunity to 
respond to much of what my colleague 
had to say about we are in the middle 
of a pandemic. Families are struggling. 
Yes, indeed, that is very true. And if 
you 
want 
to 
talk 
about 
making 
healthcare services more available to 
more women, then, yes, indeed, what 
you want to do is make certain that 
these taxpayer funds are not used to 
provide abortion services, that these 
funds are going to the community clin-
ics that are the ones that are providing 
the screenings. 
Many of the Planned Parenthood 
clinics do abortions. They refer women 
to the community clinic around the 
corner for the cancer screenings, for 
the breast exams, for the Pap smears. 
So there should be agreement that, 
yes, individuals should have access to 
this healthcare. And if you say: If you 
perform abortions, you cannot have 
these title X dollars, then the hundreds 
of community clinics that are access 
points to healthcare for women in un-
derserved communities, these funds 
would be made available to them. 
I think we also have to talk about 
rights and privileges and touch on that 
for just a moment. I fully appreciate, 
we all have different opinions, and it is 
wonderful that we live in a country 
that allows freedom of speech, where 
we can express our difference of opin-
ions. 
What we do have to realize is this, 
that we have in this country 1,700 lives 
lost every day to abortion—1,700 voice-
less and vulnerable—and to me that is 
just an absolutely heartbreaking stat 
that these unborn children do not have 
the opportunity to enjoy that right to 
life. I find that very sad. 
As I said, this legislation would make 
certain that all of this money goes to 
these health clinics but not to a clinic 
that provides abortion service. 
This is the kind of access that, yes, 
indeed, many families would appreciate 
having more access and more services 
available to women at their commu-
nity clinics. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
S. CON. RES. 5 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you. The ac-
tions of my Democratic colleagues this 
week make it clear that they do not 
have any intention of working with Re-
publicans on a bipartisan COVID pack-
age. There is no other explanation for 
the budget resolution that was intro-
duced this week. 
We are not considering this budget 
resolution for the usual purpose of es-
tablishing overall spending and rev-
enue levels for the fiscal year. That has 
already been done. The sole purpose, 
then, of this budget is to establish rec-
onciliation instructions whereby the 
majority can pass a partisan COVID 
package on a party-line vote, quite 
contrary to the inaugural address of 
President Biden where he said he was 
going to be reaching out to Repub-
licans. 
I know there has been some discus-
sion with Republicans but not a serious 
effort to compromise. Embarking down 
this inherently partisan path of going 
the budgetary reconciliation route now 
poisons the well for any fruitful bipar-
tisan negotiation. And you can’t say it 
too many times that it is completely 
at odds with President Biden’s call for 
unity and bipartisanship during the 
campaign and told to the people of the 
United States in the inaugural address. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. My 
Republican colleagues and I stand 
ready to engage in bipartisan discus-
sions to reach an agreement to provide 
targeted COVID relief. A consensus 
package could be done very quickly, 
just as happened with the bipartisan 
CARES package back in March of last 
year. The relief package Congress 
passed in December came together very 
quickly once both sides agreed to set 
aside partisan poison pills. Republicans 
did that for things we wanted, and 
Democrats did that for things they 
wanted. 
Now, hardly 6 weeks later, here we 
are back on a partisan approach to 
helping the needy people because of the 
pandemic and helping the healthcare 
crisis because of the pandemic. In the 
past year or so, we have done a lot. We 
have been able to come together in a 
bipartisan way to pass around $4 tril-
lion in COVID-focused relief, and we 
did that all—you can’t say it too many 
times—with strong bipartisan support. 
Why not now? There is no reason we 
can’t come together for the American 
people and do it once more and prob-
ably have to do it again after some-
thing would be passed the early part of 
this year. 
Instead of wasting our time with a 
weeklong partisan exercise, we could 
be working together today to forge a 
bipartisan compromise. If this was the 
course that the majority were to take, 
I think there is much that we could 
agree to with near universal support 
and do it in short order. Everyone rec-
ognizes we need to get control of the 
virus as a first priority. That is nec-
essary to save lives and get back to 
anything close to resembling a nor-
mally functioning economy. 
Rapid deployment of the vaccine is 
our best hope for our getting there to

get the economy functioning. I doubt a 
single Member of this Senate body 
would object to additional funds for 
vaccine distribution if it will get more 
people vaccinated sooner. I am also 
confident that many on my side could 
agree to additional relief for individ-
uals and small businesses that have 
been hardest hit by the pandemic. I am 
sure of that because we have done it 
twice in the past. We can have a discus-
sion 
on 
unemployment 
assistance, 
rental assistance, funds for reopening 
schools, and additional grants to small 
businesses to help them keep the lights 
on. I can say that very positively be-
cause we have done it twice in the past. 
But any relief, from our point of 
view, ought to be targeted and focused 
on the task at hand. At $1.9 trillion, 
the President’s proposal is far from 
being targeted and far from being fo-
cused. It includes permanent, liberal, 
structural economic reforms. This is 
using a crisis to enact long-term Demo-
cratic policy priorities rather than ad-
dressing the immediate needs of the 
day. 
It also includes a bailout of fiscally 
irresponsible States at the expense of 
States that have managed their budg-
ets very wisely, like my home State of 
Iowa. This is fundamentally unfair to 
the taxpayers in responsibly governed 
States. 
The President putting forward his 
proposal should have marked the be-
ginning of the discussion, not the end. 
If my Democratic colleagues would 
abandon this partisan exercise, bipar-
tisan discussions could start in ear-
nest. In fact, 10 Republicans made an 
attempt to do that by spending 2 hours 
with President Biden at the Oval Of-
fice. They reached out, obviously, and 
President Biden listened and discussed 
in good faith, but it doesn’t seem like 
anything can come of it. This may 
mean that you have to compromise on 
some priorities. That is a simple part 
of life here in the U.S. Senate if you 
want to get anything done. 
The excuse that there isn’t enough 
time or the need for relief is so urgent 
that bipartisanship must go out the 
window is just that—nothing but a sim-
ple excuse. By following the current 
path, this entire week is being wasted 
on partisan theater, with no tangible 
benefit for the American people. At the 
end of this week, the Senate will be no 
closer to drafting actual relief legisla-
tion. 
We should instead be working to-
gether to iron out our differences, to 
get bipartisan relief to the American 
people, and that can be done sooner 
than using the reconciliation process 
that turns out to be a partisan ap-
proach that is needless to do based on 
the fact that twice in the last 11 
months, we have passed bipartisan 
virus relief packages to help fight the 
pandemic, to help people who are hurt 
by the economic consequences of that 
pandemic, and also to give confidence 
to the American people. Let’s move in 
a bipartisan way. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
rise today to discuss the urgent chal-
lenge our Nation is facing and the ur-
gent response that it requires. 
I am always willing to work across 
the aisle to look for common ground 
and commonsense solutions. I think 
my colleagues know this and my record 
shows it. I am going to keep talking to 
my Republican colleagues in hopes 
that there are areas where we can find 
common ground to help our workers 
and our families and get our arms 
around this pandemic. But what we 
cannot do is allow the possibility of 
further delay or weaken our response 
efforts. 
With the resources in this resolution, 
we will be able to reinforce our public 
health 
workforce, 
our 
community 
health centers, and our supply chain, 
all of which are stretched incredibly 
thin. 
We will be able to scale up testing 
and 
tracing 
and 
vaccination 
and 
genomic sequencing and surveillance 
for new strains of virus and address 
harmful health inequities that con-
tinue to make this crisis so much more 
deadly for communities of color. 
We will be able to provide needed 
support to our students, our educators, 
our public schools, and those in higher 
education as they grapple with this cri-
sis and work towards safely reopening 
for in-person learning. 
We will be able to provide to parents 
in need of quality, affordable childcare 
and to a childcare sector staring down 
mass closures and layoffs. 
We need to help workers who are 
struggling today to make ends meet, 
who are unemployed, and who are wor-
ried 
about 
their 
retirement 
being 
thrown into jeopardy. We need to help 
families across the country who are 
struggling today to make ends meet, 
by providing them with direct financial 
assistance. We need to help States and 
Tribes and cities and communities 
whose budgets have been stretched 
dangerously thin, by providing needed 
funds. 
I see no reason why pursuing this 
path has to be partisan. After all, if Re-
publicans can use budget reconciliation 
to give huge tax breaks to the wealthi-
est corporations, surely they are will-
ing to use it to give relief to commu-
nities and families who are struggling 
in this economic crisis. If they can try 
to 
use 
reconciliation 
to 
cause 
a 
healthcare crisis by taking health cov-
erage and healthcare protections away 
from hundreds of millions of people, 
surely they can support this process, 
using it to fight the healthcare crisis 
that has claimed over 440,000 lives in 
our country and counting. But if they 
do not, if they insist that using this 
process to provide relief during a his-
toric pandemic is a partisan vote or 
that the amount of the relief is too 
much, I think they are going to have a 
tough time explaining what and whom 
they stand for. 
Democrats have no problem going on 
the record as the party that fought for 
people during the pandemic because, 
when your house is in flames, you do 
not argue about how much of the fire 
to put out or how much water to use or 
how many lives to save; you do what-
ever it takes until the crisis is over and 
everyone is safe, and you do it as fast 
as you can. 
This crisis is not over. Everyone is 
not safe—not from this virus and not 
from this economic crisis. There are 
440,000 people who have died. We are 
still averaging 140,000 new cases a day. 
New strains are presenting new chal-
lenges. 
Underlying 
disparities 
are 
growing deeper, and we are already see-
ing with vaccination rates that com-
munities of color are being left behind. 
We do have to take action, and that 
is exactly what Democrats are doing 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am 
here today to speak in favor of the un-
derlying resolution and urge my col-
leagues to support it. I will be very 
brief. 
I would like to tackle three topics, 
amongst many, in this package. I 
would like to talk a bit about the crisis 
that stands ahead of us with respect to 
summer learning and summer program-
ming for kids all across this country. I 
would like to talk a little bit about the 
importance of expediting the pace of 
vaccinations and then, lastly, about 
the global fight that lies ahead of us to 
make sure that we are building a pan-
demic response infrastructure around 
the world that makes sure this never, 
ever happens again. 
Before delving into those three top-
ics, let me just say that we have an op-
portunity to pass programming to 
meet this moment that is wildly pop-
ular. There was a poll out yesterday 
that suggests that many of the most 
important programming in this pack-
age enjoy 70 percent support amongst 
the public. The relief checks, which 
will total $2,000—$600 from last year, 
$1,400 in this package—have 74 percent 
support among the American public. 
Only 13 percent of Americans oppose 
those checks. Increased Federal fund-
ing for vaccinations—69 percent favor 
that increased funding; 17 percent op-
pose it. Those are difficult numbers to 
get on any major area of policy in the 
United States today. To have 74 per-
cent in favor of anything is pretty im-
pressive. 
But it speaks to the moment. It 
speaks to the expectations that Ameri-
cans have. But it also speaks to the

February 3, 2021 
fact that there is unity in the Amer-
ican public about what we need to do. 
President Biden rightly talked about 
unifying the country around an agenda 
to build back this country better, and 
these polling numbers show that he has 
done that because you don’t get to 74 
percent support for an initiative with-
out a whole bunch of Democrats, Inde-
pendents, and Republicans supporting 
that measure. 
So we hope—we want to get to a 
place where we have bipartisan support 
in the Senate, but we know we have bi-
partisan support for this agenda out in 
the American public. These polling 
numbers and polling numbers to come 
will prove that. The reason is that the 
crises we are trying to address don’t 
really care what your politics are. 
Let me talk about these three dis-
tinct areas. 
First, I want to talk about what is 
happening in our schools. Others have 
done that in a far more articulate way, 
so I want to drill down specifically on 
what is going to happen this summer. 
Schools are in crisis right now. I 
know that because I have two kids in 
public school—in a big, urban public 
school. They haven’t been back in the 
classroom at all. They have continued 
to learn from home the entire time. 
But they have all the support that they 
need around them—two loving parents 
who are willing and able to help in any 
way that we can. Not every child has 
that. So schools have been scrambling 
just to make sure that they are doing 
instruction right, that they are open-
ing schools safely, that they are build-
ing support systems around students. 
But come this summer, you are going 
to have all sorts of kids who aren’t 
going to have programming ready for 
them, aren’t going to have a safe place 
to go, and are going to have tremen-
dous amounts of learning loss. 
You are also going to have kids who 
are in need of a really healthy, safe 
place to be this summer. Some kids 
will need deep academic experience, 
but others kids are just going to need 
some emotional growth, are going to 
need something fun to do so that they 
have the ability to restart and be ready 
to reenter what will, hopefully, be a 
much more normal-looking classroom. 
In this bill is over $100 billion for 
schools, to support the safe reopening 
of schools. And what we do in this plan 
that the President is proposing to us is 
to allow for some of that money to be 
used for summer programming. 
I am going to make a pitch to have a 
set-aside, a portion of money dedicated 
to summer programming. But what we 
all agree on—those of us who support 
this package—is that the challenge 
ahead of us is not just how we keep 
schools open and open those that have 
had their doors closed, but what we do 
to support kids for 12 months of the 
year, not just 9 months of the year. 
This is going to be a tough summer 
for a lot of kids, and we have to have a 
specific focus—as this plan does—on 
meaningful summer programming for 
kids—programming that is emotion-
ally healthy, that addresses some of 
this learning loss. 
In a typical year, middle-class kids— 
kids with families that have some 
means—are five times as likely as 
those living in poverty to attend a 
summer camp, twice as likely to visit a 
museum or go to a performance. We 
can’t allow for that disparity to be 
present this summer, not this summer. 
We have to have funding in this bill. 
We have to pass funding through Con-
gress to make sure that every kid in 
this country, especially kids coming 
from limited-means backgrounds, can 
get into quality summer programming. 
This summer we have to make that 
promise to them. 
Second, let me talk about vaccines. I 
know my colleague from Connecticut 
is going to talk about this as well. 
We did well this past week. There 
were 1.36 million doses administered. I 
say ‘‘well’’ because that is 20 percent 
more than we did the following week, 
but it is not good enough. 
In this plan from President Biden is 
$10 billion to operationalize the De-
fense Production Act. Senator BALDWIN 
and I have been working on this issue 
for the better part of a year. If you 
want to produce more vaccine, if you 
want to produce more testing equip-
ment, more PPE, then you have to or-
ganize America’s industrial base better 
than what was happening under the 
Trump administration. You have to go 
out and find every potential manufac-
turing partner who can help Pfizer and 
Moderna and Johnson & Johnson and 
any vaccine maker that comes after 
them be able to make more and make 
it faster. 
We are standing up capacity in Con-
necticut. We are doing well—No. 3 na-
tionally in terms of the percentage of 
shots that we get into people’s arms— 
but we can do a lot more. We just need 
that production to be ramped up. In 
this 
bill 
is 
specific 
money 
to 
operationalize the Defense Production 
Act so that we can make more vac-
cines. That is one of the most impor-
tant parts of this bill. 
Finally, I wanted to talk about the 
global challenge that we have ahead of 
us. This virus didn’t start in the United 
States. But, man, it moved quick— 
from a wet market in China to the west 
coast of the United States to today, 
with 400,000 lives having been lost. And 
the question is: Why? Why was this 
virus able to move so quickly? Why 
weren’t we able to contain it? Why 
didn’t we learn more about it earlier? 
Why wasn’t the world ready for this 
moment? 
Now, China has a lot to answer for. 
But, frankly, the whole world has to 
understand that we didn’t allocate re-
sources properly. The United States 
didn’t allocate resources properly. We 
spent, last year, $740 billion on hard-
ware for the Department of Defense 
and $12 billion on global public health. 
Nobody today, living in the United 
States, would tell you that that was 
the correct allocation. So inside Presi-
dent Biden’s package is funding to 
start to rebuild the global pandemic 
prevention infrastructure. 
I won’t go into the details of how we 
do that today, but there are estimates 
suggesting that we are going to need 
over $20 billion globally in order to 
stand 
up 
greater 
capacities. 
That 
means more resources at a reformed 
WHO. That means more U.S. diplomats 
who are working in the public health 
space. That means doing partnerships 
with developing nations in which we 
put some money on the table in ex-
change for public health reform so that 
they can strengthen their own systems 
of pandemic detection and prevention. 
But even if you drive this thing down 
in the United States, so long as there 
are outbreaks that exist on the other 
side of the world, we are still at risk. 
And there may come along a virus 
down the road that is even more con-
tagious, that spreads even faster than 
this one, so shame on us if we don’t, at 
the same time, lock down this virus do-
mestically and set up a system of de-
fense internationally to make sure 
that we are ready for the next one. 
We can walk and chew gum at the 
same time. And President Biden’s focus 
on rebuilding our alliances comes at 
the right time because we are not 
going to be able to do this by ourselves. 
We have to meet the moment. We 
can’t go small right now. The problems 
are too big. 
Senator BLUMENTHAL
and I have 
spent lots of time at food banks in Con-
necticut. We have never, ever seen the 
desperate need that exists today in our 
State. Shame on us if we don’t use the 
power that has been granted us to both 
take on this virus and deliver economic 
prosperity to people who have had it 
robbed from them through no fault of 
their own. 
I urge my colleagues’ support for the 
budget resolution. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am really pleased to follow my col-
league Senator MURPHY after that very 
articulate case and to build on the case 
for keeping our promises to America. 
The 
Presiding 
Officer 
knows 
that 
promises made must be kept, including 
another $1,400 in stimulus payments to 
every individual, bringing that total to 
$2,000, which is what we promised; to 
make sure that vaccines are available 
broadly across this country and that 
schools 
become 
places 
of 
learning 
again, in person for students and teach-
ers in a safe learning environment. 
What we are doing in this package, 
which is big and bold—and it has to 
be—is to put money in people’s pock-
ets, put vaccinations in people’s arms, 
and put children back in schools safely. 
And I emphasize ‘‘safely.’’ 
Now, I was very excited over this 
past week or 10 days to travel through-
out the State of Connecticut and visit 
clinics where vaccinations are being

February 3, 2021 
provided to thousands of people in Con-
necticut, raising our rate to one of the 
highest in the country—about 10.3 per-
cent. 
I saw nurses and doctors at Danbury 
Hospital, led by John Murphy, making 
promises real for people. 
I visited Rentschler Field, a former 
runway turned into a vaccination site 
for people receiving those shots in 
their arms from the Community Health 
Center, headed by Mark Masselli. 
I saw vaccinations at Griffin Hos-
pital, a wonderful team headed by Pat 
Charmel. But here is the story at Grif-
fin Hospital. Last week they did 6,000 
doses. This week it will be 2,000, not be-
cause of any lack of skilled vaccination 
person power, not because of any lack 
of determination—because of lack of 
vaccine. 
Shortages in Connecticut and around 
the country are impeding and setting 
back our effort. They are lengthening 
the tunnel. There is light at the end of 
the tunnel, but it is longer as we delay 
the vaccine that is necessary to do the 
job. 
There is not enough. It is not reach-
ing the people who need it in enough 
supply, and it is not being delivered eq-
uitably. The numbers in Connecticut 
show that people in communities of 
color are nowhere near as likely to re-
ceive that vaccine—in fact, perhaps 
three times less likely. 
We need to make sure that delivery 
is fair and effective in this country, or 
we will never conquer this pandemic 
and put America back to work. Using 
the national Defense Production Act is 
absolutely necessary, but so is the 
commitment of $160 billion in this big 
and bold relief program. 
It has to be big and bold. It also has 
to be done now. Time is not on our 
side. I have no tolerance for delay or 
dithering. I have no patience for cuts 
in this package; $1.9 trillion ought to 
be our floor, not our ceiling. And if 
there is a need for targeting those 
stimulus payments, the money ought 
to be reallocated to vaccines and to 
creating safer environments to work 
and to learn. 
Vaccines 
are 
important 
to 
our 
schools. Teachers are essential work-
ers. They are on the frontlines. They 
are putting their lives at risk. They 
have been demonstrating the courage 
and conviction to come to school, but 
they should receive this vaccine. 
A safe learning environment means 
also personal protective equipment, 
barriers such as we are seeing in res-
taurants and other public places— 
plexiglass and other kinds of dividers. 
These kinds of essential equipment are 
the reason that we are advocating $130 
billion for our schools. 
There are many other steps that 
must be taken to ensure not only that 
our learning environments are safe but 
also 
that 
students 
have 
the 
connectivity they need remotely be-
cause for some period of time, that will 
be the way they learn. 
More than a third of communities of 
color in the State of Connecticut, 
which is thought to be a very sophisti-
cated and advanced State, still lack 
that connectivity—a third of our sen-
iors. Safe and fair learning environ-
ments mean broadband, and that is 
also another reason for that $130 billion 
in this package. 
Many of these students face serious 
gaps—1 to 3 months and even longer for 
some students who have lacked that 
connectivity—up to 6 months in basic 
skills: reading, writing, and arith-
metic. These kinds of gaps have to be 
filled. 
We need a major effort to focus on 
our students who have been left behind, 
and that is why this kind of package is 
a moral imperative. It is a social obli-
gation. We will lose talents and skills, 
but students will also lose their future. 
We should come together on a bipar-
tisan basis. There is nothing wrong 
with cooperation, and I hope that my 
colleagues across the aisle will join 
with us as we move forward, but we 
will move forward. We cannot repeat 
the mistakes of the past when efforts 
to wait meant unconscionable delay. 
We have no such luxury in this human-
itarian crisis. We must move forward, 
and we will. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Nevada. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. 
ROSEN. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
American people need our help, and 
they need it now. Far too many fami-
lies are struggling just to get by. 
My home State of Nevada has been 
hit especially hard during this pan-
demic. Before COVID, Nevada was sta-
ble, and Nevada was thriving, but since 
the pandemic began, our industries— 
especially our travel and tourism, key 
economic pillars of our State—were 
devastated. In fact, countless Nevada 
businesses have struggled, and unfortu-
nately many have had to close their 
doors permanently. This is forcing Ne-
vadans out of work and putting their 
financial well-being in jeopardy. Now, 
during this public health and economic 
crisis, Nevada is close to having the 
highest rate of unemployment in the 
Nation. 
Here in Congress, we have passed 
stopgap packages to try to help all 
those who are facing these tough 
times. The relief measures we have de-
livered for the American people have 
been a good start, but they are not 
enough to safely see our country 
through this pandemic. 
Small business owners risk losing 
their businesses if they cannot access 
the full loans and grants that Congress 
promised them but that the last ad-
ministration failed to deliver. Our 
State and local governments have ex-
hausted their budgets responding to 
this public health crisis, and as a re-
sult, they face looming cuts to essen-
tial support and services that our com-
munities are relying on. 
This isn’t something that is hap-
pening just in my State; this is the 
common experience across our country. 
The people of Nevada, the American 
people—they are desperately calling 
out for a lifeline, and we must deliver 
a real one and as soon as possible. 
COVID–19 is a global public health 
emergency, and it requires the full 
force of the U.S. Government. We must 
act boldly and efficiently as we work to 
overcome this crisis and meet the 
needs of this moment. 
We need real relief—real relief for 
families who are struggling to pay 
their bills, for those who are struggling 
to afford basic necessities, for parents 
who are struggling just to feed their 
kids. 
We need real relief. We need real re-
lief for our travel and tourism indus-
tries. We need to ensure that they can 
make it through this turbulent time. 
We need a framework for ensuring that 
health and safety standards are met, 
and we need a path toward restoring 
consumer confidence. 
We need real relief—real relief for 
our small businesses, including tax 
credits to help businesses get by and 
full EIDL loans and grants without ar-
bitrary caps. 
We need real relief—real relief for 
our workers, including increased unem-
ployment benefits and proper IT infra-
structure to get those benefits out fast-
er to Americans in need. 
We need real relief—real relief for 
State and local governments so that 
they can continue working tirelessly to 
save the lives of Americans in every 
corner of our Nation, so that they can 
continue testing and tracing in our 
communities, so that they can con-
tinue to provide childcare for essential 
workers, and so that they continue to 
provide PPE and things to limit the 
spread of COVID–19. 
We need real relief—real relief that 
supports a greater vaccine distribution 
and accelerates vaccine deployment, 
including to our communities of color 
and rural areas where healthcare ac-
cess is too frequently a challenge. 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO and I have 
been working with our Governor. We 
have been working with our Governor 
and working with all of our local gov-
ernments to get more shots in arms 
across the State of Nevada, but we 
need more. 
When so many in our country are 
hurting and they are struggling, we 
must ask ourselves why American fam-
ilies, why members of our commu-
nities, why would they deserve any 
less? It is time for a comprehensive re-
lief package that truly provides relief 
to the American people. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in this effort to help see our Nation 
through this challenge. Lives are de-
pending on us. Our States are counting 
on us. The whole country is looking to 
us—looking to us to show leadership, 
to stand up, to save lives and liveli-
hoods. So let’s ensure that we don’t let 
them down. Let’s pass that real relief, 
thoughtful and targeted relief, and do 
it now. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S311 
February 3, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. President, more 
than 3,000 of my fellow New Mexicans 
have lost their lives to COVID–19. They 
were New Mexicans like Teresa, an es-
sential medical worker from Springer, 
NM. She bravely went to work to test 
Haitians for COVID–19 and to stop the 
spread of the disease. Tragically, Te-
resa contracted COVID–19 and passed 
away over the Christmas holiday, leav-
ing behind her husband Roger and their 
three children. 
But Congress has another chance to 
spare other families the pain that Tere-
sa’s family is experiencing, the very 
thing that drove Teresa every day to 
go and save others. This resolution will 
allow Congress to mount an aggressive 
public health response and prioritize 
resources 
where 
they 
are 
needed 
most—for vaccines, testing, and public 
health programs that fight COVID. 
Funding included in this package will 
be aimed at dramatically increasing 
rates of testing, bolstering the supply 
chain to increase the availability of 
testing supplies and personal protec-
tive equipment, hiring and training 
public health workers to administer 
the vaccine, and increasing vaccine 
production. 
As Congress focuses on getting vac-
cinations into every arm as quickly as 
possible, strong Federal funding is es-
pecially critical for States like New 
Mexico, where vaccines and medical 
supplies must travel longer distances 
to reach the communities that need 
them. 
We know we have the capacity to get 
these vaccines in people’s arms. We 
need more vaccine. Vaccines are essen-
tial to the priorities I have heard from 
many of my constituents—safely open-
ing schools as soon as possible because 
this pandemic is widening the achieve-
ment gap that already existed. To meet 
this goal, Congress must invest in safe-
ly reopening schools and make facility 
improvements to ensure every educa-
tor, the people who prepare the food, 
drive the buses, keep the schools look-
ing clean, social workers and nurses, 
and every student is safe to return. 
America must provide quality dis-
tance learning to those who are not yet 
ready to return and work to address 
widespread learning loss that exacer-
bates the achievement gap. It is also 
clear that the toll of COVID–19 on stu-
dents’ learning and mental health will 
last for years, meaning investments 
are necessary well beyond this aca-
demic year. 
The Senate must act for the families 
who have lost loved ones, for Roger and 
Teresa and their three kids, and for 
parents struggling to keep their stu-
dents safe and healthy. 
The Senate must act to defeat this 
virus and to rebuild our Nation’s econ-
omy. It must pass this budget resolu-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as the 
new chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, I wanted to take a few mo-
ments to talk about the $1.9 trillion 
budget resolution that I hope will be 
passed late tomorrow night. 
I think sometimes our friends in the 
media make the political process much 
more complicated than it is. Real poli-
tics in a democracy is not that com-
plicated. What it is about is assessing 
the problems facing the Nation and 
coming up with solutions to those 
problems. 
One of the great tragedies that has 
occurred, in my view, in recent years is 
that for working-class people, middle- 
class 
people, 
lower-income 
people, 
these are folks who in a variety of 
ways are hurting and have hurt for 
many, many years. Wages in this coun-
try have been stagnant for decades. 
Young people are finding it increas-
ingly difficult to go to college. Ninety 
million Americans are uninsured or 
underinsured. We have a political sys-
tem which is significantly corrupt be-
cause big money can buy elections. 
And people look around them and they 
say: Who cares about me? Who is wor-
ried about me or my parents or my 
kids? 
When that happens—when that kind 
of political alienation happens—people 
can become prone to conspiracy theo-
ries and all kinds of big lies and every-
thing else. Here is the simple truth, 
not complicated. Right now in this 
year 2021, we face more crises than this 
country has faced certainly since the 
Great Depression and maybe going 
back to the Civil War, when the very 
existence of this country was at stake. 
As we speak right now, whether it is 
in the State of Georgia or my State of 
Vermont and all over this country, 
there are tens of millions of working 
families who have lost their jobs, lost 
their incomes, and they are worried to-
night as to how they are going to be 
able to feed their families. They are 
worried about the back rent they owe. 
We have a moratorium on evictions, 
but that moratorium some day is going 
to end. People say: How am I going to 
pay thousands of dollars in back rent? 
I am going to be evicted. I am going to 
be out on the street. 
People are in the midst of this ter-
rible, terrible pandemic, where we have 
lost over 400,000 lives—well over 400,000 
lives. There are over 90 million people 
who are uninsured or underinsured and 
are having difficulty affording going to 
the doctor, and on and on it goes. 
Kids. I have seven grandchildren. 
Kids all over this country have had 
their education disrupted. 
As a result of the pandemic, people 
have 
become 
isolated 
from 
their 
friends and their families. Mental ill-
ness is soaring with increased numbers 
of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ide-
ation. 
This country faces just terrible, ter-
rible problems. I think we can agree 
that the year 2020 was the worst year 
in so many ways in our lifetime, maybe 
in the history of this country. And 
now, right now, it is absolutely impera-
tive that the Congress of the United 
States understands that reality and 
keeps faith with the American people. 
One of the reasons, by the way—and 
I say this to the Presiding Officer 
today, who is from Georgia and re-
cently won his election—it is doubly 
important that we keep faith with the 
American people is because promises 
were made in this election in Georgia, 
which was not just a Senate race. It 
was more of a national race. President 
Biden was involved. Majority Leader 
SCHUMER was involved. I was involved. 
A lot of leading Democrats were in-
volved. 
We said to the people in Georgia and 
we said to the people in America: If we 
gain the majority, we are going to sig-
nificantly improve lives for working 
people all over this country. Those are 
promises made that must be kept. 
I want to just spend a few moments 
to talk about what is in this bill. We 
throw out numbers—$1.9 trillion. Who 
knows what $1.9 trillion is? It is such 
an unfathomable number. It is such a 
huge number. What does it mean? Who 
knows? Who understands that? 
I want you to understand what is in 
this bill. For a start, what I believe and 
I know you believe is that when people 
are hurting, when they owe back rent, 
when they can’t afford to feed their 
kids, when they can’t afford to go to 
the doctor, we need to get cash into the 
pockets of those people as soon as we 
possibly can. 
I was one of the people here a month 
ago when a whole lot of people were 
talking about it. I said we need direct 
payments. We need to get cash into the 
hands of people. I fought very hard. We 
ended up with just $600 in the last bill. 
It wasn’t enough. It is a start, but not 
enough. We said our goal was $2,000. 
And in this bill, there will be an addi-
tional $1,400 for every working-class 
man, woman, and child. 
So if you are an individual, a single 
person making $75,000 or less, when we 
pass this legislation you are going to 
get a check for $1,400. If you are a cou-
ple earning less than $150,000, and let’s 
just say you have two kids, each person 
in the family, the husband, the wife, 
and the two kids get $1,400 apiece. That 
is $5,600. 
Let me tell you something. For a 
struggling working-class family, that 
$5,600 is going to mean an enormous 
amount. It will allow people to pay the 
rent, allow people to pay off their 
debts, allow people to go to the doctor. 
That is what this legislation is about. 
We made a promise. Some of us made 
that promise—I did—that we would 
make sure that in working-class fami-
lies, each individual gets $2,000 and we

will keep that promise: $600 then, $1,400 
now. 
As a result of this pandemic, we have 
seen a horrific increase in unemploy-
ment. Unemployment is soaring all 
over this country. Millions of workers 
have lost their jobs. They have no in-
come coming in. The extended unem-
ployment benefits that were previously 
passed are going to expire in mid- 
March. What this legislation does— 
very importantly—if you are unem-
ployed right now and you are worried 
you are going to lose your employ-
ment, when we pass this legislation, 
your unemployment is going to be ex-
tended through the end of September. 
And on top of the normal unemploy-
ment benefits you get from your 
State—and they vary State to State— 
you are going to get an additional $400 
a week. We will not turn our backs on 
the millions of unemployed workers in 
this country. 
Included in the legislation that we 
are fighting for is the need to raise the 
minimum wage in this country from 
the starvation wage that currently ex-
ists of $7.25 an hour to a living wage of 
$15 an hour. Now, we understand that 
restaurants and small businesses are 
hurting, and in this legislation, there 
will be a significant amount of money 
to make sure that small businesses will 
be able to afford that wage increase. 
You know, when we talk about the 
economy, the media very often focuses 
on the stock market. That is impor-
tant. We can focus on unemployment— 
terribly important. Yet what we don’t 
focus on enough is that half of our 
workers in this country are living pay-
check to paycheck. They have nothing 
in the bank, and they have to live off 
the paychecks they make. If they have 
an automobile problem—the car breaks 
down—or somebody in the family gets 
sick, they are in deep financial trouble. 
It seems to me that, in the richest 
country in the history of the world, it 
is not too much to demand that, if you 
work 40 hours a week, you don’t live in 
poverty. Fifteen bucks an hour is not 
going to make anybody rich, but I have 
seen workers and talked to workers all 
over this country who are trying to 
raise their kids on $10, $12 an hour, and 
you can’t do it. So $15 an hour is an im-
portant start in making sure that all 
working people in this country can live 
with dignity. 
This legislation will expand the child 
tax credit from $2,000 to $3,000 and to 
$3,600 for families with kids under the 
age of 6. Now, what is not talked about 
very much in America—not by politi-
cians, not by the media—is the fact 
that we have one of the highest rates of 
childhood poverty of almost any major 
country on Earth, and that is a ter-
rible, terrible thing. You know, politi-
cians give speeches of ‘‘the future of 
this country is with our children,’’ so 
forth and so on, but they have millions 
of kids living in poverty. Millions of 
families can’t afford to send their kids 
to decent quality childcare. So expand-
ing the child tax credit will go a very 
long way to reducing child poverty in 
America, and that is something that 
we must do. 
It is no great secret that, as a result 
of the pandemic, our revenues going 
into State and local governments are 
in significant decline. The result of 
that is that, in the last year, well over 
a million State and local employees 
have been laid off. We are talking 
about teachers. We are talking about 
firemen. We are talking about police 
officers and other municipal and State 
employees. When you have those lay-
offs, not only is that a crisis unto itself 
for those workers, it means that State 
and local governments cannot provide 
the services that need to be provided in 
the midst of this terrible crisis. So this 
legislation would provide $350 billion to 
State and local governments, many of 
which are facing bankruptcy. 
Now, obviously, the crisis that we are 
facing today is not only an economic 
crisis, it is clearly a health crisis. The 
good news is that, in a relatively short 
period of time, at least two manufac-
turers in this country—and more, I 
think, are coming on board—have in-
troduced and created vaccines, which 
are now being distributed. That is the 
good news. The bad news is that we 
need to significantly increase the pro-
duction of those vaccines. We don’t 
have enough. Even more importantly, 
we have to do a heck of a lot better job 
in distributing those vaccines and get-
ting those vaccines into the arms of 
people, and this legislation will provide 
billions and billions of dollars to do 
just that. 
At a time when we are looking at the 
highest level of hunger in this country 
in decades, many billions of dollars are 
going to make sure that our children 
and our families do not go hungry. 
Clearly, one of the major crises facing 
this country is that schools in every 
State are either not open or they are 
open with irregular hours. Kids are try-
ing to get an education online. Some-
times it works and sometimes it 
doesn’t, but our goal is to make sure 
that we can reopen schools and expand 
after-school and childcare programs for 
working families and do it in a way 
that is safe. We want parents to feel 
good and know that the facilities they 
are sending their children to are safe, 
and we have a whole lot of money in 
this bill to do just that. 
In this bill, in order to protect work-
ers, there is a sizable sum of money to 
prevent the pensions of millions of 
workers 
and 
retirees 
from 
being 
slashed by 30, 40, or even 65 percent. A 
number of years ago, in the middle of 
night, in some big omnibus bill, lan-
guage was put in that would destroy 
the promises made to millions of work-
ers in terms of the pensions that they 
were guaranteed, and we rectify that in 
this bill. 
Right now, in America, as I men-
tioned earlier, some 90 million of our 
people are either uninsured or under-
insured, which speaks to the need, in 
my view, of major healthcare reform. 
My own view is that we need to put in 
a Medicare for All, single-payer pro-
gram so that we are not spending twice 
as much per capita on healthcare as 
any other country on Earth despite so 
many people being uninsured or under-
insured. Well, Medicare for All is not in 
this bill, but what is in this bill is a 
significant amount of money to expand 
healthcare, and we are still looking at 
the best ways to do that. One of the 
ways will probably be by expanding 
Medicaid and also investing signifi-
cantly in community health centers 
and the National Health Service Corps. 
We have a crisis in terms of the num-
ber of doctors and nurses that we need, 
and the National Health Service Corps 
is a program which will forgive debt for 
doctors and nurses if they practice in 
underserved areas. 
I know sometimes we get consumed 
by numbers. It is going to be $2.1 tril-
lion, $1.9 trillion, $1.7 trillion. That is 
not the issue. The issue is whether we 
are prepared to address the crises fac-
ing the American people. Will this bill 
solve all of the problems that we face? 
No, it will not. Will it go a long way to 
addressing many of the crises and eas-
ing the anxiety of so many working 
families? Yes, it will, but this should 
not be the end of the process. As soon 
as we pass this, we are going to come 
back with another major piece of legis-
lation, and that will deal with some of 
the long-term structural problems our 
country faces in terms of a crumbling 
infrastructure and in terms of the need 
to deal with the existential threat of 
climate change. We need to create mil-
lions of good-paying jobs. That is some-
thing that this Congress has got to ad-
dress. Too many of our people are un-
employed, and too many of our people 
are underemployed. This we will be 
dealing with in the next COVID rec-
onciliation bill. 
Now, there has been some discussion 
on—and the media seems fixated on— 
the issue of partisanship. Oh, my God. 
We are being so partisan here. Let me 
remind everybody that, under the 
Trump administration, massive tax 
breaks were passed that went to the 
top 1 percent and large corporations. 
Eighty-three percent of the benefits in 
the Trump tax plan went to the 1 per-
cent and large corporations. Do you 
know how bipartisan that bill was that 
passed in reconciliation? There was not 
one Democrat who voted for that bill. 
It was voted just with Republican 
votes. 
Then, outrageously, as part of the 
reconciliation, the Republicans came 
forward and said: Hey, we think it is a 
brilliant idea to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act and throw up to 32 million 
people off the healthcare that they 
have. I don’t know what people are 
thinking about when they propose to 
throw tens of millions of people off the 
healthcare that they have, but that 
was their idea to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act. By one vote by the late John 
McCain, that did not happen, but not 
one Democrat voted for that bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S313 
February 3, 2021 
My point is that it is one thing for 
my Republican friends here to be talk-
ing about the need for bipartisanship, 
which all of us support, but the reality 
is they used exactly the same process 
to pass or at least try to pass major, 
major pieces of legislation. 
So all that I want to say is that we 
are living in an unprecedented moment 
in American history. Again, it is quite 
likely that this Congress today and 
President Biden are facing more seri-
ous crises than any President—cer-
tainly, since FDR and maybe going 
back to Abraham Lincoln—has faced. 
We have a healthcare crisis. We have a 
pandemic. We have an economic melt-
down. We have an education crisis. We 
have an infrastructure crisis. We have 
a criminal justice crisis. We have an 
immigration crisis. You name it, we 
got it. Either we are going to have the 
courage to address those problems or 
we are not, and I think now is the time 
to do it. We certainly look forward to 
the support from our Republican col-
leagues, but what is most important is 
that, at a time of massive pain and 
anxiety, this Congress acts boldly on 
behalf of working families. 
For too long, we have seen the Con-
gress give tax breaks to billionaires. 
We have seen lobbyists work to get 
hundreds of billions of dollars in cor-
porate welfare for people who don’t 
need it. We have seen a tax system in 
which major corporations like Ama-
zon—maybe the most profitable cor-
poration in America or one of the most 
profitable corporations and owned by 
the wealthiest guy in America—pay 
zero in Federal taxes, and, right now, 
the very rich have an effective tax rate 
which is lower than that of working 
families. 
So I know it may sound like a radical 
idea, but the time is now for the U.S. 
Congress to begin to represent the vast 
majority of the people—the working 
class of this country, the middle class 
of this country, and lower income peo-
ple—who are struggling. Let us work 
together. Let us crush this terrible 
pandemic. Let us get our kids back to 
school. Let us reopen our economy. Let 
us create a government that works for 
all of us and not just the very few. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is 
wonderful to see you in the Chair. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. My first 
time. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, one 
thing you can say about Americans, we 
know how to meet the moment. 
When the world was upended by a 
Great Depression and a quarter of our 
people were out of work, we took bold 
action. A brandnew President, Frank-
lin Delano Roosevelt, and large majori-
ties in Congress ushered in a New Deal 
that put folks back to work, stabilized 
our economy, and invested in Amer-
ica’s future. 
When freedom abroad was threatened 
by fascism, we again took bold action 
as a country. We used American inge-
nuity to build an arsenal of democracy, 
which, by the middle of 1944, was 
churning out B–24 bombers every 60 
minutes at Ford’s Willow Run plant in 
Michigan. 
Now is the time again to take bold 
action on behalf of the American peo-
ple. We are now a year into a pandemic 
that has claimed the lives of nearly 
450,000 Americans—450,000 Americans— 
parents and grandparents and friends 
and neighbors and cousins and cowork-
ers and community leaders. Almost 
15,000 lives have already been lost in 
Michigan—dear souls lost to us. 
And it is not just lives that have 
been 
lost. 
Businesses 
have 
closed, 
workers have been laid off, folks have 
been without paychecks for months 
and months. 
Parents are struggling to keep food 
on the table and the heat on while 
troubleshooting the spotty internet 
their children depend on to keep their 
classes going on Zoom. 
And grandmas and grandpas are 
missing out on seeing their families 
grow up. Babies born last March are al-
ready learning to walk and talk, and 
too many have not had a chance to be 
with them in person. 
Americans know how to meet the 
moment, and it is time for us to do it 
again. It is time to pass a rescue plan 
bold enough to stamp out this pan-
demic, get families the immediate help 
they need to weather the economic cri-
sis, and get our children safely back in 
school. 
That is just what our American Res-
cue Plan will do, and we need to get it 
done as soon as possible. American 
families have waited long enough. 
There are a lot of good things hap-
pening right now. A home COVID–19 
test was just approved. Soon we will 
have three effective vaccines available. 
We know that we can’t get back to nor-
mal, though, or revive our battered 
economy unless we get vaccine off 
shelves and into American arms. 
That is why our plan will increase 
the number of people being vaccinated, 
boost our testing capacity, and ensure 
that our healthcare professionals and 
other frontline workers have adequate 
protective equipment. 
The plan will also provide additional 
funding for rural health infrastructure 
through the agriculture portion of our 
bill, which I am so pleased to lead. 
Our rural hospitals are struggling to 
survive right now like places where I 
grew up in Northern Michigan. This 
funding will help them keep their doors 
open, purchase necessary supplies, vac-
cinate more people, and treat more pa-
tients via telehealth, which has become 
so important. 
In the meantime, we know that 
American families need help to survive 
during this pandemic. They need help. 
They need to know we have got their 
backs. They have got to know that, in 
all of this, somebody has got their 
back. 
The American Rescue Plan will give 
working families direct checks, extend 
crucial unemployment programs, boost 
the child tax credit and earned-income 
tax credit, which will lift half of Amer-
ican children out of poverty this year. 
Can you imagine? We have an oppor-
tunity here in Congress, working with 
our wonderful new President and Vice 
President, to pass a policy that will lift 
half the children in poverty out of pov-
erty—not 10 years from now, not 5 
years from now—this year. What an ex-
citing prospect. And we need to get it 
done. 
This means struggling families will, 
with all of this help, be able to cover 
the rent or the mortgage, pay their 
bills, keep food on the table. And keep-
ing food on the table is especially cru-
cial in a time when so many of our 
neighbors are going hungry. 
In fact, we know that 50 million 
Americans across the country—moms 
and dads and children—right now are 
facing hunger every day. We are better 
than this as a country. 
We have all heard stories about sen-
iors waiting hours in lines for a box of 
food or parents skipping meals so their 
children can have a little more to eat. 
The agriculture and nutrition fund-
ing in this American Rescue Plan will 
tackle hunger head-on by extending 
pandemic EBT for the duration of the 
pandemic. What does that mean? This 
is about children. This is about feeding 
children—children who otherwise may 
get fed at school but aren’t able to do 
that to be able to have the resources 
they need from moms and dads to feed 
them while they are not in school, as 
well as in the summer. 
It will also provide more fruits and 
vegetables for moms and babies and 
make sure that families who are eligi-
ble for help are getting it. People who 
need help in this country need to get 
that help. They need to know we have 
their back. 
We know that two-thirds of SNAP 
benefits—the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program—two-thirds of it 
goes to families with children. By ex-
tending the bump-up in SNAP funding 
through the end of September, we can 
make sure families aren’t running out 
of food and going hungry at the end of 
the month. 
That is especially important for chil-
dren because it is hard to learn—it is 
hard to learn how to read and write, 
and it is hard to focus when your stom-
ach is rumbling, when you have got a 
headache because you haven’t eaten. 
Our children need to be fed, and they 
need to be back in class as well. 
We can’t get our economy moving 
again if parents can’t return to work, 
and parents can’t return to work if 
they are worried that their children 
aren’t safe at school or one of the par-
ents or the only parent has to be home 
with the children. What do they do? 
So all of this fits together, and this 
American Rescue Plan will provide the 
support needed to safely reopen the 
majority of K–12 schools within Presi-
dent Biden’s first 100 days. 
How important is that? What a great 
goal for us to have, and we can do that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S314 
February 3, 2021 
We are just days away from working 
together and being able to get that 
done, and it will serve all students, no 
matter how, no matter where they 
learn. 
And for our farmers, speaking as the 
incoming chair of the Agriculture, Nu-
trition, and Forestry Committee, our 
farmers who have been directly af-
fected by the ups and downs of the pan-
demic, the plan addresses the break in 
the food supply chain, and it enables us 
to buy and donate their products to 
food banks. 
You know, we had so many selling to 
restaurants and big enterprises, the 
food supply chain stopped. They have 
excess food. I know dairy farmers in 
Michigan; it breaks their hearts to 
think of the idea of dumping milk 
when we need that. 
So the efforts that are in this bill 
will help them be able to move from a 
bulk supply chain to be able to get gal-
lon jugs, put the milk into the hands of 
families, and stop the wasting of pre-
cious, valuable food that our families 
need. This is going to help farmers’ 
bottom lines, and it feeds families in 
need. 
Our agriculture provisions also pro-
vide critical funding for PPE for farm-
workers and workers who labor every 
day in food processing plants so we 
have the food that we need—protective 
equipment that they need and that 
they deserve. 
The plan also targets help for farm-
ers of color who have been hit espe-
cially hard by the pandemic, on top of 
the historical challenges and discrimi-
nation they have faced in accessing 
land and capital. The plan provides 
critical debt relief to help them weath-
er the storm and keep their operations 
going until the next growing season. 
Vaccinating 
Americans, 
providing 
economic help for families, getting our 
children back to school safely, those 
are the three main goals of this plan. 
All of these goals have one thing in 
common: It is about investing in peo-
ple. It is about putting people first— 
the American people first. Over our Na-
tion’s history, the policies that have 
truly been lifting people out of poverty 
and moved them forward have invested 
in people, from our land grant univer-
sities to social security and Medicare 
and Medicaid, to the Civil Rights Act, 
to the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram, to increasing the minimum 
wage. And these are all policies, I am 
proud to say, created and supported by 
Democrats. 
Investing in our people helps Amer-
ican families, and it helps our economy 
too. We have seen these Democratic 
policies create more jobs when you 
look at the numbers. When we look at 
the numbers, under which policies and 
which Presidents have we seen more 
good-paying jobs? And over and over 
again it is Democratic Presidents be-
cause of the way that we invest. It is 
what we do, how we invest, to create 
opportunity to give everybody a fair 
shot to succeed, to invest in people and 
opportunity. Those things have created 
better economies and more jobs. 
So, broadly, we are committed to 
making sure everyone shares in the 
prosperity of our country, and these 
policies create the conditions nec-
essary to help people dream big dreams 
and actually achieve them. 
It is a new year. It is a new Congress. 
It is time to act. It is time to end this 
pandemic, give families the economic 
support they need, and get our children 
safely back to school. This is the mo-
ment. This is the moment we need to 
think big. We need to be bold. We need 
to lean in on policies that we know 
work—because they have worked be-
fore. 
Americans know how to meet the 
moment, and our moment is now. 
I yield the floor. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. President, 50 million 
Americans, including 17 million chil-
dren, are facing food insecurity because 
of this public health and economic cri-
sis, with Black and Latino families 
more likely to go hungry. In New Mex-
ico, one in three children and one in 
five adults are at risk of hunger. In the 
wealthiest country in the world, this is 
simply unacceptable. 
The budget resolution focuses on get-
ting relief to the people who need it 
most, beginning with an extension of 
the 15-percent increase in supplemental 
nutrition assistance benefits through 
September of 2021. Increasing SNAP 
benefits has proven to be one of the 
most effective forms of economic stim-
ulus, and it has the dual benefit of al-
lowing families to purchase the food 
that they need to stay healthy, as well 
as supporting businesses that accept 
SNAP dollars. 
The budget resolution also bolsters 
the WIC Program to ensure that chil-
dren and their mothers have access to 
a nutritious diet necessary for healthy 
development, an important investment 
in the future of our country. This fund-
ing increase is especially significant 
for States like New Mexico, where 
nearly a quarter of children are born 
into families with incomes that fall 
below the Federal poverty line. 
In addition to addressing hunger, this 
resolution includes critical support for 
the people who grow our food, produce 
our food—our farmers and ranchers. In 
New Mexico, farmers and ranchers, who 
were already struggling due to drought 
conditions, face new challenges due to 
COVID–19. Shuttered restaurants left 
chile growers and dairy farmers with-
out their customer base and scram-
bling to find new markets. Ranchers 
experienced long delays at meat pack-
ing plants where workers were hard hit 
by COVID–19. Those workers need help 
too. The pandemic also made it harder 
to find workers to cultivate the land 
and tend to the animals. 
This resolution also supports a provi-
sion I advocated for to provide debt re-
lief for minority and disadvantaged 
farmers and ranchers who did not re-
ceive their fair share of COVID relief 
under the last administration. 
It is said that societies are judged by 
how they treat their most vulnerable. 
It is sad because not everybody opens 
their eyes to see how this should be 
measured. 
The Senate must act for the families 
and children facing hunger and for our 
hard-working farmers and ranchers— 
those that are producing food, picking 
food, preparing food, and getting it to 
market and stocking the shelves. 
We must pass this budget resolution.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS PBS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate Arkansas Public 
Broadcasting Service, PBS, for its tre-
mendous work to provide educational 
resources throughout the COVID–19 
health crisis. 
Arkansas PBS was recently recog-
nized with five national Public Media 
Awards from the National Education 
Telecommunications 
Association, 
NETA, including honors for overall ex-
cellence for the programing it provided 
to children, parents, and teachers 
through Arkansas AMI, Alternative 
Methods of Instructions. 
As the COVID–19 emergency pro-
gressed in March 2020, Arkansas PBS 
upended its weekday schedule and 
began broadcasting streamlined, cur-
riculum-based programming for chil-
dren from Pre-K through eighth grade. 
When schools first closed in Arkan-
sas, educators were immediately chal-
lenged by the lack of internet access in 
many rural areas of the State. This 
made the Arkansas AMI project even 
more important. For many without

computers at home, the programming 
provided by Arkansas PBS became 
their classroom. 
I am proud of the partnership be-
tween Arkansas PBS and the Arkansas 
Department of Education, which of-
fered students a way to keep learning 
when they couldn’t be at school. This 
effort was possible because of a long-
standing 
relationship 
between 
the 
broadcast network and education offi-
cials who have worked together for 
many years. With a strong foundation 
in place, they were quickly and cre-
atively able to pivot and provide class-
room learning on a network of stations 
that reached 76 percent of the State 
with a simple over-the-air signal. The 
programming was also available on 
cable and satellite, live-streaming, on- 
demand, and various apps that families 
could access on mobile devices. 
I am proud of these devoted Arkan-
sans who rose to meet an incredible 
challenge, and I am grateful for the 
work they do every day to make edu-
cation in our State a priority. This rec-
ognition from the NETA is a testament 
to its commitment to offering quality 
educational, informative, and enter-
taining content that benefits the peo-
ple of Arkansas. We appreciate the 
hard-working staff of Arkansas PBS 
and celebrate their accomplishments 
which reflect so well on the organiza-
tion and its service to our State.∑

RECOGNIZING 70 YEARS OF KRVN 
∑ Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I 
would like to take a moment to recog-
nize the 70th anniversary of KRVN, a 
longtime Nebraska radio station. 
KRVN was founded in 1951 to bring 
the news to Nebraska’s rural commu-
nities, and they have remained com-
mitted to that mission throughout 
their existence. 
From the very beginning, Nebraska’s 
farmers and ranchers have depended on 
their straightforward approach to the 
stories that matter most, and their 
outstanding reporting continues to be 
a crucial part of our agriculture indus-
try’s success. 
As everyone who has listened to 
KRVN knows, they have achieved 70 
years of success because they put their 
audience first. That is no accident— 
KRVN is one of the only radio stations 
in the country that is owned by a coop-
erative of farmers and ranchers. 
As a cattle rancher myself, my fam-
ily, friends, and neighbors have lis-
tened to their daily livestock reports 
for decades, and I always enjoy stop-
ping by their studios when I am in Lex-
ington, NE. 
As a lifelong Nebraskan, I am im-
mensely proud of all they have done for 
our State. 
I congratulate them on reaching this 
historic milestone. Here is to 70 more 
years.∑

REMEMBERING PAUL CHARLES 
WESCH 
∑ Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life of Paul Charles 
Wesch of Mobile, AL, who passed away 
on December 27, 2020. He will be long 
remembered for his vast knowledge of 
finance, law, and business, and for his 
commitment to his community. 
Paul was born in Seattle, WA, on No-
vember 
20, 
1954. 
He 
grew 
up 
in 
Hunstville, AL, where he graduated 
from Butler High School in 1973. He 
went on to earn two undergraduate de-
grees, a law degree, and later a LL.M 
degree in taxation from the University 
of Alabama. Upon graduation from law 
school in 1980, he accepted a position 
with Stanard and Mills law firm in Mo-
bile. In 1984, Paul joined The Mitchell 
Company as a real estate developer, 
where he worked for nearly 30 years. 
During his tenure at The Mitchell 
Company, he served as executive vice 
president, general counsel, and direc-
tor. Paul was later appointed in 2013 by 
Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson to be 
the city’s executive finance director. A 
few years later, in 2016, he became 
Mayor Stimpson’s chief of staff while 
continuing to serve as finance director. 
In 
addition 
to 
his 
professional 
achievements, Paul previously served 
as chairman of the Mobile County Re-

river segments in the State of Oregon

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing the River Democracy 
Act of 2021, to add 4,702 miles of rivers 
and streams in Oregon to the national 
Wild and Scenic Rivers system to pro-
tect the recreational opportunities, 
clean drinking water, fish, and wildlife

February 3, 2021 
habitat that they provide from harmful 
activities. 
Oregon’s 110,994 miles of rivers and 
streams are an invaluable part of Or-
egon’s livability and an irreplaceable 
resource that must remain intact for 
future generations. Currently, Oregon 
has only protected 2% (2,173 miles) of 
rivers and streams under the national 
Wild and Scenic Rivers system—includ-
ing gems like the Rogue and Deschutes 
Rivers and many other iconic salmon 
and steelhead streams. 
Our rivers and streams are Oregon’s 
lifeblood—they provide clean drinking 
water to millions of Oregonians, sus-
tain our thriving outdoor recreation 
economy, nurture the salmon and 
steelhead that fuel our important com-
mercial and recreational fishing indus-
tries, and help maintain the quality of 
life that brings new investments, busi-
nesses, and jobs to our state. Oregon’s 
outdoor recreation industry is an eco-
nomic engine in Oregon. According to 
the Outdoor Recreation Industry, it 
supports 224,000 jobs and generates $15.6 
billion in economic activity. Healthy 
rivers are the foundation for Oregon’s 
outdoor recreation economy. 
With the climate crisis worsening, 
access to clean and safe drinking water 
has perhaps never been more impor-
tant. America’s Wild and Scenic Rivers 
Act aims to protect and preserve the 
character of our nation’s most impor-
tant rivers while balancing recreation, 
multiple use, habitat, and conserva-
tion. It encourages public participation 
in developing goals for river protec-
tion, and helps safeguard important 
waterways as a legacy for future gen-
erations. 
While I am proud that Oregon has 
2,173 miles of protected Wild and Sce-
nic Rivers, it is still a small fraction of 
Oregon’s total river mileage. 
On October 2, 2019, I began a public 
process to solicit recommendations 
from Oregonians on rivers and streams 
that deserve protection under the na-
tional Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. I 
held several open-to-all public meet-
ings specifically to hear from Orego-
nians and gather feedback. The topic 
has also come up at most townhalls 
I’ve since held. Since then, nearly 2,500 
Oregonians submitted over 15,000 nomi-
nations. 
I called on Oregonians to help me de-
velop new legislation to protect Or-
egon’s rivers and they, clearly and 
loudly, responded. Whether they were a 
whitewater rafter, a brewer, an elemen-
tary school science student, an angler 
or simply an Oregonian who believes 
strongly 
in 
protecting 
rivers 
or 
streams that provide safe drinking 
water to their community, they had 
the chance to speak up for their favor-
ite 
rivers 
and 
highlight 
the 
out-
standing values that make each river 
worthy of protection. 
Today, I am continuing the effort to 
protect rivers and streams, drinking 
water, recreation opportunities, and 
fish and wildlife habitat. The River De-
mocracy Act represents the best of the 
Oregon Way—when every Oregonian 
had the chance to nominate their fa-
vorite river or stream worthy of pro-
tection under America’s Wild and Sce-
nic Rivers Act. Ultimately, this is the 
starting point for future conversations 
about river conservation in Oregon. 
Based on the suggestions of Orego-
nians, the River Democracy Act would 
add 4,702 miles of rivers and streams in 
Oregon to the national Wild and Scenic 
Rivers system with the goals of cre-
ating a flexible land management tool 
that expands recreation access, pro-
tects drinking water, reduces wildfire 
threats, maintains cultural and his-
toric land management practices, and 
sustains endangered fish and wildlife 
species. 
The bill requires federal land man-
agers to assess wildfire risks in Wild 
and Scenic River corridors, implement 
a plan to reduce wildfire risks to homes 
and businesses near Wild and Scenic 
Rivers, assist local governments to 
mitigate wildfire risks, and restore 
water quality should a fire strike near 
a Wild and Scenic River. 
The River Democracy Act encourages 
Federal land managers to develop river 
management plans in collaboration 
with Native American tribes, and en-
sures Tribes have a say in how rivers

property rights, water rights, and ex-
isting permits and rights of way on 
Federal lands.

Oregonians know their rivers provide 
more than just electricity. They are 
the spawning grounds for some of the 
nation’s richest runs of salmon and 
steelhead. They provide extraordinary 
trout fishing and unparalleled recre-
ation. They are the source of safe, 
clean and delicious drinking water. Or-
egon’s rivers are, most of all, an impor-
tant part of our very special quality of 
life that needs to be preserved for fu-
ture generations of Oregonians.

ties 
with 
Russian 
Federation 
President 
Vladimir Putin since the early 2000s; 
Whereas Yevgeniy Prigozhin is the pre-
sumed financier of the Wagner Group, also 
known as the Private Military Company 
(PMC) Wagner, a Russian mercenary organi-
zation staffed by current and former mili-
tary and intelligence officers, and is the fin-
ancier of the Internet Research Agency and 
other organizations engaged in online influ-
ence operations; 
Whereas entities such as Wagner have been 
linked to the Government of the Russian 
Federation and are used to conduct military 
action, 
subversive 
operations, 
and 
disinformation campaigns on the Govern-
ment’s behalf while giving it an appearance 
of plausible deniability; 
Whereas the Wagner Group was involved in 
the Russian Federation’s military takeover 
and illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea 
region in February and March 2014, and in 
the subsequent insurgencies in the eastern 
Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk; 
Whereas the Wagner Group has been pro-
viding military support to the regime of 
Bashar al-Assad in Syria since 2015, fighting 
alongside its forces and helping it recapture 
significant parts of the country; 
Whereas, on February 7, 2018, the Wagner 
Group led an armed assault on United States 
troops near the city of Deir al-Zour in east-
ern Syria, prompting a United States coun-
terattack, in what the Washington Post has 
described as ‘‘the deadliest United States- 
Russia clash since the Cold War’’; 
Whereas the Wagner Group has sent merce-
naries, artillery, tanks, drones, and ammuni-
tion to Libya in violation of a United Na-
tions arms embargo; 
Whereas a United Nations report made 
public on May 6, 2020, concluded that the 
Wagner Group has operated up to 1,200 mili-
tary contractors in Libya, including snipers 
and specialized military teams, serving ‘‘as 
an effective force multiplier’’ for Khalifa 
Haftar’s Libyan National Army; 
Whereas Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his affili-
ated entities have been tied to influence op-
erations on behalf of the Government of the 
Russian Federation in Africa, with entities 
associated with Prigozhin reportedly oper-
ating in at least 20 countries, including the 
Central African Republic, Madagascar, Mo-
zambique, and Sudan; 
Whereas about 235 Russian military and 
private security personnel have deployed to 
the Central African Republic since 2017, some 
of whom are reportedly employed by the 
Wagner Group, and some of whom provide 
personal security for President Faustin- 
Archange Touade´ra; 
Whereas Russian national Valery Zak-
harov, who is reportedly a former intel-
ligence official, has served as a top national 
security advisor to Central African Republic 
President Faustin-Archange Touade´ra since 
at least 2018; 
Whereas, in July 2018, Russian journalists 
Orkhan Dzhemal, Kirill Radchenko, and 
Alexander Rastorguyev were murdered in the 
Central African Republic while working on a 
documentary about the activities of the 
Wagner Group in that country; 
Whereas neither the Government of the 
Central African Republic nor the Govern-
ment of the Russian Federation are con-
ducting credible and thorough investigations 
into the murder of these 3 journalists; 
Whereas, according to an investigation by 
the London-based Dossier Center, the jour-
nalists had been tracked by officers of the 
Central African Republic gendarmerie who 
were in close communication with Russian 
nationals with ties to Prigozhin, including 
Alexander Sotov, who in turn was reportedly 
in contact with Zakharov; 
Whereas companies owned by Yevgeniy 
Prigozhin reportedly had made regular pay-
ments to senior Central African Republic of-
ficials, including the Police Chief and the 
Minister of National Security; 
Whereas, on December 20, 2016, the Depart-
ment of the Treasury designated Yevgeniy 
Prigozhin 
under 
Executive 
Order 
13661, 
‘‘Blocking Property of Additional Persons 
Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine,’’ 
‘‘for having materially assisted, sponsored, 
or provided financial, material, or techno-
logical support for, or goods or services in 
support of, senior officials of the Russian 
Federation’’; 
Whereas, on June 20, 2017, the Department 
of the Treasury designated the Wagner 
Group under Executive Order 13660, ‘‘Block-
ing Property of Certain Persons Contrib-
uting to the Situation in Ukraine,’’ ‘‘for 
being responsible for or complicit in, or hav-
ing engaged in, directly or indirectly, ac-
tions or policies that threaten the peace, se-
curity, stability, sovereignty, or territorial 
integrity of Ukraine’’; 
Whereas, on March 15, 2018, the Depart-
ment of the Treasury designated Yevgeniy 
Prigozhin, his affiliated entities, including 
the Internet Research Agency, and his subor-
dinates under Executive Order 13694, ‘‘Block-
ing the Property of Certain Persons Engag-
ing in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled 
Activities,’’ for being ‘‘involved in inter-
fering with [United States] election proc-
esses or institutions’’; 
Whereas, on February 16, 2018, the Depart-
ment of Justice announced the indictment of 
Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his affiliated enti-
ties, including the Internet Research Agen-
cy, for engaging in ‘‘operations to interfere 
with the United States political system, in-
cluding the 2016 United States presidential 
election’’ and conducting ‘‘information war-
fare’’ against the United States; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2018, the De-
partment of State added Prigozhin, his affili-
ated entities, including the Internet Re-
search Agency, and the Wagner Group to the 
list of persons identified as part of, or oper-
ating for or on behalf of, the defense or intel-
ligence sectors of the Government of the 
Russian Federation under section 231 of the 
Countering America’s Adversaries Through 
Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9525); 
Whereas, on September 30, 2019, under Ex-
ecutive Order 13848, the Department of the 
Treasury took additional steps to increase 
pressure on Prigozhin by designating phys-
ical assets—3 aircraft and a yacht—and 3 as-
sociated front companies of his; 
Whereas, on February 15, 2019, Gavin 
Williamson, then-United Kingdom Defense 
Secretary, said that the ‘‘clandestine use of 
proxies, mercenary armies like the infamous 
and unaccountable Wagner Group, allows the 
Kremlin to get away with murder while de-
nying the blood on their hands’’; 
Whereas, on December 13, 2018, John 
Bolton, then-Assistant to the President for 
National Security Affairs, affirmed that ‘‘the 
predatory practices pursued by China and 
Russia. . . in Africa. . . pose a significant 
threat to United States national security in-
terests’’; and 
Whereas General Stephen J. Townsend, 
Commander of the United States Africa 
Command, on April 2, 2019, expressed great 
‘‘concern’’ about the Wagner group, and, on 
January 30, 2020, noted that private military 
contractors such as Wagner, are ‘‘leading the 
fight in Libya against the UN-backed and 
U.S.-recognized Government of National Ac-
cord’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the activities of Russian national 
Yevgeniy Prigozhin, his affiliated entities, 
and the Wagner Group pose a threat to the 
national interests and national security of 
the United States allies and partners of the 
United States around the world; and 
(2) the President, in addition to maintain-
ing sanctions on Yevgeniy Prigozhin, his af-
filiated entities, and the Wagner Group, 
should— 
(A) work with Congress to develop and exe-
cute a strategy drawing on the multiple in-
struments of United States national power 
available to the President, to counter the 
malign influence and activities of Prigozhin, 
the entities linked to him, and the Wagner 
Group; and 
(B) coordinate that strategy with inter-
national partners, while exhorting them to 
strengthen sanctions against Prigozhin and 
his entities and explore new avenues for 
curbing his destabilizing activities.

Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. CRAMER, and Ms. ERNST) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 31 
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘JCPOA’’) was agreed to in July 2015 by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, the United States, 
and 5 other major world powers, and was for-
mally adopted in October 2015; 
Whereas in October 2015, Iran conducted a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S323 
February 3, 2021 
(2) the IAEA verified that Iran had started 
to install advanced centrifuges that exceeds 
the permitted amount under the JCPOA; 
Whereas in November 2019— 
(1) the IAEA verified that Iranian techni-
cians began to enrich uranium up to 4.5 per-
cent, which is greater than the JCPOA limit 
of 3.67 percent; and 
(2) Iran breached the heavy water stockpile 
cap that was imposed by the JCPOA; and 
Whereas in January 2021, Iran started in-
stalling equipment for the production of ura-
nium metal, which violates the JCPOA: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) urges the President not to return the 
United States to the JCPOA unless— 
(A) the JCPOA is revised to verifiably and 
permanently remove Iran’s ability to de-
velop nuclear weapons and produce ballistic 
missiles; 
(B) the JCPOA is revised to require Iran to 
eliminate its nuclear infrastructure because 
Iranian ability to enrich uranium (even if en-
richment is ostensibly for peaceful purposes) 
inevitably leads to a nuclear weapons capa-
ble regime and spurs proliferation in the re-
gion; 
(C) Israel and other United States allies in 
the Middle East are consulted and their 
views are incorporated into the revised 
JCPOA; 
(D) Iran is required to refrain from spon-
soring, aiding, or abetting terrorist proxies 
and militias; 
(E) international inspectors are provided 
with unlimited and immediate access to any 
suspect enrichment or weaponization site; 
and 
(F) Iran— 
(i) verifiably and completely reveals all of 
its undeclared nuclear activities discovered 
in the ‘‘Iran Nuclear Archives’’ and pub-
licized in April 2018; and 
(ii) ceases to develop missiles capable of 
carrying nuclear warheads; 
(2) 
strongly 
recommends 
that 
United 
States sanctions against the Iranian regime 
remain in place until Iran has complied with 
all the elements of the revised JCPOA; and 
(3) condemns any attempt by the President 
to circumvent Congress on this issue.

SEC. llll. SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING 
TO REJECTING EFFORTS TO PURSUE 
A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL GOVERNMENT 
RUN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
(1) Medicare for All, Medicare ‘‘buy-in’’, 
and the so-called ‘‘public option’’ are all one- 
size-fits-all government run health care sys-
tems. 
(2) Approaches such as Medicare for All, 
Medicare ‘‘buy-in’’, and the so-called ‘‘public 
option’’ would fail to protect the Medicare 
program under title XVIII of the Social Se-
curity Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) since, ac-
cording to the Congressional Budget Office, 
the Medicare program will be officially 
bankrupt in 2024, at which time Medicare 
will no longer be able to pay full benefits to 
seniors and the disabled. 
(3) According to one leading economist, 
Medicare for All would increase costs to the 
Federal 
Government 
by 
an 
additional 
$38,000,000,000,000 and require significant tax 
increases 
on 
hard-working, 
middle-class 
Americans in order to fund this massive new 
program spending. 
(4) 60 percent of women in the United 
States under the age of 65 are covered by 
health insurance obtained on the job, and 
would be unfairly targeted by these govern-
ment-centered approaches. 
(5) Under a one-size-fits-all government 
run health care system— 
(A) more than 180,000,000 Americans cov-
ered by health insurance obtained on the job 
would lose their health insurance coverage; 
(B) if you like your current health insur-
ance plan, you will lose it; 
(C) government bureaucrats would be put 
in charge of deciding which procedures and 
drugs would be covered; 
(D) Americans would face increased wait- 
times or be forced to seek care outside of 
their communities, especially in rural and 
underserved areas, because of hospital clo-
sures 
resulting 
from 
a 
government-run 
health care system; 
(E) Americans would lack access to the lat-
est prescription drug therapies and medical 
device innovations, due to government price- 
controls similar to those imposed in the 
United Kingdom and Canada; and 
(F) the longstanding, bipartisan tradition 
of protecting Federal taxpayer dollars from 
funding abortions could be eliminated. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) Medicare for All, or any one-size-fits-all 
government run health care system, would— 
(A) eliminate private insurance that hun-
dreds of millions of Americans currently uti-
lize; 
(B) increase costs on middle-class families; 
(C) lead to delays in accessing care; 
(D) raid the Medicare program; and 
(E) result in hospital closures and a loss of 
access to health care services in rural Amer-
ica amidst the COVID–19 pandemic; and 
(2) efforts to enact such a proposal should 
be rejected.

amendment intended to be proposed by

BRIAN SICKNICK FUNERAL 
HON. DAN CRENSHAW 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, another 
hero laid to rest here in Arlington Cemetery. I 
know this place well. Some of my dearest 
friends are here. 
This is a place for America’s best. It is not 
just that these men and women are heroes, of 
course they are, it is that they are our best. 
And in my experience, we always seem to 
lose the best of us. 
Brian lived with purpose. He lived asking 
what he could do for his country, for his com-
munity, and small animals. Sandra tells me he 
was the type of guy that would get out of the 
car and run across the parking lot to move a 
small turtle to safety. He was a real man, be-
cause real men are comfortable owning two 
small Dachshunds, as Brian did. I am not say-
ing that just because I also have two small 
Dachshunds, I am saying it because it’s true. 
Real men don’t need to prove anything with 
big dogs. 
Everyone has purpose in this life, I firmly 
believe that. You’re here for a reason. But not 
enough of us act as if that is true. Brian did. 
He lived for his family, his mother, Gladys, 
his father, Charles, his brothers, Ken and 
Craig, and his girlfriend, Sandra. He joined the 
Air Force with a mission to serve our nation’s 
defense. He lived for others. After he was in-
jured on January 6th he spent his last remain-
ing hours texting fellow officers and checking 
in on them. People needed Brian, because he 
was a good man, because he was one of our 
best. 
There is another common thread that links 
those buried here at Arlington with Brian. 
These are protectors. These are the men and 
women that stand in the breach. That gap be-
tween the helpless and the aggressor, be-
tween right and wrong, between good and 
evil. 
Many like to think they too could stand in 
that gap, but they’d be wrong. So many these 
days think they know better, think they could 
do it better, and they’ll be the first to tell you 
so. 
But this job is not for the weak and loud, it 
is for the strong and silent. It is for the brave, 
those like Brian that quietly and professionally 
carry out their duty. Because that gap that 
they stand in isn’t always so clear. It’s messy. 
It’s complicated. It’s not always obvious what 
is right and what is wrong, who the victims 
are, or who is good or bad. 
And so, we take our best, and we say go 
forth and stand in the breach and figure it out. 
Be there to make those split-second choices 
so that we don’t have to. Be there to keep our 
families safe so that we don’t have to. Go 
overseas and make sure the enemy doesn’t 
come here so that we don’t have to. 
You be there, and the rest of us will be here 
waiting, to judge you and second guess you. 
We ask them to do the impossible, we don’t 
even ask that nicely, and they do it with pride 
and with honor. 
If I may be so bold as to guess what Brian 
might have asked of us. I think that he, and 
the heroes buried here with him, might simply 
ask us all to be better. I think they appreciate 
our gratitude and our deference to their mem-
ory, but I think most of all they just want us 
to be better. 
And I don’t mean trying to make others bet-
ter, or even our country better. I mean I think 
they want us to start with ourselves. To make 
ourselves better. Because that is in fact the 
hard work. 
He might ask us to ask ourselves what went 
so wrong—in our country and in our hearts— 
that fellow Americans did what they did to 
Brian on that day. He might ask us to reflect 
for a moment before we lash out at each 
other, before we blame, before we chastise, 
before we judge, before we lose patience. He 
might ask us to recall that the greatness of the 
American spirit lies in a sense of responsi-
bility, of accountability, and perhaps a bit of 
appreciation for freedom. 
Being better means decency. It means citi-
zenship. Living with the duty that Brian exem-
plified. It means running toward danger not 
because there is glory in doing so but be-
cause you must. It means trying to live up to 
the memory of the heroes buried here, to be 
worthy of their sacrifice. 
This past year has been a low point, no 
doubt, but it is men like Brian that remind us 
of the grit and tenacity and good character 
that America was built on. He may not be with 
us anymore, but if we are to honor him then 
we should do so by using his memory as a re-
minder of what this country can be. 
A reminder that there are indeed more like 
him. A reminder that the bravery and love in-
side of Brian Sicknick is not peculiar to him, 
but part of the American DNA. A reminder that 
our duty is to make these heroes proud, prove 
to them that their sacrifice was for a country 
worth sacrificing for. That we are a people 
worth sacrificing for. With men like Brian 
standing in the gap, it is hard to imagine that 
we are not. 
This is still the greatest country on earth. 
This is still the great American experiment that 
has done more good for mankind than any 
other civilization in history. We will not forget 
that fact just because times are hard. We will 
persevere and strive to be better and do jus-
tice to the memory of those buried here. 
May Officer Brian Sicknick rest easy here 
on these hallowed grounds. He is in good 
company. He has undoubtedly earned his 
place here amongst America’s best. God bless 
him. God bless this great country. 
Never Forget. 
HONORING OFFICER ADAM TACK 
HON. TOM RICE 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
South Carolinian, Officer Adam Tack of the 
Horry County Police Department. 
Last night, Officer Tack was awarded the 
Law Enforcement Officer of the Year Award. 
Officer Tack puts his life at risk daily while up-
holding his oath to protect his community. He 
is a true hero. 
September 17, 2020, Officer Tack saved the 
lives of Liam and Levi Cannon trapped in a 
car sinking in the floodwaters of Hurricane 
Sally. He dove in the water and using his 
baton broke the window to pull the two chil-
dren from the car. Tack only had minor inju-
ries and all five Cannon family members sur-
vived. 
Madam Speaker, I join the people of Horry 
County in recognizing Officer Adam Tack. We 
thank him for his service and commitment to 
our community.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
COMMISSION 
ON 
AN 
OPEN SOCIETY WITH SECURITY 
ACT OF 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the United States Commission on an 
Open Society with Security Act of 2021, which 
would create a commission to investigate how 
we can maintain our democratic traditions 
while actively responding to the real and sub-
stantial threats posed by foreign and domestic 
terrorism. 
The impetus for this commission was born 
after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, 
grew in importance after the terrorist attacks 
on September 11, 2001, and has reached 
peak urgency since the insurrectionist attack 
on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. The 
succession of tragic events endured by our 
nation has led to a series of sweeping security 
increases that are deemed both necessary 
and temporary in the moment but create last-
ing security infrastructure that is difficult to dis-
mantle and infringes on our open, democratic 
society. 
We must acknowledge and accept that we 
have entered into an era of constant internal 
and external threats, requiring ever-higher lev-
els of security for our people and public 
spaces. What we thought would be a tem-
porary infringement on our open society has 
turned into a permanent restriction on how our 
citizens interact with each other and our 
democratic institutions. Because emergencies

February 3, 2021 
typically dictate security decisions, essential 
discussions on the proper balance between 
national security, individual rights and the free-
doms enjoyed in an open society have been 
repeatedly deferred. 
My bill would ensure that this long overdue 
discussion takes place in a public forum with 
experts drawn from across the spectrum. To 
date, security planning has been delegated al-
most exclusively to security, intelligence and 
military experts. Although their input is indis-
pensable, they cannot be expected to accu-
rately consider the externalities that lie outside 
of their expertise. To strike a better balance 
that gives sufficient importance to our demo-
cratic traditions, we need to invite experts from 
diverse fields to the same table to work to-
gether. Therefore, the commission would be 
composed not only of security, intelligence 
and military experts, but also experts from 
such fields as business, architecture, tech-
nology, law, city planning, art, engineering, 
philosophy, history, sociology and psychology. 
We have used commissions before to deep-
ly investigate and address unprecedented 
challenges, such as the National Commission 
on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States 
(also known as the 9/11 Commission), the 
Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of 
the United States Regarding Weapons of 
Mass Destruction (also known as the Silber-
man Robb Commission) and the Kerner Com-
mission following riots that swept American cit-
ies in the 1960s. The commission created by 
this bill would seek to avert a crisis in basic 
freedoms before their infringement becomes 
entrenched. We cannot allow security proto-
cols to proliferate without informed civilian 
oversight and a thorough analysis of alter-
natives that might better safeguard freedom 
and commerce. 
Furthermore, we have had decades to de-
velop strategies and technologies for smarter 
security that can fulfill the responsibility of 
safety without depriving our citizens of access 
to institutions and personal liberty. Thus far, 
we have either relied on imprecise medieval 
approaches like crude barriers or on over-
expansive new technologies that treat privacy 
like a privilege instead of a right. We can, and 
must, do better. 
As the home of our federal government, the 
District of Columbia’s residents have suffered 
a disproportionate infringement on public 
spaces, personal rights and freedoms in the 
name of security. Public spaces that serve as 
the heart of our local communities have be-
come restricted zones characterized by a 
heavy security presence, with individuals liable 
to be reprimanded for walking on the wrong 
side of the street or marveling too long at the 
architecture. Barriers such as walls and fences 
are touted as essential security features while 
our citizens are left peering at their democracy 
from a distance. 
Security is not only about reducing lives lost 
and dollars cost. It is also about safeguarding 
the institutions, freedoms and values that an-
chor our country, not only for ourselves but for 
future generations. The social compact be-
tween government and the people should not 
be the result of a series of hostage negotia-
tions. We must resume reasoned and delib-
erative decision-making, beginning with a 
high-level commission composed of experts 
from diverse disciplines charged with devel-
oping a new course that will protect both our 
people and our precious democratic institu-
tions and traditions. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE DENTON 
RYAN FOOTBALL TEAM 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding perform-
ance of Denton ISD’s Ryan High School Foot-
ball Team, the Ryan Raiders, during the 2020 
football season. 
In the past year, the team’s prowess and 
exceptional 
diligence 
led 
them 
to 
an 
undefeated season, culminating in a victory at 
the Conference 5A Division 1 Championship 
on January 15, 2021. After facing an intense 
series of preliminary games, the Ryan Raiders 
finally secured the state title in their game 
against Cedar Park at Arlington’s AT&T sta-
dium. 
Led by head coach Dave Henigan, Defen-
sive MVP Ty Marsh, and Offensive MVP Seth 
Henigan, the team attained its first state 
championship victory since 2002. The exem-
plary commitment, teamwork, and effort dis-
played by the players, coaches, and coordina-
tors of the Ryan Raiders earned them the 
state title. 
The coaches and players of the Ryan High 
School Football Team overcame pressures 
and challenges amidst the COVID–19 pan-
demic and successfully achieved the pinnacle 
of their season. I am privileged to join their 
community, family and friends in celebrating 
their achievement and to recognize each and 
every one of them for their laudable devotion 
to their team and their sport. I wish them all 
the best in their future endeavors.

HONORING 
THE 
CAREER 
AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
CHIEF 
MICHAEL 
SURPRENANT 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker I rise 
today to honor the career of a consummate 
public servant—Chief Michael Surprenant of 
the Plainfield Police Department. A dedicated 
law enforcement officer, Chief Surprenant has 
served the town of Plainfield and the 2nd Con-
gressional District for over two decades. His 
tenure as Chief began in 2012 replacing Rob-
ert Hoffman, another role model of public serv-
ice. His character, dedication to the depart-
ment, and unwavering professionalism made 
him an ideal candidate for the role. 
Over the past nine years, Michael has ush-
ered in a new era for the department. Not only 
fighting for the safety and wellbeing of so 
many in his town, but fighting for the better-
ment of the department, making sure our first 
responders, who put their lives on the line 
every day, are given the encouragement and 
equipment they are rightfully due. Michael has 
always put his officers before himself and as 
leader of the force has never had an officer 
sustain a serious injury or fatality—a record for 
which he should be truly proud. Working as an 
officer through some of the most perilous mo-
ments in our nation’s history—9/11, Sandy 
Hook, and other domestic incidents—Michael 
has remained steadfast and composed in en-
suring that the department was trained and 
prepared to tackle various threats at a mo-
ment’s notice. 
With Michael’s years of experience as a pa-
trol office, deputy chief, graduate of the FBI’s 
National Academy, and recipient of the Medal 
of Excellence—Michael has been a beacon of 
wisdom within the department. Michael has 
strived to be a police chief that prioritized the 
wellbeing and safety of his residents above all 
else and has gone above and beyond to en-
sure that the department had the resources it 
needed. Michael has served as a role model 
for his fellow officers and has truly led by ex-
ample, and I am certain that his civic dedica-
tion will continue into the next chapter of his 
life. 
While Michael’s retirement is bittersweet, we 
know that he has groomed only the best to 
take his place. Madam Speaker, fellow col-
leagues—I ask you to join me in honoring Mi-
chael’s 25 years of service to the State of 
Connecticut and our nation, and in wishing 
him, his wife Kristyn, and their twin boys 
Jefferey and Luke—a safe and happy future.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF THE 
HONORABLE JUDGE PRESTON’S 
RETIREMENT 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the career of the Honorable Vernon 
L. Preston, Ohio Third District Court of Ap-
peals Judge, and recognize the outstanding 
work he has done for the State of Ohio. On 
February 8, 2021, Judge Preston will be retir-
ing after twenty-seven years of distinguished 
judicial service. His hard work and continued 
dedication to uphold the law and the Constitu-
tion is an example for all. 
Judge Preston was born and raised in Find-
lay, Ohio. After attending Findlay High School 
and the University of Findlay, he proudly 
served on active duty in the United States 
Navy for six years. He retired with the rank of 
Captain in 2003 after serving twenty-five addi-
tional years in the U.S. Navy Reserve. 
In 1980, Judge Preston graduated with a 
law degree from the University of Toledo. 
Upon graduation from law school, he opened 
a law practice in Portsmouth, Ohio. As a pri-
vate practice attorney, he specialized in ad-
ministrative and insurance law representing 
both individuals and business clients. Later, 
Judge Preston returned to Findlay where he 
served in a series of public service positions 
including Magistrate for the Findlay Municipal 
Court, Assistant Hancock County Prosecutor, 
and Assistant Findlay City Prosecutor. Before 
his appointment to the Third Court of Appeals 
in 2007, Judge Preston served on the Findlay 
Municipal Court Bench for thirteen years. In 
addition to his full-time schedule as a judge, 
he was an Adjunct Professor of Equine Law at 
the University of Findlay. 
Judge Preston’s work has had a lasting in-
fluence on our judicial system and a significant 
impact on his community. The citizens of Fifth 
District of Ohio join me in congratulating the 
Honorable Vernon Preston for his service to 
Ohio and our nation.

LUKE 
J. 
LETLOW 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of our friend and colleague, 
Congressman-elect Luke J. Letlow. I know I 
speak for all of my colleagues in Congress 
and for my family and staff when I express 
how deeply saddened and heartbroken we 
were to learn of the passing of Luke on De-
cember 30, 2020. We lost him far too early, 
and our thoughts and prayers are with his 
wife, Julia, and children, Jeremiah and Jac-
queline. 
Luke’s interest in public service began at a 
young age on a field trip to Washington, D.C. 
As a fifth grader visiting Arlington Cemetery, 
he was chosen to place the wreath on the 
tomb of the unknown soldier, and it was that 
moment that stuck with him for years to come. 
Understanding the ultimate sacrifices made by 
our men and women in uniform to protect the 
freedoms we enjoy as Americans inspired 
Luke. It was this inspiration that motivated him 
to fight for the principles that make America 
great during his time as chairman of the Lou-
isiana Tech College Republicans and the Lou-
isiana Federation of College Republicans. His 
passion for service continued after college as 
he served on the staffs of Congressman John 
Cooksey and Governor Bobby Jindal. A short 
time later, Luke returned to work in the office 
of Congressman Ralph Abraham, where he 
served as Chief of Staff for six years. Known 
as a servant’s servant, in 2020, Luke made 
the decision to launch a bid to replace his 
boss and represent the people of the Fifth 
Congressional District of Louisiana. 
After a successful campaign and election, 
Luke was looking forward to serving the peo-
ple of Louisiana in Congress, and we were ex-
cited to welcome him into our delegation. He 
was ready to make an even greater impact on 
our state and our nation. Luke’s favorite 
phrases were ‘‘win the day’’ and ‘‘go, fight, 
win,’’ which he was fully prepared to do when 
he was set to be sworn into the United States 
House of Representatives on January 3, 2021. 
We are saddened that we could not share that 
day with Luke and his family. 
While I wish I was standing here welcoming 
him to Congress, I rise today to honor all that 
Luke accomplished in his 41 years of life. He 
will be remembered in this chamber, in Lou-
isiana, and across the nation for his servant’s 
heart and the kindness he extended to all that 
had the chance to meet him. As Luke is look-
ing down at us from Heaven, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing and hon-
oring his life and accomplishments.

H. CON. RES. 11, CONCURRENT 
RESOLUTION 
ON 
THE 
BUDGET 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021; AND FOR 
OTHER PURPOSES 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, 
and as the Member of Congress for a con-
gressional district that has experienced the 
worst of COVID–19 as a public health emer-
gency and economic catastrophe, I rise in 
strong support of the rule governing debate on 
H.R. 447, the National Apprenticeship Act of 
2021, and H. Con. Res. 11, as well as the un-
derlying legislation. 
The National Apprenticeship Act has the po-
tential to yield $10.6 billion in net benefits to 
U.S. taxpayers in the form of increased work-
ers productivity and decreased spending on 
public-assistance programs and unemploy-
ment insurance and which bring America’s in-
vestments in apprenticeship more in line with 
countries around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation could not be 
more timely because during a time of record 
unemployment, the National Apprenticeship 
Act of 2021 creates an additional 1 million 
new apprenticeship opportunities and invests 
more than $3.5 billion over 5 years in expand-
ing opportunities and access to Registered 
Apprenticeships, youth apprenticeships, and 
pre-apprenticeships. 
I also strongly support H. Con. Res. 11 be-
cause it reorders budgetary priorities to pro-
vide $1.9 trillion to allow Congress to take im-
mediate and decisive action to crush the virus 
and vaccinate our people, build the economy 
back better, reopen schools, and provide 
needed support and assistance to state and 
local governments that have been asked to do 
too much with too little for far too long. 
Mr. Speaker, by an overwhelming margin 
(79 percent), the public wants and is demand-
ing that we act to provide more economic re-
lief to address the damage caused by the co-
rona virus pandemic. 
Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Repub-
licans and Republican-leaning independents 
believe an additional relief package is nec-
essary, while more than nine in ten (92 per-
cent) Democrats and Democratic leaners say 
more coronavirus aid will be needed. 
Even the most conservative Republicans 
favor more relief by a 56 percent–44 percent 
margin. 
Nearly nine-in-ten of all adults (88 percent) 
in lower-income households say an additional 
package is necessary, while 81 percent of Re-
publicans in lower-income households (81 per-
cent) say additional aid is needed now. 
Let me make clear at the outset, Mr. Speak-
er, that nothing in this resolution precludes the 
reaching of a bipartisan and bicameral agree-
ment to pass and fund the President’s Amer-
ica Rescue Plan, which in nearly all material 
respects mirrors the Heroes Act passed by the 
House Democratic majority on May 15, 2020, 
nearly nine months ago, only to languish on 
the Republican Senate Majority Leader’s desk 
while hundreds of thousands of our fellow 
Americans succumbed to the virus and mil-
lions of others lost their livelihoods and busi-
nesses, and everyone faced an uncertain fu-
ture. 
It would send a powerful signal to the Amer-
ican people if our colleagues across the aisle 
would join us in this effort because nothing 
would better show them that elected rep-
resentatives can put partisanship aside and 
put America first. 
And that bipartisan achievement would por-
tend success for similar initiatives in the area 
of infrastructure, energy, national and home-
land security, and criminal justice and immi-
gration reform, all of which I am ready and 
willing to reach across the aisle to find com-
mon ground. 
So if our Republican colleagues are ame-
nable to reaching an agreement on a legisla-
tive response that is commensurate to the 
challenge facing Americans, nothing in the 
legislation before will preclude that from hap-
pening. 
But have no doubt, if they refuse to be part 
of the solution, the unified and bicameral 
Democratic congressional majority, in coordi-
nation with the new Democratic Administra-
tion, will take the lead and act boldly to ad-
dress and overcome the present crisis. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor of 
West Virginia who said colorfully just a few 
days ago, ‘‘At this point in time in this nation, 
we need to go big. We need to quit counting 
the egg-sucking legs on the cows and count 
the cows and just move. And move forward 
and move right now.’’ 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
‘‘The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion 
is piled high with difficulty, and we must 
rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so 
we must think anew and act anew.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took 
last December was a step in the right direction 
but only a long-delayed down payment; we 
cannot afford any more delays, especially 
since Republican stalling already caused a 
painful lapse in critical unemployment assist-
ance last year, and additional unemployment 
assistance is set to expire in March. 
That why this resolution, which creates a 
failsafe alternative to debating, voting, and 
passing the American Rescue Act, is abso-
lutely crucial and the right thing to do, right 
now. 
The American Rescue Plan proposed by 
President Biden takes a multiprong approach 
to tackling the public health and economic cri-
ses stemming from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
To beat the virus and safely reopen schools, 
the plan will mount a national vaccination pro-
gram that includes setting up community vac-
cination sites nationwide and makes the in-
vestments necessary to safely reopen schools. 
It will also take complementary measures to 
combat the virus, including scaling up testing 
and tracing, addressing shortages of personal 
protective equipment and other critical sup-
plies, investing in high-quality treatments, and 
addressing health care disparities. 
The American Rescue Plan delivers imme-
diate relief to working families bearing the

brunt of the crisis by providing $1,400 per per-
son in direct cash assistance to households 
across America, bringing the total (including 
the $600 down payment enacted in Decem-
ber) to $2,000. 
Additionally, the plan will also provide direct 
housing and nutrition assistance to families 
struggling to get by, expand access to safe 
and reliable child care and affordable health 
care, extend and expand unemployment insur-
ance so American workers can pay their bills, 
and give families with children as well as 
childless workers a boost through enhanced 
tax credits. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan 
provides much needed support for commu-
nities struggling with the economic fallout, in-
cluding hard-hit small businesses, especially 
those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and 
ethnic backgrounds that have experienced 
systemic discrimination. 
Last, the plan also provides crucial re-
sources to protect the jobs of first responders, 
frontline public health workers, teachers, tran-
sit workers, and other essential workers that 
all Americans depend on. 
The 2021 budget resolution is not a com-
prehensive fiscal blueprint for the next 10 
years; it is designed solely to provide the op-
tion of using reconciliation to deliver critical re-
lief and achieve the goals of the American 
Rescue Plan. 
As such, the total spending and revenue 
levels in the resolution simply reflect current- 
law projections adjusted for the estimated 
costs of the American Rescue Plan. 
Once the American Rescue Plan becomes 
law, Congress will begin its work on a forward- 
looking, comprehensive budget resolution for 
2022 that will provide urgently needed eco-
nomic support and address longstanding defi-
cits in our communities and underlying inequi-
ties in our society, which have been so starkly 
revealed and exacerbated by COVID–19. 
Mr. Speaker, the Rule provides for the 
adoption of H. Res. 73, which authorizes and 
directs the Sergeant-at-Arms to fine Members, 
Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner for 
failure to complete security screening for en-
trance to the House Chamber. 
The Sergeant-at-Arms is authorized and di-
rected to impose a $5,000 fine against a 
Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commis-
sioner for the first offense of failing to com-
plete security screening for entrance to the 
House Chamber. 
The fine for this major breach of security 
shall be doubled to $10,000 for any subse-
quent offense and is to be paid from the per-
sonal funds of the Member, Delegate, or Resi-
dent Commission involved; neither the Mem-
ber Representational Allowance (MRA) or 
campaign funds may be used to satisfy any 
fine levied for entering the House Chamber 
without undergoing security screening. 
This is a common-sense measure to provide 
for the physical safety and security of Mem-
bers and staff, made all the more necessary 
by the horrific events of January 6, 2021, 
when the 45th President of the United States 
incited an insurrection against the United 
States by exhorting his mob of loyalists, many 
of whom were armed and wearing Kevlar 
vests, to storm the U.S. Capitol and lay siege 
to this Citadel of Democracy, and in the proc-
ess cause the deaths of at least six persons, 
one of whom was a uniformed officer to the 
United States Capitol Police, who was bludg-
eoned to death by the incited mob. 
I hope this is the first of many actions that 
must be taken by the Congress, including pro-
viding more resources and training to the 
United States Capitol Police, to increase the 
security and protect the sanctity of this sacred 
institution that has stood as a beacon of free-
dom and hope to people the world over for 
more than two centuries. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for its pas-
sage.

HOUSE RESOLUTION CALLING FOR 
THE 
ESTABLISHMENT 
OF 
THE 
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF VIRAL 
DISEASES 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce a House Resolution calling for the 
establishment of a new unit of the National In-
stitutes of Health (NIH), to be known as The 
National Institute of Viral Diseases, to increase 
federal research in the field of viral diseases. 
As viral diseases are unique to infectious dis-
eases, we must strengthen our scientific un-
derstanding and the government’s role in dis-
covering viral diseases causes, prevention and 
treatments. 
I am introducing this resolution to build upon 
our federal governments’ investment in sci-
entific research and to consider expanding the 
scope of NIH’s excellent work. Through my 
Appropriations Committee work across various 
subcommittees, I have become increasingly 
concerned that federal funding in the field of 
biomedical sciences in particular, has lagged 
behind the clinical work of NIH and the phys-
ical sciences of the National Science Founda-
tion. Research methodology takes a unique 
approach, and as our nation continues to 
grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, there 
is a need for more investment in biomedical 
research related to viral diseases. 
The benefits of federal funding for bio-
medical sciences can be seen beyond just the 
patients whose lives are saved. In 2012, Dr. 
Francis Collins the Director of the NIH cited 
data that shows for every $1 of NIH health re-
search funding, it returns $2.21 in goods and 
services in a single year. Additionally, accord-
ing to analysis by Families USA, every NIH 
grant generates an average of seven high- 
quality jobs. Investing in science pushes the 
boundaries of taxpayer dollars and delivers 
positive outcomes for consumers.

COMMENDING THE MEMBERS OF 
THE GEORGIA NATIONAL GUARD 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor and privilege to extend my heart-
felt thanks to the members of the Georgia Na-
tional Guard who were deployed to the District 
of Columbia and the National Capitol Region 
for the inauguration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr. as 
the 46th President of the United States and 
KAMALA D. HARRIS as the 49th Vice President 
of the United States. 
Since 1636, the National Guard has consist-
ently served the American people in much- 
needed roles that range from homeland de-
fense, overseas combat, humanitarian aid, 
and defense support for civil authorities. 
As all of us are aware, sustained military 
operations worldwide, coupled with declining 
numbers of active-duty personnel, have re-
quired the Department of Defense to rely more 
and more on the use of the Georgia National 
Guard. Following the violent and deadly at-
tempted coup at the United States Capitol on 
January 6, 2021, 2,284 members from the 1st 
and 2nd Battalions of the 121st Infantry Regi-
ment, 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of 
the Georgia National Guard, and the 116th 
and 165th Security Forces Squadrons of the 
Georgia Air National Guard selflessly arrived 
in Washington, D.C. in the midst of the 
COVID–19 pandemic—risking their health and 
safety in multiple ways to do their duty. Their 
mission was to aid and support the United 
States Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police 
Department of the District of Columbia, the 
United States Secret Service, the United 
States Park Police, and other Federal law en-
forcement agencies as they worked to keep 
our nation’s capital secure after its occupation 
by domestic terrorists. 
In keeping with the National Guard’s motto 
of ‘‘Always Ready, Always There,’’ these cit-
izen-soldiers from Georgia were committed 
and ready on a moment’s (short) notice to pro-
tect the U.S Capitol and ensure that there was 
a peaceful transfer of power on January 20 in 
response to their deployment orders. Thanks 
to these brave men and women from Georgia, 
there were no incidents of violence that threat-
ened the inaugural ceremonies. There is no 
doubt in my mind that their service prevented 
further loss of life and threats against our de-
mocracy. At one of our darkest times, the 
Georgia National Guard was there to protect 
America—from all enemies foreign or domes-
tic. 
Madam Speaker, I am very proud of the 
Georgia National Guard. Because of their 
service, the will of the People was honored, 
and the institutions of our government remain 
intact. I ask my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to join me and the people of 
Georgia, in extending our sincerest apprecia-
tion, pride, and utmost gratitude to the Geor-
gia National Guard, the Adjutant General of 
Georgia Thomas Carden, and his staff, for 
their outstanding work, morale, and dedication 
to duty during the inauguration.

state. In addition to directing administrative 
support, she was responsible for managing an 
extensive casework portfolio and overseeing 
Senatorial United States Service Academy 
nominations, 
In 2003, Ms. Smith would transition to the 
office of United States Congressman Jeb Hen-
sarling (TX–05), where she would assume the 
role of Senior Constituent Liaison. As part of 
her duties, Maggie maintained casework oper-
ations and fostered strategic relationships on 
behalf of the Congressman between federal 
agencies and community leaders. Maggie also 
managed a wide variety of programs and 
events while working alongside colleagues in 
both the Washington, D.C. and district offices. 
Following Congressman Hensarling’s retire-
ment in 2018, Maggie served the people of 
Texas’ Third Congressional District as a Sen-
ior Constituent Services Coordinator, where 
she would assist with casework and commu-
nity outreach across Collin County. During her 
time working for Congress, Maggie has been 
recognized as a respected professional, es-
teemed for her past efforts across the state. 
Now upon her retirement and as she begins 
a new season of life, I ask my colleagues in 
the United States House of Representatives to 
join me in recognizing Ms. Margaret Smith for 
her longtime service and to wish her well on 
her future endeavors.

WORLD SCIENTISTS’ WARNING OF 
A CLIMATE EMERGENCY 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, climate 
change is an existential threat to all of human-
ity, and it is essential that we start acting— 
now—to stop and reverse the destructive ef-
fects of climate change. 
In 2020, my constituent Oregon State Uni-
versity Professor Dr. William Ripple, and col-
leagues published ‘‘World Scientists’ Warning 
of a Climate Emergency’’ which has been en-
dorsed by more than 11,000 scientists from 
153 countries. They presented six trans-
formative steps we can take to effectively 
combat climate change. 
I urge my colleagues to read their report 
and join me in acting before it is too late. 
[From Bioscience, Jan. 2020] 
WORLD SCIENTISTS’ WARNING OF A CLIMATE 
EMERGENCY 
(By William J. Ripple, Christopher Wolf, 
Thomas M. Newsome, Phoebe Barnard, 
William R. Moomaw, and 11,092 scientist 
signatories from 153 countries) 
Scientists have a moral obligation to 
clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic 
threat and ‘tell it like it is.’ Based on this 
obligation and the data presented below, we 
herein proclaim, with more than 11,000 sci-
entist signatories from around the world, a 
clear and unequivocal declaration that a cli-
mate emergency exists on planet Earth. 
Exactly 40 years ago, scientists from 50 na-
tions met at the First World Climate Con-
ference (Geneva, 1979) and agreed that alarm-
ing trends for climate change made it ‘‘ur-
gently necessary’’ to act. Since then, similar 
alarms have been made through the 1992 Rio 
Summit, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the 2015 
Paris Agreement, as well as scores of other 
global assemblies and scientists’ explicit 
warnings of insufficient progress. Yet green-
house gas (GHG) emissions are still rising, 
with increasingly damaging effects on the 
Earth’s climate. An immense change of scale 
in endeavors to conserve our biosphere is 
needed to avoid untold suffering due to the 
climate crisis. 
Despite 40 years of global climate negotia-
tions, with few exceptions, we have generally 
conducted business as usual and have largely 
failed to address this predicament. The cli-
mate crisis has arrived and is accelerating 
faster than most scientists expected. It is 
more severe than anticipated, threatening 
natural ecosystems and the fate of human-
ity. Especially worrisome are potential cli-
mate tipping points and nature’s reinforcing 
feedbacks that could lead to a catastrophic 
‘‘Hothouse Earth’’ and cause significant dis-
ruptions to ecosystems, society, and econo-
mies, potentially making large areas of 
Earth uninhabitable. 
To secure a sustainable future, we must 
change how we live. Economic and popu-
lation growth are among the most important 
drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from 
fossil fuel combustion; thus, we need bold 
and drastic transformations regarding eco-
nomic and population policies. We suggest 
six critical and interrelated steps that gov-
ernments, businesses and the rest of human-
ity can take to lessen the worst effects of cli-
mate change. These are important steps, but 
are not the only actions needed or possible. 
1) Energy. The world must quickly imple-
ment massive energy efficiency and con-
servation practices, replace fossil fuels with 
low carbon renewables and other cleaner 
sources of energy. We should leave remain-
ing stocks of fossil fuels in the ground, and 
carefully pursue effective negative emissions 
using technology such as carbon extraction 
from the source and capture from the air, 
and by enhancing natural systems (Step 3). 
Wealthier countries need to support poorer 
nations in transitioning away from fossil 
fuels. We must swiftly eliminate subsidies to 
fossil fuel corporations and use effective and 
fair schemes for steadily escalating carbon 
prices to restrain the use of fossil fuels. 
2) Short-lived pollutants. We need to 
promptly reduce emissions of short-lived cli-
mate pollutants, including methane, black 
carbon 
(soot), 
and 
hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs). Doing this could slow climate 
feedbacks and potentially reduce the short- 
term warming trend by >50% over the next 
few decades while saving millions of lives 
and increasing crop yields due to reduced air 
pollution. The 2016 Kigali amendment to 
phase down HFCs is welcomed. 
3) Nature. We must protect and restore 
Earth’s ecosystems. Phytoplankton, coral 
reefs, forests, savannas, grasslands, wet-
lands, peatlands, soils, mangroves, and sea 
grasses contribute greatly to sequestration 
of atmospheric CO2. Marine and terrestrial 
plants, animals, and microorganisms play 
significant roles in carbon and nutrient cy-
cling and storage. We need to quickly curtail 
forest and biodiversity loss, protecting the 
remaining primary and intact forests, while 
accomplishing 
reforestation 
and 
afforestation where appropriate at enormous 
scales. Although available land may be lim-
iting in places, up to a third of emissions re-
ductions needed by 2030 for the Paris agree-
ment (<2°C) could be obtained with these 
natural climate solutions. 
4) Food. Eating mostly plant-based foods 
while reducing the global consumption of 
animal products, especially ruminant live-
stock, can improve human health and sig-
nificantly lower GHG emissions (including 
methane in step 2). Moreover, this will free 
up croplands for growing much needed 
human plant food instead of livestock feed, 
while releasing some grazing land to support 
natural climate solutions (step 3). Cropping 
practices such as minimum tillage that in-
crease soil carbon are vitally important. We 
need to drastically reduce the enormous 
amount of food waste around the world. 
5) Economy. Excessive extraction of mate-
rials and overexploitation of ecosystems, 
driven by economic growth, must be quickly 
curtailed to maintain long-term sustain-
ability of the biosphere. We need a carbon- 
free 
economy 
that 
explicitly 
addresses 
human dependence on the biosphere and poli-
cies that guide economic decisions accord-
ingly. Goals need to shift from GDP growth 
and the pursuit of affluence toward sup-
porting ecosystem and human wellbeing by 
prioritizing basic needs and reducing in-
equality. 
6) Population. Still increasing by roughly 
80 million people per year or >200,000 per day, 
we must stabilize and ideally gradually re-
duce the world population within a frame-
work that ensures social integrity. There are 
proven and effective policies that strengthen 
human rights, while lowering fertility rates 
and lessening the impacts of population 
growth on GHG emissions and biodiversity 
loss. These policies involve making family 
planning services available to all people and 
achieving full gender equity, including pri-
mary and secondary education as a global 
norm for all, especially girls and young 
women 
Mitigating and adapting to climate change 
while honoring the diversity of humans en-
tails major transformations in the ways our 
global society functions and interacts with 
natural ecosystems. We are encouraged by a 
recent surge of concern. Governmental bod-
ies are making climate emergency declara-
tions. Schoolchildren are striking. Ecocide 
lawsuits are proceeding in the courts. Grass-
roots citizen movements are demanding 
change, and many countries, states and prov-
inces, cities, and businesses are responding. 
As an Alliance of World Scientists, we 
stand ready to assist decision makers in a 
just transition to a sustainable and equitable 
future. The good news is that such trans-
formative change, with social and economic 
justice for all, promises far greater human 
wellbeing in the long run than does business 
as usual. We believe that prospects will be 
greatest if decision makers and all of hu-
manity promptly respond to this warning 
and declaration of a climate emergency, and 
act to sustain life on planet Earth, our only 
home.

February 3, 2021 
Sixteen-year-olds are legally permitted to 
work and pay federal income tax on their 
earnings. They are legally permitted to drive 
motor vehicles, and if they commit crimes they 
are tried as adults. If 16-year-olds are im-
pacted by our laws, it is only fair that they be

also strengthen civics education in our schools 
by making content relevant to students lives, 
and incentivizing schools to prioritize civics. 
Madam Speaker, research has shown that 
voting is a habitual behavior, which is why 16 
is a better time than 18 to acquire the habit of 
voting. Numerous cities across our nation 
have already passed ordinances allowing 16- 
year-olds to vote in local municipal elections. 
Data from five cities in Maryland—which were 
among the first in America to lower the voting 
age to 16 for local elections—shows 16- and 
17-year-olds have turned out to vote at equal 
or higher rates than voters from older age 
groups. 
When individuals participate in democratic 
processes from a young age, they form life-
long habits of civic participation and voter en-
gagement. Nineteen states already allow for 
17-year-olds to vote in primary elections prior 
to them turning 18. 
Madam Speaker, lowering the voting age to 
16 will only strengthen our democratic institu-
tions by exposing youth to our most sacred 
civic duty of voting. I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation as we empower Amer-
ica’s youth to help shape and guide our nation 
by allowing them to vote in all elections.

TRIBUTE TO MS. BARBARA 
BEATRICE WALKER 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, Barbara Beatrice Walker was the 
true essence of love, hope and charity. She 
had and constantly demonstrated a warm, car-
ing and giving spirit. Born and raised in Mis-
sissippi, Barbara always spoke fondly of her 
childhood and had a real sense of affection for 
the Piney Wood Boarding School which she 
attended and gave a great deal of credit for 
helping her to become the person that I and 
countless others came to know and love. She 
moved to Chicago, had a very successful ca-
reer working for Cook County Health Services, 
married her husband Edgar and to their union, 
Michele was born. Barbara was totally devoted 
to Michele and to her son Herschel and ulti-
mately Herschel Jr., her grandson and great 
grandson. Barbara was an active member of 
the 7th Congressional District Peoples Assem-
bly where she often brought Southern style 
cooked food to feed the Congressman and I 
shall never forget it. Condolences to her family 
and we thank her for her service to humanity. 
‘‘Though I speak with the tongues of men 
and of angels, if I have not charity then I am 
nothing.’’ 
HONORING 
THE 
GEORGE 
WASH-
INGTON UNIVERSITY ON THE OC-
CASION OF ITS BICENTENNIAL 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor The George Washington University 
on the occasion of its bicentennial. 
For two centuries, generations of students 
from around the world have come to The 
George Washington University (GW) to take 
full advantage of the unparalleled academic 
opportunities that accompany its unique van-
tage point in the heart of the nation’s capital. 
Indeed, the entire GW community is unique 
in that, regardless of what discipline one may 
choose to pursue there, all have chosen to at-
tend the university because of their desire to 
make a difference in the world and their ability 
to utilize GW’s vast network of partnerships, 
access and policy initiatives to translate that 
desire into action. 
With its decades-long working relationships 
with nearly every federal agency, as well as 
numerous international multilateral organiza-
tions, the university’s faculty have long been 
an indispensable source of groundbreaking re-
search and ideas that not only create new 
knowledge but also transform policy that af-
fects millions of people in their daily lives. 
While GW’s traditional areas of strength have 
long been regarded as law, media and policy-
making, the university is also pioneering dis-
coveries in cybersecurity, tissue regeneration, 
robotics, autism, fighting extremism, HIV/AIDS, 
combating violence against women and girls 
worldwide, nanotechnology and building sus-
tainable ecosystems, among many other 
areas. It should not come as a surprise that 
GW’s doctors, researchers and public health 
officials have been at the forefront of COVID– 
19 research since the beginning and are dili-
gently working to help address this urgent 
problem. 
Moreover, the collective force of GW’s two 
centuries is embodied by its distinguished 
alumni—now numbering more than 290,000 in 
130 countries worldwide—whose ranks include 
some of the most consequential leaders of our 
time in practically every pursuit. 
Furthermore, as a hub of intellect and dy-
namic human capital, the university continues 
to infuse the District of Columbia with its excit-
ing mixture of ideas, diversity and youthful en-
ergy, which has made it an essential part of 
the city’s civic and cultural life since its very 
founding. 
Yet, none of this great success was either 
inevitable or preordained. It was only achieved 
by the commitment of generations of students, 
alumni, faculty and staff to build GW into a 
preeminent global research institution. 
I ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in thanking and congratulating GW for two 
centuries of accomplishment and positive im-
pact on the District, the rest of the nation and 
the world. I wish the university continued suc-
cess into its third century and beyond. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF GENE 
BARBARET 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great regret that I rise today to mourn and ob-
serve the passing of an eternal educator, Dr. 
Gene Barbaret of Mansfield, Connecticut. Hav-
ing lived a full and active life, Gene passed 
away on his 101st birthday on January 11, 
2021 due to complications related to the 
coronavirus. 
Gene’s life was intrinsically American, and 
he dedicated his lifeforce toward professorial 
teaching and sharpening the mind. To this 
end, Gene contributed a palpable value to-
ward the strength and productivity of eastern 
Connecticut’s conununity, the region I have 
the honor of representing. Dr. Barbaret, a first- 
generation scholar born to parents who 
inunigrated from Alsace, France, was always 
eager to observe and take from his environ-
ment as the youngest of eight siblings. His 
story will be remembered by many as one of 
vigor, decency, and a passion for cultural en-
richment. 
As a lifelong learner, Gene was always des-
tined to become the wisest of educators. His 
potential in the education industry was re-
flected from the start, such as when he grad-
uated covaledictorian from Watertown High 
School in his hometown of Oakville, Con-
necticut. His deep French roots struck a clear 
cord with him from early on as well, motivating 
Mr. Barbaret to achieve a bachelors degree in 
French studies in 1941. Taking a break from 
his studies, Gene heeded the call to serve in 
the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. 
Upon his return from the war, however, Gene 
resumed a determined effort to expand upon 
his 
roots—transitioning 
his 
education 
to 
Princeton University and going on to achieve 
a masters and subsequent doctoral degree in 
French literature by 1951. 
Not one to let knowledge go to waste, Gene 
brought his specialization back to our home 
state of Connecticut before obtaining his doc-
toral in 1949, marking the genesis of a career 
in sharing his experience as a faculty of the 
University 
of 
Connecticut 
(UConn). 
Dr. 
Barbaret went on to educate French Literature 
within UConn’s Department of Modem and 
Classical Languages, building a true and per-
sonal connection to the University over the 
course of 40 years. He achieved this not by 
simply mastering lectures, but also by broad-
ening his perspective alongside the very stu-
dents he taught. As a professor, he personally 
oversaw the University’s year long study 
abroad program to France, journeying with 
certain students across the Atlantic to better 
understand the international community and 
our place in it. Dr. Barbaret’s impact cannot be 
understated—throughout his long tenure he 
came to be recognized with a variety of hon-
ors and accolades, eventually even becoming 
knighted as a chevalier by the French govern-
ment for his contributions to the nation’s cul-
ture. As a fondly remembered mentor and a 
good scholar, multiple scholarship funds were 
established under the University in his name 
to stimulate excellence in French. 
Dr. Barbaret retired from UConn in 1990 as 
a revered professor emeritus. Though UConn

will always be his home as his eternal resting 
place, it should be noted that he engaged in 
a gregarious retirement, frequently travelling 
back to his heritage in France as well as other 
stints within Europe. He never gave up on the 
affinity for education either, acting as a volun-
teer teacher at the Donald Bergin Correction 
Institution, a board member of the Center for 
Leaming in Retirement, and even initiating a 
weekly French conversational circle at the 
Mansfield Senior Center well into his latest 
years. Dr. Barbaret touched the lives of many 
who hail from eastern Connecticut. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to represent 
constituents as monumental and influential as 
Gene. His legacy is a lasting and tangible one, 
having expanded horizons for not only himself, 
but the lives of thousands of students, col-
leagues, and friends, While we all mourn his 
loss, we can at least find solace that his story, 
memory and purpose lives on in the lives of 
countless others. Therefore, I find it fitting that 
we as a institutional body set his name and 
character further into stone. I ask that the en-
tire House join me in recognizing the life of Dr. 
Gene Barbaret and never forgetting that the 
best educators—and by extension leaders— 
never end their quest of learning.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE ARGYLE 
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Argyle High School Foot-
ball Team, the Argyle Eagles, and their victory 
at the 4A Division 1 championship. 
After an undefeated 15-game season punc-
tuated by remarkable skill, commitment, and 
diligence, the Argyle Eagles qualified for their 
UIL conference’s Division I championship in 
December 2020. With a strong showing at the 
final game in Arlington’s AT&T stadium, the 
team secured the state title for the second 
time in its history. 
Led by head coach Todd Rodgers, Defen-
sive MVP Zach Stewart, and Offensive MVP 
Tito Byce, the team’s unbroken series of suc-
cesses in the 2020 season culminated in their 
outstanding victory last month. 
The teamwork, tenacity, and effort dem-
onstrated by the Argyle Eagles team and 
coaches is highly commendable. In spite of 
the many challenges created by the COVID– 
19 pandemic, the team, through diligence both 
on and off the field, overcame their obstacles 
and achieved their ultimate goal. I am happy 
to see the team’s estimable fortitude be re-
warded with another state title. 
I congratulate the coaches and players of 
the Argyle High School Football Team for their 
admirable achievement in the 2020 football 
season, and for their exemplary devotion to 
both their team and their sport. I am privileged 
to be able to join the Argyle community, par-
ents, family and friends who faithfully sup-
ported the team’s efforts, as they celebrate 
this accomplishment, and I wish them well in 
all their future endeavors.
