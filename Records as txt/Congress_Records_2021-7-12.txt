Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who alone spreads out 
the heavens and rules the raging of the 
sea, give our lawmakers wisdom to 
draw near to You. May they daily seek 
Your presence as they reflect on Your 
sacred Word. Guide them with Your in-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 6 
months ago, the Democratic majority 
began this Congress by aggressively 
confronting 
the 
COVID 
crisis. 
We 
passed the American Rescue Plan—one 
of the largest Federal stimulus meas-
ures in history—to help bring an end to 
the economic downturn and prime our 
economy to come roaring back. Now, 
millions of Americans have come off 
the unemployment rolls, and small 
businesses have reopened from coast to 
coast. More than 150 million Americans 
have been fully vaccinated. We need, of 
course, to keep up the effort to inocu-
late the rest of the country, but suffice 
it to say, we are well on our way to 
bringing the country out of chaos, out 
of crisis, and back to normal. But the 
task is not done. 
As our country reopens and Ameri-
cans return to work, we must turn our 
attention to laying a foundation for 
the future. This upcoming work period 
will focus on exactly that: building a 
foundation for future American pros-
perity for years and decades to come 
through smart and bold investments in 
our Nation’s infrastructure. 
As I have said for weeks, the discus-
sions about infrastructure legislation 
continue along two tracks. On the bi-
partisan track, our committees are 
getting closer to turning the recent 
agreement between the White House 
and the bipartisan infrastructure group 
into legislation. I am pleased to report

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4810 
July 12, 2021 
we are making very good progress to-
ward that goal. On the second track, 
the Senate Budget Committee is close 
to finalizing a budget resolution, which 
will allow the Senate to move forward 
with the remaining parts of the Amer-
ican Jobs and Families Plan. The Sen-
ate must pass the budget resolution 
and an eventual budget reconciliation 
bill with or without Republican sup-
port. 
The fact of the matter is, brick-and- 
mortar infrastructure is very impor-
tant, but it is no longer the only type 
of infrastructure that matters in the 
21st century. Human infrastructure— 
what many might call family support 
as our families come under increasing 
pressure in this modern society, things 
like childcare, family leave, education, 
healthcare—are just as essential to giv-
ing our citizens opportunity as build-
ing roads and bridges and railways. 
Both are very important. Twenty-first 
century investment in broadband inter-
net, the electric grid, and retrofitting 
our economy to fight climate change in 
bold ways are just as important as 
roads and bridges and railways. We 
must do both. It is not one or the 
other, and we are going to do both. 
Before the week work period is over, 
it is my intention for the Senate to 
hold votes on the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill and a budget resolution. Mem-
bers should prepare for a busier work 
period than usual, with the possibility 
of late-night votes, weekend votes, and 
changes to the August schedule. It is 
not going to be easy, but it is certainly 
going to be worth it. 
The Federal Government has not 
made a significant stand-alone invest-
ment in infrastructure in decades. We 
have the world’s largest economy, and 
yet our infrastructure ranks 13th. 
America has less generous family sup-
port policies than so many of our peers 
who are not as wealthy as we are. It is 
time to rebuild our infrastructure, cre-
ate millions of good-paying jobs—par-
ticularly to those who haven’t been 
able to get good-paying jobs—and help 
American families keep up with rising 
expenses. If and when we succeed, the 
benefits—the benefits—will reverberate 
across the country for generations to 
come. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, on nominations, 
the Senate will also continue to con-
firm highly qualified nominations to 
the Biden administration. 
This week, the Senate will confirm 
Uzra Zeya to serve as Under Secretary 
of State and Julie Su to serve as Dep-
uty Secretary of Labor. Both Ms. Zeya 
and Ms. Su will add to the expertise, 
dedication, and diversity of President 
Biden’s administration. As the week 
progresses, Members should be advised 
there will be additional votes, in all 
likelihood, on additional nominees. 
Judicial appointments remain one of 
our highest priorities. Later this week, 
the Judiciary Committee will vote to 
advance five additional judges: two cir-
cuit court nominees, including Ms. Eu-
nice Lee—one of the great public de-
fenders not only in New York but in 
the country whom I am proud to rec-
ommend to the Second Circuit—and 
three district court nominees. 
The Senate has already confirmed 
more circuit and district court judges 
before July 4 than during the first year 
of any Presidency in recent history. We 
will continue this critical work in the 
months to come and restore balance, 
much needed balance, to the Federal 
judiciary. 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
Madam President, on one final mat-
ter, the child tax credit—this, the big-
gest effort in over 50 years to reduce 
childhood poverty in America—begins 
on Thursday. Later this week, tens of 
millions of American families are 
going to see extra money hit their 
bank accounts when the first payments 
of the newly expanded child tax credit 
are disbursed across the country. 
When Senate Democrats passed the 
American Rescue Plan in March, we in-
cluded a provision to provide the ma-
jority of parents $3,600 per year for 
every child under 6 and $3,000 for every 
child between 6 and 17. These pay-
ments, I am happy to say, are ready to 
begin this week, which means that, 
soon, most families with kids will start 
receiving $300 each month for each 
child under 6 and $250 each month for 
each child 6 to 17. 
I want American families to know, if 
you filed your taxes in either 2019 or 
2020 or both, you will get these pay-
ments automatically; you will see 
them in your bank accounts without 
lifting a finger. For those who for 
whatever reason didn’t file taxes in the 
past 2 years, I strongly urge you to go 
online 
and 
register 
at 
irs.gov/ 
childtaxcredit—let 
me 
repeat 
that: 
irs.gov/childtaxcredit—or contact your 
representative for assistance. 
These payments are going to make 
an incredible difference to millions and 
millions of American families strug-
gling with the cost of childcare and 
groceries and housing and healthcare. 
Recent estimates by the Center on 
Budget and Policy Priorities predict 
that more than 4 million children—4 
million children—will be lifted out of 
poverty. Childhood poverty in America 
cut almost in half—what an amazing 
thing that is. 
Just this morning, I met with a 
group of parents in New York whose 
lives 
would 
dramatically 
improve 
thanks to this policy. Listening to 
their stories, I was moved to hear the 
relief in their voices that an extra lit-
tle help is coming their way and the 
hope in their voices about giving their 
children a better future. 
This is an example of the difference 
between a Democratic and a Repub-
lican majority in the Senate. As Lead-
er MCCONNELL openly reminds every-
one, not a single Republican voted in 
favor of expanding the child tax credit 
through the American Rescue Plan. 
I am so proud that Democrats found 
a way to help American families, help 
American kids with a brighter, strong-
er future despite unanimous Repub-
lican opposition. I believe that now we 
must press on and make these ex-
panded payments a permanent part of 
our Tax Code. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today is the first day of what could be 
a productive and maybe even historic 
few weeks in the Senate. I hope we can 
live up to the challenges we are facing. 
July 6 was a historic day in my home 
State of Illinois. For the first time in 
476 days, Illinois went 24 hours without 
losing a life to COVID–19. During the 
deadliest days of this pandemic, Illi-
nois was losing more than 150 people a 
day to COVID. As our Governor, JB 
Pritzker, said on the 6th, ‘‘The vac-
cines have done the work. Thank God 
for the vaccines.’’ I couldn’t have said 
it better. 
Seventy percent of eligible Illinois 
residents have received at least one 
dose of those lifesaving COVID vac-
cines, including 90 percent of seniors. 
But we are at a critical moment in Illi-
nois and across our Nation. With the 
new, more dangerous Delta variant 
now spreading rapidly across the Na-
tion, people who are unvaccinated are 
at greater risk than ever of becoming 
sick 
and 
even 
facing 
death 
from 
COVID. I hope we can stop the division 
and disinformation and figure out how 
to protect the people from this deadly 
foe. 
I want to say a word about an issue 
I read this morning in an article in the 
New York Times. The author of the ar-
ticle, Tiffany Hsu, titled the article 
‘‘Anti-Vaccination 
Rhetoric 
Creeps 
From Fringe to Fox Prime Time.’’ It is 
a lengthy article, and I commend it to 
everyone to read it on their own. It 
raises some important questions. 
If our sacred right to free speech can 
be limited by the time-honored test of 
crying ‘‘fire’’ in a crowded theater, is 
there any limit to extreme political 
rhetoric in the midst of a pandemic? 
We know the Republican Party is en-
thralled by Donald Trump. They have 
bought the Big Lie. A half to two- 
thirds of Republicans believe that he 
actually won the last election, and he 
didn’t. Twenty-nine percent of Repub-
licans believe that Donald Trump will 
be reinstated as President, trium-
phantly returning from exile to take 
over the White House again. Many of 
them believe that he will return to 
Washington soon. 
Well, there was an interesting scene 
on the grounds of the Capitol when I

returned today from Illinois. For the 
first time since January 6, the fence 
that was erected to hold back the in-
surrectionist mob was removed. We 
hope that we are prepared now to pro-
tect this Capitol and can get back to 
business as usual, but we have to re-
cruit additional Capitol Hill Police to 
be prepared, we have to work with the 
National Guard units to be prepared, 
and we have to realize the obvious. 
There was a decision made on the floor 
of the U.S. Senate by the Republican 
Senate leader just a few weeks ago to 
stop any bipartisan effort to establish 
a Commission to ask what happened on 
January 6 and how it can be avoided in 
the future. Senator MCCONNELL
ob-
jected to a bipartisan, evenly-split 
Commission to investigate that ter-
rible day. The GOP Senate leader 
killed that idea several weeks ago. 
I want to commend Speaker PELOSI, 
who is trying her best through a spe-
cial committee in the House of Rep-
resentatives to have a bipartisan inves-
tigation. It should have been done 
through 
this 
Commission. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL stopped it. 
There is one other element I would 
like to raise when it comes to free 
speech in the time of pandemic. What 
caught my eye in this morning’s paper, 
as I mentioned earlier, was this article 
about FOX Primetime. They recounted 
the fact that over the last several 
months, FOX had been losing ground to 
CNN, and questioning the effectiveness 
of the COVID–19 vaccines became a 
split decision at the FOX network. 
Some of the leaders at FOX obviously 
believe strongly in the vaccine, and I 
commend them. I do too. Rupert 
Murdoch was vaccinated in December. 
When a list of those who supported 
the effort to encourage the use of vac-
cines across America was taken at 
FOX, they put together a 30-second 
spot featuring host and anchor Steve 
Doocy, Harris Faulkner, Dana Perino, 
and John Roberts. Ms. Faulkner said in 
that ad by FOX: ‘‘If you can, get the 
vaccine.’’ Bret Baier, chief political an-
chor 
at 
FOX 
News, 
said 
in 
an 
Instagram post that he was grateful for 
the shot of vaccine. The hosts of ‘‘FOX 
& Friends’’ spoke of the relief they felt 
in becoming vaccinated. Sean Hannity 
himself said: 
I do believe in science, and I believe in vac-
cinations. Talk to your doctor. You don’t 
need to talk to people on TV and radio that 
aren’t doctors. 
Which goes to the point of this mes-
sage. There are two hosts of programs 
on FOX Primetime who can only be 
characterized as anti-vax quacks. I am 
referring, of course, to Tucker Carlson 
and Laura Ingraham. They have been 
spreading what I consider to be irre-
sponsible information about vaccines 
across America and about the effort of 
this Nation to deal with them. 
Here is the reality. We have millions 
who have died across the world from 
this virus. We may never have an accu-
rate count. We have hundreds of thou-
sands who have died in the United 
States. Now it is said repeatedly that 
those who are headed to the hospital 
with 
the 
most 
serious 
strains 
of 
COVID–19—99.5 percent of them were 
not vaccinated. So the facts are obvi-
ous here. 
I know it is an individual decision on 
whether to be vaccinated, and I am 
sure there may be some Senators who 
have decided not to do it, but I was 
happy to do it as soon as I could. I 
think the vaccines are protecting me 
and my wife and my family. But in the 
meantime, to have these hosts of TV 
shows at FOX, in prime time, peddling 
this nonsense about vaccines being un-
necessary 
and 
COVID–19 
being 
no 
threat can only be summarized in a 
statement which concluded this arti-
cle: 
In a recent opinion essay for The Daily 
Beast by Preston Padden, a former high-level 
executive at Fox Broadcasting wrote that 
Fox News had ‘‘contributed substantially 
and directly’’ to ‘‘the unnecessary deaths of 
many Americans by fueling hesitation and 
doubt about the efficacy and safety of life-
saving Covid-19 vaccines.’’ He singled out the 
channel’s prime-time opinion programs for 
blame. 
I want to commend those at FOX who 
have stood up and said the right thing 
about these vaccines, but I also want 
to take issue with those who are using 
this vaccine, for whatever purpose, to 
mislead and confuse American people 
about its necessity, its effectiveness, 
and its safety. They are not doing 
America any favors, and I hope that 
FOX will come to its senses. 
If there are things that can remove 
you from the air for being said on a 
program, I certainly hope that the 
management of the station will cau-
tion 
Tucker 
Carlson 
and 
Laura 
Ingraham for the statements they have 
made in opposition to vaccines. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Madam President, the Fourth of 
July, of course, is a night when you 
may not be able to get to bed early, 
with a lot of fireworks in celebration of 
our Nation’s birthday, and it is cele-
brated from one corner of America to 
the next. But sadly, in many places on 
this Fourth of July, the noise you were 
hearing was not fireworks; it was gun-
fire. 
One hundred and four people were 
shot in Chicago. One hundred and four 
people were shot in Chicago on the 
Fourth of July weekend. Nineteen died. 
Among the wounded were 13 children 
and 2 Chicago police supervisors. The 
dead included, in Chicago, a National 
Guard member who was aspiring to 
join the Chicago Police Department. 
The week before the holiday, a 1- 
month-old baby girl was shot in the 
head during a mass shooting. A 20- 
year-old University of Chicago student, 
just riding on the L train, coming 
home from an internship at an invest-
ment firm in The Loop, was hit by a 
stray bullet. He, too, died. 
Two days after the Fourth of July 
weekend, two ATF agents and a Chi-
cago police officer on an undercover 
operation were shot and wounded. It 
was the 36th Chicago police officer shot 
this year. 
This is madness. Chicago is not alone 
with this gun violence experience. Life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness 
are just cruel taunts if anyone can be 
cut down anywhere in this great coun-
try by gunfire. 
Gun violence is a national crisis. At 
least 233 people were killed, and 618 
people were injured by gunfire in the 
United States over the Fourth of July 
weekend, according to the Gun Vio-
lence Archive. Shootings are up this 
year in big cities but also in suburbs 
and rural areas. Don’t believe it is only 
blue cities. It is blue cities and red cit-
ies and purple cities and small towns. 
Already this year, there have been 
nearly 23,000 gun violence deaths in 
America. Did you hear that? This year, 
23,000 gun violence deaths in America— 
that includes more than 12,000 by sui-
cide and fatalities from more than 340 
mass shootings. Sadly, virtually every 
weekend there is a mass shooting in 
the city of Chicago, which I represent— 
340 mass shootings, nearly 2 a day. 
No other nation on Earth experiences 
this massive civilian slaughter. Neither 
should we. We must do more to keep 
guns out of the hands of criminals and 
others who are prohibited from having 
them. 
I met with the mayor of Chicago to 
talk about the Fourth of July weekend. 
We both agreed that more has to be 
done, and we are determined to work 
with President Biden, who is com-
mitted to this issue as well. But we 
also believe that we need to enforce the 
laws that are on the books. Specifi-
cally, we need to make sure that guns 
are not being sold to people without a 
background check. 
Convicted felons have no business 
buying a gun, nor do people who are 
mentally unstable. But, unfortunately, 
they can. There are many loopholes in 
the law. There are ways to sell these 
guns at a gun show, without a back-
ground check, or over the internet or 
ghost guns, which have no, basically, 
identifying serial number. 
We have to do more to keep guns out 
of the hands of criminals, and we can if 
we will just stand up—both parties 
stand up—and say: Enough. This is ri-
diculous, it is cruel, and it is heart-
breaking. 
I have spoken with the mayor about 
the crisis in Chicago, and President 
Biden did the same when he came to Il-
linois last week. Today, the President 
is meeting at the White House with law 
enforcement, local elected officials, 
and others to discuss his administra-
tion’s efforts to reduce gun crimes. 
The American Rescue Plan, which 
passed the U.S. Senate without a single 
Republican vote in support, included 
funding that communities can use for 
youth unemployment programs, men-
tal health services, and other strate-
gies to break the cycle of violence. The 
COVID rescue plan also included fund-
ing for local law enforcement to im-
prove community policing practices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4812 
July 12, 2021 
The Republicans like to make a big 
thing about the statements from some 
people about defunding the police. I 
never supported that, and most of the 
people I know had nothing to do with 
it. But here they are defunding the po-
lice themselves and voting against the 
American Rescue Plan. 
That plan is going to provide law en-
forcement more resources. We want 
that money to be spent properly, and 
we certainly want law enforcement to 
discharge their duties in a professional 
way. But additional resources can be 
and will be used effectively. I am sorry 
that not one single Republican Senator 
voted for that plan. I think it is not 
defunding the police; it is defending 
the police with the American Rescue 
Plan provisions. 
President 
Biden’s 
American 
Jobs 
Plan, which we are now going to con-
sider soon, is an opportunity for us to 
consider $5 billion to fund community 
violence prevention programs. I have 
introduced my bill, the RISE from 
Trauma Act, which would implement 
the proposal by funding trusted mem-
bers of the community to tackle trau-
ma and the pain that is at the root of 
violence. 
Last month, the President announced 
the creation of a new strike force, to be 
headed by the Justice Department, 
that will crack down on illegal drug 
trafficking in Chicago, New York, Los 
Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area, 
and Washington, DC. I support this 
step. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID H. CHIPMAN 
Madam President, we have before us 
a nomination. I am not sure when it 
will be called, but it was a product of 
our 
Judiciary 
Committee. 
David 
Chipman was nominated by President 
Biden, to serve as the next Director of 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
arms and Explosives. 
Madam President, you know the an-
swer to this question but most don’t: 
When was the last time that Agency 
had a Director chosen by Congress 
through the orderly process? Well, it 
was about 6 years ago. That was the 
last time. It turned out to be the only 
time in the history of the Agency. 
But why would an Agency of the gov-
ernment go on for years without a duly 
selected Director? Well, it was an in-
tentional strategy by those gun groups 
to make sure that this Agency, as im-
portant as it is, didn’t have a leader, 
and as a consequence was not as effec-
tive as it should be. 
David Chipman was born in New 
Hampshire and has a B.S. from Amer-
ican University and an M.S. from 
Johns Hopkins. In our committee, we 
recognized the fact that he had 25 years 
of law enforcement experience. He is a 
responsible gun owner himself, and he 
has advocated for commonsense gun 
safety measures. 
I think he is well qualified to serve as 
the head of the ATF. He spent decades 
working in that Agency, including 
serving as a special agent in Virginia, 
Texas, and Michigan. He would be the 
first former ATF agent to head the Bu-
reau, and this experience has equipped 
him with the skills he needs. 
Chipman would only be the second 
confirmed Director in the Agency’s his-
tory, as I mentioned. A lifelong gun 
owner, he knows firsthand the respon-
sibility of gun ownership and the com-
monsense safety measures that go hand 
in hand with it. 
He is uniquely positioned to counter 
a false narrative, pushed by the gun 
lobby, that he has a radical or some-
how contrary to the Second Amend-
ment view. 
Chipman’s knowledge of firearms and 
gun policy is unparalleled. He gained 
his insight not only working in law en-
forcement but also as an adviser to one 
of the Nation’s top violence prevention 
organizations. 
Congress and the Biden administra-
tion must take action to address gun 
violence in the city of Chicago, in the 
city of Springfield, IL, and all across 
this Nation. It is an urgent issue for all 
of us. That is why we should pick, as 
quickly as we can, a leader like David 
Chipman to lead the ATF Agency. 
CLIMATE 
Madam President, I will conclude by 
saying that this has been an unusual 
weather time in our country. We have 
seen things happening that are unpar-
alleled in history—extreme weather in 
the Chicago area, tornadoes, to the 
baking 120-degree heat of the North-
west, to even a warning of a tornado 
here 
in 
Washington, 
DC. 
Strange 
things are occurring. 
When you hear about these wildfires 
in California and Oregon, there is a 
natural inclination, if you don’t live in 
that area, to dismiss them, to say: 
That didn’t happen in my backyard— 
not in my backyard. Well, I have to 
say, we ought to wake up to the re-
ality. Extreme weather and the results 
of global warming are coming to every-
one’s backyard. We have to come to the 
realization that it is time for us to pre-
pare this Nation to turn back the im-
pacts of climate change and global 
warming. Those fires are burning in 
California and Oregon, but they reflect 
the situation which is dangerous for all 
of us. 
We are waiting to investigate and 
bring in engineering groups with the 
Surfside, FL, building collapse, that 
terrible tragedy which claimed, I am 
sure, I am sad to say, over 100 lives. We 
think climate change may have had 
something to do with that. The rising 
water table and the infiltration of salt-
water from the oceans may have 
caused the decline in the stability of 
the foundation of that building. We 
will only know after the engineers can 
look at it more closely. 
In the area of the Great Lakes—we 
love our Great Lakes—Lake Michigan 
is one of the most beloved aspects of 
our State and in the city of Chicago, 
but 2 or 3 days ago, in the New York 
Times, there was a front-page story 
about what is happening with the 
Great Lakes and the instability of that 
region. We are taking it seriously. I am 
glad to say that President Biden has 
joined in restoring the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative, which President 
Obama began. 
The Great Lakes are a great asset, 
but they are also a great reminder that 
we all face climate change in our own 
home areas.

pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JEN EASTERLY 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise in support of Jen Easterly’s nomi-
nation to serve as Director of the Cy-
bersecurity and Infrastructure Secu-
rity Agency, commonly referred to as 
CISA. 
Before the Senate adjourned for the 
July 4 holiday, I stood right here and 
urged my colleagues to confirm her for 
this vital position. I was disappointed 
that a Republican colleague blocked 
Ms. Easterly’s swift confirmation at 
that time, but I appreciate that he has 
now resolved his concerns and that we 
can move forward today. 
I warned that, without confirming 
Ms. Easterly, we risked leaving our-
selves vulnerable to cyber attacks, and 
in the 2 weeks since I last called on my 
colleagues to approve this critical 
nomination, nation-state actors and 
criminal organizations have continued 
their relentless targeting of the United 
States. 
Over the July 4 weekend, we learned 
that U.S. software company Kaseya 
was the target of a major ransomware 
attack that has impacted hundreds and 
possibly thousands of businesses and 
organizations worldwide. Days later, 
we saw reports that a Republican Na-
tional Committee contractor had been 
attacked in an attempt to target the 
RNC. 
Unfortunately, these are only the 
latest of several recent cyber attacks 
that threaten our government, critical 
infrastructure, 
and 
key 
industries. 
These attackers will stop at nothing to 
infiltrate our networks, and we ur-
gently 
need 
qualified, 
Senate-con-
firmed cyber security leaders in place 
to fight back. 
With more than three decades of 
cyber security expertise and service in 
the public and private sectors, Ms. Eas-
terly is more than qualified to lead 
CISA. We need her in place imme-
diately so she can get to work with 
agencies, businesses, and others to re-
cover from recent cyber attacks and to 
strengthen cyber security defenses be-
fore the next attack. 
I appreciate that my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle have with-
drawn their objections and that the

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of the 
following nomination, Calendar No. 
176. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the nomination. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Jen Easterly, of 
New York, to be Director of the Cyber-

Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate vote on the nomination without in-
tervening action or debate and that, if 
confirmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table, all without intervening action or 
debate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; that any 
statements related to the nomination 
be printed in the RECORD; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CUBA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, this weekend, the people of Cuba 
rose up in opposition to their repres-
sive socialist government. 
I think it is important to be clear on 
that point because much of the main-
stream media that is reporting on 
these protests makes it sound as if ev-
erything is pandemic related, but what 
is happening in Cuba is not an eco-
nomic fluke, and every single person 
serving in this body, working in the 
media, and analyzing the policy impli-
cations knows better than to say oth-
erwise. 
This isn’t the pop socialism touted 
by the American left. It is not fashion-
able. There is no empowerment or 
equality in the socialist regime; there 
is just starvation, shortages, violence, 
and failure. For 62 years, the ruling 
Communists have bled the Cuban peo-
ple dry, and now armed thugs have 
taken to the streets to repress the op-
position at any cost. 
Make no mistake, this is a test for 
President Biden. He must draw a line 
in the sand. 
I call on my colleagues in the major-
ity and on President Biden and the 
members of his Cabinet to join me in 
supporting all who would risk their 
lives to expose the ravages of socialism 
in Cuba. 
We must lead in discussions with the 
U.N. and the EU and coordinate opposi-
tion to this violence being carried out 
against the people of Cuba. 
We must demand that the Cuban 
Government allow for a free and open 
internet and initiate investigations 
into if and how Havana used tech-
nology supported by the Chinese Com-
munist Party to cut off access to the 
internet just as the protests started 
gaining mainstream attention. 
We cannot stand by while Communist 
thugs gun down their own people. We 
cannot let this become another Ven-
ezuela. 
Just as we stand with the freedom 
fighters suffering in Hong Kong, on 
mainland China, and in other socialist 
regimes around the world, we must 
stand with the people of Cuba. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, meanwhile, we are 
6 months into a new era in American 
politics. The Biden administration is 
still treating government like a grad-
uate seminar, and the American people 
are still wondering when their Presi-
dent is going to stop catering to the 
radical left and start doing his job. 
As I was back home in Tennessee, I 
found out many Tennesseans are abso-
lutely disgusted. They have decided 
that our Democratic colleagues are not 
serious about doing serious work. Their 
priorities and the President’s priorities 
have never been further apart. 
They are looking at those line items 
the administration is checking off, and 
all they can see is what the adminis-
tration refuses to acknowledge; that 
there are very real consequences to 
this out-of-control agenda. 
When President Biden killed the Key-
stone XL Pipeline, Tennesseans did not 
cheer. All they saw on the horizon were 
higher gas prices and a vulnerable fuel 
supply chain. 
Not 4 months after Biden signed the 
Executive order, the Colonial Pipeline 
hack showed us what can happen when 
something interrupts the supply chain. 
When President Biden opened the 
border, they knew better than to be-
lieve all the hype about this so-called 
solution to our immigration crisis, and 
their instincts were spot on. Now the 
chaos tearing apart communities in the 
American Southwest is bleeding into 
communities in Tennessee. 
For Democrats here in DC, all of 
those line items came with zero con-
sequences. Instead of focusing on re-
ality, they are making policy based on 
a perfect world scenario where con-
sequences are simply collateral dam-
age. 
Of course, here in the real world, 
when you talk about collateral dam-
age, you are really referring to the peo-
ple who pay the price for all of these 
absurd policies. 
You know, we read a lot in the news 
these days about what a struggle it is 
for the Senate majority to get their 
bills to the President’s desk. 
No struggle over legislation or pay- 
fors will ever compare to what you are 
putting the average American through. 
If we want to talk about pay-fors, let’s 
talk about how Americans are sup-
posed to pay for gas to get to and from 
work. What happens when they just 
can’t afford it anymore? 
Inflation is already taking a toll on 
the average family’s ability to pay for 
their weekly groceries. Supply chain 
problems have made concerns over pay-
ing for raw materials like lumber obso-
lete. There is nothing to pay for. 
The American people have lost so 
many simple things that used to be not 
easy but manageable. But now, when 
they ask Washington to shape up and 
give them a break, all they get in re-
turn is the assurance that struggle and 
loss is all part of the plan. 
It is July, and we still haven’t seen a 
reasonable infrastructure proposal. No, 
instead, what we have is a truly insult-
ing two-bill scheme that Senate Demo-
crats concocted in lieu of a mandate 
for their radical environmental agenda. 
What will the American people get 
from this scheme? Well, just a fraction 
of what could be the largest spending 
initiative in history will go toward the 
roads, bridges, and broadband connec-
tions that people actually need and are 
willing to pay for. 
If Democrats want the more radical 
line items, they will have to force it 
through by abusing the reconciliation 
process. In a sane world, this wouldn’t 
even be a choice. They wouldn’t do it 
because Democrats know that the kind 
of spending they are talking about will 
exacerbate inflation and increase the 
deficit. 
Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have 
all but ignored their duty to keep the 
country secure. In May, Customs and 
Border Protection caught more than 
180,000 people trying to cross our south-
ern border. Drug seizures were up 18 
percent across the Nation. As of the 
end of June this year, CBP has arrested 
more than 1 million migrants trying to 
come into this country. That is right. 
By the end of June, CBP has arrested 
more than 1 million migrants trying to 
come into the country. 
This is a vulnerability, and I would 
ask my Democratic colleagues and 
President Biden why they are not more 
concerned about it. 
I would also ask why they are not 
more concerned about the impending 
collapse in Afghanistan. The dominos 
are falling. Iran wasted no time step-
ping in to negotiate a deal between the 
Afghan Government and the Taliban.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4814 
July 12, 2021 
Let’s be clear what the Biden admin-
istration has done here. By turning 
their backs on 20 years of hard work 
and sacrifice in Afghanistan, they cre-
ated a power vacuum in a strategically 
important region, knowing that the 
world’s most belligerent state sponsor 
of terror was waiting to fill the gap. 
It is time for President Biden to start 
listening to the people paying the price 
for his radical agenda. They feel like 
they are losing their country. They are 
talking to us about their fear of losing 
their country and their freedom. They 
are out of time, and I will tell you 
what, they are about to be out of pa-
tience. 
If you bothered to ask them what 
they want, they would tell you get the 
spending under control; keep this coun-
try and our allies safe; and stop dis-
tracting 
yourself 
with 
wish 
list 
projects that serve no one but the most 
radical elements of the Democratic 
Party. They are not willing to pay for 
that wish list. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
ahead of the last work period, Senator 
SCHUMER, the majority leader, outlined 
his designed-to-fail agenda. He fore-
casted a series of votes on legislation 
that stood zero chance of actually pass-
ing—legislation to exploit the cause of 
pay fairness to line the pockets of trial 
lawyers, to erode Americans’ Second 
Amendment rights, to force schools 
and hospitals to comply with ‘‘woke’’ 
social norms, and, of course, the mar-
quee bill, a partisan takeover of our 
elections. 
It was obvious from the outset that 
this agenda wasn’t designed to achieve 
results. It takes bipartisanship. It 
takes rolling up your sleeves and work-
ing to build bipartisan consensus to get 
things done in the Senate—especially 
so in an equally divided Senate as we 
have now. 
Rather than put forward a number of 
bills that would earn that sort of bipar-
tisan support and actually pass, Sen-
ator SCHUMER chose to spend most of 
the Senate’s time last month putting 
on a show for the so-called progressive 
base of his party, and I expect even 
more political theater this month. 
So in the next few weeks, we are told, 
our Democratic colleagues will put 
their dual-track legislative approach 
to the test. One of those tracks will in-
clude a heavy dose of bipartisanship, 
and that is something I applaud. 
Contrary to public opinion, Repub-
licans and Democrats in the Senate 
spend a lot of time working together. 
So far this year, we have worked to-
gether to counter threats from China, 
support small businesses impacted by 
the pandemic, and combat the increase 
in hate crimes against Asian Ameri-
cans. We have done all of that together 
in a bipartisan way. Bipartisan solu-
tions are also being crafted to address 
other major issues, from the border cri-
sis, to drug pricing, to police reform. 
In the coming weeks, the Senate is 
expected to vote on one of those bipar-
tisan agreements; that is, to rebuild 
and maintain our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture. The process that brought us to 
this point certainly has been a roller 
coaster. After weeks of back-and-forth 
negotiations, a group of more than 20 
Senators reached an agreement with 
the White House just last month. But 
here is when things got very strange. 
Within minutes of the announcement, 
the President himself put the fate of 
that agreement into question. He said 
he wouldn’t sign the bill unless Demo-
crats paired it with a multitrillion-dol-
lar reconciliation bill that would in-
clude a smorgasbord of leftist spending 
priorities and trillions in higher taxes 
and more debt for Americans. Talk 
about whiplash. Both Republicans and 
Democrats were caught off guard. That 
hadn’t been part of the discussions or 
negotiation. That isn’t what they said 
they agreed to. 
Well, the reversal and unexpected an-
nouncement from the President that, 
even though they were announcing a 
deal, they didn’t have a deal, prompted 
a weekend press cleanup, and the Presi-
dent issued a lengthy statement clari-
fying that it was not a veto threat. But 
we have no reason to suspect that the 
larger sentiment has changed. 
In a letter to his Democratic col-
leagues last Friday, the majority lead-
er, Senator SCHUMER, said the Senate 
will consider both the bipartisan deal 
on infrastructure and the partisan 
budget resolution with reconciliation 
instructions. The bipartisan deal is 
very much tied to the fate of a com-
pletely partisan reconciliation bill, 
notwithstanding 
President 
Biden’s 
cleanup after his unexpected announce-
ment at the White House. 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
don’t 
have to listen to me, but I do believe 
they would be wise to avoid this path. 
They already went on a nearly $2 tril-
lion spending binge earlier this year 
and sidelined every single Republican 
in the Congress during the process. 
They tried to bill this ultrapartisan 
legislation as COVID–19 relief, but we 
all know that only about 10 percent of 
the bill was directly related to the pan-
demic and only 1 percent was tied to 
vaccinating the American people. The 
rest, 90 percent, was exactly the type of 
thing you would expect to see in a bill 
that has only the support of our Demo-
cratic colleagues—funding for climate 
justice, backdoor money for Planned 
Parenthood, and more funding for 
State and local governments than they 
know what to do with. Blue States are 
using that money to pay down old 
debts with the funding. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues claim that money 
was necessary for pandemic relief, but 
that is not what it is being used for. 
So how are we faring after Democrats 
passed this bill? Did the American Res-
cue Plan truly rescue America? Well, 
when it comes to the virus, the answer 
is clearly no. As I said, only a small 
portion of this massive spending sup-
ported our fight against COVID–19. 
When this bill was signed into law, 
the majority of frontline workers had 
already been vaccinated, and vaccine 
makers were working as quickly as 
possible to supply the rest of the Amer-
ican people who wanted them with 
shots. Today, two-thirds of adults in 
America have received at least one 
dose of the vaccine—two-thirds. That 
progress came because of the bipar-
tisan work that happened last year, not 
this year. 
This legislation certainly didn’t res-
cue our already sluggish economy. In 
fact, it has created more hurdles for 
our economy. Democrats created an in-
centive for workers to remain on the 
sidelines of the labor market through 
the end of September by offering en-
hanced Federal bonuses to State unem-
ployment. 
In Texas, for example, businesses of 
all types have struggled to find willing 
workers. For every industry, from hos-
pitality, to retail, to manufacturing, to 
energy, ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs can be 
found everywhere across my State, and 
we are not alone. One restaurant owner 
said the government has been its big-
gest competitor when it comes to find-
ing workers. 
The labor squeeze has become so 
tight that half of the States, including 
Texas, ended the supplemental unem-
ployment benefits early because they 
were not compensating people who 
couldn’t work or couldn’t find work 
but paying people more than they 
would earn if they did work when jobs 
were readily available. 
Those are just the problems that 
have been created with the labor mar-
ket. Families across the country have 
felt the sting of inflation as they have 
paid higher prices on everything from 
gasoline to groceries. This is exactly 
the scenario outlined by economists 
across the country, including those 
who call themselves Democrats, people 
like Larry Summers, who served as 
Treasury Secretary under President 
Clinton and Director of the National 
Economic 
Council 
under 
President 
Obama. He was among the first to warn 
about inflation or rising costs for con-
sumers, and, boy, you must have 
thought he was a skunk at the garden 
party. 
You would think this might serve as 
a lesson to our Democratic colleagues 
about shoveling money out the door as 
fast as they can, even when it creates 
massive debt and the threat of more in-
flation, but here we are once again. Our 
Democratic colleagues are preparing to 
spend trillions more dollars on top of 
the trillions of dollars we have already 
spent on a bipartisan basis to combat 
the virus but then afterwards to spend

July 12, 2021 
more money on their chosen political 
priorities and not on the pandemic. 
They want to now add additional tril-
lions of dollars to that debt and to that 
spending, risking even more dangerous 
and volatile inflation. 
The details of what this round of 
spending might look like are still com-
ing together, but we know that if the 
chairman of the Budget Committee, 
BERNIE
SANDERS, has his wish, the 
price tag could come out as high as $6 
trillion more. Six trillion dollars is a 
quarter of our gross domestic product. 
If you convert our country’s World War 
II spending to today’s dollars, it only 
comes out to $4.4 trillion. So the Demo-
cratic chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee wants to spend more money 
than we spent to defeat Nazi Germany 
and Imperial Japan during World War 
II. 
But I want to be clear about another 
thing. This so-called human infrastruc-
ture plan, which is just made-up words 
indicating that they are trying to 
mask the reality of what they want to 
spend money on—it is not about 
bridges and roads. It is not about 
broadband, things that we all under-
stand are truly infrastructure. It is 
about a long list of political spending 
preferences, and it certainly can’t be 
compared to spending the money we 
needed in order to win World War II. 
For example, they want to spend tril-
lions and trillions of dollars more on 
Medicare expansion, electric vehicle 
chargers, home-based care, free college, 
and a long list of liberal priorities. We 
are happy to debate those but not to 
jam them in a $6 trillion spending 
package. 
All of this spending would be in addi-
tion to the more than $1 trillion bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill that appar-
ently is currently being drafted. I know 
we have been talking for weeks about a 
bipartisan infrastructure bill, but I 
have learned as recently as today that 
there is no bill text, and the Congres-
sional Budget Office that scores these 
bills has not done so yet so we can de-
termine whether the so-called pay-fors 
are, indeed, legitimate and stand up to 
scrutiny. 
Our national debt is at the highest 
level since World War II. This is not 
the time to spend and spend and spend 
until our grandkids are left sitting in a 
pile of debt so deep that they will have 
no hope of climbing out of it. And we 
certainly can’t tax and spend our way 
to prosperity. We need to take a hard 
look at our spending habits and make 
some tough choices, like most Amer-
ican families. They have to decide: 
What are my priorities, and what are 
the resources I have to spend to fund 
those priorities? And that is exactly 
what we need to do here in Congress. 
Folks on both sides of the aisle want 
to rebuild our Nation’s infrastructure. 
Rebuilding resilient roads, bridges, and 
broadband are top of mind for Repub-
licans and Democrats. I know our col-
leagues are still working on text, as I 
said, for the bipartisan infrastructure 
deal, and I am eager to see the details 
on how this massive investment is paid 
for. But, again, this is only one-half of 
the so-called dual-track process an-
nounced by Senator SCHUMER. 
The exorbitant pricetags being float-
ed for the second track have raised se-
rious concerns not just among folks on 
this side of the aisle but on both sides 
of the aisle. 
I sincerely hope that some of our col-
leagues on the other side will stand up 
against irresponsible spending. As we 
know, it takes just one Democratic 
Senator to stand in the way of this 
abuse of the reconciliation process, and 
I hope one or more of them will have 
the courage to do so. 
I yield the floor.

VETERANS 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, last week, when we were all back 
home, we all got to celebrate the 
Fourth of July. Cooking out, spending 
time with our family and friends, 
watching fireworks is always special. 
Sitting there with my family, I 
thought about how blessed we are to 
live in the United States of America. 
We get to live in the most free and 
prosperous country in the history of 
the world. We owe that freedom and 
prosperity to the people who declared 
their independence on July 4, 245 years 
ago. 
They fought and won their freedom 
for an idea called America. That Amer-
ican idea lives on two-and-a-half cen-
turies later, thanks to the generations 
of men and women who, like many be-
fore them, put on the uniform to de-
fend this great country. Many gave 
their lives, the ultimate sacrifice, to 
defend the United States. But many 
more are still with us, and future gen-
erations will continue to volunteer to 
protect the freedoms and liberties this 
country affords us every day. 
Today we have got almost 20 million 
veterans in the United States, and 
400,000 of them call Alabama home. I 
have had the honor and pleasure to 
meet many Alabama veterans the past 
few years. I am always heartened to 
talk with them about their service to 
our great country, but what I hear over 
and over again is that there is more we 
can do for all of our veterans: better 
access to care, better opportunities to 
reenter civilian life. 
Taking care of our veterans is per-
sonal for me. My dad served in World 
War II and died on Active Duty after 
the war. But he taught me so many 
valuable lessons, like work ethic, per-
severance, and love of country. When I 
meet with veterans, I see the same pa-
triotism my dad lived out every day of 
his life. 
You know, I never served myself. The 
Vietnam war was over before I got out 
of college, but many guys I knew from 
back home served in Vietnam. I saw 
how badly they were treated by the 
media, by Hollywood, and even by their 
fellow Americans. They were just try-
ing to serve their country. They 
watched their friends die, and when 
they got home, they weren’t treated 
very well. 
I thank God we treat our veterans 
today better than we did when I was 
growing up. And veterans from the 
Vietnam era are still the largest of the 
veteran group in this United States 
that we live in today. More than 100,000 
Vietnam vets live in Alabama. 
But there is still more we can do to 
give them the care and resources that 
they need and deserve. I am honored to 
be a member of the Senate’s Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee, where we can hear 
about the problems facing our veterans 
firsthand and work together on com-
monsense solutions. 
The biggest challenge our veterans 
face is the access to quality care. We 
have all seen it in the news. We have 
heard about it firsthand. Far too often, 
veterans can’t get the care they need 
in a timely manner. One veteran who 
doesn’t have access to care is one too 
many. 
My main priority is to get veterans 
the care they need and they well de-
serve by whatever means at our dis-
posal, period. A solution to help ad-
dress that problem is the GHAPS Act, 
Guaranteeing Healthcare Access to 
Personnel Who Served, introduced by 
my friend and committee ranking 
member Senator MORAN from Kansas. 
The GHAPS Act would identify per-
sistent gaps that veterans face and 
would help craft innovative solutions 
to make certain all veterans receive 
quality and timely care, especially our 
veterans living in rural areas. The bill 
would also direct the VA to create a 
telehealth strategic plan so that we 
can use modern methods to improve ac-
cess to care. 
I am proud to cosponsor that legisla-
tion and will be working with Ranking 
Member MORAN to get this bill passed. 
We also need to do more to address 
the scourge of veteran suicide. It is ab-
solutely tragic that more than 18 vet-
erans take their own life every day. I 
have partnered with groups like Amer-
ica’s Warrior Partnership, who are 
gathering data on veteran suicide 
across the country to determine how 
we can combat this terrible epidemic, 
leveraging both the VA and community 
resources.

At the same time, we must do more 
to make additional treatments avail-
able to veterans who haven’t had suc-
cess treating their traumatic brain in-
juries or post-traumatic stress dis-
order. One step we can take is to pass 
my bill, the HBOT Access Act. HBOT 
stands for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. 
My bill would permit HBOT as a 
treatment option for those veterans 
who have tried other evidence-based 
treatment options for TBI or PTSD but 
have not seen substantial improve-
ment. I have heard from veterans and 
veterans service organizations that 
point to HBOT as a treatment that has 
produced positive results for individ-
uals suffering from severe head and 
brain injuries. Many former football 
players, including ones who played for 
me, found success with HBOT in treat-
ing their head injuries after suffering 
from concussions. 
HBOT is already approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration as a 
treatment option for more than a 
dozen different conditions, including 
severe burns, infections, and decom-
pression sickness. But the FDA does 
not recognize HBOT as an approved 
treatment option for TBI or PTSD, 
meaning veterans can’t receive this 
care at the VA facilities or elsewhere 
and must pay for it out of their own 
pocket if they do use it. My bill would 
change that. 
If veterans are saying they have im-
proved after using HBOT and if vet-
erans service organizations have seen 
similar success, I say we listen to 
them. We should not leave quality op-
tions on the table while the veteran 
suicide crisis worsens. 
I want to thank my colleagues Sen-
ators HOEVEN and CRAMER as well as 
the American Legion and the Patriot 
Angels for supporting this important 
legislation. I hope my fellow colleagues 
will join me in passing this common-
sense bill. 
Finally, we need to improve re-
sources for veterans to find jobs after 
their service in the military. Too many 
face unnecessary hurdles in rejoining 
civilian life. They have some of the 
best skills you can ask for. Yet some-
times our veterans, like so many oth-
ers, can fall prey to addiction, home-
lessness, or just be flat out down on 
their luck. 
Thankfully, we have got quality or-
ganizations that are doing good work 
helping veterans in need. One of these 
organizations is Three Hots and a Cot, 
based in Clay, AL. Three Hots is a 
small nonprofit organization founded 
by veterans for veterans. They get 
funding mostly through donations but 
also through a Veterans Affairs sup-
portive housing grant from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment. 
Three Hots offers temporary assisted 
housing to 18 veterans at a time. They 
will drive the veterans to healthcare 
appointments at the VA, to grocery 
stores, to job interviews, and to church 
until they can get back on their feet. 
And the job doesn’t stop once the vet-
erans are settled in an apartment on 
their own. Three Hots will help with 
the transition by doing tasks like 
stocking their pantry, getting them 
furniture, and checking on them regu-
larly. 
In their 10 years of operation, Three 
Hots has helped more than 1,600 vet-
erans and family members with an 83- 
percent success rate. This is the holis-
tic type of approach to a tough issue 
that we need more of. They meet vet-
erans where they are at in the commu-
nity and help them find the resources 
available. 
There are more great organizations 
across the country offering to help vet-
erans in need, but oftentimes our vet-
erans don’t know these resources are 
available. I will be working closely 
with my colleagues to better connect 
veterans with the resources that are 
out there so they can be equipped with 
the skills they need to succeed at 
home. 
Folks, simply, without the brave men 
and women who wear the uniform, we 
wouldn’t have the freedoms we enjoy 
and sometimes take for granted every 
day. Our service men and women risked 
everything by joining the military. The 
least we can do is to repay their service 
and sacrifice by taking care of them 
when they return home to the country 
they gave so much to defend. That is 
what I will be doing on the Senate Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee and through-
out my time here in the Senate.

Ms. Zeya is immensely qualified to 
lead U.S. efforts to recenter our most

icy efforts and to strengthen the Bu-
reaus she will lead. Her experience and 
the more than 20 years as a Foreign 
Service officer, including as the Acting 
Assistant Secretary of State for De-
mocracy, Human Rights, and Labor in 
the State Department, make her the 
perfect fit for this position. 
The previous administration abdi-
cated our global responsibility, but we 
now have the opportunity to restore 
U.S. leadership in the fight for democ-
racy, human rights, and rule of law 
around the world. It is an exciting 
prospect for us, but more importantly, 
it will give hope to those still fighting 
for their rights, the millions of people

S4818 
July 12, 2021 
around the world who look to the 
United States for inspiration and sup-
port in their own democratic struggles. 
We see that in places like Cuba 
today. Looking around the globe, we 
see China stripping away Hong Kong’s 
autonomy and freedoms at an alarming 
pace. Military dictators are cementing 
their illegitimate rule in places like 
Burma and Mali, eroding and elimi-
nating the institutions of democracy, 
while Russia and Belarus have impris-
oned political opponents without ac-
countability. 
At the same time, an unprecedented 
80 million people have been forcibly 
displaced from their homes, commu-
nities, and countries. We must look no 
farther than our own southern border 
to see the destruction, desperation, and 
displacement wrought by violence, cli-
mate change, and lack of economic op-
portunity. 
All of these developments negatively 
impact American national security in-
terests. Our Secretary of State and, in-
deed, our country need senior human 
rights leadership of the caliber of Ms. 
Zeya. 
The fact that the nomination of Ms. 
Zeya—a nominee so superbly qualified 
and whose leadership is so essential to 
rebuilding the State Department—has 
languished for 82 days is a travesty. I 
strongly urge my colleagues to join me 
in voting to confirm her to the position 
of Under Secretary of State for Civil-
ian Security, Democracy, and Human 
Rights, and I hope my Republican col-
leagues will stop blocking qualified and 
critical nominees to the Nation’s for-
eign policy and national security mis-
sion from moving forward. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Florida. 
CUBA 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to talk about the new 
day of freedom dawning in Cuba and 
the brave Cubans marching for freedom 
across the island. For decades, the 
Cuban people have suffered atrocities, 
oppression, and misery at the hands of 
the communist Castro regime. 
I have repeatedly told the story of 
Sirley A´ vila Leo´n, a Cuban woman who 
was attacked by Cuban security forces 
in 2015. They cut off her hand and stuck 
her arm in the mud to make sure it got 
infected. Her crime? She complained 
that the regime was going to shut down 
a school in her neighborhood. 
I have spoken to brave leaders like 
Jose´ Daniel Ferrer and the courageous 
members of his Patriotic Union of Cuba 
who are fighting every day to defend 
human rights, freedom, and the demo-
cratic movement in Cuba. Activists 
like Jose´ Daniel Ferrer and the artists 
of the San Isidro Movement are the fu-
ture of Cuba, not the ruthless com-
munist regime. 
Today, the people of Cuba are saying: 
Enough. 
Across 
Cuba, 
people 
are 
marching in the streets to protest 
against communist rule and demand 
the freedom, liberty, and basic human 
rights that have been stolen from them 
for decades by the brutally oppressive 
Cuban regime. Their demands are sim-
ple: libertad. 
What we are seeing in Cuba should 
send a clear message to the world. 
Communism is a failed ideology that 
does nothing but lead to suffering and 
oppression. Communism doesn’t work. 
Socialism doesn’t work. 
The people of Cuba are crying out for 
freedom. They are denouncing the op-
pressive 
communist 
rule 
that 
has 
brought ruin to their nation for more 
than 60 years. The message from the 
Cuban people to Diaz-Canel and Raul 
Castro has never been more clear: Your 
time is up. And the regime is terrified 
of the Cuban people. They are attack-
ing peaceful protesters in an effort to 
silence them. Right now, Jose´ Daniel 
Ferrer, members of his family, and 
other leaders from his group are re-
portedly missing, likely kidnapped by 
the regime. 
This disgusting assault on the people 
of Cuba cannot go unchecked. We can-
not ignore this historic moment in the 
fight for freedom. We understand the 
value and importance of freedom in our 
everyday lives, and it is our duty to 
support and stand up for those who are 
oppressed by dictators and denied the 
right the live freely. 
Today, I stand proudly with the he-
roic freedom fighters across Cuba who 
have taken to the streets, determined 
to regain their freedom and put an end 
to the Castro dictatorship. 
Now, the Biden administration must 
lead the freedom-loving nations of the 
world in loud and unequivocal de-
nouncement of the brutal communist 
Castro regime and in support of the lib-
erty, democracy, and human rights the 
Cuban people call for and rightfully de-
serve. 
We must be clear. For decades, Cuba 
has been the root of instability in 
Latin America and represented a ter-
rible threat to the national security of 
the United States. The Castro regime 
harbors terrorist groups; has gotten rid 
of free and fair elections; threatens and 
arbitrarily arrests critics, journalists, 
and political activists; and props up 
other ruthless dictators, like Maduro 
in Venezuela and Ortega in Nicaragua. 
Today, the American people must 
join freedom-loving Cubans in saying 
that the oppression ends now. We can-
not lift sanctions or restore diplomatic 
relations with the Cuban dictatorship. 
We should not offer another lifeline to 
this brutal communist dictatorship. 
I urge the Biden administration to 
impose further sanctions on the tyran-
nical Cuban regime. We cannot let up. 
There must be consequences for this 
heinous oppression and attacks on 
peaceful protesters. 
To the people of Cuba: You are not 
alone. I stand with you in this fight. 
Florida stands with you in this fight. 
The United States of America stands 
with you in this fight. 
The freedom of Cuba is closer than 
ever, and we are not going to stop until 
we see a new day of freedom, democ-
racy, and ‘‘Patria y Vida’’ in Cuba. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to address the Senate in Span-
ish. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
(English translation of statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
To the people of Cuba: You are not 
alone. I stand with you in this fight. 
Florida stands with you in this fight. 
The United States of America stands 
with you in this fight. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING ELSIE STEWARD YOUNG 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last 
week, Ohio and our Nation lost a cham-
pion for civil rights, Miss Elsie Stew-
ard Young of Highland County, a con-
servative, rural county in Southwest 
Ohio. 
Miss Elsie, as everyone called her, 
had just celebrated her 105th birthday. 
She is a legend in Southwest Ohio. Her 
courage, her leadership made a dif-
ference for children not only in her 
community but all over the country. 
In 1954, after the Supreme Court 
issued its landmark Brown v. Board of 
Education decision and ordered an end 
to segregation in American schools, 
the two all-White primary schools in 
Hillsboro—again, a small town, High-
land County, southwest of Columbus— 
refused to integrate. The district con-
tinued to send Black students to a sin-
gle all-Black school which was woe-
fully underfunded. 
I remember the stories my mother 
would tell me of growing up in Mans-
field, GA. She said she knew and she 
told me—when busing became such a 
controversy in the 1960s and 1970s, she 
told me that she knew all about bus-
ing. 
In the South, when she grew up in 
the twenties and thirties, they would 
bus Black students past the newer, bet-
ter kept White schools to the seg-
regated Black schools that were falling 
apart. No criticism of ‘‘forced busing’’ 
in those days. 
That was essentially what was going 
on in Hillsboro, OH, and Elsie Steward 
Young wouldn’t stand for it. 
She and a group of mothers—this is 
in the 1950s—took matters into their 
own hands. They became the Marching 
Mothers of Hillsboro. Every single day 
for two long years, they marched for 
miles to the town’s all-White primary 
school; every day they were sent home. 
They carried on. Eventually, the 
community and the State and the 
country noticed. They joined with the 
NAACP to file a lawsuit against the 
Hillsboro board of education. It made it 
all the way to the Supreme Court, and 
they won. 
Because of Miss Elsie and her fellow 
mothers’ advocacy, the Court ordered 
the schools to integrate and paved the 
way for integration in other northern 
cities. 
Her activism showed us why ordinary 
students and ordinary citizens—what 
they can achieve when they join to-
gether to fight for justice. 
It is a reminder of how far we have 
come, how much work we have to do to 
achieve justice and opportunity for all 
children in our country. 
Three 
years 
ago, 
Elsie 
Steward 
Young was inducted into the Ohio Civil 
Rights Hall of Fame. That fall, we hon-
ored the Marching Mothers of Hillsboro 
and 
the 
children—of 
course, 
now 
adults—who 
marched. 
We 
honored 
them with our office’s Canary Award at 
our annual Ohio Women’s Conference. 
Then-Senator KAMALA HARRIS, now 
the Vice President, was supposed to 
speak. We were going to present Miss 
Elsie with the award. She was already 
past 100 at that point. We both had to 
stay in Washington at the last minute 
because of Supreme Court votes. 
So many Ohioans at that conference 
told me later that, frankly, I am not 
sure that the Vice President—the fu-
ture Vice President and I were missed 
that much, not with Miss Elsie there. 
She not only filled the void, she pro-
vided so much energy with her forceful, 
inspiring words; and during that con-
ference she was 102. 
Throughout the conference, people 
lined up to get pictures with her. When 
the video played depicting the bravery 
and determination of the marchers and 
when Miss Elsie spoke accepting the 
award, of course, there was hardly a 
dry eye in the audience. 
She talked about how she and other 
mothers only did what any mother 
would do for her children. 
So many Ohioans will miss Miss Elsie 
Steward Young. Our thoughts are with 
her three surviving daughters, her two 
surviving sons, and, get this, her 36 
grandchildren. 
We know her legacy lives on through 
her success, through her victories, 
through her fight for justice, through 
her families, through the future gen-
erations of young people whom she in-
spired to stand against justice. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Miss Elsie Steward Young, 
Ohioan mother, determined champion 
for civil rights. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Mr. President, for the first time in 
decades, workers are beginning to gain 
some power in our economy. 
Because of President Biden’s leader-
ship, because of the American Rescue 
Plan, America’s economy is roaring 
back. We have had record job creation. 
We gained more than 3 million jobs 
since this President took office, more 
jobs created in the first 5 months of 
any Presidency in modern history. 
It is not only the jobs numbers— 
those are important—but those, of 
course, don’t tell the full story. It is 
the quality of those jobs. 
We are starting to see signs of in-
creased bargaining power for American 
workers: power to negotiate higher 
pay, solid working conditions, better 
benefits, more control over their sched-
ules, opportunities for career advance-
ment, all the things that turn into 
good, stable, middle-class careers. 
I want to see employers competing 
for workers. That is a good thing. It is 
how you get rising wages, which get 
spent in the community and then cre-
ate growth for everyone, whether in 
Sante Fe or Columbus. 
For decades, corporations have had 
all the power in our economy. It is 
going to take a lot of work to undo 
those decades of bad trade and tax pol-
icy that gave corporations every single 
day the upper hand. 
We are starting to see glimmers of 
progress. Wages are starting to go up. 
Wages have been rising all year. They 
are surging for workers who have been 
paid too little for decades, working 
tough jobs in restaurants and hotels 
and other service jobs. 
Last week, the Washington Post de-
clared ‘‘Welcome to the year of wage 
hikes.’’ They reported, in the past 3 
months, rank-and-file employees have 
seen some of the fastest wage growth 
in 40 years. Think about that, the fast-
est wage growth since Ronald Reagan 
said it was morning in America. 
It is what should happen—what hap-
pens when you invest in people who 
make this country work, not the CEOs, 
not multinational corporations, not 
money that never really trickles down. 
We invested in America’s greatest 
asset, our workers. Putting money di-
rectly in people’s pockets, putting kids 
back in school, putting workers back 
in jobs, that is starting to unleash the 
true potential of our economy. 
We don’t stop here. On Friday, Presi-
dent Biden issued a sweeping Executive 
order to increase competition in the 
economy. It is one more way we start 
to tilt the job market toward workers. 
Capitalism without competition is just 
exploitation. 
It is just common sense, when you 
have a tiny number of corporations, a 
shrinking number of corporations that 
get bigger and bigger, that control en-
tire industries and huge portions of the 
economy, it drives up prices, and it 
drives down wages. 
Research shows that industry con-
solidation decreases worker pay by as 
much as 17 percent. Companies force 
workers to sign noncompete agree-
ments as a condition of getting a job, 
even in jobs like fast food and con-
struction. They tuck them into the 
fine print of job contracts, making it 
harder for workers to switch to better 
paying options. 
Sometimes they are not even en-
forceable, but employers put them in 
there anyway because it scares workers 
away from taking another job. 
We are putting a stop to this. No 
company should be allowed to tell you 
you can’t take a job offering higher 
pay. President Biden is cracking down

on corporate mergers. Towns all over 
Ohio have seen what happens when 
companies merge and create just one 
employer in a community. It often 
means plant or store closures. It means 
workers have no competitors in town 
to go to for higher wages. 
Rural towns in Ohio and across the 
country watch companies come in, 
knowing they are the only game in 
town, and they offer workers a take-it- 
or-leave-it offer at rock-bottom wages 
that don’t even pay the bills, but it is 
the only place to go. 
Sometimes that is the whole point of 
the merger, to cut what corporations 
call labor costs, what the rest of us call 
jobs, paychecks, or livelihoods. 
Now the President is making it clear 
that when we review mergers, we need 
to look at and take into account 
whether they will lead to lower wages 
for workers. 
All actions come down to the same 
goal, increasing workers’ power by cut-
ting through redtape that keeps work-
ers’ wages down. 
We build on this progress, these im-
portant steps, by passing the Protect 
the Right to Organize Act. To have a 
strong, growing middle class, we have 
to have strong unions. The Protecting 
the Right to Organize Act would start 
to level the playing field and finally 
give workers a fighting chance against 
corporate union-busting tactics. 
We all saw what happened with Ama-
zon this year. One of most powerful 
corporations in the world, and they 
would not be raking in profits without 
the hard work and dedication of its 
hundreds of thousands of American 
workers. Yet it unleashed all of its bil-
lions and billions and billions of dol-
lars’ worth of power to fight its own 
workers. 
When workers try to organize in 21st 
century America, it is never a fair 
fight. This bill would strengthen the 
punishment against companies that 
violate workers’ right to organize and 
that retaliate against union organizers. 
It would close loopholes that allow 
employers to misclassify their employ-
ees as supervisors and independent con-
tractors, often stripping them of their 
overtime they have earned and avoid-
ing paying their fair share and giving 
workers the benefits they deserve. 
A union card is a ticket to middle- 
class life. We just need corporations to 
let workers organize to take control 
over their career and their families. 
In closing, last week, I was up in the 
far northwest corner of my State in 
Bryan, OH, visiting the Spangler Candy 
Company. It is a family-owned business 
more than a century old. They have 
had success for all those years by 
treating their workers and the Team-
sters Union, which represents their 
workers, as partners. They have the 
same goal: to make a great product, to 
make the company successful. They 
work together. 
We in this body, with the American 
Rescue Plan, saved their union pen-
sions in that plan. Now the company is 
expanding production and hiring 40 
more union workers. That is what we 
can achieve when we invest in the peo-
ple and places that make this country 
work. 
When you love this country, you 
fight for the people who make it work. 
That is what President Biden is doing. 
It is what all of us must continue to do 
to respect the dignity of work, so all 
work pays off and workers finally have 
real power in this economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
CUBA 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, the world 
and the country yesterday watched 
these images out of Cuba. It is really 
unprecedented. In 62 years of com-
munist tyranny on the island of Cuba, 
we have never seen and there has never 
been what now is up to 40 cities in 
which people took to the streets—or-
ganically, unorganized, grassroots—to 
ask for the end of that tyranny. And I 
think it is important for a lot of people 
that are new to the issue to sort of un-
derstand what that means and what it 
is all about. 
I think the first lesson we need to 
take away from it is that Marxism, so-
cialism doesn’t work. The way social-
ism, the way Marxism has always 
worked—the way it has always empow-
ered itself—is it goes to a people and it 
immediately divides them. It says: 
There is the suppressor class, and then 
there is this victim class. And these 
evil oppressors—capitalists, in the case 
of socialism or traditional Marxism— 
they oppress the victims. And what 
you have to do is you have to give us 
the power in government to take care 
of these oppressors and to go after 
these oppressors, and if you give us 
that power, we will deliver you secu-
rity and we will protect you from the 
oppressors. They ask for security in ex-
change for freedom. That is always the 
price that socialism asks for—security. 
And what you wind up with is a coun-
try of people that hate each other, and 
they are angry at each other. A signifi-
cant portion of the people in the coun-
try have to leave, have to flee, go to 
jail, because they are the oppressor 
class. Their lives are destroyed. Their 
family lives are destroyed. 
But the socialism can’t deliver the 
security. And when it can’t deliver the 
security, you don’t get your freedom 
back. And, in fact, when you start to 
complain about that, that is when the 
repression comes. 
Well, that is what happened in Cuba. 
Socialism and Marxism has done to 
Cuba what it has done everywhere in 
the world that it has been tried. It has 
failed. It has failed. They gave up their 
freedom. Or they were told: Give up 
your freedom in exchange for a world- 
class healthcare system. 
It is not a world-class healthcare sys-
tem. In fact, it is a healthcare system 
that does not even have the ability to 
deal with COVID at its very basic level. 
They said: Give up your freedom for 
economic security. 
What economic security? People are 
hungry, homes are crumbling, and 
there is no economy. There is no real 
economy in Cuba. 
Give up your freedom and you will 
have an education—free education for 
everybody. 
That education—No. 1, you are a doc-
tor, but you can drive a taxicab in 
Cuba and make more money. Or, No. 2, 
you get sent, forced to go, overseas and 
work basically on slave wages, no 
pay—barely any pay at all. It is basi-
cally human trafficking, as our own 
Department of State found when it 
looked at the Cuban doctors’ program 
and how it has been abused. 
So what has happened in Cuba is that 
socialism has failed. It has to repress 
people who complain about it. You 
don’t get your freedom back. 
And like socialists always do, they 
have to find someone to blame. And 
whom do they blame? No. 1, they blame 
anybody in the country who doesn’t 
agree with them. You are immediately 
a counterrevolutionary. You are imme-
diately a pawn of the imperialists. And, 
then, of course, they always blame the 
United States. 
The problem in Cuba for the regime 
is that the people aren’t falling for 
those lies anymore. They are not. The 
embargo, that is the first thing they 
blame: It is the embargo. The embargo 
is causing all of this. 
Why aren’t fishermen and farmers in 
Cuba allowed to fish or grow things and 
sell it to people? It is not the embargo 
that keeps them from doing that. It is 
the regime. 
Why can’t Cubans own a small busi-
ness? Why can’t a Cuban do in Cuba 
what they can do in Miami, what they 
can do in Washington, and what they 
do in countries all over the world, and 
they can’t do it in Cuba? They can’t 
open a small business. That is not the 
embargo that keeps them from doing 
it. In fact, U.S. law allows us to trade 
and to do commerce with small busi-
nesses that are independently owned by 
Cubans. Do you know why Cubans can’t 
own small businesses? It is not the em-
bargo. It is not the United States. It is 
the regime that doesn’t allow it. 
People have seen these lies. How can 
they afford to build luxury, four-star, 
world-class hotels for tourists, but 
they cannot afford to deal with the 
crumbling homes that Cubans are liv-
ing in, with roofs literally falling in 
over their heads and with water leak-
ing into operating rooms at hospitals? 
Look at what they do with the 
money. Oh, it is because you don’t 
allow more money to be sent. When an 
American or a Cuban American sends 
money to their family members in 
Cuba—in the past, through Western 
Union—the regime takes 10 percent off 
the top, and then they take those dol-
lars you sent and they force the Cubans 
to convert it into worthless Cuban cur-
rency. They keep the dollars. And, 
then, guess what: If you want to buy 
anything, you have to buy it from a 
government store, and guess what the

government store sells things for? Dol-
lars. That is not the embargo. That is 
the Cuban regime that does that. 
And who is it that is putting people 
in jail, gets your head cracked open, 
and gets your door kicked out in the 
middle of the night? There are 80 peo-
ple missing today. At least 80 people 
disappeared overnight. The families 
don’t know where they are. That is not 
the embargo that is jailing people. 
That is the regime. 
And that is what I tell people. You 
can open up all you want. We can pass 
a bill here that says: Open to Cuba—100 
percent open. You can do whatever you 
want—full, free trade. You can do 
whatever you want. At the end of the 
day, the Cuban regime will control 
that opening. It is not just what we 
want to do. It is what they want to do. 
Do you want to do tourism? We tried 
that in 2015 with the Obama changes, 
and do you know what they did? They 
said: Thank you. We love the fact that 
you are coming here as tourists. 
Guess what. All the tourist sites are 
owned by a holding company named 
GAESA, controlled by the Cuban mili-
tary. So everything comes through 
their hands. 
You want to send them food? That is 
great. Guess who gets it: ALIMPORT, 
which is a government, military-owned 
agriculture company. You can’t sell it 
to a small grocery store in Cuba or 
even a food wholesaler. It goes to the 
Cuban Government. 
You want to send money? They take 
it. Do you know why? Because social-
ism is about control, and all of these 
things—tourism, food, money, medi-
cine—it is all about control. 
You want humanitarian aid? Let’s 
get the Red Cross. Any of these vetted 
NGOs in the world should be allowed to 
go into Cuba. They won’t allow it—A, 
because it is embarrassing to them. 
They have a world class healthcare sys-
tem. Why do they need humanitarian 
aid? But, B, because they want to con-
trol it. 
Send them vaccines, but if you put 
them in their hands—the government, 
the regime—guess who gets the vac-
cine: the people who behave; first, the 
regime elites and then the people who 
behave. If you are not behaving and if 
you are not going along with what they 
want you to do, you won’t get a vac-
cine. 
They will use any opening as a tool 
and as a weapon against their people 
because that is what socialism does. 
That is what these Marxists do in 
Cuba. They will use anything as a 
weapon against the people of Cuba. 
What can we do is what people want 
to know. No. 1, I hope that we will all 
be clear about whose side we are on. 
You don’t have to even agree with any-
thing I have said. What you should 
agree with is that people everywhere in 
the world, including 90 miles from our 
shore, should be allowed to go into the 
street, peacefully march, call for an 
end of dictatorship, and not have their 
heads cracked open. 
By the way, no one in Cuba has guns, 
except the military. So why are these 
repressive forces walking around with 
these rifles and people are getting 
shot? They are shooting people that 
literally are unarmed. 
They should be able to do that, and it 
should be clear. We should be clear in 
our language. We don’t just condemn 
this tyranny. We condemn this com-
munist, this Marxist, this socialist tyr-
anny. Call it for what it is. 
No. 2, we should make clear that 
nothing is going to change. There is 
not going to be any sanctions changed 
as a result of this. On the contrary, I 
hope the Biden administration will now 
announce that they have finished their 
review of Cuba policy, and everything 
that is in place is staying in place. 
To the extent we change policy, No. 
3, I hope we make it a top priority to 
allow the people of Cuba to have free, 
unfettered, and open internet access. 
And the technology exists to do that 
with 
a 
satellite-based 
system. 
We 
should put the best minds to work on 
getting that done because if the Cuban 
people have free and unfettered access 
to the internet—the first thing the re-
gime shut down yesterday was the 
internet—they can communicate with 
each other, and they can receive infor-
mation and communicate with the 
world. Ninety miles from our shore, 
you should be allowed to do that. 
No. 4, for all of those who believe and 
have faith in the international commu-
nity—and I still hold hope that one day 
it will work again—where is Spain? 
Where is the EU? Where are all these 
countries that for years have given 
cover and protection to the Cuban re-
gime and condemned America? They 
should speak out clearly that what is 
happening there is wrong and that re-
pression is wrong. We should rally 
that. We should use our position of 
strength and power in the world and 
our influence in diplomatic circles to 
make that happen. 
And, No. 5, I hope the President will 
be very clear with the regime in Cuba 
that we will not tolerate them encour-
aging a mass migration event—because 
I am warning you, this is what they do. 
They have done it twice already. They 
step back and they say: Look, if you 
don’t lift sanctions, if you don’t go 
back to the Obama-era policies, and if 
you don’t get rid of the embargo, it is 
inevitable that you are going to have 
50,000 people take to the ocean and 
head toward the United States. 
They have used that against us 
twice. They did it in 1994, and they did 
it in 1980 with the Mariel boat lift. 
President Biden needs to be clear, 
whether it is through private channels 
or saying it publicly—be abundantly 
clear that we will treat the encourage-
ment of mass migration toward the 
United States as a hostile action and 
act accordingly. That cannot—can-
not—be tolerated. 
I want to close with this. I recognize 
that most of the Members of this 
Chamber, most of the people here in 
Washington, and, frankly, most of the 
people in the country do not pay atten-
tion to Cuba on a daily basis. I get it. 
I really do. But if you are not following 
the issue of Cuba, you can be forgiven 
for not knowing that what we are see-
ing, what we saw yesterday, what we 
are seeing today, what happened re-
cently—none of this—was started by 
politicians. It wasn’t started by me. It 
wasn’t started by anybody in Miami or 
in Florida. It wasn’t started by any 
think tank in Washington. It wasn’t 
even started by political activists in-
side of Cuba. 
Do you know who started what is 
happening in Cuba? Artists, poets, 
songwriters, writers, actors, musicians. 
They are the ones who started it—the 
San Isidro Movement—because they 
came after them. 
And there is a song. A lot of people 
don’t realize it. There was a song that 
came out earlier this year—a song 
that, by the way, if you play in Cuba, 
you will go to jail. The song’s name is 
‘‘Patria y Vida.’’ Now, the slogan of the 
Cuban regime is ‘‘Patria o Muerte,’’ 
meaning ‘‘Fatherland or Death.’’ This 
song played on that, and it says, 
‘‘Patria y Vida,’’ which means ‘‘Fa-
therland and Life,’’ instead of ‘‘Father-
land or Death.’’ And the song is ex-
traordinarily powerful because it was 
written by people and sung by people 
who have lived this reality and are liv-
ing this reality. It so powerful. As I 
said, you will go to jail in Cuba if you 
play it. 
What the song basically says in its 
lyrics is: Why can’t people think in dif-
ferent ways and not be treated as en-
emies? Why is life so good for party in-
siders and their families but there is no 
food for average Cubans? There seems 
to be no embargo for the Cuban regime 
and their family members. Why can 
you build luxury hotels while our 
homes are crumbling? Why do Cubans 
have to suffer the indignities—the in-
dignities—the simple things like not 
being able to bathe with soap, not 
being able to use deodorant, not having 
toothpaste—why do they have to deal 
with these indignities? And who—the 
song also asks—who told the regime 
that Cuba belongs to them and only 
them? Shouldn’t it belong to all 13 mil-
lion Cubans? 
The chorus I will read first in 
English, and then I will translate it in 
Spanish, because it actually plays on 
‘‘dominoes.’’ Dominoes is a very pop-
ular game played by Cubans. It is 
played by everybody, but Cubans, in 
particular. It is a big game there. 
The chorus reads: 
(English translation of statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
And how it translates is that it basi-
cally says: 
It’s over. Your 59— 
Meaning 1959, the year that Castro 
took over— 
But I have double twos. 
And everyone knows that in the dom-
inoes game, if, at the end of a chain,

both dominoes, no one has any dom-
inoes to put down, the game gets 
locked, and you count numbers and 
count dots to see who won. 
So it says: 
It’s over. Your 59, but I have double twos. 
It’s over. Sixty years with a domino game 
locked up for us. 
Now, I know this is a very colloquial 
Cuban way of expressing it, but this is 
incredibly powerful. The people in 
Cuba understood what that means, and 
that means that all this ideology, all 
this stuff they talk about, and all these 
lies of the regime that worked out real-
ly well for them, people don’t believe it 
anymore, and they are not afraid any-
more. Meanwhile, their lives are ru-
ined. Young people in Cuba, artists in 
Cuba who realize that the only country 
on this planet were Cubans are not suc-
cessful is Cuba, and they are tired of it, 
and we should stand with them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Ms. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise today to once again call for every 
Senator to have an opportunity to vote 
on a generational bill to fix how the 
military deals with sexual assault and 
other serious crimes. 
It is the Military Justice Improve-
ment and Increasing Prevention Act. 
This bill will ensure that men and 
women who serve in our military have 
the opportunity for basic justice, basic 
civil liberties, and basic protection 
under the law. 
I want to start by recognizing the 
monumental advance toward military 
justice reform made during our Senate 
work week. The Independent Review 
Commission on Sexual Assault in the 
Military released their recommenda-
tions, which included removing the 
prosecution of sexual assault and re-
lated crimes from the chain of com-
mand. It is a historic sign of progress 
after decades of obstruction. 
The Secretary of Defense has agreed 
with the Commission’s findings that 
the removal of sexual assault prosecu-
tions from the chain of command and 
the professionalization of the military 
justice system would benefit survivors 
and in no way diminish good order and 
discipline. It is also a historic sign of 
progress that President Biden has en-
dorsed all of these recommendations. 
After years—years—of pushing for 
these types of reforms, this change in 
thinking from our military and execu-
tive leadership is truly momentous. 
Every crime that the IRC reviewed, 
they recommended removing it from 
the chain of command. That is a clear 
recognition that the current military 
justice system is not capable of ad-
dressing the epidemic of sexual assault 
among our ranks and that it is not pro-
viding justice for our servicemembers. 
As President Biden said, ‘‘This is the 
beginning, not the end of our work.’’ 
While 
I 
welcome 
the 
IRC’s 
rec-
ommendations, I am deeply heartened 
to see that Secretary Austin and Presi-
dent Biden both endorse the rec-
ommendations and will happily work 
with us to make them a reality. We 
also have to recognize that the IRC was 
provided a very limited task—to review 
only sexual assault and harassment in 
the military. No other crimes were 
under their purview. Unfortunately, 
they were also not asked to look at 
other serious crimes that are related, 
such as murder. 
We as a Congress have been tasked 
with a larger job. It is our job to ensure 
that the military writ large works for 
every servicemember. The recent scan-
dals at Fort Hood, the murder of 
Vanessa Guillen, and the deep racial 
disparities in prosecutions have made 
it plain that the need for reform in the 
military justice system goes far beyond 
sexual assaults. Vanessa Guillen was 
murdered, and she was harassed. Seri-
ous crimes such as murder deserve the 
consideration of military lawyers who 
are trained with expertise, not com-
manders. 
For those who worry about the im-
pact that this reform would have on 
command authority, I would point to 
the head of the IRC, the chairwoman, 
Lynn Rosenthal, who said: 
The IRC rejects the notion that, by remov-
ing legal decisions about prosecution from 
the command structure, that commanders 
have no role. It’s simply not the case. Com-
manders are responsible for the climates 
they create. They’re responsible for working 
to prevent sexual assault and sexual harass-
ment, and they’re responsible for making 
sure that victims are protected when they 
come forward to report. So, the idea that 
they won’t have an interest in solving this 
problem if they are not making [a] technical, 
legal [decision], we think, is simply false. 
The same logic extends to all serious 
crimes. Commanders will still be re-
sponsible for setting the culture that 
prevents them, for protecting victims, 
and for maintaining an interest in solv-
ing these problems even if they are not 
making these complex, technical deci-
sions about whether or not a case 
should go to trial. And in a great num-
ber of these cases that do not go for-
ward to trial, they come back to the 
commander for the commander to use 
his 
discretion—nonjudicial 
punish-
ment, summary court-martial, or spe-
cial court-martial—the many tools he 
still has. 
We must guarantee that we have a 
professional, unbiased system for all 
servicemembers. It is our constitu-
tional duty to provide oversight and 
accountability over the Department of 
Defense. We are the authors of the 
military justice code. We are the ones 
who put it in place. It is Congress’s 
duty to update it and to make sure it 
works. We can do that by taking this 
momentum and building upon it and 
passing the Military Justice Improve-
ment and Increasing Prevention Act 
this year. We have the votes to pass it 
in committee. We have the votes to 
pass it on the floor. This is an issue we 
have been fighting for and talking 
about and having hearings on for 8 
years. 
I began calling for a full vote on the 
floor on this bill on May 24. Since then, 
an estimated 2,744 servicemembers will 
have been raped or sexually assaulted. 
More will have been victims of other 
serious crimes. All of them deserve jus-
tice, and it is our responsibility to pro-
vide it. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that, at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader, in consultation with the Re-
publican leader, the Senate Armed 
Services Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours for debate equally 
divided in the usual form; and that 
upon the use or yielding back of that 
time, the Senate vote on the bill with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I object to 
the Senator’s request for the reasons 
that I have previously stated. 
As the Senator from New York ac-
knowledged, on July 2, President Biden 
announced that he ‘‘strongly supports’’ 
the recommendations put forth by Sec-
retary Austin based on the work of the 
Independent Review Commission that 
would reform how the military pros-
ecutes sexual assault-related crimes. 
Subsequent to the President’s state-
ment, the administration forwarded to 
the committee their legislative pro-
posals to implement this reform. 
I support and commend the Presi-
dent, the Secretary, and the IRC lead-
ership and staff for their work, and I 
look forward to working with them and 
the administration and my colleagues, 
particularly my colleagues on the 
Armed Services Committee, to enact 
this historic and momentous change to 
the Department of Defense. 
Sexual assault is an unconscionable 
crime and a pervasive problem in the 
military and in American society. 
While the military has taken steps to 
try to stop sexual assault in the ranks, 
it simply hasn’t been enough. I strong-
ly agree with the President’s state-
ment that ‘‘sexual assault in the mili-
tary is doubly damaging because it also 
shreds the unity and cohesion that is 
essential for the functioning of the 
U.S. military and to our national de-
fense.’’ 
While this change will be important, 
enhancing prevention, education, and 
command climate and culture will also 
be vital. If this reform to the UCMJ is 
the only thing we do, then I think that 
it will not be successful on its own. We 
need to prevent these crimes, not sim-
ply prosecute them. 
I understand that my colleague from 
New York, Senator GILLIBRAND, dis-
agrees with the proposed scope of this 
reform. Nevertheless, I want to ac-
knowledge her leadership on this issue. 
She has fought for 8 years for this re-
form, and that day, with respect to sex-
ual assault, is coming. Indeed, just as a 
footnote, the legislation that is being 
advanced would include every crime in-
cident to a sexual assault, so that if a

victim is subject not just simply to 
sexual assault but to other crimes in 
that incident, all those crimes are to 
be tried together. So the need to im-
port crimes like murder and arson and 
other nonsexual related crimes is, in 
my view, not going to accomplish the 
goals that I think this Senate has been 
focused on, particularly over the last 6 
months or so. 
I intend to include the administra-
tion’s proposals in next week’s markup 
at the annual Defense bill, subject to 
amendment. I think that is important 
to know—subject to amendment, that 
the UC as proposed would not allow 
amendments. It would not allow col-
leagues on the floor to come up and 
say: I have a better idea. We will do 
that in the committee, as we have al-
ways done it in the committee or at 
least tried to do it in the committee. 
I look forward to working with Sen-
ator GILLIBRAND
and my other col-
leagues in the committee as we con-
sider, debate, and vote on this and 
other proposals, but I still must reit-
erate my objection to the unanimous 
consent request. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. First of all, our 
bill is entitled ‘‘Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act,’’ so, as the chairman has re-
quested, there is a great deal of preven-
tion in this bill. And I dare say, if the 
chairman was going to include all of 
the recommendations of the IRC, we 
would have a very strong base bill on 
which to work from, but I do not have 
the sense that that will be done. In 
fact, I do not have the sense that all 
the recommendations are being consid-
ered, so I intend to offer an amendment 
that 
encompasses 
all 
of 
the 
rec-
ommendations. 
Second, the reason why murder and 
other serious crimes must be included 
is because there are two challenges 
within the military: One, sexual as-
sault cases are not handled properly, 
and unfortunately too few go to trial 
and too few end in conviction. The rate 
of going to trial and the rate of convic-
tion has gone down. 
The second reason is, if you only 
allow sexual assault cases to have a 
proper 
review, 
you 
will 
further 
marginalize survivors of sexual assault, 
who, more often than not, are women 
who report those cases, because receiv-
ing special treatment and a special 
legal system will not create fairness 
within the military for them. 
Third, there is enormous evidence in 
the last 3 years of considerable racial 
bias against Black and Brown service-
members. In the marines, if you are a 
Black man, you are up to 2.6 times 
more likely to be punished. That is a 
serious problem, and this is an issue 
that has been investigated for a long 
time. 
So I believe that the bright line of 
felonies, as our allies have already 
done in the UK, Israel, Canada, Nether-
lands, 
Germany, 
and 
Australia, 
is 
meaningful because they did it for de-
fendants’ rights, they did it to profes-
sionalize their military justice system, 
and they did it to protect all service-
members. Servicemembers in the U.S. 
military deserve nothing less. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session and 
be in a period of morning business, 
with Senators permitted to speak 
therein for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF SOUTH 
SUDAN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to acknowledge the 10th an-
niversary of South Sudan’s independ-
ence. July 9 is a bittersweet day for the 
resilient people of South Sudan. For 
decades, South Sudanese fought a bru-
tal war with the government in Khar-
toum in which 2 million people lost 
their lives. After decades of bloody 
struggle, the parties to the conflict 
signed the 2005 Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement, CPA, which provided for 
self-determination for the South and 
paved the way for South Sudan’s inde-
pendence in 2011, with the diplomatic 
support of the United States and others 
in the international community. 
Yet the promise of South Sudan’s 
independence has turned into tragedy. 
Deep fault lines that emerged during 
the country’s long struggle for inde-
pendence, accentuated by rivalry and 
rent seeking among the country’s cor-
rupt political elite, brought about ca-
tastrophe. A little over 2 years after 
independence, 400,000 people were killed 
and more than 4 million were displaced 
during the 5-year civil war between 
forces 
loyal 
President 
Salva 
Kiir 
against those aligned with Vice-Presi-
dent Riek Machar. Unspeakable atroc-
ities were committed against civilians 
during the conflict, including women 
and children. In 2017, the war induced a 
famine that brought hundreds of thou-
sands more to the brink of disaster. 
The United States and its inter-
national partners have invested heav-
ily in diplomatic efforts to support and 
end to the conflict in South Sudan. De-
spite failed cease-fire agreements and 
the intransigence of the warring par-
ties, in 2018 regional leaders working 
through the InterGovernmental Au-
thority on Development, IGAD, were fi-
nally able to obtain agreement on what 
was called the Revitalized Agreement 
on the Resolution of Conflict in South 
Sudan, R-ARCSS. Although far from 
ideal, the agreement lays out a frame-
work for a peaceful resolution of the 
conflict, political reform, and demo-
cratic transition. 
But implementation of the agree-
ment remains slow, and South Sudan 
sits at a very dangerous crossroad. Re-
sponsible parties have failed to imple-
ment 
major 
provisions 
of 
the 
R- 
ARCSS, including those on power-shar-
ing, constitutional development, secu-
rity sector reform, economic issues, 
and 
transitional 
justice, 
or 
have 
reneged on their commitments. Nonsig-
natories to the R-ARCSS continue to 
wage an active insurgency, particu-
larly in Equatoria. Locally rooted com-
munal violence is also rampant, fueled 
by the invisible hand of rival national 
political elites. Kiir’s security appa-
ratus continues to violate the human, 
civil, and political rights of the South 
Sudanese people. Overlaying all of 
these problems is an urgent humani-
tarian crisis—driven by conflict in-
duced food insecurity, displacement, 
and COVID–19—made all the more 
worse by longstanding efforts by the 
Government of South Sudan to under-
cut humanitarian access. 
It is clear that South Sudan’s stalled 
peace process needs a reboot. The lack 
of progress on implementation of the 
R-ARCSS has created significant con-
cern about elections now slated for 
2022—if they are even held. And if they 
are held, without prior implementation 
of core components of the agreement 
and other key actions, the polls could 
be a flash point for conflict and vio-
lence. 
In order to prevent this outcome, 
South Sudanese leadership, the United 
States, 
and 
international 
partners 
must take urgent action. 
Political leadership in Juba must im-
mediately organize a process for robust 
and inclusive negotiations over a new 
constitution in a process that involves 
all South Sudanese stakeholders, in-
cluding civil society and holdout rebel 
groups. While I would not presume to 
dictate what the South Sudanese peo-
ple themselves might decide, it seems 
to me that devolution of power from 
the national government to the states 
and local administration, and genuine 
power-sharing at the national level are 
necessary ingredients to avoid the win-
ner-take-all calculus that has served as 
an incentive to take and hold on to 
central power at any cost. 
Regional neighbors must act as well. 
Ongoing instability in East Africa, in-
cluding the war in Tigray, a fragile 
transition in Sudan, and political tur-
moil in Somalia, has distracted re-
gional actors who traditionally engage

July 12, 2021 
on South Sudan issues. This must 
change. Capitols in Africa, working 
through the African Union, AU, and 
IGAD, must ensure that peace in South 
Sudan is at the top of the agenda for 
policymakers. Working with the Euro-
peans and other partners, the United 
States should actively support the ef-
forts of the African stakeholders to re-
habilitate South Sudan’s broken peace 
process. 
The United States also has a promi-
nent role to play. The relationship be-
tween South Sudan and the United 
States runs deep. For decades the 
United States has been the leading 
donor to South Sudan, including major 
contributions from U.S. civil society. 
U.S. diplomacy has long supported the 
South Sudanese cause and was critical 
to the signing of the CPA. After inde-
pendence, the United States remained 
firmly engaged in supporting South 
Sudan, both through its bilateral en-
gagement and participation in the 
Troika. That tradition must continue 
and there is no time to waste. I encour-
age the Biden administration to take 
four steps: 
First, appoint an experienced Ambas-
sador to South Sudan, someone who 
has served as an Ambassador in the re-
gion who is familiar with the history of 
the relationship. 
Second, the administration should 
pursue additional bilateral and multi-
lateral sanctions on South Sudanese 
political actors where needed, includ-
ing on those who obstruct the delivery 
of humanitarian aid. In that same vein, 
it should support the continuation of 
the U.N. arms embargo and regularly 
name parties that violate the embargo 
and hold them accountable. 
Third, the corruption that has long 
fueled South Sudan’s political crisis 
must be confronted head on. The 
United States and its partners must de-
mand full transparency from the Gov-
ernment of South Sudan on its oil ac-
counts: the international community 
must know what revenue is coming in 
and what expenditures are being made. 
Kiir’s foot-dragging on public financial 
management has persisted for years; it 
is well past time that Juba face con-
sequences. The United States must use 
its voice and vote at international fi-
nancial institutions to oppose all budg-
et support to the Government of South 
Sudan and urge an end to all programs 
that do not directly benefit the health 
and welfare of the South Sudanese peo-
ple until and unless the government is 
willing to open its books to donors and, 
more importantly, the South Sudanese 
people. 
Finally, ending the cycle of conflict 
and despair in South Sudan will re-
quire accountability for past crimes 
and atrocities. The lesson of 8 years of 
conflict 
in 
South 
Sudan 
is 
that 
progress is impossible in a climate of 
impunity. Yet, despite support to the 
AU Hybrid Court for South Sudan from 
the United States and other donors, 
the AU has failed to fulfill its respon-
sibilities, and the Hybrid Court re-
mains in limbo. Justice delayed is jus-
tice denied. With our allies in tow, the 
Biden administration must make clear 
to relevant stakeholders at the AU and 
in Juba that further delay on the issue 
of transitional justice is unacceptable. 
If these parties do not act, the Biden 
administration should work with allies 
to pursue alternative justice and ac-
countability mechanisms. 
Mr. President, I congratulate the 
people of South Sudan on this mile-
stone. Their independence was hard 
won. I only wish their leaders had 
treated them better. At this critical 
moment, the United States must stand 
with all South Sudanese in their pur-
suit of justice, democracy, and equi-
table development. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TODD CROUCH 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the service of Todd 
Crouch, my director of state oper-
ations, who retired from my office and 
the U.S. Senate on June 30, 2021. 
Todd has spent nearly 22 years as a 
valued member of my staff. A graduate 
of the University of Wisconsin-Madi-
son, Todd first joined my State assem-
bly staff in 1997 as an intern. By a 
stroke of luck on both of our parts, 
Todd was assigned to my office to com-
plete his coursework. He would later 
tell me that he didn’t know much 
about me and my work in the assembly 
but had heard that I was smart, hard- 
working, and a good listener. I quickly 
learned that I could say the same 
about Todd. 
After my election to the U.S. House 
of Representatives in late 1998, Todd 
joined my office as a field representa-
tive. Todd worked directly to serve 
constituents in our Madison area dis-
trict, visiting organizations and busi-
nesses and serving as my representa-
tive at countless community events. 
He set up listening sessions through 
the district and staffed me at those 
events. Some listening sessions pre-
sented special and occasionally dra-
matic challenges. Todd nimbly navi-
gated us through the occasional unex-
pected attendee with creativity and 
good humor. 
In 2001, Todd transitioned to a role as 
our district office manager and district 
scheduler. This dual role highlighted 
some of Todd’s greatest skills. An orga-
nized and methodical scheduler, he 
handled sticky situations with great 
care, including delayed flights, last 
minute cancellations, and many com-
peting demands on limited time. He 
ran our district offices with a close at-
tention 
to 
detail, 
ensuring 
their 
smooth operation and providing our 
State staff with a steady hand to turn 
to when trouble arose. 
Todd remained in this dual role until 
my election to the U.S. Senate in 2012. 
I was fortunate to have Todd continue 
on my U.S. Senate staff. Initially serv-
ing as my Madison office director, 
which had expanded far beyond the size 
of our district office, Todd’s role even-
tually grew to encompass all of our 
State operations. He managed our of-
fices 
in 
Madison, 
Milwaukee, 
La 
Crosse, Eau Claire, and Green Bay, as 
well as our mobile office, affection-
ately known to us as The Beast. Todd 
later added several additional support 
roles, including two short stints as a 
pinch-hitter State scheduler, as well as 
coordinating our Grants and Special 
Projects portfolio. 
Outside of the office, Todd is a de-
voted husband and father. He and his 
husband James Bond are the proud par-
ents of their energetic young sons, 
Derrion and SJ. Todd and James are 
also longtime committed foster par-
ents who have an open door to a wel-
coming and loving home. 
I am fortunate to have had Todd as a 
valued member of my staff for these 
past many years, and I know that my 
staff, both past and present, feel the 
same. He has a sneaky and delightful 
sense of humor, which often helps re-
lieve a tense or difficult situation. He 
is diligent in his approach to his work 
and to public service and leads by ex-
ample. Along with my entire U.S. Sen-
ate staff, I wish him all the best as he 
begins a new chapter with his well-de-
served retirement.

150TH ANNIVERSARY OF GLC 
MINERALS 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the 150th anniversary of 
GLC Minerals, a fifth-generation, fam-
ily owned company that has contrib-
uted to the growth and success of the 
city of Green Bay and Northeast Wis-
consin since 1871. 
Wisconsin’s indigenous Tribes lived 
in this area for thousands of years and 
recognized the strategic importance of 
the bay of Green Bay. The confluence 
of river and lake contributed to the 
success of their thriving communities. 
In 1634 the first European explorer, 
Jean Nicolet, arrived on the shores of 
Green Bay, and the development of this 
city on our country’s western frontier 
was launched. As the community of 
what is now greater Green Bay grew, 
eager, hard-working settlers with an 
entrepreneurial spirit arrived to build 
an economy rooted in iron smelting, 
timber, 
and

Hurlbut, Sr., was one of these indus-
trious settlers and in 1871 established 
the Hurlbut Calcium and Chemical 
Company. 
The generations that followed hon-
ored the vision of Fred Hurlbut, Sr., 
and as the economy grew and changed, 
so did the company. In 1940, the com-
pany moved to the shores of the Fox 
River. In 2015, the business received its 
final name change to GLC Minerals. 
And today, as we celebrate the 150th 
anniversary, GLC Minerals remains an 
anchor of our Green Bay community as 
a successful manufacturer of calcium 
and magnesium carbonate products 
used in animal feed, mineral fillers, 
pollution filters, and soil conditioners. 
Mr. President, in Wisconsin, we make 
things. We are known for our brats and

so much more diverse. GLC Minerals 
represents that diversified economic 
base that has propelled our State for-
ward as a great place to work, live, and 
raise a family. As a custom manufac-
turer of minerals and applications, 
GLC Minerals contributes to our dairy, 
poultry, glass, paper, construction, and 
agricultural sector. I applaud fifth-gen-

Garner, II, for his wise stewardship of 
this vital Wisconsin business and wish 
GLC Minerals and the Garner family 
great success in the next 150 years.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO EDWIN REYES 
DEQUIROS 
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Edwin Reyes 
DeQuiros, a dedicated servant to the 
great people of West Virginia. After a 
34 year career, Edwin is retiring as an 
Immigration Services Officer for the 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Serv-
ices Application Support Center office 
in Charleston, WV. 
Edwin is a joy to work with and has 
served as a valuable and consistent li-
aison between USCIS and my office. 
His goal is to try to assist the cus-
tomers to the best of his knowledge 
and experience but not to the extent of 
compromising U.S. immigration laws 
and the USCIS policies and regula-
tions. 
Born and raised in the Philippines, 
Edwin is no stranger to the legal immi-
gration process. In January of 1981, he 
married a young beautiful woman from 
Charleston, WV. Based upon this mar-
riage and her approved immigration 
petition, the U.S. Embassy in Manila, 
Philippines, issued an immigrant visa 
for him as the spouse of a U.S. citizen. 
In September 1982, he and his wife, 
along with their then 10-month-old son, 
arrived in Los Angeles, CA. Finding a 
job in L.A. was difficult and frustrating 
as a new immigrant with no work expe-
rience in the United States in addition 
to not having a vehicle. 
In November 1982, an experience he 
credits to the grace of God and an-
swered prayer, he was hired by the 
Broadway Department Store, sister 
company of Neiman-Marcus, as a mer-
chandise handler. His job was to unload 
merchandise from the semi-trucks to 
the stockrooms. A year later, he was 
promoted to a plainclothes loss preven-
tion 
officer 
tasked 
with 
arresting 
shoplifters. Two years later, he became 
the loss prevention manager of the 
same store, and one of his duties was to 
apprehend dishonest store employees. 
He became a naturalized citizen of the 
United States in July of 1986. 
In November 1987, he saw an adver-
tisement in the Los Angeles Times 
that the legacy INS—now the United 
States Citizenship and Immigration 
Services—was hiring a Criminal Inves-
tigator/Special Agent. Edwin was hired 
and became an INS Special Agent, at-
tended the Immigration Officer Basic 
Training Course at the Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center in Bruns-
wick, GA, and was assigned to various 
units—Fraud, 
Employer 
Sanctions, 
Anti-Smuggling, Criminal Alien Appre-
hension Program, and the Violent 
Gang Task Force—within the INS In-
vestigation Branch. 
Nine years later, he transferred to 
the 
INS 
Investigation 
Branch 
in 
Charleston, WV, eventually named Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement, 
ICE. During his time as an ICE Senior 
Special Agent, he was assigned to in-
vestigate child pornography cases, im-
port and export law violations, and 
human trafficking/smuggling cases. 
After more than 20 years of combined 
and exemplary service with legacy INS 
and ICE, Edwin retired on September 
29, 2008. Three days later, he was hired 
on a government contract as a Special 
Deputy U.S. Marshal with the U.S. 
Marshal Service in Charleston, WV. On 
January 30, 2012, he became an Immi-
gration Services Officer for the United 
States Citizenship and Immigration 
Services’ Application Support Center 
office in Charleston, WV. 
Edwin and his wife of 40 years, Chris-
tine, are the parents of two children, 
Adrian and Jeremy. In retirement, 
they will enjoy time with family, 
riding their road bikes, traveling and 
walking the trail paths along the 
Kanawha River. Edwin truly believes 
that wherever God leads him and how-
ever he serves Him, he can be used by 
God to help others shine His light. We 
thank Edwin for his service and for 
shining his light for those on the immi-
gration path. It is a pleasure to call 
Edwin DeQuiros a fellow West Vir-
ginian.∑

TRIBUTE TO MAURICE MAILHOT 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize Maurice Mailhot of 
Berlin as June’s Granite Stater of the 
Month. Maurice, a veteran who served 
in the Korean war and received two 
Purple 
Hearts 
during 
his 
service, 
worked diligently to help redesign Vet-
eran’s Memorial Park in Berlin. Start-
ing with the memorial for the Spanish 
American 
War, 
Maurice 
worked 
through northern New Hampshire’s 
grueling winter and into the spring to 
place each war memorial centrally and 
in chronological order in the park, cre-
ating a tribute worthy of New Hamp-
shire’s veterans. 
The story of how Maurice came to re-
design the park is a testament to his 
service to his community and his in-
domitable spirit. A lifetime member of 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, 
Maurice was asked by his fellow VFW 
members to lead and coordinate efforts 
to redesign Veteran’s Memorial Park 
in downtown Berlin. As one of the old-
est members of the group, Maurice 
could have said no and enjoyed his 
well-deserved retirement, but instead, 
he not only organized the redesign but 
almost singlehandedly completed the 
construction himself. 
Maurice, working mostly alone, dug 
holes around each memorial so that it 
could be lifted by machinery to a more 
optimal spot in the park. Maurice also 
designed a new signpost for the memo-
rial park, replacing an older, wooden 
sign that failed to reflect the reverence 
that each of the war memorials is in-
tended to convey. The new sign, made 
of solid, local granite, was donated by 
Maurice to honor Berlin’s veteran com-
munity. 
Maurice embodies what it means to 
be a Granite Stater. Long after his 
brave service to our country, Maurice 
continues to serve his community and 
has gone to extraordinary lengths to 
honor his fellow veterans. I am grateful 
not only for Maurice’s service but also 
for his dedication to his community, 
and I am honored to recognize him.∑

REMEMBERING MARCIA PINDER 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have the fol-
lowing article printed in the RECORD. 
The material follows: 
[From the Daily Coach, June 30, 2021] 
REMEMBERING A FLORIDA SIDELINE LEGEND 
Some major names have stalked the side-
lines of South Florida’s high school basket-
ball gyms over the years, including Frank 
Martin, Anthony Grant and Shakey Rodri-
guez. But few have done it with the sus-
tained success of Dillard Women’s Coach 
Marcia Pinder. 
She served 44 seasons on the bench, win-
ning 996 career games while guiding the Lady 
Panthers to 10 state titles, according to the 
Miami Herald. 
Pinder died last week. She was 70. 
Beyond any of her in-game schemes or pre- 
game speeches, Pinder was a trusted con-
fidant to hundreds of teenaged girls over the 
better part of five decades. 
‘‘She was a mentor, an advocate, a second 
mom to many of her players,’’ Florida Rep. 
Omari Hardy wrote on Facebook. ‘‘She 
taught generations of young women how to 
excel on and off the court, and it was in that 
lasting, personal impact that she took the 
greatest pride.’’ 
Pinder was named Florida Dairy Farmers 
Girls’ Basketball Coach of the Year five 
times over a six-year span beginning in 2010 
and received the prestigious Morgan Wootten 
Award for Lifetime Achievement from the 
Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017, 
according to the Herald. 
She was inducted into the National High 
School Athletic Association Coaches Hall of 
Fame in 2014. 
Few high school coaches have won as many 
games as Pinder, but based on the number of 
poignant tributes that flooded social media 
following her death, it would seem safe to 
say that not many have touched as many 
lives. 
‘‘The epitome of mentorship, love, dis-
cipline and leadership,’’ tweeted Ole Miss 
Women’s Coach Yolett McCuin. 
‘‘She was more than just a Coach!’’ Auburn 
Women’s Coach Johnnie Harris tweeted. 
‘‘She impacted the lives of many people in 
many ways! She will always have a special 
place in my heart! 
Pinder’s legacy serves as yet another piv-
otal reminder to us as leaders that as much 
as we agonize over Xs and Os, our bottom 
line, promotions or firings, what we’ll be re-
membered for most is the way we uplift our 
players and employees.

‘‘My biggest thrill,’’ Pinder told the Herald 
in 2014, ‘‘comes from the girls getting into 
college and pursuing their degrees. When you 
constantly see these players get to college, it 
makes you feel good. You don’t think about 
that last loss or last win. Some of them have 
turned out to be teachers and doctors. That 
is my Hall of Fame, right there.’’ 
May Coach Marcia Pinder rest in peace.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. LEAHY: 
S. 2311. A bill making emergency sup-
plemental appropriations for the fiscal 
year ending September 30, 2021, and for 
other purposes; read the first time. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the 
weeks, I have been rising on the Senate 
floor to urge that the Senate take up 
and pass an emergency supplemental. 
So I am rising again to tell you what 
that emergency supplemental is, even 
though I have stated it over and over 
again. It is to deal with the fallout 
from the violent insurrection that took 
place at the seat of our democracy on 
January 6. 
I have been making this call for 2 
months now. I am frustrated and begin-
ning to feel a little bit like a broken 
record. Just days before this Chamber 
left for the July 4 recess, I sounded the 
alarm that time was running out. It is 
even more so today. The Senate has 
only a few weeks to act. If we do noth-
ing, the Capitol Police will deplete sal-
aries funding sometime in August. And 
for anybody who hasn’t looked at the 
calendar, that is next month. This 
means that the men and women who 
protect the seat of democracy and 
Members of Congress and their staff in 
this building and the support staff who 
keep the building running may face 
furloughs and significant impacts to 
the department’s programs and mission 
asset support, including the hiring of 
much needed new sworn officers. These 
are the same women and men who 
fought and bled—and some died—for 
everything 
this 
hallowed 
building 
stands for. That happened on January 
6. 
We owe them more than just a pay-
check. As a result of this budget 
crunch, purchases of critical equip-
ment—like respirators, ballistic hel-
mets, protective gear—and training 
that has all been delayed. Efforts to 
implement the department’s wellness 
program to address mental health con-
cerns that followed the January 6 in-
surrection have been put on the back 
burner. These police officers stood with 
us on that horrible day. Shouldn’t we 
stand with them now and pass the 
emergency appropriations to address 
these shortfalls? 
And I point out that it is not only 
the Capitol Police that we owe. Our 
distinguished Presiding Officer served 
with distinction in our military. I 
think of the days after January 6, when 
tens and thousands of men and women 
from the National Guard from all over 
the country came to secure our Na-
tion’s Capital ahead of the inaugura-
tion and beyond. They were called, 
they came, and they appeared here. 
Like many other Senators, I thank 
them for their service. But unless Con-
gress acts, the National Guard will be 
forced to cut training they need to pre-
pare for overseas deployments and re-
sponses at home to make up for the 
costs incurred as a result of January 6. 
If we have, as we often do, forest 
fires, hurricanes, and floods that hit 
our individual States, we are going to 
want to call on the National Guard. 
But what we are seeing now, if we don’t 
pass this bill, is this: Gee, come when 
we call you, and the check may be in 
the mail a year or 2 or 3 years later or 
never at all. 
Now, we don’t budget for an insurrec-
tion, but it has been 187 days since the 
violent mob stormed the very Chamber 
we are standing in now, sitting in the 
same Presiding Officer’s chair where 
our distinguished Presiding Officer now 
sits. My memory of the growing roar of 
that mob echoing down the hallway as 
the Capitol Police whisked us to safety 
has not faded. It hasn’t faded from the 
consciousness of the American people 
or the rest of the world. 
It has been 53 days since the House 
passed its own security supplemental, 
and I was shocked that not a single Re-
publican voted for it. So I provided my 
Republican colleagues here in the Sen-
ate with a proposal to address these 
pressing needs and many others. I did 
that over a month ago, and I urged 
that we begin negotiations in earnest. 
Only now have they come to the table 
with a proposal. While I appreciate 
them bringing something, it is a pretty 
small something. It is a proposal that 
does not provide the appropriate re-
sources to secure the Capitol or address 
the urgent needs that have arisen since 
January 6. 
The images of the mob breaking 
through windows and forcing their way 
through doors exposed the truth. The 
Capitol and its office buildings are not 
impenetrable. It is not a fortress. The 
windows can be broken. The doors can 
be breached. This complex is no longer 
shrouded with the protection of belief 
that it is not possible to storm these 
Halls. Much like the windows, that pro-
tection was shattered, and it was 
broadcast to the whole world on Janu-
ary 6. See, the emperor has no clothes. 
Unfortunately, the Republican pro-
posal would not adequately address our 
vulnerabilities. 
I have been very clear saying over 
and over again that I don’t want to 
militarize our Capitol in the wake of 
January 6. It is important that the 
Capitol campus that I first saw as a 
teenager with my mother and father 
remain open for citizens from all walks 
of life to come and enjoy. It is their de-
mocracy after all. But we can and we 
must invest in securing the Capitol in 
a way that will address our vulnerabili-
ties, protect Members and staff, and 
still keep us open to the public. I am 
confident that we can strike that bal-
ance. 
We also have a responsibility to pay 
for the unforeseen costs of investing 
and prosecuting these violent insur-
gents. The FBI, the U.S. Marshals, the 
DC Metropolitan Police Department, 
and numerous other law enforcement 
agencies hurried to defend the Capitol 
at the urgent call, and we are all 
thankful for that. 
Federal prosecutors have charged 
more than 500 people in more than 40 
States with participating in the at-
tack, and arrests continue almost 
daily. We have a responsibility to sup-
port these Agencies in dealing with 
January 6 and its aftermath, but it is 
not addressed in the Republican pro-
posal. I am tired of hearing people say-
ing we are in favor of law and order and 
law enforcement, but we just don’t 
want to pay for it. 
It should not be lost on us that we 
were not the ones to sweep up the shat-
tered glasses, scrub the floors and walls 
of this building on that day and 
throughout the night. We cannot turn 
our backs on the dedicated public serv-
ants, the women and men who had to 
process that trauma that day as they 
boarded up shattered windows and bro-
ken doors. And it is a trauma that 
came at the end of a yearlong pan-
demic. 
It should not be lost on us that dur-
ing the darkest hours of the pandemic, 
these are the same public servants who 
came to work to clean our offices, en-
suring our safety and the safety of our 
staff. We have a responsibility to pay 
for these and other costs that were in-
curred as a result of the pandemic on 
the Capitol Complex and its staff. 
Now, of course, we did not budget for 
an insurrection. We don’t budget for a 
global pandemic. We have been forced 
to rob Peter to pay Paul to keep our 
congressional 
community 
safe 
and 
healthy. The scars of COVID have not 
healed in our own Capitol community, 
and they have not been addressed in 
the other party’s proposal. 
But we can’t also ignore the world 
around us. We have another emergency 
brewing. This one is in Afghanistan, 
and we have a moral responsibility to 
address it. I have been talking for 2 
years now of an imminent departure 
from Afghanistan. Now it is happening, 
and we must ensure that the brave Af-
ghans who stood with America are not 
abandoned as we conclude our mission 
in that country. 
I am fortunate that there is bipar-
tisan support for this effort. I think 
this is something where Republicans 
and Democrats have to come together. 
We made a promise. Whether you sup-
ported the war or not, we made a prom-
ise to the Afghans who risked their 
own lives to support and protect our 
troops and our country. We made a 
promise to them, and as a country our 
word should be our bond. And we all 
agree—I believe both Republicans and 
Democrats—that bond is not going to 
be broken on our watch. And if we 
don’t address this now, if we don’t keep 
our word now, then when? 
The bill I am introducing today in-
cludes funds to care for the inevitable 
flood of Afghan refugees to neighboring

countries and an increase in the num-
ber of Afghan special immigrant visas. 
They must be included in this package 
because the crisis is unfolding now. 
There is no dispute about the ur-
gency and the importance of standing 
with our Afghan allies. My colleagues 
on the other side do not address it in 
their proposal. I hope they will. 
So where are we? A violent insurrec-
tion that none of us thought we would 
ever see in our lifetime happened. A 
pandemic that we thought we would 
never see in our lifetime happened. And 
the President has announced the with-
drawal of the American troops from Af-
ghanistan. These events created urgent 
needs that must be met. 
My Republican colleagues are pro-
posing that we deal with these prob-
lems piecemeal, address some of them 
now and others sometime, somewhere, 
someday. But a piecemeal approach 
that jumps from one problem to the 
next is no way to govern. I have been 
here long enough to know that a prom-
ise to do it later is no promise at all. 
It has been 53 days since the House 
passed a security supplemental, and 
only now are my Republican colleagues 
coming to the negotiating table. I 
don’t want to wait another 53 days 
more before we address these pressing 
matters. We can’t govern by crisis, and 
we can’t legislate at the convenience of 
either party. So I am introducing my 
comprehensive proposal today. 
To make sure it is not a surprise to 
anybody, I shared this proposal with 
my Republican colleagues more than a 
month ago—a month ago—and I am 
sharing it with the full Senate today. 
It addresses all the needs arising from 
the tragic events of January 6 and the 
global pandemic. 
This is the best way forward. We owe 
it to our Members in both parties. We 
owe it to our staff. We owe it to the 
Capitol Police. We owe it to the Na-
tional Guard, and we owe it to numer-
ous others. We must act, and we must 
act in a comprehensive way. We have 
only one shot at this. We have a re-
sponsibility to get it right. 
With that, Madam President, at the 
end of my remarks, I introduce a bill 
making emergency supplemental ap-
propriations for the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 2021, and for other pur-
poses. I ask to have it held at the desk. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
is received. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 2313. A bill for the relief of Maria 
Isabel Bueso Barrera, Alberto Bueso 
Mendoza, and Karla Maria Barrera De 
Bueso; to the Committee on the Judici-
ary. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I am reintroducing a bill for the 
private relief of Maria Isabel Bueso 
Barrera and her parents. Ms. Bueso is a 
Guatemalan national living in Con-
cord, California. She has a rare medical 
condition, and her removal from the 
United States would deprive her of life-
saving medical care. 
Ms. Bueso suffers from a rare, life- 
threatening 
disorder 
called 
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI (MPS– 
VI), a rare genetic condition caused by 
the absence of an enzyme that is need-
ed for the growth of healthy bones and 
connective tissues. Ms. Bueso uses a 
wheelchair for mobility, has a shunt in 
her brain, and requires a tracheotomy 
to help her breathe. 
In 2003, Ms. Bueso and her family 
came to the United States at the invi-
tation of doctors who were conducting 
a clinical trial to treat her condition. 
That trial led to Food and Drug Ad-
ministration-approved treatment for 
MPS–VI. Ms. Bueso now receives this 
life-saving treatment every week at 
UCSF Children’s Hospital in Oakland, 
CA, where she unoes a 6-hour infusion 
of a prescription drug that replaces the 
enzyme that people with MPS–VI lack. 
Ms. Bueso has participated in six other 
medical trials. 
For the past 10 years, Isabel and her 
family received deferred action from 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Serv-
ices so that she could continue receiv-
ing the treatments that keep her alive. 
This treatment is not available in Gua-
temala. 
On August 13, 2019, USCIS notified 
Ms. Bueso and her family that their ex-
tensions of deferred action were denied, 
and that they would be deported if they 
did not leave the United States within 
33 days. 
This decision was effectively a death 
sentence for Ms. Bueso. USCIS ulti-
mately reconsidered its decision and 
granted Ms. Bueso and her parents an 
additional extension of deferred action. 
Ms. Bueso has beaten the odds be-
cause of the life-saving treatment that 
she has received in the United States. 
She is now 26 years old and a 2018 grad-
uate of California State University, 
East Bay. She has become an out-
spoken advocate on behalf of people 
with rare diseases. Her family pays 
taxes, owns a home, and is active in 
their community. 
The Bueso family should be allowed 
to remain in California, where they 
will continue to enrich their commu-
nity, and where Isabel will be able to 
receive the care that allows her to sur-
vive and thrive. 
The legislation that I am introducing 
today would provide a permanent solu-
tion for Isabel and her parents. I ask 
my colleagues to support this private 
bill, which makes the Bueso family eli-
gible for issuance of an immigrant visa 
or for adjustment of status. 
I also ask unanimous consent that a 
copy of the bill be included in the 
RECORD. 
S. 2313 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR

Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall 
be determined by reference to the latest

titled 
‘‘Budgetary 
Effects 
of 
PAYGO Legislation’’ for this Act, submitted 
for printing in the Congressional Record by 
the Chairman of the Senate Budget Com-
mittee, provided that such statement has 
been submitted prior to the vote on passage.

sons to High Chief David Kahalepouli Pi‘ikoi 
and Princess Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike; 
Whereas, in 1883, Ku¯ hio¯
was named a 
Prince by royal proclamation of his uncle, 
King Kala¯kaua; 
Whereas Prince Ku¯ hio¯ attended St. Alban’s 
College and O‘ahu College in Honolulu, St. 
Matthew’s Military School in San Mateo, 
California—where he and his brothers were 
the first to introduce the sport of surfing in 
the United States—and the Royal Agricul-
tural College in Gloucestershire, England; 
Whereas Prince Ku¯ hio¯ served in the King-
dom of Hawai‘i’s Ministry of Interior and 
Customs, and later became a close confidant 
and advisor to the Kingdom of Hawai‘i’s last 
reigning monarch, Queen Lili‘uokalani; 
Whereas, on January 17, 1893, a group of 
armed sugar planters, descendants of mis-
sionaries, and financiers, from the United 
States and Europe deposed the Hawaiian 
monarchy, 
and 
imprisoned 
Queen 
Lili‘uokalani; 
Whereas a United States Minister there-
after extended diplomatic recognition to the 
Provisional Government, without the con-
sent of the Native Hawaiian people or the 
lawful Government of Hawai‘i, and in viola-
tion of international law and the treaties be-
tween the 2 nations; 
Whereas, on July 4, 1894, the Provisional 
Government reorganized as the Republic of 
Hawai‘i and adopted a constitution prohib-
iting many Native Hawaiians and citizens of 
Asian descent from voting, which frustrated 
Prince Ku¯ hio¯; 
Whereas, after failing to annex Hawai‘i to 
the United States by treaty, the United 
States took the unprecedented step of annex-
ing Hawai‘i by Joint Resolution on July 7, 
1898; 
Whereas, on April 30, 1900, President 
McKinley signed the Act of April 30, 1900 (31 
Stat. 141, chapter 339) (commonly known as 
the ‘‘Hawaii Organic Act’’), formally estab-
lishing Hawai‘i as a territory of the United 
States, even though the Native Hawaiian 
people never directly relinquished their 
claims to their inherent sovereignty as a 
people or over their national lands to the 
United States, either through their mon-
archy or through a plebiscite or referendum; 
Whereas, in 1902, Prince Ku¯ hio¯
won his 
first bid for Congress with considerable Na-
tive Hawaiian support, and continued to 
serve as Hawai‘i’s delegate from 1903 to 1921; 
Whereas, upon arriving in Washington, 
D.C., Prince Ku¯ hio¯ encountered racial preju-
dice and a general lack of knowledge about 
Hawai‘i and the Hawaiian people on the con-
tinent, including in Congress and the execu-
tive branch; 
Whereas the Governor of the Territory of 
Hawai‘i proclaimed that Prince Ku¯ hio¯ ‘‘en-
gaged in the rough and tumble of public dis-
cussion and politics with a vigor, sincerity, 
and general spirit of good sportsmanship 
that established the merits of his leadership 
among all elements . . . [and] [h]e was loyal, 
courageous, sincere, and his personal integ-
rity was never attacked even by inference’’; 
Whereas Prince Ku¯ hio¯ worked tirelessly to 
protect and perpetuate the Native Hawaiian 
people and their culture by re-establishing 
the Royal Order of Kamehameha I in 1903, 
founding the ‘Ahahui Pu‘uhonua O Na¯ 
Hawai‘i (Hawaiian Protective Organization) 
in 1914 alongside other Native Hawaiian po-
litical leaders, and helping form the Hawai-
ian Civic Clubs in 1918; 
Whereas Prince Ku¯ hio¯, as a Member of 
Congress, secured a $27,000,000 appropriation 
to improve and expand Pearl Harbor, facili-
tated construction of the Makapu‘u Point 
Lighthouse, established a Hawai‘i National 
Park covering land on Kı¯lauea, Mauna Loa, 
and Haleakala¯, shaped the foundation for 
Hawai‘i’s modern government structure by 
instituting the county system still in place 
today, sponsored the first bill for Hawai‘i’s 
statehood in 1919, and lent his support to a 
territorial women’s suffrage bill; 
Whereas Prince Ku¯ hio¯ established a home-
steading 
program 
for 
Native 
Hawaiians 
through his historic legislative accomplish-
ment, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 
1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42); 
Whereas Prince Ku¯ hio¯
was appointed as 
the first member of the Hawaiian Homes 
Commission, which continues to manage cer-
tain public lands, known as Hawaiian home 
lands, for homesteading purposes, and served 
the Native Hawaiian people in that role until 
the time of his death; and 
Whereas the Hawaiian Homes Commission 
Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) amended 
the Act of April 30, 1900 (31 Stat. 141, chapter 
339) (commonly known as the ‘‘Hawaii Or-
ganic Act’’) to set aside roughly 200,000 acres 
across the Hawaiian Islands for exclusive 
homesteading by eligible Native Hawaiians 
and continues to guide the Federal Govern-
ment’s fulfillment of its trust responsibil-
ities to Native Hawaiians as a distinct and 
unique indigenous people with a historical 
continuity to the original inhabitants of the 
Hawaiian archipelago: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and commemorates Prince 
Jonah Ku¯ hio¯ Kalaniana‘ole, a Native Hawai-
ian Delegate from Hawai‘i and lifelong advo-
cate for Hawai‘i and the Native Hawaiian 
people, including his work to pass the Hawai-
ian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 
108, chapter 42); 
(2) commits itself to affirming and uphold-
ing the special political and trust relation-
ship that Congress established between the 
United States and the Native Hawaiian peo-
ple through more than 150 separate statutes; 
and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to celebrate Prince Ku¯ hio¯’s legacy 
and the 100th anniversary of the Hawaiian 
Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, 
chapter 42).

CUBA 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise 
this evening to express my support for 
the Cuban people who have taken to 
the streets of their country to advocate 
for a government that can meet their 
basic needs of food, medicine, and po-
litical rights. 
The Cuban Government is attempt-
ing to deflect responsibility for the 
plight of its own people by blaming the 
United States of America. It is not our 
country that denies basic political 
freedoms to ordinary Cubans. The op-
pression is underscored by the fact that 
these are the first significant protests 
in Cuba in 25 years. 
The people of Cuba cannot be blamed 
for the actions of a Cuban Government

that greets those who speak out for a 
different future with violent crack-
downs. In response to the latest pro-
tests, the regime says it is ‘‘prepared 
to do anything’’ to protect the current 
system. 
Along with most all American peo-
ple, I stand in solidarity with the dem-
onstrating Cubans, and in a particular 
way, I seek to improve their lives by 
leading 
bipartisan 
legislation 
that 
would lift our country’s 60-year-old 
trade embargo with Cuba. While this 
legislation would provide a new market 
for our own farmers, ranchers, and 
manufacturers, it also deprives the 
Cuban Government of its false talking 
point that the United States is some-
how the cause of the misery of the 
Cuban people. 
After 60 years of communist rule, 11 
million Cubans deserve better. They 
deserve freedom. They deserve dignity. 
They deserve hope. We have witnessed 
this intense desire in a powerful way 
this weekend. The courage of Cubans 
who are risking their livelihoods—and 
possibly their lives—does not go unno-
ticed. They stand alongside those in 
Hong Kong, in Minsk, and in Moscow 
who challenge governments that dis-
regard inalienable rights. 
As demonstrations to enact change 
in Havana continue, I pray they be 
peaceful 
and 
effective 
at 
bringing 
about a brighter tomorrow for the citi-
zens of Cuba.
