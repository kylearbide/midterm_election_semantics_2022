PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, You have received into 
Your 
holy 
presence 
Your 
servant, 
Queen Elizabeth II. As she lays down 
her crown before Your throne, grant 
her rest from her labors and reward for 
her toil. 
Remove from her shoulders the re-
sponsibilities You bestowed upon her, 
which she bore faithfully. Honor her 
for 
the 
devotion 
she 
has 
shown 
throughout her lifetime to You and to 
Your people. 
Give peace to the people of the 
United Kingdom that in this period of 
mourning and transition, they will call 
upon their noble history and exercise 
the dignity of their heritage. Inspire in 
them the desire to uphold the divine 
values their Queen strove so diligently 
to protect. 
May her memory be a blessing and 
her virtue a standard. 
Then above all the pomp and cir-
cumstance, speak to leaders around the 
world to remind them that kingdoms 
and principalities are ever subject to 
Your will. Their rise and fall are at 
Your decree. Grant peace and pros-
perity to all who are placed in posi-
tions of power, who heed Your word 
and yield to Your authority. And may 
we who are called to serve You in these 
days, be a crown of beauty and a royal 
diadem in Your hand, O Lord our God. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
WILSON) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led 
the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A message from the Senate by Ms. 
Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that 
the Senate has agreed to a concurrent 
resolution of the following title in 
which the concurrence of the House is 
requested: 
S. Con. Res. 44. Concurrent Resolution au-
thorizing the use of the rotunda of the Cap-
itol for a ceremony to present the statue of 
Harry S. Truman from the people of Mis-
souri. 
f 
FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR 
AMERICANS 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the recently passed In-
flation Reduction Act and the massive 
financial relief it will bring to hard-
working American families. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is monu-
mental. It is historic. It will do several 
things, including: lower prescription 
drug 
prices; 
lower 
the 
cost 
of 
healthcare for millions; lower energy 
costs; and lower the deficit and reduc-
ing inflation. 
On top of this, President Biden re-
cently went a step further in helping 
Americans by announcing his remark-
able student loan relief program. This 
is huge for many young Americans. 
It is simple. House Democrats and 
President Biden are producing results 
for the American people because to-
gether, we are putting people over poli-
tics. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to cele-
brating these key victories at the 
White House this afternoon alongside 
the President and following these re-
marks I will be going straight over 
there. 
f 
RISING INFLATION 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, this morning, we received 
data that highlights once again the 
failure of the Biden administration to 
provide for our economy and to provide 
for the economic well-being of Amer-
ica. 
At home in Pennsylvania, I have 
heard stories of parents unable to af-
ford back-to-school clothes and sup-
plies for their children and patients un-
able to afford the gas to put in their 
cars to drive to doctors’ appointments. 
These problems are fruits from the 
same poisonous tree. Reckless govern-
ment spending has sent prices sky-
rocketing across our economy. Instead

of addressing this cost, liberals con-
tinue to double down by passing their 
so-called Inflation Reduction Act while 
the Congressional Budget Office now 
reports that this act will increase our 
deficit through 2026. 
The fact is simple. President Biden 
has proven that he is unable to stop the 
runaway inflation that has raised the 
cost of housing, raised the cost of gro-
ceries, and continues to affect energy 
sources throughout America. The an-
swer to this crisis will not be found in 
more government handouts. 
Now more than ever, we need to stop 
the inflation that is crippling our econ-
omy and hurting Pennsylvania and all 
American families. 
f 
NASCAR RETURNS TO NORTH 
WILKESBORO 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, on May 21, 
2023, NASCAR’s All-Star Race will re-
turn to North Wilkesboro Speedway for 
the first time in more than a quarter 
century. 
Since its inception in 1947, North 
Wilkesboro Speedway has hosted 93 
NASCAR Cup races, and has attracted 
household names, from Richard Petty 
to Dale Earnhardt, Sr. 
Mr. Speaker, NASCAR’s grassroots 
return 
to 
this 
historic 
track—its 
former stomping grounds—is a testa-
ment to the rich history of motor-
sports in western North Carolina. 
Generations of North Carolinians and 
motorsports enthusiasts from around 
the country will gather and watch his-
tory be made in North Carolina’s Fifth 
District. 
Though this event is months away, 
the anticipation and energy within the 
community are very palpable. We look 
forward to this event. 
f 
BIDENFLATION HURTS FAMILIES 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the absurd declaration of 
Biden last month of ‘‘zero inflation’’ is 
an insult to intelligence. 
Inflation is at 8.5 percent, the highest 
in 40 years. American families know 
gasoline is up 44 percent; electricity, 
up 15.2 percent; food, up 13.1 percent; 
and transportation, up 9.2 percent, de-
stroying jobs. 
Americans are fortunate to have vi-
brant radio talk shows, modern Paul 
Reveres, such as Columbia’s Morning 
News (560 AM) with Gary David and 
Christopher 
Thompson. 
Yesterday, 
they highlighted the Heritage Founda-
tion analysis that the average Amer-
ican worker has lost $3,400 in annual 
income since Biden took office due to 
Bidenflation. 
Gary revealed the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics in 2021 that Americans spent 
more on taxes than they did on food, 
clothing, and healthcare combined. The 
Federal Reserve reported that house-
hold net worth fell $6.1 trillion from 
March to June. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
moves from the safe haven in Afghani-
stan to America. 
God bless Ukraine victory. 
Queen Elizabeth II will always be 
cherished in America. 
f 
THE CARRICO FAMILY ANGELS IN 
ADOPTION RECIPIENT AWARD 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to recognize the Carrico family of 
Fancy Farm, Kentucky, who recently 
received the Angels in Adoption Award 
from the Congressional Coalition on 
Adoption Institute. 
Each year, CCAI selects individuals 
across the Nation who have dem-
onstrated a commitment to improving 
the lives of children in need of loving 
homes. 
I want to congratulate Janet, Ellen, 
Peyton, and the entire Carrico family 
on 
their 
well-deserved 
recognition. 
They opened their hearts and house by 
fostering over 10 children and adopting 
6 into their family. 
Their devotion to helping children 
extends to the Fancy Farm commu-
nity, as well. They can often be seen di-
recting and volunteering for various 
youth-centered programs within the 
St. Jerome Parish of Fancy Farm, Ken-
tucky. 
Fancy Farm and the entire First 
Congressional District of Kentucky 
should be proud of the Carrico family. 
This beautiful Kentucky family has 
shown what love can really do. 
f 
HAPPY 80TH BIRTHDAY TO KEN 
STINSON 
(Mr. FLOOD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to wish Ken Stinson from Omaha, 
Nebraska, a happy 80th birthday. 
A Notre Dame grad, a degree in civil 
engineering, two tours in Vietnam, a 
master’s degree in civil engineering 
from Stanford, he had a wonderful ca-
reer with Peter Kiewit Sons in Omaha, 
one of the Nation’s largest general con-
tractors. 
He is an accomplished engineer cred-
ited with the McHenry Tube Tunnel in 
the Baltimore Harbor, which more 
than 43 million vehicles pass through 
annually. 
He and his wife, Ann, live in Omaha 
with six children. He has changed lives 
in the State of Nebraska through his 
public service and through his philan-
thropy. Nebraska and America are a 
better place because of it. 
On behalf of the people of the First 
District of Nebraska, all Nebraskans, 
and our Nation, a very happy birthday 
to Ken Stinson. 
f 
RECOGNIZING SENATOR NICOLE 
POOLMAN 
(Mr. ARMSTRONG asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, to-
night in Bismark, there is an event 
honoring the State senate career of Ni-
cole Poolman. 
Elected in 2012, Nicole served in the 
North Dakota State senate for a dec-
ade. She used her career as a teacher to 
educate members of the Senate on how 
to 
govern 
with 
intelligence, 
com-
petence, and grace. 
Mr. Speaker, I know this better than 
most. She was my seatmate on the 
floor of the State senate for 6 years. 
Because of her friendship, I have be-
come a better public servant, and more 
importantly, I have become a better 
person. 
She is retiring from the senate to 
continue to focus on her true passion, 
teaching. 
This year marks her 25th year as an 
educator. In that time, she has taught 
in three high schools and has had such 
a positive impact on thousands of 
North Dakota students. The North Da-
kota State government is going to miss 
her dearly. But their loss is her stu-
dents’ gain. I am so very proud to call 
her my friend.

MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR LIVES 
LOST 
IN 
NORTH 
CALIFORNIA 
WILDFIRES 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in memoriam of those who lost 
their lives in the horrific wildfires that 
have once again plagued Northern Cali-
fornia this fire season. 
In what is known as the McKinney 
fire in Siskiyou County, we lost four of 
our neighbors: Kathleen Shoopman, 
who was 73; Charles Kays, 79; Judith 
Kays, 82; and John Cogan, 76—all sadly 
lost their lives in this fire. 
Yet, another fire, also in Siskiyou 
County, known as the Mill fire, two 
women, ages 66 and 73—whose names 
have not been publicly revealed yet— 
sadly lost their lives, as well. 
Season after season, our constituents 
are subject to fire danger. Our prayers 
are with the families and the souls of 
those that we have lost this season. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask for a mo-
ment of silence from the House.

marks.) 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I address 
you and this body because I know that 
you know more than most what it is 
like to have the impacts of illegal im-
migration in your State and across the 
border. 
In the town of Yuma, a town of about 
100,000 people, every day in their hos-
pital, they get 11 people who go into 
the emergency room. They get an addi-
tional four or five women every day in 
Yuma, Arizona, who go into the mater-
nity ward. Mr. Speaker, $20.4 million in 
uncompensated care was provided by 
that hospital in just the first 6 months 
of this year. 
Mr. Speaker, you and I both know 
that when the Vice President said on 
Sunday that our border is not open, she 
was not telling the truth. Our border is 
wide open, and it has inherent dangers 
and problems for the United States of 
America. 
We can close it today. I encourage 
Members of this House to join me in 
getting my discharge petition out. We 
need to close this border. 
f 
RECOGNIZING JON VAN UTRECHT 
OF OTTUMWA 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Jon Van 
Utrecht of Ottumwa. 
Since its creation in 1854 in Fairfield, 
Iowa, the Iowa State Fair has been a 
yearly tradition for Iowans, attracting 
millions of people from across the 
country. With a wide variety of enter-
tainment, food, and activities, such as 
the world-famous butter cow, it is not 
surprising why millions are attracted 
to the fair. 
Each year, farmers across Iowa are 
encouraged to enter a variety of crops 
to be judged for size, weight, and qual-
ity. One of my favorite things to do at 
the State fair is attending competi-
tions and seeing the impressive crops 
our farmers have grown. 
That is why I was thrilled to see 
Ottumwa’s Jon Van Utrecht’s pumpkin 
as one of the winners of the big pump-
kin competition. Jon’s pumpkin came 
in sixth place and weighed 300 pounds. 
Iowa’s State Fair is filled with count-
less entertainment options for families 
across Iowa and shows why Iowa is the 
best place to live, work, play, and raise 
a family. I look forward to seeing what 
next year brings. 
I would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to wish a happy birthday to 
Helen Friell. On September 23, Helen 
will become 100 years old. 
Happy birthday, Helen. 
f 
STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS IS 
MISGUIDED 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, there are 
countless 
successful 
middle 
Ten-
nesseans who did not go to college, yet 
President Biden expects them to pick 
up the tab for those who did. 
It is simply wrong to take hard- 
earned dollars from blue-collar workers 
in Tennessee who have no student loan 
debt just to eliminate some or all of 
the student loan debts of usually high-
er paid college graduates. But it is also 
blatantly unconstitutional for Presi-
dent Biden to unilaterally take this 
cynical election year action without 
the required congressional authoriza-
tion. He is, after all, the President, not 
our king or dictator. 
Further, 
this 
misguided 
decision 
comes at the cost of more than $500 bil-
lion, which will push inflation and the 
skyrocketing cost of everything even 
higher and add to the financial pain 
Tennesseans already feel from the 
record inflation caused by the Presi-
dent’s other disastrous fiscal policies. 
I ask the President to please join us 
instead of fighting us in trying to put 
our Nation’s fiscal house back in order.

ELIMINATING LIMITS TO JUSTICE 
FOR CHILD SEX ABUSE VICTIMS 
ACT OF 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
3103) to amend title 18, United States 
Code, to eliminate the statute of limi-
tations for the filing of a civil claim 
for any person who, while a minor, was 
a victim of a violation of section 1589, 
1590, 1591, 2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 
2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of 
such title. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3103 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Eliminating 
Limits to Justice for Child Sex Abuse Vic-
tims Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMI-
TATIONS. 
Section 2255 of title 18, United States Code, 
is amended by striking subsection (b) and in-
serting the following: 
‘‘(b) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.—There shall 
be no time limit for the filing of a complaint 
commencing an action under this section.’’. 
SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICABILITY. 
This Act and the amendments made by 
this Act shall— 
(1) take effect on the date of enactment of 
this Act; and 
(2) apply to— 
(A) any claim or action that, as of the date 
described in paragraph (1), would not have 
been barred under section 2255(b) of title 18, 
United States Code, as it read on the day be-
fore the date of enactment of this Act; and 
(B) any claim or action arising after the 
date of enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 3103. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 3103, the Eliminating 
Limits to Justice for Child Sex Abuse 
Victims Act of 2022 is bipartisan legis-
lation that would ensure that survivors 
of child sex abuse are not barred by a 
statute of limitations when seeking 
civil damages in court. 
Data suggests that 86 percent of child 
sexual abuse goes unreported. Also 
common is delayed disclosure, or the 
tendency of survivors of child sexual 
abuse to wait many years before dis-
closing abuse to others. 
This is because survivors of sexual 
abuse often take a long time to process 
their trauma, and many survivors who 
were abused as a child may not even 
recognize the abuse they suffered until 
much later in life. 
Unfortunately, because survivors of 
child sexual abuse often delay report-
ing, any statute of limitations may 
prevent survivors from accessing jus-
tice and seeking damages in civil 
court. 
The current Federal civil remedy 
statute for victims of child sexual 
abuse includes a statute of limitations 
requiring all claims to be filed within 
10 years of the injury or not later than 
10 years after the victim turns 18 years 
old.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7748 
September 13, 2022 
These statutes of limitation can 
serve to protect the abusers and enable 
them to continue to exploit their 
power by allowing victims’ claims to 
expire. 
This bill will enable survivors who 
are victims of Federal child sex abuse 
offenses, including aggravated sexual 
abuse, sex trafficking, human traf-
ficking, forced labor, and sexual exploi-
tation, to seek civil damages in Fed-
eral court regardless of the amount of 
time that has passed since the abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS) 
for joining Senator DURBIN in intro-
ducing this important legislation and 
recognizing that the challenges sur-
vivors face in reporting the trauma 
they have experienced should not bar 
them from accessing justice in the 
courts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support the bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 3103 eliminates the 
statute of limitations for a minor vic-
tim of a human trafficking offense or a 
Federal sex offense, to file a civil ac-
tion to recover damages. 
Studies indicate that many of these 
crimes go unreported or victims some-
times wait years to disclose their abuse 
to others under current law. A victim 
may file a Federal civil claim up until 
when the victim reaches the age of 28 
or up to 10 years after the discovery of 
the violation or injury. 
This legislation would allow victims 
of human trafficking or sex offenses to 
seek civil remedies regardless of when 
the crime took place. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ROSS), the sponsor 
of the bill. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chair of the Judiciary Committee for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am heartened that 
today we will vote to send this bill to 
the President’s desk to guarantee jus-
tice for victims of child sex abuse. 
Experts estimate that more than 85 
percent of child sex abuse goes unre-
ported. Kids experiencing abuse face a 
variety of the barriers to reporting. 
Often they don’t know how to recog-
nize abuse, they don’t know how to 
talk about their experiences, or they 
don’t have a trusted adult they can 
contact. 
Even when survivors do report their 
abuse, their experiences often fail to 
reach the people in the justice system 
who can stop the predator. For all of 
these reasons, the process of disclosure 
of abuse can take decades. The average 
age of reporting child sex abuse is 52 
years old. 
Tragically, statutes of limitations 
often prevent survivors who disclose 
their abuse as adults from getting their 
day in court. But justice systems are 
slowly beginning to understand how de-
layed disclosure impacts access to jus-
tice. 
In the past two decades, 48 States and 
Washington D.C., have amended child 
sex abuse laws to expand or eliminate 
statutes of limitations. Congress pre-
viously eliminated the Federal crimi-
nal statute of limitations for child sex 
abuse and sex trafficking and slightly 
lengthened the Federal civil statute of 
limitations. 
However, this short extension of the 
civil statute of limitations does not re-
flect current data on just how long 
most survivors delay disclosure of their 
abuse. 
All survivors deserve access to jus-
tice no matter how long it takes them 
to talk about the trauma they have 
suffered. 
Today, 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 13 boys ex-
perience sex abuse before their 18th 
birthday. I have heard about far too 
many cases of child sex abuse in my 
home State of North Carolina. 
A case currently before the North 
Carolina Supreme Court involves the 
wrestling team at a Gaston County 
high school where teenage athletes 
were sexually abused by their coach. 
While the coach was convicted and 
sentenced to decades in prison, the ath-
letes were initially unable to sue in 
civil court because of the statute of 
limitations. 
This case is currently before the 
North Carolina Supreme Court because 
a three-judge panel ruled that the 
State law opening a window for adult 
survivors of sexual abuse was unconsti-
tutional. 
We cannot provide effective remedies 
to survivors while the Federal civil 
statute of limitations remains in place. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
Representative SWALWELL, Representa-
tive 
SALAZAR, 
and 
Representative 
RESCHENTHALER for leading this effort 
with me in the House, as well as Sen-
ator DURBIN and Senator BLACKBURN 
for leading this bill in the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 3103 is bipartisan leg-
islation that would ensure that sur-
vivors of child sex abuse are not barred 
by a statute of limitations when seek-
ing justice in the courts. 
This bill recognizes that many vic-
tims of child sexual abuse delay report-
ing the trauma they have experienced. 
Therefore, it will enable survivors who 
are victims of more than a dozen Fed-
eral sex abuse offenses to seek civil 
damages in Federal court regardless of 
the time that has passed since the 
abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of S. 3103, the ‘‘Eliminating Limits to 
Justice for Child Sex Abuse Victims Act of 
2022,’’ bipartisan legislation that would elimi-
nate the statute of limitations for victims of 
federal child sexual abuse offenses to file civil 
claims against their abusers in federal court. 
This legislation would allow survivors of 
more than a dozen federal child sex abuse of-
fenses to have their day in court no matter the 
time it takes them to disclose their abuse. 
Oftentimes victims of offenses, such as ag-
gravated sexual abuse, sex trafficking, human 
trafficking, sexual exploitation, and child por-
nography require years of treatment to proc-
ess and disclose their victimization. 
This is particularly true for young victims of 
these despicable crimes, who continue to 
process trauma inflicted upon them well into 
adulthood—only to be barred by statutes of 
limitations that prevent them from holding their 
abusers accountable when they are able to 
name them. 
We have come to understand the effects of 
fear, depression, and shame that result from 
the trauma of sexual abuse, and the power 
dynamics between child victims and adult 
abusers, that explain why victims may not im-
mediately report abuse—or delay disclosure 
for decades. 
Although we extended the statute of limita-
tions in 2018 for federal civil child sex abuse 
claims for damages until the victim reaches 
age 28 or until 10 years after discovery of the 
offense, that extension does not reflect current 
findings on the delayed disclosure of child sex 
abuse. 
A study by the Institute on Domestic Vio-
lence & Sexual Assault (IDVSA) at The Uni-
versity of Texas found that, in my home state 
of Texas, there are almost 79,000 minors and 
youth victims of sex trafficking, while data from 
CHILD USA suggests that almost 90 percent 
of child sexual abuse goes unreported. 
Countless examples of delayed disclosure— 
by adults victimized as children—fill the head-
lines of newspapers, televised news reports, 
and social media posts from every corner of 
the country. 
One study of more than 1,000 survivors 
found that the average age of survivors at the 
time of disclosure was roughly 52 years old. 
Historically, statutes of limitations have si-
lenced victims and favored their abusers—al-
lowing them to escape accountability. 
However, since 2002, 49 states and 2 terri-
tories have amended their laws to extend, 
eliminate, or revive civil statutes of limitations 
for child sexual abuse. 
Congress must take note of the available re-
search, data, and trends before us, making 
certain that federal law does not deny sur-
vivors the ability to have their day in court or 
force victims into court before they are psy-
chologically ready to do so, causing further 
victimization and trauma. 
Instead, we are duty bound to ensure sur-
vivors of child sexual abuse, exploitation, and 
trafficking can seek justice against their abus-
ers regardless of the timing and, through suc-
cessful litigation, have the means to access 
life-sustaining treatment and other services 
necessary to make them whole. 
Justice should never be denied to any per-
son in this country, especially victims who 
have been robbed of their innocence and 
childhoods. 
S. 3103 is a commonsense, bipartisan bill 
that will provide a pathway to justice and heal-
ing for many victims and survivors while hold-
ing abusers accountable for the harms they

cause. I encourage my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 3103. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
EXTENSION 
OF 
AUTHORIZATION 
FOR SPECIAL ASSESSMENT FOR 
DOMESTIC 
TRAFFICKING 
VIC-
TIMS’ FUND 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
4785) to extend by 19 days the author-
ization for the special assessment for 
the 
Domestic 
Trafficking 
Victims’ 
Fund. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 4785 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION FOR 
SPECIAL ASSESSMENT FOR DOMES-
TIC TRAFFICKING VICTIMS’ FUND. 
Section 3014(a) of title 18, United States 
Code, is amended, in the matter preceding 
paragraph (1), by striking ‘‘September 11’’ 
and inserting ‘‘September 30’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 4785. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 4785 is bipartisan leg-
islation that would extend until Sep-
tember 30 of this year, 2022, the manda-
tory special assessment of $5,000 im-
posed on those convicted of certain of-
fenses involving sexual abuse, sexual 
exploitation, or human trafficking. 
Human trafficking is a multi-billion- 
dollar criminal industry that denies 
freedom to 24.9 million people around 
the world and generates more than $150 
billion annually in illicit profits. It is a 
reprehensible crime that touches com-
munities 
across 
the 
country—from 
major cities to suburban enclaves and 
rural back roads—and can cause dev-
astating, sometimes irreparable harm 
to victims who fall prey to cunning 
traffickers. 
The fight against human trafficking 
requires a comprehensive, multidisci-
plinary strategy that includes prosecu-
tion of traffickers so that they cannot 
harm again, protection of victims 
through services to increase safety and 
treat trauma, and prevention efforts to 
alleviate social vulnerabilities to ex-
ploitation. 
From providing immediate, emer-
gency care when victims are identified 
to long-term care that helps survivors 
recover from their victimization, vic-
tim assistance is vital to the Federal 
anti-trafficking strategy and efforts to 
combat sexual abuse and exploitation 
as well as child pornography, which 
continue to be a threat to our children 
and other vulnerable persons. 
The Justice for Victims of Traf-
ficking Act, commonly referred to as 
the JVTA, requires Federal sentencing 
judges to impose a special assessment 
of $5,000 on those convicted of Federal 
crimes involving sexual abuse, child 
pornography, sexual exploitation, or 
human trafficking. 
The fees collected from the special 
assessment are transferred to the Do-
mestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund and 
used to fund and enhance vital services 
and programming that assist victims 
and survivors who have been abused, 
exploited, and/or trafficked. 
This past Sunday, the provision that 
requires judges to impose the special 
assessment expired, which necessitates 
the passage of this extension until the 
end of the fiscal year when it can be re-
newed as part of other ongoing legisla-
tion to fund the government. 
Congress must do all we can to en-
sure that resources are available to 
support the needs of victims and sur-
vivors of human trafficking, sexual 
abuse, and sexual exploitation, who 
often have complex needs requiring a 
broader array of trauma-focused serv-
ices and treatment. 
Although we are considering the bill 
as introduced by Senators KLOBUCHAR 
and CORNYN, I must also thank Rep-
resentative KAREN BASS for her work 
to introduce the House companion, 
H.R. 8684, and for her continued dedica-
tion to helping victims and survivors of 
human trafficking, sexual abuse, and 
sexual exploitation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support the extension of the $5,000 
special assessment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
b 1445 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation extends 
the authorization for a special assess-
ment for the Domestic Trafficking Vic-
tims’ Fund for 19 days. The special as-
sessment is a $5,000 fine levied against 
someone convicted of certain Federal 
trafficking and sexual abuse offenses. 
These offenses include human smug-
gling, human trafficking, and sexual 
abuse of minors, among others. 
This $5,000 fine is in addition to other 
restitution or compensation that of-
fenders might be forced to pay, such as 
court-ordered fines, orders of restitu-
tion, and other fines related to victim 
compensation. 
Of course, an additional $5,000 fine 
can never adequately deter criminals 
from committing these heinous acts. A 
much more effective solution would be 
to make it more difficult for criminals 
to traffic and smuggle people across 
our borders in the first place. 
Unfortunately, House Democrats are 
flat-out unwilling to do anything to 
stop the Biden border crisis. For 21 
months, we have seen how dangerous 
criminals have exploited our open bor-
ders to smuggle people and drugs, par-
ticularly fentanyl, into our country. 
The blame for the border crisis, and 
also our crime crisis, lies squarely at 
the feet of the radical left’s agenda and 
their anti-law enforcement agenda. 
House Republicans are more than 
willing to increase penalties for human 
trafficking and human smuggling, but 
the House can and should do much 
more to address the catastrophic bor-
der crisis caused by President Biden’s 
failures. 
Literally, in 20 months, we have gone 
from a secure border to no border. It 
would help if we actually had a border 
again to deal with these issues that we 
are discussing here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
S. 4785 is bipartisan legislation that 
would extend the $5,000 special assess-
ment that provides funding to help vic-
tims and survivors of sexual abuse, sex-
ual exploitation, child pornography, 
and human trafficking, through serv-
ices, programming, and treatment tai-
lored to their specific needs. 
Each of us should make every effort 
to support programs that help rescue 
survivors of these reprehensible crimes 
and provide them with the resources 
they need to become whole again, while 
also holding perpetrators accountable 
for the harms they cause. 
I urge all my colleagues to support S. 
4785, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of S. 4785, bipartisan legislation that 
would extend the authorization of the $5,000 
special assessment for the Domestic Traf-
ficking Victims’ Fund. 
Human trafficking is one of the greatest on-
going threats to human rights in the world— 
and in this country. 
An estimated 25 percent of human traf-
ficking victims are reportedly in my home state 
of Texas, with Houston being one of the larg-
est hubs for human trafficking in the country. 
And although some populations are at greater 
risk of victimization than others, human traf-
ficking spans all races, ages, genders, and 
every socioeconomic status. 
In 2020, the National Human Trafficking 
Hotline identified more than 16,000 victims of 
human trafficking, who likely represent only a 
fraction of the actual problem. 
In that same year, the National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children received more 
than 21.7 million reports, most of which were 
related to child sexual abuse material, online

enticement, child sex trafficking, and child sex-
ual molestation. 
Victims who have been exploited or abused 
sexually or trafficked, whether for labor or sex, 
require and deserve victim-focused, culturally 
informed responses from well-trained pro-
viders and law enforcement, that direct them 
towards emergency and long-term services 
critical to sustaining them as they heal. 
Funding and grants—from the Domestic 
Trafficking Victims’ Fund to develop, expand, 
strengthen, and provide these victim services 
and programming—derive from the mandatory 
special assessment, which is imposed on per-
petrators convicted of human trafficking, sex-
ual abuse and exploitation, and child pornog-
raphy. 
Because it is our duty not only to ensure 
victims and survivors of these ghastly crimes 
are not re-victimized but also to provide them 
with services that help them successfully re-in-
tegrate into society, we must extend the au-
thorization of the $5,000 special assessment. 
I support S. 4875 and encourage my col-
leagues to do the same. 
We must also continue to shape legislation 
to improve upon the U.S. antitrafficking re-
sponse—as well as other legislation and pro-
gramming aimed at preventing sexual exploi-
tation and sexual abuse and protecting victims 
and survivors—particularly our children and 
youth. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 7566, the 
Stop Human Trafficking in School Zones Act, 
to ensure schools are safe havens for stu-
dents. 
It is my hope that my bill, which was or-
dered to be reported favorably by voice vote, 
will be brought to the floor for consideration 
soon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 4785. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-

poned.

H7751 
September 13, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 5315, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5315, the Drone Infrastructure Inspec-
tion Grant Act, legislation sponsored 
by Mr. STANTON of Arizona and Mr. 
GRAVES from Louisiana. 
In recent years, small unmanned sys-
tems, also known as drones, have been 
valuable assets in the inspection, main-
tenance, and repair of the Nation’s 
critical infrastructure. Drones have 
many 
uses, 
from 
surveying 
trans-
mission lines and inspecting bridges, to 
assessing damage from natural disas-
ters. As this aviation technology con-
tinues to evolve, State and local gov-
ernments should have the opportunity 
to leverage these systems to help iden-
tify and address the growing infra-
structure needs across the country. 
H.R. 5315 establishes a drone infra-
structure inspection grant program 
and a drone education and workforce 
training grant program at the U.S. De-
partment of Transportation to help in-
crease efficiency, reduce costs, improve 
worker safety, and reduce carbon emis-
sions related to critical infrastructure 
projects. 
Specifically, the bill authorizes com-
petitive Department of Transportation 
grants for State, Tribal, and local gov-
ernments to purchase, lease, contract 
for services, or support the operational 
management of small drones to per-
form certain infrastructure projects. 
H.R. 5315 ensures that these Federal 
funds can only be used for small drone 
technology manufactured or assembled 
by a U.S. company, includes safeguards 
for 
related 
labor 
agreements, 
and 
prioritizes projects conducted in his-
torically disadvantaged communities. 
In order to help equip the future U.S. 
transportation 
workforce 
with 
the 
skills necessary to capitalize on drone 
technology and compete globally, H.R. 
5315 also invests Federal funding in 
drone workforce training and edu-
cation programs at universities and 
community colleges. This program will 
be particularly beneficial as the U.S. 
aviation sector works to achieve a 
workforce that better reflects the di-
versity of the country as a whole. 
H.R. 5315 has the support of cospon-
sors from both sides of the aisle and 
the endorsement of several key organi-
zations representing the U.S. aviation 
and aerospace sector, and State, Trib-
al, and local governments. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter of support from these organiza-
tions.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
HOYER, MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY AND MI-
NORITY WHIP SCALISE: We write in strong 
support of H.R. 5315, the bipartisan Drone In-
frastructure Inspection Grant (DIIG) Act, 
and respectfully request that the bill be 
added to the House floor schedule. The DIIG 
Act addresses the urgent critical infrastruc-
ture inspection backlog our nation faces 
today, while also investing in the drone 
workforce of tomorrow. 
The bill’s purpose is twofold. First, it 
would authorize the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (USDOT) to provide competi-
tive grants to state, tribal, and local govern-
ments to use secure small unmanned aircraft 
systems (UAS) to perform critical infra-
structure inspections. Drones provide states 
with a safe and cost effective way to identify 
and repair critical infrastructure problems 
in early stages, saving money, time, and pre-
venting needless consumer and worker inju-
ries and death. 
Second, the bill would invest in our na-
tion’s 
future 
workforce 
by 
authorizing 
USDOT competitive grants for workforce 
training and education at institutions of 
higher education, including community col-
leges. This would position current and future 
workers to capitalize on the fast-growing 
drone economy, and help to cultivate a di-
verse workforce. To date, over 90 institutions 
have been approved by the Federal Aviation 
Administration as VAS–Collegiate Training 
Initiative Schools. This bill would nurture a 
dynamic workforce—ready to adapt to the 
technological advancements of the future. 
The DIIG Act passed out of the House 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee by a bipartisan vote of 54–4 on April 
28th. We hope you join us in supporting the 
DIIG Act by adding it to the House floor 
schedule as soon as possible. Thank you for 
your consideration. 
Sincerely,

cials (NASAO), American Association of

Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5315 is bipartisan 
legislation that addresses problems we 
have seen in the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, we had a bridge collapse 
in Minnesota; we had a bridge collapse 
in Georgia; and, more recently, right 
on the Tennessee-Arkansas line on the 
interstate, we saw a bridge collapse. 
All of these accidents that resulted 
in deaths and injuries and incredible 
impacts to traffic, they could have 
been prevented. They could have been 
prevented by lowering the threshold by 
doing safety inspections to critical in-
frastructure, like bridges; and this leg-
islation helps to facilitate that. 
Mr. Speaker, over 90 percent of the 
drones that were flown in the United 
States used to be foreign-made, in fact, 
from China. This legislation not only 
helps to facilitate the incorporation of 
drone inspection, which is cheaper, it is 
more thorough, it is more easily acces-
sible, and it lowers the threshold to 
safety inspections. It doesn’t put work-
ers at risk. But it also ensures that we 
continue making progress on this do-
mestic drone industry and no longer 
cede this leadership role to China. 
This bill ensures that this is a domes-
tic industry, U.S. technology, Amer-
ican jobs. And as the gentlewoman just 
said, this legislation also ensures that 
we have the workforce able to do this. 
This bill is for 2 years. It is not de-
signed to be in perpetuity. It is 2 years. 
It is helping to seed this industry; help-
ing to incorporate this technology into 
our State DOTs, into our programs re-
lated to utilities and transmission 
lines, and even in the aftermath of dis-
asters which, unfortunately, in my 
home State of Louisiana, we often ex-
perience. 
I thank my friend for working with 
us on a bipartisan basis on this legisla-
tion, the gentleman from Arizona, the 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. STANTON). 
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of this commonsense, bipar-
tisan legislation, and I thank Chair-
man DEFAZIO and the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES) for working 
with me on it. 
Our country must do a better job in-
specting infrastructure. There is a na-
tionwide backlog, and it is because tra-
ditional methods of inspecting critical 
infrastructure 
are 
often 
time-con-
suming, dangerous, and expensive. In-
spections are essential, though, and we 
have seen tragic results around the 
country when structural flaws go unno-
ticed. 
Modern technology has given us a 
great tool that we can use for inspec-
tions: Drones. Using a drone to inspect 
infrastructure in hard-to-reach places, 
such as underneath bridges, can speed 
up the inspection process so that we

can get through the backlog more 
quickly, and it can help save money, as 
well. 
In fact, the American Association of 
State Highway and Transportation Of-
ficials estimate that utilizing drones 
reduces the cost of infrastructure in-
spections by 74 percent and the time 
needed to conduct the inspection by 88 
percent. 
Not only that, but drone inspections 
are much safer for the workers than 
having a human hang under a tall 
bridge. It is an easy way to improve job 
safety. 
In my home State, the Arizona De-
partment of Transportation has been 
using drones for several years to in-
spect hard-to-reach areas on bridges, 
and survey near highways where falling 
rocks or ground movements are poten-
tial hazards. 
What this bill does is simple: It gives 
more States, Tribes, and local govern-
ments the opportunity to use drones. It 
creates competitive grants to purchase, 
contract for services, or develop pro-
gram capability for American-made, 
small, unmanned aircraft systems to 
perform critical infrastructure inspec-
tion, maintenance, operation, or repair 
projects. And it provides resources to 
train the next generation and upskill 
our existing workforce. 
This bill has broad support from the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National 
Association 
of 
Counties, 
National 
League of Cities, National Conference 
of State Legislatures, National Asso-
ciation of State Aviation Officials, 
American Association of State High-
way and Transportation Officials, the 
Association for Unmanned Vehicle Sys-
tems International, and many, many 
others. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important bipartisan bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7753 
September 13, 2022 
of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
247d). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 884, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
National Aviation Preparedness Plan 
Act of 2022, legislation sponsored by 
the gentleman from Washington (Mr. 
LARSEN). 
If 
there 
is 
one 
lesson 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, it is that we 
were not prepared for a pandemic and 
must be prepared for the next one. 
While a number of mitigation efforts 
were eventually implemented in avia-
tion, they should not have taken al-
most a year to put in place. In fact, in 
2015, the Government Accountability 
Office issued a recommendation to de-
velop a national aviation preparedness 
plan for communicable disease out-
breaks. 
The Government Accountability Of-
fice has since found that had the De-
partment 
of 
Transportation 
imple-
mented such a plan, it ‘‘could have im-
proved coordination between public 
health and aviation sectors during 
COVID–19 to address issues like pas-
senger screening.’’ 
H.R. 884 seeks to resolve this over-
sight by requiring the Department of 
Transportation, in collaboration with 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services and the Department of Home-
land Security, to develop a national 
aviation preparedness plan. 
That plan, at a minimum, would lay 
out the responsibilities of airports, air-
lines, and government entities in re-
sponding to future pandemics, improve 
coordination among stakeholders, and 
identify appropriate equipment to pro-
tect 
frontline 
aviation 
employees, 
among other things. 
This means we could establish the 
necessary procedures and methodolo-
gies to combat pandemics prior to their 
onset and eliminate the confusion sur-
rounding who should take action. 
Fortunately, we have come a long 
way since the start of the pandemic. 
Vaccines are widely available, daily 
COVID hospitalizations and death rates 
have decreased, and air travel is re-
turning to prepandemic levels. 
But we could have done better. This 
bill, which received overwhelming bi-
partisan support in committee, will en-
sure the lessons learned from the cur-
rent pandemic are not forgotten during 
the next one. 
For these reasons, I encourage my 
colleagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 884, the National 
Aviation Preparedness Plan Act, re-
sponds to a 2015 Government Account-
ability 
Office 
recommendation 
and 
looks to establish clear roles and re-
sponsibilities among Federal agencies 
and air transportation operators in the 
event of a communicable disease out-
break. 
I want to be clear that this bill only 
applies to future disease outbreaks, 
and it is intended to guarantee that 
the confusion we have seen among Fed-
eral agencies and air carrier operators 
is addressed and does not repeat itself 
as we saw in the past few years. 
America’s aviation sector is abso-
lutely critical to our economy. It is 
critical to moving travelers for busi-
ness, travelers to visit family, and for 
tourism purposes. Goods must be trans-
ported all across the United States and 
the globe. 
We have to make sure that we are 
able to limit, contain, and reduce the 
impact of these disease outbreaks in a 
timely, decisive, and coordinated man-
ner. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman LAR-
SEN and Chairman DEFAZIO for working 
on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I reiterate that 
this bill is only for future outbreaks. It 
only applies to future communicable 
disease outbreaks. What is more, it 
grants no additional pandemic-related 
authority to Federal agencies. It sim-
ply ensures there is a plan in place 
among U.S. carriers so they can de-
velop a timely and decisive response 
plan in the event of a future outbreak. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 884, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5774, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 5774, the 
Expediting Disaster Recovery Act, leg-
islation introduced by Mr. GRAVES of 
Louisiana. 
This legislation is designed to expe-
dite the delivery of Federal disaster as-
sistance and address the unpaid, unmet 
needs of disaster survivors. 
The authorizations in this bill allow 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency to estimate the total cost of 
disaster recovery and provide States up 
to 10 percent of this estimate when a 
major disaster is declared. 
States would be able to use these 
funds to administer a broad range of 
recovery solutions not covered by 
FEMA’s individual assistance program. 
Such activities could include home re-
pair and support for business activities. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5774 is designed to 
do two primary things. Number one, it 
is to prevent the Federal Government 
from revictimizing disaster victims. 
Number two, it is designed to save 
money. 
In the aftermath of a disaster, we 
watch as countless Federal agencies, 
the alphabet soup of Federal agencies, 
come rushing to the aid of these dis-
aster victims, offering everything from 
food assistance, housing assistance, 
and you will see them having organiza-
tions coming in and offering clothes, 
offering loans. You see all of these un-
coordinated activities. 
Yet, we have one Federal agency that 
is responsible for disasters, and that is 
FEMA, the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency. FEMA comes in, and 
what happens with all of these other 
programs? 
You 
see 
disjointed 
re-
sponses. 
Let me give you an example, Mr. 
Speaker. In the aftermath of the 2016 
1,000-year flood that we had in my 
hometown, FEMA came in and started 
offering assistance. We saw disparate 
aid offered to different folks. 
You had another recovery program 
come in and provide $1.7 billion, Mr. 
Speaker. Here we are, 6 years after this 
disaster, and of the $1.7 billion, less 
than $700 million has actually been 
granted to flood victims, granted to 
disaster victims. 
Mr. Speaker, I know your home State 
of Texas got pounded by Hurricane 
Harvey, some areas experiencing 42 
inches of rain in 36 hours. 
You have recovery and assistance 
programs that are disjointed among 
the Federal agencies. They cause a bu-
reaucracy. They actually revictimize 
these people who have lost everything 
in these disasters. 
This is designed to get recovery dol-
lars where they are needed, to expedite 
recovery, to save money because you 
are saving funds that are being spent 
on long-term shelters; saving funds 
that are being spent, in some cases, ap-
proaching $300,000 to provide a trailer 
for someone to temporarily live in; 
saving money, again, on hotel rooms 
and getting people back in their homes 
faster. 
We still have people from our dis-
aster 6 years ago who have homes that 
have been mucked and gutted, stripped 
down to the studs, without any addi-
tional recovery because they can’t con-
nect the dots. 
So, as the gentlewoman from the Dis-
trict of Columbia said, this is designed 
to, within 30 days of a disaster, esti-
mate the impacts and provide an ini-
tial payment to where States and local 
governments can lead the charge in di-
recting and prioritizing recovery dol-
lars where they need to go. This, im-
portantly, has a 5 percent administra-
tive cap. 
Mr. Speaker, 2 years after the dis-
aster I mentioned in my home State, 
we had more money that was paid to 
the program managers 2 years later 
than we had actually given to the dis-
aster victims. These programs aren’t 
designed to enrich contractors, to en-
rich program managers, to enrich peo-
ple that are running these programs. 
These dollars are designed by Congress 
to get to the victims, to expedite re-
covery, to allow for the community 
and the economy to recover as quickly 
as possible. 
I want to be very clear. My cospon-
sor, the cosponsor who worked very 
closely with us on this legislation, Con-
gresswoman PLASKETT from the Virgin 
Islands, who in 2018 was incredibly af-
fected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, 
hosted us down there to see the devas-
tation. Years later, again, she still has 
her constituents that are adversely im-
pacted, unable to recover, and requir-
ing additional Federal funds. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear: 
This legislation is intended to reduce 
the expenditure of Federal funds. It is 
designed to expedite recovery. It is de-
signed to cap the bureaucracy and en-
sure no more than 5 percent of these 
funds are actually going to program 
management. 
That way, the dollars can get imme-
diately to the disaster victims, so we 
stop seeing years and years of Federal 
Government dollars being shelled out 
for temporary housing and temporary 
recovery efforts. We need long-term re-
covery. We need our economy restored. 
We need our communities restored. 
There are two types of Members who 
are in this House: people who have been 
through disasters, like the gentle-
woman from the Virgin Islands and I, 
and those that will. Those that will are 
going to want to ensure that they have 
supported legislation like this designed 
to reform, to modernize, to apply les-
sons learned from disasters and make 
sure that we are treating these victims

as true priorities, that we have Federal 
programs that reflect the urgency of 
the situation that they are in when 
their homes have been destroyed, when 
they have lost their vehicles, lost their 
clothes, lost their possessions, lost all 
of these family heirlooms, making sure 
that we are able to restore that family 
back in their community and, impor-
tantly, get the economies restored 
again as quickly as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1515 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 5774, the ‘‘Expediting Disaster 
Recovery Act of 2022’’ which promotes swift 
strategic implementation of resources by the 
president following natural disasters. 
After the declaration of a major disaster, the 
Expediting Disaster Recovery Act of 2022 au-
thorizes the President to direct the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to 
provide assistance for unmet needs of those 
impacted by the disaster. 
The President may also provide financial or 
direct assistance to individuals or households 
to construct permanent or semi-permanent 
housing in areas outside the continental 
United States if the President deems it a more 
cost-effective solution. 
According to the National Center for Envi-
ronmental Information, the U.S. spent approxi-
mately $152 Billion just last year from various 
environmental events such as the Deep 
Freeze in Texas and Hurricanes across the 
Gulf Coast. 
One of the most critical and unprecedented 
natural disaster emergencies was the Deep 
Freeze in Texas, resulting in a number of un-
foreseen complications for Texas residents. 
Millions of households lost power during the 
Deep Freeze, disrupting their heating, food 
and water supplies, and communication sys-
tems. 
Based on the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission report for the Deep Freeze, esti-
mated costs for damages in Texas reached a 
staggering $80 Billion, with $35 Billion alone 
due to physical damages, of which insurance 
only covered $20 Billion. 
Texas residents will need to pay for a large 
portion of the damages, putting their own lives 
on hold until they are financially stabilized. 
Meanwhile, families who are unable to meet 
the expenses out of pocket are stuck in bleak 
living conditions. 
Alongside the unprecedented winter storms 
in Texas, were the devastating effects of Hur-
ricane Ida, which ravaged many coastal cities 
and counties. The National Center for Environ-
mental Information estimated that there were 
$75 Billion in damage costs. 
Unfortunately, most home insurance policies 
do not cover flood damages, including dam-
ages caused by Hurricane Ida, This means 
that individuals would have needed to pur-
chase separate policies dedicated for flood 
damages on top of the already rising home in-
surance prices. 
Recent flood disasters, such as those in 
Kentucky, have once again highlighted the 
dangers of inadequate planning and the over-
all expenses incurred by its residents. 
Outdated federal flood zone maps under-
estimate the occurrence of floods within cer-
tain communities. Therefore, insurance com-
panies, which base their policies on federal 
flood zone maps, end up paying for a small 
portion of damages to households. 
For residents of some of the poorest coun-
ties in the U.S., this means they will be forced 
to pay mostly out of pocket for all damage ex-
penses, further hindering their chances of re-
covery from future disasters. 
H.R. 5774 can help families with unmet 
needs, easing financial burdens by distributing 
funds for the purpose of rebuilding homes and 
communities. This can provide these families 
the opportunity to dedicate their finances to-
wards health concerns, exploring education, 
and other basic living expenses. 
Millions of families suffer from natural dis-
aster events without the ability to recover ef-
fectively. With the help of the Expediting Dis-
aster Recovery Act of 2022, families with 
unmet needs will be able to recover more fully 
and more rapidly, allowing them to reinvest 
themselves in their communities and return to 
their normal lifestyles. 
The Expediting Disaster Recovery Act of 
2022 sets forth the requirements for the Presi-
dent to establish swift and effective financial 
and technical assistance to aid in the recovery 
of families who may be unable to cover finan-
cial costs for repair and rebuilding. 
I urge my colleagues to support this very 
helpful legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask

may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1468, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield

pendent real estate leasing authority 
of the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission and direct the Government Ac-
countability Office to update its 2016 
report on independent real estate leas-
ing authority in the Federal Govern-
ment. While a number of Federal agen-
cies have independent leasing author-
ity, the SEC has a history of egregious 
real estate practices. 
In 2005, the SEC disclosed that it had 
unbudgeted costs of approximately $48 
million for the construction of its 
headquarters near Union Station. In

H7756 
September 13, 2022 
2007, after moving into the head-
quarters, the SEC shuffled its employ-
ees to different office space at a cost of 
over $3 million without any cost-ben-
efit analysis or justifiable explanation. 
In 2010, the SEC conducted a deeply 
flawed analysis to justify the need to 
lease 900,000 square feet and to commit 
over $500 million over 10 years, over-
estimating its space needs by over 300 
percent. In addition, the SEC failed to 
provide complete and accurate infor-
mation and prepared a faulty and 
backdated justification and approval 
after it had already signed the lease. 
In August 2016, the General Services 
Administration and the SEC entered 
into an occupancy agreement to au-
thorize the GSA to secure a new 15- 
year lease. In December 2016, the GSA, 
with the approval of the SEC, sub-
mitted a prospectus to Congress for ap-
proximately 1.3 million square feet, 
which Congress approved in 2018. By 
July 2019, the GSA had received final 
bids, resolved all protests, and even se-
lected a final bidder. A month later, 
the SEC canceled the occupancy agree-
ment, citing concerns about the value 
of the purchase option, which the SEC 
refused to document to Congress. The 
SEC effectively vetoed the entire 3- 
year procurement process, despite not 
having the authority or funding to ex-
ercise the purchase option without the 
GSA’s involvement. 
Finally, after much back and forth 
between the two agencies, the GSA en-
tered into a lease for a new SEC head-
quarters in September 2021. The SEC 
says it will continue to have the GSA 
do its leasing in the future, but the 
SEC’s history of egregious leasing con-
duct, having squandered hundreds of 
millions of dollars, makes this bill nec-
essary. 
These public blunders also risk un-
dermining the reputation of the GSA 
and the Federal Government among 
the developers and building owners 
that participate in Federal lease pro-
curements and ultimately driving up 
the costs of all GSA real estate pro-
curement due to the threat of uncer-
tainty. 
It is time for Congress to return the 
SEC’s leasing authority to the GSA, 
the Federal Government’s civilian real 
estate arm. As the SEC has dem-
onstrated over three decades, it is in-
credibly inefficient, wasteful, and re-
dundant to have the SEC involved in 
real estate procurements when the 
GSA exists for that very reason. Like 
other Federal agencies, the SEC would 
continue to have input and involve-
ment in the real estate decision-mak-
ing process, but the GSA will have the 
ultimate authority. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1468, as the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia 
indicated, helps to restore the SEC’s 
leasing authority back to the confines 
of the General Services Administra-
tion. It ensures that we have a uniform 
approach to leasing space in Federal 
agencies. 
I thank the gentlewoman from the 
District of Columbia for her persever-
ance on this bill. I know this has been 
a priority of hers for a very long period 
of time. But I want to give you a little 
bit of background. 
In 2012, the SEC leased approxi-
mately 1.4 million square feet of office 
space for $566 million. I want to say 
that again. The SEC leased 1.4 million 
square feet of office space for $566 mil-
lion, in violation of the law. They ex-
ceeded their authority when they en-
tered into this lease. 
When there was Republican leader-
ship, there was an investigation that 
the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure did over the SEC’s ac-
tions. The SEC Inspector General simi-
larly commissioned an investigation. 
The conclusion of these investiga-
tions found that not only did the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission ex-
ceed their authority in that lease, but 
this was a trend. They had a history of 
mismanagement of their leasing au-
thority. 
Unfortunately, recent actions by the 
SEC during the GSA’s procurement of 
leased space for the SEC indicates that 
they may be returning back to their 
old ways. 
I want to say again, I commend the 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia, ensuring that we have a uni-
form approach, ensuring that taxpayer 
dollars are being managed in a way 
that we can all be proud of, respecting 
the people who have worked hard for 
those dollars, and we don’t need to be 
mismanaging them. 
The bill will ensure that the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission, like 
other Federal agencies, uses the GSA, 
the General Services Administration, 
for its space needs and provide more 
safeguards for taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
legislation, and reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
In closing, H.R. 1468 will better pro-
tect taxpayer money by ensuring the 
SEC works with the General Services 
Administration on leasing to improve 
oversight, reduce costs, and minimize 
Antideficiency Act violations in the fu-
ture. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

bility with the cost share for fire man-

SHARE. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 420 of the Robert 
T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
Assistance Act is amended— 
(1) by redesignating subsection (e) as sub-
section (f); and 
(2) by inserting after subsection (d) the fol-
lowing:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7757 
September 13, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1066, the Wildfire Recovery Act, a bill 
introduced by Mr. NEGUSE from Colo-
rado. This legislation will remove some 
of the financial burdens communities 
face after suppressing a wildfire. 
Wildfires are causing an unprece-
dented amount of damage to the nat-
ural and built environment. This bill 
will require the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to cover at least 
75 percent of the costs to suppress 
wildfires that qualify for a Fire Man-
agement Assistance Grant. Local offi-
cials have said that this fix would 
allow them to speed up the recovery 
process and invest more money in miti-
gation efforts. 
Rural communities that typically re-
ceive this type of grant assistance will 
benefit most from this legislation. Pro-
viding more Federal assistance in the 
wake of the worst fires will assist 
stretched local budgets. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Wildfire Recovery 
Act ensures that communities affected 
by wildfire disasters are treated simi-
larly as communities affected by other 
disasters. 
The bill provides parity by making a 
Federal cost share amount adjustable 
for 
Fire 
Management 
Assistance

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 2293. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
2293, the Civilian Reservist Emergency 
Workforce Act of 2021, which extends 
Uniformed Services Employment and 
Reemployment Rights Act protections 
to the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency’s reservist workforce. 
Reservists assist disaster survivors 
and first responders on an on-call basis. 
They are prepared to deploy when dis-
aster strikes and make up the majority 
of FEMA’s workforce. While reservists 
are critical to Federal disaster re-
sponse, these essential personnel are 
only paid by FEMA during deploy-
ments and have no protections that 
prevent them from losing their full- 
time jobs when called to a disaster. 
FEMA’s 
workforce

been 
stretched to its limits by increasingly

frequent and intense disasters, climate 
change, and the coronavirus pandemic. 
A larger reservist workforce is required 
to meet the current challenge, but 
FEMA has reported that it is difficult 
to retain reservists and recruit a di-
verse workforce without being able to 
offer them basic protections. FEMA 
Administrator Deanna Criswell has 
stated that the ability to recruit and 
maintain a skilled reservist workforce 
is necessary if the agency is to fulfill 
its mission of helping people before, 
during, and after disasters. 
This bill will help FEMA continue to 
fulfill that mission and ensure that 
these brave women and men do not 
have to worry that they could lose 
their livelihoods when they are called 
by their country to serve. 
It is time we give reservists the re-
spect they deserve and provide them 
protections. I would like to express my 
gratitude to reservists who have an-
swered the call and to those who will 
do so in the future. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 2293, the CREW Act, 
extends protections under the Uni-
formed Services Employment and Re-
employment Rights Act, commonly re-
ferred to as USERRA, to FEMA reserv-
ists. 
FEMA reservists are a critical com-
ponent to supporting disaster survivors 
and our first responders. 
The CREW Act would provide FEMA 
further tools to retain and recruit a 
workforce. By having a strong work-
force, FEMA is then able to respond 
quickly and effectively to disasters, 
thereby fulfilling its mission to dis-
aster victims. 
I urge support of this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise 
in support of S. 2293, the Civilian Re-
servist 
Emergency 
Workforce, 
or 
CREW, 
Act, 
appropriately 
named, 
which is the Senate companion to leg-
islation I introduced to protect FEMA 
reservists. It would protect them from 
losing 
their 
full-time 
employment 
when they are called up to assist our 
communities during and after disas-
ters. 
FEMA reservists have in the past and 
continue to step up time and time 
again when communities need help in 
the wake of severe storms, wildfires, 
and other climate events. We also saw 
them on the front lines during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Unlike military reservists, however, 
FEMA’s workforce is not afforded em-
ployment protections during deploy-
ment. When these men and women are 
answering 
the 
call 
of 
duty, 
they 
shouldn’t have to worry about losing 
their means of income back home 
where they can take care of their own 
families. 
I am proud to lead the House com-
panion to this bill along with my col-
league, the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. KATKO). I thank him for his lead-
ership, and I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to close. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 2293 will help support 
FEMA’s intermittent workforce and 
enable the agency to better meet its 
mission to respond to disasters. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation and yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of S. 2293, the ‘‘Civilian Reservist 
Emergency Workforce Act of 2021’’ or ‘‘CREW 
Act.’’ 
This bill would amend the Robert T. Stafford 
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
to provide certain employment rights to Fed-
eral Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
reservists. 
FEMA reservists are temporary, on-call, and 
intermittent employees who are crucial to the 
agency’s mission to swiftly respond to disas-
ters—but, they currently do not have employ-
ment protections. 
The bill makes employment protections 
under the Uniformed Services and Reemploy-
ment Rights Act (USRRA) applicable to FEMA 
reservists who deploy to major disaster and 
emergency sites. 
It allows reservists to claim such rights 
under USERRA even if they do not provide 
notice of their absence from work due to de-
ployment. 
The bill ensures that reservists will be able 
to return to their full-time jobs once their dis-
aster response mission is complete. 
These FEMA workers were essential during 
the Texas Freeze of 2021, the historic natural 
disaster Hurricane Harvey, and the initial out-
break of the Coronavirus pandemic. 
We need to protect intermittent FEMA em-
ployees’ rights to return to their full-time jobs 
after performing life-changing and life-saving 
work in our communities. 
Currently, FEMA faces a large shortfall of 
reservists because it is difficult to recruit and 
retain Americans who can balance reservist 
duties and full-time employment. 
With this bill’s protections for employees, 
FEMA’s ability to recruit and retain employees 
would be enhanced. With more FEMA employ-
ees, we can combat disasters and crises 
quicker. 
Our Nation must never again be so ill-pre-
pared to weather a disaster like Hurricane 
Harvey or a crisis like COVID–l9.

4205) to require the Administrator of 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency to establish a working group

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 4205. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
4205, the Planning for Animal Wellness 
Act. The Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee marked up the 
companion bill, H.R. 7789, introduced 
by Representative TITUS earlier this 
summer. 
This bill requires the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency to establish 
a working group of experts to review 
and, if necessary, update its guidance 
for addressing the needs of animals and 
pets before, during, and after disasters. 
Animals are among the most vulner-
able when disaster strikes. Like people, 
they may be displaced or require evac-
uation and sheltering. However, dis-
aster shelters are often unable or un-
willing to accommodate animals. Pets 
are beloved members of the family, and 
owners should not have to choose be-
tween abandoning their animals and 
getting to safety. When individuals are 
forced to make this terrible decision, 
they often refuse to evacuate before a 
natural disaster. 
This bill will remove barriers to en-
sure animal welfare is properly consid-
ered in emergency planning so that all 
members of the family—human and 
pet—are safe during disasters. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
S. 4205, the Planning for Animal 
Wellness, or PAW Act, establishes a 
FEMA working group to determine 
Federal guidance on animal care dur-
ing emergencies and natural disasters. 
We have seen citizens impacted by 
disasters reluctant to evacuate if they 
can’t bring their pets with them. This 
can greatly affect the ability of emer-
gency managers and local first re-
sponders to keep individuals safe. 
Whether it is service animals, house-
hold pets, or farm animals, we have 
made improvements to address this 
issue; however, problems still persist. 
Given this fact, the bill establishes a 
working group to review FEMA’s poli-
cies, determine best practices, and 
make recommendations to help better 
prepare and respond to disasters. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation and reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, as a mem-
ber of the Congressional Animal Pro-
tection Caucus, I rise in support of S. 
4205, the Planning for Animal Wellness, 
or PAW Act. This is the Senate com-
panion to legislation I introduced 
along with Chairman DEFAZIO to help 
protect our beloved pets during disas-
ters. 
When preparing for and responding to 
disasters, animal welfare often is not 
taken into consideration. Sadly, some 
owners make the risky decision of re-
fusing to evacuate in order to stay 
with their pets. We have seen heart-
breaking pictures of people on their 
roofs during floods clinging to their 
animals, along with their children and 
a few household possessions. 
The PAW Act establishes a FEMA ad-
visory group to align agency guidance 
with current best practices in animal 
welfare for emergency preparedness. 
This will ensure first responders and 
Federal disaster response workers can 
help pet owners plan to keep every 
member of their family, even the furry 
and feathered ones, safe during a dis-
aster. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan legislation. I 
also thank Senators PETERS and JOHN-
SON for their leadership on this in the 
other Chamber. I urge your vote in sup-
port. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to close. 
Mr. Speaker, the PAW Act will help 
identify persistent problem areas and 
best practices when it comes to dealing 
with pets and animals in disasters and 
ultimately improve our response to dis-
asters to save more lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation and yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I urge my colleagues as well to 
support the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

question is on the motion offered by

effective and energy efficient lighting sys-
tems. 
‘‘(2) PROCUREMENT AND USE.—In making a 
determination under this section concerning 
the practicability of procuring and installing 
the most life-cycle cost effective and energy 
efficient lighting system, the Administrator

‘‘3313. Procurement of life-cycle cost effec-
tive and energy efficient light-
ing systems.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
CRAWFORD) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 442. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
442, the BRIGHT Act. The Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee 
marked up the companion bill, H.R. 
7636, 
introduced 
by 
Representative 
TITUS, earlier this summer. 
This legislation encourages the Gen-
eral Services Administration to use the 
most up-to-date and efficient lighting 
for all routine maintenance, alter-
ations, and construction and gives GSA 
the flexibility to choose the most effi-
cient option for each installation. 
Additionally, this bill asks that GSA 
provide guidance to Federal agencies 
and State, local, and Tribal entities on 
how cost-effective and energy-efficient 
lighting systems can help achieve 
broader efficiency goals. 
b 1545 
While the Energy Independence and 
Security Act of 2007 did include guide-
lines for energy-efficient light bulb uti-
lization, 
GSA 
managers 
are 
not 
incentivized to choose the most energy 
and cost-efficient options in procure-
ments. 
By directing GSA to acquire and use 
the 
most 
cost-and 
energy-efficient 
lighting systems practicable over the 
life cycles of the systems, this legisla-
tion aims to maximize resource con-
servation and use of taxpayer dollars in 
all GSA lighting procurements. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 442, the BRIGHT Act, 
ensures the General Services Adminis-
tration, GSA, updates building lighting 
systems with the most life cycle cost- 
effective and energy-efficient options, 
so long as the change does not interfere 
with productivity and is a cost-effec-
tive retrofit. 
It also requires GSA to issue guid-
ance to other Federal agencies on de-
ploying these lighting systems and 
make the information available to 
State, local, and Tribal government en-
tities. 
Updating outdated lighting systems 
with the most cost-effective and en-
ergy-efficient options will lessen the 
Federal Government’s energy bill, sav-
ing taxpayers money. Efficient lighting 
systems tend to be lower-cost solutions 
with higher return on investment. This 
is commonsense legislation that en-
sures that lighting updates are made 
only if a retrofit is cost-effective. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, based on the bipartisan 
backing in the House and the Senate, I 
think it is appropriate to say we can 
call this bill a bright idea. It will make 
public buildings more energy efficient 
and ensure that taxpayer dollars are 
being spent as judiciously as possible. 
Simply put, the BRIGHT Act directs 
the GSA to procure the most life cycle 
cost-effective 
and 
energy-efficient 
lighting in public buildings to the ex-
tent practicable. 
Recognizing that each installation is 
unique, and that technology is ever 
changing, this bill doesn’t endorse, nor 
does it prohibit any specific tech-
nology, but rather, guides the GSA to 
purchase and pursue the most efficient 
option which will save millions when 
fully implemented. 
For example, simply replacing com-
pact fluorescent downlight lamps and 
linear fluorescent lamps with LEDs 
could save taxpayers up to $15.6 million 
every year. 
I am proud to sponsor the House 
companion to this House Resolution 
that is led by Senators PETERS and 
JOHNSON. It promotes taxpayer savings 
at all levels of government and is good 
for the planet. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, the BRIGHT 
Act will implement only cost-effective 
retrofits 
that 
will 
save 
taxpayers 
money and lower the Federal Govern-
ment’s energy bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
442. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

subchapters II and III, respectively; and 
(2) by inserting before subchapter II, as so 
redesignated, 
the 
following 
new 
sub-
chapter:’’. 
‘‘SUBCHAPTER I—EMERGENCY 
SITUATIONS 
‘‘§ 3601. Definition of emergency situation 
‘‘In this chapter, the term ‘emergency situ-
ation’ means a situation that— 
‘‘(1) the President declares is an emer-
gency; and 
‘‘(2) the Secretary determines is an emer-
gency for purposes of the laws administered 
by the Secretary. 
‘‘§ 3602. Continuation of educational assist-
ance benefits during emergency situations 
‘‘(a) AUTHORITY.—If the Secretary deter-
mines under subsection (c) that an individual 
is negatively affected by an emergency situ-
ation, the Secretary may provide edu-
cational assistance to that individual under 
the laws administered by the Secretary as if 
such negative effects did not occur. The au-
thority under this section is in addition to 
the other authorities of the Secretary to pro-
vide benefits in emergency situations, but in 
no case may the Secretary provide more 
than a total of four weeks of additional edu-
cational assistance by reason of any other 
such authority and this section. 
‘‘(b) HOUSING
AND
ALLOWANCES.—In pro-
viding educational assistance to an indi-
vidual pursuant to subsection (a), the Sec-
retary may— 
‘‘(1) continue to pay a monthly housing sti-
pend under chapter 33 of this title, during a 
month the individual would have been en-
rolled in a program of education or training 
but for the emergency situation at the same 
rate such stipend would have been payable if 
the individual had not been negatively af-
fected by the emergency situation, except 
that the total number of weeks for which sti-
pends may continue to be so payable may 
not exceed four weeks; and 
‘‘(2) continue to pay payments or subsist-
ence allowances under chapters 30, 31, 32, 33, 
and 35 of this title and chapter 1606 of title 
10 during a month for a period of time that 
the individual would have been enrolled in a 
program of education or training but for the 
emergency situation, except that the total 
number of weeks for which payments or al-
lowances may continue to be so payable may 
not exceed four weeks. 
‘‘(c) 
DETERMINATION
OF
NEGATIVE
EF-
FECTS.—The Secretary shall determine that 
an individual was negatively affected by an 
emergency situation if— 
‘‘(1) the individual is enrolled in a covered 
program of education of an educational in-
stitution or enrolled in training at a training 
establishment and is pursuing such program 
or training using educational assistance 
under the laws administered by the Sec-
retary; 
‘‘(2) the educational institution or training 
establishment certifies to the Secretary that 
such program or training is truncated, de-
layed, relocated, canceled, partially can-
celed, converted from being on-site to being 
offered by distance learning, or otherwise 
modified or made unavailable by reason of 
the emergency situation; and 
‘‘(3) the Secretary determines that the 
modification to such program or training 
specified under paragraph (2) would reduce 
the amount of educational assistance (in-
cluding with respect to monthly housing sti-
pends, payments, or subsistence allowances) 
that would be payable to the individual but 
for the emergency situation. 
‘‘(d) EFFECT
ON ENTITLEMENT PERIOD.—If 
the Secretary determines that an individual 
who received assistance under this section 
did not make progress toward the comple-
tion of the program of education in which 
the individual is enrolled during the period 
for which the individual received such assist-
ance, any assistance provided pursuant to 
this section shall not be counted for purposes 
of determining the total amount of an indi-
vidual’s entitlement to educational assist-
ance, housing stipends, or payments or sub-
sistence allowances under chapters 30, 31, 32, 
and 35 of this title and chapter 1606 of title 
10. 
‘‘§ 3603. Continuation of educational assist-
ance benefits for certain programs of edu-
cation converted to distance learning by 
reason of emergency situations 
‘‘In the case of a program of education ap-
proved by a State approving agency, or the 
Secretary when acting in the role of a State 
approving agency, that is converted from 
being offered on-site at an educational insti-
tution or training establishment to being of-
fered by distance learning by reason of an 
emergency or health-related situation, as de-
termined by the Secretary, the Secretary 
may continue to provide educational assist-
ance under the laws administered by the Sec-
retary without regard to such conversion, in-
cluding with respect to paying any— 
‘‘(1) monthly housing stipends under chap-
ter 33 of this title; or 
‘‘(2) payments or subsistence allowances 
under chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 of this title 
and chapter 1606 of title 10.

tution and modification of courses by rea-
son of emergency situation

ment of educational assistance described in 
subsection (b) shall not—

educational assistance of the individual con-
cerned; or 
‘‘(2) be counted against the aggregate pe-
riod for which section 3695 of this title limits 
the receipt of educational assistance by such 
individual.

Subject to subsection (d), the payment of 
educational assistance described in this sub-
section is the payment of such assistance to 
an individual for pursuit of a course or pro-
gram of education at an educational institu-
tion under chapter 30, 31, 32, 33, or 35 of this 
title or chapter 1606 of title 10, if the Sec-
retary determines that the individual—

tion, or the full or partial cancellation of a 
course or program of education, by reason of

gram under this chapter because the course 
was modified by reason of such emergency; 
and 
‘‘(2) did not receive credit or lost training 
time, toward completion of the program of 
education being so pursued. 
‘‘(c) HOUSING ASSISTANCE.—In this section, 
educational assistance includes, as applica-
ble—

which, by reason of this section, educational 
assistance is not charged against entitle-
ment or counted toward the applicable ag-
gregate period under section 3695 of this title

H7766 
September 13, 2022 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to insert extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 7939, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7939, as amended. This comprehensive 
package from Economic Opportunity 
Subcommittee 
Chairman 
LEVIN
in-
cludes several improvements for stu-
dent veterans. 
The 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
exposed 
many flaws in student veteran benefits. 
We never could have anticipated the 
need to shift nearly all students to re-
mote learning, but without action, VA 
would have been forced to cut housing 
benefits for hundreds of thousands of 
student veterans nationwide because 
the students technically were no longer 
attending classes in person. 
However, this committee acted swift-
ly during 2020, passing several crucial 
acts, including my Student Veteran 
Coronavirus Response Act of 2020, 
which was swiftly signed into law. 
These actions meant student vet-
erans were protected from losing their 
benefits—but only for a limited time. 
While I am relieved we never left stu-
dent veterans without their benefits, 
we came close far too many times. 
H.R. 7939, as amended, does away 
with these artificial benefit cliffs for 
student veterans and makes permanent 
many of the veteran protections passed 
as short-term measures during 2020 and 
2021. 
That means the next time there is an 
emergency—be it a flood, tornado, an-
other pandemic, or another event that 
forces students to take their classes 
online for a short period of time—VA 
will be able to fully pay out benefits to 
student veterans who are forced to at-
tend classes remotely. 
I thank Chairman LEVIN of the Sub-
committee on Economic Opportunity 
for introducing H.R. 7939, as amended, 
to safeguard these benefits. In addi-
tion, included in this legislation is H.R. 
5752, also from Chairman LEVIN. This 
provision will allow servicemembers to 
get out of contracts they may be 
wrongly bound to because of their or-
ders. 
Families 
suffered 
fines, 
excessive 
bills, and damage to their credit scores 
due to circumstances completely out-
side of their control. Also, from Chair-
man LEVIN, H.R. 7939, as amended, in-
cludes the text from H.R. 7369, the 
VENTURE Act, which allows more dis-
abled veterans to use the self-employ-
ment track for the Veteran Readiness 
and Employment Program. 
Previously, this option was only 
available to a very small cohort of vet-
erans. 
The 
VENTURE 
Act 
keeps 
prioritization of several disabled vet-
erans but also allows additional vet-
erans to pursue this option if they 
wish. 
Finally, this package includes count-
less additional improvements for stu-
dent veterans such as improving which 
programs are available for GI bill ap-
proval and removing unnecessary red 
tape for schools so school certifying of-
ficials can spend more time with stu-
dents and less time on paperwork. 
This legislation is supported by Dis-
abled American Veterans, Veterans 
Education Success, Student Veterans 
of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, 
and VA. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7939, as amended, the Student Veteran 
Emergency Relief Act of 2022. 
This is a bipartisan bill led by Chair-
man 
LEVIN
and 
Ranking 
Member 
MOORE of the Subcommittee on Eco-
nomic Opportunity. The base text 
would provide emergency protection 
for maintaining current GI bill pay-
ments for student veterans if a pan-
demic like COVID–19 hits our country 
again. 
I am supportive of the entire pack-
age, but I am especially pleased that 
five Republican proposals have been in-
cluded. This bill includes Congressman 
JOYCE’s language that would extend 
full post-9/11 GI bill benefits to the 
servicemembers who have been dis-
charged under DOD’s sole survivor 
rules. 
A sole survivor discharge is designed 
to protect the members of a family if 
they have already lost family members 
to military service. 
This issue directly impacts Congress-
man 
JOYCE’s 
constituents, 
the 
Weninger family, whose son, Sergeant 
Weninger, tragically passed away in 
2020. I am happy to honor Sergeant 
Weninger for his service to the United 
States and provide this benefit to his 
brother. 
I thank his family, Congressman 
JOYCE, and the Tragedy Assistance 
Program for Survivors for bringing this 
important issue to our attention. 
Now, this package also includes text 
from Congressman MOORE’s bill that 
would improve the way that schools 
are approved for the GI bill to help pre-
vent waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Recently, there has been a rise in 
schools abusing this benefit. GI bill 
fraud both takes away a veteran’s ben-
efit and wastes taxpayer dollars. This 
bill would make it much harder for a 
bad school to be approved for GI bill 
benefits and well before they could 
harm veterans. 
I thank the Student Veterans of 
America, the VFW, and Veterans Edu-
cation Success for assisting us in writ-
ing this provision. 
I also thank the Office of Inspector 
General and Inspector General Missal 
for their hard work in protecting vet-
erans by helping us draft this text. 
H.R. 7939, as amended, also includes a 
GOP proposal that would help improve 
access to study-abroad programs while 
using the GI bill. 
I thank the Student Veterans of 
America and other higher education 
groups for bringing this issue to our at-
tention. 
Another proposal in this bill would 
amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief 
Act to make it easier for military 
spouses to transfer licenses across the 
States. 
This bipartisan proposal would allow 
spouses to transfer their State-based 
medical and professional license when 
they move due to their spouse’s mili-
tary orders. This is an important 
change that would help reduce unem-
ployment among military spouses. I 
thank Congressman MIKE GARCIA for 
originally proposing this legislation, 
and I am pleased to see it in the list of 
bills today. 
The bill also includes the text for 
H.R. 4702, originally introduced by Con-
gressman CAWTHORN, that would help 
clarify the State that a military spouse 
can file taxes in when their family is 
deployed to another State. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chair and the ranking member for their 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, there are a number of 
bills here that pertain to the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs’ jurisdic-
tion. I support a number of those 
bills—maybe not a couple of them. I 
certainly appreciate that we are having 
them down here. 
As many people know, the House 
Freedom Caucus and a number of my 
other colleagues have simply been rais-
ing the issue that we should debate, 
amend on different issues. We should 
have a different conversation about 
how the floor operates so we continue 
to require roll call votes on a number 
of bills that might otherwise pass by 
voice. But in doing so, it is not a state-
ment necessarily always on the con-
tent of the legislation in question. We 
will be making some roll call votes 
here this afternoon, but I just wanted 
to make sure, as a member of the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, I make 
clear my support for a number of these 
measures, which will obviously be clear 
in the roll call vote later. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time.

Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of 
my colleagues to support the bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
ask all of my colleagues to join me in 
passing H.R. 7939, as amended, the Stu-
dent Veteran Emergency Relief Act of 
2022, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

VETERANS’ COMPENSATION COST- 
OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to

(H.R. 7846) to increase, effective as of 
December 1, 2022, the rates of com-
pensation for veterans with service- 
connected disabilities and the rates of

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
7846. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7846, the Veterans’ Compensation Cost- 
of-Living Adjustment Act of 2022. 
This bill would require the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs to increase 
the amounts payable for wartime dis-
ability 
compensation, 
compensation 
for dependents, the clothing allowance 
for certain disabled veterans, and de-
pendency and indemnity compensation 
for surviving spouses and children. 
Specifically, VA would be required to 
increase benefit amounts by the same 
percentage as the cost-of-living in-
crease in benefits for Social Security 
recipients. 
To me, the cost-of-living adjustment 
to veterans’ compensation is more than 
just a rate adjustment tied to infla-
tion. It is a quality-of-life guarantee 
for veterans and their families. 
This annual COLA is not only a 
source of personal comfort for former 
servicemembers as they age; it assures 
that their survivors will not see a de-
cline in earned benefits should the 
economy fluctuate and costs rise once 
their beloved veteran is no longer with 
us. I know this because veterans and 
their family members from all over the 
country relay these same exact senti-
ments to me. 
The COLA is the continued recogni-
tion by a grateful nation of the service 
and sacrifice of those who have stepped 
up to serve. This gesture of apprecia-
tion is one of the most rewarding re-
sponsibilities of the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. As chairman, I am hon-
ored to be leading this effort to express 
our thanks. 
I would like to recognize the Sub-
committee on Disability Assistance 
and Memorial Affairs for, once again, 
originating this legislation for floor 
consideration today, and I thank Chair 
LURIA and Ranking Member NEHLS for 
their sponsorship and steadfast assist-
ance to our vets. 
I am pleased we are voting on this 
bill early to alleviate any doubt that 
this adjustment will be in place come 
December. 
Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly sup-
port H.R. 7846, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7846, the Veterans’ Compensation Cost- 
of-Living Adjustment Act of 2022. I 
thank Subcommittee on Disability As-
sistance and Memorial Affairs Chair 
LURIA and Ranking Member NEHLS for 
introducing this bill. 
It would increase the rate of dis-
ability compensation and DIC com-
pensation for survivors to keep up with 
the steep rise in the cost of living. This 
legislation is absolutely vital in the 
face of rampant inflation, a potential 
recession, and a high cost of living 
under the Biden administration. 
We must ensure that our veterans are 
able to pay their bills and put food on 
the table for their families. If we do 
not act, our veterans and their families 
will bear the burden of the careless fi-
nancial actions of this administration. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to offer my 
support today, and I hope my col-
leagues will do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA). My good friend is 
the chair of the Disability Assistance 
and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 7846, the Vet-
erans’ 
Compensation 
Cost-of-Living 
Adjustment Act of 2022. 
With inflation and rising costs im-
pacting Americans across the country, 
we must continue to ensure that the 
needs of our disabled veterans and 
their families are being met. 
For the past 4 years, I have been 
proud to introduce and pass bipartisan 
cost-of-living adjustments to increase 
compensation and benefits for our dis-
abled veterans. As chair of the Dis-
ability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee and author of this 
bipartisan 
legislation, 
I 
am, 
once 
again, honored to present this year’s 
annual veterans’ cost-of-living adjust-
ment legislation to the floor. 
The Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of- 
Living Adjustment Act of 2022 would, 
once again, recognize that VA-related 
compensation requires adjustment in 
the same way that Social Security ben-
efits are updated to meet the cost-of- 
living realities. This includes disability 
compensation, clothing allowance, and 
dependency and indemnity compensa-
tion payments. 
Our veterans service organizations 
understand the realities that many of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7768 
September 13, 2022 
our veterans and military families face 
to make ends meet and the importance 
of this cost-of-living adjustment. As 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, 
puts it: ‘‘This would provide a guar-
antee to veterans and survivors that 
their payments will always be aligned 
to counteract inflation.’’ 
In our current economic climate, vet-
erans in my district and across the 
country have many of the same eco-
nomic concerns as every one of us. Vet-
erans are not immune from concerns 
about putting food on the table and 
their ability to adequately provide for 
a comfortable and sustainable life for 
themselves and their families. 
As a veteran myself, I understand 
firsthand the concerns faced by our Ac-
tive Duty servicemembers and our vet-
erans as they balance professional re-
sponsibilities with the necessities of 
home life. Every bit helps, and this is 
especially true for those who have lost 
a loved one in the course of their serv-
ice or as a result of a service-connected 
injury or illness. 
Dependency 
and 
indemnity 
com-
pensation provided at a sustainable 
rate ensures economic fluctuations are 
not an additional burden for a survivor 
already managing difficult days with-
out their veteran by their side. 
With the high costs of disability care, 
childcare, and other costs, it is vital 
that we continue to provide benefits 
that meet the financial demands faced 
by veterans and their families on a 
day-to-day basis. 
This cost-of-living increase provided 
by my legislation would bolster bene-
ficiaries against today’s price fluctua-
tions and provides relief to our disabled 
veterans and many military families. 
The COLA Act of 2022 is recognition 
of the need to ensure that those receiv-
ing VA compensation are always sup-
ported. This is responsible, common-
sense, bipartisan legislation and proof 
of the good that can come from both 
parties working together. Our veterans 
and their families deserve no less. 
I thank Ranking Member NEHLS for 
being a cosponsor of this year’s legisla-
tion and also full committee Ranking 
Member BOST, who worked with me for 
2 years on this legislation and in pre-
vious years, as well. I thank Chairman 
TAKANO for his reliable support and 
leadership for our veterans, their fami-
lies, and adequate disability compensa-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage full support 
of H.R. 7846. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
and add my voice to support H.R. 7846. 
I thank Ranking Member BOST, Chair-
man TAKANO, and especially Ranking 
Member NEHLS on this subcommittee 
for his great work on it. 
I would also like to add my voice in 
support of H.R. 7939. I am honored to 
speak today in support of our military 
servicemembers and their families. 
America’s warriors are always on the 
move, and their spouses often change 
duty stations every 2 to 3 years in 
order to keep their families together 
and remain close in supporting their 
servicemembers. 
Requiring the spouses of servicemem-
bers to operate under entirely arbi-
trary tax standards prioritizes bu-
reaucracy over bravery and undermines 
the support we provide our servicemen 
and -women. That is why I am deeply 
grateful for the support of many of my 
colleagues who joined me in intro-
ducing the important language of the 
Military Spouse Tax Act into H.R. 7939, 
the Student Veteran Emergency Relief 
Act, ensuring that military spouses 
will be able to keep their home domi-
cile for State income tax purposes if 
they so choose. 
This policy change provides much- 
needed financial stability to the fami-
lies of those risking their lives in de-
fense of our lives and liberties. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 7846, the Veterans’ Compensation 
Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2022, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
PAYNE). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 7846. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

IMPROVING ACCESS TO THE VA 
HOME LOAN BENEFIT ACT OF 2022 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7735) to direct the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to update the ap-
praisal requirements for certain loans 
guaranteed by the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, and for other purposes,

resentatives of the United States of America in

purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7769 
September 13, 2022 
to the VA Home Loan Benefit Act of 
2022. It directs VA to make needed im-
provements to the appraisal portion of 
the program, where some veterans have 
experienced delays. 
The veteran home loan benefit is one 
of the most important transition bene-
fits afforded to servicemembers and 
veterans. Over the last few years, dur-
ing an unprecedented housing market, 
we have seen how even slight delays in 
the program can put servicemembers, 
veterans, and their families behind 
conventional home loan users. 
The legislation from Ranking Mem-
ber BOST directs VA to look internally 
at where these delays might be and 
make needed changes to make veteran 
home buyers as competitive as possible 
in a challenging buying market. 
During our committee’s May mark-
up, I was pleased the ranking member 
supported my amendment to his legis-
lation, which would ensure that the 
changes VA is directed to make to the 
program only improve the product for 
veteran home buyers without weak-
ening home-buyer protections such as 
inspections and appraisals. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7735, as amended, the Improving 
Access to the VA Home Loan Benefit 
Act of 2022. 
Every veteran deserves the chance to 
own a home and pursue the American 
Dream. We know that with increased 
inflation and economic uncertainty 
brought on by the failed economic poli-
cies of the Biden administration, this 
dream 
is 
harder 
for 
veterans 
to 
achieve. 
With interest rates on the rise, we 
should do whatever we can to make the 
VA home loan benefit the best option 
for veteran home buyers and sellers 
alike. 
We have heard that the time it takes 
to complete a VA appraisal is a barrier 
to veterans who want to use the VA 
home loan program. 
b 1615 
My bill would address that issue by 
requiring VA to update the regulations 
on how and when the appraisals must 
be completed. 
While not eliminating traditional ap-
praisals, my bill would make the proc-
ess for veterans to purchase a home 
more efficient by shortening the ap-
praisal timeline to match industry 
standards. 
It would also require VA to consider 
when changes to the appraisal process 
would save a veteran money during the 
closing process. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
mortgage bankers and the other stake-
holders for their work in crafting this 
bill to help make the VA loan more 
competitive. 
With their support, we have been able 
to create a solution that I hope will 
help thousands of veterans. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
TAKANO for his assistance in moving 
this bill forward, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 7735, as amended, the Improving 
Access to the VA Home Loan Benefit 
Act of 2022, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7735, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

WOUNDED WARRIOR ACCESS ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5916) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to allow for the electronic 
request of certain records, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5916,

There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5916, 
as 
amended. 
Representative 
AGUILAR’s Wounded Warrior Access Act 
would require VA to establish and 
maintain 
a 
secure, 
internet-based 
website to enable a claimant or their 
representative to make records re-
quests related to VA claims and bene-
fits. 
Additionally, this bill would add a 
provision requiring VA to warn claim-
ants about benefit scammers, provide a 
way to report potentially fraudulent 
activity, and provide a tool for claim-
ants to search for accredited represen-
tation. 
Currently, to make records requests 
related to VA claims and benefits, vet-
erans or designated representatives 
must submit a Freedom of Information 
Act, otherwise known as a FOIA, or a 
Privacy Act Request. 
Submitting this form followed by 
waiting for it to upload into the indi-
vidual’s electronic claims file, and then 
waiting action on the request can be 
very time-consuming and can nega-
tively impact a claimant’s ability to 
understand what records VA is evalu-
ating and what information could bet-
ter assist in a claim’s positive adju-
dication. 
Establishing and maintaining a se-
cure, internet-based website to enable 
a claimant or their representative to 
make requests related to VA claims 
and benefits would modernize this es-
sential process and assist in more time-
ly, positive claim outcomes. 
This bill would also add another tool 
in the toolbox for veterans when navi-
gating the complexities of the claims 
process and will help veterans gain a 
little more autonomy over their claim. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that my 
colleagues will join me in supporting 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5916, as amended, the Wounded Warrior 
Access Act. 
H.R. 5916, as amended, would require 
VA to establish a secure, public-facing 
website that veterans can use to re-
quest a copy of their VA records. This 
would make VA more accessible to vet-
erans by modernizing its systems. Spe-
cifically, the bill would make it easier 
for veterans to review their records be-
fore they file a claim or appeal. 
Over the years, I have heard of in-
creasing concerns from veterans about 
organizations that attempt to swindle 
veterans out of their VA benefits. This 
is unacceptable, and it is about time 
that we do something about it. 
This proposal also would require VA 
to warn veterans about greedy claims 
practices when they log into the VA’s 
website. I hope these warnings will pre-
vent veterans from being taken advan-
tage of by these bad actors. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, I am prepared to

PROVEMENT 
OF 
TREATMENT 
OF 
UNDISBURSED 
LIFE 
INSURANCE 
BENEFITS. 
(a) IMPROVEMENT OF PROCESSES.—The Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs shall improve the 
processes and procedures of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs with respect to identi-
fying, locating, and paying hard-to-find 
beneficiaries of life insurance policies issued 
under chapter 19 of title 38, United States 
Code, including by— 
(1) improving the search tools available on 
the website of the Department; 
(2) conducting outreach to veterans, vet-
erans service organizations, and the general 
public with respect to such search tools; 
(3) improving the processes for searching 
for information relating to potential recipi-
ents through internal Department sources

agencies, State government agencies, and 
non-government entities; and 
(4) ensuring the Department has sufficient 
dedicated staff whose primary responsibil-
ities are identifying, locating, and paying 
hard-to-find beneficiaries, with the goal of 
disbursing by not later than two years after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, all 
funds that, as of the date of the enactment of 
this Act, are owed to a beneficiary of a life 
insurance policy issued under chapter 19 of 
title 38, United States Code. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs should work with interagency partners

and other materials that may be required to 
identify, locate, and disburse undisbursed 
life insurance benefits to hard-to-find bene-
ficiaries. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary shall submit to the Committees on 
Veterans’ Affairs of the Senate and House of 
Representatives a report on the progress of 
the Secretary in carrying out this section. 
(d) UNDISBURSED LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS 
DEFINED.—The term ‘‘undisbursed life insur-
ance benefits’’— 
(1) means any amount of money that is 
owed to a beneficiary of a life insurance pol-
icy issued under chapter 19 of title 38, United 
States Code, and that has not been disbursed 
for a period of two years or longer; and 
(2) does not include any amount of money 
that— 
(A) has not been disbursed due to a con-
tested claim; or 
(B) is in dispute by two or more parties 
over who is the entitled beneficiary. 
SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 8260, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8260, as amended, 
the bipartisan Faster Payments to Vet-
erans’ Survivors Act, will result in im-
portant help for the surviving family 
members of recently deceased veterans. 
Families often face financial hardship 
when a veteran life insurance policy-
holder dies, making timely payment of 
these VA benefits is therefore essen-
tial. 
The VA does an admirable job of 
quickly paying the vast majority of 
beneficiaries upon the death of a loved 
one. Yet, in other cases, for a variety 
of reasons, VA is unable to determine 
the identity or location of a surviving 
spouse, child, or family member. At the 
end of the fiscal year 2020, the Depart-
ment owed more than $150 million in 
undisbursed life insurance proceeds to 
nearly 15,000 survivors. Approximately 
10 percent of this money had been owed 
for more than 5 years. 
This legislation, introduced by Rep-
resentative CHRIS PAPPAS ensures that 
VA will make the necessary improve-
ments to expedite these life insurance 
payments with a goal of disbursing all 
unpaid benefits within 2 years. 
The bill is cosponsored by more than 
40 Members on both sides of the aisle, 
and it has the support of a half-dozen 
veteran service organizations, includ-
ing the VFW, America Legion, Iraq and 
Afghanistan 
Veterans 
of 
America, 
Vietnam Veterans of America, Military 
Officers Association of America, Mod-
ern Military Association of America, 
and Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
PAPPAS for his work and urge all of my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8260, the Faster Payment of Veterans’ 
Survivors Act. 
This bill would improve VA’s deliv-
ery of insurance benefits to survivors. 
One of the provisions would streamline 
insurance payments to beneficiaries 
under the NSLI and the USGLI pro-
grams. 
Another section would make im-
provements to the VA’s process for 
identifying 
and 
paying 
the 
bene-
ficiaries. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
PAPPAS for introducing this bill and for 
his commitment to help VA honor its 
obligation to surviving family mem-
bers. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS), my good 
friend who serves as chair of the Sub-
committee on Oversight and Investiga-
tions of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO and Ranking Mem-
ber BOST for getting these bills to the 
floor, including this important piece of 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 8260, 
the Faster Payments to Veterans’ Sur-
vivors Act. It is a bipartisan bill that 
ensures that VA quickly identifies, lo-
cates, and pays surviving family mem-
bers the life insurance benefits they 
are owed. 
VA’s insurance service already has 
some tools in place to identify, locate, 
and pay hard-to-find beneficiaries, but 
more can be done to prevent these sur-
vivors from needlessly waiting during 
what is likely a difficult time, both 
emotionally and financially. 
My bipartisan bill, the Faster Pay-
ments to Veterans’ Survivors Act, will 
make much needed reforms to allow 
VA to better identify and locate sur-
viving family members of recently de-
ceased veterans. 
By making these reforms, we will 
make sure they receive the payments 
and benefits they were owed in a time-
ly manner. 
According to the VA, the Department 
owed more than $155 million to 15,000 
individuals at the end of September 
2020. 
For a widow or widower who is strug-
gling to make ends meet, a life insur-
ance payment of $10,000 makes a world 
of difference. 
Alfred, a constituent of mine in 
Rochester, New Hampshire, and a Ko-
rean war veteran, shared how much 
this bill will mean to his family. His 
father-in-law, a veteran of World War 
II, passed away last year. Alfred’s 
spouse waited for months to receive 
the survivors benefits owed to her by 
VA. He contacted our office for help 
remedying the issue. We were able to 
help them, but no family should have 
to jump through hoops for months fol-
lowing the loss of a loved one. 
This bill directs the Department to 
improve and better publicize an online 
tool that families of veterans can use 
to search for past due benefits. It ex-
pands access to internal and external 
data sources that will help VA track 
down veterans’ survivors. It makes 
sure the Department is adequately 
staffed to perform these searches. 
The bill also shortens the unneces-
sarily long timeframe in which VA is 
authorized to designate and pay alter-
nate beneficiaries and ensures that pro-
cedures for paying alternate bene-
ficiaries are consistent across several 
different life insurance programs. All 
of these steps will lead to faster pay-
ments to veterans’ survivors. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
NANCY MACE of South Carolina for co- 
leading this bipartisan bill. I appre-
ciate the strong bipartisan support 
from my colleagues and from veterans 
service organizations, including the 
VFW, American Legion, Iraq and Af-
ghanistan Veterans of America, Viet-
nam Veterans of America, Military Of-
ficers Association of America, Modern

September 13, 2022 
Military Association of America, and 
Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
Once enacted, the Faster Payments 
to Veterans’ Survivors Act will have a 
real and positive impact on the finan-
cial well-being of thousands of vet-
erans’ families. 
Our veterans serve our country and 
sacrifice so much, and their family 
members contribute and sacrifice right 
alongside them. It is of utmost impor-
tance that we honor those commit-
ments and support their family mem-
bers. 
The bill passed the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee unanimously in July, and I 
urge the full House to support its pas-
sage today. 
b 1630 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 8260, as amended, the Faster Pay-
ments to Veterans Survivors Act, and I

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8260, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on

The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

JON GLAWE POST OFFICE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5952) to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 123 East Main Street, in 
Vergas, Minnesota, as the ‘‘Jon Glawe 
Post Office’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5952 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. JON GLAWE POST OFFICE. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 123 
East Main Street, in Vergas, Minnesota, 
shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Jon 
Glawe Post Office’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Jon Glawe Post Of-
fice’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. C. 
SCOTT FRANKLIN) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5952, to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated in Vergas, Minnesota, as the 
‘‘Jon Glawe Post Office.’’ 
Jon Glawe was born on January 9, 
1949, in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. He 
grew up on a farm near Vergas and 
graduated from Perham High School in 
1967. After graduating, he moved to 
California and went to Ventura Com-
munity College for 2 years, obtaining 
his associate’s degree. 
In 1970, Mr. Glawe was drafted into 
the U.S. Army and was a sergeant in 
the 3rd Armored Division station in 
Frankfurt, Germany. After being hon-
orably discharged in March of 1972, he 
married his high school sweetheart, 
Darla Olson, in June of 1973. 
As a kid, during snowstorms, Mr. 
Glawe would ride along with his broth-
ers and dad, who was the rural mail 
carrier in Vergas, to help shovel snow 
every time their vehicle stopped or be-
came stuck along the mail route. 
He officially began his career with 
the U.S. Postal Service in Minneapolis 
in 1975. After the passing of his father, 
he added a second full-time job, taking 
over the rural mail route delivering 
mail for Vergas and the surrounding 
areas for 36 years, until his retirement 
in 2011. 
Mr. Glawe became well-known and 
revered by many on his route and 
served as a lifeline for many in the 
community. 
Through 
Minnesota’s 
harshest winter storms, he was known 
to not only deliver mail, but would 
often bring medicine, food, and other 
goods to those in need. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in honoring Mr. Jon Glawe by sup-
porting H.R. 5952. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill, which would name a post office in 
Vergas, Minnesota, for Mr. Jon Glawe. 
Growing up in Vergas, Minnesota, 
Mr. Glawe would ride along with his fa-
ther, who was the rural mail carrier in 
Vergas. After serving in the U.S. Army 
during Vietnam, Mr. Glawe moved to 
Minneapolis and officially began his 
career with the U.S. Post Office in 1975. 
He later moved back to Vergas and 
resumed work on his family’s dairy 
farm. After his father’s death in 1928, 
Mr. Glawe added a second full-time job 
and took over the rural mail route, de-
livering mail to the town of Vergas and 
the surrounding area for 36 years. 
He was well-known on his route and 
served as a lifeline for many in the 
community. Even during the harshest 
of Minnesota winters, he would deliver 
mail, medicine, and food to those in 
need. 
There is no better way to honor Jon 
Glawe’s decades of service to the Post-
al Service than by naming a post office 
after him. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, if the 
gentleman has no further speakers, I 
am prepared to close. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. 
FISCHBACH). 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Florida for 
yielding me time. 
Earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 
5952, a bill that honors the life of Jon 
Glawe, of Vergas, Minnesota. He was a 
mail carrier for 36 years, who left a re-
markable impact on his community. 
Born in 1949, Jon grew up in the 
Vergas area. He was a wrestling cham-
pion, which took him to college in 
California. After being drafted into the 
Army in 1970 and faithfully serving his 
country, he returned home and married 
his 
high 
school 
sweetheart, 
Darla 
Olson. 
As a boy, Jon would join his father 
on the mail route, shoveling the car 
out of the snow, and many Minnesotans 
know that feeling. After his father 
passed away, Jon took up the reins, 
taking on a second full-time job as a 
mail carrier while also running the 
family dairy farm. 
Over the years, he became a beloved 
staple of the community, regularly 
going above and beyond to help his 
neighbors. 
This bill appropriately names the 
post office after Jon to honor his serv-
ice to his neighbors and to the local 
area. In a letter, his family noted that 
since the bill’s introduction, the out-
pouring of support from those who live 
in the Vergas area has been over-
whelming. I agree with their words 
that there is no better way to honor his 
decades of service than this. 
Jon passed away in 2016 and left be-
hind a loving family and many, many 
friends. I urge my colleagues to hear 
the voices of those Jon impacted every 
day and support this bill. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, if the 
gentleman from Florida has no further 
speakers, I am prepared to close. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, and I am prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
passage of H.R. 5952, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members have 5 legisla-
tive days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5650, to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 16605 East Avenue of the Foun-
tains in Fountain Hills, Arizona, as the 
‘‘Dr. C.T. Wright Post Office Building.’’ 
Dr. C.T. Wright was raised in a fam-
ily of sharecroppers as a native of So-
cial Circle, Georgia. He went on to 
graduate from Fort Valley University 
before earning his master of science 
from Clark Atlanta University and his 
Ph.D from Boston University. 
He was a teacher and administrator, 
devoting much of his time to education 
and working for many historically 
Black colleges and universities, includ-
ing 
Morris 
Brown 
College 
and 
Talladega College. In 1982, he became 
the president of Cheney University, the 
first HBCU. 
Dr. Wright also focused his efforts on 
community service, founding the Light 
of Hope Institute that promotes human 
rights around the world. 
For the last 21 years of his life, he 
lived in Arizona, serving as a commu-
nity leader. He was chair of the Ari-
zona Board of Clemency, president of 
the Fountain Hills Kiwanis Club, and 
president of the Arizona African Soci-
ety. In addition, Dr. Wright served as a 
delegate for the Electoral College and 
met six Presidents. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in honoring the life of Dr. C.T. Wright 
by supporting H.R. 5650. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill, which would name an Arizona post 
office building for Dr. C.T. Wright. 
Dr. Wright was a Georgia native and 
dedicated public servant who devoted 
his life to education and community 
service. 
He went to school in Georgia, grad-
uating with a bachelor’s degree from 
Fort Valley State University and a 
master’s degree from Clark Atlanta 
University. 
After obtaining his Ph.D from Boston 
University, he served as a teacher and 
school administrator. Over the course 
of his career, he worked for many of 
the country’s historically Black col-
leges and universities. 
He also emphasized the importance of 
community service and established the 
Light of Hope Institute, which pro-
motes human rights around the world. 
For the last two decades of his life, 
he moved to Arizona and lived in Foun-
tain Hills, outside of Phoenix. There, 
he remained involved in the commu-
nity, serving as the president of the 
Fountain Hills Kiwanis Club and presi-
dent of the Arizona African society. 
Dr. Wright was a devoted public serv-
ant, and I encourage my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT). 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, this 
is one of those—you have already 
touched on C.T.’s resume. But I get to 
do something that is a little unique 
right now. I am not going to give his 
resume again. 
He was my neighbor. He and Mary 
were my friends. 
Have you ever had someone in your 
life, and they are just sort of an ac-
quaintance, and they just ooze some-
thing really unique called love. 
C.T. was a big guy, powerful voice. 
He could sing and the rafters shook. 
Every time he gave the prayer at a 
Kiwanis meeting, or a Republican 
meeting, or something else, I almost 
felt like I was going to do an altar call. 
And being Catholic, that is actually a 
little odd. I thought that would be fun-
nier. 
b 1645 
He and his wife did something amaz-
ing. They were involved in everything 
from my school board to the Arizona 
clemency board. 
The fact of the matter is he had a 
powerful impact on a lot of us who live 
in an upper income suburb on the side 
of Scottsdale, Arizona. It is a beautiful 
place. 
I remember sitting down with him 
and saying, ‘‘Okay, C.T., you are my 
neighbor. You are my friend. Why are 
you a Republican?’’ In this powerful 
voice, ‘‘David, son, I am going to be 
part of that abolitionist party,’’ and 
then he went on to explain his history, 
his life. 
I know often we break down into par-
tisan this, partisan that, but to have 
someone who didn’t look like every 
other suburban person in this neighbor-
hood, and yet, his intellect, his love, 
his wife Mary’s love—they became 
icons in the community because of 
their intellect, because of their love, 
and because of their leadership. 
It proved so powerful for the commu-
nity because so often when there was 
something happening, one of the first 
things we all did was say: Well, we 
have to ask Dr. Wright. What does he 
think? What does he feel? What is his 
understanding of what is going on? 
We lost him a couple of years ago, 
and the community has mourned and 
felt a little bit more hollow since. By 
naming our post office, I am hoping my 
7-year-old daughter and my now-10- 
week-old son will see the plaque and 
will tell the story, and it will become 
part of the heritage of my little town, 
Fountain Hills, Arizona. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
passage of H.R. 5650, and I yield back

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill,

The question was taken; and (two-

rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

Scarcella Post Office Building’’.

map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. C. 
SCOTT FRANKLIN) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5865. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5865 to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 4110 Bluebonnet Drive in Staf-
ford, Texas, as the Leonard Scarcella 
Post Office Building. 
Mayor Leonard Scarcella was a life-
long resident of Stafford. He graduated 
from Texas A&M University with a 
B.B.A. in accounting in 1962. He then 
went on to attend the University of 
Houston Law School and was admitted 
to the State Bar of Texas in 1967. 
From 1963 to 1969, Mayor Scarcella 
served in the Texas National Guard 
with Active Duty in the United States 
Air Force, where he attained the rank 
of sergeant. 
He was first elected as mayor of the 
city of Stafford in 1969 and was the 
longest continuous-serving mayor in 
the United States. 
During his tenure as mayor, he 
fought for 6 years to create and imple-
ment the Stafford Municipal School 
District, the only breakaway school 
district in the Nation to gain the ap-
proval of the Federal courts and the 
only municipal school district within 
the State of Texas. 
In addition, Mayor Scarcella initi-
ated 
the 
Stafford 
Municipal 
Edu-
cational Television Station to bring 
vital, current, and informative pro-
gramming about the city to citizens 
and businesses via cable and internet 
video streaming. 
As well as serving as mayor, he held 
various positions, such as president of 
the board of directors of the Fort Bend 
County Industrial Development Cor-
poration, chair of the Home Rule Char-
ter Commission, and president of the 
Stafford Economic Development Cor-
poration. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in honoring the ac-
complishments of Mayor Scarcella by 
supporting H.R. 5865, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill, which honors Mayor Leonard 
Scarcella. 
In 1969, Mayor Scarcella was first 
elected as the mayor of Stafford, 
Texas, a suburb of Houston. He contin-
ued to serve as mayor until his death 
in 2020, making him the longest contin-
uous-serving mayor in the United 
States. 
During his time as mayor, he helped 
the town develop a strong economy. 
Specifically, in 1995, he worked to 
eliminate the city property tax for all 
taxpayers and eliminated the town’s 
general obligation debt in 2014. Mayor 
Scarcella was a true public servant. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
passage of H.R. 5865, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 5865. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned. 
f

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

f 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
MARY PELTOLA TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER) is recognized for 1 minute. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, it is a 
rare privilege to be able to introduce as 
a new Member the dean of a delegation, 
but that is my particular pleasure 
today. 
There are few honors greater, Madam 
Speaker, in this country than being 
elected by your neighbors and fellow 
Americans to represent them in the 
House of Representatives. I welcome 
Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator SUL-
LIVAN to our Chamber and remind them 
you cannot be appointed to the House 
of Representatives. Only by election 
can one serve in the people’s House. 
It is an extraordinary honor to have 
your friends and neighbors choose you 
to represent them in this body. When 
our friend and colleague Don Young 
passed away earlier this year, this 
House lost a giant. The people of Alas-
ka lost a Representative who had 
served them with great ability, energy, 
courage, and commitment for half a 
century. 
Earlier this month, Alaskans cast 
their votes to send a new Representa-
tive to carry their voice and views in 
Washington. The woman they chose 
just made history with the oath that 
she took. She made history by becom-
ing the first Alaska Native to be elect-
ed to the Congress of the United 
States. 
Madam Speaker, she also made his-
tory as the first woman not to rep-
resent Alaska but to represent Alas-
kans in the House of Representatives. 
Obviously, Senator MURKOWSKI
rep-
resents them in the Senate. 
In Representative MARY
PELTOLA, 
Alaskans chose someone who was not 
only a friend of former Representative 
Don Young but also someone cut from 
the same cloth, someone who believes 
fundamentally in pragmatism, inde-
pendence, and putting Alaska’s unique 
needs first. The Senators applaud that, 
apparently. 
Representative PELTOLA
is widely 
known across Alaska not only for her 
strong record as a State legislator but 
as a champion for rural and Native 
communities who are too often over-
looked by policymakers. Don Young 
did not let that happen. She won’t, ei-
ther. 
She has built solid relationships 
across both parties in Alaska because 
of what many have called her extreme 
kindness and her determination to be-
friend all that she meets. 
Her record reflects Alaskans’ inde-
pendent approach to the most divisive 
issues, and in her election, she ap-
pealed to Democrats, Republicans, and 
Independents. Her campaign slogan re-
flected what she and many others con-
sider the three fundamentals of Alaska: 
fish, family, and freedom. 
Indeed, she has already begun to as-
semble a bipartisan staff to serve her 
constituents. Representative PELTOLA 
has a long record of working well with 
Alaska Republicans and even cam-
paigning for Republican Senator LISA 
MURKOWSKI, who is with us here today, 
when she faced a primary challenge 
from an extreme candidate. 
What Alaskans have known and 
shown by them electing MARY PELTOLA 
is that, like so many other Americans, 
they want to be represented by some-
one who is focused on bipartisanship 
and not on confrontation. They want 
someone who will put people over poli-
tics and get things done. 
That 
has 
been 
Representative 
PELTOLA’s record back home in Alaska, 
and I know it will be her philosophy 
here in Washington. In so many ways, 
she is a perfect successor to Represent-
ative Young, who worked hard to make 
sure his fellow Republicans understood 
Alaskans’ unique challenges and pref-
erences on major issues.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7776 
September 13, 2022 
b 1845 
In similar fashion, Representative 
PELTOLA will be an important addition 
to the House, helping us better under-
stand the perspectives of rural and Na-
tive communities and the special con-
cerns of Alaskans as our majority 
works to deliver results and expand op-
portunities for all Americans. 
I know, Madam Speaker, MARY will 
be warmly welcomed to the House by 
all of her colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle. 
Because Alaska has only one at-large 
Representative in the House, the honor 
falls to me today, as the senior-most 
Member of our party, to introduce her. 
It is an honor I wholeheartedly accept, 
and I now ask my colleagues to join me 
in welcoming Alaska’s new Representa-
tive and someone we will all very 
shortly be calling our good friend, 
MARY PELTOLA. 
The SPEAKER. It is the custom of 
the House for Members of the delega-
tion to join the newly elected and 
sworn-in Members. So if the Senators 
would like to join her in the well, they 
are most welcome. As the dean of the 
delegation, you are welcome to join her 
in the well, and any of our other col-
leagues who would like to join MARY 
PELTOLA in the well. We invite other 
Native Americans to join. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Alaska 
(Mrs. 
PELTOLA). 
Mrs. PELTOLA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Leader HOYER for the very kind 
introduction and most especially for 
his words about my predecessor, Con-
gressman for all Alaska, Don Young. 
I thank you, Speaker PELOSI, Minor-
ity Leader MCCARTHY, and so many of 
my colleagues from both parties who 
have been very kind in welcoming me 
to the House of Representatives. 
I am also so grateful to have my hus-
band, my seven children and their 
loved ones, two grandchildren, and two 
sisters here with me this week. I 
couldn’t do this without their love and 
support and votes. 
It is the honor of my life to represent 
Alaska, a place my elders and ances-
tors have called home for thousands of 
years, where to this day many people 
in my community carry forward our 
traditions of hunting and fishing. 
I am humbled and deeply honored to 
be the first Alaska Native to be elected 
to this body, the first woman to hold 
Alaska’s House seat. But to be clear, I 
am here to represent all Alaskans. I 
will work every day to make all Alas-
kans proud that they have entrusted 
me to carry their voices here. 
I am excited to work with all of you, 
to explain and take action to address 
Alaskans’ needs, just as you did with 
my predecessor, the Congressman for 
all Alaska, Don Young. 
Like all Alaskans, I mourned his 
passing. In Yupik, when we lose a loved 
one, we say ‘‘this is not the end.’’ 
‘‘Tua-i-ngunrituq.’’ 
Don was a true institution, an Alaska 
icon, someone who fought so hard and 
so well for our State for 49 years. I 
know many of you loved Don, and I am 
sorry for your loss, too. I am com-
mitted to securing his legacy of bipar-
tisanship and a deep respect for this in-
stitution. In my few days in Wash-
ington, I have already begun forming 
friendships with colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle. 
Now, I might have a different ap-
proach than Don. You know how soft- 
spoken he was. But you will still be 
hearing all about Alaska, our people, 
and our State’s unique needs. 
I promised Alaskans I would fight for 
our families, to lower the cost of living 
that is pushing too many of us to the 
brink, 
to 
invest 
in 
high-quality 
childcare and early education, and to 
grow Alaska’s economy with good jobs 
that pay a fair wage. 
Resource development is important 
to Alaska’s economy and our national 
energy security, and I look forward to 
working to ensure our State remains a 
global leader. 
I also committed to fighting for our 
fish. For so many Alaska communities, 
fish are life. Our fish harvest is the 
best in the world. Half of the wild 
salmon sold in the world comes from 
our State, supporting good jobs that 
sustain strong communities. Subsist-
ence fishing is not only an essential 
food source for so many Alaska fami-
lies and communities, it is a sacred 
part of our traditions. 
Again, thank you for your warm wel-
come. We have a lot to get done, and I 
am looking forward to getting to work. 
‘‘Thank you very much.’’ ‘‘Quyana 
cakneq.’’

WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
PATRICK RYAN TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) is recognized for 1 minute. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, as 
the dean of the New York delegation, I 
have the distinct honor to rise today to 
introduce the new Member of the 
House of Representatives from New 
York’s 
19th 
Congressional 
District, 
Representative PATRICK RYAN. 
Representative RYAN is a fifth gen-
eration New Yorker who was born and 
raised in Kingston, New York. After 
graduating from the U.S. Military 
Academy at West Point, he served our 
Nation as an Army intelligence officer 
and deployed for two combat tours in 
Iraq. 
Returning to New York as a deco-
rated veteran, Congressman RYAN went 
on to become a successful small busi-
ness owner before returning to public 
service as the County Executive of Ul-
ster County. 
As County Executive, Representative 
RYAN has been shown to be a dedicated 
public servant, and I know he does not 
take his new role lightly. 
As the dean of the delegation, I know 
I speak on behalf of the entire delega-
tion when I say that Representative 
RYAN
will be a wonderful colleague 
whose experience, entrepreneurial lead-
ership, and history of devoted service 
to our country will help this Chamber 
navigate the challenges of our times. 
I am now honored, Madam Speaker, 
to yield to a fellow New Yorker (Mr. 
RYAN). 
Mr. RYAN of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. NADLER for those 
kind words and introduction. I am 
proud to rise today as one of the new-
est Members and Representatives in 
the House, serving the great people of 
New York’s 19th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
On a clear, crisp May morning in 
2004, I stood proudly with my West 
Point classmates, raised my right 
hand, and solemnly swore an oath to 
protect and defend our Constitution 
from all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
I still vividly remember the mix of 
emotions I felt as my classmates and I 
tossed a thousand white service caps si-
multaneously into the air—elation, re-
lief, honor, pride, but mostly the tre-
mendous weight of responsibility that 
came with that oath. 
I didn’t know exactly what lay 
ahead, but I knew I would soon lead 
troops in combat and that it would be 
my job to protect my fellow soldiers, to 
serve my country, to serve my commu-
nity, to make difficult decisions with 
life or death consequences, and always 
to maintain my integrity, no matter 
what. 
Today, 18 years later, I am so proud 
to have renewed that oath to protect 
and serve our great Nation. The weight 
of the responsibility I feel today stand-
ing before you-all is even greater. The 
same way that I fiercely protected my 
fellow soldiers, I will fight for my con-
stituents, the community that raised 
me, that sent me care packages every 
single week when I was deployed over-
seas, that has had my back every step 
of the way. I will fight for their health, 
I will fight for their safety, and I will 
fight for their freedom. 
As I look up into the gallery, I can 
see my wife, Rebecca, and our two 
young boys, Theo and Cameron. 
Theo is clapping. Good job, buddy. 
They are extremely well behaved to-
night, and for that we are greatly ap-
preciative. 
They are 3 years old and 9 months 
old. They are too young to fully appre-
ciate the significance of this day and 
this moment, but I cannot wait to ex-
plain to them the immense pride I feel 
standing here before you, with you, my 
distinguished colleagues, humbly rep-
resenting my community. 
This is a moment of immense con-
sequence and challenge for our coun-
try. I truly believe it is an all-hands- 
on-deck moment for our democracy. 
I pledge that I will fight every single 
day, with every ounce of my being, to 
deliver for the great people of New 
York’s 19th Congressional District and 
to renew trust and faith in our Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7777 
September 13, 2022 
WELCOMING THE HONORABLE JO-
SEPH 
SEMPOLINSKI 
TO 
THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
KATKO) is recognized for 1 minute. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I join 
my colleagues in the New York Con-
gressional delegation in formally wel-
coming Congressman JOE SEMPOLINSKI 
as the new Representative for New 
York’s 23rd Congressional District. 
As someone who grew up in the 
Painted Post area and is currently 
raising a family in Canisteo, JOE is 
well-suited to represent New Yorkers 
from across the Southern Tier and Fin-
ger Lakes regions in Congress. 
Beyond his local roots, JOE has a 
long history of public service to this 
region, and his record speaks for itself. 
After earning degrees from both 
Georgetown University and Yale, JOE 
took a position as district director for 
Congressman TOM REED so he could 
serve the community where he grew 
up. 
In addition to his years of work with 
Congressman REED, JOE’s commitment 
to service has kept him personally in-
volved in Steuben County politics and 
ultimately led to his decision to run 
for Congress. 
With his demonstrated record of serv-
ice, I am confident that Congressman 
SEMPOLINSKI
will be a strong Rep-
resentative for the families of New 
York’s 23rd Congressional District. 
I am proud to welcome him as a col-
league, and, along with the rest of the 
New York delegation, to extend my 
heartfelt congratulations to JOE, his 
wife, Angie, and two beautiful daugh-
ters up in the balcony. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the remain-
der of my time to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. SEMPOLINSKI). 
b 1900 
Mr. SEMPOLINSKI. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congressman KATKO for that 
wonderful introduction. I thank my fel-
low New York State delegation mem-
bers for joining me. I thank the Minor-
ity Leader for being here. It is an 
honor to be the Representative of the 
people of the Southern Tier and Finger 
Lakes. 
I am blessed to have my family with 
me. My parents are here; they have 
given me everything. My in-laws, who 
have always treated me like family, 
are here. I would not be standing here 
without the support of my wife, Angie, 
who is my soulmate and best friend. 
I am also joined by my daughters. My 
younger daughter Maddie is with us. 
She is my bright-eyed, little sweet-
heart; she is 2. And I am joined by my 
older daughter Jojo. She is clapping. 
I think other Down syndrome parents 
will understand what I mean when I 
say that in the person of Jojo I am 
joined today in this Chamber by my 
hero. 
Over the last few months, I have been 
repeatedly asked, ‘‘Why would you run 
when 
you 
will 
only 
serve 
for 
4 
months?’’ My answer has always been, 
‘‘It would be an honor to serve for 4 
minutes.’’ Most people in history have 
had to live their lives under despots 
and tyrants, but not here, not in Amer-
ica. That is the freedom our ancestors 
purchased for us at such great cost. We 
choose those who speak for us. To do so 
is a sacred thing. 
We have so many challenges right 
now as a Nation. Rising prices steal 
from those who can least afford it. 
Crime puts fear in all of our hearts. 
And, sadly, so many feel that they are 
not heard by their Government. 
I can tell the people of the 23rd Dis-
trict, without doubt, they are heard. I 
am blessed to be from one of the most 
beautiful places on Earth. I pray that I 
can be worthy of the people who have 
sent me here to speak for them. 
f

Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2022 
No. 147 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable RAPH-
AEL G. WARNOCK, a Senator from the 
State of Georgia. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Our Father and our God, in the si-
lence of this moment, we feel gratitude 
for the privilege of approaching Your 
throne of grace. 
Lord, we come to You aware that 
You know us better than we know our-
selves. We are grateful that You know 
what we need even before we ask. For-
give our mistakes and the wrong we 
have done. 
Lord, You know that, at times, we 
have been difficult to live with. En-
liven our lawmakers. Let Your power 
come among them, as You direct them 
according to Your will. Remind them 
that their lives, Nation, and world are 
in Your hands. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the

f 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, September 13, 2022. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable RAPHAEL G. WARNOCK, 
a Senator from the State of Georgia, to per-
form the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. WARNOCK thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 4822 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand there is a bill at the desk that 
is due for a second reading. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will read the title of 
the bill for a second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4822) to amend the Federal Elec-
tion Campaign Act of 1971 to provide for ad-
ditional disclosure requirements for corpora-
tions, labor organizations, Super PACs and 
other entities, and for other purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceedings. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will be placed on the calendar. 
f 
ABORTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, short-
ly after the news leaked that the U.S. 
Supreme Court was ready to overturn 
Roe v. Wade, Leader MCCONNELL ac-
knowledged that a Federal ban on 
abortion 
was 
now 
‘‘possible’’—his 
words. Well, later today, the senior 
Senator from South Carolina is going 
to make good on Leader MCCONNELL’s 
warning by introducing a radical bill to 
institute a nationwide restriction on 
abortions. 
Proposals like the one today send a 
clear message from MAGA Republicans 
to women across the country: your 
body, our choice. Rather than expand-
ing women’s rights, MAGA Republicans 
would curtail them rather than give in-
dividuals the freedom to make their 
own healthcare choices. They hand 
that power over to radical politicians. 
And let me add this. Republicans are 
twisting themselves into pretzels try-
ing to explain why they want nation-
wide abortion bans when they said they 
would leave it up to the States. Even 
the senior Senator from South Caro-
lina said a few months ago that ‘‘if the 
Supreme 
Court 
overturns 
Roe 
v. 
Wade,’’ it would mean that ‘‘every 
state will decide if abortion is legal 
and on what terms.’’ And yet here he 
is, introducing a bill to restrict abor-
tions nationally. 
For the hard right, this has never 
been about States’ rights. This has 
never been about letting Texas choose 
its own path while California takes an-
other. No, for MAGA Republicans this 
has always been about making abor-
tion illegal everywhere. 
The contrast has become clear. While 
Democrats want to protect a woman’s 
freedom to choose, MAGA Republicans 
want to take that right away with pro-
posals to ban abortions, to punish 
women and doctors for carrying out 
abortions, and even to push bans with 
no exceptions for rape or incest. 
We are seeing it play out across the 
country. It is chilling—chilling—to the 
bone. Every single American should 
stand in opposition against these rad-
ical MAGA Republican views. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
on the IRA, this afternoon I will join 
with my Senate Democratic colleagues 
at the White House to celebrate the en-
actment of the Inflation Reduction Act

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4546 
September 13, 2022 
of 2022. When this bill passed the Sen-
ate a little over a month ago, I ex-
pressed confidence that this legislation 
would signal a turning point in our 
country’s fight to lower costs, to meet 
our Nation’s climate challenges, and to 
usher in the era of affordable clean en-
ergy. 
A month later, the good news is al-
ready pouring in. Companies like Toy-
ota have announced billions in new in-
vestments to start manufacturing bat-
teries for electric and hybrid vehicles 
right here in America. Elsewhere, 
Honda and LG Energy have also re-
cently announced over $4 billion for EV 
battery 
production 
in 
the 
United 
States. And recently, the CEO of First 
Solar said it was the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act that provided the ‘‘clarity’’ 
needed to make their investments here 
in America. 
Had we not done this, many of these 
plants would have been built but prob-
ably overseas. And yet, despite this 
record of success, despite the fact that 
Democrats have told Republicans that 
this is opening a new way for the fu-
ture for American jobs with good fu-
tures here, not one Republican voted in 
favor of this bill. 
That is the difference between the 
two parties in a nutshell: While MAGA 
Republicans are fixated on their ex-
tremist agenda, Democrats are focused 
on creating jobs, lowering costs, bring-
ing our country together. While Demo-
crats will join today with President 
Biden to promote our job-creating 
agenda, Republicans will spend today 
introducing new, radical legislation to 
ban abortions on the national level, 
right here on the Senate floor. That is 
the contrast between the parties, clear 
as day, and we know which side the 
American people are on. 
And while Democrats want to lower 
costs, 
increase 
prosperity, 
and 
strengthen ladders to the middle class, 
the junior Senator from Florida, who 
serves as the chief elections architect 
for Senate Republicans, continues to 
promote 
tax 
hikes—tax 
hikes—for 
working families and putting Medicare 
on the chopping block. 
This split screen is unmistakable for 
all Americans to see for themselves. 
Democrats will spend today focused on 
the 
job-creating, 
inflation-fighting 
agenda we promised and delivered for 
the American people, while Repub-
licans continue defending tax hikes for 
the working class while pushing na-
tional abortion bans here in the Sen-
ate. And the American people will have 
no trouble deciding for themselves 
which party is truly in their corner. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. On judges, last night 
I moved to file cloture on the nomina-
tion of Sarah Merriam to be U.S. cir-
cuit judge for the Second Circuit. She 
will be the sixth circuit court judge 
this Chamber has considered since the 
beginning of this work period—the 
sixth. She will be in exceedingly good 
company. 
Later today, we will vote on the 
nomination of Arianna Freeman to be 
U.S. circuit judge for the Third Circuit, 
followed by cloture on the nomination 
of Lara Montecalvo to serve on the 
First Circuit. 
Altogether, the Senate has now con-
firmed 80—80—judicial nominations to 
serve lifetime appointments on the 
Federal bench. I made clear that con-
firming more of President Biden’s judi-
cial nominees would be a top priority 
for Senate Democrats, and we are mak-
ing good on our promise by being on 
track to vote on six circuit court 
judges in the first 2 weeks of this work 
period alone. 
Among the judges confirmed this 
month are a number of notable firsts: 
the first Latino to serve from the State 
of Washington to the Ninth Circuit, the 
first Black Tennessean to ever sit on 
the Sixth Circuit, and the first Asian 
American from anywhere to sit on the 
Seventh Circuit. And that is just in the 
last 2 weeks. 
The 80 jurists we have confirmed also 
include the first Native American 
judge, the first Muslim American dis-
trict judge, and the first Black woman, 
of course, in the history of the U.S. Su-
preme Court. I mention these firsts be-
cause even though it takes a lot to be 
a successful jurist, representation is a 
key part of the equation. 
There has been a lot of talk lately 
about the public’s trust in our courts— 
in my judgment, for very good reasons. 
So if our courts are to long endure—to 
say nothing of our democracy—they 
must reflect the rich vibrancy of our 
country. 
So as we continue confirming judges, 
we will make sure that the individuals 
on the bench meet this important 
standard. We have come a very long 
way, but there is much work left to be 
done. 
f 
NATIONAL SEPSIS DAY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, fi-
nally, on sepsis, I want to say a few 
words on a health issue that rarely gets 
the attention it deserves here on the 
Senate floor, and that is the issue of 
sepsis. Every year, roughly 1.7 million 
Americans are infected with sepsis. 
That is a population roughly the size of 
Phoenix, AZ. Of those, 270,000—270,000— 
are ultimately killed by the disease. 
For those unfamiliar, sepsis is a ter-
rible, life-threatening condition where 
the body overreacts to an infection in 
an extreme way. Most cases are pre-
ventable, if they are caught with 
enough time. Sadly, because of a lack 
of public awareness, too many cases fly 
under the radar until it is too late. 
So today, I am here to introduce a 
resolution designating September 13 as 
National Sepsis Day. It would encour-
age greater public education about this 
condition, urge Federal entities to 
streamline treatment guidelines, and 
marshal our resources to ultimately 
bring sepsis to an end. 
The Federal Government has a great 
model to follow in my home State of 
New York, which adopted Rory’s Regu-
lations to guide health officials when it 
comes to this illness named in honor of 
Rory Staunton, a 12-year-old from 
Queens who died from sepsis 10 years 
ago. These rules have undoubtedly 
saved countless lives and should inform 
Federal policy. 
I cannot imagine the profound suf-
fering that Rory’s parents must feel to 
this day, but I hope they find strength 
in knowing that the rules bearing their 
son’s name have gone a long way to 
help others. 
It is time we take this disease seri-
ously at the Federal level. For that 
reason, I am proud to introduce this 
resolution today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Just a few minutes 
ago, yet again, the American people re-
ceived a monthly inflation report that 
was even worse than the expert pre-
dictions. 
The expectation was that Democrats’ 
runaway inflation might finally begin 
to actually level off. The top-line infla-
tion rate was expected to fall. Instead, 
yet again, the opposite happened. Over-
all inflation was up even higher. 
The prices this past August were still 
8.3 percent higher than they were in 
August of 2021. Just a catastrophically 
high inflation rate. 
Food prices went up another 0.8 per-
cent just this past month alone. Over-
all food prices just logged their biggest 
1-year increase since the late 1970s. 
Groceries in particular are now 13.5 
percent more expensive than they were 
at this time last year. Democrats’ poli-
cies are sucker-punching American 
families every time they set foot in the 
checkout line. Eggs are up 40 percent. 
Butter, up 25 percent. Baby food, up 13 
percent. Chicken, dairy, bread, cereal, 
and canned fruits and vegetables are 
all up around 16 percent each. Coffee is 
up even more than that. 
Housing and shelter costs were up. 
Medical costs were up. Furniture, up. 
New cars, up. 
Electricity costs were way, way up— 
a 15.8-percent increase since last year. 
So let me say that again. Inflation on 
Americans’ electricity bills alone— 
alone—is 15.8 percent in just the last 12

months. This is the largest 1-year in-
crease in electricity prices since 1981, 
when the statistic was looking back 
into the final months of Jimmy Carter. 
Even if you take out energy and food 
prices—two areas where the adminis-
tration likes to pass the buck and pre-
tend they are powerless—inflation sky-
rocketed 0.6 percent in just the month 
of August alone. 
Eight-point-three percent inflation— 
just an astonishing number. And re-
member, this figure only looks back 12 
months, but we are now more than 12 
months into the Democrats’ inflation 
spiral. Prices are 8.3 percent higher 
today than in August of 2021, but re-
member, in August 2021, the baseline, 
we were already talking about runaway 
inflation. Prices were already way up 
compared to the year before that. So 
the 12-month number dramatically un-
derstates the total damage that Demo-
crats have caused. 
Here is the comparison that matters 
most to American families, especially 
with an election in less than 2 months: 
How are things today compared to Jan-
uary 2021, when this all-Democratic 
government was sworn in? How are 
they compared to January 2021? Here is 
the answer: Food prices are up a total 
of 13.9 percent since President Biden 
was sworn in. Gas prices are up 58.5 
percent. Electricity costs are up 21.6 
percent. And the overall, across-the- 
board inflation rate since President 
Biden took office is a catastrophic— 
catastrophic—12.5 percent. 
This very day, President Biden and 
Democrats are having a big celebration 
for their latest reckless spending bill, 
which they pretended would reduce in-
flation but which nonpartisan experts 
say will actually make it worse. They 
could not look more out of touch if 
they tried. 
f 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on another matter, this past weekend, 
Vice President HARRIS
made a sur-
prising announcement on ‘‘Meet the 
Press.’’ The Vice President declared— 
listen to this—‘‘The border is secure.’’ 
We are about to close the fiscal year 
with more than 2 million illegal immi-
grant encounters on our southern bor-
der, breaking the alltime record that 
we only just set last year. Seizures of 
lethal fentanyl are also on pace to ex-
ceed last year’s total. They are up 
more than 200 percent in just the latest 
month on record. These are not the 
signs of a secure border, and the Amer-
ican people know it. An outright ma-
jority of the country disapproves of 
how President Biden has been handling 
this issue. The Vice President’s claims 
aren’t fooling anyone. 
For 
years 
now, 
this 
crisis 
has 
stretched border communities to the 
breaking point and caused ripples 
throughout the entire country. All the 
while, 
Democrats 
have 
claimed 
it 
would be cruel or uncompassionate to 
have a functioning southern border or 
actually enforce our laws. 
Now, in recent weeks, the country 
has been treated to one of the more 
striking displays of irony we have seen 
in quite a while. 
For many years, while the citizens 
and local governments on the border 
have cried out for help and law enforce-
ment, various Democrat-run cities and 
States that aren’t on the border de-
cided to set themselves up as virtue 
signaling sanctuary cities, where im-
migration laws supposedly simply do 
not apply. For years, much of the polit-
ical left has suggested there are no le-
gitimate practical reasons why our 
country would want secure borders or 
to enforce its immigration laws. Only 
racism or xenophobia could possibly 
explain it. 
Well, for several weeks now, some of 
these overwhelmed States have decided 
to try taking some of these Democrat- 
run jurisdictions at their word. 
Governor Abbott in Texas and Gov-
ernor Ducey in Arizona have put a very 
small proportion of the illegal immi-
grants pouring into their States onto 
buses bound for the self-advertised 
sanctuary cities of New York and 
Washington. And do you know what? 
Just this very small taste of chaos, 
this tiny little sliver of what many 
places in America have been dealing 
with for years, has these cities’ Demo-
cratic leaders outraged, anxious, and 
scrambling. 
Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, 
has only had to receive in 5 weeks 
roughly the number of people the Bor-
der Patrol encounters in 7 or 8 hours. 
New York has had over a month to 
handle a fraction—a fraction—of 1 
day’s share of border crossings. Yet the 
mayor says having to deal with this is 
‘‘horrific.’’ New York City officials 
complain that they are overwhelmed. 
Here in Washington, the destination 
for fewer than 8,000 illegal immigrants, 
the Democrat Mayor has declared a 
public health emergency. She begged 
the Pentagon to send in the National 
Guard for help. The Defense Depart-
ment, of course, turned her down. 
It is incredible just how quickly 
Democrats change their tune when 
they have to stomach one single spoon-
ful—spoonful—of the policies they have 
been force-feeding the rest of our coun-
try. Oh, it is challenging to have waves 
of illegal immigrants pouring into your 
community? This creates challenges 
for housing and medical care and re-
source allocation and law enforcement? 
Who knew all this? 
As one former mayor from the 
frontlines of this crisis put it recently, 
‘‘The city of McAllen was able to deal 
with thousands of immigrants a day. I 
think they can handle a few hundred.’’ 
Maybe this will be the wake-up call 
the Democrats need to finally under-
stand that functional nations—func-
tional nations—need functional bor-
ders.

CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, this is 
going to be an unusual set of comments 
for me because I am going to start out 
with some personal history, which I 
hope will make sense in terms of what 
I want to address. 
I started working in the alternative 
energy industry in 1983. When I say in-
dustry, it was, actually, a very small 
company 
developing 
small 
hydro 
projects in Maine and New England. We 
then worked on the development of bio-
mass projects. We, later on, worked on 
wind power and then also on the devel-
opment of large-scale conservation. So 
my professional life has largely been 
occupied with energy and particularly 
with renewable energy. 
At the same time, I had a deep his-
tory in Maine in environmental mat-
ters. I represented the environmental 
community in Maine before the Maine 
Legislature, in the seventies, if you can 
believe that anybody around here was 
still doing things in the seventies. I 
also, as Governor, was very active in 
conservation matters and am proud to 
say that, during my 8 years as the Gov-
ernor of Maine, we put aside and set 
into conservation and protection sta-
tus more land than in the prior 175- 
year history of Maine combined. This 
has been a passion of mine, the protec-
tion of the environment, for my entire 
life—so the history of renewable energy 
development and also environmental 
advocacy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4548 
September 13, 2022 
I learned some lessons when I was 
working in the field of developing al-
ternative or renewable energy. The 
most important lesson is that there is 
no free lunch when it comes to energy. 
There are always costs and benefits. 
There are always impacts that some 
people think are terrific and that other 
people think are not so good. There are 
always trade-offs. 
In fact, I will never forget my going 
to hearings on hydro projects and hav-
ing people come and object and saying: 
We like hydro but not on our river, not 
on this site, and, by the way, we don’t 
really think you should be ruining the 
rivers. Why don’t you go and do wind 
power? 
Lo and behold, 20 years later, I 
worked in the area of wind develop-
ment, of wind power, and people came 
to our hearings and said: We don’t real-
ly need to spoil the view in our moun-
tains. Do more hydro. 
I am not making that up. I actually 
lived that sort of conflict. 
The second lesson I learned is that 
you may have global goals with renew-
able energy but have local impacts, and 
you often have a controversy about a 
particular project. 
The third thing I learned is that 
change is hard. Everybody is for 
progress. Nobody is for change. Change 
is difficult, whether it is for a local 
community, a State, or a nation. 
The fourth thing: Permitting is hard. 
Getting permits for renewable energy 
projects was lengthy, time-consuming, 
and expensive. This was serious learn-
ing that I had during this period in 
that, if you want to develop even the 
most beneficial project, you are going 
to have to go through an often arduous 
permitting process, and somebody isn’t 
going to like it. There always will be 
trade-offs. 
These were sporadic, small projects. 
Indeed, in New England today—and I 
just checked this morning—about 10 
percent of our electricity comes from 
renewables. This is after almost 40 
years of the development of these 
projects—about 10 percent. We are now 
talking about a transition in energy to 
a fully renewable future. Well, if you 
do the math, that means 10 times the 
amount of renewable energy develop-
ment which we have done in the last 40 
years, in the next 10 to 15 years. People 
have to understand that this is a 
major, major change that is going to 
require trade-offs. It is going to require 
us to make decisions and to under-
stand—again, to go back to my basic 
premise—that there is no free lunch. 
We are now undertaking the largest 
and most far-reaching energy transi-
tion in human history. The transition 
to fossil fuels took about 150 years. 
Going back to around 1800, you can see 
the graphic goes up, but we really got 
into the real heart of the fossil fuel 
economy in the mid-20th century—150 
years. 
We 
are 
talking 
about 
transitioning away from fossil fuels to 
renewables over 15 years—not 150 but 
15. 
We have to grasp that this is an enor-
mous undertaking and that it is going 
to involve change. We are literally in a 
race with climate change. That is why 
it is going to have to happen in the 
next 10, 15, 20 years, because the con-
sequences of not doing it are cata-
strophic, and we are already seeing 
that. 
I think that we have reached a point 
at which most Americans realize that 
climate change is real. The fishermen 
in Maine know it. The loggers know it. 
The farmers know it. The people who 
work with the land and the sea and the 
atmosphere understand what is hap-
pening. They see it. The animals know 
it. They know what is happening, and 
that is why we have to make this tran-
sition. That is why it is so important 
that we make this transition, and it 
has got to be fast. We don’t have time 
to do it over 150 years or even over 50 
years. It is a huge change. It is going 
to involve dislocation, and it is going 
to involve trade-offs. That is really the 
question that I want to address today. 
There is broad agreement, I believe, 
that we need change, that we need to 
develop responses to the global climate 
change crisis. There is certainly agree-
ment in the environmental community 
as far as that question is concerned. 
There is nobody in the environmental 
community whom I know who doubts 
climate change or doubts the necessity 
of taking dramatic action to meet it. 
Climate change is as real as it gets, 
and we have to address it. 
How do we address it? With nonfossil 
fuel electrification—fast. If we can do 
that, we can address the CO2. Really, 
what we are talking about is the emis-
sion of CO2. Is it a problem? Well, the 
average over the past million years of 
CO2 in the atmosphere is about 280 
parts per million. It varies up and 
down. 
People say: Oh, this is a natural 
cycle. 
Yes, it varies up and down between 
150 and 300 parts per million. It is now 
at about 420 parts per million. It has 
gone up 20 in the last 2 or 3 years. The 
last time we were over 400 parts per 
million of CO2 in the atmosphere the 
oceans were 60 feet higher. We are in 
unchartered territory in human his-
tory right now. We have to deal with 
it, and we have to deal with it in a 
hurry. 
Where is all of that CO2 coming from? 
Well, here is a rough breakdown of the 
CO2 budget, if you will: About 30 per-
cent comes from the generation of elec-
tricity—30, 35 percent. Another 30, 35 
percent comes from transportation, the 
combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles. 
The last 30, 35 percent comes from 
space heat and industrial use. So that 
is the budget that we have to deal 
with. How do we tackle that? With 
electrification, with the electricity 
coming from renewable sources. 
Now, if you have an electric vehicle 
and you are feeling really good about 
saving the environment, you are not 
saving the environment if the power 
for that electric vehicle comes from 
fossil fuels. You are saving the environ-
ment if the power for that electric ve-
hicle comes from renewables. So that is 
what we are talking about, but there 
are problems with renewables. 
Remember, I said I had worked in the 
wind power business. The wind doesn’t 
blow all the time. The Sun doesn’t 
shine all the time. The 
term 
is 
‘‘intermittency.’’ That is the issue. 
That is the issue with renewables— 
intermittency—the fact that there has 
to be something to supply power when 
the Sun doesn’t shine and the wind 
doesn’t blow. 
The answer to that is storage. The 
real Green New Deal is energy storage. 
If we can solve that problem in a cost- 
effective way, then we really can have 
a realistic, all-renewable future, be-
cause what you have with energy stor-
age, plus renewables, is essentially 
baseload power without CO2. That is 
really the direction that we are moving 
in. 
However—and this is what I want to 
really stress—you can’t be in favor of 
electrification; you can’t be in favor of 
renewable power; you can’t be in favor 
of electric vehicles if you are not in 
favor of mining the lithium that you 
need for the batteries or in covering a 
lot of farmers’ fields with solar panels. 
You can’t have those things without 
paying a price. It would be nice if you 
could. 
I would love it if I could wave a wand 
and say: We are going to get rid of fos-
sil fuels, and we are going to have an 
all-renewable future. Yes, I want that, 
but we have to recognize that, in order 
to get there, there are some things we 
have to do that heretofore we really 
haven’t been very likely to like. 
One of the other issues with renew-
able power is that a lot of the renew-
able power is in places where there 
aren’t people. So we have to get that 
renewable power to the places where 
there are people. 
Do you know what that means? 
Transmission, new transmission lines, 
new rights of way. People aren’t going 
to be too crazy about that, but you 
can’t have a renewable energy future 
without having transmission, and you 
can’t have a renewable energy future 
without having batteries or some stor-
age technology that, chances are, is 
going to require Earth minerals that 
you are going to have to mine. 
Geography is a problem. Technology 
is a problem. This will require trade- 
offs. We have to keep in mind that we 
are talking about a global goal—we are 
talking about literally saving the 
Earth—but we have to understand that 
there are going to be costs to do so. 
Let’s talk about permitting. 
One of my favorite stories is when 
God went to Moses and said: Moses, I 
have good news and bad news. 
Moses said: God, give me the good 
news. 
God says: I am going to empower you 
to part the waters of the Red Sea, 
allow my people to go free, and then

have the waters come back and inun-
date Pharaoh’s army. 
Moses says: That is wonderful, God. 
What is the bad news? 
God says: You have to prepare the 
environmental impact statement. 
We have got to understand that per-
mitting is part of the process of going 
to a renewable future. 
Now, when I was the Governor of 
Maine, I had a very clear policy: no 
diminution—no cutting, no cutting 
corners—of environmental standards, 
but I wanted the most timely and pre-
dictable 
environmental 
permitting 
process in the country, and I don’t 
think that those two things are in any 
way mutually exclusive. 
When I talk here and work with my 
colleagues here about permitting re-
form, I am talking—we are talking— 
about the process, not the standards. 
We are not talking about lowering the 
standards, saying that you can emit 
more or you don’t have to meet clean 
water standards. 
I sit at Edmund Muskie’s desk in my 
office. Lightning would strike me if I 
were lowering the water quality or air 
quality standards, but we have got to 
talk about a process that is timely and 
predictable. 
The estimates are that, to permit a 
mine in this country, it takes about 10 
years—about 10 years. We don’t have 10 
years to spend on a permitting process 
if we are going to solve this problem in 
time to save the country and the plan-
et. We have got to figure out how to do 
this in a more timely way. How are we 
going to do it? I don’t know the details 
of the various discussions that are 
going 
on 
here, 
but 
I 
have 
some 
thoughts that I have suggested to Sen-
ator MANCHIN and others. 
One 
is 
one-stop 
shopping. 
You 
shouldn’t have to go to five different 
Agencies. Go to one Agency that is in 
charge of the permitting process, and 
let them lead it. Don’t make the appli-
cant go to five, six, seven different 
Agencies. 
Secondly are deadlines—real dead-
lines, deadlines that mean something— 
so that the Agency, if it says 180 days, 
has got to have a decision in 180 days. 
Eisenhower 
retook 
Europe 
in 
11 
months. There is no reason that we 
can’t get decisions out of some of these 
Agencies in less than a year. So dead-
lines and reasonable timeframes, I 
think, are part of this process, and an 
accelerated appeals process, where the 
appeal of an environmental decision on 
a renewable energy project, that is re-
lated to renewable energy, or that is 
related to our renewable energy future 
can go to the courts and get a fair 
hearing but on a timely basis and not 
go through a long process that takes, 
again, years. 
Another suggestion I have—and this 
goes back to my experience of working 
on renewable energy projects—is there 
should be some credit given for the na-
ture of the project that you are doing. 
In other words, if you are doing a 
project that is going to contribute to 
the solution of the problem of global 
climate change, you shouldn’t be treat-
ed as a strip mall. Some weight should 
be given to the import and the value— 
the 
environmental 
value—of 
the 
project, vis-a-vis the incidental envi-
ronmental costs—and I could be criti-
cized for using the word ‘‘incidental,’’ 
but the smaller environmental costs 
that may be involved in getting there. 
I think that has got to be how we ap-
proach this whole permitting question. 
So why am I here today? I am here 
today to talk to my friends in the envi-
ronmental community—and I do mean 
friends, people whom I have worked 
with all my life—to have them change 
the way they think about the environ-
mental process and what they have 
conventionally 
and 
historically 
thought about this kind of action. 
Historically, if you go back to the be-
ginning of the environmental move-
ment in the sixties and seventies—and 
Lord, help me, I was there—the envi-
ronmental movement was about stop-
ping things. The environmental move-
ment in Maine began with a proposed 
oil refinery on our coast. People want-
ed to stop it because they didn’t think 
it was the appropriate place. But if you 
think about that, a lot of the environ-
mental movement has been about stop-
ping things, stopping projects, stopping 
highways, stopping whatever. 
What we have to do now is think 
about facilitating getting things done 
in order to get to the renewable future 
that we want. I think that is a very, 
very important way to look at this 
process. You can’t be for EVs if you are 
against mining lithium. 
Let me give you just a couple of 
numbers on what I am talking about. 
Copper—remember, 
I 
talked 
about 
transmission. Copper, copper wires to 
transmit electricity, the estimate is—I 
want to be sure this is right. The esti-
mate is we are going to need as much 
copper annually by 2050 as has been 
mined in the entire prior history of the 
world. In 1 year, we are going to need 
that much. The estimate is that in 
order to achieve our climate goals, we 
are going to have to triple—triple—the 
grid: the wires, the rights of way, the 
towers. The grid infrastructure has to 
be tripled in order to absorb the new 
and transmitted—distribute the new 
energy that is going to be needed. If 
you have electric vehicles, you are 
going to need more wires to get the 
power—that is going to be a huge in-
crease; between doubling and tripling 
is the estimate—of the strength of the 
grid. 
The International Energy Agency— 
not me and not some commercial 
group, but the International Energy 
Agency says that by 2040—that is not 
that long from now, barely over 15 
years—we are going to need 42 times 
the amount of lithium that we have, 25 
times more graphite, 21 times more co-
balt, 19 times more nickel, and 7 times 
more rare-earth elements. Now, we 
have two choices: We can buy those 
things from other countries, particu-
larly countries that may be potential 
adversaries. Do we really want to be 
dependent on China for this kind of es-
sential material to our environmental 
future? I don’t think so. But if we are 
going to say we don’t want to import 
it, we have got to get it out of the 
ground here, and we can’t spend 10 
years deciding it. I am not saying 
lower the standards, but I am saying 
the process itself should not be used as 
a weapon to undermine projects that 
are necessary to achieve our ultimate 
climate goal. 
This is a change. This is a change of 
thinking that is required by the reality 
that we face. I am here because I want 
to face that reality. I want to do some-
thing about climate change. I want to 
take the actions necessary, not token 
actions but the real deal. But it is 
going to involve these enormous com-
mitments of time, effort, and money 
and also our understanding—particu-
larly in the environmental commu-
nity—that there is no free lunch. 
On December 2, 1862, Abraham Lin-
coln came to this Congress to talk 
about the progress of the Civil War. His 
problem was that the Congress was 
being the Congress. They were doing 
politics, and he didn’t feel they were 
really taking it seriously or understood 
the massive change that was sweeping 
over the country. At the end of that 
speech, the afternoon of December 2, 
1862, Abraham Lincoln gave what I 
think is still the best analysis of how 
you deal with change that I have ever 
encountered, and I think it applies ex-
actly in this situation. Lincoln said: 
The dogmas of the quiet past, are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion 
is piled high with difficulty, [therefore] we 
must rise—with the occasion. As our case is 
new, so we must think anew, and act anew. 
And then here is the key line: 
We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we 
shall save our country. 
‘‘We must disenthrall ourselves and 
then we shall save our country.’’ 
‘‘Disenthrall’’ means thinking new 
and different ways. Let go of the way 
you thought about these kinds of issues 
in the past. Disenthrall ourselves, and 
then we shall save our planet.

INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this 
morning the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
released the August inflation numbers, 
and as every American who has been to 
a grocery store lately knows, August 
was yet another month of high infla-
tion. 
Consumer prices rose 8.3 percent last 
month from a year earlier, holding to a 
near-four-decade-high—40-year-high— 
inflation. And Americans are feeling 
the strain.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4550 
September 13, 2022 
Even 1 unexpectedly expensive month 
can be challenging for many families, 
but at least it is actually and usually 
possible to recover from a single tough 
month. How are American families 
going to recover from the months upon 
months upon months of high inflation 
that have marked the Biden economy? 
As I said, American families are suf-
fering. Grocery bills are out of control. 
Between August 2021 and August 2022, 
grocery bills rose at their highest rate 
since 1979—1979, I was a senior in high 
school. Even back-to-school supplies 
like pencils and glue are more expen-
sive. 
The National Retail Federation re-
ported in July that households were on 
track to spend an average of $864 on 
back-to-school shopping—a 24-percent 
increase from 2019. 
Utility bills have soared. Things have 
gotten so bad that approximately one 
out of every six households—one out of 
every six households in America—is be-
hind on its utility bills. Unfortunately, 
considering the increases in the price 
of natural gas and electricity since 
President Biden took office, it is not 
surprising. Forty percent of house-
holds—40 percent—reported having dif-
ficulty paying for their normal house-
hold expenses. 
And Gallup reports that 56 percent of 
Americans—well over half of the U.S. 
population—are experiencing financial 
hardship as a result of inflation. 
The 
personal 
savings 
rate 
has 
plunged to its lowest levels since 2009, 
and many Americans are dipping into 
their savings to make ends meet. Oth-
ers have taken up a side job or are pull-
ing out the credit card. Still others 
have been forced to rely on food banks. 
As recently as Friday, President 
Biden was touting his work to ‘‘finally 
deliver an economy that works for 
working families.’’ I have to say, I 
don’t know what ivory tower the Presi-
dent is living in, but the Biden econ-
omy is the very opposite of an economy 
that works for working families. 
Working families in the Biden econ-
omy are struggling. They are won-
dering how they can make ends meet. 
They are cutting back on groceries like 
meat or milk. They are cutting back 
on family trips or putting off necessary 
home repairs. They are, as I said, dip-
ping into their savings or charging ne-
cessities on their credit cards or vis-
iting food banks. 
A recent CBS News article discussing 
a new Gallup poll noted: 
The findings indicate that the hottest in-
flation in 40 years is eating into the bedrock 
of 
the 
American 
economy—the 
middle- 
class—and even eroding the financial sta-
bility of more well-heeled households. 
To repeat: 
The findings indicate that the hottest in-
flation in 40 years is eating into the bedrock 
of the American economy—the middle-class. 
This is not an economy that is—to 
paraphrase the President—being built 
from the bottom up and the middle 
out. This is not an economy that 
‘‘works for working families.’’ This is 
an economy where living standards for 
working families are declining. 
The President has actually had the 
audacity to repeatedly bring up the 
lines of cars waiting at food banks that 
occurred during the height of the 
COVID pandemic, with the implication 
that things are different now in the 
Biden economy. Perhaps no one at the 
White House has read the news re-
cently. 
Here is a sampling of headlines from 
the past few weeks: 
Las Vegas food banks experiencing height-
ened demand amid inflation spikes. 
Here is another one: 
Food banks feeling pinch of high inflation 
as centers juggle to increased demand for 
help. 
Another headline: 
New Hampshire food pantries struggle with 
rising costs, growing demand: Organizations 
say more people than ever need help. 
Another headline: 
St. Mary’s Food Bank in Phoenix sees 
record number of families in need amid infla-
tion. 
Yet another headline: 
Mountain West food banks are strained by 
high customer demand and low supply. 
Unfortunately, I can go on. At this 
point, everyone knows how we got 
here. Democrats took office and de-
cided to pass a massive $1.9 trillion 
spending bill, the so-called American 
Rescue Plan Act, that flooded the econ-
omy 
with 
unnecessary 
government 
money. And the economy overheated as 
a result. 
When President Biden took office, 
the inflation rate was 1.4 percent, well 
within the Fed’s 2-percent target. 
Democrats were warned, including by 
at least one noted economist from 
their own party, that the legislation 
ran the risk of overheating the econ-
omy. But they were committed to tak-
ing advantage of their new majority to 
push through their Big Government, 
Big Spending vision. And so they ig-
nored the warnings, and their bill 
helped trigger the worst inflation crisis 
in 40 years. 
But perhaps the worst part is that 
even after Democrats saw the damage 
that resulted from their American Res-
cue Plan spending spree, they contin-
ued to try to double down on the spend-
ing strategy that helped get us into 
this mess in the first place. 
Democrats spent half of last year at-
tempting to force through—if you can 
believe 
this—yet 
another 
partisan 
spending spree originally planned to 
cost up to $5 trillion. Fortunately for 
Americans, those particular far-left 
fantasies were foiled. But that hasn’t 
stopped Democrats from continuing to 
accumulate 
wasteful 
government 
spending. 
In August, Democrats forged through 
a partisan tax-and-spending bill that 
will raise Americans’ energy bills, re-
duce jobs and opportunities for Amer-
ican workers, and waste taxpayer dol-
lars on a host of Green New Deal prior-
ities, like electric vehicle tax credits 
for wealthy Americans and road equity 
and identifying gaps in tree canopy 
coverage. They called this tax-and- 
spending spree the Inflation Reduction 
Act, even though—as even the Demo-
crat chairman of the Senate Budget 
Committee admitted—the bill will not 
reduce inflation. Apparently, the title’s 
only function is to make the bill sound 
more acceptable to Americans who are 
sick and tired of dealing with soaring 
prices and economic pain. 
Then, a mere 8 days—8 days—after 
signing the so-called Inflation Reduc-
tion Act, the President once again 
added to Democrats’ record of eco-
nomic malfeasance with a massive stu-
dent loan giveaway that could cost 
more than $1 trillion and that the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et notes will ‘‘meaningfully boost in-
flation.’’ That from the Committee for 
a Responsible Federal Budget. 
I am not sure whether the Democrats 
are incapable of learning their lesson 
or whether they consider soaring prices 
to be a trivial issue next to imple-
menting their Green New Deal agenda 
or whether they think inflation is an 
acceptable price to pay for Big Govern-
ment. But, whatever it is, Democrats 
are apparently going to continue to ig-
nore the economic pain that Americans 
are experiencing in favor of imple-
menting their far-left, Big Govern-
ment, and big-spending agenda. And it 
appears that the American people are 
going to have to continue to suffer as a 
result. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would 
ask consent to speak for up to 5 min-
utes before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF ARIANNA J. FREEMAN 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the pending nomi-
nee, Arianna J. Freeman, who has been 
nominated to serve on the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Third Circuit. For 
those who may not know all the geog-
raphy, that includes, under the juris-
diction of that court, Pennsylvania, 
New Jersey, Delaware, and the Virgin 
Islands. 
Arianna Freeman has dedicated her 
legal career to service, especially in 
the Philadelphia community. After 
graduating from Swarthmore College 
and Yale Law School, Ms. Freeman re-
turned to Philadelphia to start her 
legal career. After clerking for three 
Federal judges in the Eastern District 
of Pennsylvania, she joined the Federal 
Community Defender Office in Phila-
delphia. Through her experience in the 
defender’s office, she has briefed over 
15 appeals in the Third Circuit and pre-
sented oral argument on seven occa-
sions, including before the Third Cir-
cuit en banc, meaning the entire court. 
She has submitted four briefs before 
the U.S. Supreme Court as well. 
Her legal reputation, her intellect, 
her ability, and her integrity are un-
questioned. I will just give you three or

four examples of what others have said 
about her work. 
Former U.S. District Court Judge 
Giles wrote: 
Ms. Freeman has the character and intel-
lectual attributes that will lead her to be a 
wonderful appeals court judge. She is dis-
cerning, open-minded, logical and is both a 
listener and contributor to debate and con-
versation. 
A group of appellate practitioners 
from the Third Circuit wrote as fol-
lows: 
Arianna Freeman has the strong intellect, 
tenacious work ethic, and even temperament 
necessary to become an outstanding federal 
judge. Her integrity and experience will en-
sure that she will be ready to serve from the 
first day. 
Third 
example: 
Given 
Arianna’s 
background as a Federal public de-
fender, perhaps most important is the 
praise that she has received from over 
20 former Federal prosecutors. One 
group wrote: 
We are impressed by Arianna’s diligence, 
intelligence, dedication, and integrity. It is 
because of her ethics 
and 
compassion, 
grounded in sensibility, that we are con-
fident she will provide sound and measured 
opinions, while approaching each case with-
out bias and with respect for the rule of law. 
So said 20 former Federal prosecu-
tors. 
Arianna is so well respected that her 
nomination has garnered strong sup-
port even beyond the State of Pennsyl-
vania, as evidenced by a letter sub-
mitted by over 30 law school professors 
from across the Nation who described 
Arianna Freeman as a ‘‘brilliant, care-
ful, and talented lawyer with impres-
sive professional credentials and a 
strong commitment to fairness, equal 
justice, and the rule of law.’’ 
There is no doubt that Arianna Free-
man’s extensive legal experience, keen 
intellect, and dedication to the prin-
ciples of fairness and equal justice will 
serve the Third Circuit well. Further-
more, if confirmed, she will not only 
provide a critically important profes-
sional perspective to the Third Circuit 
as a career public defender; she will 
also become the first woman of color to 
serve on the Third Circuit and just the 
third active woman on that bench. 
This is an important and historic 
nomination not only for Pennsylvania 
but, of course, for the entire Third Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals. 
I would like to share a final passage 
from a letter written to the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee by a group of law 
school deans from Pennsylvania, New 
Jersey, and Delaware, led by Professor 
Danielle Conway from the Penn State 
Dickinson School of Law. They wrote: 
The nomination of Arianna J. Freeman to 
serve as a judge on the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Third Circuit is inspired 
and her ultimate confirmation will be inspir-
ing. As legislative leaders in this great soci-
ety, the Committee and the full Senate will 
be favorably rewarded with history’s account 
of how you worked to elevate this brilliant 
lawyer to the bench. 
It couldn’t be said any better than 
that. I urge her confirmation and urge 
my colleagues to vote yes. 
I yield the floor.

ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the rising costs of American energy, 
and this morning we found out that in-
flation continues to burn very hot. 
Prices continue to go up and up and 
up. Last month, they actually went up 
faster than even any of the economists 
had predicted. Since Joe Biden took of-
fice, the prices have risen now by more 
than 13 percent across America. That is 
what families are facing. And prices 
have been rising faster than wages for 
the last 17 months. So people are feel-
ing the heat and falling further and 
further behind. 
Today, gas prices are still nearly a 
dollar and a half a gallon higher than 
they were the day Joe Biden took of-
fice, but Democrats are patting them-
selves on the back because gas prices 
have come down from the stratospheric 
$5 a gallon during the peak this sum-
mer. Well, gas is still over $4 a gallon 
in lots of States, including Nevada and 
Washington State, and, of course, at $5 
a gallon, very few people can afford to 
drive. So it is no surprise the prices fell 
as demand plummeted. 
But yet many of the Democrats are 
at the White House this afternoon, ap-
parently in the thousands, to celebrate 
a law that just got passed here. 
These price hikes, these increases in 
costs, this is nothing to celebrate. And 
so in 15 minutes, at the White House, 
Joe Biden is going to lead a celebra-
tion—a party—for a bill that passed 
along party lines. 
We have a crisis of food, a crisis of 
energy, a crisis of rent. People cannot 
afford the cost of living. In terms of en-
ergy, after 2 years in power—I come 
today to the floor as the ranking mem-
ber of the Senate Energy Committee— 
after nearly 2 years in power, Demo-
crats still haven’t lifted a finger to 
produce a drop of additional American 
energy, specifically oil. 
Supply 
is 
down 
below 
the 
prepandemic 
peak. 
Joe 
Biden 
has 
leased the fewest acres of Federal land 
for energy development of any Presi-
dent since World War II—World War II. 
The Biden economy is hitting record 
numbers—40-year record-high inflation. 
Food prices are up higher in terms of 
costs of feeding your family; the rise in 
prices is up higher than in 40 years— 
and now shutting down American en-
ergy with the fewest acres of Federal 
land for energy development since 
World War II. 
Now, Joe Biden had a plan. His plan 
was to invite dictators to sell us oil. 
Officials from the Biden administra-
tion went hat in hand, just a little over 
a year ago, to Vladimir Putin in Rus-
sia, to Iran, to Saudi Arabia, to Ven-
ezuela. The President actually went 
personally to Saudi Arabia to ask for 
more energy and more production. He 
went to Riyadh to beg the Saudis to 
sell us more oil. It didn’t work. 
Actually, the Saudis and the OPEC 
cartel announced last week that they 
are actually going to slash production 
by 100,000 barrels a day. 
When President Obama was in the 
White House, he went on an apology 
tour to the Middle East. This summer, 
Joe Biden went on a begging tour to 
the Middle East. Both were a failure. 
Both were a waste. Both were an em-
barrassment to the United States. 
That is delusional Democrat diplo-
macy for you. 
Gas prices are still a dollar and a half 
a gallon higher since the day Joe Biden 
became President. Earlier this sum-
mer, people were actually driving less 
than they did in the summer of 2020, 
during the peak of the pandemic, dur-
ing the lockdown. That is why prices 
have dropped for gas. 
But prices for everything else have 
gone up so high that people are still 
hurting all across the country, and we 
have Democrat policies and Democrat 
spending to thank for it. 
People can’t afford to drive. They 
can’t afford to stay home either. That 
is because natural gas prices have more 
than doubled since Joe Biden took of-
fice. 
Well, half of American homes are 
powered by natural gas. One expert 
predicted utility bills could jump 40 
percent just this year. 
Already, more than 20 million Ameri-
cans have fallen behind on paying their 
electric bills because they don’t have 
the money. This is another record. In 
total, the American people owe more 
than $16 billion in unpaid electric bills. 
That is nearly double the amount they 
owed before the pandemic. 
So you have 20 million Americans 
facing the possibility of having their 
power shut off. This is a moment of 
anxiety and anguish for families, and it 
is caused by the policies of the Biden 
administration. 
Democrats think everything is fine 
because they just passed what they 
tout as the largest climate bill in his-
tory. I would expect to see the Sec-
retary of Energy up there on the stage 
leading the cheers: Rah, rah. Look 
what we have just done. 
They don’t care about affordability, 
availability, the reliability of energy. 
Oh, no, they are focused on something 
very different. 
So in about 15 minutes, Democrats 
are throwing themselves a party at the 
White House to celebrate—to celebrate 
a bill that is not going to bring down 
inflation. Oh, no, no, it is going to 
raise it. 
And it is not going to bring down the 
temperature either. According to one 
estimate, it will only reduce global 
warming by—I want to make sure I 
have this right—0.0009 degrees. The 
most expensive climate bill in history, 
taking our Nation from energy domi-
nant to energy dependent, for 0.0009 de-
grees. 
And the centerpiece of this law is, of 
course, the $300 billion slush fund. 
People say: What is it for? 
Well, it is going to give taxpayer dol-
lars to well-connected Silicon Valley 
elites. That is what it is going to do. It 
is going to be given to them so that so- 
called clean energy startup companies 
can do things with it. Supposedly, they 
are going to spend it on new forms of 
energy. We will see. 
If it sounds familiar, it is because 
Democrats tried this the last time Joe 
Biden was in the White House, as Vice 
President. The Obama administration 
spent $90 billion on a similar program. 
So this one is over three times as large. 
Who was in charge of running that 
failed program at the White House 
back in the Obama administration? 
Well, it is the guy in the White House 
today. Joe Biden was in charge of run-
ning it, and what was the end result? It 
was a national embarrassment. It was 
a disaster. Ninety percent of the jobs 
that Joe Biden promised America back 
then never materialized—not at all. 
According to Bloomberg, Democrats 
spent over $725,000 for each job that ul-
timately materialized. And, again, it 
wasn’t Democrats’ money that they 
were spending. It was taxpayer money. 
Most famously, Democrats gave half 
a billion dollars to a company called 
Solyndra. They became a laughing 
stock in the news and late-night com-
edy. They were supposed to make solar 
panels. Two years later, Solyndra went 
bankrupt. The taxpayer money was 
gone, all to waste. And now the Demo-
crats are saying: Let’s go back to that 
same playbook and let’s just reload 
with cash. Load up the money cannon 
and fire away. 
At a much bigger scale this time, in-
stead of $90 billion last time, it is $300 
billion this time. 
Democrats have also just gone on and 
extended another giveaway for people 
buying electric vehicles. Now, many of 
them are high earners, there is no 
question about it. At a time of record 
inflation, Democrats are robbing the 
middle class to give the money to the 
rich. Three out of four electric vehicle 
owners make over $100,000 a year. It is 
not just unfair; it is unsustainable be-
cause electric vehicle prices are soar-
ing right now. 
The average price is now $66,000 for 
each electric vehicle, and, I will tell

September 13, 2022 
you, it is funny. The price of electric 
vehicles rose by $8,000 per vehicle just 
recently, just a couple of weeks ago, 
just as soon as the Democrats crammed 
through their new giveaway. 
And what was the giveaway—7,500? 
And the price of electric vehicles went 
up by $8,000? Do you think that is a co-
incidence? I ask the body. Is that a co-
incidence, that the price goes up by 
8,000 the day that government passes a 
bill to give a $7,500 subsidy? 
And, of course, to make matters 
worse, there is a shortage of batteries 
that are needed to kind of produce the 
electric vehicles to receive the subsidy. 
There aren’t enough charging stations. 
Electric vehicle technology is not 
ready for prime time. The only reason 
electric vehicles are on the road today 
is because of massive government give-
aways. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be 
able to compete. 
Sometimes it is said a picture is 
worth 1,000 words. Here is a picture of 
West Virginia coal miners. West Vir-
ginia coal miners right here. What are 
they doing? They are pushing an elec-
tric vehicle that has run out of power. 
They have run out of electricity, and 
they are trying to push an electric ve-
hicle. These coal miners, with coal 
under attack by this administration, 
they are pushing the electric vehicle to 
a place the vehicle can plug in. 
Well, you know, the people of West 
Virginia say: How did they get there? 
Well, you might see down here that 
this is a Washington, DC, license plate. 
The vehicle being pushed by the coal 
miners were tourists from Washington, 
DC, and they ran out of power on the 
road in West Virginia. Fortunately, 
there were still some West Virginia 
coal miners nearby who were willing to 
lend a helping hand. 
This electric vehicle was pushed by 
coal miners and then recharged by 
electricity generated by West Virginia 
coal—coal, public enemy No. 1, accord-
ing to the Democrats. 
Where do Democrats believe the elec-
tricity comes from to power electric 
vehicles? Electric vehicles are charged 
on the power grid. Nearly two-thirds of 
that energy is still fossil fuels. It is 
still traditional energy. 
The extreme climate policies the 
Democrats are pushing are delusional. 
Yet Democrats are imposing these de-
lusions on tens of millions of people. 
Last month, the State of California 
announced a couple things. It an-
nounced that it is going to require all 
new cars sold in the State to be elec-
tric by 2035. Secretary of Energy 
Granholm gave it a big stamp of ap-
proval. She said it is the model for the 
rest of the country. 
Just days later, California began ex-
periencing blackouts. This is what Sec-
retary Granholm says is the model for 
the rest of the Nation. This is the path 
to the future, she says. 
Joe Biden is giving a speech tomor-
row on electric vehicles. I am sure he is 
going to endorse what they did in Cali-
fornia. No matter what Joe Biden says, 
the painful truth is this: California is 
mandating electric vehicles when their 
electric grid already can’t keep up 
today. 
In California, gas costs more than $5 
a gallon. Meanwhile, you are not even 
allowed to charge your electric vehicle 
for much of the day—not allowed to 
charge it. You have got to buy one, but 
you can’t charge it—what a solution. 
Oh, and you can’t turn your thermo-
stat below 78 degrees in a heat wave. 
The mandates are coming out for 
people who live in this mandate soci-
ety, where California is leading the 
way and the Democrat Secretary of En-
ergy says is the future we should look 
forward to. If the Democrats remain in 
charge, I believe this is an ugly glimpse 
at America’s energy future. 
Now, 
maybe 
Governor 
Newsom 
thinks he can run a modern economy 
this way in California, but it takes en-
ergy to run a modern economy. It 
takes affordable energy, reliable en-
ergy, available energy, and that means 
traditional forms of energy. 
Now, Warren Buffet is known as one 
of the best investors in history. So 
what is he investing in today? Well, he 
is buying an American oil company. 
Why? Because in contrast to the left-
wing fantasies, oil isn’t going away 
anytime soon. 
Renewable energy cannot yet meet 
demand. Only traditional energy can. 
It is simply a fact. Whether the envi-
ronmental extremists partying at the 
White House today like it or not, these 
are the facts of life. There is still an 
enormous difference between renewable 
energy and reliable energy. There sim-
ply is no renewable energy that, all in, 
is cost competitive with oil, gas, or 
coal. 
But Democrats are doubling down on 
expensive energy and waging war on af-
fordable energy at a time when infla-
tion continues to soar—record high in-
flation, 40-year highs—and the impacts 
on American families have been pun-
ishing and painful. 
In Colorado, the local utility com-
pany actually took control over peo-
ple’s thermostats. You wouldn’t think 
they could do that? The capacity is 
there to do it today. And why? Because 
of what they describe as an energy 
emergency. It was an unprecedented in-
trusion into the homes of 22,000 people. 
If Democrats remain in charge, this 
is another glimpse of our energy future 
and of our freedom and independence— 
more blackouts, more restrictions on 
energy production, more restrictions 
on energy use, more price hikes, all in 
service of their climate religion. 
And as one of the headlines in the 
New York Times said last week, ‘‘Cali-
fornia muddles through another day.’’ 
Joe Biden needs to reverse course. We 
are a country that doesn’t want to 
muddle through anything. 
The Democratic Party needs to re-
verse course unless we are looking at 
that kind of a future. This energy cri-
sis is a crisis of Joe Biden’s choosing. 
We have plenty of American energy. 
We have it in the ground. The Demo-
crats won’t let us get it out. All we 
need is for Democrats to get out of the 
way and let us use American energy. 
America’s energy future must be 
powered by American producers. If we 
want available, affordable, reliable, se-
cure energy, we need more American 
energy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALTHCARE 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
understand that there is a lot that is 
going on in the world today. We are 
worried about climate change and what 
that is doing to our planet. We are wor-
ried about the terrible war in Ukraine 
and all of the destruction taking place 
there. We are worried about inflation 
and the fact that wages are not keep-
ing up with the prices that people are 
paying. We are worried about the mas-
sive level of income and wealth in-
equality that exists in our country and 
the increased concentration of owner-
ship that we see in the United States, 
among many, many other things that 
are on people’s minds. But to my mind, 
Madam President, the American people 
remain and always are deeply con-
cerned about an issue that, by defini-
tion, touches each and every one of us, 
and that is our collapsing and dysfunc-
tional healthcare system. 
While it is not discussed much in the 
corporate media or here in the Halls of 
Congress, we have today in the United 
States the most inefficient, bureau-
cratic, and expensive healthcare sys-
tem in the world. And that is not just 
what I believe; that is what the Amer-
ican people know to be true because of 
their 
lived 
experience 
with 
the 
healthcare system. 
Madam President, I would hope that 
all Members of Congress take a hard 
look at a poll that was published yes-
terday by the Associated Press-NORC 
Center for Public Affairs Research, and 
this is some of what the poll disclosed. 
At a time when I hear many of my 
colleagues tell us that we have the best 
healthcare system in the world, it 
turns out that, according to this poll, 
just 12 percent of the American people 
believe that healthcare in general is 
handled very well or extremely well in 
the United States. Twelve percent. 
At a time when we pay the highest 
prices in the world for prescription 
drugs, only 6 percent of the American 
people believe that prescription drug 
costs in the United States are being 
handled well or extremely well. Six 
percent. 
At a time when COVID has exacer-
bated the crisis, only 5 percent of the 
American people believe that the men-
tal health care system in the United

States is being handled well or ex-
tremely well. Five percent. 
When so many older Americans have 
died unnecessarily in nursing homes 
and when so many cannot even find the 
nursing home bed that they need, just 
6 percent of Americans believe that the 
quality of care at nursing homes in the 
United States is very good or excep-
tional. Six percent. 
Madam President, the American peo-
ple increasingly understand, as I do, 
that healthcare is a human right, not a 
privilege, and that we must end the 
international embarrassment of the 
United States of America being the 
only major country on Earth that does 
not guarantee healthcare to all of its 
citizens. Again, that is not just BERNIE 
SANDERS
talking; that is what the 
overwhelming majority of the Amer-
ican people believe. 
According to yesterday’s AP poll, 66 
percent of the American people believe 
it is the Federal Government’s respon-
sibility to make sure that all Ameri-
cans have health insurance coverage. 
Sixty-six percent. 
Over 86 percent of the American peo-
ple believe that it is absurd that mil-
lions of senior citizens lack dental 
care, hearing aids, and vision care, and 
they believe that Medicare should be 
expanded 
to 
cover 
these 
basic 
healthcare needs. It happens to be an 
issue I have been working on for sev-
eral years. Eighty-six percent of the 
American people believe that Medicare 
should cover dental care, hearing aids, 
and vision care. Eighty-six percent. 
At 
a 
time 
when 
our 
long-term 
healthcare system is in shambles, 81 
percent of the American people believe 
that Medicare should cover the out-
rageous cost of long-term healthcare 
for senior citizens and people with dis-
abilities. Eighty-one percent. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
this AP-NORC poll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[Sept. 12, 2022] 
AMERICANS GIVE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
FAILING MARK: AP-NORC POLL 
(By Amanda Seitz) 
WASHINGTON
(AP)—When 
Emmanuel 
Obeng-Dankwa is worried about making rent 
on his New York City apartment, he some-
times holds off on filling his blood pressure 
medication. 
‘‘If there’s no money, I prefer to skip the 
medication to being homeless,’’ said Obeng- 
Dankwa, a 58-year-old security guard. 
He is among a majority of adults in the 
U.S. who say that health care is not handled 
well in the country, according to a new poll 
from The Associated Press-NORC Center for 
Public Affairs Research. 
The poll reveals that public satisfaction 
with the U.S. health care system is remark-
ably low, with fewer than half of Americans 
saying it is generally handled well. Only 12% 
say it is handled extremely or very well. 
Americans have similar views about health 
care for older adults. 
Overall, the public gives even lower marks 
for how prescription drug costs, the quality 
of care at nursing homes and mental health 
care are being handled, with just 6% or less 
saying those health services are done very 
well in the country. 
‘‘Navigating the American health care sys-
tem is exceedingly frustrating,’’ said A. 
Mark Fendrick, the director of the Univer-
sity of Michigan Center for Value-Based In-
surance Design. ‘‘The COVID pandemic has 
only made it worse.’’ 
More than two years after the pandemic’s 
start, health care worker burnout and staff-
ing shortages are plaguing hospitals around 
the country. And Americans are still having 
trouble getting in-person medical care after 
health centers introduced restrictions as 
COVID–19 killed and sickened millions of 
people around the country, Fendrick said. 
In fact, the poll shows an overwhelming 
majority of Americans, nearly 8 in 10, say 
they are at least moderately concerned 
about getting access to quality health care 
when they need it. 
Black and Hispanic adults in particular are 
resoundingly worried about health care ac-
cess, with nearly 6 in 10 saying they are very 
or extremely concerned about getting good 
care. Fewer than half of white adults, 44%, 
expressed the same level of worry. 
Racial 
disparities 
have 
long 
troubled 
America’s health care system. They have 
been abundantly clear during the COVID–19 
pandemic, with Black and Hispanic people 
dying disproportionately from the virus. 
Black and Hispanic men also make up a dis-
proportionately 
high 
rate 
of 
recent 
monkeypox infections. 
Fifty-three percent of women said they are 
extremely or very concerned about obtaining 
quality care, compared to 42% of men. 
While Americans are united in their dis-
satisfaction with the health care system, 
that agreement dissolves when it comes to 
solutions to fix it. 
About two-thirds of adults think it is the 
federal government’s responsibility to make 
sure all Americans have health care cov-
erage, with adults ages 18 to 49 more likely 
than those over 50 to hold that view. The 
percentage of people who believe health care 
coverage is a government responsibility has 
risen in recent years, ticking up from 57% in 
2019 and 62% in 2017. 
Still, there’s not consensus on how that 
coverage might be delivered. 
About 4 in 10 Americans say they support 
a single-payer health care system that would 
require Americans to get their health insur-
ance from a government plan. More, 58%, say 
they favor a government health insurance 
plan that anyone can purchase. 
There also is broad support for policies 
that would help Americans pay for the costs 
of long-term care, including a government- 
administered insurance plan similar to Medi-
care, the federal government’s health insur-
ance for people 65 or older. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, it 
is hard for me to imagine how anyone 
could defend a healthcare system in 
which over 70 million people today are 
either uninsured or underinsured. As 
we speak, this moment, there are mil-
lions of Americans who would like to 
go to a doctor, who need to go to a doc-
tor, but cannot afford to go to a doctor 
because of the outrageous cost of med-
ical care in this country. 
Frankly, I am tired of talking to 
physicians who tell me about the pa-
tients who died—who died—because 
they were uninsured or underinsured 
and who walked into the doctor’s office 
when it was too late. Time and time 
again, I hear from doctors who tell me 
about a patient who walked in, and 
they said to the patient: Why didn’t 
you come in when you first noticed 
your symptoms? 
The patient responded: I don’t have 
the money; I can’t afford the copay-
ment; or I have no insurance at all. 
Madam President, we are talking 
about—and I know we don’t talk about 
it much, and maybe we should—we are 
talking about some 68,000 Americans 
who die every single year because they 
are uninsured or underinsured and 
don’t get the medical care that they 
need. This is the United States, the 
wealthiest country in the history of 
the world; 68,000 Americans should not 
die every year unnecessarily. 
I am tired of seeing working-class 
families and small businesses pay far 
more for healthcare than they can af-
ford, which results in more than 500,000 
Americans every year declaring bank-
ruptcy because of medically related ex-
penses. Half a million Americans de-
clare 
bankruptcy 
because 
of 
out-
rageous healthcare bills they simply 
cannot afford to pay. Families in 
America should not be driven into fi-
nancial ruin because someone in that 
family became seriously ill. Sickness 
should not be a cause of financial ruin. 
I am tired of hearing from Americans 
who lost loved ones because they could 
not afford the unbelievably high cost of 
prescription drugs, and I am tired of 
hearing from constituents who are 
forced to cut their pills in half due to 
the cost. Today, unbelievably, almost 
one out of four patients cannot afford 
the prescription drugs their doctors 
prescribe. 
When you want to talk about an irra-
tional and dysfunctional healthcare 
system, think about a system in which 
people go to a doctor, they get diag-
nosed as to their healthcare problem, 
they get a prescription drug prescribed 
to them, but they can’t afford to buy 
the drug the doctor prescribes. So what 
ends up happening? They end up get-
ting sicker. Maybe they end up in the 
emergency room at an outrageous cost. 
Maybe because they couldn’t afford the 
prescription drugs in the first place, 
they end up in the hospital at a very 
high cost. Maybe they die. That is an 
irrational and absurd healthcare sys-
tem. 
I am tired of talking to people and 
families of people who are struggling 
with mental illness but cannot afford 
the mental health counseling they des-
perately need. Last year, as you know, 
a recordbreaking 100,000 Americans 
died of drug overdoses. And I will tell 
you that in my office—and I am sure 
that in every other Senate office—we 
get desperate calls from family mem-
bers looking for affordable mental 
health counseling. Far too often, that 
care simply is not there in the commu-
nity. 
People are struggling with husbands, 
wives, kids who are on the verge of 
doing something terrible to them-
selves, to others, and yet, in this coun-
try, despite spending far more for

healthcare than any other country, we 
don’t have the capability of helping 
those people. It is not there. The men-
tal health counseling, the help that 
people need is not there because in this 
system, geared toward the profits of 
the insurance companies rather than 
the needs of the American people, we 
don’t have enough psychologists, coun-
selors, or social workers. 
Unbelievably, despite spending far 
more per capita on healthcare than any 
other nation, we don’t even have 
enough doctors. We are facing a major 
doctor shortage in America now, which 
will only get worse in the years to 
come if we don’t address it. We don’t 
have enough nurses. We don’t have 
enough dentists. We don’t have enough 
medical providers in general. We have, 
however, more than enough people who 
bill us and more than enough debt col-
lectors who hound us to pay for a bill 
we cannot afford, but we just don’t 
have enough people to provide the 
healthcare that we desperately need. 
By the way, the crisis of lack of 
healthcare providers is only going to 
get worse as our society continues to 
age. 
At a time of declining life expectancy 
in the wealthiest country on Earth, 
your health and your longevity should 
not be dependent on the amount of 
money you have. It is an absolute out-
rage and grossly un-American that the 
number of years we live in this country 
is dependent upon our income. Studies 
have shown that the top 1 percent of 
Americans live 15 years longer than the 
poorest people in our society. It is not 
only the very top as opposed to the 
very bottom; it is wealthy people in 
general versus working-class people. If 
you got the money, you are going to 
live longer in this country than if you 
do not have the money. 
In my view, healthcare is a human 
right that all Americans, regardless of 
income, are entitled to, and all Ameri-
cans 
deserve 
the 
best 
quality 
healthcare that our country can pro-
vide. 
Further, as chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee, it is not acceptable 
to me that we end up spending over 
twice as much as virtually every other 
major country on Earth per capita— 
twice as much per capita—while our 
life expectancy and other healthcare 
outcomes lag behind most other coun-
tries. This is really quite an amazing 
thing. We spend more; yet our results 
are worse than in other countries, un-
believably. 
According to the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services, we are now 
spending 
$12,530 
per 
capita 
on 
healthcare. Imagine that—over $12,000 
for every man, woman, and child in 
this country. This is, frankly, an out-
rageous and unsustainable sum of 
money. In comparison, the United 
Kingdom spends just $5,300; France 
spends $5,400; Canada, $5,900; Germany, 
$7,300. We spend over $12,000 per year. 
The question that everyone should be 
asking is, How does it happen that we 
spend so much money for healthcare, 
but we get so little in return? 
Let’s be clear. The current debate 
over healthcare in the United States 
really 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
healthcare. Frankly, it is hard to de-
fend this dysfunctional system. The 
healthcare debate has everything to do 
with the unquenchable greed of the 
healthcare industry and their desire to 
maintain a system which fails the av-
erage American but which makes the 
industry huge profits every single year. 
While ordinary Americans struggled to 
pay for healthcare during this pan-
demic, the six largest health insurance 
companies in our country made over 
$60 billion in profits last year, led by 
UnitedHealth Group, which made $24 
billion in 2021. 
While millions of Americans cannot 
afford soaring healthcare costs, the top 
executives in the insurance industry 
receive huge amounts of compensation. 
In 2020—remember, 70 million unin-
sured and underinsured and 68,000 dying 
every year because they don’t get to a 
doctor on time—the CEOs of 178 major 
healthcare 
companies 
collectively 
made $3.2 billion in total compensa-
tion—up 31 percent from the previous 
year—all in the midst of the pandemic. 
People were dying every single day, 
and the cost of healthcare was soaring; 
yet the CEOs saw a 31-percent increase 
in their compensation. According to 
Axios, in 2020, the CEO of Cigna, David 
Cordani, took home $79 million in com-
pensation. The CEO of Centene, Mr. 
Neidorff, made $59 million. The CEO of 
UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Wichmann, 
received $42 million in total compensa-
tion. 
But it is not just the health insur-
ance companies that are ripping off the 
American people; it is the drug compa-
nies as well. In terms of the pharma-
ceutical industry, last year, Pfizer, 
Johnson & Johnson, and AbbVie—three 
giant pharmaceutical companies—in-
creased their profits by over 90 percent 
to $54 billion. How is it that, in the 
midst of a pandemic, during which we 
lost over a million people and millions 
and millions of people have become 
sick, the profits of the major drug com-
panies went up by over 90 percent? 
The CEO of Moderna got a $926 mil-
lion golden parachute after his com-
pany received $2.5 billion in taxpayer 
dollars to develop the vaccine. We all 
appreciate the development of the vac-
cine, which is saving lives every day. 
But, really, does the CEO of the com-
pany that received $2.5 billion of tax-
payer money deserve a $926 million 
golden parachute? That is an indica-
tion, a manifestation, of a sick and 
broken healthcare system. And while 
over 330,000 Americans died during the 
pandemic because they could not afford 
to go to a doctor on time, the CEO of 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals made over 
$450 million in total compensation. 
The current system is failing the 
American people, and the American 
people want change—real change. 
In March, a few months ago, I was 
pleased to introduce Medicare for All 
legislation, with 15 Senate cosponsors. 
Companion legislation in the House 
now has 122 cosponsors. This legisla-
tion would improve and expand Medi-
care to cover, over a 4-year period, 
healthcare to every man, woman, and 
child in this country. In other words, 
what this legislation finally does is 
make sure that the United States joins 
every other major country and that we 
guarantee healthcare to all of our peo-
ple. 
This legislation is comprehensive, 
and it would end out-of-pocket ex-
penses. Unlike the current system, it 
would provide full freedom of choice re-
garding healthcare providers. In other 
words, under Medicare for All, there 
would no longer be insurance pre-
miums, deductibles, or copayments, 
and no more networks which deny you 
your choice of doctors. And, when I 
talk about Medicare for All being com-
prehensive, it would cover dental care, 
vision, hearing aids, prescription drugs, 
and home- and community-based care. 
In other words, it would do precisely 
what the American people want us to 
do. 
Would a Medicare for All system be 
expensive? Yes, but while providing 
comprehensive care for all, it would be 
significantly less expensive than our 
current dysfunctional system because 
it 
would 
eliminate 
an 
enormous 
amount of the bureaucracy, profit-
eering, administrative costs, and mis-
placed priorities inherent in our cur-
rent for-profit system. 
Remember, we currently pay twice as 
much for healthcare as do the people of 
virtually any other country, and all of 
those countries manage to provide uni-
versal healthcare. So, yes, we can pro-
vide quality care for all at a much, 
much lower cost per person. 
Under Medicare for All, there would 
no longer be armies of people billing 
us, telling us what is covered and what 
is not covered, and hounding us to pay 
our hospital bills. This not only saves 
substantial sums of money but will 
make life a lot easier for the American 
people, who would never again have to 
fight their way through the nightmare 
of insurance company bureaucracy. In 
fact, the Congressional Budget Office, 
the CBO, estimated that Medicare for 
All would save Americans $650 billion a 
year. 
Now, trust me. I do know the 30-sec-
ond ads from the insurance and drug 
companies that have told us that if 
Medicare for All becomes law, your 
taxes will go up. What they forgot to 
tell you is that, under Medicare for All, 
you will no longer be paying premiums, 
deductibles, copayments, and out-of- 
pocket expenses to private health in-
surance companies. What they cer-
tainly won’t tell you is that Medicare 
for All will save—save—the average 
American family thousands of dollars a 
year. In fact, a study by RAND found 
that moving to a Medicare for All sys-
tem would save a family with an in-
come of less than $185,000 about $3,000 a 
year on average.

Now, one might ask, fair enough: If 
Medicare for All is so good, if it has so 
many advantages, if it is what the 
American people want, why hasn’t it 
been enacted by now? Why hasn’t the 
United States joined every other major 
country in guaranteeing healthcare for 
all? 
That takes us to our corrupt political 
system and the outrageous way we 
fund campaigns. So I would suggest if 
you want to know why we are stuck 
with a dysfunctional healthcare system 
that fails the American people but that 
makes the drug companies and the in-
surance companies wildly profitable, 
follow the money. Follow the money. 
Since 1998, in our corrupt political 
system, the private healthcare sector 
has spent more than $10 billion on lob-
bying. Got that? More than $10 billion 
on lobbying since 1998. Over the last 30 
years, it has spent more than $1.7 bil-
lion on campaign contributions to 
maintain the status quo. 
In terms of their lobbying efforts, 
let’s be clear. They are very, very bi-
partisan. There are former Democratic 
Party leaders and former Republican 
Party leaders who are working to-
gether to represent the insurance com-
panies and the drug companies. 
And, by the way, of course, in terms 
of the campaign contributions, the in-
surance companies and the drug com-
panies are also very bipartisan. In fact, 
their contributions go to many Mem-
bers of both the Democratic and Re-
publican Parties. It doesn’t really mat-
ter if you are a Democrat or a Repub-
lican; what matters is you protect the 
interests of the drug companies and the 
insurance companies. 
But, you know, what I believe is that 
maybe, just maybe, now is the time for 
Congress to do what the American peo-
ple want—not what the lobbyists want, 
not what the drug companies want, not 
what the insurance companies want. 
And maybe, just maybe, we should 
have the courage to take on the power-
ful special interests that dominate 
healthcare in the United States. And 
maybe, just maybe, now is the time to 
provide 
healthcare 
to 
every 
man, 
woman, and child as a human right by 
passing a Medicare for All, single-payer 
program. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, 
agriculture is a critical part of Nebras-
ka’s economy. It accounts for, roughly, 
$25.7 billion of Nebraska’s gross State 
product. That is a little less than a 
quarter of our State’s overall GDP. 
Nearly one in four jobs in the State is 
tied to agriculture. 
That economic output is important 
because, thanks to States like Ne-
braska, hard-working family farmers 
and ranchers produce a wide variety of 
products that keep our grocery stores 
stocked and help to feed the world. But 
our 
Nation’s 
agricultural 
bounty 
doesn’t do anyone much good if it can’t 
get to market, and that is where our 
complex transportation and infrastruc-
ture system comes into play. 
The railroad industry, in particular, 
has a big role in bringing agricultural 
products to locations across the United 
States. That includes ports, where they 
can then be shipped to locations 
around the world. Whether it is grain 
or soybeans, railroads provide the 
means to affordably move thousands of 
tons of goods where they need to go. It 
is estimated that rail delivers 1.6 mil-
lion carloads of agricultural products a 
year. That is why I am deeply con-
cerned about the potential for a rail 
shutdown later this week. 
I think it is very important that peo-
ple understand what kind of economic 
impact such as a shutdown would have 
and how it would upend our Nation’s 
agricultural sector. The consequences 
would be devastating. When agricul-
tural products can’t be transported, 
there will be price hikes, and there will 
be shortages. Our international exports 
of commodities like corn, soy, wheat, 
of which a large share moves by rail, 
will fall dramatically. 
Fertilizer prices—an already expen-
sive input due to inflation—will further 
skyrocket. The mere prospect of a 
shutdown on Friday means fertilizer 
and other hazardous materials have al-
ready started being removed from the 
rail networks on September 12. Biofuel 
plants could be forced to scale down op-
erations or completely shut down. 
I would also point out that we have 
harvest coming up in Nebraska. Family 
farmers in my State, many of whom 
are grappling with rapidly rising input 
costs, need a good harvest season. And 
if rail service isn’t feasible, that possi-
bility could go out the window. 
Grain elevators, for example, could 
run out of storage and be unable to ac-
cept additional commodities. Family 
farmers and ranchers will lose critical 
revenue streams. 
The bottom line is, if rail shuts 
down, our entire agricultural system 
shuts down. It is that simple. 
All of this economic chaos would 
come on top of extreme inflation. To-
day’s numbers put grocery prices up 
13.5 percent over last year. Think 
about the toll this out-of-control infla-
tion is taking on our working-class 
families. 
Then there is the international tur-
moil. Russia’s horrific invasion of 
Ukraine has dramatically curtailed the 
flow of grain, which, in turn, has exas-
perated food insecurity in Africa and 
the Middle East. And the war has also 
further strained the fertilizer supply 
chain. All of this is to say that the 
stakes 
of 
these 
rail 
negotiations 
couldn’t be higher. 
Nine of the twelve labor unions in 
the rail sector have been able to utilize 
the Presidential Emergency Board rec-
ommendations to come to an agree-
ment. I note that the Board is com-
posed of neutral, impartial individuals 
appointed by President Biden. Their 
recommendations are widely seen as 
benefiting all parties. It is critical that 
the remaining labor unions and the rail 
industry use those recommendations to 
reach an agreement as soon as possible. 
Our entire agricultural system is at 
stake here, the economic welfare of the 
American people is at stake here, and 
the global food security is also at stake 
here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
there are a lot of important things that 
we do here in the U.S. Senate, hope-
fully, every day; certainly, every week, 
month, and over the year. But there 
are a couple of pieces of legislation 
which are literally must-pass pieces of 
legislation. They deserve an even high-
er priority than our day-to-day work 
here. These must-pass pieces of legisla-
tion are critical to the function of our 
government. 
First, for example, government fund-
ing is critical so we can keep the lights 
on and keep the government working 
on behalf of the American people. If 
Congress fails to pass an appropria-
tions bill, the government will literally 
shut down and millions of government 
workers will be left without a pay-
check and the American people will be 
left without the services that those 
government employees would other-
wise provide. 
The good news is, at this moment, 
there appears to be little appetite for a 
funding fiasco at the end of this fiscal 
year at the end of this month. In a cou-
ple of weeks, I expect we will vote on a 
stopgap funding bill to keep the lights 
on and the trains moving until the end 
of the year. 
Continuing 
resolutions 
like 
this, 
leading up to an end-of-the-year omni-
bus appropriations bill, are never my 
first choice. My hope would be that we 
would take up and pass each of the in-
dividual appropriations bills on a time-
ly basis and then bring them across the 
floor of the U.S. Senate, pass them, and 
get them to the President for his signa-
ture. But, unfortunately, that hasn’t 
happened under the current manage-
ment. 
There are other bills that receive the 
‘‘must-pass’’ label. These could be any-
thing from farm bills to disaster relief. 
Each of these are important. But, in 
my view, the ultimate must-pass piece 
of legislation is the National Defense 
Authorization Act. 
Each year, this is how we make sure 
that our men and women in uniform 
have the support and the tools and the 
training they need and the pay to com-
pensate them for their service as well 
as the support their families deserve, 
which is particularly important in an 
All-Volunteer military. This is how we 
maintain our military bases, modernize 
our weapons systems, and invest in the 
next generation of weapons. 
It is how we take stock of the global 
threat landscape, which always seems

September 13, 2022 
like it is getting more and more omi-
nous, and we make sure that our coun-
try is prepared to counter even our 
most aggressive adversaries. 
That is why Congress has passed a 
consolidated defense authorization bill 
for each of the past 61 years. For 61 
years in a row, we passed a national de-
fense authorization bill. But, appar-
ently, the majority leader, Senator 
SCHUMER, is contemplating not doing 
that this year. 
A strong and ontime defense author-
ization act has always been crucial, but 
this particular moment in history de-
mands even greater attention. 
As we know, on February 24—nearly 7 
months 
ago—Russia 
launched 
an 
unprovoked 
war 
against 
Ukraine. 
Thankfully, the civilized world has ral-
lied around Ukraine, supplying it with 
the tools and weapons they need not 
only to fight but to win this war. 
At the same time, we know thou-
sands of miles away, the Chinese Com-
munist Party and the People’s Repub-
lic of China have become increasingly 
hostile to the West and desperate to 
project its military power. It con-
tinues, at the same time, to commit 
genocide against the Uighurs and other 
ethnic minorities, and it is likely pre-
paring an invasion of Taiwan. 
North Korea has declared itself to be 
a nuclear weapons state. Iran is pur-
suing its own nuclear ambitions and a 
breakout for those nuclear weapons, 
which is the point when they actually 
acquire one. It is getting closer every 
day. 
We know after the disastrous with-
drawal from Afghanistan that the 
Taliban, which once gave nurture to al- 
Qaida and Osama bin Laden, attacked 
the Twin Towers and the Pentagon on 
September 11, 2001. 
And, of course, the political insta-
bility from the disastrous means or 
method by which we withdrew from Af-
ghanistan, literally turning over bil-
lions of dollars to the Taliban and 
weapons that they never would have 
otherwise been able to acquire, has cre-
ated a tremendous amount of insta-
bility in the region, where already 
Pakistan and India warily eye each 
other, both of whom are nuclear pow-
ers. 
So given the walk around the globe 
and the identification of these mul-
titude of threats, you would think that 
passing a defense authorization act 
would be the highest priority for the 
U.S. Congress and particularly the Sen-
ate. 
If you think about it, all of the free-
doms and the standard of living, the 
quality of life we enjoy in this country, 
our prosperity, are all directly related 
to our ability to keep our country safe 
and keep the American people safe. 
That should be our No. 1 priority. 
But the truth is, we can’t match 
these stakes. We can’t rise to this de-
mand and this need with continuing 
resolutions and past-due authoriza-
tions. 
Our men and women in uniform need 
to prepare and train every day, 365 days 
a year. And if we don’t pass a defense 
authorization act now, we will be steal-
ing time that we already don’t have. 
General MacArthur, who became fa-
mous in the Korean war, said the his-
tory of failure in war can be summed 
up in two words: ‘‘too late’’—too late. 
Now, our colleagues on the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, on a bipar-
tisan basis, under the leadership of 
Senator REED, a Democrat, and Sen-
ator INHOFE, a Republican, have com-
piled a strong bill that would strength-
en and modernize our national defense. 
But the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee completed its work on July 18. 
Here we are, September 13. 
Senator SCHUMER, the one who sets 
the agenda for the U.S. Senate, has yet 
to bring that bill to the floor. Of all of 
the must-pass bills that I hear dis-
cussed in the media and among our col-
leagues, 
rarely 
are 
people 
talking 
about the Defense authorization bill. 
The Presiding Officer succeeded John 
McCain in the U.S. Senate. John 
McCain was, of course, not only a war 
hero; he was a proud patriot. And he 
was a bear of a man to deal with. But 
I dare say, if John McCain were alive 
today, we would be on a defense au-
thorization bill before we break for the 
midterm elections because he would 
not let anyone rest if we broke or 
threatened to break that 61-year con-
sistent threat of meeting that No. 1 
priority obligation. 
I was hoping that the Senate would 
consider the Defense authorization bill 
this month and give our planners at 
the Pentagon and our commanders the 
predictability they need, as well as our 
military families the support that they 
deserve and need, not to mention our 
men and women who are on the 
frontlines fighting to protect our coun-
try, the tools and the training they 
need in order to do their job. I was op-
timistic that given the clear and 
present danger of the situation we are 
living through now, the threat land-
scape, and the desire to show our bipar-
tisan support for our military, that we 
would, naturally, make this the 62nd 
year consecutively to pass the Defense 
authorization bill. 
The only other must-pass item on the 
Senate’s to-do list this month is to 
keep the government funded, and the 
Democratic majority has already com-
mitted to the short-term extension 
until the middle of December. So there 
is just no excuse for putting off the an-
nual Defense bill. But for some reason, 
to this point, Senator SCHUMER, the 
Senate majority leader who sets the 
agenda in the Senate, does not seem to 
agree that is an urgent, must-pass 
piece of legislation. 
I know there is bipartisan support to 
encourage him to bring this bill up, but 
so far he hasn’t been swayed. The De-
fense authorization bill seems to be at 
the bottom of his priority list, below 
judicial nominations and a bill to cod-
ify a right to marry that is not even in 
jeopardy. 
Given everything that is going on in 
the world, there is simply no reason to 
delay consideration of the Defense au-
thorization bill. In fact, there is every 
reason to do it on time and for the 62nd 
consecutive year. 
We all know that American strength 
and leadership are vital to global secu-
rity and equally vital to protecting our 
homeland. The Senate simply should 
not ignore its responsibility when it 
comes to our readiness. 
Now, one of the things that concerns 
me the most, because he is not talking 
about this being a priority, is that he 
will try to stick this Defense author-
ization bill on an appropriations bill at 
the end of the year, sort of as a clean-
up, but if he does that, he will effec-
tively deny Senators floor time to offer 
debate and to actually have votes on 
the bill and how to improve it. 
One amendment I intend to offer if 
given the opportunity is a bill I intro-
duced with Senator SHAHEEN from New 
Hampshire which would help replenish 
our defense stockpiles. 
As we all know by now, the United 
States has provided Ukraine unprece-
dented defense aid—Stingers, Javelins, 
grenade launchers, small arms, ammu-
nition, and so much more. This assist-
ance is not a handout. This is not a 
charity project. As much as we want to 
see Ukraine prevail, our material sup-
port for Ukraine is not entirely altru-
istic. The United States isn’t just in-
vesting in a Ukrainian victory; we are 
also putting our resources toward a 
Russian defeat. We are trying to help 
snuff out the fire before it spreads even 
further west. We know what Mr. 
Putin’s aspirations are; it is to restore 
the great Russian Empire that existed 
when the Soviet Union existed. 
We know that there is a delicate bal-
ance to strike here. Our support for 
Ukraine cannot come, should not come 
at the cost of our own military readi-
ness. And we have requirements way 
beyond just Ukraine, as I mentioned 
earlier—the 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China, North Korea, Iran. 
The United States is a global power, 
and we have to be ready whenever and 
wherever the threat arises. We have to 
be able to replenish our weapons stock-
piles quickly so we are ready whatever 
may come our way. Unfortunately, 
there are a lot of bureaucratic hurdles 
in the way. 
I was shocked when I saw that the 
Pentagon is not in a position to replace 
the Javelins and Stinger missiles that 
we provided Ukraine because they 
don’t have an operating production 
line, and they said it may take a cou-
ple of years. I know that our friends 
and allies in Europe that are providing 
weapons to the Ukrainians have every 
expectation that the United States will 
replenish those stockpiles of weapons 
so that they can defend their country 
and meet their NATO obligations. 
So the level of unreadiness at the 
Pentagon to meet the current need is 
shocking. 
The 
Defense 
Department 
can’t place an order for more Javelins 
and then have them show up at the 
Pentagon 5 to 7 business days later. It

September 13, 2022 
simply doesn’t work like that. The 
process of purchasing, manufacturing, 
and deploying this lethal aid takes a 
lot of time, which, to be frank, we do 
not have. 
Senator SHAHEEN and I have recently 
introduced a bipartisan bill called the 
Securing American ARMS Act to re-
move some of the hurdles and the bu-
reaucratic delay in replenishing those 
stockpiles. It will give the Department 
of Defense the ability to fast-track the 
procurement process. That includes 
times like these when the United 
States is providing defense articles to 
an ally or a partner that is under 
armed attack by a U.S. adversary. 
Our bill would also give the Defense 
Department the ability to expedite the 
delivery of defense articles to our allies 
and partners in need. This will allow us 
to continue to provide critical support 
to Ukraine—but not just limited to 
Ukraine—all 
without 
compromising 
our national defense or our ability to 
meet other obligations around the 
world. 
I appreciate Senator SHAHEEN work-
ing with me on this bill, which now has 
more than a dozen bipartisan cospon-
sors. 
When the Senate finally begins con-
sideration of the Defense Authorization 
Act, I hope this legislation will be a 
part of it. At the same time, as a mem-
ber of the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence, I am hopeful we can also 
reauthorize the U.S. intelligence com-
munity, which usually takes a ride on 
the Defense Authorization Act. 
The hard-working men and women of 
the intelligence community carry out 
missions day in and day out that in-
form key policy decisions and the work 
of the U.S. military. Of course, being 
intelligence operators, their work is 
not acknowledged necessarily like a 
member of our uniformed services, but 
their service is vital to our missions 
and our interests around the world. 
One great example of the role the in-
telligence community played in the 
runup to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
was that our intelligence community 
was able to provide skeptical allies 
with irrefutable proof of Russia’s in-
tentions and showed exactly what Rus-
sia was planning before February 24. I 
have no doubt that this intelligence 
contributed to the unified response in 
the days and weeks following. And we 
engaged in enhanced information and 
intelligence sharing on a real-time 
basis that I think has helped facilitate 
Ukraine’s strong national defense and 
now counteroffensive that they are 
currently engaged in, trying to recap-
ture some of their territory that Rus-
sia has previously occupied. 
I want to particularly recognize the 
chairman and the ranking member of 
the Senate Intelligence Committee— 
Senator WARNER, a Democrat from Vir-
ginia, and Senator RUBIO, a Republican 
from Florida—for their leadership in 
helping us pass the Intelligence Au-
thorization Act unanimously in July. 
Like other authorization bills, this 
outlines funding levels for the intel-
ligence community, but it also con-
tains legislative oversight of America’s 
intelligence apparatus. 
Strong oversight is crucial to ensur-
ing accountability, while enabling our 
intelligence professionals to accom-
plish the complex and difficult mis-
sions the American people demand of 
them. With the ongoing war in Ukraine 
and threats from China continuing to 
grow, we need intelligence at the speed 
of relevance. This is how we help as-
sure everyone, from our policymakers 
to our warfighters, that we will have 
the tools to maintain America’s pre-
eminent global position and ensure the 
defense of our homeland. 
I appreciate the hard work of Senator 
RUBIO and Senator WARNER to advance 
this reauthorization, and again, I hope, 
when we take up the Defense Author-
ization Act at some point, that it will 
be included. 
So, Madam President, let me just 
conclude where I started. The National 
Defense Authorization Act is a must- 
pass piece of legislation. We have 
passed it for 61 years in a row. Yet, 
when I hear Senator SCHUMER, the ma-
jority leader, talk about things we 
need to do before the midterm elec-
tions, I don’t hear a peep out of him on 
his intention to move that Defense Au-
thorization Act. 
Providing for the common defense is 
one of Congress’s most basic respon-
sibilities. If we can’t keep the Amer-
ican people and our democracy safe, we 
will have failed in our first and most 
urgent duty. There is far too much at 
stake to let the NDAA linger on the 
Senate calendar for more months. So 
my hope is that the majority leader 
will bring this bill to the floor this 
month and provide Senators who are 
not on the Armed Services Committee 
an opportunity to participate in the 
process 
by 
debating 
and 
offering 
amendments like the one I described 
earlier so we can strengthen our na-
tional defense at this critical moment 
in our Nation’s history. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
HIGHER EDUCATION 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, what a great time of the year— 
county fairs, State fairs. The weather 
is changing. People are getting outside 
more. It is not quite as hot in most 
places. Parents have smiles on their 
faces because their kids are going back 
to school. College is starting up. 
That is what I want to talk about 
today. 
Our 
college 
campuses 
are 
ramping up. There are a lot of good 
things going on with that. A lot of 
young people are for the first time 
going to college, going out for the first 
time in their lives and making their 
own decisions, away from home for the 
first time, putting their budgets to-
gether, having to go by their own time 
with nobody to wake them up, having 
to wash their own clothes, having to do 
things they have never had to do be-
fore. For the first time in their lives, 
they are responsible for themselves 24 
hours a day. 
I did that for 40 years coaching col-
lege football, coaching high school 
football. It was amazing how many 
young men and women whom I worked 
with never saw the Sun come up in 
their lives. If they played for me, they 
got to see the Sun come up. We got up 
early and stayed late. 
So it is an important time for all of 
our young adults in college, K–12—very 
important—for our high school, ele-
mentary, and junior high school kids. 
For many, many years, it has been an 
important part of all of our lives in the 
United States of America, and it has 
been one point that has made us better 
than everybody across the world in 
terms of education. We educate our 
young people from K–12. Everybody has 
an opportunity to go to college for an 
extended education. It is a great oppor-
tunity. It is fun to watch. I had a 
chance to watch a lot of young people 
have some great opportunities and 
make a lot of things out of themselves. 
I used to tell my players when I 
coached that you are living in the 
greatest country on the face of the 
Earth. If you are born in this country, 
you hit the lottery. A lot of people 
don’t understand that. If you go to 
some of these other countries, you will 
figure it out real quick. But the United 
States of America, this country, really 
owes you nothing other than one thing: 
It owes you an opportunity—an oppor-
tunity to do what the heck you want to 
do or be who you want to be. If you 
work hard, you might have a chance. A 
lot of times, you are going to get 
knocked down. Do you know what this 
country does? It gives you a chance to 
get back on your feet and go again. It 
doesn’t owe you one thing other than 
that. If you take advantage of it, you 
can achieve it. 
For many years, institutions of high-
er education were great examples of 
the great American experiment. They 
were places where free speech was not 
only allowed but encouraged, and inno-
vation and problem-solving were re-
quired for success. Success created 
some of America’s favorite pastimes. 
College sports, which have become a 
piece of our national identity, started a 
couple of weeks ago. They have im-
mense benefits for young men and 
women who get involved in sports. But 
higher education became the envy of 
the world, as I said earlier. Our col-
leges and universities produced new re-
search, technologies, and medicines 
and molded the talent and the talented 
minds to use these new developments 
that make our country a better place 
and make our country No. 1. 
But this trend, I hate to say, is 
changing. Activists have fundamen-
tally shifted higher education to be-
come a vehicle to further their polit-
ical agenda, and now they are set on 
forcing American taxpayers to pay for 
the overpriced indoctrination and tak-
ing athletic opportunities away from

September 13, 2022 
those who have worked so very hard to 
train and compete. 
Let’s start with the pricetag associ-
ated with higher education. The cost of 
attending college has skyrocketed, but 
these institutions have done little— 
very little—to ensure their value has 
increased along with the increase in 
price, the increase in tuitions. Bloated 
school 
administrations 
continually 
drive budgets and tuitions up, to the 
point where a lot of people can’t afford 
to go to school anymore. 
President Biden recently decided to 
throw gasoline on this fire by attempt-
ing to use Executive authority to, as 
he calls it, forgive student loan debt 
for millions of Americans. His plan will 
forgive up to $20,000 in student loan 
debt for Pell grant recipients who 
make $125,000 a year or less and $10,000 
in student loan debt for all those under 
the same salary cap. 
Think about that. A college-educated 
person 
making 
a 
six-figure 
salary 
would essentially get a $10,000 handout 
from hard-working Americans, the ma-
jority of whom did not go to college 
themselves and are struggling to pro-
vide for their families thanks to soar-
ing inflation driven by our comrades on 
the left, Democrats’ reckless spending 
in the last 2 years. 
Despite the administration’s attempt 
to convince the country that they are 
focused on fighting inflation, this debt 
transfer scheme will do exactly the op-
posite. It is going to make prices high-
er. In fact, the Penn Wharton budget 
model projects the total cost of Presi-
dent Biden’s loan forgiveness plan and 
changes to the other loan programs 
could cost the American people more 
than $1 trillion. 
Folks on both sides of the aisle have 
rightfully criticized this plan because 
of its clear and indefensible cost, and I 
share those concerns with everybody 
that is against this. 
I am also concerned about two addi-
tional long-term effects of this deci-
sion. One, it does nothing to fix the 
broken system that led to soaring costs 
of college in the first place. It will, in 
fact, make college even more expen-
sive. If we are going to do something, 
let’s fix the problem. We are not fixing 
the problem. We are just adding to the 
problem. And, two, it allows students 
and 
graduates 
to 
avoid 
the 
con-
sequences of their own actions, further 
hindering young people from becoming 
independent, free thinking, and respon-
sible. The thing about education is 
learning responsibility, and this does 
exactly the opposite of teaching re-
sponsibility at a level where they need 
to learn. 
All Americans, including those who, 
like me, chose to take on debt attend-
ing college must be responsible for 
their own actions. Hard-working tax-
payers who did not go to college should 
not have to assume the debt of others 
because this administration decided to 
fulfill a campaign promise right before 
a midterm election. 
Further, this degradation of the 
value of college is just the latest in a 
decades-long effort by those on the left 
to fundamentally change higher edu-
cation and force their agenda on cam-
puses across our country, and it comes 
right after this administration an-
nounced its plan to attack another key 
part of the American system—athletic 
competition and the level playing field 
created by title IX. 
I began my career coaching high 
school a long time ago. But before 
that, title IX was created in supporting 
women athletics. I started coaching a 
few years after title IX was started, 
and I have seen from the very begin-
ning what title IX has done for women 
across this country—girls and ath-
letes—and how it has made leaders of 
young girls and young women who 
would have never been afforded the op-
portunity had title IX not passed. 
Title IX, to me, is one of the best 
things this Federal Government has 
ever done, bar none. It has given the 
opportunity of a level playing field for 
young girls to have that opportunity 
they would have never had. What it 
did, it said boys and girls have to have 
the same facilities, coaches, and same 
athletic budgets, also the same schol-
arships if they went to a university. 
Men could not have more than women. 
And we have seen the explosion of 
women sports, bar none. 
When I was coaching years ago, 3 to 
6 percent of the high school girls—3 to 
6 percent—played high school athletics. 
Today, we have close to 60 percent. 
Why? Because of title IX, because of 
more sports that title IX afforded and 
bigger budgets for women athletics. It 
did a tremendous service to women and 
girls across this country. I am proud of 
the progress this country has made and 
the immense talent that it has brought 
out because of what title IX has done. 
But this anniversary, which was the 
50th anniversary in June—think about 
that, 50th anniversary, how time flies. 
I am not that old. But the 50th anniver-
sary of title IX was in June. This anni-
versary comes at a challenging time 
now for young girls and women in 
sports. The ability to train and com-
pete fairly is under attack from activ-
ists and this current White House. 
Since 2003, at least 28 biological males 
have won titles in various women’s 
events around the world. Think about 
that. Now we are allowing biological 
boys and biological men to compete 
against girls and women in sports, and 
they won 28 titles. How fair is that? 
If the current administration and the 
activists pushing this policy have their 
way, biological males winning women’s 
sports championships would become 
the norm. It will be an everyday occur-
rence. That is not fair. It is not fair for 
a young girl or woman that has trained 
all her life in a sport to, at the end of 
the day, have to compete for a cham-
pionship against a young boy who says 
or thinks that he is a woman. What is 
right about that? 
In July, the Department of Edu-
cation published and proposed a rule to 
change how title IX is implemented in 
order to better align with the adminis-
tration’s progressive agenda. These 
proposed changes would require schools 
to allow—this is in title IX now—will 
allow biological males to compete in 
women’s sports. 
Last week, I submitted a public com-
ment to Secretary Cardona that clear-
ly and strongly condemns this new pro-
posed rule. Expanding the definition of 
sex to include gender identity, to iden-
tify whoever you want to identity as, 
will cause lasting damage to the level 
playing field title IX originally was 
created for, which was for women. The 
change to title IX would be a monu-
mental setback for the generations of 
women who have benefited from the 
law over the last 50 years. 
So what are we going to do now? We 
are going to go back to square one be-
cause somebody wants to change it. 
The Department should not move for-
ward with this proposal and not change 
the rule but, instead, work with Con-
gress on legislative action meant to 
strengthen protections afforded women 
in the original statute. 
As I know from firsthand experience, 
participating in college athletics is 
about more than winning and losing. 
There is a lot more to it. Student ath-
letes learn many important lessons by 
participating. It sets our country apart 
from other countries all over the 
world—like the value of hard work, dis-
cipline, commitment, responsibility. 
Athletes learn how to work together, 
be loyal to each other, play for a cause, 
take responsibility for their own ac-
tions, learn how to win—but, more im-
portantly, learn how to lose. Perhaps 
most importantly, they teach student 
athletes that free and fair competition 
allows the best team to win. 
That is why I am so strongly opposed 
to this administration’s plans to de-
value education and unlevel the play-
ing field in the name of leftwing 
progress and indoctrination. 
These attacks on higher education 
and women’s sports must stop. To best 
prepare America’s young people to be 
the next generation of leaders our 
country needs, I am fighting back 
against these policies, like dismantling 
title IX and haphazardly forgiving stu-
dent debt. That encourages young 
adults to break the rules and ignore 
their responsibilities. 
Instead of making our colleges more 
expensive and less fair, Congress should 
be focused on reforms to get to the root 
of the cause. Universities should be en-
couraged to cut budgets and lower tui-
tion rates. Students graduating high 
school should be steered toward career 
and financial decisions that make 
sense for them and that they can af-
ford. Everybody doesn’t need to go to 
college. 
Lastly, 
we 
must 
reject 
these 
ideologies and mobs on the left who 
don’t believe in free speech in the 
classroom and on our college campuses. 
Our country cannot thrive without al-
lowing young adults to freely and fair-
ly learn, grow, develop, and create on

and off the field. We must protect that 
fair playing field while encouraging 
college students to take responsibility 
for their own actions and financial de-
cisions, something all of us here in 
Congress should learn to do as well. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RAILWAY LABOR MANAGEMENT DISPUTE 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, this 
afternoon, I come here with genuine 
concern about the possibility of the 
failure to resolve a railroad labor man-
agement dispute, and I express my sup-
port for that resolution. 
I represent a State, the State of Kan-
sas, its people, America’s largest sup-
plier of wheat, and a top leader in agri-
cultural markets of many other crops. 
I can tell you that a labor strike would 
disrupt the stability of our ag markets 
and could prove catastrophic to our 
global food supply. 
At a time in which hunger is ramp-
ant around the world, again one of the 
last things we need is more difficulties 
in getting agriculture, commodities, 
and food to people around the globe 
who are looking for a meal tonight. In 
my State, corn, soybeans, grain, sor-
ghum—that harvest is underway, and 
farmers need to be able to ship their 
crops by train around the country and 
to our ports where the grain will be 
sent to feed that hungry world. 
In parts of Kansas facing severe 
drought, feed yards, places that we feed 
cattle, are shipping grain in from other 
areas of the country to feed their live-
stock. 
Rail service is critical to making 
sure these producers are able to get the 
feed they need and to keep their live-
stock fed and healthy. The U.S. rail 
network moves critical agricultural 
commodities across the Nation, and a 
complete shutdown of the rail system 
would 
result 
in 
devastating 
con-
sequences across an already weak sup-
ply chain. 
The Association of American Rail-
roads found that a nationwide rail 
shutdown could idle more than 7,000 
trains and lose more than $2 billion a 
day in missed economic output. As the 
deadline approaches, we are already 
seeing the impact of contingency plan-
ning by railways, showing that a full 
shutdown would be totally unaccept-
able. 
With the trucking industry and other 
transportation 
systems 
already 
at 
their maximum capacity, there is no 
alternative plan that could mitigate 
the losses in case of a rail transpor-
tation strike and that rail service com-
ing to an end. 
I have been in regular contact with 
our rail leaders, including those at 
Union Pacific and the Kansas City 
Southern, Burlington Northern Santa 
Fe, and I continue to urge all parties to 
reach an agreement. 
Our constituents deserve certainty 
that will come from reaching that 
agreement. In the event that the con-
clusion is not reached, I will utilize my 
opportunities as a Member of the Sen-
ate, as a Member of Congress for con-
gressional intervention and work to 
shield the impact of a rail shutdown 
across the Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
ISRAEL AND TAIWAN 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, on 
November 11, 2001—exactly 2 months 
after the September 11 attacks—Presi-
dent Bush spoke to the United Nations 
General Assembly about the universal 
threat of terrorism. 
I want to share just a few lines from 
that speech: 
The suffering of September the 11th was in-
flicted on people of many faiths and many 
nations. All of the victims, including Mus-
lims, were killed with equal indifference and 
equal satisfaction by the terrorist leaders. 
Time is passing. Yet, for the United States 
of America, there will be no forgetting Sep-
tember the 11th. We will remember every 
rescuer who died in honor. We will remember 
every family that lives in grief. We will re-
member the fire and ash, the last phone 
calls, the funerals of the children. 
And the people of my country will remem-
ber those who have plotted against us. We 
are learning their names. We are coming to 
know their faces. There is no corner of the 
Earth distant or dark enough to protect 
them. However long it takes, their hour of 
justice will come. 
Every nation has a stake in this cause. As 
we meet, the terrorists are planning more 
murder—perhaps in my country, or perhaps 
in yours. They kill because they aspire to 
dominate. 
Now, 21 years later, I fear that Presi-
dent Biden and many of my Demo-
cratic colleagues have forgotten the 
lessons they learned from that day and 
in the years that have followed. 
What I recall most about the weeks 
and months following the attacks is 
that everyone I talked with, no matter 
their politics, believed that we were 
facing a battle of good versus evil. 
There was a real clarity of conviction 
that demanded we all choose a side. 
Would we stand with freedom or with 
the enemies of freedom? You can dither 
and dally all you want on national se-
curity policy, but there was not much 
dithering to be done on that point, at 
least not in 2001. 
But now, in the mainstream media 
and at the highest levels of the Demo-
cratic Party, we see that clarity of 
conviction ceding ground to moral rel-
ativism. It infected this weekend’s re-
membrance. It infected the debate sur-
rounding Joe Biden’s disastrous with-
drawal from Afghanistan. And it has 
all but derailed any serious discussion 
about emerging threats, not just from 
terrorist organizations but from hos-
tile regimes that the Biden administra-
tion seems determined to appease. 
During this past August work period, 
I had the opportunity to visit two of 
the hot spots. Working with our coun-
terparts in Taiwan and Israel was illu-
minating for many reasons. I wish 
every single one of my colleagues 
would get off their computers, get on a 
plane, and go talk to them about what 
it is like to spend every day on the 
frontlines in this battle against the 
new ‘‘axis of evil.’’ 
Here in the United States, we are 
blessed by the benefit of physical dis-
tance from the hot spots. And it is no 
guarantee of protection, and I believe 
it has lulled many of my colleagues 
into a false sense of security con-
cerning the threats we face. 
Our friends in Taipei and Jerusalem 
don’t share this benefit. They spend 
their days watching missiles fly closer 
to their homes and listening to author-
itarian propaganda from Beijing and 
Iran that threatens innocent families 
with extinction for the crime of simply 
existing. 
In Israel, they are gravely concerned 
about the Biden administration’s de-
sire to enter into a new nuclear deal 
with Tehran. They worry that this will 
move Iran closer to a nuclear warhead. 
They are concerned about what would 
happen with the billions of dollars that 
would flow into Iran’s coffers. What 
would happen with sanctions relief? 
How will they use this money? 
Overall, their fears are dominated by 
the knowledge that, yes, indeed, Iran is 
the world’s largest state sponsor of ter-
rorism. How will they use the money to 
finance the work of their proxies? They 
are particularly concerned how this 
will instigate growth and expansion of 
terrorism in Palestine. 
In Taiwan, they are concerned about 
the growing intensity of Chinese Com-
munist Party aggression. I have also 
heard grave concerns from other island 
nations that if China overruns Taiwan, 
they could be the next to fall. 
But above all, they conveyed a strong 
desire to continue working with the 
United States. Yes, we are their pre-
ferred partner. They need our foreign 
military sales. They want to be able to 
defend themselves. It means they have 
to increase their defense capabilities. 
Taiwan and Israel aren’t the only hot 
spots that should concern us, but they 
both represent the first line of defense 
against the growing influence of the 
new ‘‘axis of evil.’’ 
The one thing I heard, over and over 
again when I was overseas, is that if we 
allow these nations to become overrun, 
it will start a domino effect in the 
Indo-Pacific and the Middle East that 
will be difficult, if not impossible, to 
stop. 
And as we have seen before, when we 
give nations like China and Iran an 
inch, what do they do? They take a 
mile. 
So it is incomprehensible to me that 
Joe Biden and the Democrats are not 
doing everything—everything—in their 
power to stop this from happening. 
Over the past few years, I have 
watched the President and his allies 
treat the threat posed by the new ‘‘axis

of evil’’ like an academic problem, 
rather than what it is, a true threat to 
our freedoms. 
There is no excuse for this. They all 
have access to television and the inter-
net. They know exactly who is in 
charge in Tehran and Beijing and what 
they are willing to do to expand their 
power. 
So why have we made so little 
progress repatriating our supply chains 
and protecting our economy from the 
Chinese Communist Party? Why is Joe 
Biden trying to force the American 
people into another failed nuclear deal 
with Iran? Why are they not listening 
to our closest allies and partners in 
these regions? Why is this administra-
tion having Russia negotiate a new 
Iran nuclear deal? 
If this country continues to treat 
China and Iran like difficult neighbors 
instead of a threat to our freedoms, 
eventually the balance of power will 
shift in their favor. Nations like Tai-
wan and Israel will fall. The United 
States could suffer another devastating 
attack. 
Joe Biden and the Democrats have 
wasted time rejecting reality in favor 
of appeasement. They believe that they 
can negotiate the upper hand and set-
tle things diplomatically. But this isn’t 
diplomacy; this is a hostage situation. 
If it weren’t, images of missiles flying 
towards civilians would have reignited 
the same clarity of conviction we all 
felt after the towers fell and the people 
in charge of our government would be 
shouting warnings from the rooftops 
rather than negotiating away our secu-
rity behind closed doors. 
I would remind my Democratic col-
leagues that U.N. human rights reports 
and strongly worded statements and all 
the other trappings of your current 
brand of diplomacy mean nothing if 
you are not willing to put lives and 
livelihoods on the line to defend them. 
So it is time to decide: Will you 
stand with freedom or with the en-
emies of freedom? 
I want to reiterate President Bush’s 
assessment of the terrorists who at-
tacked our country 21 years ago this 
week because it is an apt comparison 
to be made. ‘‘They kill because they as-
pire to dominate.’’ Think about that 
one. ‘‘They kill because they aspire to 
dominate.’’ 
What the regimes in Tehran and Bei-
jing are doing right now to our friends 
in Israel and Taiwan looks different 
from what al-Qaida did to us on 9/11, 
but their goals are the same. They seek 
global domination, and they are grow-
ing impatient. We can either wait to 
see what they will do next or we can 
stand with our allies and partners and 
demonstrate our resolve to ensure that 
the new axis of evil fails. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today with my colleague from the 
great State of Ohio, Senator PORTMAN, 
to share with the Senate and the coun-
try some of the things that we learned 
from our recent trip to Ukraine. 
I 
first 
want 
to 
thank 
Senator 
PORTMAN. He comes to the floor every 
week—never gives up, whether things 
are good or bad—to talk about what is 
happening in Ukraine. 
President Zelenskyy was incredibly 
grateful—that was the first thing he 
wanted us to report back to the Senate 
and to the country—incredibly grateful 
for all America has done to stand with 
Ukraine. 
We know that this is a country that 
has given its all. Sometimes we wonder 
in our own country: What would we put 
on the line for democracy? Are we 
going to vote? Or things like that. The 
people in this country have put their 
very lives on the line every single day: 
ballerinas donning camo and going to 
the frontline; exhausted workers at a 
nuclear plant trying to protect not just 
Ukraine but all of Europe in what is 
the biggest nuclear powerplant in Eu-
rope and which supplies 20 percent of 
Ukrainian energy; the cellist playing 
beautiful melodies in the bombed-out 
remnants of a town square to remind 
people that no matter what Vladimir 
Putin did to their country, no matter 
what he did with his inhumane barba-
rism, culture and love is there in 
Ukraine, and it is not going away. 
Senator PORTMAN and I visited the 
mass grave in Bucha, and in Irpin we 
saw many, many apartment buildings 
that were completely blown apart from 
the bombs. 
We saw firsthand the strength of the 
Ukrainian people and their leaders. But 
just as Vladimir Putin has shown his 
true colors with the bombing and the 
shelling near a nuclear powerplant, the 
people of Ukraine have shown their col-
ors in a brilliant yellow and blue. Over 
the past 6 months since the invasion, 
their bravery and humanity consist-
ently shine through. 
We 
had, 
together, 
traveled 
to 
Ukraine. And the last group of Sen-
ators who visited before the war start-
ed was Senators SHAHEEN, MURPHY, 
BLUMENTHAL, CRAMER, and WICKER. We 
witnessed the incredible resolve of the 
people back then, and it has only 
grown stronger. 
In 
our 
meeting 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy for over an hour and with 
Defense Minister Reznikov and the 
President’s Chief of Staff, we heard, 
time and time again: the helpfulness of 
the HIMARS. In fact, the Embassy 
staff told us that they went to a take-
out place in Ukraine and that the peo-
ple who worked in the restaurant 
didn’t even know they were with our 
Embassy but knew they were Amer-
ican, and they gave them their bag of 
food, and on the bag was written the 
words ‘‘Thanks for the HIMARS.’’ That 
is how the people of Ukraine are fo-
cused day in and day out on what is 
happening in their region. 
We also, of course, talk about the 
counteroffensive, and I know Senator 
PORTMAN will talk in detail about what 
is happening. And we know the fight is 
not over. Russia has retaliated by 
striking infrastructure just in the last 
few days, and Ukraine is still on the 
move. But, if anything, this is cer-
tainly a sign that our aid—our humani-
tarian aid, our economic aid, and our 
military aid—has been very helpful. 
The situation, of course, remains 
dangerous, 
especially 
in 
the 
Zaporizhzhia region, where the nuclear 
powerplant is located. We have a situa-
tion where the Russians have been 
bombing and shelling around that 
plant, where several times Ukrainians 
have lost power for the power that 
powers that plant. But also, of course, 
that plant provides energy. All of it is 
dangerous. 
We called for the IAEA when we were 
there—they visited literally the next 
day—to be able to inspect that plant. 
They were able to—14 inspectors, with 
2 being allowed to stay on indefinitely. 
And, of course, we have called for a de-
militarized zone, as has our govern-
ment. 
We also got to meet with the 101st 
Airborne in Poland, and they, again, 
underscored our commitment to our 
NATO allies, the work they have been 
doing, including helping the Ukrain-
ians remotely to make repairs on var-
ious missiles and various weapons and 
the like. It is an incredible story. 
Last week, our administration re-
ported that Moscow is in the process of 
purchasing rockets and artillery shells 
from North Korea. It shows how much 
trouble they are in. 
This Senate voted nearly unani-
mously to allow Finland and Sweden to 
join NATO. That must happen as 
quickly as possible because we want to 
see a united front. As Senator PORTMAN 
pointed out many times on our trip, 
there are over 40 nations that are aid-
ing in this effort; it is not America 
alone. 
I always think of that viral video 
that President Zelenskyy did. He knew 
the importance of staying in his coun-
try and not abandoning his post when 
the Russians invaded. If you think 
back to that day, if he had done that, 
if he had left for a safer location, we 
would never be where we are today, 
standing up for democracy. But what 
he said that night was simply this: We 
are here. He said: We are here. From 
that moment on, he and his people in-
spired the world. Now it is our time to 
ensure the Ukrainians—as we move for-
ward with our next continuing resolu-
tion and supplemental with the budg-
et—that we are here for them; that we 
know what they are up against, and it 
is evil, and we stand with their democ-
racy. 
Again, I want to thank Senator 
PORTMAN for his incredible leadership

in working with our leadership, our 
military, but also the Ukrainian lead-
ership. They know him well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Minnesota 
who just talked about our recent visit 
to Ukraine, where we were able to meet 
with President Zelenskyy and his top 
officials and see firsthand what you 
can see on TV. But, frankly, the emo-
tion and just the incredible courage of 
the Ukrainian people, when you see it 
in person, is much more powerful, in-
cluding going to an airport right out-
side of Kyiv where a bunch of inexperi-
enced National Guard troops were able 
to fight off a larger and very seasoned 
group of Russian and Chechen special 
operators who landed at that airport. 
This was back on February 24. You 
may remember seeing this on tele-
vision. I remember watching CNN and 
seeing these Russian troops landing 
one after another. Twenty-five heli-
copters came in, and they were going 
to use that as a staging area, as you 
said so well, to not just take Kyiv but 
take the entire country and topple the 
government. And this small band of 
National Guard troops, fighting for 
their family, fighting for their home-
land, and fighting for freedom, as they 
told us, were able to instead defeat this 
group of highly trained Chechen and 
Russian special operators and turn the 
tide. Within 3 days, they had routed 
them. Thanks to their bravery and 
courage, they were not able to use that 
staging area to then go into the city of 
Kyiv, which is only about 30 minutes 
away, and be able to topple that gov-
ernment. 
I remember we asked the commander 
whom we saw there, who was the com-
mander that night when these heli-
copters arrived: How did you do it? 
Like, how could this have been pos-
sible, that you could fight off these 
more 
experienced 
troops 
and 
the 
world’s third biggest army? And his re-
sponse was: Because I was fighting for 
my family. Remember that? So we saw 
constantly. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR was always good 
about ensuring that the people of 
Ukraine knew that we were standing 
with them and that we understood the 
challenge they face and the fact that 
this is not just a fight for freedom in 
Ukraine but a fight for freedom that 
affects all of us around the world. They 
are the shield, really, of freedom—cer-
tainly for Europe and for so much of 
the rest of the world. 
So I appreciate your, again, going 
with me on the trip. 
We took the last congressional dele-
gation into Ukraine before the invasion 
and now the first authorized one, I 
guess, after. There is so much we were 
able to learn when we were there be-
cause it was a time when the U.N. in-
spectors 
were 
coming 
into 
Zaporizhzhia. This is the biggest pow-
erplant in Europe that Senator KLO-
BUCHAR just talked about. Thank good-
ness they were able to get to the plant, 
inspect the plant, and make some 
changes to try to keep the plant from 
leaking radioactive material that has 
the potential to be another Chernobyl 
and also make a very declarative state-
ment that you must demilitarize that 
zone, which the Russians still have not 
done. In fact, they have done just the 
opposite. They have used that plant as, 
effectively, a military base by having 
their military there, using the plant as 
a shield to fire on Ukrainian positions. 
They have also destroyed infrastruc-
ture going into Ukraine from that 
plant, which is very dangerous, but 
they have used explosives to do so to 
try to cut off the electricity going into 
Ukraine because they would like to 
take that electricity and direct it, in-
stead, to Russia and to Crimea. These 
are dangerous, dangerous games. 
We have seen them play politics with 
food, destroying bins of grain all along 
the southern coast of Ukraine, stop-
ping the ships from going out. Finally 
now, because of the U.N. and Turkey 
and the negotiations, some ships are 
going out. But they have used food as a 
weapon. They have certainly used en-
ergy as a weapon. They continue to do 
so every day, as they are doing in Eu-
rope, as they cut off even the Nord 
Stream 1 Pipeline to Europe, insisting 
the Europeans give up on their sanc-
tions, which need to be tightened, if 
anything. Now they are actually using 
a nuclear powerplant as a weapon of 
war—not just incredibly irresponsible 
but dangerously reckless and risking a 
catastrophe. 
So, again, I appreciate Senator KLO-
BUCHAR coming with me. I appreciate 
her leadership on this issue. We have 
tried to keep this issue totally non-
partisan, not just bipartisan. The mem-
bers of the Ukraine Caucus, including 
Senator KLOBUCHAR and myself, con-
tinue to meet regularly and get up-
dates as to what is going on in Ukraine 
and ensure that we are doing our part 
here as a leader of freedom-loving 
countries all over the world. 
As she said, there are many other 
countries participating. In fact, there 
were 50 countries at the recent con-
ference on providing defensive military 
assistance to Ukraine. At least 42 coun-
tries have provided serious weapons, 
like these longer range artillery weap-
ons that are so essential to Ukraine’s 
success. 
So this is not just America alone, but 
America has a unique leadership role 
to play here. That is what we have seen 
so far. As we come upon another vote 
here in the U.S. Senate and the House 
over the next couple of weeks, we have 
to ensure that we continue to take that 
leadership role. 
I have come to the floor every week 
for the past 21 weeks—this is the 22nd 
week—while we have been in session 
since the invasion began, and the focus 
has been often about kind of grim news 
about what Russia is doing: the mur-
ders, the rapes, the fact that they are 
constantly bombing civilian targets, 
not just apartment buildings but hos-
pitals and schools. It is a grim story, 
and it is a sobering experience to see 
this, as we did in Irpin and in Bucha, to 
see the ditch that the Russians dug to 
be able to dump the bodies that have 
been tortured and murdered. 
But today I am, fortunately, able to 
talk about some much more positive 
news, which is that, at a time of all 
these 
tragic 
circumstances, 
the 
Ukrainians are now making great 
progress and pushing back this Russian 
assault. 
So we were here in the Kyiv area. 
This is where we saw some of the re-
sults of what the Russian troops had 
done, the atrocities and the war crimes 
they had committed—Irpin and Bucha. 
This is where the airport was we talked 
about. You remember, at one point, 
Russians were all in this area. They 
were pushed out and went down to this 
area called the Donbas. 
The 
Russians 
had 
been 
making 
progress 
down 
here, 
frankly, 
in 
Donetsk and Luhansk and even in 
southern 
Ukraine 
here, 
taking 
Kherson. This is one of the key and one 
of the first cities that Russia took. 
Here is Odessa. Here are the ports. 
So that is where we were until a cou-
ple of weeks ago, but a few weeks have 
made a big difference. Just 3 days be-
fore we arrived in Kyiv, there was a 
counteroffensive that began, and that 
counteroffensive was here in the south, 
so going here toward Kherson, as it is 
called, and trying to liberate some of 
these areas that the Russians had in-
vaded. This is what they invaded ini-
tially back in 2014, and this is what 
they invaded more recently. So this 
Russian war has been going on for 81⁄2 
years. 
The good news is that this counter-
offensive has been making progress, 
and that progress has been not just 
here in the south but also up here in 
the northeast. In fact, in many re-
spects, I think what happened is Russia 
moved some of its troops down here to 
the south, knowing that this counter-
offensive was beginning. In a surprise 
move that is really astonishing, the 
Ukrainian troops have made progress 
now here in this area, the northeastern 
part of Ukraine. 
This map will show you a little more 
detail about what is happening up 
north in Kharkiv. And I show you this 
in part to show progress but specifi-
cally to show and demonstrate to my 
colleagues that what we provided in 
military assistance to Ukraine is work-
ing. In particular, they have been ask-
ing for some time for these weapons 
called HIMARS, which are rocket sys-
tems that allow for a longer range and 
more accurate use of artillery. Prior to 
that, the Russians were sitting back 
and firing on Ukrainian positions, de-
stroying towns—again, a lot of civilian 
targets—and doing so with impunity 
because the artillery from Ukraine 
could not reach them. 
So we now know from public sources 
there are at least 16 of these batteries

September 13, 2022 
that are over in the area. There are 
also a few from Germany and the UK. 
They have made a tremendous dif-
ference. That is something, again, that 
is in public reporting, but we have also 
heard quite a bit about this from their 
defense secretary and their team. 
But here is where we are today. Re-
member, all this was red in that larger 
map. Now, after only a few weeks and, 
really, just a couple of weeks in terms 
of this offensive, you see the great 
progress that has been made. A number 
of these cities that they have taken 
back are areas where there is a tremen-
dous advantage to the Ukrainians, be-
cause this city, as an example, is a rail 
hub that was being used to supply the 
Russian troops that are in this part of 
the Donbas called Luhansk. Now look 
at that amount of blue. That is all 
where 
the 
Ukrainians 
have 
made 
progress. In fact, they have pushed the 
Russians right back to the Belarus bor-
der or to the Russian border. So this is 
very positive news. 
Again, the reason for it—the reason 
that Kharkiv Oblast is now free—is be-
cause of the work of 42 countries 
around the world that supplied them 
the necessary equipment, the necessary 
ammo, to be able to succeed and be-
cause of the courage and bravery, most 
importantly, of the Ukrainian fighters. 
Again, think back to that commander 
at that small airport in Kyiv who said: 
We are fighting for our families, for our 
homeland, for our freedom. That gives 
them a distinct advantage, in my view. 
Let there be no doubt that what hap-
pened here in this northeastern part of 
Ukraine was a collapse of demoralized 
Russian forces who fled, often leaving 
behind Russian armored vehicles, per-
sonnel carriers, tanks. You have seen 
some of that, perhaps, on the news cov-
erage. On the other side were Ukrain-
ians showing courage, tenacity, and de-
termination. 
The Ukrainians not just outsmarted 
the Russians, but they were braver and 
charged into the breach to liberate, by 
the way, thousands, if not millions, 
from Russian domination. People came 
out of their homes, by the way, to em-
brace these Ukrainian soldiers and to 
thank them—people who had been hid-
ing in their homes, people who had 
been living under these terrible condi-
tions and suffering from some of the 
atrocities from the Russian troops. 
There was a great photo that I saw 
that I wanted to show you, which is of 
a bus stop in the Kharkiv Oblast, the 
Kharkiv region. This is a bus stop that 
had been defaced by the Russian sol-
diers, including putting the Russian 
flag on it and other graffiti. Here are 
some Ukrainians repainting this bus 
stop with, of course, the colors of 
Ukraine, 
yellow 
and 
blue—yellow 
standing for the sunflower fields that 
at one time were all over the country 
of Ukraine. Unfortunately, because of 
the war, that production will be down 
about 50 percent this year, but it is a 
beautiful sight to see those sunflower 
fields, which I have seen throughout 
Ukraine. And, second, of course, there 
is blue for the beautiful blue sky. 
This is a photograph of people cele-
brating. I think there is another one 
there, too. People are celebrating not 
just the fact that they can reclaim 
their homes but celebrating the fact 
that their country is being liberated, 
that they can, once again, call them-
selves proud Ukrainians and stand tall. 
This is what is happening. 
Sometimes the events of the day 
make it difficult to follow what is 
going on in Ukraine. Remember, we 
saw it on the front pages and the top of 
the news for weeks. And then, more re-
cently, we have gotten distracted with 
other issues. But it is time for us to 
refocus on Ukraine and ensure that we 
are helping them to continue to make 
progress. 
Ukraine has the will, the bravery, 
and the military competence to win. 
We have now seen that. What they need 
are the weapons to be able to defend 
themselves and the equipment that we 
and other nations of the world can pro-
vide for them. The economic aid pack-
age that passed here in the Senate 
back in May included this funding they 
needed—again, 
funding 
for 
the 
HIMARS, as an example. 
It took longer than many of us want-
ed for the administration to provide 
those weapons, but they did provide 
them and, again, we see what is hap-
pening. 
Recently, the administration, just 
this week, is making another request, a 
supplemental request, for additional 
funding. This time it is $13.7 billion in 
Ukraine-related funding, $7.2 billion in 
military assistance of two different 
kinds and then $4.5 billion in budget 
support. 
This is a country whose economy has 
been reduced to a shambles thanks to 
the Russian invasion, and their econ-
omy is down about 40 percent to 50 per-
cent. So until we can have more peace 
in that country and people can come 
back, they need budget support, as well 
as military support, just to be able to 
pay salaries for first responders and 
teachers. 
I was pleased that Secretary of State 
Blinken also made a recent surprise 
visit to Kyiv right after our visit to let 
Ukraine know that the Biden adminis-
tration and this country stands with 
them. He told the leaders the adminis-
tration will continue to provide long- 
term support to Ukraine and to 18 
other countries that are at risk of a 
Russian invasion in the Eastern Euro-
pean area. 
That funding that he promised is 
from some existing appropriations. The 
new money, $13.5 billion, is a new pack-
age. This is a lot of money, but it is 
important that Congress continue to 
strongly support Ukraine, particularly 
during this incredibly critical period 
for the country’s future. 
This is a fight, again, not just about 
Ukraine, but it is a fight about global 
freedom. If we are not there to help 
Ukraine and Ukraine were to lose this 
fight and Russia were to take Ukraine, 
the cost we would all pay would be far, 
far more. 
We have to learn the lessons of the 
past. Last month, we marked 1 year 
since the chaotic withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan, when the Biden administra-
tion was rightly criticized for aban-
doning our allies there. It was a stain 
on American credibility. It shook the 
trust of many of our allies around the 
world. I can say that having talked to 
many of them in the aftermath, if we 
were to abandon Ukraine, especially 
right after they demonstrated such 
spectacular military success, we would 
be making that mistake all over again. 
Many would wonder if America could 
be trusted to watch their backs. 
Remember, Ukraine is a free and 
democratic country that looks to us, 
the United States, as a role model. In 
2014, they made a very deliberate deci-
sion, which was to get rid of a Russian- 
backed corrupt government and, in-
stead, turn to the West—to Europe, to 
the United States—to adopt our free- 
market approaches but also our demo-
cratic approaches of free speech, free 
and fair elections, ensuring that they 
had transparency and were fighting 
corruption. That is the country that we 
want to hold up as a role model and, 
certainly, continue to support them. 
In 1994, we made a commitment after 
the Cold War ended—along with, by the 
way, the UK and Russia—that in ex-
change for them getting rid of their nu-
clear weapons in Ukraine, we would 
stand with them and protect their ter-
ritorial integrity. Of course, Russia is 
not making good on that pledge, but 
for the United States of America it is 
another reason for us to stand with our 
allies who have chosen to stand with 
us. 
To underscore the point that the as-
sistance is appreciated, every time 
Senator KLOBUCHAR and I were at the 
meeting, we heard the same thing, 
whether 
it 
was 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy or whether it was with peo-
ple who were in these small towns like 
Kharkiv or Bucha. It was ‘‘thank you, 
thank you, thank you.’’ There was deep 
appreciation for what we are doing and 
thankfulness to the American people. 
I will remind everyone that Ukraine 
has never asked for us to put American 
boots on the ground. This is not Iraq. 
This is not Afghanistan. What they 
have offered for us is an opportunity to 
protect freedom by providing them 
with the ability to protect themselves. 
We can’t let Vladimir Putin even begin 
to think that the West is beginning to 
falter in this mission, especially as this 
counteroffensive makes more and more 
progress as the war crosses the 200-day 
mark. 
It is important to note that we are 
not the only ones, again, providing it. 
Nations around the world have banded 
together and that is important. They 
know that if aggression can succeed in 
Ukraine, it can spread elsewhere, in-
cluding further Russian encroachments 
in Europe that Russia has openly

September 13, 2022 
talked about, reclaiming the Russian 
Empire, as they say, and increased Chi-
nese aggression throughout Asia, in-
cluding in the Pacific Ocean. 
The Solomon Islands is an example of 
that today, increased Chinese aggres-
sion with regard to Taiwan, and ag-
gressive moves by Iran, exporting ter-
rorism and instability across the Mid-
dle East. 
So this is about Ukraine, but it is 
really about a broader issue, and all 
countries are watching—our allies and 
our adversaries. 
I know there are some out there who 
say we can’t provide indefinite funding 
to Ukraine, with no end in sight. I to-
tally agree. That is not what anybody 
wants to do or no one expects to do. 
Everyone 
agrees 
that 
our 
aid 
to 
Ukraine will end at the right point, as 
Ukraine reclaims its rightful territory. 
The question is just when. We cannot 
let an arbitrary timeline determine 
that. We tried that in Afghanistan; it 
doesn’t work. We have to be guided by 
the reality on the ground. 
It is clear that ending our support 
now would be premature and ill-ad-
vised. We have to step up, and this is 
money well-spent in defense of free-
dom. A Russian victory would be disas-
trous for U.S. national security and the 
stability and volatility of the world, 
the security of our NATO allies, and, 
certainly, the security of Eastern Eu-
rope. 
We know that Russia would not stop 
there. Vladimir Putin himself has said: 
The borders of Russia never end. 
He talked about recreating the So-
viet Union, recreating the Russian Em-
pire. I would say the borders of Russia 
end where freedom begins. 
Meanwhile, China would see the 
West’s surrender in Ukraine as proof of 
the West’s ‘‘weakness.’’ This would fur-
ther embolden them. A Ukrainian vic-
tory would have the opposite effect. It 
would not only cripple Russia’s war 
machine that President Putin has used 
to invade Georgia, Ukraine in 2014, 
Transnistria, Syria, and parts of Africa 
where they continue to meddle. It 
would also make Russian military ag-
gression less likely for a long period of 
time. 
With President Putin expected to 
meet with Chinese President Xi this 
week, both men know that the United 
States and their allies stand together 
against rogue aggression against sov-
ereign countries. That is very impor-
tant as a message to send. 
Of course, with our assistance that 
we are going to be voting on, once 
again, here in this body, there have to 
be safeguards in place. There have to 
be guardrails. We have to ensure that 
military assistance is subject to care-
ful accountability. 
When Senator KLOBUCHAR and I were 
there, we talked to the 101st Airborne 
in Poland, who are handling a lot of 
the equipment coming in from around 
the world, from all these dozens of 
other countries and the United States. 
They talked a lot about what is called 
‘‘end-use monitoring,’’ knowing where 
these weapons are going precisely to 
ensure they are going to the right 
hands, to ensure there is not an issue 
with regard to how these weapons are 
being used. It has been more difficult 
to do that in Ukraine given the secu-
rity concerns. But during our trip, we 
heard about real progress being made 
to increase that U.S. and global over-
sight of our military aid to Ukraine 
with real end-use monitoring. As our 
Embassy in Kyiv begins to bring people 
back, we have more American eyes on 
the ground to ensure that oversight. 
Ukraine, itself, by the way, wants that 
transparency and strongly supports it. 
The price that we pay to stop Russia 
now is small compared to what we 
would pay if they succeed, and the 
deeper price, of course, is being paid by 
Ukraine. 
As 
NATO 
Secretary 
Stoltenberg said recently: 
The price we pay is measured in currency. 
The price they pay [in Ukraine] is measured 
in lives lost every day. 
We are on the side of freedom. 
Ukrainians want their freedom back. 
They fought for it in 2014 in the 
Euromaidan. They fought for it several 
times in their history. The United 
States and dozens of our allies have 
stepped up to help them achieve this 
goal and win this brutal war. 
They have this big advantage. They 
are fighting with heart. They are fight-
ing for the freedom of their homeland, 
their 
families. 
Russia 
is 
fighting 
against an enemy that never truly ex-
isted in the first place. They are fight-
ing against a neighbor that never 
wanted anything but peace with all 
their neighbors, including Russia, but 
now has to take up arms to protect 
itself. 
Recent polling by the International 
Republican Institute, IRI, shows that 
98 
percent 
of 
Ukrainians 
believe 
Ukraine will win this war. Their mo-
rale is strong. Their spirit is amazing. 
That was certainly the feeling I got 
from President Zelenskyy, his team, 
and every other Ukrainian Senator 
KLOBUCHAR and I met with on this trip. 
They are united together for victory. 
We met with parliamentarians from 
four different parties in the Rada, the 
equivalent of their U.S. Congress, their 
parliament. They are all together, all 
working together toward a common 
cause and a common enemy. 
This morale isn’t just in Ukraine. I 
see this spirit every time I go back to 
Ohio, where tens of thousands of 
Ukrainians call Ohio their home. These 
Ukrainian Americans and others from 
the Eastern European area—others of 
the community of nations that have 
been affected by the Soviet Union and 
Russia over the years—they are stick-
ing together and their morale is high 
too. 
On 
Sunday, 
President 
Zelenskyy 
brought this spirit to his people in a 
powerful address to the Ukrainian peo-
ple. This was a 200-day speech that 
talked of 200 days of brave troops fight-
ing. He said that he was certain 
Ukrainians would get through this dif-
ficult path to victory. This was an in-
spirational speech at a time when the 
Ukrainian people are making progress 
toward victory on the battlefield and, 
therefore, peace by getting Vladimir 
Putin to the bargaining table. This 
must be the result. 
With our help and the help of all free-
dom-loving countries, victory can be 
achieved. That is what is so important 
right now as we look at this new appro-
priations bill, this legislation that the 
administration has sent us to help 
Ukraine continue its battle for free-
dom. 
My hope is that this week and next, 
as we take up this legislation, that 
Congress passes it, showing the same 
spirit and the commitment to victory 
as we saw in Ukraine. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
before I start my planned remarks, let 
me thank Senator PORTMAN for his re-
marks and all his effort. There is con-
siderable bipartisan consensus about 
the need for support of Ukraine’s ef-
forts. The mantle of freedom in the 
world right now is carried by Ukraine 
against Russian oppression. I am de-
lighted to have been present for his re-
marks. 
Very early on, there were a few of us 
here in the Senate who, on a bipartisan 
basis, decided that the U.S. policy 
ought to, at a minimum, contemplate 
the possibility of Ukrainian victory, 
that writing it off was simply a bad 
mistake. At the time, it looked like it 
was a very small prospect, but the 
courage of the Ukrainian military, as 
they have pushed back in Kharkiv with 
counteroffensive and the abundant sup-
ply of military hardware that they 
have received from the West has made 
what seemed a fantastic, hopeful no-
tion something that actually could be 
real, and it could be real in a fairly 
short time. 
I, again, thank Senator PORTMAN for 
his remarks. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. President, I am here on a dif-
ferent subject. I will now turn to that 
subject. 
This is the 18th time that I have 
come to the floor to expose the dark 
money scheme that has captured and 
controlled our Supreme Court. 
Over the last 2 years, I have, over and 
over, 
exposed 
how 
dark 
money 
operatives, working from the shadows, 
have installed Supreme Court Justices 
handpicked—handpicked—by the min-
ions of far-right donors. 
I have exposed the key front groups 
through which this Court-packing op-
eration is driven and the tactics that 
the schemers have used to hide the 
dark 
money 
donors 
who 
pull 
its 
strings. 
And when you take a close look at 
the scheme, the little spider that you 
find at the center of the dark money 
web behind it is a character named 
Leonard Leo.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4565 
September 13, 2022 
From his perch at the dark money- 
funded Federalist Society, Leo crafted 
a reputation as the Court-capture 
scheme’s puppet master. The key to his 
craft is an armada of phony front 
groups that shuffle dark money back 
and forth, around and amongst each 
other, to deploy as spin, as propaganda, 
as political ads, or as hidden campaign 
funding. 
During Donald Trump’s time in of-
fice, Leonard Leo brokered the scheme 
to have the Federalist Society or— 
more accurately—the big secret donors 
behind the Federalist Society handpick 
Trump’s Supreme Court nominees. Re-
member that list we all heard about? 
Leo coordinated the dark money 
propaganda machine that kept the heat 
on Senate Republicans to confirm 
those nominees, and he supported the 
big donors’ doctrine factories where 
donor-approved fringe legal doctrines 
are concocted for the anointed judges 
to weaponize from the Bench. 
Look no further than the recent West 
Virginia v. EPA decision weaponizing 
the doctrine factory-concocted major 
questions’ doctrine. And this was no 
small scheme. The latest estimate 
from earlier this year is that these big 
donors put $580 million, more than half 
a billion dollars, into Leo’s network of 
Court-capture front groups. 
Well, little did we know, that was 
just 
the 
beginning. 
Last 
month, 
ProPublica and the New York Times 
broke the news that a reclusive, far- 
right billionaire supercharged Leo’s 
dark money operation with a $1.6 bil-
lion donation to a Leo front group. You 
heard that right, $1.6 billion into this 
dark money operation. 
The man behind this new slush fund 
is a billionaire named Barre Seid, and 
even the way the donation was made 
was creepy and clandestine. Seid and 
Leo devised a plan to transfer all the 
shares in an electronics company to 
Leo’s front group, on the way to selling 
that company. 
So when that company sold for $1.6 
billion, it all went straight to Leo’s 
group and, by the way, helped Seid 
avoid what would have been roughly 
$400 million in taxes. 
Seid has a long history of funding 
far-right front groups. Here is how 
ProPublica characterized what Seid 
calls his ‘‘attack philanthropy.’’ 
Seid has funded climate denialism as well 
as a national network of state-level think 
tanks that promote business deregulation 
and fight Medicaid expansion. He’s also sup-
ported efforts to remake the higher edu-
cation system in a conservative mold, in-
cluding to turn one of the nation’s most po-
litically influential law schools into a train-
ing ground for future generations of right- 
wing judges and justices. 
So let’s unpack all of that, starting 
with the climate denialism. The ‘‘cli-
mate denialism’’ that they are ref-
erencing came from a group that he 
funded called the Heartland Institute. I 
have talked about the Heartland Insti-
tute on the floor before in my ‘‘Web of 
Denial’’ speeches. 
Heartland 
is 
a 
dark 
money 
disinformation mouthpiece for fossil 
fuel interests. In 2012, Heartland com-
pared 
climate 
scientists 
to 
the 
Unabomber. So you can see it is a 
classy bunch. 
According to one of Seid’s advisers, 
he was Heartland’s major patron, and 
he even convinced his business’s chief 
financial officer to join Heartland’s 
board of directors. 
If that isn’t creepy enough for you, 
we move on to the national network of 
State-level think tanks that promote 
business deregulation and fight Med-
icaid expansion. 
That is a reference to the State Pol-
icy Network, a web of dark money 
front groups that pump into State leg-
islatures the propaganda and legisla-
tion designed by fossil fuel and other 
corporate interests. 
The State Policy Network has also 
received millions from DonorsTrust, 
which has been called the ‘‘dark money 
ATM of the right,’’ a central node of 
the rightwing Koch dark money net-
work. 
The service that DonorsTrust pro-
vides is to scrub the identities of ac-
tual donors. It creates dark money. An-
onymity is key for these donors, many 
of whom have financial interests be-
hind their political schemes that they 
really don’t want disclosed. 
If a fossil fuel billionaire, say, wants 
to run ads against me in Rhode Is-
land—folks will get the joke. So the 
real donor’s identity gets laundered 
through groups like DonorsTrust and 
comes out under other groups with 
names like—I am making this one up, 
but they sound this way ‘‘Rhode Island-
ers for Peace and Puppies and Pros-
perity.’’ 
All of that, of course, leaves citizens 
in the dark about both the actors and 
the plot in the politics in which they 
are supposed to be active participants. 
And that brings us to Seid’s project to 
‘‘turn one of the nation’s most politi-
cally influential law schools into a 
training ground for future generations 
of right-wing judges and justices.’’ 
That is a reference to Antonin Scalia 
Law School at George Mason Univer-
sity, a central cog in the right-wing 
doctrine factory. 
The cog was not always named 
Antonin Scalia Law School. In 2016, 
George Mason received $10 million 
from the Charles Koch Foundation, 
plus another $20 million from an anon-
ymous donor, orchestrated by that 
same Leonard Leo, and one of the 
strings 
attached 
was 
that 
George 
Mason rename its law school after 
Scalia. 
When folks at George Mason Univer-
sity, a public university, pushed for an-
swers about all of this, the university, 
after a legal battle, had to disclose 
that renaming the law school wasn’t 
the only string attached to that $20 
million donation. 
Leo and his donor wanted input over 
faculty hiring. And that legal battle 
also unearthed the name of the anony-
mous donor: Barre Seid. And all of that 
brings us back to Seid’s $1.6 billion to 
the Leonard Leo dark money appa-
ratus. 
Remember that with $0.6 billion, Leo 
was able to orchestrate a dark money 
takeover of our Supreme Court, stack-
ing it with far-right Justices, who have 
already delivered massive victories for 
their donors: overturning Roe v. Wade, 
undermining the government’s power 
to combat climate change, throwing 
out century-old commonsense gun reg-
ulations. 
If he can do that with $0.6 billion, 
imagine what kind of damage he will 
be able to do with $1.6 billion to squirt 
out as dark money through his armada 
of phony front groups. 
Leo’s already dispensed $153 million 
to Rule of Law Trust, which appears to 
exist solely to funnel money to other 
dark money groups and another $16.5 
million to his own Concord Fund. If 
you 
have 
been 
watching 
these 
‘‘Scheme’’ speeches, you will remember 
that the last time I addressed the 
scheme in this Chamber, I laid out how 
the Concord Fund and its corporate 
twin, the 85 Fund, are the central nodes 
in a collection of phony front groups 
that deploy fictitious names, fictitious 
names to mask their connections. 
The coordinated and colocated front 
groups, Concord Fund and 85 Fund, op-
erate through the fictitious names Ju-
dicial Crisis Network and Honest Elec-
tions Project, among other fictitious 
names. So, yes, you have got this right. 
In this dark money netherworld, the 
front groups have front groups. 
With this new billion-dollar slush 
fund, Leo can take those efforts to en-
tirely new levels: more voter suppres-
sion, which is the job of Honest Elec-
tions Project; more abortion bans, 
which was the accomplishment of 
Dobbs; more climate denial, which was 
powered by West Virginia v. EPA and 
the earlier EPA decision by the Su-
preme Court about the Clean Power 
Plan; more power for corporations, 
which is, of course, the constant goal 
of this dark money operation; more 
disinformation; and more dirty dark 
money in politics—sluiced around in-
side this covert apparatus until it gets 
squirted out through even more phony 
front groups. 
This dark money slime will ooze ev-
erywhere. With pivotal elections com-
ing up this fall, this slime will ooze out 
through your television sets, through 
your mailboxes, through your tele-
phone, all of it designed to smear and 
lie to benefit far-right donor interests. 
The phony front group squirting out 
the slime will have innocuous-sounding 
names, but make no mistake, hiding 
behind many of them will be Leo and 
his secretive billionaire backers. 
While this tactic isn’t new, it has 
been perfected by the rightwing. It 
began with the Koch brothers, who 
spent the last decade pumping dark 
money into our politics, producing a 
decade of successful climate obstruc-
tion, until finally we got the Inflation 
Reduction Act passed with the first 
real climate measures Congress has

ever passed, but because of the Koch 
brothers’ pressure, we had to rely en-
tirely on Democrats to get that bill 
passed. We did not get one Republican 
vote in the Senate. We did not get one 
Republican vote in the House. 
Constant assaults on workers’ rights, 
endless attacks on the Affordable Care 
Act, and, of course, the rightwing bil-
lionaires own big payoff, big tax cuts 
for billionaires—it is probable that for 
all of the money that got thrown into 
this dark money apparatus by right-
wing billionaires, some of them prob-
ably made more money than that back 
from the tax cuts that were delivered 
for them under the Trump administra-
tion. This is a it-pays-to-play dark 
money operation. 
And the result is that all this dark 
money has reduced the once Grand Old 
Party to the political operation of a 
handful of extremist megadonors. 
The dark money assault on our de-
mocracy is not over. Right now, Leon-
ard Leo, his rightwing donors, and 
their dark money apparatus are devis-
ing the next phases of the scheme. 
They have already captured the high-
est Court in the land, but they will not 
stop until they have enacted their en-
tire radical agenda. They will turn 
their sights on State courts, on city 
councils, on local school boards—any-
where they can find a way to subvert 
democracy with dark money. 
So now is the time to fight back, and 
the first step is to pass the DISCLOSE 
Act. It is way long past time that we 
shine the light on the dark money 
schemers. 
You may recall that in the Citizens 
United decision, by a vote of 8 to 1, 
even that Court said that dark money 
is corrupting. That is an established 
principle of the Citizens United deci-
sion. 
Well, if it is corrupting, we ought to 
get rid of it, because the American peo-
ple deserve to know who captured their 
Supreme Court and who keeps flooding 
our politics with dark money. 
When you spend that kind of money, 
there is a motivation, and voters, citi-
zens, deserve to know. 
To be continued.

and technical support services; studies and 
surveys; and other related elements of air-
craft maintenance and program support. The 
estimated total cost is $450 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by improving the security 
of a partner nation that is a force for polit-
ical stability in the region by allowing Paki-
stan to retain interoperability with U.S. and 
coalition forces in ongoing counterterrorism 
efforts and in preparation for future contin-
gency operations. 
The proposed sale will improve Pakistan’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by continuing the sustainment of its 
F–16 fleet, which is the Pakistan Air Force’s 
premier multi-role jet fighter and greatly 
improves Pakistan’s ability to project com-
bat power in support of counterterrorism 
through its robust air-to-ground capability. 
Pakistan will have no difficulty absorbing 
these articles and services into its armed 
forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Corporation, Fort Worth, TX. There 
are no known offsets proposed in conjunction 
with this sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Pakistan. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

REMEMBERING QUEEN ELIZABETH 
II 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
the attacks of September 11, 2001, ex-
posed the American people to a level of 
vulnerability we had not encountered 
since the Second World War. While the 
terrorists failed in their objective of 
breaking us, they were successful in 
forcing the rest of the world to decide 
if they would give in to fear and re-
main silent or take a stand against the 
violent hatred that motivated the mur-
ders of almost 3,000 innocents. 
For me, the memory of 9/11 is and al-
ways will be dominated by fear for the 
safety of my own children. The hours 
that passed without hearing from them 
were among the loneliest of my life, 
and indeed, that loneliness was shared 
by every American who spent the next 
few terrible days waiting for the phone 
to ring. Our sense of isolation was com-
pounded by a growing chorus of voices 
that blamed Americans for the blood-
shed in New York, Washington, and 
Pennsylvania. 
When Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 
broke with centuries of tradition and 
directed the band of the Coldstream 
Guards to play the ‘‘Star-Spangled 
Banner’’ outside Buckingham Palace 
just 2 days after the attacks, she did 
much more than make a political 
statement. Her small act of rebellion 
confirmed that the special kinship be-
tween our nations will unite us forever 
under a common cause of freedom. 
While some chose cowardice in the 
wake of the attacks, she recognized the 
anguish of a friend and offered a ges-
ture meant only to assure us that we 
were not, and never would be, alone. 
For more than 70 years, the Queen 
ruled with the same grace and dignity 
she afforded the American people in 
our darkest hour. On behalf of all Ten-
nesseans, I offer my gratitude for her 
long life of service, my condolences to 
the royal family, and my assurances to 
the people of the United Kingdom and 
the Commonwealth that, should great 
need arise, there will be no need to ask

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO FRED SMITH 
∑ Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I wish 
to recognize Fred Smith, founder and 
executive chairman of FedEx for re-
ceiving the distinguished L. Welch 
Pogue Award for his outstanding life-
long contributions to the field of com-
mercial aviation. 
On September 14, Mr. Smith, a proud 
Memphian and generous benefactor to 
his city, will receive due commemora-
tion for his renowned achievements 
and contributions involving his organi-
zation, career, and passion. 
Since 1971, the iconic Tennessee com-
pany he founded has facilitated deliv-
eries not just in the United States but 
across the world. 
This includes FedEx’s work on the 
Project Airbridge Operation, a partner-
ship executed by FedEx under the di-
rection of the Federal Government 
that expedited the importation of crit-
ical supplies at the height of the pan-
demic. 
This award, first presented in 1994, 
recognizes individuals with a lifetime 
of achievement in aviation and recog-
nizes individuals who not only have a 
vision for where the industry is headed, 
but have acted to make it a reality. 
I can think of no one more deserving 
to receive such an award. Let us cele-
brate this achievement and commit-
ment to excellence that Mr. Smith has 
shown throughout his career.∑

REMEMBERING LARRY PETREE 
∑ Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Larry 
Petree, a beloved member of the Ba-
kersfield community and a pioneer in 
the creation of a uniquely Californian 
brand of country music. 
Larry Petree was born in Oklahoma 
in 1933 at the heart of the Great De-
pression. Like so many Americans 
from Dust Bowl communities in the 
1930s, at the age of 9, Larry’s family 
moved out West and settled in Bakers-
field, CA. He attended Bakersfield High 
School before going on to serve a tour 
of duty in the U.S. Army and then 
working for over three decades as a me-
chanic with the Kern County Fire De-
partment, where he could overhaul 
truck engines with ease. 
But Larry’s friends and fans knew 
him best working with a different in-
strument. From his seat behind his 
pedal steel guitar, he helped to produce 
the ‘‘Bakersfield Sound,’’ an entirely 
new, rock ‘n roll-inspired genre of 
country music that introduced the 
sounds of California country to a na-
tional audience in the 1960s. 
For decades, Larry’s masterful con-
trol of the twangy steel guitar brought 
life and energy to the honky-tonks and 
watering holes of the Central Valley. 
Playing alongside country artists Red 
Simpson, Tommy Hays, and the West-
ern Swingsters, his music joined the 
likes of Merle Haggard and Buck Owens 
to help fuel a movement that proved 
California could be home to the coun-
try music industry. And he did it all, in 
large part, thanks to the support of his 
wife Betty, his beloved partner for over 
60 years. 
California is grateful for his service 
to our country, his contributions to 
our culture, and for the timeless music 
he introduced to our communities.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. MARKEY, Mr. SANDERS, Ms. 
WARREN, and Mr. BLUMENTHAL): 
S. 4823. A bill to amend the Fair 
Labor Standards Act of 1938 to remove 
the overtime wages exemption for cer-
tain employees, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Guaran-
teeing Overtime for Truckers Act, 
which I introduced today. 
America’s truckdrivers are on the 
frontlines of keeping goods and our 
economy moving. More than 70 percent 
of goods across the United States are 
shipped by truck. 
Unfortunately, the COVID–19 pan-
demic and the resulting supply chain 
crisis exacerbated longstanding chal-
lenges for truckers, including long 
hours away from home and time spent 
waiting—often unpaid—to load and un-
load at congested ports, warehouses, 
and distribution centers. 
As our Nation makes historic invest-
ments in our port and supply chain in-
frastructure through the bipartisan in-
frastructure law, we should also im-
prove wages and working conditions for 
essential workers and ensure they are 
paid for all of the hours they work. 
However, for more than 80 years, 
Federal law has denied truckers guar-
anteed overtime pay benefits that are 
afforded to nearly all other professions. 
This means that if a truckdriver expe-
riences delays due to congestion or 
weather, they are often not paid even 
though they are working. 
The motor carrier exemption is exac-
erbating 
trucking 
workforce 
chal-
lenges. Additionally, research suggests 
that when truck labor rates are fair, 
there is less driver fatigue, fewer regu-
latory violations, and lower crash 
rates. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill to repeal the overtime exemp-
tion for motor carriers. 
I want to thank Senator MARKEY for 
co-leading this bill with me, and I hope 
our colleagues will join us in support of 
this bill that will ensure that trucker 
compensation reflects the fact that 
these jobs are essential. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. DAINES): 
S. 4826. A bill to amend the Healthy 
Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to mod-
ify the definition of the term ‘‘at-risk 
community’’ ; to the Committee on Ag-
riculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the Commu-
nity Wildfire Protection Act, bipar-
tisan legislation that Senator DAINES 
and I are introducing today. 
This bill would ensure that those 
communities that are deemed to be 
under the greatest threat from wildfire 
are eligible to receive existing Federal 
wildfire grants. This sounds obvious 
but unfortunately is not the case under 
existing law. 
This will help more communities in 
our home States of California and Mon-
tana and others throughout the West 
access Federal grants to reduce haz-
ardous fuels around their communities 
and reduce the threat posed by wild-
fire. In particular, it would protect 
areas at risk of a large-scale wildfire 
that 
would 
significantly 
threaten 
human life and property. 
Aligning the definition in law for at- 
risk communities to today’s environ-
mental realities is more important 
than ever given the increased spread, 
frequency, 
and 
destructiveness 
of 
wildfires, especially in the West. 
The current definition of an ‘‘at-risk 
community’’ was codified in the 2003 
Healthy Forest Restoration Act. That 
law requires that, other than experi-
encing significant wildfire risk, an eli-
gible community must either be adja-
cent to Federal land or included on a 
list generated in 2001 consisting of vol-
untary input from States and Tribes. 
To be clear, including a town on this 
list was not based on an objective eval-
uation of wildfire risk or threat to life 
and property, only whether an indi-
vidual Governor or Tribal leader de-
cided to add it. There are obvious omis-
sions from the list that show its inad-
equacy, and in fact, 19 States and terri-
tories never submitted a single com-
munity. 
For example, in California, big cities 
like Fresno, Fairfield, and Napa are 
not included, all of which have experi-
enced major wildfires in recent years, 
nor are countless small towns that are 
at great risk of wildfire. The town of 
Grizzly Flats, CA, which was dev-
astated by the 2021 Caldor Fire, is also 
notably absent from the list. 
The exclusion of these communities 
means that they are not eligible for 
Federal grant funding that would help 
them develop and implement wildfire 
resiliency plans, such as hazardous 
fuels reduction, nor can they utilize 
critical authorities to expedite wildfire 
mitigation projects on nearby Federal 
lands. 
Our bill would simply end the prac-
tice of making Federal grants contin-
gent on being this outdated, incom-
plete 
list. 
Instead, 
our 
legislation 
would allow communities to be in-
cluded based on the most up-to-date 
quantitative wildfire risk data for the 
entire United States—data that are al-
ready maintained by the U.S. Forest 
Service. 
Our bill would also allow commu-
nities not immediately within or adja-
cent to Federal lands to qualify as ‘‘at 
risk’’ of wildfire. This is important 
given a recent survey of more than 
22,000 fires that indicated that wildfires 
are more likely to start on private 
lands and burn into Federal forestlands 
than the reverse. Federal policies must 
adapt to recognize this fact, not pre-
vent funding from going to where it 
would be most effective. 
Better tailoring Federal grants to 
the areas at greatest risk of wildfire is 
particularly essential given congres-
sional funding of wildfire resilience 
projects, including $1.8 billion that 
passed as part the recently enacted In-
flation Reduction Act. 
I am proud that our bill has received 
the support of the National Association 
of Counties, Rural County Representa-
tives of California, the National Asso-
ciation of State Foresters, the Pacific 
Forest Trust, and the California Fire 
Safe Council. 
I am pleased to work with Senator 
DAINES on this commonsense bill that 
will save lives, save communities, and 
ensure that Federal dollars are spent 
as effectively as possible. 
Mr. President, my bill is simple—just 
three lines long—but it would ensure 
that our Federal policies enable bil-
lions in wildfire resiliency funding to 
be applied where it is needed most. 
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor 
this legislation. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself and 
Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 4832. A bill to temporarily prohibit 
the hiring of additional Internal Rev-
enue Service employees until a certain 
level of taxpayer services have im-
proved, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows:

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 4833. A bill to improve the health 
and resiliency of giant sequoias, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of legislation 
that I introduced today along with 
Senator PADILLA to preserve the endur-
ing legacy of California’s giant se-
quoias: the Save Our Sequoias Act. I 
thank Senator PADILLA
for working 
with me on this important bill, as well 
as the bipartisan sponsors of similar 
legislation in the House. 
The Save Our Sequoias Act would 
charge a dedicated group of Federal, 
State, local, and Tribal land managers 
known as the Giant Sequoia Lands Co-
alition with developing wildfire resil-
ience projects to help save these mag-
nificent trees. 
The bill would also provide Federal 
Agencies with narrow, targeted au-
thorities to implement these projects 
quickly and protect our remaining se-
quoias, as well as create a strategy to 
enhance sequoia reforestation. 
Giant sequoias are one of the most 
iconic plants in the world. The sequoia 
known as General Sherman is the larg-
est tree on Earth at more than 100 feet 
in circumference and 275 feet tall. 
Sequoias grow quickly, producing a 
50-foot tree’s worth of wood each year, 
yet can live to be thousands of years 
old. They are also remarkably fire- 
adapted, with spongy bark that can be 
up to 2-feet thick. 
Perhaps most importantly to me, 
these incredible trees only grow in my 
home State of California. Just being 
around these trees is a humbling expe-
rience. Their immensity puts them in a 
class by themselves, and it is no won-
der that they have been the source of 
reverence and amazement. 
For many years, sequoias were con-
sidered nearly immune to the effects of 
wildfires, 
but 
unfortunately 
dev-
astating fires in recent years have 
overwhelmed even their potent de-
fenses. Officials have estimated that 20 
percent of all mature giant sequoias 
have been destroyed just since 2020. 
Scientific research has additionally 
suggested that without significant ac-
tion, another 20 percent could be lost 
in the next 3 years. This would be a 
staggering tragedy and demands ac-
tion. As former President Theodore 
Roosevelt himself put it, ‘‘A grove of 
giant redwood or sequoias should be 
kept just as we keep a great and beau-
tiful cathedral.’’ 
The vast majority of giant sequoias 
live on Federal land, and I thank Presi-
dent Biden and his administration for 
using existing authorities to try to 
save these magnificent trees. Neverthe-
less, Congress can and should enact 
legislation to protect sequoias long 
into the future. 
Our bill would accomplish this goal 
by first codifying the Giant Sequoia 
Lands Coalition, an existing group of 
public land managers with jurisdiction 
over sequoia groves, and requiring it to 
develop a strategy to make sequoia 
groves more resilient to wildfire. It 
would also provide congressional sup-
port for the Biden Administration’s 
current actions under an emergency 
declaration to expedite sequoia wildfire 
resilience projects. 
Federal agencies should not be reli-
ant on emergency authorities, how-
ever, in order to implement necessary 
wildfire resilience projects in the fu-
ture. To that end, our bill provides 
those Agencies with narrow, targeted 
authorities 
to 
continue 
making 
progress on those projects and author-
izes funding for dedicated personnel. It 
also establishes a grant program for se-
quoia resilience projects that occur off 
of Federal land. 
Lastly, our bill ensures that we do 
not simply mitigate future sequoia 
losses but also begin the process of re-
growth. Since sequoias can live to be 
thousands of years old, it is never too 
early to begin rejuvenating these ma-
jestic trees. 
Mr. President, giant sequoias are one 
of the great treasures of the world, not 
just of California. It is incumbent upon 
Congress to pass our bill to ensure they 
are protected and can be cherished for 
thousands of years to come.

757—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE IN SUPPORT OF THE 
PEACEFUL 
DEMOCRATIC 
AND 
ECONOMIC ASPIRATIONS OF THE 
SRI LANKAN PEOPLE 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
DURBIN, Mr. LEAHY, and Mr. BOOKER) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 757 
Whereas Sri Lanka gained its independ-
ence peacefully in 1948, bringing an end to 
British colonial rule; 
Whereas, more than 100,000 Sri Lankans 
died or went missing in subsequent decades 
of ethnic conflict, most acutely at the end of 
the civil war in May 2009; 
Whereas the roots of the conflict, including 
historical inequalities, remain largely unre-
solved; 
Whereas the period of peace, which began 
in 2009, contributed to Sri Lanka’s high 
growth and economic development, building 
on a tourism-based economy; 
Whereas Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected 
as Sri Lanka’s President on November 16, 
2019, and on November 21, 2019, he appointed 
his brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, as Prime 
Minister; 
Whereas Sri Lanka’s governance under 
President Rajapaksa was highly corrupt, 
nepotistic, and lacked transparency; 
Whereas on August 8, 2020, Human Rights 
Watch described President Rajapaksa’s rule 
in 2020 as ‘‘a campaign of fear and intimida-
tion against human rights activists, journal-
ists, lawyers, and others challenging govern-
ment policy’’; 
Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka de-
clined $480,000,000 in United States assistance 
in 2020 in the form of a grant from the Mil-
lennium Challenge Corporation, which was 
designed to reduce poverty through eco-
nomic growth; 
Whereas, the Government of Sri Lanka, 
under the rule of President Rajapaksa— 
(1) devoted state resources for personal po-
litical purposes with little transparency; 
(2) implemented misguided agricultural 
policies; and 
(3) borrowed billions of dollars from China 
to develop economically unviable mega 
projects; 
Whereas, since 2019, Sri Lanka has faced an 
economic crisis, only further exacerbated by 
predatory loans from the People’s Republic 
of China as part of its debt trap diplomacy; 
Whereas 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
economic 
crisis 
caused millions of Sri Lankan citizens to 
live in extremely dire conditions, with se-
vere shortages of medicine, food, and fuel; 
Whereas many Sri Lankans have immi-

often separating spouses and parents from 
children; 
Whereas, beginning in March 2022, the citi-
zens of Sri Lanka courageously exercised 
their fundamental freedoms of speech and as-
sembly to peacefully protest the govern-
ment’s failed economic policies and repres-
sion; 
Whereas, the Government of Sri Lanka 
failed to make its bond and loan payments in 
April 2022, resulting in the country’s first fi-
nancial default in May 2022; 
Whereas tens of thousands of Sri Lankan 
citizens rallied in largely peaceful protests 
on July 9, 2022, to which the government re-
sponded with live fire and tear gas; 
Whereas the events of July 9, 2022, dem-
onstrated 
that 
President 
Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa has lost the confidence of the Sri 
Lankan people; 
Whereas, on July 20, 2022, the parliament of 
Sri Lanka elected Ranil Wickremesinghe as 
President of Sri Lanka; 
Whereas the current Government of Sri 
Lanka has thus far failed to respond to pub-
lic concerns, including establishment of 
transparent investigations into credible alle-
gations of corruption; 
Whereas, on July 13, 2022, amid mounting 
public protests, Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled Sri 
Lanka for Singapore where he formally re-
signed as president, only to return to Sri 
Lanka on September 3, 2022; 
Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka has 
used the country’s Prevention of Terrorism 
Act to target peaceful political opposition; 
Whereas the United States cosponsored 
United Nations Human Rights Council reso-
lution, HRC 46/1 (2021), includes strength-

He endured insults and vandalism, but he 
kept on focusing on making the teammates 
who he loved better players, and made pos-

Mrs. HYDE-SMITH (for herself, Mr.

submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 761 
Whereas the last Sunday in September—

entitled ‘‘Joint Resolution designating the 
last Sunday in September as ‘Gold Star 
Mother’s Day’, and for other purposes’’, ap-
proved June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1895); 
Whereas there is no date dedicated to fami-
lies affected by the loss of a loved one who 
died in service to the United States; 
Whereas a gold star symbolizes a family 
member who died in the line of duty while 
serving in the Armed Forces; 
Whereas the members and veterans of the 
Armed Forces, through their service, bear 
the burden of protecting the freedom of the 
people of the United States; 
Whereas the selfless example of the service 
of the members and veterans of the Armed 
Forces, as well as the sacrifices made by the 
families of those individuals, inspires all in-
dividuals in the United States to sacrifice 
and work diligently for the good of the 
United States; and 
Whereas the sacrifices of the families of 
the fallen members of the Armed Forces and 
the families of veterans of the Armed Forces 
should never be forgotten: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of September 18 
through September 24, 2022, as ‘‘Gold Star 
Families Remembrance Week’’;

made by— 
(A) the families of members of the Armed 
Forces who made the ultimate sacrifice in 
order to defend freedom and protect the 
United States; and 
(B) the families of veterans of the Armed 
Forces; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe Gold Star Families Re-
membrance Week by— 
(A) performing acts of service and good 
will in their communities; and 
(B) celebrating families in which loved 
ones made the ultimate sacrifice so that oth-
ers could continue to enjoy life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness.

RECOGNIZING REVEREND 
CARLTON MAHONE, SR. 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a man of strong faith, a 
distinguished public servant and community 
leader, Reverend Carlton Mahone, Sr., for 50 
years of preaching the Gospel in the Christian 
Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church. Reverend 
Mahone’s five decades of ministry was cele-
brated at a gathering at Holsey Chapel CME 
Church in Columbus, Georgia on August 20, 
2022 at 3:30 p.m. 
Carlton Mahone was born in Atlanta, Geor-
gia to the union of retired CME minister Rev-
erend E. L. Mahone and the late Fannie 
Mahone. He joined the St. Paul CME Church 
in Shiloh, Georgia at an early age and was 
educated at Ruth Carter High School in 
Talbotton, Georgia and, subsequently, Morris 
Brown College in Atlanta. After college, he re-
located to Dayton, Ohio to attend the United 
Theological Seminary to receive training to be 
a minister of the Gospel. Today, Reverend 
Mahone is the pastor of the Holsey Monu-
mental CME Church in Columbus, Georgia. 
Pastor Mahone’s faith called him to be a 
servant leader at many different churches 
across the United States, including pastorates 
in Georgia, Ohio, and Washington state, and 
Alaska where his ministries at the First CME 
Church in Anchorage from 1989 to 1994 
earned him recognition from the NAACP and 
will always have a special place in his heart. 
In addition to his pastoral ministry, Reverend 
Mahone is a dedicated community leader and 
public servant, and his passion for mentoring 
and improving the lives of young people led 
him to run for, and win, a seat on the Talbot 
County, Georgia Board of Education in 2020. 
Reverend Mahone has been recognized nu-
merous times for his community leadership. 
He was named the 1983 Distinguished Pastor 
of the Year of the Georgia Conference for the 
Sixth Episcopal District by the Phillips School 
of Theology. He was recognized again in 2019 
for his ministerial service, receiving Out-
standing Pastor of the Year for the North Co-
lumbus-LaGrange District of the West Georgia 
Region of the Sixth Episcopal District. Addi-
tionally, he is a past president of the South 
Georgia Black Caucus and is currently the 
third Vice President of the Georgia Black Cau-
cus. 
1 Peter Chapter 4, Verse 10 tells us, ‘‘As 
every man hath received the gift, even so min-
ister the same one to another, as good stew-
ards of the manifold grace of God.’’ Reverend 
Mahone exemplifies this verse through his 
dedicated community service in volunteering 
with the Georgia Department of Family and 
Children Services, He also served as the Ex-
ecutive Director for Children and Youth Com-
mission in Fitzgerald, Georgia, and as Chair-
man of Even Start, a federal program to in-
crease literacy among our nation’s children 
and their parents. 
At the center of Pastor Mahone’s accom-
plished life is the unwavering love and support 
of his family and his loving wife, Lisa Thomas 
Mahone. Pastor Mahone is the father of 5 chil-
dren, grandfather of 7, and great-grandfather 
of 2. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
my wife, Vivian; and me, along with the more 
than 730,000 people of the Second Congres-
sional District, The Holsey Monumental CME 
Church family and entire Chattahoochee Val-
ley community, in extending our sincerest ap-
preciation and best wishes to Pastor Carlton 
Mahone, Sr. upon the celebration of his 50th 
year of pastorship and his many years of hum-
ble service to humanity.

HONORING 
CHARLES 
DEMETZ 
UNITED STATES MERCHANT MA-
RINE ACADEMY 2022 GRADUATE 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to recognize Mr. 
Charles DeMetz as a member of the United 
States Merchant Marine Class of 2022. 
DeMetz graduated from the U.S. Merchant 
Marine Academy on Saturday, June 18, 2022, 
and was commissioned as an Ensign in the 
United States Naval Reserves. 
His career in the service has just begun, but 
it is a testament to DeMetz’s unselfish devo-
tion to the people of this great Nation. 
The challenges will be many and the time, 
although it may seem like an eternity, will fly 
by almost unnoticed. 
South Mississippi is proud of DeMetz and 
his accomplishments, and we look forward to 
him continuing to represent not only Mis-
sissippi, but the entire Nation, as a United 
States Naval Reserve Officer. 
As Ensign DeMetz embarks on a new chap-
ter in life, it is my hope that he may always re-
call, with a deep sense of pride and accom-
plishment, graduating from a program as pres-
tigious as the Merchant Marine Academy. 
I would like to send DeMetz my best wishes 
for continued success in his future endeavors, 
thank him for his service, and congratulate 
him on this momentous occasion. 
Semper Fidelis.

HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the heroic actions of 
Simone Edmond, a Dallas ISD school bus 
driver, and of Tekendria Valentine, a school 
bus monitor. These two brave individuals went 
beyond their scope of responsibility by risking 
their lives to save two children in danger. 
On Monday August 22, rushing floodwater 
swept away two young siblings who were wait-
ing for the bus to pick them up. Simone and 
Tekendria, who were working together on the 
same bus, saw the two siblings in the flood-
water and took swift action. 
Thinking quickly, they decided to tie seat-
belts together and use it as a rope to pull the 
kids to safety. The process required them to 
plunge themselves into the rushing floodwater 
and risk their own lives. 
Simone and Tekendria’s bravery, commit-
ment to our children, and selfless actions 
should serve as an inspiration to all of us. On 
behalf of the residents of Texas–24, I thank 
Simone and Tekendria for their courageous 
actions.

REMEMBERING FREDERICK 
EUGENE ZEHNDER 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the life of Frederick ‘‘Fred’’ Eugene 
Zehnder, founder and editor of the San 
Leandro Times, the Castro Valley Forum, and 
prominent KTVU news director, on the anni-
versary of his passing on June 27, 2021. 
Born on a dairy farm in Lakeport, California 
on March 5, 1934, Fred’s love for journalism 
began at the age of 10 when he started the 
Scotts Valley News. This one-page weekly re-
port was written, edited, and delivered all by 
Fred. 
In 1952, Fred attended Humboldt State Col-
lege where he earned a bachelor’s degree in 
Journalism. While studying at Humboldt, he 
worked part-time at the local radio station in 
Eureka, California. 
In 1956, Fred was drafted into the Army. At 
his posting in Fort Bliss, Texas, he worked as 
an Army public information officer under Sam 
Donaldson. After his time in the Army, Fred 
worked for KVIQ–TV in Eureka as the station’s 
first news director. He later worked for several 
other networks, including KPIX Channel 5, 
CBS–TV, and KGO–TV. In 1988, Fred be-
came the news director at KTVU Channel 2 in 
Oakland, California, until his retirement in 
1999. For over 20 years, he worked with tal-
ents such as Dennis Richmond, Barbara 
Simpson, Elaine Corral, Leslie Griffith, Julie 
Haener, Bill Martin, and Mark Ibanez. 
While working at KTVU, Fred founded the 
San Leandro Times and later purchased the 
Castro Valley Forum. Every Wednesday, over 
22,000 copies of the Castro Valley Forum con-
tinue to be delivered for free to Castro Valley 
residents and businesses. Additionally, on 
Thursdays, over 38,000 free copies of the San

Fred tragically lost his life at the age of 87, 
after being struck by a drunk driver while walk-
ing in his Alameda neighborhood. 
Fred shaped the journalism landscape in the 
East Bay, both in print and television. We’re 
grateful for his commitment to community jour-
nalism and the legacy he created. He is sur-
vived by his three brothers, John, Robert, and 
David; his seven nephews and niece, Andy, 
Chris, Jim, Mark, David, Rob, Mitch, and 
Carolyn; and his long-time friends and busi-
ness partners Howard and Claudette Morrison.

CELEBRATING MR. AND MRS. 
GOLDENKRANZ 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 70th wedding anniversary of 
Mr. and Mrs. Steve and Betty Goldenkranz. 
Mr. and Mrs. Goldenkranz exhibit strong val-
ues of family, commitment, and sacrifice, and 
their dedication to each other and to their life 
of service is well-deserving of recognition 
today. 
Steve and Betty Goldenkranz both hail from 
Brooklyn, New York and came of age during 
the Great Depression. After Mr. Goldenkranz 
enlisted in the United States Navy during the 
Korean War in 1951, the two married on Sep-
tember 23, 1952, and soon relocated to New-
foundland, Canada for a military assignment. 
After another relocation to Virginia Beach, Vir-
ginia and a tour of service, the young couple 
returned to Brooklyn, and by 1957, were par-
ents to their three sons Michael, Jeffrey, and 
Andrew. 
After 
leaving 
the 
U.S. 
Navy, 
Mr. 
Goldenkranz worked for Lockheed Aircraft dur-
ing the 1960s Space Race, while Mrs. 
Goldenkranz served their family as fulltime 
homemaker, filling the home with music and 
supporting their sons’ education. Later, Mrs. 
Betty Goldenkranz earned her teaching cre-
dential, became a renowned educator, was 
recognized as the New York State Reading 
Teacher of the Year in 1987, and continued to 
mentor other educators through her work with 
Hunter University. After leaving Lockheed, Mr. 
Goldenkranz returned to higher education and 
graduated in 1974—the same year his oldest 
son graduated. While Working in the home 
furnishing industry until his retirement, he was 
an ardent and enthusiastic supporter of then- 
New York State Assembly member CHUCK 
SCHUMER and has remained as such through-
out his career in the U.S. House of Represent-
atives and the U.S. Senate. 
Both Steve and Betty are forces of change 
in their communities, encouraging their chil-
dren and neighbors to be active in their com-
munity. Together, they enjoy being patrons of 
the arts and attending the opera, ballet, and 
theater. In 2013, Mr. and Mrs. Goldenkranz re-
located to Aptos, California, where they con-
tinue to engage with their community. Now, 
Steve is active with the Alzheimer’s Associa-
tion in an effort to best support his wife, and 
both work closely with local political organiza-
tions and their Temple Beth El community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in cele-
brating Mr. and Mrs. Goldenkranz as they ring 
in their 70th anniversary. May they continue to 
honor the Central Coast and all who know 
them with their wisdom, humor, and generous 
spirit.

CELEBRATING NATIONAL 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect that I rise to celebrate National 
Hispanic Heritage Month and its 2022 theme, 
Unidos: Inclusivity for a Stronger Nation. The 
theme inspires us to ensure that all people are 
welcomed to help build stronger communities 
and a united country. From September 15, 
2022, through October 15, 2022, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, the people of the 
United States will once again celebrate the 
cultures, traditions, and the many remarkable 
contributions Hispanic Americans have made 
throughout our country’s history. 
Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins each 
year on September 15, recognizes the anni-
versaries of the independence of five Latin 
American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Mexico 
and Chile observe their independence days on 
September 16 and September 18, respec-
tively. Since its inception as National Hispanic 
Heritage Week in 1968, which later became 
National Hispanic Heritage Month in 1988, 
Americans have taken this time to reflect on 
the many noteworthy and outstanding efforts 
of generations of Hispanic Americans which 
has helped to establish a more successful and 
honorable nation. 
America’s success is reliant upon the rich 
heritage and cultural diversity of its people. 
Hispanic Heritage Month commends the many 
Hispanic leaders and members of our commu-
nities who have added to the prosperity of the 
United States in every facet of our society. 
Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask you and 
my other distinguished colleagues to once 
again join me in recognizing Hispanic Heritage 
Month. Throughout America’s history, present, 
and future, the Hispanic community has 
played and will continue to play a vital role in 
enriching the quality of life for the people of 
the United States, and they are worthy of our 
deepest admiration and gratitude.

HONORING WWII VETERAN BOB 
RAMOS ON HIS 101ST BIRTHDAY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Bob Ramos, a brave 
and dedicated World War II veteran aboard 
the USS Oklahoma City. As part of the U.S. 
Navy, Mr. Ramos was an active service mem-
ber for two years, earning the American Cam-
paign Medal, Navy Occupation Medal, and the 
World War II Victory Medal, Navy Occupation 
Service Medal, Honorable Service Lapel Pin, 
and Honorable Discharge Button. 
Born on August 23, 1921 to Spanish immi-
grants, Mr. Ramos grew up in Niagara Falls. 
He attended Trott Vocational School where he 
specialized and excelled in welding. Upon his 
graduation, Mr. Ramos found employment at a 
Buffalo shipyard, where he built landing crafts 
to support the war effort. While there, his su-
periors took note of his skills, leading Mr. 
Ramos to be scouted by Hooker Chemical to 
work on a secret project, which he later 
learned was a part of the Manhattan Project. 
Mr. Ramos worked for Hooker Chemical 
until he was drafted into the U.S. Navy in 
March 1944. Sent aboard the USS Oklahoma 
City, Bob achieved the rank of Fireman First 
Class working in the boiler room. He and his 
shipmates were among the first to witness the 
aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki. A few weeks later, Mr. Ramos 
was present at Tokyo Bay where the Japa-
nese surrendered. 
Following the war, Mr. Ramos was rehired 
by Hooker. He continued to work on projects 
involving atomic energy and helped with the 
closure of the Three Mile Power Plant after its 
partial meltdown. 
Mr. Ramos met and fell in love with fellow 
Niagara Falls native, Margaret, whom he mar-
ried prior to his service in the Navy. Margaret 
sadly passed in 2014 due to Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, but Mr. Ramos fondly remembers the 
great times they had together and the care he 
provided her. Mr. Ramos is survived by his 
daughter, Cynthia, and his several grand-
children and greatgrandchildren, all of whom 
he keeps in close contact with. 
Now retired, Mr. Ramos spends his time 
baking and caring for his garden. He likes to 
show off his skills, frequently baking for his 
friends and family. For his niece’s wedding, he 
offered to make over 1,000 pizzelles, an 
Italian waffle cookie, for all the guests. Mr. 
Ramos was also appointed chairman of the 
Niagara Falls Senior Council at its formation. 
Currently, Mr. Ramos regularly volunteers at 
the John Duke Senior Center in Niagara falls. 
As one of approximately 240,000 World War 
II Veterans still alive today, we owe a great 
deal of gratitude to Mr. Ramos for all he has 
done to protect our country. Madam Speaker, 
we stand together today to celebrate Bob 
Ramos on his 101st birthday.

HONORING JENNY DO 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory and in honor of Jenny Do, 
who passed away on Thursday, August 4, 
2022, at the age of 56. She was a talented 
artist, attorney, and activist who was beloved 
and deeply respected in my district. 
Jenny fled Vietnam as a child refugee. She 
came to this country to begin a new life and 
pursue her education. She earned a legal de-
gree and became very involved in issues af-
fecting the Vietnamese American community. 
She served in numerous organizations, includ-
ing the notable Friends of Hue Foundation, to 
provide services to improve and implement 
sustainable solutions in impoverished commu-
nities. She sat on the City of San Jose’s Art 
Commission and was committed to raising

awareness about Vietnamese arts, culture, 
and social issues. As the founder of Ao Dai 
Festival and Green Rice Gallery, she curated 
many well-received exhibitions around the Bay 
Area. 
With almost 20 years of legal experience, 
Jenny was an attorney specializing in worker’s 
compensation cases. She was a fearless ad-
vocate for everything she believed in and was 
willing to help anyone that needed support. 
Jenny battled cancer for 15 years and es-
tablished a support network for Vietnamese 
American cancer patients. She shared her ex-
perience living with cancer over the years and 
her resiliency was an inspiration to many. 
In 2017, Jenny led the efforts to combat the 
devastating flood of Coyote Creek and made 
sure the impacted community received assist-
ance from all levels of government. She estab-
lished a training program to increase disaster 
preparedness amongst Vietnamese Ameri-
cans. During the COVID–19 pandemic, Jenny 
was at the forefront of the community mobi-
lizing efforts to distribute more than 40,000 
sets of PPE equipment to healthcare workers. 
She also led efforts to distribute food to the 
homeless and elderly throughout the Santa 
Clara County. 
Jenny Do touched people from all around 
the world and was an extraordinary human 
being. She was a beacon of light and a role 
model for many. I was honored to see her 
work firsthand throughout San Jose and am 
thankful for her tireless commitment and serv-
ice to the community. Jenny will be greatly 
missed. Please join me in honoring her and 
sharing my deep condolences with her family 
and our community that mourns her loss.

RECOGNIZING MRS. MARY FREE-
MAN 
KELLER 
ZERVIGON, 
A 
CHERISHED 
PUBLIC 
SERVANT 
FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA 
CELEBRATING HER LIFE AS A 
TIRELESS CIVIC ACTIVIST AND 
FIXTURE 
AT 
CITY 
HALL 
FOR 
DECADES 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding, 
cherished public servant from my home State 
of Louisiana. My dear friend, Mrs. Mary Free-
man Keller Zervigon was an amazing human 
being, that left us far too soon. She passed 
away on August 27, 2022 surrounded by her 
loving family . 
A lifelong New Orleanian, Mrs. Zervigon 
was a policy leader, philanthropist and be-
loved civic leader who held posts in two may-
oral administrations and spent countless hours 
serving on civic boards working to improve the 
city. She lived her life doing what she believed 
was the right thing to do. 
Raised with civic activism in her DNA, her 
grandfather A.B. Freeman, who led the Lou-
isiana Coca-Cola Bottling Co., was too a civic 
leader and philanthropist. Her mother, Mrs. 
Rosa Freeman Keller, was an outspoken ad-
vocate of racial justice whose accomplish-
ments included desegregating New Orleans’ 
public libraries. 
At the time of her death, Mary was presi-
dent of the Board of Liquidation, City Debt, 
and a member of Xavier University of Louisi-
ana’s Board of Trustees, the governing boards 
of New Orleans Charter Science and Mathe-
matics High School, the Jesuit Social Re-
search Institute and the School Leadership 
Center. She also served on the Public Affairs 
Research Council’s research committee. 
For much of her life, Mary worked full-time. 
When Moon Landrieu served as mayor, she 
was his executive assistant, then director of 
the city’s Transportation Department. During 
Sidney Barthelemy’s mayoral administration, 
she served as the city’s lobbyist in Baton 
Rouge. Her ability to cut right to the chase 
made her an ideal lobbyist representing New 
Orleans during tough Legislative sessions. 
From 1988 to 1992, Mary also served as 
chairwoman of the Louisiana Tax Commission. 
She was a trustee of one family foundation 
and the president of another. Although Mary’s 
work with those charities was public, she also 
gave generously—and anonymously—to many 
other causes and organizations. 
Mary may have been humble, but she was 
hardly a doormat, said former first lady Sybil 
Morial, who worked with her on the New Orle-
ans Science and Math High School Board. 
‘‘She spoke her mind,’’ Morial said. ‘‘She had 
a lot of qualities her mother had. . . . I had 
great admiration for her because she was so 
frank.’’ 
A lifelong New Orleanian, Mary graduated 
from the Isidore Newman School. She did not 
finish college until after she married Luis Mario 
Zervigon, had five children, and later divorced. 
Then she enrolled at Loyola University New 
Orleans, where she earned undergraduate 
and law degrees. 
In 1973, Mary was a delegate to the state 
Constitutional Convention. Other civic activities 
in her re´sume´ included memberships on the 
Sewerage & Water Board, the Human Rela-
tions Commission and the boards of the Bu-
reau of Governmental Research, the Urban 
League of Greater New Orleans, the Metro-
politan Area Committee, Loyola University 
New Orleans, and the Girl Scouts Louisiana 
East. She also served as a Girl Scout troop 
leader. 
In recognition of her tireless service, Mary 
received the Alexis de Tocqueville Award, the 
highest honor from the United Way of South-
east Louisiana, and the Hannah G. Solomon 
Award from the National Council of Jewish 
Women. 
She is survived by three sons, Andre´s 
Zervigon of New York City and Carlos and 
Luis Zervigon, both of New Orleans; two 
daughters, Alicia Zervigon of New Orleans and 
Rosa Landry of Abita Springs; 12 grand-
children; and a great-grandchild. 
Madam Speaker, I am humbled to have 
crossed Mary Freeman Keller Zervigon’s path 
during my lifetime. The support and guidance 
I received from her during my professional ca-
reer will be something I will cherish forever. I 
am humbly grateful for all she has done to 
serve so many that crossed her path. I am 
honored to celebrate Mary as a true leader in 
the great State of Louisiana. 
RECOGNITION OF MT. ZION 
BAPTIST CHURCH’S 100TH YEAR 
HON. FRED UPTON 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Mt. Zion Baptist Church for 100 
years in the Kalamazoo community. 
This church—one of the first to be built by 
African Americans for African Americans in 
Kalamazoo—has been a pillar of the city for a 
century now after it was founded by Reverend 
Yale H. Putney in a storefront on Main Street. 
Only a few years after its founding, the grow-
ing church relocated to a one-room school-
house on East Ransom Street and next 
moved into a vacated church in 1945 on the 
corner of North Edwards and Parsons Streets. 
Finally, the congregation built their home on 
then-Chestnut Street in 1979, where it remains 
to this day. Chestnut Street was later renamed 
Roberson Street in 1980 to honor former pas-
tors B.A. and A.E. Roberson. 
Under each of these roofs, Mt. Zion Baptist 
Church established a place of worship and 
built a Christ-like community around it. Mt. 
Zion always has offered a helping hand to our 
city, recently offering their church to double as 
a COVID–19 vaccination site under the leader-
ship of Reverend Addis Moore. As always, the 
Church saw a need, and met it. Reverend 
Moore has said in the past that a church’s 
purpose in the African American community is 
to be ‘‘the lifeline of that community, where 
you find everything you need.’’ I thank Rev-
erend Moore for his servant’s heart and strong 
leadership that has brought Mt. Zion to 100 
years of service.

HOMETOWN HERO—PIPELINE TO 
POSSIBILITIES 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize four women who are work-
ing to inspire the next generation of North 
Texans through their nonprofit—Pipeline to 
Possibilities. 
Judges Shequitta Kelly, Stephanie Huff, Lisa 
Green, and Amber Givens are using their plat-
form as judges to teach Dallas ISD students 
important information like what classifies as a 
crime and what life changing consequences 
those crimes entail. 
Their efforts are forging real impacts on 
North Texas students and encouraging them 
to stray away from a life of crime. 
A Dallas ISD student who recently partici-
pated in Pipelines to Possibilities put it best, 
saying ‘‘every action has a consequence . . . 
so just be careful whatever you do in life.’’ 
I have no doubt that because of the incred-
ible service these four women have done for 
the next generation, our community will be-
come an even greater place to live. 
These four women have already been 
asked to expand their program to other 
schools around North Texas and even across 
the country. 
On behalf of our entire community, I’d like to 
thank Judges Kelly, Huff, Green, and Givens

HONORING MR. ANTHONY TONEY 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the valuable contributions of Mr. 
Anthony Toney to the Boys & Girls Clubs of 
Monterey County as a mentor, coach, and role 
model for our community’s youth. The Boys & 
Girls Clubs of Monterey County inspires and 
empowers youth to realize their full potential 
and become responsible, healthy, and produc-
tive citizens. 
Mr. Anthony Toney leads by example, 
teaching us all that giving back to the commu-
nity makes a real difference in people’s lives. 
Raised in the city of Salinas, he graduated 
from North Salinas High School in 1981 and 
then attended Hartnell College. Mr. Toney’s 
exceptional athletic and academic achieve-
ments afforded him the opportunity to study 
and play football at Texas A&M University, 
where he studied Industrial Education and 
graduated in 1985. After being drafted by the 
Philadelphia Eagles in 1986, Mr. Toney em-
barked on a five-year professional football ca-
reer. 
After retiring, Mr. Toney returned to the cen-
tral coast of California and began working with 
Boys & Girls Clubs of Monterey. After 22 
years, Anthony Toney now represents the 
Boys & Girls Clubs of Monterey County as the 
Seaside and Salinas Clubhouse Director, em-
powering Club members and staff to be the 
best versions of themselves. For the past ten 
years, the Johnson-Toney Football Camps, 
co-founded by Mr. Toney, have promoted 
healthy competition for athletes of all abilities 
and taught children and young adults the im-
portance of being a well-rounded member of 
their community. 
Throughout his career, Anthony Toney has 
received recognition for his outstanding con-
tributions to the community, including at the 
California State University, Monterey Bay Sev-
enth Annual Celebration of Community. Addi-
tionally, he was honored as the Master of 
Ceremonies for the Gilroy Special Olympics 
Spring Games. Today, he is rightfully honored 
with the Luis Perez Community Service 
Award. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in thank-
ing Mr. Anthony Toney for his years of service 
to the Central Coast. I extend my personal ap-
preciation to Mr. Anthony Toney as his efforts 
continue to inspire and support the Central 
Coast’s young people.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NO FENC-
ING AT THE UNITED STATES SU-
PREME COURT ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the No Fencing at the United States 
Supreme Court Act, which would prohibit the 
installation of permanent fencing at the U.S. 
Supreme Court. Last year, I introduced a bill 
that would prohibit the installation of perma-
nent fencing at the U.S. Capitol complex. 
After the Supreme Court’s draft opinion in 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health was 
leaked in May, the Supreme Court installed 
temporary 
anti-climb 
fencing 
around 
its 
grounds, which remained in place until late 
August. While the Supreme Court has not an-
nounced plans to install permanent fencing, 
temporary security measures often become 
permanent. 
While I understand the importance of pro-
tecting the Supreme Court building, the Jus-
tices and Supreme Court employees, we can 
and must maintain our commitment to security 
without sacrificing public access by using the 
least restrictive means necessary to address 
security. 
Permanent fencing would send an un-Amer-
ican message to the nation and the world, by 
transforming our democracy from one that is 
accessible and of the people to one that is ex-
clusive and fearful of its own citizens. The Su-
preme Court has long welcomed First Amend-
ment protests and demonstrations without be-
coming a fortress. 
Public property should be open to the pub-
lic. The distance between government and the 
people has grown, with trust in government, 
including the Supreme Court, low. We should 
not entrench that distance further by placing 
intimidating barriers between ourselves as 
public servants and the people we serve. 
There are more effective, less obtrusive secu-
rity solutions than archaic fencing. 
Moreover, the Supreme Court is in a resi-
dential neighborhood in the District of Colum-
bia. The Supreme Court grounds are widely 
used by both D.C. residents and visitors. Per-
manent fencing would block that use. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

BOB FERGUSON 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a Washington State giant and 
true champion for Tri-Cities, Bob Ferguson, 
who peacefully passed away in August. 
The first chairman of the Tri-City Develop-
ment Council, or TRIDEC, Bob played a crit-
ical role at the Hanford Site and in the eco-
nomic development for our region. His resume 
is nothing short of inspiring—he was one of 
the youngest reactor operators at Hanford’s B 
Reactor; Project Manager at the Fast Flux 
Test Facility, Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
the Department of Energy in President 
Carter’s Administration, Managing Director of 
the Washington Public Power Supply System, 
President of R.L. Ferguson & Associates, and 
much more. 
He worked tirelessly to advance energy and 
education causes and donated hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to local colleges, culmi-
nating in the creation of the Institute for North-
west Energy Futures at Washington State Uni-
versity Tri-Cities. 
Bob was riot only a pivotal leader and pio-
neer for Central Washington and the nuclear 
energy industry, but he was also a good 
friend. Bob was a visionary—he was deter-
mined, generous, and kind. 
Bob’s death is truly a loss for our commu-
nity, but his leadership and contributions to 
Central Washington and the country will never 
be forgotten.

TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH ALEXANDER 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Joseph Alexander of Los Ange-
les, California upon his centennial birthday. 
Joseph Alexander was born in 1922 in 
Kowal, Poland. He and his family lived in 
Kowal until the 1939 Nazi German invasion of 
Poland when Joseph was 16 years old. At the 
onset of the war, for reasons still unknown to 
Joseph, his family was spared during the initial 
roundup of Jews in their community, and his 
family was able to escape and join other rel-
atives in the town of Blonie. In 1940, Joseph 
along with his parents and five siblings, were 
transported to the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland. 
It was at this time that Joseph’s father bribed 
some guards to allow Joseph and two of his 
siblings, an older sister and younger brother, 
to escape from Warsaw back to Kowal. This 
was the last time Joseph saw the rest of his 
family. After three days in Kowal, he was 
taken by train to a labor camp. Over the next 
six years, Mr. Alexander was sent to twelve 
different concentration camps, including the in-
famous Auschwitz-Birkenau in occupied Po-
land and Dachau in southern Germany. 
Upon arriving in Auschwitz, Mr. Alexander’s 
left forearm was tattooed with the number 
14284. While captive, he endured forced labor 
under threat of starvation and death—building 
sewers, a dam, an airport, and laying cobble-
stone streets and railroad tracks. According to 
Joseph, one of the ways he survived was to 
always try to work at every camp, and with the 
biggest and strongest men, so that he was not 
grouped with the elderly and sick. Following 
the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Joseph was sent 
back to the Warsaw Ghetto from Auschwitz, to 
clean up the aftermath of the destruction. 
As the Home Army, the Polish underground 
resistance movement, advanced towards War-
saw, Mr. Alexander was sent to concentration 
camps in Germany, and after being moved 
around several times, ended up at Dachau. In 
1945, the Allied forces neared the camp, and 
he was subsequently sent on a death march. 
Due to the impending American liberation, the 
guards abandoned the march, leaving Mr. 
Alexander and the other prisoners to fend for 
themselves. During this time, Joseph and a 
fellow prisoner managed to survive off a dead 
horse that they found in the snow. Mr. Alex-
ander later recounted that it was ‘‘the best 
meal we’d had in a long time.’’ They were 
found by American troops a day later. He im-
migrated to the United States in 1949, where 
he married and had two children. 
Today, Joseph shares his experiences dur-
ing the Holocaust with students in the Burbank 
and 
Glendale 
Unified 
School 
Districts, 
Woodbury University in Burbank, and as a vol-
unteer at the Los Angeles Holocaust Museum.

HONORING THE REMAINING 
NAVAJO CODE TALKERS 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize the last remaining Nav-
ajo Code Talkers. They are the definition of 
strength and honor in the face of adversity. To 
represent Navajo Nation in Congress is a 
privilege. It means representing a place where 
culture and values thrive from the heart. 
Eighty years ago, when our country needed 
heroes, 29 young Navajo men answered. As 
World War II raged on, they took their heart 
language of peace and harmony to create a 
single indigenous language code. Hundreds 
more Navajo men fought for our freedoms in 
the war as well. At Iwo Jima in particular, they 
encoded, transmitted, and decoded without 
error hundreds of messages. Their service 
was key to the Allied Victory in the Pacific 
Theater. 
Today, I am honored to share the stories of 
the three remaining Code Talkers: 
Thomas H. Begay, 94, is originally from 
Chichiltah, New Mexico and currently resides 
in Window Rock, Arizona. He enlisted at age 
16 and served in the United States Marine 
Corps. Upon his original enlistment, Mr. Begay 
was unaware of the secret program for Navajo 
speakers. He served on six combat missions 
from 1943 to 1946. He was honorably dis-
charged on July 23, 1946 after serving in the 
5th Signal Company, 5th Marine Division; 27th 
Marine Regiment, and 5th Marine Division. 
John Kinsel, Sr., 98, is from Lukachukai, Ar-
izona and served in the United States Marine 
Corps. He enlisted at the age of 18 and was 
honorably discharged on January 1, 1946. Mr. 
Kinsel Sr. was awarded the purple heart on 
April 11, 1989, for wounds suffered in action 
at Iwo Jima on March 2, 1945. He also re-
ceived the congressional silver medal in 2001 
for his service as a Navajo Code Talker. 
Peter MacDonald, Sr., is from Teecnospos, 
Arizona and joined the United States Marine 
Corps at the age of 15. He served from 1944 
to 1946 in the 6th Marine Division. His service 
took him overseas to the South Pacific and 
North China. He also received the Congres-
sional Silver Medal for his service. Beyond his 
military service, Mr. MacDonald served as 
Chairman of the Navajo Nation from 1971 to 
1983 and 1987 to 1991. 
Today, we offer our gratitude and admiration 
for these three remaining Navajo Code Talk-
ers and their families. I have no doubt that the 
world as we know it would not be the same 
without them. Their stories remind us of our 
commitment to fight for our democracy. Be-
cause of them we all walk in freedom.

HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. Theresa 
Harris-Tigg and her impact on the greater Buf-
falo area. Her story is one of inspiration and 
achievement. Theresa’s significant presence 
on students all around Western New York is 
nothing short of extraordinary. I would like to 
offer my heartfelt condolences to her husband, 
Robert, and her four children, Robert, Marvin, 
Ebony, and Jason. 
One of the first African Americans to inte-
grate at Buffalo Public School 78, in 1972 
Theresa became a proud graduate of Bennett 
High School. In subsequent years, she would 
add Master’s degrees in business, English, 
and secondary education from Bryant and 
Stratton College, D’Youville College, and 
Canisius College, respectively. She earned 
her doctorate in educational leadership and 
policy from the University at Buffalo. 
Theresa taught for thirteen years at School 
11, School 66, and McKinley High School. 
She would go on to teach as a professor 
emeritus at SUNY Buffalo State and Houghton 
Colleges. Meanwhile, she served on the Buf-
falo Board of Education as the East District 
Representative. She also served two terms as 
the Vice President of Student Achievement for 
the Board of Education. 
Most recently, Theresa had become a pro-
fessionally certified Christian life coach after 
many years of fellowship at New Covenant 
United Church of Christ. 
While her family and friends grieve this loss, 
our entire community should never forget the 
sacrifices and strides that Theresa made 
throughout her lifetime of successes. On be-
half of the countless students that felt her im-
pact on a daily basis, we thank her for all that 
she left behind here in Buffalo. Her contribu-
tions will remain for many years to come.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF GLEN COVE HOSPITAL 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Glen Cove Hospital on the oc-
casion of its centennial anniversary of serving 
the residents of Glen Cove and the sur-
rounding communities. 
Glen Cove is my hometown. We all took 
Glen Cove Hospital for granted until a few 
years ago, when there was a possibility it 
would be gone. This year, as we celebrate its 
100th anniversary we are grateful to everyone 
who has rallied to ensure that the hospital not 
only survives, but thrives. It is a central part of 
our existence and our long-term sustainability. 
My mom was a operating nurse in the Glen 
Cove Hospital. My dad served on the Glen 
Cove Community Hospital Board. I was born 
in Glen Cove Hospital. Helene and I had our 
three children in the Glen Cove Hospital. We 
have been to the emergency room for stitches 
and breaks, or high fevers, or to visit loved 
ones who are sick, or . . . . to pay our last 
respects to our closest friends and family. The 
hospital is woven into the very fabric of our 
lives. 
As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
this indispensable and vital asset, I am recom-
mitting myself to doing everything I can to en-
sure that the Glen Cove Hospital continues to 
be a warm, inviting, community-centered, bea-
con of excellence. I thank the hospital leader-
ship both in Glen Cove and at Northwell 
Health, especially Executive Director Kerri 
Scanlon, Medical Director Dr. Brad Sherman 
and Northwell’s President and CEO Michael 
Dowling. I thank the doctors, nurses, labora-
tory staff, maintenance workers, kitchen crew, 
social workers, volunteers, accountants, re-
ceptionists, security workers and everyone 
else who makes Glen Cove Hospital such a 
special part of our lives. 
I would like to make special mention of one 
Glen Cove resident—Saul Katz. Mr. Katz is 
one of the visionaries that proposed the first 
merger between the North Shore hospital sys-
tem and Glen Cove Hospital, despite the ob-
jection of other Glen Cover’s, . . . like my 
dad. That vision, and his decades to devotion, 
has given us the premier Northwell Health 
system of today. And, not only due to Saul’s 
vision, but also his and his wife, Iris’s over-
whelming and consistent decades of gen-
erosity, the Glen Cove Hospital will continue to 
grow as one of the jewels in the Northwell 
crown. The Katzs are special people, and we 
are fortunate that they are from Glen Cove. 
As Glen Cove Hospital enters its second 
century, I am grateful to the hospital and its 
staff for being such a special part of our com-
munity and look forward to its continued 
growth. Here’s to the next 100 years.

CELEBRATING OAXACA BY THE 
SEA 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Oaxaca by the Sea Celebra-
tion and the cultural partnership, between 
Seaside, California and Oaxaca de Jua´rez, 
Mexico. 
Many Seaside community members have 
Oaxacan roots, and Oaxacan culture can be 
found throughout Seaside. In July, the city of 
Seaside made an official visit to the south-
western capital city of Oaxaca de Jua´rez in 
Oaxaca, Mexico and entered into a Memo-
randum of Understanding to recognize the Sis-
ter City relationship between the two cities. 
The agreement between these two cities will 
solidify a long-term relationship between the 
people and businesses of both cities, enhanc-
ing the cultural connection for years to come. 
In addition to increased cultural awareness, 
this important relationship between the two cit-
ies will positively impact educational partner-
ships and developments, business, tourism, 
and trade. 
Hosted annually, the Oaxaca by the Sea 
Celebration is a testament to the community’s

desire to showcase the diversity of culture 
within Monterey County. The Oaxaca by the 
Sea Celebration provides community members 
an opportunity to showcase, celebrate, and 
educate our neighbors on the complex and dy-
namic cultural experiences held by Seaside 
residents of Oaxacan descent. This celebra-
tion preserves the roots and the culture of our 
community through dance, food, music, and 
art. 
Madam Speaker, I offer my sincere appre-
ciation to the organizers of the Oaxaca by the 
Sea Celebration and to the dedication of Sea-
side and Oaxaca de Jua´rez’s governments to 
uniting our communities through their shared 
culture and customs.

ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
MINERAL 
AREA 
COLLEGE AND FLAT RIVER JUN-
IOR COLLEGE 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Mineral Area College of 
Park Hills, Missouri as it celebrates 100 years 
since its founding to offer advanced education 
after high school. 
It began as Flat River Junior College, the 
third public junior college in Missouri with 
classes for 38 students on September 5, 
1922. In 1965, voters in six public school dis-
tricts approved the founding of Mineral Area 
College as successor to Flat River Junior Col-
lege and in 1970, the campus was established 
where it is today just off U.S. Highway 67. 
Since its founding, the college has educated 
more than 18,000 students, offering 2-year de-
grees in a variety of areas including nursing, 
business, technology and the arts. Welding 
training and an HVAC program are the most 
recent additions with an Industry and Tech-
nology Center set to house career and tech-
nical programs beginning next fall. 
The college has been competitive in ath-
letics, impressive in the arts and always evolv-
ing to offer its students an education that pre-
pares them for a bright future. 
It is my great pleasure to celebrate the 
founding of Flat River Junior College 100 
years ago and to acknowledge the continued 
treasure it is as Mineral Area College today 
before the U.S. House of Representatives.

HOMETOWN HERO—GARLAND ISD 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Garland ISD for its dedica-
tion to ensure our North Texas veterans are 
set up for success when they return home. 
Last month, after recognizing the statewide 
struggle to find employees, Garland ISD 
partnered with Soldiers to Sidelines—a non-
profit aimed at helping soldiers get the train-
ing, credentialing, and even the networking 
needed to build post military careers in coach-
ing. 
I have met with several veterans’ groups 
across North Texas and they have all ex-
pressed the immense challenges they face 
transitioning into civilian life. By partnering with 
Soldiers to Sidelines, Garland ISD has af-
firmed its commitment to helping the heroes of 
North Texas overcome this obstacle. 
It is imperative we lift up and support the 
veterans who have risked it all for our country. 
I’d like to thank Garland ISD for going above 
and beyond to do exactly that.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
DR. E. MICHAEL CAMPBELL 
HON. JOSEPH D. MORELLE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. E. Michael Campbell who 
recently retired as the Director of the Univer-
sity of Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser 
Energetics, or LLE, in my district. 
Only the fourth Director in the 50-year his-
tory of LLE, the U.S. Department of Energy’s 
largest university-based program and home to 
the most powerful lasers at any university in 
the world, Mike’s tenure was marked by sig-
nificant strategic growth at LLE and distin-
guished service in support of the nation’s eco-
nomic and national security. LLE reached new 
highs in numbers of staff, scientists, students, 
external users, academic and industry partner-
ships, and total research funding. He bolstered 
and expanded LLE’s international leadership 
in inertial fusion, high-intensity lasers and op-
tics, arid high-energy-density physics (HEDP) 
research. He has been an outspoken pro-
ponent of strengthening the US’s leadership in 
these fields throughout his illustrious career. 
As a natural bridge-builder and advocate for 
science, Mike fostered strengthened relation-
ships within the Inertial Confinement Fusion 
(ICF) community, including with the other ICF 
facilities, federal agencies including the Na-
tional Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), 
Department 
of 
Energy 
(DOE) 
Office 
of 
Science, National Science Foundation and De-
partment of Defense, academic collaborators 
and industry partners. Mike often joked about 
his eight thousand best friends, and it is an 
honor to be counted among them. 
Dr. Campbell is an internationally known ex-
pert in fusion, high-energy-density science, 
high-power lasers and their applications, and 
advanced energy technologies. Mike helped to 
invent the first laboratory x-ray laser and was 
instrumental in establishing the National Igni-
tion Facility and the role of lasers in HEDP re-
search in support of NNSA’s stockpile stew-
ardship mission. He has won numerous 
awards including the DOE’s E.O. Lawrence 
Award, the American Nuclear Society’s Ed-
ward Teller Award, the American Physical So-
ciety’s John Dawson Award, the Department 
of Energy’s Excellence in Weapons Research 
Award, and the Leadership Award of Fusion 
Power Associates. He is a Fellow of the Opti-
cal Society of America, American Physical So-
ciety, and the European Institute of Physics. 
He has published over 250 articles in scientific 
journals and holds five patents. He received 
his degrees from the University of Pennsyl-
vania, Princeton University, and the University 
of Western Sydney. Beyond these achieve-
ments, Mike has an infectious enthusiasm, es-
pecially 
for 
the 
scientific 
endeavors 
he 
oversaw, as well as dinosaurs and the blues. 
He is also a gifted cartoonist and has depicted 
multiple Members of Congress among his 
many drawings. 
Mike firmly believes in learning from history 
and has an amazing array of stories of pre-
vious giants of the field, always working to en-
sure their efforts are not forgotten but instead 
inspire the next generation. His passion for 
education and mentorship was a focus and 
hallmark of his leadership of LLE. I have had 
the opportunity to meet and interact with a 
number of LLE’s talented students and was al-
ways deeply impressed with not only their 
technical knowledge but also their ability to 
clearly and concisely communicate its impor-
tance to a general audience. I know that our 
future is in better hands due to the future lead-
ers Mike has promoted throughout his career. 
In addition, Mike also worked to create a more 
diverse and inclusive research environment at 
LLE. He established a senior-level diversity 
manager position to increase workforce diver-
sity in STEM related positions, established 
LLE HEDP Equity Scholarships, pushed for 
LLE to join an American Physical Society pro-
gram to increase diversity in physics depart-
ments and laboratories, and greatly expanded 
access to research opportunities and scholar-
ships to area high school students from di-
verse, underserved backgrounds. 
Madam Speaker, although I am saddened 
that Mike’s leadership of LLE has come to a 
close, I know that our Nation has greatly ben-
efitted from Mike’s service and I expect that 
even in retirement, he will continue his life’s 
work to advance science and inspire others.

HONORING GEORGE THOMAS 
NOLAN 
HON. COLIN Z. ALLRED 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of George Thomas Nolan of 
Garland, Texas. Mr. Nolan passed away on 
August 12, 2022, and leaves behind a legacy 
that his family should be proud of. 
Mr. Nolan was born on December 24, 1940, 
in Bay Shore, New York. Like myself, he was 
raised by a single parent. He joined the Army 
as a young man in the 1950s and served as 
a helicopter mechanic in Germany. He later 
went on to be a mechanic and shop steward 
at several airlines. 
Later, he suffered a loss no parent should 
suffer. His daughter, Cari died, at the age of 
38. After this tragedy, Mr. Nolan poured him-
self into community work, registering voters, 
knocking on doors and working to promote 
‘‘fairness and equality.’’ 
He devoted his golden years to strength-
ening Medicare. 
I was so honored to meet Mr. Nolan as part 
of my work to lower prescription drug prices. 
I even had the pleasure to invite him to join a 
roundtable with Speaker PELOSI on that sub-
ject this year. 
Mr. Nolan was a great North Texan, a loving 
family man and a patriot. 
He leaves behind his wife of 55 years, 
Bobbye Nolan, and his son, Tim J. Nolan. He

RECOGNIZING THE WOMEN WHO 
SOAR 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize the accomplishments of 
Mary Kraft, Sylvia Waller, and Polly Letofsky 
who will be honored by the Northwest Douglas 
County Chamber & Economic Development 
Corporation as ‘‘Women Who Soar.’’ 
Each year, the Northwest Douglas County 
Chamber & Economic Development Corpora-
tion recognizes three women in the Denver 
Metro Community who inspire our community 
and are blazing the path for future genera-
tions. 
Mary Kraft has been recognized as a 
‘‘Woman Who Soars’’ because in the face of 
a multitude of struggles, she harnessed inno-
vation and technology to advance her farm’s 
capabilities. Her and her husband used an in-
novative approach to nurture their Blue 
Toothed cows—growing the herd from 200 to 
6,000. Mary held the first leadership role by a 
woman and eventually became President of 
American Agriculture at the Colorado Live-
stock Association. 
Sylvia Waller has been recognized as a 
‘‘Woman Who Soars’’ by challenging and 
changing the standard of beauty. At the age of 
62, she became the first African American in 
32 years to be crowned Mrs. Colorado. Sylvia 
believes beauty has no age, shape, or color, 
rather it is found in the heart and spirit. Sylvia 
is a passionate Volunteer Community Educa-
tor for the Alzheimer’s Association, using her 
personal experience as a caretaker for her fa-
ther who suffered from dementia to help pro-
mote services for individuals and families deal-
ing with the disease. 
Polly Letofsky has been recognized as a 
‘‘Woman Who Soars’’ because of her efforts to 
support authors who self-publish their work. 
She founded My Word Publishing which dis-
rupted the publishing world by helping authors 
professionally self-publish their books while 
maintaining 100 percent of their rights. Since 
its inception, Polly’s business has grown into 
a publishing library of 750 books and rep-
resenting authors from 14 countries. 
From using innovative methods in farming to 
creating a publishing house for self-publishing 
authors, this year’s recipients have made a 
lasting impact on those around them and in 
our community. It is leaders like these three 
women who will allow us to achieve a more 
prosperous and inclusive future and I con-
gratulate them all on being recognized as 
‘‘Women Who Soar.’’ 
HONORING JACK COLMER UNITED 
STATES 
MERCHANT 
MARINE 
ACADEMY 2022 GRADUATE 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to recognize Mr. Jack 
Colmer as a member of the United States 
Merchant Marine Class of 2022. 
Colmer graduated from the U.S. Merchant 
Marine Academy on Saturday, June 18, 2022, 
and was commissioned as an Ensign in the 
United States Naval Reserves. 
His career in the service has just begun, but 
it is a testament to Colmer’s unselfish devotion 
to the people of this great Nation. 
The challenges will be many and the time, 
although it may seem like an eternity, will fly 
by almost unnoticed. 
South Mississippi is proud of Colmer and 
his accomplishments, and we look forward to 
him continuing to represent not only Mis-
sissippi, but the entire Nation, as a United 
States Naval Reserve Officer. 
As Ensign Colmer embarks on a new chap-
ter in life, it is my hope that he may always re-
call, with a deep sense of pride and accom-
plishment, graduating from a program as pres-
tigious as the Merchant Marine Academy. 
I would like to send Colmer my best wishes 
for continued success in his future endeavors, 
thank him for his service, and congratulate 
him on this momentous occasion. 
Semper Fidelis.

CELEBRATING MONTEREY 
PENINSULA COLLEGE 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Monterey Peninsula College as it 
celebrates 75 years of commitment to higher 
learning and service to the central coast of 
California. Since its establishment in 1947, 
Monterey Peninsula College has continued to 
provide transformative educational opportuni-
ties to students. 
Monterey Peninsula College first began in-
struction in 1947 at Monterey High School. 
The next year, 280 students enrolled at the 
college’s Fremont Street campus, and in 1949, 
34 students were the first to graduate from 
this college by the Bay. By 1957, Monterey 
Peninsula College celebrated a milestone as it 
enrolled 1,000 students, and the College em-
barked on expanding its campus to include a 
library, arts and music center, athletic swim-
ming pool, theater, and instruction buildings in 
the years that followed. The Library and Tech-
nology Center opened in 2003 and four years 
later, the College celebrated the first day of 
classes at the new Education Center in Ma-
rina. 
Monterey Peninsula College continues to 
expand educational opportunities for its ever- 
growing student population. From 1971 to 
1973, Monterey Peninsula College operated 
an extension campus at Fort Ord, which great-
ly benefitted Armed Forces personnel and 
their families. From 1982 until 1993, a partner-
ship between the College and the Community 
Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula created 
the Maurine Church Coburn School of Nurs-
ing. This continued expansion of its facilities 
and programs ensures students at Monterey 
Peninsula College have access to high-quality 
education and post-graduate opportunities. 
Monterey Peninsula College’s illustrious his-
tory includes visits and recognition from many 
renowned educators, athletes, and activists. In 
1960, the former First Lady and civil rights ac-
tivist Eleanor Roosevelt spoke at the College, 
followed by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. the fol-
lowing year. American activist Rosa Parks 
also spoke at the campus in 1990, bolstering 
the impressive history of this institution as well 
as its goal to enrich students’ educations. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the U.S. House of Representatives join me 
in congratulating Monterey Peninsula College 
and its remarkable rise from its humble begin-
nings in Monterey High School to becoming a 
respected institution. I personally extend my 
gratitude to Monterey Peninsula College’s ad-
ministration, instructors, leaders, and vision-
aries who continue to provide its students with 
life-changing opportunities and experiences.

Richard, who served in the United States 
Marine Corps, has had his commercial driver’s 
and private pilot’s licenses since he was in 
high school, and for years Ann has raised 
support for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. 
The Cobbs are members of Heflin Baptist

CELEBRATING 
CHAPLAIN 
BEN-
JAMIN VEGORS’ 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chaplain 
Benjamin Vegors, who will celebrate his 100th 
birthday on Sunday, September 25, 2022. 
Benjamin lives in Walla Walla, Wash., where 
for the last four decades, he has lived an in-
spiring life full of purpose. As anyone who 
knows him will tell you, Benjamin has had a 
positive impact on every person he has 
crossed paths with, both in his service to our 
country and community. 
Chaplain Vegors is a man of great integrity, 
and he is a tremendous example to the next 
generation. He valiantly protected our coun-
try’s freedom and liberty in the midst of World 
War II, when he served in the Army Air Corps 
from 1942 to 1945. During a particularly fateful 
mission in which two of his plane’s engines 
were shot out, Chaplain Vegors made a prom-
ise that if he survived, he would serve God for 
the rest of his life. 
Benjamin stayed true to his word. After his 
time as a serviceman, Chaplain Vegors turned 
his focus to living a life dedicated in service to 
God and His people. He attended Seminary at 
Multnomah Bible College in Portland and was 
appointed as a full-time chaplain at the Jona-
than M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical 
Center in Walla Walla in 1972. For 42 years, 
Chaplain Vegors selflessly served his brothers 
and sisters in arms, veterans from all across 
Eastern Washington, by offering his counsel 
and care until his retirement in 2014 at the 
age of 91. 
During his remarkable 100 years of life, 
Chaplain Benjamin Vegors has undoubtedly 
fulfilled his mission to serve God and help oth-
ers. Madam Speaker, on this most special 
day, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing 
Benjamin Vegors the happiest 100th birthday 
and celebrating the legacy he will leave within 
our community for generations to come.

Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to ex-
press concern about the welfare of Emad 
Shargi, a longtime resident of the District of 
Columbia 
who 
has 
been 
unjustly 
and 
inhumanely detained in Iran since 2018. 
While visiting his wife’s family in Iran, Mr. 
Shargi was arrested in the middle of the night 
by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and 
forcefully taken to the notorious Evin Prison, 
where he was held in solitary confinement and 
intensely interrogated for eight months. He 
was then released and cleared of the fab-
ricated charges but was denied the return of 
his travel documents and banned from leaving 
the country. In November 2020, he was sen-
tenced, without a trial, to 10 years in prison on 
fabricated charges. He is in Evin Prison. His 
family and I are concerned about his well- 
being. 
I call upon the State Department to prioritize 
the immediate release of Emad Shargi and to 
do everything possible to bring him home 
safely.

IN RECOGNITION OF OFFICER 
DOMINIC HALL 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the life and legacy of an out-
standing public servant, Officer Dominic Hall. 
A military veteran and police officer with the 
Appleton Police Department, Officer Hall dedi-
cated his life to serving his Nation and our 
Northeast Wisconsin community. Officer Hall 
was committed to serving the United States 
and Northeast Wisconsin through many dif-
ferent roles. He enlisted in the United States 
Marine Corps after graduating from Xavier 
High School and was active duty from 2008 to 
2012. He then reenlisted in the Army National 
Guard where he continued serving until 2018. 
His dedication and commitment to his country 
has been memorialized by countless recogni-
tions received during his career, including the 
Afghanistan Campaign Medal with three Cam-
paign Stars, the Bronze Star, USN Meritorious 
Unit Commendation, USMC Good Conduct 
Medal, National Defense Service Medal, the 
Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and 
more. It is evident through his years of impec-
cable service that Officer Hall’s dedication to 
his nation and community never wavered. I 
am incredibly grateful for his selfless and dedi-
cated service. 
Officer Hall continued to serve his commu-
nity by joining the Police Department in the 
City of Appleton in 2017. Since 2017, he pro-
tected his friends and neighbors and was rec-
ognized by receiving the Appleton Police De-
partment Commander’s Commendation for ap-
prehension of a homicide suspect, and the Ap-
pleton Police Department Life Saving Award. 
Officer 
Hall’s 
exemplary 
character 
and 
thoughtfulness will certainly be missed by 
many throughout the City of Appleton and 
Northeast Wisconsin. 
Throughout Officer Hall’s fight with cancer 
that began in 2021 he continued to shine a 
light in our community. His battle with cancer 
brought together his church community at St. 
Pius X Parish frequently praying for healing. I 
am confident Officer Hall inspired many 
throughout our community with his fighting 
spirit. 
Madam Speaker, today the people of North-
east Wisconsin thank Officer Dominic Hall for 
his extraordinary devotion to his community. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, 
Jacole, his two children, and all the people 
who were touched by his life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SAMUEL 
SANDOVAL 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the life of Mr. Samuel 
Sandoval, a Navajo Code Talker of World War 
II. 
In 1922, Mr. Sandoval was born in Nageezi, 
New Mexico. At just 16 years old, he enlisted 
in the United States Marine Corps and joined 
other Navajo servicemembers in the fight for 
freedom and liberty. He endured five combat 
assignments including at Bougainville, Guadal-
canal, Guam, Okinawa, and Peleliu. He was 
highly decorated for his actions throughout the 
campaigns. In fact, Mr. Sandoval was the per-
son who received and decoded the message 
of Japanese surrender on August 15, 1945. 
Mr. Sandoval’s devotion to service and his 
community continued long after World War II. 
He became a certified substance use coun-
selor to restore harmony to the lives of many 
of his kinsmen from his military service. He 
worked to preserve Dine´ Bizaad, the heart lan-
guage of the Navajo people, and to empha-
size the Navajo language code’s impact on 
the country. 
At 98 years old, Mr. Sandoval served as the 
Vice President of the Navajo Code Talkers 
Museum Corporation. He pushed for the real-
ization of a museum to showcase and honor 
the code and the culture of Dine´. 
Mr. Sandoval and his wife, Malula Sandoval, 
raised 11 children. On July 29, 2022, Samuel 
Sandoval—warrior, teacher, and motivator— 
drew his last breath and passed away. 
May we all give thanks for his service and 
honor his legacy.

HONORING MONTEREY COUNTY 
FILM COMMISSION 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Monterey County Film Com-
mission and its 35 years of service to the 
Monterey Peninsula. The commission’s mis-
sion to inspire, facilitate, and assist in film and 
media production in Monterey County is in-
valuable to our ability to showcase the pristine 
beauty of the central coast of California and 
create positive economic impact. 
Since its creation in 1987, the Monterey 
County Film Commission has been a leader in 
the media industry, attracting and assisting the 
production of hundreds of movies, television 
shows, commercials, documentaries, and still 
photography productions. Over the years, the 
Commission’s work has generated over $126 
million in revenue for our community. Most re-
cently, the Peninsula was home to HBO’s criti-
cally acclaimed Big Little Lies, filmed in Mon-
terey and Pacific Grove. Other productions 
have included, Ratched, filmed in Salinas, Big 
Sur, and Monterey; All the Old Knives, filmed 
in Carmel-by-the-Sea and Big Sur; and Mal-
colm & Marie, filmed in Carmel Valley—nota-
bly one of the first movies completed during 
the coronavirus pandemic. 
The creation of this organization was not 
without its challenges, but with years of hard 
work and perseverance, the Commission is 
the foundation of our local media industry and 
serves as a liaison for producers, government 
entities, and local businesses. Additionally, the 
Commission serves our community by high-
lighting desirable filming locations through do-
mestic and international tradeshows, sales 
outreach, and direct public advertising cam-
paigns. 
The Commission, through its artistic and 
generous spirit, strives to inspire and educate 
the next generation of filmmakers. The hard 
work of the staff and Board of Directors con-
tinues to provide our community and our coun-
try with successful and critically acclaimed 
productions set on the breathtaking Central 
Coast that we are all fortunate enough to call 
home. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize the history, dedication, and contributions 
of the Monterey County Film Commission. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
the Monterey County Film Commission as an 
exceptional group of community and artistic 
leaders who strive to showcase the beauty of 
the Monterey Peninsula to the world.

RECOGNIZING 
ROBERT 
WILKINS 
FOR HIS SERVICE TO SOUTHERN 
ILLINOIS 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Robert Wilkins for his service to 
Southern Illinois. Bob was hired by the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers in 1973 and served 
as the Operations Manager at the Carlyle 
Lake Project Office, Kaskaskia River Project 
and Jerry F. Costello Lock and Dam over the 
years. 
During his nearly 47 years of service, Mr. 
Wilkins was involved with working groups in-
cluding the Kaskaskia Watershed Association, 
Carlyle Lake Association, Lower Kaskaskia 
Stakeholders and Okaw River Basin Coalition. 
These groups consist of federal and state 
agencies, community leaders and stake-
holders who develop solutions to service the 
Kaskaskia Watershed, which covers about 10 
percent of Illinois. 
Bob’s efforts to obtain funding for the oper-
ation and maintenance of the lock and dam 
and the support of commercial towing on the 
Kaskaskia have allowed Southern Illinois 
Transfer, Kaskaskia River Terminals, and 
Kaskaskia Shipyard to expand commercial 
navigation on the river. To commemorate his 
work, including 20 years as operations man-
ager of the Kaskaskia River Project and Jerry 
F. Costello Lock and Dam, the shipyard has 
named the next vessel in the retractable 
wheelhouse towboat series after Bob. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Mr. Robert Wilkins on this momentous 
occasion. I thank Bob for his service to our 
Southern Illinois communities and congratulate 
him on his retirement. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
W. CHAMPION 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of John W. Cham-
pion. John was born July 22, 1961, in Jack-
son, MS to William M. and Annette Champion. 
He attended Oxford High School, playing 
every sport he could including basketball, 
baseball and football. A die-hard Ole Miss 
Fan, John was a graduate of The University of 
Mississippi, earning his Bachelor’s Degree and 
law degree. Well respected and accomplished 
in his field, in 1993, he was appointed Assist-
ant District Attorney. 
In 2001, John became the District Attorney 
for the 17th Circuit Court District, serving his 
community with integrity. An avid golfer, his 
idea of a relaxing afternoon was a day spent 
on the course with good friends. John loved 
Italian food, but enjoyed the meal most when 
it was shared with his family and friends. A 
family man at heart, he treasured any oppor-
tunity to spend time with his loved ones. John 
was preceded in death by his father, William 
M. Champion and his cousin, Dr. Lynn John-
ston Stavely. 
John is survived by his mother, Annette 
Johnston Champion of Oxford, MS; daughters, 
Brittney Champion and her wife, Courtney 
McCullar of Senatobia, MS and Kelli Cham-
pion of Atlanta, GA; sister, Laura C. Hall of At-
lanta, GA; grandchildren, Brittani Champion 
and Zofia Champion; three nieces, Sara Hall, 
Annette Hall, and Grace Hall; and one neph-
ew, Jackson Hall.

HONORING GEORGE E. ‘‘TRIPP’’ 
WADE, III 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a loving husband, dedi-
cated father, gifted entrepreneur, and tireless 
community servant, George Emmett ‘‘Tripp’’ 
Wade, III. Sadly, Tripp passed away suddenly 
on August 31, 2022. A celebration of his re-
markable life was held at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 
September 6, 2022 at St. Paul United Meth-
odist Church in Columbus, Georgia. 
George Emmett ‘‘Tripp’’ Wade, III was born 
on September 8, 1959, in Savannah, Georgia, 
to the union of George Emmett ‘‘Sonny’’ 
Wade, Jr. and the late Gertrude (Trudy) 
Crockett Wade. ‘‘Tripp’’ graduated from the 
University of Georgia in 1981 with a Bach-
elor’s Degree in Economics. He used his aca-
demic training and the experience gained in 
his formative years to run the family business, 
The Wade Companies, a linen and laundry 
company that was started by his grandfather 
in 1939 and expanded by his father. Following 
school, Tripp returned home, working with his 
father and further expanded the family’s entre-
preneurial efforts to include ColorMac 2, 
Henri’s Formal Wear, and HOOAHWEAR mili-
tary apparel. Because of his extraordinary suc-
cess in the dry cleaning and laundry industry,

he was selected to be on the board of the 
Central States Corporation Network (CSC). 
This network represents all of the independent 
rental laundries in the United States and Can-
ada. 
‘‘Tripp’s’’ life was more than just about run-
ning a successful business. He was about 
serving people and his community. With the 
breadth of his business acumen, he was a 
natural to spearhead economic development 
initiatives in the Chattahoochee Valley. His 
portfolio was vast and wide reflecting his gift 
of time and talent to numerous organizations 
including; Midtown, Inc. where he served a 
three year term as President; The Greater Co-
lumbus Chamber of Commerce; The Colum-
bus Sports Council; The Saint Francis Foun-
dation; the Better Business Bureau; and the 
Summerwinds 
Condominium 
Association. 
While ‘‘Tripp’’ was a natural leader, he was 
also a graduate of Leadership Georgia and 
Leadership Columbus. Dear to his heart, how-
ever was his association with the Columbus 
Rotary Club where he was a member for 32 
years, serving as the 2006–2007 President 
and later as the Foundation Chair. 
His life and career were built on relation-
ships. He met people and judged them not by 
who they were when he met them, but who 
they could become. ‘‘Tripp’s’’ own words ce-
ment this fact: ‘‘From the beginning of my ca-
reer, I learned the value of long-term relation-
ships.’’ He used the relationships that he built 
over his lifetime to make the world a better 
place for humankind. 
‘‘Tripp’’ loved his family and they were the 
center of his life. None of his success would 
have been possible without the love and sup-
port of his wife of 30 years, Alice Skinner 
Wade, his devoted parents George Emmett 
‘‘Sonny’’ Wade, Jr, and Gertrude (Trudy) 
Crockett Wade, as well as his three devoted 
sons, George Emmett Wade, IV, William An-
drew Wade, and Wesley Crockett Wade. 
On a personal note, ‘‘Tripp’’ was my friend. 
Every time I interacted with him, he mentioned 
something that he felt would make the com-
munity better. He lived and breathed commu-
nity service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
my wife, Vivian; and me, along with the more 
than 730,000 people of the Second Congres-
sional District, in honoring and commending 
the life and legacy of George Emmett ‘‘Tripp’’ 
Wade, III for a life well lived and in extending 
our deepest condolences to his family, friends, 
and all who mourn his loss. May they be con-
soled and comforted by their faith and the 
Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months 
ahead.

INTRODUCTION OF THE RESTROOM 
ACCESS ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. NORTON, Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Restroom Access Act of 2022, 
which would require retail establishments to 
provide individuals with medical conditions re-
quiring immediate use of a restroom, such as 
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, access 
to employee-only restrooms when such estab-
lishments do not have public restrooms. Indi-
viduals would have to present a Department of 
Labor-issued identification card certifying such 
a medical condition. 
Individuals with certain medical conditions 
need immediate access to a restroom. When 
public restrooms are not available, it can cre-
ate uncomfortable or embarrassing situations 
for these individuals. As long as there are no 
safety concerns, which my bill addresses, 
these individuals should be able to use em-
ployee-only restrooms. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

THE LITTLEST OF ANGELS, IN RE-
MEMBRANCE OF THE CHILDREN 
WHO DIED ON 9/11 
HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a poem, The Littlest of 
Angels, by Albert Carey Caswell. 
Rise. 
Rising up to Heaven with tears in their eyes. 
So very protected the while, 
held so very tenderly with the Lord at their 
side. 
Rise up to heaven now my sweet child. 
A child, 
is but such a warm smile. 
For within them so lies, 
the very hope of all of Woman and Mankind. 
Where all our bright futures so lie. 
A bright light, 
now with the warm glow of an Angel in 
flight. 
The true validation that God so exists, 
and of which all is so right. 
Those little ones whose hearts to ours such 
warm feelings ignite. 
Where, all of our dreams so begin and so end 
on this night. 
With such promise, such bright lights, such 
high hopes, such smiles, 
and wonderful laughs bringing us delight. 
As we gaze at them so very closely in time, 
surely its there we find our Lord’s hand upon 
them so divine. 
When, such a wicked dark evil comes in we 
find. 
Stealing away these lives so very precious, 
ones of such promise and light in hearts and 
in minds. 
For word’s can’t express this the world’s 
darkest of all sins. 
As its here on earth our tragic pain cry be-
gins. 
Knowing we will never see them again. 
Oh these dark hearted deeds, 
foul works all planted by The Devil’s hench-
men these seeds. 
Of such wickedness, 
all in these most nefarious of all acts. 
Bringing heartache and grief these true sons 
of Satan heart contracts. 
‘Oh the tears, oh the tears, 
for all of those lost precious stolen years. 
As a torrent of heartache and grief upon 
hearts appears. 
Forever and a day flows here. 
A child now forever to be, 
not to blossom and grow tall like a tree. 
To give the world a life’s journey. 
With their fruition upon earth to see. 
Growing old and wise from love’s seed. 
And the great blessing of a family. 
For all those broken hearts now left behind, 
try to find some solace to escape your mis-
ery. 
In knowing the darkness is no match for the 
light. 
And all your loved ones dwell as Angels from 
here to eternity in heaven’s light. 
Raining tears, raining tears, 
as our children cry here. 
With his arms all around them, 
as our lord now wipes their tears. 
‘‘My children you have nothing to fear’’. 
One day your family will all be here. 
Come to me and spend the rest of eternity 
here. 
Our life is but a short one upon this Mother 
Earth. 
And from a distance what now seems but 
only the worst. 
Is not, 
for an eternity up in Heaven with our Lord is 
that not for what we all search? 
Amen.

HONORING ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ MODEL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, as Co- 
Chair of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Cau-
cus, I rise today to recognize an individual that 
has made significant contributions to our na-
tion’s fish and wildlife conservation efforts, as 
well as America’s longstanding outdoor tradi-
tions. This individual is also the inaugural re-
cipient of an award named after members of 
this body that have made lasting and signifi-
cant contributions to our nation’s outdoor herit-
age. 
Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Model was born in Greenwich, 
Connecticut in 1942 to Faith Rockefeller 
Model and Belgian Jean Model. Model at-
tended The Browning School in New York and 
then graduated from Elon College in Elon, 
North Carolina in 1967. Bob and his wife, 
Mona, now live in Cody, Wyoming where he is 
a rancher, outfitter, and businessman, as well 
as a hunter, conservationist, philanthropist, 
and active participant in wildlife conservation. 
Bob has long been a champion of private 
lands in sustaining our public wildlife re-
sources and of the need to improve sportsman 
and landowner relations. On his Mooncrest 
Ranch, Bob has actively worked to enhance 
wildlife habitat on both private and public 
lands. In an ongoing partnership with the Wyo-
ming Game and Fish Department and the 
Shoshone National Forest, Bob has success-
fully grown a non-migratory elk herd in the 
Rattlesnake Mountain and Trout Creek Basin 
area from 250 elk to well over 2,000 since the 
mid 1970s. The herd is maintaining their popu-
lation in very difficult circumstances, including 
wildfires 
and 
drought. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Mooncrest Ranch provides several hundred 
days annually of free public access for big 
game hunting. 
While Bob is an excellent steward of the 
land, his most noteworthy contributions to 
wildlife conservation in Wyoming and through-
out the country are in the public policy arena 
at the national level. Bob is a member, past 
president, and chairman of the Boone and 
Crockett Club. During Bob’s tenure as presi-
dent, he was a leader in re-establishing the 
Club’s historic role as one of the premiere 
conservation organizations promoting hunter 
ethics and advancing national policy on wildlife 
conservation and hunting heritage. As a well- 
read historian, Bob understands, believes, 
practices, and even preaches the conservation

philosophy of Theodore Roosevelt and George 
Bird Grinnell who were founders of the Boone 
and Crockett Club. As a Boone and Crockett 
member, Bob has personally provided major 
support for Boone and Crockett endowed pro-
fessorships at the University of Montana, Or-
egon State University, and Texas A&M. Bob 
has also been an advocate for professional 
wildlife management with a long tenure on the 
Board of Directors for the Wildlife Manage-
ment Institute, including a stint as Chairman. 
He was a founder and past chairman of the 
American 
Wildlife 
Conservation 
Partners 
(AWCP) which is a coalition of over forty of 
America’s most respected hunter/conservation 
organizations that meet to discuss and take 
action on the most important conservation 
issues facing our country. The AWCP has de-
veloped and forwarded a conservation vision 
to the Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden Ad-
ministrations and works actively with adminis-
tration officials to implement the necessary 
policy revisions. 
During the George W. Bush Administration, 
Bob was a member and chairman of the 
Sporting Conservation Council and served as 
a member of the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage 
Conservation Council during the Obama Ad-
ministration. Bob is also a founder and board 
member of the National Conservation Leader-
ship Institute in Shepherdstown, WV, a joint 
endeavor between state and federal wildlife 
agencies, private conservation organizations, 
and natural resource industry to provide world- 
class leadership training to the next generation 
of conservation executives. 
Bob has also been instrumental in the 
founding and growth of the Congressional 
Sportsmen’s Caucus, the largest bipartisan, bi-
cameral caucus in the United States Con-
gress, bringing together members with pro-
fessed support for hunting, fishing, and profes-
sional 
wildlife 
management. 
Since 
the 
Caucus’s founding in 1988, Bob has remained 
active and involved through his support of nu-
merous Caucus initiatives and his many con-
tributions to the Congressional Sportsmen’s 
Foundation, including his nearly two decades 
of service on the Foundation Board of Direc-
tors, including a term as Chairman of the 
Board. 
In recognition of Mr. Model’s service to con-
servation—both on-the ground and in the pol-
icy arena—Mr. Model has been chosen as the 
inaugural 
recipient 
of 
the 
Dingell-Young 
Sportsmen’s Legacy Award, a fitting tribute to 
an individual whose life has epitomized dedi-
cation to America’s outdoor heritage. 
Named in recognition of the Dingell family— 
Congressmen John D. Dingell, Sr. and my 
husband, John D. Dingell, Jr.—and my good 
friend, the late Congressman Don Young, the 
Dingell-Young Sportsmen’s Legacy Award is a 
fitting tribute for Mr. Model. Each day as Co- 
Chair of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Cau-
cus, I think about the award’s namesake pa-
trons. Like them, Mr. Model’s contributions 
were built upon a commitment to never allow-
ing partisan politics to cloud his love of the 
great outdoors and his commitment to the 
time-honored traditions of hunting and fishing. 
In closing, I want to thank Mr. Model for his 
many contributions to America’s outdoor herit-
age and congratulate him for the well-de-
served recognition as the first ever recipient of 
the Dingell-Young Sportsmen’s Legacy Award.

Pozo’’ neighborhood in South Dallas. After 
moving with his family to East Dallas, Paul at-
tended and graduated from Crozier Tech High 
School. 
After graduation, Paul enlisted in the United 
States Army, where he would serve a 4-year 
enlistment with two tours to Vietnam. He 
bravely served in the 1st Cavalry Infantry divi-
sion aboard the Huey and Chinook gunships, 
one of the first helicopter divisions to experi-
ence combat in Vietnam. 
When he returned home to the United 
States, he married the love of his life, Sarah 
Lucille, in 1973 and had three beautiful chil-
dren. Paul later worked as a precision optician 
on defense contracts at Texas Instruments for 
more than 20 years. 
Paul was a member of the Freemasons and 
the Shriners Society, as well as belonging to 
other organizations such as the American Le-
gion, Disabled Veterans, and VFW. He re-
ceived several awards for his heroic bravery 
over his life. He was awarded the Carnegie 
Medal of Heroism and was honored by numer-
ous city and state organizations, including the 
State Legislature of Texas, for saving four 
lives in a head-on car collision. 
He also served his community by mentoring 
youth through sports. Paul received two 
Coach of the Year awards and led teams to 
multiple division titles and championships. 
Paul lived a very selfless life and was 
known to always put others before himself. He 
was a dedicated husband, father, and grand-
father. Paul’s courage and kindness will leave 
a lasting impact on so many in Dallas. 
I was lucky to know Paul, and I am proud 
to honor the life and legacy of Paul Tafalla 
today. His memory lives with his wife, children, 
and grandchildren. My thoughts and prayers 
are with his loved ones and the Dallas com-
munity today.

RECOGNIZING MAYOR RICK DAVIS, 
A LEADER IN HIS HOMETOWN OF 
TONAWANDA 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor my friend, the former 
mayor of the City of Tonawanda, Rick Davis. 
for his recognition as Democrat of the Year. 
A graduate of Tonawanda High School, Rick 
joined the Air Force in 1992. Trained as a me-
teorologist, Rick was eventually stationed in 
South Korea, and later in several U.S. cities. 
Upon re-entry to civilian life ten years later, 
Rick dedicated his career to continuing his 
love of meteorology—but this time he did so 
with the Federal Aviation Administration. He 
continues his work there today. 
In 2006, Rick decided to expand his con-
tributions in public service by running for and 
serving as 4th Ward Councilman in the City of 
Tonawanda from 2006 through 2009. In 2013, 
Rick ran for Mayor, eventually serving two 
terms. 
Over that time, Rick was able to obtain 
more than $30 million in grant funding and left 
Tonawanda with a budget surplus in excess of 
$8 million—the largest surplus in the city’s his-
tory. Projects like the Intermodal Hub, Canal 
Street Plaza, and improvements to Gateway 
Park were made possible through his leader-
ship. Rick had recognized some of the most 
pressing issues facing Americans in the 21st 
century: economic growth, healthcare, and 
housing. For each of these challenges, Mayor 
Davis can point to tangible changes in city pol-
icy. This includes revamping the city’s Local 
Waterfront Revitalization Plan and ensuring 
the Zombie Housing Grant program’s pres-
ence in Tonawanda. 
Furthermore, during the pandemic, Rick 
Davis was a noteworthy figure for one distinc-
tive reason: he was the only mayor in our con-
gressional district to participate in Zoom meet-
ings in front of a Metallica banner. All jokes 
aside, I trust that the next chapter of his life 
will include spending more time with his wife, 
Megan, with the ten children they share in 
their blended family, as well as with their three 
grandsons. Throughout his tenure, Rick deliv-
ered results to thousands of citizens within 
New York’s 26th Congressional district, and 
we all owe him a debt of gratitude for his self-
less dedication to the people he represented.

HOMETOWN HERO—TEXAS-24 
TEACHERS 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize all of the incredible teach-
ers of Texas-24 as they begin a new school 
year. 
Our teachers work tirelessly to prepare the 
next generation of North Texans for a lifetime 
of success. Without their wisdom and guid-
ance, our students would not be equipped with 
the tools necessary to navigate their future ca-
reers. 
Their flexibility and dedication to the next 
generation was on full display last year. As 
schools shut down during the pandemic, our 
selfless teachers had to adapt to a new envi-
ronment to ensure our students continued 
their education. 
With this new year beginning, I’d like to 
thank our Texas-24 teachers for their dedica-
tion and many sacrifices made in the name of 
education. This week—and every week—take 
time to thank a teacher.

to 
recognize 
Westminster 
Presbyterian 
Church, of Munster, Indiana, as its members 
and leaders join in celebration of the church’s 
60th anniversary. The congregation will be 
commemorating this momentous occasion with 
a special service and celebratory brunch on 
Sunday, September 18, 2022. 
In 1961, twenty-nine families met to discuss 
the establishment of a new Presbyterian 
church in Munster, Indiana. After obtaining its 
validation, the church, which would later come 
to be known as Westminster Presbyterian 
Church, held its first service on February 4, 
1962, at the Independence Park Community 
Building. Eighty individuals were in attendance 
while thirty-three children met at the town hall 
for Sunday School. The congregation then 
began holding services at Munster Christian 
Reformed Church under the leadership and 
guidance of its first pastor, Reverend Gerald 
Gregg. During its early years, Westminster’s 
membership continued to grow, and the con-
gregation soon purchased five acres of land 
on the corner of Elliott Drive and Columbia Av-
enue, the location that would become its per-
manent home. Westminster’s first service at 
the new building took place on Palm Sunday, 
April 11, 1965. 
Westminster’s second pastor, Reverend 
Richard Rogers, arrived in January of 1979 
and would remain in this capacity for nearly 
thirty years. During his extraordinary tenure, 
the membership experienced immense growth, 
additional Sunday worship services, and 
began to televise services. Eventually, in the 
mid-1990s, Westminster would make the deci-
sion to replace its building, while keeping its 
original sanctuary, in order to accommodate 
its growing needs. 
A beacon of hope in the community, West-
minster Presbyterian Church has been dedi-
cated to charitable efforts within Northwest In-
diana and beyond. Throughout the years, the 
church has graciously supported local organi-
zations including Habitat for Humanity, Greater 
Hammond Community Services, the Samari-
tan Center, Sojourner Truth House, and North-
west Indiana Veterans Village, among others. 
Westminster’s members have also selflessly 
dedicated their time and efforts to feeding the 
homeless in their communities and providing 
blankets and winter clothing items for schools 
and relief organizations. Globally, the church’s 
mission has directly improved the lives of 
countless individuals through its support of or-
ganizations including Heart for Africa, Living 
Waters, and Malawi Matters, as well through 
its commitment to aiding those impacted by 
the devastating Haitian earthquakes of 2010. 
Despite the challenges in recent years 
caused by the COVID pandemic, Westminster 
Presbyterian Church has continued to thrive 
and is currently led by Reverend Angela Ryo. 
The church’s outstanding musical programs 
have been a source of pride for the commu-
nity, and its Christian educational programs, 
which are offered for children, teens, and 
adults, have been essential to its members. 
Westminster Presbyterian Church is truly a 
congregation worthy of emulation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring and congratulating Westminster Pres-
byterian Church, of Munster, Indiana, on its 
special milestone. For the past sixty years, it 
has served as an exceptional partner in the 
Northwest Indiana community. The members 
and church leaders have dedicated them-
selves to serving others, especially those most 
in need, and they are an inspiration to us all.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE MT. VERNON ME-
MORIAL GARDENS CEMETERY 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 75th anniversary of the Mt. 
Vernon Memorial Gardens Cemetery. 
The cemetery was acquired by Gene and 
Betty Wells in 1952. In 1967, their daughter 
and son-in-law, Cathy and Eugene Stanford, 
acquired and placed 25 flags to honor our he-
roes in uniform laid to rest in the cemetery. 
Over the years, they also began placing 
homemade crosses bearing the names of 
each veteran interred there. Earlier this year, 
the Stanfords and their staff set up an avenue 
of 419 flags and 1,200 crosses to represent 
every veteran laid to rest at Memorial Gardens 
Cemetery. 
In 2019, a local citizen encouraged Memo-
rial Gardens to participate in the Wreaths 
Across America program. Since then, the Mt. 
Vernon community comes out to the cemetery 
every year to place small flags at the marker 
of each veteran ahead of Veterans’ Day. 
When the wreaths arrive in December, the 
community uses those flags to easily identify 
which graves bear the heroes from the Mt. 
Vernon area who served our nation. 
I also want to recognize the Stanfords’ 
daughter, Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Stan-
ford, who answered the call to serve on Sep-
tember 11, 2001. Twenty-one years later, she 
continues to patriotically serve our nation in 
the U.S. Army Reserves. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the Stanfords’ efforts to keep the mem-
ory of generations of servicemembers alive 
and for the important role they’ve played in 
providing a place of comfort for grieving 
Southern Illinois families.

RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
TOWN 
OF 
MUNFORD 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Town of Munford 
on their 20th anniversary. 
In the latter part of 1999 and early 2000, the 
citizens of the Community of Munford, Ala-
bama, located in the northern portion of 
Talladega County, began a campaign to incor-
porate the community. One of the main pur-
poses for incorporating was to separate itself 
from the City of Oxford, which was rapidly ex-
panding and moving closer and closer to 
Munford. 
In August of 2002, an election was held, 
and the Town of Munford was incorporated 
with a population of 1,508. The newly elected 
mayor and five council members took office in 
November of that year. Now Munford was in 
control of its own growth. 
Munford has a very strong Water Board and 
Volunteer Fire Department to serve the area. 
The town also has a brand new middle school 
and high school and a new elementary school. 
The future looks bright for this great small 
town. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the Town of Munford on their 20th anni-
versary.

H.R. 5641 would codify a final rule issued 
by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) in August 2022 that allows 
more disaster relief projects to qualify as 
small projects and thus be approved for fed-
eral assistance under a simplified review 
process. That rule increased the upper mone-
tary threshold for small projects from 
$139,800 to $1 million. Projects under the 
threshold are approved for assistance based 
on estimated costs rather than on the actual 
costs of projects and are typically approved 
for assistance more quickly. 
Because H.R. 5641 would codify an existing 
regulation, CBO estimates that enacting the 
provision related to a higher threshold for 
small projects would not affect the budget, 
relative to current law. 
In addition, within three years of enact-
ment, H.R. 5641 would require the inspector

curity to audit projects that have received 
assistance under the higher threshold for the 
simplified 
review 
process 
to 
determine 
whether there has been waste or abuse. Using 
information from FEMA and the Govern-
ment Accountability Office about the cost of 
similar audits, CBO estimates that imple-
menting that requirement would cost about 
$1 million over the 2022–2027 period. Any 
spending would be subject to the availability 
of appropriated funds. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
Jon Sperl. The estimate was reviewed by H.

CELEBRATING MRS. HELEN B. 
RUCKER 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the vibrant life of Mrs. Helen B. 
Rucker as we celebrate her 90th birthday. 
Mrs. Rucker is a pillar of the Monterey Penin-
sula and her dedication to social equality ce-
ments her legacy in the history of the Central 
Coast. 
Since 1964, Mrs. Rucker has been a civil 
rights activist, educator, and community leader 
in the city of Seaside. Through her varied 
roles as a member of the School Board and 
City Council, a leader of the Monterey County 
National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People, and founder of the Seaside 
Voter Education Center, Mrs. Rucker’s work 
has been a testament to her passion for the 
well-being of her community. 
Mrs. Rucker’s efforts to combat social injus-
tices dates back to her days as a librarian and 
teacher. Throughout her tenure as an educa-
tor, Mrs. Rucker provided opportunities for stu-
dents to learn and grow. She and her hus-
band, Mr. James Rucker, went on to open a 
library, where students receive free tutoring 
and a work environment free of distraction. 
After retiring in 1988, Mrs. Rucker served on 
the Seaside City Council and participated in 
major policy decisions regarding water man-
agement, transportation, and Fort Ord Military 
Base. Additionally, in 2005, Mrs. Rucker was 
elected to the Board of Trustees of the Mon-
terey Peninsula Unified School District, where 
she took on leadership roles in programs like 
After School Tutoring and the California State 
University, Monterey Bay Service-Learning In-
stitute. 
Mrs. Rucker’s efforts to advance the rights 
and well-being of Monterey Peninsula resi-
dents has earned her consistent recognition 
and admiration from her community. In 2015, 
Mrs. Rucker was honored as the 29th Assem-
bly District Woman of the Year for ‘‘enriching 
the lives of so many residents in the Monterey 
Bay Area through her selfless and tireless 
work to teach students, boost civic engage-
ment, and participate in governance.’’ In Feb-
ruary of this year, in recognition of her lifelong 
community work and activism, Mrs. Rucker 
was given an honorary key to the city of Sea-
side by Mayor Ian Oglesby. In April, California 
State University, Monterey Bay revealed the 
University’s Helen Rucker Center for Black Ex-
cellence. This center provides additional re-
sources and support to students of the African 
diaspora. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Mrs. Helen B. Rucker in celebration of 
her life’s work in education, civil rights, and 
community leadership. Mrs. Rucker will con-
tinue to serve as a model for selflessness and 
compassion for our community. It is therefore 
fitting and proper that we honor her today.

RECOGNIZING MARY HOSTETTER 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Mary Hostetter of 
Kimmswick, Missouri, founder of the Blue Owl 
Restaurant & Bakery, who is retiring after 40 
years. 
Mary started the business in her home and 
then opened The Blue Owl in August of 1985. 
Since then, she has established The Blue Owl 
as a place for a hearty meal, a warm wel-
come, and a delicious dessert. No visit to Jef-
ferson County is complete without a trip to 
The Blue Owl. 
Through her TV appearances and articles in 
magazines and newspapers, the world has 
learned of Mary, and she has surely become 
an Ambassador of Good Eating. Her Mile High 
Levee Pie pays tribute to Kimmswick’s triumph 
in the 1993 flood and is evidence of her strong 
commitment to her community and her cus-
tomers. It’s just one of the dishes for which 
she is famous. 
Mary is indeed a treasure whose passion for 
food and service lives on in her daughter, Kim 
Byerly, who, with her husband Dan will con-
tinue Mary’s legacy of excellence at The Blue 
Owl. 
As she trades her blue apron for a wonder-
ful retirement, it is my great pleasure to honor 
Mary Hostetter today before the United States 
House of Representatives.

HOMETOWN HERO—THOMAS 
BOOTHBY 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Thomas Boothby, a high 
school senior at Trinity Valley School who has 
gone above and beyond to give back to un-
derprivileged North Texas students. 
Thomas had the selfless goal of giving kids 
the same opportunity to learn that he has. 
That is why he started Tools to Teach, a non-
profit organization designed to help kids excel 
in the classroom even though they might not 
have the necessary resources to do so. 
With Tools to Teach, Thomas puts together 
backpacks full of supplies to give to students 
around DFW, which has helped them stay in 
school and increased literacy rates in our 
community. 
Thomas’s selfless pursuit to help his com-
munity and the next generation of North Tex-
ans should serve as an inspiration to all of us. 
On behalf of everyone in DFW, I’d like to 
thank Thomas for his work and wish him the 
best as he finishes up high school this year.

Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to recognize Mr. Josh-
ua Rivera as a member of the United States 
Air Force Academy Class of 2022. 
Rivera graduated from the U.S. Air Force 
Academy on Friday, June 17, 2022, and was 
commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the 
United States Air Force. 
His career in the service has just begun, but 
it is a testament to Rivera’s unselfish devotion 
to the people of this great Nation. 
The challenges will be many and the time, 
although it may seem like an eternity, will fly 
by almost unnoticed. 
South Mississippi is proud of Rivera and his 
accomplishments, and we look forward to him 
continuing to represent not only Mississippi, 
but the entire Nation, as a United States Air 
Force Officer. 
As Second Lieutenant Rivera embarks on a 
new chapter in life, it is my hope that he may 
always recall, with a deep sense of pride and 
accomplishment, graduating from a program 
as prestigious as the Air Force Academy. 
I would like to send Rivera my best wishes 
for continued success in his future endeavors, 
thank him for his service, and congratulate 
him on this momentous occasion. 
Semper Fidelis.

TRIBUTE TO THE MONTROSE 
SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Montrose Search and Rescue 
Team, in Montrose, California upon its sev-
enty-fifth anniversary. 
Over its 75-year history, the Montrose 
Search and Rescue Team has come to the 
aid of citizens lost or injured in the mountains 
locally and statewide, and through their con-
sistent efforts, these brave men and women 
have saved countless lives. 
Originally called the Montrose Mountaineers, 
this organization was formed in 1947 by a 
group of Civilian Air Defense members to as-
sist people who became lost or injured in the 
local mountains. The team has since extended 
its aid outside the Los Angeles area, traveling 
throughout California to help in rescue or re-
covery efforts. 
As one of eight non-profit, volunteer rescue 
teams affiliated with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriffs Department, the team is on call 24 
hours a day to rescue stranded hikers, natural 
disaster victims, and other individuals in need 
of help. Receiving many calls each year, the 
group is one of the most active search and 
rescue teams in Los Angeles County. As part 
of their service, team members also conduct 
searches for downed aircraft, rescue people 
stuck in tunnels, mines, and underground util-
ity vaults, and evacuate citizens from cars 
which have fallen off mountain roads.

These volunteer heroes, who come from a 
variety of professions, serve their community 
without asking for anything in exchange. They 
search through rubble, scale cliffsides, and 
brave surging waters to save lives. Their self-
less dedication and invaluable service provide

I consider it a great privilege to recognize 
the Montrose Search and Rescue Team, and 
I ask all Members to join me in congratulating 
the team upon its seventy-fifth anniversary.

HONORING ROBERT LAMAR 
ANDERSON 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a loving husband, dedi-
cated father, doting grandfather, Air Force Vet-
eran, trailblazing banker, tireless community 
servant and dear friend of longstanding, Rob-
ert 
Lamar 
Anderson. 
Sadly, 
Robert 
transitioned from labor to reward on Sep-
tember 1, 2022, and a celebration of his re-
markable life was held at 10:00 a.m. on Satur-
day, September 10, 2022 at Christ Community 
Church, 4078 Milgen Road, in Columbus, 
Georgia. 
Robert Anderson was born to the union of 
the late Luther and Mary Anderson in 1942. 
He was a proud product of the Muscogee 
County School System, graduating from Spen-
cer High School in 1960. A very learned man, 
Robert graduated from Fort Valley State Col-
lege, now Fort Valley State University, in 1970 
with a B.S. Degree in Education. Robert went 
on to earn his M.S. in Education from Georgia 
State University and later attended the Stonier 
Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers Uni-
versity. 
Robert served his country faithfully, in The 
United States Air Force from 1964 to 1967, re-
ceiving an Honorable Discharge with the rank 
of Sergeant. He spent a year working as a Bi-
ology Teacher with the Muscogee County 
School District before launching a new career 
that would change his life and community for-
ever. 
In 1971, Robert became a trailblazing bank-
er with Columbus Bank and Trust, becoming 
one of the first African American banking offi-
cers in Columbus, Georgia. In 2007, after 36 
remarkable years, he retired as Senior Vice 
President for Government and Community Af-
fairs, having worked his way up the ranks and 
having used his positions to help those who 
would not otherwise have a chance to finance 
and pursue their dreams. I was one of those 
with whom Robert took a chance when he 
helped finance my first business loan to start 
my law practice in 1972. There are countless 
other businesses in the Chattahoochee Valley 
area that would never have been, were it not 
for Robert Anderson. He worked with soldiers 
and veterans to support their financial needs 
and in the process enhanced their lives and 
service to their country. 
Even after retiring from Columbus Bank and 
Trust, Robert did not rest on his laurels. He 
rejoined the workforce as President of the Co-
lumbus Division of Citizens Trust Bank from 
2009 to 2011; served as a member of the Ad-
junct Faculty of Miller-Motte College from 2012 
to 2014; then ended his career where he start-
ed, in the classroom, as a substitute teacher 
for the Muscogee County School District from 
2014 to 2018. 
Robert loved serving his community. The 
foundation for that service was laid when he 
joined Omega Psi Phi Fraternity at Fort Valley 
State College—now Fort Valley State Univer-
sity. He embodied the Fraternity’s Motto that 
‘‘Friendship is essential to the soul.’’ He never 
met a stranger and befriended all he met. 
He gave his time and talents to many worth-
while causes to include his beloved Omega 
Psi Phi Fraternity’s Lamba Iota Chapter; The 
Chattahoochee Sports Hall of Fame; Cam-
paign Chair, Committee to Elect State Rep-
resentative Calvin Smyre; Leadership Colum-
bus; Columbus Jaycees; The Historic Colum-
bus Foundation; The Columbus Museum 
Board of Directors; Controller’s Civic and So-
cial Club; Allied Students at Fort Benning; 
Chattahoochee Valley Libraries; Muscogee 
County School Board; Georgia School Board 
Association and numerous others. 
His love for our nation’s armed forces and 
for youth fueled his passion for service on the 
Second Congressional District’s Academy Se-
lection Committee for many years, identifying 
young men and women to attend the United 
States Military Service Academies to become 
the future leaders in defense of American de-
mocracy. For this, our country will forever be 
grateful. 
Robert was a lover of the Arts. He served 
on the board of the Liberty Theatre Cultural 
Center in Columbus, Georgia for many years, 
working tirelessly to keep the doors open and 
earning the distinction of ‘‘Chairman Emer-
itus.’’ 
Most importantly, Robert Anderson was a 
man of faith. He was a faithful member of the 
South Columbus United Methodist Church, a 
certified Lay Leader and District Lay Leader 
for the Northwest District of the United Meth-
odist Church. Robert also used his warm, 
deep, bass-baritone voice to sing praises to 
God in numerous United Methodist Church 
choirs. Jackie Robinson once said that: ‘‘A life 
is not important except in the impact it has on 
other lives.’’ Robert Anderson’s life was impor-
tant because of the many lives that he 
touched in service to God and humanity. 
Robert loved his family and they were the 
center of his life. His success in no small part 
was due to the love and support of his wife of 
35+ years, Louise Anderson; his children, Yo-
landa Anderson, Veronica Anderson-Lewis, 
Tawana Anderson and Dr. Shae Anderson; his 
grandchildren, Blake L.A. Richardson and Al-
exandria Lily Frances-Anderson. 
On a personal note, Robert was my friend 
for over 50 years. He had a heart of gold, al-
ways encouraging, supporting, and offering 
sage advice and counsel. I will forever cherish 
his friendship and support. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife Viv-
ian and me, along with the more than 730,000 
people of the Second Congressional District in 
honoring and celebrating the life and legacy of 
Mr. Robert Lamar Anderson. We extend our 
deepest condolences to his family, friends and 
all who mourn his loss. May we all be con-
soled and comforted by our faith in the Holy 
Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead. 
RECOGNIZING THE NOVA SPARK 
FOUNDATION 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Nova Spark Foundation for its 
efforts collecting and donating critical supplies 
to Ukrainian orphanages and children dis-
placed by the war in Ukraine. 
Founded by Ukrainian immigrants in Colo-
rado, Yulia Boozer and Olga Funk, Nova 
Spark was established to help an extremely 
vulnerable 
group 
of 
Ukrainians: 
children 
whose parents have been killed during the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yulia and Olga 
recognized a lack of support for orphans of 
the war and built this organization to fill that 
need. 
Nova Spark works with small-scale and fam-
ily-style orphanages, and those caring for dis-
abled children in Ukraine. Their fundraising ini-
tiatives have allowed Nova Spark to provide 
funding to orphanages and foster homes to re-
pair physical damages sustained during the 
war. 
Additionally, 
the 
organization 
has 
partnered with Project C.U.R.E. to send Kits 
for Kids, providing basic necessities, humani-
tarian aid, STEM toys, baby supplies and col-
lege essentials, for displaced orphans across 
Ukraine. 
Orphans are among the most vulnerable 
victims of war, and I commend Nova Spark for 
its continued efforts to provide orphanages 
with various necessities as supply lines and 
availability of products in Ukraine change. I 
am proud to recognize them for their tireless 
work and dedication to Ukrainian children. It is 
organizations like the Nova Spark Foundation 
that provide hope in the darkest of times, and 
I know that their generosity is not only felt in 
Ukraine, but in our global community as a 
whole.

Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to pay tribute to a faithful and 
cherished public servant from my home State 
of Louisiana. It saddens me that patriarch and 
civil rights trailblazer, Honorable Moon Lan-
drieu, passed away on September 5, 2022. 
While being a member of the Democratic 
Party and an American lawyer, Honorable 
Landrieu represented New Orleans’ Twelfth 
Ward in the Louisiana House of Representa-
tives from 1960 to 1966. He later served on 
the New Orleans City Council as an at-large 
member from 1966 to 1970; elected as the 
56th Mayor of New Orleans from 1970 to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E925 
September 13, 2022 
1978; United States Cabinet Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development from 1979 to 
1982 during Jimmy Carter’s Administration; 
and judge of the Louisiana 4th Circuit Court of 
Appeals from 1992 to 2000. 
He was born, Maurice Edwin ‘‘Moon’’ Lan-
drieu on July 23, 1930, a native of Uptown 
New Orleans to Joseph and Loretta Bechtel 
Landrieu with one older brother, Joseph Lan-
drieu, Jr. He graduated from Jesuit High 
School and attended Loyola University New 
Orleans on a baseball scholarship, serving as 
a team pitcher. During his undergraduate 
years, Moon was inspired by the social justice 
teachings of the Jesuits, which exposed him to 
the cruelty of segregation and was elected 
student body president. Moon graduated in 
1952 earning his Bachelor of Arts in business 
administration and went on to Loyola New Or-
leans’ Law School to receive his Juris Doctor 
in 1954. 
Upon completion of his schooling, Moon 
married Verna Satterlee and joined the United 
States Army in 1954 serving as a second lieu-
tenant in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps 
until 1957, after completing his army service, 
Moon returned home and opened a law prac-
tice while teaching accounting classes. After 
being 
heavily 
involved 
in 
organizations 
throughout the community, Moon decided to 
seek public office and won a seat in the Lou-
isiana State Legislature in 1960 representing 
New Orleans’ Twelfth Ward. Moon relied on 
his teachings and upbringing as he stood in 
strong opposition to the onslaught of Jim Crow 
legislation that was being introduced. Moon 
went on to serve in the New Orleans City 
Council in 1966 and continued to combat seg-
regation by successfully outlawing segregation 
in public accommodations. 
He then went on to be elected the 56th 
Mayor of the City of New Orleans, receiving 
support from 99 percent of the black voters. 
During his tenure in office, Moon upheld his 
campaign promise of honesty, integrity, and 
respect for all people by overseeing the de-
segregation of city government and public fa-
cilities while encouraging integration through-
out New Orleans’ private businesses and pro-
fessional organizations. He intentionally and 
strategically appointed Black New Orleanians 
to leadership positions within city government 
and transformed the economy by investing in 
hospitality and tourism. Moon oversaw major 
investments in Jackson Square and the 
French Quarter, the development of the Lou-
isiana Superdome, and revitalization of the 
New Orleans Central Business District. He 
learned from previous administrations and 
sought to protect and preserve housing in his-
toric neighborhoods through the creation of 
the Historic District Landmarks Commission in 
1976. Moon also served as president of the 
United States Conference of Mayors during 
his term. 
Moon didn’t stop there—he was appointed 
and served as the cabinet secretary of the 
United States Department of Housing and 
Urban Development from 1979 to 1981 during 
the Carter administration. After returning home 
and running his private practice, Moon was 
elected to serve as a Louisiana 4th Circuit 
Court of Appeals judge from 1992 until his re-
tirement in 2000, completing 30 years of pub-
lic service. Moon was inducted into the Lou-
isiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in 
2004. 
He is survived by his wife of 67 blessed 
years, Verna; nine remarkable children, Mary 
Landrieu, Mark Landrieu, Melanie Landrieu 
Cook, Michelle ‘‘Shelly’’ Landrieu, Mitch Lan-
drieu, Madeleine Landrieu, Martin Landrieu, 
Melinda Landrieu Seiter, and Maurice Lan-
drieu; and 37 grandchildren and 15 great 
grandchildren. who affectionally called him 
‘‘Pawpaw’’. 
Madam Speaker, I will always cherish the 
sage advice Mayor Moon Landrieu gave me 
when I was first elected to the Louisiana State 
House of Representatives. I am certain that 
his wisdom, advice, and political endorsement 
has carried me to this day as a Member of 
Congress. We must honor the great leaders of 
our past. They have stood as a shining light 
during the darkest times in our nation’s his-
tory. Therefore, I celebrate Moon’s tenure as 
a leader in the great City of New Orleans, 
State of Louisiana, and United States of Amer-
ica.

HOMETOWN HERO—AVERY HILL 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown 
Hero of the week, Avery Hill, an avid reader 
and young woman who has gone above and 
beyond to better our community. 
Avery began volunteering with Exodus Min-
istries, a nonprofit designed to transform the 
lives of previously incarcerated mothers and 
their children. While volunteering at the Exo-
dus House—a transitional house for the moth-
ers and their children—she noticed the chil-
dren’s library shelves were bare. Inspired to 
share her passion for reading with underprivi-
leged children, Avery took action. 
During the onset of the COVID pandemic, 
Avery began organizing book drives. She 
spread the word around her community to 
leave any books, games, or elementary school 
supplies on their doorsteps, where she would 
then go door to door to pick them up. 
After organizing all of the donations, Avery 
not only stocked the library’s shelves with 600 
new books, but revamped it by adding a 
mural, new curtains, 300 building blocks, and 
50 games. 
Avery’s story should serve as an inspiration 
to all of us to not only give back to our com-
munity but leave it better than when we found 
it. 
I wish Avery the best of luck as she heads 
off to college this fall and thank her for her 
dedication to helping our fellow North Texans.

CELEBRATING THE CITY OF 
HOLLISTER 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 13, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the sesquicentennial anniversary 
of the founding of the city of Hollister, Cali-
fornia. For the last 150 years, the city of Hol-
lister has been shaped by the people who call 
it home. Hollister is a strong and vibrant com-
munity that serves as the San Benito County 
seat and is an integral part of the fabric of the 
Central Coast. 
In 1868, the San Justo Homestead Associa-
tion purchased the San Justo Ranch from 
Colonel William Welles Hollister, a major land-
holder for whom the town would be named. 
The Homestead Association divided the San 
Justo Ranch into plots to be auctioned to set-
tlers and set the boundaries of what would 
then become the city of Hollister. On August 
6, 1872, residents submitted a petition to the 
Monterey Courthouse for a town charter. Hol-
lister held its first election for the city’s Board 
of Trustees just eleven days later, on August 
17, 1872. 
Hollister is a strong and resilient community. 
On October 17, 1989, the Loma Prieta Earth-
quake left much of the downtown area in ruins 
and caused millions of dollars in damages. But 
Hollister took the disaster in stride and re-
bounded. The community of Hollister has 
more than doubled since the earthquake, and 
it boasts a vibrant downtown, including many 
civil society groups such as the San Benito 
County Historical Society and the Hollister 
Downtown Association. 
Famed for its wineries, ranchlands, and the 
high-quality 75 different vegetable, vine, and 
orchard crops it produces, Hollister continues 
to be a regional center for agriculture. As it 
was when it was founded, Hollister’s verdant 
fields, vineyards, and pastures augment the 
natural beauty of the Central Coast. The re-
gion is renowned for its breathtaking vistas, 
from Pinnacles National Park to Hollister’s pic-
turesque hills. These unparalleled views at-
tract thousands of visitors every year who 
come to appreciate all the beauty that Hollister 
has to offer. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to ask 
my colleagues to join me in commemorating 
the city of Hollister for 150 exceptional years 
and in wishing Hollister continued success in 
the years to come.
