PRAYER 
Rev. Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Capitol 
Worship, Washington, D.C., offered the 
following prayer: 
He who reigns from Heaven’s throne, 
we stand before you, Eternal God, on 
the eve of this 59th quadrennial Presi-
dential election, exercising our sacred 
and consecrated gift of democracy, the 
right to vote; a sacred and peaceful 
demonstration consecrated by patriots’ 
blood, codified by the Framers within 
the Constitution to their ultimate de-
votion. 
So let us, every citizen, dutifully 
seek Your wisdom; ‘‘for when the right-
eous are in authority, the people re-
joice, but when the wicked rule, they 
mourn.’’ 
Just as Jethro instructed the law-
giver Moses, whose image ever watches 
over this Chamber: ‘‘Choose out able 
leaders, such as fear God, lovers of 
truth, hating covetousness’’ to rule 
over Israel; may we too choose wisely. 
And when pestilence afflicts us, You 
promised King Solomon to heal our 
land if we would humble ourselves and 
turn from our wicked ways. So let us 
turn, that You, Merciful Father, may 
heal. 
In Jesus’ name, Amen.

E1003 
November 2, 2020 
IN HONOR OF MAYOR CURTISTENE 
SMITH MCCOWAN 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 2, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and honor the life of 
Mrs. Curtistene Smith McCowan, Mayor of 
DeSoto, Texas, who passed away on October 
28, 2020. 
Mayor McCowan’s experience in public 
service was commendable, and the extension 
of her influence cannot be measured by the 
positions she held—of which there were many. 
Among her laudable achievements included 
Mayor 
of 
DeSoto, 
DeSoto 
City 
Councilmember, President of the DeSoto Eco-
nomic Development Cooperation Board of Di-
rectors, Founder and President of the Con-
cerned DeSoto Citizens nonprofit, and Chair of 
the Trustee Board at the Kirkwood Temple 
Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, just to 
name a few. Even in the 21st Century, Mrs. 
McCowan was the first African American elect-
ed to public office in DeSoto and the first 
woman to hold the office of mayor. 
In our countless meetings together, Mayor 
McCowan and I always left with a greater un-
derstanding and appreciation for one another’s 
perspectives. We shared the same vision for 
the future of DeSoto where its citizens and in-
stitutions flourished under her fervent leader-
ship. During her tenure, Mayor McCowan 
made significant strides towards access for 
quality education, fiscal accountability, and the 
economic development of the city, among sev-
eral other initiatives. 
Mayor McCowan saw adversity as simply a 
bump in the road—a necessary hurdle on the 
way to success. She met her challenges, both 
personal and public, with a fierce, yet gentle 
tenacity. When announcing her cancer diag-
nosis during a city council meeting in early 
October 2020, she made it clear that her pri-
ority would remain the wellbeing of DeSoto 
and its residents during these trying times. 
‘‘I’ve always said that when we work together, 
there’s nothing that we can’t accomplish,’’ she 
remarked during that meeting. It is in that spirit 
that we carry on her legacy, so that genera-
tions to come may feel the significant impact 
of her life. 
Mayor McCowan is survived by her husband 
of 54 years, Leon R. McCowan, two sons, and 
three grandchildren. Also among her progeny 
include 
the 
students 
of 
Curtistene 
S. 
McCowan Middle School and the many of us 
she inspired along the way. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Texas 
Congressional Delegation and this legislative 
body, I compassionately extend my sincere 
condolences to the McCowan family, friends 
and loved ones. We know that DeSoto is a 
better place because of the well-lived life of 
Mayor Curtistene Smith McCowan. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF JESSIE WOLF 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 2, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and service of Jessie Wolf, 
former Sheriff of Tyler County, professional 
football player, and servant of his community. 
Jessie was born on March 4, 1952, to John 
and Annie Mae Wolf in Warren, Texas. He 
was a long-time resident of Tyler County and 
graduated from Warren High School in 1970. 
For nearly three decades, Jessie ensured the 
safety of more than 21,000 residents of Tyler 
County serving as a law enforcement officer. 
He is remembered by many for his infectious 
personality and was loved deeply by the com-
munity of which he worked tirelessly to keep 
safe after an impressive career playing profes-
sional football. 
Jessie played college football and was a 
weight thrower for the track and field team at 
Prairie View A&M University. Following his col-
lege graduation, he was recruited by the 
World Football League where he played for 
the Birmingham Vulcans. A year later, he was 
drafted into the National Football League 
(NFL) by the Miami Dolphins and helped lead 
the team to a Super Bowl championship in 
1974. After his time with the Dolphins, he went 
on to play for two other NFL teams, the Wash-
ington Redskins and the Baltimore Colts. In 
2014, Jessie was inducted into his alma mat-
er’s Sport’s Hall of Fame. 
Following his departure from the NFL, Jes-
sie moved back to Tyler County and began his 
career in law enforcement. After many years 
of service, he assumed the position of Chief 
Deputy in the early 2000s and stepped in as 
acting Sheriff for Tyler County in 2005. Jessie 
made history as the first African American 
sheriff of Tyler County and held that position 
until his retirement. 
He married the love of his life, Mary 
Cravens Wolf, in 2007, and they spent many 
wonderful years together. Throughout his time 
in law enforcement, Jessie made sure that the 
safety and wellbeing of the community he 
swore to protect remained top priority. In addi-
tion to his love of football and police service, 
Jessie enjoyed spending time with his family 
and his beloved six grandchildren. 
Jessie is preceded in death by his parents, 
John Wolf Sr. and Annie Mae Deason Wolf; 
sister Maggie Lena Wolf Foster; and two 
brothers, James and Joe Wolf. He is survived 
by his wife, Margie Wolf; two daughters, 
Denise Wright and Shannon Dugas; brother 
Elray Wolf; two sisters, Beatrice Williams and 
Verdie Wolf; and six grandchildren, DeAndre 
Bell, Kayla Bell, Derrick Wright, Erik Wright, 
Isaiah Wright, and Rashaad Young. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Jessie Wolf for his 
faithful service to our community and county; 
and my heartfelt prayers remain with his family 
and friends during this difficult time. 
IN HONOR OF THOMAS MCCARTHY, 
ABINGTON 
AND 
WHITMAN 
MA 
VETERANS’ SERVICE OFFICER 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 2, 2020 
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Thomas McCarthy, in recognition of 
his outstanding contributions to the Towns of 
Abington and Whitman, the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, and the United States of 
America. 
The son of James and Jane McCarthy of 
Abington, Tom was born on May 11, 1958. He 
was raised on Plymouth Street in Abington, 
and he attended South Shore Vocational Tech 
High School in Hanover. He attended South-
ern Washington University, earning a bach-
elor’s degree in Criminal Justice in 1979. 
Tom served in the United States Marine 
Corps for thirty years (1976 to 2006), retiring 
with the rank of Sergeant Major. Over the 
course of his service in the United States Ma-
rine Corps, Tom attended the Military Police 
Academy and was assigned to the Military Po-
lice for twenty-six years. Upon his retirement, 
he returned to Abington. 
Tom then worked for A-Prime Steel, a spe-
cialty steel company from 2007 to 2008 in ad-
dition to driving for Dunbar Armor, a private 
security company. Subsequently, Tom worked 
at Sears as a sales associate and then as an 
assistant manager in the automobile service 
department. In 2012, Tom began his service 
as the part-time Veterans’ Service Officer for 
the towns of Abington and Whitman. He was 
promoted to Director of Veterans’ Services in 
2017. Tom is a life member of the Disabled 
American Veterans Chapter 119, in Whitman, 
where he served as Post Commander from

Madam Speaker, Tom is known for his com-
passion, his kind smile, his quick sense of 
humor, his storytelling, and his affection for 
Dunkin’ Donuts Iced Coffee. He is an avid 
freshwater fisherman and has participated in 
many firearms shooting competitions over the 
years. He has had the good fortune to be mar-
ried to Jenny for forty-one years. 
His passionate advocacy for veterans set an 
example to all who worked with him, and I ex-
tend my sincere congratulations and apprecia-
tion to him upon his retirement. It is my dis-
tinct honor to join with Tom McCarthy’s family, 
friends and contemporaries to thank him for 
his service to the United States and to the vet-
erans of Abington and Whitman, Massachu-
setts.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF 
JOE FRANCO 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 2, 2020 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to celebrate and honor the distinguished 
service 
of 
my 
constituent, 
Joe 
Franco. 
Throughout his years, Joe has diligently 
worked to improve and protect American com-
munities, including ours in Central Wash-
ington. 
A native of Carlsbad, New Mexico, Joe first 
served our nation in the United States Navy 
before his distinguished career in nuclear 
waste cleanup. He began working at the 
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant at the Department 
of Energy’s field office in 1989. Over the 
years, he became an experienced operative in 
federal nuclear energy projects, and in 2006, 
he brought his talents to Central Washington’s 
Richland Operations Office at the Hanford 
Site, where he was ultimately named Deputy 
Manager. 
During his service as a federal employee, 
Joe’s work was crucial to our nation’s ongoing 
nuclear cleanup efforts. He is an example of 
the country’s best and brightest minds hard at 
work advancing the Department of Energy’s 
mission to protect our environment and 
strengthen our national security. 
On behalf of Central Washington, I salute 
Joe for his significant contributions to the 
greater Tri-Cities community and to the United 
States.
