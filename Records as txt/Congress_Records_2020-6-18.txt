Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2020 
No. 113 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of love and mercy, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
While cases of coronavirus spike in so 
many States still, and in many places 
crowds gather still, we turn to You 
once again to listen to our pleas. Our 
differences provide much heat but lit-
tle light. 
As healthcare professionals labor to 
treat those who are ill, and spend their 
days seeking a treatment and vaccine, 
inspire them with Your wisdom and 
give them enlightenment that their la-
bors might be met with success. May 
they be encouraged by all our citizens 
as we take responsibility for pre-
venting the spread of this deadly dis-
ease. 
Bless us with Your love, for more 
love is needed now. It is not the sever-
ity of strict justice that engenders 
love. It is the respect of one another 
and the honoring of those who give 
their lives in service to our commu-
nities. Regrettably, we know they 
labor alongside some who have forgot-
ten or betrayed their mission. 
Bring us together in these conten-
tious times. Bless our Congress with 
wisdom and good will that far-reaching 
solutions might be found to address 
these times. 
Bless us all this day and every day, 
and may all that we do be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

S3073 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2020 
No. 113 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our hearts are steadfast 
toward You. Lead us safely to the ref-
uge of Your choosing, for You desire to 
give us a future and a hope. 
Lord, provide us with grateful hearts 
to appreciate Your mercies that are 
new each day. Today, give our Senators 
the power to do Your will as they real-
ize more fully that they are servants of 
Heaven and stewards of Your mys-
teries. Give them perspectives on their 
daily tasks and every decision they 
must make. Remind them that people 
usually don’t care how much You know 
until they know how much You care. 
May faithfulness to You become the 
litmus test by which our lawmakers 
evaluate each action. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to address the 
Senate for 1 minute in morning busi-
ness. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IOWA GRADUATIONS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
once again, I am proud to come to tell 
you something about the history of 
Iowa, and I do this during a hectic time 
of the COVID–19 crisis. That crisis has 
had, for American educational systems, 
quite an impact. So, at this time, it is 
important to highlight some successes. 
The 2018–2019 school year saw the 
highest 
4-year 
graduation 
rate 
in 
Iowa’s history, and that percentage 
was at 91.6 percent. In 2017, Iowa had 
the highest graduation rate in the en-
tire country, and with this achieve-
ment, we appear ready to do it again. 
During my time representing Iowa in 
the U.S. Senate, I had been in many of 
our State’s classrooms and have seen 
firsthand the dedication of Iowa’s edu-
cators. I congratulate all of those in-
volved with Iowa schools on their fan-
tastic work and congratulate them for 
doing it at all times, even over the past 
few months, in particular, because of 
all the situations they have run into 
because of the virus pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the Senate has been confronting issues 
of historic importance on the home-
front. 
Just since March, we sent historic re-
sources to the healthcare fight against 
COVID–19 on an overwhelming bipar-
tisan basis. We passed the largest res-
cue package in American history on a 
bipartisan basis. We just passed a gen-
erational bill for our public lands, also 
on a bipartisan basis. 
Yesterday, the junior Senator from 
South Carolina introduced a major pro-
posal to reform policing and promote 
racial justice. If our colleagues across 
the aisle can put politics aside and join 
us in a real discussion, then on this 
issue, too, we should be able to make 
law on a bipartisan basis. 
The Senate has led and is leading the 
way toward serious solutions. At the 
same time, developments around the 
world continue to remind us that the 
safety and interests of the American 
people are also threatened from beyond 
our shores. Just 2 weeks ago, I ex-
plained how the Chinese Communist 
Party has used the pandemic they 
helped worsen as a smokescreen for 
ratcheting up their oppression in Hong 
Kong and advancing their control and 
influence throughout the region. It 
hasn’t stopped. 
At sea, they have stepped up their 
menacing of Japan near the Senkaku 
Islands. In the skies, Chinese jets have 
intruded into Taiwanese airspace four 
separate times in a matter of days. On 
land, for the sake of grabbing territory, 
the PLA appears to have instigated the 
worst violent clash between China and 
India since those nations went to war 
way back in 1962. 
Needless to say, the rest of the world 
has watched with grave concern this 
violent exchange between two nuclear 
states. We are encouraging deescala-
tion and hoping for peace. The world 
could not have received a clearer re-
minder that the PRC is dead set on 
brutalizing people within their own 
borders—challenging and remaking the 
international 
order 
anew 
in 
their 
image, to include literally redrawing 
world maps. Of course, this is not ex-
actly breaking news to any of us who 
have been paying attention. 
Earlier this year, the Senate passed 
legislation to give the administration 
new tools to directly punish the CCP 
for its egregious—egregious treatment 
of the Uighur people and the modern- 
day gulags it has constructed there in 
the Xinjiang Province. The President 
signed it into law yesterday. 
Going back to the United States- 
Hong Kong Policy Act, which I wrote 
back in 1992, the Senate has main-
tained a keen interest in the freedom 
and autonomy of our friends in that 
city. Unfortunately, Beijing has con-
tinued to tighten its grip there as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3074 
June 18, 2020 
More 
and 
more 
Hongkongers 
find 
themselves facing an agonizing deci-
sion: Can they remain in the city they 
love or must they flee elsewhere if they 
want their children to grow up free? 
As I have said often, every nation 
that cares about democracy and sta-
bility has a stake in ensuring that Bei-
jing’s actions in Hong Kong carry con-
sequences. I encourage the administra-
tion to use the tools Congress has 
given it and to work with like-minded 
nations to impose those costs, but pun-
ishing the PRC cannot be our only pri-
ority. We also need to actively help the 
people of Hong Kong. 
Led by Prime Minister Boris John-
son, the United Kingdom says they are 
preparing to offer visas to potentially 
millions of Hongkongers. In addition to 
funding democracy programming and 
supporting legal assistance, we must 
also 
consider 
ways 
to 
welcome 
Hongkongers and other Chinese dis-
sidents to America. 
Chinese Americans have formed part 
of the backbone of our Nation for about 
two centuries. Against headwinds of ra-
cial prejudice, Chinese immigrants lit-
erally helped build modern America as 
we know it. Generations of Chinese 
Americans have enriched our society 
and fueled our economic prosperity. 
Not surprisingly, I am particularly par-
tial to the Secretary of Transpor-
tation, whose parents fled Communist 
rule. She has served her country across 
four Presidential administrations, in-
cluding as the first Chinese American 
to ever serve in a President’s Cabinet. 
If 
some 
of 
the 
same 
brave 
Hongkongers who have stood up for lib-
erty waving our American flag and 
singing our American national anthem 
would like to come here and join us, we 
should welcome them warmly. 
Of course, this Senate is not only 
acting with respect to China. Earlier 
this year, at my urging, the Senate en-
acted the Caesar Syria Civilian Protec-
tion Act, and this week, the adminis-
tration is using these tools to impose 
painful new sanctions on the brutal re-
gime of Bashar Assad. 
With the help of Russian airpower, 
Iranian advisers, and manpower from 
Hezbollah terrorists, Assad has recap-
tured military control of most of the 
territory he had lost during 9 years of 
civil war, but he has effectively de-
stroyed his own country in an effort to 
save his regime. 
Assad faces renewed protests across 
the country, infighting within his re-
gime and family, and a Syrian econ-
omy that is in free fall. Because of this 
Congress and this administration, the 
cashflow to these butchers is going to 
shrink, and the price that leaders and 
businessmen in Tehran, Beirut, Cairo, 
Moscow, and Beijing will have to pay 
to do business with the regime will 
grow. 
These new steps will help us achieve 
our objective: creating leverage for dip-
lomats and our partners on the ground 
to negotiate a political solution and fi-
nally end the war. To maintain this 
pressure, we should keep our limited 
physical presence in Syria. We should 
work to bring our NATO ally Turkey 
back onto the right side, and we should 
preserve the deterrence that President 
Trump has rebuilt against Iran, to 
keep checking their influence in Syria 
and throughout the Middle East. 
f 
NOMINATION OF JUSTIN REED 
WALKER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on one final matter, later today, the 
Senate 
will 
confirm 
Judge 
Justin 
Walker of Kentucky to join the DC Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals. 
Now, as I have noted in just the last 
several weeks, Judge Walker has given 
the Senate several new reasons to sup-
port his nomination to the second most 
important Federal bench. 
In testimony before our colleagues on 
the Judiciary Committee, he dem-
onstrated an impressive grasp of legal 
precedent. At his current post as dis-
trict judge for the Western District of 
Kentucky, he eloquently applied this 
understanding to uphold Americans’ 
religious liberty, and he earned the ap-
proval of the American Bar Association 
with a rating of ‘‘well-qualified.’’ 
But, of course, Judge Walker’s cre-
dentials were already sterling. Long 
before this nominee began practicing 
and then applying the law, he was col-
lecting plaudits for his excellence at 
studying it. 
Judge Walker, as I mentioned before, 
graduated 
from 
Duke 
University 
summa cum laude, and Harvard Law 
School magna cum laude. Those cre-
dentials can easily lead someone to an 
elite law firm in a big city, but instead, 
it led Judge Walker to clerkships for 
then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh and then- 
Justice Anthony Kennedy. 
He then went back home to the Uni-
versity of Louisville Law School. He 
quickly became a star faculty member, 
producing distinguished scholarship on 
a wide range of legal issues. Once 
Judge Walker took his current seat on 
the bench for the Western District of 
Kentucky, he wasted no time building 
an equally strong reputation for the 
fairness 
and 
open-mindedness 
that 
Americans deserve from their judges. 
In one letter to our colleagues on the 
Judiciary Committee, 100 practicing 
lawyers from across Kentucky said: 
If Judge Walker is confirmed, we could 
give our clients an assessment of him for 
which any judge should strive: he is sharp, 
fair, and will follow the law. 
In another letter, 16 different State 
attorneys general told us: 
As someone from outside the Beltway with 
a commitment to the rule of law, we know 
that Judge Walker will listen to the argu-
ments of advocates appearing before him, 
that he will weigh the facts against the law 
as it is written (and not as he wishes it to 
be), and that he will fairly decide those cases 
based upon controlling precedent. 
These glowing assessments are not 
from elite corporate counsel or fre-
quent flyers on the DC Circuit. These 
are from men and women across Ken-
tucky and across America who have 
seen this man work and watched his 
career. 
Republican Presidents have a proud 
tradition of looking beyond Wash-
ington to freshen up the DC Circuit 
with diverse perspectives from across 
America. President Nixon thought this 
crucial court could use the expertise of 
a Texan and a Minnesotan. President 
Reagan chose legal minds from Colo-
rado and North Carolina. President 
Bush 41 chose a South Carolinian, and 
President Bush 43 a Californian. 
So when the Senate confirms Judge 
Walker to this vacancy, we will not 
just be promoting a widely admired 
legal expert and proven judge to a role 
for which he is obviously qualified, we 
will also be adding to a time-honored 
tradition of finding men and women 
from all across the country to help en-
sure that this enormously consequen-
tial bench here in our Nation’s Capital 
is refreshed with talent from all parts 
of America. 
My fellow Kentuckians and I are 
sorry to part with this son in the Blue-
grass, but mostly we are proud because 
Judge Walker will be putting his legal 
brilliance and his exceptional judicial 
temperament to work not just for his 
home State but for our entire Nation 
and in even more consequential ways. I 
look forward to voting to confirm 
Judge Justin Walker, and I urge each 
of my colleagues to do the same.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
DACA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
cried tears of joy a few minutes ago 
when I heard the decision of the Su-
preme Court on DACA. These wonder-
ful DACA kids and their families have 
a huge burden lifted off their shoulders. 
They don’t have to worry about being 
deported. They can do their jobs, and I 
believe—I do believe this—someday, 
someday soon, they will be American 
citizens. 
I have met so many of these beautiful 
children and their families. Now, many 
have grown up. They came to America 
as little kids, and all they want to be 
is Americans. They worked hard. I met 
some of them during the COVID crisis 
in New York risking their lives to deal 
with the healthcare crisis we had. I 
have seen them enlist in the Armed 
Forces and go to college, some of our 
best colleges and law schools, and 
climb that American ladder that has 
been around for so many years and 
some people want to rip away. 
So this is a wonderful, wonderful day 
for the DACA kids, for their families, 
and for the American Dream. 
We have always believed in immigra-
tion in America. We have had some 
dark forces oppose it in recent years, 
but we believe in it. It is part of our 
soul. Every one of us cares about immi-
grants, and so many of us are descend-
ants of immigrants. Wow, what a deci-
sion. 
Let me say this: In these very dif-
ficult times, the Supreme Court pro-
vided a bright ray of sunshine this 
week with the decision on Monday pre-
venting discrimination in employment 
against the LGBTQ community and 
now with this DACA decision. Frankly, 
to me, the Court’s decision was sur-
prising but welcome. It gives you some 
faith that the laws and rules and mores 
of this country can be upheld. Wow, the 
decision is amazing. I am so happy for 
these kids and their families. I feel for 
them, and I think all of America does. 
Again, 
I 
cannot—who 
would 
have 
thought the Supreme Court would have 
so many good decisions in one week? 
Who would have thought it? Wow. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Madam President, now let’s get to 
some other very important issues as 
well. 
Two weeks ago, House and Senate 
Democrats introduced a bill, the Jus-
tice in Policing Act, to bring sweeping 
change to the Nation’s police depart-
ments. The bill would bring com-
prehensive and enduring reforms—the 
most forceful set of changes to policing 
in decades. 
The House Judiciary Committee ap-
proved the legislation yesterday, and it 
will pass the full House next week. 
Here in the Senate, Republicans put 
forward their own proposal yesterday, 
led by the Senator from South Caro-
lina. We welcome our Republican col-
leagues to this discussion. It is some-
thing they have resisted for so long. 
But merely writing the bill—any bill— 
is not good enough at this moment in 
American history. It is too low a bar. 
To simply say ‘‘We will write any old 
bill, and that is good enough’’ isn’t 
good enough for so many people, many 
of whom are marching in the streets to 
get real justice. 
We don’t need just any bill right now. 
We need a strong bill. We don’t need 
some bipartisan talks. We need to save 
Black lives and bring long-overdue re-
forms to institutions that have resisted 
them. The harsh fact is that the legis-
lation my Republican friends have put 
together is far too weak and will be in-
effective at rooting out this problem. 
The Republican bill does nothing to 
reform the legal standards that shield 
police from convictions for violating 
Americans’ constitutional rights. It 
does nothing on qualified immunity, 
which shields even police who are 
guilty of violating civil rights from 
being sued for civil damages. The Re-
publican bill does nothing to encourage 
independent investigations of police 
departments that have patterns and 
practices that violate the Constitution. 
The Republican bill does nothing to re-
form the use of force standard, nothing 
on racial profiling, nothing on limiting 
the transfer of military equipment to 
local police departments. 
What the Republican bill does pro-
pose does not go far enough. Unlike the 
Justice in Policing Act, which bans no- 
knock warrants in Federal drug cases, 
the Republican bill requires data only 
on no-knock warrants. Breonna Taylor, 
a first responder in Louisville, KY, was 
asleep in her bed when she was killed 
by police who had a no-knock warrant. 
More 
data 
would 
not 
have 
saved 
Breonna Taylor’s life. 
Unlike the Justice in Policing Act, 
which bans choke holds and other tac-
tics that have killed Black Americans, 
the Republican bill purports to ban 
choke holds only by withholding fund-
ing from departments that don’t volun-
tarily 
ban 
them 
themselves—only 
those choke holds that restrict air flow 
but not those choke holds that resist 
blood to flow to the brain—and the ban 
only applies unless the ‘‘use of deadly 
force’’ is required. Who determines 
when the use of deadly force is re-
quired? It is usually the police them-
selves, and courts defer to their judg-
ment. 
I don’t understand. If you want to 
ban choke holds and other brutal tac-
tics that have killed Black Americans 
in police custody, why don’t you just 
ban them? 
I like my friend from South Carolina, 
Senator SCOTT. I know he is trying to 
do the right thing, but this is not just 
about doing any bill. This is not about 
finding the lowest common denomi-
nator between the two parties and then 
moving on. This is about bringing sore-
ly needed change to police departments 
across the country, stopping the kill-
ing of African Americans at the hands 
of police, and bringing accountability 
and transparency to police officers and 
departments that are guilty of mis-
conduct. 
Unfortunately, the Republican bill 
doesn’t go nearly far enough on preven-
tion. It doesn’t go nearly far enough on 
transparency and hardly brings even 
one ounce of accountability, and that 
matters a great deal. We have to get 
this right. 
If we pass a bill that is ineffective, 
the killings continue, and police de-
partments resist change, and there is 
no accountability, the wound in our so-
ciety will not close. It will widen. 
This is not about making an effort 
and dipping our toes into the waters of 
reform. This is about solving a problem 
that is taking the lives of Black Ameri-
cans. 
Let me say that again because it is 
so important for my colleagues across 
the aisle to hear. This is not just about 
making an effort or dipping our toes 
into the waters of reform. This is about 
solving a problem that is taking the 
lives of Black Americans. 
If the bill would not have prevented 
the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, 
Ahmaud 
Arbery, 
Michael 
Brown, or Eric Garner, if it will not 
stop future deaths of Black Americans 
at the hands of the very people who are 
meant to protect and serve, then it 
does not represent the change we need 
now. 
As drafted, the Republican bill does 
not rise to the moment. The Demo-
cratic bill, the Justice in Policing Act, 
does. 
NOMINATION OF JUSTIN REED WALKER 
Madam President, of course, while 
Democrats 
are 
glad 
that 
Leader 
MCCONNELL felt the pressure and heed-
ed our call to put policing reform on 
the floor next week, it will not be be-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3076 
June 18, 2020 
year’s worth of experience as a district 
court judge, to sit on the second high-
est court in the country for the rest of 
his life. The temerity of doing that—he 
was on the court for just a few months, 
but he is friends with Leader MCCON-
NELL, so he gets rushed to this very 
high court without the necessary expe-
rience and maturity of judgment. 
The Republican Senate approved his 
nomination to the district court on Oc-
tober 24 last year, after the ABA rated 
him ‘‘not qualified.’’ Now, 8 months 
later, Leader MCCONNELL wants to give 
Justin Walker, a former intern of his, a 
promotion to the DC Circuit. 
Even in his extremely limited time 
as a jurist, Walker made news by call-
ing the Supreme Court’s decision to up-
hold our healthcare law ‘‘catastrophic’’ 
and ‘‘an indefensible decision.’’ 
I would like Leader MCCONNELL to go 
home to Kentucky and tell the citizens 
of Kentucky why he nominated some-
one who wants to repeal our healthcare 
law when the COVID crisis is hurting 
people there as it is everywhere else. In 
the middle of a national healthcare cri-
sis, the Republican Senate majority is 
poised to confirm a judge who opposes 
our country’s healthcare law. 
There is no reason to do this nomina-
tion now. There is no stunning number 
of vacancies on the DC Circuit. We are 
in the middle of a global pandemic and 
a national conversation about racial 
justice and police reform. This is about 
the Republican leader and his relent-
less pursuit of a rightwing judiciary. 
Usually my friends on the other side 
of the aisle vote in lockstep on these 
judges, so it is an indication of Mr. 
Walker’s caliber, or lack thereof, that 
at least one Senate Republican has an-
nounced opposition to his nomination. 
After Mr. Walker—again, before we 
move 
to 
policing 
reform—Leader 
MCCONNELL will put forward the nomi-
nation of Mr. Cory Wilson to the Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Even by the very low standards of 
Trump’s 
nominees 
to 
the 
Federal 
bench, Mr. Wilson is appalling. He 
called our Nation’s healthcare law ‘‘il-
legitimate’’ and ‘‘perverse’’ and advo-
cated the repeal of Roe v. Wade. Worse 
still, Mr. Wilson strongly supported re-
strictive voting measures, including 
voter ID laws and is opposed, in this 
day and age, to minority voting rights. 
There will be a massive split screen 
in the Senate next week. As we prepare 
to debate legislation to reduce racial 
bias and discrimination in law enforce-
ment, Senate Republicans will push a 
judge who has a history of fighting 
against minority voting rights. The hy-
pocrisy is glaring. It is amazing to 
me—the temerity sometimes that the 
majority leader shows in talking about 
trying to bring racial justice and put-
ting on the bench someone who has 
fought against racial justice in terms 
of voting rights throughout his career. 
Again, the hypocrisy is glaring. 
CHINA 
Madam President, now on China, my 
colleagues know how long I have 
pressed administrations of both parties 
to be tougher on China’s rapacious eco-
nomic policies. For a time, I even 
praised our current President for talk-
ing about going after China’s trade 
abuses, but, as on so many other issues, 
President Trump talks a big game and 
then completely folds. 
After a few months of negotiation, 
President Trump announced his phase 
one trade deal with China, which lifted 
tariffs on Chinese imports in exchange 
for a few short-term agricultural pur-
chases. It was clear at the time that 
President Trump sold out. 
I argued strenuously with the Trade 
Representative, Mr. Lighthizer, about 
the phase one deal. And now, as ex-
cerpts of Mr. Bolton’s book hits the 
press, we see why President Trump 
caved to China so completely. 
The President’s former National Se-
curity Advisor wrote that President 
Trump decided to drop all of our major 
demands on China because he wanted 
agricultural 
purchases 
from 
States 
that would aid his reelection. Mr. 
Bolton alleges that the President want-
ed the support of farmers in key 
States, so he sold out the national in-
terest for his personal political inter-
est. Does it sound familiar, my Senate 
Republican colleagues? Does it sound 
familiar? 
Ironically, of course, American farm-
ers aren’t even getting the benefit be-
cause President Xi has reneged on pur-
chasing American soybeans and wheat. 
When President Trump was so craven 
as to bring this up, it was a signal to 
Xi: You can stand strong, and the 
President will not do anything—will 
not do anything. And that is what hap-
pened, so no one won. American manu-
facturing and American jobs lost out in 
a weak-kneed deal with China, and 
then, even the farmers who were sup-
posed to get benefit, of course, for 
Trump’s political interests, didn’t get 
any benefit. 
While I would have preferred Mr. 
Bolton to have told these stories under 
oath at the impeachment trial, they 
are quite illuminating nonetheless. It 
seems he should have titled his book, 
‘‘The Real Heart of the Deal.’’ 
President Trump’s failure to secure 
an end to China’s predatory intellec-
tual property theft is now explained. 
President Trump’s ridiculous praise of 
how Xi handled the coronavirus is now 
explained. President Trump’s silence 
on human rights abuses and the pro-
tests in Hong Kong is now explained. 
Even more revolting, Mr. Bolton al-
leges that the President approved of 
President Xi’s plan to place up to 1 
million Uighurs into concentration 
camps—possibly the largest intern-
ment of religious or ethnic groups 
since World War II. 
China is America’s competitor to this 
generation and the next, and this 
President’s insecurity, weakness, van-
ity, and obsessive self-interest is a 
threat—a real threat—to our economic 
security and our national security. 
President Trump cannot be trusted to 
deal with China policy any longer. 
DACA 
Madam President, before I yield the 
floor, I spoke earlier about the DACA 
decision and how I thought, first, of 
those wonderful kids and their families 
and the burden that is off their shoul-
ders. But after a few minutes, I dialed 
my dear friend Senator DURBIN. He has 
waged this fight since, I believe—2002? 
Mr. DURBIN. 2000. 
Mr. SCHUMER. 2000. 
He has been passionate and unrelent-
ing in fighting for the DACA kids and 
their families. He talks about it in our 
caucus every week. He did just this 
past week. 
Now, while our work is still not done, 
we must all work so that these kids 
can eventually become American citi-
zens. At least they are free—free at 
last—and, in good part, that is because 
of the work of the senior Senator from 
Illinois, who met them, got to know 
them and love them, and took his 
amazing legislative acumen to help 
them. 
I believe, in part, that the decision 
across the street occurred because of 
Senator DURBIN’s effective and unre-
lenting passionate advocacy for the 
DACA kids. 
I yield the floor to my dear friend 
and a happy man this morning, the 
senior Senator from Illinois. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
want to thank my friend and colleague 
from both the House and the Senate, 
Senator CHUCK
SCHUMER, the Demo-
cratic leader, for his kind words. He 
has been such a valuable ally in this 
battle. 
As leader on the Senate side, CHUCK, 
I just can’t thank you enough. 
Mr. SCHUMER. DICK, the thanks 
goes to you. The thanks goes to you. 
Mr. DURBIN. Time and again, we did 
things here that were difficult politi-
cally—difficult politically—to fight for 
the young people. 
I just want to thank all of the Sen-
ators on both sides of the aisle who 
were a part of moving this issue for-
ward. They did it at great political 
risk. 
I can remember, as sure as I am 
standing here, watching one of my 
Democratic Senate colleagues walk 
down and vote for the Dream Act, re-
turn to her desk in the corner, put her 
head down and sobbed, realizing that 
she had probably cost her own reelec-
tion with that vote. Over and over 
again, people stood up for these young 
people. 
This morning, minutes ago, the Su-
preme Court brought a smile and a sigh 
of relief to more than 700,000 young 
people in the United States of America. 
This morning, the Supreme Court ruled 
that the September 2017 rescission of 
the DACA Program by the Trump ad-
ministration was to be stricken as ar-
bitrary and capricious. 
So what does it mean? It means, for 
these 700,000 DACA-protected individ-
uals, that they can continue to live, to

work, and to study in America without 
fear of deportation for the moment. 
DACA, of course, is a program cre-
ated by President Obama in 2012. It was 
a program that was, frankly, our an-
swer to the failure to enact the 
DREAM Act as the law of the land. The 
President used his Executive authority 
to create the DACA Program, and here 
is what it said, just basically mirroring 
the standards of the DREAM Act, 
which I introduced 20 years ago: If you 
were brought to America as a child, if 
you have lived in this country, gone to 
school, don’t have a serious problem 
with the law, you should have a chance 
to live here without fear of deporta-
tion. The DREAM Act said you should 
have a chance to become a citizen of 
the United States, which is, of course, 
our ultimate goal. 
But the DACA Program opened up 
eligibility, and almost 800,000 came for-
ward and applied. They had to pay a 
filing fee of $500 or $600, go through a 
criminal background check, but for 
many of these young people, it was a 
turning point in their lives. At that 
point, 
finally—finally—there 
was 
a 
chance they could stay in the country 
they called home, the United States of 
America. 
They seized that opportunity and did 
remarkable things. They enlisted in 
our military. They went to schools and 
colleges to pursue an education. They 
took up jobs as teachers. They finished 
medical school. They did things that 
were unimaginable for DACA. 
Of course, when the administration 
changed and a new President came in, 
there was a real question as to whether 
he would continue the DACA Program. 
The very first time I ever spoke to 
President Donald Trump was the day of 
his inauguration, within an hour or 
two after he was sworn, at a luncheon. 
What I said to him then—my first 
words were these: Mr. President, I hope 
you are going to help those young peo-
ple, those Dreamers, those protected by 
DACA. 
He looked at me, and he said: Sen-
ator, don’t worry. We will take care of 
those kids. 
Well, sadly, that didn’t happen. 
In September of 2017, there was a de-
cision made by this administration to 
eliminate the DACA Program, and at 
that point, were it not for a court chal-
lenge and a protective order by the 
court, those young people might have 
been subject to deportation. But many, 
myself included, believed that the 
process used by President Trump was 
flawed, and, if challenged, it would fall 
in court. It took from September 2017 
until today, just minutes ago, when the 
Supreme Court ruled that the adminis-
tration’s 
approach 
to 
eliminating 
DACA was wrong and would be strick-
en. 
I want to say for a moment who these 
young people are, because many people 
don’t know them. They don’t wear 
badges or uniforms to claim that they 
are DACA-protected, but this is who 
they are. Of the 700,000, 200,000 of them 
are essential employees. You may see 
them every day in many, many callings 
across America as we face this national 
health emergency. 
Over 40,000 of them are healthcare 
workers. So if you are a patient at a 
clinic or a hospital today fighting 
COVID–19 and your doctor or nurse just 
walked in the room with a big smile, it 
is because the Supreme Court said to 
that healthcare worker or to that 
healthcare hero: You can stay in Amer-
ica. We need you. 
Of course, that could change. I want 
to raise this issue because it is an im-
portant one. The Trump administra-
tion can decide that they are going to 
reinitiate this effort to rescind DACA 
and try to do it right this time by the 
Supreme Court standards. That would 
be a terrible tragedy if he made that 
decision, not just for those 700,000 but 
for their families as well. 
The front page story on the Chicago 
Tribune this morning was about just 
such a family, both husband and wife 
protected by DACA, working in Amer-
ica, trying to buy a little home in Au-
rora, IL. She works in a cancer clinic. 
He has a job as well. They have two 
beautiful little kids. They are both 
DACA-protected. Because of the Su-
preme Court decision, they have an-
other day in America. They have a sigh 
of relief this morning, but what about 
next week? What will the Trump ad-
ministration do to them next week? I 
am calling on the President and those 
around him, begging him to give these 
DACA protectees the rest of this year 
until next year at least before any-
thing is considered. Let’s protect them 
now through the election, and let the 
next President, whoever he may be, 
make a decision. 
I hope before that happens we will do 
our part in the U.S. Senate, the second 
part of what we can and should be 
doing, calling on the President not to 
rescind DACA again, not to put these 
young 
people 
and 
their 
families 
through this all over again but, sec-
ondly, that we do our job in the Sen-
ate. 
I listened to Senator MCCONNELL ear-
lier, talking about bipartisanship and 
talking about our legislative accom-
plishments. He is correct that the 
lands bill we passed yesterday was his-
toric. I am glad we did it. The 
coronavirus relief bill we passed is his-
toric. I am certainly glad we did it on 
a bipartisan basis, and I sincerely hope, 
when it comes to Justice in Policing, 
we can do the same—a bipartisan effort 
to enact good law. 
Let me add to the list, which unfor-
tunately doesn’t include a lot of legis-
lation, something that is now critically 
important. The House of Representa-
tives, months ago, passed the Dream 
and Promise Act, which would take 
care of the DACA issue once and for 
all. We could enact that law and say to 
these young people: Now you have your 
chance to stay and earn your path to 
citizenship in America. That is what 
we ought to be saying. 
Everyone knows that our immigra-
tion laws are a mess. They are hard to 
explain and impossible to defend. We 
have a chance to do something about 
them on a bipartisan basis, and I am 
calling on Senator MCCONNELL and all 
the leaders on either side of the aisle: 
Let’s join together and do that. Let’s 
have a hearing in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. Let’s bring this bill to the 
floor of the Senate this year so that 
once and for all we can deal with the 
problem we have been looking at for 20 
years and approaching in so many dif-
ferent ways. 
In the meantime, for today—at least 
for this week and, I hope, for long be-
yond that—we will be celebrating a Su-
preme Court decision that gives a new 
lease on life to 700,000 young people 
who have one goal in mind: to be part 
of America’s future. They were edu-
cated in our schools. They stood in 
those classrooms and pledged alle-
giance to the same flag we pledge alle-
giance to. They have their children. 
They have their families. They have 
their hopes and a future, and they are 
making a good living with life in the 
America. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court, they have some more time, but 
now it is up to the President and up to 
us to solve this problem once and for 
all, to do the right thing for them and 
for the future of America. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The clerk will call 
the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
DACA 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this 
morning we received news that the Su-
preme Court has ruled in regard to our 
Dreamers, our Deferred Action Child-
hood Arrival children, who came to 
America knowing no other country, 
and now the Court has said that Presi-
dent Obama did have the authority to 
establish the DACA Program and that 
President Trump does not have a basis 
in law for ending it. 
Hundreds of thousands of Dreamers 
now have full legal authority to con-
tinue their lives in America—the coun-
try they know and love—and pursue 
their dreams, and we must celebrate 
that today. 
EQUALITY ACT 
Mr. President, I come to the floor on 
another issue of freedom. President 
Johnson said: 
Freedom is a right to share, share fully 
and equally, in American society. . . . It is 
the right to be treated in every part of our 
national life as a person equal in dignity and 
promise to all others. 
It was 1996 when Senator Ted Ken-
nedy brought the issue of ending dis-
crimination in employment to the 
floor of the Senate. In that year, not so

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3078 
June 18, 2020 
long ago, virtually everything was sim-
ple majority in the Senate, as designed 
by our Founders, as written in the Con-
stitution. The vote failed 49 to 50 be-
cause Senator David Pryor was at the 
hospital attending to his son, the fu-
ture Senator Mark Pryor, who had can-
cer. It was a moment when the Senate 
nearly took a big stride forward in end-
ing discrimination in employment in 
America against our LGBTQ commu-
nity. 
Then, in November 2013, I brought to 
the floor the same bill, ENDA, ending 
discrimination in employment. This 
Senate voted in a bipartisan majority 
to end that discrimination. In fact, the 
vote was 2 to 1—64 to 32. Yet that 
bright moment here in the Senate, 
where we stood for the vision of free-
dom, was not acted on by the House, 
and the bill did not make it to the 
President’s desk. 
Now we stand here today, in 2020, and 
the Supreme Court on Monday in 
Bostock v. Clayton County, in a 6 to 3 
decision, has proceeded to act to end 
discrimination in employment. In writ-
ing the opinion, Justice Gorsuch said: 
‘‘In Title VII’’—referring to the 1964 
Civil Rights Act—‘‘Congress outlawed 
discrimination in the workplace on the 
basis of race, color, religion, sex, or na-
tional origin.’’ 
He wrote: ‘‘Today, we must decide 
whether an employer can fire someone 
simply 
for 
being 
homosexual 
or 
transgender.’’ 
Everyone looked to the next para-
graph and what would the answer be? 
Gorsuch wrote this: 
The answer is clear. An employer who fires 
an individual for being homosexual or 
transgender fires that person for traits or ac-
tions it would not have questioned in mem-
bers of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary 
and undisguisable role in that decision, ex-
actly what Title VII forbids. 
Well, let the bells of freedom ring 
here in this Chamber and across Amer-
ica. On Sunday of this last week, the 
day before the Supreme Court decision, 
discrimination in employment against 
gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans 
was still legal in 29 States—a majority 
of States in our country—and, on Mon-
day, that discrimination ended. It is 
now illegal in all 50 States of America, 
in all territories of America to dis-
criminate on the basis of who you are 
or whom you love. 
The Court took a long, powerful 
stride toward the vision carved above 
the 
doors 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Court: 
‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’ No longer 
can a mental health counselor named 
Gary Bostock be fired from his job at 
child welfare services department for 
playing in a gay softball league. No 
longer 
can 
a 
skydiving 
instructor 
named Donald Zarda be fired because 
he is gay. No longer can a police officer 
in southern Oregon named Laura Elena 
Calvo—with a sterling 16-year record of 
promotions, commendations for pulling 
people from burning cars, delivering 
babies on the side of the road, saving 
lives and more—be fired because she 
was a transgender woman. 
Employment discrimination ends in 
America. Let us savor that victory for 
freedom. Let us celebrate that victory 
for equality and opportunity. It is a 
long, powerful stride forward on the 
march for freedom. But a long stride 
forward in a march, however signifi-
cant, does not mean that the march is 
over because, as wonderful as that vic-
tory on Monday was, as wonderful it is 
to have discrimination end in employ-
ment across the land, we still have a 
long way to go before LGBTQ Ameri-
cans are treated in every part of our 
national life as people equal in dignity 
and promise to all others. 
The protections on Monday involve 
employment, but those protections do 
not extend to the titles of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act that address other issues— 
issues of education, issues of public ac-
commodations—and they don’t extend 
to credit, financial transactions, trans-
actions covered by the CREDIT Act. 
They don’t extend to jury service. They 
don’t extend to Federal funding of pro-
grams, meaning it is legal for States to 
discriminate or cities to discriminate 
or counties to discriminate on the 
basis of Federal law against participa-
tion in Federal programs. It is unbe-
lievable that we are still in that state, 
but that is where we are. That is where 
we are right now, with discrimination 
ended in employment but not ended in 
all of these other categories. 
There are a couple of possible paths 
forward. One is litigation that con-
tinues on the same premise on which 
the Supreme Court acted on title VII of 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and that 
means litigation in each of these cat-
egories, case after case, slowly making 
its way through the courts, slowly 
making it to the Supreme Court, mean-
ing discrimination continues year after 
year while the courts deliberate on 
this. 
I have heard a number of Senators 
say the Court acted, but Congress 
should have done it. Well, now we have 
the opportunity to do it. We have the 
opportunity to do it by putting the 
Equality Act on the floor of this Sen-
ate, putting it on the floor of the Sen-
ate today, having a debate today, and 
having a vote today on whether to ex-
tend the very premise at the heart of 
the Supreme Court’s decision in em-
ployment to all of the other key areas 
of discrimination that is still suffered 
across this land. 
Let us put the Equality Act on the 
floor. Let us debate it. Let us pass it to 
fulfill the vision Thomas Jefferson put 
forward when, in the words crafted for 
the Declaration of Independence: ‘‘We 
hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men are created equal, that 
they are endowed by their Creator with 
certain unalienable Rights, that among 
these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit 
of Happiness.’’ 
Let us put the Equality Act on the 
floor of the Senate. Let us debate it, 
and let us pass it to act on the premise 
that Senator Ted Kennedy expressed: 
‘‘The promise of America will never be 
fulfilled as long as justice is denied to 
even one among us.’’ 
Let us put the Equality Act on the 
floor of the Senate and debate it and 
pass it to fulfill the promise of free-
dom, the promise of freedom that 
President Johnson so well expressed in 
‘‘the right to be treated in every part 
of our national life as a person equal in 
dignity and promise to all others.’’ 
We have the power to ring the bells 
of freedom here in this Chamber. Let 
us not miss this opportunity. 
I am so pleased to be here with my 
colleagues who have fought for this vi-
sion of freedom and equality and oppor-
tunity—my colleague TAMMY BALDWIN 
from Wisconsin and my colleague CORY 
BOOKER from New Jersey, who have 
been champions in leading this fight— 
a fight envisioned now by a tremendous 
number of Senators endorsing and co-
sponsoring the Equality Act. Let us 
put that act on the floor. 
I yield to my colleague from Wis-
consin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize an enormous step 
forward for our country, which hap-
pened earlier this week, on Monday. 
Once again, on a morning during Pride 
Month, our Nation came closer to real-
izing the promise of equality for les-
bians, gays, bisexual, transgender, and 
the queer community. 
The Supreme Court has made it clear 
that workplace discrimination against 
LGBTQ people is wrong, and our Na-
tion’s civil rights laws prohibit it. 
While this is a joyous day and a joyous 
week, I want to take a moment to ac-
knowledge the untold number who 
have suffered in this country for years 
without recourse. I want to recognize 
those brave LGBTQ people who re-
ceived pink slips, were passed over for 
promotions, suffered harassment and 
bullying in break rooms, or never got 
that initial interview—all simply be-
cause of who they are or whom they 
loved. 
I particularly want to thank the 
plaintiffs who brought these cases: Ger-
ald Bostock, Aimee Stephens, and Don-
ald Zarda, as well as the families and 
friends and lawyers who supported 
them. Sadly, Aimee and Donald did not 
live to see this transformative moment 
for our country and our community, 
but we will remember them and honor 
the efforts that they and so many oth-
ers have made to get us here. We will 
commit ourselves to continuing to 
push forward for full equality for them. 
On Monday, the Supreme Court af-
firmed what many Federal courts, the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, and so many of us have recog-
nized for years—that title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 is properly un-
derstood to prohibit discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender 
identity. 
As Justice Gorsuch wrote for the ma-
jority: 
Today, we must decide whether an em-
ployer can fire someone simply for being ho-
mosexual or transgender. The answer is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3079 
June 18, 2020 
clear. An employer who fires an individual 
for being homosexual or transgender fires 
that person for traits or actions that it 
would not have questioned in members of a 
different sex. Sex plays a necessary and 
undisguisable role in the decision, exactly 
what Title VII forbids. 
This decision is far from radical, but 
it is transformative. It means that at 
long last in every corner of this Na-
tion, in big cities and small towns, 
LGBTQ people are waking up in a fair-
er country. They now know that they 
have recourse if an employer discrimi-
nates against them simply because of 
who they are or whom they love. Em-
ployers know unambiguously that they 
have an obligation in every State to 
judge all of their employees on merit, 
not sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity. 
While we have taken another big step 
forward—and it is a big step—in the 
march toward full equality for LGBTQ 
Americans, we are not there yet. Les-
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
queer people face discrimination in 
many more aspects of their lives than 
the workplace. Our country needs to 
send the message that treating people 
unfairly because of their sexual ori-
entation or gender identity is wrong 
and that it will not be tolerated, pe-
riod, whether that is while buying a 
house, going out to dinner, shopping in 
a store, serving on a jury, or seeking 
help from a government program. 
While the Court told us on Monday 
that discrimination based on sexual 
orientation or gender identity is nec-
essarily sex discrimination, those cases 
were about employment. While I would 
expect that any administration would 
now take a long, hard look at its 
wrong-headed efforts—based on the 
legal arguments that the Supreme 
Court 
has 
just 
rejected—to 
write 
LGBTQ people out of sex discrimina-
tion 
protections 
in 
education, 
healthcare, and other areas, I do not 
have confidence that this administra-
tion is going to do so. 
There are areas of Federal civil 
rights law, such as those governing 
public accommodations and Federal fi-
nancial assistance, which don’t even 
yet prohibit discrimination based on 
sex. That is why the Senate must take 
up and pass the Equality Act. Senators 
MERKLEY, COLLINS, BOOKER, and I in-
troduced this bipartisan measure to en-
sure that LGBTQ people have the same 
nondiscrimination protections as other 
Americans by adding sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity alongside all 
protected characteristics, such as race 
and religion, to existing Federal laws. 
It would ban discrimination in a host 
of areas, including housing, public ac-
commodations, jury service, access to 
credit and Federal funding, as well as 
employment. 
The bill would also strengthen our 
civil rights laws by adding protections 
against sex discrimination to the Fed-
eral laws where they have not been in-
cluded previously, including those ad-
dressing public accommodations and 
Federal funding. 
More than a year ago, a bipartisan 
majority of the House of Representa-
tives passed the Equality Act. Unfortu-
nately, like so many other pieces of 
legislation that would improve the 
lives of the American people, it has 
been ignored by the Senate majority 
leader and placed in his legislative 
graveyard. 
The Equality Act cannot be ignored 
any longer by the Senate, and LGBTQ 
people should not have to wait any 
longer to enjoy the full protections of 
our Nation’s civil rights laws. 
I urge the Senate to build on the Su-
preme Court’s decision and act today 
to bring our Nation closer to the prom-
ise of equality by passing the Equality 
Act. 
Finally, I want to close by acknowl-
edging the extraordinary moment in 
which our Nation finds itself today. 
Thousands upon thousands are de-
manding the country confront racial 
injustices and systemic racism. They 
rightfully call for change, and they 
righteously call for change, and it is 
my hope that Congress will take an im-
portant step in righting some of those 
wrongs by passing the Justice in Polic-
ing Act of 2020 without delay. 
We must do so much more, and today 
I am keenly aware of the Black and 
Brown LGBTQ people who experience 
discrimination and injustice in this 
country—not just because of sexual 
orientation or gender identity but also 
because of race or ethnicity. 
As we approach another anniversary 
of the Stonewall riots that sparked the 
modern LGBTQ movement for equal-
ity, I am also mindful of the leadership 
of Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Ri-
vera, transgender women of color, in 
that historic moment. I hope the brave, 
courageous legacy of these leaders and 
the urgent needs of Black and Brown 
LGBTQ people would inspire us to take 
another step to strengthen the civil 
rights for all Americans and pass the 
Equality Act. 
I now yield to my colleague from 
Michigan, Senator STABENOW. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first 
of all, I want to thank my wonderful 
colleagues for their leadership, Senator 
MERKLEY and Senator BALDWIN, for not 
just being on the floor today and 
speaking out but speaking out every 
day for introducing the Equality Act, 
of which I am very proud to be a co-
sponsor, and for continually standing 
up for the rights of all Americans. 
In 2013, a Michigan funeral director 
wrote a letter. It said: 
What I must tell you is very difficult for 
me and is taking all the courage I can mus-
ter. I felt imprisoned in a body that does not 
match my mind, and this has caused me 
great despair and loneliness. 
She told her coworkers, from now on, 
she was choosing to live her truth; 
from now on, she would be living and 
working as a woman. Unfortunately, 
she paid dearly for her courage, and 2 
weeks later she was fired. 
That woman was Aimee Stephens of 
Redford, MI. 
This week, Aimee’s courage literally 
changed history—literally changed his-
tory. In a 6-to-3 decision, the Supreme 
Court ruled that what happened to 
Aimee was illegal. It was illegal. Pe-
riod. Employers cannot fire or other-
wise discriminate against employees 
simply because of who they are or 
whom they love. Period. 
Sadly, Aimee didn’t get to celebrate 
the landmark victory, and we all wish 
she were here right now to be able to 
join and lead the celebration. She died 
last month at age 59. She will go down 
in history as someone who took a stand 
for equality, for basic fairness, and 
made our Nation a better place. So 
many people have joined her in this 
fight, getting to this victory. 
It is now time to further honor her 
courage and the courage of so many 
others by passing the Equality Act, and 
we can do it today. That is the good 
news. Right now, on the floor today, we 
can do that together. What a great way 
to end this week; this month of June, 
this Pride Month. What a great way 
this would be. 
The Equality Act is pretty simple. It 
protects people against discrimination 
based on sexual orientation or gender 
identity in all aspects of their lives. 
Unfortunately, this legislation, as my 
colleagues have said, which has already 
passed the House, has been sitting on 
MITCH
MCCONNELL’s desk gathering 
dust for nearly 400 days—400 days since 
the House of Representatives took ac-
tion. It is time to shake off that dust 
and get this thing done for Aimee and 
for everyone who has fought alongside 
her and continues to fight today to 
make our Nation a more equitable 
place. 
Now, our Republican colleagues, how-
ever, are more interested in pushing 
through extremist judges who have no 
interest in LGBTQ equality. 
Later today and next week, we will 
be voting on two judicial nomina-
tions—Justin Walker and Cory Wilson. 
It is, frankly, insulting that these two 
nominations are even coming to the 
floor—insulting to the American people 
that they are coming to the floor. 
Justin Walker’s nomination is op-
posed by 275 outside groups, including 
the Leadership Conference on Civil and 
Human Rights and the National Center 
for Transgender Equality. 
As for Cory Wilson, he supports H.B. 
1523, the so-called Protecting Freedom 
of Conscience from Government Dis-
crimination Act, and that would give 
broad permission for people and busi-
nesses to deny services to people based 
on sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity. 
Both of these nominees—both of 
them would overturn the Affordable 
Care Act, which has made lifesaving 
differences for so many members of the 
LGBTQ community and Americans all 
across our country. 
Justin Walker wants the courts to 
throw out the entire Affordable Care

Act, including protections for people 
with preexisting conditions. He called 
the Supreme Court decision upholding 
the 
ACA 
‘‘indefensible 
and 
cata-
strophic.’’ 
Millions 
of 
people 
get 
their 
healthcare through the Affordable Care 
Act. Everyone who has an insurance 
policy is able to do that and get cov-
ered, even if they have a preexisting 
condition, because of the Affordable 
Care Act. 
Cory Wilson used even more colorful 
language. He called the law ‘‘illegit-
imate and perverse.’’ Providing people 
healthcare he thinks is perverse, and 
this is somebody the Republicans are 
going to put on the court. 
He even opposed expanding Medicaid 
coverage in Mississippi, a change that 
would literally save lives in the middle 
of a pandemic. 
We know what we need to do because 
Aimee showed us. We need to pass the 
Equality Act now—today. We can do 
that today. Wouldn’t that be wonder-
ful, on a bipartisan basis, to pass this 
today? 
We need to vote no on two judicial 
nominees who are far out of step with 
the basic American ideals of equality 
and fairness. 
Aimee Stevens was courageous. Four 
hundred days is way too long for mil-
lions of Americans to wait for the U.S. 
Senate to step up and do its job. It is 
time for all of us to truly stand up for 
equality for the LGBTQ community 
and set the foundation that we believe 
in equality for all Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before 
she leaves, another good idea from Sen-
ator STABENOW—pass the Equality Act 
today. Too logical, I guess, but it is an-
other good idea, and I thank my col-
league for it. 
I also want to commend my partner 
from Oregon, Senator MERKLEY, who 
has been leading this fight for years 
now. Wisconsin often partners with Or-
egon, going all the way back to our 
shared ownership of Wayne Morris. I 
just want to thank my colleagues for 
the great work they have been doing 
and just take a couple of minutes to 
talk about my pride in standing with 
them to fight for the passage of the 
Equality Act. 
We have come together during the 
middle of Pride Month. In 2020, with 
the pandemic continuing to spread, 
Pride Month looks a little different 
than it has in the past—no parades, 
smaller celebrations—but it still has 
been a historic month when it comes to 
LGBTQ rights, perhaps more so than 
any other since marriage equality be-
came the law of the land in June 2015. 
A few days ago, the Supreme Court 
ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
protects LGBTQ Americans against 
discrimination in the workplace. The 
majority said an employer who fires an 
individual merely for being gay or 
transgender defies the law. 
Now, this ruling was a little bit of a 
surprise. I mean, it was absolutely cor-
rect in that it recognized that the law 
offered equal protection for LGBTQ 
Americans—a fact that should never 
have been in doubt. 
I also want to say on the floor today 
we are going to have to continue to be 
on guard that this administration’s 
judges will use the approach underpin-
ning this ruling as cover to strip equal 
protection from other people in future 
rulings. 
When you get the wrong approach re-
sulting in the correct ruling, we have 
to be vigilant—vigilant, vigilant, and 
more vigilant in fighting for the cor-
rect results again and again and again. 
The ruling came just a few days after 
the Trump administration tried to 
take America in exactly a different di-
rection, announcing that it was green- 
lighting 
healthcare 
discrimination 
against 
transgender 
Americans—an 
ugly, shameful action to take. How 
cruel that the administration actually 
said: We are going to announce this 
during Pride Month. We are actually 
going to use Pride Month to be cruel. 
It was a reminder to a lot of people 
that the fight for LGBTQ rights didn’t 
end with the victory on marriage 
equality. For every landmark ruling 
that moves the cause forward, there is 
somebody like Donald Trump, who is 
always looking to see if they can drag 
the Nation back to the days when dis-
crimination was business as usual. 
Until Monday’s ruling, employers in 
more than half the States were allowed 
to fire employees for their sexual ori-
entation or their gender identity. That 
was in more than half the States, but 
that injustice is now a thing of the 
past. 
We can’t count on this week’s Su-
preme Court ruling against workplace 
discrimination to bring on the end of 
discrimination in other parts of life in 
our country. The Senate can’t wait for 
any other court cases to move forward 
before we take real action on this floor. 
That is why my colleagues and I are 
here today. We want to call for the im-
mediate passage of the Equality Act. If 
discrimination against LGBTQ Ameri-
cans is illegal in the workplace, then it 
is illegal in housing; it is illegal in edu-
cation; it is illegal in public services 
and more. That is what the Equality 
Act is all about. It is about recognizing 
the dignity and the humanity of 
LGBTQ Americans, and, most impor-
tantly, enshrining it into the law. It is 
the next step that will move the cause 
forward, and there is bipartisan legisla-
tion that reflects the will of an over-
whelming majority of the American 
people. The Senate ought to come to-
gether and pass it now. 
Justice Kennedy wrote—and I will 
close with this because it sums up what 
is in my heart today, ‘‘The Constitu-
tion promises liberty to all within its 
reach.’’ 
There is much to be done on deliv-
ering on that promise outlined by Jus-
tice Kennedy. So we are going to be 
back here on the floor of the Senate, 
fighting for the passage of the Equality 
Act. Senator STABENOW was spot on. 
We ought to have done it today, and we 
are just going to be back here again 
and again and again in the weeks and 
months ahead until we have that prom-
ise of equality in every corner of the 
land. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleagues from Oregon, 
Senator WYDEN, for his remarks; Sen-
ator MERKLEY, for his leadership on the 
bill; and Senator BALDWIN from Wis-
consin, for her extraordinary leader-
ship and service to our country. 
It is a great privilege to be here 
today. My friend CORY BOOKER from 
New Jersey has been fighting for these 
issues for his whole career. Who knows, 
as I know, that anyone who studied the 
history of our democracy knows it has 
always been hard to make progress. 
This struggle has always been a battle 
of our highest ideals and our worst in-
stincts as a country. 
It has been true since our founding, 
when the same people who wrote that 
‘‘all men are created equal’’ also per-
petuated human slavery and denied 
equality to so many others. In fact, I 
don’t think it is too much to say that 
our history is a story of our struggle 
with that contradiction between the 
promise of equality and the reality of 
inequality in America—between our 
highest ideals and our worst instincts. 
We struggle with that today. 
Since he took office, over and over, 
President Trump has called on our 
worst instincts in almost everything he 
has done, including his attacks on ac-
cess to healthcare, housing, and edu-
cation for LGBTQ Americans. 
Just last week, he went out of his 
way to strip transgender Americans of 
their access to healthcare, but just as 
President Trump was depriving hard- 
won rights, dragging us backward 
again, in Colorado, on the very same 
day, our State legislature passed a law 
to make it harder to wage violence 
against LGBTQ people in my State. 
And listen to this: The vote was 63 to 
1 in the Colorado House. It was 35 to 0 
in the Colorado Senate. 
Notwithstanding President Trump’s 
anti-civil rights, anti-civil liberties 
agenda, in Colorado—a Western State, 
a purple State—Republican and Demo-
cratic elected officials, in their legisla-
tive season, are fighting for our highest 
ideals and rejecting our worst in-
stincts. 
In fact, my State passed our version 
of the Equality Act over a decade ago. 
It is why we banned conversion therapy 
and passed Jude’s Law, which makes it 
is easier for transgender Americans to 
change their name and government 
documents. It is how we have elected 
our State’s first openly gay Governor, 
Jared Polis, and our first transgender 
State legislator, Brianna Titone. It is 
why we were one of the first States in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3081 
June 18, 2020 
America, I say to my college from New 
Jersey, to pass real accountability for 
police brutality with a bill led by Les-
lie 
Herod—Colorado’s 
first 
LGBTQ 
State legislator of color. This week, we 
passed that bill 52 to 13 in the House 
and 32 to 2 in the Senate. It contains 
many of the same reforms that Senator 
BOOKER and Senator HARRIS are lead-
ing on here. 
So I am here to tell you that there 
are more and more in Colorado and in 
the country who understand what 
equality has come to mean in America 
and how to resolve some of these con-
tradictions in the year 2020, and, this 
week, even the U.S. Supreme Court 
seems to understand it. 
Just in the last week, a Republican- 
appointed 
Justice 
rejected 
Donald 
Trump’s arguments and wrote for a 
majority of the Court, affirming equal-
ity for LGBTQ Americans. Then, this 
morning, the Court overturned Presi-
dent Trump’s malicious attack on 
Dreamers, reaffirming the rule of law 
and, for the moment, protecting three- 
quarters of a million people who know 
no other country but the United States 
of America. 
Now it is time for the Senate to do 
our work, finally, and pass the Equal-
ity Act. The House passed the Equality 
Act 13 months ago, and we have not 
acted in our typical fashion. That is 
another 13 months when LGBTQ Amer-
icans could get married on a Sunday 
and be fired on Monday, another 13 
months when our neighbors could be 
denied housing, denied healthcare or be 
turned out of a store because of who 
they are. 
Americans understand that no good 
comes from hoarding freedoms and 
equality. When we take the opposite 
view, we act against our traditions. As 
a nation, we will never flourish if we 
choose to depend on a permanent 
underclass that is deprived of some or 
all of the rights and freedoms others 
enjoy. Free people do not remain free 
by denying freedom to others. We 
should vote on the Equality Act and 
pass it today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
join my colleagues today, in the middle 
of Pride Month, to celebrate the Su-
preme Court’s landmark decision this 
week in Bostock v. Clayton County, 
protecting LGBTQ rights and pro-
tecting people from discrimination in 
the workplace, and to urge all of our 
colleagues to secure and extend those 
protections by passing the Equality 
Act. 
Something else big happened in the 
Supreme Court, and that was today, 
with the Supreme Court’s decision on 
DACA, on Dreamers—allowing them to 
stay in this country and asking the ad-
ministration to open up the application 
process for citizenship. That is relevant 
because it is about civil rights, but it is 
also relevant because the Supreme 
Court—this 
conservative 
Court—has 
had to step in because this body has 
not been doing what it should have 
been: passing the Equality Act and 
passing comprehensive immigration re-
form. So let us remember that as we 
celebrate the decision in the Bostock 
case and as we move toward equality. 
I thank Senators MERKLEY, BALDWIN, 
and BOOKER for their leadership on this 
important bill and for bringing us to-
gether today. 
Over the last few decades, we have 
made progress in the fight for equality. 
We have stood up for what is right, and 
we have worked hard to make this a 
country in which people can safely, 
proudly, and legally love whom they 
love. It was not long ago when a person 
could be prosecuted for being gay and 
when don’t ask, don’t tell was the law 
of the land—when I came to the U.S. 
Senate—and when States were per-
mitted to deny LGBTQ couples the 
right to get married under the Defense 
of Marriage Act. 
This week, our country took an im-
portant step forward with the Supreme 
Court’s decision that recognizes that 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which pro-
hibits employers from firing employees 
because of sex, protects LGBTQ people 
in the workplace. 
We can celebrate today that justice 
was delivered for Aimee Stephens, who 
was fired when she informed her em-
ployer that she was transgender, and 
for Donald Zarda and Gerald Bostock, 
who were fired when their employers 
learned they were gay. 
But, of course, this is more than 
about three people. As Mr. Bostock 
said, ‘‘This fight became about so much 
more than me.’’ Their courage to stand 
up in the face of injustice will forever 
change this country for millions of 
LGBTQ people and their families, and 
it makes our country a more just na-
tion. 
Although the Court’s decision is a 
landmark victory, we still have miles 
to go because it is not right when the 
Commander 
in 
Chief 
tells 
brave 
transgender Americans who want to 
serve and protect our country in our 
military that they are not welcome; it 
is not right when this administration 
is trying to take away the hard-won 
rights of LGBTQ people in healthcare 
and education; and it is not right that 
you can drive across the United States 
on a cross-country trip and find that 
the laws and protections could be dif-
ferent at every rest stop. 
That is why I was proud to cosponsor, 
on the day it was introduced, the bipar-
tisan Equality Act with my colleagues 
who are here today, and it is why I am 
calling on our colleagues across the 
aisle to pass this bill. 
This bill, which already passed the 
House by a vote of 236 to 173, will go a 
long way in protecting LGBTQ Ameri-
cans from discrimination. The Equality 
Act would build on the Supreme 
Court’s 
decision 
and 
make 
non-
discrimination protections consistent 
and explicit. It would amend laws like 
the Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing 
Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 
and Federal employment laws to en-
sure that all Americans, regardless of 
their sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity, have equal access to housing, edu-
cation, and federally funded programs. 
We should not wait any longer to ex-
tend these protections, for nearly two- 
thirds of LGBTQ Americans report ex-
periencing discrimination in their per-
sonal lives. These problems are com-
pounded by race and income, especially 
for trans women of color. Yet it has 
been over 1 year since this bill passed 
the House. 
In 2000, when I was the county attor-
ney in our largest county in Min-
nesota, I was invited to the White 
House to introduce President Bill Clin-
ton at an event to urge the passage of 
hate crimes legislation. We had had an 
African-American young man who had 
been shot by a guy who had said that 
he had wanted to go out and kill some-
one on Martin Luther King Day. That 
happened. We had had an employee who 
had gotten beaten with a board by the 
foreman at his workplace for his sim-
ply speaking Spanish. I had taken on a 
number of these crimes, so I had been 
invited by the President to urge Con-
gress to pass the Matthew Shepard 
hate crimes legislation, which covered 
a wide range of hate crimes. 
During that event at the White 
House—my first time ever there—I got 
to meet the investigators in the Mat-
thew Shepard case. They were these 
two burly cops from Wyoming, and 
they talked about the fact that until 
that investigation—I think Senator 
BALDWIN is nodding her head and has 
probably met them as well—they really 
hadn’t thought about what Matthew 
Shepard’s life was like or the lives of 
other LGBTQ people. Then, as they 
started to investigate what had hap-
pened—and we all remember how he 
was left hanging on a fence post, and 
the first people who saw him thought 
he was a scarecrow—these investiga-
tors, these police officers, got to know 
the family and the case. They got to 
know his mom, and they got to know 
his friends. During the course of their 
investigation, as they began to under-
stand what life was like for Matthew 
Shepard, their own lives were changed. 
I think this is happening right now 
around this country after the murder 
of George Floyd in my State, and I 
know it has been happening when it 
comes to our LGBTQ community. That 
is why, on that day way back, we were 
in the White House to introduce that 
bill. Nearly 10 years after that event at 
the White House, during my first year 
as a U.S. Senator, I got to be one of the 
deciding votes to finally pass that hate 
crimes bill. 
So I say to my colleagues who are 
fighting for justice, who are fighting 
for justice in policing, who are fighting 
for justice in our LGBTQ community, 
who are fighting for justice for our im-
migrants, the change will happen, but 
we can’t wait 10 years for this change 
to happen. The people of this country

are demanding that it happen now. We 
need to come together and finally pass 
the Equality Act and do all of these 
other good things that are right here, 
that are right on our desks. We should 
do them immediately—not next year— 
and not wait. Now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleagues who are here and for all 
of the work that has been done around 
the Equality Act, not just here in the 
Senate but also in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
I want to make this very clear. You 
look at history, and you see that the 
fundamental equality of all Americans 
has been denied for so many genera-
tions—for women who fought for equal-
ity under the law and the right to vote; 
for African Americans, who fought for 
equality under the law. We have seen 
from our founding they have struggled 
to make real the promise of this Na-
tion—a promise of an ideal that we are 
all equal under the law. 
Our 
Founders—these 
imperfect 
geniuses—enshrined these ideals. This 
Nation was not founded in perfection 
but in aspiration. The very Founders 
themselves referred to Native Ameri-
cans as savages. They talked about 
women as not being equal citizens. 
They denied African Americans full 
and equal citizenship. Yet these aspira-
tional documents were so profound 
that every generation of Americans has 
called to our founding ideals to over-
come the inequality that has been in-
herent in our country. 
Susan B. Anthony called to the 
founding documents for her equality 
and the equality of women. Martin Lu-
ther King, on The Mall, called to that 
check—to that promissory note—that 
it was time. Yet here we are, in the 
year 2020, still calling for the full 
equality of all American citizens when 
it comes to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgender Americans. 
I think back to my own family—to 
my 
grandparents 
and 
great-grand-
mother—who talked about the excuses 
that were used to deny them equality. 
There were religious excuses. I am a 
big believer in religious freedom, but 
people sought to deny Blacks and 
Whites from marrying. In fact, when 
Loving v. Virginia passed, the majority 
of Americans were still against inter-
racial marriage in this country. Some-
how, people were using religion as a 
shield from establishing the funda-
mental ideals of this country. We over-
came that. 
These types of reasons were given for 
the dehumanizing treatment of Native 
Americans, and these kinds of excuses 
were used to justify the segregation of 
African Americans. In every genera-
tion, we fought and we struggled and 
we came together—multiracial, multi-
ethnic, diverse coalitions—to overcome 
this. 
This week, I was so grateful to see 
the decision of the Supreme Court, but 
I was of mixed feelings about it. Why 
would it take an action of the Supreme 
Court to justify what already is—equal 
humanity? equal dignity? Why would it 
take so long for a country to say: ‘‘In 
this Nation, a majority of States can-
not discriminate against you. You can-
not be fired just because of who you 
are’’? 
I hear the echoes of my own ancestry 
growing up in a country in which chil-
dren were told and saw clearly before 
them laws enshrined that were bigoted 
and biased; that they were not equal 
citizens, and even though, when we 
stand up in our grade schools, we have 
to say those words ‘‘liberty and justice 
for all,’’ what does it mean to a child 
who is denied those things? 
I see us in a country now in which we 
are raising children who are in danger. 
LGBTQ kids are almost five times as 
likely as their straight peers to at-
tempt suicide. LGBTQ kids—about 30 
percent—admit to missing school be-
cause of being in fear for their safety. 
This is in America in 2020. Black trans 
women are dying at unacceptable, un-
conscionable rates. I say dying. They 
are being murdered. There have been 15 
transgender or gender nonconforming 
people who have been murdered, and 
last 
week 
alone, 
two 
transgender 
women were killed—Dominique Fells 
and Riah Milton. 
We have work to do in this country 
to establish the fundamental ideals 
that have been said from the founding 
of this country that we will all be 
equal under the law, the fundamental 
ideals from the founding of this coun-
try that we are a nation of liberty and 
justice for all. 
Here we are at the crossroads of his-
tory, forcing our fellow Americans to 
come and ask for what is fundamen-
tally theirs already—equal dignity, 
equal rights. The Equality Act is too 
late already. It is too late to do what 
was preordained by the very founding 
of this Nation. We are too late already 
to save the lives of children who have 
been forced to live in a nation that 
doesn’t recognize their equal dignity. 
We are too late already to protect the 
shame of people who have been fired 
just because they are gay, who have 
been denied accommodation just be-
cause they are gay—the humiliation of 
which, I dare say, so many in this body 
know from their families’ stories. 
So we come here to the floor to ask 
for what is overdue, to ask for us to es-
tablish in law what is true in the spirit 
of this Nation, and to echo the words of 
our ancestors, great suffragettes, great 
civil rights leaders, great Native Amer-
icans, who have all come to this Cap-
itol to say: This is who we are—equal 
citizens under the law. 
To my colleagues who are with me 
today, I tell you that, no matter what 
happens with this unanimous consent, 
justice will come to this country. No 
matter who stands against this Equal-
ity Act, they stand on the wrong side 
of history, on the arc of the moral uni-
verse, but it bends toward justice. Well, 
it never bends automatically. We need 
some arc benders. For too many people 
in this country, justice delayed is jus-
tice denied. So we will not give up. We 
will not yield. We will not equivocate. 
We will not retreat. This will become 
the law of the land. 
We have made some steps in the right 
direction of justice, but we are still in 
the foothills. We have a mountain to 
climb, but I know we will make it to 
the mountaintop. I know that this Na-
tion will fulfill its promise to all of its 
people and, indeed, become the prom-
ised land. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate the powerful words, the pas-
sionate delivery of stories on the de-
fense of freedom, the defense of equal-
ity, the advance of justice, and the 
presentations of my colleagues from 
Wisconsin and Michigan, my partner 
from Oregon, my friend from Colorado, 
the Senator from Minnesota, and Sen-
ator BOOKER from New Jersey. Their 
words speak to the heart of what our 
Nation is about—equality, opportunity, 
justice, and freedom. 
I will, therefore, ask that we bring 
this bill about equality to the floor, 
that we go forward in the great tradi-
tion of this Chamber and this Senate to 
debate issues that involve the oppor-
tunity for every individual to thrive in 
our Nation. Time and again, we have 
held those debates before. We held 
them in 2013 on the Employment Non- 
Discrimination Act. 
Now, I understand some colleagues 
have come to the floor to object to this 
Senate’s entertaining such an impor-
tant debate. They have come to the 
floor to obstruct the opportunity of 
this Chamber to engage in a dialogue 
on this important issue—so violent to 
the life of millions of Americans. I ask 
them to reconsider. 
Have the courage to debate this issue 
on the floor—to bring, in the great tra-
dition of this country, an issue violent 
to freedom to be considered here. 
One colleague responded to the Su-
preme Court’s decision on employment 
nondiscrimination earlier this week by 
saying: This judicial rewriting of our 
law 
short-circuited 
the 
legislative 
process and the authority of the elec-
torate. Well, let no Member of the Sen-
ate today short circuit the legislative 
process by objecting to this important 
debate on the floor of the Senate. 
On behalf of equality and oppor-
tunity and freedom, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Judiciary Committee 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of H.R. 5 and the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration. Fur-
ther, that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I am re-
serving the right to object.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3083 
June 18, 2020 
There is a single thread that runs 
through the Supreme Court’s decision 
in the Bostock case earlier this week 
and all the way through the legislation 
now under discussion on the Senate 
floor, and that principle deals with 
nondiscrimination. It is a principle 
that, as Americans, we believe that 
people shouldn’t be treated differently 
on the basis of factors, characteristics, 
and traits that have nothing to do with 
their job. I think most Americans can 
agree with that, and I think most 
Americans can agree that an individual 
shouldn’t face such discrimination in 
the workplace based on his or her sex-
ual orientation. 
The important thing that we have to 
remember is that much of where the 
law is found and much of what we can 
perceive from a position of justice and 
equality and fairness relates to where 
the exceptions are found. I have got 
two principal concerns with this legis-
lation that are also shared by the 
Bostock ruling. The first relates to ex-
ceptions related to religious employ-
ers. 
Neither the Bostock decision nor the 
Equality Act takes the care to ensure 
that religious employers will be treat-
ed fairly under this approach. We need 
to be mindful of the need of a religious 
employer to maintain its doctrine and 
its teachings, not only in the hiring of 
its ministers but also in the hiring of 
other people who worked toward mov-
ing forward that religious institution’s 
teachings in the way they live their 
lives, in their beliefs, and in their will-
ingness to teach those things to others. 
This legislation doesn’t do that. I 
think any legislation that we move for-
ward on this needs to have it. 
Secondly, neither this legislation nor 
the Bostock decision takes into ac-
count some significant distinctions be-
tween sexual orientation on the one 
hand and gender identity on the other. 
In the case of gender identity, the 
law needs to take into account certain 
questions regarding what impact the 
law might have on girls and women’s 
restrooms and locker rooms, girls and 
women’s athletics, and single-sex safe 
places for people who are, for example, 
the victims of domestic or sexual 
abuse. This law, like the Bostock deci-
sion, doesn’t operate with a lot of pre-
cision and sort of takes a meat cleaver 
to the issue without taking into ac-
count exceptions for religious entities 
and distinctions between sexual ori-
entation and gender identity. On that 
basis, I have concerns. 
Knowing that I have some colleagues 
who want to speak to this issue, I de-
cline to object as of this moment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I would just 
like to observe that it was just over 20 
years ago that this Chamber and the 
analog Chamber across the way in the 
House of Representatives passed al-
most unanimously a statute called the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It 
was sponsored in the House by then- 
Representative SCHUMER, and it was 
sponsored in this Chamber by Senator 
Edward Kennedy, and signed by Presi-
dent Bill Clinton into law, who, upon 
its signing, referred to religious liberty 
as our first freedom—those are his 
words—and he later pointed to the Re-
ligious Freedom Restoration Act as 
one of his proudest accomplishments as 
President of the United States. Its co-
sponsors in this body included Senators 
FEINSTEIN and MURRAY and LEAHY. It 
was bipartisan is my point, to put it 
mildly. 
Yet, today, this short time on the 
legislation that is offered on this floor 
now, that has not gone through the 
normal process of committee referral, 
debate on the floor but would be passed 
now, without any further discussion, 
guts key provisions of the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act. This is com-
ing on the heels of a Supreme Court de-
cision just 2 days ago that rewrites en-
tire statutes in American law and in 
its 33 pages has nearly nothing to say 
about religious liberty or religious be-
lievers in this country. In fact, the 
only thing that the opinion does say of 
any consequence is this: 
How [the courts’] . . . doctrines protecting 
religious liberty interact with Title VII [as 
rewritten by the court] are questions for fu-
ture cases. 
Now, I respect, very much, my col-
leagues across the aisle and their pas-
sion for this issue and their sincerity 
in this cause. I would only ask that the 
rights of well-meaning, sincere reli-
gious believers not be steamrolled and 
overlooked and shifted to the side as 
part of this process. We should be able 
to come together and stand together in 
the effort to see all people be given 
their constitutional rights and have 
their constitutional rights protected. 
The effects of this bill is forcing tax-
payers to pay for abortions, forcing 
doctors and nurses to perform abor-
tions against their will, and forcing 
faith-based hospitals and clinics to per-
form abortions. H.R. 5, this bill here, 
would supersede existing restrictions 
on abortion, including funding, includ-
ing health and safety standards, and 
other regulations that the States have 
passed. 
It would force faith-based adoption 
agencies, some of which have been 
helping birth mothers find a safe and 
loving and permanent home for more 
than 100 years—it would force them out 
of business. It would coerce those who 
don’t want to speak or who hold dif-
ferent beliefs into adopting this set of 
practices and principles and beliefs at 
work—these doctors, these nurses, and 
these faith-based agencies. 
I submit to you that this is not the 
way to find consensus in America. This 
shunting aside of the constitutional 
rights of sincere, well-meaning people 
of faith is not the way to proceed. This 
gutting of the Religious Freedom Act— 
and I say that because H.R. 5 explicitly 
carves out of the Religious Freedom 
Act, it explicitly carves out of its safe-
ty provisions all of those requirements 
I just mentioned. It rolls back the lib-
erties afforded to people of faith—all 
faiths, by the way. One of the beauties 
of the Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act is that it covers people of all 
faiths, any faith, and this bill would 
roll those protections back. It would do 
it without the chance for debate. It 
would do it outside of our normal pro-
cedures. 
For those reasons, I express these 
reservations. Again, I thank my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
for their work on this issue, their pas-
sion for this cause, and their sincerity 
in what they believe. I hope that we 
might find a better way to go forward 
together, but I do not object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
am reserving the right to object. No 
person should be discriminated against 
in America. No one. It is a basic con-
stitutional principle. We are all equal 
under the law, all of us. We have dif-
ferent ideas about music and food. We 
have different ideas about sexuality. 
We have different ideas about occupa-
tions. We have different skin colors. We 
are the tapestry that we talk about, 
and we are working to make a more 
perfect Union. I absolutely believe that 
no person should be discriminated 
against in America. 
The Equality Act doesn’t just make 
everything equal, though. It has a 
great title. Who can oppose equality? 
No one. It is a basic principle of Amer-
ican values. We don’t oppose equality, 
but we do oppose when, through legis-
lation, you take the rights of one and 
dismiss the rights of others and say: 
Your rights don’t count, only this 
group counts, and only this person 
counts. We, in America, have tried to 
work together, in all of our differences, 
for over two centuries, to learn better 
how to hear the rights of another one, 
to accommodate, and to find those 
spots where the rights of two individ-
uals collide and to work it out among 
each other. The Equality Act does not 
do that. I wish it did. It changes things 
dramatically. 
Let me just give you a few examples. 
It reaches into high school sports and 
says for male and female sports, that 
individuals’ 
sexual 
orientation 
and 
gender identity can move between 
those. There is no standard for testos-
terone. There is no standard for mov-
ing through transition surgery. There 
is no standard at all set on it. It opens 
it up for any male—biological male—to 
step into female sports on the high 
school level or in the college level or in 
the pro-athlete level and be able to 
move into that sport. That grossly dis-
advantages girls in sports, but their 
rights are denied. 
We have already seen this in several 
States where State record holders for 
track, for instance—someone who was 
a biological male competing in wom-
en’s athletics denying the other girls 
who were competing in that from op-
portunities for scholarships to college,

to be able to move on to other ath-
letics. Their rights were ignored be-
cause these rights were prioritized. 
In adoptions, we need more adoption 
areas. We need more foster care in 
America, not less. The Equality Act 
says that if you are a faith-based adop-
tion agency that only places children 
in a home where there is a mom and 
dad there, then you either have to 
change your faith or close. You have no 
other option. The Equality Act says to 
that institution: I would rather have 
fewer adoption agencies in America 
than have you open. 
That is not protecting the rights of 
all Americans. That is not learning 
how to accommodate together. Why 
can’t we have adoption agencies that 
do adoptions in LGBT homes and some 
that do adoptions that don’t? Why 
can’t we have both? Why can’t we ac-
commodate both? The Equality Act 
does not allow that. 
The Equality Act treats every job in 
America exactly the same and says 
that an individual who is qualified for 
that job should be able to take that 
job, regardless of any issue. Let me 
give you a first example of that. 
If you have an individual going 
through TSA—and what a lovely expe-
rience that is for all of us—this Equal-
ity Act would say: When your alarm 
goes off and you have to get the full- 
body pat-down, a transgender indi-
vidual could be your TSA person giving 
you 
the 
full-body 
pat-down. 
They 
would be required to not prohibit that. 
Now, for some people, they would be 
like: I don’t care. It is a pat-down. I 
don’t care. For other people, it would 
be like—there is a reason why TSA has 
done pat-downs of a man for a man and 
a woman for a woman because there 
are many people uncomfortable with 
someone of an opposite gender who 
does that to them. They just are. 
Maybe you call them prudes, but we 
have honored their rights. The Equal-
ity Act does not. It ignores their rights 
and says that you no longer have the 
right to disagree with this, and you 
have to just accept it. 
It also dramatically changes hiring 
in America in a way that is unexplored. 
There is a reason we send bills through 
committee, not just bring them to the 
floor and demand that they pass on the 
same day they land on the floor with-
out going through committee. There is 
a reason we do that—because this bill 
changes the way hiring is done in 
America in a way that has not been 
tested for everyone. 
This adds a new feature to title VII, 
where it says, in title VII, that you 
can’t discriminate based on race, on 
sex—that has now been redefined, obvi-
ously, by the courts—on religion, all 
these things. It clarifies. You can’t dis-
criminate based on that. But it adds a 
new phrase on this. ‘‘Perception or be-
lief’’ is the new phrase. 
This is how that would be applied in 
courts. If I go to an interview in a job 
and I am not hired, I can sue that em-
ployer because I perceived they were 
thinking I was gay and so they didn’t 
hire me, or—because it applies to all of 
it—I could, actually, because this does 
expand this significantly, if I go in to 
get a job and I am not hired, I could 
sue them for not hiring me because I 
perceived that it was because I was a 
Christian and they didn’t hire me. I 
perceived that it was because I was 
White that they didn’t hire me. I don’t 
have to prove anything. It is based sim-
ply on my perception or belief. That is 
an untested expansion. 
Now, this term ‘‘perception or belief’’ 
is lifted right out of our hate crime 
statutes, but hate crime statutes, on 
their face, are all about the motive for 
it, and you are trying to read into a 
crime the motive for that crime. Now 
we are trying to literally read someone 
else’s mind in a hiring situation and to 
say that I perceived it, so if you don’t 
hire me, I can sue you. 
Why are we doing this? That opens up 
litigation all over the country on every 
area, not just on this issue of LGBT 
rights—on every situation and every 
hiring because it is very expansive. We 
probably should slow down and look at 
that before we open that floodgate in 
America, but this does not. 
Today is about demanding that it 
passes 
right 
away. 
Interestingly 
enough, as some of my colleagues have 
mentioned, the Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act is wiped away in this and 
ignored. Interestingly enough, the Su-
preme Court stated just this week that 
on this issue, Congress should apply 
this. Let me read what Justices Gins-
burg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan 
wrote this week, along with Roberts 
and Gorsuch. They said this: 
Separately, the employers fear that com-
plying with Title VII’s requirements in cases 
like ours may require some employers to 
violate their religious convictions. We are 
also deeply concerned with preserving the 
promise of the free exercise of religion en-
shrined in our Constitution; that guarantee 
lies at the heart of our pluralistic society. 
They go on to speak of we will have 
a case dealing with the Religious Free-
dom Restoration Act. The Equality 
Act, instead, says: No, never mind, Su-
preme Court. I know that you are con-
cerned about religious freedoms—Gins-
burg, 
Breyer, 
Sotomayor, 
Kagan, 
Gorsuch, 
Roberts—but 
never 
mind. 
Congress is not concerned with reli-
gious liberty like you are. 
Come on. Let’s work together. We 
don’t want anyone to be discriminated 
against—anyone. We can do this in a 
way that accommodates everyone, and 
then we can actually work toward 
agreement. 
To say it in the words of J.K. 
Rowling this past week where she 
wrote, ‘‘All I’m asking—all I want—is 
for similar empathy, similar under-
standing, to be extended to the many 
millions of women whose sole crime is 
wanting their concerns to be heard 
without receiving threats and abuse.’’ 
Let’s work together to get equality. 
This bill does not do it in this form; 
therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
am disappointed that my colleagues 
have come to the floor to stand in the 
way of a debate, in this esteemed 
Chamber, over issues of freedom, issues 
of opportunity, and issues of equality 
that affect millions of LGBTQ Ameri-
cans. 
What did we hear in their conversa-
tion? My colleague from Utah says 
there is no chance for debate. Has my 
colleague forgotten that bringing a bill 
to the floor brings it to debate? Is that 
such a lost art in the Senate that my 
colleague thinks debating a bill on the 
floor somehow squelches debate? It is a 
mystery to me how one can make the 
argument that bringing a bill to the 
floor kills debate. 
My colleague from Oklahoma la-
ments there is no committee action. 
Well, my colleague might be reminded 
that for 400 days this party has con-
trolled whether or not there is com-
mittee action on this bill; that it is the 
majority that decides whether a com-
mittee addresses the issues before it. Is 
not 400 days of inaction in committee 
an argument to have the conversation 
here as a committee of the whole? Isn’t 
that what we are asking for—a com-
mittee of the whole to debate these key 
issues? 
My colleagues have also referred to 
how somehow this bill affects religious 
rights, and I am taken back through 
the history of the conversation and 
dialogue about equality and oppor-
tunity in America, how every time we 
seek to end discrimination, someone 
says: But wait—religious rights. 
Remember that this was the argu-
ment against Black and Brown Ameri-
cans having equality here in the United 
States of America because their reli-
gion said they are not equal and they 
shouldn’t be let in the door and I 
should have the right to not let them 
in the door. 
I should have the right to discrimi-
nate. Isn’t that the conversation we 
heard 
around 
the 
opportunity 
for 
women in America to play a full role in 
our society, that people had a religious 
foundation for discriminating between 
men and women? Well, I tell you that 
this Nation, although imperfect, was 
founded on a vision that everyone is 
created equal and has a full chance to 
participate. 
We have worked over hundreds of 
years to get toward the goal that every 
child can thrive in America, no matter 
their gender, no matter the color of 
their skin, no matter if they are identi-
fied as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, no 
matter if they are transgender. That is 
the conversation we should be having 
here. 
I feel the injury of a Senate that is 
no longer a Senate, where people trem-
ble in their seats over the idea of hav-
ing a debate. What has happened to 
this esteemed body that that should be 
the case?

S3085 
June 18, 2020 
So let us not rest. For those col-
leagues across the aisle who have said 
that the Supreme Court shouldn’t have 
acted this week, that it should be the 
legislature that acts, and yet come to 
the floor and don’t argue—fail to 
argue—that we should, in fact, act, 
isn’t that obstruction of the legislative 
process? 
I would encourage my colleagues who 
say that there are important issues to 
be considered to go to their leadership 
and say ‘‘Let’s get the committee that 
has this bill, the Equality Act, to start 
doing its job: Hold the hearings; hold 
the conversation’’ because to fail to 
argue that it should be done in com-
mittee while you lament on the floor 
that the committee hasn’t acted is cer-
tainly an argument with no integrity. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3957 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
rise today to discuss the Confederate 
monuments that are in our hallowed 
Halls of Congress. I would like to make 
a live UC request, but preceding that 
request, I want to make just a few very 
brief remarks. 
The National Statuary Hall, where 
these Confederate statues are in the 
Capitol, is intended to honor the high-
est ideals of our Nation. It is intended 
to honor the spirit of our country and 
those who exhibited this spirit with 
heroism, with courage, and with dis-
tinction. 
It is a rare honor that every State 
gets to pick two people, out of the en-
tire history of the country, who so ex-
emplify the values, the spirit, and the 
honor of America. There are only 100 
statues—just 100 statues—two from 
every State. 
Between 1901 and 1931, 12—12—Confed-
erate statues were placed in the Na-
tional Statuary Hall, that hallowed 
hall. During the vast majority of that 
same period, from 1901 through 1929, 
after a vicious period of voter suppres-
sion and violence against African- 
American voters and a stripping de 
facto of their rights, and often de jure, 
not a single African American served 
in either of the Congress. In fact, the 
exact same year the first Confederate 
statue was placed in the Capitol, 1901, 
was also the year that the last African- 
American person would serve in Con-
gress for almost 30 years—almost 70 
from just the South. 
This is a period that we don’t teach 
enough about in our country. It is a pe-
riod of untold violence of domestic ter-
rorism, of the rise of the Klan and 
other White supremacist organizations 
in which, from the late 1800s to about 
1950, literally thousands of Ameri-
cans—about 
4,400 
well-documented 
cases—were lynched in this country. 
We cannot separate the Confederate 
statues from this history and legacy of 
White supremacy in this country. In-
deed, in the vast history of our Nation, 
those Confederate statues represent 4 
years—roughly 4 years—of the Confed-
eracy. The entire history of our coun-
try hails as heroes people who took up 
arms against their own Nation, people 
who sought to keep and sustain that 
vile institution of slavery, who led us 
into the bloodiest war of our country’s 
history, who lost battle after battle 
until they were defeated soundly. The 
relics of that 4-plus year period, giving 
this sacred space to these traders upon 
our Nation, is not just an assault to 
the ideals of America as a whole, but 
they are a painful, insulting, difficult 
injury being compounded to so many 
American citizens who understand the 
very desire to put people who rep-
resented 4-plus years of treason, the 
very desire to put them there in an era 
of vast terrorism, was yet another at-
tempt at the suppression of some of our 
citizens in this country. 
The continued presence of these stat-
ues in the halls is an affront to African 
Americans and the ideals of our Na-
tion. When we proclaim this not just to 
be a place of liberty and justice for all, 
but as we seek to be a more beloved na-
tion, a kinder nation, a nation of equal 
respect and equal dignity, it is an as-
sault on all of those ideals. 
I would like to ask for unanimous 
consent, but before I do so, I would like 
to yield to the Democratic leader, 
CHUCK SCHUMER. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first I want to thank my dear friend, 
the Senator from New Jersey. 
Our caucus and the American people 
are lucky to have him as such a cham-
pion, not only for this proposal but for 
all of his work in recent years on legis-
lation related to police reform, racial 
justice, and so many other issues. 
In a moment, my friend will ask to 
pass a bill that will do something very 
simple and, indeed, long overdue: It 
will remove the statues here in the 
Capitol of men who would rend this 
country apart by war in order to 
strengthen, perpetuate, and extend the 
vile institution of slavery. 
There is a movement in America 
right now that demands we confront 
the poison of racism in our country. We 
must do this in many ways, both sub-
stantive and symbolic. This bill is just 
one of many steps we must take to ac-
knowledge the painful history of Amer-
ica’s original sin—slavery—and to clar-
ify for all generations that the men 
who defended it shall hold no place of 
honor in our Nation’s history books. 
States and localities are removing 
Confederate statues in their public 
parks 
and 
municipal 
buildings. 
NASCAR has banned the Confederate 
flag at its events. We will soon debate 
renaming military installations after 
Confederate generals. Why should the 
Capitol, of all places—a symbol of the 
Union, a place where every American is 
supposed to have representation—con-
tinue to venerate such ignoble figures? 
Opponents of the bill will say that re-
moving these statues is akin to forget-
ting or trying to erase history. No, it is 
not. Remembering history is a lot dif-
ferent than celebrating it. 
We teach history in our schools and 
universities and museums. No doubt, 
the Civil War will continue to merit 
study, but statues and memorials are 
symbols of honor, and we need not re-
serve them for men who represent such 
a dishonorable cause. 
Leader MCCONNELL has ducked this 
issue and has said that the States 
should continue to decide who to send 
to the Capitol. Candidly, I don’t think 
it would be too imposing to ask our 
States not to send statues of people 
who actively fought against this coun-
try. You know, there is a reason that 
Connecticut doesn’t send a statue of 
Benedict Arnold to the Capitol. 
We have a lot of work to do to un-
wind centuries of racial injustice em-
bedded in our laws and in our institu-
tions. One of the simplest things we 
could do is to haul out the statues of a 
few old racists who represent the very 
antithesis of the building in which we 
now stand and the ideals we struggle to 
live up to. This, my friends, is the easy 
part. 
Let us pass this bill today and send a 
message to the American people that 
we are serious about dismantling insti-
tutional racism piece by piece, brick 
by brick, statue by statue, starting 
with 
our 
own 
House—the 
people’s 
House—the Nation’s Capitol Building. 
I yield again to my colleague. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, as 
in legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Rules Committee be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. 3957 and that the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration. I fur-
ther ask that the bill be read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, let me say 
that we just got this bill assigned to 
the Rules Committee. The bill would 
have the effect of abandoning agree-
ments we have entered into with the 
States and the States have entered 
into with us. 
I would certainly like to have some 
time to decide if we should have a hear-
ing on this. I would like to get the 
opinion of people who are taking simi-
lar statues out of the building. I would 
also like to find out what other States 
have in mind as their part of the agree-
ment. 
The Democratic leader just said that 
States and localities are removing 
these statues. Each of these States 
would have the right to remove this 
statue, and some are. 
This is an agreement with the States. 
It goes back to 1864. By 1933, Statuary 
Hall was full, and Congress, again, au-
thorized this program by saying that

June 18, 2020 
these statues could be placed in the 
Capitol. It took until about 2000 until 
there were 100 statues from the States. 
States are limited to two from each 
State. With 50 States, there were 100 
statues by 2000. 
At that point, the Congress passed 
another law providing a way that the 
States, for the first time, could take a 
statue out. Even in 2000, there was no 
suggestion then or before then that 
Congress would decide whether the 
statue that the State wanted to put in 
could be put into the building. 
As a matter of fact, the Presiding Of-
ficer’s State, Nebraska, just recently 
replaced Williams Jennings Bryan with 
Chief Standing Bear under the provi-
sions made to do that. 
Congress has been very prescriptive 
on how this happens. The State would 
have to pass legislation; the Governor 
would have to sign it to put a statue in 
the building; and Congress would deter-
mine only if the statue met the re-
quirements that the other statues had 
been held to. Until now, that has been 
the congressional part of this agree-
ment with the States to take a statue 
out of the collection and replace it 
with another one. My State, Missouri, 
is replacing Thomas Hart Benton with 
Harry Truman. The legislature had to 
agree what statue would go out, what 
statue would come in, and Congress 
would then accept that statue if it met 
the standards. 
Again, we can do away with that pro-
gram. We could do a lot of things. But 
we have entered into that agreement. 
The forts, as an example—and, again, 
the minority leader mentioned the 
forts. The forts are named totally by 
the Congress. I expressed my belief this 
week and last week that it would be 
absolutely appropriate, in my view, to 
review the names that the forts have 
been named after, including the forts 
that are named after Confederate mili-
tary leaders, and change those names. 
We can do that all on our own. We 
haven’t told North Carolina that a fort 
has to be named after General Bragg. 
We haven’t told Texas that a fort has 
to be named after Confederate General 
Hood. We can change those. 
I am very open to looking at that and 
likely doing that. I just think, for my 
friend from New Jersey, that this is a 
more complicated arrangement than 
activity on the floor today would sug-
gest. 
I would also point out that in 2000, 
since Congress said that you can re-
place statues with another statue—you 
have to take a statue out to put a stat-
ue in, but you can replace statues, 
eight of those statues have already 
been replaced, and eight more are in 
the process of being replaced. I think 
four or five of the statues that have 
been replaced or would be replaced 
were in the standard of the Confederate 
statues. 
I am encouraged that States are 
looking at their history, and they are 
looking at who has come since they put 
those statues in. Arkansas replaced 
Uriah Milton Rose, a Confederate stat-
ue, with Daisy Gatson Bates, a civil 
rights leader. Florida replaced Edmund 
Kirby-Smith with Mary McLeod Be-
thune, an educator, a Presidential ad-
viser, and civil rights leader. Arkansas 
is in the process of replacing one of 
these statues. 
I think that today’s action would 
violate our agreement with the States. 
I frankly thank my friend from New 
Jersey for encouraging the Governors, 
encouraging the speakers of the house 
to do what they have every right—and 
the Congress, in fact, in 2000, gave 
them the right—to do. 
The minority leader was the chair-
man of the committee that determines 
all of this just a handful of years ago 
and took no actions to do what the 
Senate is talking about doing today. 
So with that in mind, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, if I 
could just respond—I know how busy 
my colleague is. He has a well-earned 
reputation on both sides of this body 
for his sincerity, for his decency, and 
for his honor. I take to heart his words 
that this is often not a good forum in 
which to try to push a piece of legisla-
tion that might have controversy on 
both sides. I understand his sincere 
concerns with that. 
I guess he also understands the sin-
cerity with which I bring this up: the 
hurt and the pain that these statues 
represent in a place where millions of 
Americans come to the Capitol and see 
this as their body. 
I say to the Senator, because there 
are complications in this and there are 
issues we would have to work through 
as a Senate, I guess the one last appeal 
to your more senior status and maybe 
your friendship is this: Will you join 
me, at least, on a letter to the appro-
priate committee, asking them to at 
least have a hearing on this issue so 
that we could have a full vetting of all 
of the complexities and have a real dis-
cussion on something that is a pressing 
concern? I note that you know it is a 
pressing concern because some States 
are already taking action. 
You see this action being taken 
across various parts of our country. 
You see this issue being pushed into 
the national consciousness. You see 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, 
from 
Nikki Haley to my dear friend, the 
former mayor of New Orleans, Mayor 
Landrieu—I think it would be just and 
right that, perhaps, you and I, in a 
show of bipartisan concern and sincere 
awareness of the complexity of this 
issue, could just join—the two of us—in 
a letter asking the committee to take 
up this issue in due time so that we can 
have an appropriate discussion from all 
perspectives on this issue. 
Mr. BLUNT. If I could have the 
chance to respond here—— 
Mr. BOOKER. Of course. 
Mr. BLUNT. This bill was just as-
signed to our committee. This is a dis-
cussion that, I guess appropriately, we 
might have had before I was asked to 
come to the floor to assert the rights of 
the committee, to have the oppor-
tunity to think about that. I don’t 
know that I want to negotiate that 
right here. But as I said, and my friend 
heard just a moment ago, I would like 
to hear from the States that are re-
placing statues and I would like to 
hear from the States that are thinking 
about replacing statues if this is a 
problem in the process of, under the 
current structure, solving itself. 
I am glad to have continued discus-
sions about this. I certainly don’t im-
pugn my friend’s motives. You know, 
you can question somebody’s decision 
to maybe bring a bill this quickly to 
the floor without giving us a chance to 
talk about it, but I have no interest, 
then, in impugning my friend’s motives 
and understand some of the concerns 
my friend would have on this topic. 
Mr. BOOKER. Thank you, sir. 
If I may, I will make a personal ap-
peal for a hearing on these matters. I 
hope that we can do that in due time. 
I know the pace at which the Senate 
often works, but I am grateful for this 
open dialogue and I know you had to 
adjust your schedule so I am grateful 
for your time and generosity. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Texas. 
DACA 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, 8 
years ago almost to the day, President 
Obama announced the Deferred Action 
for Childhood Arrival, otherwise known 
as DACA. At the time, I remember the 
conversations a number of us had with 
President Obama, saying please give us 
a chance to work this out by passing 
appropriate legislation in the Congress. 
He heard those pleas, but in spite of 
the fact of saying numerous times he 
did not have the authority to do so, he 
proceeded to issue a memorandum that 
gave rise to the DACA program. 
Rather than rolling up our sleeves 
and working together to create lasting 
immigration policy, President Obama 
chose to do this through an Executive 
memorandum. It is that Executive 
memorandum that has made its way 
through the courts over the last 8 years 
and finally to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Unfortunately, this is the bitter fruit 
of what President Obama did when he 
attempted to usurp Congress in a way 
to provide certainty and comfort to 
hundreds of thousands of young peo-
ple—a goal that we all share—but to do 
so in a way that ultimately created 
more harm. It sent them on a years’ 
long tumultuous journey, which is not 
over with the Supreme Court decision 
today. Basically, what the Supreme 
Court said was, under the Administra-
tive Procedure Act, he didn’t do it the 
right way, so go back and try it again 
and get it right this time. 
Well, I think these young people de-
serve better. The debate over President

Obama’s authority has held these indi-
viduals hostage, leaving them won-
dering if they might ultimately be de-
ported to a country they have no mem-
ory of and forced to leave their fami-
lies, their jobs, and the opportunities 
they have worked so hard to build here 
in the United States behind. 
Make no mistake about it, today the 
Supreme Court ruled that the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security didn’t fol-
low the proper procedures to rescind 
the DACA program and thus allowed 
the program to continue for now, but 
this is just a temporary measure. 
DACA recipients must have a perma-
nent legislative solution. They deserve 
nothing less. These young men and 
women have done nothing wrong. They 
came to the United States as children, 
and in America, we don’t hold children 
responsible for the mistakes of their 
parents, in this case, the mistake of 
not going through the legal immigra-
tion process. So these kids—young peo-
ple, I should say—are innocent. 
Texas is home to more than 100,000 
DACA recipients who are a vital part of 
our communities. They have grown up 
with our kids, attended the same 
churches, shopped at the same stores, 
and defended our freedoms in the U.S. 
military. Many of these young people 
are in their 30s now with careers, fami-
lies, plans, hopes and dreams of their 
own. 
So the uncertainty about their status 
and what will happen to them is no less 
terrifying for them than it would be for 
any of us. It is simply unfair for these 
young people who, again, through no 
fault of their own, find themselves in 
this situation to rely solely on an Ex-
ecutive memorandum instead of a law 
passed by Congress. I believed that 
when President Obama rejected our re-
quest to work with Congress and come 
up with a permanent solution, and I be-
lieve it now. 
I believe the Supreme Court has 
thrust upon us a unique moment and 
an opportunity. We need to take action 
and pass legislation that will unequivo-
cally allow these young men and 
women to stay in the only home in the 
only country they have ever known. 
In the past, I have supported a num-
ber of bills that would have allowed 
these individuals to remain in the 
United States without the fear of a 
court decision hanging in the balance, 
but each time, partisan disagreements 
have prevented us from turning any-
thing into law. When it comes to immi-
gration laws, Congress, on a bipartisan 
basis, never fails to fail. 
Well, I hope we can all agree, given 
this opportunity, that it is not time for 
politics as usual, but it is time to pro-
vide some certainty, some compassion, 
some support for these young men and 
women. After years of being yanked 
around from courtroom to courtroom, 
these young men and women deserve 
that certainty. They deserve to know 
that, when they apply to college, grow 
up with their families, live their lives, 
and do all the things everybody else 
wants to do, that they can do so with-
out a dark cloud hanging over their 
plans. But, as usual, in order to come 
up with any solution, it is going to 
take buy-in from the Senate, House, 
and White House. 
I have been having conversations for 
years about this topic, but most re-
cently, I have been having conversa-
tions about the most efficient and ef-
fective way to protect these young peo-
ple in the long-term, and I am willing 
to work with anyone, Republican or 
Democrat, who is interested in solving 
the problem—not grandstanding, not 
posturing, not acting like you care 
when you really don’t, elevating poli-
tics over a solution. I am not inter-
ested in that. If anyone is interested in 
solving the problem and providing sup-
port for these young people, I am all in. 
Over the years, I have engaged with 
the Texas Hispanic Chambers of Com-
merce, LULAC, Catholic bishops, and a 
number of other individuals and orga-
nizations that share my commitment 
to providing certainty for these young 
people. I hope we can come together 
and help them. These folks want noth-
ing more than to continue to be part of 
the American dream. I hope we can de-
liver. 
JUNETEENTH 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter. One of the most defining days in 
our Nation’s history was when Presi-
dent Lincoln issued the Emancipation 
Proclamation on January 1, 1863, fi-
nally freeing all slaves in Confederate 
territory, but slaves in Texas wouldn’t 
learn this life-altering news for 21⁄2 
years. 
I know it is hard for us to under-
stand. Now, we can tweet and commu-
nicate instantaneously, but it took 21⁄2 
years for slaves in the South to learn 
that they were free. That day came on 
a day we now celebrate as Juneteenth. 
That was the day that Major General 
Gordon Granger and the Union troops 
arrived in Galveston, TX, and shared 
the news to formerly enslaved people 
that they were now free. These free 
men and women set out to spread this 
news, with many traveling toward 
Houston, and eventually reaching more 
than 250,000 slaves throughout Texas. 
As we do every year, tomorrow, Tex-
ans will celebrate Juneteenth and the 
155th anniversary of the end of slavery 
in our State. It is an opportunity to re-
flect on our history, the mistakes we 
have made, but yet how far we have 
come in the fight for equality and a re-
minder of just how far we still have to 
go. That is especially true this year. 
Over the last several weeks, Ameri-
cans of all races, backgrounds, and of 
all ages have raised their voices in the 
fight against inequality and injustice 
that continues to exist in our society, 
especially those in our criminal justice 
system. As the list of Black men and 
women killed by police officers in cus-
tody grows, the calls for action are get-
ting louder and louder, as they must 
and as they should. There is a clear and 
urgent need for leaders at every level 
to come together and to deliver the 
change that we need to deliver in order 
to match up with our ideals. 
I and others have said before, slavery 
was the original sin of the United 
States of America. We said: We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal and at the same 
time embraced a system that didn’t ac-
knowledge African Americans as being 
fully human. That was a sin. We have 
been paying a bitter price throughout 
our Nation’s history. While we have 
come a long way, we know there is 
more we need to do. 
JUSTICE ACT 
In the context of police reforms, our 
friend Senator TIM SCOTT from South 
Carolina has introduced a bill which I 
have cosponsored, as have many other 
Members of the Senate. It is called the 
JUSTICE Act, and it will reform our 
police departments to provide much- 
needed 
transparency 
and 
account-
ability. It takes aim at a number of 
practices and policies that have led to 
a number of tragic deaths, that have 
united these nationwide protests and 
captured our conscience. 
To prevent these tragedies from hap-
pening in the first place, this bill em-
phasizes things such as deescalation 
training. As I looked at the video of 
the two police officers in Atlanta, wak-
ing up somebody asleep in a fast-food 
line, then interrogating him for 45 min-
utes before it then broke out into a 
violent confrontation, I thought they 
could have used some deescalation 
training. Maybe, just maybe, a life 
would have been saved. Maybe they 
would have said: Give us your car keys, 
take a cab, go home, and sleep it off. 
But that is not what happened. 
We also need training for police offi-
cers that otherwise haven’t had that 
training or don’t know to know when 
they need to intervene when they see 
another officer exert excessive force. 
We need more transparency—things 
like body cameras—and we need more 
information on things like use of force 
and no-knock warrants so that we can 
hopefully come up with a set of best 
practices that police departments all 
across the country should employ. 
To gain a better understanding of the 
problems that exist throughout our 
criminal justice system—and this is 
just one of them—the bill establishes 
two commissions, one to perform a top- 
to-bottom review of our criminal jus-
tice system and another to study the 
challenges facing Black men and boys. 
This legislation would also make 
lynching a Federal crime, it takes aim 
at the dangerous practice of choke 
holds, and it strengthens minority hir-
ing. I could go on and on, but I believe 
these changes have the potential to 
create real and lasting change in Amer-
ica’s police departments and begin to 
repair the broken relationship between 
law enforcement and the communities 
they serve. 
Beyond the merits of the bill itself, 
there is another quality worth noting, 
and that is it includes a number of

measures that have bipartisan support. 
In other words, there is a lot of overlap 
between what Democrats want to do 
and what Republicans want to do. We 
have to just learn how to take yes for 
an answer. 
We all want to get 100 percent of 
what we want, but as a practical mat-
ter, you need to follow the 80/20 rule 
sometimes. That is, if you can get 80 
percent of what you want, that Repub-
licans and Democrats can agree on, 
then you need to grab it. That is what 
we need to do here, not focus on the 
differences, but focus on the com-
monality, on the overlap. 
By the way, when I first got to the 
Senate, Teddy Kennedy was one of the 
great liberal lions here. I asked one of 
my conservative colleagues, the senior 
Senator from Wyoming who worked 
very productively with him, how they 
did it, one of the most liberal Members 
of the Senate, one of the most conserv-
ative Members of the Senate. Senator 
ENZI, our friend from Wyoming, said: It 
is easy. It is the 80/20 rule. 
That is how they were so productive. 
That is how they got so much done. 
They didn’t focus on what separated 
them; they focused on what they 
shared in common, and that is what we 
need to do particularly now at this 
time to demonstrate to America that 
we hear you, we understand the reason 
for the protests. We understand the 
reason for concern, and we share your 
anguish when innocent lives are lost. 
Madam President, as we prepare to 
debate the JUSTICE Act on the floor 
next 
week, 
finding 
that 
common 
ground is more important than ever, 
but I am worried that the same old par-
tisan dysfunction which hijacks so 
many good ideas here in the Congress 
may dominate over our need to actu-
ally pass legislation. 
I hope our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle will allow us to get on 
the bill, and hopefully, we will have an 
amendment process that will allow 
them to contribute, maybe even make 
the bill better. That is what we should 
do. That is what we used to do in the 
Senate. We had debates, we offered 
amendments, and then we voted. 
We didn’t shut it down before we 
even got it started, which is what I 
know—at least based on press reports— 
Senator SCHUMER, Senator HARRIS, and 
others are considering doing, voting no 
and not allowing us to get on the bill 
in the first place. 
Well, this is an important moment. 
We will begin debating this legislation 
on the floor of the Senate next week, 
and we will demonstrate whether we 
have risen to the challenge, whether we 
have set aside political and partisan 
differences in order to find the common 
good or not, so I hope our discussions 
will prove more productive than what 
we have seen reported so far. 
As we continue to try our best to de-
liver for the American people, I encour-
age all of us to remember the impor-
tance of the 80/20 rule. There is a lot 
more that unites us than divides us. I 
know the news, social media, and 
maybe in our debates we seem to focus 
on who divides us, but that is not who 
we are, what divides us. We are what 
unites us. There is a lot more that 
unites us. 
Tomorrow, I will be privileged to be 
in the city of my birth, Houston, TX, 
with Mayor Sylvester Turner and a 
number of community leaders for a 
roundtable to talk about these very 
issues. I was in Dallas last week doing 
the same thing with my friend, the 
mayor, Eric Johnson, and it really a 
great opportunity to do something that 
Members 
of 
the 
Senate 
don’t 
do 
enough, myself included, and that is to 
listen. 
I am excited to report on what we are 
doing here, but more importantly, I am 
eager to spend some time listening and 
learning from the people closest to the 
problem and then bringing that knowl-
edge back here to the floor of the U.S. 
Senate so that we can deliver real re-
sults for the American people. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that it be in order for Senators 
GRASSLEY, PORTMAN, BROWN, and CRUZ 
to be recognized and complete their re-
marks prior to the confirmation vote 
on the Walker nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that additional ma-
terial be printed in the RECORD after 
my remarks. 
INSPECTORS GENERAL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. In recent months, a 
lot of attention has focused on the Na-
tion’s inspectors general. It seems like 
a good idea to take a few minutes now 
to remember what inspectors general 
are, why Congress created them in the 
first place, and how we got here. 
Congress first established offices of 
inspectors general in 1978 ‘‘to create 
independent and objective units’’ in the 
Federal 
Government 
to 
do 
three 
things: conduct audits and investiga-
tions; No. 2, promote efficiency and de-
termine fraud and abuse; and No. 3, 
keep agency heads and Congress ‘‘fully 
informed’’ about the problems that IGs 
find. 
In short, Congress designed inspec-
tors general to shine a bright light on 
waste, fraud, and abuse throughout the 
Federal bureaucracy with the hope 
that the executive and legislative 
branches could work together to do 
something about those problems. 
IGs, then, are the original swamp 
drainers, and—an equally important 
point for those who weren’t around at 
the time it was created—the support 
for creating these offices was breath-
takingly bipartisan. The vote in the 
House of Representatives where I was 
then a Member was 388 to 6. Now, more 
than 40 years later, we have 75 offices 
of inspectors general working to stop 
fraud and abuse. 
Their actions also save the taxpayers 
billions of dollars. In 2020 so far, IGs 
have identified more than $20 billion of 
potential savings through their audits, 
reports, and recommendations—$20 bil-
lion—and this year is not even half 
over. On oversight.gov, you can find 
the latest figures on these watchdogs’ 
contributions, as well as investigative 
and audit reports on every kind of 
topic you can think of. IGs have found 
everything from blatant government 
employee misconduct to procurement 
fraud and, of course, much more. It is 
all there in black and white in the pub-
lic domain for all to see. These inspec-
tors 
general 
are 
helping 
Congress 
watch over the people’s business and 
ensure the fidelity of agency action. 
We in Congress cannot perform our 
constitutional mandates of oversight 
without IGs. The IGs’ work makes gov-
ernment more transparent and more 
accountable, and that strengthens the 
public trust in our democracy. That is 
a good thing for Congress and a good 
thing for the Presidency. In this way, 
these watchdogs serve an indispensable 
function in our system of checks and 
balances. 
What makes a good inspector gen-
eral? If I learned anything about over-
sight, it is that this type of work is not 
for the faint-hearted or the thin- 
skinned or the thick-headed. You need 
a strong code of professionalism to 
withstand pressures to go along to get 
along. You need a real backbone to 
wring wrongdoing from the bowels of 
bureaucracy, and you need a quick wit 
to look on smiling faces and discern 
truths from half-truths and bald-faced 
lies. 
The law says IGs are supposed to be 
objective and independent. They have 
to be fierce watchdogs, not lap dogs. 
They can’t bow to personal agenda or 
political 
machinations, 
and 
they 
shouldn’t be subject to inappropriate 
political pressure from any corner 
whatsoever. 
When IGs are working hard, staying 
independent, and shining the light on 
waste, fraud, and abuse, they should 
stay. But when they don’t put in the 
work, when they pull the punches, 
when they became political hacks, or 
when they compromise their vital inde-
pendence, then IGs must go. 
For many years, I have investigated 
and held accountable IGs from both 
Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations for these very failures. In 2003, 
I pushed the Health and Human Serv-
ices IG to resign over whistleblower 
complaints about poor staff manage-
ment. I also investigated allegations of 
poor work product, coercive manage-
ment decisions, and questionable hir-
ing practices by the watchdog at the 
Federal Housing Finance Agency. Just 
last year, I began pushing hard to get 
to the bottom of whistleblower com-
plaints about another apparently inef-
fective Commerce IG, although the 
media at that time didn’t seem to care 
about that despite bipartisan concerns 
and briefings from my staff. 
Alternatively, when IGs come under 
fire for doing good work, this Senator

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 18, 2020 
has their backs. In 2009, I shined a light 
on a sudden departure of the Amtrak 
IG, who signed a gag order in exchange 
for significant payout. 
When 
the 
Obama 
administration 
blocked a broad swath of the IG com-
munity from assessing records needed 
for oversight, I worked across the aisle 
to introduce and finally pass the In-
spector General Empowerment Act in 
2016. 
In short, I have gone to the mat my 
whole career to ensure inspectors gen-
eral do and are able to accomplish 
their work with support, independence, 
and integrity. And because this work is 
so critical to Congress and our over-
sight role and to the public trust, I 
have worked hard to ensure that any 
effort to remove an IG is for a darn 
good reason. That is what Congress re-
quired in the IG Reform Act of 2008, a 
law that then-Senator Obama not only 
voted for, but he cosponsored. 
That law recognizes two things. 
First, it is the President’s constitu-
tional prerogative to manage the exec-
utive branch personnel. The President 
can fire an IG. Second, it is Congress’s 
intent in that law to support IG inde-
pendence and maintain public trust. 
IGs should not be removed for blatant 
political reasons. This requires that 
Presidents tell Congress and the people 
their reasons for removal of an IG. 
The IG Reform Act codified those 
principles by requiring the President to 
submit to Congress a notice of intent 
to remove an IG 30 days in advance and 
to explain why. The executive branch, 
under two successive Presidencies of 
both political parties, has sought to ig-
nore the law and keep Congress in the 
dark. Both Presidents provided Con-
gress then with paltry excuses of ‘‘lost 
confidence.’’ 
In July 2009, less than a year after 
Congress passed the IG Reform Act, 
then-President Obama removed the in-
spector general for the Corporation for 
National and Community Service, Ger-
ald Walpin, from his post and placed 
him on administrative leave. Obama’s 
White House informed Congress merely 
that President Obama had lost con-
fidence in Mr. Walpin. 
My colleagues and I made it very 
clear that a vague reference to ‘‘loss of 
confidence’’ was insufficient and did 
not satisfy the requirements of the 
very law that President Obama voted 
for and cosponsored when he was a Sen-
ator. This began a bout of negotiations 
that resulted in the hold of Presi-
dential nominees and, eventually, a bi-
cameral congressional investigation. 
In that case, I pushed for compliance 
with the statute, held up nominees to 
obtain information, and disagreed with 
the stated reasons for Mr. Walpin’s re-
moval. Mr. Walpin was never rein-
stated. In Mr. Walpin’s case, a Federal 
court found later that despite a clear 
congressional record to the contrary, 
the law doesn’t require more than what 
President Obama gave us in any other 
greater detail beyond its ‘‘minimal 
statutory mandate’’ to justify the re-
moval of Mr. Walpin. 
Fast forward to the last several 
months when the current President fol-
lowed the court’s incorrect ruling and 
the Obama precedent by removing two 
Senate-confirmed IGs, placing them on 
administrative leave and telling Con-
gress only, as Obama once did before, 
that he had lost confidence in them. 
In response, I did exactly what I had 
done before in the Obama administra-
tion. I, and several colleagues, wrote 
asking for a better explanation. When 
we finally got a response from the 
White House Counsel, we were left 
without substantive reasons for the 
IG’s removal. 
So, as before, I notified the majority 
leader of my intent to object to the 
two administrative nominees until the 
White House coughed up some form of 
rationale for the removal. I finally got 
those reasons this week. I don’t agree 
with all of them, and I am working to 
better understand others, but because 
the President has finally fulfilled the 
law, both Congress and the public can 
look to see for themselves what hap-
pened. 
This, of course, was the intent of the 
law all along. 
We took the long road to get here, 
and we could have avoided all this hul-
labaloo if both Presidents Obama and 
Trump had just followed the statutory 
notice requirements in the first place, 
but we are here. 
These episodes have convinced me 
that the executive branch, regardless 
of what party is in charge, just doesn’t 
get it. From one administration to the 
next, 
Democrat 
or 
Republican, 
it 
makes no difference to me. This isn’t 
about politics. This is about the sepa-
ration of powers, checks and balances, 
public trust. It is clear that Congress 
can’t rely on any White House to get it 
right. 
We need to change the law. We need 
to be clearer, and we need to better 
safeguard the independence of these 
IGs. That is why I have been devel-
oping bipartisan reforms to sharpen 
the independent authority and recruit-
ment of those hired and confirmed to 
serve as inspectors general. 
We are not going to enact a clearly 
unconstitutional law that infringes on 
the President’s authority to manage 
personnel and that would surely result 
in lengthy court battles. But we are 
going to clarify once and for all that 
the law’s notice requirement means 
that Presidents have to give clear, sub-
stantive reasons for removing an IG 
and that they can’t put an IG on ad-
ministrative leave without a good rea-
son. 
To fully safeguard statutorily re-
quired IG independence, we are also 
going to make sure that the President 
cannot place political appointees with 
clear conflicts of interest into acting 
IG roles. We can’t have individuals 
with political day jobs simultaneously 
in charge of confidential, independent 
IG matters, including substantive and 
sensitive audits, investigative work, 
and whistleblower information. 
Today, I have introduced that legis-
lation with my colleagues Senators 
PETERS, 
COLLINS, 
FEINSTEIN, 
LANKFORD, CARPER, ROMNEY, TESTER, 
PORTMAN, and HASSAN. I want to thank 
Ranking Member PETERS for working 
with me on this. His input has been in-
sightful in crafting this bipartisan leg-
islation, and his staff has been diligent 
in furthering these efforts. 
Whether you have been following the 
important work of inspectors general 
for many years or you just tuned in for 
the last few, we welcome your support. 
I hope that support continues well past 
the current administration. If we don’t 
update the law, we can only expect fu-
ture administrations to continue to do 
what has been done lately, not giving 
Congress good reasons. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
THE WHITE HOUSE, 
Washington, June 12, 2020. 
Hon. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, 
Chairman, Committee on Finance, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY: I write to fol-
low up on our recent conversation regarding 
the removal of the Inspectors General of the 
Department of State and of the Intelligence 
Community. As a further accommodation, 
we are providing the additional information 
you requested. 
With respect to the State Department In-
spector General, please see the attached let-
ter sent to you today from the Department’s 
Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs. 
The letter includes materials that identify 
the concerns of the Secretary of State and 
the Under Secretary for Management with 
the Inspector General’s performance. As to 
the removal of the Inspector General of the 
Intelligence Community, the President lost 
confidence in him and has spoken publicly 
about this loss of confidence, including on 
the day after the President notified Congress 
of his decision. 
As you have stated, the President has the 
constitutional authority to remove inspec-
tors general. As a matter of accommodation 
and presidential prerogative, the President 
complied fully with the statutory notifica-
tion provision of the Inspector General Act. 
As I said in my previous letter, the Presi-
dent appreciates and respects your long-
standing support for the role that inspectors 
general play. We look forward to the Sen-
ate’s swift confirmation of all of the Presi-
dent’s outstanding inspector general nomi-
nees. 
Sincerely, 
PAT A. CIPOLLONE, 
Counsel to the President. 
The following excerpt from an official 
White House transcript entitled ‘‘Remarks 
by President Trump, Vice President PENCE, 
and members of the Coronavirus Task Force

April 4, 2020 in the James S. Brady Press 
Room of the White House at 4:15 p.m. EDT.

that? How does that play?

great. But we’re paying people. We have to 
get back to work. That’s what I’m saying. 
Go ahead, please. 
Q: Mr. President, this is off topic. It’s 
about the announcement from last night. It’s 
a yes or no question, but not that we expect 
the answer to be yes or no. 
But wasn’t Michael Atkinson doing the job 
of the Inspector General of the intelligence 
community, the job he was supposed to do, 
when he simply took the whistleblower com-
plaint to Congress that hadn’t been taken 
previously? Wasn’t he doing the job that he 
was supposed to do, that American taxpayers 
were paying him to do? And why did you de-
cide to terminate— 
THE PRESIDENT: I thought he did a ter-
rible job. Absolutely terrible. He took a 
whistleblower report, which turned out to be 
a fake report—it was fake. It was totally 
wrong. It was about my conversation with 
the President of Ukraine. He took a fake re-
port and he brought it to Congress, with an 
emergency. Okay? Not a big Trump fan— 
that, I can tell you. 
Instead of saying—and we offered this to 
him: ‘‘No, no, we will take the conversa-
tion’’—where, fortunately, we had that tran-
script. If we didn’t have a transcript with the 
kind of deception and dishonesty that were 
practiced by the Democrats, I might not be 
standing here right now. Okay? Fortunately, 
we had a transcript and it was a perfect tran-
script, because even the lieutenant colonel 
admitted it was correct. Okay? 
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You asked 
a question. 
So he took this whistleblower—and I keep 
saying, ‘‘Where’s the whistleblower?’’ Right? 
‘‘And why was the whistleblower allowed to 
do this?’’ Why was he allowed to be—you call 
it fraudulent or incorrect transcript. 
So we offered this IG—I don’t know him; I 
don’t think I ever met him. I don’t think I— 
he never even came in to see me. How can 
you do that without seeing the person? Never 
came in to see me. Never requested to see 
me. He took this terrible, inaccurate whis-
tleblower report—right?—and he brought it 
to Congress. 
We offered to have him see my exact con-
versation. It was all about the conversation, 
by the way. That was the whole thing, was 
about the conversation. Right? And then 
after he saw it, he must’ve said, ‘‘Wow,’’ be-
cause as I’ve said it many times and it drives 
you people crazy, it was a perfect conversa-
tion. 
So instead of going and saying, ‘‘Gee, this 
is a terrible thing he said about the Presi-
dent’s conversation’’—well, it was a fraud. I 
didn’t say that. And, by the way, you have 
the whistleblower. Where’s the informer? 
Right? 
And here’s another question: Remember 
before I did the—before I gave the tran-
script—in other words, before I revealed the 
real conversation—where’s the second whis-
tleblower? Remember the second whistle— 
Wait, wait, wait, wait. There was going to 
be a second whistleblower. But after I gave 
the conversation, he just went away. He mi-
raculously went away. 
Where’s the informer? Because there was 
going to be this informer. Maybe Schiff was 
the informer. You ever think of that? He’s a 
corrupt guy. He’s a corrupt politician. 
So, listen, I say this: Where’s the informer? 
Remember, the informer was coming for-
ward. But I gave—because, see, I did one 
thing that surprised everybody. This gen-
tleman right here said, ‘‘Boy, that was a 
shocker.’’ I revealed the conversation. I got 
approval from Ukraine because I didn’t want 
to do it without their approval. And they 
said, ‘‘Absolutely. You did nothing wrong.’’ 
By the way, President of Ukraine, Foreign 
Minister said, ‘‘He did nothing wrong.’’ And 
over that, with 196 to nothing vote by the 
Republicans—not one dissenting Republican 
vote—dishonest 
Democrats 
impeached 
a 
President of the United States. That man is 
a disgrace to IGs. 
All right, let’s go. Next. Please. He’s a 
total disgrace. 
Q: Mr. President, did you run by your deci-
sion to dismiss the Inspector General by Sen-
ator McConnell? 
THE PRESIDENT: Okay, we’ll get off this 
because people want to talk about what 
we’re talking about. But let me just tell you 
something: That’s my decision. I have the 
absolute right. Even the fake news last night 
said, ‘‘He has the absolute right to do it.’’ 
But ask him, ‘‘Why didn’t you go and see 
the actual conversation?’’ There was no rush. 
He said, ‘‘Oh we’d have to rush it.’’ He even 
said it was politically biased. He actually 
said that. The report could have been—you 
know who the whistleblower is, and so do 
you and so does everybody in this room, and 
so do I. Everybody knows. But they give this 
whistleblower a status that he doesn’t de-
serve. He’s a fake whistleblower. And, frank-
ly, somebody ought to sue his ass off. 
Q: I just want to follow up, sir. 
THE PRESIDENT: All right, it’s enough 
with the whistleblower. 
Go ahead, please. 
Q: Mr. President, the governor of New York 
today said that he is still desperate for ven-
tilators and that he has accepted 1,000 of 
them from the Chinese government. Are you 
concerned that states— 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, what he didn’t say 
is—okay, let me tell you what he didn’t say. 
Two very good friends of mine brought him 
those whistleblower—brought him those ven-
tilators, right? Two very good friends of 
mine—they brought them. If you’d like their 
name, I’ll give you their name. 
Q: But should states and cities have to rely 
on— 
THE PRESIDENT: No, but he—the gov-
ernor didn’t— 
Q: —China and Russia for supplies? 
THE PRESIDENT: —mention that. It came 
through the Chinese—the country of China. 
But they were given by two friends of mine, 
but he didn’t tell you that. 
Now, the governor also— 
Q Who are your friends? 
THE PRESIDENT: You’ll see when you 
read the letter. 
The governor also asked for 40,000—40,000. 
He wanted 40,000 ventilators. 
Now, the governor, as you know, had a 
chance to get 16,000 a few years ago. He de-
cided not to get that. The State of New York 
has asked for help. I’ve given him four hos-
pitals, four medical centers. Then I gave him 
an additional hospital. Then I gave him mili-
tary people to operate the hospital. They 
were not supposed to be COVID hospitals. 
The boat—the ship is not—an interesting 
thing happened with the ship. People aren’t 
in accidents because there’s nobody driving. 
There’s nobody taking motorcycle rides 
down the West Side Highway at 100 miles an 
hour. People are away. So people aren’t 
being injured. 
Now they’re asking whether or not we 
could open up the ship for COVID. We have 
given the governor of New York more than 
anybody has ever been given in a long time. 
I’ll just say—I was going to say ‘‘in history,’’ 
but in a long time. And I think he’s happy. 
But I think that—because I watched what 
he said today, and it was fine. I wouldn’t say 
gracious. It wasn’t gracious. It was okay. I 
must tell you, Gavin Newsom has been gra-
cious—Los Angeles, California, the job we’ve 
done, and all of California. 
Q: But why does that matter if they’re gra-
cious or not gracious if they need the sup-
plies? 
THE PRESIDENT: It doesn’t matter. It 
doesn’t matter. But I think when we’ve given 
as much as we’ve given to New York, some-
body should say— 
Nice—I’ll tell you who’s been very nice: 
Mayor de Blasio has been very nice. He un-
derstands what we’ve given him. We brought 
him some more ventilators, too, yesterday. 
But nobody has been given like New York. 
And I think—I know he appreciates it. He 
just can’t quite get the words out, but that’s 
okay. 
Q: So when he says—but when he says that 
he needs 40,000— 
Q: Mr. President— 
THE PRESIDENT: Please, go ahead. 
THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 3 
weeks, America will celebrate Inde-
pendence Day. For 244 years, Ameri-
cans have fought, marched, voted, peti-
tioned, legislated, published, protested, 
and died to defend and build our bless-
ings of freedom. The American experi-
ment has plenty of battle scars and 
growing pains handed down from one 
generation to the next. 
The first half of 2020 shows us there 
are plenty of historical wounds to heal 
and challenges to overcome. 
In the interest of public health, stay- 
at-home orders limited individual free-
doms that many Americans take for 
granted, including the right to earn a 
living or to worship with fellow believ-
ers. 
Just as the economy began to reopen, 
the shadows of racial injustice dark-
ened America’s doorstep. All people are 
created equal, but not all people are 
treated equally. 
The unconscionable suffocation of 
George Floyd at the knee of a police of-
ficer in Minneapolis struck a chord of 
unity to end racism in America. Hun-
dreds of thousands of people have gath-
ered to exercise their First Amendment 
rights. They march to protect racial 
injustice and police brutality. 
Unfortunately, some exploited the 
peaceful protests to riot, loot, van-
dalize, and burn. These criminal acts 
were not protected by the Constitu-
tion. It is obvious they weren’t pro-
tected. They were antithetical to the 
laws of the land protecting life, liberty, 
and domestic tranquility. 
All of this led one of my colleagues, 
the junior Senator from Arkansas, to 
submit an essay to the New York 
Times. In his opinion piece, he advo-
cated why he thought the President 
ought to use his authority to deploy 
Active-Duty military forces to uphold 
the law and public order, as had been 
done by Presidents in past instances of 
civil unrest. 
The Times op-ed pages accepted his 
column and published it online under 
the headline: ‘‘Bring in the Troops.’’ 
Within hours, the newsroom was in a 
frenzy. 
The 
leftwing 
rallied 
their 
troops to stop the press. The New York 
Times, as we know, prides itself as the 
‘‘paper of record.’’ 
Since 1851, it has served as an influ-
ential platform to gather and report 
the news and to hold government ac-
countable. Policemen keep the public 
peace. Journalists are the policemen of

our political system to keep the polit-
ical system honest and open and trans-
parent. 
The New York Times opinion pages 
ostensibly provide a space for the free 
exchange of ideas and thought-filled 
conversation on issues of the day. I 
have long counted journalists as the 
constables of the fourth estate. They 
serve a very vital role in bolstering our 
system of checks and balances. They 
have a responsibility to set the tone for 
open dialogue. 
Last week, the New York Times 
flunked this standard. The Gray Lady 
ghosted Senator COTTON’s opinion piece 
after a meltdown in its ivory tower and 
when 
the 
ivory 
tower 
workforce 
hyperventilated. 
It is certainly reasonable to disagree 
on the merits and to debate if recent 
events rise to the level of past riots 
that justified invoking the Insurrec-
tion Act. 
I certainly think we should be hesi-
tant to deploy our military forces do-
mestically, even in difficult situations. 
But the overheated reaction by al-
leged journalists even to have this de-
bate raises the question, Do they con-
sider themselves neutral reporters or 
activists for a certain world view? 
Even a casual reader is able to read 
between the lines and know that the 
New York Times ascribes to a left-lean-
ing ideology, but the mutiny in their 
newsroom seems to cross the line from 
journalism with a leftwing bias to po-
litical activism and ideological con-
formity. 
Sadly, last week the New York Times 
lowered the bar of journalistic integ-
rity. It snubbed a voice of dissent and 
rebuked the free exchange of ideas. 
The First Amendment protects five 
fundamental freedoms that sets Amer-
ica apart as the leader of the free 
world: freedom of religion, speech, 
press, assembly, and the right to peti-
tion the government. 
The Constitution does so because the 
expression of diverse opinions is nec-
essary to preserve liberty. 
Within 4 days of publishing Senator 
COTTON’s commentary, the New York 
Times caved to an ideological revolt in 
the newsroom. 
Under mob rule, the casualty among 
its ranks was none other than the edi-
torial page editor. He was forced out of 
his job for having the audacity to pub-
lish an opinion of a U.S. Senator. 
At first, the publisher made a feeble 
effort to stand on principle, defending, 
in his words, ‘‘openness and a range of 
opinions.’’ Within a few days, the pub-
lisher threw James Bennet under the 
bus. 
It is a sad day for journalism, a sad 
day for the free press. These actions 
damage the wall dividing the newsroom 
and the opinion desk. They solidified 
their silo of leftwing thought. Can-
celing dissenting views is a very slip-
pery slope. Sooner or later, it mutes 
the exchange of ideas in a free society. 
As a student of history, I know that 
freedom has often been threatened by 
those who are convinced their views 
were on the right side of history. 
I offer a bit of wisdom without mal-
ice to the New York Times: Don’t back 
down 
from 
the 
First 
Amendment. 
Swapping your free press for party-line 
propaganda and punishing dissent is 
not a good look. Ask the people of 
North Korea, China, and Iran. 
On Independence Day 2020, I encour-
age members of the media and all 
Americans to step out of your comfort 
zones and seek to understand other 
viewpoints. 
Before we can expand America’s 
promise, end racism, and beat the 
virus, we must come together as Amer-
icans. No matter one’s race, politic, 
creed, wealth, celebrity, remember, we 
are bound together by self-evident 
truths ‘‘that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator 
with certain unalienable Rights, that 
among these are Life, Liberty, and the 
pursuit of Happiness.’’ 
I want even a leftwing newspaper to 
be a responsible policeman for our po-
litical system. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. 
BROWN. 
Before 
Senator 
PORTMAN and I do our unanimous con-
sent, I just can’t believe what I heard. 
Senator GRASSLEY, going to the floor 
and talking about the media that way, 
when his majority—they owe their ma-
jority to Rush Limbaugh and FOX 
News, and they swear allegiance to a 
President of the United States who has 
lied thousands of times and then at-
tacks the media every time they dis-
agree with him or call him out, attacks 
the media as fake news, is just shock-
ing to me.

COMMEMORATING 
OTTO 
FRED-
ERICK 
WARMBIER 
AND 
CON-
DEMNING THE NORTH KOREAN 
REGIME FOR THEIR CONTINUED 
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today 
I rise to ask unanimous consent to pass 
S. Res. 623, which is a resolution com-
memorating Otto Fredrick Warmbier 
and condemning the North Korean re-
gime for their continued human rights 
abuses. 
Otto Warmbier was a native of my 
hometown of Cincinnati, OH. He was 
also a young man of great spirit, intel-
lect, and promise. 
He attended the University of Vir-
ginia, and in 2015, he flew to North 
Korea on a cultural trip. He went with 
a tour group. 
At the end of his brief visit there, he 
was unjustly arrested by North Korean 
security officials at the airport, as he 
was departing, and he was imprisoned 
for 17 months on trumped-up charges 
relating to a political poster. 
During his captivity, he was badly 
mistreated and was returned to the 
United States on June 13, 2017, only 
after falling into a comatose state. He 
never recovered. Otto died on June 19, 
2017—6 days later and 3 years ago to-
morrow. 
Senator BROWN from Ohio and I have 
introduced this resolution to remember 
what happened to him, to keep the 
memory of Otto, alive, and to hold the 
North Korean regime accountable for 
their gross mistreatment, their human 
rights abuses. Many others, in addition 
to Otto Warmbier, have been subject to 
those human rights abuses, including 
the North Korean people, whom they 
continue to repress, even starve and 
mistreat. 
Our resolution calls for the United 
States to continue to use our voice, in-
cluding at the United Nations and 
other forums, to speak out against the 
human rights abuses of the North Ko-
rean Government. 
It calls for the sanctions enacted 
under the Otto Warmbier North Korea 
Nuclear Sanctions and Enforcement 
Act of 2019 to remain fully imple-
mented. 
Most importantly, this resolution 
honors and remembers Otto Warmbier, 
lest we forget what the North Korean 
dictatorship did to him. 
His parents, Fred and Cindy, have 
channeled their grief into constructive 
efforts to expose the human rights 
abuses of the North Korean dictator-
ship, and I commend them for that. No 
parent should have to endure what 
they have gone through. 
Jane and I plan to visit with them at 
their home in Cincinnati tomorrow on 
the third anniversary of Otto’s death, 
and I hope to be able to hand them a 
copy of this resolution and to be able 
to say that the entire U.S. Senate 
voted to approve it. 
This resolution is the right thing to 
do, and I encourage my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to pass it by 
unanimous consent. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Ohio. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my friend Senator PORTMAN and 
the rest of my colleagues who have 
been steadfast in their memory and re-
membrance of Otto Warmbier, a young 
Ohioan, as Rob said, whose life was cut 
short by the North Korean regime’s 
awful human rights abuses. 
I take this moment to recognize—I 
never knew Otto, but I have gotten to 
know his parents and his family, and I 
especially thank Cindy and Fred for 
their advocacy in memory of their son 
and turning their grief into something 
so positive for the country and for the 
world. 
Last year, we worked together on 
sanctions legislation to send a clear bi-
partisan signal that the United States 
is serious about maintaining strong 
economic and diplomatic pressure on 
North Korea to give up its nuclear 
weapons and to stop its human rights 
abuses. 
Those abuses took the life of Otto 
Warmbier. We must continue to shine a

light on what the regime does to its 
own people and to others. 
I thank Senator PORTMAN
for his 
leadership on this. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, as in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Foreign Relations 
Committee be discharged from further 
consideration and that the Senate now 
proceed to S. Res. 623. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 623) commemorating 
Otto Frederick Warmbier and condemning 
the North Korean regime for their continued 
human rights abuses. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, and the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 623) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
DACA 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, today’s de-
cision from the U.S. Supreme Court in 
Department of Homeland Security v. 
Regents of the University of California 
is disgraceful. 
Judging is not a game. It is not sup-
posed to be a game. But, sadly, over re-
cent years, more and more Chief Jus-
tice Roberts has been playing games 
with the Court to achieve the policy 
outcomes he desires. 
This 
case 
concerned 
President 
Obama’s Executive amnesty—amnesty 
that President Obama decreed directly 
contrary to Federal law. He did so with 
no legal authority. He did so in open 
defiance of Federal statutes. Of course, 
he was celebrated in the press for doing 
so. 
Obama’s Executive amnesty was ille-
gal the day it was issued and not one 
single Justice of the nine Supreme 
Court Justices disputed that—not a 
one. 
Chief Justice Roberts wrote the ma-
jority opinion, joined by the four lib-
eral Justices on the Court. This is be-
coming a pattern. 
The majority assumes that DACA— 
Obama’s Executive amnesty—is illegal, 
and then bizarrely holds that the 
Trump administration can’t stop im-
plementing a policy that is illegal. 
Think about that for a second. 
In fact, it is even worse. The major-
ity explicitly concede, of course, the 
administration can stop an illegal pol-
icy. ‘‘All parties agree’’—that is a 
quote—‘‘all parties agree that DHS 
may rescind DACA.’’ 
OK. Easy. Everyone agrees. DHS can 
rescind DACA. Right? 
Not so fast. A clever little twist. The 
majority says: Do you know what? The 
agency’s legal explanation wasn’t de-
tailed enough. Yes, you have the au-
thority to do it. Everyone agrees. 
There is no argument that you don’t 
have the authority to do it, but we are 
checking your homework and, you 
know, the memo you wrote explaining 
it just didn’t have all the detail we 
need. Just a touch more, so start over. 
What is interesting is that is exactly 
the sleight of hand that Chief Justice 
Roberts did almost exactly a year ago 
today in another case where the Chief 
joined with the four liberals from the 
Court and struck down another one of 
the Trump administration’s policies. 
In that case a year ago, the Com-
merce Department, which is charged by 
the Constitution with conducting a 
census every 10 years—the Commerce 
Department wanted to ask a common-
sense question in the course of the cen-
sus: Are you a citizen of the United 
States? That is a question that has 
been asked in nearly every census since 
1820. It ain’t that complicated, asking 
someone in the course of a census: Are 
you a citizen? 
But in today’s politically fraught 
world, the Democratic Party has de-
cided they are the party of illegal im-
migration, as is the press. And so what 
did John Roberts do a year ago? Same 
thing. He wrote an opinion saying: Of 
course, the Commerce Department has 
the authority in the census to ask if 
you are a citizen. Of course. We have 
done it since 1820. 
For those who are math impaired, 
that is 200 years ago. 
Steadily since then, every 10 years, 
over and over and over again, but no, 
no, no, no—John Roberts, little twist 
of hand. 
Do you know what? The Commerce 
Department didn’t explain their rea-
soning just clearly enough. We looked 
at their memo announcing it, announc-
ing that they were making a policy de-
cision that they have unquestioned 
legal authority to do, that the Bill 
Clinton administration had asked that 
question, but John Roberts and the 
four liberals are going to strike it down 
because they say it wasn’t explained 
clearly enough. 
This is a charade. Last year, they 
pretended it was just about the agency 
could go back and do it again. They 
knew full well there wasn’t time to do 
it again; that they had to start the cen-
sus, and so they got the result they 
wanted. They didn’t like, as a policy 
matter, asking this. There was no legal 
reason, no legal authority to strike it 
down, so they played a little game: Go 
back and start over. Of course, now we 
are doing the census without asking 
that question. 
That is the same game here today in 
DACA. They don’t like the policy so 
they say: Just go back and do it over. 
Just give a little more explanation. 
Just start over. Everyone knows the 
game they are playing. They are hop-
ing that in November, in the election, 
that there is a different result in the 
election; that there is a new adminis-
tration that comes in that decides am-
nesty is a good thing, and so this 
sleight of hand is all about playing pol-
icy. 
Five Justices today held that it was 
illegal for the Trump administration to 
stop breaking the law. That is bizarre. 
The reasoning is because the Obama 
administration violated Federal immi-
gration laws, for now—wink, wink, 
let’s pretend, because that is what they 
are doing, is pretending—Trump has to 
continue violating the law and behav-
ing illegally. 
Chief Justice Roberts knows exactly 
what he is doing. We saw earlier this 
week a decision rewriting title VII of 
our civil rights laws—rewriting title 
VII, the prohibition on sex discrimina-
tion, on discrimination against women 
or against men, rewriting it to add 
‘‘sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity.’’ 
Now, as a policy matter, there are a 
lot of people who support that. Indeed, 
legislation to do that has passed the 
House of Representatives twice. It has 
passed this body once. But the Court 
just rewrote it. The Court just engaged 
in legislation, plain and simple, as Jus-
tice Alito powerfully wrote in dissent. 
By the way, Chief Justice Roberts, 
again in the majority, assigned that 
majority. This is gamesmanship. Chief 
Justice Roberts knows exactly what he 
is doing. The fact that elites in Wash-
ington don’t see a problem with illegal 
immigration doesn’t answer the reality 
for millions of working men and 
women who do, and these kinds of 
games ultimately make a mockery of 
the rule of law. They make a mockery 
of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. 
It is the same legerdemain we saw 
Chief Justice Roberts do several years 
ago 
upholding 
ObamaCare, 
where, 
again, just with a little flip of the 
wrist, he changed a penalty into a tax. 
That is not clever; that is lawless. 
This decision today was lawless; it 
was gamesmanship; and it was con-
trary to the judicial oath that each of 
the nine Justices has taken.

JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are 
in the midst of one of the greatest pub-
lic health crises in our Nation’s his-
tory. Over 2 million Americans have 
been infected by the COVID–19 virus. 
Over 
115,000 
Americans 
have 
died. 
Sadly, infections are still trending up-
ward in many States. And what is the 
response of the Republican majority in 
the U.S. Senate to this public health 
crisis? This week, the majority leader, 
Senator MCCONNELL has scheduled a 
vote on his family friend and former in-
tern, Justin Walker, to be a judge on 
the DC Circuit, the second highest 
court in the land.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3093 
June 18, 2020 
Colleagues, let’s be honest. You can-
not say with a straight face that Justin 
Walker, a 38-year-old with no practical 
courtroom 
experience 
and 
a 
few 
months’ time on the district court 
bench, is the best person for the job of 
DC Circuit judge. He is not, and we 
know it. So why is he getting this nom-
ination? I believe there are two main 
reasons: because Justin Walker is a 
prote´ge´ of Senator MCCONNELL and be-
cause he is an outspoken critic of the 
Affordable Care Act. 
Justin Walker has made clear that he 
is willing to toe the Republican party 
line of hostility to Obamacare. Before 
he was confirmed as a district judge 
last October in a party-line vote, he 
called the NFIB case that upheld the 
ACA’s constitutionality an ‘‘indefen-
sible decision.’’ And in March, while he 
was a sitting judge, he cracked jokes 
about his opposition to the ACA at his 
ceremonial investiture. 
These comments apparently put him 
on the fast-track for a promotion to 
the DC Circuit. I find it astonishing 
that 
Senate 
Republicans 
have 
rubberstamped so many nominees who 
have written articles or spoken pub-
licly about their hostility to the ACA, 
nominees 
like 
John 
Bush, 
Steven 
Grasz, James Ho, David Porter, Neomi 
Rao, Mark Norris, Michael Truncale, 
and Sarah Pitlyk, not to mention Chad 
Readler, who filed the brief for the 
Trump Justice Department in the 
Texas v. U.S. case that called for strik-
ing down the entire ACA, including its 
protections for Americans with pre-
existing conditions. Chad Readler was 
nominated to the 6th Circuit within a 
day of filing that brief. 
It is a pattern. And right after the 
vote on Justin Walker, Senator MCCON-
NELL
wants to vote on yet another 
nominee with a record of outspoken 
hostility to the ACA; 5th Circuit nomi-
nee Cory Wilson of Mississippi has re-
peatedly spoken, written, and tweeted 
criticisms of the ACA. In one of Wil-
son’s newspaper columns, he wrote ‘‘for 
the sake of the Constitution, I hope the 
Court strikes down the law.’’ In an-
other column, he described the ACA as 
‘‘big, intrusive government’’ and as 
‘‘perverse’’ and ‘‘illegitimate.’’ And he 
has tweeted negatively about the ACA 
more than 30 times. 
Justin Walker’s and Cory Wilson’s 
public statements clearly show that 
they have already made up their minds 
about the Affordable Care Act’s merits 
and its constitutionality. And yet, 
they have been unwilling to recuse 
themselves from ACA cases that might 
come before them if they are con-
firmed. This is important because the 
ACA has been under constant attack in 
the Federal courts. The Republican 
Party, from President Trump on down, 
has been obsessed with trying to get 
the ACA struck down as unconstitu-
tional. There is a case pending before 
the Supreme Court right now where 
Republican 
officeholders 
and 
the 
Trump administration are trying to 
strike down the entire ACA. That 
would strip away health insurance and 
preexisting condition protections for 
millions of Americans. Even in the 
middle of a pandemic, the Republican 
Party is not stopping its attack on the 
Affordable Care Act. 
They failed to overturn the ACA in 
Congress, of course. But clearly, Re-
publicans are determined to attack it 
through the courts, no matter how 
many Americans might lose their cov-
erage and protections. Make no mis-
take, the nominations of Justin Walker 
and Cory Wilson are part of the Repub-
lican assault on the Affordable Care 
Act. And the American people are 
watching. 
I oppose these nominees. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in opposition to the nomina-
tion of Justin Walker to the DC Cir-
cuit. There are four main reasons for 
my opposition, and I would like to ad-
dress each. 
First, Judge Walker does not have 
the experience we would expect of a 
nominee to the DC Circuit, which is 
considered the second most powerful 
court in the Nation. 
Judge Walker was confirmed to the 
Western District of Kentucky on Octo-
ber 24, 2019. He has just 7 months of ex-
perience as a sitting Federal district 
court Judge. 
Moreover, as Judge Walker disclosed 
in the questionnaire he submitted to 
the Judiciary Committee, in those 7 
months he has presided over no bench 
or jury trials. 
Although appellate judges don’t pre-
side over jury selection, sentencing, or 
decisions on the admissibility of evi-
dence, they are regularly called upon 
to examine the decisions of district 
court judges on these and other mat-
ters. 
In light of that, Judge Walker’s lack 
of trial experience should alone be a 
bar to his elevation to the circuit. 
Second, 
I 
have 
serious 
concerns 
about Judge Walker’s views on Execu-
tive power and agency independence. 
Questions around these issues fre-
quently come before the DC Circuit, 
and so Judge Walker’s views are highly 
relevant to his nomination. 
Judge Walker has argued against the 
independence of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, going so far as to claim 
that the FBI Director should be an 
‘‘agent’’ of the President. 
These views are troubling in the ab-
stract, but they are even more trou-
bling now, with an administration that 
too often views the Department of Jus-
tice as a political arm of the Presi-
dency. 
Judge Walker has also argued that 
Federal agencies have too much power 
when it comes to protecting the envi-
ronment, consumers, and the work-
place. 
This is an especially troubling view-
point at a time when we need agencies 
like 
the 
Occupational 
Safety 
and 
Health 
Administration, 
commonly 
known as OSHA, to protect the health 
and safety of American workers who 
have continued working during the 
COVID–19 pandemic or will be return-
ing to their jobs. 
Judge Walker’s views on the ability 
of federal agencies to protect Ameri-
cans are particularly relevant to the 
DC Circuit, which hears critical cases 
surrounding workplace and environ-
mental safeguards. 
Third, Judge Walker has been an ar-
dent opponent of the Affordable Care 
Act. 
He has called the Supreme Court’s 
decision upholding the ACA ‘‘indefen-
sible’’ and ‘‘catastrophic.’’ He praised 
then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh for pro-
viding a ‘‘roadmap’’ by which the Court 
could strike down the ACA. 
I simply cannot support a nominee 
who would put at risk the healthcare of 
tens of millions of Americans, includ-
ing those with preexisting conditions 
who might well lose coverage without 
the ACA’s protections. 
Finally, I have concerns that Judge 
Walker does not have the temperament 
required of a Federal judge. 
In March of this year, when he was 
formally sworn in to the Western Dis-
trict of Kentucky, Judge Walker made 
a number of overtly political remarks. 
He attacked the American Bar Asso-
ciation, stating that ‘‘although we cel-
ebrate today, we cannot take for grant-
ed tomorrow or we will lose our courts 
and our country to critics who call us 
terrifying and who describe us as de-
plorable.’’ 
He said that ‘‘in Brett Kavanaugh’s 
America, we will not surrender while 
you wage war on our work or our cause 
or our hope or our dream.’’ 
These remarks raise questions as to 
whether Judge Walker can remain im-
partial and set aside political leanings. 
For all of these reasons, I will vote 
against Judge Walker’s nomination, 
and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. Thank you. 
Mr. CRUZ. I yield the floor.

THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, over the 
weekend we celebrated Flag Day, when 
we honor our country’s flag as a sym-
bol of unity. It is also a symbol of all 
of the struggles we have gone through 
as a nation and the struggles ahead of 
us. 
Harry Truman, whose desk—one of 
his desks used on the Senate floor—is 
right here in front of me, once said 
that Flag Day is also a chance for us to 
consider what we want the flag to 
stand for. So I think it is appropriate 
that we are considering the best way to 
make sure that the flag stands for all 
we want it to stand for—and for all of 
us. 
Senator TIM SCOTT has introduced 
the JUSTICE Act, which would bring 
us closer to that idea. I was glad to be 
a cosponsor of the bill. I think this bill 
has the potential to make a real dif-
ference in how we deal with the impor-
tant and difficult issue of police reform 
and making sure that our communities 
are both safe and secure. 
You know, you can be safe in the 
sense that you are not in danger, but 
people also need to feel secure, mean-
ing they have confidence that they will 
remain safe and that they will be treat-
ed fairly while they are safe. 
We need to be sure that all of the 
people of our country believe that jus-
tice can be blind and that it can be dis-
pensed without fear or favor. 
Policing, by its very nature, is most-
ly a local function. There are around 
18,000 police departments across the 
country. Most of the reforms can be 
made at the local level or the State 
level. 
There are different ways that police 
systems are structured around the 
country. There are different levels of 
law enforcement and how they relate 
to each other, and I don’t think we are 
going to do anything effectively in the 
Congress to impact that, but I think 
there are some things we can do both 
in Congress and the administration. I 
think Senator SCOTT has done a really 
good job finding what many of those 
things are and how to make them hap-
pen with bipartisan support. 
There is a lot in this bill that simply 
increases transparency and account-
ability: more reporting so that the Jus-
tice Department has an idea of areas 
where problems seem to arise more fre-
quently and maybe shouldn’t; an area 
of reporting so that a troublesome offi-
cer has all of those troubles reported if 
they have had problems with issues of 
fairness or constitutional protection; 
and if that officer is applying at an-
other law enforcement agency, that in-
formation should be readily available. 
There are two important ways to 
give people a sense of security. We do 
that by recognizing that the majority 
of police in this country are only not a 
problem, but they do an incredibly 
hard job, and they do it in an incred-
ible way. It is a job that we have to 
have. It has to be conscientiously, pro-
fessionally, and courageously done, and 
law 
enforcement 
officers 
all 
over 
America do it. They get up and do a 
hard job every day. They run to danger 
when others run away. It is a hard job. 
Frankly, I think the hardest job in 
America might be the spouse of a law 
enforcement officer. Law enforcement 
officers generally have a sense—there 
are occasions when this isn’t the case— 
but generally have a sense of whether 
they are in imminent danger or not. 
The person who cares about them, the 
person who loves them, wonders all 
day: What, at this exact moment, is 
that individual facing, and are they 
safe? 
The problem in policing is there are 
very few officers and maybe even fewer 
numbers of police departments where 
there is a systemic problem. I think if 
there is a systemic problem in a de-
partment, it is hard for that depart-
ment to solve that problem. Some of 
Senator SCOTT’s legislation helps cre-
ate the tools they might need to get 
that done or the tools that we might 
need, as outside helpers, to say: Here is 
a department that somebody needs to 
look at. 
His legislation can assure us that for 
the small group of people in law en-
forcement who aren’t conducting them-
selves in the way that everybody else 
in law enforcement does, there is trans-
parency and there is reporting. Things 
can’t be just swept under the rug, and 
an officer can’t go from one depart-
ment to another without the new de-
partment knowing exactly what they 
are getting. 
This legislation sets up more funding 
to make sure that body cameras are 
widely available and have to be used if 
you have them. I think there has been 
plenty of evidence since 2014, when we 
had the beginning of the modern body- 
camera movement, that if you have 
those cameras on your body and you

have them turned on, the escalation of 
violence, for whatever reason, happens 
much less frequently. The police officer 
knows that camera is on, and the per-
son they are dealing with knows that 
camera is on, and it seems to make a 
difference. 
Reporting when there are deaths or 
serious injuries due to the use of 
force—and those are investigated, I be-
lieve, in every department in America, 
but there is no reason they shouldn’t 
also be reported to see if there is a pat-
tern that involves either an individual 
or a pattern that involves a depart-
ment that needs to be looked at. 
Sharing records, as I said before, is 
critically important so that one bad of-
ficer doesn’t get passed from one de-
partment to another. 
There are things in the realm of 
training where this legislation helps of-
ficers get training on tactics to deesca-
late a situation when it gets out of 
control. Officers want this kind of 
training. Officers want the kind of 
training that makes it easier for them 
to understand that if they are in a situ-
ation where mental health is the prob-
lem or opioid addiction is the problem 
or drug addiction is the problem, are 
they dealing with a real criminal here 
or are they dealing with somebody who 
has gotten themselves in a situation in 
which they need to figure out how to 
get them in a different and better 
place. 
While we need to move quickly to 
take up this legislation, I think there 
are some areas where the administra-
tion can act and is acting, based on an-
nouncements that were made this week 
and things that weren’t announced this 
week. 
I talked to Attorney General Barr a 
couple of weeks ago as these incidents 
began to become more clear in the 
sense of problems that could be within 
entire police departments and encour-
aged him to restore more of the pat-
tern and practice reviews that were 
part of what the Justice Department 
used for about a decade. They were in 
place until November of 2018. I think 
they need to be back in place. 
We know from past usage that they 
don’t have to be used on any situation 
or every situation, but they can be 
used. We have seen them used in my 
State in Ferguson, MO, in surrounding 
St. Louis County, which had a much 
bigger department and asked for a vol-
untary review, and the city of St. 
Louis, which has a big police depart-
ment but not as big as St. Louis Coun-
ty in 2014 and 2017. Whether that review 
was voluntary or even if it involved a 
consent decree, I think that the case 
can be made that things happened in 
those three departments that might 
not have happened otherwise. 
The Attorney General and I both 
agreed that if you don’t have a tool in 
the toolbox, you can’t use it. It is im-
portant to see what you need to do to 
put every tool in the toolbox, even if it 
is a tool that you have previously 
taken out and said: Well, maybe we 
don’t need that any longer. If you don’t 
need it, you don’t have to use it. But 
you are certainly not going to be able 
to use it if you don’t have it. 
President Trump took some addi-
tional steps that I was supportive of 
and talked about earlier this week 
when the Presiding Officer and I were 
at our leadership stakeout: officers 
with better tools to deal with mental 
health, homelessness, addiction issues. 
Missouri is one of the eight Excel-
lence in Mental Health States. This is 
legislation—bipartisan 
legislation— 
that I have worked on for several years 
with Senator STABENOW from Michi-
gan. It allows law enforcement to con-
nect people with the help they need 
and wind up having them someplace 
more appropriate than either jail or 
court. 
In fact, the Department of Health 
and Human Services, in monitoring 
this program, says that it has led to a 
60-percent decrease in jail time. Part of 
that is, a lot of people don’t wind up 
going to jail because it makes it more 
possible for people in many of the de-
partments in my State and in others to 
have a constant contact with that 
mental health professional. Maybe it is 
on the iPad that they are carrying with 
them, where they can get that 24/7 con-
nection with a healthcare professional. 
It certainly benefits from the training 
that many Missouri officers have had 
now in crisis intervention. 
In Kansas City, in St. Louis County, 
in St. Louis city, in Springfield, I have 
ridden with officers and talked to offi-
cers and watched how this happens, 
and that builds confidence. Senator 
SCOTT’s bill builds the same kind of 
confidence. 
I have heard some of our friends on 
the other side say: Well, I am for 80 
percent of what is in that bill. No, they 
don’t even say that. They say: I am for 
80 percent of the bill. Now, what is the 
difference? Being for 80 percent of the 
bill means that there are things in it 
you don’t want, but they also say more 
frequently: No, that bill has 80 percent 
of what I want in it already. 
Well, let me remind our friends how 
you make a law. Under the Constitu-
tion, the House passes a bill, and 
maybe you like that better. The Senate 
passes a bill, and maybe the Senate has 
80 percent of what you would like to 
see in the final bill in Senate bill, and 
then you go to conference. It was 
taught in every civic school book that 
every Member of the Senate studied, 
and we don’t do it much anymore. 
You can’t get to conference unless 
there is a Senate product. No matter 
how much you love the House bill if 
you are a Member of the Senate, you 
don’t get to weigh in on the House bill 
unless you have a Senate bill that al-
lows you to go to that conference. 
This would be the perfect time when 
Members of the Senate say—and you 
and I should be listening carefully over 
the next few days when they say ‘‘80 
percent of what I want is in that bill or 
85 percent of what I want is in that 
bill,’’ particularly, if they—usually, 
they are not saying ‘‘There is nothing 
in the bill I don’t want; it just doesn’t 
have everything I do want.’’ Well, if 80 
percent of what you want is in the bill 
and the House passes another bill that 
you like better, maybe you come out of 
that conference with 90 percent of what 
you want. If a solution that gets you 90 
percent of what you want or 80 percent 
of what you want is the alternative to 
zero percent of what you want, if you 
want to be a legislator, you have to fig-
ure out that that is a better path for 
you to take than the zero-percent path. 
It would be tragic next week if the 
result of the House deliberation and, 
this month, if the result of the Senate 
deliberation is that there is no further 
discussion because everybody has de-
cided that if it wasn’t everything they 
wanted, they didn’t want to have the 
process that we used to call—and the 
Constitution calls and civic books 
call—the legislative process. 
These are not the first struggles we 
have faced together as a nation. We 
have come a long way. We still have a 
long way to go. 
Remember, the Constitution doesn’t 
even promise a perfect Union. It prom-
ises a more perfect Union. You get to a 
more perfect Union one step at a time, 
not all at once. My guess is, we will al-
ways be on the journey toward a more 
perfect Union. 
Senator SCOTT has given us an oppor-
tunity to take some of the important 
steps on that journey and make the 
Union more perfect than it is right 
now. 
I yield the floor.

AMERICAN ENERGY INNOVATION 
ACT 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on 
Tuesday, just a few days ago, I con-
vened a hearing of the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee, and we 
were focused on the impacts of COVID– 
19 and how this pandemic has impacted 
our Nation’s energy industry. We had a 
lot of discussions about the impact of 
COVID on the Nation, on our economy, 
and I think it is probably fair to say 
that every facet of our society has been 
impacted, but it is certainly clear to 
me as a Senator for the State of Alaska 
and as chairman of the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee that the 
energy sector has suffered perhaps 
uniquely and I think acutely.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3096 
June 18, 2020 
We have seen limits on business and 
travel and social activities, and we 
think about those limitations, the far- 
reaching consequences they have on 
our Nation’s energy producers, whether 
it is those who produce oil and gas, 
coal, renewables, advanced technology 
such as nuclear power, and all those 
who help us produce our energy and use 
our energy more efficiently, all aspects 
have been impacted. 
At the hearing, we had some pretty 
good testimony that our witnesses 
were able to explain and quantify some 
of those impacts. We heard that U.S. 
oil production has declined by almost 2 
million barrels per day. Spot prices for 
liquefied natural gas have effectively 
collapsed, creating challenges for ex-
port projects. Domestic electricity con-
sumption is projected to decline by 5.7 
percent this year, largely due to the 
closure of businesses and, of course, the 
shelter-in-place orders. 
It is not just the oil and gas sector. 
The renewable energy sector has also 
faced substantial supply chain disrup-
tions. The efficiency sector has faced 
health and safety restrictions in homes 
and buildings. Overall, we were told 
that the energy industry has lost an es-
timated 1.3 million jobs since early 
March, including more than 600,000 jobs 
associated with clean energy. 
It is a good reminder in terms of 
where we have seen this direct impact 
and the impact on jobs, but our hearing 
was also a reminder that the energy in-
dustry can be a key leader, be a sector 
that can really help lead our Nation’s 
economic recovery. 
When you think about energy itself, 
this is a finished product. It is a feed-
stock. It is a raw material. It is an 
input. It is an output. It is value added, 
a natural resource, tradeable com-
modity, a precious asset. It is clearly 
critical infrastructure and emergency 
reserves. It is financial, collateral, and 
competitive exports. It is a source of 
high-paying and high-skilled jobs in its 
own right. 
I think we recognize that current low 
prices are good for us. We are seeing 
our families pay less and, thus, they 
can devote to other priorities. The un-
derlying message here is the energy in-
dustry is an important component to 
how we move to this phase of economic 
recovery. What can we do to help this 
industry and, thus, the broader econ-
omy recovery? 
It was interesting because we had a 
panel of five witnesses before us. Sev-
eral of those witnesses all pointed to 
the same piece of legislation as one of 
the answers as to how we can help the 
economy recover, and that is a bill 
that those of us on the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee developed 
throughout last year. We called it the 
American Energy Innovation Act. We 
refer to it as our energy bill. It will en-
sure that the United States remains a 
global energy leader while strength-
ening our national security, investing 
in clean technologies, and securing our 
Nation’s supply chain. 
It is a pretty wide-ranging bill. It 
covers everything from energy effi-
ciency to renewables. We have a strong 
focus on carbon capture. The big an-
chor piece is energy storage. Advanced 
nuclear plays a key role and also vehi-
cle technologies. We focused on min-
eral security and recognizing the key 
aspects of secure supply chains, grid 
and cyber security, workforce mod-
ernization. Really, it is all areas that 
will work to help our economy, boost 
our international competitiveness, and 
protect human health and the global 
environment. 
At the hearing on Tuesday, one of 
our witnesses described this energy 
bill, our American Energy Innovation 
Act, as ‘‘foundational.’’ I really think 
it is foundational. 
Where are we with this foundational 
energy bill that has been the work of 
such a good, strong collaborative com-
mittee process? It was clearly timely 
for the Senate to be considering this in 
this year—certainly before the pan-
demic—and it is even more critical, 
more timely that we consider it now. 
When we had an opportunity to bring 
this to the floor earlier, there was a de-
sire and an interest in making sure 
that we were focusing on our clean and 
renewable energy sector. We do that 
within that bill. 
It has been interesting because in the 
past several weeks, we have heard calls 
from Members of this body to prioritize 
a robust clean energy recovery plan. 
There was a letter from 24 Members of 
the Senate who urged Senate leader-
ship to ‘‘prioritize a robust clean en-
ergy recovery plan.’’ In their letter, 
they call for investments in renewable 
energy, energy storage, energy effi-
ciency, clean vehicles, clean and effi-
cient infrastructure, clean fuels, and 
workforce development. That sounds 
pretty much like what we included 
within our American Energy Innova-
tion Act. 
I sent many of them just a quick let-
ter detailing how our bill really does 
accomplish just that, including the 
specifics that focus on each of these 
priorities, and encourage them to help 
me pass it. 
As you may recall, we had the Amer-
ican Energy Innovation Act on the 
Senate floor at the end of February 
just before the pandemic took hold. 
Again, I mentioned the collaborative 
process that went into building that 
bill. We spent a lot of time in the En-
ergy Committee working through a lot 
of the issues that had some conflict 
and to reduce that conflict so we could 
get a good, strong bipartisan product. 
As a consequence, we have a bill that 
contains the priorities for more than 70 
Senators. It is supported by more than 
200 organizations. We incorporated 18 
amendments on the floor working 
through that process. 
The Senate ultimately denied cloture 
on March 9. This was just before the 
shelter in place and the work from 
home orders began. We hit a wall there. 
The unfortunate reality is we hit that 
wall. We were derailed with this impor-
tant legislative effort not because of an 
impasse that we had with the contents 
of our bill, but it was an unrelated dis-
pute from another committee. It was 
not something that, as chairman, I 
could have anticipated. There was no 
warning that it was going to be an 
issue for our bill. In fairness, we didn’t 
have any power as the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee to work it 
out for this other committee. We were 
hamstrung by it. 
Effectively, what happened then was 
a year of good, strong committee work 
by the Energy Committee is now being 
held hostage in a fight in another com-
mittee. I have been patient with this, 
but I would remind colleagues that we 
are not getting any more extra legisla-
tive days being added. The clock is 
ticking here. This is a matter that, 
again, when this came before us while 
we were on this floor trying to work 
out the last of the amendments, this 
came up at the last minute, and we 
were promised a resolution at that 
time. We will have this fixed in a 
month. Well, it has been over 3 months 
now since this became an issue. Again, 
we have lost valuable time. 
This issue from the EPW Committee 
is holding back a strong, bipartisan bill 
that would allow us to modernize our 
Nation’s energy policies for the first 
time in more than a dozen years. 
In a week where I have certainly 
been reminded about the importance of 
energy and, again, heard good, strong 
support for our energy bill, I would tell 
my colleagues that we need to redouble 
our efforts on this to advance this bill. 
We need to unlock this energy bill, 
which is a good bill that is ready to go, 
from the complications that have been 
created within another committee. 
I like to pride myself on being a pret-
ty good team player around here. I 
want to give people space to work their 
issues out, but I think it is time, again, 
for those who are able to hold the key 
to this to help us unlock this so we can 
move a significant priority—not just 
for the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee but a significant priority 
for every Member in this Chamber be-
cause it doesn’t make any difference if 
you are a Republican or a Democrat, if 
you come from an urban area or a rural 
area, when it comes to the strength of 
our 
Nation’s 
economy, 
the 
foundational interest here, the founda-
tions rest solidly on energy. 
So an opportunity to update and 
modernize our energy policies in a way 
that benefits us all is something that I 
would hope we can all agree to. I want 
to get this bill moving. 
We had a win this week that origi-
nated in the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee when it comes to 
some of our land and conservation 
measures. The Great American Out-
doors Act passed by a strong margin. It 
was the work of a lot of good people, 
but both measures, the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, as well as the Re-
store Our Parks Act, began with the

good work of a committee working to-
gether to move those pieces of legisla-
tion through the committee process. It 
is not perfect, in my view, but I knew 
these were good policies that many 
Members across both sides of the aisle 
wanted to place a priority on. 
Let’s figure out how we can make 
something like that happen. I am 
proud of the fact that we can move 
good initiatives through this com-
mittee. 
I will just remind you we have an-
other good initiative that we are ready 
to go on. 
f 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mrs. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
want to end my few moments on the 
floor with an acknowledgement of 
where we are going to be next week. It 
has been made clear that we are going 
to have an opportunity to bring up for 
discussion legislation that has been 
drafted by Senator TIM
SCOTT
from 
South Carolina, along with a group of 
fellow colleagues over here, focused on 
matters relating to policing reforms. 
My hope—it is more than a hope; it is 
really a prayer. My prayer is that we 
will come to this floor next week as 
colleagues and as individuals who want 
to bring to bear good policy for a coun-
try at a time that is so desperate for 
leadership that is responsive, leader-
ship that has demonstrated a willing-
ness to listen to the raw emotion of 
what we have seen expressed across 
this country in the few weeks since the 
terrible death and killing of George 
Floyd but recognizing that it is far 
more than the horrible death of one in-
dividual. It is a history that in many 
parts of our country is raw and open 
and needs to be addressed. 
My prayer is that we can come to 
this floor not here to debate through a 
partisan lens but here to debate those 
issues that are so important and so im-
perative for the American public to 
hear; that the response is not a Repub-
lican effort versus a Democratic effort, 
but that these are matters that we 
must address, whether it is how we en-
sure that there is full and fair account-
ability, whether it relates to safe polic-
ing practices, whether it is how we ad-
dress the concerns with modern polic-
ing when there are issues before our 
law enforcement officers that span the 
scope of how we address mental health 
issues—those with addictions—and how 
we respond from a broader view and 
lens but do so with our hearts rather 
than trying to project through our po-
litical alignment. 
I even hesitate to say because some 
would ask: Well, exactly what do you 
mean by that? 
I guess what I am asking for us to do 
is to come here and debate honestly 
about where we are as a nation, and 
that comes to ensuring that when we 
speak of justice, that we speak of jus-
tice for all in a way that is inclusive, 
that is fair, that is equal, and that is 
compassionate; that we recognize that 
the men and women who get up every 
morning or stay out late every evening 
to protect and defend, that we are 
there with them and for them as they 
serve us. 
I am asking for us to come into our 
work next week with open hearts and 
open minds, having listened well. If we 
do that, I can only suspect that the 
outcome will be good. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

f 
NOMINATION OBJECTION 
WITHDRAWAL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I pre-
viously notified the Chamber of my ob-
jection to the nominations of Marshall 
Billingslea, of Virginia, to be Under 
Secretary of State for Arms Control 
and International Security and Chris-
topher C. Miller, of Virginia, to be Di-
rector of the National Counterter-
rorism Center, Office of the Director of 
National Intelligence. On June 12, 2020, 
I received two letters: one from the De-
partment of State, which contained a 
copy of recent correspondence between 
the administration to the Council of 
the Inspectors General on Integrity 
and Efficiency, CIGIE, requesting that 
CIGIE investigate specific allegations 
into the conduct of the State Depart-
ment Inspector General, State IG, 
Steve Linick, and another separate let-
ter from the White House Counsel con-
cerning the removal of Intelligence 
Community Inspector General, IC IG, 
Michael Atkinson. Without making 
comment regarding the veracity of the 
allegations made against Mr. Linick, I 
believe that these letters fulfill the 
President’s 
requirement 
to 
provide 
Congress reasons for the removal of the 
IC IG and the State IG, as required by 
the Inspector General Reform Act. It is 
for this reason that I withdraw my ob-
jection to both Mr. Billingslea and Mr. 
Miller. 
The letter from the White House 
Counsel regarding the removal of the 
IC IG repeats a previous letter from the 
White House which stated that the 
President had lost confidence in the IC 
IG. However, the White House Counsel 
enclosed with that letter a transcript 
of President Trump providing his rea-
sons for removing Mr. Atkinson to the 
press and has informed me that those 
reasons represent the President’s offi-
cial explanation of Mr. Atkinson’s re-
moval to Congress. I believe that this 
transcript and its transmittal to Con-
gress has fulfilled the statutory notice 
requirement of the Inspector General 
Reform Act. It is for this reason that I 
withdraw my objection to Mr. Miller. 
Here follow my comments to the 
President, including my actions and ra-
tionale: 
although 
the 
Constitution 
gives the President the authority to 
manage executive branch personnel, 
Congress has made it clear by law that 
should the President fire an inspector 
general, there ought to be a good rea-
son for it. No such reason was provided 
when the President informed Congress 
of the removal of Mr. Atkinson on 
April 3, 2020. Thus, in a bipartisan let-
ter on April 8, 2020, my colleagues and 
I reminded the President of his require-
ment under the statute to provide rea-
sons for removing an IG. On May 15, 
2020, the President notified Congress of 
his intent to remove Mr. Linick. This 
notification also lacked reasons for the 
removal spurring my solo letter on 
May 18, 2020, again reminding the 
President of his requirement to provide 
reasons. 
After a delay, and a personal call 
with the White House Counsel, I was 
promised a response to my letters that 
would fulfill the statutory notice re-
quirement. On May 26, 2020, I received 
a response from the White House Coun-
sel explaining the President’s Constitu-
tional removal authority, which I 
never questioned. However, the letter 
still contained no reason for the re-
movals as required by law. This failure 
to comply with the statute prompted 
my objection to both Mr. Miller and 
Mr. Billingslea on June 4, 2020. 
On June 6, 2020, I asked the White 
House to provide written reasons for 
the removals. We discussed several 
issues. I took this opportunity to talk 
to the White House and I told them 
that I needed reasons for the firing of 
IGs to be submitted in writing. 
On June 12, 2020, I received the en-
closed letter from the State Depart-
ment which finally fulfills the execu-
tive branch’s legal requirement to pro-
vide Congress reasons for an IG’s re-
moval with regard to Mr. Linick. 
Here is my view on the firing of Mr. 
Linick. The State Department’s cor-
respondence with CIGIE provided four 
reasons for Mr. Linick’s removal, all 
involving the investigation of the leak 
of information to a news reporter per-
taining to an IG report, which the re-
porter claims to be based on informa-
tion garnered from ‘‘two government 
sources involved in carrying out the in-
vestigation. The letter to CIGIE re-
quests that they begin an investigation 
into 
Mr. 
Linick’s 
alleged 
trans-
gressions, including his: 1) ‘‘failure to 
formally refer to CIGIE . . . the inves-
tigation of [the] leak’’; 2) ‘‘hand selec-
tion’’ of the Department of Defense 
OIG to conduct the leak investigation; 
3) ‘‘non-compliance with State Depart-
ment Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
email policies’’; and 4) refusal to sup-
ply Department of State leadership 
with a copy or summary of the leak in-
vestigation report despite ‘‘repeated re-
quests’’ from State Department leader-
ship. These claims are as of yet 
unverified but the President has of-
fered an additional briefing on the 
matter from State Department offi-
cials. I am in the process of scheduling

such a briefing and reviewing the addi-
tional relevant information. 
After reviewing the provided ration-
ale, I have several concerns. Chief 
among them is that CIGIE does not 
traditionally 
conduct 
investigations 
into agency or OIG leaks. It reviews al-
legations against individuals but not 
IG offices and generally lacks the funds 
and resources to conduct work outside 
of their narrow scope. As a matter of 
course however, IGs do traditionally 
check each other’s work, and CIGIE 
often suggests that allegations against 
IGs or their offices be referred to peer 
IGs. This is done when crucial IG inde-
pendence must be maintained but the 
appearance of conflicts of interest may 
arise. 
It 
would 
also 
not 
be 
uncharacteristic for an IG to safeguard 
the office’s statutorily required inde-
pendence by potentially refusing to 
provide internal information to its par-
ent agency. In short, although it would 
make little sense for CIGIE to conduct 
the leak investigation in the manner 
desired by the State Department, it 
would not be outside the bounds of 
precedent for one office of inspector 
general to conduct an investigation 
into another. 
Although I have not yet had the op-
portunity to verify the allegations re-
garding Mr. Linick, as I noted earlier, 
the President retains the constitu-
tional authority to manage executive 
branch personnel. My objection to 
these nominees was designed to prompt 
compliance with the IG Reform Act, 
which the President has now done with 
regards to Mr. Linick. Therefore, I am 
withdrawing 
my 
objection 
to 
Mr. 
Billingslea. 
On June 12, 2020, I received the en-
closed letter from the White House 
Counsel which finally fulfills the exec-
utive branch’s legal requirement to 
provide Congress reasons for an IG’s re-
moval with regard to Mr. Atkinson. 
As it pertains to Mr. Atkinson: Even 
though the President satisfied the re-
quirements of the law, I do not agree 
that the provided reasons merited Mr. 
Atkinson’s removal. In the provided 
transcript the President states, ‘‘I 
thought [ Atkinson] did a terrible job. 
Absolutely terrible . . . But ask him, 
‘Why didn’t you go and see the [tran-
script of my phone call with the 
Ukrainian president]?’ There was no 
rush. [Atkinson] said, ‘Oh we’d have to 
rush it.’ ’’ I infer from this statement 
that the reason(s) that the President 
removed Mr. Atkinson was because of 
the speed with which he sought to 
bring the whistleblower information to 
Congress and/or his role generally in 
the impeachment process. 
With respect to this objection con-
cerning Mr. Atkinson’s supposed haste, 
it is necessary to review the IC IG’s re-
sponsibility under the Intelligence Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. 
The act provides the IC IG only 14 days 
to determine if an ‘‘urgent concern’’ 
‘‘appears credible’’ and transmit that 
information to the Office of the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence, ODNI. No-
tably, the law also does not require 
that a full investigation of a whistle 
blower’s allegations be completed be-
fore the information is provided to 
Congress. Reading such a requirement 
into the law could result in critical and 
relevant information not reaching the 
ODNI or Congress in a timely manner, 
and could pose a chilling effect on 
whistleblowers’ willingness to report 
urgent concerns and other issues of 
waste, fraud, and abuse in the intel-
ligence community. That being said, I 
understand and appreciate the Presi-
dent’s irritation with this IG’s action 
being a factor in the House of Rep-
resentative’s impeachment. 
In those remarks, the President also 
said that ‘‘they give this whistleblower 
a status that he doesn’t deserve . . . . 
And, frankly, somebody ought to sue 
[him].’’ To the extent that the Presi-
dent is referring to Mr. Atkinson’s de-
termination that the whistleblower al-
legation at issue amounted to an ur-
gent concern under the law, there re-
mains a significant difference of legal 
opinion on this matter. The President’s 
position is supported by the Depart-
ment of Justice Office of Legal Coun-
sel, and Presidents routinely follow the 
legal determinations of that office. 
However, whether or not the whistle-
blower’s allegation meets the legal def-
inition of an ‘‘urgent concern’’ under 
the law, I obviously do not agree that 
person should be sued or otherwise re-
taliated against. 
My objection to these nominees was 
designed to prompt compliance with 
the IG Reform Act, which the Presi-
dent has now done with regards to Mr. 
Atkinson. Therefore, I am withdrawing 
my objection to Mr. Miller. 
Although some may want to believe 
that this is a new issue unique to this 
administration, it certainly is not. In 
July of 2009, then President Obama re-
moved the Corporation for National 
and 
Community 
Service—CNCS—In-
spector General, Gerald Walpin, from 
his post in a very similar manner and 
also did not provide reasons for re-
moval. This began a bout of negotia-
tions that resulted in not only the hold 
of several Presidential nominees but 
also a bicameral congressional inves-
tigation into the matter. In that case, 
I similarly pushed for compliance with 
the statute, held up a nominee to ob-
tain information, and disagreed with 
the stated reasons for Mr. Walpin’s re-
moval. In the end, Mr. Walpin was 
never reinstated. 
Given the misinterpretation of the 
statute by successive administrations 
from both political parties, it is appar-
ent that Congress must clarify the 
statute to ensure inspectors general 
are able to continue operating without 
undue interference. So I am intro-
ducing a bipartisan bill today to ac-
complish just that. 
(At the request of Mr. DURBIN, the 
following statement was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD.) 
∑ Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, today I 
will not be present to vote on the con-
firmation of Justin Walker, vote 123, to 
be a judge on the District of Columbia 
Court of Appeals. Were I present, I 
would vote nay.∑ 
f 
JUNETEENTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, tomor-
row, we will commemorate the 155th 
Juneteenth, the celebration of the end 
of chattel slavery in the United States. 
On June 19, 1865, Major General Gordon 
Granger and Union soldiers delivered 
the news of liberation to one of the last 
remaining confederate outposts in Gal-
veston, TX. The Civil War had ended, 
and the last remaining enslaved Black 
Americans were free. General Gordon’s 
decree would arrive over 2 years after 
President Abraham Lincoln issued the 
Emancipation Proclamation. 
For millions of Black Americans, 
Juneteenth traditionally has been a 
celebration of this freedom; it is also a 
day of reflection and education on a 
history that we all must confront. 
There is much to inform us about our 
present times that we can learn from 
the story of Juneteenth. It is the story 
of America, the story of my home 
State of Maryland. Each year, I aim to 
share these lessons and resources with 
my constituents through my office and 
in recognizing the continued work we 
must do to elevate Black history and 
create a more tolerant society. This 
year, my office will close to commemo-
rate the holiday and allow staff the 
time to reflect on its important histor-
ical lessons. 
Juneteenth is a reminder that, even 
after the signing of Abraham Lincoln’s 
seminal declaration, that even in a Na-
tion whose founding documents should 
have enshrined liberty and justice for 
all of its inhabitants, freedom was a 
dream deferred for Black Americans. It 
is a reminder that liberation was hard 
fought by those who were denied it, in-
cluding abolition leaders like Mary-
landers Frederick Douglass and Harriet 
Tubman, who then passed the torch to 
civil rights leaders and social move-
ments past and present who are still 
fighting to realize equal justice under 
law. Equal justice under law is a prom-
ise the Declaration of Independence, 
the U.S. Constitution, and the Emanci-
pation Proclamation all made, but it 
remains elusive, so the struggle con-
tinues. 
In this way, Juneteenth is a quin-
tessential American holiday. The insti-
tution of chattel slavery is interwoven 
throughout 
American 
history 
and 
would become the architecture for un-
just systems that still stand today. The 
Juneteenth liberation would precede 
over a century of continued oppression, 
oppression through stigmatization, pol-
icymaking, voter disenfranchisement, 
and Jim Crow segregation laws, which 
continued to widen the gaps of social, 
economic, and political achievement 
for Black Americans in our society. Ac-
knowledging its sinister legacy and the 
efforts to chip away at it are critical to 
understanding how to dismantle it 
from its core.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3099 
June 18, 2020 
Through the lens of recent trage-
dies—the police killings of Breonna 
Taylor, George Floyd and, just this 
week, 
Rayshard 
Brooks—and 
the 
worldwide anti-racism protests they 
have sparked, this education is more 
important than ever. We are being 
called to connect the dots in our his-
tory and take action to bring about 
meaningful change, to save lives, and 
to right the wrongs of the past. We are 
being called, yet again, to answer in 
what 
ways 
are 
our 
constitutional 
promises still left unfulfilled for Black 
Americans? 
Answering this question is essential 
to addressing police and criminal jus-
tice reform. From the establishment of 
deputized slave patrols in the Amer-
ican South, to the enforcement of seg-
regation laws through the 1960s, to 
mass 
incarceration 
and 
dispropor-
tionate police violence in our present 
day, Black Americans have often faced 
systemic racism that the law either re-
quired or permitted. The same 13th 
Amendment that abolished slavery did 
so in all forms except incarceration, 
shrouding the institution in a new 
light and enabling the continued sup-
pression of freedom and rights. 
Today, Black Americans are still 
twice as likely to be killed by police as 
White Americans. And despite rep-
resenting only 12 percent of the U.S. 
adult 
population, 
Black 
Americans 
make up 33 percent of the sentenced 
prison population. We have seen the 
brutal videos. We see the painful list of 
names of men and women killed at the 
hands of police brutality. We see the ef-
fects of this cyclical system on the 
health of our communities and families 
every day. We must act to stop it. 
The roots of systemic racism in law 
enforcement were planted centuries 
ago and can be unraveled with targeted 
and conscious action. This is why I 
have been proud to work with my col-
leagues Senators BOOKER and HARRIS 
on crafting police reform legislation 
that works toward justice and systemic 
change, the Justice in Policing Act. 
This broader legislation includes two 
bills I have introduced for several 
years, the End Racial and Religious 
Profiling Act and the Law Enforcement 
Trust and Integrity Act. The Justice in 
Policing Act would prohibit racial 
profiling, improve officer training, and 
hold officers accountable for the mis-
conduct that keeps alive the culture 
has reinforced centuries of oppression. 
I hope the Senate can pass this bill. 
Equal treatment of individuals under 
the law must not be a partisan issue. 
All Americans must recognize and 
celebrate Juneteenth so that we may 
face these harsh realities about our 
past and present and understand that 
the fight for freedom is ongoing. We 
cannot ignore our past, for it is with us 
here in the present in many forms. The 
wounds of our Nation will not heal 
until we identify and name their source 
and commit to doing the work in Con-
gress and in our communities to mend 
them. Freedom has never been free, nor 
has it ever come easily. Let us cele-
brate liberation by doing everything 
we can to fight for it for generations to 
come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CHIEF MASTER 
SERGEANT DEL G. ATKINSON 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the career of U.S. 
Air National Guard CMSgt. Del G. At-
kinson, who is retiring after almost 40 
years of faithful service to our country. 
Chief Atkinson entered Federal Ac-
tive-Duty service in the U.S. Army in 
August 1982. He was stationed in 
Nuremburg, West Germany, with the 
595th Military Police Company, First 
Armored Division ‘‘Old Ironsides’’ and 
the 101st Airborne Division ‘‘Screaming 
Eagles’’ with the 101st Military Police 
Company Fort Campbell, KY. 
Upon completion of his Army service, 
he entered into the Air National 
Guard. During his lengthy career in the 
Guard, Chief Atkinson served a number 
of combat deployments, including Op-
erations Southern Watch, Enduring 
Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Coronet 
Oak. 
Chief Atkinson used his experience in 
the Army to launch a career in law en-
forcement, working as a member of the 
University of Arkansas Police Depart-
ment and the Springdale, AR, Police 
Department. 
Over the course of almost 36 years, 
his military service took him around 
the globe, and yet, whether it was in 
Arkansas, our Nation’s Capital, or 
overseas, he and I always seemed to be 
crossing paths. 
A number of those occasions were 
more 
than 
just 
fortunate 
cir-
cumstances, as for a time, he was part 
of a team responsible for providing pro-
tection for aircraft transitioning be-
tween overseas airfields with inad-
equate security. 
He often found himself assigned to 
Senate, 
congressional, 
and 
White 
House missions. I was privileged to 
have been onboard for some of those 
flights. My colleagues and I relied on 
Del and his teammates, for our protec-
tion as we traveled to some dangerous 
parts of the world. 
On those trips, I remember looking 
back on his time in local law enforce-
ment and thinking to myself how spe-
cial it was that northwest Arkansas 
had extra representation onboard. Del 
and his colleagues took great care of 
us, each and every time, and for that, I 
will always be appreciative. 
Chief Atkinson was promoted eight 
times during the course of his military 
career. He earned a number of pres-
tigious awards and medals including a 
Meritorious Service Medal with three 
oakleaf clusters and the Joint Service 
Commendation Medal. 
His pride in our Nation and his fellow 
servicemembers is apparent, including 
with his service as a member of the 
Liberty Jump Team, where he per-
formed 
commemorative 
parachute 
jumps honoring veterans of wars and 
foreign conflicts. He joined the team 
because he ‘‘wanted to give back to the 
Greatest Generation’’ and honor how 
they ‘‘overcame all obstacles and per-
severed to win the victory on all 
fronts.’’ 
I remain grateful for Del’s combat 
service to the Nation, dedication to 
keeping the UA campus and the com-
munity of Springdale safe during his 
law enforcement days, and commit-
ment to keep alive the memory of 
those who sacrificed for our Nation. I 
wish him years of joy and happiness in 
retirement.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petition or memorial 
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as 
indicated: 
POM–204. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Senate of the State of Louisiana urg-
ing the United States Congress to take such 
actions as are necessary to review the Gov-
ernment Pension Offset and the Windfall 
Elimination Provision Social Security ben-
efit reductions and to consider eliminating 
or reducing them by supporting H.R. 141 and 
S. 521 of the 116th Congress, the Social Secu-
rity Fairness Act; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 34 
Whereas, the Congress of the United States 
of America has enacted both the Government 
Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal 
and survivor Social Security benefit, and the 
Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), re-
ducing the earned Social Security benefit, 
payable to any person who also receives a 
public pension benefit earned in public em-
ployment not covered by Social Security; 
and 
Whereas, the GPO can negatively affect a 
retired public employee receiving a federal, 
state, or local government retirement or 
pension benefit earned in employment not 
covered by Social Security who would also 
be entitled to a Social Security benefit 
earned by the retiree’s spouse; and 
Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the 
spousal or survivor Social Security benefit 
by two-thirds of the amount of the federal, 
state, or local government retirement or 
pension benefit received by the retired public 
employee, in many cases completely elimi-
nating the Social Security benefit even 
though the retiree’s spouse paid Social Secu-
rity taxes throughout the marriage; and 
Whereas, according to the Congressional 
Research Service, nearly seven hundred 
thousand people were affected by the GPO in 
December 2018, including more than thirty- 
seven thousand Louisianians; and 
Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons 
who have earned federal, state, or local gov-
ernment retirement or pension benefits in 
public employment not covered by Social Se-
curity, in addition to paying social security 
taxes while working in employment covered 
by Social Security; and 
Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned So-
cial Security benefit using an averaged in-
dexed monthly earnings formula and may re-
duce Social Security benefits for affected 
persons by as much as one-half of the retire-
ment benefit earned as a public servant in 
employment not covered by Social Security; 
and 
Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking in-
dividuals to lose a significant portion of the 
Social Security benefits that they earned 
themselves; and 
Whereas, according to the Congressional 
Research Service, nearly two million people, 
or about three percent of all Social Security 
beneficiaries were affected by the WEP in 
December 2019; and 
Whereas, in certain circumstances both the 
WEP and the GPO can be applied to a quali-
fying survivor’s benefit, each independently 
reducing the available benefit and, in com-
bination, eliminating a large portion of the 
total Social Security benefit available to the 
survivor; and 
Whereas, because of the calculation char-
acteristics of the WEP and the GPO, they 
have a disproportionately negative effect on 
employees working in lower-wage govern-
ment jobs, like teachers, school workers, and 
state employees; and 
Whereas, the number of people affected by 
the WEP and the GPO is growing as nearly 
ten thousand baby boomers attain retire-
ment age each day; and 
Whereas, individuals drastically affected 
by the WEP and the GPO may have no choice 
but to return to work after retirement in 
order to make ends meet, but the earnings 
accumulated during reemployment in the 
public sector may further reduce the Social 
Security benefits the individual is entitled 
to; and 
Whereas, the global pandemic, the current 
financial market volatility, medical ad-
vances increasing longevity, and the esca-
lating cost of health care further contribute 
to the expenses that those of social security 
age must bear; and 
Whereas, the WEP and the GPO are estab-
lished in federal law, and repeal or reduction 
of the WEP and the GPO can be enacted only 
by Congress. Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to review the Government Pension 
Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provi-
sion Social Security benefit reductions and 
to consider eliminating or reducing them by 
supporting H.R. 141 and S. 521 of the 116th 
Congress, the Social Security Fairness Act; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution 
shall be transmitted to the secretary of the 
United States Senate and the clerk of the 
United States House of Representatives and 
to each member of the Louisiana delegation 
to the United States Congress.

(3) notwithstanding paragraph (2), if an 
employer, at its sole discretion, maintains a

duties in a resident taxing jurisdiction and 
in only one nonresident taxing jurisdiction 
during one day, such employee shall be con-
sidered to have performed more of the em-
ployee’s employment duties in the non-
resident taxing jurisdiction than in the resi-
dent taxing jurisdiction for such day.

By Mr. PORTMAN (for himself, 
Mr. 
CARPER, 
Mr. 
BARRASSO, 
Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. BRAUN, 
Mr. COONS, Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, 
Ms. HASSAN, Mr. HAWLEY, Mr. 
MANCHIN, Mr. RISCH, Mr. RUBIO, 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, and Mr. TILLIS): 
S. 3997. A bill to strengthen the secu-
rity and integrity of the United States 
scientific and research enterprise; to 
the Committee on Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor to talk about a sig-
nificant step forward in holding China 
accountable for not playing by the 
rules. Today, after months of work, we 
are introducing bipartisan legislation 
called the Safeguarding American In-
novation Act that will help crack down 
on the rampant theft of U.S. taxpayer- 
funded research and innovation at 
America’s colleges and universities by 
foreign governments like China. It’s 
outrageous, and it has to stop. 
At the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations, which I chair, we con-
ducted a bipartisan year-long inves-
tigation in 2019 into how China has 
used so-called talent recruitment pro-
grams, most notably its Thousand Tal-
ents Plan, to steal U.S. taxpayer-fund-
ed research. The Chinese Communist 
Party has systematically targeted the 
most promising U.S. research and re-
searchers, and then paid these grant re-
cipients to take their taxpayer-funded 
research to China. That research and 
technology often ends up going directly 
to China to help fuel the rise of its 
military and economy. Part of the rea-
son it’s gone on so long, frankly, is be-
cause we’ve been asleep at the switch. 
That’s starting to change in the wake 
of our Subcommittee investigation. 
Right now, our law enforcement offi-
cials and other federal entities are 
working to hold China accountable for 
this IP theft problem but are limited in 
the actions they can take under cur-
rent law. All of the arrests they’ve 
made so far have been about peripheral 
financial crimes like wire fraud and 
tax evasion, not the core issue of tak-
ing American taxpayer-paid research 
to benefit China. Why? Because they 
don’t have the legal ability to address 
the root causes of this problem. 
That changes today. Along with my 
Democratic counterpart on the Sub-
committee, TOM
CARPER
from Dela-
ware, we are introducing the bipartisan 
Safeguarding American Innovation Act 
to empower the government to protect 
our research enterprise while keeping 
it open and transparent. 
First, our bill makes it a crime fail-
ing to disclose their foreign ties on fed-
eral 
grant 
applications, 
which, 
shockingly, it currently isn’t. 
It requires the Office of Management 
and Budget, OMB, to streamline and 
coordinate grant-making between the 
federal agencies so there’s needed ac-
countability and transparency when it 
comes to tracking the billions of dol-
lars of taxpayer-funded grant money 
that’s being distributed. 
It also allows the State Department 
to deny visas to foreign researchers 
who we know are seeking to steal re-
search and IP by exploiting exemptions 
in our export control laws. This may 
surprise you, but the State Department 
can’t do that now. Career foreign serv-
ice officers, employees at the State De-
partment, have asked us to provide 
this authority. 
Our bill also requires research insti-
tutions and universities to provide the 
State Department basic information 
about the sensitive technologies that a 
foreign researcher will have access to. 
And our bill ensures transparency by 
requiring universities to report any 
foreign gift of $50,000 or more and em-
powering the Department of Education 
to fine universities that repeatedly fail 
to disclose these gifts. 
Rather than just pointing the finger 
at China, we ought to be looking at our 
own government and our own institu-
tions and doing a better job here. Until 
we start to get our own house in order 
and take a firmer stance on foreign in-
fluence here in this country, we’re not 
going to see much improvement. That’s 
what this legislation does. In turn, I 
think showing that we’re serious about 
fixing our own vulnerabilities will send 
a firm but fair signal to China—and 
other adversaries looking to take ad-
vantage of our research enterprise—to 
change their behavior. I encourage my 
colleagues to support this bipartisan 
effort. 
I yield back.

Ms. DUCKWORTH):

628—CELE-
BRATING THE 140TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BE-
TWEEN 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
AND ROMANIA 
Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mrs. 
SHAHEEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 628 
Whereas the United States established dip-
lomatic relations with Romania in June 1880; 
Whereas, in 1997, the United States and Ro-
mania established a long-term partnership 
based on the United States’ recognition of 
Romania’s strategic importance, the com-
mitment to shared values, and a common in-
terest in stability and democratic progress; 
Whereas Romania joined the North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 and 
hosts NATO’s Multi-national Division Head-
quarters South East, a NATO Force Integra-
tion Unit, the Multi-national Brigade South 
East, and the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense 
System, a key element of the United States 
European Phased Adaptive Approach missile 
defense system; 
Whereas, in 2011, the United States and Ro-
mania issued the ‘‘Joint Declaration on 
Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century 
Between the United States of America and 
Romania’’, reflecting increasing cooperation 
between the countries and throughout the 
Black Sea region to promote security, de-
mocracy, free market opportunities, and cul-
tural exchange; 
Whereas Romania continues to modernize 
its armed forces and is 1 of 7 NATO members 
to have met its 2014 Wales Summit commit-
ment to allocate at least 2 percent of gross 
domestic product for defense spending; 
Whereas the Romanian Armed Forces have 
supported NATO and United States oper-
ations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other thea-
ters for almost 2 decades, contributing more 
than 30,000 total combat and support per-
sonnel to those missions, some of whom have 
made the ultimate sacrifice; 
Whereas Romania is a member of the Glob-
al Coalition to Defeat ISIS, provided human-
itarian assistance to the people of Iraq and 
Syria, and is making significant contribu-
tions to the fight against international ter-
rorism; 
Whereas, on August 20, 2019, the United 
States and Romania signed a memorandum 
of understanding outlining a shared commit-
ment to developing a secure and vibrant 
fifth-generation 
wireless 
infrastructure 
based on free and fair competition, trans-
parency, and the rule of law—including a rig-
orous evaluation of vendors. 
Whereas Romania has played a leading role 
in the establishment of the Three Seas Ini-
tiative and was one of the first countries to 
invest in the Three Seas Initiative Invest-
ment Fund, which aims to increase energy 
independence 
and 
infrastructure 
connectivity across Central and Eastern Eu-
rope; 
Whereas the United States and Romania 
have been deepening their economic rela-
tionship through increased bilateral trade 
and investment, and in 2017, Romania hosted 
the tenth annual United States Commercial 
Service Trade Winds Forum and Trade Mis-
sion, helping United States companies boost 
exports across Southeast Europe; 
Whereas, in 2018, as Romania celebrated its 
Unification 
Centennial, 
Governors 
from 
across the United States issued Proclama-
tions to congratulate Romanians and Roma-
nian-Americans on that historic milestone, 
illustrating the close ties and friendship that 
exist between the United States and Roma-
nia; 
Whereas, in 2019, Romanians all across the 
United States commemorated 30 years since 
Romania’s liberation from the former com-
munist regime, a powerful reminder of the 
fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 and a celebra-
tion of the triumphant call of freedom, lib-
erty, and dignity; 
Whereas the Romanian people have made 
progress in their efforts to hold their institu-
tions and leadership accountable in the con-
tinued fight against high-level corruption; 
Whereas Romania resides in the strategi-
cally important and increasingly militarized 
Black Sea region, and has proven itself a 
critical security ally in the region, including 
by hosting the annual NATO Sea Shield ex-
ercise; 
Whereas, during these times of unprece-
dented challenge caused by the COVID–19 
pandemic crisis, the United States and Ro-
mania are strengthening their partnership, 
such as through United States assistance 
with targeted funds, strategic military air-
lift and medical emergency equipment, and 
Romanian support for the swift repatriation 
of United States nationals overseas; 
Whereas, as a sign of solidarity and friend-
ship between the people of Romania and the 
United States, Romania sent its first med-
ical and expert support and advisory mission 
to Alabama, assigning 15 Romanian doctors, 
medical staff, and chemical and biological 
risk experts to exchange best practices and 
assist local COVID–19 efforts in care facili-
ties, nursing homes, and hospitals across the 
State; and 
Whereas 2020 marks the 140th anniversary 
of the establishment of diplomatic relations 
between the United States and Romania: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) celebrates the 140th anniversary of the 
establishment of diplomatic relations be-
tween the United States and Romania; 
(2) applauds the Government and the peo-
ple of Romania for the significant strides 
they have made in governance, anti-corrup-
tion, rule of law, economic reforms, and 
their continuing pursuit of democratic, so-
cial, and economic progress; 
(3) encourages the United States Govern-
ment to use its leadership in NATO to advo-
cate for an upgraded NATO presence in Ro-
mania, in order to better accommodate the 
evolving threat environment in and around 
the Black Sea region; and 
(4) reaffirms the enduring alliance between 
the United States and Romania, based upon 
shared democratic values, security partner-
ship, and increasing economic ties.

Mr. 
DAINES 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
PETERS, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. KING, Mr. 
CRAMER, Ms. MCSALLY, Mr. GARDNER, 
and Ms. HIRONO) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 629 
Whereas hundreds of millions of individ-
uals in the United States participate in out-
door recreation annually; 
Whereas Congress enacted the Outdoor 
Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act of 
2016 (Public Law 114–249; 130 Stat. 999) to as-
sess and analyze the outdoor recreation 
economy of the United States and the effects 
attributable to the outdoor recreation econ-
omy on the overall economy of the United 
States; 
Whereas the Outdoor Recreation Satellite 
Account updated in September 2019 by the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Depart-
ment of Commerce shows that outdoor recre-
ation contributed more than $427,000,000,000 
of current-dollar gross domestic product to 
the economy of the United States in 2017, 
comprising approximately 2.2 percent of the 
current-dollar gross domestic product; 
Whereas the Outdoor Recreation Satellite 
Account shows that, in 2017, the outdoor 
recreation sector experienced faster growth 
in real gross output, compensation, and em-
ployment than the overall economy of the 
United States, while also providing 5,200,000 
jobs across the United States; 
Whereas the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2019 (Public Law 116–6; 133 Stat. 13) en-
couraged the Department of Commerce to 
continue its work with the Outdoor Recre-
ation Satellite Account;

June 18, 2020 
Whereas regular outdoor recreation is as-
sociated with economic growth, positive 
health outcomes, and better quality of life; 
Whereas many outdoor recreation busi-
nesses are small businesses, which have been 
heavily impacted by the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, as a result of the COVID-19 pan-
demic, many outdoor recreation businesses 
have experienced decreases in sales and have 
furloughed or laid off employees; 
Whereas outdoor recreation businesses are 
cornerstones of rural communities and out-
door recreation is part of the national herit-
age of the United States; and 
Whereas June 2020 is an appropriate month 
to designate as ‘‘Great Outdoors Month’’ to 
provide an opportunity to celebrate the im-
portance of the great outdoors: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 2020 as ‘‘Great Outdoors 
Month’’; and 
(2) encourages all individuals in the United 
States to responsibly participate in recre-

SENATE RESOLUTION 630—DESIG-
NATING JUNE 20, 2020, AS ‘‘AMER-
ICAN EAGLE DAY’’ AND CELE-
BRATING THE RECOVERY AND 
RESTORATION 
OF 
THE 
BALD 
EAGLE, THE NATIONAL SYMBOL 
OF THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. 
DURBIN, 
Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. BOOZ-
MAN, Mrs. CAPITO, Ms. COLLINS, Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. JONES, 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. MANCHIN, Ms. 
SMITH, Mr. CARPER, and Mr. CARDIN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 630 
Whereas the bald eagle was chosen as the 
central image of the Great Seal of the United 
States on June 20, 1782, by the Founding Fa-
thers at the Congress of the Confederation; 
Whereas the bald eagle is widely known as 
the living national symbol of the United 
States and for many generations has rep-
resented values, such as— 
(1) freedom; 
(2) democracy; 
(3) courage; 
(4) strength; 
(5) spirit; 
(6) independence; 
(7) justice; and 
(8) excellence; 
Whereas the bald eagle is unique to North 
America and cannot be found naturally in 
any other part of the world, which was one of 
the primary reasons the Founding Fathers 
selected the bald eagle to symbolize the Gov-
ernment of the United States; 
Whereas the bald eagle is the central 
image used in the official logos of many 
branches and departments of the Federal 
Government, including— 
(1) the Executive Office of the President; 
(2) Congress; 
(3) the Supreme Court of the United 
States; 
(4) the Department of Defense; 
(5) the Department of the Treasury; 
(6) the Department of Justice; 
(7) the Department of State; 
(8) the Department of Commerce; 
(9) the Department of Homeland Security; 
(10) the Department of Veterans Affairs; 
(11) the Department of Labor; 
(12) the Department of Health and Human 
Services; 
(13) the Department of Energy; 
(14) the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development; 
(15) the Central Intelligence Agency; and 
(16) the United States Postal Service; 
Whereas the bald eagle is an inspiring sym-
bol of the spirit of freedom and the sov-
ereignty of the United States; 
Whereas the image and symbolism of the 
bald eagle has— 
(1) played a significant role in art, music, 
literature, 
architecture, 
commerce, 
edu-
cation, and culture in the United States; and 
(2) appeared on United States stamps, cur-
rency, and coinage; 
Whereas the bald eagle was endangered and 
facing possible extinction in the lower 48 
States but has made a gradual and encour-
aging comeback to the land, waterways, and 
skies of the United States; 
Whereas the dramatic recovery of the na-
tional bird of the United States is an endan-
gered species success story and an inspira-
tional example to other environmental, nat-
ural resource, and wildlife conservation ef-
forts worldwide; 
Whereas, in 1940, noting that the bald eagle 
was threatened with extinction, Congress 
passed the Act entitled ‘‘An Act for the pro-
tection of the bald eagle’’, approved June 8, 
1940 (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), which prohibited 
killing, selling, or possessing a bald eagle, 
and a 1962 amendment to that Act expanded 
protection to the golden eagle (referred to 
collectively in this preamble as the ‘‘Bald 
and Golden Eagle Protection Act’’); 
Whereas, by 1963, there were only an esti-
mated 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles re-
maining in the lower 48 States, with loss of 
habitat, poaching, and the use of pesticides 
and other environmental contaminants con-
tributing to the near demise of the national 
bird of the United States; 
Whereas, in 1967, the bald eagle was offi-
cially declared an endangered species under 
Public Law 89–669 (80 Stat. 926) (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Endangered Species Preserva-
tion Act of 1966’’) in areas in the United 
States south of the 40th parallel due to the 
dramatic decline in the population of the 
bald eagle in the lower 48 States; 
Whereas the Endangered Species Act of 
1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) was enacted in 
1973, and in 1978, the bald eagle was listed as 
an endangered species throughout the lower 
48 States, except in the States of Michigan, 
Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Wis-
consin, in which the bald eagle was listed as 
a threatened species; 
Whereas, in July 1995, the United States 
Fish and Wildlife Service announced that in 
the lower 48 States, the bald eagle had recov-
ered sufficiently to change the status of the 
species from endangered to threatened; 
Whereas, by 2007, bald eagles residing in 
the lower 48 States had rebounded to ap-
proximately 11,000 pairs; 
Whereas, on June 28, 2007, the Secretary of 
the Interior and the Director of the United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service removed the 
bald eagle from protection under the Endan-
gered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et 
seq.), but the bald eagle continues to be pro-
tected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Pro-
tection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
(16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), section 42 of title 18, 
United States Code (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘Lacey Act’’), and the Lacey 
Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371 et 
seq.); 
Whereas Challenger, the trained, edu-
cational bald eagle of the American Eagle 
Foundation in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, was 
invited by the Secretary of the Interior to 
perform a free-flight demonstration during 
the official bald eagle delisting ceremony 
held at the Jefferson Memorial in Wash-
ington, District of Columbia; 
Whereas experts and population growth 
charts estimate that the bald eagle popu-
lation could reach 15,000 pairs, even though a 
physical count has not been conducted by 
State and Federal wildlife agencies since 
2007; 
Whereas caring and concerned agencies, 
corporations, organizations, and people of 
the United States representing Federal and 
State governments and the private sector 
passionately and resourcefully banded to-
gether, determined to save and protect the 
national bird of the United States; 
Whereas the recovery of the bald eagle pop-
ulation in the United States was largely ac-
complished through— 
(1) the dedicated and vigilant efforts of 
Federal and State wildlife agencies and non-
profit organizations, such as the American 
Eagle Foundation; 
(2) public education; 
(3) captive breeding and release programs; 
(4) hacking and release programs; and 
(5) the translocation of bald eagles from 
places in the United States with dense bald 
eagle populations to suitable locations in the 
lower 48 States that had suffered a decrease 
in bald eagle populations; 
Whereas various nonprofit organizations, 
such as the Southeastern Raptor Center at 
Auburn University in the State of Alabama, 
contribute to the continuing recovery of the 
bald eagle through rehabilitation and edu-
cational efforts; 
Whereas the bald eagle might have been 
lost permanently if not for dedicated con-
servation efforts and strict protection laws 
such as— 
(1) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); 
(2) the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection 
Act; 
(3) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 
U.S.C. 703 et seq.); 
(4) the Lacey Act; and 
(5) the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 
U.S.C. 3371 et seq.); and 
Whereas the sustained recovery of the bald 
eagle population will require the continu-
ation of recovery, management, education, 
and public awareness programs to ensure 
that the population numbers and habitat of 
the bald eagle remain healthy and secure for 
generations to come: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 20, 2020, as ‘‘American 
Eagle Day’’; 
(2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle 
commemorative coins by the Secretary of 
the Treasury to generate critical funds for 
the protection of the bald eagle; and 
(3) encourages— 
(A) educational entities, organizations, 
businesses, conservation groups, and govern-
ment agencies with a shared interest in con-
serving endangered species to collaborate 
and develop educational tools for use in the 
public schools of the United States; and 
(B) the people of the United States to ob-
serve American Eagle Day with appropriate 
ceremonies and other activities.

KAINE, and Mr. CRUZ) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 632 
Whereas the United States and Ecuador 
have enjoyed a history of bilateral partner-
ship and cooperation, and share the aims of 
promoting 
democratic 
values, 
economic 
prosperity, and the security of both nations; 
Whereas the United States and Ecuador 
have taken important steps to restore the bi-
lateral relationship between the United 
States and Ecuador, including by signing 
various agreements to strengthen economic 
ties, security cooperation, and development 
opportunities; 
Whereas President Moreno has signaled Ec-
uador’s commitment to promoting demo-
cratic values and has advocated for greater 
government transparency; 
Whereas in February 2018, more than 64 
percent of Ecuadorians voted, in a constitu-
tional referendum, to reinstate a 2-term 
presidential limit, an effort that was carried 
out by President Moreno’s administration 
and which is indicative of the Ecuadorian 
people’s support for presidential term limits 
as a reasonable check against a history of 
corruption and abuse of power; 
Whereas the United States-Ecuador bilat-
eral relationship has been historically char-
acterized by strong commercial and invest-
ment ties through the Generalized System of 
Preferences, 
the 
United 
States-Ecuador 
Trade and Investment Council, and the Trea-
ty between the United States of America and 
the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the En-
couragement and Reciprocal Protection of 
Investment, done at Washington August 27, 
1993, which was terminated by Ecuador’s pre-
vious government, effective May 18, 2018; 
Whereas President Moreno’s administra-
tion has committed to implement economic 
policies that will lay the groundwork for sus-
tainable economic growth, while protecting 
the poorest and most vulnerable people; 
Whereas, under President Moreno’s leader-
ship, there have been significant advances in 
areas related to freedom of expression, in-
cluding through the reform of the controver-
sial Ecuadorian Communications Law; 
Whereas the Government of Ecuador has 
called for the peaceful restoration of democ-
racy and the rule of law in Venezuela and Ec-
uador has been a generous host of approxi-
mately 385,000 Venezuelan refugees; 
Whereas on May 15, 2019, the United States 
Agency 
for 
International 
Development 
(USAID) and Ecuador’s Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Human Mobility signed a Memo-
randum of Understanding agreeing to the re-
turn of the USAID Mission to Ecuador after 
the 53-year program was forced to close in 
2014 due to tensions in the bilateral relation-
ship; 
Whereas Ecuador has been one of the coun-
tries most affected by the COVID–19 pan-
demic in Latin America, with more than 
42,000 confirmed cases and approximately 
3,500 deaths as of June 5, 2020, which has 
overwhelmed the country’s health care sys-
tem and aggravated the country’s already 
challenging economic situation; 
Whereas in response to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, USAID is providing Ecuador with 
technical 
support 
and 
training 
in 
diagnostics, and technical assistance in clin-
ical management, risk communication, and 
community engagement; and 
Whereas the United States and Ecuador 
have agreed to advance security cooperation 
on 
law 
enforcement, 
counternarcotics, 
anticorruption, and bilateral military train-
ing and assistance: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms its commitment— 
(A) to the historic partnership between the 
United States and Ecuador; and 
(B) to continue working to strengthen the 
relationship between the United States and 
Ecuador based on mutual respect and shared 
democratic values and principles; 
(2) recognizes President Lenin Moreno and 
his administration for recommitting Ecua-
dor to democratic values, anti-corruption ef-
forts, and the adoption of economic policies 
that will benefit the people of Ecuador; 
(3) commends the important steps that 
President Moreno and his administration 
have taken to protect freedom of expression 
and freedom of the press in his country; 
(4) encourages the Republic of Ecuador to 
ensure that the rights of refugees and asy-
lum seekers are protected; and 
(5) supports actions to strengthen the his-
toric bilateral relationship between the 
United States and Ecuador, including— 
(A) the establishment of robust bilateral 
trade and investment frameworks with Ecua-
dor to build mutual prosperity through 
greater transparency and competitiveness; 
(B) stronger law enforcement and security 
cooperation between the two countries, in-
cluding in cybersecurity, border manage-
ment, counternarcotics, anti-money laun-
dering, 
military 
and 
civilian 
security 
professionalization, and criminal justice ca-
pabilities; 
(C) the return of the United States Agency

ecutive Calendar Nos. 713 and 716. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the nomina-
tions en bloc. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nations of William Zollars, of Kansas, 
to be a Governor of the United States 
Postal Service for a term expiring De-
cember 8, 2022, and Donald Lee Moak, 
of Florida, to be a Governor of the 
United States Postal Service for a term 
expiring December 8, 2022. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the nominations en bloc. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate vote on the 
nominations en bloc with no inter-
vening action or debate; that if con-
firmed, the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table en bloc; and that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Zollars and 
Moak nominations en bloc? 
The nominations were confirmed en 
bloc.

REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SE-
CRECY—TREATY DOCUMENT NOS. 
116–2, 116–3, AND 116–4 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the in-
junction of secrecy be removed from 
the following treaties transmitted to 
the Senate on June 18, 2020, by the 
President of the United States: Extra-
dition Treaty with the Republic of Cro-
atia, Treaty Document No. 116–2; Con-
vention on the Suppression of Unlawful 
Acts Relating to International Civil 
Aviation, Treaty Document No. 116–3; 
Protocol Supplementary to the Con-
vention for the Suppression of Unlaw-
ful Seizure of Aircraft, Treaty Docu-
ment No. 116–4; I further ask that the 
treaties be considered as having been 
read the first time; that they be re-
ferred, with accompanying papers, to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and ordered to be printed; and that the 
President’s message be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The messages of the President are as 
follows: 
To the Senate of the United States: 
With a view to receiving advice and 
consent of the Senate to ratification, I 
transmit herewith the Agreement be-
tween the Government of the United 
States of America and the Government 
of the Republic of Croatia comprising 
the instrument as contemplated by Ar-
ticle 3(2) of the Agreement on Extra-
dition between the United States of 
America and the European Union, 
signed June 25, 2003, as to the Applica-
tion of the Treaty on Extradition 
signed on October 25, 1901 (the ‘‘U.S.- 
Croatia Extradition Agreement’’), and 
the Agreement between the Govern-
ment of the United States and the Gov-
ernment of the Republic of Croatia 
comprising the Instrument as con-
templated by Article 3(3) of the Agree-
ment on Mutual Legal Assistance be-
tween the United States of America 
and the European Union signed at 
Washington on June 25, 2003 (the ‘‘U.S.- 
Croatia 
Mutual 
Legal 
Assistance 
Agreement’’), both signed at Wash-
ington on December 10, 2019. I also 
transmit, for the information of the 
Senate, the report of the Department 
of State with respect to the U.S.-Cro-
atia Extradition and Mutual Legal As-
sistance Agreements. Following Cro-
atia’s accession to the European Union 
on July 1, 2013, these two agreements 
fulfill the requirements, in respect of 
Croatia, for implementing bilateral in-
struments between the United States 
and each member of the European 
Union contained in the Agreements on 
Extradition and Mutual Legal Assist-
ance between the United States of 
America and the European Union, both 
of which entered into force on Feb-
ruary 1, 2010. 
The U.S.-Croatia Extradition Agree-
ment modernizes in important respects 
the Treaty between the United States 
of America and the Kingdom of Serbia 
for the Extradition of Fugitives from 
Justice, signed October 25, 1901 (the 
‘‘1901 Extradition Treaty’’), which is 
currently in force between the United 
States of America and the Republic of 
Croatia. Most significantly, it replaces 
the outdated list of extraditable of-
fenses with the modern ‘‘dual crimi-
nality’’ approach, thereby enabling 
coverage of newer offenses, such as 
cyber-related 
crimes, 
environmental 
offenses, and money laundering. In ad-
dition, it includes several provisions 
updating and streamlining procedural 
requirements for preparing and trans-
mitting extradition documents. 
The U.S.-Croatia Mutual Legal As-
sistance 
Agreement 
formalizes 
and 
strengthens the institutional frame-
work for legal assistance between the 
United States of America and the Re-
public of Croatia in criminal matters. 
Because the United States of America 
and the Republic of Croatia do not 
have a bilateral mutual legal assist-
ance treaty in force, the U.S.-Croatia 
Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement is 
a partial treaty governing only those 
issues regulated by the U.S.-European 
Union Mutual Legal Assistance Agree-
ment, specifically: identification of 
bank information, joint investigative 
teams, video-conferencing, expedited 
transmission of requests, assistance to 
administrative authorities, use limita-
tions, confidentiality, and grounds for 
refusal. This approach is consistent 
with that taken with other European 
Union member states (Bulgaria, Den-
mark, Finland, Malta, Portugal, Slo-
vak Republic, and Slovenia) with which 
the United States does not have an ex-
isting mutual legal assistance treaty. 
I recommend that the Senate give 
early and favorable consideration to 
the U.S.-Croatia Extradition Agree-
ment and the U.S.-Croatia Mutual 
Legal Assistance Agreement.

same date. I also transmit, for the in-
formation of the Senate, the report of 
the Department of State with respect 
to the Beijing Protocol. 
The Beijing Protocol is an important 
component of international efforts to 
prevent and punish terrorism targeting 
civil aviation. It supplements the Con-
vention for the Suppression of Unlaw-
ful Seizure of Aircraft, done at The 
Hague 
on 
December 
l6, 
1970 
(the 
‘‘Hague Convention’’), and fills several 
gaps in the existing international legal 
framework for combatting global ter-
rorism. It will significantly advance 
cooperation between States Parties in 
the prevention of the full range of un-
lawful acts relating to civil aviation 
and in the prosecution and punishment 
of offenders. 
The Beijing Protocol amends the ex-
isting hijacking offense in the Hague 
Convention to cover hijackings that 
occur pre- or post-flight and addresses 
situations in which the offender may 
attempt to control an aircraft from 
outside of the aircraft, such as by re-
motely interfering with flight oper-
ation or data transmission systems. 
The Beijing Protocol requires States 
Parties to criminalize these acts under 
their domestic laws and to cooperate to 
prevent 
and 
investigate 
suspected 
crimes under the Beijing Protocol. It 
includes an ‘‘extradite or prosecute’’ 
obligation with respect to persons ac-
cused of committing, attempting to 
commit, conspiring to commit, or aid-
ing in the commission of such offenses. 
Some changes to United States law 
will be needed for the United States to 
implement provisions of the Beijing 
Protocol, obligating the United States 
to criminalize certain offenses, make 
those offenses punishable by appro-
priate penalties, and authorize the as-
sertion of jurisdiction over such of-
fenses. Proposed legislation is being 
separately transmitted by my Adminis-
tration to the Congress. 
I recommend that the Senate give 
early and favorable consideration to 
the Beijing Protocol, subject to a res-
ervation and certain understandings 
that are described in the accompanying 
report of the Department of State. 
DONALD J. TRUMP.
THE WHITE HOUSE, June 18, 2020. 
To the Senate of the United States: 
With a view to receiving the advice 
and consent of the Senate to ratifica-
tion, I transmit herewith the Conven-
tion on the Suppression of Unlawful 
Acts Relating to International Civil 
Aviation (the ‘‘Beijing Convention’’), 
adopted by the International Civil 
Aviation 
Organization 
International 
Conference on Air Law (Diplomatic 
Conference on Aviation Security) in 
Beijing on September 10, 2010, and 
signed by the United States on that 
same date. I also transmit, for the in-
formation of the Senate, the report of 
the Department of State with respect 
to the Beijing Convention. 
The Beijing Convention is an impor-
tant component of international efforts 
to prevent and punish both terrorism 
targeting civil aviation and the pro-
liferation of weapons of mass destruc-
tion. As between parties to the Beijing 
Convention, it replaces and supersedes 
the Convention for the Suppression of 
Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of 
Civil Aviation, done at Montreal, Sep-
tember 23, 1971, and its supplementary 
protocol, the Protocol for the Suppres-
sion of Unlawful Acts of Violence at 
Airports Serving International Civil 
Aviation, done at Montreal, February 
24, 1988. It significantly strengthens 
the existing international counterter-
rorism legal framework and facilitates 
the prosecution and extradition of 
those who seek to commit acts of ter-
ror, including acts such as those com-
mitted on September 11, 2001. 
The Beijing Convention establishes 
the first international treaty frame-
work that criminalizes certain ter-
rorist acts, including using an aircraft 
in a terrorist activity and certain acts 
relating to the transport of weapons of 
mass destruction or related materials 
by aircraft. The Beijing Convention re-
quires States Parties to criminalize 
specified acts under their domestic 
laws and to cooperate to prevent and 
investigate suspected crimes under the 
Beijing Convention. It includes an ‘‘ex-
tradite or prosecute’’ obligation with 
respect to persons accused of commit-
ting, attempting to commit, conspiring 
to commit, or aiding in the commission 
of such offenses. 
Some changes to United States law 
will be needed for the United States to 
implement provisions of the Beijing 
Convention 
obligating 
the 
United 
States to criminalize certain offenses, 
make those offenses punishable by ap-
propriate penalties, and authorize the 
assertion of jurisdiction over such of-
fenses. Proposed legislation is being 
separately transmitted by my Adminis-
tration to the Congress. 
I recommend that the Senate give 
early and favorable consideration to 
the Beijing Convention, subject to a 
reservation and certain understandings 
that are described in the accompanying 
report of the Department of State.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
PRO-
MOTING FAIR AND EFFECTIVE 
POLICING 
THROUGH 
RESEARCH 
ACT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I am introducing the Promoting Fair and 
Effective Policing Through Research Act. 
We are a nation in mourning. Our shared 
anguish over the loss of George Floyd, 
Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard 
Brooks, Botham Jean and countless other 
black men and women at the hands of police 
has spurred a growing chorus of Americans to 
demand not only justice, but meaningful and 
lasting change. 
Cities across the nation are grappling with 
how to respond. A number of officials have 
committed to sweeping reductions in police 
department funding and embraced a move to-
ward innovative approaches to providing pub-
lic safety. Others are calling for more re-
sources for police departments and advocating 
for procedural reforms. 
I am heartened that we, as a nation, are en-
gaging in a substantive discourse about the 
role of policing in American society. This day 
is long overdue and has come at too high a 
cost, but we must seize this opportunity. We 
must dig deep to examine how the history and 
culture of policing in America has brought us 
to this tumultuous place. And, in our search 
for solutions, we must be guided by evidence 
grounded in data and scientific research. 
First and foremost, we must have a national 
database on police use of force, and I am glad 
to see this included in the Justice in Policing 
Act. We must explore the legacy of policing 
and the root cause of the racial disparities we 
observe. We must assess the organizational 
influences on policing—such as recruitment, 
training, and performance evaluation. We must 
examine promising practices for promoting ac-
countability and fostering community trust. We 
must study the influence of technology and big 
data on vulnerable populations and work to 
root out any biases. Finally, we must establish 
meaningful partnerships between law enforce-
ment and researchers to empower jurisdictions 
to tailor proven solutions to meet their needs 
and the needs of the communities they serve. 
The bill I am introducing today directs the 
National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund 
social and behavioral research on policing 
policies, including the causes, consequences, 
and mitigation of police violence. NSF is di-
rected to support collaborative partnerships 
between social science researchers, law en-
forcement agencies, and civil society organiza-
tions. The bill also provides for a National 
Academies study to identify research gaps re-
lated to law enforcement policies, collect 
promising practices, and make recommenda-
tions for advancing research and implementa-
tion of proven solutions. 
This bill would also address research and 
standards for biometric identification tech-
nologies, including facial recognition tech-
nologies. If we allow inaccuracies or biases to 
persist in these systems, then when deployed 
in high-impact situations, like decision making 
in the criminal justice system, those biases will 
disproportionately harm communities of color. 
Important research and testing at the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology has al-
ready helped identify the biases and improve 
the accuracy of these systems. This bill directs 
NIST to expand upon these efforts and focus 
on new areas in need of testing, such as cap-
ture devices. This bill will also help lead to 
standardization of methodologies and prac-
tices to eliminate biases across the industry 
and develop guidance to inform law enforce-
ment procurement decisions. 
Importantly, science and standardization are 
only two pieces in the biometric puzzle. We 
need a national privacy law to limit the risk of 
abuse 
from 
biometric 
identification 
tech-
nologies. I call on my colleagues in the House 
Committee on Oversight and Reform, the 
House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
and the House Committee on the Judiciary to 
take up this issue with haste. 
Finally, the bill leverages science at the De-
partment of Homeland Security to support the 
reduction of excessive use of force and lethal 
use of force by law enforcement. There have 
been too many fatal encounters with not only 
state and local police across the country, but 
also with Federal law enforcement, including 
the U.S. Park Police. This bill requires the 
Under Secretary for Science and Technology 
to consult with the Federal Law Enforcement 
Training Centers to support research and data 
analysis to improve training, policies, and 
practices for Federal, state, local, and tribal 
law enforcement officials. The Department’s 
research and support for risk assessment 
tools can assist in the development of guide-
lines and best practices for policing and police 
training, including how to mitigate racial bias 
and minimize the use of excessive force. 
I urge my colleagues to join me and help 
move this legislation forward into law.

HONORING THE CLASS OF 2020 AS 
IOWANS OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, in honor of all 
of this year’s graduates, I am proud to recog-
nize the Class of 2020 across Iowa’s Third 
Congressional District as our Iowans of the 
Week. As we near the end of the semester for 
thousands of students, I ask that you all join 
me in taking a moment to acknowledge their 
accomplishments over the course of the year 
and congratulate them on this achievement as 
they move forward in their lives and toward 
their next endeavors. 
Unfortunately, many of the traditions and 
ceremonies our graduates would typically look 
forward to have been cancelled. The pag-
eantry and tradition of turned tassels, pomp 
and circumstance, and the bestowing of the 
degree or the diploma will sadly not come this 
year. And just as this pandemic has denied 
graduates these moments, so too has it com-
pounded the daily challenges of life these stu-
dents have faced. 
As distance learning has become the new 
norm, these students have developed a whole 
new appreciation for the academic, social, and 
emotional supports that have helped them 
along the way. While these unfortunate cir-
cumstances have clouded a typically joyous 
time of year, it has been remarkable to see 
students rise to the challenge, adapt, and 
learn with little time to plan. They transitioned 
to online and distance learning and were able 
to come out on the other side more resilient 
as they finish the final days of their final year. 
Iowa’s teachers and students have been in-
novative and have stepped up to support their 
local communities, showing just what we are 
capable of in the face of adversity. Some stu-
dents are even working around the clock to 
produce face shields for health care workers, 
as well as creating masks for friends and fam-
ily. 
The students of the Class of 2020 deserve 
special recognition this week for their willing-
ness to forego many of the most cherished 
traditions of their final year in order to help the 
greater community. These students represent 
the heart of Iowa’s communities and will be 
the next generation of leaders who will still be 
faced with the problems of today later down 
the road. 
I am grateful for every member of the Class 
of 2020 who has completed a great milestone 
in their lives to become a better and more 
educated citizen who will contribute great 
things to our society we have yet to even think 
of. So please allow me to express my deep 
appreciation and thanks to every graduating 
student in Iowa’s Third Congressional District 
by honoring them today as Iowans of the 
Week.

HONORING RUDOLPH HYDE AS A 
DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN CEN-
TRAL FLORIDA FOR CARIBBEAN

HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

land of Jamaica who migrated to the United 
States of America and attended Polk State 
College; graduating with a degree in Computer

leadership positions throughout the years. His 
love for ministry led him to start the Faith 
Temple 
Apostolic 
Ministries 
International 
church in Eagle Lake, Florida in March 2014, 
and was ordained as the Pastor. He is sup-
ported by his wife Marlene and four children. 
The church in Eagle Lake is a multi-cultural 
ministry serving the whole individual regard-
less of challenges or limitations. He believes 
there is nothing too difficult for God and be-
lieves that a voice in the community is a voice 
for hope and identity. Through the platform of 
his ministry, he has opened opportunities to 
work and help in the community by addressing 
the needs of the people. Over the years, the 
ministry has been able to provide food, cloth-
ing and funds to the general public through 
the Feed the People Program. 
For the last 6 years, the ministry has hosted 
a free public annual event known as Jamaica 
Day, bringing Caribbean culture, food and 
music to the community of Polk County which 
draws in hundreds of people annually. 
With his passion for giving back, Pastor 
Hyde also founded Hyde’s Academy in Eagle 
Lake to provide Computer and CPR training to 
the general community with the American 
Heart Association’s support. He believes that 
there is nothing impossible that the human 
mind cannot accomplish if we work and unite 
together.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. JEFFREY 
L. CURTIS AS HE RECEIVES THE 
JOHN B. BARNWELL AWARD 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Dr. Jeffrey L. Curtis as he receives the 2019 
John B. Barnwell Award. Dr. Curtis’s commit-
ment to advancing the healthcare of our na-
tion’s veterans is worthy of commendation. 
After receiving his medical degree from the 
Georgetown University School of Medicine, Dr. 
Curtis completed his clinical residency at the 
Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and 
spent two years as a Clinical Immunology Fel-
low at the National Institute on Aging, NIH. 
Following residency, Dr. Curtis trained in Pul-
monary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) at 
the University of California San Francisco, 
where he joined the faculty at the San Fran-
cisco VA. Dr. Curtis continued his work with 
veterans at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare Sys-
tem, where he served as Chief in the PCCM 
Section and as scientific director of a Re-
search Enhancement Award Program center 
in tobacco-induced lung diseases. Dr. Curtis 
has held leadership roles in several COPD 
trials and continues to lead groundbreaking re-
search 
efforts, 
including 
the 
ongoing 
SPIROMICS and COPDGene studies. Further-
more, Dr. Curtis is the Associate Editor of the 
American Journal of Respiratory and Critical 
Care Medicine, is the past-Chair of the Amer-
ican Thoracic Scientific Assembly on Allergy, 
Immunology, and Inflammation, and is a cur-
rent professor at the University of Michigan in 
Ann Arbor. 
Receiving the prestigious John B. Barnwell 
Award exemplifies Dr. Curtis’s continued com-
mitment to scientific discovery and improving 
health outcomes for our nation’s veterans. The 
award, which represents the Clinical Science 
Research and Development Service’s highest 
honor within the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs, recognizes senior VHA investigators who 
have achieved international acclaim for their 
clinical research accomplishments and have 
led clinical research endeavors that have ad-
vanced the diagnosis and treatment of dis-
eases and disorders in the veteran population. 
Undoubtably, Dr. Curtis is a deserving recipi-
ent of this award. He is internationally recog-
nized as a leading researcher in the field of 
pulmonary disease and has led a number of 
major clinical trials and programs that have 
advanced the study of chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease and other lung disorders. Dr. 
Curtis has dedicated his career to clinical re-
search and continues to transform the quality 
of care for veterans nationwide. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Dr. Jeffrey Curtis as he re-
ceives the John B. Barnwell Award. We thank 
him for his meaningful work and wish him con-
tinued success in the years ahead.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
ELIZABETH 
‘‘BETSY’’ 
GIL-
BERTSON 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
the heaviest of hearts that I rise today to pay 
tribute to Elizabeth ‘‘Betsy’’ Gilbertson, a dear 
friend who we lost much too soon. Though 
she waged a fierce battle, Betsy recently lost 
her fight with ovarian cancer. 
Betsy dedicated her professional life and 
much of her personal time to ensuring that ev-
eryone has access to affordable, quality health 
care. From the earliest days of her career, 
Betsy combined her passion for advocacy with 
that of her belief that quality, affordable 
healthcare was a right, not a privilege. As a 
member of the Connecticut Nurses Associa-
tion and District 1199, New England SEIU, 
Betsy represented her fellow nurses in collec-
tive bargaining. She also led a non-profit wom-
en’s health center before joining UNITE HERE 
HEALTH, a Taft-Hartley labor management 
trust fund that provides health benefits that 
offer high quality, affordable health care to 
their participants, where she held a number of 
leadership roles prior to her last position as 
Chief of Strategy. 
Betsy’s dedication to quality, affordable 
healthcare extended far beyond her profes-
sional career. She served on National Quality 
Forum Task Forces on patient safety and am-
bulatory care measures; was founder as well 
as Chair/Co-Chair of the Health Services Coa-
lition, a labor management organization that 
contracts with hospitals and advocates for 
public policies that improve quality health care, 
affordability, and access in Nevada; and was 
a Board member of the National Committee 
for Quality Assurance for five years. In more 
recent years, she continued her good work 
serving on the Lown Institute Advisory Council 
and the federal Interagency Pain Research 
Coordinating Committee. 
For me, Betsy was not only been an invalu-
able resource on healthcare issues, but a 
cherished friend. It is a friendship that dates 
back to a time before our lives took us to 
Washington, D.C. Betsy and her husband, 
John, lived in my childhood neighborhood of 
Wooster Square in New Haven, Connecticut 
for many years—John and my husband, Stan, 
teaching together at Yale University long be-
fore we met. Betsy and I were kindred spirits 
and I will be forever grateful to have had her 
friendship all these years. 
I am heartbroken at Betsy’s loss and extend 
my deepest sympathies to her husband, John 
Wilhelm, as well as their children Tom and 
Vinnie; and their three grandchildren. I, like so 
many of those who had the opportunity to 
know her, consider myself fortunate to have 
called her my friend and will continue to be in-
spired by her memory. Betsy was an extraor-
dinary woman who passion and dedication 
touched countless lives—this world is just a bit 
dimmer without her in it.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MARY H. 
MCCOMBS 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor World War II veteran 
and 
Rialto 
community 
leader 
Mary 
H. 
McCombs. 
A graduate of University of Redlands, Mary 
began her decades of community service as a 
social worker with the Riverside County Wel-
fare Department. Shortly after President Roo-
sevelt’s signing of the Navy Women’s Reserve 
Act into law in 1942, she answered the call to 
serve her country and enlisted in the U.S. 
Navy WAVES program. 
Mary’s tenure in the WAVES program re-
sulted in travel to New York, Norco, California, 
and the San Francisco Bay where she trained 
to serve the Navy in a medical capacity. Until 
the end of World War II, she was stationed at 
the Naval Hospital on Treasure Island where 
her primary duties involved tracking all the ad-
missions and discharges for the hospital. 
Upon discharge from the Navy, Mary mar-
ried Ray McCombs and moved to Rialto, Cali-
fornia, where she served as First Lady of Ri-
alto from 1952 to 1954. A loving mother of five 
children, she always sought opportunities to 
improve the lives of others. In 1962 she re-
turned to work for the San Bernardino County 
Adoption Service, where she placed hundreds 
of children into loving homes throughout the 
county. Mary’s beloved husband sadly passed 
in 1983. 
Mary continued to remain active in the com-
munity and with her local church. She was a 
member of the American Association of Uni-
versity Women, the Rialto Symphony Guild 
and other civic organizations. In June 1995, 
she served on the task force to build the Ri-
alto Senior Center and subsequently served 
on their board. Within education, Mary contrib-
uted to the establishment of the Morrow- 
McCombs Memorial Lecture Series at Cal 
State University, San Bernardino, which had a 
focus on fostering better understanding among 
Christian, Jewish, and Muslim people. 
An avid traveler, Mary visited sites around 
the world and accomplished many feats in her 
travels, such as climbing the Great Pyramid of

Giza in her late seventies. She enjoyed exer-
cise, as demonstrated by her frequent 3-mile 
walks to Trapp Elementary School. Mary re-
mained active throughout her retired life, until 
she peacefully passed away on June 6, 2020. 
For her decades of commitment to our com-
munity and country in so many ways, we 
honor Mary H. McCombs on this day and 
thank her for the legacy she left in the City of 
Rialto and the greater Inland Empire. May she 
rest in peace.

IN HONOR OF MR. ANDRE MOSES 
WHITE 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Andre 
Moses White of Atlanta, Georgia, who passed 
away on June 9, 2020. 
Mr. White was the third of seven children 
born to Moses and Lucille White. He was 
raised in Tampa before relocating to Tallahas-
see and graduating from Lincoln High School. 
He then enrolled at Florida A&M University 
and earned a BS in Physical Education with a 
minor in Health Education. After graduating 
from FAMU, White was drafted by the Denver 
Broncos as a Tight End. He also played for 
the San Diego Chargers and was one of the 
first African Americans to sign with the Cin-
cinnati Bengals. 
After a knee injury brought his football ca-
reer to a close, White returned to Tampa to 
serve as the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Officer for Hillsborough County. 
While there, he most notably launched the 
fight to remove the confederate flag from the 
County Seal. This was eventually accom-
plished in 2016. Mr. White’s career also in-
cluded following in his father’s footsteps and 
operating Moses White’s Cozy Comer BBQ 
restaurant, serving as the road manager for 
Marvin Gaye, and starting The Georgia Sen-
tinel, a progressive news outlet for Atlanta’s 
African American community. 
Mr. White was a member of numerous orga-
nizations, served on the board of Wayfield 
Food Stores, and was the President of the 
Moses White Foundation. Mr. White will be 
forever remembered as a dedicated servant 
from whom many in the community sought 
council. His wife of 55 years, Joyce White, 
died on April 2, 2020. He is survived by his 
siblings, 4 children, and grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in 
offering our deepest and heartfelt condolences 
to the White family and friends. He will be 
greatly missed. 
May God continue to bless the family of Mr. 
Andre Moses White.

RECOGNIZING TROY 
CHARBONNEAU 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Detective Troy Charbonneau of 
Billings for always being prepared and willing 
to answer the call of duty whether he is in uni-
form or off duty. 
It was the first weekend of June, and Troy 
wanted to take advantage of the nice weather. 
He packed his kayak and headed to Lake 
Elmo with his new puppy which was also 
eager to get outside. With his kayak in the 
water and his pup enjoying the view, Troy was 
able to relax. 
After a while, Troy noticed a small dot on 
the lake’s horizon. He looked closer and real-
ized it was a person about 250 yards from the 
bank. At the shore, people were yelling. The 
swimmer 
was 
struggling, 
his 
head 
dis-
appearing underwater. Realizing the severity 
of the situation, Troy immediately steered his 
kayak toward the boy. Troy was able to get 
the boy alongside his kayak and secure him 
with a life jacket. Using a rope, he towed the 
boy safely to shore as sounds of ambulance 
and police sirens echoed across the lake. 
A detective with the Yellowstone County 
Sheriff’s Office, Troy says being a police offi-
cer is a 24/7 job. If you’re off duty, he says, 
you still have a responsibility to do what you 
can to keep everyone safe. An investigator of 
crimes against children and a forensic inter-
viewer, Troy is dedicated to the Billings com-
munity, and that drive keeps him ready at a 
moment’s notice. Troy saved a boy from 
drowning, because he’s always observant of 
everything around him. He’s committed his life 
to public service and law enforcement. 
On behalf of a grateful Montana and nation, 
I thank Troy and all our law enforcement offi-
cials who serve our communities selflessly, 
honorably, and with full hearts. 
Madam Speaker, for his swift, heroic actions 
to save a boy’s life and for being a great ex-
ample of service for all Montanans, I recog-
nize Detective Troy Charbonneau of Billings 
for his Spirit of Montana.

UPON 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF 
DEBRAH MARRIOTT AS EXECU-
TIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LOWER 
COLUMBIA ESTUARY PARTNER-
SHIP 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, it is 
with mixed emotions that I congratulate Deb 
Marriott, the founding and long-time Executive 
Director of the Lower Columbia Estuary Part-
nership, on her well-deserved retirement. For 
twenty-five years, Deb has very capably led 
the Estuary Partnership to educate youth, re-
store Columbia River ecosystems, and advo-
cate for culturally appropriate, science-based 
management. She has proven to be a com-
mitted and collaborative partner for Tribes, 
schools, shippers, and fishing communities, as 
well as municipalities along the Columbia. And 
she has left the River, and its communities, all 
the better through her work. 
Deb was instrumental in designing—and ul-
timately helping to pass into law in 2016—the 
Columbia River Basin Restoration Act, legisla-
tion that I and fellow Oregon colleagues cre-
ated to reduce toxics in the Columbia. She 
worked to bring people together around a 
common theme—cleaning up the river—and 
kept true to the science. This is just one ex-
ample of her work; throughout the years she 
has developed a reputation for honesty, hard 
work, and exceptional quality, and that stand-
ing has been passed on to the Estuary Part-
nership. The resiliency of so many on-the 
ground projects, the result of many long hours 
and much collaboration with partners, and of 
the National Estuary Program itself, show 
Deb’s meaningful mark on the River and its 
communities for generations to come. 
Issues of salmon recovery and watershed 
protection are not always the easiest in the 
Pacific Northwest, yet I have known Deb to be 
not just a tireless advocate, but also a skilled 
listener. Whether it has been through work 
with Tribes, politicians and agency officials, 
volunteers, students, or any number of other 
stakeholders, Deb has always kept her eyes 
on the bigger picture. 
Her work has played a tremendous role in 
connecting people to this special part of our 
amazing planet. I thank Deb from the bottom 
of my heart, for her decades of service. I wish 
her the best in a well-deserved retirement.

HONORING DEBRAH MARRIOTT ON 
HER 
RETIREMENT 
AS 
EXECU-

COLUMBIA ESTUARY PARTNER-
SHIP 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Debrah Marriott on her retirement as 
Executive Director of the Lower Columbia Es-
tuary Partnership at the end of this month. 
Throughout her career, Debrah has been a 
steadfast champion for protecting and advo-
cating for the Lower Columbia River. Debrah 
has led the Lower Columbia Estuary Partner-
ship since its inception, and there is no doubt 
that the river’s habitats and water quality are 
improved today because of Debrah’s leader-
ship, particularly her work on the Columbia 
River Basin Restoration Act. 
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Estuary 
Caucus, I have relied on Debrah’s expertise 
for years. Her thoughtful perspective and ex-
tensive network through the National Estuary 
Program have been invaluable. Most recently, 
she and her staff helped inform my work on 
the bipartisan Blue Carbon for Our Planet Act. 
Last year, I had the pleasure of joining Debrah 
at the groundbreaking of the Steigerwald Re-
connection Project, a 960–acre habitat res-
toration project on the mainstem of the Colum-
bia River that will help salmon, wildlife, and 
the larger ecosystem flourish. Projects like 
Steigerwald and countless others along the 
Columbia River would not exist without 
Debrah’s commitment to collaboration with re-
gional partners. I appreciate her dedication to 
the ecological benefits of a project, and also 
her commitment to supporting the region’s 
economic, social, and cultural needs. Even 
during the coronavirus pandemic, Debrah 
joined me for a virtual panel discussion earlier 
this month on how to revitalize our coastal 
communities. 
Debrah’s tenacity and dedication to pro-
tecting our lands and waters has created an 
incredible legacy of conservation for our re-
gion. I thank Debrah for her more than 25

HONORING JEREMY THOMAS LA-
NIER 
AS 
A 
DISTINGUISHED 
LEADER IN CENTRAL FLORIDA 
FOR PRIDE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, 4th generation 
Floridian, Jeremy Thomas Lanier has been a 
lifelong resident of Osceola County. For dec-
ades he has worked with his parents, Tom 
and Sharon Lanier, in their family antiques 
store located in the heart of Historic Down-
town Kissimmee. Raised with a sense of civic 
duty, Jeremy is president of the Downtown 
Business Association of Kissimmee, an orga-
nization that both of his parents led at one 
time, and he also serves as a board member 
of various community organizations including 
Kissimmee Main Street, the Osceola County 
Historical Society, the Opportunity Center, and 
the Osceola County LGBTA. 
In 2017 Jeremy began his career in public 
health at the Florida Department of Health in 
Osceola County working primarily with HIV pa-
tients in the ASPECTS clinic. After graduating 
with a degree in psychology from Rollins Col-
lege in Winter Park, Jeremy used his edu-
cation to successfully counsel both newly di-
agnosed and long-term HIV survivors and as-
sist them throughout the treatment process. In 
addition to his counseling position at the 
health department, he also began working in 
the AIDS Drug Assistance Program where he 
manages the medication regimens of over 200 
Osceola County clients. 
Jeremy also manages the ADAP Copay and 
Premium Assistance program; assisting over 
50 clients with the acquisition and manage-
ment of their insurance acquired through the 
Healthcare Marketplace. Jeremy also assists 
in the oversight of the PrEP program through 
which over 100 clients have been afforded ac-
cess to pre-exposure prophylaxis. Recently he 
accepted the position of Public Information Of-
ficer at the FDOH-Osceola where he manages 
media relations, internal and public messaging 
and public outreach for the health department. 
Jeremy and his partner Christopher May live 
in the business district of Historic Downtown 
Kissimmee where they are active in commu-
nity organizations and proudly support LGBT 
causes throughout Osceola County.

HONORING CAPTAIN RAY 
SPRADLIN 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captain 
Ray Spradlin for his exceptional public service 
to the people of the city of Santa Rosa and 
the State of California, and to honor his retire-
ment after 38 years as a fireman. 
Captain Ray Spradlin was born in St. Louis, 
Missouri. He attended Petaluma High School 
from 1977 to 1981 and graduated from Santa 
Rosa Junior College in 1984. Since then, he 
has dedicated his career to serving the com-
munity around him, often while it was at its 
lowest point. He rose through the ranks of the 
California Department of Forestry and Fire 
Protection and the Santa Rosa Fire Depart-
ment, earning the respect of those around 
him. As captain, he used the knowledge and 
expertise gained from his years of experience 
to both lead his colleagues in protecting mem-
bers of the public and ensuring a safer work-
ing environment for the people around him. He 
will continue to dedicate his life to protecting 
fellow first responders even after his retire-
ment through his work with Worldwide Safety 
Solutions. 
Throughout his career, Captain Spradlin has 
been recognized for his hard work and com-
mitment to fighting for the people around him. 
He was honored at the 2010 Sonoma County 
Paramedic Associate Survivors Union for pro-
viding life-saving treatment to Yessenia Cruz, 
who would have died if it were not for the 
quick actions of Captain Spradlin. This rec-
ognition is just one example of countless he-
roic actions taken by Captain Spradlin to pro-
tect his community. More recently, Captain 
Spradlin served on the front lines during the 
Tubbs Fire in 2017, working tirelessly for days 
to fight that devastating disaster. 
Madam Speaker, Captain Ray Spradlin rep-
resents the type of fine citizen that we should 
all strive to be. His career has been dedicated 
to protecting both his community and his fel-
low first responders. It is therefore fitting and 
proper that we honor him here today.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FARM-TO- 
MARKET ROAD REPAIR ACT 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the Farm-to-Market Road 
Repair Act, legislation that will expand eligi-
bility for the Surface Transportation Block 
Grant program to include rural roads that 
serve to transport agriculture products from 
farms or ranches to the marketplace. 
American agricultural communities play a 
pivotal role in the economy within my district 
and 
across 
America. 
These 
farms 
and 
ranches provide the communities they serve 
with fresh products daily, ensuring consumers 
have an adequate and healthy food supply. 
Unfortunately, many of the roads are deterio-
rating. 
Over 70 percent of our nation’s total road 
mileage is in rural areas, yet, between 2009 
and 2015, these roads have only seen about 
37 percent of federal highway fund. As Con-
gress debates how to move forward with a 
bold plan to address infrastructure, we need to 
ensure road-repair projects like these do not 
fall by the wayside as we seek to address 
other larger infrastructure projects. Just be-
cause a road is in a rural area does not mean 
the road is small or otherwise unimportant. To 
the contrary, I am aware of several rural road 
projects in my district and the surrounding re-
gion that are major connectors that would ben-
efit from this type of funding opportunity. 
My bill expands the current surface block 
grant program to include these roads—roads 
that serve as a lifeline to the people that de-
pend on them. We must invest in our rural in-
frastructure now, before it is in complete dis-
repair. I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure.

HONORING IOWA’S TEACHERS AS 
IOWANS OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
National Teacher Appreciation Week, I am 
recognizing the incredible educators of Iowa’s 
Third Congressional District as our Iowans of 
the Week. Their daily contributions to our chil-
dren’s lives have perhaps never been more 
evident than during the past couple of months 
while our nation battles the COVID–19 pan-
demic. As distance learning has become the 
new 
norm, 
parents-turned-home-educators 
have developed a whole new appreciation for 
the academic, social, and emotional support 
teachers provide our children. 
It has been remarkable to see educators 
and school staff rise to the challenge of serv-
ing their students in the face of this unprece-
dented crisis. With little time to plan and while 
coping with the pandemic themselves, they 
transitioned lesson plans to fit the constraints 
of distance learning and have worked hard to 
find creative ways to keep students engaged. 
Within the Des Moines Public School district 
alone, teachers have now moved more than 
6,300 Pre-K through 8th grade classes to an 
online learning platform and distributed nearly 
21,000 laptop computers to students across 
grade levels. In districts across central and 
southwest Iowa, teachers have also packed 
countless bags of books, school supplies, 
games, and other supports for students and 
families. And at Thomas Jefferson High 
School in Council Bluffs, teachers are now 
hosting activities like Anime Club meetups via 
Google Hangouts. 
Their efforts extend far beyond traditional 
lesson plans. Teachers were among the first 
to recognize and fill the void of food insecurity 
for many students in their school districts; for 
weeks now, they have stepped up to pack and 
serve tens of thousands of meals weekly for 
students who might otherwise go without. 
They know many students still need a 
wellness check, so educators have donned 
masks and knocked on doors to make sure 
students are safe and secure. And at the end 
of the day, teachers still find the energy to or-
ganize parades through their school districts 
just to put a smile on their students’ faces. 
Their contributions to our community don’t 
end with their students. We even have teach-

Teachers deserve special recognition this

cators are the heart of Iowa’s communities. 
They are thoughtful caretakers and mentors of

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
MR. 
GEORGE 
FLOYD 
AND 
CALLING 
FOR SYSTEMIC LAW ENFORCE-
MENT REFORM AND ACCOUNT-
ABILITY 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mr. George Floyd 
and to call for systemic law enforcement re-
form and accountability in our nation. 
On May 25, 2020, Mr. George Floyd was 
murdered by a Minneapolis Police officer while 
three other officers stood by. This was a hor-
rific crime that demands that the perpetrators 
be held fully accountable by our justice system 
and our society. The shocking video of Mr. 
Floyd’s murder makes us all a witness to the 
brutally cruel and excessive treatment that 
caused Mr. Floyd’s death. Now that the four 
officers involved in this outrageous act have 
been taken into custody and charged, the fam-
ily of Mr. Floyd and our communities deserve 
to see justice done. 
But the tragic death of Mr. Floyd was not an 
isolated incident of the cruel and excessive 
use of force against Black Americans or other 
people of color in police custody. It is only the 
latest example of a systemic problem that has 
plagued every state in this nation for genera-
tions. It is the duty of police and peace officers 
to keep our communities safe, but protecting 
public safety fundamentally demands a re-
spect for the civil rights and human rights of 
all residents. All too often, people of color do 
not get that respect from the police. 
Mr. Floyd should be alive today. He was a 
loving father and a proud older brother who 
looked out for his siblings. His family de-
scribes him as a kind soul and a gentle giant. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his family in 
their time of grief. 
Mr. Floyd’s death was a senseless tragedy 
that should never have happened. What we 
can do now to honor his memory is to finally 
bring accountability to our law enforcement 
practices and ensure that everyone in this na-
tion regardless of the color of their skin is 
treated with dignity and respect. In Congress, 
that means passing the Justice in Policing Act 
of 2020. Madam Speaker, I am proud that the 
House of Representatives is advancing this 
critical reform legislation to a vote on the floor 
so that every Member of Congress has the 
opportunity to say loud and clear—no more.

HONORING THE LIFE AND WORK 
OF MARTIN POHL 
HON. JOSH HARDER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and exceptional 
service of Mr. Martin Pohl. Martin dedicated 
his career to our Central Valley almond indus-
try and his efforts have positively benefitted 
communities and farmers throughout Cali-
fornia. 
Martin was known for many roles within the 
almond industry and will be remembered for 
his strong leadership and passion for the in-
dustry and the people he served. Martin re-
mained active with the Almond Board of Cali-
fornia throughout his career as shown though 
his service on the Board’s Technical and Reg-
ulatory Affairs committee, where he served as 
chairman. Additionally, his contributions to the 
industry’s world-renowned food safety pro-
grams are unparalleled. His guidance and 
care for the almond industry and those who 
worked in it can be seen though his role as a 
mentor for the Almond Board’s Leadership 
program since its inception. In addition to his 
work with the Almond Board, Martin and his 
original founding partners, Ham Cunningham 
and Cleo Barth, developed Hughson Nut Inc. 
in 1985. His skills in engineering and design 
were considered critical to the company’s suc-
cess and reputation as a leader in the indus-
try. 
His exemplary work was recognized in 2013 
when he received the prestigious Almond 
Board of California’s Almond Achievement 
Award and again in 2017 when he was recog-
nized as the Almond Alliance’s Member of the 
Year. Martin was a tremendous individual and 
had the love and respect of his peers in the 
community. His good nature and sincerity 
were infectious and many in the industry will 
tell you that Martin was the person they felt 
comfortable going to for guidance. His warmth 
and willingness to help everyone is an exam-
ple of how Martin was a silent leader and 
strived to make the world a better place. 
I am honored to recognize the life and ex-
ceptional service of Mr. Martin Pohl. It is both 
fitting and appropriate that we honor Martin for 
his countless contributions to the almond in-
dustry and the State of California throughout 
his career.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF LOUISE ENDEL 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to 
Louise Endel, a pillar of the New Haven com-
munity and a dear friend. Though she lived a 
long and fulfilling life, it still feels as though 
she was taken from us much too. soon. Hers 
is a legacy of compassion, philanthropy and 
generosity that will surely continue to serve as 
an inspiration to all those who know her—and 
likely many that did not. 
Louise and her husband, Charlie, moved to 
North Haven with their three daughters in 
1952 and soon became actively involved in 
the community and with a myriad of commu-
nity organizations, including the League of 
Women Voters, the Girl Scouts, and Ridge 
Road School’s Parent Teacher Association. 
Louise and Charlie were also founding mem-
bers of the Ridge Top Club, the first swimming 
club in the area to ‘‘eschew racial and reli-
gious discrimination.’’ Over the course of her 
life, Louise served on fifty-two local, state and 
national boards and was passionately devoted 
to supporting many New Haven non-profits in-
cluding the International Festival of Arts and 
Ideas, the Long Wharf Theatre, the Elm 
Shakespeare Theater, St. Raphael’s Hospital 
Foundation, and L.E.A.P. 
Louise was the epitome of a ‘‘people-per-
son.’’ She intrinsically understood the soul of 
a person—where their passions lay and how 
best they could make a difference. Louise her-
self was one of the most giving people I have 
ever had the good fortune to know. She was 
affectionately known as the ‘‘matchmaker’’— 
not because she matched people for love, but 
because she could match people to the best 
ways in which they could contribute to the 
community. Louise connected people with 
complimenting talents, ensuring the success of 
countless organizations and events. In a word, 
she was remarkable. 
I myself benefitted from her unique talents. 
Louise was one of the first people to approach 
and encourage me to run for Congress. I re-
member her coming to me and asking if I 
would ever consider running, and when I re-
plied that I was, she said, ‘‘let me introduce 
you to . . .’’ and the rest, as they say, is his-
tory. I, like so many others, consider myself 
fortunate to have called her my friend. 
Louise was an extraordinary woman whose 
kind heart and generosity touched the lives of 
many. A devoted mother, grandmother, and 
great-grandmother, Louise is survived by her 
three daughters, Susan, Barbara, and Patricia; 
six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. 
To them, I extend my deepest sympathies and 
hope that they know what an enormous im-
pact Louise had on all those who knew her. 
Hers is a legacy that will continue to inspire 
generations to come.

Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr.

Madam 
Speaker,

Figueroa is an award winning leader in social 
services and a proud Trans Latina American 
Woman. Among her chosen advocacy roles, 
Ashley is the Founder and Executive Director 
of the Gender Advancement Project (GAP)

HONORING THE FAMILY LEGACY 
OF MCCLARD’S BAR-B-Q 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the near-century-old legacy of 
McClard’ s Bar-B-Q in Hot Springs, Arkansas. 
Founded by Gladys and Alex McClard in 
1928, the fourth generation of the McClard 
family, represented by owners Scott and 
Shannon McClard, keeps its doors open 
today. 
In the last century, McClard’s has been a 
cultural icon of the Hot Springs area, gathering 
long lines of customers outside its doors on 
Albert Pike Road. Known for barbecue pork, 
ribs, tamales, and infamous barbecue sauce, 
the barbecue joint is a local favorite, even 
noted to be a favorite of President Bill Clin-
ton’s during his upbringing in Hot Springs. 
The restaurant’s leadership recently made 
the decision to sell the family-owned spot fol-
lowing a brief closing during the COVID–19 
pandemic. While it has reopened this week 
under new ownership, the McClard family is 
still actively involved in the restaurant’s 
progress in the community. 
Not only does McClard’s Bar-B-Q boast of 
some of the best cooking in the Southwest Ar-
kansas area, but the restaurant holds 92 years 
of Arkansas culture, history, and memories. 
Theirs is a story of the American dream, and 
I look forward to seeing this place continue to 
be a place of joy for Fourth District residents, 
just as it has for nearly a century. I take this 
time to thank all generations of the McClard 
family for their years of hard work and their 
diligence in creating the most loved of Hot 
Springs traditions.

HONORING SUPERINTENDENT 
MARTHA MARTINEZ 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA

Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Salinas City Elementary 
School District Superintendent, Martha Mar-
tinez, on her retirement after serving the state 
of California as a public educator since 1975. 
An outstanding citizen and educator, Super-
intendent Martinez has made an unparalleled 
impact in the educational community of the 
central coast of California and our entire state 
through 45 years of service. 
Superintendent Martinez’s began her career 
as a paraprofessional in California’s Bay Area 
before later becoming an elementary teacher. 
After 20 years as an educator, she put her ex-
pertise towards work as a school administrator 
with the Santa Clara County Office of Edu-
cation and Gilroy Unified School District. 
In 2015, she became Superintendent of the 
Salinas City Elementary School District. In this 
role, she has distinguished herself as a pas-
sionate advocate for providing all students, re-
gardless of background, with a quality edu-
cation that provides equitable opportunities for 
all learners. As a visionary leader, Super-
intendent Martinez not only holds students and 
educators to high expectations, but also pro-
vides her own endless support so that all 
goals can be attainable. 
Superintendent Martinez has also built 
strong support for her district in the local com-
munity. She has launched a citywide literacy 
campaign in Salinas to provide over 160,000 
residents with a free Early Literacy App and 
mobilized leaders across Monterey County to 
work to end bullying. With her robust back-
ground in building local and regional partner-
ships, Superintendent Martinez was selected 
to organize Salinas Founder’s Day, to cele-
brate the city’s 150th birthday, and the Salinas 
City Elementary School District’s Sesqui-
centennial Commemoration. With these two 
events, Superintendent Martinez brought indi-
viduals from all backgrounds in our community 
together to celebrate the City of Salinas and 
its outstanding students. Recognizing the sup-
port of the community around her, Super-
intendent Martinez is well-known to distinguish 
the stellar efforts of those she works with at 
every possible opportunity.

HONORING ANGUS L. BRADSHAW 
AS A DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN 
CENTRAL FLORIDA FOR PRIDE 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Angus L. Brad-
shaw is a thriving nonprofit leader serving 
Central Florida. A native of Central Florida, 
Mr. Bradshaw graduated with a bachelor’s de-
gree in Business Administration at Florida Ag-
riculture & Mechanical University (FAMU) with 
the help of several scholarships. He began his 
love for community-oriented care after sur-
viving childhood cancer himself. This experi-
ence led Mr. Bradshaw to involve himself in 
his community through routine volunteerism 
and philanthropy at the young age of 14. 
Mr. Bradshaw has been supporting the mis-
sion of Miracle of Love, Inc. an HIV service or-
ganization in Orlando, FL. since 2002. He be-
came its Executive Director in 2016 and is 
known for his constant smile and fun-loving, 
compassionate demeanor. A revered leader in 
the organization and in the community, Mr. 
Bradshaw is equally known for his fierce focus 
on making the mission. He believes it is inte-
gral to do so with each employee and each 
client’s self-respect, dignity, and morale intact. 
Mr. Bradshaw is aware that passion is not al-
ways enough, and he continually places him-
self in the position of a student; learning and 
applying those lessons to improve services 
and outcomes for those under his leadership. 
For this, he is valued by each of his team 
members and is seen as a community cham-
pion with upstanding repute. This has also 
given him expertise in many other areas; in-
cluding social services, housing, and fund-
raising. 
Angus serves on multiple municipal commit-
tees in the Orlando Metropolitan area. These 
include Vice-Chair of the Membership Com-
mittee for Ryan White Part A—Orlando EMA

HONORING DR. ROY WEAVER 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the work of Dr. Roy Weaver, dean of 
Ball State University’s Teachers College and a 
pillar of Indiana’s education community. Dr. 
Weaver has been a fixture at Ball State Uni-
versity in Muncie, Indiana for nearly 40 years 
as a faculty member, associate dean, and 
dean of Teachers College, and is retiring on 
June 30. 
Dr. Weaver is a Hoosier in the best sense 
of the word, spending most of his career in the 
Muncie area. He is a two-time graduate from 
Ball State University, earning his bachelor’s 
degree in English in 1968 and his master’s de-
gree in curriculum and instruction in 1971. He 
was a classroom teacher at Muncie Central 
High School where he taught Language Arts 
and coached the tennis, speech, and debate 
teams. Dr. Weaver earned his Ed.D. from Indi-
ana University in 1975 and worked at the Uni-
versity of Southern California for five years. In 
1980, he returned to his alma mater, and 
served with distinction as associate professor 
of curriculum, professor of curriculum, asso-
ciate dean, and spent 19 years over two tours 
of duty as dean of Teachers College. 
During his career, Dr. Weaver has been a 
staunch supporter of education innovation and 
educational choice. At Ball State University, he 
managed the operation of the award-winning 
laboratory school, Muncie Burris. He assisted 
in the creation of one of the nation’s finest 
high 
schools, 
the 
Indiana 
Academy 
for 
Science, Mathematics, and Humanities, which 
serves gifted and talented high school juniors 
and seniors. He oversaw the creation of Ball 
State University’s Office of Charter Schools, 
becoming Indiana’s only public university to 
authorize charter schools. 
As a testament to his outstanding career, 
Dr. Weaver was awarded Ball State Univer-
sity’s 
Outstanding 
Administrative 
Service 
Award and recognized by the National Asso-
ciation for Gifted Children with its Educator of 
the Year award. He is also a respected schol-
ar and the author of six books on a variety of 
education topics. 
Dr. Weaver has been a tremendous positive 
force for education in Indiana, and in the na-
tion. He will be missed by his friends and col-
leagues at Ball State University, but his retire-
ment is well-earned. On behalf of Hoosiers in 
Indiana’s 6th District, I congratulate Dr. Wea-
ver and thank him for his many contributions 
to our great state.

HONORING GAIL ORCUTT AS THE 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in honoring the late Gail Orcutt of Pleasant 
Hill, Iowa as Iowan of the Week. 
A lifelong Iowan, Gail worked as a teacher 
for more than three decades before retiring in 
2008. Two years later, after experiencing what 
she thought was a case of spring allergies, 
Gail was diagnosed with lung cancer: a big 
surprise for someone who had never smoked. 
Upon discovering her illness was caused by 
radon, she embarked on a years-long effort to 
educate herself and others on the dangers of 
radon exposure and importance of mitigation, 
all while battling lung cancer as a chronic ill-
ness and using her experiences to inspire 
hope in others fighting cancer. 
During my first year in Congress, my team 
and I had the pleasure of working with Gail on 
multiple occasions to raise awareness of im-
portant issues in health care. She lent her 
voice to roundtable discussions on affordability 
of prescription drugs and accessibility to qual-
ity care, and her powerful, personal story al-
ways made an impact on everyone present. 
She was a frequent contributor to community 
discussions held by organizations like AARP 
Iowa and American Cancer Society Cancer 
Action Network, all with an aim of educating 
others. She spent time passionately advo-
cating to state legislators and lawmakers in 
Washington for policies that would better in-
form the public about radon and mandate 
radon testing in schools. She still found time 
to volunteer for organizations like Free to 
Breathe and participate in the American Lung 
Association’s Fight for Air Climb—Des Moines, 
climbing the stairs of multiple downtown build-
ings post-treatment with one lung. Suffice it to 
say, she was a unique force for positive 
change. 
I would be remiss if I did not take this op-
portunity to follow in Gail’s footsteps and edu-
cate Iowans about radon testing and mitiga-
tion. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive 
gas; you cannot see, smell, or taste it, but it 
may be present in your home or school build-
ing. While harmless in small amounts, breath-
ing in elevated levels of radon can lead to se-
rious illness. Radon is the second-leading 
cause of lung cancer, and we lose hundreds 
of Iowans every year to this illness. Five out 
of every seven homes in Iowa have an unac-
ceptable level of radon, and it is rec-
ommended homeowners test their homes for 
radon every two years. The Iowa Radon Hot-
line at 1–800–383–5992 is a valuable re-
source to not only get answers to your ques-
tions, but also to order a testing kit to keep 
you and your family safe. 
I admire Gail’s courage, grace, and grit in 
the face of unimaginable challenge. Her leg-
acy of teaching, advocating, and giving hope 
to those battling cancer is a beautiful example 
of Iowan values: persevering through difficult 
times, bettering the lives of those around you 
through hard work and dedication, and leaving 
something meaningful behind for future gen-
erations. Her work made a difference. I extend 
my sincere condolences to her loved ones 
during this difficult time and am keeping them 
in my prayers. Iowa is a better place because 
of neighbors like Gail Orcutt, and I am proud 
to honor her as Iowan of the Week.

AS 
A 
DISTINGUISHED

FOR CARIBBEAN AMERICAN HER-
ITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. 
SOTO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Guenet 
Gittens-Roberts is CEO of GGR Marketing & 
Public Relations, a company which currently 
markets and/or produces some of the largest 
Caribbean Festivals in Orlando including the 
Caribbean Fusion Festival in Kissimmee, the 
Orlando Carnival Downtown, and the Carib-
bean American Heritage Month Festival. She 
is responsible for developing and directing 
their communication strategy while also man-
aging the agency’s outreach to the advertising, 
charitable, and business communities. GGR 
Marketing & Public Relations was formed to 
develop and execute programs aimed at 
reaching multicultural communities and niche 
markets utilizing an effective mixture of rela-
tionship marketing, event marketing, and 
branding through social media and traditional 
media sources. They offer a broad range of 
services that include marketing, public rela-
tions, branding, special event planning and 
management, sponsorship and fundraising, 
business development, and media relations. 
Gittens-Roberts is also the publisher of Car-
ibbean American Passport News Magazine, 
the largest and only Caribbean owned State-
wide Newspaper in Florida. Caribbean Amer-
ican Passport is heading into its 10th year in 
September and covers the people of the 
English, French and Spanish communities in 
Florida. Through their publishing arm, they

nity to vote in the 2016 election. 
As an active member of the community, 
Gittens-Roberts serves as President of the 
Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce. 
She also served as the vice president of the 
Central Florida Association of Black Journal-
ists and vice president of the Guyanese Amer-
ican Cultural Association of Central Florida in

Orlando Cares and United Foundation of Cen-
tral Florida, two organizations focused on 
youth mentoring programs.

RECOGNIZING CINDY O’BOYLE 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Cindy O’Boyle of Kalispell for 
encouraging, 
empowering, 
and 
uplifting 
women throughout Montana through the Mon-
tana Woman Foundation (MWF). Sixteen 
years ago, Cindy founded MWF and serves as 
its executive director. The 50I(c)(3) nonprofit 
organization’s mission is to help all Montana 
women reach their full potential through 
mentorship, workshops, and scholarships the 
group provides. 
Cindy says she knows how important it is 
for women to support women. The group’s 
board believes women are stronger together 
and that programs that help women overcome 
challenges will ultimately benefit them and 
their communities. 
Each year, MWF generally awards scholar-
ships to women ‘‘who are generally non-tradi-
tional students or women who are under-
served, underprivileged or have dealt with a 
variety of struggles including but not limited to 
homelessness or poverty, health issues, learn-
ing disabilities, domestic-violence, foster care, 
single- or teen motherhood.’’ 
Any Montana woman, regardless of age or 
social, economic, or cultural differences, may 
apply for the scholarship or participate in edu-
cational workshops or mentorship program. 
The goal is always the same: empower 
women to overcome obstacles, improve them-
selves, and better their community. 
One specific example of success, which is 
near and dear to Cindy’s heart, is a woman 
MWF helped during its first five years. The 
woman in her early 60s was married, and her 
husband worked and provided for them. Unfor-
tunately, he had a stroke that forced him to 
end his career. The couple were not situated 
for retirement, and she faced the challenge of 
finding a good-paying job. To earn what the 
couple needed, she needed to go back to 
school. MWF paid for her to get the education 
she needed, she became an office assistant, 
and she began providing for the family. Cindy 
says it’s scary to be put in that situation, but 
the woman’s grit and determination brought 
her success. 
This week, the foundation, which received 
over 250 applications for its 2020 scholar-
ships, will announce the recipients. While 
MWF usually awards four annual scholarships, 
it will provide seven scholarships this year to 
Montana women across our state. 
Madam Speaker, for nurturing and encour-
aging Montana women, helping change their 
lives, and supporting them in their success, I 
recognize Cindy O’Boyle of Kalispell for her 
Spirit of Montana.

CHUCK NEWSOM 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend the Brigantine, 
New Jersey resident Chuck Newsom, Timber 
Creek High School Educator of the Year 2020. 
This year we honor Chuck Newsom, a dedi-
cated educator at Timber Creek Regional High 
School, on his receipt of the 2020 Timber 
Creek Regional High School Educator of the 
Year award. In addition to his role as a special 
education teacher, he serves as football 
coach, basketball coach, head coach of the 
girls’ volleyball team and is a role model for all 
his students. 
Prior to his career of being a special edu-
cation teacher at Timber Creek Regional High 
School, Newsom pursued a degree in law and 
justice at Glassboro State College. He grad-
uated in 1980 with career aspirations of going 
into law enforcement but changed course 
when he received a job offer as a Union Iron-
worker. After 10 years in the profession, 
Chuck decided to go back to school and earn 
a teaching certificate from Rowan University. 
He began his career as a special education 
teacher at Camden and Pennsauken High 
Schools, where he also served as Assistant 
Coach for a myriad of different sports teams. 
After teaching for 13 years for Camden and 
Pennsauken High Schools, he later moved to 
Timber Creek Regional High School where he 
continued to teach students for an additional 
13 years. 
After more than a decade of inspiring, 
coaching, and shaping the lives of the stu-
dents who attend Timber Creek Regional High 
School, Chuck is recognized as the Educator 
of the Year. He is beloved amongst his advi-
sors, his pupils, and his teams. The connec-
tions he makes, along with his ability to inspire 
and engage, with all students allows him to 
excel in his position as a special education 
teacher. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Chuck Newsom, of Brigantine, New 
Jersey, a dedicated public-school educator 
who continues to inspire hundreds of students 
throughout all of South Jersey.

HONORING LLOYD PHILLIPS AS A 
DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN CEN-
TRAL FLORIDA FOR CARIBBEAN 
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Lloyd Phillips 
was born in Guyana and relocated to the 
United States with his parents and siblings in 
1969. He completed his high school education 
in Brooklyn, New York where his quest for 
higher learning led him to enroll at Brooklyn 
College. He attained a bachelor’s degree in 
Economics and then went to Long Island Uni-
versity where he graduated with an MBA in Fi-
nance. 
Lloyd worked at Barclays Bank before being 
hired at the number one investment banking 
firm, Goldman Sachs & Company, where he 
worked in the Special Accounts Department. 
Lloyd subsequently worked his way up to Su-
pervising Manager of the Special Accounts 
Trading Desk. 
Lloyd’s career at Goldman Sachs ended 
during an economic downturn and decided to 
embark on a career change, joining the ranks 
of the Uniformed Services in New York City. 
He rose to the rank of Captain before taking 
an early retirement. 
With a young but growing family, Lloyd and 
his wife Delilah decided to relocate to Florida, 
so that their children can live in an environ-
ment better suited to their needs. The family 
settled in Kissimmee, where Lloyd is currently 
President of the Caribbean and Floridian As-
sociation. He was also the President of the 
Commonwealth Alliance Association, Vice- 
President of the Guyanese-American Cultural 
Association, President of the Guyanese-Amer-
ican Diaspora United, and Vice-President of 
the Strafford Park Home-Owners Association. 
He was also appointed as an Educational Re-
source Ambassador by the University of Guy-
ana, awarded a Certificate of Special Con-
gressional Recognition, presented by Con-
gressman HAKEEM JEFFRIES for his work with 
the Guyanese Cultural Association of New

HONORING AUBRI ESTERS 
HON. AYANNA PRESSLEY 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to ask the House of Representatives to 
join me in honoring and celebrating the life of 
Ms. Aubri Esters, an outspoken and beloved 
activist. 
Aubri was a voice for the unheard. She was 
unabashed in sharing her story and her lived 
experiences to advocate for the wellbeing of 
those most marginalized, including other 
transgender individuals, people with disabil-
ities, people with substance use disorders, 
and trauma survivors. 
In addition to serving on the Commonwealth 
of Massachusetts’ Harm Reduction Commis-
sion, Aubri co-founded the organization SIFMA 
Now!, a coalition dedicated to building public 
support for supervised consumption sites and 
other 
life-saving 
harm 
reduction 
efforts. 
Whether on the ground working directly with 
impacted communities or in the Massachu-
setts State House advocating for progressive 
health policies that center those most vulner-
able, Aubri was committed to saving lives. 
On Thursday, June 11th, our community lost 
a true activist leader, table shaker and accom-
plice in the fight for health care justice. Aubri 
will be missed dearly, but her legacy lives on 
in the policy she helped to create, in the 
hearts of her fellow activists, and in the minds 
of policy makers who she engaged and en-
lightened. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing the life 
of Aubri Esters and her contributions to the 
Massachusetts 7th Congressional District. We 
remember Aubri with tremendous gratitude for 
her life-saving advocacy. May she forever rest 
in power.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF THERESA CARRANO ARGENTO 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
the heaviest of hearts that I rise today to pay 
tribute to the life and legacy of one of the pil-
lars of New Haven’s Italian-American commu-
nity and my dear friend, Theresa Carrano 
Argento. She lived a long, full life and our 
community will not be the same without her. 
One of six children, Theresa grew up in the 
Wooster Square neighborhood of New Haven. 
Her father owned a ‘‘specialty market,’’ selling 
imported fruit from California—pears, oranges, 
and cherries, all individually wrapped in color- 
coded paper. Her mother was an immigrant 
from Italy. When the stock market crashed, 
her father nearly lost the store. Instead of fold-
ing as so many others had, her father found 
work, as did she and her siblings, and her 
mother was left to run the family business. It 
was from these early life lessons that Theresa 
learned the true strength of family and com-
munity. 
Theresa dedicated most of her adult life to 
preserving and celebrating the community and 
its members’ shared Italian heritage. She was 
a founding member of the Saint Andrew’s La-
dies Auxiliary, the women’s branch of one of 
New Haven’s Italian-American Societies and 
an organization she led for decades before 
stepping down only a few short years ago. 
She was also a dedicated communicant of St. 
Michael’s Church, Connecticut’s oldest Italian 
church, organizing and supporting fundraisers 
and even serving as its bookkeeper for a time. 
She worked to revive the Columbus Day cele-
bration in New Haven and was a constant 
presence at Wooster Square’s annual Cherry 
Blossom Festival. She was a member, and 
often served in the leadership, of most of the 
Italian-American clubs and organizations in the 
community. Theresa understood the impor-
tance of preserving and sharing that culture 
and those traditions with new generations. 
She was, in a word, remarkable. 
Theresa was a matriarch in the Wooster 
Square community, much like my own mother, 
Luisa. They were, in fact, great friends and it 
was a friendship that remained strong until my 
mother’s passing just two years ago. Both 
Theresa and my mother were forces of nature 
in their own rights, and when they got to-
gether, there was no stopping them. It was at 
their feet that I learned the importance of com-
munity and it is on their shoulders that I stand 
today. I would not be who I am today without 
their influence so I will be forever grateful for 
their guidance and support. 
Theresa was an extraordinary friend, men-
tor, and community leader. I like so many oth-
ers consider myself fortunate to have known 
her. She was so much more than a friend— 
she was family. I am heartbroken at her loss, 
but I know her memory will live on. I extend 
my deepest sympathies to Theresa’s daugh-
ters, Nettie and Francis, as well as her four 
grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. 
Throughout her life, she touched the lives of 
many and hers is a legacy that will continue 
to inspire both those who knew her and gen-
erations to come.

HONORING TOMMI PRITCHETT AS 
A 
DISTINGUISHED 
LEADER 
IN 
CENTRAL FLORIDA FOR PRIDE 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. 
SOTO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Tommi 
Pritchett currently serves as the Director of 
Development and Kissimmee Program Man-
ager for LGBT+ Center Orlando, Incorporated. 
She is a native of Central Florida, earned her 
Bachelor of Arts in English at Rollins College, 
and has received several certificates from the 
Edyth Bush Institute for Philanthropy and Non-
profit Leadership. 
Her journey in public service began in 2010 
when she volunteered for a local non-profit or-
ganization’s booth at the Gay Days Expo. She 
continued as a volunteer with Paws Care for 
two years as their marketing and events coor-
dinator; to which she attributes her love of 
event planning and fundraising. She went on 
to volunteer and then work for Orlando Fringe, 
the longest running Fringe festival in the 
United States, and transitioned to the LGBT+ 
Center in August 2018. 
In addition to animals and the LGBTQ+ 
community, Tommi advocates for the arts, 
women, and BIPOC, among other under-
served and underprivileged communities. She 
is a member of the Association of Fundraising 
Professionals Central Florida Chapter and 
serves 
on 
the 
board 
of 
directors 
for 
LoveyLoaves Special Needs Rescue and 
Sanctuary. She is honored to be recognized 
as an LGBTQ+ Community Leader in Central 
Florida and is proud to serve such a diverse 
and deserving community. She owes much of 
her success to the mentors she has had along 
her professional journey, as well as the staff, 
board, and volunteers at The Center, her fam-
ily and friends, and the great community lead-
ers she feels privileged to work alongside. 
When she is not busy with her leadership and 
advocacy responsibilities, she enjoys spending 
time with her family, dogs, and recently dis-
covered a passion for hydroponic gardening.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SAINT 
PAUL PUBLIC SCHOOLS BOARD 
CHAIR MARNY XIONG 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the life of Ms. Marny Xiong, 
Chairwoman of the Saint Paul Public Schools 
Board of Education who passed away from 
COVID–19 at the age of 31 on Sunday, June 
7, 2020. Ms. Xiong was a trailblazing young 
activist, community leader, and a dedicated 
advocate for young people and strong public 
schools. Gender equity and racial justice were 
the core values that defined her public service. 
After receiving her bachelor’s degree in po-
litical science and African and African-Amer-
ican studies, Ms. Xiong began working in the 
local nonprofit community. In 2017 she was 
elected to the Saint Paul Public Schools Board 
of Education, demonstrating strong advocacy 
to improve our public schools. She played an 
important role in building support necessary to 
pass a bond referendum in 2018 that directed 
needed additional needed funding to Saint 
Paul schools. 
When Ms. Xiong became Chairwoman of 
the Board in January of this year, her leader-
ship abilities became evident as she con-
fronted dual crises of the district’s first ever 
teachers’ strike and the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Ms. Xiong worked respectfully and collabo-
ratively with Superintendent Joe Gothard and 
labor leaders to reach a successful resolution 
to the strike in early March. Only a short time 
later, in response to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
she helped to steer the district’s unprece-
dented transition to distance learning for more 
than 37,000 students. It is heartbreaking that 
this pandemic has now taken one of our com-
munity’s rising leaders. 
Ms. Xiong is survived by her parents, Mr. 
Zahoua Xiong and See Xiong, and her seven 
siblings: two sisters and five brothers, as well 
as two brothers-in-law, a sister-in-law, four 
nieces and nephews. Marny will be remem-
bered as a caring community organizer, a

HONORING IOWA LAW ENFORCE-
MENT AS IOWANS OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, National Po-
lice Week is a time for Iowans and people 
across the U.S. to celebrate local law enforce-
ment officers who serve and protect our com-
munities, and to honor the fallen heroes who 
lost their lives in the line of duty. These brave 
men and women in uniform have dedicated 
their lives to essential public service, and 
some have given the ultimate sacrifice. The 
COVID–19 pandemic may delay public cere-
monies to recognize these individuals, but we 
can still take time this week to remember 
those we have lost, share our support for their 
loved ones, and thank those who continue to 
serve. 
Law enforcement officers do far more than 
safeguard our lives and property. Today, com-
munity policing involves officers working in 
partnership with organizations and neighbor-
hoods to create safer spaces. Not only are po-
lice responding to calls for help and providing 
support on the street, they’re also in our 
schools teaching kids how to make good 
choices so they can continue on a path toward 
success. There is no shortage of stories of of-
ficers from my district going above and be-
yond on the job. 
In late March as the community closed up 
shop to slow the spread of COVID–19, the 
Creston Police Department covered its front 
doors and windows in a display of colorful 
paper hearts as a symbol of hope for Iowans 
during this trying time. 
Earlier this month Des Moines Police Sgt. 
Paul Parizek spent National Teacher Appre-
ciation Week visiting multiple educators and 
school support staff at home and at work to 
thank them for their service to our kids. During 
the same stretch of time, Sgt. Andrew Phipps 
from Des Moines PD visited 90-year-old Earl, 
a fellow veteran, on his birthday to share in 
the socially distanced celebration. 
Waukee Police Department’s Sgt. Hector 
Arias and Officer Gilchrist have been lending 
a helping hand passing out free Waukee Com-
munity School District Grab & Go Meals and 
devices to help students participate in virtual 
learning from home. 
Just before schools moved to distance 
learning this spring, Council Bluffs Police Chief 
Tim Carmody visited Mrs. Nickerson’s class of 
first graders at Rue Elementary School to par-
ticipate in the Read Across America Program. 
Having recently welcomed Officer Deana Roth 
and Officer Meghan Thomson to the force, 
Chief Carmody is now leading his team in im-
portant efforts like educating the public on how 
to identify and avoid door-to-door sales scams 
during the Coronavirus outbreak. 
Our police officers’ contributions to our com-
munity don’t end at handing out meals and 
spending time in the classroom. Faced with 
the additional health risks presented by this 
pandemic, our police officers continue to ex-
hibit honor and bravery by serving their neigh-
bors. They go to work knowing they could 
come face-to-face with Coronavirus, and that it 
is only one of the challenges they encounter 
while on duty. Because of their dedication and 
sacrifice, it is my pleasure to honor members 
of central and southwest Iowa’s law enforce-
ment community by nominating them as our 
Iowans of the Week.

HONORING JUAN RODRIGUEZ AS A 
DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN CEN-
TRAL 
FLORIDA 
FOR 
PRIDE 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 18, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Juan has in-
vested 19 years working in the HIV arena. In 
2001, he promised his partner, who was dying 
from AIDS, that he would devote his life to 
helping individuals infected with HIV and to 
eradicating the disease. 
In 2016, under the guidance and direction of 
Dr. Roberto Ortiz, Juan started Bliss CARES, 
a nonprofit organization in Orlando. The mis-
sion of Bliss CARES is to save lives by treat-
ing and preventing the spread of HIV, Hepa-
titis and STD’s. They strive to serve every per-
son who walks through their doors, regardless 
of ability to pay. Bliss CARES has provided 
FREE HIV, STD and Hepatitis testing and 
services to more than 1987 clients and has 
spent over $1.8 million on their much-needed 
medical care. 
While leading a caring, and results driven 
team, Juan has created 5 lifesaving programs 
for Central Florida. These include: 
TRANSformation, a 7-part conversational 
educational program to assist the Transgender 
community and sponsors name changes for 
transgender persons interested in the process; 
Sweet Dreams Emergency Housing, an in-
novative program created to help Transgender 
individuals have a safe place to sleep that in-
cludes services for mental health counseling 
and substance abuse; 
the Bliss Health Insurance Subsidy Pro-
gram, which grants lifesaving medical care to 
STD positive individuals without insurance and 
the Bridge Program, which provides access 
to medical care, treatment, mental health, lab-
oratory tests, vaccines, transportation, and 
grants copay assistance for medications and 
doctor’s visits. The program was designed to 
provide comprehensive medical care to the 
uninsured and underinsured populations who 
have a STD or need preventive care. 
Last, but not least, Juan’s nonprofit grants 
free access to the PrEP and PEP-Program, 
one designed to provide immediate care for all 
individuals who believe they may have been 
exposed to the HIV virus. This program pre-
vents HIV from entering the blood stream, 
thus reducing HIV cases in Central Florida.
