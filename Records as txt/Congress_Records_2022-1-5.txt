RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as 
2022 gets underway, working Americans 
and their families are facing a steady 
stream of significant challenges: the 
fastest growing inflation in almost 40 
years; violent crime rates continue to 
rise, with many of our largest cities 
setting new alltime records for mur-
ders; a southern border that remains in 
crisis; a new highly contagious variant 
of the virus that President Biden prom-
ised he would personally crush; too few 
tests and too slow new treatments on 
this administration’s watch; and an-
other rolling wave of school shutdowns, 
as Big Labor bosses continue to make 
hostages out of children’s futures over 
a virus that leaves children largely— 
largely—unharmed. 
Late last year, one poll asked Ameri-
cans about the most important prob-
lems facing the country. Some were 
most worried about the high cost of 
living. Others said, not surprisingly, 
the pandemic. One-fifth of respondents, 
the most by far, said the biggest issue 
was poor leadership—at a time when 
the Democratic Party controls the en-
tire government. 
But do you know what wasn’t on the 
list of concerns? It wasn’t there at all— 
the fictional, scary stories the liberal 
activists keep repeating about how de-
mocracy is at death’s door. The No-
vember 2020 election had the highest 
turnout in 120 years. Ninety-four per-
cent of voters said voting was easy. 
Only 33 percent of Americans say it is 
currently too hard for eligible voters to 
vote. And a larger number than that 
actually say current laws are too 
loose—too loose. 
The American people are not buying 
this nonsensical talk of ‘‘Jim Crow 2.0’’ 
or a voting rights crisis. Everybody, 
apart from leftwing activists and the 
press, understands this emperor has no 
clothes at all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S28 
January 5, 2022 
A few months ago, even voters in 
blue New York rejected multiple ballot 
measures to soften up election laws the 
way liberal activists prefer. This fake 
outrage is just a predicate for Wash-
ington Democrats to do something 
they have sought to do literally for 
years: appoint themselves a nationwide 
board of elections on steroids. 
This is the takeover that Democrats 
have sought for multiple years, using 
multiple different justifications. It is 
not a voting rights bill. It is a sprawl-
ing, sweeping takeover of our democ-
racy. Our colleagues’ bill would do 
things like forcing all 50 States—all of 
them—to legalize corrupt ballot har-
vesting. They would have the govern-
ment send public funds directly to po-
litical campaigns. 
The same Attorney General who has 
frivolously sued Texas just to placate 
the White House, whose Department of 
Justice tries to intimidate parents, 
would be handed new power to micro-
manage election law. 
Some early drafts of this bill tried to 
literally, openly turn the Federal Elec-
tion Commission into an outright par-
tisan body. Talk about tipping your 
hand. 
These changes wouldn’t bolster faith 
in our democracy or in our institu-
tions. It would do exactly the opposite. 
It would be a civic wrecking ball. And, 
listen, that is before you consider that 
Senate Democrats want to destroy our 
own institution to ram this through. 
The current Senate Democratic lead-
er once said that nuking filibuster 
rules would be a ‘‘doomsday for democ-
racy.’’ Just a few years ago, more than 
30 Senate Democrats joined a bipar-
tisan letter supporting the legislative 
filibuster. 
President Biden defended the prin-
ciple 
in 
long, 
passionate 
speeches 
throughout his entire career. Just last 
year, as President, he repeated that de-
stroying the filibuster would ‘‘throw 
the entire Congress into chaos.’’ He 
certainly was right about that. 
There is no partial or limited nuclear 
option on the table. As the Senator for 
West Virginia put it yesterday, when-
ever you start talking about carving 
things out, you end up eating the en-
tire turkey. 
No party that would trash the Sen-
ate’s 
legislative 
traditions 
can 
be 
trusted to seize control over election 
laws all across America. Nobody who is 
this desperate to take over our democ-
racy on a one-party basis can be al-
lowed to do it. 
Finally, it is beyond distasteful for 
some of our colleagues to ham-fistedly 
invoke the January 6 anniversary to 
advance these aims. Washington Demo-
crats have been trying to seize control 
over elections for years. Their first 
draft of the legislation at hand was in-
troduced in January of 2019. The fact 
that violent criminals broke the law 
does not entitle Senate Democrats to 
break the Senate. 
It is surreal to hear sitting Senators 
invoke January the 6th to justify—lis-
ten to this—to justify breaking rules to 
grab outcomes they have not earned. 
I am going to say that again. It is 
surreal to hear sitting Senators invoke 
January the 6th to justify breaking the 
rules to grab outcomes they have not 
earned. 
It is surreal to hear sitting Senators 
invoke January the 6th to argue that 
institutions can be trampled because 
they would like a different result. 
A year ago, the Senate didn’t bend 
and it didn’t break. We held strong. It 
is jaw-dropping for colleagues to pro-
pose to commemorate that by breaking 
the Senate themselves in a different 
way. 
A year ago, there was a lot of talk on 
this floor about protecting the norms 
and institutions of our democracy by 
putting long-term bipartisan traditions 
ahead of short-term partisan power. 
Someday soon, it appears, we may 
learn which of us, actually, really 
meant it. 
FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. President, now, on another mat-
ter, over the holidays, Russian Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin’s insatiable and 
unreasonable demands only grew. So 
did Russia’s threat to Ukraine, Europe, 
NATO, and our own interests. Putin 
cannot be allowed to use force or the 
threat 
of 
force 
to 
further 
erode 
Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The 
West cannot be bullied into betraying 
our friends, forgetting our principles, 
or accepting a Russian sphere of influ-
ence. 
Freedom’s friends will either stand 
up to the bully while we have a chance 
or we will rue the day we did not, 
whether in Europe, Asia, or elsewhere. 
If Putin walks away from this self-cre-
ated crisis feeling emboldened, he and 
others will run the same play again 
and again and again. 
It is appropriate for the administra-
tion and our allies to seek to deesca-
late the situation, but not at the ex-
pense of deterrence and not by throw-
ing our friends’ security under the bus. 
And if we don’t make sure our allies 
and partners have a seat at the table, 
they may well end up on the menu. For 
Putin, this is not just about Ukraine. 
This is about breaking NATO and Eu-
rope and restoring Russian domination 
of its neighbors. 
I support President Biden’s stated de-
sire to deter further Russian aggres-
sion against Ukraine. But—but—his ad-
ministration must move faster to pro-
vide emergency military capabilities to 
help Ukraine defend themselves and 
deter attacks. 
Time is of the essence. Moving at the 
speed of bureaucracy is simply not 
going to cut it. Neither will waiting 
until Russia escalates, at which point, 
of course, it would be too late. Because 
this is not merely about Ukraine, 
President Biden must also work with 
NATO allies to reinforce our collective 
military position on the continent. 
We have to reassure our eastern 
flank NATO allies and deter any 
threats 
to 
the 
alliance 
by 
dem-
onstrating that 30 nations are both 
willing and able to uphold article 5. 
The Russians have to believe that. 
The President, with bipartisan sup-
port, has threatened sanctions against 
Russia. European allies must show that 
they, too, will impose significant sanc-
tions on Moscow for any additional ag-
gression against Ukraine. 
Even if this crisis abates, the long- 
term threat from revisionist powers 
like Russia and China isn’t going any-
where. These countries literally want 
to redraw world maps and rewrite 
international rules through force or 
the threat of force. So this is why the 
United States must be as serious about 
modernizing our military as our adver-
saries are about modernizing theirs. 
While the Biden administration talks 
a good game about competing with 
China, their first budget proposed to 
cut defense spending in real terms, es-
pecially significant given their run-
away inflation. We cannot shirk on in-
vesting in our military. 
And our friends and allies must also 
pull their weight. NATO’s 2 percent 
pledge from 2014 is not sufficient for 
the threat we face in 2022. But key 
NATO partners have still not met even 
that commitment. 
Europe must also reassess energy and 
environmental policies that have pur-
chased a green veneer at the expense of 
more dependence on Russia and more 
leverage for Moscow. This should begin 
with abandoning the Nord Stream 2 
pipeline. The United States, NATO, and 
all our partners can either act now or, 
believe me, we will live to regret it. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
ANNIVERSARY OF JANUARY 6 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, ear-
lier this morning, I had the oppor-
tunity to join my colleagues in the 
Senate Rules Committee for a hearing 
on the progress our Capitol has made 
to increase the security of this complex 
in the aftermath of January 6. 
We heard testimony from U.S. Cap-
itol Chief of Police Thomas Manger, 
who in his first 6 months has done an 
outstanding job to make this building 
safer and better prepared for the sorts 
of horrors that befell this hallowed 
space only 1 year ago this week. 
That day, on January 6, 2021, the men 
and women of our Capitol Police stood 
on the frontlines of the unimaginable: 
a violent assault upon the U.S. Capitol 
instigated by former President Trump 
and carried out by a mob of radicals 
looking to halt the peaceful transfer of 
power. That day, our Capitol policemen 
were outnumbered and underequipped. 
Yet their bravery and quick thinking 
saved many lives and prevented a vio-
lent riot from becoming something 
even worse. Today, we honor all those 
who stepped up that day, especially 
those whom we have lost in the after-
math. 
In the year since that attack, we 
have gotten a lot of things done in the 
Senate to strengthen our Capitol Po-
lice Force, to ensure from a security

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S29 
January 5, 2022 
standpoint that the violence of that 
day never happens again. Thanks to 
this work and to the new leadership of 
the Capitol Police, the U.S. Capitol 
today 
is 
undoubtedly 
considerably 
safer than it was a year ago. 
But let’s be clear. Let’s be very clear. 
January 6 was not merely a senseless 
act of violence; it was an attempt to 
reverse through violent means the out-
come of a free and a fair election. And 
make no mistake, the root cause of 
January 6 is still with us today. It lives 
on through the Big Lie pushed by Don-
ald Trump that is undermining faith in 
our political system and making our 
country and our democracy less safe. 
A year after January 6, the biggest 
threat to our Capitol, our Capitol Po-
lice, and our democracy today is the 
Big Lie perpetrated by Donald Trump. 
Without addressing the root causes of 
the event of January 6, the insurrec-
tion will not be an aberration; it could 
well become the norm. 
Just like the Senate has the power to 
pass legislation supporting our Capitol 
Police Force, we have the same power 
and obligation to pass legislation to 
address these root causes that brought 
the Big Lie to life. That is what my 
Senate colleagues and I are focused on 
and are committed to doing. We must 
act. 
More than any other point in recent 
history, threats of political violence 
are on the rise. Election administra-
tors are facing harassment and even 
death threats for just carrying out 
their duties. These are people who are 
sort of like civil servants. They are 
simply in charge of making sure the 
vote is counted fairly and accurately. 
In many States like mine, they are bi-
partisan. In some States, they are non-
partisan. But they are simply doing a 
job to make sure that the vote is 
counted correctly. Yet there are death 
threats against them for doing just 
that. By one measure, nearly one-third 
of these election officials say they feel 
less safe on the job, and many are quit-
ting in fear of their safety. 
All of us have a role to play to pro-
tect our democratic system—everyone 
from our Capitol Police to the voting 
public, to those of us entrusted to serve 
in elected office. 
Mr. President, just as the Capitol Po-
lice have taken the experience of Janu-
ary 6 to institute reforms for the fu-
ture, every Member of the U.S. Senate 
is called to do the same, to reckon with 
the lessons of that terrible day and 
take action to cure America of the dis-
ease of the Big Lie. That means passing 
legislation to protect our democracy 
from subversion and safeguard the 
right to vote, including the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act and 
the Freedom to Vote Act. 
Last year, Senate Democrats tried 
multiple times to get voting rights 
passed with bipartisan cooperation. 
Many of us—especially my colleague 
Senator MANCHIN—tried in good faith 
to bring the other side to the table. 
But every single time, Republicans 
mounted a partisan filibuster to stop 
this Chamber from even having a de-
bate on these measures. 
By now, Republicans have made it 
abundantly clear that bipartisanship is 
not an option when it comes to voting 
rights. That is against the grand tradi-
tion where the Voting Rights Act had 
gotten the support of President Reagan 
and President H. W. Bush and Presi-
dent Bush and got large bipartisan 
margins when it was renewed in the 
past. That is not true anymore. This is 
a new Republican Party under Donald 
Trump, and they are opposing any at-
tempt—any 
attempt—to 
strengthen 
voting rights. 
If this continues, the only option left 
for Democrats is to explore and propose 
reasonable fixes to restore the Senate 
so we can get these critical pieces of 
legislation passed into law. We will 
consider proposals to restore the Sen-
ate on or before January 17. 
The Republican leader has wasted no 
opportunity to criticize any discus-
sion—even a discussion—on how Mem-
bers of this body can act to restore the 
Senate to its proper function. Mere mo-
ments 
ago, 
the 
Republican 
leader 
strangely suggested that to make this 
Chamber better debate, compromise, 
and pass legislation somehow equates 
to breaking the Senate. He criticized 
the idea that Democrats would go at it 
alone. But I would remind everyone 
that when Leader MCCONNELL and Re-
publicans were in the majority, they 
used their simple majority for almost 
every major initiative they wished to 
put in place: the repeal of the Afford-
able Care Act, passing a multitrillion- 
dollar tax break for the ultrarich, and 
installing three rightwing Supreme 
Court Justices. They were happy to 
change the rules if it meant getting 
their picks confirmed to the Court. 
So let’s stop the crocodile tears right 
here and right now. The asymmetry 
cannot hold. If Senate Republicans 
continue to abuse the filibuster to pre-
vent this body from acting, the Senate 
must adapt. Just as Robert C. Byrd 
said, when circumstances change, the 
rules should change. 
There is no better way to heal the 
damage of January 6 than to act so 
that our constitutional order is pre-
served for the future. We must do so by 
any means that we can, even if it 
means 
Democrats 
find 
alternative 
paths forward on our own. For the sake 
of the vision handed down to us by the 
Framers, Democrats are going to con-
tinue this work in the weeks to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Novem-
ber 9, 2020, was the first day that the 
Senate was in session following the 
Presidential election that year. Six 
days had passed since the polls had 
closed. It had been 2 days since enough 
votes were tallied for the Associated 
Press and TV networks, including FOX, 
to conclude that Joe Biden was elected 
President of the United States. But in-
side the White House, former President 
Donald Trump was busy. He was 
tweeting a torrent of lies and con-
spiracy theories to deny the obvious. 
He was ready to pull the White House 
and the people’s house, this U.S. Cap-
itol, down around him in order to over-
turn an election he had lost. 
Never before—never in the history of 
the United States—has a President or 
Presidential 
candidate 
shown 
such 
utter contempt for the will of the 
American people or for the peaceful 
transition of power in a democracy. 
Yet, when the Senate convened 6 days 
after the election, some of our Repub-
lican colleagues actually offered ex-
cuses for the poor feelings and the atti-
tude and the demeanor of the former 
President and his incendiary actions. 
The Republican Senate leader, who 
was on the floor a few minutes ago, de-
fended President Trump at that time, 
saying that he was ‘‘100 percent within 
his right to pursue recounts and litiga-
tion.’’ 
Never mind that the lawsuits were 
based on the same lies that former 
President Trump was spewing. Over the 
next few weeks, those lawsuits were 
initiated. 
What was the final score? So 64 of the 
65 legal challenges brought by the 
Trump campaign to dismiss the results 
of the election were dismissed them-
selves as meritless, many by judges 
that Donald Trump had appointed. 
Also on November 9, a person identi-
fied only as ‘‘a senior Republican offi-
cial’’ told a Washington Post reporter 
something that is chilling. Speaking 
about the defeated President Trump 
lashing out with poisonous lies and 
conspiracy theories, this nameless Re-
publican 
asked: 
‘‘Well, 
what’s 
the 
downside for humoring him for a little 
bit of time? No one seriously thinks 
the results will change.’’ 
This unnamed Republican official 
went on to say: ‘‘He went golfing this 
weekend. It’s not like he’s plotting how 
to prevent Joe Biden from taking 
power on January 20. He’s tweeting 
about filing some lawsuits. The law-
suits will fail, then he’ll tweet some 
more on how the election was stolen, 
then he’ll leave.’’ 
That was the Republican attitude to-
ward President Trump after the elec-
tion results were in. In fact, we know 
now that plotting to prevent Joe Biden 
from taking power on January 20 was 
exactly what Donald Trump was up to. 
He abused the powers of his office to 
exert extraordinary pressure on the 
Justice Department. 
I know this because I was in the ac-
tual deposition in the Judiciary Com-
mittee, which I chair, when those in 
the Justice Department who were con-
tacted by the President for this pur-
pose testified under oath. 
Politicians and elected officials in 
key States were also contacted by 
President Trump. And the Vice Presi-
dent was drawn into the President’s 
plans to nullify an American election. 
We came perilously close to losing our 
democracy at that point.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S30 
January 5, 2022 
It survives today only because men 
and women of conscience—Democrats 
and Republicans—refused to cooperate 
with the former President. 
As it became apparent that he could 
not contort the bureaucracy to nullify 
the election, and it wasn’t working in 
the 
courts 
either, 
Donald 
Trump 
turned to a weapon—a desperate weap-
on—seldom used in American history: 
political violence. 
On 
December 
19, 
2020, 
Trump 
tweeted: ‘‘Big protest in DC on January 
6. Be there. WILL BE WILD!’’ 
That was one of the several tweets he 
sent out summoning his followers to 
Washington. 
On January 5, 2021, a year ago today, 
Steve Bannon, once one of Trump’s 
chief strategists, then discarded, then 
embraced—I can’t keep track—he is 
now back in the Trump fold. He used 
his podcast on that day, a year ago 
today, to telegraph the chaos that was 
going to erupt the next day. 
Steve Bannon told his listeners: 
‘‘We’re going into something that’s 
never happened before in American his-
tory,’’ he said that a year ago, ‘‘It’s not 
going to happen like you think it’s 
going to happen. Okay, it’s going to be 
quite extraordinarily different.’’ 
Bannon said: ‘‘All I can say is strap 
in. . . . It’s all converging, and now 
we’re on the point of attack tomor-
row.’’ 
That is a quote from Steve Bannon, a 
year ago today, about January 6, 2021. 
I don’t have to remind anyone what 
happened that day. Many of us lived it. 
Some may try to downplay it or deny 
it was any threat. They know better. 
They know the truth. 
If you were sitting in this Chamber, 
with Vice President Pence sitting in 
your chair, preparing to count the elec-
toral vote to determine the President 
of the United States, and you noted the 
Vice President’s staff come roaring 
through that door, reach up and grab 
him by the arms, and pull him off the 
podium where you are now sitting— 
people were dumbstruck. They couldn’t 
imagine what was going on here for a 
moment. And then to have a member of 
the Capitol Police come before us and 
stand where you are seated and to an-
nounce that this was going to be the 
safe room in the Capitol—they were 
going to start bringing staff members 
in to line the backs of the floor here 
because this was a safe place to be, and 
we should just sit tight and be quiet. 
Well, then we started hearing the 
roar outside, as the mob was descend-
ing on this building. And within 10 
minutes, another member of the Cap-
itol Police stood where you are sitting 
right now and said: Evacuate the 
Chamber as quickly as possible. Leave 
through these doors in an orderly fash-
ion. 
That was the reality of life in the 
Capitol and the business of the Senate 
when the mob—the Trump mob—de-
scended on January 6. We saw what 
happened. Many of us left and had to 
follow it by videos that were taken and 
photos later of people who were as-
saulted. When it was all over, five peo-
ple died, and 140 members of law en-
forcement were assaulted and victim-
ized and physically attacked. 
Those who dismiss it or don’t want to 
talk about it on the floor have to ac-
cept the reality; the reality was there 
was death and violence against law en-
forcement officials that day. And the 
notion that somehow all of these peo-
ple carrying Trump signs and banners 
were actually Democrats—what were 
they thinking? To believe that for a 
moment is to be totally deluded when 
it comes to the truth. 
So what has happened since? The 
largest criminal prosecution in the his-
tory of the United States has ensued. 
All of those videotapes that were taken 
by the participants and others in the 
course of this insurrectionist mob have 
been used to establish evidence to 
bring criminal charges against more 
than 700 individuals, some of whom are 
already serving time in prison for what 
they did that day, and it is not over. It 
is anticipated that another 300 will be 
charged, some with even more serious 
crimes. 
This was no minor incident or, as a 
Republican Congressman from Georgia 
said, ‘‘just tourists visiting the Cap-
itol.’’ No, it was a deadly moment. Peo-
ple died as a result of what happened 
that day. People have been changed 
forever as a result of what happened 
that day. It was for real. 
Today, the windows and furniture 
that were shattered by the rioters have 
been replaced. The National Guard 
members have gone home. Thank good-
ness the security fence around the Cap-
itol is finally down, but there are many 
invisible scars from January 6. Five po-
lice officers who battled the mob died. 
More than 140 were wounded. 
And the Big Lie of the stolen election 
that Trump used to summon his mob 
continues to metastasize. Over the last 
year, Republican lawmakers across the 
country have used this Big Lie as a 
pretext to pass laws to make it more 
difficult for Americans to vote. 
The Republican leader came to the 
floor and said 94 percent of the people 
who voted in the last Presidential elec-
tion said it was easy. Well, I am sure 
that is true. It was the largest turnout 
since 1900. 
But what has happened in almost 20 
states since then? Those State legisla-
tures controlled by the Republican 
Party have tried to make it more dif-
ficult in the next election for the same 
people to vote. That is a fact. 
And Americans now distrust our elec-
tions. More now believe that political 
violence is acceptable, and that has to 
change. Our democracy cannot endure 
with these cancers spreading. 
Abraham Lincoln called American 
democracy ‘‘the last best hope on 
Earth.’’ This last year has taught us 
that it may be the last best hope, but 
it is fragile. Our generation—every 
generation—has to be willing to fight 
to protect it. For the sake of our 
forbearers, who gave us this democ-
racy, and for our children and grand-
children, who will inherit its future, I 
am begging my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to condemn what hap-
pened in this Chamber on January 6, 
2021, and to make it clear, once and for 
all, on a bipartisan basis that we stand 
together, united, for this democracy to 
succeed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous con-
sent that I be able to complete my re-
marks before the vote gets underway. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I had 
hoped we had put the idea of changing 
the Senate filibuster rule to bed when 
two Members of the Democratic Party 
in the Senate pledged to oppose any at-
tempt to abolish the filibuster, but, un-
fortunately, the Democrat leader has 
revived this idea and has said that he 
plans to hold a vote on changing the 
filibuster rule on or before January 17. 
Democrats have offered a lot of bad 
ideas over the past year—a lot of bad 
ideas. But it is possible that abolishing 
the filibuster is by far the worst. Abol-
ishing the filibuster would mean fun-
damentally changing the character of 
the Senate and removing one of the 
most significant protections for minor-
ity rights in our system of government. 
Our Founders recognized that it 
wasn’t just Kings who could be tyrants. 
They knew majorities could be tyrants, 
too, and that a majority, if unchecked, 
could trample the rights of the minor-
ity. 
And so the Founders combined ma-
jority rule with both representation 
and constitutional protections for the 
minority. They established safeguards, 
checks and balances throughout our 
government, to keep the government in 
check and ensure that the rights of the 
minority were protected. And one of 
those safeguards was the U.S. Senate. 
In the House of Representatives, ma-
jority rule is emphasized, and the 
Founders could have left it at that. 
They could have stuck with a single 
legislative body. But they didn’t. Why? 
Because they were worried about the 
possibility of tyrannical majorities in 
the House endangering the rights of 
the minority. 
The author of Federalist 62 notes: 
A senate, as a second branch of the legisla-
tive assembly, distinct from and dividing the 
power with, a first, must be in all cases a sal-
utary check on the government. It doubles 
the security to the people, by requiring the 
concurrence 
of 
two 
distinct 
bodies 
in 
schemes of usurpation or perfidy. . . . 
Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not 
less indicated by the propensity of all single 
and numerous assemblies, to yield to the im-
pulse of sudden and violent passions, and to 
be seduced by factious leaders, into intem-
perate and pernicious resolutions. 
That is from the author of Federalist 
62. 
So the Founders created the Senate 
as a check on the House of Representa-
tives. They made the Senate smaller

and Senators’ terms of office longer, 
with the intention of creating a more 
stable, more thoughtful, and more de-
liberative legislative body to check ill- 
considered or intemperate legislation 
in attempts to curtail minority rights. 
As time has gone on, the legislative 
filibuster has become perhaps the key 
way the Senate protects minority 
rights. The filibuster ensures that the 
minority party and the Americans it 
represents has a voice in the Senate. It 
forces compromise. It forces biparti-
sanship. It encourages a greater level 
of stability and predictability. 
Even in the rare case when a major-
ity party has a filibuster-proof major-
ity in the Senate, the filibuster still 
forces the majority party to take into 
account the views of its more moderate 
or middle-of-the-road Members, thus 
ensuring that more Americans are rep-
resented in legislation. 
Removing the filibuster would erase 
this protection and allow the majority, 
including an incredibly narrow or 
merely technical majority, as Demo-
crats have right now, to trample mi-
nority rights. 
In the words of one former Senator, 
‘‘We should make no mistake. . . . It is 
a fundamental power grab by the ma-
jority party. . . . Folks who want to 
see this change want to eliminate one 
of the procedural mechanisms designed 
for the express purpose for guaran-
teeing individual rights, and they also 
have a consequence, and would under-
mine the protections of a minority 
point of view in the heat of majority 
excess.’’ 
That is former Senator, now Presi-
dent, Joe Biden, one of the many 
Democrats who has opposed abolishing 
the 
filibuster, 
because, 
of 
course, 
Democrats were singing a different 
tune on the filibuster just a couple of 
years ago. 
When President Trump urged Repub-
lican Senators to abolish the legisla-
tive filibuster—and, I would add, doz-
ens of times—Democrats were strongly 
opposed. In 2017, 32 Democrat Senators, 
including now-Vice President HARRIS 
and a majority of the current Demo-
crat caucus, signed a letter urging that 
the legislative filibuster be preserved, 
and Republicans agreed and refused to 
abolish the legislative filibuster de-
spite the former President’s repeated 
urging. 
It is not because we didn’t have a lot 
of legislation that we wanted to pass; 
we did. And we knew that abolishing 
the filibuster would make it a whole 
lot easier to advance our agenda, but 
we also knew that the Senate wasn’t 
designed to let a slim majority of Sen-
ators push through whatever agenda it 
wanted and that abolishing the legisla-
tive filibuster would quickly come 
back to haunt us when we were in the 
minority again. And so we resisted our 
own President’s urging and preserved— 
preserved—the legislative filibuster. 
Now, however, many Democrats, who 
not only supported but actively—ac-
tively and repeatedly—used the fili-
buster during the previous administra-
tion to block major coronavirus relief 
legislation and police reform legisla-
tion, have apparently decided that 
rules protecting the minority should 
only apply when Democrats are in the 
minority. 
Apparently, Democrat minorities de-
serve representation, but Republican 
minorities do not. 
It is a particularly outrageous posi-
tion when you consider the fact that, 
right now, Democrats have nothing 
more than a technical majority in the 
Senate. The Senate is currently divided 
50–50. The only reason Democrats have 
a deciding vote in the Senate is be-
cause the Vice President is a Demo-
crat. That is hardly the kind of major-
ity that should make Democrats feel 
free to steamroll minority rights. 
And let me put aside the question of 
minority rights and Democrats’ hypoc-
risy on this issue for just a moment. 
I want to talk about two things: One, 
my Democrat colleagues should be very 
sure that abolishing or amending the 
filibuster will come back to haunt 
them. That is simply the way of things. 
They only have to look back at Demo-
crats’ decision to abolish the filibuster 
for judicial nominations. 
I think I can speak for most of my 
Democrat colleagues when I say that it 
came back to haunt them and probably 
sooner than they expected. More than 
one Democrat, faced with President 
Trump’s judicial nominees and his Su-
preme Court appointments, openly re-
gretted their party having abolished 
the judicial filibuster. I would urge my 
Democrat 
colleagues 
to 
remember 
that. 
And I would urge them to remember 
that if they regret having abolished the 
judicial filibuster, they are likely to 
regret abolishing the legislative fili-
buster even more. 
I would also urge them to remember 
that they barely have a majority now, 
and that even the strongest majorities 
eventually end up back in the minor-
ity. Sooner or later, abolishing or 
amending the legislative filibuster will 
come back to haunt them. 
I get that my Democrat colleagues 
want to accomplish big things. Well, I 
would just like to remind them that it 
is possible to accomplish big things in 
a bipartisan fashion. I know, because 
we did it at the Commerce Committee 
when I was the committee chair, but it 
does require a real willingness to com-
promise and an acceptance of the fact 
that the Senate is not designed to let a 
narrow majority unilaterally impose 
its will. 
Finally, I urge my Democrat col-
leagues to think about what abolishing 
the filibuster would mean for ordinary 
Americans. Of course, it would mean 
decreased representation for any Amer-
icans whose party was a minority, but 
it would also mean highly unstable 
government policy and a resulting lack 
of confidence in government as well as 
a sharp increase in partisanship, which, 
I venture to say, is not what we need 
around here right now. 
In his discussion of the importance of 
the Senate as a stabilizing body, the 
author of Federalist 62 notes that ‘‘a 
continual change even of good meas-
ures is inconsistent with every rule of 
prudence, and every prospect of suc-
cess. . . . In the first place, it forfeits 
the respect and confidence of other na-
tions, and all the advantages connected 
with national character. . . . The inter-
nal effects of a mutable policy are still 
more calamitous. It poisons the bless-
ing of liberty itself. It will be of little 
avail to the people that the laws are 
made by men of their own choice, if the 
laws be so voluminous that they can-
not be read, or so incoherent that they 
cannot be understood; if they be re-
pealed or revised before they are pro-
mulgated, or undergo such incessant 
changes that no man, who knows what 
the law is to-day, can guess what it 
will be to-morrow. Law is defined to be 
a rule of action; but how can that be a 
rule, which is little known, and less 
fixed?’’ 
Abolish the filibuster, and we will 
end up in exactly the situation the au-
thor of Federalist 62 feared—with an 
inconsistent and ever-changing set of 
laws. 
An all-Democrat government will 
quickly push through whatever meas-
ures it judges to be the best, and an all- 
Republican government, when it takes 
power, will do the same. 
And again, neither party should be so 
arrogant as to think that the opposing 
party will never again gain control of 
government. The government was in 
unified Republican hands just 3 years 
ago; today, it is narrowly in Democrat 
hands, and it will continue to shift. 
Abolish the filibuster, and policy will 
shift sharply with it: social policy on 
abortion, religious freedom, and other 
issues; regulatory policy; tax policy; 
foreign policy, and the list goes on. 
In short, to quote Federalist 62, the 
laws would ‘‘undergo such incessant 
changes that no man, who knows what 
the law is to-day, can guess what it 
will be to-morrow.’’ 
And such incessant changes of na-
tional policy would unquestionably 
heighten partisanship in this country. 
As the laws became more extreme, 
the tension between Republicans and 
Democrats, conservatives and liberals, 
would only heighten—here in Congress, 
yes, but, most importantly, throughout 
the country among ordinary Ameri-
cans. 
Our government would no longer be 
perceived as government of the people 
and for the people. It would now be per-
ceived as government of and for Demo-
crat Americans or Republican Ameri-
cans, depending on the party in power. 
Democrats may think that some of 
the bills that they are advancing will 
serve the American people. 
Well, something else that will serve 
the American people is moderation and 
predictability in our government, and 
that is something that we will lose if 
we turn the Senate into the House of 
Representatives and abolish protection 
for minority rights.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S32 
January 5, 2022 
When Republicans were repeatedly 
faced with the prospect of abolishing 
the legislative filibuster during the 
previous administration, we said no, 
not because there wasn’t important 
legislation we wanted to pass but be-
cause we knew that the best thing for 
our country and for our future rep-
resentation in the Senate was to pre-
serve this essential protection for the 
minority. 
I urge my Democratic colleagues to 
think of their future and our country 
and make the same decision. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that following my 
remarks, the Senate recess until 2 p.m. 
and

time 
on 
the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

TRIBUTE TO HARRY REID 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and memory of 
former Senate Majority Leader Harry 
Mason Reid. To some in this Chamber, 
Senator Reid was a colleague, a men-
tor, a friend. To me and to so many Ne-
vadans, he was also a source of inspira-
tion and pride. His life, coming from 
the humblest of beginnings, is the defi-
nition of the American dream. 
During his decades of public service, 
from the State assembly to the Lieu-
tenant Governor’s Office, to chairing 
the Nevada Gaming Commission, he be-
came the most powerful leader in Con-
gress. This former boxer from a tiny 
town called Searchlight always put Ne-
vada first. 
Senator Reid served five terms in 
this very Chamber, and what he accom-
plished during those decades here, par-
ticularly as majority leader, is remark-
able. 
Senator 
Reid 
stopped 
Yucca 
Mountain. He made sure Nevada would 
not become the Nation’s nuclear waste 
dump. He is the reason we passed the 
Affordable Care Act into law, providing 
quality, affordable healthcare to tens 
of millions of Americans. He did more 
than anyone to rescue Nevada’s econ-
omy from the depths of the great reces-
sion. He passed crucial Wall Street re-
form to hold the big banks accountable 
for that economic crisis and prevent a 
future one. He established Nevada’s 
first national park, Great Basin Na-
tional Park. He saved Social Security 
from being privatized. He was a fearless 
champion for bold action to stop cli-
mate change, and he was a tireless 
fighter for comprehensive immigration 
reform and the Dream Act. 
Because Senator Reid celebrated our 
State’s diversity and recognized its im-
portance, Nevada is an early State, the 
first in the West when it comes to 
choosing each party’s nominee for the 
White House. No matter the issue, if it 
impacted Nevada, you can be sure Sen-
ator Reid would do anything to deliver 
for our State. He was a voice for all Ne-
vadans, and if you ever went to an 
event for Senator Reid, he would re-
mind you by making sure ‘‘Home 
Means Nevada’’—that is our State 
song—was sung in honor of our beloved 
State. 
This is how he got things done. He 
was blunt. He was direct. He was a real 
straight 
shooter. 
He 
didn’t 
mince 
words. When he identified a problem, 
he would work relentlessly to find a so-
lution. As so many of us here know, 
you could try as hard as you wanted to, 
but you could never leave the conversa-
tion or hang up the phone before he 
did. He said what he needed to and was 
on to his next piece of work. 
I want to share the best advice Sen-
ator Reid gave to me. He said this: 
Take every call. Listen to every per-
son, whether you agree with them or 
not, and then tell them when you are 
with them and tell them when you are 
not. Be open and honest in your con-
versations. 
These are words I try to live by here 
every day. They were things Senator 
Reid was respected for. 
Senator Reid also knew that the con-
stituent services, the work we do with 
our teams, literally saves lives and di-
rectly helps families, and it touches so 
many people. It is the most important 
and personal work we do and, through 
that work, can often become the foun-
dation for legislation at the Federal 
level. 
When I was thinking about whether 
or not to run for the Senate, Senator 
Reid invited me and my husband Larry 
over to his home to talk to him about 
making that decision. Well, in Senator 
Reid’s style, instead of taking the lead 
to tell us what to do and give us ad-
vice, he actually asked his wife Landra 
to talk to us about her experience. 
Well, anyone who has met Landra 
Reid knows what an incredible woman 
she is. Senator Reid was a family man, 
and he adored her and their children, of 
course, grandchildren, and I believe 
even great-grandchildren so very much. 
As my friend Brian Greenspun wrote 
the other day in the Las Vegas Sun, 
‘‘To Harry Reid the greatest accom-
plishment he had was his family.’’ 
Anyway, in Senator Reid’s living 
room, Landra told me and my husband

how she juggled being a mom of not 
one, not two, not three, not four, five 
kids—five kids—while Harry was work-
ing as a Capitol Police officer to put 
himself through law school while run-
ning tough campaigns and while serv-
ing long days and nights in Wash-
ington. Needless to say, there is not 
much that can top that. So the Reids 
provided my family with the inspira-
tion I needed as I was considering what 
a life in the public view would look 
like. 
Their love for each other, their jour-
ney and ability to make it work over 
six decades—raising kids, keeping their 
love strong—showed me how important 
it was to have a strong family, of 
course, and friends as the foundation 
for this work of public service. 
You know, we spend a lot of time 
here in Washington talking about poli-
tics every day, but it is the personal 
things at the end of the day we all 
know really matter, and that is the 
work that Senator Reid did for Nevad-
ans. He fought to make families’ lives 
just a little bit easier, whether they 
knew it or not, so that they could focus 
on what matters, what was most im-
portant to them. 
I want to honor Senator Reid for his 
lifetime of fighting the good fight for 
our State. He helped make Nevada 
what it is today—a world-class destina-
tion and truly a great place to live, 
work, and raise a family. 
I want to thank Landra and the en-
tire Reid family for sharing their hus-
band, their father, and their grand-
father with Nevada and with the Na-
tion. The American people have bene-
fited so much because of their sac-
rifices and his willingness to serve. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, Senator Reid.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, on 
Monday, the United States set a new 
pandemic record with more than 1 mil-
lion new cases in 24 hours. I am sure 
you and I and everyone who is thinking 
about this would have hoped we would 
be in a very different place right now 
than we are, but it is pretty signifi-
cant, 2 years into the pandemic, to set 
that kind of record. 
What is most concerning about this 
is many people who are concerned with 
catching the virus or who think they 
may already have it can’t get access to 
tests. I just heard earlier today on a 
call where the administration was pro-
viding information that they have 
asked for a request for information 
about who could provide a test and 
then made a request for proposals 
about who might be able to provide 
tests. 
But we are way down the road to be 
asking about who can provide tests. 
Congress has provided more than $80 
billion for COVID testing. If you look 
at the size of the defense budget, this is 
a pretty big percentage of the defense 
budget. 
We have lost track, I think, of how 
much money $1 billion or $1 trillion or 
$80 billion is, but the administration 
has had $80 billion. Over half of it, $47 
billion, they got in March in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. This is supposed to 
cover everything from research and de-
velopment of new rapid tests to manu-
facturing and purchase of these tests, 
to funding for State and local govern-
ments to distribute these tests. Here 
we are 9 months later, and we are con-
cerned that we don’t have tests because 
we don’t have enough tests. 
For the last month, Americans have 
faced long lines at testing centers. 
They have gone to places where they 
thought they could purchase a rapid 
test to find empty shelves. 
The question I really have is the 
same 
that 
many 
Americans 
have, 
which is what went wrong? Why are we 
facing such a shortage of tests now? 
How could we possibly have had $80 bil-
lion available for a minimum of 9 
months and now we are back in a test-
ing problem? 
I think the answer surely is not a 
lack of funding but, I think, more fun-
damentally, a lack of strategy, a lack 
of priority, and a failure to anticipate 
the ongoing testing needs by the ad-
ministration. 
When this administration came into 
office, their COVID–19 policy could 
have been called ‘‘Vaccines First.’’ And 
while I have been vaccinated and while 
I have urged all Americans to get a 
vaccine unless your doctor tells you 
not to, it has always been clear to me 
that the vaccine was only one part of 
the process. 
In fact, if you remember, from the 
very first, the vaccines were at a level 
that indicated that roughly 1 out of 10 
people that had a vaccine would also 
get COVID. What we know now is that 
person who gets COVID that had a vac-
cine is not going to be incredibly af-
fected by it, in all likelihood, but it 
shouldn’t have been a shock that many 
people who got a vaccine would also 
get COVID and would also want to 
know if they had COVID. 
Yet, for a full year, the administra-
tion has focused almost exclusively on 
one thing and testing and treatments 
have not had the attention they should 
have had or now that they must have. 
That failure has come at a steep cost. 
Today, Americans can’t find over-the- 
counter tests, and the Nation lacks a 
comprehensive reliable testing infra-
structure. 
Early in the pandemic, former Sen-
ator Lamar Alexander and I were on 
the phone nearly every day with offi-
cials from the Department of Health 
and Human Services to get a better un-
derstanding of how to fight the virus. 
He was the chairman of the appro-
priating committee. I was the chair-
man of the authorizing committee. We 
thought we had come up with a plan 
that, if carried out, would work just 
right. In fact, the result of those con-
versations was a twofold testing re-
sponse. 
First, we started a program at the 
National Institutes of Health we called 
RADx, which we kind of based, rough-
ly, on the TV program ‘‘Shark Tank,’’ 
where people brought ideas in about 
how they could produce a test in ways 
those tests were not being produced. 
Over $1 billion was invested directly 
with a dozen different companies that 
are producing today almost all of the 
tests that are available in stores. 
But, obviously, being sure that they 
were producing them at the volume 
that they needed to be produced was 
something we should have been paying 
attention to. We wanted to bring more 
tests to the market. We wanted to do it 
as quickly as possible and provide the 
necessary government intervention to 
do so. 
In the first 6 months of the RADx 
Program, at the end of that 6 months, 
they were delivering 2 million tests a 
day and 100 percent of all of the tests 
that were available for at-home test-
ing. 
Secondly, Senator Alexander and I 
thought that testing should be wide-
spread and easily available, easy to 
take. As we pushed to reopen schools 
and keep them open, we want to do the 
things that have a test that is fre-
quent, that is inexpensive, and makes 
sense. We went on and appropriated 
more than $30 billion for testing activi-
ties in the first five bipartisan bills to 
deal with COVID. 
Later, in the American Rescue Plan, 
an additional $47.8 billion for testing 
activities was made available. Now, re-
member this is legislation that was 
partisan in nature. No Republican 
voted for it. It had easier transfer au-
thority from category to category than 
any appropriations bill in the last 10 
years, and, frankly, we sent a letter to 
the Secretary of HHS this week—Sen-
ator BURR and I did—asking exactly 
what did this money get spent on. I am 
afraid we are going to find out not 
nearly all of it got spent on testing. 
The lack of funding has not been a 
problem, and I think we need to know 
what happened to the money and what 
we need to do to make the kind of in-
vestment now that we thought that $80 
billion would surely have made. 
When people asked last month about 
the difficulties in getting tests and 
why the administration wasn’t making 
tests free and available, the White 
House Press Secretary said—she just 
dismissed the idea out of hand. Then, 
less than 3 weeks later, they did an

about-face and announced they would 
distribute rapid tests to any American 
who wants one. That is a bold idea, one 
Europeans have been using throughout 
the pandemic. 
Let’s look at what the administra-
tion actually did. They will spend $3 
billion for 500 million rapid tests. That 
would be about 11⁄2 tests per person. 
They are also saying right now that 
really to have faith in the rapid tests, 
you probably need to take two of them, 
so the 11⁄2 per person doesn’t do quite 
what it needed to do. 
The approach to the answer to our 
testing shortage is not to spend to send 
500 million tests to the American peo-
ple. These tests haven’t been purchased 
yet. They haven’t been produced yet. 
They haven’t been distributed yet. And 
what do we do in the next weeks as we 
wait for even that to be done? 
Finally, the administration says that 
the at-home tests are ‘‘less sensitive’’ 
to the omicron variant than they need 
to be. I hope that is not the case. 
It is time the administration began 
to recognize that vaccines are a power-
ful weapon, that we need to continue to 
focus on them, but we also need to 
have a broader strategy. That strategy 
has to include people finding out 
whether they have COVID–19 or not. 
This is a wake-up call. I hope we wake 
up.

ANNIVERSARY OF JANUARY 6 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, 1 
year ago tomorrow, a violent mob at-
tacked our Capitol—this Capitol. Five 
Americans died, and hundreds sus-
tained injuries in what has been de-
scribed as the worst attack on our Cap-
itol since the War of 1812 and the worst 
attack on our democracy, literally, 
since the Civil War. The mob assaulted 
and maimed police officers, desecrated 
our beacon of democracy, and in using 
force, sought to obstruct the peaceful 
transfer of power in this Nation. 
One year later, as we recall the chaos 
and the bloodshed of that day, more 
than ever, I am convinced that we 
must fully understand what happened 
and make sure that it never happens 
again. 
The 2020 election was hard fought, 
but it was not especially close. Not one 
example of widespread fraud was found 
nor was any evidence presented that 
would have altered the outcome. Let’s 
take a moment and look at the facts. 
There were 81.2 million votes for Joe 
Biden last year—81.2 million. There 
were 74.2 million votes cast for Donald 
Trump—74.2. That is about 51.3 percent 
of the vote for Joe Biden and 46.8 per-
cent of the vote for Donald Trump; 306 
electoral votes for Joe Biden, 232 elec-
toral votes for Donald Trump. 
Ironically, Joe Biden earned the 
same number of electoral college votes 
as Donald Trump did in 2016. Why is 
that relevant? Well, in 2016, Donald 
Trump declared that his 232 electoral 
votes was a—no, his 306 electoral votes. 
Joe Biden got the same number of 
votes in 2020 as Donald Trump did in 
2016. When Trump won with 306 elec-
toral votes, he said it was a landslide. 
When Biden wins by the same number 
of electoral votes, Donald Trump says: 
No, it is not a landslide; it is a theft. 
You have stolen the election. 
Despite these facts, Donald Trump 
pressed ahead with legal challenges in 
several States. Many of these claims 
were downright bizarre, and many were 
unfounded. More than 60 Federal and 
State courts, involving more than 90 
judges, many of whom were nominated 
by Republican Presidents, including 
Donald Trump, all agreed that no evi-
dence of widespread fraud, wrongdoing 
or other irregularities were uncovered 
subsequent to the 2020 election—none. 
Allow me to quote one of them. 
Judge Bibas is a longtime member of 
the conservative Federalist Society, 
whom Donald Trump actually nomi-
nated to the Third Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. 
In 
ruling 
against 
Donald 
Trump’s baseless claims of fraud in 
Pennsylvania, Judge Bibas said: ‘‘Call-
ing an election unfair does not make it 
so.’’ Let me repeat that. ‘‘Calling an 
election unfair does not make it so.’’ 
Rather than accept defeat at the bal-
lot box and in the courtroom, the 
former President embraced conspiracy 
theories and outright lies. The January 
6 insurrection occurred because these 
lies—and let me repeat: lies—were a 
call to action for White supremacists 
and other domestic extremists. 
As someone who grew up in Danville, 
VA, the last capital of the confederacy, 
I have seen Confederate flags before—a 
lot of them—but I never expected to 
see any of them in this Capitol or in 
this Chamber. 
On January 6, the former President 
incited a mob at the National Mall, and 
he sent them to attack this Capitol. He 
lit a match, fanned the flames of vio-
lence, and did nothing to extinguish 
the fire. He was deservedly impeached 
for the second time for this heinous of-
fense against our Constitution, which 
he was sworn to defend. 
One year later, I am standing in this 
sacred Chamber, thanks in large part 
to the heroism of countless officers 
from the U.S. Capitol Police and the 
DC Metropolitan Police Departments. 
Over 150 police officers were injured 
that day—over 150. Tragically, five po-
lice officers have subsequently lost 
their lives in connection to the Janu-
ary 6 attack, including, tragically, four 
by suicide. 
Many of the officers who defended 
our Capitol will carry the wounds of 
that day, both physical and mental, 
with them for years to come. In re-
sponse, we must remain committed to 
their health and safety for years to 
come. They showed remarkable cour-
age that day. They risked their lives— 
an unyielding to commitment to the 
oath that they took to protect our Con-
stitution and this Capitol.

January 5, 2022 
One of those officers was Officer Eu-
gene Goodman. Officer Goodman is a 
U.S. Army veteran who was raised 
right here in the District of Columbia, 
not far from where we are gathered. He 
saw combat in the Iraq war, fighting 
with the 101st Airborne Division, until 
he returned home and signed up to 
serve with the Capitol Police in 2009. 
He had shown valor in uniform pre-
viously—that was in a war zone—and I 
am certain that Officer Goodman never 
imagined that he would be called on to 
fight a battle to defend our Constitu-
tion in the U.S. Capitol, not far from 
his own backyard. Just outside these 
doors, Officer Goodman distracted the 
mob and helped to save 100 U.S. Sen-
ators and many of our staff members 
from harm, as well as Members of the 
House of Representatives and their 
staff too. 
The brave men and women of law en-
forcement, like Officer Goodman, put 
their lives on the line that day to pro-
tect not just the Members of Congress 
inside the House and Senate Chambers 
but our very Constitution. 
Ultimately, the insurrectionists and 
the former President failed to overturn 
the election because Democrats, Re-
publicans, and a Republican Vice Presi-
dent, Michael Pence, returned to the 
House and Senate Chambers. After 
order was restored, we did not accept 
mob rule; instead, we certified the 
votes of millions of Americans because 
that is what our democracy and our al-
legiance to it demanded of us. 
We have learned a lot over the past 
year that puts that day into better 
context. There is still much to learn. 
But January 6 was far from a random 
event. It was a premeditated, coordi-
nated, and, in the end, violent effort to 
overturn an election. In other coun-
tries, we would call this an attempted 
coup. 
One year later, I am alarmed and ap-
palled by the attempts to rewrite the 
history of January 6 as a peaceful pro-
test. These conspiracy theories and lies 
continue to fuel the same misinforma-
tion and hatred that led to January 6. 
Colleagues, we need to lead by our 
example. We must choose truth over 
the Big Lie. We must choose the Con-
stitution over the mob. We must 
choose the rule of law and mutual re-
spect for one another over hatred and 
division. 
Thomas Jefferson once said—this is a 
paraphrase, but something along these 
lines—he said: If the people know the 
truth, they won’t make a mistake. 
I love that. If the people know the 
truth, they won’t make a mistake. 
Well, we returned that day to this 
very Chamber to certify the votes of 
millions of Americans because we 
wanted the American people to know 
the truth: Joe Biden and KAMALA HAR-
RIS
won the 2020 election fair and 
square. We must now make sure that 
every American knows the unvarnished 
truth related to January 6. 
Over the past several years, I have 
mentioned time and again the wisdom 
of the Framers of our Constitution. In 
the hot summer of 1787, they gathered 
and debated a new form of government, 
a constitutional republic with an intri-
cate system of checks and balances. 
Little did they know that that docu-
ment, first ratified by Delaware, would 
become the longest running experiment 
in democracy that the world has ever 
known. 
I have sworn an oath no fewer than 12 
times to protect the Constitution of 
our country: first as a 17-year-old Navy 
ROTC midshipman at Ohio State; 4 
years later when I was commissioned 
as an ensign in the Navy to become a 
naval flight officer during the Vietnam 
war; again as I relinquished my regular 
commission and assumed a Reserve 
commission; and then another, gosh, 
eight times as a House Member and 
here as a Senator. We have a sacred ob-
ligation to protect our Constitution 
from enemies both foreign and domes-
tic. 
In his second inaugural address at 
the end of the Civil War, President Lin-
coln addressed a deeply divided nation. 
All told, more than 600,000 Americans 
would die in the bloodiest conflict in 
our Nation’s history. Still, President 
Lincoln called on the Nation to come 
together, to bind up our wounds, and to 
begin to heal. I believe that these 
words, which were etched inside the 
Lincoln Memorial just a few miles 
from where we gather today, can guide 
our Nation in this moment. 
Colleagues, in order to truly bind up 
our wounds related to January 6 and 
heal a deeply divided nation, we must 
continue seeking the truth and holding 
those responsible to account. More 
than 700 individuals have already been 
charged with crimes related to the at-
tack on our Capitol. 
Moreover, the bipartisan House Se-
lect Committee must finish its impor-
tant work that it has begun and pro-
vide us with the facts of that day and 
the days that preceded it. Armed with 
those facts, many of us who serve in 
this Congress must make sure that the 
American people know the truth and 
that everyone responsible for the plot-
ting, for the planning, and for the exe-
cution of an attempt to overturn an 
election in the United States of Amer-
ica is held accountable to the fullest 
extent of the law. Our democracy de-
mands no less. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor at this time to my 
colleague from Texas. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Texas. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, ear-
lier this week, the majority leader sent 
a letter to our Democratic colleagues, 
which has been widely distributed in 
the press even though he didn’t send it 
to folks on this side of the aisle. We 
have all now had a chance to read it. 
He has outlined what the next few 
weeks on the Senate floor might look 
like. 
Now that the so-called Build Back 
Better—or what some have called the 
reckless tax-and-spending spree—bill 
has been sidelined due to lack of sup-
port, Senator SCHUMER has shifted his 
focus to another dangerous and unnec-
essary bill. This time, rather than an 
attempt to spend trillions of dollars 
and to raise taxes on the American 
people, he is proposing that we over-
haul the very foundation of our democ-
racy. 
Our colleagues on the Democratic 
side don’t trust their own State legisla-
tors to pass voting laws that are in 
compliance with the Voting Rights Act 
and the laws of the land. The reason I 
say that, as shocking as it may sound, 
is, why in the world would they want 
to preempt their own State voting laws 
by passing a national law which would, 
under the supremacy clause of the U.S. 
Constitution, preempt their own State 
laws? Well, this power grab would give 
the Federal Government unprecedented 
power to make decisions about how 
elections are run in all 50 States. 
This isn’t the first time our friends 
across the aisle have shown an interest 
in hijacking America’s elections. We 
have seen various versions before, each 
one relying on a slightly different mar-
keting strategy. At one point, it was 
touted as a necessity of election secu-
rity. Then, when that didn’t work, they 
said: Well, this is about instilling in 
the voters confidence in our election 
laws. Then, when they failed to muster 
the political support necessary to pass 
that bill, they tried to figure out an-
other way to sell it, and they said: 
Well, really what we need to do is re-
move obstacles that prevent people 
from voting. 
Well, the 2020 election saw an unprec-
edented turnout. In my State, there 
were 11.3 million people who cast their 
ballots. Hispanics, African Americans, 
and other minorities voted in histori-
cally high numbers. Sixty-six percent 
of registered voters in Texas voted in 
the 2020 election, making it the highest 
voter turnout in 120 years when you 
look across the great expanse of this 
country. So now our colleagues across 
the aisle are going to have to come up 
with a new sales pitch. 
As we know, in the wake of the 2020 
election and concerns about some of 
the irregularities in those various 
States, States have passed legislation 
to make it easier to vote and harder to 
cheat. I can’t imagine why we wouldn’t 
all embrace that approach: Make it 
easier to vote and harder to cheat. 
Senator SCHUMER has described these 
State laws as ‘‘reprehensible’’ and ‘‘the 
most sweeping attack on the right to 
vote since the beginning of Jim Crow.’’ 
Based on those extraordinary state-
ments, you might think that the 
States have restored literacy tests. 
You might think the disgusting and 
subjective 
determination 
of 
‘‘good 
moral character’’ before someone was 
allowed to vote—the kind of prohibi-
tions that existed after the Civil War— 
had been reinstated. 
The truth is different than Senator 
SCHUMER would portray. Many of these

S36 
January 5, 2022 
changes in State laws were designed to 
reduce opportunities for fraud or roll 
back temporary protocols that were 
put in place during the pandemic. 
The new Texas law, for example, re-
quires voting systems to be tested be-
fore an election is held to ensure there 
are no technical difficulties. It is not 
unheard of that voting machines break 
or need to be repaired. That just makes 
sense. 
The new Texas law also requires that 
voter rolls be kept up-to-date; in other 
words, people who are no longer alive— 
their names would be removed from the 
voter rolls. 
Texas is no stranger to voting irreg-
ularities. In fact, the story of Box 13 in 
Jim Wells County, TX, was supposedly 
the reason why Lyndon Baines Johnson 
beat Coke Stevenson in the race for the 
U.S. Senate many, many years ago. 
Strangely enough, the votes on the 
voting rolls tended to go through the 
local cemetery and go in alphabetical 
order, providing LBJ the votes he need-
ed in order to beat Coke Stevenson in 
that election. So removing dead voters 
from the voter rolls strikes me as a 
pretty good idea. 
Other changes the State legislature 
made in Texas expanded voting access. 
We already offer 2 weeks of early vot-
ing in person, and the new law didn’t 
make any changes to that, but it did 
extend voting hours in more than 60 
Texas counties and clarified that vot-
ers who were in line at the polling 
place before polls closed will still be 
able to cast their ballots. 
The Texas law was not the only one 
to actually improve voter access. Geor-
gia, for example, expanded early voting 
in person to 17 days, which is more gen-
erous than what is offered in many 
Democrat States. 
In New Jersey, by contrast, early 
voting only lasts 9 days—9 days in New 
Jersey, 17 days in Georgia. Has the At-
torney General sued New Jersey for 
somehow suppressing the right to vote? 
No, he hasn’t. He has sued Georgia, and 
he has sued Texas. And I will make a 
prediction right here today that he will 
lose both of those lawsuits because the 
facts simply don’t support the litiga-
tion. 
If you are from New York, you have 
10 days before early voting in order to 
cast your ballot—less than you see in 
Georgia and Texas. 
And this year, for the first time in 
President Biden’s home State of Dela-
ware, you can have 10 days before elec-
tion day in which to cast your ballot. 
Before that time, including the 2020 
election, in Delaware, if you wanted to 
cast your ballot before the election— 
like you can in Texas, Georgia, New 
Jersey, and New York—you couldn’t 
even do it because in President Biden’s 
home State of Delaware, they did not 
allow early in-person voting until this 
year. 
Well, contrary to what Senator SCHU-
MER said, these changes are far from 
reprehensible; they are common sense. 
You don’t hear Senator SCHUMER claim 
that Delaware is trying to suppress the 
right to vote by not having any early 
in-person voting before this year. 
So it is very politically convenient 
for the majority leader to attack those 
States where Democrats aren’t doing 
quite so well in the elections because it 
doesn’t align with their goals here. 
What are their goals? Well, it is pure-
ly partisan political advantage. Our 
Democratic colleagues have tried to 
spin this narrative of a blatant attack 
on the right to vote. How you could 
make that claim in terms of the his-
toric turnouts in the 2020 election is 
beyond me. 
I will just give you one personal ex-
ample. When I was last on the ballot in 
2014, there were 4.8 million voters. In 
2020, when I was next on the ballot— 
that actually was the last time I was 
on the ballot, 2020—there were 11.3 mil-
lion voters. So we more than doubled 
the number of people who cast their 
ballot in Texas in 6 years. 
And the story could be told in other 
parts of the country, like Florida and 
others, where more and more people 
are voting, which is certainly some-
thing we endorse and we embrace. But 
we also want to make it harder to 
cheat. 
Our colleagues have tried to spin this 
narrative of voter suppression. But the 
myth of widespread voter suppression 
in 2022 is a myth. Well, why is that? 
Well, in 1965, Congress passed some-
thing called the Voting Rights Act, 
which was a historic piece of legisla-
tion that said you cannot deny people 
access to the ballot on the basis of race 
or ethnicity. 
And the good news is, over the inter-
vening years, the Voting Rights Act 
has worked magnificently. In fact, 
many States that previously were sub-
ject 
to 
preclearance 
requirements 
under the Voting Rights Act because of 
historic discrimination actually now 
have greater participation by minori-
ties in their elections than other 
States that were not so covered. 
And right now, the law of the land is, 
under section 2 of the Voting Rights 
Act, if any State or political subdivi-
sion tried to suppress people’s right to 
vote based on race or ethnicity, they 
would be sued by the Attorney General, 
as they should be, and it would be de-
clared illegal. 
That law, section 2, has been part of 
the Voting Rights Act for more than a 
half a century, and no one is proposing 
to change it because it has worked ex-
actly the way Congress intended when 
we passed it in 1965. 
The Democrats are falsely claiming 
assaults on the right to vote for one 
reason and one reason only, and it is to 
achieve political ends because the facts 
simply do not support their arguments 
or their proposals. 
Now, it shouldn’t be of any surprise 
that Republicans don’t want to turn 
over their elections to Washington, DC, 
and to the Biden Department of Jus-
tice. So the path forward for the major-
ity leader is to try to eliminate the 60- 
vote requirement known as the fili-
buster in order to pass legislation. 
In his letter earlier this week, Sen-
ator SCHUMER concedes that the Senate 
was 
designed 
to 
protect 
minority 
rights, but those rights, he said, have 
been ‘‘warped and contorted to ob-
struct and embarrass the will of [the] 
majority.’’ 
I can tell you from experience that 
the majority is always frustrated by 
the 60-vote cloture requirement known 
as the filibuster, but it is designed for 
a very specific purpose. It is designed 
to force us to do what maybe does not 
come naturally, which means to work 
together on a bipartisan basis to build 
consensus legislation that will stand 
the test of time. 
But what Senator SCHUMER is pro-
posing to do, because we have a 50–50 
Senate, is to change the rules so that 
Democrats, and Democrats alone, can 
dictate what these new laws will look 
like. That is it. It is not any more com-
plicated than that. 
Senator SCHUMER
is frustrated, no 
doubt, by everything that he and the 
Democratic colleagues in the Senate 
have been unable to accomplish, what 
they have promised and what they 
have delivered. But this is by his own 
design. He sets the agenda. He knows if 
he brings a bill to the floor like the in-
frastructure bill that passed earlier 
this year or the national defense au-
thorization bill, that there is broad bi-
partisan support, and the chances are 
that they will pass with large bipar-
tisan majorities, as both of those did. 
But when they try to jam through 
things like so-called Build Back Bet-
ter, which has zero support on the Re-
publican side and actually doesn’t even 
have unanimous support on the Demo-
cratic side, it should be no surprise 
that they are unable to get that passed, 
as we have seen in recent weeks. 
So Senator SCHUMER sets the agenda. 
If he decides to continue to set the 
agenda on partisan legislation that 
doesn’t even enjoy majority support of 
his own political party, he can expect 
the same results over and over again. 
He himself is the reason why the 
President’s agenda has not succeeded 
because he has given up on bipartisan-
ship and consensus building in a 50–50 
Senate. 
The reason why it is important to 
build bipartisan consensus when it 
comes to legislation is because they 
will endure no matter what happens in 
the next election or the next election 
or the next election. This is good pol-
icy so people can plan. 
It also assures that the States that 
elect Senators who happen to be of the 
minority party will have their views 
listened to and accommodated, where 
possible, as part of that consensus- 
building process. 
The filibuster, which the American 
people probably did not widely hear 
much about before but have heard a lot 
about, was designed to ensure that 
each of these things occurs—bipartisan 
consensus building, legislation that

will stand the test of time, and legisla-
tion that will not change with each 
fleeting majority. That is what the 60- 
vote requirement known as the fili-
buster is designed to address. 
Now, what has been so remarkable to 
me is how Senator SCHUMER’s views on 
the filibuster have changed. Back in 
2005, he said eliminating the filibuster 
would be the ‘‘doomsday for democ-
racy.’’ He was in the minority then. He 
said eliminating the filibuster would be 
the ‘‘doomsday for democracy.’’ 
More recently, when it suited his po-
litical interests, he argued to protect it 
and said that we should—well, this is 
before he was in the majority. He ar-
gued that we ought to ‘‘build a firewall 
around the legislative filibuster.’’ 
During his days in the Senate, Presi-
dent Biden, who served a long time in 
this institution, said: 
This nuclear option— 
That is what he called eliminating 
the 60-vote requirement to close off de-
bate known as the filibuster. 
He said: 
This nuclear option is ultimately an exam-
ple of the arrogance of power. It is a funda-
mental power grab by the majority party. 
That is what he called what Senator 
SCHUMER
is trying to do today. He 
called it ‘‘the arrogance of power,’’ and 
he called it ‘‘a fundamental power grab 
by the majority party.’’ 
Our friends across the aisle used the 
filibuster numerous times to block ma-
jority-proposed legislation when they 
were in the minority. They filibustered 
countless bills on everything from pan-
demic relief to police reform. 
Now, when it is politically conven-
ient and expedient, they flip-flop. They 
have gone from defending this con-
sensus-building rule to declaring it 
public enemy No. 1. 
I could use a lot of examples, but I 
will just use this one from our col-
league Senator DURBIN, the majority 
whip. 
Just a few years ago, Senator DUR-
BIN, a distinguished Member of this 
body and part of the Democratic lead-
ership, said that if the filibuster were 
eliminated, it ‘‘would be the end of the 
Senate as it was originally devised and 
created going back to our Founding 
Fathers.’’ That was just in 2018. 
Last year, he said the filibuster is 
‘‘not the guarantor of democracy. It 
has become the death grip of democ-
racy.’’ 
I guess we can be forgiven if we get 
whiplash trying to reconcile those two 
conflicting positions in a short period 
of 3 years. 
The truth is, this isn’t about some 
noble endeavor saving our democracy. 
This isn’t about just policy differences. 
This is about gaining permanent par-
tisan political advantage by national-
izing 
our 
State-run 
election 
laws, 
which, by the way, I believe would be 
unconstitutional. 
Democrats simply think it is in their 
best interest to eliminate the 60-vote 
consensus-building rule and to secure 
an easy path for legislation, and that 
may be true—for now. 
But what we have learned from hard 
experience is that there are inherent 
consequences to changing rules in a 
place where your power, where your 
majority is never guaranteed. Elec-
tions happen. Majorities come and go. 
Presidents change political parties. 
In less than a year’s time, Repub-
licans could hold the majority in either 
or both Chambers. In 3 years, a Repub-
lican could be in the White House as 
well. 
Ask yourself this: Would our Demo-
cratic colleagues still support elimi-
nating the filibuster were that to 
occur? If Republicans were in the ma-
jority in the House and the Senate and 
there was a Republican in the White 
House, would they support eliminating 
the filibuster? Not on your life. Would 
they believe that the minority party 
should be silenced, as they apparently 
are arguing for now? Not on your life. 
We 
don’t 
have 
to 
speculate 
on 
hypotheticals because we have seen 
this scenario before. Less than a decade 
ago, our Democratic colleagues went 
‘‘nuclear.’’ That is using the termi-
nology that President Biden used when 
he was in the Senate, the ‘‘nuclear op-
tion’’—the rule change to breaking the 
rules in order to change the rules. 
Less than a decade ago, Democrats 
went ‘‘nuclear’’ and eliminated the 60- 
vote threshold for judicial nominees. 
This was a precedent that they them-
selves had established. At the time, 
Leader MCCONNELL said—who has been 
here for a while, who has seen majori-
ties come and majorities go—he said: 
You will regret this, and you may regret 
this a lot sooner than you think. 
Unsurprisingly, he was right. Under 
the previous administration, a Repub-
lican-led Senate, with a Republican in 
the White House, confirmed more than 
230 Federal judges—all thanks to the 
Democrats’ nuclear option rule change. 
If Senator SCHUMER were able to con-
vince Senator MANCHIN
and Senator 
SINEMA to blow up the Senate and to 
break the rules, along with others—and 
that is a big if—it might clear the way 
for the legislation they want right 
now. But when the balance of power 
shifts, as it surely will, this rule 
change they are proposing today could 
make it easier for Republicans to pass 
legislation that our Democratic col-
leagues simply abhor—legislation that 
protects the right to life, legislation 
that secures the border and controls il-
legal immigration, legislation that bal-
ances the Federal budget, protects our 
Second Amendment rights, or—take 
your pick—any other changes Demo-
crats would certainly oppose. That 
would be possible if they were to get 
their way temporarily. 
Now, I have heard this argument 
about, well, this is just going to be a 
carve-out. There is no such thing as a 
carve-out under the Senate’s rules and 
precedents. 
This 
would 
be 
applied 
broadly and allow Republicans to turn 
the tables and to pass legislation 
Democrats dislike by a simple major-
ity if they were to eliminate the 60- 
vote filibuster requirement. 
The truth is that in the Senate, the 
shoe is always on the other foot, even-
tually, which is why no party has ever 
been so shortsighted as to eliminate 
the legislative filibuster in the history 
of the U.S. Senate. 
Fortunately, the Senate is designed 
to allow for deliberation and debate, 
and cooler heads usually prevail. I hope 
the Senators who, along with Senator 
MANCHIN and Senator SINEMA, will re-
main steadfast—and I do believe there 
are other Senators who are of similar 
views, that it would be shortsighted 
and foolish to eliminate the filibuster, 
but simply haven’t attracted attention 
to themselves and let Senator MANCHIN 
and Senator SINEMA take all the slings 
and arrows. But I hope those who op-
pose changes in the legislative fili-
buster will remain steadfast in their 
opposition to such a dangerous change. 
A completely partisan overhaul of 
America’s elections is hardly an effec-
tive way to improve public confidence 
in our elections. It is just the opposite. 
A partisan change in our election laws, 
by nationalizing them, won’t lead to 
improved public trust or more secured 
elections. It is a recipe for fraud, abuse, 
and partisan distrust. 
This rules change in the legislation 
would fast-track and may make some 
activists in the Democratic base happy, 
but it would instill lasting instability 
and distrust in our institutions, includ-
ing our elections. 
I would simply encourage our Demo-
cratic colleagues to reconsider their 
current position based on their past po-
sition and to consider the grave con-
sequences before leading our country 
down this dangerous path. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF LATE SENATOR JOHN ‘‘JOHN-
NY’’ HARDY ISAKSON 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to honor a 
friend, our late Senator from Georgia, 
my predecessor, Senator Johnny Isak-
son. 
I mourn this great loss with the rest 
of Georgia and people all across our 
Nation, and since his passing, I know I 
have joined many of you in reflecting 
on the countless memories and mo-
ments that we shared with Johnny 
Isakson. 
Without a doubt, Senator Isakson 
cared deeply for Georgia, and he cared 
deeply for our country. He was a pa-
triot, a public servant, and there are 
members of my staff, I am proud to 
say, who used to work for Johnny, and 
they will tell you that he never hesi-
tated to show up. 
I often talk in my other job about 
the ministry of presence. Sometimes, 
half a job is to show up, and he knew 
how to show up for people, whether it 
was paying a visit to an ill patient, the 
ill parent of a staffer, or seeing a dis-
abled veteran.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S38 
January 5, 2022 
Senator Isakson dedicated years of 
service to our beloved State, to our 
veterans, our families, and our chil-
dren. 
He always made it a point to join us 
at the Ebenezer Baptist Church for the 
annual service and commemoration of 
Martin Luther King, Jr. I always smile 
when I consider the fact that he 
showed up. A lot of politicians showed 
up. He always stayed for the whole 
service, and, I will tell you, it is no 
short service. But Senator Isakson was 
there the whole time as we recognized 
and celebrated Georgia’s greatest son, 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Johnny Isakson was my friend. In 
fact, when this country elected its first 
Black President, he recognized the his-
toric significance, although he was in a 
different party. He called me on the 
phone. He thought I might want to be 
there. So I witnessed in person the in-
auguration—the first inauguration—of 
Barack Obama as a guest of Johnny 
Isakson. 
And then, a few years later, when we 
were at a flash point—a flash point of 
division in this country—and there 
were some, as we were approaching a 
State of the Union Address, who were 
saying we should not have the same 
kind of partisan scene where one side 
stands up and the other one sits down, 
that we ought to try to find the ways 
in which we are connected, and the 
folks who work here will all try to find 
somebody. You all might remember 
that. Johnny Isakson reached out to 
me, and I was his guest sitting in the 
House, witnessing for the first time in 
person a State of the Union address. 
And the very first time I stood on the 
floor of this Chamber, I came as John-
ny Isakson’s guest, as Chaplain of the 
day, opening the Senate in prayer. 
He was my friend, which is why I was 
not surprised when he called me up and 
he said: RAPHAEL, I am retiring. I want 
to say good-bye, and I want to come by 
your church. 
So on a Sunday morning, Senator 
Isakson and his wife and other mem-
bers of his family came by. We enjoyed 
conversation in my office, and then I 
shortened my sermon that morning so 
he could say hello to the people of Ebe-
nezer. He left a gift to support our min-
istry to veterans because he was so 
committed to those who give so much 
for our freedom. 
Johnny Isakson always showed up, 
and he was unafraid to work across ide-
ological 
differences, 
political 
dif-
ferences, in our State and our country. 
I will never forget that example of pub-
lic service. 
So this morning, with great apprecia-
tion and admiration for Senator John-
ny Isakson—for a friend—I introduced 
a bipartisan resolution with Senator 
OSSOFF, honoring the life and the leg-
acy of Senator Isakson, that is cospon-
sored now by all of my 99 Senate col-
leagues. 
He brings us together in death the 
same way he did in life. He is a model 
of public service, an example to future 
generations of leaders on how to stand 
on principle to make progress, while 
also governing with compassion and a 
heart for compromise. 
I hope we can all remember the les-
sons of Senator Isakson’s service, al-
ways looking for ways to make friends, 
to move our State and Nation forward, 
and, when that doesn’t work, looking 
for how we can make, as he called it, 
‘‘future friends.’’ 
I bring these lessons and other advice 
Senator Isakson gave me to my work 
for Georgia here in the Senate. I am al-
ready looking forward to next year’s 
bipartisan 
barbecue 
which 
Senator 
Isakson started and we carried on this 
year in his honor. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with all of my colleagues—all of 
them—for the love of the people we 
serve and the spirit of our beloved 
friend, Senator Johnny Isakson. May 
my predecessor and friend live forever 
in our hearts and spirits. He was an up-
standing elected official and an even 
better man. 
Blessed are they who die in the 
Lord’s sense of spirit, for they rest 
from their labors, and their deeds do 
follow them. 
God bless his memory and bless his 
family with the peace of God that sur-
passes human understanding. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of S. Res. 484, submitted earlier 
today.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 484) honoring the life 
and legacy of late Senator John ‘‘Johnny’’ 
Hardy Isakson. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the reso-
lution be agreed to, the preamble be 
agreed to, and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 484) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to.

printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’)

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2895 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, last month I was proud to see the 
Senate come together in a bipartisan 
effort and pass a Congressional Review 
Act measure to overturn President 
Biden’s unconstitutional Federal vac-
cine mandate on private businesses. In 
that bipartisan vote, a majority of U.S. 
Senators sent a clear message that 
these job-killing mandates are wrong 
and have no place in our country’s 
fight against COVID–19. 
Then, just days after Christmas, 
President Biden said something very 
interesting. While he was talking with 
Governors about the COVID–19 pan-
demic, he admitted: 
Look, there is no Federal solution. This 
gets solved at a State level. 
This is President Biden’s message: 
States should be leading the effort. 
Now, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a 
role for the Federal Government. But 
what we have seen from the Biden ad-
ministration is no progress, just wors-
ening cases, and the horrible job-kill-
ing consequences of his unconstitu-
tional mandates on private businesses. 
I want to be clear: His unconstitu-
tional mandates are job killers. Back 
in October, the Federal Reserve re-
ported that vaccine mandates were 
widely cited by businesses as a reason 
for low labor supply and hiring and re-
tention issues. It was a finding my Re-
publican colleagues and I have been 
warning about for months before their 
report, and it is directly tied to infla-
tion. 
When the labor supply is reduced, 
prices go up, and families, especially 
those on low and fixed incomes, suffer. 
Restaurants, grocery stores, gas sta-
tions, and small businesses all have to 
charge more. 
I heard about a restaurant owner in 
St. Petersburg, FL, who had to take 
certain items off the menu because 
they simply cost too much, and he 
can’t pass the cost on to his customers. 
He has even seen the price of oil and 
to-go boxes more than double. 
I talked to an operator of a food bank 
in Osceola County, FL. She used to see 
15 families each day, and now she is 
seeing upward of 70 families. Food 
prices have gone through the roof. It is 
more expensive for her to get food to 
give to people hurting at the very time 
demand is up. This is the reality for 
families and small businesses all across 
America, and vaccine mandates do 
nothing but make these problems even 
worse. 
I can’t imagine why, just when our 
country is working to get back on its 
feet, the President of the United States 
would be pushing policies that kill 
jobs, but that is exactly what he is 
doing. Now lockdown-loving Dr. Fauci 
and President Biden want to double 
down on their insane mandates and are 
considering forcing every American 
who wants to fly to show proof of vac-
cine before boarding an airplane. This 
is just another Orwellian response from 
the Biden administration and radical 
Democrats that does nothing to pro-
tect the American people. 
Providing 
information 
about 
the 
virus, providing tests, supporting vac-
cine and therapy developments, and 
getting the economy back on track 
should be the only role of the Federal 
Government in this pandemic. 
Congress has to take a stand and pro-
tect the American people from these

communist China-style policies that 
are meant to divide us. That is why a 
few months ago, I introduced the Pre-
vent Unconstitutional Vaccine Man-
dates for Interstate Commerce Act. 
The bill would prevent Federal Agen-
cies, like the Department of Transpor-
tation and Department of Commerce, 
from requiring proof of vaccination for 
companies trying to do business across 
State lines. 
Importantly, it would block the Fed-
eral Government from making airline 
passengers show proof of vaccine before 
catching a flight, which is exactly 
what Dr. Fauci wants to do. 
This bill also protects truckers and 
will ensure that the Biden administra-
tion can’t ruin our supply chains even 
more. Our truckers are the key to fix-
ing Biden’s supply chain crisis, and we 
should do everything we can to protect 
them. 
President 
Biden 
has 
continually 
showed us his track record of failed 
policies and a mandate for domestic 
airline passengers would only add to 
his growing failures and blame shift-
ing. We saw it in his failed and deadly 
withdrawal from Afghanistan. We have 
seen 
his 
administration’s 
complete 
failure to handle the crisis across the 
southern border. We see it every day in 
President Biden’s inability to fight in-
flation by stopping reckless spending. 
We continue to see his failure and com-
plete void of leadership in how this ad-
ministration is fighting COVID–19. 
Now, I am sure my Democrat col-
leagues will say that this legislation 
isn’t needed because at this exact mo-
ment, there is not a vaccine mandate 
to fly on a plane, but they said the 
same thing last year when we tried to 
preemptively block vaccine mandates 
for private businesses. They claimed 
the President has committed not to do 
that. We know the President broke 
that promise. 
The American people deserve better 
than politicians who continue to mis-
lead them on the Federal Government’s 
failures to fight COVID properly. The 
back-and-forth has to end. 
We must end these ridiculous, uncon-
stitutional vaccine mandates and focus 
on getting our economy back on track. 
That is why, as I mentioned earlier, 
the U.S. Senate passed a Congressional 
Review Act measure to invalidate 
President Biden’s vaccine mandate on 
a bipartisan basis. The Senate, along 
with 
the 
majority 
of 
Americans, 
doesn’t believe that the Federal Gov-
ernment should force people to choose 
between taking the vaccine and losing 
their job. That is why I am again de-
manding that the Federal Government 
stop trying to force the American peo-
ple to follow draconian, job-killing 
mandates that hurt families. 
This is the second time I have come 
to the floor to try to pass this bill and 
protect the rights of American families 
and businesses. I would like to thank 
Senators CYNTHIA LUMMIS, RON JOHN-
SON, MIKE LEE, and ROGER MARSHALL 
for joining me in introducing this im-
portant and urgently needed legisla-
tion. This is a commonsense bill, and I 
hope all my colleagues will support it. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 2895 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. 
I further ask that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Reserving the right 
to object, my colleague is right—he has 
been to the floor to talk about this 
issue, and I don’t think, though, that 
he has all the facts right. 
We just had a major transportation 
hearing in the Commerce Committee 
before we left for the holiday recess, 
and we heard from airline executives— 
some who had implemented their own 
vaccines, some who had implemented 
other mandates and systems on their 
own, and others who basically re-
sponded to the Federal Government’s 
desire to say that passengers would be 
required to wear masks. All of them 
said that this was a big success. All of 
them said that this, along with the 
Federal dollars that went into pre-
serving the airlines, allowed us and our 
economy to recover better than other 
nations had; basically that when the 
upswing in transportation got to the 
point where people felt it was safe to 
travel, that those mechanisms them-
selves helped us have an airline sector 
and industry that could respond so that 
we literally, by Thanksgiving, were up 
to 85, 90 percent of where we had been 
the previous year. 
So my colleague, I think, would like 
us to predetermine today exactly ev-
erything we are going to do on this 
issue; that we would prohibit the Presi-
dent, the Department of Transpor-
tation, Amtrak, and the Transpor-
tation Security Administration from 
making these decisions in the future. 
Now, I can just tell you, I get up 
every day and I read the press. I also 
went to the gym today, and the first 
thing they said is, Where is your vac-
cination card or we are not letting you 
in? So there is the fact that busi-
nesses—the airlines and small busi-
nesses—are using this as a tool. Even 
though DC has the highest explosion of 
COVID cases in the Nation as a per-
centage right now—I understand that 
in the neighborhood I live in, there was 
a pretty hearty New Year’s Eve, but ev-
erybody had to show a vaccination card 
to get into those businesses. Those 
businesses decided they were going to 
stay open. Those consumers decided 
they were going to participate—not the 
choice I would have made, but they de-
cided to do that, and they showed their 
vaccination card. 
So these businesses, the ones that 
the Federal Government is involved 
in—Amtrak and our transportation 
system—they also might have further 
issues in the future that they want to 
look at, so why pass a bill today that 
restricts them from showing proof of 
COVID vaccine in order to travel? 
The proposals that were made at the 
time—we didn’t really know 2 years 
ago now what was going to happen. But 
I can say—and that is why we had our 
most recent hearings—that we were 
right that the transportation sector 
was going to be critical to helping us 
fight the pandemic, that it was going 
to be critical for us to respond in our 
economy, and that it was going to be 
critical to providing essential services 
to some areas of the United States. The 
things we did allowed that air service 
to respond, and those business leaders 
showed up. In fact, one of them made a 
little mistake and said: Oh, you know, 
I think HEPA filters have really, really 
good responses, and maybe we don’t 
need anything. 
Well, he corrected that the next day. 
He corrected it the next day. He said: 
Oh, yeah, yeah, by the way, I believed 
in the mask mandate and still do. 
An airline executive was questioned 
by some of my colleagues, who said: 
Why did you implement your own vac-
cine mandate of your employees? 
He said: Because I wanted to have a 
workforce, and this is the best way I 
could get this workforce. 
So this isn’t a clear-cut issue, but I 
know, right now, why should we pro-
hibit Amtrak or anybody from a deci-
sion that some of these small busi-
nesses are making right in this neigh-
borhood, here in DC or probably Balti-
more? My colleague has just joined us 
on the Senate floor. These people are 
making these decisions, and all we are 
saying is that the Federal Government, 
instead of passing Senator SCOTT’s bill, 
should also have that decision in the 
future in their toolbox if they so 
choose. Why? Because the movement of 
commerce and transportation is so im-
portant to our infrastructure. It is so 
important to us as a nation to keep it 
going. I don’t want to preclude any of 
the tools in the toolbox at this mo-
ment. 
So therefore, Mr. President, I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The objection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. First off, I 
want to make sure my colleague under-
stands what this bill would do. This 
bill would prevent Federal Agencies, 
like the Department of Transportation 
and the Department of Commerce, 
from requiring proof of vaccination for 
companies trying to do business across 
State lines. 
So what this bill does is say that the 
Federal Government is not going to 
mandate this. If a private business 
wants to say that you have to have a 
vaccine to come in, that is a decision 
that private business gets to make. But 
government shouldn’t be in the posi-
tion to tell a new business that they 
have to require a vaccine. I mean, that 
is not what you do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S40 
January 5, 2022 
What this does do is it is killing jobs. 
It is killing people and killing the jobs 
of people who worked their tail off in 
the prior 12 months. 
Now, I don’t know why this is con-
troversial. The Senate, on a bipartisan 
basis, just passed a Congressional Re-
view Act measure striking down Presi-
dent Biden’s vaccine mandate. On a bi-
partisan basis we already decided we 
don’t believe in what the President is 
doing. 
We have got families and businesses 
all across this country that are strug-
gling to keep up with the cost of infla-
tion, and the government should be 
doing everything it can to reduce infla-
tion and get the economy going. 
Look, I know what it is like to go 
hungry because groceries cost too 
much. I watched my mom and my dad 
struggle for years. When prices rose, 
my mom took in odd jobs. When she 
struggled, we didn’t have as much food 
on the table. 
It is the responsibility of the Federal 
Government to improve the economy 
and help families get ahead. We know 
the vaccine mandates are absolutely 
causing prices to rise. When prices rise, 
people are getting hurt, and they are 
making interstate commerce much 
more difficult. 
So instead of taking action to help 
families and curb inflation, the Biden 
Administration is taking every pos-
sible step to make it harder for them 
to put food on the table and afford to 
live in this country. 
The President has already said that 
this must be handled at the State level. 
I agree. And the Federal Government 
can take a step in this direction by en-
suring vaccine passports won’t be re-
quired for interstate commerce. 
They shouldn’t be required to get on 
a plane. They shouldn’t be required to 
carry goods across State lines. 
Even our Nation’s healthcare pro-
viders know that mandates don’t work. 
They stopped doing it in most cases. 
Just last month we saw hospitals 
across this country delay or suspend 
their vaccine mandates because they 
knew it was killing jobs. 
We know that Biden’s unconstitu-
tional mandates are going to make it 
more difficult to retain staff and de-
liver quality care to their patients. I 
don’t understand why my colleague 
wants to give the government more 
power, more power, more power—up-
holding regulations that are causing 
prices to rise and forcing people to 
choose between keeping their jobs and 
getting a vaccine. 
We ought to give people the freedom 
to live their lives, to do exactly what 
my colleague just said: If a business 
wants to require a vaccine, they should 
require that. But if they don’t, the gov-
ernment shouldn’t be doing that. Our 
government should be giving people in-
formation, and let them make the deci-
sions they want to make. 
I trust American families. I trust 
American businesses. They are smart 
enough to make informed decisions 
about their health. But my colleague’s 
objection is bad for American families 
and bad for business owners, and I hope 
she will reconsider her objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
ANNIVERSARY OF JANUARY 6 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, tomor-
row will mark the first anniversary of 
one of the darkest moments in our Na-
tion’s history. One year ago tomorrow, 
a mob attacked this building. A mob of 
Americans, incited by a sitting U.S. 
President, was determined to prevent 
the peaceful transition of power that is 
the hallmark of our representative de-
mocracy. A mob of Americans savagely 
attacked and overwhelmed the men 
and women of the U.S. Capitol Police 
and the Metropolitan Police depart-
ments, smashed their way into this sa-
cred space, and disrupted the joint ses-
sion of Congress fulfilling its constitu-
tional duty to count the electoral col-
lege ballots awarding the Presidency to 
Joe Biden. 
January 6, like December 7 and Sep-
tember 11, is a date which will live in 
infamy. 
I refer to the U.S. Capitol as a sacred 
space because it is so much more than 
a building where the Senate and House 
of Representatives meet and conduct 
business. It is the embodiment of our 
ideals, our aspirations and hopes, not 
just to Americans but also to all of hu-
manity. 
In the 1960 essay on ‘‘national pur-
pose’’ for the New York Times and 
LIFE magazine, Archibald MacLeish 
wrote: 
There are those who will say that the lib-
eration of humanity, the freedom of man and 
mind is nothing but a dream. They are right. 
It is the American Dream. 
Insurrectionists desecrated this sa-
cred space and everything it stands for, 
including liberty, self-government and 
the rule of law. The Architect of the 
Capitol can measure the damage they 
did to this building in millions of dol-
lars. The damage they did to our moral 
standing in the world is inestimable. 
I want to take this moment to ac-
knowledge and pay tribute to the thou-
sands of people who work in Congress 
or cover it for the press and continue 
to suffer from the trauma of January 
the 6th. I am talking about the brave 
police officers who protected us. They 
engaged in a battle that one officer de-
scribed as ‘‘medieval.’’ 
And 140 of them, including Metropoli-
tan Police Department officers, suf-
fered physical injuries. One of them, 
Officer Brian Sicknick, died. I imagine 
all the officers who defended the Cap-
itol bear the psychological scars of the 
attack. 
Four officers—Howard Liebengood, 
Jeffrey Smith, Gunther Hashida, and 
Kyle DeFreytag committed suicide in 
the aftermath. But I am also talking 
about the staff who work here in the 
Capitol, in the Senate and House 
Chambers: the doorkeepers, the Parlia-
mentarian’s office, the bill clerk, the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD staff, the floor 
and cloakroom staff, and so many oth-
ers. Many of them had to shelter in 
place. They had to barricade them-
selves in offices, hoping the police 
would get to them before the insurrec-
tionists did. 
I am talking about the committee 
and legislative staff in our DC offices 
and back in our State and district of-
fices, who watched the attack in horror 
and disbelief and feared for the safety 
of their friends and colleagues, who an-
swer the phones and hear death threats 
and obscenities. 
I am talking about the food service 
workers, custodial staff, and other Ar-
chitect of the Capitol and Sergeant at 
Arms employees who were caught in 
the mayhem and then immediately 
went to work cleaning up the mess, re-
pairing the damage, and providing 
other essential services, all in the 
midst of a raging pandemic. 
I am talking about those reporters 
who documented the insurrection at 
great 
personal 
peril 
after 
Donald 
Trump spent the previous 4 years call-
ing them the enemies of the people and 
openly encouraged his supporters to at-
tack them at his rallies. 
Congress could not function without 
this community of patriotic and hard- 
working Americans. This community is 
hurting. On New Year’s Day, the Wash-
ington Post ran an article entitled 
‘‘Shaken by the Jan. 6 attack, Capitol 
workers quit jobs that once made them 
proud.’’ ‘‘Quit jobs that once made 
them proud’’—what a terrible thing, 
what a loss to our Nation. 
The danger our Nation faced on Jan-
uary 6 has not dissipated. As the New 
York Times editorial board stated a 
few days ago, ‘‘the Republic faces an 
existential threat from a movement 
that is openly contemptuous of democ-
racy and has shown that it is willing to 
use violence to achieve its ends.’’ 
The leader of this movement, of 
course, is Donald Trump. The orga-
nizing principle is the Big Lie that 
Democrats ‘‘stole’’ the election. The 
mindset is what historian Richard 
Hofstadter called ‘‘the paranoid style 
in American politics,’’ which ‘‘produces 
. . . strivings for evidence to prove 
that the unbelievable is the only thing 
that can be believed.’’ 
The response to nearly nonexistent 
voter fraud is to engage in massive 
voter suppression. The objective is not 
election reform; it is election repeal. 
It is important to understand that 
the insurrection on January 6 was not 
a spontaneous event. As Ed Kilgore 
wrote in a New York magazine article 
entitled ‘‘Trump’s Long Campaign to 
Steal the Presidency: A timeline,’’ 
‘‘The insurrection was a complex, 
years-long plot, not a one-day event. 
And it isn’t over.’’ 
Rightwing media personalities and 
QAnon conspiracy followers feverishly 
and cynically stoke the movement for 
their own gain. Elected Republican of-
ficials, 
fearful 
of 
Donald 
Trump’s 
wrath or eager to curry favor with him, 
enable it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S41 
January 5, 2022 
In 1950, Republican Senator Margaret 
Chase Smith of Maine issued her ‘‘Dec-
laration of Conscience’’ in response to 
another authoritarian bully, fellow Re-
publican Senator Joe McCarthy of Wis-
consin. Senator SMITH was no fan of 
the Truman administration, but she 
said the following: 
[T]o displace it with a Republican re-
gime embracing a philosophy that 
lacks political integrity or intellectual 
honesty would prove equally disastrous 
to the nation. . . . I do not want to see 
the Republican party ride to political 
victory on the Four Horsemen of Cal-
umny—Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry, and 
Smear. I doubt if the Republican party 
could do so, simply because I do not be-
lieve the American people will uphold 
any political party that puts political 
exploitation above national interest. 
Surely we Republicans are not that 
desperate for victory. 
I do not want to see the Republican party 
win that way. While it might be a fleeting 
victory for the Republican party, it would be 
a more lasting defeat for the American peo-
ple. Surely it would ultimately be suicide for 
the Republican party and the two-party sys-
tem that has protected our American lib-
erties from the dictatorship of a one-party 
system. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
follow the example of Margaret Chase 
Smith. There is nothing conservative 
about advocating force over the rule of 
law. There is nothing conservative 
about pledging loyalty to a man over 
upholding the U.S. Constitution. 
I understand that many Americans 
are disinclined to believe that the 
President of the United States would 
blatantly lie to them, but it is exactly 
what Donald Trump has been doing 
since he claimed that millions of peo-
ple who voted illegally cost him the 
popular vote majority in the 2016 elec-
tion. In fact, his lies go back even fur-
ther, to his vile birther claims about 
President Obama. 
We have the opportunity and the im-
perative for a course correction to save 
our Republic, and that is to restore, ex-
pand, and protect voting rights. 
The Senate must consider S. 2747, the 
Freedom to Vote Act, and S. 4, the bi-
partisan John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. 
On multiple occasions, Senate Demo-
crats voted unanimously just to begin 
considering these bills to protect peo-
ple’s right to vote, which has come 
under sustained assault. Each time we 
have tried to proceed to these meas-
ures, every Republican Senator has 
voted to sustain a filibuster. Senate 
Republicans put gridlock and partisan-
ship before the rights of voters. They 
are blocking the Senate from having a 
chance to consider options and amend-
ments and do what the Founding Fa-
thers intended us to do: debate and leg-
islate. 
Within the next few days, our Repub-
lican colleagues in the Senate will 
have yet another opportunity, a chance 
to do the right thing. Many Senators 
have worked diligently to come up 
with compromise legislation that still 
preserves the essential elements of S. 1, 
For the People Act, that the House of 
Representatives has already passed. 
And President Biden is absolutely 
correct that we need to enact voting 
rights legislation to repair the damage 
the Supreme Court did to the Voting 
Rights Act. President Biden rightly 
calls efforts to limit ballot access 
across the country as a 21st century 
Jim Crow assault. He warned Ameri-
cans that the Republican efforts to re-
strict voting rights as a result of their 
selfish challenge of the 2020 election re-
sults represent ‘‘the most significant 
test of our democracy since the Civil 
War.’’ 
In many States, Republican legisla-
tures and Governors have responded to 
the falsehoods of the 2020 election by 
restricting voting accessibility. Donald 
Trump’s Big Lie has directly led to dis-
enfranchisement and suppression of the 
right to vote of millions of Americans. 
I urge my colleagues and my fellow 
American citizens to reflect on the 
state of our democracy and the rights 
we hold so dear. A blatant attempt to 
falsify an election and persistent ef-
forts to deny the American people ac-
cess to the ballot box has eroded Amer-
ican democracy to a dangerous level 
and undermined the freedom and lib-
erty that so many Americans have 
fought to defend and advance. 
After elections are over and we win, 
we celebrate. We celebrate the fact 
that we have garnered the support of 
the majority of the voters. If we don’t 
win—I think many of us have been in-
volved in campaigns where our can-
didates have not been successful—we 
go to work and try to attract more vot-
ers in the next election so we can cele-
brate a victory. That is what participa-
tion in a free society is all about. That 
is what democracies are about. 
And repressive, autocratic regimes 
never accept the will of the people so 
they look at ways in which they can 
undermine the voting record, what the 
voters want, and the voters’ will. 
We should all celebrate the record 
number of people who cast their ballots 
in the 2020 Presidential election. More 
Americans cast their votes for the 
Presidential candidate than ever be-
fore. 
After the election, both Democrats 
and Republicans conducted numerous 
reviews at the Federal, State, and local 
levels. Those reviews verified the sim-
ple fact that there was no widespread 
corruption or election fraud; that the 
will of the people prevailed; and Joe 
Biden and Kamala Harris were duly 
elected. 
Congress and Vice President Pence 
counted the electoral votes for Presi-
dent and Vice President and did their 
duty under the Constitution on Janu-
ary 6, notwithstanding the armed in-
surrection at the Capitol. 
But that did not stop Donald Trump 
from promoting the Big Lie, and that, 
in turn, has prompted Republican-led 
States to make it harder for people to 
cast their votes. The Brennan Center 
has pointed out that we are in the mid-
dle of the worst assault on voting 
rights since Jim Crow. 
So what are these laws doing? They 
are making it more difficult for people 
to register to vote. They are making it 
more difficult to vote by mail. They 
are making it more difficult to vote in 
person. Republicans apparently believe 
that demographic trends will prevent 
them from winning elections so they 
are surgically attacking the voting 
rights of people—mostly people of 
color—they believe will not vote for 
them. 
We have States that have 100 percent 
voting by mail. There has been no indi-
cation of fraud in voting by mail. But 
now, some States have shortened the 
time for requesting mail-in ballots, 
making it more difficult for individuals 
to vote by mail. They are making it 
more difficult for people to deliver 
their ballots by limiting the avail-
ability of ballot drop boxes, all because 
they think that will be utilized more 
by people who will not vote for them. 
The Republicans in charge of these 
States want to make it harder for peo-
ple to vote in person too—stricter sig-
nature 
requirements, 
reducing 
the 
number of places where people can 
vote, purging voter rolls simply be-
cause a person didn’t vote, and the list 
goes on and on and on; all of these 
making it more difficult for people to 
register to vote or be eligible to vote 
who are more likely to vote for their 
opponents. Some of these States are 
even opening up the possibility that 
election officials can substitute their 
judgment for the will of the people. 
The Freedom to Vote Act provides a 
basic Federal floor on protecting the 
right to vote. The legislation includes 
commonsense items such as automatic 
and online voter registration, uniform 
early voting, same-day voter registra-
tion, voting by mail and drop box 
standards and uniform national stand-
ards for voter identification. 
The Freedom to Vote Act ends polit-
ical gerrymandering by creating non-
partisan redistricting commissions, re-
quires voter-verified paper ballots and 
reliable audits, and ends the dominance 
of Big Money in political systems by 
increasing disclosure and transparency. 
S. 2747 includes two provisions I au-
thored: First, it includes the Democ-
racy Restoration Act, which deals with 
laws that many States passed at the 
end of the Civil War that are still on 
the books that disqualify a person con-
victed of a felony from voting for the 
rest of his or her life. The definition of 
‘‘felony’’ can be quite general in many 
States so the impact of these laws fall 
disproportionately on people of color, 
which was its intent. There are States 
where one out of five Black Americans 
have been disqualified from voting be-
cause of a felony conviction, even when 
that individual has served his or her 
sentence and has returned to society. 
We need to remove that disqualifica-
tion on voting.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S42 
January 5, 2022 
I am proud that S. 2747 also includes 
my Deceptive Practices and Voter In-
timidation Prevention Act. Spreading 
false or misleading information or in-
timidating the electorate remain regu-
larly employed and effective methods 
to keep individuals, particularly Black 
Americans and racial minorities, from 
voting. Advancements in communica-
tions, including the rise of social media 
platforms, have made it easier for bad 
actors to use these strategies. My pro-
visions prohibit individuals from know-
ingly deceiving voters about the time, 
place, eligibility or procedures of par-
ticipating in a Federal election. It 
criminalizes 
intentional 
efforts 
to 
hinder, interfere with, or prevent an-
other person from voting, registering 
to vote, or aiding another person to 
vote or register to vote. 
The late John Lewis of Georgia was a 
dear friend and a former colleague. We 
first won election to the U.S. House of 
Representatives on the same day. Rep-
resentative Lewis recalled an impor-
tant lesson that he learned from the 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
when he said that ‘‘each of us has a 
moral obligation to stand up, speak up, 
and speak out. When you see some-
thing that is not right, you must say 
something. You must do something. 
Democracy is not a state. It is an act. 
And each generation must do its part.’’ 
Well, we need to follow Congressman 
Lewis’ admonition. We can do our part 
by passing the bipartisan John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act, S. 4. 
Congress has a historic and bipartisan 
tradition of coming together across 
party lines to safeguard and strengthen 
the right to vote, which is the bedrock 
of our democracy. 
Congress passed and the States rati-
fied the 15th Amendment after the 
Civil War, which declared that ‘‘the 
rights of citizens of the United States 
to vote should not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by 
any State on account of race, color, or 
previous condition of servitude.’’ 
The 15th Amendment also states that 
Congress—Congress—has the power to 
enforce this article by appropriate leg-
islation. 
That is exactly what the Senate is 
trying to do with the John Lewis legis-
lation. The bill would restore key pro-
visions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
that the Supreme Court severely weak-
ened in its Shelby County v. Holder de-
cision. 
Fifty-seven years ago, Congress de-
signed the Voting Rights Act to pro-
tect equal access to elections for all el-
igible Americans and passed the meas-
ure to respond to widespread disenfran-
chisement—particularly of racial and 
language minorities—between the post- 
Civil War period and the 1960s. 
S. 4 would require the Federal pre- 
clearance for certain changes to voting 
laws and procedures. It would block 
changes that restrict the right to vote, 
particularly changes that dispropor-
tionately disenfranchise minority com-
munities. The bill would allow plain-
tiffs and the Justice Department to 
bring lawsuits that deny or abridge the 
voting rights of minority voters and re-
store legal tools needed to enforce na-
tionwide, permanent Federal bans on 
voter suppression efforts targeting mi-
norities. 
We cannot pass voting rights legisla-
tion as long as the Senate Republicans 
continue to filibuster even just to pro-
ceed to S. 2747 and S. 4. Inaction on 
voting rights is not an option as we 
prepare for our 2022 elections, which 
must be free and fair so that the Amer-
ican people have faith in our elections 
and their outcomes, particularly after 
the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on 
January 6. 
We need to change the filibuster rule. 
As President Biden just said before the 
holidays, ‘‘If the only thing standing 
between getting voting rights legisla-
tion passed and not getting it passed is 
the filibuster, I support making the ex-
ception of voting rights for the fili-
buster.’’ 
I agree with President Biden. We can-
not take action to safeguard voting 
rights if we don’t start right now. 
States are already drawing their 2022 
political boundaries to comply with 
population changes from the 2020 cen-
sus, and we cannot start our work un-
less my colleagues allow us to proceed 
to this issue on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate. 
I urge my colleagues not to filibuster 
the right of the U.S. Senate to start 
the debate on protecting voter integ-
rity, where each Member will have the 
opportunity to debate the issue and 
offer amendments. Many Senators have 
offered suggestions about how we can 
improve these two voting rights bills. 
Collectively, we have a chance to come 
together for the American people, 
something they elected us to do. 
We will not reach a consensus if we 
cannot even proceed to the bills. I will 
support changing the Senate rules, re-
turning the Senate to its historic role 
of debating and voting on critical 
issues. 
Voting rights legislation needs to be 
debated in the Senate and voted upon 
by a majority vote in the U.S. Senate. 
Our noble experiment representing 
democracy is in grave danger. Let us 
come together and protect the integ-
rity of the Senate, respond to the 
threat we saw on January 6 of last 
year, and take up and pass voting 
rights legislation. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Massachusetts. 
ANNIVERSARY OF JANUARY 6 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, Janu-
ary 6, 2022, marks 1 year since the at-
tempted coup at our Nation’s Capitol. 
I am deeply grateful for the Capitol 
Police for their heroic acts on that 
dark day. The American people will al-
ways remember the sacrifices they 
made to protect our democracy. 
But marking this date has another 
purpose, too. The January 6 insurrec-
tion made painfully clear that Amer-
ican democracy is seriously at risk. In 
November of 2020, American citizens 
braved a deadly pandemic to cast their 
ballots. But following that election, 
the defeated President refused to com-
mit to a peaceful transfer of power. 
Instead, he falsely sowed doubt about 
the legitimacy of the election and in-
flamed his most dangerous supporters 
to attack this Capitol. His attempts to 
cling to power through lies and vio-
lence were a violation of his oath of of-
fice and a grave abuse of power that 
can never be tolerated in a free and 
democratic society. 
We mark this anniversary not only 
to reflect on that dereliction of duty, 
but also to call out the ongoing efforts 
to undermine our democracy. 
Threats to our democracy are not 
new. For years, in State after State, 
Republican legislatures have passed 
laws making it harder to vote, all on a 
purely partisan basis with simple ma-
jority votes. They have imposed strict 
voter ID requirements and purged 
voter rolls to disenfranchise minority 
voters. They have made it harder to 
vote by mail and register to vote. They 
have gerrymandered districts for par-
tisan political gain. 
Over the past year, these shameless 
efforts have become even more brazen. 
Just as the former President was clear 
that he wanted to overturn the results 
of the 2020 election, Trump and his al-
lies are entirely transparent about 
their goal of overturning future elec-
tions. Today, Republican opponents of 
democracy are exploiting every pos-
sible avenue to allow their party to 
maintain control, even if that means 
overturning the will of the American 
people. 
Rather than putting a stop to these 
attacks on voting rights, the Supreme 
Court has enabled them. The Roberts 
Court gutted the core of the Voting 
Rights Act, which is why Republican 
legislatures right now can pass anti- 
voter laws with ease. 
Last year, they destroyed what was 
left of the country’s landmark voting 
rights law, making it nearly impossible 
to block laws with racially discrimina-
tory effects. They twice overturned 
key protections against dark money in 
our elections, and they gave a green 
light to partisan gerrymandering. 
The Senate must not turn a blind eye 
while the Federal judiciary and State 
legislatures lead an all-out assault 
against free and fair elections in Amer-
ica. It is clear that Donald Trump’s Re-
publican Party is embracing an in-
creasingly authoritarian movement. 
In 2006, the Voting Rights Act was re-
authorized unanimously in the U.S. 
Senate. And yet today, only one Re-
publican supports the Voting Rights 
Act, and none have endorsed the Free-
dom to Vote Act. The Senate filibuster 
means that MITCH MCCONNELL gets a 
veto and Congress cannot protect the 
sacred right to vote unless Republican 
politicians agree, all while they are ac-
tively undermining our democracy in 
State after State.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S43 
January 5, 2022 
My view on this is simple: We did not 
swear an oath to protect a procedural 
rule like the filibuster, which has been 
the tool of racial segregation and Jim 
Crow. No, we swore an oath to defend 
the Constitution. When the Senate 
rules stand in the way of voting rights 
legislation, then those Senate rules 
must change. 
A year after an insurrection at our 
Nation’s Capitol, we must do more 
than speak up about the importance of 
democracy. Now, we must act. It is 
time to end the filibuster, time to pro-
tect voting rights, and time to defend 
our democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, all 
the Republican members of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee sent Attorney 
General Garland two letters about the 
Justice Department’s involvement in 
local school board matters. 
The first one was in October. Then in 
December, we asked why the FBI’s 
counterterrorism division was getting 
involved in parents’ expressing their 
concerns at school board meetings. 
Now, just to be crystal clear, there is 
no excuse for real threats or acts of vi-
olence at school board meetings, but if 
there is such threats, these should be 
handled at the local level, and the At-
torney General should withdraw his 
memo that started this whole thing off. 
Well, a couple days before Christmas, 
the Justice Department responded to 
us Republican members of the Judici-
ary Committee with a single-page let-
ter. In that letter, the Department of 
Justice had nothing to say about why 
the FBI’s counterterrorism division 
was involved in local school board mat-
ters. The Department of Justice just 
simply said ‘‘We’re not going to with-
draw the memo.’’ 
So the Feds may be keeping track of 
school board meetings, even if it cre-
ates a horrible chilling effect at those 
meetings and maybe even discourages 
people from coming to those meetings. 
And, of course, the FBI looking over 
your shoulder would then have a 
chilling effect. 
Now, next week, the Senate Judici-
ary Committee will hold a hearing on 
domestic terrorism, and I hope the 
committee will be focusing on the seri-
ous threats facing our country, and I 
hope no one thinks the focus is going 
to be on our Nation’s parents. 
School boards have to be accountable 
to the parents and the taxpayers that 
they serve. Some school boards across 
the country are still shutting down 
classes, even though vaccines have 
been available for a long time and dra-
matically reduce the chances of major 
illness to teachers. 
Meanwhile, millions of kids across 
the country are struggling to catch up. 
They are under enormous stress from 
being separated, one kid from their 
friends in the classroom or in the 
school building. Schools are seeing far 
more behavioral problems than they 
ever have before. 
Parents, then, are right to be con-
cerned about these situations in their 
local schools, and it is their right to 
ask questions. They should be telling 
their school board districts that they 
want to see changes. But will they see 
changes or will they be afraid to speak 
up at school board meetings? Will the 
FBI’s 
counterterrorism 
division 
be 
keeping track of them as parents ask 
for changes from their school boards? 
The Department of Justice owes the 
American people a better answer than 
just a single-page letter that says 
nothing about why the FBI’s counter-
terrorism division is involved in local 
school board matters. 
Now, more than ever, parents should 
be their kids’ strongest and their kids’ 
best advocates. They have a God-given 
right to do so. And, of course, the Jus-
tice Department ought to be doing ev-
erything it can to protect that con-
stitutional right, not scare these par-
ents out of exercising their constitu-
tional right. 
Attorney General Garland should 
withdraw his memo, and he should 
take Congress’ oversight and concerns 
for parental rights more seriously. 
VIOLENT CRIME 
Mr. President, on another matter and 
the last issue I am going to speak to, I 
want to visit with my colleagues on 
the continuing rise of violent crime 
across the country. 
We have all heard about the unprece-
dented 30-percent spike in murders 
that began in the summer of 2020. It 
continues to this very day. Over a 
dozen cities set new homicide records 
in the year just passed. 
The rise of violent crimes coincides 
with the defund the police movement 
and widespread de-policing. Cutting po-
lice 
budgets 
combined 
with 
an 
antipolice sentiment fostered by local 
elected officials has led to violence 
against our police officers, so we have 
seen a dramatic increase in on-duty 
deaths in the last year. 
I want to quote the Fraternal Order 
of Police. That organization says that 
63 officers were murdered and 346 offi-
cers were shot. This organization also 
reported ambush-style attacks on law 
enforcement officers spiked 115 percent 
from 2020. The FBI has reported that 
unprovoked attacks against officers in 
which the officers had no official con-
tact with the offender prior to the at-
tack ‘‘continued to outpace all cir-
cumstances 
of 
felonious 
officers’ 
death.’’ 
Other forms of violent crime are also 
up, as police are forced to retreat from 
the streets, including carjackings. Chi-
cago saw 1,646 carjackings, compared 
to 603 incidents in 2019. Minneapolis 
Police report that carjacking shot up 
by 537 percent. Carjackings in New Or-
leans have doubled since 2019. Oakland 
Police say carjackings increased by 85 
percent. Washington, DC, reports a 141- 
percent increase from last year. In 
Louisville, KY, carjackings have in-
creased 185 percent. And similar re-
ports come out of cities across the 
country. 
So, 
you 
see, 
criminals 
are 
emboldened by what is going on in our 
country, either through not showing 
respect for law enforcement or from ef-
forts to cut the budgets of police de-
partments. 
Flash mobs—another sort of new 
lingo that is just new because of the in-
crease in crime—flash mobs have made 
large organized smash-and-grab rob-
beries a way of life in many cities. You 
have seen this on television—break 
down the doors, go in with the ham-
mers, steal everything you can, do it 
within 2 or 3 minutes, and get out of 
there. So in Los Angeles, San Fran-
cisco, Chicago, New York, Boston, 
Houston, Atlanta, Sacramento, Balti-
more, Las Vegas, and Seattle, groups of 
dozens make off with hundreds of thou-
sands in merchandise. 
I requested a briefing from the De-
partment of Justice and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security on these 
organized retail crime groups. 
This rise in violent crime ought to be 
unacceptable to everybody, and I am 
stepping up to find solutions to these 
issues. 
This past December, Chairman DUR-
BIN of the Judiciary Committee held a 
field hearing in Chicago concerning 
gun trafficking and violent crime. I 
submitted questions for witnesses con-
cerning the crisis level of carjackings, 
the terrible attacks on police, like the 
murder of Chicago Police Officer Ella 
French, and failed policies in blue cit-
ies that allow violent crime to con-
tinue. 
I hope the Judiciary Committee will 
hold a full committee hearing here in 
Washington on the spike in violence 
and the challenges that law enforce-
ment is facing, including ineffective 
bail policies, the cumbersome restraint 
on police officers, and the impact of 
the progressive prosecutor movement. 
Every minority member of the com-
mittee, led by myself as ranking mem-
ber, has written to the chairman to re-
quest that we do have this hearing. I 
look forward to working with him on 
setting that up. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
looking for ways that we can do more 
to 
combat 
violent 
crime—from 
carjackings, to organized retail crime, 
to an unspeakable rise in murders and 
the murders of police officers. Let’s 
have a hearing where we can learn 
more about these trends and how we 
can support police officers. Let’s look 
for ways that we can strengthen Fed-
eral criminal laws and Agencies to 
fight this violent crime. We can’t con-
tinue down this path or it is going to 
lead to vigilante law enforcement. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, it 
was 2 years ago this month that I stood 
on the floor of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and was the first person to 
speak about a novel coronavirus, soon 
to be called COVID–19. Two years ago, 
I had been reading about this virus for 
several weeks, and something in my 
gut as a physician told me this was not 
going to be a common cold. I chatted 
with the CDC, and I implored them to 
start doing research on the origins of 
the virus, asking ‘‘Was it from nature 
or from a laboratory?’’ and that we 
needed to work on vaccines, thera-
peutics, and testing. 
As we all know, the development of 
an American vaccine, thanks to Oper-
ation Warp Speed, was successful. As 
for the testing, we know the CDC fum-
bled it, but the private sector saved us. 
And therapeutics? Not so much. Thera-
peutics have never been a priority for 
this administration. 
As we return to our Nation’s Capital, 
I would venture to say that very few 
Americans didn’t have somebody in 
their families catch Omicron, and my 
family was no different. We shared the 
same experience as millions of other 
Americans did. Despite being vac-
cinated, one of my loved ones with un-
derlying healthcare conditions caught 
the Omicron virus. As I saw my loved 
one start having asthma, wheezing, and 
become short of breath, I did what 
every spouse would do and said: Well, 
we need to go get tested. We need to 
talk to a doctor. 
So we drove to several testing sites, 
and we had the option of standing in 
line for 3 or 4 hours with sick people. If 
we didn’t have the Omicron, we cer-
tainly would have by the time we left. 
We called around and finally were able 
to get an appointment the next day for 
testing. 
I am not sure if you have ever seen a 
person with asthma, but you can see 
the distress in their face as they 
wheeze, 
as 
they 
become 
short 
of 
breath. This is something with which I 
am all too familiar. I have taken care 
of 
thousands 
of 
women, 
pregnant 
women, with asthma. I have been in 
the emergency room with them, having 
to admit them to the ICU, and I knew 
that was the road that we were headed 
to. 
I called around, hoping to find some 
monoclonal antibodies—a place where 
we 
could 
go 
and 
we 
could 
get 
monoclonal antibodies. Then there is 
this new miracle of biotherapeutics out 
there. I thought, well, maybe we could 
get those, but none were to be had. 
In watching my wife continue to suf-
fer, I decided, you know, I think we 
need to do some type of telemedicine. 
So we called a doctor and set up a tele-
medicine 
visit—someone 
who 
had 
taken care of thousands of patients 
with the coronavirus. We did the ap-
pointment, 
and 
he 
prescribed 
Ivermectin for her. After the first tab-
let, it was a miracle. Within an hour, 
her 
labored 
breathing 
had 
settled 
down. By the next day, her second 
dose, she was almost completely better 
right before my eyes. 
Again, I remind everybody it has 
been 2 years since this pandemic start-
ed, and we still have limited access to 
therapeutics. Again, as we all know, 
the Biden administration’s approach to 
this is to put all of their eggs in one 
basket. They believed in a one-size-fits- 
all 
approach. 
Vaccine 
mandates, 
masks, and testing was their prescrip-
tion to getting us through this pan-
demic. All of those have had a place, 
and all of them have had some suc-
cesses, but when a million people in 1 
day are testing positive, it is not sur-
prising we can’t keep up with the test-
ing, and that is why we need thera-
peutics. 
In fact, the Federal Government has 
allocated over $80 billion for testing— 
$80 billion for testing—and only $15 bil-
lion for therapeutics. This is simply 
unacceptable. We are 2 years into this 
pandemic, and we have only spent $15 
billion on therapeutics. The Biden ad-
ministration should have already es-
tablished an Operation-Warp-Speed ap-
proach to the development, manufac-
turing, 
and 
distribution 
of 
thera-
peutics. 
It just always seems like this admin-
istration has been a day late and a dol-
lar short. For example, in mid-2021, we 
saw the Delta wave coming. We all 
knew it was coming, and we had real- 
world evidence in the summer of 2021 to 
suggest that a booster shot would be 
helpful for seniors and at-risk individ-
uals. It was in June of 2020 that I asked 
the CDC and the FDA to consider let-
ting physicians meet with their pa-
tients and prescribe a booster ahead of

January 5, 2022 
the Delta wave—again, in the summer 
of 2020. 
Unfortunately, the FDA waited until 
September 22 to approve the booster. 
Between June and September, more 
than 11,000 seniors died from break-
through infections, while more than 
230,000 people tested positive. No doubt, 
a booster and/or therapeutics could 
have made a big difference in these 
seniors’ lives. 
It is easy to talk about the mistakes 
we have made with this virus. I want to 
spend a moment talking about solu-
tions, though. 
We need to unleash our community 
health centers and our county health 
departments in this COVID–19 fight. 
They have been the backbone of vac-
cination and treatment for commu-
nicable diseases for decades. 
Once the Biden administration agrees 
to prioritize therapeutics, we need 
community health centers and county 
health departments to take over the 
telemedicine visits with trained nurses 
and implement treatment protocols 
across the United States. 
In Kansas alone, we have over 200 
community health centers and clinics 
funded with Federal dollars, along with 
over 100 local health departments that 
are accustomed to dealing with infec-
tious diseases on a daily basis. These 
folks can implement these protocols 
based upon triaging at-risk individuals 
and starting early treatment. This will 
prevent many trips to the ER, as well 
as hospitalizations. Early treatment is 
what works. 
Finally, and this goes without say-
ing, I trust these nurses to make nec-
essary 
referrals 
to 
the 
emergency 
room. They can do this. How do I know 
it? I have worked with these nurses for 
30 years. I helped sponsor—was the 
medical 
director 
for 
three 
county 
health 
departments 
for 
almost 
30 
years. They do an incredible job. They 
are well equipped to handle this effort, 
but they need the Biden administration 
to move on therapeutics and move fast. 
The medicines you could get for less 
than $100 can oftentimes prevent hos-
pitalizations and ICU visits. We need to 
give doctors the options of using thera-
peutics, along with steroids, anti- 
inflammatories, and other standard 
protocols that have been developed by 
these physicians who have treated lit-
erally thousands of COVID–19 patients. 
Certainly, if we have better access to 
monoclonal antibodies or if these new 
miracle antiviral agents were avail-
able, we could use them as well. But, 
please, let’s empower physicians and 
these health departments and commu-
nity health centers, these experienced 
nurses, to do their job. 
Time is precious. We cannot afford 
additional delays. We can’t afford more 
confusion, more mixed messaging, and 
more mixed management. The Biden 
administration must let patients and 
physicians decide what is best in their 
unique healthcare situation, not some-
body who is sitting on a throne in 
Washington, DC, who seldom sees pa-
tients in the real world. 
Thank you.

RECOGNIZING JANUARY 6 WORKERS 
Madam President, I want to start by 
thanking my colleagues Leader SCHU-
MER and Senator KLOBUCHAR for their 
work to honor the police officers who 
risked their lives to protect this coun-
try 1 year ago tomorrow. 
In the year since that dark day, we 
have learned more about all that those 
officers endured from the terrorists 
who stormed the Capitol—the racist 
slurs, the physical abuse, the mental 
injuries. We know things were so much 
worse than they appeared in the origi-
nal reporting as more and more details 
have come out. These terrorists gouged 
someone’s eyes out. They killed a Cap-
itol Police officer and injured 140 oth-
ers. They threatened to kill the Vice 
President. They brought a noose to the 
Capitol and paraded symbols of White 
supremacy. In fact, the people who 
broke into the office upstairs from my 
office in the Capitol—we have this on 
film—used flagpoles with Confederate 
flags and Trump flags attached to 
them. They brought equipment to take 
hostages. 
It wasn’t only Capitol Police officers 
who endured this attack and put their 
lives on the line serving our Republic 
on January 6. Workers throughout the 
Capitol risked everything that day, 
workers who do the radio and tele-
vision broadcast and work in the media 
center, workers who work the floor, 
workers who clean up, and workers 
who do food service. They often don’t 
get noticed, like the Capitol support 
staff. Every day, Capitol janitorial and 
maintenance and other workers, essen-
tial workers, do their jobs with skill 
and dedication and dignity. They have 
shown up for work during this pan-
demic. 
Those workers were here on January 
6 doing their jobs when the insurrec-
tionists, when the rioters, when the— 
call 
it 
what 
you 
want—traitors 
stormed this building, barging into this 
Chamber, acting as if no one would 
ever hold them responsible or account-
able for their violence, for their dis-
regard for American values and for 
U.S. laws. 
When the rampage was over, we know 
it was the largely Black and Brown 
custodial maintenance workers who 
were left to restore dignity to the Cap-
itol. Their work, first of all, allowed us 
to come back and continue our work at 
8 that night certifying the electoral 
votes and securing our democracy. As 
we 
know, 
domestic 
terrorists 
de-
stroyed; Black and Brown custodians 
cleaned up; and maintenance workers, 
carpenters, painters, and union mem-
bers rebuilt. Today, we honor them. 
Some of the most enduring and mov-
ing images of that day are the pictures 
of these workers sweeping up the mess 
that terrorists made in the people’s 
houses. 
That night, after we voted—the Sen-
ator from Minnesota was there. We 
were all here voting in this Chamber. 
After the police and the National 
Guard—the DC Police, the Capitol Po-
lice, and others—after they cleared the 
terrorists out of this building, we came 
back at 8 and voted. I spent the night 
in the basement in my office. I live a 
20-minute walk away. I really didn’t 
want to walk home that night. But I 
walked around about midnight, walked 
around this building, over in the House 
and the Senate. I saw the destruction. 
I saw the window right upstairs from 
me, the half-moon window that terror-
ists, with their flagpoles with their 
Confederate flags and their Trump 
flags attached, broke through. 
When I was back there at midnight 
that night, already the cleanup from 
the custodians had started, cleaning up 
after they had been threatened. After 
they had been called names as Black 
women, as immigrant women, after 
they had been called names by the ter-
rorists, they were back there cleaning 
up. Already, a carpenter had cut a half- 
moon piece of plywood and nailed it to 
that window to keep this building safe 
and keep the elements out. 
We honor those people today. It is 
what service looks like. It is what love 
of country looks like. It is what the 
dignity of work looks like. It tells you 
a lot about what is wrong with our 
economy. These essential workers—the 
people who prepare the food, the people 
who clean up, the people who provide 
security—the essential workers, like so 
many of their fellow service workers 
around this country, don’t make a lot 
of money. They don’t get much atten-
tion. They don’t get much reward. 
They don’t have much power. We sim-
ply don’t value and respect all work 
the way we should. 
I think of the words of Dr. King. One 
of my favorite Dr. King quotes is this: 
If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he 
should sweep streets even as Michelangelo 
painted, or Beethoven composed music, or 
Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep 
streets so well that all the hosts of heaven 
and earth will pause to say, ‘‘Here lived a 
great street sweeper who did his job well.’’ 
Dr. King said: 
No work is insignificant. All labor that up-
lifts humanity has dignity and importance. 
He later said that no job with ade-
quate compensation is menial. 
Look at the words of Pope Francis a 
few days ago in his Christmas Eve ad-
dress or think back 100 years, 120 years, 
to Pope Leo, the labor Pope, in Rerum 
Novarum, where he first introduced—at 
least in my view—first introduced the 
term, I assume in Latin, ‘‘dignity of 
work.’’ 
Pope Francis, in his Christmas Eve 
address just a few days ago, said: 
[God] reminds us of the importance of 
granting dignity to men and women through 
[their] labour, [and] also . . . granting dig-
nity to human labour itself. 
Those are Pope Francis’s words. 
No work is insignificant. All labor 
has dignity. We ought to treat it that

way, starting with honoring these 
workers. 
Last year, I joined my colleagues in a 
resolution to honor all the workers 
who 
risked 
their 
lives 
that 
day: 
custodians, maintenance workers, Cap-
itol Police officers, journalists, the 
floor staff, the workers in our offices. 
All of them served this country. All of 
them risked their safety to preserve 
our democracy. All of them deserve our 
gratitude. 
Today, though, or tomorrow, actu-
ally, but I will ask tonight because my 
colleagues—because 
of 
Senator 
Isakson’s funeral, many will be there 
tomorrow. I ask my colleagues to join 
me and Senators KLOBUCHAR and SCHU-
MER and Senators CASEY and BOOKER in 
a resolution honoring specifically the 
Capitol janitorial and maintenance 
staff—all essential workers—for their 
bravery and service to our country on 
January 6. 
One of my favorite parts of this job— 
and the Presiding Officer knows this 
because we have had these conversa-
tions and because of her appreciation 
for work and for the people who work 
so hard and get so little—one of the 
joys of this job is to do what Abraham 
Lincoln used to do. When staff wanted 
him to stay in the White House and 
win the war and free the slaves and 
preserve the Union, Lincoln said: No, I 
have to go out and get my public opin-
ion bath. 
One of the joys of this job is to talk 
to the workers here just about their 
lives or about what happened on Janu-
ary 6. One custodial worker and I were 
talking. She has been in this country 
for 30 years. She has been a citizen for 
20 years, and she has worked in this job 
for 30 years. She has been a citizen for 
20 years. She and a number of others 
were locked in a room where terrorists 
were pounding on the walls and were 
screaming racial epithets and were 
screaming anti-immigrant utterances, 
all of that. Yet she still works here. 
She was one of the ones who had to 
clean up after them. 
As I said, the terrorists destroyed; 
the Black and Brown maintenance 
workers cleaned up; and the union 
trades people rebuilt. 
This resolution that I am going to 
offer tomorrow reaffirms the Senate’s 
commitment to strengthening their 
rights as workers and providing sup-
port and resources to ensure their 
health, well-being, safety, and protec-
tion from further attacks. Their sup-
port should include higher pay. It 
should include collective bargaining 
rights for all of them. It should include 
paid sick leave and vacation leave. It 
should include comprehensive health 
insurance 
with 
mental 
health 
re-
sources. 
Don’t think that many of these—you 
all understand that many of these po-
lice officers, many of these custodial 
workers, many of the movers and the 
plumbers and the others who were 
locked in their rooms or offices or 
buildings during this—I am not a men-
tal health expert at all, but many of 
them, I am sure, suffer from issues of 
nightmares and other kinds of anxi-
eties that we need to help them with. 
I hope my colleagues will join me, 
not as Republicans or Democrats but 
as Americans, as Members of this body. 
These workers serve us all. They al-
lowed us to do our work for America 
that night. After we essentially were 
run out of this room and were safe for 
several hours, they allowed us, because 
of their work, to come back here and 
be safe and do our jobs that we took an 
oath of office on January 3, 2021, to do. 
This building wouldn’t function with-
out them. 
No one should have to endure what 
they did at the hands of domestic ter-
rorists. 
To all of the Capitol custodians and 
service workers who come to work in 
this building each day to ensure our de-
mocracy functions, thank you, thank 
you, thank you. 
I have this resolution honoring the 
Capitol’s essential workers, applauding 
them for their service. I had intended 
to try to pass this resolution by unani-
mous consent tomorrow, but I recog-
nize that many of my colleagues are 
out of town at the funeral honoring one 
of the really good men who served in 
this body, Johnny Isakson from Geor-
gia. 
I hope we can take this resolution up 
and pass this commonsense resolution 
next week when we return. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I am really pleased and honored 
to follow my colleague from Ohio and 
to join in supporting the resolution 
that he is offering to pay homage and 
to express gratitude to the essential 
workers in this building, in the Capitol 
Complex, in this temple of democracy, 
for all they have done, not only on Jan-
uary 6 but in the aftermath of that bru-
tal assault on our democracy. 
We talk in abstract now about the in-
stitution and the assault on this insti-
tution, but the lasting and enduring 
trauma for those workers that we will 
recognize in this resolution is tremen-
dously important. It is important to 
them, but it is important to us as well 
that we recognize our duty and our ob-
ligation to them for the dignity of 
their work and what they did to enable 
us to come back on that evening, Janu-
ary 6, and do our duty—and do it in a 
bipartisan way, coming together on 
that day. 
We were all witnesses to a brutal 
crime. We were all witnesses to an in-
surrection and a riot that stands as a 
dark and terrible milestone—the anni-
versary tomorrow of probably the most 
abhorrent attack on our democratic in-
stitutions. And all of us who were wit-
nesses can never forget the horror of 
that day—the sheer physicality of the 
attack, the blood in the hallways, the 
sights and sounds of rioters with bats 
and pipes bearing Trump banners and 
Confederate flags and seeking to do 
physical harm to us and to kill the 
Vice President. That kind of physical, 
brutal, cruel attack, with the hope—in 
fact, intent—of killing and injuring, 
had its effect. In fact, people died. 
Our Capitol Police bravely defended 
us, with determination and courage, 
and so did many other heroes that 
day—the National Guard and the DC 
Police. But let us never forget that 
mob was called here to this very Cham-
ber by the former President in a cyn-
ical bid to keep himself in power 
through a coup that would subvert the 
will of the people on election day. And 
we were here—we were all standing and 
then sitting at our desks when we were 
rushed from the Chamber because of 
the threat of physical assault on us. 
In the end, their efforts were thwart-
ed. Congress certified the election re-
sult that night as planned. We were 
undeterred, undaunted by the violent 
and deadly attack on the Capitol and 
our democracy. 
But that day was not a one-off. It was 
not an isolated or aberrant incident. In 
fact, it was a symptom and a symbol of 
a deeper, destructive violence of vio-
lent extremism—a virus of domestic 
terrorism that continues to infect our 
Nation; in fact, the most persistent and 
lethal threat to our national internal 
security. 
According to the intelligence com-
munity and the FBI, it is violent extre-
mism and White supremacy. That at-
tack left scars and wounds that remain 
unhealed, the lives that were lost, and 
many of our staff, many of those main-
tenance workers, many of the cafeteria 
and janitorial staff struggle with lin-
gering trauma from the violence that 
they faced on that day. 
The attack reminded us of how frag-
ile and in danger our democratic insti-
tutions are when our leaders, when we 
as leaders, fail to protect them. The 
mob that assaulted our Capitol was 
fueled by the Big Lie—the baseless 
falsehood that massive fraud occurred 
during the 2020 election. 
That Big Lie was propagated and sup-
ported 
by 
the 
President 
and 
his 
enablers, and they have continued to 
fuel those delusions. Donald Trump has 
incited continually the kind of false-
hoods that lead to a sharp rise in 
threats against lawmakers in the Cap-
itol here and a higher comfort level 
with violence at every level—in school 
boards, in statehouses. 
The Big Lie has now become a pre-
tense. It has become a pretense for 
some Republican leaders and State 
governments across the country to 
pass legislation making it harder to 
vote—meaning that fewer people have 
fewer times and fewer places to cast 
their vote. 
At least 19 States have passed 34 new 
laws that restrict voting rights based 
on that Big Lie—the bogus, false claim 
of fraud. And Republicans in a number 
of States are vesting the power to over-
turn election results—literally, to deny 
the results of the vote count rather

than respecting the will of the people, 
whether it is the vote canvass boards 
or legislative committees or other 
State officials having the power to 
strike down and overturn the results 
by refusing to certify them or literally 
disregarding them. 
All of this voter suppression is poi-
sonous. It is toxic to our democracy. 
And we have an obligation, on this sol-
emn anniversary of that horrific at-
tack, to recommit ourselves to holding 
accountable those domestic terrorists 
and violent extremists who stormed 
the Capitol and hunted us—lawmakers 
and others—ransacked the halls that 
we regard with so much reverence, de-
faced and debased not just the building 
but the concept of democracy. And we 
should pursue not only prosecutions 
against the 700 or 1,000 people who can 
be held criminally responsible for de-
facing the Capitol or illegally entering 
or other acts of violence but everyone 
who aided and abetted them. They 
must be held accountable, no matter 
what their rank or their office, no mat-
ter how high the facts and the law will 
go. I urge the Department of Justice to 
pursue them, to prosecute them, to 
make sure that they are held account-
able. 
We also need to fortify those institu-
tions. And that is why passing the 
Freedom to Vote Act and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
have to be among our priorities and 
changing the rules to make that pos-
sible. 
My colleagues and I will bring to the 
Senate floor for a vote in the coming 
weeks, no later than January 17, those 
measures in an effort to change the 
rules to enable their passage. We need 
to do whatever is necessary to pass 
those measures, including limiting the 
filibuster. 
There is a direct through line from 
the Big Lie in the January 6 assault, 
incited by Donald Trump, to violent 
extremism and domestic terrorism, to 
voter suppression and the overturning 
of elections, eventually to the destruc-
tion of our democracy. During the 
peaceful transition of power that even-
tually did take place last January, 
President Biden reminded us that a 
better world is not something that is 
given to us; it requires hard work. 
Unity is not inevitable; it is achievable 
through what we do to make it pos-
sible. Democracy is not a spectator 
sport. 
The values and norms and institu-
tions of our democracy are fragile, as 
threatened now as they are precious, 
and they depend on people fighting for 
them in times of adversity. And truly 
now we are in a time of adversity. 
What haunts me, as I think back on 
January 6, is how close we came to los-
ing our democracy, how close we came 
to 
shattering 
the 
traditions 
and 
norms—much as the windows of this 
building were shattered—and how a few 
people continue to believe they could 
demagogue and enable Trump to stage 
that coup. 
There is no forgetting what some of 
our colleagues did. There is no denying 
it. But we have sought to work to-
gether because we come here and we 
are sent here for a common purpose, 
which is to meet the needs of Ameri-
cans, especially in a time of pandemic 
and economic hardship. 
This past year has truly been one of 
hardship and heartbreak for so many. 
And as we think back to that day, a 
year ago, we need to redouble our de-
termination to hold dear the demo-
cratic values and institutions that 
mean elected representatives truly rep-
resent the people. That is what elec-
tions do. That is why every vote should 
count and every vote must count. And 
that is the purpose of the Freedom to 
Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
We have our part to do. We need to 
do it. And I hope my colleagues will 
not only relive and remember but act 
on it—the common purpose of that day 
when we came back to count the vote— 
to make sure that we can come to-
gether again not just to honor the peo-
ple who enable us to do it but also to 
honor the people of America who elect 
us to do it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
JANUARY 6 
Mr. 
MURPHY. 
Madam 
President, 
why January 6? Why were thousands of 
Trump supporters here in Washington 
on that specific date, January 6? They 
were here on January 6 because that 
was the last possible day that Donald 
Trump and his followers could overturn 
the election in which Joe Biden had 
just 
beaten 
the 
sitting 
President 
soundly—81 million votes to 74 million 
votes. The gap in the electoral college 
was much bigger on a percentage basis, 
306 to 232. 
But Trump and his followers decided 
that they were not going to just give 
up power just because their candidate 
lost an election. And their decision to 
put power ahead of the rule of law is, 
frankly, totally understandable. 
Over the course of human existence, 
thousands of second-place finishers, ei-
ther through election or by the dynam-
ics of power succession, have refused to 
bend to the rules. 
Most recently, Russia briefly flirted 
with democracy until Vladimir Putin 
and his cronies rigged the rules to set 
him up in power permanently. And 
throughout 
history, 
many 
slighted 
Princes or Generals have just chosen to 
seize power, through force or coercion, 
if they couldn’t get it through the 
standing rules. Wanting power and 
willing to do anything to get power is 
as old as civilization. And that is why 
all those people broke into the Capitol 
a year ago tomorrow. They were called 
to Washington by President Trump to 
pressure Congress and State legislators 
and Vice President Pence to suspend 
the rules of succession, void the elec-
tion, and install Donald Trump as 
President, even though he lost. Let’s 
not pretend that anything else hap-
pened that day. 
Senators 
CRUZ
and 
HAWLEY
and 
many, many other Republicans were, 
on January 6, trying to get Congress to 
delay the certification of electors to 
give Trump more time to overturn the 
will of the voters. The rioters came to 
the Capitol to use violence as a last re-
sort to try to pressure Congress to 
adopt the Cruz-Hawley plan. They 
stormed the building, and many of 
them were explicit when they were 
here that day, that they were inside 
the 
building 
to 
support 
President 
Trump, to support Senator CRUZ. By 
the end of the day, dozens were killed 
or badly injured. 
It wasn’t a spontaneous random act 
of mass violence. It was a coordinated 
attempt to use violence, or at least the 
threat of violence for many, to void the 
2020 election and install Donald Trump 
as an unelected leader of the United 
States of America. 
History has seen this play a million 
times before. 
But I think here in the Senate, we 
often get lulled into a little bit of a 
sense of complacency because the last 
vestiges of the pre-Trump era of the 
Republican Party still exist here in the 
Senate. In the Senate, only seven Re-
publicans voted for Senators CRUZ and 
HAWLEY’s attempt to void Joe Biden’s 
victory. And Senator MCCONNELL and 
some others here said the right thing 
that day and the days afterward. 
Behind closed doors, many of our vet-
eran Republican colleagues often whis-
pered to us how awful and vulgar the 
Trump rioters are and how dearly they 
support the rule of law. But almost 
never do those Republican colleagues 
say those things out loud because the 
new mainstream of the Republican 
Party—the Trump Republican Party— 
does not believe that Joe Biden won 
the 2020 election. Pick your conspiracy 
theory, but 7 out of 10 Republicans— 
literally, tens of thousands of Ameri-
cans—believe that somehow Pakistani 
intelligence operatives or Italian sat-
ellites or Venezuelan communists were 
involved in secretly switching millions 
of votes from Donald Trump to Joe 
Biden. 
But maybe more importantly, what 
leads these Republicans to believe 
these wild conspiracy theories is a 
more insidious belief, a belief that if a 
Democrat wins an election, it must be, 
by definition, illegitimate. That is why 
this many Republicans believed Joe 
Biden didn’t win, even though they 
have zero evidence to back up this 
claim. They don’t need evidence be-
cause they just believe the Democrats 
are evil, that Democrats are illegit-
imate in governance. And if Democrats 
win, it just cannot be allowed to stand. 
Defeating Democrats is, to the Trump 
Republican 
Party, 
more 
important 
than maintaining democracy. 
We know this because some of the 
most popular and revered national Re-
publicans are calling openly for the 
suspension of democracy if democracy

keeps electing Democrats. Congress-
woman 
MARJORIE
TAYLOR
GREENE 
called for States with Republican Gov-
ernors to disallow people from voting if 
they showed an inclination to support 
Democrats. 
Our 
colleague, 
Senator 
RAND PAUL, said efforts to convince 
people to vote—if those votes resulted 
in Democrats winning—should be ille-
gal. 
Sensible 
Senate 
Republicans—the 
ones who whisper the sensible things 
quietly to us here on the floor of the 
Senate Chamber—will claim that MAR-
JORIE TAYLOR GREENE is an outlier, a 
fringe character, but she is exactly the 
opposite. She is the mainstream. She 
doesn’t believe Joe Biden won the 2020 
election, just like 7 out of 10 Repub-
lican voters. The fact that she is will-
ing to say the quiet things out loud, it 
doesn’t make her fringe; it makes her 
royalty. The best attended Republican 
event in my State since the 2020 elec-
tion was an event headlined by MAR-
JORIE TAYLOR GREENE. 
She and RAND PAUL and their ilk are 
the Republican Party right now. They 
are the healthy trunk of the tree. Sen-
sible Senate Republicans who believe 
Joe Biden is a legitimate President are 
the dead limbs, bound to fall off soon in 
a slight wind. 
The mainstream of today’s Repub-
lican Party believes that beating Joe 
Biden and other Democrats is just 
more important than preserving de-
mocracy. So that is why they are me-
thodically working to clean up their 
mistakes from 2020. They couldn’t de-
clare Joe Biden’s win illegitimate be-
cause they just weren’t ready on Janu-
ary 6. That is what January 6 was 
about, an attempt to postpone the cer-
tification of electors so they could get 
ready. 
Well, in 2022 and 2024, they are going 
to be ready. At the heart of this plan is 
an attempt to just make it a whole lot 
harder for Democrats to vote by elimi-
nating voting sites in Democratic 
neighborhoods or eliminating days to 
vote—days that typically Democrats 
vote on. 
But Republicans are also preparing a 
secret weapon—a backup plan—if on 
election night, their attempts to de-
press Democratic turnout don’t work 
out and a Democratic candidate for 
Governor or Senate or President still 
wins. And this backup plan is all about 
changing who counts the votes. It used 
to be that even in Republican-majority 
States, Democrats had a role in count-
ing the votes, either through bipar-
tisan panels or through the ability for 
cities and counties to choose their own 
election officials, which often meant 
that in Democratic counties you had 
Democrats in charge of counting votes 
and in Republican counties you had Re-
publicans in charge of counting votes. 
This has been a longstanding founda-
tion of our democracy, making sure 
that no one party had the monopoly on 
vote counting. 
If both parties are engaged in the 
process, there is a lot more incentive 
for both sides to play it safe and play 
it straight—but no more. In Repub-
lican-controlled State after State, the 
rules are being changed to put Repub-
licans and only Republicans in charge 
of counting the votes and, more con-
sequently, deciding which votes count. 
Trump and his followers are making 
sure that only Republicans who are 100 
percent loyal to Trump will be the cho-
sen few Republicans in charge of vote 
counting. 
Everybody has heard that phone call 
from 2020 in which President Trump 
personally lobbies the Georgia sec-
retary of state to disqualify just 
enough Democratic votes in order to 
shift the State’s electors to Trump. ‘‘I 
just want to find 11,780 votes,’’ Trump 
pleads in that phone call. During that 
hour-long call, he makes it exactly 
clear what he wants. He wants 11,780 or 
more Democratic votes to be disquali-
fied through vague made-up claims of 
fraud in order to flip the election. He 
tells you exactly what he wants on 
that phone call: votes to be disqualified 
on zero basis of fraud in order to flip 
the election to him. 
The new State laws and the purge of 
straight shooters like the Georgia sec-
retary of state from the party will 
make sure that in 2022 or 2024, if an 
election is close enough to flip to Re-
publicans, the obstacles that were in 
place in 2020 will be gone. 
Now, I know that every Republican 
Senator, and even a few Democratic 
Senators, think this scenario that I 
just outlined is hyperbolic. They think 
it is a scare tactic. But why would you 
think that? Trump and his allies aren’t 
even trying to hide what they did or 
what they are doing. Trump lost the 
election. He lost the election by 7 mil-
lion votes, and he didn’t care. He did 
everything in his power, including 
using violence, to try to stay in power, 
despite the fact that he lost. Since 
then, he has cheerled all these changes 
in State laws. 
Do any of you really think that he is 
doing this because he believes in good 
governance 
or 
clean 
elections? 
Of 
course, not. He has told you in words, 
in deeds, over and over, what his goal 
is, and his goal is to achieve power, 
whether or not he actually wins the 
election. He is not hiding it. His sup-
porters, leaders of the Republican 
Party, are now openly calling for 
States to strip from Democrats, and 
Democrats only, the right to vote or 
the right to campaign for election. 
This is all happening in front of your 
eyes, out in the open, right now. And 
only we—the 100 of us—have the ability 
to stop this. January 6 was just a pre-
view. It was what happens because 
Trump and his minions hadn’t done the 
necessary planning ahead to steal the 
election. They panicked, and they 
brought violence upon this building. 
They may not need a physical rebel-
lion in 2022 or 2024 because they will 
have changed the rules to make sure 
that Republicans loyal to Trump are 
installed in power, regardless of wheth-
er they win or lose the election. 
None of us are helpless here in the 
U.S. Senate. We can pass laws that 
take away from States the power to 
disenfranchise any voters or the ability 
to put only one party in charge of vote 
counting. 
A few of my Democratic Senate col-
leagues think that they are saving the 
Senate 
by 
preserving 
Republicans’ 
right to stop these reforms. They are 
wrong. If we don’t take steps right now 
to stop Trump’s plan, there won’t be a 
Senate left to protect. That is not hy-
perbole. If the loser of an election for 
the U.S. Senate gets seated as a Mem-
ber of this body in 2023, then our de-
mocracy is effectively dead. 
It is time we started actually listen-
ing to what Trump Republicans are 
telling us over and over again, out 
loud, that they are getting ready to do. 
They have made their choice, and they 
have chosen power over democracy. 
I get it. It is always easier to do 
nothing and hope that the threat will 
just go away—just shut the door, box 
your ears, cover your eyes, and hope 
for the best. But we are the U.S. Sen-
ate. We are the ones that are put on 
the watch. We are the ones that are 
supposed to meet the threat head-on 
and stop it. 
I yield the floor.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, had

strides for the system, including one of 
his major legislative accomplishments: 
ACT 360, which appropriated $500 mil-
lion in capital improvements to all 12 
LCTCS campuses throughout the great 
State of Louisiana. 
Prior to his service at LCTCS, Mr. 
Williams wore many hats during his 
tenure at BellSouth, which spanned al-
most four decades. Serving as the com-
pany’s executive director for legisla-
tive affairs in Louisiana, he rep-
resented the interests of BellSouth be-
fore the Louisiana State Legislature in 
numerous regular and special sessions. 
He served as BellSouth’s Houma and 
Baton Rouge district manager, as well 
as vice president for regulatory and ex-
ternal affairs from 2003–2006. 
In addition to the lengthy list of pro-
fessional accomplishments, Mr. Wil-
liams and his wife of 56 years, Ms. 
Bonnie Williams, devoted countless 
hours of their time volunteering for 
community-based nonprofit organiza-
tions. Mr. and Mrs. Williams are the 
proud parents of four, grandparents of 
eight, and great-grandparents of three. 
The State of Louisiana and all who 
have benefited from Mr. Williams’s im-
pressive efforts thank him for his dili-
gent work. There is no doubt that his 
legacy will live on in the years to come 
and will serve as an inspiration to the 
next generation of community builders 
and leaders.∑
