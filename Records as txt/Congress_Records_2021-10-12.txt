Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2021 
No. 179 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, speak to us this day. 
Call us. Call us together as people of 
faith and inspire us to take the time to 
encourage each other with testimonies 
of Your grace and to share our experi-
ences of Your abiding love. 
Then, when we find ourselves dis-
couraged by the success of wrongdoers, 
frustrated by the smugness of the 
proud, and offended when the impudent 
put You to the test and walk away un-
repentant, because we are sure of Your 
ultimate word, we will not accuse You 
of indifference. 
If we ground ourselves in Your gra-
cious plan, even when confronted with 
confusion, we need not question wheth-
er our devotion to You is in vain. 
In all that we encounter, may we be 
quick to recall Your define mercy and 
steadfast promises. May we be assured, 
and may we share that assurance with 
those around us, that in all things and 
in all times, we are Yours. We are Your 
special possession. 
We dedicate ourselves to serve You 
with perseverance and faithfulness this 
day. 
In Your strength we go forth, and in 
Your name we pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HIMES). The gentleman from Massachu-
setts is recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), my good friend, pending 
which I yield myself such time as I

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, earlier 
today the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 716, for 
four measures. 
First, it provides for consideration of 
H.R. 2119, the Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Improvement Act, 
under a structured rule. The rule self- 
executes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairman SCOTT, provides for 1 hour of 
general debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, makes in order eight 
amendments, provides en bloc author-
ity, and provides one motion to recom-
mit. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.R. 3110, the PUMP for Nursing Moth-
ers Act, under a structured rule. The 
rule self-executes a manager’s amend-
ment from Chairman SCOTT, provides 
for 1 hour of general debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor, makes 
in order two amendments, and provides 
one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 3992, the Protecting Older 
Job Applicants Act, under a structured 
rule. It provides for 1 hour of general 
debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, makes in order two 
amendments, and provides one motion 
to recommit. 
Additionally, the rule provides that 
the House hereby concurs in the Senate 
amendment to the House amendment 
to S. 1301, an increase of the public 
debt limit. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability to

en bloc requested roll call votes on pre-
viously 
considered 
suspension 
bills 
through October 22, 2021, and provides 
recess instructions, suspension author-
ity, and same day authority through 
November 18, 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, Republican Teddy Roo-
sevelt once said: ‘‘The government is 
us; we are the government, you and I.’’ 
He knew that government is at its 
best when it brings all of us together 
while also working for every single one 
of us. That means a system that allows 
every American the chance to put a 
roof over their head, food on their 
table, and a job that allows them to 
put some money in the bank, and 
where education and healthcare are af-
fordable and not a luxury for the pre-
cious wealthy few. 
Unfortunately, as a deadline loomed, 
those discussions have had to give way 
to a debate about whether our Nation 
will pay its debts. Rather than coming 
together to get this done, some on the 
other side advocated an approach that 
would stop government in its tracks 
and open the door on default for the 
first time in our history. 
We all know what that would mean. 
It would send our economy off a cliff 
and make the cost of virtually every-
thing skyrocket, all at a time when we 
should be helping families recover from 
the economic shock of the COVID pan-
demic. 
Last week our Defense Secretary, 
Lloyd Austin, said that defaulting our 
debt would risk the benefits of more 
than 2 million military retirees and 
roughly 400,000 survivors. 
Mark Zandi is chief economist at 
Moody’s 
Analytics 
and 
previously 
worked for Republican Senator John 
McCain. He recently said that default-
ing ‘‘would be financial Armageddon.’’ 
That is what has been at stake here, 
Mr. Speaker, financial Armageddon. 
b 1615 
The debt ceiling has been raised or 
suspended roughly 80 times in our Na-
tion’s history, often in a bipartisan 
way. And I am grateful that, after 
much debate, we are finally doing the 
right thing again here today. 
I took to the House floor two weeks 
ago, Mr. Speaker, and stressed the im-
portance of preventing default. I spoke 
about how I voted to raise the debt 
ceiling when I was in the majority and 
in the minority, when there was a 
Democrat in the White House and when 
there was a Republican in the White 
House, and I asked Republicans to do 
one thing: If they weren’t going to help 
us raise the debt ceiling, I asked them 
to get out of the way so that Demo-
crats could prevent default on our own. 
Now, I want to thank the minority 
leader in the Senate, MITCH MCCON-
NELL, for taking that advice. He craft-
ed the initial framework of a deal that 
will temporarily increase our debt 
limit into early December. And after 
voting with just 10 other Republicans 
to allow debate on that compromise, he 
got so far out of the way that he 
couldn’t even bring himself to vote for 
the deal that he pushed for. 
But the deal was made, and the com-
promise passed the Senate, and I am 
hopeful that we can send this bill to 
the President today and avert a totally 
self-made, unnecessary catastrophe. 
And let me say, for the record, the 
first time we saw a dramatic increase 
in our Nation’s debt was under Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan, a Republican, who 
added $4 trillion to our Nation’s debt; 
part of that was to pass tax cuts, again, 
primarily for those at the top. 
So please spare us the lectures on 
taxes and spending today. Let’s just fi-
nally do the right thing. 
I want to thank all of those who will 
join with us today in making this pos-
sible. I pray that those who vote ‘‘no’’ 
will have their wisdom enlarged be-
cause what is before us is ultimately a 
stopgap. We will need to find a long- 
term solution in a matter of weeks; one 
that protects the full faith and credit 
of the United States, hopefully, with-
out lurching from one short-term dead-
line to the next. 
That is one of the most basic tasks of 
Congress and, on behalf of our economy 
and the American people, we will have 
to get this done. We always have. And 
we cannot afford not to this time 
around. 
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, let me also urge 
passage of the three underlying bills 
that are also included in this rule; leg-
islation that will extend protections 
for nursing mothers in the workplace, 
prevent discrimination of older Ameri-
cans in the workforce, and combat inti-
mate partner violence. They are impor-
tant ways for us all to show our sup-
port for protecting our Nation’s chil-
dren, families, and workers. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
this rule and the underlying bills. Let’s 
show that the words of Teddy Roo-
sevelt haven’t completely fallen on 
deaf ears. Let’s show that America 
pays its bills; and let’s show that we 
can keep making government work 
better for every single American. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and I thank the gentleman from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MCGOVERN) 
for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 716 provides for 
the consideration of four bills, includ-
ing an irresponsible extension of the 
Federal debt limit and two bills that 
would have questionable consequences 
for small businesses. 
I am most concerned about S. 1301, 
which serves as the vehicle for an ex-
tension of the Federal debt limit until 
December 3. This accomplishes nothing 
more than kicking the can down the 
road on something that should be ad-
dressed now. 
Given the majority’s insistence on 
passing 
several 
multi-trillion-dollar 
spending packages—Democrats are now 
in control of the House, Senate, and 
White House—they can pass a debt 
limit extension using their majority 
since it is their policies that are re-
quiring substantially larger and earlier 
increases to the debt limit. 
In the past, when Congress was re-
quired to raise the debt ceiling, the two 
parties were able to negotiate a bipar-
tisan path forward. Democrats simply 
refuse to work with House Republicans, 
despite having many opportunities to 
do so. Instead, they are determined to 
ram a $3.5 trillion spending bill check-
ing off every item on their socialist 
wish list. 
I am equally incensed that Demo-
crats won’t even give the debt limit ex-
tension a proper debate or vote on the 
House floor. Instead, this rule will 
deem the debt limit extension passed. 
This is an insult to the Members of this 
body who are being denied the oppor-
tunity to fully consider the gravity of 
extending the debt limit to account for 
increasing unnecessary spending. It is 
absolutely unacceptable to run Con-
gress in this fashion. 
The second bill up for consideration 
under this rule is H.R. 3110, the PUMP 
for Nursing Mothers Act. 
Nursing mothers deserve protections 
in the workplace, which is why we al-
ready have strong laws in place to en-
sure reasonable break time and access 
to private, non-bathroom locations. 
This bill imposes a one-size-fits-all re-
quirement for employers and includes 
penalties for employer violations. 
Mr. Speaker, our small businesses 
have suffered through enough new bur-
densome regulations as they fought to 
survive over the last year. There is no 
need to duplicate existing law. 
The third bill included in this rule is 
H.R. 3992, the Protect Older Job Appli-
cants Act, which expands the definition 
in the existing Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act of 1967 to include ap-
plicants for employment as a protected 
class. 
To be clear, the Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act already prohibits 
age discrimination in hiring, making 
this legislation redundant and unneces-
sary. Under the scope of this new pro-
posed 
legislation, 
employers 
using 
common recruiting practices like in-
ternships and job fairs could be accused 
of discriminating against older work-
ers, as older workers are less likely to 
participate in these opportunities than 
young Americans entering the work-
force for the first time. 
This bill is just a murky expansion of 
the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act. The only impact this legislation 
will have is on the number of lawsuits 
brought against American businesses. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, the fourth bill 
up for consideration under this rule is 
H.R. 2119, the Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Improvement Act of 
2021. The Family Violence Prevention 
and Services program does critical 
work to support victims of family vio-
lence, and many of my colleagues and I 
support reauthorizing this program in 
its current form. 
Unfortunately, this is another exam-
ple of the majority working alone to

October 12, 2021 
draft legislation rather than working 
in a bipartisan fashion to put together 
a bill we can all support. 
Mr. Speaker, I am particularly con-
cerned about a provision in this bill 
that could allow funds from this pro-
gram, funds that should be going to 
support victims of violence, to be used 
for abortion services now that the 
Hyde amendment was stripped out of 
the annual appropriations bill. This is 
obviously troubling, and we cannot 
allow a pathway for taxpayer dollars to 
fund abortion. 
Mr. Speaker, there is much to be con-
cerned about in these four bills; most 
troubling of which is the temporary in-
crease to the Federal debt limit, which 
is happening for no other reason than 
the Democrats’ own mistakes. 
They have worked alone on every-
thing else. They have chosen not to be 
bipartisan to resolve the issues facing 
our country. Instead, they have chosen 
to push through partisan proposals 
while kicking critical issues down the 
road. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
rule and the underlying bills. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me remind my good friend that 
the compromise we are voting on was 
designed by Republican leader MITCH 
MCCONNELL. It is not what I wanted. I 
wanted to get this out of the way and 
make it longer, quite frankly, so we 
weren’t lurching from one deadline to 
another. 
I would also say to my friend on the 
Rules Committee that it is a little bit 
hard for us to stand over here and to 
listen to some of my Republican col-
leagues complain, because what we are 
doing here is we are paying for the bills 
that Donald Trump and the Repub-
licans accumulated. 
I didn’t like the tax cut that my 
friends forced through, by the way, 
with no Democratic support or con-
sultation. It added trillions to our 
debt. But we have to pay for it. 
It is like my Republican friends went 
out to a fancy restaurant, drank cham-
pagne and ate caviar and ran out of the 
restaurant before paying the bill, and 
now they want us to take the responsi-
bility to pay for their bills. 
Well, you know what? We have some 
experience in cleaning up the messes 
that have been left behind by our Re-
publican colleagues. The last time Re-
publicans controlled the House, the 
Senate, and the White House, they shut 
the government down, and then the 
new Democratic majority had to come 
in and try to fix all that. So my friends 
are really good at creating messes and 
piling up big bills, by the way, and 
then they say to us, you clean it up. 
Well, you know what? We are putting 
our country first, and so we are going 
to clean up this mess, and we are going 
to move forward. And we are going to 
have a reconciliation bill, by the way, 
that will be mostly paid for. And if my 
friends don’t like that, they can vote 
against it. 
But let’s be clear. Ninety-seven per-
cent of what we are covering here are 
bills accumulated by Donald Trump 
and my Republican friends; I mean, 97 
percent. So I don’t know what the con-
troversy is on the other side of the 
aisle. 
You didn’t want to accumulate all 
this debt? I remember during the tax 
debate we were talking to you about 
debt and you didn’t want to hear any-
thing about it. We had some Repub-
licans say that debt doesn’t matter on 
this floor. And now all of a sudden it 
does; now that we have a Democratic 
President and, by the way, a Demo-
cratic Congress that is trying to pay 
the bills that you accumulated. This is 
ridiculous. It is absurd that we are hav-
ing this debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this is our debt. It is 
America’s debt. 
Now, I agree with the chairman of 
the Rules Committee that some of this 
debt clearly accumulates from tax 
cuts, cutting our revenue before we cut 
our spending. And some of it relates to 
greater spending promoted by both 
sides of the aisle. 
For any one of us to get up and say 
it is your debt—it is America’s debt, 
and America pays its bills. 
Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Con-
gress, I have faced this question of rais-
ing or suspending the debt limit 49 
times. This will be the 50th time since 
I was first asked to vote on this ques-
tion when Ronald Reagan was Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Now, the gentlewoman is talking, 
Mr. Speaker, to her staff, but I want to 
say that the argument that she offered 
with references to why it is our debt is 
specious, and I emphatically deny that 
assertion. 
It is our debt. We have different pri-
orities, different perspectives, different 
mandates. But every time we cut reve-
nues or we approve spending, we raise 
the debt limit. 
And by the way, the gentlewoman 
was not here in the last Congress, but 
we accumulated $5.4 trillion in debt. 
And the gentlewoman may be reminded 
that they were passed in a bipartisan 
way to meet a crisis that we thought 
justified those expenditures. 
Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends 
across the aisle have been asked to 
take this same vote many times as 
well, and they have voted ‘‘yes’’ on 
some of those occasions and ‘‘no’’ on 
others. 
Nobody has clean hands when it 
comes to the debt limit. We all tend to 
rationalize that it is somebody else’s 
debt. Let me repeat: It is our debt, 
America’s debt. 
And I will tell you this: I would hope 
that if only one of us of our 435, if only 
one of us had the decision to make as 
to whether we increase the debt limit 
or not, I hope that not a single one of 
us would say no. 
b 1630 
Now, collectively, we apparently can 
rationalize saying no because some-
body else will get it done. Somebody 
else will take the responsibility. Some-
body else will act responsibly. 
Mr. Speaker, the previous Speakers, I 
am sure although not here, perhaps 
have followed politics relatively close-
ly. I have been here for a number of ad-
ministrations. Ronald Reagan asked us 
to increase the debt. George H.W. Bush 
asked us to increase the debt. Bill Clin-
ton asked us to increase the debt. 
George W. Bush asked us to increase 
the debt. Barack Obama asked us to in-
crease the debt. Donald Trump asked 
us to increase the debt. 
And now Joe Biden asks us to do the 
same. Why? Because the catastrophic 
alternative is unacceptable. Perhaps 
nobody is listening. But every Sec-
retary of the Treasury, Republican and 
Democrat, has risen to the Congress of 
the United States and the American 
people and said: You must raise the 
debt or we will invite recession or per-
haps depression and global chaos in the 
fiscal marketplace. 
I don’t see any animation from those 
who listened to that number or that as-
sertion, and I am glad to have any one 
of them get up and try to deny that 
every President over the last 40 years 
that I have been here has asked us not 
to put the full faith and credit of the 
United States at risk. 
Fifty times in 40 years. Every time 
we have made a determination, every 
time—Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
often together in common cause—that 
the full faith and credit of the United 
States must never even be questioned. 
The 14th Amendment says that, Mr. 
Speaker. It has been our shared deter-
mination as responsible parties loyal 
to Constitution and country that the 
costs we have incurred on behalf of the 
American people must be paid. 
And so many of the Republicans will 
vote today not to do that. And they 
will use some rationalization that they 
don’t like the rest of the rule or this 
bill or that bill. Vote against them. 
But don’t vote against your country’s 
full faith and credit. Don’t vote against 
your country’s credit. 
Preventing a default was the obliga-
tion of Members from both parties to-
gether. That is what all the Secretaries 
of Treasury have said. Sometimes a 
number of us on one side or the other 
would vote against it to lodge our con-
cerns about fiscal policies of the day as 
long as it was clear that somebody else 
would get it done. 
Together, 
Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans would make sure the debt limit 
was raised or suspended when needed 
and that default was never a possi-
bility. 
I want to thank Representative FOS-
TER and Representative BOYLE and oth-
ers who have introduced legislation

that would eliminate the debt ceiling 
altogether. It is a phony issue. It is a 
fraud. It is fake news. And to think 
otherwise is intellectually not correct. 
We ought to think about eliminating 
this debt limit because all it does is 
have a threat to global instability; 
something we ought to consider very 
seriously given how the debt limit has 
in 
recent 
years 
been 
dangerously 
weaponized by one party to hold the 
country hostage. 
Republicans first did that in 2011, 
even though they were in the House 
majority, and the result was the first- 
ever downgrade of America’s credit rat-
ing. Of course, that same party sang a 
very different tune when it was in the 
White House. When Donald Trump sat 
in the Oval Office, Democrats were 
asked three times by your party to 
help not default on the debt, and three 
times Democrats overwhelmingly re-
sponded. 
Now President Biden has asked us to 
do the same thing, take action on the 
debt limit to ensure that a default does 
not happen in the coming months. 
I don’t like this deal that the Senate 
sent us. If I were voting on the merits 
of this deal, I would vote ‘‘no.’’ It is a 
lousy deal. It holds hostage the debt 
and credit of the United States for an-
other 2 months, and then we are going 
to play this game one more time; a des-
picable and irresponsible act for adults 
who know better. 
While it is a relief to so many Amer-
ican business workers that the threat 
of default has now been pushed back 
just a little bit, that relief will surely 
be short-lived because we will find our-
selves here again in a month’s time 
faced with the same situation in which 
we found ourselves these past weeks. 
That did not happen during the 
Trump administration because this 
side of the aisle was responsible. This 
side of the aisle knew the truth. This 
side of the aisle was not very happy 
with the President of the United 
States, but happy with America’s cred-
itworthiness. One party has played par-
tisan games with the full faith and 
credit of our country, refusing to act 
responsibly as we all have so many, 
many times before. 
Mr. Speaker, between now and De-
cember 3, America will be watching 
Leaders MCCARTHY and MCCONNELL to 
see if they will lead their party down 
the responsible path or continue to 
play the game that has already pushed 
us to the brink of default. Let me be 
clear, I will urge my colleagues on my 
side of the aisle not to play that game 
in this administration or future admin-
istrations. 
This is not about politics. This is 
about responsibility. This is about our 
country. This is, indeed, about the 
global fiscal health. We will continue 
to do the responsible thing and urge a 
longer term suspension of the debt 
limit so that we can get our country 
through the pandemic’s economic crisis 
and build back better. 
Even the possibility of a default, Mr. 
Speaker, risks harming our economic 
recovery. 194 sitting Democratic Mem-
bers of this House, myself included, an-
swered the call to help suspend the 
debt limit under President Trump. Ap-
parently, you don’t care about that. 
You think, well, yes, that was the re-
sponsible thing to do because we had a 
Republican President, but not now 
when we have a Democratic President. 
I hope the voters of America think that 
hypocrisy is not acceptable. 
Others in our caucus who were not 
here at the time to take those votes, 
surely would have acted the same 
under the circumstances. 194 of us, not 
some few of us, but 194 of us voted for 
it. 
The roll is going to be called, and not 
up yonder, but here. And I hope so 
many of you are there when that roll is 
called. Leader MCCONNELL knows it is 
the right thing to do. These are Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s words: ‘‘Let me 
make it perfectly clear.’’ 
Hear me, my colleagues, Mr. Speak-
er, and hopefully our people, Mr. 
MCCONNELL, the minority leader in the 
United States Senate, the Republican 
leader: ‘‘Let me make it perfectly 
clear,’’ he said, ‘‘the country must 
never default. The debt ceiling will 
need to be raised.’’ He didn’t say unless 
you stop pushing your policies, Demo-
crats, that you ran on to help people, 
to help children, to help businesses. He 
didn’t say that. He said, the debt limit 
must be raised. 
In 2015 when Republicans were in the 
majority and asked Democrats to join 
them in voting to address the debt 
limit, he tweeted again—this is Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, the leader of the Re-
publican Party on the Senate side, 
‘‘When the United States makes prom-
ises, it keeps them, which is why the 
House voted today to avoid the threat 
of a debt default,’’ with the over-
whelming majority of us joining in 
that responsible action. 
I 
hope 
Leaders 
MCCARTHY
and 
MCCONNELL and their House and Sen-
ate Republican colleagues will reject 
hypocrisy and embrace responsibility 
by joining with Democrats before De-
cember 3 to eliminate the threat of de-
fault this time and before December 3, 
after this bill passes, to ensure that 
our country pays for what it has al-
ready bought. 
Now, I would simply add to the obser-
vations of the Rules Committee chair-
man, for whom I have not only respect 
but affection, I say to Mr. Chairman: 
We both went into that restaurant. We 
both got a steak. Neither one of us 
ought to leave without paying the bill. 
It wasn’t just you that went and got 
the steak. We got a steak, too. And we 
both have the responsibility to pay for 
that steak. That is what this vote is 
about. 
Do not hide behind some differences 
you may have on the three bills, as the 
gentlewoman, Mr. Speaker, referred us 
to. Don’t hide behind that. This is 
about whether or not we are going to 
be fiscally responsible or not. And you 
can vote against those bills when they 
come to the floor—and I am going to 
bring all three of them to the floor. I 
will tell you that—and you can vote 
against them. 
But do not vote against the good 
faith and credit of the United States of 
America, our country. Don’t hide be-
hind some facade that somehow we cre-
ated the debt and you had no responsi-
bility. Don’t hide behind some facade 
that somehow we are going to offer 
something that has a whole lot of 
money coming to it because, very 
frankly, if that had been the case, 
Democrats would not have joined you 
under Donald Trump and raising the 
debt limit so we did not default. 
Vote as an American; not as a Repub-
lican or Democrat. Vote as a respon-
sible human being sent here by your 
neighbors and friends to do the right 
thing. You know in your hearts the 
right thing is to not allow this coun-
try’s full faith and credit to be com-
promised in any way. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
just want to remind my colleague on 
the Rules Committee that I stated very 
clearly that I was talking about House 
Republicans. But I do want to point out 
that no Republican in the Senate voted 
for this debt limit extension in addi-
tion to that, and I appreciate the ma-
jority leader’s words. He gave us a his-
tory lesson about the debt limit and 
the votes and about not playing poli-
tics, but I just want to, before we move 
on, remind everyone about a quote 
from then-Senator and now President 
Biden. It was from 2004, during Presi-
dent Bush’s Presidency and then-Sen-
ator Biden said: ‘‘My symbolic vote 
against raising the debt limit would 
have been a protest of the policies that 
brought us to this point, and I demand 
that we change course.’’ 
So this has not always been as bipar-
tisan as the majority leader made it 
appear. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Person Speak-
er, I have a parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. This rule pro-
vides for debate on H.R. 3110, which, as 
you know, is entitled the PUMP For 
Nursing Mothers Act, and I am very 
concerned this majority doesn’t seem 
to be concerned about the men around 
the country who identify as nursing 
mothers. 
Does not the title of this act violate 
the rules of this 117th Congress because 
it recognizes distinction between men 
and women in biological terms? Would 
not this act be required to be called the 
pump for nursing persons act or the 
pump for nursing birthing persons act? 
I am very concerned that we are not 
concerned about the men around the

country who identify as nursing moth-
ers and how we would allow a debate on 
this bill or this act as presented. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not stated a parliamentary 
inquiry. The gentleman is recognized 
for his remaining time. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Well, I am just 
very concerned that we would have this 
kind of debate that is inconsistent with 
the apparent rules of the 117th House, 
and Person Speaker, I just don’t think 
it should be permitted that we would 
have this kind of debate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
just state for the record that the House 
rules do not ban the use of any of the 
words that the gentleman is referring 
to. It is another one of these rightwing 
conspiracies. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the distinguished Speaker of 
the House. 
b 1645 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, for his on-
going leadership to bring this impor-
tant legislation to the floor, and for 
the work of the Rules Committee ongo-
ing to make sure that we have the 
right discussion on the floor to meet 
the needs of the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, multiple times now, the 
Democratic House has taken action to 
honor our responsibility to address the 
priority of the debt limit. We have 
done so because this is about pro-
tecting families. 
The failure to lift the debt limit 
could result in the loss of up to 6 mil-
lion jobs, the elimination of $15 trillion 
in household wealth, and drastic in-
creases in the cost of car loans, mort-
gages, student loans, credit card bills, 
and other borrowing. 
Our action also protects the Amer-
ican economy. When we say domestic 
economy, we are talking domestic, we 
are talking kitchen table when we talk 
about car loans, mortgages, student 
loans, credit card bills, et cetera, as 
well as jobs and trillions of dollars in 
household wealth. 
In terms of the domestic economy at 
large, our action protects the economy, 
preventing a decline in the real GDP of 
up to 4 percent, a surge in the unem-
ployment rate, as I mentioned, and 
what JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie 
Dimon called a: ‘‘catastrophe of unbe-
lievable proportions and damage to 
America for up to 100 years.’’ 
This is also about the health of the 
global economy; kitchen table econ-
omy, broader domestic economy, na-
tional economy, the global economy. 
The Council of Economic Advisors 
has stated: ‘‘A default would send 
shock waves through global financial 
markets and would likely cause credit 
markets worldwide to freeze up and 
stock markets to plunge. Employers 
around the world would likely have to 
begin laying off workers.’’ 
It goes on to say: ‘‘The 2008 financial 
crisis had ripple effects throughout the 
global economy that ricocheted back 
to the U.S. shores, causing firms to lay 
off workers and cut private invest-
ment. A financial crisis driven by a de-
fault has the potential to be even 
worse, in addition to hitting a global 
economy not fully recovered from the 
pandemic.’’ 
Addressing the debt limit honors our 
duty to the Constitution. The 14th 
Amendment, Section 4, states: ‘‘The 
validity of the public debt of the 
United States, authorized by law . . . 
shall not be questioned.’’ 
My question, Mr. Speaker, to you and 
to our colleagues, is: What is it that 
they have against families, when they 
want to increase unemployment, de-
crease household wealth, and have fam-
ilies be charged more for car loans, 
credit card loans, mortgage payments, 
and other borrowing? 
Don’t you care about that? 
What do you have against our own 
economy, where this catastrophe of un-
believable proportion could have im-
pact for over 100 years? 
Don’t you care about that? 
Also, the health of the global econ-
omy, which I described so clearly caus-
ing credit markets worldwide to freeze 
up and stock markets to plunge and 
employers around the world have to 
begin laying off workers, again, coming 
back to our shores. 
Certainly, you have respect for the 
Constitution of the United States to 
which we take an oath to protect and 
defend, which states: ‘‘The validity of 
the public debt of the United States, 
authorized by law . . . shall not be 
questioned.’’ 
Let us be clear about what this 
means. Addressing the debt limit is not 
about future spending, as some have 
tried to represent. This is about meet-
ing obligations that the Government 
has already incurred, including from 
the bipartisan COVID relief legislation 
passed last year. Only 3 percent of the 
current debt that we are addressing 
here has been incurred during the 
Biden years. We are talking about the 
Trump debt incurred and some of it in 
a bipartisan way to address the COVID 
crisis. Not all, though. We were not 
complicit in the Republican tax scam 
to give 83 percent of benefits to the top 
1 percent in our country, adding about 
$2 trillion that we have to cover here 
now. 
Let us remember: This should not be 
controversial. The debt limit has been 
a longtime bipartisan issue. Congress 
has addressed the debt limit 78 times 
since 1960: 29 times with a Democratic 
President in the White House and 49 
times under a Republican President, al-
most twice as many times under a Re-
publican President. 
But it has always been bipartisan. It 
has not always been unanimous. People 
have registered their concerns and 
their complaints. But up until now, 
they haven’t stood in the way of pass-
ing legislation. 
More recently, in 2011, each of the 
seven times that the debt limit was ad-
dressed, Congress did so on a bipartisan 
basis. This includes three times under 
the last administration, when Demo-
crats cooperated in order to protect the 
economy from catastrophe. 
I want to remind us that when Presi-
dent Obama was President and the Re-
publican majority in the Congress was 
threatening to not lift the debt limit, 
just the threat of that had an impact 
on our credit rating. Our credit rating 
went down. The mere discussion of not 
lifting the debt limit had a negative 
impact on our credit rating. 
Don’t you care about that? 
It is sad that Republican obstruction 
has delayed action for so long, and it is 
sad that they will not join us for a 
longer-term suspension. 
The full faith and credit of the 
United States must never be ques-
tioned and the financial security of 
families must never be gambled with, 
as our Republican colleagues seem to 
be doing, even though, as Mr. HOYER 
mentioned, that Mr. MCCONNELL at one 
point was saying was playing Russian 
roulette with the economy. 
Russian 
roulette 
from 
Moscow 
MITCH. Interesting. 
Democrats are for the people. I urge 
a strong bipartisan vote for this legis-
lation and for protecting the economic 
strength of America’s working fami-
lies. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the chair-
man for bringing this to the floor and 
ask for a unanimous vote on this im-
portant legislation. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
lot of money that we are talking about. 
But it is not just the volumes of 
money; it is the velocity with which we 
are spending money over these last 2 
years. 
Yes, the coronavirus is terrible. Yes, 
the American economy needed some 
help. But we passed the big American 
Rescue Plan in February, and the 
States and municipalities, as of this 
date, have spent 2.5 percent of that 
money. 
I am also on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. We are one of the 
principal authorizing committees in 
the United States House of Representa-
tives. Have we had a single hearing on 
how much money we have pushed out 
to the healthcare sector, to the States, 
to the municipalities? No, we have not. 
Have we had a single hearing of what 
is likely to be required going forward? 
The answer is: No, we have not. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter I penned to FRANK PALLONE, 
the chairman of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, asking him can we 
please do just a modicum of the over-
sight that we are required to do in the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5619 
October 12, 2021 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, October 7, 2021. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., 
Chairman, Energy and Commerce Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: I urge you to 
hold a hearing on the implementation of the 
American Rescue Plan, so that we may fulfil 
the oversight responsibilities of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. Nearly seven 
months have passed since the enactment of 
the American Rescue Plan, but despite cost-
ing the American taxpayer $1.9 trillion, 
many Americans have yet to feel or recog-
nize its effects. As the House committee with 
jurisdiction over the Department of Health 
and Human Services, the agency responsible 
for allocating many of these funds, it is only 
reasonable that proper oversight is enforced 
to ensure Congressional intent is practiced 
and the taxpayer dollar used accordingly 
during implementation. 
During consideration of the American Res-
cue Plan, many lawmakers heard from states 
and localities on the urgent need for emer-
gency funding. While I do not doubt that 
many localities were in need of assistance, it 
was reported that as of this summer, most 
had spent only 2.5% of the $350 billion that 
was appropriated to states and localities in 
the American Rescue Plan. 
I understand this large sum of funds will 
take time to properly distribute, and states 
and localities must be prudent and spend al-
locations in ways which will prove to be an 
investment and grant long-term security, 
but it is imperative that these funds have 
adequate direction from Congress stipulating 
the appropriateness of their expenditure. 
States and localities need certainty that 
they are spending funds as directed and that 
these funds will not be at risk of being re-
voked for improper use. Fortunately, as di-
rected by Section 602 of the American Rescue 
Plan, the Treasury Department is requiring 
expenditure reports with an interim report 
for all states and localities having been due 
on August 31, 2021, and quarterly reports 
starting October 31, 2021 for states and cities 
with populations of 250,000 residents or more. 
I am afraid that Congress and the Amer-
ican people may lose sight of the signifi-
cance that $1.9 trillion in one single stimulus 
package may mean and the responsibility as-
sociated with appropriating such funds. 
While these funds were appropriated with the 
intention of helping communities recover 
from and respond to the devastation of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, it is important that the 
American 
people 
are 
aware 
of 
specific 
projects being funded by this package. I have 
read reports of the American Rescue Plan 
being used by cities to buy 78 electric vehi-
cles, build technology labs at recreation cen-
ters, and fund long avoided infrastructure 
projects. Although these projects may have 
merit, are they really the intent of the 
American Rescue Plan? 
It has been a tumultuous and difficult year 
for Americans across the country, with busi-
nesses, schools, and social endeavors oper-
ating different than the norm—Congress and 
the Energy and Commerce Committee have 
been no different. However, as we continue 
to consider historically large spending pack-
ages, we have an obligation to our Constitu-
ents to oversee the implementation and use 
of these funds. 
Sincerely, 
MICHAEL C. BURGESS, M.D., 
Member of Congress. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, we have 
heard over and over again that what 
awaits is a manufactured crisis. The 
American people have some experience 
now dealing with manufactured crises. 
Since January of this year, they have 
seen a never-ending array of manufac-
tured crises. 
Look, I live in Texas. It is a border 
State. There are a lot of problems on 
the southern border. We hear about it 
every time we turn on the news. 
The border wall was supposed to be 
built. It was to help that problem. But 
there are stacks and stacks of material 
to build that border wall that are just 
sitting because the current administra-
tion has put a pause on all of that and 
said we are not building any more. 
What is going to happen to all of that 
material, that material that was paid 
for with borrowed money that, yes, is 
part of the debt? What is going to hap-
pen to that? It is going to be stolen; it 
is going to be diverted to some other 
use, probably to no good end. 
But had that wall been in place, 
maybe the streams of people that were 
coming across the border at Del Rio a 
couple of weeks ago could have been in-
terrupted. 
The Dallas Morning News, on Sun-
day, had a story about how 250 buses 
transported 
Haitians 
from 
Central 
America up to the lower Rio Grande 
Valley. 
Could 
our 
Department 
of 
Homeland Security not have had some 
visibility on who was renting 250 buses 
to bring the 15,000 people to the south-
ern border? Maybe they could have 
spent some of that money in that re-
gard. 
I don’t know if anybody has noticed, 
but gas is $1 a gallon more than it was 
9 months ago. We are in for a cold win-
ter, Mr. Speaker. It would be nice to 
have some provisions to deal with that 
cold winter, but this administration 
has turned a blind eye to the energy 
needs of our constituents in this coun-
try. 
It is almost as if they wanted to 
harm the people of this country. I 
know that is not true. I know them to 
be good people. But at the same time, 
what I hear from my constituents is an 
incredible amount of frustration with 
what is coming from the administra-
tion and what is coming from the Con-
gress. It is time we took care of the 
needs of the American people, and we 
ought to get on with it. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the 
gentleman, my colleague on the Rules 
Committee, none of what he just stated 
has anything to do with what we are 
debating here today. What we are de-
bating here today is whether or not we 
are going to pay the bills that have 
been accumulated, whether we are 
going to pay the bills accumulated as a 
result of an unpaid-for tax cut, mostly 
for wealthy people, and other spending. 
The gentleman complains about gas 
prices. Imagine what is going to hap-
pen to gas prices if we default on our 
debt, if we destroy the entire economy. 
Imagine the harsh impacts on every-
day, average citizens. 
All of the other stuff is nice rhetoric, 
but we are talking about here today 
whether or not we should pay the bills 
that many on the other side voted to 
accumulate. But now, all of a sudden, 
they don’t want to pay the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I heard the news today 
that Mr. YARMUTH will not be running 
for reelection, and I think it is a sad 
day for this institution. He conducts 
himself with grace, with dignity, al-
ways sticking to the facts, and he has 
a demeanor about him that I think all 
of us should try to emulate. It is kind 
of sad to hear that news today, but I do 
admire him greatly. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. YAR-
MUTH), the distinguished chairman of 
the Budget Committee. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman of the Rules Committee 
for both yielding and for his kind re-
marks. 
Mr. Speaker, this is what our Repub-
lican colleagues won’t tell the Amer-
ican people: The debt ceiling does not 
control spending. It is raised, as has 
been said multiple times now, to cover 
the debt we have already incurred. 
In this case, a lot of that debt is from 
the 2017 Trump tax scam. Our Repub-
lican colleagues will tell you they 
voted to cover that debt. But here is 
the deal: That massive giveaway to 
wealthy corporations and individuals 
has a price tag of nearly $2 trillion. 
This year, it added $271 billion to the 
debt. Republicans are refusing to pay 
that bill. Next year, it will add another 
$243 billion to the debt. Are Repub-
licans going to pay that bill? How 
about in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2025 or fis-
cal 2026? 
They refuse to vote to pay those 
bills. This whole debate about the debt 
ceiling has become a dangerous lie, a 
very dangerous lie. 
The truth is, the debt ceiling needs 
to be repealed or at least it needs to be 
reformed so we can put an end to this 
political brinkmanship that will con-
tinue to threaten our economy and the 
livelihoods of American families for 
years. It is time to end this charade. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, as we hear so much 
about this wonderful bipartisan history 
of this debt ceiling, I just want to point 
out that the last five times Repub-
licans controlled the House, Senate, 
and the White House, the current 
Speaker and the entire current Demo-
cratic leadership only voted to raise 
the debt limit one time. So I wish that 
we would make sure that we point out 
the accurate history of how this has 
happened. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH). 
b 1700 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota for pointing out the truth. I 
am glad that I decided to wear my 
boots today because it is getting deep 
in the swamp up here today, listening

October 12, 2021 
to the garbage on the other side of the 
aisle. 
Let’s put it this way: The Democrats 
have already pushed through $2 trillion 
of reckless, wasteful spending at the 
expense of working-class Americans, 
and now they are wanting to push 
through another $4.3 trillion reckless 
spending bill that will reward their po-
litical friends, their wealthy donors, 
and their allies, at the expense of 
working-class Americans. 
Let me tell you, the Budget Com-
mittee chairman said we should in-
crease the debt limit a gazillion dol-
lars—a gazillion. 
We have folks on the other side of the 
aisle just in the last 30 minutes that 
have said we should not have a debt 
limit. This is the Democratic Party. 
They do not believe there should be 
limit in debt. They have said this on 
the floor. But that is not what the 
American people want. 
If you want to raise the debt $480 bil-
lion until December, guess what? Lis-
ten to the White House. Just last week, 
the White House said there is $480 bil-
lion of unobligated funds from your 
Biden bailout bill from March. Use 
that. 
But, no, you want to continue to 
take more money from working-class 
Americans by putting in debt their 
kids and grandkids. Of course, on the 
other side of the aisle, they will tell 
you: Oh, we will never pay back the 
debt. That is what comes from the 
other side of the aisle. 
Folks, we have so many crises right 
now: a border crisis, an Afghanistan 
crisis, an inflation crisis, an energy cri-
sis, all as a result of Joe Biden, NANCY 
PELOSI, and CHUCK SCHUMER. And now 
they are trying to increase the debt 
$480 billion more that will fuel those 
crises. 
The 
American 
people 
have 
had 
enough. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, you 
wonder why people hate Congress. I 
mean, we have somebody on the Budget 
Committee who is trying to make us 
believe that, in fact, raising the debt 
limit somehow controls spending. 
The bottom line is the debt limit is 
about paying the bills that have al-
ready 
been 
accumulated, 
including 
many of the bills that my friend who 
just spoke voted to accumulate, includ-
ing a tax cut bill that benefited the 
well off and the well connected. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER), 
the distinguished chairman of the 
Joint Economic Committee. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the legislation to pay Amer-
ica’s bills and avoid a catastrophic de-
fault. 
Raising the debt ceiling doesn’t incur 
new debts. It simply allows the Treas-
ury Department to continue to pay the 
debts that this Congress already voted 
to incur. 
Ninety-seven percent of the debt sub-
ject to the current increase was passed 
before President Biden took office. 
The big drivers of this debt limit in-
crease were the CARES Act programs 
we all supported, higher defense spend-
ing under the previous President, and 
enormous Republican tax cuts that 
were not paid for, which mostly went 
to the wealthy. 
Since 1960, Congress has raised the 
debt ceiling 78 times, mostly when a 
Republican was in the White House. 
Mr. Speaker, this has always been a 
bipartisan vote. In 2017, when Donald 
Trump was President, more than 90 
percent of the Democrats voted to in-
crease the debt limit. In 2019, when 
Donald Trump was President, more 
than 90 percent of the Democrats voted 
to increase the debt limit. 
It should be a bipartisan vote now. 
The simple fact is, if it wasn’t, if Con-
gress fails to raise the debt ceiling, it 
would mean we refuse to pay our debts, 
and that would lead to destruction. 
I am confused, too. In one way, this 
is very asymmetric. We help the Re-
publican Presidents, but they refuse to 
help us. I don’t understand that. 
My friend from South Carolina, in 
front of the Rules Committee, said this 
is because of the Build Back Better 
bill, the proposed $3.5 trillion that is 
coming. That fails to recognize that 
during the Trump administration, the 
U.S. Federal debt went up $7.8 trillion, 
more than the theoretical maximum of 
Build Back Better. 
But even more importantly, Build 
Back Better would not add one penny 
to the Federal deficit. We have worked 
very hard to raise revenues from the 
people who can most afford it, whose 
lives would not be diminished one iota 
by the revenues that we would raise. 
Millions of Americans would lose 
their jobs if this debt ceiling doesn’t go 
through. 
The 
unemployment 
rate 
would shoot upward to 9 percent; pay-
ments would cease for Social Security 
recipients, veterans, and hospitals that 
take Medicare and Medicaid; and our 
Federal 
workforce 
and 
our 
troops 
wouldn’t be paid. 
Ten years ago, the Government Ac-
countability Office said the U.S. had to 
pay an extra $1.3 billion in borrowing 
costs because of debt limit brinkman-
ship. 
If you want to address the debt, the 
obvious way to do it is to pay for your 
spending, to be fiscally responsible. 
That is exactly what my Democratic 
colleagues are doing with the Build 
Back Better bill, where my colleagues 
and I on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee spent many, many months fig-
uring out how to best pay for these in-
vestments. 
It is pretty ridiculous, Mr. Speaker, 
that the party that claimed a $2 tril-
lion handout to the wealthy would pay 
for itself, mostly in dividends and 
stock buybacks, now complains about 
the debt. 
If you are really worried about the 
debt, there are ways to address it with-
out taking a wrecking ball to the U.S. 
economy. 
Preventing a recession should have 
unanimous support in this body. It is a 
concerning prospect that we will have 
to do all this again in 2 or 3 months, 
and Republican leaders are already 
promising even stronger opposition to 
avoiding the self-inflicted destruction 
of our economy. 
Sooner or later, if we don’t all recog-
nize the risks and take an adult, re-
sponsible approach to governance, the 
worst will happen, and we will default. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL). 
Mr. 
STEIL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today 
Washington is once again kicking the 
can down the road. We are adding near-
ly $2 million in debt per minute. 
What is this institution doing about 
it? Kicking the can down the road, 
while at the same time the Democrats 
across the aisle want to spend trillions 
more. 
By borrowing another $480 billion, 
Speaker PELOSI and President Biden 
are simply kicking the can down the 
road. We can’t continue to avoid our 
responsibilities and spend ourselves 
into oblivion. 
Those across the aisle are not being 
honest with the American people who 
are going to have to ultimately pay for 
this. 
This is not responsible. Prices for 
workers, families, and seniors continue 
to rise because of Washington’s out-of- 
control spending. Yet, Washington re-
fuses to take accountability for its 
spending problem. 
Today’s vote will simply kick the can 
down the road once again and fail to 
get our spending here in Washington 
under control. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this bill. We must stop the out-of-con-
trol spending in Washington. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank the distinguished gentleman 
from Massachusetts and my friends on 
the other side of the aisle. 
The good news is that Democrats, 
and I hope some good friends, some Re-
publicans, will not kick American fam-
ilies down the aisle and down the road. 
That is why we are here today, to en-
sure that those human beings will not 
be kicked down the road. 
I am stunned by the actions of my 
friends that would not support the pay-
ing of your bills. 
Let us not discard the reality of what 
lifting the debt ceiling means. It is the 
bills that have already accrued. It is 
the light bill; it is the telephone bill; it 
is the heat bill; it is the tuition for col-
lege. Those are bills that have accrued 
that we are paying for. That is the ex-
ample the American people ask. 
Then we are trying to work together 
to ensure that lead poisoning that is 
killing our children in water—that the 
INVEST Act is ready to go with the 
Build Back Better, that broadband is 
ready to go with the Build Back Bet-
ter. 
Then, of course, we want to do some-
thing innovative. The housing crisis in

America is unbelievable. Homelessness 
is on the rise. Veterans who have 
pledged their life to us as Americans 
and who have put on the uniform un-
selfishly are homeless in droves. They 
are homeless in big cities, like Hous-
ton, Los Angeles, New York, and Chi-
cago, and in rural areas. None of that 
is attributed to local leaders. 
When I was home yesterday inter-
acting with the engine of the econ-
omy—construction 
companies 
and 
workers and engineers—they begged for 
having us come together, INVEST Act, 
Build Back Better. This bill includes a 
$35 billion investment in the HOME In-
vestment Partnerships. 
We want to make sure that Medicare 
is strong, Federal Medicaid. We want 
housing, climate change, the immigra-
tion reform. There are many elements 
that will stop pushing the American 
people down the road like a can and 
just keep saying to them: We will get it 
one day. We will get it another day. 
Provide education for all those work-
ers who were stymied during the pan-
demic. Stop the eviction of individuals 
who I saw come out into the street. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article from The New York Times. 
[From the New York Times, October 8, 2021] 
WHAT THE DEBT CEILING MEANS FOR SOCIAL 
SECURITY AND MORE 
The federal government is about two weeks 
away from being unable to pay its bills—and 
that could delay benefit payments to tens of 
millions of retirees, Medicare and Medicaid 
providers, and numerous others receiving 
checks from the U.S. Treasury. 
Running into the federal borrowing limit 
could lead to a catastrophic default on the 
nation’s debt. Once the government reaches 
the ceiling—and exhausts all other measures 
to keep payments flowing—it will run out of 
funds for bills it has already promised to 
pay. 
To avoid such a calamity, Democrats are 
weighing a change to filibuster rules in order 
to hold a vote. Senator Mitch McConnell of 
Kentucky, the minority leader, has sug-
gested allowing a temporary increase until 
December, although that would merely post-
pone a default deadline for a matter of 
weeks. 
The government has never defaulted on its 
obligations, so what would happen is un-
clear. But the effects could be wide-ranging, 
covering programs as varied as Social Secu-
rity benefits and school lunches. 
‘‘There is no public playbook for what to 
do when you breach the debt limit,’’ said 
Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the 
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et, a fiscal watchdog group. ‘‘We don’t know 
what will happen.’’ 
WHAT PROGRAMS COULD BE AFFECTED? 
A lot, covering a lot of people. 
A default could potentially—but not nec-
essarily—delay the payment of Social Secu-
rity benefits, which reach about 65 million 
Americans in some form. 
It could also delay payments to govern-
ment contractors, including hospitals that 
accept patients who use Medicare and Med-
icaid benefits. If the situation dragged on for 
weeks or months, it could threaten access to 
health care, Whitney Tucker, the deputy di-
rector of research on the State Fiscal Policy 
team at the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities, said in a recent note. 
Some state-run programs that use federal 
money, like those providing free or reduced- 
cost breakfast and lunch to low-income stu-
dents, might not be immediately reimbursed. 
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram, formerly known as food stamps, would 
also be affected. 
And it would probably halt payments being 
made to families under the newly expanded 
child tax credit, which in July began sending 
eligible families half of the credit in month-
ly installments. Roughly 35 million families 
received the benefit in July. 
WHEN COULD THIS HAPPEN? 
That’s not totally clear. The Treasury sec-
retary, Janet L. Yellen, has said the govern-
ment will hit the debt ceiling on Oct. 18. But 
some analysts believe the actual date could 
be pushed back a few days, or perhaps longer. 
It’s important to note that this situation 
is different from a government shutdown, 
which happens when Congress fails to pass 
bills that permit new spending. White House 
officials warn that running into the debt 
ceiling is far more damaging. 
WON’T THE GOVERNMENT STILL HAVE SOME 
MONEY? 
Yes, the Treasury will have some revenue 
coming in—from estimated quarterly income 
taxes, excise taxes and other sources—but 
the department has maintained that it does 
not have the authority to pick and choose 
which payments it will make. 
‘‘There is only one viable option to deal 
with the debt limit: Congress needs to in-
crease or suspend it, as it has done approxi-
mately 80 times, including three times dur-
ing the last administration,’’ a Treasury 
spokesman said. 
But if no agreement is reached, some pol-
icy experts say that the Treasury may ulti-
mately have to pick winners and losers—and 
that’s a difficult bind, because there are sev-
eral conflicting laws at play. 
The law says the government cannot bor-
row once it hits the debt limit, but the 14th 
Amendment to the Constitution says that 
the United States must honor its obliga-
tions. Other laws state that certain benefits 
and salaries must be paid. 
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THE GOVERNMENT 
COULD DO? 
The Treasury might decide to issue more 
bonds anyway and leave it to the Supreme 
Court to figure out the constitutional ques-
tions, said Len Burman, an institute fellow 
at the Urban Institute. 
‘‘They could ignore the debt limit,’’ he 
said. ‘‘It is a question that has never been 
adjudicated because it hasn’t come up be-
fore.’’ 
But previous administrations have rejected 
that approach, he said, and legal experts 
don’t agree about whether it would actually 
work. 
WHAT ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY? 
Social Security—which reaches tens of 
millions of Americans through retirement, 
disability and survivor benefits—is a bit dif-
ferent from other programs because it is 
largely financed through a dedicated payroll 
tax. It also has its own trust funds, which 
may give it more flexibility, some experts 
said. 
The taxes coming into the program aren’t 
enough to pay all of the benefits, according 
to Jason J. Fichtner, chief economist at the 
Bipartisan Policy Center, who held several 
positions, including acting principal deputy 
commissioner, at the Social Security Admin-
istration. But since the checks are sent out 
on a staggered basis, the agency could wait 
for more cash to come in, which would result 
in delayed payments. 
But there’s also at least one other possi-
bility. If the Treasury redeemed the special- 
issue bonds from the program’s trust fund to 
pay benefits—and then quickly replaced 
them 
with 
newly 
issued 
bonds—that 
wouldn’t raise the debt ceiling, Mr. Fichtner 
argues. 
It’s not clear whether the Treasury agrees 
with his assessment. 
WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN? 
If the United States were to default on its 
debts—that is, stop making payments on the 
Treasurys it has sold—there would almost 
certainly be major consequences in the glob-
al markets. 
The immediate effect would be that port-
folios held by investors as varied as pension 
funds and holders of 401(k)s would face a 
market tailspin. Even after any debt-ceiling 
standoff were resolved, global investors 
would demand higher interest payments on 
U.S. Treasury bonds—so the government’s 
borrowing in the future could become more 
expensive. 
A default may also make it more difficult 
for consumers to secure loans, and they 
would most likely pay more when they did. 
‘‘In the case of a debt default, it would 
quickly spark a credit crunch so the issue for 
borrowers becomes much more about wheth-
er you can get a loan in the first place,’’ said 
Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at 
Bankrate.com. ‘‘Lenders would likely freeze 
or cut credit lines on home equity lines of 
credit and credit cards. Personal loans would 
be harder to get and could see higher rates.’’ 
WHAT IF THE PROBLEM ISN’T QUICKLY 
RESOLVED? 
An extended impasse would cause signifi-
cant damage to the U.S. economy, Wendy 
Edelberg and Louise Sheiner, both senior fel-
lows at the Brookings Institution, a research 
group, wrote in a recent report. 
‘‘Even in a best-case scenario where the 
impasse is short-lived, the economy is likely 
to suffer sustained—and completely avoid-
able—damage, particularly given the chal-
lenges that Covid–19 poses to the health of 
the economy,’’ they wrote. 
If it dragged on through November, the 
federal government would have little choice 
but to significantly slash government spend-
ing by roughly $200 billion—a ‘‘devastating’’ 
blow to the economy, Mark Zandi, chief 
economist of Moody’s Analytics, said in a re-
cent analysis. 
And the increased expense of borrowing 
would only add to the hit in the long run. 
‘‘Americans would pay for this default for 
generations,’’ he said. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD an article from 
Forbes. 
[From Forbes, Oct. 4, 2021] 
DEFAULTING ON THE NATIONAL DEBT CEILING 
WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC FOR SMALL BUSI-
NESSES 
Here we go again. It seems every time this 
issue arises, lawmakers seem intent to put 
the U.S. economy and small businesses at 
risk. 
Unfortunately, the U.S. Department of 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said 
that the federal government will run out of 
money on October 18 if the debt ceiling is not 
raised. The government reached its debt 
limit at the end of July and Treasury has 
been taking steps to keep from defaulting. If 
the debt ceiling is not raised in the coming 
weeks, the U.S. will default on its debt for 
the first time in its history and that will be 
catastrophic for small businesses. 
There is no question that our national debt 
needs to be addressed in the coming years 
with a mixture of revenue raises and spend-
ing cuts as the Clinton Administration did in 
the 1990s. However, defaulting on the debt is 
not the answer. It will not be some teachable 
moment on government spending. Instead, it

will have unnecessary and irreversible con-
sequences for most all Americans. A Navi-
gator survey also found that 58 percent of 
Americans support raising the debt ceiling. 
Unfortunately, this has become a political 
issue. Just a few days ago, Senate Minority 
Leader McConnell blocked Democrats from 
using a simple majority to get this done. 
Why? Republicans may want to use this as 
a campaign issue against Democrats this 
coming fall trying to claim that they are 
growing the national debt. But, the real 
story is, the national debt has risen regard-
less of which party is in control. There will 
be a time when Republicans will be in the 
driver’s seat and need to raise the debt limit, 
and let’s hope Democrats move beyond poli-
tics because playing ‘‘chicken’’ with the debt 
limit is not good politics, not good for small 
business, not good for our national security, 
and not good for the economy. In fact, an 
analysis by Moody’s Analytics chief econo-
mist Mark Zandi estimates that defaulting 
on the national debt would wipe out as many 
as 6 million jobs and erase $15 trillion in 
household wealth. 
‘‘We can’t emphasize enough how disas-
trous it would be for Congress to consider a 
government shutdown if consensus cannot be 
met in advance of the funding deadline. 
Small businesses are especially vulnerable 
and many would not survive a government 
shutdown at this time due to the pandemic, 
particularly with the rapid spread of the 
Delta variant, and trying to move from crisis 
to recovery,’’ wrote Candace Waterman, 
President and CEO of Women Impacting Pub-
lic Policy, in a letter to U.S. House and Sen-
ate leadership. 
Here are five ways defaulting on the na-
tional debt would harm Main Streets across 
the country. 
1. More Expensive Small Business Loans 
A majority of credit rating agencies rate 
the U.S. federal government at AAA, the 
highest level. Defaulting on the debt would 
lead to an automatic downgrade of the coun-
try’s credit rating, driving up interest rates 
for all Americans. Small business loans will 
become costlier as private lenders are forced 
to increase their interest rates. Even Small 
Business Administration (SBA)-guaranteed 
loans, which are often lower cost and more 
accessible but still reflective of market con-
ditions, will become more expensive. 
2. Higher Credit Card Interest Rates 
Many small business owners use their per-
sonal credit cards to cover business expenses 
and manage debt. As with loan rates, small 
business credit card and personal credit card 
interest rates will also rise, squeezing the 
amount of capital small business owners 
have to work with and potentially driving 
them into more debt. 
3. Tightened Credit Markets 
One can look at the stories of Argentina 
and Greece to see what happens to a coun-
try’s credit markets when it defaults’ on its 
debt. The same will be the case for the 
United States if it follows in these countries’ 
footsteps. Credit markets will tighten up and 
U.S. banks will prioritize lending to busi-
nesses where they have pre-existing relation-
ships, which are more likely to be larger 
ones than small ones. Small businesses, espe-
cially unbanked ones and those in under-
served communities, would be at a severe 
disadvantage when they have the least finan-
cial cushion. 
4. Plunging Stock Markets 
Moody’s 
Report 
estimates 
that 
stock 
prices would likely plunge by one-third, 
sparking that $15 trillion loss in household 
wealth. This would be a one-two punch for 
small business owners who would see their 
own retirement savings dissipate and then 
lose business from consumers who are now 
dealing with their lost nest egg. In turn, 
larger public companies could lose value, 
thus making it harder to incorporate small 
businesses into their vendor supply chain. 
5. Delayed Treasury Payments 
The Treasury Department has been taking 
steps to meet its obligations, including pay-
ments to households such as Social Security. 
If the U.S. default on its debt, the govern-
ment would immediately need to stop more 
than 40 percent of expected payments, in-
cluding Social Security and other household 
income. There are a number of downstream 
effects this would have on small businesses, 
including a loss of customers and a strain on 
business owners and employees now taking 
steps to make ends meet for themselves and 
their loved ones. 
The American economy and its Main 
Streets are working through their greatest 
crisis since World War II. Both are still 
standing right now but a default on the na-
tional debt would be a knockout blow. Let’s 
stop playing politics and get the debt limit 
raised. Once that’s done, we can return to 
the important work of getting an infrastruc-
ture bill passed that has the ability to pave 
the way for the next generation of American 
small businesses and entrepreneurs. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
us do the debt extension that the Sen-
ate has given us, but let us not accept 
this paltry extension. Do it right in De-
cember and save the American people. 
Build Back Better and the INVEST 
Act, do it together. Do it now. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Rule governing debate of H.R. 2119, the 
‘‘Family Violence and Prevention Services Im-
provement Act,’’ H.R. 3992, the ‘‘Protect Older 
Job Applicants Act,’’ H.R. 3110, the ‘‘Pump for 
Nursing Mothers Act,’’ and the Senate Amend-
ment to the House Amendment to S. 1301, 
‘‘Temporary Extension of Public Debt Act.’’ 
SENATE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE AMENDMENT TO S. 1301 
TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT ACT 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, I rise in support 
of the rule governing debate for RCP 117–16, 
the Senate Amendment to the House Amend-
ment to S. 1301, ‘‘Temporary Extension of 
Public Debt Act,’’ a temporary stopgap meas-
ure raising the national debt limit by $480 bil-
lion and extending it through December 3, 
2021, which is imperative to avoid a wasteful, 
irresponsible, reckless threatening of the na-
tion’s singular indispensable asset: the full 
faith and credit of the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, preserving the full faith and 
credit of the United States by raising to the 
debt limit to ensure that America pays the bills 
for past expenditures when they come due is 
not a partisan exercise but an act of patriot-
ism, a recognition and embrace of the solemn 
obligation to preserve the unrivaled advan-
tages that flow from the ability provided in the 
Article I, Section 8, clause 2 of the Constitu-
tion to ‘‘borrow money on the credit of the 
United States.’’ 
Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the 
nation’s first and greatest Treasury Secretary, 
understood that the path to American pros-
perity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness 
which provided the affordable access to cap-
ital needed to fund internal improvements and 
economic growth. 
It is because of the existence and wise use 
of the Borrowing Power that the nation was 
able to expand its reaches, resources, and 
riches by financing the Louisiana Purchase, 
the purchase of Alaska from Russia, to fund 
the investments to end the Great Depression, 
to finance the mobilization of resources need-
ed in World War II to defeat fascism and save 
freedom in the nation and the world, to revive 
the economy after the catastrophic Great Re-
cession of 2008, and most recently, to protect 
the public health and safety and restore the 
economy during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This is why the ability to borrow money on 
the credit of the United States to finance its 
growth and protect its people and interests is 
essential to the national security and led Ham-
ilton to proclaim that ‘‘the proper funding of the 
present debt, will render it a national bless-
ing.’’ 
But to maintain this blessing, or to ‘‘render 
public credit immortal,’’ Hamilton understood 
that it was necessary that: ‘‘the creation of 
debt should always be accompanied with the 
means of extinguishment.’’ 
In other words, to retain and enjoy the pros-
perity that flows from good credit, it is nec-
essary for a nation to pay its bills. 
The United States has never defaulted on 
the payment of any debt incurred, and be-
cause of the size and strength of its economic 
and unmatched creditworthiness, is able to 
borrow on the lowest and most favorable 
terms of any nation or entity in the history of 
the world. 
So secure and reliable is a bond issues by 
the Department of Treasury that the United 
States is the preferred haven for investments 
of foreign governments, corporations, and sov-
ereign wealth funds. 
The interest rate charged the federal gov-
ernment of the United States is the base for 
which every rate, from the prime rate charged 
the richest corporation to rates charged small 
business on purchases to the mortgages rates 
and students loans taken out by consumers. 
If you raise the cost of borrowing for the 
government of the United States, you set off 
a chain reaction of increased interest rates for 
every other borrower in the United States and 
around the world. 
This is why leading public finance experts 
and agencies, like Moody’s Chief Economist 
Mark Zandi, have said it would be ‘‘cata-
clysmic’’ for the United States to default on its 
loan obligations. 
Republicans know the debt ceiling needs to 
be raised; in 2019 during the Trump Adminis-
tration, the Republican Senate Majority Leader 
marshalled Senate Republicans to vote to 
raise the debt ceiling, saying: ‘‘We raised the 
debt ceiling because America can’t default[,] 
that would be a disaster.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this debate over extending the 
debt limit is not about restraining future spend-
ing, it is about paying the bills piled up already 
under both Republican and Democratic admin-
istrations. 
The question of raising the national debt 
limit does not depend on how one feels about 
the Build Back Better agenda, as wildly pop-
ular as it is among all Americans, Democrats, 
Independents, and Republicans included. 
It is instead about preserving the singular 
asset of the United States, its enviable and 
unrivaled creditworthiness, to finance future in-
vestments beneficial to the national interest, 
like the provision of free college for two years, 
or $2 billion investment to reduce violence in 
communities approved by the Committee on 
the Judiciary, or investments to preserve and 
strengthen Medicaid expansion programs, or 
extend broadband to underserved rural and

urban areas, an action that will be as life- 
changing as the rural electrification program 
was in the 1930s. 
Mr. Speaker, if our friends across the aisle 
really want to shrink the deficit, reduce the na-
tional debt, practice fiscal responsibility, and 
bring about sustained economic growth and 
prosperity, there is a much better, easier, and 
more certain way to achieve these goals than 
by tampering with the U.S. Constitution. 
The easier and better way is for the Amer-
ican people to keep a Democrat in the White 
House and place Democratic majorities in the 
House and Senate. 
In the 1990s under the leadership of Presi-
dent Clinton the budget was balanced for four 
consecutive years, the national debt was paid 
down, the national debt, 23 million new jobs 
were created, and projected surpluses ex-
ceeded $5 trillion. 
Under President Obama the financial crisis 
and economic meltdown inherited from his Re-
publican predecessor was ended, the annual 
deficit was reduced by 67 percent, the auto in-
dustry was saved from collapse, and 15 mil-
lion jobs were created. 
In contrast, under every Republican admin-
istration since President Reagan the size of 
the deficit bequeathed to his successor was 
substantially larger than the deficit he inher-
ited, a major economic recession occurred, 
and economic growth was lower than it was at 
the beginning of his administration. 
To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and 
credit of the United States, protect American 
jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure 
the continued growth of the economy, I sup-
port and urge all Members to join me in voting 
for the Senate Amendment to the House 
Amendment to S. 1301, the temporary stop-
gap measure increasing the national debt limit 
by $480 billion and extending the public debt 
limit to December 3, 2021. 
H.R. 2119 ‘‘FAMILY VIOLENCE AND PREVENTION SERVICES 
IMPROVEMENT ACT’’ 
I rise today in support of the Rule governing 
debate of H.R. 2119, the ‘‘Family Violence and 
Prevention Services Improvement Act,’’ which 
will improve the protection and prevention for 
Americans affected by family violence, domes-
tic violence, and dating violence. 
Through FVPSA, survivors receive services 
such as emergency shelter, crisis counseling, 
safety planning, and assistance recovering 
from financial abuse and housing insecurity. 
The FVPSA supports life-saving services 
throughout the country via grants to states, 
tribal governments, and territories through 
three primary sets of activities, all of which are 
administered by HHS. 
First, the FCPSA funds a national domestic 
violence hotline receives calls for assistance 
related to this violence. The hotline provides 
crisis intervention and counseling, maintains a 
database of service providers, and provides 
referrals for victims and others affected by do-
mestic violence. 
Second, FVPSA funds efforts to prevent do-
mestic violence through a program known as 
Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancement 
and Leadership Through Allies (DELTA). 
Third, FVPSA supports direct services for 
victims and their families. Most of this funding 
is awarded via grants to states, territories, and 
tribes. 
FVPSA is the only federal funding source 
dedicated to providing support to domestic vio-
lence shelters and programs. 
FVPSA provides base core funding to sup-
port more than 1,600 local public, private, non-
profit and faith-based organizations and pro-
grams in their response to the urgent needs of 
over 1.3 million domestic violence victims and 
their children. 
In 2020, the National Network to End Do-
mestic Violence (NNEDV) found that in just 
one day, FVPSA-funded programs helped 
76,525 victims of domestic violence. 
However, over 11,000 people were unable 
to be served due to a lack of funding. 
This shortage of funding is especially severe 
with shelters serving rural and marginalized 
populations, and increased funding and cul-
turally-specific programs are essential to ad-
dressing the needs of these communities. 
FVPSA was first passed in 1984 and was 
most recently reauthorized in 2010. Its author-
ization expired in 2015. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill marks an historic effort 
to acknowledge and address the unique suf-
fering of family violence survivors from 
marginalized communities. 
We must recognize that not all survivors are 
a monolith. 
Different communities and cultures have dif-
ferent perceptions of domestic violence and 
reactions to it—therefore different communities 
and cultures need different treatments and 
prevention measures to address domestic vio-
lence. 
That is why I am proud to support this bill, 
which includes provisions that are tailored to 
these specific populations. 
Such provisions include: 
1. Providing new grants to local programs 
serving culturally specific or traditionally under-
served communities; 
2. Increasing access for survivors from ra-
cial and ethnic communities to services by 
creating a national grant program to build the 
capacity to address domestic violence; and 
3. Increasing funding for Native American 
tribes by allocating tribal grants as a set-aside 
to acknowledge their sovereign authority. 
In addition to addressing the special needs 
of minority communities, there is a litany of 
other exciting provisions in this bill that build 
upon the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act, such as: 
1. Increasing the funding authorization level 
to $253 million to address chronic under-
funding that resulted in 11,000 people not re-
ceiving services in a single day. 
2. Technologically updating the National Do-
mestic Violence Hotline and improving hotline 
services for underrepresented populations. 
3. Authorizing funding for tribal coalitions, 
which provide support to tribal domestic vio-
lence programs but are not currently author-
ized by statute to receive FVPSA funding. 
4. Authorizing new grants of up to $150,000 
to each state, territorial and tribal coalition to 
prevent domestic violence. 
A bill of this nature is incredibly important 
for my home state of Texas, where it is esti-
mated that 1 in 3 Texans will be a victim of 
domestic violence during their lifetime. 
In Texas, 29 percent of domestic violence 
victims are Black despite making up only 12 
percent of the population. 
The share of domestic violence victims in 
Texas who are Native American is twice as 
much as the proportion of Natives in the gen-
eral population. 
Mr. Speaker, no member should be compla-
cent with these egregious statistics. 
With this bill’s increased commitment to pre-
vention and treatment of family violence, we 
are sending a message to survivors that you 
are not forgotten. 
H.R. 3992 ‘‘PROTECT OLDER JOB APPLICANTS ACT’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in support of 
the Rule governing debate of H.R. 3992, the 
‘‘Protect Older Job Applicants Act,’’ which will 
amend the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act of 1967, which prohibits age-based dis-
crimination in hiring, to specifically prohibit em-
ployers 
from 
limiting, 
segregating, 
or 
classifying job applicants on the basis of age. 
People of all ages, but especially older ap-
plicants, must be protected from discriminatory 
practices and loopholes that hurt their chances 
to get a job, especially as we have seen that 
older American workers have disproportion-
ately experienced long-term unemployment in 
the COVID economy. 
The federal Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment Act (ADEA) of 1967 was passed to pro-
hibit age-based discrimination for current em-
ployees and job applicants. 
However, two federal circuit court decisions 
over the last five years have ruled that some 
provisions of the ADEA’s federal anti-age dis-
crimination protections only applied to current 
employees, not job applicants. 
In 2016, the 11th Circuit case Villarreal v. 
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company held that the 
ADEA disparate impact statute only covers 
employees, but not older applicants, and in 
2019, the 7th Circuit adopted the same inter-
pretation in Kleber v. CareFusion Corporation. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to re-
view the appellate court decisions. 
Currently, employers, especially those within 
the 7th and 11th Circuits, have a valid defense 
to claims under the ADEA where external job 
applicants allege they have been negatively 
impacted by hiring practices on the basis of 
their age. 
H.R. 3992 would give external candidates 
the express right under federal law to bring 
these types of claims against employers. 
This bill will include the job application proc-
ess in ADEA’s anti-discrimination provisions. 
Specifically, this bill will make it unlawful ‘‘to 
limit, segregate, or classify . . . [job appli-
cants] in any way which would deprive or tend 
to deprive any individual of employment op-
portunities or otherwise adversely affect his 
status as . . . [a job applicant], because of 
such individual’s age.’’ 
According to the AARP, 1 in 4 workers age 
45 and older have been subjected to negative 
comments about their age from supervisors or 
coworkers, and 76 percent see age discrimi-
nation as a hurdle to finding a new job. 
In one University of California, Irvine, study, 
re´sume´s were sent out on behalf of more than 
40,000 fictitious applicants of different ages for 
thousands of low-skill jobs like janitors, admin-
istrative assistants and retail sales clerks in 12 
cities. 
This study found that the older the applicant 
was, the fewer callbacks the applicant re-
ceived. 
This study also found that age discrimina-
tion has the highest impact on women, who 
suffer more age discrimination then men start-
ing in their 40s. 
According to David Neumark, a professor of 
economics who oversaw the study, ‘‘[t]he evi-
dence of age discrimination against women 
. . . pops out in every study’’ conducted on 
age discrimination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5624 
October 12, 2021 
Ageism is still very much present in our so-
ciety, and it is important we acknowledge that 
we still have much work to do to correct this 
bias and give every job applicant a fair and 
equal opportunity when applying for a job. 
H.R. 3110 ‘‘PUMP FOR NURSING MOTHERS ACT’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 
3110, the ‘‘Pump for Nursing Mothers Act,’’ 
which will close an unintentional loophole in 
the 2010 Break Time for Nursing Mothers Act. 
The 2010 law requires employers to provide 
break time and a place for hourly wage-earn-
ing and some salaried employees to express 
breast milk at work for one year after the birth 
of the employee’s child. 
Unfortunately, this law unintentionally ex-
cluded a quarter of all working women—nearly 
nine million employees—from protection. 
H.R. 3110 closes this coverage gap by ex-
tending the law’s protections to cover salaried 
employees as well as other categories of em-
ployees currently exempted from protections, 
such as teachers, nurses, and farmworkers. 
H.R. 3110 would also provide employers 
clarity on paid and unpaid pumping time. 
The bill leaves in place existing law pro-
tecting many salaried workers from having 
their pay docked and clarifies that employers 
must pay an hourly employee for any time 
spent pumping if the employee is also work-
ing. 
Lastly, the bill would ensure that nursing 
mothers have access to remedies that are 
available for other violations of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act. 
New parents face an incredible amount of 
increased difficulties while juggling work, fam-
ily and mental and emotional tolls that are ex-
acerbated as a new parent. 
According to a study published in Reviews 
in Obstetrics and Gynecology, breastfeeding 
provides health benefits for not only infants, 
but also for mothers. 
Abstaining from breastfeeding has been as-
sociated with an increase in developing var-
ious types of cancers, type 2 diabetes, heart 
attacks, retained gestational weight gain and 
metabolic syndrome in adult women. 
For infants, not being breastfed is associ-
ated with infectious illnesses such as pneu-
monia, ear infections, gastroenteritis, and can 
increase the risk of developing childhood- 
onset obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, leukemia 
and SIDS. 
This bill will ensure that mothers will no 
longer be forced to choose between their own 
health, their infant’s health, and their income. 
The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act will al-
leviate the disparities that currently exist be-
tween breastfeeding employees and their co-
workers, sending a clear message that the 
workforce will protect and support women who 
opt to balance a career and motherhood. 
For these reasons, I encourage all Members 
to support the Rule governing debate for H.R. 
2119, the ‘‘Family Violence and Prevention 
Services Improvement Act,’’ H.R. 3992, the 
‘‘Protect Older Job Applicants Act,’’ and H.R. 
3110, the ‘‘Pump for Nursing Mothers Act.’’ 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to hear from my colleagues 
across the aisle this notion that debt 
limit votes are always bipartisan. 
I just want to point out again, how-
ever, that in the last 20 years there 
were five occasions where the party in 
power had to pass the debt limit 
through the Senate by themselves. 
This includes when then-Senator Biden 
and Senator SCHUMER
voted against 
raising the debt ceiling under Presi-
dent George W. Bush. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota for 
exposing that facts are very stubborn 
things. 
Mr. Speaker, what am I missing 
here? The Democrat leadership just 
lectured us on how critical it is for all 
of us to vote for their huge debt ceiling 
increase as an obligation, as our duty. 
Yet Democrat leadership, we are 
showing, has voted against debt ceil-
ings many times. I have quotes here 
from their commentary. It would cre-
ate uncertainty in the overall econ-
omy, leading to job-destroying credit 
downgrades, et cetera, et cetera. 
Mr. Speaker, this is hypocrisy, and 
my constituents and the American peo-
ple are very tired of it. 
As well, to say that this debt ceiling 
is for past bills is false. Let’s then set 
the debt ceiling at a responsible level, 
not at the level which just happens to 
accommodate 
the 
$5 
trillion-plus 
planned reconciliation tax-and-spend 
bill they are working on. 
Asking us to raise a credit card limit 
trillions and have no say at all in how 
it is spent, Mr. Speaker, that is irre-
sponsible, and I won’t be part of it. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me just say to my good friend, 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota, yes, 
individual Democrats on occasion have 
voted ‘‘no’’ on the debt ceiling, and the 
party in control ends up carrying the 
day. 
But I guess I would ask her, does she 
know how many times Democrats 
threatened to filibuster the raising of 
the debt ceiling in the Senate to make 
it virtually impossible for the party in 
control to be able to pass it? 
I am happy to yield to her, but the 
answer to that is zero. Zero. 
I said this before when we debated 
this a couple of weeks ago. You know, 
I don’t expect my Republican friends to 
do the responsible thing, but I expect 
them to get out of the way so that we 
can. That is what is at stake here 
today. 
Again, let me remind all my col-
leagues what happens if, in fact, we 
don’t extend the debt limit. Again, ac-
cording to the nonpartisan Moody’s 
Analytics, Mark Zandi says such a cri-
sis could result in a loss of 6 million 
U.S. jobs, and $15 trillion in household 
wealth would be wiped out. Obviously, 
it is something that we cannot easily 
recover from, if we could ever recover 
from 
it, 
especially 
after 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Let me just say, I am so happy to 
hear that my Republican friends fi-
nally have seen the light on the debt. 
Where have you been? Where were you 
when Donald Trump brought his tax 
cut bill for the well off and the well 
connected? You had no problem at all 
piling on $2 trillion to the debt. Re-
member the debate we had on the 
floor? No big deal, no big deal. 
I mean, would you reconsider that 
vote now? Or do you want to take back 
the vote that many of you cast—I 
think wisely so—to help provide COVID 
relief money to families that were 
struggling because of the worst pan-
demic in our lifetimes? Do you want to 
take that back? 
Come on. This debate is embar-
rassing. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
b 1715 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, to answer my friend’s 
question about would we do this again 
on tax cuts, the answer is absolutely. 
We grew the economy. We created 
jobs. We lifted 6 million people out of 
poverty. And guess what—2 years in a 
row, we have record revenues in the 
Treasury coffers to bring down our 
deficits and our national debt, which 
by the way, is the greatest threat to 
this country and the prospects of our 
children inheriting the blessings of lib-
erty and prosperity. 
Mr. Speaker, but instead of putting 
that as the central issue of debate 
today, we are here—we flew from all 
over the country—to vote to raise the 
debt ceiling, but it is buried in a bill 
that 
has 
family 
violence, 
nursing 
mothers, protecting old job applicants. 
I don’t know what costume party I 
have arrived at here in Washington, 
but Halloween has come early here be-
cause nothing on this rule bill says, 
‘‘debt limit.’’ 
It has nursing mothers—I know that 
my Democrat colleagues want to be in-
volved in every facet and phase of the 
lives of the American people, including 
nursing mothers, but the reality is, we 
are broke. Our budget process is com-
pletely dysfunctional. We ought to be 
talking about spending caps, no budg-
et, no recess, debt targets; things that 
we could work together on to actually 
get on a sustainable path to fiscal san-
ity. 
But instead, we bury a debt ceiling 
vote—which is what this is—in a rule 
bill about family violence, older Amer-
icans, and nursing mothers. I mean, 
that is the most Washington shuck- 
and-jive thing I have seen in a long 
time. 
What 
deception. 
What 
swampiness. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why the Amer-
ican people can’t stand this institu-
tion, and they certainly can’t trust 
this institution to do the people’s busi-
ness. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, oh my 
goodness. The gentleman says that we 
buried the debt limit somehow in this

rule. I will lend him my glasses. It says 
in the title: Increase the public debt 
limit. 
I don’t know how much clearer it 
could be. It is in the title. Did you not 
read the rule? 
Mr. Speaker, by the way, we met in 
the Committee on Rules on S. 1301 on 
September 29—2 weeks ago. On that 
same day, we debated the bill on the 
House floor and voted on it—up or 
down. Fully transparent—218 Demo-
crats voted yes; 1 Republican voted 
yes; 2 Democrats voted no; 210 Repub-
licans voted no. 
It was a fully transparent process. 
What are you talking about? 
Mr. Speaker, what we are dealing 
with today is a Senate amendment to 
that very same bill. We don’t need to 
start the process of hearings and mark-
ups and debate all over again for a Sen-
ate amendment to a bill that we have 
already debated and voted on—and by 
the way, a Senate amendment that was 
inspired by MITCH MCCONNELL, the Re-
publican leader. 
So don’t just come here and make 
stuff up. The debt limit is in the title 
of the rule, for goodness sake. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I point out that my col-
league from the Committee on Rules 
points out that we did debate this bill, 
S. 1301, a couple of weeks ago. But he 
also pointed out that there is a Senate 
amendment that was added to it that 
we are not debating right now. So it is 
not entirely the same bill that we 
talked about 2 weeks ago. I wanted to 
make sure that was pointed out be-
cause it is not the same bill. 
Mr. Speaker, obviously, there is lots 
of discussion and input that people 
want to have on this debt ceiling issue, 
and I really do feel the need to say it 
again: this is an irresponsible way to 
run Congress. And the Democrats are 
not giving this debt limit extension the 
proper debate. What we are actually 
debating right now is the rule. We are 
not debating the actual issue of the 
debt ceiling and talking about it in 
depth, as we should be. I wanted to 
make sure that the American people 
understood that that is what we are 
doing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLY). 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I was sitting in my of-
fice, and I couldn’t help hearing that 
this is kitchen table economics, so I 
just want to reduce it down to what 
kitchen table economics actually is. 
This is a country that has an income 
of about $3.5 trillion a year. Meaning, if 
you were a regular family, that means 
you make about $35,000 a year. Let’s re-
duce it to kitchen table economics. 
But we then turn around and spend 
$6.5 trillion, so that is telling the aver-
age family back home: Mr. and Mrs. 
America, understand something, you 
make $35,000 a year. You should be 
spending $65,000 a year and just in-
creasing your total debt. 
We are at right now is between fund-
ed and unfunded liabilities. America is 
on the hook for $130 trillion. This is a 
pathway to destruction. Now we are 
going to point fingers back and forth: 
Well, you guys raised it, and you 
should have raised it. 
Mr. Speaker, you know what? There 
is no such thing as a debt ceiling here. 
There is no debt ceiling here. This is a 
sunroof. All we do is open it any time 
we want to irresponsibly spend money, 
and we just go ahead and keep spending 
and spending. 
It all falls on the backs of not only 
our grandchildren and our children but 
also on this current generation. This is 
absolutely insane and totally irrespon-
sible. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
hearing two things from the other side. 
One, is that they are fine with ignor-
ing the debt if it is on things that they 
like. And then two, I am hearing that 
they are fine with defaulting on the 
debt, therefore throwing our economy 
into ruin. Talk about irresponsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I just want to 
thank the distinguished majority lead-
er for sharing with us he has voted 49 
times to raise the debt ceiling, because 
when he came into this body, the debt 
was about $1 trillion. Today it is $28.5 
trillion. 
So thank you—I guess—on behalf of 
the people of America who are staring 
at $28.5 trillion of debt. 
Here is the thing: My colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle are asking us 
to support a half-a-trillion-dollar in-
crease in the debt—half a trillion dol-
lars. And the American people can’t 
even keep up with what those numbers 
even mean. But they do know that 
those dollars are being used to fund 
government tyranny over their lives. 
That is what those dollars are being 
used for—for a border that is not se-
cure; for cartels that are ripping into 
Texas; for critical race theory being 
taught to our children; to not fund po-
lice; to have the FBI going after par-
ents and school boards; vax mandates; 
shutting down businesses; forcing peo-
ple to comply or they lose their job; en-
ergy poverty, preventing people from 
actually getting the energy to heat 
their homes, drive their cars, and go to 
work. That is what my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle want us to 
borrow half a trillion dollars to keep 
funding. 
So please forgive me if I vote ‘‘no’’ to 
rack up more debt for my kids and 
grandkids, to fund the tyranny over 
the minds and the hearts of the Amer-
ican people that my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle wish to continue 
to fund. And no, I haven’t voted for a 
debt ceiling increase before. And I cer-
tainly haven’t 49 times to raise the 
debt from $1 trillion to $28.5 trillion, as 
has the majority leader. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to save my breath, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding. 
f 
MOTION TO ADJOURN 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I move that 
the House do now adjourn. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to adjourn 
offered by the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. BIGGS). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 198, nays

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, it is 
unfortunate that, yet again, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
have chosen to operate without input 
from the minority. Voting for increas-
ing the debt ceiling without proper 
consideration in the House is simply ir-
responsible. These bills include trou-
bling consequences for small busi-
nesses. 
Given that the Democrats are unwill-
ing to accept Republican input on any-
thing else they are working to pass, in-
cluding but not limited to stripping the 
Hyde amendment from all legislation 
possible, something that is in moral 
opposition to millions of Americans, I 
see no reason this should be any dif-
ferent. Again, Democrats can pass this 
extension using their majority. 
Mr. Speaker, we could have done so 
much good while addressing these top-
ics. I am deeply disappointed that the 
majority chooses to pursue these bills 
without including House Republicans 
in negotiations. I ask that, in the fu-
ture, they give us all the opportunity 
to come together for the good of the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule; I op-
pose the underlying bills; and I ask 
Members to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

October 12, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. We are 
on the precipice of what economists 
call financial Armageddon, financial 
Armageddon. Mark Zandi has said: 
‘‘Even if resolved quickly, Americans 
would pay for this default for genera-
tions.’’ 
Their answer, according to virtually 
all Republicans, is to go home. Really? 
If we defaulted, 6 million jobs would be 
lost, unemployment would skyrocket 
to 9 percent, and $15 trillion in house-
hold wealth will be wiped away. Don’t 
take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. That 
is 
according 
to 
the

The only solution my Republican 
friends can come up with is to leave 
town. 
Senate Republicans tried to filibuster 
this deal that MITCH MCCONNELL devel-
oped to temporarily raise the debt 
limit. Now House Republicans have 
used the tools that they have here to 
unleash their own form of obstruction. 
This isn’t about whether you like 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s compromise. I sure 
don’t. I wanted to take the debt ceiling 
head-on in a longer term way. But this 
is about whether you want to lose 6 
million jobs, see unemployment at 9 
percent, and watch $15 trillion in 
household wealth evaporate, whether 
or not you want to cause a financial 
catastrophe that will be felt for genera-
tions. 
Members just cast their votes. We 
know which side they are on. Mr. 
Speaker, 198 Republicans voted to leave 
town to adjourn this Congress without 
solving the massive problem in front of 
us. That is stunning, Mr. Speaker. This 
is the sort of thing that can make you 
cynical about Congress and about the 
direction of our country. 
But I choose to focus on the 223 Mem-
bers, including five Republicans, who 
voted to stay here today to pay our 
bills. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this rule, vote ‘‘yes’’ on protecting 
the full faith and credit of the United 
States of America, and vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
preventing financial Armageddon. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The previous question was ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on adoption of the resolu-
tion. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays 
206, not voting 7, as follows:

So the resolution was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
Stated against: 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, due to a 
previous commitment to co-host the WATERS 
summit in Greenville, NC for the purpose of 
identifying potential solutions to mitigate flood-
ing of my constituents—and because of the 
schedule change by the Speaker—I was not 
able to make the vote on the debt limit in-
crease. Had I been present, I would have 
noted ‘‘nay’’ on Rollcall No. 315. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, had I been 
present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall 
No. 314 and ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 315.

COM-
MENDATION 
FOR 
SERGEANT 
THEODORE ACHESON 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Sergeant Theodore Ach-
eson, U.S. Army for his service to both the 
Army and to causes greater than himself. 
Throughout his life, he has fought for freedom 
and worked tirelessly to improve the lives of 
others. 
As a photographer with the mission to pro-
vide unvarnished images of combat, SGT Ach-
eson served in a unique capacity in the Viet-
nam War, neighboring Thailand, and Korea. 
Often exposed to enemy fire, he captured 
gripping images of our nation’s heroes. His 
work, often featured in news broadcasts and 
publications, combined the skill of a photo-
journalist committed to capturing life in the 
moment with the eye of an artist. 
Following the end of his military service, 
SGT Acheson moved to Georgetown, TX 
where he continued contributing his consider-
able talents and energies to improving the 
lives of others through his membership and 
service in numerous charitable organizations 
supporting young leaders, education, and vet-
erans. A Purple Heart recipient himself, SGT 
Acheson was instrumental in having George-
town designated as the First Purple Heart City 
in Texas. Thanks to his tireless efforts, 
Georgetown has made it easier for veterans to 
get the health services they have earned and 
reminds our heroes that they are not alone nor 
forgotten. SGT Acheson’s commitment to 
stand by and support our nation’s veterans 
and their families exemplifies the very best of 
Texas values. 
I commend SGT Theodore Acheson’s in-
credible service to the Army, his nation, and 
his community. His patriotism, citizenship, and 
devotion to others makes him a worthy recipi-
ent of a Congressional Veterans Commenda-
tion.

HONORING DR. JERRY K. 
DOMATOB 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Writer’s 
Guild Founder, Dr. Jerry K. Domatob. 
Dr. Jerry Komia Domatob is Professor of 
Mass Communication at Alcorn State Univer-
sity, in Lorman, Mississippi. An author, pho-
tographer, and poet, Domatob earned his 
Ph.D. in Mass Communication from Ohio Uni-
versity, in Athens, Ohio. He holds two mas-
ter’s degrees in international Affairs and Jour-
nalism from Carleton University, in Ottawa, 
Canada. Dr. Domatob also studied law and 
Journalism at the University of Yaounde´. He 
has taught in several universities including the 
University of Northern Iowa, Fordham Univer-
sity, New York and Rutgers University, New 
Brunswick, Jackson State University, Suffolk 
County Community College and Brentwood 
Community College. With broad expertise in 
media education, Dr. Domatob brings varied 
pedagogical experiences in communication 
and related fields. 
Dr. Domatob is also known as one of the 
founders of the Claiborne County Writer’s 
Guild, a small but passionate group of writers 
who actively promote the literacy arts in the 
community. This group is known for encour-
aging students with scholarships to critiquing 
each other’s work, to just good fellowship and 
enlightenment. They are all about inspiring 
new talent to grow and new works to come 
forth. 
Dr. Domatob is also known for his impact 
and influence in the community. He is known 
to be a creative, soft spoken, a humble man 
who 
stimulates 
positivity 
and 
influential 
thought patterns. He currently serves as the 
Vice President for the Harriette Person Memo-
rial Library Friends of the Library. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring a community leader and 
founder, Dr. Jerry Komia Domatob for his 
dedication and tenacity to serving his commu-
nity and desire to be an example for all.

BIDEN CRAZY ENERGY AGENDA 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, it was extraordinary that House Re-
publican STEVE SCALISE (R–LA) joined Fox 
News Channel’s Sunday Night in America with 
Trey Gowdy to discuss how the Democrats’ 
far-left energy policies are hurting families and 
workers. Whip SCALISE pointed out that the 
Biden Administration’s out-of-control spending 
and radical climate agenda has raised the 
price of gas, electricity, and groceries for mid-
dle class families. In addition, Whip SCALISE 
called out President Biden for canceling the 
Keystone pipeline and begging OPEC and 
Russia to increase oil production instead of 
finding ways to promote American energy 
independence and create jobs in the United 
States. 
Whip SCALISE accurately evaluated that ‘‘ul-
timately, it’s the Biden Administration that’s 
created so many of these supply chain prob-
lems starting with the lack of affordable Amer-
ican energy. It’s one of the reasons people are 
paying 40 percent more for gasoline at the 
pump. It’s one of the reasons that prices at 
the grocery store are dramatically higher. It’s 
because of the policies where they said that 
they’re not against all energy, they’re just 
against American energy.’’ 
He reviewed correctly history, ‘‘You know, 
when President Biden walked in the door, we 
were energy independent. We run not only 
making enough for America’s needs. We were 
exporting to our friends around the world. And 
so countries that are allies of America could 
get their energy from us. That’s changing. 
Now, they’ve got to get it from enemies like 
Russia. Any by the way, Trey, it’s the low-in-
come families that pay the biggest price for 
the [spike in] inflation that we’re seeing right 
now.’’ 
Whip SCALISE concluded, You know, it’s this 
kind of elitist Washington attitude that [says], 
‘‘Don’t worry. You’ve got a great career mak-
ing over $100,000 a year producing American 
energy in South Louisiana. But, you can go 
and install solar panels. Which, by the way, 
you’re probably going to be making 40 percent 
less.’’ And go look at what they did with 
Solyndra. A lot of those solar panels are made 
in China. When the [Obama] Administration— 
back when he was Vice President—gave $500 
million of taxpayer money to Solyndra, the 
company went bankrupt in just a few months 
and the taxpayers lost all that money. In this 
package of bills, they have over $100 billion 
dollars in Solyndra-style slush funds to give 
out money to their friends while crushing the 
jobs of those hard-working families in South 
Louisiana. 
Our country is fortunate to have Trey 
Gowdy hosting Sunday Night. Former Con-
gressman Gowdy has an extraordinary pros-
ecutorial ability which he perfected serving as 
a Solicitor (District Attorney) in South Carolina. 
His talent for extracting the truth from wit-
nesses in plain English is invaluable in our 
current era of doublespeak.

Under current law, international air pas-
sengers arriving in the United States who 
have subsequent transfer flights generally 
must be screened at an airport security 
checkpoint before boarding the transfer 
flight. H.R. 4094 would authorize the Trans-
portation Security Administration (TSA), in 
coordination with U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, to conduct a pilot program that 
would allow passengers and baggage arriving 
from certain foreign airports to bypass that 
security screening, under conditions speci-
fied in the act. TSA could conduct the pilot 
program under agreements with up to six 
foreign airports and the program would ter-
minate six years after enactment. H.R. 4094 
would require TSA to brief the Congress be-
fore each agreement takes effect and report 
within five years of enactment on how the 
program was implemented. 
Using information from TSA on the cost of 
similar programs, CBO estimates that imple-
menting the act would cost $1 million over 
the 2022–2026 period; any spending would be 
subject to the availability of appropriated 
funds. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
Aaron Krupkin. The estimate was reviewed 
by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of 
Budget Analysis.

VETERAN 
COM-
MENDATION 
FOR 
LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL JOHN E. BYRNE, JR. 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I’m honored to present Lieutenant Colonel 
John E. Byrne, Jr., U.S. Army, Retired with a 
Congressional Veteran Commendation. It is a 
privilege to salute an exemplary soldier and 
citizen for his lifetime of service. 
In his nearly three decades of military serv-
ice, LTC Byrne served across the globe, in-
cluding overseas during the Vietnam War. 
Throughout his years of duty, he deservedly 
received numerous military honors. Among 
these are the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star 
Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, and the Vi-
etnamese Armed Forces Honor Medal. His 
fearless support of our country’s interests 
serves as a clear testament to his dedication 
to our great nation and to his commitment to 
serving others regardless of their nationality or 
origins. 
LTC Byrne closed out 27 years of military 
service in 1996. Since then, he has become 
an avid volunteer. He has exemplified great al-
truism in lifting up his community, from donat-
ing more than 100 units of blood, to serving as 
a 4th Degree Knight of Columbus, to donating 
a kidney to a friend. He also remains active 
within St. John Vianney Catholic Church and 
selflessly spent eight years on its Finance 
Committee. One of his most admirable acts of 
service is his role as a Victim Service Advo-
cate where he provides comfort to victims of 
tragedy and death. As he did during his mili-
tary service, he has worked tirelessly to put 
others first. 
I commend LTC Byrne’s selfless service to 
his community and nation. His patriotism, citi-
zenship, and commitment to excellence are 
among of his many commendable qualities 
that make him so deserving of this award. I 
join his friends and family in celebrating his 
outstanding achievements, and I thank him for 
his service.

HONORING TRINITY MCGLOSTER 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious young lady, Ms. Trinity McGloster. 
Trinity has shown what can be done through 
hard work, dedication, and a desire to 
achieve. 
Trinity McGloster, a Vicksburg High School 
Student, who made her debut as the kicker for 
the Gator football team Friday (September 10, 
2021) night against Canton in the team’s first 
district game. 
It’s not everyday that a young lady decides 
to play the game of football, but the freshman 
soccer athlete is prepared to show that she 
has what it takes to shine against anyone. 
‘‘I’ve been playing soccer since I was four, 
so my coaches, parents, and teammates have 
been preparing for this moment and I thought 
it would be a great opportunity for me to try 
something new,’’ McGloster said. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Trinity McGloster for 
her passion and desire to be a trailblazer.

HONORING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE 
CUTLER-PLOTKIN 
JEWISH 
HERITAGE CENTER 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate a significant milestone that 
will be reached in my district on Saturday, Oc-
tober 30: the 100th anniversary of the con-
struction of the Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage 
Center. It was the first synagogue built in the 
city of Phoenix and this historic place has 
deeply enriched our community for a century. 
In the spring of 1920, a group of 32 resi-
dents joined together to form Phoenix’s first 
Jewish 
congregation, 
Congregation 
Beth 
Israel. The next year, on October 30, 1921, 
they broke ground and began to the lay the 
cornerstone for a place of worship, Temple 
Beth Israel. 
Madam Speaker, the early days for this con-
gregation were not easy, particularly when you 
consider they had no air conditioning during 
the sweltering heat of an Arizona summer. But 
these individuals were united by their deep- 
rooted faith and unwavering commitment to 
the values of Judaism. 
Temple Beth Israel was a place of worship, 
but it was also a place where members of our 
community came together to celebrate culture, 
faith and education. It hosted meetings with 
members of the B’nai B’rith and the National 
Council of Jewish Women, and frequently held 
Passover Seders and special dances. 
In 1949, Congregation Beth Israel sold the 
property to the Southern Baptist Convention 
and the building became home to Phoenix’s 
first Chinese-speaking Christian Church. In 
1981, the property was sold again, this time to 
a Spanish-speaking Baptist Church. It re-
mained under their care until purchased by the 
Jewish Historical Society in 2002, upon which 
time it was bestowed its present-day name: 
the Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center. 
Today, the building serves as an important 
religious and cultural archive, housing more 
than 50,000 artifacts of Jewish history in Ari-
zona and the Southwest United States. It also 
continues to host forums and educational 
events, and remains a regional nexus of the 
Jewish faith. 
I am proud to recognize the Cutler-Plotkin 
Jewish Heritage Center’s extraordinary accom-
plishment and ask that my colleagues join me 
in expressing deep gratitude to the many indi-
viduals who have called this building home, in-
cluding the late Rabbi Albert Plotkin and the 
Arizona Jewish Historical Society’s Executive 
Director Lawrence Bell, Treasurer Lawrence 
Cutler, and Founder Jerry Lewkowitz. Mr. 
Lewkowitz’s parents were original leaders of 
Congregation Beth Israel and fifth generation 
family members will be celebrating at this 
year’s centennial. 
The leadership of these individuals and so 
many others will ensure the Cutler-Plotkin 
Jewish Heritage Center remains a positive in-
fluence in our community for years to come. 
Collectively, they helped make Phoenix the 
culturally rich and diverse place that it is 
today. Best wishes for the next 100 years.

October 12, 2021 
He passed away on October 3rd of this year 
at the age of 54. Judge Gargiulo was the 
youngest of six children, and was raised on 
the Mississippi Gulf Coast. 
Judge Gargiulo was a decorated veteran 
who served in the Active Duty Army, the Mis-
sissippi Army National Guard, and the Mis-
sissippi Air National Guard. He deployed in 
support of Operations Desert Shield and 
Desert Storm. After serving twenty-seven 
years as a commissioned officer, Judge 
Gargiulo retired holding the rank of Colonel. 
After serving on Active Duty, Judge Gargiulo 
received his Juris Doctorate from the Univer-
sity of Mississippi School of Law. 
In 2000, he was appointed as an Assistant 
District Attorney. He served as counsel in over 
fifty jury trials including three capital-offense 
prosecutions. He prosecuted two of America’s 
Most Wanted criminals, resulting in guilty ver-
dicts. He was awarded the Community Service 
Award by the Gulf Coast Crime Victim’s Rights 
Coalition in 2005. 
In 2009, the Governor of the State of Mis-
sissippi appointed Judge Gargiulo as Circuit 
Court Judge. In August of 2014, after a rig-
orous screening of candidates by a merit se-
lection panel comprised of lawyers and other 
citizens, Judge Gargiulo was appointed by the 
District Court to serve as a United States 
Magistrate Judge for the Southern District of 
Mississippi. He served on the bench for more 
than seven years, before his untimely passing. 
On behalf of the 4th Congressional District 
of Mississippi, we honor the memory of Judge 
Gargiulo—a loving father, brother, son, patriot, 
and dedicated public servant. I send my heart-
felt condolences to his friends, his three chil-
dren (Andrew, Jordan, and Katherine), his 
fiance´e (Stephanie Ingram), and his brothers 
and sister.

HONORING RETIRED COL. VICTOR 
‘‘VIC’’ FERNANDEZ 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a friend, patriot, and man of 
great 
faith, 
Retired 
Col. 
Victor 
‘‘Vic’’ 
Fernandez. A 30-year Army veteran, Vic 
served his country valiantly and led the effort 
to establish the Pikes Peak National Cemetery 
in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
A Colorado native, Vic grew up in Trinidad 
with a longstanding family tradition of military 
service. His great grandfather fought in the 
Civil War, his father in World War II, and his 
uncle was captured at the battle of Corregidor 
in World War II and later survived the Bataan 
Death March. Vic followed this tradition of 
service to his country and graduated from 
West Point in 1959 with a degree in mechan-
ical engineering. Vic’s 30-year career included 
two Panama tours, two Germany tours, and 
multiple stateside postings in addition to his 
time in the Vietnam War. 
Vic served two tours in Vietnam, and upon 
his return, was disheartened at the poor re-
ception he and other soldiers received. Be-
cause of this experience, Vic dedicated his re-
tirement to ensuring that soldiers serving in 
Iraq and Afghanistan did not share the same 
experience. He and his wife Sherry, spent 
many late nights at airports and military bases, 
often waiting until 2 a.m., to greet returning 
troops with a warm handshake, a cheese-
burger with fries, a welcoming smile, and pray-
er. 
Additionally, Vic served as president of the 
Pikes Peak Chapter of the Military Officers As-
sociation of America. He was also a founding 
member of the Board of Home Front Cares 
and the Southeast Family Center and Armed 
Services YMCA. 
In 1999, Vic became the chairman of the 
Pikes Peak Veterans Cemetery Committee. 
He advocated for a National Veterans Ceme-
tery in the Pikes Peak region. Vic wanted a 
place that would serve the veterans of South-
ern Colorado for generations to follow. In 
2006, he, and the other founding members of 
the cemetery board, Ralph McCutchen and 
Joe Henjum approached me with their vision. 
On my second day in office in January 2007, 
I introduced H.R. 295, which directed the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to establish a na-
tional cemetery for veterans in the Pikes Peak 
region. 
In May of 2008, I conducted a field hearing 
in Colorado Springs to address The National 
Cemetery Administration’s longstanding 75- 
mile rule. A typical spring day in Colorado, VA 
Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs William 
F. Tuerk and other distinguished guests trav-
eling to the hearing were greeted with sunny 
weather in Denver upon arrival. By the time 
they drove through Castle Rock, snowflakes 
were falling. The field hearing started over an 
hour late, because of poor road conditions, 
due to a white-out blizzard on Monument Hill. 
Vic and everyone involved in the hearing 
could only attribute the storm to divine inter-
vention. 
During the hearing, Vic offered passionate 
testimony and argued that ‘these geographic 
and weather pattern hindrances make the Vet-
erans Administration internal 75-mile rule a 
useless tool in the state of Colorado. The 
combination of the geography, weather pat-
terns and a foolish regulation serves only to 
assure that the Veterans and their families in 
the Pikes Peak Region and southern Colorado 
are not properly nor fairly served by Fort 
Logan.’ 
Because of providential weather conditions 
and the testimony of Vic, and others, Under 
Secretary Tuerk decided it was appropriate to 
break the VA’s longstanding, 75-mile rule and 
establish a national cemetery in Southern Col-
orado. 
Years later, after legislation for the cemetery 
was signed into law, Vic told a reporter, ‘I 
think God is keeping me alive so I can be bur-
ied there.’ Vic had dedicated over 20 years 
passionately 
advocating 
for 
this 
national 
monument. In 2018, the Pikes Peak National 
Cemetery opened, with the capacity for 
197,000 veterans to be interred. Because of 
his vision, the Pikes Peak National Cemetery 
will serve as a permanent monument and final 
resting place for generations of our nation’s 
heroes. 
In addition to his deep-rooted patriotism, Vic 
was a man of dedicated spiritual conviction. A 
longtime parishioner at St. Francis of Assisi in 
Colorado Springs, he served as a Grand 
Knight in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic 
men’s chapter that he helped to establish. 
Vic was a giant amongst men and lived his 
life tenaciously in service to his Creator, his 
nation, his family, and his community. His life-
time of service has left a permanent impact on 
the Pikes Peak region. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in Congress join me in honoring this man of 
great faith, passion, and patriotism, my friend, 
U.S. 
Army 
Retired

HONORING DONALD BAKER 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Clintwood, Virginia’s mayor, Donald 
Baker, who died on October 7, 2021, at the 
age of 83. Mr. Baker was a dedicated and 
longtime public servant. 
Mr. Baker served the town of Clintwood for 
over three decades. He was first elected to 
the town’s council in 1980 and served as the 
mayor since 1988. He was spoken very highly 
of by his colleagues for his enduring gen-
erosity to the community. He was a great rep-
resentative for the citizens of Clintwood. He 
was attentive to the community’s concerns 
and addressed them with compassion and in-
tegrity. 
During his time in service, he worked dili-
gently to build coalitions to obtain grants and 
funding for community improvement projects. 
He was well known for governing by conserv-
ative financial values. During his 41 years of 
service, he kept the provision of affordable 
goods and services as a top priority for him. 
He was esteemed by colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle. Mr. Baker was known as a friend 
to many and held a strong voice in the region. 
Outside of his work in the public service, he 
worked and operated in the coal industry for 
many years. He also served as a Bank Direc-
tor at several banks in the region up until his 
retirement. And he was a member of the Army 
Reserve Forces serving at rank of Sergeant. 
Even in his free time, Mr. Baker still dedi-
cated his time to helping others. For over 60 
years he volunteered at every level of Little 
League baseball and softball. He tirelessly 
worked with school leaders and coaches to 
support Clintwood athletics and their children. 
Mayor Baker was preceded in death by his 
wife, Martha Ann Anderson; his parents, 
James Garfield Baker and Nell Arrington 
Baker; and his brothers, Harold Baker, Carl 
Baker, and Marvin Baker. 
He is survived by his two sons, Greg Baker 
and his wife Lora, and Mike Baker; his grand-
daughter, Emily Ann Baker Dressner; grand-
son Thomas Gregory Baker; and one great- 
grandson, John Mark Dressner. I offer my 
condolences on the loss of this good man and 
great leader.

October 12, 2021 
Ken Cates, U.S. Army and U.S. Coast Guard, 
Retired with a Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation. His service and devotion to the 
military, his nation, and his community speak 
to the best of our Texas’ altruistic spirit. 
Heeding the call to serve, SFC Cates en-
tered the military in 1988. During this time, he 
completed many heroic missions which in-
cluded over 120 emergency combat re-
sponses as Operations Center Manager, 150 
coordinated executive leader engagement mis-
sions, and 15 natural disaster responses. 
Throughout his military career, he applied his 
tremendous talents and energies to the de-
fense of our great nation. 
SFC Cates closed out twenty-seven years 
of military service in 2015. While many would 
embrace a life of retirement, he still displays 
his loyal and selfless nature by providing aid 
to Veterans in the Fort Hood Area. SFC Cates 
currently works for the Fort Hood Area Habitat 
for Humanity and is working to support a vet-
erans housing establishment in his area. His 
commitment to investing his gifts, talents, and 
abilities to improve his community has not 
gone unnoticed. In 2019, Cates was named a 
‘‘Hometown Hero’’ by the Harker Heights 
Chamber of Commerce and the 2019 NEXEN 
Hero. 
I proudly join SFC Ken Cates’ friends, fam-
ily, and colleagues in saluting his selfless 
service to the military and his beloved Texas 
home. His work brings to life Gandhi’s words. 
that ‘‘The best way to find yourself is to lose 
yourself in the service of others.’’ I congratu-
late SFC Ken Cates and than him for his serv-
ice.

HONORING TYRE PHILLIPS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community servant Mr. Tyre Phillips. 
Tyre Phillips was born in Grenada, Mis-
sissippi, which is known as the city that 
smiles, in January of 1997. Tyre is the son of 
James and Jusqulynn Phillips of Grenada, 
MS. He is also a member of Open Door Abun-
dant Life Church of Apostolic Faith in Charles-
ton, MS, where his father is the pastor. 
Phillips received his high school diploma in 
2015. After graduation, he went to East Mis-
sissippi 
Community 
College 
(EMCC) 
in 
Scooba, MS, where he gained a full ride 
scholarship in football. Phillips started both 
years at EMCC. After the two years, he grad-
uated from EMCC and received a full ride 
scholarship to go play football at Mississippi 
State University. 
January 2017, Phillips began going to Mis-
sissippi State. His first season there he was 
redshirted, which later down the road he 
called ‘‘the best thing I ever could have done.’’ 
During his junior year, he played at both tackle 
positions as part of an offensive line rotation. 
During his senior year, he started all 13 
games the Bulldogs played in. Phillips played 
in the 2020 Senior Bowl after his senior sea-
son. During his time at Mississippi State Uni-
versity, he became a member of Omega Psi 
Phi Incorporated and he received SEC honors. 
Phillips then graduated from Mississippi State 
University with his Bachelor of Science De-
gree in Human Science with Child Youth De-
velopment. 
After graduation, Phillips then started train-
ing for the NFL combine. He was soon drafted 
by the Baltimore Ravens in the third round 
with the 106th overall pick of the 2020 NFL 
Draft. During training camp, he shifted from 
tackle to offensive guard for the starting job at 
the start of the season despite dealing with an 
ankle injury. Phillips started 8 games and 
played 12 games overall his rookie year as a 
Raven. Phillips is now entering his second 
year as a Raven and he is now battling for a 
starting position for this upcoming season. 
During the off season, Phillips offers music 
lessons to children in the community. He also 
assists in local football camps for aspiring ath-
letic youth. Next year, Phillips will be starting 
his own camp, investing in young men in his 
community, as many from the city of Grenada 
did for him. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Tyre Phillips for his 
dedication and tenacity to serving his commu-
nity and desire to be an example for all.

IN CELEBRATION OF HENRY 
THACKER ‘‘HARRY’’ BURLEIGH 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
contributions 
of 
Henry 
Thacker 
‘‘Harry’’ 
Burleigh of the great state of New York. The 
newly christened Harry T. Burleigh Place in 
Gramercy Park celebrates a man who dedi-
cated his life to enhancing lives through music 
singing, composing and social justice. This 
well-deserving recognition honors the indelible 
impact Mr. Burleigh, known widely as the Fa-
ther of Spiritual Music, left on New York and 
communities around the world. 
Born in 1866 and growing up in Erie, Penn-
sylvania as a young African-American baritone 
singer, Harry Burleigh traveled to New York 
City and applied to the National Conservatory 
of Music to study with well-known Director and 
composer, Antonin Dvorak. His exceptional 
talent was recognized, and a scholarship 
awarded to Mr. Burleigh in 1892 enabled him 
to gain experience editing recordings and de-
veloping his classical spirituals. One of these 
was ‘‘Deep River’’ a spiritual composition from 
1917 which is recognized all over the world to 
this day. 
Tragically, Mr. Burleigh’s life was spent 
under the heinous abuses of Jim Crow, and 
the systemic discrimination of ‘‘separate but 
equal’’ endemic to it. Yet in the face of these 
challenges to his rights and liberties, Mr. 
Burleigh always led with his talents and tire-
less work ethic, earning him many glowing ac-
complishments throughout his life. In 1894, 
Mr. Burleigh auditioned at St. George’s Epis-
copal Church at 4 Rutherford Place in Manhat-
tan, which still stands proudly today within my 
district 
and 
holds 
concerts 
celebrating 
Burleigh’s 
compositions 
annually. 
Church 
member 
J.P. 
Morgan 
insisted 
that 
St. 
George’s hire Mr. Burleigh, and so became 
the church’s Choral Director. He would con-
tinue to introduce and play his classical spir-
itual music there for 52 years. Concurrently he 
integrated Temple Emanu-El, now Congrega-
tion Emanu-El, for a quarter of a century. In 
1895, Mr. Burleigh made it a point to person-
ally test the strength of newly passed civil 
rights laws in New York by asking for service 
at 25 establishments. 
From 1908 onward, he sang for King Ed-
ward VII in London, performed on Mayor La 
Guardia’s weekly radio show Talk to the Peo-
ple, and composed over 200 pieces encom-
passing the classical spiritual music genre. 
The renowned Dvorak’ Symphony No. 9 (From 
the New World) credits the incorporation and 
soulfulness of Burleigh’s spiritual works. Mr. 
Burleigh was also a distinguished chartered 
member of the American Society of Com-
posers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) be-
stowed with great public honors. He received 
the 1917 N.A.A.C.P. Spingarn Achievement 
Medal, and honorary Doctorate of Music from 
Howard University and Atlanta University in 
1920. In addition, Mr. Burleigh mentored Paul 
Robeson, Marian Anderson, Roland Hayes 
and Enrico Caruso who would go on to make 
their own exciting contributions to our nation’s 
musical story. 
Mr. Burleigh’s legacy of social justice lives 
on through The Harry T. Burleigh Society. 
Formed 
in 
2017, 
the 
society 
continues 
Burleigh’s 
important 
legacy 
of 
disrupting 
boundaries and challenging social norms to 
address issues of our time. The Center for 
Peace, Equity & Justice at Friends Seminary 
School in New York City, coordinated an edu-
cation/postcard campaign that was sent to 
Community Board Six in Manhattan, further 
highlighting his importance in American social 
justice to our beloved city. 
The co-naming on September 12, 2021 at 
the South East comer of 16th Street and Third 
Avenue, Harry T. Burleigh Place, stands now 
as a testament to his important work as a bari-
tone soloist, choral director, music arranger, 
editor, mentor, and a New York Community 
leader. 
Harry Burleigh contributed so much to New 
York and the world, adding his sonorous and 
unique brand of spiritual signing to our ever- 
growing chorus of American culture. I am 
pleased to add my own voice to that chorus 
today in recognition and remembrance of this 
great man.

HONORING 
THE 
75TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BUFFALO MED-
ICAL GROUP 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Buffalo Medical 
Group on its 75th anniversary. 
In 1946, Drs. Ramsdell Gurney, Murray S. 
Howland, Jr., George F. Koepf, and Frank 
Meyers came together to form the Buffalo 
Medical Group. At its founding, the Buffalo 
Medical Group was one of the first group phy-
sician practices in Western New York. Today, 
the Buffalo Medical Group continues to deliver 
high-quality patient care, and I am honored to 
represent it in Congress. 
The founding physicians of the Buffalo Med-
ical Group served in World War II, where they 
were exposed to the group practice model. 
Unlike the solo practice model, which was the 
norm at the time, the group practice model al-
lows for greater shared clinical experience and 
access to information. It also broadens the 
scope of a practice, enables a group to pro-
vide care to more patients, and allows physi-
cians to practice medicine more effectively. 
Given these benefits, a year after the war, 
these doctors brought the group practice 
model to their community, establishing the 
Buffalo Medical Group. By 1963, the practice 
consisted of ten physicians and had wide-
spread name recognition throughout Western 
New York. Several years later, to accommo-
date the growing practice and its new patients, 
the group constructed its own office building at 
85 High Street, which still functions as a Buf-
falo Medical Group office today. Buffalo Med-
ical Group’s continued success led to the con-
struction 
of 
additional 
major 
offices 
in 
Williamsville, NY in 1986 and in Orchard Park, 
NY in 1999. 
After 75 years, the Buffalo Medical Group 
has grown into one of the largest multi-spe-
cialty physician practice groups in New York 
State. Today, the group has 135 physicians, 
115 advanced practice professionals, 725 em-
ployees, and 34 surgical and medical depart-
ments that occupy four main offices and seven 
satellite offices throughout Western New York. 
The Buffalo Medical Group records more than 
850,000 outpatient visits annually and con-
tinues to maintain a strong and positive pres-
ence in Western New York. 
The Buffalo Medical Group has employed 
exceptional physicians, including Dr. Richard 
Cooper, who developed the ‘‘Cooper regimen’’ 
of chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer, 
and Dr. Scott Tu Iman, who performed the first 
laparoscopic splenectomy in North America. 
More recently, in October 2021, Dr. John 
Notaro of Buffalo Medical Group was honored 
nationwide as a ‘‘Best Physician’’ during Na-
tional Primary Care Week. 
The group is also admired for its early adop-
tion of innovative medical technologies and 
software. Over a decade before Congress cre-
ated federal subsidies to incentivize the use of 
electronic health record systems, the Buffalo 
Medical Group implemented its own electronic 
health record system. This early investment 
created long-term benefits for both the prac-
tice and patients alike. 
I thank all the doctors and employees of the 
Buffalo Medical Group for their unwavering 
commitment to wellness and patient care, and 
I again congratulate the group on its 75th an-
niversary.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ETHEL 
FRAN EDDY 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the life of Ethel Fran Eddy, a Holocaust 
survivor, who passed away on Saturday, Au-
gust 28, 2021 at the age of 82 years old. 
Ethel was less than a year old when World 
War II began. She and her family were forced 
to flee Govorovo, Poland to escape the Nazis. 
They fled to Siberia for the remainder of the 
war. Two of her brothers were tragically killed 
by the Nazis while studying at Yeshiva. 
Once the war ended, Ethel and her family 
managed to make it to Paris, where her moth-
er tragically passed. After being denied entry 
into Israel by the British, they eventually came 
to the United States through Brooklyn, New 
York. 
Ethel dreamed of becoming a Rockette and 
living the American Dream. She and her first 
husband had three children and resettled in 
the South Jersey area. She later married 
George H. Eddy. 
She later graduated from Temple University 
with a degree in Business. She taught Hebrew 
school and worked as a saleswoman for her 
husband’s stationery supply company, selling 
to college bookstores. Later, following her re-
tirement, Ethel moved to Del Ray Beach, Flor-
ida. 
She is survived by her children Laura Gold-
man, Jeffrey Goldman, Kevin Broadie, Barry 
Goldman and Jean Goldman, as well as her 
grandchildren, Theodore and Benson Gold-
man, and Zoe, Lucas and Dylan Broadie Gold-
man. 
I ask that my colleagues in the House take 
this opportunity to celebrate Ethel’s life and 
legacy, and I offer my best wishes to her fam-
ily during this difficult time.

MENDATION FOR CAPTAIN RICH-
ARD J. ARCHER 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS

Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
am honored to present Captain Richard J. Ar-
cher, U.S. Army with a Congressional Veteran 
Commendation. His service and devotion to 
the Army, his nation, and his community 
speak to why CPT Archer is an ideal recipient 
of the Congressional Veteran Commendation. 
Fulfilling the call to serve, CPT Archer first 
began his service in 1966 after graduating and 
commissioning from Central Michigan Univer-
sity’s ROTC program. He continued to com-
mand ‘‘C’’ Company during his assignment at 
the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood and 
later served with the 13th Corps Support Com-
mand before being honorably discharged from 
the Army. 
CPT Archer closed out nine years of military 
service in 1975, and since then he has distin-
guished himself as a valuable community 
member in Temple, TX. While many would 
choose to take time for themselves, CPT Ar-
cher continues to employ his talents to his 
community. His public service and devotion to 
others include, but are not limited to, his in-
volvement with the Marine Corps Junior ROTC 
program at Belton High School, his member-
ship with the 13th COSCOM Association, his 
representation on the Veteran’s Land Board 
for 21 counties, and the aid he provided by 
establishing various associations and groups 
like Emeritus Medicus. His allegiance to in-
vesting his talents and abilities to help better 
his community and nation represents the best 
of Texas values. 
I proudly join CPT Richard J. Archers’ 
friends, family, and colleagues in saluting his 
selfless service to the Army and Central 
Texas. His life and career reflect hard work 
and dedication to what is best for his fellow 
man.

burn, New Hampshire.

1904 to recognize and support everyday civil-
ians who risk their own lives to save others in 
extraordinary acts of courage. Carnegie was 
inspired to create the Fund after a January

those who died in the accident were an engi-
neer and miner who selflessly rushed into the 
mine in the midst of the disaster in an effort 
to rescue others. 
More than 100 years later, Alan Cote and 
Stephen Carkhuff perfectly encapsulate this 
spirit of impulsive heroism. After hearing the 
late-night crash, Cohen and Carkhuff raced to-
ward the already burning vehicle without con-
cern for their own safety and assisted in re-
moving both unconscious passengers from the 
car. Their quick response helped ensure the 
safety of both passengers, both of whom sur-
vived. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank and congratulate these selfless and cou-
rageous men. Let their courage and heroism 
serve as an example for us all.

comradery for Milford area veterans. A veteran 
of the United States Army Air Force, Travis 
Kitchen served with honor during World War 
II, earning the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, 
World War II Victory Medal, and the Bronze 
Star. He lost an eye at Iwo Jima and though, 
like so many other veterans, he never really 
spoke of his time in the service, when he re-
turned home he was determined to help his 
brothers in arms. Travis Kitchen was a driving 
force in the building the hall and was one of 
its most dedicated members. Even well into 
his 80’s, he could often be found fixing things 
around the hall. 
All of our nation’s veterans deserve our 
gratitude. They fought to protect the freedom 
and democracy that underlie all that we do. It 
is easy to take our fundamental freedoms for 
granted, but we must never forget that the lib-
erties we enjoy were hard-won and not com-
monplace in the world. My father was a vet-
eran, and his memory always reminds me of 
the debt owed to the men and women who 
have served our country. Upon their return 
from service, many of our soldiers faced chal-
lenges re-entering the workforce, accessing 
the benefits they were entitled to, and ensur-
ing that their needs were addressed by the 
government. 
Just as in other VFW Posts across our na-
tion, the VFW Post 778 and their members 
continue to ensure that those who have 
served in America’s armed forces receive the 
benefits and support they so richly deserve. In 
addition, they bring so much more to our com-
munity through the variety of civic service their 
members participate in on our behalf. In es-
tablishing Post 778 and working so diligently, 
their membership has made all the difference 
in the lives of many. It has become an invalu-
able resource to veterans in the community. 
Perhaps more importantly, VFW Posts 
brought together those who shared a common 
bond—those who gave so much of them-
selves to protect and defend our great nation. 
Today, as they celebrate their 75th anniver-
sary, the Travis Kitchen Post 778 can be 
proud of all of the good work they have done. 
It is my honor to stand today to extend my 
deepest thanks and appreciation to the leader-
ship and members, past and present who 
have ensured VFW Post 778 has and con-
tinues to serve our community as well as my 
heartfelt congratulations on this very special 
milestone. As we say in Italian ‘‘C’ent Anni,’’ to 
another hundred years.

HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS 
H. BIRDSONG III 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of the life of Thomas H. Birdsong III, a 
dear and devoted husband, father, grandfather 
and great-grandfather—as well as an accom-
plished native son of the Commonwealth of 
Virginia—whom we lost on August 20, 2021, 
at the age of 94. 
Born and raised in Suffolk, Virginia, Mr. 
Birdsong was a member of America’s Greatest 
Generation—an only child who heard and 
heeded the call to serve from an early age, 
joining the United States Navy during World 
War II. It was a call he would continue to an-
swer following the war, a committed servant of 
both his country and his Commonwealth 
throughout his life. 
A 1949 graduate of Randolph-Macon Col-
lege in Ashland, Virginia—and a recipient of 
numerous accolades from the College in the 
decades since, including an Honorary Doctor 
of Law degree—Mr. Birdsong would go on to 
serve two terms on the College’s distinguished 
Board of Trustees, including a term as vice 
chairman. In addition to funding a variety of 
improvements to the campus itself, Mr. 
Birdsong’s generosity made it possible for sev-
eral students to attend the College and there-
after call it their own. Further still, Mr. 
Birdsong has helped ensure the College’s fu-
ture through his establishment of a charitable 
unitrust that has become part of the College’s 
endowment. 
Mr. Birdsong’s philanthropy stemmed from 
his great professional success, rooted quite lit-
erally in his beloved home state. Over the 
course of a successful, 72-year career with 
Suffolk-based Birdsong Peanuts, Mr. Birdsong 
was inducted into the Peanut Hall of Fame by 
the American Peanut Council in 2000 for his 
‘‘Outstanding Contributions’’ to the peanut in-
dustry. He was continuing to serve as the 
company’s chairman upon his death. As a 
businessman, Mr. Birdsong was a noted con-
servationist, patron of the arts, and a trusted 
and well-regarded corporate leader, whose 
many contributions to American commerce in-
cluded time spent on the Advisory Council for 
the United States Secretary of Agriculture. 
Please join me in honoring the life of Thom-
as H. Birdsong Ill, a Virginian whose legacy of 
servant leadership lives on in the hearts of all 
of us grateful for the noble and timeless exam-
ple he set.

GEANT GENE DAVENPORT 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the service of First Ser-
geant Gene Davenport, U.S. Army, Retired, 
and recognize him for the Congressional Vet-
eran Commendation. His resume tells the 
story of one unafraid to do whatever it takes 
to support his fellow man. 
1SG Davenport dedicated 20 years of his 
life to defending our country, which included 
two tours in Vietnam. In recognition of these 
unselfish efforts throughout his career, he re-
ceived numerous military honors, including a 
Bronze Star, a Vietnamese Gallantry Cross 
with Palm, 5 Army Commendation Medal, and 
6 Good Conduct Medals. His support of our 
country’s interests abroad serves as a clear 
testament to his dedication to our great nation. 
1SG Davenport has been a stellar and com-
mitted volunteer in every one of his commu-
nities following his active-duty service. He’s 
given his considerable talents and energies to 
a broad array of organizations and causes, 
ranging from officiating high school football 
games, volunteering at local hospitals, and 
mentoring tomorrow’s leaders, to supporting 
his fellow warriors in the Marine Corps League 
and the Leander VFW Post 10427 where he’s 
worked tirelessly to support veterans in need. 
I join 1SG Davenport’s friends and family in 
celebrating his selfless service to both his 
community and nation. He is a worthy recipi-
ent of a Congressional Veteran Commenda-
tion.

HON. JOHN JOYCE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize Penn-Mont Academy in 
Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, as they celebrate 
their 60th year providing a Montessori edu-
cation to the students of our community. 
Penn-Mont Academy was founded in 1961 
by Aline and Gerald Wolf, who founded the 
school in their home with a vision to create 
one of the first Montessori institutions in the 
United States. 
Over the past 60 years, the school has 
worked to provide a creative and insightful 
education that molds independent and lifelong 
learners.

This school is important to my family and 
me; my wife, Dr. Alice Plummer Joyce, was 
one of school’s first graduates. 
I am incredibly grateful for the outstanding 
work that Penn-Mont Academy does in our 
community. From the Wolf’s front porch to 
their current home in Hollidaysburg, the Penn- 
Mont Academy has offered generations of stu-
dents the foundation they need to succeed. 
The school’s commitment to educating the 
children of Blair County is exceptional, and I 
look forward to their continued work to support 
and inspire our future leaders. 
On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania’s 
13th Congressional District, I congratulate the 
students, staff, and administration of Penn- 
Mont Academy on reaching this historic mile-
stone and wish them every continued success 
in the years to come.

HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that the House of Rep-
resentatives join me in honoring the life of 
Mark Miller, who passed away on Friday, Sep-
tember 24, 2021. He will be remembered as a 
leader and activist for public education. 
For decades, Mark has been a great force 
for positive change in the Philadelphia region. 
Most notably, through his vigorous advocacy 
for students, teachers, and public schools. He 
has inspired many to fight for quality, equitable 
and free education. 
He served on the Centennial School District 
School Board and was a Pennsylvania School 
Boards Association leader. Outside of his work 
on public education, he was also the commis-
sioner and official for the Pennsylvania Inter-
scholastic Athletic Association, overseeing 
programs in soccer, basketball, and softball. 
He was a leader in our community and will 
be greatly missed. I ask that all of my col-
leagues in the House join me in celebrating 
Mark’s life, as well as his legacy of public and 
community service.

UNDERSTANDABLE MATH 
REVEALS CRISIS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I was grateful to receive from the ap-
preciated historian Greg Shorey of Hilton 
Head Island, South Carolina, the following 
message . . . 
TO: SERIOUSLY CONCERNED PATRI-
OTS—IT IS IMPORTANT we all understand 
how this proposed Budget Bill could seri-
ously affect us! The details destroy our free-
doms & brings our uncontrolled debt to $30 
TRILLION! 
As with MOST in Congress, most voters 
won’t take time to comprehend the dev-
astating affects this $3.5 TRILLION—2500 
page budget bill the socialist Democrats are 
trying to shove down our throats! This is an 
excellent way to understand the math af-
fects—BUT the greater DISASTER will be 
the death of our free enterprise system & our 
Constitutional Republic! 
This 
cuts 
through 
all 
the 
political 
doublespeak we get. Politicians ‘new math.’ 
It puts it into a much better perspective. 
Lesson No. 1: 
U.S. Tax revenue: $2,170,000,000,000 
Fed budget: $3,820,000,000,000 
New debt: $1,650,000,000,000 
National debt: $19,271,000,000,000 
Recent budget cuts: $38,500,000,000 
Let’s now remove 8 zeros and pretend it’s 
OUR household budget: 
Annual family income: $21,700 
Money the family spent: $38,000 
New debt on the credit card: $16,500 
Outstanding balance on the credit card: 
$192,710 
Total budget cuts so far: $385 
Got it?? 
Lesson No. 2: 
Here’s another way to look at the Debt Ceil-
ing: 
Let’s say, you come home from work and 
find there has been a sewer backup in your 
neighborhood . . . and you home has sewage 
all the way up to your ceilings. What do you 
think you should do? Raise the ceilings, or 
pump out the sewage? 
In conclusion, God Bless our troops, who 
successfully protected America for 20 years, 
as the Global War on Terrorism continues 
moving from Afghanistan to our neighbor-
hoods.

HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
am honored to present Sergeant Major Rod-
ney Wayne Gilchrist, U.S. Army, Retired with 
a 
Congressional 
Veteran 
Commendation. 
SGM Gilchrist embodies the true meaning of 
selflessness, which is evident through his 
service and commitment to our nation as well 
as his community. 
SGM Gilchrist first began his service in 
1986. During this time, he completed a mul-
titude of tasks that have displayed his alle-
giance to our nation. His profound leadership 
skills are indicated by roles during his service 
such as the Advanced Noncommissioned Offi-
cers Course Small Group Leader for his Mili-
tary Occupational Specialty. This position 
speaks to the innate craftsmanship of his lead-
ership skills, as he mentored and trained 175 
Senior Noncommissioned Officers to a ninety- 
nine percent graduation rate. 
SGM Gilchrist closed out 24 years of mili-
tary service in 2010 but continued to con-
tribute his time to the people of his commu-
nity. His devotion is exhibited in countless 
ways, but one of the most notable acts to his 
community is his creation of the Liberty Chris-
tian Center of Killeen. As pastor, he has guid-
ed this center to be of service to community 
members of Killeen, giving free haircuts, cloth-
ing, and meals to any person in need. As a 
man of deep faith, SGM Gilchrist’s commit-
ment to investing his talents, and abilities to 
improve his community is a deeply held creed 
that speaks to the generosity and activism of 
a truly devoted public servant. 
I proudly join SGM Rodney Wayne Gil-
christ’s’ family, friends, and colleagues in sa-
luting his selfless service to the military and 
Texas. His work has made a real and lasting 
difference in the lives of his fellow citizens.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ESTELLE 
S. PRYOR 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a re-
markable servant, Ms. Estelle S. Pryor. 
Ms. Estelle S. Pryor was born May 8, 1929, 
to the late Charlie Smith and Lattie Howard 
Smith in Bourbon, MS. She was the sixth of 
eight children. 
She was previously married to the late Peter 
Griggs, Jr. and the late Bennie Pryor. 
Ms. Pryor received her elementary edu-
cation in the Leland School District, her sec-
ondary education and High School diploma 
from Coleman Junior and Senior High School, 
in Greenville, MS. She went on to receive a 
Bachelor of Science degree in Childhood Ele-
mentary Education and Child Education Devel-
opment from Mississippi Valley State Univer-
sity. Next, she received a CP Nurse Certificate 
from Homer G. Phillip Hospital School in St. 
Louis, MO in 1949. She also attended Deluxe 
Beauty College where she received a Cosme-
tology License in 1961, and studied Data 
Processing and Business at Moorhead Junior 
College. 
Ms. Pryor was the first African American fe-
male hired in the Washington County Court-
house as a Deputy Circuit Clerk, where she 
was later promoted to the position of Chief 
Deputy Clerk. When she was later elected as 
the Washington County Circuit Clerk, she be-
came the first African American female elected 
to public office in Washington County since re-
construction. She held that position until her 
retirement in 1995, having been in office for 
over thirty years. 
Ms. Pryor lived an exemplary life. Her hon-
ors, 
memberships, 
associations, 
achieve-
ments, and prestigious awards, too numerous 
to name, span over nearly seven decades. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Ms. Estelle S. Pryor.

lives of students and families from the Bedford 
community. 
Each year, the Department of Education 
recognizes the academic excellence of a se-
lect few elementary, middle, and high schools 
across the nation through the National Blue 
Ribbon Schools Program. In order to be rec-
ognized as a Blue Ribbon School, schools 
must demonstrate that their institution leads 
students of all backgrounds to master mean-
ingful and challenging material. The Blue Rib-
bon designation process is highly selective, 
with only two schools across the State of New 
Hampshire receiving a 2021 Blue Ribbon des-
ignation. 
Receiving its first Blue Ribbon award in 
2012, Memorial Elementary School has shown 
a consistent dedication to each student’s 
learning and wellbeing that has not gone un-
recognized. Being named a National Blue Rib-
bon School is no small feat, and I am proud 
to serve and represent a school district with 
such a strong commitment to academic excel-
lence. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate and thank everyone who has 
helped make Memorial Elementary School the 
exemplary institution that it is today.

GENERAL RAYMOND ODIERNO 
MEMORIAM 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, my thoughts and prayers go out to 
the family of General Ray Odierno, who 
passed away over the weekend. I was grateful 
to have met the General in my capacity as a 
Member of Congress and fellow veteran, and 
appreciate his service to our country. 
As reported in the New York Post: 
Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, a New Jersey 
native and former Army Chief of Staff, who 
led the successful ‘‘surge’’ that turned both 
the tide of battle and American public per-
ception in the Iraq War, died Friday at age 
67. 
‘‘The general died after a brave battle with 
cancer; his death was not related to COVID,’’ 
his family said in a statement. There were 
no further details given. 
The Association of the United States Army 
reported the general had a lengthy record 
and did several tours overseas. 
‘‘During more than 37 years of Army serv-
ice, he commanded units at every echelon, 
from platoon to theater, and served in Ger-
many, Albania, Kuwait, Iraq and across the 
U.S.,’’ the report stated. 
Odierno, who rose to the rank of four-star 
general, served three tours of duty in Iraq 
and it was under his command that elements 
of the 4th Infantry Division captured Iraqi 
dictator Saddam Hussein on Dec. 13, 2003. 
‘‘Caught like a rat,’’ Odierno famously 
stated, in one of the signature moments of 
America’s post-9/11 military conflicts. 
‘‘He was in the bottom of a hole with no 
way to fight back,’’ Odierno, then a major 
general, told global media, as images were 
broadcast around the world of the once- 
feared former dictator being dragged out of 
hiding by U.S. troops. 
Odierno was born Sept. 8, 1954, in Rock-
away Township, NJ, the son of a World War 
II Army sergeant and working mother. A 
star high school athlete, the towering 6-foot- 
5 inch Odierno played both baseball and foot-
ball at the U.S. Military Academy. He grad-
uated from West Point in 1976. 
Odierno was charged by the Bush adminis-
tration in 2007 with commanding the con-
troversial so-called ‘‘surge’’ in the Iraq War. 
The rapid deployment of tens of thousands 
of additional troops proved a success in 
quelling violence in Iraq and reducing Amer-
ican casualties and boosted Odierno’s profile 
in military and global affairs. 
He gained further international promi-
nence in 2008, after replacing Gen. David 
Petraeus as the commander of the multi-
national force in Iraq. 
Odierno was known within military circles 
for his deep commitment to the Army and to 
those soldiers, and their families, killed and 
wounded in service of their nation. 
‘‘Ray firmly believes soldiers aren’t in the 
Army, they are the Army,’’ Army Secretary 
John McHugh said at Odierno’s retirement 
ceremony in 2105, the Army Times reported. 
‘‘It’s always been his No. 1 job to serve them 
well and serve them honorably. Whether it’s 
fighting in Tikrit or visiting a hospital bed 
at Walter Reed, he’s led with a quick mind, 
calloused hands and a servant’s spirit.’’ 
Odierno is survived by his wife Linda, who 
he met in high school, as well as their three 
children, 
including 
retired 
Capt. 
Tony 
Odierno, a combat veteran, and their fami-
lies.

MILITARY SUPPORT FOR 
FIGHTING WILDFIRES ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Military Support for Fighting 
Wildfires Act’’ with Representative SARA JA-
COBS (D–CA53) as the original cosponsor. 
This comprehensive bill would improve the 
military’s support for civilian emergency re-
sponse and provide Congressional authoriza-
tion for the California Air National Guard’s 
‘‘FireGuard’’ program in partnership with the 
U.S. Air Force and the National Geospatial- 
lntelligence Agency. 
The American military has incredible capa-
bilities for intelligence, surveillance, and recon-
naissance (ISR). As chairman of the House 
Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, 
I believe that these capabilities can and 
should be used to support civilian emergency 
response to wildfires and other natural disas-
ters with the appropriate safeguards for pri-
vacy and classified collection means. 
I also believe that excess military aircraft— 
including the seven Coast Guard HC–130H 
aircraft directed by Congress for transfer to 
the U.S. Forest Service and the State of Cali-
fornia for wildfire response, following reconfig-
uration by the Air Force—should be made 
available for civilian wildland firefighting ef-
forts. As western states like California face in-
creasingly severe and frequent wildfires due to 
man-made climate change, we need all the 
help we can get from our federal government 
including the military. 
That is exactly what my ‘‘Military Support for 
Fighting Wildfires Act’’ would accomplish. This 
comprehensive legislation builds upon the 
work of many members of California’s Con-
gressional delegation, including Representa-
tives ADAM B. SCHIFF (D–CA28), SALUD O. 
CARBAJAL (D–CA24), and ZOE LOFGREN (D– 
CA19) and U.S. Senators DIANNE FEINSTEIN 
(D–CA) and ALEX PADILLA (D–CA). I look for-
ward to continuing to work with my colleagues 
as our state confronts the harsh realities of a 
new, year-round fire season due to manmade 
climate change. 
The California National Guard has used re-
motely piloted and unmanned aircraft systems, 
such as the MQ–9, for life-saving emergency 
operations in the past. However, these joint 
missions have only been completed a handful 
of times due to the lengthy approval process 
requiring the Secretary of Defense to sign off 
on each of these requests in advance. 
To address this hurdle, I secured a provi-
sion (Section 519C) in the William M. (Mac) 
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) di-
recting the U.S. Department of Defense to re-
view its approval proves for the use of un-
manned aircraft systems by the National 
Guard in support of civilian emergency re-
sponders. The House Armed Services Com-
mittee received these recommendations under 
my Congressionally directed report in April 
2021, and I expect the DOD to implement 
these changes fully. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to working 
with you and other members of the California 
delegation to advance these key reforms in 
my ‘‘Military Support for Fighting Wildfires 
Act.’’ I encourage all members to join me in 
cosponsoring this commonsense bill.

RECOGNIZING THE MONTH OF OC-
TOBER 
AS 
MANUFACTURING 
MONTH 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
join the Manufacturing Association of Central 
New York (MACNY) in recognizing the month 
of October as Manufacturing Month. This 
month serves to highlight the manufacturing 
industry’s significant contributions to Central 
New York and our nation, while encouraging 
young people to pursue opportunities in manu-
facturing. 
Importantly, in my district in Central New 
York, the Manufacturing Association of Central 
New York and its members are significant job 
creators for our region and drivers of the 
economy. Collectively, the organization is 
made up of over 300 businesses, which em-
ploy over 50,000 workers. It’s not an under-
statement to say our regional economy de-
pends on the Manufacturing Association of 
Central New York and its members. 
Beyond Central New York, manufacturing 
has a rich history in the United States. Manu-
facturing grew our economy, built the middle 
class, and helped us modernize. This industry 
was an important part of our past, and should 
be a part of our future. That’s why today, it’s 
increasingly important to celebrate the manu-
facturing industry, educate young people 
about careers in manufacturing, and expand 
educational opportunities to ensure highly- 
skilled positions are filled. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me during the month of Oc-
tober in recognizing Manufacturing Month as 
well as the great contributions of the Manufac-
turing Association of Central New York.

HONORING ANNA WASHINGTON 
LEE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
hero, Mrs. Anna Washington Lee. 
Mrs. Anna Washington Lee was born Sep-
tember 19, 1917, in Sunflower, Mississippi. On 
Sunday, September 19, 2021, a precious gift 
of life and love, celebrated her 104th birthday 
with her family, students and friends in ac-
knowledgment of her motherhood and service. 
From her humble beginnings in rural Sun-
flower County, Mrs. Lee, along with her twelve 
siblings, were raised on a system of integrity 
premised on the tenets of love, kindness and 
compassion imparted by their parents. Her 
parents instilled a central moral compass that 
echoed the heart of the Good Samaritan and 
core ethical values encompassed in the impor-
tance of work, family, community, and the love 
of God. Known for her kindness and willing-
ness to assist others, Mrs. Lee has devoted 
most of her life as the matriarch of her family, 
as an educator for 491⁄2 years in Sunflower 
and Bolivar Counties. She is also the oldest 
living female resident of the City of Mound 
Bayou, Mississippi. 
Mrs. Lee is a God-fearing Christian, a de-
voted nurturing mother of one child and one 
grandson. She is the living embodiment of a 
woman of Proverbs 31:10. She is a woman 
after God’s own heart, committed to her faith, 
her family, and her friends. Her faithful mem-
bership of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal 
Church has shown her as an upstanding pillar 
in the community. 
Mrs. Lee remains the archetype icon and 
central foundation of a family that retains and 
unbreakable bond of love, honor, devotion, 
commitment and encouragement for each 
generation; and at 104 years of age, Mrs. Lee, 
‘‘Ma Anna’’ as she is affectionately called, 
continues to be a blessing to others through 
her impartation words of advice and wise 
counsel to those in her company as a re-
minder of God’s unfailing love for us all. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Anna Washington Lee 
for her dedication and tenacity to serving her 
community and desire to be an example for 
all.

CONGRESSIONAL 
VETERAN 
COM-
MENDATION 
FOR 
CAPTAIN 
JOSEPH F. KIEFER 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
am honored to present Captain Joseph F. 
Kiefer, Jr., U.S. Air Force with a Congres-
sional Veteran Commendation. Throughout his 
life, he’s worked to put the needs and inter-
ests of others first. 
During his years of military service, Capt. 
Kiefer held multiple vital positions. He served 
in Vietnam as part of the 2nd Aerial Port 
Group, displaying meticulous attention and 
professionalism in his work. He went on to dis-
tinguish himself as the Chief of Tactical Oper-
ations Branch at Langley Air Force Base 
where his outstanding leadership was known 
to directly enhance the readiness posture of 
all active duty assigned to the Tactical Air 
Command. 
Along with defending our nation, public serv-
ice has been a driving force in Capt. Kiefer’s 
life. A pillar of Central Texas, he dedicates his 
time and energies to his local community with 
roles ranging from a Narcotics and Criminal 
Investigator to President of the Temple Lions 
Parks and Charities. It’s true and devoted pub-
lic servants like Capt. Kiefer that make Central 
Texas a great place to call home. 
I commend Capt. Kiefer’s selfless service to 
his community and nation. He is a fitting re-
cipient of a Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation and I celebrate his service.

HONORING THE CAREER OF MR. 
KEVIN WOODWARD 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the distinguished career of Mr. 
Kevin Woodward of Wells County. 
Kevin has been essential to the common 
welfare of Wells County and its residents for 
over 30 years. 
Most in Wells County know him to be a dis-
tinguished public servant. In 1990, Kevin was 
elected to the Ossian Town Board. In 1994, 
he was elected to the Wells County Council. 
Then, in 2000, he was elected commissioner 
of Wells County, a role in which he would 
serve for 21 years. As commissioner, Kevin 
worked diligently and tirelessly to respond to 
citizen concerns, fulfill state and local require-
ments, and see that county operations run 
smoothly. 
So outstanding was Kevin’s tenure as com-
missioner that he enjoyed overwhelming pop-
ular support and often the backing of both 
local Republican and Democrat parties. He 
believed in a ‘‘common sense approach to 
local government,’’ rooted in discerning the 
concerns of hardworking, tax-paying Hoosiers. 
Apart from his public service, Kevin is family 
man with roots deep in Wells County. Born 
and raised in Ossian, Kevin has been married 
for 38 years to Linda, with whom he has two 
sons and two granddaughters. 
This is a testament to Kevin’s long and dis-
tinguished service to Wells County. As he en-
ters retirement, I wish him Godspeed in this 
new chapter of life, and to know that the coun-
ty, and the whole of northeast Indiana, is for-
ever grateful for him.

HONORING DUPLAIN W. RHODES III 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
Duplain W. Rhodes, III., (fondly known as 
‘‘Pete’’) transitioned to his eternal heavenly 
rest early morning on Thursday, September 
23, 2021, at the age of 61. He was at peace 
in his final moments beside his loving wife, 
Sherry Landix Rhodes. 
Pete, born on November 14, 1959, was the 
only son of the late Doris Millaud and Duplain 
W. Rhodes, Jr. He spent his formative years 
in the Chef Menteur and Lacombe family 
homes with his beloved older sisters, Sandra 
Rhodes Duncan, Duplynn Joan Rhodes, 
Stephanie Rhodes Navarre, Kathleen Rhodes 
Astorga, and the late Edith Gomes. Pete was 
extremely close to his family, his dear Mable, 
and childhood dog, Annabel. Pete made life-
long friends in the Rhodes Drive neighborhood 
with Dennis Walker, Jimmy Robert, Cyril 
Barthe´, Ronald Woods, Don and John Scott, 
Eugene Bart, the late Corey Williams, Kenneth 
Walker, C.J. LaSassier, and Yancy Robert. 
Pete 
attended 
Martinez 
Kindergarten, 
Valena C. Jones Elementary School, and was 
a proud graduate of Saint Augustine High 
School (class of 1977). He later attended Lou-
isiana State University (LSU), Morehouse Col-
lege of Atlanta, Georgia and obtained his de-
gree in Mortuary Science from Worsham Col-
lege in Wheeling, Illinois (class of 1991). Pete 
forged lasting friendships with ‘‘Morehouse 
men’’—Joe Lewis, Chuck Releford, David 
Boyd, Michael Moultrie, Mark Moultrie, Richard 
Harleaux, and Ernest Cherrie—until the end. 
Pete earned his Funeral Director and Em-
balmer’s License from the Louisiana State 
Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors in 
1992, after completing an apprenticeship 
under his oldest sister, Sandra. At an early 
age, Pete worked in the Rhodes’ family busi-
nesses and was a servant leader in the New 
Orleans community. His parents instilled the 
value of hard work and education. Pete trav-
eled with his parents and siblings. He partici-
pated in a fact-finding trip to France for Lou-
isiana Economic Development opportunities. 
Pete grew professionally as a funeral director, 
embalmer, and remarkable businessman. Pete 
accepted responsibilities at the New Orleans 
International Airport during the years of Airport 
Rhodes. 
He was the President of Duplain W. Rhodes 
Funeral Home, a director on all Rhodes cor-
poration boards, and proudly served as funeral 
director to many grieving families. Pete was 
also the manager of Rhodes Limousine Serv-
ice, Rhodes Care Center, and supervised up-
keep of the 80-acre tree farm in Lacombe, LA. 
He was appointed to serve on the State of 
Louisiana Embalmers and Funeral Directors 
board where he served in multiple roles in-
cluding Secretary, Treasurer, and most re-
cently Vice President. In July 2021, he was 
extended for an additional four-year term. He 
served on the Louisiana Judiciary Commission 
(1997–2001). 
As an investor with the Jazzville Group, 
Pete was instrumental in successfully bringing 
the only land-based casino to New Orleans. 
He was a member and integral in reinvigo-
rating the Crescent City Funeral Directors. 
Pete was a member of the Zulu Social Aid & 
Pleasure Club and former member of Young 
Men Illinois Club. He was also active in the 
National Funeral Directors & Morticians Asso-
ciation (NFD&MA) and National Funeral Direc-
tors Association (NFDA). 
To balance his demanding life, Pete found 
peace among the bayous and large oaks of 
Lacombe. He enjoyed holidays with family 
there and loved traveling weekly to visit 
Lacombe with his son. Pete enjoyed exhila-
rating activities such as flying airplanes, deep

sea scuba diving, water skiing, and snow ski-
ing. He would often travel to Belize with close 
friends and family to scuba dive and snorkel in 
the coastal waters. He also spent time swim-
ming, tossing a frisbee, shooting pool, boating, 
and fishing. A proud moment for him was pur-
chasing his first boat, a 1982 Mitchell, with his 
sister, Joan. 
Along with his family, Pete created and 
hosted the infamous Rhodes boat parties held 
in Lacombe. Pete appreciated fine vehicles, 
including his most prized Camaro Rally Sport, 
pop-up headlight RX7, and a laundry list of 
other fun models. After a long day at work, he 
could be found spending time with family and 
friends on ‘‘the veranda’’ or enjoying time with 
his friends from Michelli’s. 
Pete was the loving husband of Sherry 
Landix Rhodes and to this cherished union of 
24 years was born their son, Duplain W. 
Rhodes, IV, and daughter, Alexis Erique 
Rhodes. From his first marriage to Irene Leon 
Grant (William) was born his eldest daughter, 
Amanda Duplynn Rhodes Segovia (Oscar). 
Pete was a loving and devoted grandfather, 
affectionately called ‘‘Pop-Pop,’’ to Jacqueline 
Sofı´a Segovia and Matthieu Santiago Segovia. 
Pete loved his children and grandbabies 
very much. He was never more than a phone 
call away and often talked about their accom-
plishments with pride. He especially enjoyed 
vacationing with his family in Biloxi, Destin, 
Fort Walton beach, and skiing in Utah annu-
ally, as well as hurricane and birthday es-
capes to Memphis. Pete was a strong role 
model to his three godchildren, Ashea Dun-
can, Tiffany Barthe´, and Jonathan Plustache. 
Pete lived by some classic principles: ‘‘Keep 
it Simple,’’ ‘‘Facts over Tears,’’ ‘‘Get it Done,’’ 
‘‘Let’s solve it over lunch,’’ ‘‘I’ve got this,’’ I’m 
going to see a man about a dog,’’ ‘‘I’m going 
to the library,’’ ‘‘Make good choices,’’ I’m not 
getting in the grass over this,’’ ‘‘Kill them with 
Kindness,’’ ‘‘Sit in the Front Row.’’ 
Pete was an adored uncle to many nieces 
and nephews: Lisa Ramsuer Fuller, Walter 
Manuel Gomes (Yvonne), Sabrina Brustie 
Duncan-Rose (Frank), Otis Barrington Dun-
can, Jr., Orrin Rhodes Duncan (Lurline), Omar 
Laneth Duncan (Gina), Ashea Lanette Dun-
can, Jasmine Monique Navarre, Gregory Ham-
mond (Antoinette), Yonus Millaud Astorga, 
Jason Henry Astorga (Candace), Willie Jaimon 
Navarre (Ashley), Vernon Leroy Aych, Jr., 
Desantos Joseph Manning, Jr., Nicholas Malik 
Manning, Trinity Faith Manning, and the late 
Kellie Erique Brown. Also survived by great 
nieces and nephews, other relatives, and 
many friends.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
JUDGE CRAIG TREBILCOCK UPON 
HIS 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
THE 
YORK COUNTY COURT OF COM-
MON PLEAS 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to recognize The Honorable Craig Trebilcock 
following the conclusion of his ten-year term of 
service in December 2021, with the York 
County Court of Common Pleas. In coordina-
tion with the York County Wellness Court 
Mentors, I’m proud to recognize Judge 
Trebilcock’s faithful service to our Country, 
York County Veterans, and the rule of law. 
Judge Trebilcock was born in 1960, in Mus-
kegon, Michigan, and is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Michigan and its Law School, in ad-
dition to the U.S. Army War College. He went 
on to serve our Country for 30 years in uni-
form with the U.S. Army and U.S. Army Re-
serve, and was deployed to the Balkans in 
U.S. peacekeeping efforts, in Operation Iraqi 
Freedom (2003–2004), and Operation Free-
dom Sentinel in Afghanistan (2015–2016), be-
fore his retirement at the rank of Colonel. Dur-
ing his three decades of uniformed service, he 
was awarded the Army Commendation Medal 
for Valor, the Bronze Star and the Legion of 
Merit. 
Judge Trebilcock’s career in law in our com-
munities began as a civil litigator and immigra-
tion attorney from 1991 to 2011, before serv-
ing as the President of the York County Bar 
Association prior to his election to the Com-
mon Pleas Court in 2011. During his time as 
a civil litigator and immigration attorney, he liti-
gated cases on behalf of Chinese refugees 
from the ship, Golden Venture, between 1993 
and 1997, and was an advocate for a York 
family in their fight against an extremist group 
in Kansas who disrupted the funerals of our 
Service Members who were Killed in Action. 
During his tenure with the Common Pleas 
Court, Judge Trebilcock founded the York 
County Veterans Treatment (now ‘‘Wellness’’) 
Court in 2012, which assists Veterans with ad-
justing to post-military life by helping to ad-
dress the risk of incarceration and substance 
abuse. Judge Trebilcock leads the team— 
court officers, VA counselors, and mentors—to 
provide genuine support to Veterans in need. 
The program ranges from 20 to 30 Veterans 
enrolled and helps them rebuild their lives and 
strengthen our community. 
For his decades of service to the United 
States and to the County of York, Pennsyl-
vania, I am privileged to have the opportunity 
to honor Judge Trebilcock, congratulate him 
on his retirement, and wish him Godspeed in 
his future adventures.

HON. JASON CROW

Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize the accomplishments of 
Leanna Harris, Jamie Sarche´, and Cary Chap-
man who will be honored by the Jewish Fam-
ily Service (JFS) for making a lasting impact in 
our community. 
Each year, JFS honors three individuals 
who embody the Jewish value of Tikkun 
Olam—the obligation to make the world a bet-
ter place—and impact our community through 
exemplary leadership, philanthropy, and dedi-
cation to JFS. The winners come from all 
walks of life but unite around their values to 
provide premier human services to those in 
need no matter their faith, age, income, ability, 
sexual orientation, or gender identity. 
The ‘‘Yana Vishnitsky Leadership Award’’ is 
given to one individual who embodies former 
JFS president and CEO, Yana Vishnitsky’s, 
commitment to exemplary leadership, public 
service and those in need. This year’s winner 
is Leanna Harris who, in addition to her work 
as an author and educational consultant dedi-
cated to improving student achievement, 
serves on the JFS Board of Directors and 
spends many of her days volunteering at the 
local Weinberg Food Pantry. 
The ‘‘Joyce and Kal Zeff Humanitarian 
Award’’ is given to two individuals who em-
body the passion of two legendary community 
leaders who made a lasting impact as a part 
of JFS—Joyce and Kal Zeff. This year’s win-
ners are Jamie Sarche´ and Cary Chapman— 
both of whom, motivated by their faith, have 
served on the JFS Board of Directors and 
committed themselves to JFS’ mission to 
make our community a better place. 
In the face of challenges like mental health 
difficulties, homelessness, and food insecu-
rity—all heightened by the ongoing COVID–19 
pandemic—our community needs heroes. In 
the last year alone, JFS helped over 25,000 
individuals with the aid of over 1,300 volun-
teers who have pulled upon their faith to serve 
as heroes in our community and in the lives of 
others. I congratulate Leanna Harris, Jamie 
Sarche´, and Cary Chapman on their award, 
and I thank them for their work making our 
community a better, more inclusive place to 
live.

RADM Maserang directed numerous health

many other countries that bettered commu-

Maserang used his expertise to enhance 
homeland security by increasing preparedness 
for chemical and biological attacks. These 
contributions, and many others, have been in-
valuable, with lasting effects felt around the 
world.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COMMIS-
SION OF FINE ARTS DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA HOME RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Commission of Fine Arts District of 
Columbia Home Rule Act. This bill would pro-
hibit the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) from 
exercising authority over non-federal property 
in the District of Columbia. 
Under presidential executive orders (EOs) 
and federal law, the CFA has review authority 
for D.C.-owned parks and buildings, as well as 
for certain private land in D.C. Under the rel-
evant EOs, CFA has review authority for the 
design of D.C.-owned parks and buildings. 
Under the Shipstead-Luce Act, CFA has re-
view authority for the design of private build-
ings in the District ‘‘adjacent to public buildings 
and grounds of major importance,’’ such as 
Rock Creek Park and the Potomac riverfront. 
Under the Old Georgetown Act, the CFA has 
review authority for the design of private build-
ings in the part of Georgetown referred to as 
‘‘Old Georgetown’’ in the act. The members of 
the CFA are appointed by the President. 
The federal government, including the CFA, 
has no business in local land-use policies and 
decisions unrelated to the federal presence. 
Not only is the federal government’s authority 
over D.C. buildings and private property anti- 
democratic, it also delays and increases the 
cost of public and private development in the 
District. 
This is an important step to increase home 
rule for the District, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this bill.

200TH 
YEAR OF MINISTRY 
HON. ANDY LEVIN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize First United Methodist 
Church, which is celebrating its 200th year of 
ministry in Mount Clemens, Michigan. 
In 1821, the church opened its doors to the 
community, then known as ‘‘Mount Clemens 
Methodist Episcopal Church.’’ Throughout its 
two hundred years, the church has built its 
reputation as a beloved community institution 
in Mount Clemens. Today, First United Meth-
odist describes itself as ‘‘a welcoming, accept-
ing, caring, and diverse Christian community.’’ 
The church celebrates this milestone year 
under the remarkable leadership of Reverend 
Dan Hart, Senior Pastor, and Reverend Alicea 
Williams, Deacon. Reverend Hart and Rev-
erend Williams excel not only in leading en-
gaging worship services, but also in building 
community programs, directing church out-
reach and caring for their beautiful congrega-
tion. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me in of-
fering congratulations to the entire First United 
Methodist Church community as they cele-
brate two hundred years of ministry and serv-
ice in Mount Clemens.

IN RECOGNITION OF SGT MICHAEL 
CARNELL 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the military service and phil-
anthropic contributions of Sergeant Michael 
Carnell. Sergeant Carnell is a wounded war-
rior, husband and father of three, who has 
worked tirelessly for veterans’ organizations in 
North Texas and was recently honored with 
the 2021 Spirit of a Hero Award. 
Sergeant Carnell honorably served nine 
years in the U.S. Marine Corps as an Anti- 
Tank Assaultman and an Intelligence Spe-
cialist, including overseas in support of Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom. Since the end of his ac-
tive duty in 2007, he has been active in vet-
erans’ support organizations such as Carry the 
Load, Save the Brave, the Adaptive Training 
Foundation and 22Kill. Through his involve-
ment with 22Kill, he has worked to alleviate 
the conditions that tragically lead to roughly 
twenty-two veterans daily resorting to suicide. 
Sergeant Carnell has raised funds to support 
veterans’ assistance organizations and ar-
dently worked to bolster community aware-
ness of the difficult issues facing veterans. 
Sergeant Carnell recently began treatment 
for Stage IV Colon and Liver Cancer. His ef-
forts on behalf of his fellow veterans has in-
spired others to provide financial assistance to 
his family to address his medical expenses. 
This year, the Spirit of a Hero organization will 
honor him with a benefit concert, motorcycle 
ride, and commemorative gala. 
I join the community of North Texas in 
thanking Sergeant Michael Carnell for his 
service to our country as a soldier and his 
subsequent service as a private citizen serving 
his veteran brothers and sisters. My thoughts 
and prayers are with him and his family as he 
continues his battle against cancer.

HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS

Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
am honored to recognize Chief Warrant Offi-
cer 2 Jason Shaw, U.S. Army, Retired for the 
Congressional Veteran Commendation. His life 
and career reflect hard work, activism, and 
dedication to what is best for Central Texas. 
CW2 Shaw spent 20 years serving our 
country, spending time in both Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. As a pilot, he was an invaluable 
asset to his unit, the task force, and the bri-
gade. His contributions and dedication to our 
nation cannot be overstated. As a pilot he was 
invaluable and, at every step along the way, 
his talents and work ethic were devoted to the 
protection of our nation. 
Upon retirement from the Army, CW2 Shaw 
committed his energies to community service. 
He is a Life Member of VFW Post 10472 and 
is active in the Leander Chamber of Com-
merce. He has worked tirelessly to ensure 
residents have a rich quality of life by using 
his expert knowledge on the city’s water sup-
ply and infrastructure to ensure the long-term 
growth of the city, which he holds near to his 
heart. His legacy speaks to the highest values 
we Texans hold dear. 
I proudly join CW2 Jason Shaw’s friends, 
family, and colleagues in saluting his selfless 
service to the Army and Texas. He is a local 
treasure, a champion for others, and a fitting 
recipient of a Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation.

BIDEN INFLATION TAX 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, on Sunday with Chris Wallace on 
Fox News Sunday, House Republican Whip 
STEVE SCALISE reviewed how Democrats’ anti- 
work policies destroying jobs resulted in Sep-
tember’s disastrous jobs reports: 
‘‘. . . look at all the policies under Presi-
dent Biden . . . the inflation that we are see-
ing . . . making it easier for people to stay 
at home . . . when every employer . . . is 
looking for workers—and then on top of that 
the regulations that they keep adding . . . 
going after small businesses, making it hard-
er to keep the supply chain moving.’’ 
‘‘We’ve got a 40 percent increase in gas 
[prices] at the pump. [The Biden Administra-
tion is] begging OPEC to produce more oil 
while they shut down the spigots in the 
United States. It makes absolutely no 
sense.’’ 
‘‘Inflation is one of the biggest drivers 
hurting out economy and hurting middle 
class families. Frankly, it’s a big tax on 
lower-income families.’’ 
In conclusion, God Bless our troops, who 
successfully protected America for 20 years, 
as the Global War on Terrorism continues 
moving from Afghanistan to American neigh-
borhoods.

South Carolina Special Olympic Games. I be-
lieve it is important for the country to continue 
growing civic organizations like the Loris 
Civitan Club. They work hard every day to en-
sure that those with mental disabilities and the 
less fortunate in the Loris community have the 
assistance they need to live a fulfilling life. The 
members associated with this club are shining 
examples of true American patriots and amaz-
ing role models for the Loris community and 
the state of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I join the people of Loris 
in congratulating the Loris Civitan Club on 
their momentous achievement. We thank them 
for the selfless actions they have taken to im-
prove the Loris community.

RECOGNIZING ERICA ALFARO AS 
CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great honor to recognize an inspiring 
motivational 
speaker 
and 
first-generation 
American in my community, Erica Alfaro, as 
my September Constituent of the Month. Erica 
was born in Fresno, California, and spent 
much of her childhood in Tijuana. Her mother, 
Teresa, a farm worker, and her father, 
Claudio, a landscaper, moved the family to 
Oceanside when Erica was 13 to provide 
Erica with educational opportunities that were 
never available to them. 
Upon arrival in Oceanside, Erica and her 
family moved into a two-bedroom apartment 
with another family, where a total of 11 people 
shared the small space. Erica recalls accom-
panying her mother to the fields and listening 
to her mother describe education as a means 
to achieve a better life. 
After becoming a mother herself at 15 years 
old and dropping out of high school, Erica 
would eventually receive her high school di-
ploma through a home school program and 
enroll in classes at MiraCosta College. During 
this time, Erica balanced an extremely heavy 
workload that included a full-time job, full-time 
classwork, and full-time motherhood. When 
her son was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, 
Erica’s grades began to slide, forcing her to 
temporarily suspend her academic dreams. 
Through this all, Erica persisted. 
Determined to complete the education her 
parents desperately desired for her, Erica 
would eventually receive an associate’s de-
gree from MiraCosta College, a bachelor’s de-
gree from California State University San 
Marcos, and a master’s degree from San 
Diego State University. 
Erica has endured hardship and inspired 
hope, and she stands today as a model of 
perseverance. Her story has touched people 
from all walks of life, and she continues to mo-
tivate others as an in-demand motivational 
speaker. In addition to her speaking engage-
ments—and her ongoing role as a devoted 
mother—Erica currently works in the Human 
Resources Department of the West Coast To-
mato Growers in Oceanside, where she in 
forms farmworkers of their rights. In celebra-
tion of Erica’s achievements and Hispanic 
Heritage Month, I’m proud to honor Erica 
Alfaro as my September Constituent of the 
Month.

CONGRESSIONAL 
VETERAN 
COM-
MENDATION FOR SERGEANT JIM 
M. YEONOPOLUS 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER. of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
am honored to present Sergeant Jim M. 
Yeonopolus, U.S. Air Force with a Congres-
sional Veteran Commendation. Throughout his 
life, he has been a shining example of the 
best of public service. 
Sgt. Yeonopolus enlisted in the Air Force in 
1968. He selflessly volunteered to serve with 
the South Vietnamese Army during the Viet-
nam War and provided them with vital re-
sources, all while serving as a ground/airborne 
radio operator. He continued to distinguish 
himself through his actions, including close air 
support during the infamous Shoemaker Cam-
paign. At every step along the way, Sgt. 
Yeonopolus used his bravery and commitment 
to the mission to save both American and 
South Vietnamese lives. 
Following 
his 
military 
retirement, 
Sgt. 
Yeonopolus served in numerous state and na-
tional leadership roles in organizations de-
voted to veterans, students, young leaders, 
and local economic development. His commit-
ment to investing his talents and abilities to 
improve his beloved community is highly admi-
rable and proves him to be an exemplary cit-
izen. His resume tells the story of a man 
unafraid to contribute both his time and ener-
gies to a multitude of organizations that rely 
on volunteerism and social engagement to 
make good communities great. 
I proudly join Sgt. Yeonopolus’ friends, fam-
ily, and colleagues in saluting his selfless 
service to the Air Force and Texas. His posi-
tive impacts on his community and fellow man 
will be felt for generations.

HONORING MRS. VELMA BENSON 
WILSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Velma 
Benson Wilson. 
Velma was born and raised in Marks, Mis-
sissippi. She is the fifth of seventeen children 
and spent her early childhood on a small rural 
farm, where her parents taught her the value 
of hard work, family, and the importance of 
getting a good education. 
Wilson graduated from Quitman County 
High School as the class valedictorian, and 
was awarded a full academic scholarship to 
St. Norbert College in DePere, Wisconsin, 
where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree 
in Sociology and Education in 1973. 
Wilson 
is 
currently 
employed 
by 
the 
Quitman County Board of Supervisors as the 
first Quitman County Economic & Tourism Di-
rector. She has been in this position for one- 
year and has made significant achievements 
by establishing a 501(3) (c) for the county to 
help generate additional funding resources 
outside the realms of state and national grant 
funds. A new Quitman County Economic & 
Tourism website has been developed to mar-
ket to potential businesses and industry, to 
seek economic opportunities. Wilson has suc-
cessful opened the Quitman County Interpre-
tive Welcome Center, which serves as a multi- 
purpose building- offering lounge space and 
restrooms for waiters and riders for the Amtrak 
trains that stop twice daily in Marks, a tourism 
gift shop and office and public meeting 
spaces. 
Wilson was instrumental in working with the 
Mississippi State Legislative, the Board of Su-
pervisors, and the City of Marks Board of Al-
dermen to obtain state bond funding of 
$200,000, to assist with the renovation of the 
county full-service grocery store, which offi-
cially closed in 2017, making Quitman County 
a food desert. Additionally, a grant was sub-
mitted and funded for $200,000, with a USDA 
American Healthy Financial Food Initiative, 
which allowed the purchase of new refrigera-
tion equipment for the grocery store. In April 
2021, this store was successful re-opening 
bringing back 30 loss jobs to the community. 
In 2016, Wilson was employed as the first 
African American, and the first female County 
Administrator for the Quitman County Board of 
Supervisors. She served in this position for 5 
years prior to transiting to the Director of Eco-
nomic Development and Tourism. Within her 
five year tenure, as County Administrator, she 
helped secured over $4 million in local, re-
gional, state and federal funds for projects that 
benefitted Quitman County. 
One of Wilson’s most momentous achieve-
ments, as County Administrator was coordi-
nating negotiations with federal, state, and 
local elected officials, as well as regional 
stakeholders in an agreement with Canadian 
National Railroad and Amtrak to allow the con-
struction of an Amtrak station in Marks, MS. 
The Amtrak station opened May 4, 2018. 
Wilson’s previous career, prior to returning 
to her hometown, included a co-business 
owner (15 years) multi-auto franchises (Buick, 
GMC, Dodge, Chrysler and Hyundai) in Jack-
son, TN. And she spent (12 years) as a social 
worker and educator. 
She is also an author. Her book, What’s in 
the Water, was the winner of 2013 Daughter 
of American Revolution Print Media Award. 
This book also gave her the distinction of 
being named as one of the twenty most influ-
ential women in West Tennessee for civic, 
business and community contributions. As a 
writer, Wilson was an Oprah’s Magazine Con-
tributor for the October and November 2013

Alumni Community Service Award; and, her 
alma mater recognized and honored her 
through the American Legion, by putting a 
copy of her book, What’s in the Water, on dis-
play in the St. Norbert College’s library. 
In 2019, Wilson was appointed to serve as 
an officer on the Delta Council as a presi-
dential appointment. She has also served as a 
board member for numerous organizations: 
Jackson, Tennessee Area Chamber of Com-
merce; March of Dimes; The Boys and Girls 
Club; Jackson Arts Council; The Jackson 
Symphony; United Way; Jackson, Tennessee 
Chapter of the Links, Inc. (Past President and 
Vice President); and NAIA (Vice Chair). 
With over 30 years of experience in edu-
cation, social services, corporate business, 
public relations, marketing, she has received 
civic and leadership awards and recognition 
for work in areas of: Teen Pregnancy Preven-
tion, Black Adoption Awareness, Services to 
Youth, NAACP, and the Christian Methodist 
Episcopal Church. She is married to Sidney 
Wilson, Jr. They have two children: Janice 
(graduate of Columbia Law School), and Sid-
ney, III (graduate of Vermont Law School). 
She has a grandson, Elias, and grand-
daughter, Tiarra. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Velma Benson Wilson 
for her dedication in serving her community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE REAL ID 
GENDER REQUIREMENT REFORM 
ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the REAL ID Gender Requirement Re-
form Act, which would remove the requirement 
from the REAL ID Act that REAL ID-compliant 
licenses include gender. Instead, the decision 
whether to have gender on a state’s REAL–ID 
compliant would be left to the states. The bill 
would also require that if a state requires gen-
der designation for licenses, an individual 
wishing to change their gender designation on 
their license be allowed to do so through self- 
attestation. It would also require states to have 
a neutral or other designation gender field, in 
addition to male or female. This is an impor-
tant bill for equality, especially for transgender 
Americans. 
Under the REAL ID Act, gender must be in-
cluded on a license. This can be problematic 
for transgender or nonbinary individuals. I rec-
ognize that some LGBTQ individuals do not 
want gender designations on licenses at all, 
while others do want gender designation so as 
to express their identity. I believe this bill 
strikes the middle ground, while showing Con-
gress’ support for LGBTQ individuals. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING OCTOBER AS HINDU 
HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, today, I 
would like to observe the month of October as 
Hindu Heritage Month. The month of October 
serves as a time for Hindu communities 
across the country to join together and cele-
brate their culture and its diverse spiritual tra-
ditions. Hindu Heritage Month is a celebration 
of the Hindu faithful that hold services in 32 
states across 91 congressional districts, in-
cluding the devoted and faithful Hindu commu-
nity of the 18th Congressional District of Illi-
nois. 
Communities of faith have long served as 
beacons of hope, sharing their beliefs, and 
supporting their communities through service. 
The vibrant Hindu-American community is no 
different and I am proud to support the exam-
ples of service in the 18th Congressional Dis-
trict by my constituents. 
The United States is a deeply faithful Na-
tion, and I am proud to support the celebration 
of October as Hindu Heritage Month. May this 
month bring awareness in recognizing and ac-
knowledging the contributions made by Hindu- 
Americans and increase awareness and un-
derstanding of the Hindu-American commu-
nity.

HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in celebration of National Hispanic Heritage 
Month. As this special time of the year winds 
down, I want to offer my sincerest appreciation 
to all our Hispanic brothers and sisters across 
Ohio, and our great country. Lorain, Ohio is 
home to the largest Puerto Rican population 
west of New York City. 
Last week, I had the privilege to join the Lo-
rain Historical Society in our district to unveil 
their new exhibit entitled, ‘‘Celebrating 100 
Years of Latino History in Lorain, Ohio’’. Co-
ordinated by partnerships with the Lorain His-
torical Society and local community and edu-
cational institutions, this proud art and cultural 
exhibition of Hispanic excellence was on dis-
play throughout National Hispanic Heritage 
Month. One story focuses on Lorain’s Vine Av-
enue. 
In the early 1920’s, Vine Avenue became 
home to a large population of Mexican immi-
grants who were brought to the city as part of 
contract labor to work in the agriculture and 
steel industries. Now, Hispanics make up 30 
percent of Lorain’s population. The city re-
mains full of life with the rooted culture of 
music, arts, cuisine, and culture from the 
Latino community. 
Again, to those celebrating, I wish all a joy-
ous celebration of National Hispanic Heritage 
Month 2021.
