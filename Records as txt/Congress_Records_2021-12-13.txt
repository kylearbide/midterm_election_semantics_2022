Holy parent of us all, visit Your chil-

sist from all inhumane, illegal mass expul-
sions of Haitian citizens without opportunity 
for such individuals to exercise lawful rights 
to seek asylum and other humanitarian pro-
tections; which was referred jointly to the 
Committees on Homeland Security and the 
Judiciary.

dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the tornadoes that hit Kentucky this 
past weekend were some of the most 
widespread, severe, and devastating in 
our State’s history. 
It is still difficult to comprehend the 
vast scope of the storm. Nearly 40 tor-
nadoes touched down across 6 States. 
One tornado in Kentucky stayed on the 
ground for over 200 miles—200 miles. 
This was potentially the longest con-
tinuous path of any tornado in U.S. 
history. 
Towns have been reduced to rubble. 
Families are picking up pieces of their 
shattered lives. Most tragically, our 
Governor announced today that more 
than 60 Kentuckians are confirmed to 
have lost their lives. Many more re-
main unaccounted for. 
This is the worst storm to hit Ken-
tucky in my lifetime. The tornadoes 
have caused considerable damage in 15 
counties all across the Commonwealth. 
Thousands lost their homes. Tens of 
thousands are still without power. This 
was, in the words of one meteorologist, 
‘‘the worst-case scenario’’ for destruc-
tion. And it came during the Christmas 
season. Families are supposed to be 
gathering soon for rest, relaxation, and 
reunion. Now, so many Kentuckians 
are facing exactly the opposite. 
The whole country is becoming ac-
quainted with Mayfield, KY, likely our 
hardest hit city. Mayfield is a town of 
10,000 in the Jackson Purchase. It has 
been known for the beautiful Greek Re-
vival facade of the Mayfield First 
United Methodist Church. Now, First 
United is completely gone, and the 
town is literally leveled to the ground. 
Mayfield’s candle factory was oper-
ating in full swing this weekend to 
keep up with the Christmas demand. It 
was once a mainstay of the commu-
nity, employing hundreds. On Friday 
night, the factory was turned into a 
scene of absolute horror. Many of the 
employees who were working that 
evening are feared dead. Rescue oper-
ations are ongoing. At least 40 employ-
ees were rescued initially. One was 
saved after being trapped under 5 feet 
of rubble for hours. The devastation 
there is absolute. 
The tornado was so powerful that it 
ripped 27 train cars off their tracks in 
Earlington and scattered them across a 
field. A family photograph that was 
picked up by the storm in Dawson 
Springs, KY, was carried nearly 130 
miles by the wind and discovered over 
in Indiana. 
All across Western Kentucky, resi-
dents spent their Saturday and Sunday 
clearing debris and collecting clothes 
and possessions that had been scat-
tered. Families were left to inspect the 
cinderblocks where their houses once 
stood. The cheery lights of Christmas-
time have been replaced by absolute 
destruction. 
Kentucky has been devastated, but 
we have not been defeated. Kentuck-
ians are resilient people who will stay 
strong and united through the crisis. 
I am incredibly grateful to the first 
responders who have been on the

ground since the outset: Kentucky Na-
tional Guard, Kentucky State Police, 
sheriff’s departments, city and local 
law enforcement, EMS responders, fire-
fighters, doctors, and nurses. Quick 
thinking and selfless action saved 
lives. 
Hard-hit communities are receiving 
an outpouring of support from across 
the Commonwealth as well as around 
the country. Americans near and far 
are coming together to donate food, 
blood, resources, and shelter to those 
in need. Businesses and individuals 
have helped fund relief efforts and do-
nated to assist the storm’s victims. 
Like many of my fellow Kentuckians, 
I was incredibly touched by the support 
offered by the University of Kentucky 
basketball team this past weekend. 
While visiting the University of Notre 
Dame, they led a deeply emotional mo-
ment of silence before their game on 
Saturday night. The team visited the 
school’s grotto to light candles for 
storm victims and to pray for recovery. 
We are all praying alongside them. 
Kentucky’s State motto is ‘‘United 
we stand, divided we fall.’’ In this time 
of crisis, Kentuckians are standing 
shoulder to shoulder, and we will not 
fail. At every level of local, State, and 
Federal Government across both polit-
ical parties, Kentucky’s leaders have 
come together to coordinate and to 
provide aid. 
Toward the end of the week, I will 
travel back to Kentucky to meet with 
my constituents and visit the areas af-
fected by the storm. My team has been 
working nonstop to ensure Kentuck-
ians receive the help that they need. 
I have worked closely with President 
Biden and Governor Beshear to ensure 
every Federal resource possible is de-
ployed to our State. Kentucky’s con-
gressional delegation has come to-
gether to send multiple letters to the 
President in support of disaster relief. 
In 
response, 
President 
Biden 
cut 
through the redtape to approve our re-
quests at an accelerated pace, pro-
viding the rapid support we need to re-
cover. 
I am especially grateful for the work 
of DHS Secretary Mayorkas and FEMA 
Administrator Criswell, who visited 
Kentucky yesterday to survey damage 
and to help relief efforts. FEMA has al-
ready sent two incident management 
teams, an urban search and rescue 
team, and an Army Corps temporary 
power team. They have turned Ken-
tucky’s Fort Campbell into a staging 
ground for vital relief and supplies. I 
could not be more grateful for their 
swift and decisive response to this cri-
sis. 
Even in the face of such tragedy, we 
can be confident that Kentucky will 
bounce back. We are strong; we are 
united; and we will come back bigger 
and better than ever before. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
today the prayers of the Senate extend 
to all of those impacted by the deadly 
tornadoes that broke out across the 
South and Midwest over the weekend. 
We pray and mourn especially for the 
people of Kentucky, where far too 
many lives have been lost and the full 
extent of the damage has yet to be de-
termined. 
Over the weekend, President Biden 
declared a state of emergency in Ken-
tucky, authorizing FEMA to coordi-
nate disaster relief and provide emer-
gency assistance. He also announced he 
will travel this week to Kentucky to 
assess the damage and receive briefings 
of recovery efforts. 
It is likely that the storms from this 
weekend will go down as some of the 
worst tornado outbreaks on record, and 
with heavy hearts we will continue to 
monitor rescue and first response ef-
forts in the coming days. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, this week the Senate has a lot to 
get done as we approach the end of the 
year. 
Over the course of the week, we ex-
pect to hold a number of votes to con-
firm more of President Biden’s nomi-
nees to serve lifetime appointments to 
the Federal bench. On that front, we 
will later vote this afternoon on the 
confirmation of Judge Lucy Koh to 
serve as a circuit judge for the Ninth 
District Court of Appeals. Her nomina-
tion was favorably reported out of the 
committee with bipartisan support. 
If confirmed, Judge Koh would be the 
first-ever Korean-American woman to 
sit on any circuit court in the country. 
The daughter of immigrants, her back-
ground is an inspiring testament to the 
American dream. Lucy’s mom escaped 
as a child on foot from the oppression 
of North Korea, eventually coming to 
the States. Lucy spent the majority of 
her own upbringing in rural Mis-
sissippi, graduating from both Harvard 
and Harvard Law School. 
For the last 11 years, Lucy Koh has 
served admirably as a district judge for 
the District of Northern California. 
She has authored over 3,000 opinions 
and presided in 270 cases—everything 
from the rights of criminal defendants 
in seeking legal representation to the 
protection of online consumer data in 
the hands of companies, to ensuring 
that the Trump administration did not 
prematurely end its completion of the 
2020 census. She did all those things. 
She wrote on all those things and of-
fered opinions. 
All the while, she has conducted her-
self with impartiality, excellence, and 
above all, with fidelity to the Constitu-
tion and the rule of law. I have no 
doubt she will continue building on her 
excellent judicial record as an appel-
late judge on the Ninth Circuit, and I 
look forward to voting in favor of her 
confirmation later today. 
Later this week, we will hold votes 
on other nominees as well, including 
Samantha Elliott to serve as a judge 
for the District of New Hampshire and 
Jennifer Sung to serve as a circuit 
judge for the Ninth Circuit. 
Once we confirm all three judges— 
Koh, Elliott, and Sung—the Senate will 
have confirmed a total of 31 judges to 
the Federal bench, 11 to the circuit 
courts, and 20 to the district courts. I 
am proud to say over half of them are 
women. Over half of them are people of 
color. 
All of them are outstanding, highly 
qualified, and they bring sorely needed 
diversity to the bench—not just per-
sonal diversity but professional diver-
sity as well. In decades past, it would 
have been hard imagining many of 
these nominees getting a serious look 
in this Chamber, but one by one, Sen-
ate Democrats are working with Presi-
dent Biden to expand the possibilities 
of who can and who should serve as a 
judge in this country, and we will keep 
working. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, now, on other Sen-
ate business and Build Back Better, in 
addition to making progress on nomi-
nees, the Senate has been doing the 
hard work of putting ourselves in a po-
sition to finish our other high-level pri-
orities for the rest of the year. 
Last week, we advanced bipartisan 
legislation that will enable this Cham-
ber to address the debt ceiling on a 
fast-track basis. For the information of 
all, the Senate will act tomorrow to 
prevent default. The Senate will act to-
morrow to prevent default. 
The Senate could also begin proc-
essing the annual Defense authoriza-
tion bill—negotiated on a bipartisan, 
bicameral basis—as early as tomorrow. 
Between now and the end of the year, 
Members should also expect we will 
hold votes to confirm even more of the 
President’s nominees. 
And on a parallel track, the Senate is 
moving forward on the reconciliation 
process so we can vote on President 
Biden’s Build Back Better Act before 
the Christmas holiday. Committees 
that received reconciliation instruc-
tions have been submitting their final 
text to the Parliamentarian, the Con-
gressional Budget Office, and to our 
Republican counterparts. 
Throughout the week, both Repub-
licans and Democrats will hold bipar-
tisan Byrd bath meetings with the Par-
liamentarian. Meanwhile, I will also 
continue to meet with my colleagues, 
and I know the President will also con-
tinue discussions with them as we 
hammer out the final details of Build 
Back Better. 
This remains a laborious process, re-
quiring a lot of precision and a lot of 
pieces moving together. I want to 
thank my colleagues and their staff 
and especially the Parliamentarian and 
her team for their dedication and focus 
as we approach a vote on the floor. 
The work is not yet finished, but we 
are working hard to put the Senate in 
a position to get the legislation across 
the finish line before Christmas. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.

S9103 
December 13, 2021 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, a 
powerful tornado stretched across 200 
miles, never leaving the land, and per-
haps the longest streak of tornado de-
struction we have ever seen in the 
United States of America. And my 
heart goes out to all those families who 
have been so impacted, all those who 
are lost, all those who are without a 
home, all those whose lives have been 
turned upside down. 
We, the Senate, must act to be sup-
portive of our fellow Americans who 
have faced such incredible destruction. 
CHINA 
Madam President, I come today to 
the floor to address another tragedy—a 
tragedy unfolding in China, where the 
Olympic Games are scheduled to begin 
on February 4. 
I come to the floor to applaud Presi-
dent Biden for speaking out and an-
nouncing a diplomatic boycott of the 
2022 February Beijing Olympic Games. 
This is absolutely the right thing to 
do, and as Beijing’s response has 
shown, it sends a clear signal to the 
world that the world will not silently 
stand by as human rights are so dra-
matically abused. 
For 2 weeks in February, the world 
will join together in the bask of the 
spectacle of the Winter Games. We will 
experience the highs and lows, as ath-
letes from around the globe experience 
themselves the thrills of victory and 
the agony of defeat. 
Athletes heading to the Games dream 
of thrilling the world and winning med-
als, but they also dream of contrib-
uting to the Olympic spirit, a spirit 
often spoken of in terms of working to 
build a better world through sports, 
which is why it is so offensive that 
these Games are set to take place in 
the shadow of some of the world’s most 
egregious assaults on human rights and 
human dignity. 
It is mind-boggling to me that the 
International 
Olympic 
Committee 
chose just this past March to charac-
terize their strategic roadmap of the 5 
years using such lofty goals as the 
Games will ‘‘contribute to more inclu-
sive society and to peace,’’ and yet al-
lowing the Games to go on in a nation 
where genocide is taking place at this 
very moment. It is mind-boggling be-
cause it is not some small abuse that is 
taking place but one of the worst the 
world has ever seen. 
The Chinese Government has been 
committing, and is continuing to com-
mit, genocide against a religious mi-
nority, and they are stripping away the 
political rights of Hong Kong’s citi-
zens, and they are suppressing the free- 
rights speeches of Chinese activists and 
advocates and journalists and bullying 
China’s critics at home and abroad. 
We cannot allow China to use the 
shine of the Olympic medals to blind 
the world to these facts. We have seen 
this before, and philosophers say that 
those who don’t learn from history are 
doomed to repeat it. 
So let’s return to 1936, the Olympic 
Stadium, 
the 
Olympic 
flag 
flying 
proudly not just in the stadium but 
throughout the city of Berlin for the 
summer Games right next to Nazi 
swastikas. It still shocks me to think 
of the world watching and cheering on 
as the Olympic torch was lit in a sta-
dium filled with men and women giving 
the Nazi salute as Adolf Hitler watched 
on. 
The Nazi regime had already started 
carrying out their racist, genocidal 
policies. They had already persecuted 
Jewish, German, and LGBTQ men and 
women, and labor activists and other 
minorities. They had already rounded 
up and jailed political opponents other 
nondesirables, 
including 
some 
800 
Roma in and around Berlin, who, just 
weeks before the start of the Games, 
were locked away in a camp outside 
the city. 
But the world chose to look away 
from that unfolding horror. For 2 
weeks during the Games, the Nazis 
took down their anti-Semitic signs, the 
propaganda ministry made newspapers 
ease up on hateful rhetoric, and the 
world praised the German government, 
legitimizing their regime with such 
fawning declarations as when the New 
York Times observed that the Games 
put Germany back in the fold of na-
tions. 
The world allowed itself to be be-
guiled by the Nazi facade. Behind that 
facade stood a violent, racist regime. 
Behind that facade was a government 
that controlled what the people living 
within its power could do and what 
they could say. Behind that facade was 
a regime that had no belief in anyone’s 
basic human rights and that within 3 
years was seeking to conquer the world 
while simultaneously murdering 6 mil-
lion Jewish individuals and millions of 
other non-Jewish men, women, and 
children. 
What if, instead of being taken in by 
the spectacle of the Games, and what 
if, instead of allowing the Nazis to use 
those Games for propaganda, the lead-
ers of the world had stood up and 
pushed back? How much death and de-
struction might have been prevented? 
We will never know. 
But what we do know is that we have 
the opportunity right now to learn 
from that past mistake and to do bet-
ter. 
Elie Wiesel once said: ‘‘There may be 
times when we are powerless to prevent 
injustice, but there must never be a 
time when we fail to protest.’’ 
We cannot fail to protest the Chinese 
Government’s actions that stain the 
mission and purpose of the Olympics 
Games, because there is absolutely no 
question about the kinds of crimes and 
atrocities that are being committed by 
the Chinese Government at this very 
moment—atrocities like the enslave-
ment and genocide against the Uighur 
Muslim minority being carried out in 
the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Re-
gion. That genocide has been docu-
mented, it has been recognized, and it 
has been publicly announced by two 
different Presidential administrations. 
That genocide completely reflects 
the United Nations’ official definition 
of ‘‘a crime committed with the intent 
to destroy a national, ethnic, racial, or 
religious group in whole or in part.’’ 
At the direction of President Xi of 
China, at least a million Uighurs are 
being detained and enslaved in camps 
in Xinjiang. They are forced to toil and 
work for the Chinese Government, pro-
ducing cotton and other goods while 
undergoing 
reeducation 
programs 
where they are forced to renounce their 
faith and pledge loyalty to the Chinese 
Communist Party. 
This is a process described in one of-
ficial Chinese document as ‘‘washing 
brains, cleansing hearts, strengthening 
righteousness and eliminating evil.’’ It 
certainly is one of the most dramatic 
forms of evil taking place at this mo-
ment. That is what the Chinese Gov-
ernment is doing to the Uighur people. 
The crimes against these individuals 
include torture, sleep deprivation, sex-
ual abuse, rape, forced sterilizations, 
and abortions. One woman who fled the 
country after being released from a 
camp, who resides here now in the 
United States, recounted stories to re-
porters and human rights investigators 
of women being taken from their cells 
every night, brought to another room 
to be tortured and raped by one or 
more masked men. She, and another 
woman who was forced to help facili-
tate these assaults, have spoken about 
police officers paying good money to 
have their pick of the imprisoned 
women and girls. Those who are re-
turned to their cells are threatened 
with even more pain and more torture 
if they say anything. 
And these crimes and this repression 
aren’t contained just to the camps. 
Millions in Xinjiang are subjected to 
Orwellian surveillance and discrimina-
tion, restricted from traveling or going 
to school, from freely speaking or free-
ly worshipping. Meanwhile, the Chinese 
Government is systematically ripping 
children from their parents’ arms, forc-
ing them to live in state-run facilities 
where they are being indoctrinated to 
renounce their faith, ethnicity, and 
culture; to view their parents as Chi-
na’s enemies; and to praise the Com-
munist Party. 
All of that has been going on for 
years, at least since 2017, and all of it 
will still be going on as the Inter-
national Olympic Committee and ath-
letes from around the world gather in 
Beijing on February 4 for the opening 
ceremonies. And if the world is silent, 
if 
there 
are 
no 
protests 
or 
con-
sequences, all that will serve simply to 
embolden the Chinese Government and 
their genocidal efforts. 
Beijing’s egregious actions don’t stop 
with crimes against the Uighur people. 
We see those crimes in Hong Kong, 
where the Chinese Government is strip-
ping the rights of Hongkongers, one 
day after another. 
Back in 1998, China promised to ad-
here to the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ 
model. They signed a contract with

Great Britain to do so. They guaran-
teed freedom and rights to the citizens 
of Hong Kong. But we have watched in 
2019 and 2020 as the Chinese Govern-
ment has systematically dismantled 
the political rights of those in Hong 
Kong, working to silence any form of 
dissent, to silence any voice of opinion 
that might disagree with that of the 
Chinese Government. Demonstrators 
are beaten with batons and tear-gassed 
and pepper-sprayed and shot for assert-
ing basic human rights—rights they 
were guaranteed when Hong Kong was 
reclaimed by China. 
It fills me with dismay and rage at 
what the citizens of Hong Kong have 
lost under this oppression. This time 
last year, the Hong Kong people were 
still protesting and fighting for their 
freedom. Hundreds of thousands gath-
ered, watching as messages of support 
for their cause came in from around 
the world and played out on giant 
screens. There was a feeling of hope. 
But that hope lies shattered in the 
streets of Hong Kong today. Today, 
China has used the heavy hand of the 
national security law to ensure that 
only patriots loyal to Beijing can hold 
positions of power. They have crushed 
the hope. They have destroyed the free-
dom. They have destroyed the political 
rights of the 7.5 million citizens of 
Hong Kong. 
Rarely in the history of the world 
have so many people been together 
celebrating their elections, celebrating 
their free speeches, and seen it crushed 
in such short order. 
It is in this context that China is 
hosting the February Winter Olympic 
Games of 2022. And we, the free world, 
standing up for the rights of every indi-
vidual to exercise the fundamental 
freedoms and the equal and inalienable 
right of the U.N. Declaration of Human 
Rights that we are all born with, must 
speak out against these actions. 
None of what China is doing is a 
major surprise because it has unfolded 
in such a systematic way now for so 
many years. China engaged in a cam-
paign of controlling its citizens and si-
lencing dissent, including silencing dis-
sent within its borders. Human rights 
organizations have long and well docu-
mented the abuses. 
This picture is of Chang Weiping, a 
Chinese lawyer who the government 
says was detained for allegedly inciting 
subversion of state power because he 
participated in a protest. After he was 
released on bail, Chang released a video 
statement describing the physical and 
psychological torture that he experi-
enced while being detained. So authori-
ties arrested him again and charged 
him with subverting state power. He is 
now one of those heroes who have stood 
up for the freedom of all the people of 
Hong Kong, and he is being held by the 
Chinese Government for standing up 
and speaking out for what is right. 
It is not only lawyers and advocates 
who are detained when they speak out 
against the Government in China; it is 
also a three-time Chinese Olympic ten-
nis star who disappeared from the pub-
lic eye after accusing a party official of 
sexual assault. 
‘‘Where is Tennis Star Peng Shuai?’’ 
The International Olympic Committee 
says that she is safe and well after two 
video calls with the Olympian. Critics 
say these calls and emails supposedly 
from her and videos of her dining in a 
restaurant are ‘‘obviously staged’’ by 
the Chinese Government to counter 
criticism. Where is she really? Is she 
OK? Nobody but the Chinese Govern-
ment can say for sure. 
The 
International 
Olympic 
Com-
mittee, as an organization whose mis-
sion, according to its own president, 
Thomas Bach, ‘‘to put sport at the 
service of humanity goes hand-in-hand 
with human rights’’—those are the 
very words of the president of the IOC. 
An organization that puts sport at the 
service of humanity and goes hand in 
hand with human rights should be, like 
the Women’s Tennis Association, refus-
ing to hold events in China until 
human rights are honored. I give great, 
great compliments to the WTA for 
standing up for this abuse of one of 
their own and more broadly the abuse 
we see throughout China. 
I am thrilled with the administra-
tion’s announcement of a diplomatic 
boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. I 
am thrilled that Great Britain and 
Canada and Australia and Lithuania 
have joined in this effort. But I say to 
you right now: Where is the rest of the 
world? Where is France? Where is Ger-
many? Where is Spain? Where are all 
the governments of the world that be-
lieve in the rights of free speech and 
free assembly? The chorus must be 
broader. The free world must join to-
gether and stand up for the vision of 
what it means to be in the free world 
and how horrific abuses would involve 
genocide or the obliteration of demo-
cratic rights. 
The 
International 
Olympic 
Com-
mittee says: Well, the Games are all 
about athletes, so we don’t get in-
volved in politics. It is all about the 
athletes. 
Well, I tell you today that staging 
the Games in the shadow of genocide 
and the stripping of political rights 
from those in Hong Kong is putting the 
athletes in the position of helping build 
the facade that disguises those assaults 
on human dignity and human rights. 
That is a horrific thing to do to the 
athletes of the world. It is an unaccept-
able thing to do to the athletes of the 
world. You cannot force the athletes of 
the world to be complicit in covering 
up these crimes. It is wrong, and the 
Olympic Committee needs to stand up 
and call out these crimes and know 
that they are not in keeping with the 
Olympic spirit. They are not in keeping 
with human rights, although the presi-
dent of the IOC has said that is their 
mission. 
It is quite clear the Olympic Com-
mittee could have done far more to 
avert this situation because when the 
Games were awarded, they received 
promises on human rights—promises 
that were not honored. They could 
have moved the Games years ago. They 
could have clarified that would happen, 
but they did nothing. They did nothing 
except help cover up the genocide in 
China by leaving the Games as they are 
and failing to note or criticize or ob-
serve the horror that has been unfold-
ing. 
Business as usual is unacceptable in 
the face of genocide. Business as usual 
is immoral in the face of genocide. 
Business as usual in any dimension in 
a country committing crimes against 
humanity is just wrong. 
I say to the IOC today: Stand up. Call 
out this crime and say never again will 
you ever stage Olympic Games in a 
country committing gross violations of 
human rights. 
That statement would be in keeping 
with the Olympic spirit. It would be in 
keeping with the Olympic spirit to say 
that they will defend the freedom of 
every single athlete at the Olympic 
Games to stand up and speak their 
mind in defense of the oppressed people 
of Tibet, in defense of the enslaved peo-
ple of Xinjiang Province, in defense of 
the citizens of Hong Kong who have 
lost their political rights. Lay out 
clearly before the world that the Olym-
pic Games will not be a place where 
freedom of speech is crushed as it is 
being crushed across China. 
Colleagues, I think this viewpoint I 
am expressing today of the world 
standing up to the horrors of Chinese 
atrocities is shared by every Member of 
this Chamber and every Member of the 
House of Representatives down the 
hall. Not a one of us would rise to de-
fend these horrific acts, which is why 
every one of us should stand together 
today to condemn Chinese genocide 
and Chinese destruction of political 
liberties and make sure that these 
Games are not ones where the world 
leaders are silenced; that these Games 
are not ones where the sponsors look 
the other way; that these Games are 
not ones where the athletes are not 
free to express how tragic they con-
sider it to be that these terrible things 
are happening and need to end. Let us 
not repeat the mistakes of 1936 and 
look the other way. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the words I just heard from the Sen-
ator from Oregon are very refreshing,

Thank you very much. 
EAGLES ACT 
Madam President, today, I come to 
the floor to once again talk about the 
tragic shooting that occurred at Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas High School in 
Parkland, FL, now a long time back— 
February 14, 2018—and the Justice De-
partment’s response to it. 
Part of my oversight work is to see 
that the laws are faithfully executed. 
Before I get to that, I want to express, 
as we all have done, I am sure, many

December 13, 2021 
times, our condolences to those victims 
and families of the school shooting in 
Michigan last month. The shooting was 
an act of evil, and we ought to pray for 
the affected victims. 
Recently, the Justice Department 
reached a settlement with the families 
involved in the Parkland shooting for a 
reported $130 million. The school shoot-
ing was another evil act. It took the 
lives of 17 innocent students and teach-
ers. Based on reports, the Justice De-
partment 
settled 
because 
the 
FBI 
failed to properly investigate tips 
warning Federal law enforcement per-
sonnel about the coming attack that 
happened on February 14. 
This was a concern of mine from the 
beginning. Even though the Justice De-
partment has settled the matter, the 
Department hasn’t been fully trans-
parent with the Congress on this issue, 
and they ought to be because this tax-
payers’ money—however it is used, the 
public ought to know it. The public’s 
business ought to be public. 
I am going to highlight some of the 
oversight steps that I have taken and 
how the FBI still hasn’t done what 
they said they need to do. 
Two days after the shooting, while I 
was chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I wrote to the FBI asking 
about its failure to act on tips that 
they had received about the dangers 
that this shooter might cause against 
the public at large. I also wrote to 
Google about the threats made in a 
YouTube comment that the shooter ap-
parently made. 
After that, I brought the FBI in to 
brief the full Judiciary Committee on 
February 23, 2018. That was just 9 days 
after 
the 
accident 
happened—the 
shooting happened. It was not an acci-
dent; it was intended. I am sorry I used 
the word ‘‘accident.’’ I did the same 
thing with Google and Facebook staff 
to discuss their cooperation with law 
enforcement. 
On March 14, 2018, I led a full com-
mittee oversight hearing to hold the 
Justice Department and the FBI ac-
countable for their failures. In the FBI 
briefing and at the committee’s March 
14, 2018, hearing, then-FBI Deputy Di-
rector David Bowdich said that the FBI 
had begun a review of the internal 
process failures. Those failures related 
to the intake procedure for call-in tips 
and what transpired in the Parkland 
case in regard to those call-in tipoffs. 
For months after the hearing, my 
staff asked for updates regarding the 
FBI’s investigation report. In May 2018, 
they were told—my staff was told it 
would be final by approximately mid- 
June 2018. 
On August 27, 2018, I wrote to FBI Di-
rector Wray noting that up to this 
point, ‘‘Committee staff have requested 
a copy of the report seven times from 
the FBI.’’ Here we are now, 3 years 
later, 2021, and the FBI still hasn’t pro-
duced the report to Congress. 
Time and again, the Justice Depart-
ment and the FBI have failed to live up 
to the standards of transparency re-
quired of them. The Parkland shooting 
and the Department’s response to it is 
another example from a growing list of 
shortcomings. 
Simply put, there is no basis for the 
Department and the FBI to withhold 
the Parkland report from Congress, 
and by withholding it from Congress, 
they are withholding it from the Amer-
ican people. That is especially true for 
those families who suffered the tragic 
loss. 
Transparency 
brings 
account-
ability, and the more the Department 
fights that principle, the brighter light 
will be shined on them. 
Going forward, while we can’t take 
back the terrible events of that day, we 
can and we must take steps to make 
sure such horrific acts don’t ever hap-
pen again. That is why earlier this 
year, along with a bipartisan group of 
Senators, I introduced a bill that I call 
the EAGLES Act. It is the EAGLES 
Act because that is the mascot of the 
Parkland High School. 
The EAGLES Act will help fund and 
reauthorize the U.S. Secret Service’s 
National Threat Assessment Center. 
That is where the U.S. Secret Service 
studies 
targeted 
violence 
and 
proactively 
identifies 
and 
manages 
threats before they result in more trag-
edies. It would also establish a Safe 
School Initiative to look at school vio-
lence prevention and expand research 
on school violence. 
The EAGLES Act is a commonsense 
bill supported by over 40 State attor-
neys general and representatives from 
both sides. In other words, for decades, 
the Secret Service has been instructing 
people how to recognize people who 
may be a threat to the public at large 
or a threat to themselves so that there 
can be intervention. So if we do the 
same thing for people in education— 
the school teachers, the administra-
tors, other support staff—they could 
have the same training that the Secret 
Service gives to other people but not to 
school people. Then maybe we can have 
interventions on future school shoot-
ings so that they don’t happen again. 
I ask and encourage all of my Senate 
colleagues to help pass this bill. 
Then, on a shorter version of another 
subject, I would like to say to my col-
leagues, last week, all Republican 
members of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee sent Attorney General Garland 
a letter. We said he should withdraw 
his memo from October 4 that made 
parents feel like domestic terrorists for 
going to local school board meetings to 
express their views on anything that 
they have a constitutional right to 
have their express views on, and there 
is no limit in the Constitution. Also, 
the members of this Senate Republican 
minority agreed that true criminal 
acts should be prosecuted. 
Now, unfortunately, the Attorney 
General is going in the wrong direc-
tion. A whistleblower revealed that 
FBI’s Counterterrorism Division is in-
volved in the Department of Justice’s 
effort of intimidation and is keeping 
track of what goes on at local school 
board levels, whether it is criminal or 
not. 
This flies in the face of what Attor-
ney General Garland testified to the 
Judiciary Committee. The Attorney 
General has insisted to the committee 
that his instructions to law enforce-
ment have nothing to do with stopping 
parents from criticizing school boards 
and that he doesn’t think parents are 
domestic terrorists, but his own FBI 
doesn’t see it that way. 
Last week, one of my colleagues on 
the Judiciary Committee defended the 
Attorney General and his memo. That 
member talked about school board 
members getting angry emails and 
being threatened. If the facts discussed 
by my colleague rise to being crimes, 
they should—they sound like the sort 
of things local law enforcement can 
handle just fine on their own. There is 
no need for FBI involvement or Na-
tional Security Division involvement, 
which ought to be involved with strict-
ly terrorism. 
But we should all agree that the 
FBI’s 
Counterterrorism 
Division 
should have nothing to do with it. If 
you are a parent who is upset with how 
your child’s school is being run, you 
should be able to say so to the very 
school board making decisions on how 
that school should be run. But will the 
FBI’s Counterterrorism Division keep a 
record of what you say at the school 
board meetings? If so, that ought to 
concern all of us. I have gotten many 
letters 
from 
constituents 
worried 
about this sort of thing. 
Mr. Attorney General, parents are 
not terrorists, not domestic terrorists. 
You said so yourself; now prove that 
you mean it. So the simple way to 
prove it is, call off the FBI’s Counter-
terrorism Division. Withdraw your Oc-
tober 4 memo. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to once again call for 
every Senator to have the opportunity 
to cast their vote on the Military Jus-
tice Improvement and Increasing Pre-
vention 
Act, 
which 
was 
unceremoniously and undemocratically 
removed from the NDAA behind closed 
doors. 
I started calling for an up-or-down 
vote on this bill on May 24 because I 
feared that this would happen and that 
the NDAA would not do enough to ad-
dress the epidemic of sexual violence 
and serious crimes in the U.S. military. 
Now that we have seen the text, it is 
clear that those fears were well-found-
ed. 
Committee leadership has overridden 
the will of a filibuster-proof majority 
in the Senate and a majority of the 
House, who called for real reform that 
would have moved serious crimes to 
independent military prosecutors. In-
stead, committee leadership has codi-
fied the status quo, leaving com-
manders as the convening authority—

even in sex crimes cases. That is the 
same system that everyone supposedly 
agreed is failing our servicemembers. 
Unfortunately, this does not fix the 
issue of convening authority, which 
was the singular ask from the survivor 
community. 
The NDAA does not make the nec-
essary changes to the military justice 
system. The change we must make— 
the change that survivors and veterans 
have asked for—is to remove all serious 
nonmilitary crimes from the chain of 
command. Commanders are not law-
yers or judges, and they don’t have 
training or expertise necessary to 
make those complex legal decisions. 
Our servicemembers have told us 
that they do not trust commanders to 
be unbiased or to deliver real justice in 
cases where they know the survivor or 
the accused. 
Although I have heard from my col-
leagues saying otherwise, the NDAA 
does not remove sex crimes or any 
other serious crimes from the chain of 
command. And I want to be clear about 
this because the American people and 
our servicemembers deserve to know 
the truth. The NDAA keeps the com-
mander as the convening authority. 
Every single court-martial will still 
begin with the words: ‘‘This court-mar-
tial was convened by order of the com-
mander.’’ 
It tells you everything you need to 
know. 
The NDAA also continues to offer 
commanders the ability to choose the 
members of the jury panel. I want to 
address this point specifically because 
I have heard a few misleading state-
ments about jury selection. 
The NDAA allows a commander who 
is creating the court-martial to hand-
pick other members of his command to 
be the jury pool from which the jury 
will be formed. Our bill, on the other 
hand, would put this responsibility in 
the hands of an independent attorney 
without a stake in the outcome. 
Unlike what some who lack an under-
standing of the UCMJ have said, under 
our bill, the independent prosecutor is 
not the same person as the independent 
convening authority. Those are two 
separate military attorneys. 
Don Christensen, president of Protect 
Our Defenders, said about the NDAA 
that ‘‘because commanders retain con-
vening authority and associated powers 
such as selecting jury court members, 
commanders will still wield significant 
influence over the court-martial pro-
ceeding. Such influence erodes the 
independence of the special victims’ 
prosecutor and fails to address the con-
cerns of the survivor community that 
conflicted commanders still have too 
much influence over the military jus-
tice process.’’ 
The command influence does not stop 
with jury selection. The NDAA also al-
lows commanders to oversee the pre-
liminary 
inquiry. 
It 
retains 
com-
manders’ ability to order depositions 
and to order warrants of attachment. 
It continues to allow commanders to 
grant immunity and to approve delays. 
It retains commanders’ power to deter-
mine the incapacity of the accused and 
to select witnesses. It allows com-
manders to approve of findings and sen-
tences and to order the reconsideration 
of ambiguous sentences. It also allows 
the commanders to grant clemency and 
to allow the accused to separate from 
the service instead of facing a court- 
martial—fully eluding the justice sys-
tem. 
Anyone who looks at the system sees 
a system where the commander is still 
in charge, where their influence cannot 
be overlooked. There is no way for the 
prosecutors to be or to be seen to be 
independent under that system. There 
will be no improvement in trust or, 
necessarily, in the results. 
Today, just one-third of survivors of 
sexual assault in the military are will-
ing to come out of the shadows to re-
port their crime, showing a clear lack 
of trust in the current system, but 44 
percent of survivors indicate that they 
would have been more likely to come 
forward if the prosecutor were in 
charge of the decision over whether to 
move forward with their case. 
The Military Justice Improvement 
and Increasing Prevention Act is the 
only provision that would empower im-
partial, independent prosecutors to 
make the vital decisions necessary for 
a criminal justice system shielded from 
systemic command influence, while al-
lowing commanders to focus on what 
they do best: warfighting, training 
troops. 
I want to share the words of Retired 
Navy LT Paula Coughlin, a survivor 
who brought the Tailhook Symposium 
scandal to light 30 years ago. She said: 
‘‘The efforts to gut reform are unac-
ceptable to the survivor community 
and must be rejected. If this effort suc-
ceeds, it will be a slap in the face to 
those who have put it all on the line 
this past decade.’’ 
Those survivors and the majority of 
my colleagues here in the Senate who 
support real reform deserve to have 
their voices heard. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 1520 and the Senate 
proceed to its consideration; that there 
be 2 hours of debate equally divided in 
the usual form; and that upon the use 
or yielding back of such time, the Sen-
ate vote on the bill with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, reserv-
ing my right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, on 
military justice reform, I am pleased 
that the NDAA that we will consider 
this week will enact sweeping and his-
toric reform that changes how sexual 
assault and other offenses are inves-
tigated and prosecuted in the Armed 
Forces. 
This 
bipartisan, 
bicameral 
compromise was achieved after tough 
negotiations with the House and also 
with the administration. The House 
voted last week 363 to 70 to pass this 
bill 
with 
these 
reforms—an 
over-
whelming endorsement of the work 
that we do. I look forward to a similar, 
strong vote in the Senate this week, 
sending these reforms to the President 
of the United States. 
As you know, there have been many 
proposals for improving how the mili-
tary prosecutes sexual assault and 
other crimes, from Senators, Rep-
resentatives, from the administration, 
and from other organizations, all of 
them with their unique merits. Bring-
ing all this together was difficult and 
complicated, but I believe we have 
done so effectively. 
Our bill removes all meaningful pros-
ecutorial authority from the military 
chain of command for the series of sex-
ual assault offenses under the UCMJ, 
as well as for other offenses, including 
the wrongful distribution of intimate 
visual 
images, 
domestic 
violence, 
stalking, retaliation, murder, man-
slaughter, kidnapping, and child por-
nography. 
Our bill creates special trial counsel, 
who 
are 
highly 
specialized, 
inde-
pendent prosecutors outside the chain 
of command of the victims and the ac-
cused. They will have exclusive, bind-
ing, and final decision-making author-
ity over whether to prosecute these 
crimes. 
Under our bill, no commander will be 
able to overrule the binding decision of 
a special trial counsel to prosecute or 
not prosecute a case. Similarly, our 
bill ensures that the special trial coun-
sel have the exclusive authority to 
withdraw or dismiss charges or speci-
fications, removing that power from 
commanders. 
Finally, our bill will make a large 
number of necessary and conforming 
amendments to the UCMJ to effectuate 
this reform, and I am sure there will be 
need for more of this during the 2-year 
implementation period. 
The bottom line is that the reforms 
contained in this bill represent a sea 
change in military justice. At the end 
of the day, this NDAA will enact the 
most sweeping reform to the UCMJ in 
decades, and that is why Protect Our 
Defenders—probably one of the most 
effective 
and 
vocal 
organizations 
founded on the premise of defending 
the rights of victims of sexual as-
sault—said: ‘‘The provisions included 
in this year’s NDAA are the most 
transformative 
military 
justice 
re-
forms in our Nation’s history.’’ 
Madam President, having made that 
statement, I will object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I would like to 
thank the chairman for his steadfast 
work on trying to find common ground

here, but I disagree that ‘‘all meaning-
ful prosecutorial’’ actions have been 
taken away from the commander. 
These are the actions that still rest 
with the commander, and these are 
meaningful: granting clemency, highly 
meaningful; 
grant 
sentencing 
wit-
nesses, highly meaningful; granting 
immunity, highly meaningful; ordering 
depositions, highly meaningful; pre-
liminary inquiries, highly meaningful; 
separation authority, highly meaning-
ful. These are things that are essential 
to the prosecution of any case, and so 
if the prosecutor doesn’t have the right 
to do these things, it means the pros-
ecutor has to go ask the commander: 
May I do these things? May I call this 
witness? May I have approval for a wit-
ness at sentencing? May I have ap-
proval for this preliminary inquiry? 
That request alone sends the signal 
to survivors and to servicemembers 
that the chain of command is still in 
charge; that that independent pros-
ecutor, while the language of the bill 
sounds really good—they are inde-
pendent and their decision is binding, 
wonderful. The perception of service-
members who understand the weight of 
convening authority, they know what 
the 
words 
‘‘convening 
authority’’ 
mean; they know what the command 
ability and importance is. 
They may not receive these changes 
and these reforms in the way the chair-
man believes them to be seen. They 
may not see them as the ‘‘most trans-
formative reforms’’ that have ever hap-
pened because if they still perceive the 
chain of command in charge, it may 
not dent their willingness to report 
these crimes. They may not have now 
the ability to report and to have a be-
lief that they can have faith in this 
system. 
And so my question to the chairman 
is, Why didn’t we take the extra step to 
do the one thing that we have been try-
ing to do for 8 years, which was to 
make these prosecutors, these inde-
pendent, 
specialized 
prosecutors— 
which is what we have been fighting 
for, for 8 years—truly independent and 
give them all the authority the con-
vening authority had? 
The only change they would have had 
to make is the designation of ‘‘con-
vening authority’’ would go from the 
commander to these new, independent, 
trained prosecutors. It is a simple 
change. It is a change we have begged 
for from the survivor community, from 
the veterans organizations, from Pro-
tect Our Defenders, the best and most 
effective vocal organization, per the 
chairman. We have asked for that one 
change—to be denied by this con-
ference committee of four men in a 
closed room making the decision them-
selves. 
And for the chairman to get up and 
say that having such an overwhelming 
vote by the House of Representatives 
just shows how right they are, well, 
then why does 220 cosponsors in the 
House mean nothing? Why does 66 
sponsors in the Senate mean nothing? 
Why does the endorsement of every 
veterans group in America mean noth-
ing? Why does the support of 29 attor-
neys general mean nothing? That is my 
question. 
And it is such a small thing. 
So, 
yes, 
having 
an 
independent, 
trained military prosecutor outside the 
chain of command whose decision is 
binding sounds amazing. That is what 
we have been fighting for. Why not 
make it really independent? Why not 
take the convening authority and give 
it to the independent, trained military 
prosecutor? 
And, sadly, the answer is the DOD 
does not want to change the status 
quo. They don’t want to make these 
changes, and so what they are willing 
to do is they are willing to put a great 
label on it. They are willing to pretend 
that they are doing the thing that we 
have asked them to do. They are will-
ing to create the impression that they 
are doing the thing we asked them to 
do. But they know what ‘‘convening 
authority’’ means, and they retained 
it. 
And when asked: Please, take the 
convening authority, give it to the 
trained 
military 
prosecutor; 
please 
make a truly independent system, like 
all these people are asking you to do, 
they said no. They said no over and 
over and over again. 
And, unfortunately, our chairman did 
not want to disregard the views of the 
Department of Defense. And, unfortu-
nately, that is my job, to oversee, to 
provide oversight and accountability 
over the Department of Defense, over 
the executive branch. That is what the 
Constitution requires this Chamber, 
this body, this Senate to do. We are not 
supposed to take our marching orders 
from the Department of Defense. We 
are not supposed to do what the gen-
erals ask us to do. 
We are supposed to look hard and 
fast at a problem that has plagued our 
servicemembers who give their lives 
for this country. We are asked to solve 
the problem, and we have put forward 
legislation that has the blessing of 66 
Senators and 220 House Members and 
every veterans organizations that we 
know of and every single of the 29 at-
torneys general who have written a let-
ter. We have this breadth of support, 
but it doesn’t matter because it is not 
what the DOD wants to do. 
So, yes, having independent, trained 
military prosecutors who make deci-
sions outside the chain of command 
that cannot be changed is definitely a 
step in the right direction, but it is not 
the independent review that we asked 
for because without convening author-
ity, the perception of servicemembers, 
of survivors, of the men and women 
this justice system is designed to pro-
tect will be that all these rights and 
privileges sit with the commander and 
that these are rights and privileges 
that have value, that have ‘‘meaningful 
prosecutorial value.’’ 
They are not meaningless, and if 
they were so meaningless, then you 
would have given it to independent 
prosecutors. 
That is why I will keep fighting on 
behalf of survivors. It is why we do not 
just say we are excited, and we go 
home. It is why we have not decided 
this is the moment to celebrate be-
cause, for us, it is not because I worry 
that that percentage of sexual assaults, 
rapes, and unwanted sexual contact— 
the 20,000 that are estimated every 
year—that the percentage of those that 
will be willing to come forward will not 
go up and the rate of cases will not go 
down and the rate of cases that end in 
conviction will not go up. 
So that is my concern. It is why I 
stand here gravely concerned and very 
dismayed and very disappointed that 
we did not take this moment in time to 
do the right thing on behalf of our 
servicemembers to have a military jus-
tice system that is worthy of their sac-
rifice. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
this week, the Senate is going to take 
up three Ninth Circuit judges, three 
Federal judges for the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
And in the process, the Biden admin-
istration is going to smash an institu-
tional and constitutional norm be-
tween the executive and legislative 
branches, particularly the executive 
branch, the White House, and the U.S. 
Senate that every U.S. Senator—all 100 
of us—should be concerned about. 
Let me explain. This is a really im-
portant issue. 
Article II, section 2, of the U.S. Con-
stitution says the following: 
[The President] shall have Power, by and 
with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, 
to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the 
Senators present concur; and he shall nomi-
nate, and by and with the Advice and Con-
sent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambas-
sadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, 
Judges of the supreme Court, and all other 
Officers of the United States. 
Now, that includes Federal circuit 
court judges, 
Throughout this, article II, section 2, 
provision of the Constitution, it says: 
‘‘[W]ith the Advice and Consent of the 
Senate.’’ We are ‘‘of the Senate,’’ right 
here. And this week, we will be voting 
on three U.S. court of appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit. 
Now, this provision in the Constitu-
tion, like so many which gives the U.S. 
Senate the exclusive right for the ad-
vice and consent power, was the result 
of compromise. 
If you look at the history in Fed-
eralist Nos. 75 and 76, Alexander Ham-
ilton argued that this provision af-
forded a necessary means of checks and 
balances against the executive branch, 
against the President. 
The Constitution—according to the 
U.S. Senate history that I am quoting 
from—‘‘also provides that the Senate 
shall have the power to accept or reject

December 13, 2021 
presidential appointees to the execu-
tive and judicial branches.’’ 
This was born of compromise, as I 
mentioned: 
In debating the issue, the framers ad-
dressed concerns that entrusting the ap-
pointment power exclusively to the president 
would encourage monarchial tendencies. Ad-
ditionally, as the Senate was to represent 
each state equally, its role— 
The advice and consent role in the 
Constitution— 
—offered security to the small states, whose 
delegates feared they would be overwhelmed 
by appointees sympathetic to larger states. 
For these reasons, since I have been 
in the U.S. Senate, I have taken this 
advice and consent role very seriously 
for all nominees: during the Obama ad-
ministration, when I was here for the 
last 2 years of that administration; all 
of the Trump administration; and now 
the Biden administration. 
And as you can imagine, whenever I 
have asked for a meeting of any nomi-
nee so I could meet with them under 
this constitutional provision for a Sen-
ate-confirmed position, every single 
administration I have dealt with—the 
three I just named—has said: Of course, 
Senator. That is your constitutional 
role. Of course you should meet with 
them. 
Why is that? Why has every White 
House said yes? 
Because, as I just mentioned, they 
know that that is literally our con-
stitutional role, as I just mentioned. 
So every time I have asked for one of 
these meetings for a Senate-confirmed 
nominee of any administration, it has 
always been granted, until today— 
until today. 
As I said, the Senate’s business—a lot 
of the business this week is actually 
going to be focused on the advice and 
consent constitutional role that we 
have, especially as it relates to judges. 
But I have been told by this White 
House, specifically the White House 
Counsel, I guess—to be honest, it is 
often difficult to figure out who is in 
charge over there—that I can’t meet 
with any of these Ninth Circuit judges 
that we are going to vote on this week 
before the vote. 
This is a shocking breach of constitu-
tional norms between the White House 
and the Senate that every Senator 
here—every 
Senator, 
regardless 
of 
party—should be concerned about. 
Why? 
As I mentioned, the advice and con-
sent role is really important for every 
Senate-confirmed position, mandated 
by the U.S. Constitution, but it is par-
ticularly important for judges—judges 
who will get life tenure. By the end of 
this week, it is likely that these three 
Ninth Circuit judges will be on the 
bench for the rest of their lives, and 
right now I can’t get a 1-hour meeting 
with them. 
They have enormous power over 
American citizens. And I am going to 
talk about the Ninth Circuit and the 
power it has over my citizens. 
So my experience as a Senator is 
that I meet with as many judges as 
possible, and whenever I have re-
quested a meeting of any administra-
tion to meet with a judge, it has al-
ways been granted. But I always, al-
ways, always meet with the Ninth Cir-
cuit judges. 
As I mentioned, until now, I had 
interviewed every single Ninth Circuit 
judge that this body has voted on for 
the last 7 years—every single one—dur-
ing my entire time in the Senate. 
Why is it so important to me? 
Why is it so important to everybody? 
Well, specifically, as it relates to the 
Ninth Circuit, if you can look at this 
map, as many Americans know, our 
Federal court systems are divided into 
what are called circuits. The Ninth Cir-
cuit, which is this dark brown, is the 
biggest Federal court of appeals in the 
country. It is huge. Look at all the 
States that are under the jurisdiction 
of the Ninth Circuit: California, Idaho, 
Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Mon-
tana, Alaska, Hawaii. It is enormous. 
Almost one in five Americans are 
under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Cir-
cuit. It has enormous power, especially 
over my constituents in the great 
State of Alaska. 
But here is the thing. If you look at 
the number of judges that each Circuit 
Court gets, another reason why the 
Ninth Circuit is so important and so 
powerful is that it gets an enormous 
number of judges. The Ninth Circuit is 
listed here on the far left. Out of 29 ac-
tive judges, one judge comes from the 
great State of Alaska. One judge comes 
from the great State of Alaska. So, as 
you 
can 
imagine, 
discussing 
legal 
issues with any judge from the Ninth 
Circuit is very important to me and, 
more importantly, to the people I rep-
resent. 
Here is something else about the 
Ninth Circuit. On so many issues that 
matter to my constituents, the court 
gets the legal issues wrong. The court 
gets the legal issues wrong. 
Now, I have seen this firsthand. Al-
most 25 years ago, I had the honor of 
being a Ninth Circuit law clerk for the 
only Ninth Circuit judge we have in 
Alaska, Judge Andrew Kleinfeld, a phe-
nomenal judge. I watched panel after 
panel in the Ninth Circuit get cases re-
lated to the great State of Alaska 
wrong. 
Now, look. In some ways it is not 
their fault. Yes, they had different 
views and a legal outlook. But if you 
are a judge and you grew up in LA and 
all you know is LA and California laws, 
and now you are a Ninth Circuit judge 
and you are supposed to rule on all 
these Alaska-specific Federal laws, you 
really don’t know what you are doing. 
You don’t really know what you are 
doing, and I saw that as a young law-
yer. 
But don’t take my word for it. 
In the last 4 years, the U.S. Supreme 
Court has taken up three specific Alas-
ka cases, two of which were from the 
Ninth Circuit and one of which was 
from the DC Circuit. These big, impor-
tant circuits all got them wrong. They 
are cases that would have changed the 
history and future of my State. 
So when I meet with nominees for 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit, it is usually always very cor-
dial. I walk them through a lot of 
issues, legal issues of which they know 
very little about—again, not their 
fault—and to explain why these are so 
important to the people I represent. 
Again, if you are an LA lawyer or a 
lawyer from Phoenix, you don’t know 
about Native Alaskan law. You don’t 
know about the Alaskan National In-
terest Lands Conservation Act, called 
ANILCA—a Federal law, 1,000 pages— 
that the U.S. Supreme Court, in the 
last 3 years, twice smacked down the 
Ninth Circuit, 9 to 0—9 to 0—because 
the Ninth Circuit continually gets 
these Alaska-focused statutes wrong. 
So I walk them through these issues. 
That is all I do. It is not a big deal. It 
is actually trying to help the judges. I 
think every Ninth Circuit judge I have 
met with appreciates it. 
Let me give you a couple of examples 
of what I would do if I could meet with 
these judges. 
Like I said, ANILCA, or the Alaska 
National Interest Lands Conservation 
Act, is a hugely important Federal law 
that was passed in 1980. We didn’t want 
it, by the way. It federalized almost 100 
million acres of land in Alaska. Imag-
ine that. Most States aren’t even as big 
as 100 million acres. 
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9 to 0 
in favor of a moose hunter who wanted 
access to Federal land. His name is 
John Sturgeon. He is a very famous 
Alaskan right now. 
It went back to the Ninth Circuit. 
They misinterpreted it. It went back 
up to the U.S. Supreme Court—9-zip— 
they smacked it down again. 
Justice Kagan, who wrote the second 
opinion, said: ‘‘If [John] Sturgeon lived 
in any other State, his [law]suit would 
not have [had] a prayer of success. . . . 
Except that Sturgeon lives in Alaska. 
And as we [the U.S. Supreme Court] 
have said before, ‘Alaska is often the 
exception, not the rule,’ ’’ when it 
comes to these kind of Federal laws in 
Federal parks. 
Do you think it would be good to 
have a Ninth Circuit judge getting 
ready to get on the court to understand 
the Sturgeon case? It would be. So that 
is what I do. I have the judges read 
Sturgeon. I have them read other 
cases. It is all advice and consent. It is 
our constitutional role. Until today, I 
have done it with every Ninth Circuit 
judge. 
Like I said, I was over at the White 
House on Friday, really kind of bang-
ing the table on the Biden administra-
tion’s war on Alaska. Some of you may 
have seen a speech I gave last week. 
There are 20 Executive orders and Ex-
ecutive actions singularly focused on 
my great State—20—crushing working 
families. 
And I said: You know, one thing I 
would like to do is continue my record 
of meeting with every Ninth Circuit

judge. I am available Sunday, Sunday 
night, all day Monday. Give me a call. 
I haven’t heard anything back. 
Something else I do with these judges 
when they come before me is I talk 
about Indian law. Now a lot of lawyers 
think, ‘‘Hey, I really know Indian law 
well.’’ And my advice and counsel in 
the advice-and-consent process, when it 
comes to Indian law in Alaska, is ‘‘If 
you think you are an expert, throw out 
everything you know about lower 48 In-
dian law when it comes to Alaskan In-
dian law. 
The Native Alaskan law, in Alaska— 
the Federal law—is 100 percent dif-
ferent than it is in the lower 48. This is 
just advice I give judges who are going 
on the Ninth Circuit. They don’t know 
this. An LA lawyer doesn’t know this. 
This week, we are celebrating the 
50th anniversary of Congress’s passage 
of the Alaska Native Claims Settle-
ment Act, what we call in Alaska 
ANCSA, the largest settlement of in-
digenous land claims, certainly, in 
America, and probably in the world. It 
is a really successful act, not perfect, 
very innovative. But it has been liti-
gated like crazy. 
We had a case from the Ninth Circuit 
several years ago that essentially said: 
ANCSA 
created 
reservation 
land 
throughout the entire State of Alaska. 
That would have changed the history 
of Alaska forever. Of course, the Ninth 
Circuit got it wrong. That case went up 
to the Supreme Court. Nine-zip, the 
Supreme Court smacked down the 
Ninth 
Circuit. 
They 
said: 
ANCSA 
doesn’t do that. That is not what Con-
gress intended. 
Do you think it would be good for 
these judges this week, if I could sit 
down with them, to understand that? It 
would be really good, really important. 
It would help them for their job. 
Just this year, the DC Circuit on an-
other ANCSA-related case, the Che-
halis case, got ANCSA wrong again. 
And guess what. It went up to the U.S. 
Supreme Court again. They just ruled 
on it 4 months ago. It was a huge vic-
tory for my State, again. 
We wrote an amicus brief—Senator 
MURKOWSKI, Congressman YOUNG, and 
I. But it was enormously important. 
This wrong case of the DC Circuit 
would have changed the history of 
Alaska forever. The Supreme Court, 6 
to 3, said: No, you are misinterpreting 
Alaska. 
Do you think these judges on the 
Ninth Circuit who we are debating to 
confirm this week would learn a little 
bit about that if I could meet with 
them? They would. 
Finally, the other thing I always do 
with circuit judges is I talk about the 
Second 
Amendment. 
The 
Second 
Amendment is really, really important 
to the people I represent. We use fire-
arms for food, for self-defense in the 
wild. Well over 60 percent of all the 
homes in my State have firearms for 
these reasons. 
If you are an LA lawyer, you don’t 
know this stuff. But, all of a sudden, 
you are going to be ruling on cases 
that deal with Alaska or Idaho or Mon-
tana. And here is the thing: They 
might not know these issues, these 
judges. I have looked at their back-
ground. I wanted to interview them. 
Remarkably, I can’t get an interview 
with them. 
And here is the thing: As soon as 
they get confirmed, they are going to 
get these cases before them, in my 
State and other States, to rule on 
these kinds of issues. 
Do you think a meeting would help 
them? 
‘‘Boy, I should really think about 
that. I remember Senator SULLIVAN 
talked about ANILCA and the Stur-
geon case. I am really glad I read the 
Sturgeon case.’’ 
This is why these advice-and-consent 
constitutional meetings are so impor-
tant. 
And, as I mentioned, I have been 
doing this my entire time in the Sen-
ate. I have never not had a meeting 
with a Ninth Circuit judge. It doesn’t 
matter where they are from—Montana, 
Arizona, Washington State. They are 
going to rule on issues that relate to 
my State and my constituents. 
And these judges don’t mind it. They 
actually, I think, enjoy it. They learn. 
But this White House says: You can’t 
meet with them. 
This is absurd. 
Here is the question: What are they 
hiding? 
What are they worried about? 
Are they hiding something? Are the 
judges hiding something? 
Again, this is a precedent that Demo-
crats and Republicans should all be 
against, because we know what goes 
around comes around in this body. And 
this just doesn’t make sense. 
All three of these Ninth Circuit 
judges will have life tenure and enor-
mous, enormous power over everybody 
in the Ninth Circuit. That is 20 percent 
of all Americans, and, certainly, enor-
mous power over the people in Alaska, 
whom I am privileged to serve and rep-
resent. 
These judges are likely to know very 
little about these issues that I just 
talked about. Well, I believe I have a 
constitutional role to help them under-
stand these issues better, and that is 
the way it has always been. Nobody has 
complained. 
Absurdly, the White House has said: 
Well, Senator SULLIVAN, you can meet 
with a Ninth Circuit judge if they are 
from Alaska. 
What? We have one judge, and she is 
not going to be retiring any time soon. 
That is it. 
Now, here is the thing. I just talked 
to the previous administration’s White 
House counsel this morning, when I 
called the Biden administration’s coun-
sel this morning. I am still waiting for 
that phone call, by the way, because I 
said: Look, if the White House Counsel 
is saying no to a U.S. Senator to do his 
constitutional duty, I would like to 
hear it directly from her. 
So she hasn’t called me back yet. But 
I talked to the previous administra-
tion’s White House Counsel, and I 
asked: By the way, did you guys do 
this? I am just double-checking. I 
mean, I got to meet with all the Ninth 
Circuit judges President Trump put 
forward. But did you blackball Demo-
crats? Did you do that? 
And they said: Absolutely not. 
I made a few phone calls to other 
people in the White House Counsel’s of-
fice. They said: To the contrary, when 
any Senator wanted to meet with any 
circuit judge, we always made it hap-
pen. 
So this is a new precedent. And, 
again, it doesn’t matter if you are a 
Republican or a Democrat. This is just 
a bad precedent. 
And the notion that ‘‘Well, Senator, 
you get to meet with a Ninth Circuit 
judge from Alaska,’’ when, by the way, 
California, I think, has close to 20 
Ninth Circuit judges—but the notion 
that you can only meet with the one 
who is from your State is actually mo-
ronic. The people who need to be edu-
cated are the ones who aren’t from 
your State, because they are all going 
to rule on issues from your State. 
So I am still waiting for the White 
House Counsel to call me back—or 
whoever is in charge in the White 
House. 
But I am going to conclude with this. 
I am going to go around them. I am 
going to go around them. Here is what 
I am going to do, and I hope someone is 
watching from the White House. But, 
more importantly, I hope someone is 
watching from the judge’s chambers. 
So, Judge Koh, we are getting ready 
to vote on your nomination tonight. 
Judge Sung of Oregon, we are getting 
ready to vote on your nomination to-
morrow. 
Judge Sanchez of California, the 
rumor is, the majority leader is going 
to file cloture on your nomination. 
Those are three Ninth Circuit judges. 
Judge Holly Thomas of California, 
you might get voted on this week too. 
Four. 
Here is my ask: Give me a call. Give 
me a call. Give my office a call. I will 
meet with you tonight. Let’s do a 
phone call. Do you want to learn about 
ANILCA? Do you want to learn about 
the Sturgeon case? It will make you a 
better Ninth Circuit judge. Here is the 
number: (202) 224–1026. Give my office a 
call. I am ready to meet anytime. 
Here is the thing for the judges: It is 
1 hour of your time. You are going to 
have lifetime tenure. It is 1 hour to 
talk to a U.S. Senator who is doing his 
constitutional duty for the people he 
represents. It shouldn’t be that hard. 
As a matter of fact, this is probably 
your first test of judicial independence. 
A U.S. Senator of the Senate—of the 
Senate; read the Constitution—wants 
to undertake his advice and consent, 
his constitutional role, with you, OK? 
You guys have read the Constitution, 
those four judges I just mentioned, but 
an unelected bureaucrat in the White

House—I guess the White House Coun-
sel, but who the heck knows; it is hard 
to tell who is in charge over there—is 
blocking this. 
So, again, give my office a call at 
(202) 224–1026. I am ready to meet and 
talk to you anytime before the vote. 
Don’t worry—I don’t think President 
Biden is going to yank your nomina-
tion if you call me. Heck, he probably 
doesn’t even know this is going on. But 
you know this is the right thing to do, 
Judges. You have read the Constitu-
tion. Heck, if our meeting goes well, I 
might even vote for you. 
But here is the thing: You will learn 
more about the issues that you are 
going to have to deal with very soon in 
your tenure that you probably don’t 
know anything about—no offense to 
you. I have read your backgrounds. 
You don’t know anything about Native 
Alaskan law. You don’t know anything 
about ANILCA. You probably have 
very different views than I and my con-
stituents do on the Second Amend-
ment. But you need to hear these 
issues because you are going to be life- 
tenured on the Ninth Circuit, and you 
don’t have time to talk to me, a U.S. 
Senator, who is a Senator representing 
a State from the Ninth Circuit? You 
know it is wrong. 
By the way, my colleagues in the 
Senate know it is wrong. So I hope my 
Democratic and Republican colleagues 
realize that this is not a good prece-
dent. This is not a good precedent. It 
has never happened as long as I have 
been here. 
You know, from big things to small 
things, this administration has really 
focused in many ways on smashing po-
litical and institutional norms that 
have enjoyed strong bipartisan sup-
port. It is not good for this body, and it 
is not good for the government. 
The Wall Street Journal, today, had 
an article about Biden’s Federal regu-
lators staging a coup against the Direc-
tor of the FDIC on bank mergers. One 
of these regulators doesn’t even have 
the power over bank mergers, and now 
he is trying to be in charge. 
I serve on the U.S. Naval Academy’s 
Board of Visitors. It is a huge honor. 
The President comes in, President 
Biden, and fires everybody on the serv-
ice academies who was appointed by 
President Trump. Nobody has ever 
done that before—no President. Every-
body on the Board of Visitors of the 
Naval Academy is furious—the Demo-
crats, the Republicans. The No. 1 thing 
they are saying is, this President is the 
first one to politicize the service acad-
emies. Then, oh, by the way, he hasn’t 
appointed anyone yet to replace the 
people he fired, so we didn’t have a 
quorum for our meeting last week. 
He is just smashing institutional 
norms. Yet this institutional norm of 
advice and consent, when it comes to 
circuit court judges with life tenure, is 
something that we have all agreed 
upon. The previous administration cer-
tainly allowed for it. Yet, right now, I 
can’t meet with Ninth Circuit judges 
who are going to have enormous power 
for their entire lives over my constitu-
ents. 
So, to my colleagues, we shouldn’t 
allow this. You guys know it is wrong. 
To the judges—like I said, Judge San-
chez, Judge Koh, Judge Sung, Judge 
Thomas—give my office a call. Do the 
right thing. Your first test of judicial 
independence is before you of the Sen-
ate. The U.S. Senate—of the Senate, of 
which I am a part—wants to do our 
constitutional role. Give us a call so we 
can do it. Ignore the very bad advice 
you are getting from the White House 
Counsel or whoever is in charge over 
there. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN EDWARD PRITCHARD 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, the time has come to once again 
bid farewell to another one of Team 
Blackburn’s esteemed fellows. 
Over the past year, we have had the 
privilege of working with Capt. Edward 
Pritchard, who came to us from the 
U.S. Marine Corps to serve as our first 
Department of Defense fellow. 
It was a strange year to be a fellow 
here in the Senate, but Ed rose to the 
occasion and impressed us. He im-
pressed every one of us with his work 
ethic, humor, and his singular commit-
ment to maintaining the strength and 
integrity of the U.S. military. It has 
truly been an honor having Ed on our 
team, and I think I speak for each and 
every one of us when I say we will miss 
him. 
Captain Pritchard, I thank you for 
your service to Tennessee and to this 
great Nation and wish you all the best 
as you head across the river to the 
Pentagon to start the next exciting 
chapter in your already distinguished 
career. 
INFLATION 
Madam President, last Friday, the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics released a 
grim set of numbers that confirmed our 
worst fears: Inflation is getting worse, 
and by this month, the American peo-
ple are in for even more economic pain. 
Why? Because their paychecks just 
can’t keep up with the skyrocketing 
prices. On top of everything else, they 
get to look forward to a pay cut every 
month for the foreseeable future, and 
all this is happening just in time for 
Christmas. It is insult added to injury. 
Now, it would be bad enough if this 
economic nosedive would have hap-
pened no matter what the White House 
had chosen to do, but it would not have 
happened. It was totally preventable. 
No, this is the direct result of the 
Democrats’ reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree that started in March and has 
lasted all year long. 
American 
families 
struggled 
to 
stretch their budgets through 6.8 per-
cent inflation in November—that was 
in November—which is the highest we 
have seen in almost 40 years. We are 
looking at the largest 12-month in-
crease since 1982. 
Think about this: All of this hap-
pened just as the experts predicted and 
just as Tennesseans kept saying they 
feared this was what would happen. 
Now, despite a mountain of evidence 
proving their recovery strategy has 
failed, Democrats are ready to lean 
into the past year’s insanity and pump 
not millions, not billions, but tril-
lions—trillions—of 
dollars 
into 
the 
economy that they have already de-
stroyed. What is worse is they are try-
ing to leverage this economic pain 
against their Republican colleagues by 
refusing to raise the debt ceiling to ac-
commodate their own reckless spend-
ing. 
You can’t make this stuff up. This is 
Biden economics, it is intentional, and 
it is painful because what the Demo-
crats are doing is showing they are 
willing to spend taxpayer money on 
things that taxpayers don’t want, 
which is this destructive economic 
agenda. 
So I ask my Democratic colleagues: 
What is it about these numbers that 
are staring you in the face that you do 
not understand? Are you so eager to 
force President Biden’s ‘‘Build Back 
Broke’’ agenda on the American people 
that you are willing to throw reason 
and accountability and basic econom-
ics out the window? Is it really worth 
watching your fellow countrymen suf-
fer? Is it worth watching people whom 
you represent, people who elected you, 
suffer? 
If you all bothered to pay attention, 
what you would see is just how bad it 
has gotten out here in the real world. 
The policies that you are so convinced 
will lead us into a socialist utopia, as 
some on the left like to say, have 
dragged the people into a constant— 
constant—state of fear and worry. 
One Tennessee mom told me last 
week: 
Marsha, this stuff scares me. It just scares 
me. 
RUSSIA 
Now, Madam President, this not only 
makes for an extremely discontented 
group of people, it makes us vulnerable 
as a nation. The new ‘‘axis of evil,’’ as 
I like to call them, is watching. Com-
munist China, Iran, and North Korea 
are all watching the chaos here in 
Washington play out with great inter-
est, and, if the past few weeks have 
taught us anything, so is their counter-
part in the ‘‘axis of evil’’—Russia. 
On Sunday, we saw a flood of so- 
called strong signals coming from the 
G7 following a meeting to discuss Rus-
sia’s aggression toward Ukraine. Now, I 
don’t discount the importance of these 
statements—I do hope Vladimir Putin 
heard us loud and clear—but I also 
know that statements mean nothing 
unless they come from a position of 
strength and unless they are accom-
panied by action, and right now, that is 
not what the Biden administration is 
projecting or doing. 
President Biden’s refusal to lead by 
example is putting us in danger, and it 
is putting our partners in Kiev in dan-
ger. His administration has spent the

past year throwing policy spaghetti 
against the wall, trying to get some-
thing to stick. The American people, of 
course, aren’t interested in what he has 
to offer. Nevertheless, he persists, piv-
oting when he needs to recapture the 
mainstream media’s attention. 
Meanwhile, over in Russia, Putin is 
enjoying every single minute of this. 
He is probably laughing. He knows he 
can be as belligerent as he pleases be-
cause his most powerful and lethal ad-
versary is totally distracted. 
Today, I sent a letter to the White 
House, asking them to clarify the spin 
they have been putting out on our pos-
ture concerning Ukraine. Here is the 
problem I am trying to get to the bot-
tom of. 
On December 9, the Associated Press 
reported on a diplomatic phone call be-
tween Biden and the Ukrainian Presi-
dent. During the call, the White House 
allegedly made it clear that we support 
Ukrainian sovereignty. That is good. 
However, that report also revealed a 
supposed plan, concocted by the White 
House, to persuade Ukraine to cede ter-
ritory—cede their territory—to Russia 
because it is currently controlled by 
Russian separatists. White House Press 
Secretary Jen Psaki has denied the lat-
ter. I still have some questions about 
what is going on behind the scenes. 
History tells us that autocrats and 
thugs like Putin find their greatest 
power in the weaknesses of their adver-
saries. That is right. When they see 
weakness, they pounce. Strength is the 
only thing that deters them. 
Have my colleagues across the aisle 
ever 
heard 
of 
‘‘peace 
through 
strength’’? Have they looked at that as 
a policy? 
President Biden must summon the 
strength 
to 
stop 
playing 
political 
games for the cameras and confront 
this direct challenge to Ukraine’s sov-
ereignty. My Democratic colleagues 
must join him. This will require more 
than strong words. It does require ac-
tion. 
This year’s yet-to-be-passed NDAA 
authorizes $75 million in lethal assist-
ance to Ukraine. It is time to pass this 
bill. 
And I would add, that the fiscal year 
2022 NDAA is the most bipartisan thing 
that has come out of the Senate all 
year. 
It is a no-brainer. Let’s get this done 
and not just for Ukraine, but also the 
future of Western Europe. That is also 
at stake. 
The Biden administration must stand 
firm and reimpose meaningful sanc-
tions on Nord Stream 2. This one pipe-
line will double the total capacity of 
Russian gas exports and hand even 
more economic leverage to the Krem-
lin. Why would we want to do that? 
Ukraine, on the other hand, will lose 
an estimated $3 billion each year in 
transit fees. 
Putin is weaponizing energy in Eu-
rope. Our partners in Ukraine are liv-
ing under the constant threat of inva-
sion, and the Biden administration is 
just sitting there and letting it happen. 
So here we are, at the eleventh hour, 
Christmas is coming, and we are still 
waiting for Biden and the Democrats to 
do the job the American people elected 
them to do. 
They have squandered an entire year 
trying to conjure up support for their 
disastrous socialist agenda. We are 
never going to get this time back, and 
the American people who are suffering 
are not going to get this year back. 
But now is not the moment to just 
let things go. We can’t afford weakness 
and spin, not when it comes to the 
economy, not when it comes to foreign 
policy, and certainly not when it comes 
to proving to the American people that 
there is someone in Washington watch-
ing out for them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I be per-
mitted to speak for up to 15 minutes, 
Senator TUBERVILLE for up to 10 min-
utes, and Senator PADILLA for up to 10 
minutes prior to the scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
TORNADO 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon to talk 
about my friend Bob Dole, who was laid 
to rest last week. Before I do that, I 
want to just take a moment to express 
our heartfelt thoughts and sorrow at 
the loss of so many lives in more than 
a half dozen States, including Ken-
tucky, where my sister and her family 
live; including Arkansas, where other 
friends live. 
We just want the folks to know who 
are going through a really tough time 
and tough patch, that when we talk a 
lot about you are in our thoughts and 
our prayers, that you literally are, and 
it is not just words that we are saying. 
We hope and promise we will be there 
to help you going forward as you deal 
with all of this. 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. DOLE 
Madam President, having said that, I 
just want to talk a bit about Bob Dole, 
as our Nation continues to mourn his 
loss and celebrate the life of one of the 
greatest of the ‘‘greatest generation.’’ I 
rise today to add to the countless trib-
utes benefiting the late, great Senator 
from Kansas, Bob Dole. 
Born Robert Joseph Dole on July 22, 
1922, in Russell, KS, Bob Dole grew up 
during a period known as the Dust 
Bowl in the American heartland, where 
his family, like so many others, strug-
gled to pay rent and put food on their 
table. 
Bob Dole was the star athlete in high 
school who wanted to pursue a career 
in medicine. He began his studies at 
the University of Kansas, but like 
many young Americans at the time, in-
cluding my dad and uncles from West 
Virginia, like them, his plans were in-
terrupted by the attack on Pearl Har-
bor and Hitler’s army marching across 
Europe. 
Bob Dole enlisted in the Army Re-
serve and was called up to Active Duty 
in 1943. Two years later, at the age of 
21, as part of the 10th Mountain Divi-
sion, Bob Dole was severely injured on 
the battlefield in Italy after bravely 
pulling a fellow soldier to safety. He 
sustained grave injuries to his spine, to 
his shoulder, to one of his hands, and 
by all accounts was left for dead on the 
battlefield. But Bob Dole, like the 
United States and our allies, didn’t 
give up. He persevered. 
Despite long odds of recovery, Bob 
never gave up and wouldn’t take no for 
an answer. He spent 39 months—let me 
repeat that. He spent 39 months recov-
ering in a hospital bed undergoing nu-
merous surgeries. When doctors told 
him that he was partially paralyzed, he 
built a device—he built a device—to 
help him regain his strength and was 
able not only to stand upright but 
eventually to walk again and to run for 
office many, many times. 
Bob Dole knew he was lucky to make 
it home. And the decades he spent in 
public service after sustaining his inju-
ries, he dedicated much of his life to 
ensuring that our veterans, especially 
our fallen veterans during World War 
II, like my Uncle Bob, were honored 
and remembered for their sacrifices. 
My Uncle Bob was my mom’s young-
est brother, one of those sailors who 
wasn’t lucky enough to make it home. 
He died at the age of 19 in 1944 during 
a kamikaze attack in the Western Pa-
cific on his aircraft carrier, the USS 
Suwannee. His body was never recov-
ered. But his memory lives on, thanks 
in no small part to Senator Bob Dole’s 
work to establish the World War II Me-
morial on the National Mall. And for 
that, my family, the Patton family on 
my mother’s side, are forever grateful. 
Though they never met, Bob Dole, 
like so many Americans of the ‘‘great-
est generation,’’ understood that my 
Uncle Bob made the ultimate sacrifice 
in defense of our Nation and for the 
preservation of our democracy. That is 
why Senator Bob Dole spent so much of 
his time raising money for the World 
War II Memorial and why he spent so 
many Saturdays there, greeting vet-
erans and thanking them for their 
service. This meant the world to those 
families, like mine, who lost a loved 
one during the war. 
When Bob Dole was finally able to 
stand on his own two feet again, the 
town of Russell, KS, rallied around him 
and encouraged him to run for office. 
And he did. 
After a short stint in local Kansas 
politics, Bob served in the U.S. House 
of Representatives for four terms be-
fore being elected to the Senate in 1968, 
the same year I was commissioned an 
ensign in the Navy. 
For 35 years, Bob Dole proudly served 
the people of Kansas in Washington— 
here. His time in Congress, especially 
as a Senator, is really where his legacy 
and public service started to take

shape. He was a proud Republican who 
ran three times for his party’s nomina-
tion for the Presidency. But I believe 
that Bob Dole will be remembered most 
fondly for his ability to find common 
ground. 
I believe he said it best himself. He 
said: 
When we prioritize principles over party 
and humanity over personal legacy, we ac-
complish far more as a nation. 
I will read that again. This is worth 
repeating. 
When we prioritize principles over party 
and humanity over personal legacy, we ac-
complish far more as a nation. 
He was right. We can accomplish far 
more when we work together as one 
Nation rather than as Members of dif-
ferent political parties. 
Bob himself said his proudest polit-
ical accomplishments were passing the 
bipartisan Americans with Disabilities 
Act and working to find a principled 
compromise to save Social Security—a 
compromise that I was privileged to 
support as a newly elected freshman in 
the House of Representatives in 1983. 
I believe Bob Dole embodied the ad-
monition of Matthew 25 to care for the 
‘‘least of these’’ among us. He worked 
alongside the South Dakota Senator 
George McGovern, a liberal Democrat, 
who also ran for President, to improve 
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program, formerly known as the Fed-
eral Food Stamp Program, to ensure 
that struggling families could feed 
themselves and their children. 
Bob Dole took Matthew 25—and Mat-
thew 25 goes something like this: ‘‘For 
I was hungry, and you gave me some-
thing to eat’’—and he turned it into 
the law that, to this day, helps lift 
Americans out of poverty and on to 
longer, healthier lives because, ulti-
mately, Bob followed his moral com-
pass, even when it wasn’t politically 
convenient. He wasn’t afraid to buck 
his party when he felt doing so was the 
right thing to do. 
He was a fiscal conservative, but he 
supported tax reforms to raise revenue. 
He also supported—get this. He also 
supported the passage of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965—landmark civil 
rights bills that sought to eliminate 
racial discrimination from our laws 
and sought to ensure equal access to 
the ballot box for all Americans. 
These 
accomplishments 
required 
hard-fought—hard-fought—negotia-
tions and courageous votes. But Bob 
Dole never let that interfere with his 
commitment to doing what was right 
and, I might add, an incredible sense of 
humor. 
When 
Bob’s 
wonderful 
wife—our 
former colleague here in the Senate, 
Elizabeth Dole—was in front of the 
Senate Labor Committee in 1989, hav-
ing been nominated by then-President 
George Herbert Walker Bush, Bob ac-
companied her to her confirmation 
hearing and introduced her there as 
many of us introduce our own constitu-
ents when they are nominated for a 
particular position by a President. One 
of the things that he said, as he sat 
there next to his wife Elizabeth, he 
quipped—and he was great for quips— 
to his colleagues: ‘‘I regret that I have 
but one wife to give for my country.’’ 
I regret that I have but one wife to 
give for my country. 
And following his defeat in the 1988 
Republican Presidential primary, he 
opened his remarks by saying: Not only 
do ‘‘I regret that I have but one wife to 
give to my country,’’ he wanted to add: 
‘‘If I had this much coverage in [my] 
primary, I would be writing my inau-
gural address.’’ He then continued to 
say: 
I once dreamed of making a name for my-
self in Washington, but I never thought it 
would be as the husband of the Secretary of 
Labor, but I’ll take what comes these days. 
The truth is, as much as Bob Dole 
probably learned while serving here in 
the Senate, the Senate could learn a 
lot more from the life and example of 
Bob Dole. And we could use more Bob 
Doles in this body today, on both sides 
of the aisle. 
While Bob Dole was a serious man, he 
didn’t take himself too seriously. He 
didn’t care for politicians who divided 
us just for the sake of division. He also 
didn’t care for big egos of folks who 
wanted to do something just so they 
could take credit for it. 
He believed the words of Abraham 
Lincoln, one of his personal heroes, 
that ours is a ‘‘government of the peo-
ple, by the people, [and] for the peo-
ple.’’ That is why he fought and nearly 
gave his life in defense of our Nation 
and our democracy. That is why he 
continued to serve our Nation also, al-
ways striving to improve the lives of 
Kansas and all of us. 
We owe it to Senator Dole, to my 
Uncle Bob, and to the entire ‘‘greatest 
generation’’ who fought and made the 
ultimate sacrifice for us to live in a 
free and democratic country, to uphold 
the ideals of our democracy, and to 
work together to create a brighter, bet-
ter tomorrow for our children and our 
grandchildren. 
So as we mourn the passing of Bob 
Dole, I would challenge all of us to 
prioritize principles over party and hu-
manity over personal legacy. We can 
all work better together to address the 
challenges of today and confront the 
challenges of tomorrow. 
(Mr. HEINRICH assumed the Chair.) 
Mr. President, some of us may recall 
the famous film, ‘‘The Wizard of Oz.’’ It 
took place in Bob Dole’s proud home 
State of Kansas. Throughout the film, 
Dorothy is reminded that ‘‘there is no 
place like home, no place like home.’’ 
Well, Senator Dole entered these Halls 
one last time last week to lie in state 
in the Capitol Rotunda, just down the 
hall over my right shoulder. And I, like 
many of our colleagues, had the chance 
to pay our respects to a man of integ-
rity, passion, and wit. 
Now, it is time to send Bob home 
back to Russell, KS, as we have, one 
last time because there is truly no 
place like home. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, I like 
to—if we are not in session when some-
body has a birthday, one of my col-
leagues has a birthday, I call them. I 
track them down or send them a text 
message. And I have done that with 
Elizabeth Dole, who served in this 
Chamber with us in more recent years, 
and I still call her on her birthday. 
And her birthday is July 29. I called 
her on July 29 this year to wish her a 
happy birthday and to see how she and 
Bob were doing. I got to talk with him 
as well as with her, and they both said 
to me—they said, ‘‘Why don’t you and 
Martha’’—my 
wife 
Martha—‘‘come 
down here sometime when we have 
some free time and you do as well, and 
we will just go out for dinner to-
gether.’’ 
Sadly, we never got to do that. But 
we are going to take a raincheck. And 
I promise you, if you are listening out 
there, Bob, we plan to take full advan-
tage of that raincheck and come and 
see you, with Elizabeth. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I 
would like to add on to what the other 
Senators have said. We want to give 
our blessings and prayers to the people 
in the southern part of the country 
after all the tornadoes. 
I grew up in Arkansas and now live in 
Alabama, and there hasn’t been a year 
gone by that we didn’t have devastated 
communities, towns, cities across the 
South. It seems like it is an every-year 
occurrence. There has been many peo-
ple lost, many people injured. 
The TV trucks and newspeople will 
leave in the next couple of days, leav-
ing the destruction behind for the peo-
ple of these cities and towns to rebuild, 
and it is a tough time. It is going to be 
a tough time all around, not just for a 
few days but for years. And our prayers 
go out to them and all the families 
that have to go through one of the 
toughest times of their life. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. President, on the list of people 
that my Democratic colleagues are 
claiming to help on this Build Back 
Better Act, there is a huge blank. 
I worked in education all my life. I 
worked around people all my life. What 
is missing from this list is American 
families, American families all over 
this 
country. 
For 
example, 
the 
childcare program in this tax-and- 
spend spree is really about only helping 
certain families. And that is fine—cer-
tain families—but we should help all 
families. 
But my colleagues want to help the 
ones that are structured toward the 
Democrats that they deem favorable, 
and that is not the American way. If 
you are in a two-parent, working 
household, my colleagues’ plan would 
cost Mom and Dad thousands more 
each year to pay for their child’s care. 
Think about that: thousands more. And 
this means tax many and give to a few. 
Well, that is not what we do here.

Additionally, a once bipartisan ini-
tiative, the child tax credit, is being re-
worked. The cost of that dramatic ex-
pansion will be paid for by joint filers; 
meaning, in other words, couples—our 
families—will pay the cost. 
I want to take a moment to contrast 
this attack on the family. It is an at-
tack on the family approach with ac-
tual American families around the 
country are facing as we speak. This 
anti-family bill is not only coming at a 
time when families have to pay more 
for groceries and pay more for gas and 
higher prices at the gas pump but also 
when families are silently fighting 
other unnamed pandemic and prob-
lems. Those are the worsening prob-
lems of mental health and drug addic-
tion issues in our country today, of 
which they are abundant. 
So I ask my colleagues: Why this 
bill? It doesn’t build families back bet-
ter. It builds them back broke. It helps 
a few, not all. It doesn’t create jobs or 
support working families. It creates 
more reliance on Big Government so-
cialism. And why now, when inflation 
is so high and when so many of our 
friends and families are struggling to 
find the help that they need? 
It goes without saying that the 
COVID pandemic has played and is 
playing a large role in the staggering 
rise in drug overdoses and increase in 
mental health crises and homelessness 
over the past couple of years. Ameri-
cans were locked down unnecessarily 
long periods of time. Jobs were lost. 
And the economic engine of our Nation 
was brought to a screeching halt. 
Children lost out on valuable edu-
cation 
opportunities 
and 
wondered 
when they were going to be able to see 
their friends again. Students’ college 
experiences were forever changed, and 
working parents had to juggle school-
ing and full-time childcare in addition 
to holding down their own jobs. 
Throughout 
this 
turbulent 
time, 
Americans felt lonelier and more de-
tached than ever before, especially in 
my lifetime. 
It is a dream too often turned into a 
nightmare for an increasing number of 
Americans, a promising future robbed 
by deadly drug addiction. And sadly, it 
is more common now than ever before. 
According to the latest data from the 
National Center for Health Statistics, 
we lost over 100,000 American lives due 
to drug overdoses from April 2020 to 
April 2021. That is not including the 
last 8 months. 
This is an increase of 30 percent from 
the year before. Think of all the open 
seats that will be at the dinner table 
for Christmas lunch or dinner, the fu-
tures that will never be fully realized, 
the families forever mourning the loss 
of a loved one. It is happening every 
day. 
We have these known issues made 
worse by a pandemic; there is no doubt. 
Yet Democrats’ response has been to 
open our borders and allow cartels to 
profit off of trafficking fentanyl and 
other deadly substances into our coun-
try. It is hard to imagine. 
Through the first 9 months of this 
year, the monthly average of fentanyl 
seized was 830 pounds—a month, 830 
pounds. Compare that to a monthly av-
erage of 321 pounds from 2018 to 2020. 
Now, that is way too many—but 830 
pounds a month. Two thousand pounds 
can kill 200 million people—200 million. 
That is three-fourths of the people in 
this country. 
Instead, we need to look at how we 
can address mental health and break 
the cycle of drug addiction and home-
lessness. That should be a priority in 
this building. There are solutions out 
there if we approach the problem the 
right way. It is clear that the money 
we are spending and the programs that 
we have in place are not working. 
We need to open our eyes. We should 
be strengthening the family. We know 
strong families are the backbone of a 
strong community, and right now, 
Democrats are too focused on sneaking 
in these progressive wish list items— 
like climate policy and taxes that put 
us on par with communist countries— 
into a bill under the guise that it will 
help all Americans. I am here to help 
Americans 
but 
the 
right 
way—all 
Americans. 
Last year, Congress got to work on 
passing bills to help with COVID relief. 
While some relief funds were certainly 
necessary for those who needed it the 
most, the government’s role quickly 
went from providing targeted stimulus 
to 
unchecked 
spending 
month 
by 
month. And this year, my Democratic 
colleagues assumed a predictable re-
sponse to every problem they faced: 
Just throw money at it. 
Folks, money is not the answer. Peo-
ple are the answer. And the money 
they want to use will be paid for, yes, 
by the American people. It is not gov-
ernment money. It is the American 
people, and it is the taxpayers’ money. 
But pumping more money into the 
economy is not the solution. It did not 
work for American families earlier this 
year when was passed a $1.9 trillion 
spending package that was passed off 
as COVID relief. It caused prices to rise 
and inflation to spike. It didn’t address 
most of the issues families still face 
today. 
We spent all this money, and we have 
got worse problems. We throw money 
around in the name of solving prob-
lems. And if we do it this time, it won’t 
work this time either. We are putting 
the country more in debt, and we are 
making problems worse. People are 
starting to figure it out. 
You know, as a football coach for 40 
years, I know a little bit about strat-
egy. I was a defensive guy. I like strat-
egy. That is part of playing defense. 
A good defensive player must make a 
decision based on what is learned in 
practice and what their experience 
tells them, then they have the con-
fidence to commit to that decision. But 
the key to winning the matchup is to 
always watch where the ball is if you 
are on defense. We always taught our 
players to play the game with your 
eyes. If you go to any practice, you will 
hear this: Defensive players, play with 
your eyes and trust your eyes. 
Offenses will throw motion across 
formation. They will run a trick play. 
They try to get your eye off the ball. 
You have the chance to go out there 
and stop the play if you trust your 
eyes. 
The same thing is happening right 
now. We are playing defense, and we 
cannot take our eye off—not the ball, 
but this bill. We have got to trust our 
eyes. The American people have to 
trust their eyes. Democratic colleagues 
are trying all sorts of tricks and polit-
ical spin to convince Americans that 
their Build Back Better bill is a cham-
pionship-caliber win. They are banking 
on Americans to be too busy and be too 
caught up in the holidays to under-
stand what is really in this bill. 
But here is the thing: Americans 
should know that the Democrats’ reck-
less tax-and-spend spree is nothing 
more than a gimmick, a trick play de-
signed to fool the defense or the Amer-
ican people, to help a few, not every-
body. 
The American people should trust 
their eyes. This bill is not thoughtful 
policy that will change American lives. 
It is a way to increase Big Government 
socialism and pay for it by increasing 
taxes on not a few in the 1 percent, but 
everybody in this country. 
Because of the way they are doing 
this bill, using an obscure procedural 
tool that is called reconciliation, ev-
erything in this bill has to be budg-
etary, as in related to the budget. 
Sometimes, this is useful, when you 
are trying to create a fairer, simpler 
Tax Code or make tax cuts. It is also a 
tool used to bypass the majority be-
cause it only needs 51 votes. 
But the reconciliation process actu-
ally limits what Congress can do to ad-
dress most issues facing Americans be-
cause everything in this bill has to be 
budget related. Reconciliation does not 
allow Congress to thoughtfully con-
struct policy or to make improvements 
that do not spend money. Throwing 
money at existing programs or even 
creating new programs that simply 
send out checks is not the same as 
making meaningful change. 
So when my Democratic colleagues 
say that their bill will help Americans, 
it will—a few—but not very many. All 
it does is throw money at problems, 
which is, as we have seen, not what our 
country needs. This reckless tax-and- 
spend spree creates a cradle-to-grave 
entitlement society but does not actu-
ally help people in that society. 
If we really wanted to help American 
families, we would start with a bipar-
tisan effort, meaning that we would 
discuss the needs of all Americans, not 
just a few. In this very tough time, all 
citizens need help. Everybody needs 
help. It has been a tough time. It has 
been a tough couple of years. But this 
has just been a one-way street. 
We have folks who represent urban 
and rural areas, talking with each

other about what American families 
actually need and what actually works. 
We could create targeted, thoughtful 
bills that didn’t rely on budget gim-
micks or party lines to pass. 
So we can’t let our Democratic col-
leagues fool Americans. Their Build 
Back Better bill isn’t making Amer-
ican families better. It is not helping 
Americans who are suffering from men-
tal health issues. It is not helping our 
country’s drug addiction problems. It 
is an anti-family bill that will make 
our country more dependent on Big 
Government, and it is spending money 
the wrong way. 
I yield the floor. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak on three highly quali-
fied judicial nominees: Judge Lucy 
Koh, nominated to the Ninth Circuit; 
Jennifer Sung, also nominated to the 
Ninth Circuit; and Samantha Elliott, 
nominated to the District of New 
Hampshire. 
These nominees will bring much- 
needed professional and demographic 
diversity to the bench. They have the 
qualifications and character needed to 
serve effectively in the Judiciary. And 
all three have records that dem-
onstrate an evenhanded and unbiased 
approach to the law. 
Judge Lucy Koh has served as a dis-
trict court judge for the Northern Dis-
trict of California for more than a dec-
ade. When President Obama nominated 
her to that role in 2010, she was con-
firmed in the Senate with broad, bipar-
tisan support, a 90–0 margin. That 
unanimous 
support 
reflected 
Judge 
Koh’s abilities and experience and also 
a deep sense of trust that that she 
would be ready to take on the demands 
of the Federal district court from day 
1. 
Well, Judge Koh has certainly risen 
to the occasion. As a district court 
judge, she has issued thousands of writ-
ten opinions. And she has presided over 
271 trials. Notably, Judge Koh has 
grappled 
with 
many 
complex—and 
often novel—questions of law, particu-
larly those related to technology. 
These are the kinds of questions that 
regularly make their way to the circuit 
courts. So we know that Judge Koh is 
already wellversed in the types of cases 
she will encounter on the Ninth Cir-
cuit. 
What is more, during her time on the 
bench, Judge Koh has exemplified the 
hallmarks of what makes an out-
standing 
judge, 
She 
engages 
in 
thoughtful, well-reasoned analysis; fol-
lows precedent, irrespective of whether 
she agrees with it; and always—al-
ways—applies the law to the facts in an 
evenhanded, impartial way. 
Judge Koh was rated unanimously 
‘‘well qualified’’ by the American Bar 
Association to serve on the circuit 
court. And upon confirmation, she will 
be the first Korean-American woman 
to ever serve on a circuit court. 
Judge Koh received a bipartisan vote 
in the Judiciary Committee, and I hope 
she receives bipartisan support here on 
the floor. 
The Senate will also be voting on 
Jennifer Sung’s nomination to the 
Ninth Circuit. Ms. Sung is a distin-
guished jurist who will bring a vital, 
and underrepresented, perspective to 
the Federal bench. 
After graduating from Yale Law 
School and clerking on the Ninth Cir-
cuit, Ms. Sung spent over a decade rep-
resenting American workers in labor 
disputes. These workers were often mi-
norities from low-income backgrounds. 
In 2017, Ms. Sung’s expertise in labor 
law attracted the attention of Oregon 
Governor Kate Brown, who appointed 
her to serve on the Oregon Employ-
ment Relations Board. 
The ERB, as it is called, is a quasi-ju-
dicial agency charged with resolving 
labor disputes. As a member of the 
three-person panel, Ms. Sung reviews 
evidentiary 
records, 
independently 
evaluates the law, and works in a col-
laborative manner to reach a consensus 
on opinions. In other words, she has al-
ready handled many of the responsibil-
ities that come with being a Circuit 
Court Judge. So Ms. Sung will be right 
at home on the Ninth Circuit. 
In addition to the professional diver-
sity Ms. Sung will bring to the bench 
as an expert in labor law, she will also 
bring important demographic diver-
sity. If confirmed, she would make his-
tory 
as 
the 
first 
Asian-American 
woman to hold an Oregon seat on the 
Ninth Circuit. 
Ms. Sung has presided over hundreds 
of legal matters—only three of which 
have been overturned. She has dem-
onstrated a commitment to impar-
tiality, a thoughtful approach to deci-
sion-making, and a keen ability to sep-
arate her personal views from the law 
and the facts at hand. That is also re-
flected by the fact that the American 
Bar Association rated Ms. Sung as 
‘‘well qualified.’’ 
Finally, the Senate will soon take up 
Samantha Elliott’s nomination to the 
District of New Hampshire. Ms. Elliott 
has spent her entire legal career in 
New Hampshire. With her deep knowl-
edge of the State’s legal system and 
her evenhanded approach to the law, 
she will make an outstanding Federal 
judge. 
Ms. Elliott is an accomplished liti-
gator who has spent much of her career 
representing New Hampshire munici-
palities and their employees. She has 
also dedicated herself to increasing ac-
cess to justice. As a co founder of 603 
Legal Aid, Ms. Elliott has worked tire-
lessly to provide legal services to mem-
bers of low-income communities. And 
she has dedicated countless hours to 
her pro bono legal work. 
With her considerable experience in 
both State and Federal courts, it is lit-
tle surprise that Ms. Elliott was unani-
mously rated as ‘‘well qualified’’ by the 
American Bar Association. She also re-
ceived a bipartisan vote of 15-7 in the 
Judiciary Committee. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in supporting these three highly quali-
fied nominees. With their breadth of 
credentials, experience, and commit-
ment to the rule of law, each of them 
will make outstanding additions to the 
Federal bench. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
NOMINATION OF LUCY HAERAN KOH 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the nomination of 
Judge Lucy Koh to the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
Judge Koh is an outstanding legal 
thinker and a trailblazing public serv-
ant. Her commitment to equal justice 
for all has earned her support on both 
sides of the aisle. From her first judi-
cial appointment by former California 
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to 
her unanimous Senate confirmation to 
serve as a Federal district judge in 
California, to her strong bipartisan ad-
vancement recently from the Senate 
Judiciary Committee for this appoint-
ment, Judge Koh has a reputation for 
excellence that stretches far and wide. 
She built this reputation over the 
course of a stellar legal career that 
started right here in this Senate, as a 
women’s law and public policy fellow 
with the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
She then spent 7 years with the U.S. 
Department of Justice, earning numer-
ous accolades for her work, including 
an FBI award for excellence in pros-
ecuting major fraud. 
From the Department of Justice, 
Judge Koh made her way to Cali-
fornia—to Silicon Valley, specifically— 
where she made a name for herself as 
an expert litigator on intellectual 
property cases. 
In 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger, as 
I mentioned, appointed her to the Cali-
fornia Superior Court. Just 2 years 
later, 
President 
Obama 
nominated 
Judge Koh to the Federal District 
Court bench, and she was confirmed 
unanimously by this Senate. And in 
the decade since, Judge Koh has gone 
on to distinguish herself as a jurist. 
She is well known, not only in her dis-
trict but across the country as tal-
ented, thoughtful, smart, and fair. 
This nomination is actually her sec-
ond nomination to the Ninth Circuit. 
In 2016, she was nominated and ad-
vanced out of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee at that time on a bipar-
tisan basis but, unfortunately, never 
received a floor vote in this Senate. 
But now that we have this vote 
scheduled, I hope that my colleagues 
will join me in voting to confirm Judge 
Koh on a strong bipartisan vote once 
again. I know the people of California, 
the Ninth Circuit, and the country at 
large will benefit from her dedication, 
her integrity, and compassion as a cir-
cuit court judge. 
In many ways, the story that Judge 
Koh brings to the bench is the epitome 
of the American Dream. The daughter 
of Korean immigrants who fled com-
munism and dictatorship in search of a 
better life, Judge Koh was born in 
Washington, DC, and raised in Vicks-
burg, MI. And growing up, Judge Koh

studied at public schools and was no 
stranger to poverty and discrimina-
tion. 
She spent weekends and summers 
working in her father’s small business, 
and she was surrounded by the love and 
lessons of her immigrant family. Now, 
these experiences all helped to shape 
the unique and needed perspectives 
that she now brings as a Federal judge. 
If confirmed, Judge Koh will become 
the first Korean-American woman to 
serve on a Federal circuit court. 
Now, as the first Latino to represent 
California here in this Senate, I know 
the importance of diversity at all lev-
els of government, and that includes 
the judiciary. Our country is stronger 
and fairer when we are guided by the 
voices and experiences of all of our peo-
ple. And we still have a lot of work to 
remake our justice system to better re-
flect the country that it serves. 
Based on Judge Koh’s record, her 
skill, intellect, and respect for the rule 
of law, her confirmation is a big step in 
helping us achieve that goal. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting to confirm her to the Ninth Cir-
cuit. 
I yield the floor.

The Senator from Rhode Island. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here on the floor to ask for some 
courtesy for a pair of nominees. These 
are nominees to the Court of Federal 
Claims, which is the court to which 
citizens can come with claims against 
the Federal Government. 
In the Court of Federal Claims, the 
Federal Government is the defendant, 
and these two individuals are in an 
enormous traffic jam that our col-
leagues have created for nominees. At 
the moment, I am told we have 159 
nominees, out of committee, on the Ex-
ecutive Calendar, backed up on the 
Senate floor—159. 
I am on the Judiciary Committee. 
These two are judges. They are for the 
Court of Federal Claims. This is not a 
partisan thing; this is about letting the 
Court of Federal Claims do its work. 
Both of them are extremely well 
qualified; neither is partisan. Both 
were voice voted out of the Judiciary 
Committee, and I would hope, just as a 
matter of courtesy and common de-
cency, we could agree tonight to move 
them forward. 
Now, one of them is named Armando 
Bonilla. He served as the counsel to the 
Marshals Service. He served as counsel 
to the Deputy Attorney General. 
He served, actually, as Associate 
Deputy Attorney General. In the De-
partment of Justice it is not an easy 
thing to move up from being counsel to 
the Marshals Service to being counsel 
to the DAG, to being Associate DAG. 
So that is a pretty impressive record. 
Before that, as a trial attorney, he 
had served in the Public Integrity Sec-
tion of the Department, in the asset 
forfeiture and money laundering sec-
tion, bringing those cases, and in the 
civil side in the Commercial Litigation 
Division. 
So he has the trial qualifications you 
would want. He has the experience 
from the government side that you 
would want. He got a voice vote out of 
committee. And if that is not enough, 
he is a graduate from West Virginia 
University. 
So he is, I think, a very well-rounded 
individual who would serve well in the 
Court of Federal Claims. 
Also, I will be asking to confirm 
Carolyn Lerner, who brings her own su-
perb qualifications to this position as 
well. She is, right now, the chief cir-
cuit mediator for the Court of Appeals 
for the DC Circuit. So she deals with 
litigation conflicts all the time. She 
obviously is viewed with considerable 
regard by the court who made her their 
chief circuit mediator. 
She served for many years in private 
practice. So she would be very familiar 
with the private practice of individuals 
who come before the Court of Federal 
Claims. Again, private person versus 
Federal 
Government 
is 
what 
that 
court’s business is. And she even 
taught law. 
So Carolyn Lerner and Armando 
Bonilla are both very well qualified, 
and both came out of the Judiciary 
Committee with voice votes, which 
means they both had bipartisan sup-
port, and this is an important court to 
proceed with. 
Now, what has happened here and the 
reason we are now up to 159 backed-up 
nominees for executive and judicial po-
sitions is that our colleagues on the 
other side are insisting on cloture for 
essentially almost every individual 
who comes through, and that eats up 
time on the Senate floor and slows 
things down and creates a traffic jam. 
It is like you are driving on Highway 95 
and you pull into the middle lane and 
drive 25 miles an hour. You are going 
to jam up traffic behind you. And that 
is what our friends are doing. They are 
jamming up traffic. 
I think there are certain Members of 
the other party who would like to see 
the Biden administration not be able to 
get his team in place just for partisan 
reasons. 
So when Donald Trump came in, in 
his first year, he was obviously not 
popular with us on our side, and he had 
some pretty appalling appointments. 
But even in that very hostile environ-
ment, the Republican leader only had 
to file cloture for 65 appointees—65 in 
that first year. In President Biden’s 
year, we are already at 127. So the clo-
ture rate has doubled from even that 
very difficult, challenging year when 
Trump first came in. 
And I see my friend from Alaska 
here. So I will just review the bidding. 
We have 159 nominees backed up on the 
Senate floor who are all out of com-
mittee, all ready for votes, many of 
whom are coming out of committee by 
voice votes with big bipartisan majori-
ties. Two of them are the individuals 
whom I am going to be asking unani-
mous 
consent 
to 
confirm 
tonight, 
Armando Bonilla and Carolyn Lerner.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9116 
December 13, 2021 
My friend from Alaska served in the 
Department of Justice. So he knows 
that it ain’t nothing to be counsel to 
the Marshals Service and then counsel 
for the DAG and then Associate DAG. 
That is a really impressive climb 
through the top ranks of the Depart-
ment—and to have served as a trial at-
torney in the Public Integrity Section 
and in the asset forfeiture and money 
laundering section and in the civil side 
in complex commercial litigation. That 
is a very impressive resume. 
That is ditto for Ms. Lerner, who has 
been chosen to be the chief circuit me-
diator for the DC Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. That is a pretty impressive cre-
dential all on its own. 
So what I would like to do in order to 
get these two through the traffic jam 
and on to the Court of Federal Claims, 
where their presence is needed, is to 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to executive session to con-
sider their nominations, which are Ex-
ecutive Calendar Nos. 489 and 490; and, 
further, that the nominations be con-
firmed, that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nominations; that any re-
lated statements be printed in the 
RECORD; that the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action; 
and that the Senate then resume legis-
lative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Reserving the right 
to object, Mr. President, I work very 
closely with my colleague from Rhode 
Island on many, many issues, and there 
is a pretty simple solution for my ob-
jection here, and it is related to judges, 
and it is related to the Senate working 
with the White House to get judges 
confirmed. 
I gave a speech on the Senate floor 
just about an hour ago, talking about a 
remarkable breach of Senate protocol, 
where the White House won’t let cer-
tain Senators from the Court of Ap-
peals of the Ninth Circuit States to 
meet with the nominees for the Court 
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
That is an outrage. In my entire time 
in the U.S. Senate, every time I have 
requested to meet with a judge who is 
going for confirmation to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 
I have had the opportunity to meet 
with that judge, and it is really impor-
tant. 
I am not going to repeat the argu-
ment I made just an hour ago, but 
there is a simple solution here: We get 
to meet with the nominees whom we 
are debating on the Senate floor this 
week, and I certainly will lift the ob-
jection that I am about to make on 
these two nominees for the Court of 
Federal Claims. 
But I do want to just push back on 
my good friend from Rhode Island a lit-
tle bit. My colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle forced votes on the Court of 
Federal Claims nominees during the 
Trump administration, including Judge 
Solomon, who literally wrote the book 
on the Court of Federal Claims. 
So here is the thing. What often hap-
pens in the Senate is that what goes 
around comes around. But what hap-
pened today, when I was requesting 
what I have always been requesting— 
what my constituents in Alaska expect 
me to do is to interview, meet, discuss 
issues with the judge who is going to 
get life tenure, who is going to have 
enormous power over my constitu-
ents—Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
judges. 
I don’t know anybody who has heard 
this—that the White House Counsel 
says: No, you are a Senator doing ad-
vice and consent, a constitutional 
duty, and we are forbidding you to 
meet with a judge going through the 
confirmation process who is going to 
have enormous power over your con-
stituents. That is unheard of since I 
have been here. And, by the way, I 
talked to the Trump administration’s 
White House Counsel, and they said 
they never did that. 
But here is the point. This could be 
easily solved. I am sure Mr. Bonilla and 
Ms. Lerner are qualified. All I need is a 
call from the White House Counsel’s of-
fice saying: You know what, Senator, 
you can meet with the nominees for 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. We are going to let you do 
your constitutional duty. 
Well, thank you—pretty simple. 
And I think working closely with my 
colleague from Rhode Island, as I have 
done throughout my career—and he is 
on the Judiciary Committee. So maybe 
he can help convince the White House 
to take a bit of a different stand when 
a Senator wants to meet with a judge 
who is going to have enormous power 
over his constituents and have lifetime 
tenure. And they can’t take an hour 
out of their time? Heck, in my speech 
just an hour ago, I put out my office’s 
phone number and said to these judges: 
Look, you don’t have to have permis-
sion from the White House Counsel. 
Just call me. Let’s have a discussion. 
I am trying to do my constitutional 
duty here. 
So with that, Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. In the spirit of 
‘‘what goes around comes around,’’ let 
me just say that the First Circuit is a 
good deal smaller than the Ninth Cir-
cuit. My State of Rhode Island is in the 
First Circuit. We didn’t have many va-
cancies during the Trump administra-
tion on the First Circuit, and the only 
one we had was not filled. 
But I am not aware of any Member 
on our side being offered to meet with 
any Trump judicial nominee at the Cir-
cuit Court level. And indeed—indeed— 
those of us who are on the Judiciary 
Committee didn’t even get our 5 or 7 
minutes of time in the hearing with 
Trump Circuit Court nominees because 
the Trump administration worked out 
some kind of a deal that their nomi-
nees could be put on the same panel— 
something that had only been done be-
fore with the agreement of both par-
ties. 
So they would bring in their Circuit 
Court nominees, and you still got your 
5 minutes or your 7 minutes. But now 
there are two or three on the panel. 
You get like 1 minute each. 
So I just have to say that I like my 
friend from Alaska and we do work 
well together. But when I couldn’t get 
5 or 7 minutes in the committee in the 
hearing with a Circuit Court nominee, 
it is hard for me to feel a great sense of 
outrage that somebody not on the com-
mittee doesn’t get a special private 
meeting with judges. We never got spe-
cial private meetings with judges. We 
didn’t even get our time with the 
judges in the hearing because they 
sandwiched a bunch of them on the 
same panel in our same 5 to 7 minutes. 
So what I would like to do is to pro-
pose, since the objection has been made 
to confirming them tonight, that at 
least 
we 
might 
consider 
moving 
through the cloture step so that a vote 
can be scheduled and everybody can 
have their vote one way or the other. 
So my first unanimous consent re-
quest would have confirmed them, and 
a call could have gone out to them and 
to their families tonight saying: The 
holds are off. Your life is back in order. 
You can go to the job you have been 
nominated for. 
And all would have been well. 
There has been an objection to that. 
So what I would like to do is simply 
ask that they be allowed to tee up for 
a vote when scheduled, without having 
to pursue the cloture path. 
So I ask unanimous consent that, 
notwithstanding rule XXII, if applica-
ble, at a time to be determined by the 
majority leader in consultation with 
the Republican leader—in consultation 
with the Republican leader—the Senate 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nominations: Again, 
Executive Calendar Nos. 489 and 490; 
and that there be 10 minutes of debate, 
equally divided in the usual form, on 
the nominations, en bloc; that upon 
the use or yielding back of time, the 
Senate proceed to vote without inter-
vening action or debate on the nomina-
tions in the order listed; that if the 
nominations are confirmed, the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate; that no fur-
ther motions be in order regarding the 
nominations; and that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action. 
Again, this would not confirm them 
tonight. Their families will not get this 
call. But they are freed from our little 
Executive Calendar traffic jam. But it 
would at least put them on a pathway 
toward confirmation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Alaska.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9117 
December 13, 2021 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. 
I have a simpler solution here, and I 
have already mentioned it. 
The White House has denied my abil-
ity to meet with one Ninth Circuit 
judge who just got confirmed. Let me 
meet with the next two, and then we 
will UC these. We will UC these nomi-
nees whom Senator WHITEHOUSE has 
been trying to move forward tonight. 
I also want to mention to my col-
league from Rhode Island that I am 
certainly more than amenable to work-
ing with him on a principle that, I 
think, all Senators should agree on— 
all of us—to strengthen this institu-
tion, whether you are a Democrat, a 
Republican. That is this simple idea, 
which I thought existed here because I 
have certainly been able to do it: If a 
judge is up for confirmation, a circuit 
judge, and if you are a Senator rep-
resenting one of the States in the cir-
cuit and that judge is going to have 
enormous power over your constituents 
for life, we should, as a general rule, as 
a general principle, say always: Of 
course, you get to meet with that 
judge. Of course, you can do your con-
stitutional advice and consent duty. 
I would be for it for any Democrat 
who wants it if there is a Republican. 
Again, I talked to some folks from the 
Trump 
administration 
today. 
They 
said that they always offered that. So 
maybe there is a misunderstanding. I 
don’t want to say that my Senate col-
league from Rhode Island is not right 
or those guys. I don’t know. That is 
what they mentioned to me. 
I just think, as a principle, every 
Senator here should agree with it. Why 
wouldn’t you want to do that? 
Like I said, until today, I have met 
with every single Ninth Circuit judge 
whom we voted on in my entire career 
here. Now, it has been a relatively 
short career, but this is really impor-
tant to the people I represent because 
that court is really important to the 
people I represent. The Ninth Circuit 
so frequently gets the law wrong as it 
relates to Alaska, and it negatively im-
pacts my constituents. This is impor-
tant. 
So I object to this date certain re-
quest, but as I mentioned, if I can meet 
with these—two more—Ninth Circuit 
judges, Senator WHITEHOUSE can come 
down here and UC these two Court of 
Federal Claims judges, and I think he 
can move it. It is a real simple ask. 
And the fact that the White House 
Counsel hasn’t even called me back—a 
U.S. Senator trying to do his constitu-
tional duty, advice and consent of the 
Senate? The Senator from Rhode Is-
land and I are of the Senate. 
So why don’t we work on this prin-
ciple that, if there is a nominee, a cir-
cuit judge nominee, and if a Senator 
from a State in that circuit wants to 
meet with that nominee—to do his con-
stitutional duty—that we should all 
agree to do that no matter who is in 
the White House. I would agree to that 
principle in a heartbeat. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
think we have concluded this matter 
for the evening, and I am sorry that it 
has ended this way because Mr. Bonilla 
and Ms. Lerner are essentially collat-
eral damage in a fight that does not in-
volve the Court of Federal Claims at 
all. This involves a dispute between the 
Senator from Alaska and the White 
House, whom I do not direct and whom 
I do not speak for. 
Instead of keeping it within the con-
fines of the Ninth Circuit, it has now 
spilled over to the Court of Federal 
Claims, and these two completely unre-
lated individuals are continuing to 
have their lives interfered with by 
being kept in the traffic jam for a prin-
ciple that, in my view, was never fol-
lowed in the previous administration. I 
mean, for Pete’s sake, if they were not 
going to even let us have our official 
time with a circuit court judge, the 
idea that we were going to get private 
meetings is, I think, imaginative in the 
extreme. 
I just regret that it has come to this 
pass. I regret that we are at 159 ob-
structed nominees backed up. I regret 
that we have been forced to file cloture 
twice as much as that first group of 
Trump’s nominees, in his first year— 
and there were some real beauties 
there, I have got to tell you. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session and 
be in a period of morning business, 
with Senators permitted to speak 
therein for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
section 36(b) of the Arms Export Con-
trol Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

counter-piracy maritime efforts. Greece will 
have no difficulty absorbing these articles 
and services into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin of Bethesda, MD. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of approximately 8 
additional U.S. Government and 22 U.S. con-
tractor representatives to Greece to support 
engineering and logistics support for the pro-
duction and integration of Hellenic Future 
Frigates into the Hellenic Navy Fleet. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

phisticated sea skimming anti-ship cruise 
missiles. It incorporates inertial navigation 
with uplink/downlink and active RF final 
homing that requires no target illumination. 
Sea Ceptor controls missile targeting and 
flight profiles before launch through to ter-
mination. CAMM are quad-packed and could 
be configured for a thirty-two (32)-missile 
ship loadout. CAMM is available internation-
ally from MBDA. The CAMM system ex-
changes guidance data between Sea Ceptor 
and COMBATSS–21. 
e. Common Anti-Air Modular Missile-Ex-
tended Range (CAMM-ER) also counters 
highly sophisticated sea skimming anti-ship 
cruise missiles with additional range com-
pared to CAMM. It incorporates inertial 
navigation with uplink/downlink and active 
RF final homing that requires no target illu-
mination. Sea Ceptor controls missile tar-
geting and flight profiles before launch 
through to termination. CAMM-ER are quad- 
packed and could be configured for a thirty- 
two (32)-missile ship loadout. CAMM-ER is 
available internationally from MBDA. The 
CAMM-ER system exchanges guidance data 
between Sea Ceptor and COMBATSS–21.

k. The medium-to-long range fire-control 
radar system interfaces with the gun com-
puter system and COMBATSS–21. 
l. The gun computer system directs the ac-
tions of the ship’s main gun battery and re-
ceives orders for engagement and firing au-
thorization from the Combat Management 
System. The gun computer system takes tar-
get data from ship sensors for air and surface 
targets, or operator-entered data for targets 
ashore, and calculates ballistic solutions and 
outputs gun positioning orders, ammunition 
loading and firing orders for the mount. 
m. Infrared Search and Track (IRST) is a

data with AN/SQQ–89 for real-time shipboard 
processing of MH–60R deployed sonobuoys, 
increased sonobuoy processing, updated son-
obuoy control and increased ASW tracks. 
The AN/SQQ–89 accepts MH–60R ASW data 
and processes the data shipboard as a coordi-
nated tactical ASW picture with the Vari-
able Depth Sonar. ASW Operators, at AN/ 
SQQ–89 consoles, analyze classified data and 
integrate with COMBATSS–21 to provide full 
implementation and access to the capabili-
ties of the MH–60R. The MH–60R Multi-Mis-
sion Helicopters, procured by the Hellenic 
Navy under a separate FMS case, introduce 
dipping sonar, upgraded radar, electronic 
warfare, weapons including MK 54 torpedoes 
and external command and control systems. 
With the MH–60R comes the need for a Ku- 
Band Common Data Link via a shipboard 
AN/SRQ–4 Radio Terminal System to sup-
port the high data rate requirements associ-
ated with systems onboard the aircraft.

hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness, or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Greece can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of

and logistics support services; test and trials 
support; studies and surveys; and other re-
lated elements of logistical and program sup-
port. The estimated total cost is $2.5 billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by helping to improve the 
security of a NATO ally, which is an impor-
tant partner for political stability and eco-
nomic progress in Europe. 
The proposed sale will improve Greece’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by providing an effective combatant 
deterrent capability to protect maritime in-
terests and infrastructure in support of its 
strategic location on NATO’s southern flank. 
This acquisition, which will be awarded to 
the winner of an international competition 
for the Hellenic Navy (HN) MEKO Class Frig-
ate Upgrade, will enhance stability and mar-
itime security in the Eastern Mediterranean 
region and contribute to security and stra-
tegic objectives of NATO and the United 
States. Greece contributes to NATO oper-
ations in Kosovo, as well as to counterter-
rorism and counter-piracy maritime efforts. 
Greece will have no difficulty absorbing 
these articles and services into its armed 
forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be Raytheon 
Missiles and Defense, Waltham, MA; Lock-
heed Martin, Bethesda, MD; BAE Systems, 
Arlington, VA; and VSE Corporation, Alex-
andria, VA. There are no known offset agree-
ments in connection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of 3 additional U.S. 
Government and (5) contractor representa-
tives, Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) positions 
to Greece. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

S. RES. 477 
Whereas sickle cell disease (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘SCD’’) is an inherited 
blood disorder that is a major health prob-
lem in the United States and worldwide; 
Whereas SCD causes the rapid destruction 
of sickle cells, which results in multiple 
medical complications, including anemia, 
jaundice, 
gallstones, 
strokes, 
restricted 
blood flow, damaged tissue in the liver, 
spleen, and kidneys, and death; 
Whereas SCD causes acute and chronic epi-
sodes of severe pain; 
Whereas SCD affects an estimated 100,000 
individuals in the United States; 
Whereas approximately 1,000 babies are 
born with SCD each year in the United 
States, with the disease occurring in ap-
proximately 1 in 365 newborn Black or Afri-
can-American infants and 1 in 16,300 newborn 
Hispanic-American infants, and can be found 
in individuals of Mediterranean, Middle 
Eastern, Asian, and Indian origin; 
Whereas more than 3,000,000 individuals in 
the United States have the sickle cell trait 
and 1 in 13 African Americans carries the 
trait; 
Whereas there is a 1 in 4 chance that a 
child born to parents who both have the 
sickle cell trait will have the disease; 
Whereas the life expectancy of an indi-
vidual with SCD in the United States is 
often severely limited; 
Whereas, in 2020, the National Academies 
of 
Science, 
Engineering, 
and 
Medicine

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9125 
December 13, 2021 
(NASEM) developed a comprehensive Stra-
tegic Plan and Blueprint for Action to Ad-
dress Sickle Cell Disease, which, among 
other things, cited the need for new innova-
tive therapies as well as the need to address 
barriers that may impact delivery and access 
to approved treatments; 
Whereas, while hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation 
(commonly 
known 
as 
‘‘HSCT’’) is currently the only cure for SCD 
and advances in treating the associated com-
plications of SCD have occurred, more re-
search is needed to find widely available 
treatments and cures to help individuals 
with SCD; and 
Whereas September 2021 has been des-
ignated as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness 
Month in order to educate communities 
across the United States about SCD, includ-
ing early detection methods, effective treat-
ments, and preventative care programs with 
respect to complications from SCD and con-
ditions related to SCD: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘Sickle 
Cell Disease Awareness Month’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to hold appropriate programs, events, 
and activities during Sickle Cell Disease 
Awareness Month to raise public awareness 
of the sickle cell trait, preventative care 
programs, treatments, and other patient 
services for those suffering from SCD, com-
plications from SCD, and conditions related 
to SCD.

HONORING CHEHALIS MAYOR 
DENNIS DAWES 
HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 13, 2021 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Mayor Dennis Dawes 
of Chehalis who is retiring from Chehalis City 
Council at the end of this year. Our community 
owes Mayor Dawes our sincere gratitude; he 
has dedicated his professional life to public 
service. He began his distinguished career in 
the Chehalis Police Department, where he 
rose through the ranks to become police chief. 
Mayor Dawes also served six terms on the 
Chehalis School Board from 1983 to 2007, 
and even worked as a bus driver for the 
Centralia School District. Ever active in his 
community, Mayor Dawes has also volun-
teered as a referee in local basketball and 
football games. Most recently, he has spent 
the last sixteen years as a city councilor in 
Chehalis, with eight of those years in his cur-
rent role as mayor. 
Mayor Dawes exemplifies what it means to 
be a public servant and has worked diligently 
for decades to improve the community he 
loves. It is truly my honor to work with excep-
tional, motivated, and dedicated leaders like 
him. While his official public service may be 
coming to an end, I am confident Mayor 
Dawes will continue to serve his neighbors in 
the Chehalis community, and I wish him the 
best in his retirement.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
COURTS 
HOME 
RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 13, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Courts Home 
Rule Act. This bill would give the Council of 
the District of Columbia authority over the ju-
risdiction and organization of the local D.C. 
courts. The D.C. Home Rule Act (HRA) ex-
pressly prohibits the Council from enacting 
any law with respect to any provision of the 
D.C. Code title that relates to the local D.C. 
courts. Congress can correct this injustice to 
the District’s federal taxpaying residents by 
amending the HRA, even before the District 
becomes the 51st state. 
Forty-eight years after passage of the HRA, 
matters involving the local D.C. courts almost 
never come to Congress, so Congress knows 
virtually nothing about the District’s local 
courts—and could not care less. Notwith-
standing the importance of D.C. ’s local courts 
to District residents, the D.C. Council, which is 
the repository of knowledge and experience 
for the District’s criminal and civil justice sys-
tems and the body accountable to our resi-
dents, is irresponsibly left on the sidelines 
while Congress remains the sole entity that 
may correct flaws in the District’s local courts. 
Under the HRA, the Council has no author-
ity to ‘‘enact any act, resolution, or rule with 
respect to any provision of title 11 of the Dis-
trict of Columbia Code (relating to organization 
and jurisdiction of the District of Columbia 
courts).’’ Matters in title 11 are limited primarily 
to the rules of criminal and civil procedure, 
court administration, the branches of the 
courts, the rules of jury service and admission 
to the bar. Our bill would strike this limitation 
on the Council’s authority. 
The District has never had authority over its 
local courts, even when it was responsible for 
paying for their operations. Under the National 
Capital Revitalization and Self-Government 
Improvement Act of 1997, the federal govern-
ment assumed the costs for several state-level 
functions, including the courts because the 
federal government alone has jurisdiction over 
the courts. This bill would not change the 
courts’ funding. This bill also would not 
change the authority of the President to nomi-
nate, or the Senate to confirm, local D.C. 
judges, which has been within their purview 
since the creation of the modem local court 
system in 1970. 
This bill is an important step to increase 
democratic self-government for the District. I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING MRS. LINDA B. CONLIN 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 13, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mrs. Linda B. Conlin on the occasion of 
her retirement. 
Linda has served the people of the United 
States of America in her role as a Department 
of the Army Civilian for over 39 years. Her 
long and distinguished career of service began 
in 1973 as a Kindergarten teacher in a small 
DoD school in the East-West German border 
kaserne of Bad Hersfeld, Germany. She fin-
ishes her career with over 25 years in the 
Washington, D.C. area-serving in the Army’s 
Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, and 
most recently for the last 17 years as the Sup-
port Division Chief in the National Guard Bu-
reau’s Office of Legislative Liaison. Linda has 
received a Commander’s Award for Civilian 
Service and several Superior Civilian Service 
Awards. 
As the Co-Chair of the National Guard and 
Reserve Caucus, I especially want to thank 
her for her service with the National Guard 
Bureau’s Office of Legislative Liaison. 
2021 will undoubtedly go down in history as, 
‘‘The Year of the National Guard.’’ This year. 
the National Guard continued its mission to 
fight the scourge that is the COVID–19 pan-
demic, conducted a mobilization of 25,000 
troops to defend our Capitol—the bastion of 
our Democracy, responded to countless nat-
ural disasters ranging from fires, to floods, to 
hurricanes, all while continuing to protect us 
from our adversaries abroad. 
Throughout this tumultuous year, the Na-
tional Guard Bureau’s Office of Legislative Li-
aison supported my office, and all of Con-
gress, in unprecedented ways. Linda was crit-
ical in providing this support and embodied the 
spirit of the Guard’s motto: ‘‘Always Ready, Al-
ways There.’’ 
This country is losing a true patriot today, 
her loss will be noticed. As she begins her 
new adventures, I wish Linda and her family 
with nothing but health and happiness in her 
retirement.

SUPPORTING THE TREAT AND 
REDUCE OBESITY ACT 
HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGA´N 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 13, 2021 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, the 
number of Americans living with obesity is 
reaching record levels. Today, nearly 100 mil-
lion Americans are living with obesity, a com-
plex chronic condition associated with other 
diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, 
stroke, and even cancer. 
Obesity 
also 
disproportionately 
impacts 
communities of color, particularly Black and 
Latino adults. Nearly half (49.6 percent) of 
Black Americans and 44.8 percent of Latino 
Americans are living with obesity, compared to 
42.2 percent of their white counterparts. In my 
district in Southern California, which is more 
than two-thirds Latino, rates of diabetes and 
obesity are among the highest in the state. 
Unfortunately, outdated Medicare rules deny 
access to effective obesity care for millions of 
Americans. Despite a 2013 decision by the 
American Medical Association recognizing 
obesity as a treatable disease, Medicare still 
stigmatizes obesity as a choice and denies ac-
cess to the full continuum of care. 
This is something we can change. Right 
now, there is legislation—The Treat and Re-
duce Obesity Act—that would modernize 
Medicare by providing access to anti-obesity 
medications and intensive behavioral therapy, 
thus expanding care to millions of Americans. 
New data shows that the American people 
support Congressional action to expand ac-
cess to coverage for obesity treatments. 70 
percent of adults surveyed in a recent Morning 
Consult poll conducted on behalf of the Obe-
sity Care Advocacy Network support expand-
ing Medicare coverage for prevention and 
treatment of obesity in adults. 
I urge all of Congress to join me in sup-
porting the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act to 
begin to address our obesity epidemic in Cali-
fornia and across the country.

December 13, 2021 
NATIONAL PULSE MEMORIAL 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 7, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the out-of-control defense 
spending contained in this year’s National De-
fense Authorization Act. At a topline level of 
$768.2, billion, this bill is larger than any pre-
vious pentagon spending bill. It’s even bigger 
than what the President asked for by $25 bil-
lion. 
This excess is particularly egregious when 
compared to the military spending of our po-
tential adversaries. We spend more on the US 
military than the next eleven countries com-
bined. 
And all this funding is being poured into an 
agency that is perennially unaccountable to 
the American public. It has been 30 years 
since all federal agencies were required to 
pass audits. And after three decades the De-
partment of Defense (DOD) remains the only 
agency in the federal government that has so 
far failed to pass an audit. The most recent 
prediction from the department for a clean 
audit is 2028. 
Yet we see numerous examples of fraud, 
waste, and abuse from this department, from 
legacy weapons systems built for the cold war, 
to the billions in documented waste in Afghani-
stan. 
The military has rightly identified the climate 
crisis as one of the biggest and most imme-
diate threats to American lives and interests. 
And yet the Pentagon still hasn’t fully reported 
on its own greenhouse gas emissions. And 
every excessive dollar spent on the Pentagon 
isn’t available for the investments we need to 
make in mitigation and adaptation to protect 
us and the world from the impacts of climate 
change. 
Especially frustrating to me about this bill is 
the fact that needed reforms to advance racial 
justice and combat extremism and white su-
premacy were excluded in the negotiations 
that produced this compromise legislation. Our 
military leaders have been clear about the 
need to address extremism within the ranks 
and provide equal justice for Black and Brown 
servicemen and women. By failing to address 
these issues adequately in this bill, we don’t 
just let down our men and women in uniform, 
we let down the country and betray our ideals. 
Enough is enough. Americans are demand-
ing that Congress rebalance our priorities and 
invest in the biggest challenges America 
faces. We face imminent threats from the 
COVID pandemic, Climate Change, domestic 
terrorism, growing economic inequality, and 
systemic racial and ethnic inequities. It is time 
to shift our spending priorities to meet these 
urgent human security priorities. I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill.

HONORING CPT. MITCH PHILLIPS 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 13, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the service of one of Missouri’s 
finest, Captain Mitch Phillips, who is retiring 
after 28 years of dedicated service in the Cass 
County Sheriffs Office. 
Cpt. Phillips started his career attending 
what is now known as the University of Cen-
tral Missouri. While there, he discovered a call 
to serve and protect his community and de-
cided to pursue a career in public service. Cpt. 
Phillips first joined the Garden City Police De-
partment after graduating from the National 
Police Academy in Warrensburg, Missouri. 
Shortly thereafter, Cpt. Phillips became ac-
quainted with the deputies from the Cass 
County Sheriffs Office and knew that his call 
to service would lead him there. In August of 
1993, Cpt. Phillips joined the Cass County 
Sheriffs Office as a Patrol Deputy. As a result 
of his hard work and demonstrated leadership 
capabilities, Cpt. Phillips quickly rose to the 
rank of Sergeant in November of 1995. 
Cpt. Phillips has held various leadership po-
sitions within the Cass County Sheriffs Office 
and has cultivated an environment that pro-
motes integrity, dedication, and excellence 
from all his officers. His unwavering, steadfast 
support for his brothers and sisters in uniform 
truly represents the values of Missouri. 
As any of the men and women that wear 
the badge can tell you, service does not come 
without sacrifice. No officer bears the burdens 
alone. For more than 28 years, Cpt. Phillips 
put the safety and wellbeing of the citizens of 
Cass County above his own, with the support 
of his wife, Michele, his three children, who 
stood 
beside 
their 
husband 
and 
father 
throughout all the hardships that the nature of 
law enforcement placed before them. We owe 
them all a debt of gratitude. 
His life verse, Mathew 7:12, is one we all 
should abide by—‘‘So in everything, do unto 
others as you would have them do unto you 
. . .’’ Cpt. Phillips embodies all the qualities 
that make an excellent officer and public serv-
ant. Please join me in recognizing and hon-
oring this heroic police officer and his years of 
self-less service to protecting our community.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
ACCOMPLISH-

OF 
EL 
COMERCIO 
DE 
COLORADO 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 13, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize 
the 
accomplishments 
of 
El 
Comercio de Colorado for receiving 14 na-
tional journalism awards granted by the Na-
tional Association of Hispanic Publications 
(NAHP). 
In my time in Congress, I have been proud 
to represent the most diverse district in Colo-
rado. With people from all walks of life and 
over 120,000 immigrants calling our commu-
nity home, our diversity makes our community 
a stronger and more vibrant place to live. 
As our district’s Latino and Hispanic popu-
lations have grown, El Comercio de Colorado 
has offered high-quality Spanish-language 
content for our community. As the publication 
has gained recognition. Jesus Sanchez, chief 
editor of El Comercio de Colorado, has made 
it his mission to provide our Spanish-speaking 
community with a publication that provides 
well-sourced information about what is hap-
pening across our district and nation. 
The hard work and dedication shown by 
Jesus and his staff at El Comercio de Colo-
rado has more than paid off as the publication 
was awarded 14 national journalism awards

HONORING THE CAREER OF STEVE 
RICHARDSON 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 13, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the career of hardworking 
public servant, Steve Richardson. After serv-
ing nearly 40 years with the Social Security 
Administration spanning three different field of-
fices, Steve will head onto the next chapter of 
his life this on December 31st, 2021. Steve 
has dedicated his life to serving and informing 
the public, and his loss is a notable one for 
the Social Security Administration and the 
Boston region as a whole. 
As a fellow native New Englander, Steve 
graduated from Northeastern in 1984 with a 
Bachelor’s in Political Science. As someone 
who place strong value in an education, he 
also went on to obtain a Master’s in Public Af-
fairs from Boston’s Emerson College in 1999. 
Equipped with an impressive Massachusetts 
education, Steve was destined to serve the 
public of Connecticut’s neighboring state. 
Before even completing his Bachelor’s, he 
began with the Roxbury Social Security Ad-
ministration’s Field Office in 1982 as a claims 
representative, working to prove his profes-
sionalism and wealth of knowledge from the 
get-go. It was because of his experience and 
dedication to the public that he was able to 
expand his career with the Administration to 
the Roslindale and Chelsea field offices while 
wearing numerous hats including the addi-
tional roles of supervisor and regional public 
affairs specialist. He most recently transitioned 
to the role of regional communications director 
for the Boston regional office in 2018, where 
he has remained responsible for the coordina-
tion of the Administration’s public activities in 
all six New England states. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to have had 
the opportunity to meet Steve and know of his 
work on all things related to Social Security. 
He has been an invaluable resource for my of-
fice and longtime Social Security caseworker 
Karen Weseliza, and has acted as a strong 
leader, creative teacher, and an excellent ad-
ministrator to those who have worked with and 
for him. Even with Karen’s sharp expertise, he 
could always be relied on as the first person 
to call on the hardest cases and could always 
be relied upon to assist my casework team 
with any complications. To that end, I ask that 
my colleagues join me in celebrating Steve’s 
life of hard work and congratulating him on a 
well-earned retirement. 
EXTENSION 
OF 
COVERAGE 
OF 
CORONAVIRUS 
RELIEF 
FUND 
PAYMENTS TO TRIBAL GOVERN-
MENTS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 5119, legislation that would ex-
tend availability of CARES Act funds provided 
to tribal governments through December 30, 
2022. 
Currently, CARES Act funds will expire on 
December 31, 2021, and tribes will be unable 
to use these vital resources. Although $8 bil-
lion was set aside for Tribes in the CARES 
Act to help respond to the coronavirus pan-
demic, they did not receive any funds until 
May 5, 2020, and some are still in the process 
of being distributed. 
It is important to note that this legislation 
does not increase federal spending, rather it 
extends the timeline to use money already al-
located. 
After the CARES Act was signed into law, 
there was minimal guidance offered on what 
this funding could and could not be put to-
wards, which led to an inadequate timeframe 
for Tribes to prepare an effective spending 
plan. A one-year extension will allow them the 
necessary time to best allocate these re-
sources to their members without a rushed 
agenda. 
Coronavirus Relief Funds have been put to-
wards many essential services such as, im-
provements to health care, purchasing protec-
tive equipment, and distance learning pro-
grams. 
Tribes used these funds in many different 
ways. Whether it was turning facilities into 
emergency operation centers or building 
meatpacking warehouses to help with the food 
supply crisis, they stepped up to provide for 
their members and community during the pan-
demic. 
With the delayed allocations and limited 
guidance, tribes were put at an unfair advan-
tage to begin with. This is why a December 
31, 2022, extension of availability for CARES 
Act funds is necessary to allow tribes the time 
to effectively use these resources. 
As Co-Chair of the Native American Cau-
cus, I commend Vice Chair Young and Rep-
resentative O’Halleran in introducing this legis-
lation. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
H.R. 5119.
