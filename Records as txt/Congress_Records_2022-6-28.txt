HONORING BLUE STAR AS A DIS-
TINGUISHED 
LEADER 
IN 
CEN-
TRAL 
FLORIDA 
FOR 
PRIDE 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Blue Star (she/ 
her) is an Atlanta native and retired profes-
sional ballet dancer that has been curating art 
in Orlando for over two decades. A creator, 
business owner, and philanthropist, Blue has 
helped change the fabric of the Orlando com-
munity and creates safe spaces for the 
LGBTQIA community and their allies. She is 
the founder of her own 501(c)(3) cancer orga-
nization—The Barber Fund—and the owner of 
BlueLaLa Events Entertainment and Con-
sulting. She is also a former entertainment 
and board member of Come Out With Pride 
and Ivanhoe Village. She is currently on the 
steering committee for Equality Florida, the 
bidding committee for World Pride Orlando 
2026, and the curator of United We Dance— 
an official week of remembrance event for the 
One Pulse Foundation. 
Blue is an honoree of thc Harvey Milk Trail-
blazer Award, Orlando Magazines Woman of 
the Year, and 50 Most Powerful. She was rec-
ognized by the One Pulse Foundation for her 
heroic efforts after the Pulse tragedy and 
sainted by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. 
Her artistic recognitions include best perform-
ance, favorite dancer, and best actress. Her 
long-standing show ‘‘VarieTEASE’’ has been 
honored by many organizations for show cre-
ation, choreography, and costuming. She is 
also a City of Orlando honoree of the DTO 
Golden Brick Award and Business of the Year. 
She continues to fight for human rights, cre-
ate art, make music, and, of course, dance, 
sing, and act. She does this because art is a 
tool that can heal a community because we 
must ‘‘KEEP DANCING, ORLANDO,’’ we must 
keep fighting, and we must ‘‘DO SOME-
THING.’’

JOSEPH 
WOODROW 
HATCHETT 
UNITED 
STATES 
COURTHOUSE 
AND FEDERAL BUILDING 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to share my concerns regarding the Bi-
partisan Safer Communities Act. While I sup-
port the underlying bill and appreciate that 
several Republican Senators finally came to 
the table to work with Democrats to address 
our nation’s gun violence epidemic, I remain 
troubled by the legislation’s possible expan-
sion of the federal death penalty and the cre-
ation of broad new criminal offenses that may 
disproportionately impact Black and Brown 
communities. 
Specifically, with regard to the expansion of 
the federal death penalty, I have not been 
given a clear answer as to the impact of the 
legislation’s additions to the definition of ‘‘rack-
eteering activity’’ in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), com-
monly known as ‘‘RICO predicates.’’ On its 
face and cross referencing the impacted provi-
sions in Title 18, it appears that murder com-
mitted in the furtherance of these new RICO 
predicates would trigger the federal death pen-
alty. In states that do not have the death pen-
alty, this creates an opportunity for federal 
prosecutors to seek the death penalty in 
states where it does not currently exist. It is 
possible that but for these changes, a new 
universe of defendants would now be subject 
to the federal death penalty. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee staff cir-
culated a document that appears to confirm 
my reading of this provision. However, the De-
partment of Justice sent a dismissive e-mail to 
staff simply stating that ‘‘changes to RICO 
laws do not constitute an expansion of the po-
tential applications of the federal death penalty 
as a matter of law.’’ While I hope this is in-
deed the case, DOJ provided no citation to 
federal law or reference to internal Department 
memorandum directing charging decisions. I 
hope that the Department provides Congress 
with their legal authority on this matter expedi-
tiously. 
I also consulted several experts in the crimi-
nal justice defense community who also con-
firmed that this bill expands federal death pen-
alty-eligible offenses. However, there is no 
consensus as to the magnitude of these ex-
pansions. While this may in fact not be a 
measurable expansion, I have been troubled 
by the lack of comprehensive legal analysis 
available for a reasonable understanding of 
the breadth of this legislation. 
While I find this troubling, I will vote in favor 
of this bill. It should not go uncelebrated that 
this is the first significant legislative effort in 
thirty years that attempts to address the 
scourge of gun violence in our country. I have 
a long record of supporting measures to curb 
the epidemic of gun violence and it includes 
provisions I have long supported. This bill 
closes the boyfriend loophole for domestic 
abusers, enhances background checks for 
those aged 18 to 21 when purchasing a gun, 
and provides incentives to states to enact red 
flag laws that protects individuals in crisis from 
perpetuating further harm on themselves or 
others. But without adequate time for mem-
bers and the American public to review the 
unintended consequences of the many provi-
sions within the bill, many questions are left 
unanswered where they should not be for 
such a significant piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, despite my strong concerns, I 
applaud the bipartisan effort that went into 
crafting this legislation. With reservations 
about the bill’s potential to expand the federal 
death penalty, I will vote for yes because of 
the assurance from the Department of Justice 
and the positive strides towards creating safer 
communities that the bill seeks to achieve.

RECOGNIZING DR. CHAD AUDI 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
recognize the outstanding work on behalf of 
the people of Wayne County and southeastern 
Michigan by Dr. Chad Audi in his more than 
two decades as president of Detroit Rescue 
Mission, an organization dedicated to pro-
viding food, shelter, and resources to those 
struggling to overcome homelessness or sub-
stance abuse issues. 
Dr. Audi first joined Detroit Rescue Mission 
as a volunteer. He was struck by the trans-
formative impact the organization had on the 
countless individuals who sought assistance. 
In 2004, he joined Detroit Rescue Mission as 
president and CEO, bringing his expertise in 
finance and management while continuing to 
serve those who seek help with dignity and 
humility. I commend Dr. Audi and the Detroit 
Rescue Mission staff and volunteers on their 
success in offering wrap-around assistance 
programming throughout the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
Please join me in recognizing Dr. Chad 
Audi’s 20-plus years of service to the people 
of southeastern Michigan and Michigan’s 13th 
District Strong.

AS A DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN 
CENTRAL FLORIDA FOR PRIDE 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Ryan Anthony 
Beck was born with his sister on August 30, 
1991, in Buffalo, New York. His parents are 
Michael Wayne Beck and Christina Marie 
Beck. They lived in Buffalo, New York, until he 
and his sister were 6 years old and then 
moved to Orlando, Florida. Ryan has always 
had a passion for standing up for what he be-
lieves in. 
He first started volunteering with the Central 
Florida Human Rights Campaign in 2011, one 
year after graduating from high school, and 
joined their steering committee a few years 
later. Diana Iwanski was the first person to 
ask Ryan if he could be a part of the social 
media team at HRC Orlando because he is 
very vocal on social media. Ryan still remem-
bers that first event like it was yesterday—he 
had a lot of fun picking up trash for the event 
and it was the first real time he was around a 
lot of LGBTQ+ folks. Though it is hard for

Ryan to believe that it has been 11 years 
since he first began working with HRC Or-
lando, he remains as passionate as ever for 
equality for all. 
Diana Iwanski used to say, ‘‘Thank you for 
signing up and showing up’’ when he would 
volunteer for an event, and Ryan thinks that is 
extremely important—getting out into your 
community and getting involved. Whether 
working with a community organization or get-
ting out there and protesting, doing something 
worthwhile in your community is extremely im-
portant, especially in this political climate.

RECOGNIZING CLARA BREWER 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
recognize Ms. Clara Brewer, a long-time resi-
dent of Southwest Detroit in Michigan’s 13th 
District Strong, on the occasion of her 100th 
birthday. 
For more than 70 years, Ms. Brewer has 
been a cornerstone of not only her family, but 
her neighborhood-family. She has lived in her 
home she and her husband bought as newly-
weds since 1945. She and her family have 
grown with our community, and she has with-
out question been a community anchor. Ms. 
Brewer has remained steadfast in her spiritual 
faith and in her love for her family, which in-
cludes multiple generations in southeastern 
Michigan. I pray that she continues to shine 
brightly in our community and be surrounded 
by the love of her family members near and 
far. 
As the Brewer Family meets for their annual 
family reunion, please join me in wishing Clara 
Brewer a happy 100th birthday.

HONORING NANCY GOLDBERG 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Nancy Goldberg upon 
her retirement as Board President of the 
Rhoda Goldman Plaza assisted living facility in 
San Francisco and more than 50 years of 
nonprofit service. 
As Board President, Nancy has steered 
Rhoda Goldman Plaza through a difficult three 
years, demonstrating impeccable leadership 
and ingenuity as assisted living facilities 
throughout the country navigated unprece-
dented challenges and worked to establish a 
new normal related to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. The residents and staff fared relatively 
well through this trying time under the guid-
ance of strong management. This work caps 
off half a century of advocacy on behalf of the 
Jewish community and tireless efforts to com-
bat human trafficking and domestic violence. 
Nancy has served on numerous boards 
throughout her prolific career, including as a 
member of the American Jewish Congress, 
President of the Jewish Family and Children’s 
Services of San Francisco, and Chair of the 
Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California. 
For her outstanding leadership and advocacy 
on behalf of the Jewish community in Cali-
fornia, the Jewish Community Relations Coun-
cil awarded her both the Earl Raab Award in 
2009 and Tom Lantos Memorial Humanitarian 
Award in 2011 in conjunction with her hus-
band, the late Larry Goldberg. 
Dedicating years to fighting human traf-
ficking, Nancy is Co-founder of the Jewish Co-
alition to End Human Trafficking and Co- 
founder and first Co-chair of the San Fran-
cisco Collaborative Against Human Trafficking 
(SFCAHT), coordinated by the National Coun-
cil of Jewish Women (NCJW). For this trans-
formative work she earned the SFCAHT’s In-
spiring Leadership Award in 2019 and NCJW’s 
Hannah G. Solomon Award in 2014. Although 
she is retiring as President from Rhoda Gold-
man Plaza, her volunteer pursuits are ongo-
ing. 
Nancy’s contributions to improving the qual-
ity of live for countless individuals throughout 
the region through public service and philan-
thropy has been, and will continue to be, pro-
ductive and enduring. Madam Speaker, I re-
spectfully ask that you join me in expressing 
gratitude to Nancy for her enduring commit-
ment to public service and extending best 
wishes for years to come.

HONORING RENEE BISHOP AS A 
DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN CEN-
TRAL 
FLORIDA 
FOR 
PRIDE 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Renee Bishop 
is 43 years old and shares her life with an 
amazing woman, Rebecca, and daughters 
Sutton and Piper. She has had the honor of 
serving and protecting the community and citi-
zens of Orlando for 22 years. As a firefighter/ 
engineer for the Orlando Fire Department, 
Renee has seen the city go through wonderful 
changes. 
Growing up as the oldest of four with two 
brothers and a sister, all siblings were very fa-
miliar with the fire department as her father 
worked for the Orlando Fire Department for 30 
years and one of her brothers chose this ca-
reer as well. 
Renee and her father were the first father/ 
daughter combo hired at Orlando and a cou-
ple of years later, she and her brother were 
the first brother/sister combo for Orlando. 
Being a native of Orlando and being a gay fe-
male, she has watched the city grow and 
come to have one of the biggest LBGTQ com-
munities around. Renee is grateful for the po-
litical leaders the city has and the dedication 
they give. Creating opportunities without preju-
dice has helped the city come so far and she 
believes it is an amazing transition to watch. 
The ongoing research and desire to make the 
community safe and accepting for all people is 
what Renee and Rebecca love about raising 
their girls in Orlando. 
She feels forever fortunate to not only live in 
Orlando and the state of Florida but to also 
serve her community and be there to help 
when needed the most. First responders are 
often on the front line when tragedy strikes, 
and Renee has witnessed various organiza-
tions within the community rally together and 
stand as one when evil strikes. Orlando bas 
such a diverse population and a multitude of 
different belief structures, but when it is time 
to stand together, they do it on a scale that is 
second to none. Renee believes this is be-
cause of the leaders.

HONORING ST. JOHN’S EPISCOPAL 
CHURCH 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to today 
to honor St. John’s Episcopal Church in 
Versailles, Kentucky, on their 175th anniver-
sary. 
The church was officially established on 
June 29, 1847, under the leadership of Rev-
erend John N. Norton and Mr. John Amsden. 
The current church building was consecrated 
on May 28, 1885. In 1930, the parish house 
and the chapel, gifts from Senator Johnson 
Camden and family, were consecrated. The 
church has been visited by important dig-
nitaries including Her Majesty, Queen Eliza-
beth II of England in 1986 and President 
George Herbert Walker Bush, who worshipped 
unannounced at St. John’s in 1989. 
As the congregation gathers to celebrate the 
175th anniversary, I recognize the impact that 
this congregation has made on the Versailles 
community over the years. The church has 
reached thousands of people with material 
needs and spiritual sustenance. 
I congratulate the Reverend Dana Lockhart 
and all the members of St. John’s Episcopal 
Church in Versailles on their 175th anniver-
sary and wish them many more years of suc-
cessful ministry, serving God and reaching out 
to the community.

GOWANUS 
CANAL 
REMEDIAL 
ACTION 
ENFORCE-

HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Ms. VALA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the outstanding achievements of 
Gowanus Canal Remedial Action Enforcement 
Team at U.S. Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s Region 2 office. Their outstanding efforts 
at the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site ensured 
that potentially responsible parties (PRPs) 
completed the main phase of full-scale dredg-
ing in the upper third of the Canal, the first of 
three phases. 
The heavily contaminated urban waterway, 
a 1.8-mile-long canal in Brooklyn, NY dating 
from the 1800s, has been contaminated by in-
dustrial pollution and combined sewer over-
flows (CSOs) for over a century. The Site was 
listed on the National Priorities List in 2010. 
Since listing, EPA staff assigned to the project 
include Christos Tsiamis, Remedial Project 
Manager, Brian Carr, Assistant Regional 
Counsel, and Natalie Loney, Community In-
volvement Coordinator. Together, they man-
aged this large complex project in a thorough

and timely manner from feasibility study 
through remedy selection in a 2013 Record of 
Decision and remedial design for full-scale 
dredging and capping with in-situ stabilization 
and installation of retention tanks to protect 
the dredged canal from recontamination from 
combined sewer overflows (CSOs). 
The three superfund cleanup sites in New 
York City fall in my Congressional district and 
the Gowanus Canal is the furthest along and 
proceeding at a precedent-setting pace nation-
ally. The Gowanus Canal Community Advisory 
Group is the largest and most engaged in the 
Country. 
The Team managed enforcement with a dis-
parate group of roughly three dozen PRPs in-
cluding National Grid, the successor to the op-
erator of coal gasification plants responsible 
for a significant amount of coal tar related con-
tamination in the Canal, and the City of New 
York, which owns the canal and is responsible 
for the sewer infrastructure in the watershed. 
The City opposed to both the listing of the 
Gowanus Canal and the CSO portion of the 
remedy. This made community outreach and 
enforcement more critical and the EPA team’s 
work in this area has been exceptional. 
To achieve the timely start of dredging, 
Project Manager Christos Tsiamis and Re-
gional Counsel Brian Carr worked tirelessly, 
issuing unilateral administrative orders in Jan-
uary 2020 to six PRPs, and coordinating with 
multiple contractors, city agencies, and legal 
and technical teams to achieve the remedial 
mobilization. 
Dredging canal sediments contaminated 
with coal tar in this densely populated urban 
area posed challenges that were overcome 
through outstanding engineering and oversight 
by the team. Dredging began in November 
2020, and the first phase called Remediation 
Target Area 1 (RTAl) was completed by mid- 
2021. 
Mr. Tsiamis, Mr. Carr, and Ms. Loney, met 
regularly with the CAG, local businesses, and 
other stakeholders. Thanks to their efforts, the 
main phase of dredging was swiftly completed, 
setting a high bar for completion of the next 
two phases of dredging (RTA2 and RTA3). Al-
though enforcement issues remain with re-
spect to the City, obtaining its commitment for 
this work was a major enforcement accom-
plishment, a result that the team worked tire-
lessly and effectively to achieve. For their out-
standing work, I would like to recognize EPA 
Region 2’s Gowanus remedial action team: 
Project Manager Christos Tsiamis, Assistant 
Regional Counsel Brian Carr, and Community 
Involvement Coordinator Natalie Loney.

HONORING GARY RAGGHIANTI 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the significant career and 
accomplishments of Gary T. Ragghianti, the 
2020 recipient of the Marin County Bar Asso-
ciation’s Lifetime Achievement Award. 
A Marin County resident since 1948, Gary 
has dedicated his professional career to public 
service and the law. He graduated from the 
University of San Francisco School of Law in 
1968 and began trying cases in the Marin 
County District Attorney’s Office in 1969. In 
1971, Gary joined the private firm of Conn, 
Breiner, Birkie & Ragghianti, which became 
Ragghianti Freitas in 2004. Over the course of 
his half-century-long career, he has served as 
the city attorney for San Rafael, Belvedere, 
Tiburon, and Corte Madera, and spent dec-
ades as counsel for other public entities in 
Marin County. 
Gary has served on numerous boards 
throughout his prolific career, including as 
President of the San Rafael Public Library 
Foundation Board of Directors and Vice Presi-
dent of the Marin County History Museum 
Board of Directors. He is also a two-time 
member of the Board of Directors of Alternate 
Defenders, Inc., a nonprofit which provides 
free legal representation to indigent defend-
ants in Marin County. 
Over the course of his illustrious career, 
Gary has appeared twice before the United 
States Supreme Court. On the first occasion, 
he argued on behalf of the City of Tiburon at 
the age of 35. Then, 30 years later, he ap-
peared again for a federal habeas corpus 
case, further cementing his reputation as a 
lawyer who can excel at the highest levels. 
Gary’s commitment to the legal profession 
and local government in the County of Marin 
has been, and will continue to be, productive 
and enduring. Madam Speaker, I respectfully 
ask that you join me in expressing gratitude to 
Gary for his commitment to public service and 
the law, and extending heartfelt congratula-
tions on his reception of the Marin County Bar 
Association’s Lifetime Achievement Award. 
IN CELEBRATION OF JUNE AS 
NATIONAL PRIDE MONTH 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, during this month of June, I would 
like to take the time to recognize Pride Month. 
Pride is a time to celebrate the LGBTQ+ com-
munity and their contributions to our families, 
communities, and society at large. Pride is an 
opportunity for Americans to take pride in who 
we are without fear of discrimination and to 
stand in solidarity for equality and against 
hate. As we celebrate, it is imperative that we 
also recognize that, while our nation has made 
important progress with respect to LGBTQ+ 
rights, much work remains to be done. 
I am proud to have helped advance statu-
tory improvements to support LGBTQ+ rights 
during this Congress. We enacted the Jabara- 
Heyer NO HATE Act that combats hate crimes 
including crimes motivated by sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity. In addition, the law al-
locates money and resources to collect data 
on and to support victims of hate crimes. We 
also designated the Pulse Nightclub as a Na-
tional Memorial in remembrance of those who 
lost their lives during the Pulse Nightclub 
shooting in 2019. Further, I’m proud that the 
People’s House championed equality and op-
posed hate by passing the Equality Act that 
would afford LGBTQ+ Americans the critical 
protections under the Civil Rights Act as well 
as the Global Respect Act to deny visas to 
perpetrators of human rights abuses against 
LGBTQ individuals. The Equality Act is a land-
mark piece of legislation that eliminates dis-
crimination in every major aspect of life, in-
cluding education, housing, and federal fund-
ing programs that have historically excluded 
members of the LGBTQ+ community. The 
Senate should act quickly to pass these im-
portant bills to protect LGBTQ individuals in 
our country and internationally. 
As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Worker and Family Support with jurisdiction 
over child welfare, I am committed to pro-
tecting foster youth and foster parents from 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity. I worked with my late friend 
and colleague, John Lewis, to investigate the 
inappropriate waivers of nondiscrimination 
rules granted during the Trump Administration 
that promoted discrimination against foster 
youth and prospective foster parents. A critical 
step to protecting foster youth is enacting my 
legislation—the 
John 
Lewis 
Every 
Child 
Deservers a Family Act—that would prohibit 
any entity that receives federal child welfare 
funds from discriminating against children, 
youth, families of origin, kin, or prospective 
adoptive or foster parents based on religion, 
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or 
marital status. Unfortunately, LGBTQ+ youth 
are overrepresented in the foster care system. 
An estimated one in three foster youth identify 
as LGBTQ+, and they are more likely to expe-
rience poor treatment, discrimination, or vio-
lence while in care. This bill helps increase the 
number of supportive, loving, and permanent 
homes for foster youth. 
I am troubled by the recent wave of anti- 
LGBTQ+ legislation that threatens the safety, 
health, and equal rights of LGBTQ+ individ-
uals, policies that restrict access to healthcare

and permit discrimination by public/private in-
stitutions and businesses against members of 
the LGBTQ+ community in various ways. 
Leaders in my home state of Illinois are work-
ing to protect the rights of members of the 
LGBTQ+ community. Unfortunately, not every 
state offers protection to everyone. I will con-
tinue to support my state’s efforts and to ad-
vance federal efforts to promote equality and 
protect the civil rights of the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity. 
I encourage those in my home City of Chi-
cago, my state of Illinois, and across our 
country to embrace Pride Month, join in advo-
cacy for LGBTQ+ rights, and embrace equal-
ity. And, if you’re in Chicago, I encourage you 
to celebrate Pride via a number of wonderful 
events, including Pride Fest, the Chicago 
Pride Parade, the Pride in the Park music fes-
tival, Navy Pier Pride with wonderful family ac-
tivities, or the Proud to Run 5k/10k or half

HONORING 
LIEUTENANT 
ERIKA 
CASTELLUCCI 
AS 
A 
DISTIN-
GUISHED LEADER IN CENTRAL 
FLORIDA FOR PRIDE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Lieutenant 
Erika Castellucci is a true Floridian having 
been raised in South Florida. She graduated 
from Florida State University and worked as a 
senior legal assistant for the capital appeals 
division of the Florida Attorney General’s Of-
fice. After a few years, she found a passion to 
take a more proactive approach and put her-
self through the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement 
Academy. While in the academy, she was re-
cruited to join the Kissimmee Police Depart-
ment, where she has risen to the rank of lieu-
tenant after 16 years of service. 
Lieutenant Castellucci proudly identifies as a 
lesbian and has been a member of the 
LGBTQ community for as long as she can re-
member. As part of her community outreach, 
she collaborated with The Center in Kis-
simmee as soon as it opened. Lieutenant 
Castellucci has been used as a member of the 
Kissimmee Police Department to highlight the 
progressive stance the City of Kissimmee 
takes for all LGBTQ members. She also 
served on the board for GOAL CFL for 2 
years. 
During her 16 years at the Kissimmee Po-
lice Department, Lieutenant Castellucci has 
never ignored opportunities to help other 
LGBTQ members in need. Having her own 
coming out story from growing up helped drive 
her motivation to assist anyone struggling to 
make sure they knew the resources available 
to them and at times just be an ear to listen 
to their own struggles. One of her proudest 
moments was having the opportunity to march 
in the 2021 Orlando Pride parade hand in 
hand with her fiance as people showered all 
law enforcement with support. In those mo-
ments, it shows that we are all human with our 
own stories to be proud of. 
HONORING NEAL EWALD 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of Neal Ewald as he re-
tires from a long and productive career with 
Green Diamond Resource Company (GDRC). 
Mr. Ewald’s 45-year career in the Northern 
California timber industry has been marked by 
efforts to improve timber management, envi-
ronmental protections, and business practices. 
Starting as a forester and logging engineer 
with Arcata Redwood Co. in 1978, Mr. Ewald 
went on to become the company’s Resource 
Manager. He was then hired by Simpson Tim-
ber Co. as Resource Manager, and was later 
promoted to General Manager. In these roles, 
Mr. Ewald played a critical role in the acquisi-
tion of Arcata Redwood Co., as well as the 
development of Simpson’s Habitat Conserva-
tion Plan for the protection of northern spotted 
owls. He was part of the team that restruc-
tured Simpson Timber Co. into GDRC, and 
was appointed vice president of California 
Timberlands in 2003. 
During his time as vice president and Gen-
eral Manager of GDRC, the company adopted 
the ambitious Aquatic Habitat Conservation 
Plan, which guided timber practices to con-
serve several protected aquatic species. From 
2008 to 2018, Mr. Ewald worked diligently with 
Western 
Rivers 
Conservancy 
to 
transfer 
48,000 acres of sacred land to the Yurok 
Tribe. Mr. Ewald oversaw the refurbishment of 
California Redwood Co.’s chip export dock, an 
investment in Twin Creeks Timber and pur-
chase of 350,000 acres in five southern 
states, and GDRC’s Marten Safe Harbor 
Agreement and Forest Habitat Conservation 
Plan. 
Promoted to senior vice president in 2019, 
Mr. Ewald helped GDRC acquire 293,000 
acres in Montana, and form the Montana 
Timberlands Division and its Native Fish Habi-
tat Conservation Plan. With a 90,000-acre ex-
pansion of Twin Creeks in 2021, GDRC now 
owns and manages 2.2 million acres in 10 
states. 
A consummate traveler, scuba diver, pilot, 
and family man, Mr. Ewald has served as a 
volunteer for numerous timber and agriculture 
advocacy organizations, and as a board mem-
ber of Hospice of Humboldt, Humboldt State 
University, the Humboldt Area Foundation, 
and the Eureka Chamber of Commerce. 
Madam Speaker, Neal Ewald’s many con-
tributions to the North Coast community as a 
leader for Green Diamond Resource Co. will 
leave a lasting impression for generations. 
Please join me in congratulating him on a 
prosperous career and an exciting and mean-
ingful retirement.

AMERICAN PORT ACCESS 
PRIVILEGES ACT OF 2022 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘American Port Access Privi-
leges Act of 2022,’’ with my friend and col-
league Congressman JIM COSTA (D–CA). The 
COVID–19 pandemic exposed the short-
comings in the international ocean shipping in-
dustry and the global supply chain. Congress 
must restore fairness at our ports for American 
exporters to help reduce the United States’ 
longstanding trade imbalance with countries 
like mainland China. Our legislation seeks to 
do just that, building upon my bipartisan 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 (Public 
Law 117–146) signed by President Biden on 
June 16, 2022. 
Foreign-flagged vessels’ access to the 
American market and its consumers is a privi-
lege, not a right. Even during a global pan-
demic, multinational companies looking to off-
load foreign-made products at West Coast 
ports must provide opportunities for American 
exports in return. California’s agricultural ex-
porters, manufacturers, and other businesses 
are willing to pay to ensure their products 
reach emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific. 
Dozens of agricultural exporters have con-
tacted my office reporting that ocean carriers 
simply refused to accept cargo bookings for 
American exports, instead sending containers 
back empty to East Asia as quickly as pos-
sible. Congress must ensure reciprocity in 
trade and the ocean shipping industry, which 
is dominated by a handful of foreign-flagged 
ocean carriers. Some of these foreign ocean 
carriers are effectively state-controlled enter-
prises. 
Our ‘‘American Port Access Privileges Act’’ 
would correct the structural disadvantages fac-
ing American exporters at our nation’s ports 
by rewarding ocean carriers that serve both 
importers and exporters. First, the bill would 
codify the current preferences for military, 
Jones Act, and other U.S.-flagged vessels in 
place at many major American ports. Second, 
the bill would establish a secondary berthing 
preference for ocean-going commercial ves-
sels servicing multiple ports in the United 
States or with significant cargo bookings of 
American exports. 
This new preferential berthing will reward 
ocean carriers that serve both importers and 
American exporters by moving those vessels 
to the front of the queue for unloading and 
loading. It will similarly incentivize ocean car-
riers to make second-leg voyages to ports like 
the Port of Oakland, which is critical for Cali-
fornia’s agricultural exporters. Any port author-
ity seeking federal funding from the Maritime 
Administration’s port infrastructure develop-
ment grant program would be required to ac-
cept these berthing preferences. 
However, our bill ensures that the new pref-

carrying-vessels would never interfere with 
U.S. Coast Guard orders for commercial ves-

the international shipping industry is variable 
and that cargo bookings often change last 
minute, requiring ocean carriers, port opera-
tors, and maritime workers to remain flexible. 
That is why our American Port Access Privi-
leges Act would require that export-carrying 
vessels seeking preferential berthing report 
cargo bookings at least 7 days in advance to 
port operators. 
Lastly, our bill would authorize the U.S. De-

preferential berthing afforded under our bill. A 
similar data-collection provision sponsored by

container and chassis availability is incor-
porated as Section 16 (Dwell Time Statistics) 
of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022

Madam Speaker, I urge all members to co-
sponsor the American Port Access Privileges 
Act to ensure fair trade for U.S. businesses 
and keep hard-won foreign markets accessible 
to California’s agricultural exporters. As a sen-
ior member of the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and the 
former ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation 
from the 113th to the 115th Congresses, I 
plan to make this legislation a major priority.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF AMY LANGDON 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Amy Langdon on the occa-
sion of her 100th birthday. Her contributions to 
our community as a Rosie the Riveter are 
worthy of commendation. 
Born on July 25, 1922, Mrs. Langdon was 
born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, she at-
tended Northern High School until her family 
moved to Huntington Woods, Michigan prior to 
her senior year. She graduated from Royal 
Oak High School in 1940. She later attended 
Michigan State University where she studied 
History. During her summers off from college 
she worked at Hudson’s in Downtown Detroit. 
In 1943 she was offered the opportunity to 
serve her country and work at the Highland 
Park Ford plant where she did the electrical 
wiring on the M–5 Director, which determined 
the altitude of an aerial targets. Working on 
this confidential project, she didn’t know the 
names of the other women she worked with 
and wasn’t able to tell her family about her 
top-secret job. She played a critical role in 
supporting American troops overseas and pro-
vided for the defense of our soldiers during 
World War II. As one of the original Rosie the 
Riveters, Amy’s hard work, grit, and patriotism 
not only sustained the American war effort, but 
paved a path for the next generation of work-
ing women. 
While attending Michigan State University 
she met her husband, who served in the 
United States Air Force. She traveled to the 
military base by train on her own and they 
married on March 20, 1945. Together they 
spent their life raising their family and travel-
ling to over fifty-five countries. In her spare 
time, she is an avid golfer, puzzle enthusiast, 
and talented oil painter. The longest running 
volunteer in Beaumont hospital history, she 
has delivered mail to patients for over forty- 
five years until COVID hit. An active member 
of her community and a friend to all, she is a 
longtime member of Philanthropic Educational 
Opportunities for Women and multiple garden 
clubs. Beloved by her family, she made sure 
that she hosted Thanksgiving every year. The 
biggest Michigan State sports fan, she never 
misses a football or basketball game. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Amy Langdon on her 
100th birthday. I join with her family—including 
her two children, two grandchildren, and two 
great grandchildren and friends in extending 
my best and warmest wishes to her on this 
special day and as they dedicate a rosebush 
in her honor at the Ross McFadden House in 
Dearborn. I am proud to honor her life, her ac-
complishments, and her invaluable contribu-
tions to our nation as a Rosie the Riveter. 
Today we should all live by her motto as we 
celebrate one hundred years of Amy—Yester-
day is gone, tomorrow isn’t here yet, I live for 
today.

HONORING MR. PEDRO ‘‘PETE’’ 
MORALES 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life achievements of Mr. Pedro 
‘‘Pete’’ Morales, in celebration of his 80th 
birthday. Born June 22, 1942, Mr. Morales has 
selflessly served his community in Red Hook, 
Brooklyn for over 73 years. 
When he was a boy, Pete Morales’ family 
was one of the first from Puerto Rico to move 
into Red Hook public housing. Being a minor-
ity among Irish and Italian immigrants made 
them a target. Pete’s father had to send his 
son back to Puerto Rico for a period after 
Pete’s younger brother Nelson was badly 
beaten. Nevertheless, Pete returned to Red 
Hook to box every one of his brother’s 
attackers and grew to get along with every-
body regardless of nationality or ethnicity. Ev-
eryone grew to love Pete. 
As Commissioner of the Red Hook Youth 
baseball league, Pete Morales coached gen-
erations of kids growing up in his beloved 
community. Pete has also been a voice for 
tenant rights, affordable housing and served 
as an active member of Fifth Avenue Commit-
tee’s advisory board for new affordable hous-
ing in the neighborhood. Pete has also been 
a tireless advocate for the environment and 
better neighborhood conditions through Red 
Hook Groups Against Garbage Sites (GAGS) 
which fought a massive trash incinerator and 
countless solid waste transfer stations seeking 
to cluster in the community which were suc-
cessfully reversed. Mr. Morales has long 
served at Visitation Church as a Eucharistic 
Minister and continues to be a recognized 
elder. 
Mr. Morales remains a solid pillar of the 
community, well respected by generations of 
neighbors, leaders, and the local clergy from 
his decades of community service. Through 
his life-long dedication to his community, Pete 
Morales has made Red Hook a better place to 
live. I thank Mr. Pedro Morales for his public 
service and offer him best wishes for a well- 
deserved and happy 80th birthday.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PELL GRANT 
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 50th Anniversary of the Pell 
Grant Program. 
In 1972, Congress amended the Higher 
Education Act by creating the Basic Edu-
cational Opportunity Grant to provide direct fi-
nancial aid to low-income students so they 
would have the same access to higher edu-
cation and opportunity for success as their 
higher income peers. But this process was not 
without its trials and tribulations. It is not lost 
on me the incredible tenacity of the late Lois 
Dickson 
Rice—the 
‘‘mother 
of 
the 
Pell 
Grant’’—whose work with the College En-
trance Examination Board was instrumental in 
the creation of the Basic Education Oppor-
tunity Grant later named the Pell Grant for its 
original sponsor, the late Senator Claiborne 
Pell, Democrat from Rhode Island. 
I want to take a moment to speak about a 
constituent of mine who is spending her sum-
mer working in my office, Fatimah Toure. She 
is a rising senior at Seton Hall University 
studying political science and Africana Stud-
ies. She is one of over 27,000 Pell Grant re-
cipients in New Jersey’s 10th congressional 
district and a scholar of the campus-based 
Equal Opportunity Program (EOP). As a first 
generation American and low-income student, 
the Pell Grant has allowed Fatimah to achieve 
and complete her higher education without fi-
nancial worries. She told me that ‘‘College 
was always part of my plan, but I didn’t know 
how to pay for it. I didn’t want to burden my 
parents and be the reason they couldn’t retire, 
but I also didn’t want to take out thousands of 
dollars in loans. The Pell Grant assisted me 
and my family in ensuring we can achieve our 
American dream.’’ By virtue of qualifying for 
the Pell Grant, Fatimah and 49 other low-in-
come students were admitted into Seton Hall’s 
EOP, where they were enrolled in intensive 
academic courses and formed long-lasting 
bonds over a 6-week period before they 
began their freshman year. Not only did the 
Pell Grant and Educational Opportunity Pro-
gram provide financial assistance for Fatimah, 
but she was also afforded academic support: 
tutoring, structured study, academic advise-
ment, summer courses, community service op-
portunities, internships, and counseling serv-
ices throughout her college experience. 
The program leveled the playing field, so 
Fatimah was not financially, academically, or 
socially isolated. The benefits of the Pell Grant 
have not only served Fatimah, but also two of 
her siblings, one of whom is a graduate from 
Rowan University, and the other a rising sen-
ior at Rutgers University. To date, more than 
80 million students have received a Pell Grant 
to go to college since the program’s creation. 
Currently, nearly 7 million students are going 
to college with Pell Grants, or about 40 per-
cent of undergraduate students. 
In New Jersey’s 10th district, 27,085 stu-
dents receive nearly $121 million to pursue 
their higher education goals at our local col-
leges. Rutgers University, with one of its cam-
puses located in Newark within my district, 
has more than 18,000 Pell recipients, pro-
viding over $91 million in aid each year to stu-
dents. Roughly 60 percent of Rutgers—New-
ark students receive Pell Grants, which is in-
strumental in their pursuit of higher education. 
During this month as we celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the Pell Grant program, I en-
courage the United States to celebrate ‘‘Na-
tional Pell Grant Day,’’ recognizing the current 
students and successful graduates who have 
benefited from the program by telling their stu-
dent success stories and encouraging the 
same access for future students. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to Congress 
continuing the bipartisan support for low-in-
come student access to college through the 
Pell Grant for another 50 years. I am proud to 
join many of my colleagues on the bipartisan 
resolution declaring June 23, 2022, National 
Pell Grant Day this year, and in many years 
in the future. 
RECOGNIZING 
JEROME 
‘‘BIG 
DUCK’’ 
SMITH, 
CIVIL 
RIGHTS 
PIONEER AND FREEDOM RIDER 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Jerome ‘‘Big Duck’’ 
Smith, a New Orleans Native Civil Rights Pio-
neer and Icon of the Freedom Riders. 
Jerome ‘‘Big Duck’’ Smith, a life-long resi-
dent of New Orleans, Louisiana, is considered 
a stalwart of the Civil Rights Movement locally 
and nationally. 
It was 72 years ago that Jerome Smith, then 
10 years old, removed the screen that acted 
as a barrier between white and black pas-
sengers on a New Orleans streetcar. ‘‘The 
streetcar became very hostile,’’ Smith recalls. 
The event took place 5 years before Rosa 
Parks energized the civil rights movement on 
December 1, 1955, when she refused to give 
up her bus seat to a white passenger in Mont-
gomery, Alabama. 
Smith says that as he sat in the white sec-
tion of the streetcar in Louisiana, an older 
black woman from the rear of the car de-
scended on him, hitting him so hard that ‘‘It 
felt like there was a bell ringing in my head.’’ 
The woman loudly said she would teach the 
boy a lesson, telling him, ‘‘You should never 
do that, disrespect white people. You have no 
business trying to sit with them.’’ 
She forced Smith off the streetcar, and 
around the back of an auto store. But once 
they were behind the building, the woman’s 
tone changed. ‘‘Never, ever stop,’’ the woman 
told Smith as she began to cry. ‘‘I’m proud of 
you,’’ she said. ‘‘Don’t you ever quit.’’ 
Smith’s involvement in the Civil Rights 
Movement dates back to the late 1950s when 
he joined the New Orleans chapter of the 
Congress of Racial Equality (‘‘CORE’’) as a 
19-year-old student at Southern University of 
New Orleans. From boycotting stores that re-
fused to hire or serve Blacks to sit-ins along 
Canal Street, CORE’s substantial contributions 
were integral to the Civil Rights Movement 
from 1960 onward. Speaking of CORE, the 
late Rudy Lombard stated, ‘‘They had ‘a cer-
tain confidence,’ . . . because they came out 
of a culture that was so rich. They knew that 
everything that was unique about the city 
could be traced to the Black presence.’’ 
Thereafter, Smith challenged Federal de-
segregation laws across the South as a mem-
ber of the Freedom Riders. Throughout his 
travels, Smith participated in numerous pro-
tests that resulted in battle wounds. In fact, 
Smith had been beaten at least 12 times by 
mobs or police during the struggle. On May 
24, 1963, Smith met with Attorney General 
Robert Kennedy and a host of celebrities and 
civil rights leaders in New York City to discuss 
the state of civil rights in the United States. 
During this meeting, it is said Smith emotion-
ally told the United States’ Attorney General, 
‘‘I’ve seen you guys [from the Justice Depart-
ment] stand around and take notes while 
we’re being beaten.’’ Despite grave injustice 
and adversity of the times, Smith made a pro-
found impact on civil rights history. 
Beyond the Civil Rights Movement, Smith 
continued to impact our city, particularly in the 
Treme Community in New Orleans, Louisiana.

June 28, 2022 
In 1968, Smith founded Tambourine and Fan 
to instill important culture, history, and tradition 
in New Orleans youth. He continues to teach 
classes modeled on those of the Freedom 
Schools during the 1964 Freedom Summer. 
‘‘Children in the Center recite lyrics of ‘Strange 
Fruit,’ the names of the four young girls killed 
in the Birmingham, Alabama Church-fire of 
1963, the Neville Brothers’ ‘Sister Rosa,’ and 
chants of Mardi Gras Indians who will ‘not bow 
down.’ ’’ 
Jerome Smith has mentored multitudes of 
individuals across the city for decades and 
continues to do so. Smith is the definition of 
a true warrior, and his legacy continues to in-
spire people everywhere. 
If it was not for the courage of this stellar 
man, I have to wonder if I would be allowed 
to stand before you today. For that, I am be-
yond humble to stand on his shoulders leading 
the constituents of Louisiana’s 2nd Congres-
sional District. The world could never thank 
him enough for all he has done in his lifetime. 
A huge thank you to Louisiana’s adopted son 
as he continues his fight to stand for the rights 
of equal justice.

HONORING VERSAILLES, 
KENTUCKY 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the city of Versailles, Kentucky, on its 230th 
anniversary. 
Located in Woodford County, Versailles was 
founded June 23rd, 1792. This was only 22 
days after the Commonwealth of Kentucky 
was accepted into statehood. The city was lo-
cated on 80 acres of land that was owned by 
Hezekiah Briscoe, who at that time was only 
a child. It was named for Versailles, France, in 
honor of General Lafayette and his contribu-
tions to the victory in the American Revolution. 
Versailles is located in the beautiful Central 
Kentucky area. The area is renowned for its 
thoroughbred horse farms, bourbon distilleries, 
and small-town charm. Over its history, 
Versailles has been home to military leaders, 
artists, actors, athletes, and politicians. Tour-
ists from all over the world visit this beautiful 
town, with the most famous visitors including 
Queen Elizabeth II and President George 
H.W. Bush. Versailles is currently led by 
Mayor Brian Traugott. 
Thank you to the Woodford County Histor-
ical Society for preserving the history of this 
wonderful town and for organizing the 230th 
anniversary celebration. As the citizens of 
Versailles remember their history, I wish them 
all the best for a bright future.

ANTICIPATING U.S. VS. WALES IN 
THE WORLD CUP 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to offer congratulations ahead of this year’s 
World Cup in November. For the first time in 
8 years, the U.S. men’s national soccer team 
has qualified for the most important tour-
nament in world soccer. As the Chairman of 
the Congressional Friends of Wales Caucus, I 
would also like to congratulate Wales on 
reaching the World Cup for the first time since 
1958. 
The historic links between the United States 
and Wales are very strong. The Welsh were 
among the early settlers to North America to 
pursue religious liberty and the opportunity to 
create a better life for themselves and their 
descendants. At least five signers of the Dec-
laration of Independence had a Welsh back-
ground, including its primary author, Thomas 
Jefferson. By now there are endless links be-
tween the United States and Wales, from eco-
nomic to academic to cultural connections. 
On November 21, 2022, a new link will be 
created. The countries will face each other in 
the first match of their World Cup cam-
paigns—and it will be the first time the United 
States and Wales have faced each other in a 
World Cup. This day will be a special day for 
Americans, Welsh, and Welsh-Americans all 
around the world to come together and cele-
brate what both countries have achieved. 
As one of the millions of Welsh-Americans, 
I look forward to cheering both countries in the 
World Cup—albeit on November 21 I will be 
supporting the United States.

make our community a more inclusive and 
welcoming place. Through his work, Lee has 
inspired many others to join in his efforts to 
support the LGBTQ+ community. 
Kevin Lee is the Chair and a Founding 
Member of the San Diego Queer Asian, Pa-
cific Islander, Middle Eastern, and Desi Amer-
ican (QAPIMEDA) Coalition. In this capacity, 
Lee works with his QAPIMEDA leadership 
team to build out programming and a sense of 
belonging for the LGBTQ+ API community in 
San Diego. Now more than ever it is important 
that all LGBTQ+ members of our community 
feel welcome and have the support they need, 
and I am grateful for Kevin’s work to foster 
that in our region. 
Kevin Lee also serves as Environmental Im-
pact 
and 
Compliance 
Specialist 
at 
Dr. 
Bronner’s, a local organic body care and food 
company. In this position, Lee works to ad-
vance green initiatives, monitors the com-
pany’s environmental impact, manages envi-
ronmental compliance, and co-chairs the Dr. 
Bronner’s Green Team. As we work to combat 
the 
climate 
crisis, 
companies 
like 
Dr. 
Bronner’s must lead the way in reducing their 
environmental footprint and help protect our 
planet for future generations, and I am proud 
of people like Kevin who are doing that work 
every day. 
Through his work as an environmental rights 
and LGBTQ+ advocate, Kevin has dedicated 
countless hours to better our community and 
inspired many others to join in his efforts. Dur-
ing Pride Month, I am proud to celebrate the 
exceptional work of individuals like Kevin Lee 
who volunteer their time and contribute to our 
unique and beautiful district. I am so grateful 
for CA–49 residents who dedicate their lives to 
the betterment of our residents and commu-
nity, and I am proud to honor Kevin Lee as my 
June Constituent of the Month. 
RECOGNIZING WINDBER BOROUGH 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the Borough of 
Windber as it celebrates its 125th anniversary 
of incorporation. 
The Borough of Windber was established in 
1897. The first people to settle here were the 
miners and energy producers who came to 
our area to mine the metallurgic coal that we 
still use and rely on to this day. Since its be-
ginnings, Windber has grown to be an essen-
tial part of western Pennsylvania—and is 
home to businesses and organizations includ-
ing Windber Hospital, that do incredible work 
for the Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places, Windber has been recognized for the 
important work that was done here which in-
cluded mine the coal, produce the lumber, and 
create the fire bricks that would build cities 
and towns across our region. 
It is an honor to recognize the Borough of 
Windber’s Quasquicentennial celebration, and 
I look forward to continuing to work with resi-
dents and community leaders in Windber to 
bring the resources, tools, and family-sus-
taining jobs that are needed to ensure another 
successful century.

HONORING ANDONI MOLINA BLAN-
CO AS A DISTINGUISHED LEAD-
ER IN CENTRAL FLORIDA FOR 
PRIDE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 28, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Andoni Molina 
Blanco is a pharmacist located in Winter Gar-
den and originally from Spain. After becoming 
a pharmacist in 1996, he decided to move 
back to his hometown in northern Spain. In 
1997, he met Juan Bengoechea—his com-
panion in life ever since and husband since 
2014. 
After almost 20 years of working as a phar-
macist in Spain, the couple decided to start a 
new chapter in their lives and moved abroad. 
In 2015, Andoni started working as a phar-
macy intern in Miami, becoming a licensed 
pharmacist in Florida in 2016. In 2017, they 
decided to move to Orlando after Andoni ac-
cepted a job offer from Walmart Pharmacy. In 
2018, he became pharmacy manager at store 
4159 in Kissimmee, where he enjoys reaching 
and engaging with his patients and the His-
panic community. 
In 2020, Walmart created the Health and 
Wellness Days of Giving—a program where 
pharmacy managers can provide funding to a 
healthcare organization of their choice. This 
gave Andoni the opportunity to get in contact 
with the LGBTQ+ organization, The Center 
Kissimmee, for the first time. That first year, 
two other pharmacy managers joined him in 
supporting The Center. 
In 2021, Andoni continued his support for 
The Center and advocated for others to join. 
This time, a total of five pharmacy managers 
supported The Center. In December of 2021, 
he was invited to participate and represent 
Walmart Pharmacy in the first World AIDS 
Day fair hosted by The Center and the Florida 
Department of Health in Osceola County. 
This year, he participated in the Minority 
Health Month fair hosted by the NAACP and 
the Florida Department of Health. Additionally, 
all 13 Walmart stores in Andoni’s market will 
support The Center in their efforts of pur-
chasing a new van that will offer mobile HIV 
testing around Central Florida. 
In February of this year, Andoni became a 
proud U.S. citizen.
