O Lord, our rock, we take refuge in 
You this morning. Receive us in the 
shelter of Your presence. In all that we 
bring to this moment, may we know of 
the sanctuary You provide for us daily. 
O Lord, our fortress, protect our law-
makers from all peril. May they know 
that Your right hand supports them 
and Your strength covers them. Be 
their stronghold to truth, fairness, and 
justice in their dealings and with each 
other. 
O Lord, our deliverer, our foes are 
too strong for us; their confrontations 
seek to consume us. In these moments, 
may we call on You and rely not on our 
own efforts, for we can do nothing 
without Your salvation. 
Deal with each of us according to 
Your righteousness. Give us Your favor 
and purify our hearts. 
May our lives this day proclaim our 
love for You, our strength and our 
shield. 
It is in Your most holy name we 
pray.

HONORING 
THE 
REMARKABLE 
LIFE 
OF 
PASTOR 
PHILLIP 
AQUILLA BROOKS, II 
HON. BRENDA L. LAWRENCE 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the remarkable life of Pastor 
Phillip Aquilla Brooks, II, a man who dedicated 
his life to public service and to his church 
community for nearly seven decades. 
Pastor Brooks was born on December 21, 
1931, after his older brothers, Jesse and 
Cecil, and followed by his little sister, Barbara 
Jean. In 1949, he moved from Chicago, Illi-
nois, to Detroit, Michigan, to pursue his reli-
gious calling and after meeting the love of his 
life. Phillip Brooks married Doris Brooks on 
February 2, 1952, and they enjoyed an as-
tounding 68 years of marriage. With his wife 
and his mother-in-law, Pastor Brooks estab-
lished the New St. Paul Tabernacle Church Of 
God In Christ in Detroit, which he would go on 
to lead for 66 incredible years. 
Under Pastor Brooks’ guiding hand, the 
New St. Paul Tabernacle Church Of God In 
Christ grew in both membership and ex-
panded its evangelical reach. Pastor Brooks 
purchased the church’s first building in April 
1969. He later established the March of Faith 
Telecast and Radio Ministry, which operated 
for more than four decades, and ministered to 
millions across the nation in homes, hospital 
rooms, and prisons. Adding to an already im-
pressive career of service, Pastor Brooks was 
consecrated Jurisdictional prelate of the North-
east Michigan Jurisdiction in 1975 following a 
recommendation by his mentor, the late Pas-
tor C.J. Johnson, Sr. He served 45 years as 
jurisdictional prelate—the longest serving Pas-
tor in both the Northeast Michigan Jurisdiction 
and in the history of the Church of God in 
Christ in Michigan. In 1984, Pastor Brooks 
was once again recognized for his service and 
elected to the General Board of the Presidium 
of the Church of God in Christ, where he 
served for 36 years. His tenure on the Pre-
sidium was the longest of any Board Member, 
past or present, and he held multiple leader-
ship positions with grace. 
Pastor Brooks’ service did not end at the 
Michigan border. He spearheaded and as-
sisted in raising funds for people affected by 
the 9/11 World Trade Center terrorist attack in 
New York and Hurricane Katrina in New Orle-
ans. Additionally, he also established the na-
tion’s first Blue Cross/Blue Shield Program for 
local pastors, which created the first life insur-
ance programs for local pastors and their 
spouses. Pastor Brooks was also the first Afri-
can-American pastor to broadcast on tele-
vision in Detroit, Michigan—a broadcast that 
aired on WGPR 62, the first Black-owned tele-
vision station in the country. 
Pastor Brooks will be sorely missed, but his 
decades of service in the Church of God in 
Christ in Michigan will never be forgotten. 
CARL F. EIBERGER II 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Carl F. Eiberger II of Gold-
en, Colorado who passed away on March 6, 
2021. 
Carl was born in 1931 and raised during the 
Great Depression, growing up in extreme pov-
erty in Denver. He was able to use his edu-
cation to pull him and his family out of poverty. 
After graduating as valedictorian from St. Jo-
seph’s Catholic School in Denver, he turned 
down a full-ride scholarship to Princeton. In-
stead he studied at the University of Notre 
Dame on a much smaller scholarship, aided 
by his job working in the school’s kitchen as 
a sanitation worker. Carl ultimately graduated 
magna cum laude with a degree in chemistry 
in 1952. He then went on to receive his Juris 
Doctorate from Notre Dame, again graduating 
magna cum laude. That same year, the U.S. 
Department of Justice named him one of 25 
outstanding law graduates in the nation. Notre 
Dame Lawyers Committee News hailed him 
as ‘‘the driving force in opening the lines of 
communication of Notre Dame lawyers and 
aspiring lawyers in Colorado.’’ 
Carl eventually returned to Colorado and 
married Arvada native, Margurette Dickerson. 
The couple later had four children together. 
Carl was an avid outdoorsman and loved to 
hike in Golden, especially on top of South 
Table Mountain. His love of South Table 
Mountain fueled his ongoing and tireless stew-
ardship of the area, including his decades long 
pro bono work to preserve the mountain top 
and hiking trails and prevent commercial de-
velopment. In his honor, Jefferson County 
Open Space has named a trail on the north-
east side of South Table Mountain as ‘‘Carl’s 
Point’’. 
Additionally, his children fondly remember 
waterskiing on Sloan’s Lake every weekend, 
and occasionally piling into the family station 
wagon to drive thousands of miles on road 
trips to see museums, memorials, and events 
that are cornerstones of American liberty and 
progress. Carl’s family road trips included des-
tinations such as the Civil War Memorial, the 
Liberty Bell, and even a satellite launch at 
Cape Canaveral. 
Specializing in labor and employment, Carl 
was a practicing lawyer in the Denver area for 
more than 65 years. Notable clients of his in-
clude AT&T, Proctor and Gamble, Old Bell 
systems, Conoco, AAA and the Denver Post. 
Carl was a devoted and loving partner, fa-
ther, and grandfather. He is survived by three 
of his children, two grandchildren, and long- 
time companion Dr. Carol Schneider.

QUINNE MOFFAT 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO

Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Quinne Moffat 
for earning the ‘‘Best in Show’’ Award and 
third place recognition for her creative and 
unique drawing as part of the 2021 Congres-
sional Art Competition. 
As a first-time participant in the art show 
and a student at Golden Senior High School, 
Quinne created a work of art entitled, ‘‘Adora-
tion’’. This artwork used oil paint and is a 
hyperrealistic oil painting of man looking down 
at his son who is wrapped in a knitted purple 
blanket. 
Quinne spent countless hours and used nu-
merous tools to learn new techniques and re-
fine her drawing skills and education in the 
arts. I appreciate her participation in the com-
petition and the support provided by her 
teacher at Golden Senior High School. 
Congratulations to Quinne Moffat for her 
hard work and participation in the 2021 Con-
gressional Art Competition. I am certain she 
will exhibit the same dedication and character 
in her future accomplishments, and I wish her 
the best of luck going forward.

HONORING LAURIE SCHIPPER AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, as Women’s 
History Month comes to an end, I rise today 
to recognize a strong woman who is a pillar of 
our community. Laurie Schipper is retiring 
from her position at Iowa Coalition Against Do-
mestic Violence. She was nominated by her 
coworkers because of the significant impact 
on their lives as a mentor and supervisor and 
has changed the lives of many Iowans and 
survivors of domestic violence. 
Laurie Schipper joined The Iowa Coalition 
Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) in 1993 
as its only staff person. Much has changed 
since 1993 and in the following 28 years, Lau-
rie has changed her community, ICADV, and 
the state for the better. ICADV is now in 
strong hands with a diverse multigenerational 
staff of 12. 
Laurie received her Bachelor of Science in 
Social Work degree in 1985 from Iowa State 
University in Ames, Iowa. Laurie has worked 
within the Battered Women’s Movement for 
nearly 40 years, prior to Ms. Schipper’s work 
with the Coalition, she worked in a battered 
women’s shelter and rape crisis center in 
Ames, Iowa for 10 years. Over the years Lau-
rie provided technical assistance and training 
to domestic violence advocates and other pro-
fessionals who interface with battered women 
and their children. Laurie served on the Iowa 
STOP Violence Against Women State Coordi-
nating Council, participated in national training 
and curriculum development, and consulted on 
public policy as it relates to domestic violence. 
In thirty years of work, Laurie strengthened 
our domestic violence laws and protections, 
regionalized the state service delivery network, 
and made Iowa a national leader in respond-
ing to survivors’ economic and housing needs. 
Laurie’s leadership style at ICADV was one in 
which she surrounded herself with brilliant 
people and did her best to both challenge and 
support them and always had their backs 
when the going got tough. Ms. Schipper em-
powered and inspired the people around her 
to be the best of themselves. 
It is clear from the praise Laurie has re-
ceived from her friends and coworkers that her 
work with Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Vi-
olence will continue long past her tenure with 
the organization, which is why I am proud to 
name her Iowan of the Week. Please join me 
in congratulating Laurie Schipper for her 40 
years of service to our community.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF STEW-
ART GREGG, SENIOR COUNSEL 
TO ALLIANZ LIFE UPON HIS RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. DEAN PHILLIPS 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and recognize the retirement of Stew-
art Gregg, Senior Securities Counsel at the 
Allianz Life Insurance Company of North 
America following a legal career of almost 35 
years including the last 20 with Allianz. 
Allianz Life, which is headquartered in Gold-
en Valley, Minnesota, is one of the largest 
writers of annuities in the United States. Mr. 
Gregg is currently the company’s leading at-
torney regarding variable insurance products 
and has in the past led the General Counsel’s 
team for all of the firm’s securities business, 
focusing on the development of annuity prod-
ucts which offer lifetime protection for individ-
uals and couples who seek to ensure that they 
can both enjoy their retirement years, and 
leave something to their heirs upon their pass-
ing. 
Stewart has achieved recognition as a lead-
ing expert on U.S. federal securities laws and 
has represented Allianz Life as a witness be-
fore the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion, the Financial Industry Regulatory Author-
ity, and individual state insurance departments 
across the country. His knowledge and pas-
sion to do that which is right for Allianz Life’s 
clients and to protect their needs deserves 
praise as does the education that he provided 
to regulators on complicated issues, which 
greatly helped them successfully understand 
and regulate annuities. 
A graduate of the University of Iowa, Mr. 
Gregg received his Juris Doctorate from the 
University of South Dakota and his Masters of 
Law in Corporate, Finance, and Securities 
from New York University. Early in his career 
he spent two years working at the General 
Counsel’s office of the Securities and Ex-
change Commission where he provided legal 
counsel on more than 170 enforcement cases. 
Stewart and his wife, Kristine, live in Min-
neapolis 
and 
have 
two 
adult 
children, 
Chamberlin and Ada. He is an avid gardener 
and household chef who is also a wine con-
noisseur and coin collector. Stewart is also 
doing his part to support the newspaper indus-
try as he reads at least three papers a day 
and is an expert on any range of subjects that 
emanate from his prodigious memory. 
Stewart’s friends and colleagues say that 
his kindness comes across in all aspects of 
his life, especially in mentoring younger attor-
neys and other professionals within the Allianz 
Life family. 
I ask that the Congress praise Stewart 
Gregg for his professional and personal con-
tributions and for his previous government 
service. Both he and Kristine enjoy traveling 
and I hope that the next chapter of his life 
brings with it good health and happiness that 
would make more adventures possible.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND COM-
MEMORATING THE PASSING OF 
FORMER CONGRESSMAN CARLOS 
ROMERO BARCELO´  
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to commemorate the life of a 
former member of this House who defined an 
epoch in Puerto Rican Politics. 
On Sunday May 2nd, Carlos Romero 
Barcelo´ died, ending an outstanding career in 
Puerto Rico’s political environment, as Mayor 
of San Juan, Governor, State Senator, and 
Resident Commissioner, and even after leav-
ing elected office still an active leader in his 
party and in the cause of Puerto Rican State-
hood to his very last days. He was one of the 
figures that marked indelibly the last 50 years 
of our political scene. 
In his younger years he was part of a group 
of leaders who saw the need for a vision of 
the cause of equality of rights for the Amer-
ican citizens of Puerto Rico. He, a Democrat, 
joined Luis Ferre´, a Republican, to refocus the 
statehood movement towards bringing an an-
swer to the needs of the people for prosperity 
and security and affirmation of their rights. 
In was this group that after many decades 
of virtual one-party rule in Puerto Rico estab-
lished a balance of competitive elections, that 
expanded the use of primaries from local to 
national; that made it a goal to whenever pos-
sible attain equality in the rights and benefits 
of working families. And above all, to promote 
the essential step to equality and prosperity: 
the attainment of Statehood for Puerto Rico. 
That quest brought him repeatedly to the 
halls of this Congress, as a party leader, as a 
governor, and as a participant in the hearings 
processes for the Status Bills of 1989 to 1991. 
Finally, as part of this House from 1993 to 
2001 where he stood out in this effort, includ-
ing his work with Congressman YOUNG on the 
last Puerto Rico status bill to pass the full 
House in 1998. 
Carlos was characterized for his energetic 
presence, for never being timid in expressing 
what he felt or believed, for demanding much 
of himself and of those who worked with him. 
His character was fiery, passionate, and in-
spiring in return strong passion both from sup-
porters and opponents. You could not be neu-
tral about him and he did not want you to be. 
But he also knew the value of teamwork and 
of giving an opportunity to those with potential. 
It was a privilege to know Carlos Romero, to 
work with him, to have followed and, yes, to 
have differed from him—if you had solid and 
respectful arguments, he returned that re-

Carlos was part of a family who lent many 
figures to Puerto Rico’s politics for over a cen-
tury, and whose members we now embrace in 
solidarity in this trying time. It was not always 
easy and public opinion was often cruel, but 
that is the price of service. 
It is the end of an era, and as we celebrate 
the achievements of a former member of this 
House it is also time to reflect and to reaffirm 
our commitment to the cause he stood for. It 
is now up to those who follow in his footsteps, 
to continue the journey towards that cause of 
equality for all, for which he worked through-
out his life. 
May the light perpetual shine on Congress-
man Carlos Romero Barcelo´.

OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Pamela Lopez 
Arreola for earning the Top Drawing Award for 
her creative and unique drawing as part of the 
2021 Congressional Art Competition. 
As a first-time participant in the art show 
and student at Westminster High School, 
Pamela created a work of art entitled, ‘‘Pyr-
amid Within Women’’. This artwork used acryl-
ic paint on glass and is meant to represent the 
differences in how women are treated in soci-
ety. 
Pamela spent countless hours and used nu-
merous tools to learn new techniques and re-
fine her drawing skills and education in the 
arts. I appreciate her participation in the com-
petition and the support provided to her by 
teacher at Westminster High School. 
Congratulations to Pamela Lopez Arreola for 
her hard work and participation in the 2021 
Congressional Art Competition. I am certain 
she will exhibit the same dedication and char-
acter in her future accomplishments, and I 
wish her the best of luck going forward.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
UNITED 
HEALTH CENTERS OF THE SAN 
JOAQUIN VALLEY 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the United Health Centers of 
the San Joaquin Valley’s 50th Anniversary of 
service to the Central Valley. 
In 1971, concerned citizens identified the 
need for accessible and quality healthcare in 
the Valley’s rural communities and formed 
committees to find solutions. Their advocacy 
work established the foundation for what 
would become United Health Centers of the 
San Joaquin Valley (UHC), incorporated later 
that year. 
UHC is a nonprofit organization providing 
comprehensive medical, dental, and commu-
nity health services to underserved commu-
nities in the San Joaquin Valley. Their mission 
is to provide accessible, comprehensive qual-
ity health care to everyone with respect and 
compassion regardless of their ability to pay. 
Today, UHC operates a total of 24 health 
centers in Fresno, Kings and Tulare Counties, 
improving access to care for over 150,000 pa-
tients. During the COVID–19 pandemic, they 
have led local efforts in the fight to limit the 
devastating effects of the coronavirus by con-
ducting 200,000 COVID–19 screening tests 
and providing 55,000 vaccinations in the first 
year of the pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in recognizing the United Health Cen-
ters of the San Joaquin Valley and their 50 
years of committed service to the region’s 
healthcare community.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF COUN-
CIL MEMBER MARK HARGROVE 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor my constituent from 
the City of Chino, Council Member Mark Har-
grove. It is with more than a heavy heart that 
I share that Mark Hargrove passed away on 
March 28, 2021. 
Mark Hargrove served his country in the 
U.S. Air Force from 1983 to 1987, where he 
acquired the ranking of Sergeant. Following 
his service, Mark worked for the next thirty 
years at the California Department of Correc-
tions. Twenty of those years were spent at the 
California Institute for Men in Chino, from 
which he retired as a Lieutenant. 
Mark also played an important role in local 
policymaking. Mark served on the Planning 
Commission for the City of Chino and was 
then elected in 2018 to sit on the City Council. 
Mark became sick shortly after taking office 
but continued to fight for his community: he 
served as the City of Chino’s representative 
on the Santa Ana Watershed Advisory Coun-
cil, the Citizen’s Advisory Committee to the 
California Institute for Men and Women, the 
Chino Valley Unified School District Measure 
G Oversight Committee, and the Chino Valley 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce 
board. 
Such 
unyielding commitment to improving the lives 
of the residents of our community, even in the 
face of adversity, is just one reason we will 
miss Mark. 
Along with being dedicated to his civic em-
ployment, Mark gave his time to supporting 
youth sports and education programs. He 
coached several youth sports and served as 
Chino High’s sports boosters president and 
basketball boosters club president, which he 
also founded. In 2018, Mark received the 
Frank Elder Award, which honors individuals 
who have devoted their lives to the Chino 
community and the student-athletes of Chino 
High. 
Today, Madam Speaker, it is my honor to 
recognize Mark Hargrove for his unmatched 
commitment and civic dedication to the City of 
Chino and to the contributions he has made to 
the greater community of the Inland Empire. 
May he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
VALOR 
OF 
DEPUTY 
SHERIFF 
JASON LOPEZ 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life and valor of law enforce-
ment hero, Deputy Sheriff Jason Lopez upon 
the 20th anniversary of his passing. As a part 
of the Pinal County Sheriff’s Department for 
six years, Lopez used his talent to valiantly 
serve and protect Arizonans and their commu-
nities. Deputy Sheriff Lopez emulated all the 
traits of a selfless public servant as he fought 
to ensure the safety and security we take for 
granted. 
While on duty and serving a lawfully issued 
warrant, Officer Lopez was brutally murdered 
by a suspect who pulled out a weapon unex-
pectedly. The suspect then fled and took a 
hostage and engaged in a gunfight with pur-
suing officers before being arrested, convicted 
and jailed. Deputy Lopez faced the risk all law 
enforcement officers face—the constant threat 
of a dangerous encounter. Deputy Lopez was 
only 26 when he was killed and left behind a 
then 3 year old and a one month old child. I 
continue to be deeply inspired and moved by 
his deep commitment to our nation and its 
laws. May his sacrifice in the face of danger 
serve as a consistent reminder of our law en-
forcement officers’ service to this nation. 
Madam Speaker, I am here to express my 
deepest condolences to the family of Deputy 
Sheriff Lopez and recognize the sacrifices 
made as we approach the 20th anniversary of 
his death. His brave sacrifice will never be for-
gotten by the people of Pinal County, Arizona.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Sheea Sau for 
earning the ‘‘Best in Show’’ Award and second 
place finish for her creative and unique draw-
ing as part of the 2021 Congressional Art 
Competition. 
As a first-time participant in this art show, 
this student from Golden Senior High School 
created a work of art ‘‘Lost in the Madness of 
Uncertainty’’. This artwork is a portrait using 
acrylic paint, prisma color pencil, and gel pen, 
marker. 
Sheea spent countless hours and used nu-
merous tools to learn new techniques and re-
fine her drawing skills and education in the 
arts. I appreciate her participation in the com-
petition and the support provided by her 
teacher at Golden Senior High School. 
Congratulations to Sheea Sau for her hard 
work and participation in the 2021 Congres-
sional Art Competition. I am certain she will 
exhibit the same dedication and character in 
her future accomplishments, and I wish her 
the best of luck going forward. 
HONORING LIN JEFFREY RILEY, 
SR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
hero, Lin Jeffrey Riley, Sr. 
Raised in Senatobia, Mississippi (Tate 
County), Lin Jeffrey Riley, became the sev-
enth child of Daisy Mae Riley and L.V. 
Coppage, born July 29, 1966. He found his 
calling late in life as the founder and organizer 
of the Marks Youth Outreach, Inc. Season 
after season, he lends his muscle to the 
Marks 49ers Athletic Programs. 
‘‘Coach Riley’’, as he is known, has always 
been athletic, lively, outgoing, and creative. He 
was an outstanding student/athlete during his 
high school years. Coach Riley currently holds 
the top record for ‘‘Most Quarterback Sacks’’ 
in a single game at Senatobia High School. 
For three years consecutively, he received the 
Hawks Award for most forced and recovered 
fumbles, quarterback sacks, and pass inter-
ceptions. 
After relocating to Quitman County in 1997, 
Riley worked several jobs. He operated Riley’s 
Hand Car Wash and Detail Shop and coached 
football at the Quitman County Middle School 
and Madison Shannon Palmer High School. It 
was during those times when he got an eyeful 
and earful of recreational activities needed for 
the youth of this area. Because of Riley’s ini-
tiative, enthusiasm, willingness and time for 
these youth, the Marks Youth Outreach Pro-
gram, Inc. was founded and organized. 
Having healthy, educated youth with Chris-
tian values is very vital for this county. Like-
wise, Coach Riley is at the top of the game 
working daily to ensure that these values are 
instilled in the youth of this community. But 
make no mistake he says, ‘‘Success was any-
thing but instant’’. 
A community baseball team was the initial 
beginning and from that other sports programs 
emerged—football, 
basketball, 
tee 
ball, 
cheerleading, and now kickball and flag foot-
ball have been added. Riley credits the pro-
gram’s success to God and lives by the scrip-
ture: ‘‘With God all things are possible . . .’’ 
(Mathew 19:26). 
Surviving 3 major strokes, Riley stills coach-
es and mentors countless of youth and has no 
plans on stopping anytime soon. On Novem-
ber 7, 2020, a field dedication ceremony was 
held in his honor. The football field is named 
Lin Riley Field, located in Marks, MS. 
On February 28, 2015, Lin married his wife 
Tracey Hankins-Riley and is the father of 
Lindez Wright, Terrell Wright, Travis McAdory, 
Kevon Taylor, Trinity Taylor, Lance Johnson, 
King Lin Jeffery Riley, Jr., Lakendrick Ware 
and Tommy Ware. He is a member of Trinity 
United Methodist Church in Marks, MS. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Lin Jeffrey Riley for he 
is the epitome of an unsung hero.

SIONAL YOUTH ADVISORY COUN-
CIL 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in congratulating the 
2020–2021 Congressional Youth Advisory 
Council (CYAC) as the fifteenth year of the 
program draws to a close. 
Over the past year, students from public, 
private, and home schools in grades 9th 
through 12th across Texas’ Third Congres-
sional District participated in my youth pro-
gram as they learned more about our democ-
racy, engaged in policy discussions, and of-
fered innovative solutions to issues of the day. 
From student governments, athletics, fine arts, 
honor societies, and a multitude of community 
and civic organizations, these servant leaders 
proved to be engaged members of our com-
munity both inside and outside of the program. 
Despite the challenges posed by COVID– 
19, students assembled virtually during inter-
active sessions to discuss topics of impor-
tance to their generation in a constructive and 
thoughtful way. These young leaders also cap-
italized on their experience by completing var-
ious assignments and offering feedback on 
current events which corresponded with our 
meetings. 
This year’s students impressed me with 
their knowledge and willingness to engage in 
thoughtful dialogue, even when their opinions 
differed from one another. Now as we con-
clude this year’s Congressional Youth Advi-
sory Council, I am certain this next generation 
of leaders will work towards solutions to better 
our Nation. 
I thank every member of the Congressional 
Youth Advisory Council, for their commitment 
to this program even amidst the uncertainty of 
the world around us. It has been an honor to 
know them and serve them in Congress, and 
I look forward to seeing what each of them ac-
complishes as they go forward.

Month. My district is home to more than 50 
miles of beautiful California coastline, which 
includes some of the most incredible marine 
and sea life. Sightings of whales and dolphins 
off the beach and marina have brought tour-
ists and locals alike to Dana Point for dec-
ades. Making this local phenomenon more ac-
cessible, Donna and Gisele collaborated as 
co-directors of the Dana Point Whale Watch-
ing Company for sightseers to experience the 
magic up-close. 
Their advocacy for local cetacean brought 
joy to all who frequent the city, but Donna and 
Gisele thought bigger, believing the world also 
deserved to know just how special the marine 
life experience in Dana Point is. With their 
combined effort to put the city’s name on the 
map by showcasing the exceptional 450,000 
‘‘dolphin stampede’’ and year-round sightings 
of rare whales, Donna and Gisele worked to-
gether to earn Dana Point well-deserved inter-
national recognition. 
In order to make that happen, the women 
formed a steering committee composed of 
civic, scientific, academic, business and com-
munity leaders, overcame challenges posed 
by the COVID–19 pandemic, and competed 
internationally to achieve the title that honors 
Dana Point’s tradition as a pioneer in marine 
conservation. Due to their diligent work with 
the World Cetacean Alliance (WCA), Dana 
Point is officially recognized as the first and 
only Whale Heritage Site in the Americas and 
one of only four in the world. Better yet, they 
took the extra step to legally trademark Dana 
Point as the Dolphin and Whale Capital of the 
World. 
As a native Southern Californian, I know 
first-hand how incredibly special our coastline 
and marine life are to the community. I’m 
grateful to Donna and Gisele for leading the 
charge in also letting the world know just how 
blessed we are to have these incredible crea-
tures right here in our backyards. As leaders 
in the community, I thank them both for their 
advocacy and trail blazing efforts of bringing 
global attention to the United States of Amer-
ica being home to the most amazing popu-
lations of dolphins and whales like nowhere 
else in the world, especially in Dana Point. I’m 
honored to recognize them both as my April 
Constituents of the Month.

Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Damion Scott 
for earning the Top Mixed Media Award for his 
creative and unique artwork as part of the 
2021 Congressional Art Competition. 
As a first-time participant in the art show 
and a student at Westminster High School, 
Damion created a work of art entitled, ‘‘Extinc-
tion: A Crisis’’. This artwork used mixed media 
including watercolor, pen and acrylic, and it 
depicts the Puerto Rican parrot and hibiscus 
running down the page hinting at their exist-
ence while also addressing the issue of extinc-
tion. 
Damion spent countless hours and used nu-
merous tools to learn new techniques and re-
fine his mixed media drawing skills and edu-
cation in the arts. I appreciate his participation 
in the competition and the support provided by 
his teacher at Westminster High School. 
Congratulations to Damion Scott for his hard

hibit the same dedication and character in his

HONORING 
PRIVATE 
SECOND 
CLASS 
ROBERT 
HAROLD 
SUDBRINK 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the accomplishments of 
an extraordinary man and hero, Private Sec-
ond Class Robert Harold Sudbrink of Youngs-
town, New York. 
Robert was born and raised in Astoria, New 
York, the son of William Sudbrink, an elec-
trician who worked on the World Trade Cen-
ter, and Mary Normoyle Sudbrink, a home-
maker. He is the sixth of seven children. Two 
of his older brothers, William and Thomas, 
worked as New York City firefighters. 
Robert was named after his uncle, Robert J. 
Sudbrink, who also had a decorated military 
career—he received the Silver Star from Gen-
eral John ‘‘Blackjack’’ Pershing for his service 
in World War I. 
Continuing his family’s history of decorated 
military service, Robert enlisted in the Army 
after graduating from Valley Stream South 
High School in 1968 at age seventeen. He 
completed basic training at Fort Jackson, 
South Carolina. He went on to complete his 
Airborne infantry training at Fort Gordon, 
Georgia, Airborne School at Fort Benning, 
Georgia, and Special Forces training at Fort 
Bragg in Fayetteville, North Carolina. 
On July 4, 1969, Robert was deployed to 
the Central Highlands of Vietnam as part of 
the 173rd Airborne Infantry Brigade. There, he 
worked closely with the South Vietnamese 
Army. 
On March 13, 1970, Robert distinguished 
himself in the village of Loc Thai. There, he 
encountered a home in flames and acted on 
his instincts to assist the family inside. Instead 
of waiting for help, he entered the home mul-
tiple times to save a child’s life, the family’s 
food supply, and their personal belongings. He 
also helped the village extinguish the fire be-
fore it could spread to the rest of the village. 
For his heroic efforts, Robert was awarded the 
Soldier’s Medal two months later. 
After the war, he was honorably discharged 
from the U.S. Army and returned home to 
New York City. In 1982, he met his wife, 
Bonnie Sudbrink. Together, they moved to 
Western New York and eventually built a 
home in Alden, New York. 
In Alden, Robert worked as a mail handler 
for the United States Postal Service for twen-
ty-two years. Now retired, Robert enjoys trav-
eling, playing the banjo, and creating artwork 
in his free time. 
He and his wife Bonnie have two daughters, 
both residing in New York: Courtney Lennon, 
an author and historian; and Maggie Matullo, 
an artisan. He also has two granddaughters: 
Gia and Olivia. 
Our country could not be prouder of Private 
Second Class Robert Harold Sudbrink, a fel-
low New Yorker and true American hero. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Robert for his heroism, in thanking him for 
service, and recognizing him as the New York 
27th Congressional District’s Veteran of the 
Month of May 2021.

decades of service to the Huntingdon County 
community as he retires from the Juniata Val-
ley Emergency Medical Service. 
After volunteering for the fire department, 
Dave began his tenure as an EMT in 1979. 
During his time as a first responder, he has 
witnessed remarkable advancements in his 
profession. While the role of EMTs has 
changed over the years, the need for compas-
sionate and capable providers has not. 
Throughout 
his 
career, 
including 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Dave has remained a 
vital and consistent presence in the Hun-
tingdon County EMS community, mentoring 
new EMTs and providing outstanding patient 
care. 
For more than four decades, Dave Peoples’ 
steadfast service has saved lives and bene-
fitted the people of Huntingdon County. As this 
local hero retires following 42 years of service 
with the Juniata Valley and Huntingdon Emer-
gency Medical Services, it is my honor to rec-
ognize his leadership, dedication, and grace 
under pressure. I thank Dave and his family

and I wish him and the Peoples family every

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CENTEN-
NIAL 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
KIWANIS CLUB OF YPSILANTI 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the centennial anniversary 
of the Kiwanis Club of Ypsilanti. I am proud to 
celebrate their 100 years of service to the chil-
dren, youth, and families of our Ypsilanti com-
munity. 
Kiwanis International was founded in 1915 
in Detroit, Michigan. In its early years, mem-
bers focused on business networking but 
changed its focus to service, particularly serv-
ice to children, by 1919. Following this admi-
rable mission of service to local communities, 
the Kiwanis Club of Ypsilanti was chartered on 
April 13, 1921 with 86 members as the 15th 
Kiwanis club in the Michigan district. 
One of the first projects that the Ypsilanti 
Club embarked on, led by a Michigan State 
Normal College professor, was an information 
campaign about the benefits of consolidating 
rural schools in Washtenaw County, which di-
rectly led to the establishment of Lincoln Con-
solidated Schools. Other projects include over 
a thousand volunteer hours spent paving a 
road, cleaning the shoreline, and beautifying 
Riverside Park, a project led by Andrew 
Smith—and finished all in one day. The Ypsi-
lanti Kiwanis also ran the Full Circle House in 
the City of Ypsilanti, a home for those who 
need help getting on their feet after battling 
mental health issues. From building projects to 
their annual Duck Race, generations of Ypsi-
lanti families have served in the club. Their 
selfless hours of service have benefitted the 
entire Ypsilanti community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the 100th anniversary 
of the Kiwanis Club of Ypsilanti. We are grate-
ful for the club’s century of impactful work and 
wish the Kiwanis Club of Ypsilanti continued 
success in service in the years ahead. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
ALFRED ARRINGTON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a re-
markable 
individual, 
the 
late 
Dr. 
Alfred 
Arrington. 
Dr. Alfred Arrington began his earthly life on 
Feb. 3, 1943, in Laurel, Mississippi. The son 
of Mr. Olen Arrington Sr. and Mrs. Johnnie 
Mae (Morgan) Arrington, he was the third child 
in a family of five children. 
On March 26, 1967, he married the love of 
his life, Josie Howard of Cleveland, Mis-
sissippi, and to this union, four children were 
born. 
Alfred accepted Jesus Christ as his per-
sonal savior at a very early age. He often tes-
tified to how the spiritual teachings at Pleasant 
Valley Missionary Baptist Church in Laurel in-
spired his devotion to God. On Tuesday, April 
20, 2021, Dr. Alfred Arrington completed his 
final chapter in his earthly life journey. 
In the fall of 1962, Alfred enrolled at Alcorn 
Agriculture and Mechanical College in Lorman, 
Mississippi. He graduated in 1966 with a 
Bachelor of Science degree in education with 
a minor in biology. In 1964, he was initiated 
into Alcorn’s Gamma Pi Chapter of Kappa 
Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated. In 1970, Al-
fred continued his quest for excellence and 
earned a Master of Arts in education from 
Tennessee State University in Nashville, Ten-
nessee. In 1975, he proudly earned a doc-
torate in education from Oklahoma State Uni-
versity in Stillwater, Oklahoma. 
Alfred’s profound career as an educator 
spanned beyond borders, and his diligence as 
a public servant was immeasurable. Profes-
sionally, his exceptional background allowed 
him to serve as assistant principal, head foot-
ball coach and director of athletics in Lake 
Providence, Louisiana; research assistant to 
the dean of education at Tennessee State 
University; assistant to the dean for minority 
affairs and instructor at Oklahoma State Uni-
versity; visiting professor of anatomy and 
physiology at Delta State University; assistant 
vice president for academic affairs in the Of-
fice of Provost, vice president for academic af-
fairs in the Office of Provost and chairman of 
the Health, Physical Education and Recreation 
Department at Mississippi Valley State Univer-
sity; and adjunct professor and academic con-
sultant at Alcorn State University. 
Dr. Alfred Arrington leaves his cherished 
memories to his loving wife of 54 years, Dr. 
Josie Howard-Arrington of Greenwood; a son, 
William Davis of Laurel; three daughters, Dr. 
Wandra Arrington of Vicksburg, Mississippi, 
Margaret Michelle Arrington of Atlanta, Geor-
gia and Eulette Denise (Jesse) Harris of Chi-
cago, Illinois; a devoted sister, Luella (Jonas) 
Hardy of Laurel, Mississippi; eight grand-
children, Sydney D. Warren of Tuscaloosa, 
Alabama, Jordan K. Warren of Montgomery, 
Alabama, Michael V. Harris and Mason M. 
Harris, both of Chicago, Illinois, William L. 
Davis Jr. and William A. Davis Jr., both of 
Laurel, Mississippi, Taakanesha Davis of Lau-
rel, Mississippi and Erica Martin of Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin; a godson, Rommell Isaac of Con-
yers, Georgia; a host of nieces, nephews, 
grandchildren, great-grandchildren, other rel-
atives, family and friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of the late Dr. Alfred 
Arrington, in which he was a faithful commu-
nity leader, worker and motivator.

LAURYN KARIS JENKINS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Lauryn Karis 
Jenkins for earning the Top Photography 
Award for her creative and unique photograph 
as part of the 2021 Congressional Art Com-
petition. 
As a first-time participant in the art show 
and a student at Wheat Ridge High School, 
Lauryn showcased a photograph entitled, ‘‘In a 
Dream’’. This artwork used traditional photog-
raphy and is a black and white print of shadow 
puppets. 
Lauryn spent countless hours and used nu-
merous tools to learn new techniques and re-
fine her photography skills and education in 
the arts. I appreciate her participation in the 
competition and the support provided by her 
teacher at Wheat Ridge High School. 
Congratulations to Lauryn Karis Jenkins for 
her hard work and participation in the 2021 
Congressional Art Competition. I am certain 
she will exhibit the same dedication and char-
acter in her future accomplishments, and I 
wish her the best of luck going forward.

RECOGNIZING 
CHIEF 
ROBERT 
NEVAREZ FOR HIS SERVICE TO 
THE CITY OF DELANO 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise

service to the community of Delano, California. 
Chief Nevarez has worked in law enforce-
ment for 35 years and spent his last three 
years as the Delano Chief of Police. During

Chief of Police. Dedicated to civic service, he

HONORING TAMMY ROSS AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Tammy Ross and The East Union AS-
PIRE ‘‘More’’ Learning Center in Afton, Iowa 
for the tenacity and persistence they show 
daily to serve the people of their community. 
Tammy, ASPIRE More, and the town of Afton 
are the blueprints for what being an Iowan is 
all about, and what it means to support your 
neighbors. 
ASPIRE More was opened in 2012 after 
they received a 21st Century Community 
Learning Center grant to assist with their origi-
nal funding. Every morning and afternoon AS-
PIRE offers their services to students in transi-
tional kindergarten through the 5th grade. It’s 
on an income-based tuition, and they also 
work with DHS childcare assistance. During 
this time, they offer homework assistance, 
general enrichment activities, and activities 
that help with social and emotional learning. 
Tammy’s original goal was to help the par-
ents of their community by offering before and 
after school support to k–5 students, but 
Tammy and the volunteers of ASPIRE More 
have adjusted their services over the years 
based on the needs of their community. Now, 
not only does ASPIRE offer before and after 
school care, they also provide food and cloth-
ing to their community via their food pantry 
and thrift store. 
Recently, Union County SCICF awarded the 
East Union ASPIRE ‘‘More’’ Food Pantry 
$5,000 towards a crisis grant during this crisis. 
The East Union ASPIRE ‘‘More’’ Food Pantry 
was able to serve hundreds of people in the 
school district in the last seven months of 
2020. With the crisis grant and the generosity 
of local individuals and organizations, they are 
able to meet the needs of the people of Afton 
as they all continue to work together through 
this pandemic. 
Tammy insists that the only way they have 
been able to reach and help so many people 
in Afton is because of the support of the 
school district and the community. When they 
first started the store, there was some doubt 
of it being able to make a dent in the way it 
helped people in their small town. Through the 
hard work of Tammy and the volunteers, as 
well as the support and love from the people 
of their community, however, they built it up 
into something that genuinely reaches and 
helps people. 4H groups, churches, and other 
local organizations have all helped out through 
their time and donations, allowing everyone to 
take part in some way to give back however 
they can. 
ASPIRE considers the work they do very re-
warding, and the community of Afton is incred-
ibly grateful for the way their neighbors have 
all pulled together whenever there is a crisis 
or a need, and the way their fellow Iowans 
seem to always give more than they have. I 
am proud to recognize Tammy Ross and The 
East Union ASPIRE ‘‘More’’ Learning Center 
as my Iowan of the week.

HONORING DR. MICHAEL 
CHIGLINSKY 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Michael Anthony Chiglinsky, a Salem, 
Virginia School Board member, who died on 
April 13, 2021 at the age of 65. Widely and af-
fectionately known as ‘‘Dr. Mike,’’ he left a 
memorable mark on the Roanoke Valley area 
through his care and service to the children 
and families of the region. 
Dr. Chiglinsky was born on August 7, 1955 
in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He attended 
nearby Lycoming College and then earned a 
doctorate in psychology at Georgia State Uni-
versity. He pursued a career as an expert in 
children and family therapy, which brought him 
to Southwest Virginia. 
Dr. Chiglinsky and his wife Joanne founded 
ACA Counseling Services, offering support to 
local youth and families. He had a passion for 
helping children and families, which he further 
fulfilled as a member of the Salem School 
Board. His service on the board began in 
2009, and he rose to vice chairman in 2013. 
Professional expertise, a friendly demeanor, 
and an interest in helping people character-
ized his service. 
Dr. Chiglinsky’s service extended far beyond 
Salem schools and his private practice. He 
often testified as an expert witness in juvenile 
and domestic relations court, assisting in eval-
uating their needs for services. His testimonies 
were always regarded with great value and his 
professional judgement was held in the high-
est esteem in the courts. 
Dr. Chiglinsky is survived by his wife Jo-
anne; his children, Brian, Katherine, and 
Peter; his daughter-in-law, Crystal; his sister, 
Ann; and two brothers, Joseph and Vince. I 
offer my condolences on the loss of this self-
less and service-minded community leader.

HONORING CHIEF JEFF RASCHE 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service of Greenfield Police 
Chief Jeff Rasche. Chief Rasche is retiring 
from law enforcement in Hancock County after 
4 decades of service to his community. 
First hired as a dispatcher in 1984, Chief 
Rasche served Hancock County as a Sheriff’s 
deputy and detective before becoming the 
Greenfield Police Chief. 
Jeff has a passion for helping people and is 
a pillar of the community. I want to wish Chief 
Rasche good luck with all his future endeavors 
and thank him for serving his community with 
honor.

PAUL M. FOSTER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 4, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Paul M. Foster of Denver, 
Colorado who will turn 100 years old on May 
5, 2021. 
Paul was born in 1921 in Waynesburg, 
Ohio. He served bravely in the U.S. Army dur-
ing World War II and was honorably dis-
charged on July 26, 1944, after serving for 
more than a year as a Corporal. 
Paul married his first love, Lola, and they 
have been together for 63 years. After Lola’s 
passing, Paul married his second love, Bev-
erly, 15 years ago. He has two daughters, 
Janice and Beth. 
Paul is a devoted husband and loving fa-
ther, and most enjoys playing the piano in his 
home. Even though he never learned to read 
music, he is very good at playing by ear and 
memory and particularly enjoys playing reli-
gious hymns. 
Celebrating 100 years of age is a tremen-
dous milestone and should be celebrated. It is 
my privilege to wish Paul a very happy birth-
day and wish him all the best in the future.
