RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
night, our Democratic colleagues re-
leased a draft short-term government 
funding deal. Big parts of the draft are 
unobjectionable because they were ne-
gotiated across party lines. Both sides 
of the aisle want to prevent a govern-
ment shutdown that no one wants. 
Both sides want to keep resources flow-
ing to disaster-stricken communities. 
Both sides want to continue time-sen-
sitive support for Ukraine. 
But, unfortunately, our Democratic 
colleagues decided to put in extraneous 
partisan language—in fact, a poison 
pill. This extraneous poison pill is not 
related to keeping the government 
open. It was not negotiated across the 
aisle. In fact, both the Democratic 
chairman of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, Senator LEAHY, and the Repub-
lican vice chairman, Senator SHELBY, 
have stated publicly that this poison 
pill should not be in the underlying 
bill. The poison pill is a phony attempt 
to address the important topic of per-
mitting reform. 
It is much too difficult to build 
things in America and unleash Amer-
ican energy. Liberal regulations and 
redtape are a huge—huge—part of the 
problem. That is why Republicans are

September 27, 2022 
the leaders on this issue. That is why 
my colleague Senator CAPITO has intro-
duced a strong, robust package that 
would actually move the ball forward. 
What our Democratic colleagues have 
produced is a phony figleaf that would 
actually set back the cause of real per-
mitting reform. This is an issue where 
it should be very easy to improve upon 
the status quo, but, amazingly, our 
Democratic colleagues have managed 
to write language that would actu-
ally—listen to this—make things even 
worse. 
Senator MANCHIN’s bill goes out of its 
way to avoid actually amending the 
National Environmental Policy Act or 
any other environmental law. It layers 
new bureaucracy on top of existing bu-
reaucracy. Its new requirements and 
deadlines are paper tigers with no en-
forcement. 
The few parts of this legislation that 
would actually change the status quo 
would take things from bad to worse. 
For example, yesterday, a long list of 
State attorneys general wrote the Sen-
ate a panicked letter explaining that 
Senator 
MANCHIN’s 
language 
would 
‘‘eviscerate states’ ability to chart 
their own land-use and energy poli-
cies.’’ 
‘‘Eviscerate states’ ability to chart 
their own land-use and energy poli-
cies.’’ 
Among other problems, they explain 
how this legislation creates a backdoor 
to sneak through an electricity grid 
takeover much like the Obama admin-
istration’s unconstitutional so-called 
‘‘Clean Power Plan.’’ 
These State-level officials are also 
sounding the alarm about higher costs 
for their citizens. They write the 
Manchin proposal could impose ‘‘poten-
tially back-breaking costs on residents 
who may see no true energy benefit 
whatsoever.’’ 
Democrats’ 
policies 
already 
have 
electricity costs skyrocketing at the 
fastest rate in more than 40 years. The 
last thing that struggling families need 
are more Democratic policies that 
raise utility bills even higher still. 
This phony figleaf is ‘‘permitting re-
form’’ in name only. It was written to 
drain the political will for actual re-
form without creating any meaningful 
change that liberal special interests 
might actually dislike. 
If tepid Democratic support for this 
phony figleaf is all that our colleague 
from West Virginia got in return for 
approving 
yet 
another 
taxing-and- 
spending spree during an inflation cri-
sis, it is hard to imagine a worse bar-
gain for a Senator or for the country. 
So, if the Senate votes today on pro-
ceeding to a bill that has this partisan 
poison pill jammed into it, I will be 
voting no, and I would urge all my col-
leagues to vote no as well. 
This all-Democratic government has 
a smooth and obvious path on govern-
ment funding. The path is obvious. 
Drop the extraneous, partisan language 
and let the bipartisan CR move for-
ward. 
ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
Now, Mr. President, on an entirely 
different matter, this afternoon, those 
of us on the Rules Committee will 
mark up a bipartisan package of up-
dates through the Electoral Count Act 
of 1887. I strongly support the modest 
changes that our colleagues in the 
working group have fleshed out after 
literally months of detailed discus-
sions. I will proudly support the legis-
lation, provided that nothing more 
than technical changes are made to its 
current form. 
I particularly want to thank Senator 
COLLINS
and Senators CAPITO, MUR-
KOWSKI, 
PORTMAN, 
ROMNEY, 
SASSE, 
TILLIS, and YOUNG for their intense 
work with Democratic colleagues to 
get this right. 
Congress’s process for counting the 
Presidential electors’ votes was writ-
ten 135 years ago. The chaos that came 
to a head on January 6 of last year cer-
tainly underscored the need for an up-
date, so did Januaries 2001, 2005, and 
2017; in each of which, Democrats tried 
to challenge the lawful election of a 
Republican President. Obviously, in 
every case, our system of government 
won out. The Electoral Count Act ulti-
mately produced the right conclusion: 
certainty, finality, and the transfer of 
power to the winning candidate. But it 
is clear the country needs a more pre-
dictable path to that outcome. 
This bipartisan bill does not rashly 
replace current law with something un-
tested. It keeps what has worked well 
and modestly updates what has not. 
The bill’s sponsors debated every pro-
vision and found bipartisan consensus. 
Bad ideas were left on the cutting room 
floor. The resulting product—this bill, 
as introduced—is the only chance to 
get an outcome and to actually make 
law. 
Here is what the legislation does. 
It raises the threshold for objecting 
to the electoral count—preserving op-
tions if something incredibly unlikely 
were to happen but ensuring claims 
with hardly any support can’t paralyze 
the process. It makes the already plain 
fact of the 12th Amendment even clear-
er: that the Vice President has never 
had, and will never have, discretionary 
powers over the counting. 
It protects States’ primacy in ap-
pointing their electors but ensures 
they publicize rules actually before the 
election. It rejects unwise challenges 
like creating new causes of action that 
would leave every election up to the 
courts 
and 
create 
uncertainty. 
It 
makes modest technical updates to 
other pertinent laws such as the Presi-
dential Transitions Act. 
And Senator COLLINS’ bill does all of 
those modest but important things 
without capitulating to our Demo-
cratic colleagues’ obsession with a 
sweeping Federal takeover of all of our 
election law. 
So I look forward to supporting the 
legislation as introduced in committee. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
(The remarks of Mr. DURBIN
per-
taining to the introduction of S. 4962 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, here is 
item No. 2. 
For decades, Americans have paid the 
highest prices in the world for prescrip-
tion drugs. On average, we pay nearly 
four times more than the people in 
Canada and other western nations for 
exactly the same drug. This price 
gouging by Big Pharma hurts Ameri-
cans’ health and their financial secu-
rity. 
I have stories sent to me from time 
to time from the people I represent, es-
pecially senior citizens, who tell me 
these sky-high prescription drug prices 
force them to choose between medica-
tions and other basic necessities like 
food and shelter. Phillip has one of 
those stories. 
Phillip lives in a small town south of 
Chicago. He is 73 years old and is a dia-
betic. After having several heart and 
back surgeries, he can’t work any 
longer. He takes several medications 
regularly. Now, you are going to recog-
nize the name of one of them. It is 
called Trulicity—if you watch TV, you 
have heard that one—a noninsulin 
treatment that he uses to control his 
blood sugar and manage his diabetes, 
Trulicity. 
Do you know the 1-month prescrip-
tion cost for Trulicity? It is $2,000. 
So what does Phillip do, who can’t 
work and has a fixed income? He tries 
to cut the pills in half to make his pre-
scription last longer. Sometimes he 
just skips the medication altogether. 
He is not alone. One in five Ameri-
cans does not take the medications as 
prescribed because they are too expen-
sive. In Phillip’s case, even that isn’t 
enough. At the end of the day, he had 
to refinance his home—what a time to 
do it, huh, with the interest rates?—be-
cause here in America, for too long, we 
have found it acceptable to allow phar-
maceutical companies to charge what 
they wish. Not anymore. 
We pressed for decades—both Demo-
crats 
and 
Republicans 
gave 
these 
speeches; this was not just a Demo-
cratic issue—to lower prescription drug 
prices, at least for seniors. Last month, 
we did it right here on the floor of the 
Senate. The Inflation Reduction Act, 
which Congress passed without a single 
Republican vote, is delivering real re-
lief now for families who are struggling 
with high prices. 
A few minutes ago, the Republican 
leader was on the floor, telling us what 
a terrible bill that was, the Inflation 
Reduction Act. He didn’t mention the

fact that it is going to do some re-
markable things. It makes historic in-
vestments to address the climate cri-
sis. That is one thing. It includes in-
vestments in renewable, affordable en-
ergy sources. That is certainly needed. 
These investments in renewable energy 
can save families hundreds of dollars a 
year in energy costs. That is real relief. 
Just as an aside, last month, my wife 
and I decided to put solar panels on our 
home in Springfield, IL. We are not the 
first in our town, but we are certainly 
the first in our neighborhood. They 
predicted it will reduce our electric bill 
by 85 percent a month. Think about 
your own electric bill and what that 
would mean: money in hand. 
There are tax credits to put on solar 
panels. How did we achieve that and 
put tax credits in for heat pumps and 
electric water heaters? We put it in the 
Inflation Reduction Act, which Senator 
MCCONNELL just came to the floor and 
said was a terrible bill. I think you are 
going to see more and more Americans 
making the choice our family made. I 
think they should. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is also 
going to lower healthcare costs—one of 
the biggest items in every family’s 
budget. First, it will begin to let Medi-
care negotiate fair prices for medica-
tions used by seniors. 
Is that a radical idea, that a Federal 
Agency, on behalf of the people it 
serves, 
negotiates 
for 
lower 
drug 
prices? It is an idea that has been at 
work in the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration for years. The VA, our VA, in 
serving our veterans—the men and 
women who serve this country—pays, 
on average, half of what Medicare pays 
for exactly the same drugs now because 
the VA could negotiate and Medicare 
could not. 
The bill which Senator MCCONNELL 
took exception to now gives Medicare 
the power to negotiate lower prices for 
seniors, and 83 percent of Americans 
think that is a pretty good idea. How 
do we get 83 percent of Americans to 
agree on anything? They agree on that, 
as that is a good idea, and 71 percent of 
the people are from the party of the 
Senator from Kentucky. 
Second, the Inflation Reduction Act 
will cap the price Medicare recipients 
pay for insulin—insulin: $35 a month 
for Medicare recipients. That is the 
limit—and it limits seniors’ out-of- 
pocket expenses for all medications to 
$2,000 a year. Remember Phil? Phil was 
paying $2,000 a month for Trulicity. 
Under this bill, which we passed here a 
month ago without a single vote from 
the other side of the aisle, we are going 
to limit seniors’ responsibility under 
Medicare for prescription drugs to 
$2,000 a year. 
By the way, I believe we should cap 
the cost of insulin at $35 a month for 
everybody, not just seniors. Guess what 
radical nation—what socialist nation— 
does that? Canada. Canada does it. 
Pharmaceutical companies still make 
a healthy profit. They just don’t make 
a killing on a lifesaving drug. 
Third, the Inflation Reduction Act 
will curb the outrageous cost increases 
that Medicare beneficiaries pay for 
medications. It does that by tying pre-
scription drug price increases to the 
cost of living. Pharmaceutical compa-
nies that raise their prices faster are 
going to pay a penalty if they do. The 
days of Big Pharma raising prices they 
charge seniors at 5 or 10 times the rate 
of inflation are over. 
Of course, the pharmaceutical giants 
and their lobbyists fought us every 
step of the way. They said: If you put 
limits on the prices we can charge, 
then we are going to have to cut our 
research. 
Guess what they didn’t tell you and 
what our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle did not admit: It isn’t true. 
Studies have found that Big Pharma 
could lose $1 trillion in sales over the 
next decade, and it would still remain 
the most profitable industry in Amer-
ica. By the way, did you know these 
pharmaceutical companies spend more 
money on advertising and marketing 
than they do on research? 
Point 2, did you know that the re-
search that they are using is based on 
research that was started at the Na-
tional Institutes of Health at the ex-
pense of American taxpayers? I am all 
for the National Institutes of Health. 
They use what the NIH develops to 
make new drugs. It is a good thing to 
do, and they are very profitable as they 
do it, so I don’t want to hear that they 
can charge less and that they are not 
going to be able to survive. I don’t be-
lieve it. 
It is not only seniors who will save 
on healthcare costs. More than 14 mil-
lion 
Americans 
who 
receive 
their 
health coverage through the Affordable 
Care Act marketplace will save hun-
dreds—even thousands—of dollars on 
their monthly insurance premiums be-
cause of the Inflation Reduction Act. 
Under the American Rescue Plan, we 
lowered monthly premiums for middle- 
income families and for those with 
ACA health plans. The Inflation Reduc-
tion Act will continue this for another 
3 years, and I hope I am here to renew 
it. No one should go without medical 
care ever but especially not while we 
are fighting a worldwide pandemic. 
Not only did our Republican col-
leagues vote against what I just de-
scribed to you, lowering monthly pre-
miums for families nationwide, but 
they went further and tried in every 
way they could think to gut the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
Two weeks ago, a Federal judge in 
the Northern District of Texas ruled 
that the Affordable Care Act’s require-
ment that health plans offer free pre-
ventive health services, like vaccina-
tions, was unconstitutional. In 2020, be-
cause of the ACA, 152 million Ameri-
cans received these preventive health 
services, with no out-of-pocket cost, 
often resulting in the early detection 
of cancer, heart disease, and other seri-
ous conditions. 
Now a group of Texas residents and 
businesses argues that that just vio-
lates their basic religious liberty—reli-
gious liberty. They picked a judge who 
has been friendly to them in the past. 
This same judge in northern Texas 
ruled that the Affordable Care Act was 
unconstitutional. That was overturned 
by the Supreme Court. Thank good-
ness. 
It has been 12 years since the ACA 
became law. It is long past time for 
both parties to support this effort 
which provides health insurance for 
millions of Americans at an affordable 
cost. We need to bring down the cost of 
healthcare and prescription drugs for 
all American families. 
The last item of good news comes 
from a blog that I read rather reli-
giously by a lady in Maine, Heather 
Cox Richardson. Almost every day, she 
publishes a column for those who want 
to read it. I don’t know if there is a 
subscription cost. She asks from time 
to time if you want to contribute to 
her effort. I do. 
Well, today’s is one that, I think, is 
worth reading and remembering. 
She says: 
A headline in The New York Times today 
read: ‘‘Factory Jobs Are Booming Like It’s 
the 1970s.’’ The story explained that more 
money in the hands of consumers thanks to 
Federal stimulus spending, along with a new 
skepticism of stretched supply lines, has cre-
ated a rebound in American manufacturing. 
Since the 1970s . . . outsourcing and auto-
mation have meant that every recession has 
seen factory jobs disappear [in America] and 
never return. 
Well, there is good news. We now 
know that we have not only regained 
all of the manufacturing jobs lost dur-
ing the pandemic, we have added 67,000 
more. 
Those numbers would be higher if the labor 
market weren’t so tight, a condition leading 
employers to offer higher wages and better 
benefits. 
The other point she makes is one 
that the National Economic Council 
Director, Brian Deese, told reporters: 
‘‘One of the most striking things that 
we are seeing’’ is that American com-
panies ‘‘are committing to build and 
expand’’ right here at home because of 
supply chain concerns. ‘‘Meanwhile’’— 
get this—‘‘the real net worth of the 
bottom 50% of U.S. households has 
climbed 60% [in the last year and a 
half] . . . now reaching $67,524.’’ 
Inflation is a problem. Don’t get me 
wrong; it is a challenge. Gasoline 
prices seem to be creeping down, at 
least in the Midwest. I can’t speak for 
all over the country. Food prices are 
still too high. I have been to the super-
market over the weekend. I know what 
is going on. But we are seeing some 
evidence of progress on the economic 
front, and I certainly hope that it con-
tinues. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this column by Heather Cox 
Richardson be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

September 27, 2022 
SEPTEMBER 26, 2022 
(By Heather Cox Richardson) 
A headline in the New York Times today 
read: ‘‘Factory Jobs Are Booming Like It’s 
the 1970s.’’ The story explained that more 
money in the hands of consumers thanks to 
federal stimulus spending, along with a new 
skepticism of stretched supply lines, has cre-
ated a rebound in American manufacturing. 
Since the 1970s, authors Jim Tankersley, 
Alan Rappeport, and Ana Swanson explain, 
outsourcing and automation have meant 
that every recession has seen factory jobs 
disappear and never return as employers 
used downturns to move operations to coun-
tries with lower wage levels. This time, 
though, American manufacturers have not 
only regained all the jobs lost during the 
pandemic, they have also added about 67,000 
more. Those numbers would be higher if the 
labor market weren’t so tight, a condition 
leading employers to offer higher wages and 
better benefits. 
Biden has made it clear that he is trying to 
overturn 40 years of ‘‘supply side’’ econom-
ics, ushered in by President Ronald Reagan. 
This system was designed to free up capital 
at the top of the economy through tax cuts 
and deregulation in the belief that putting 
capital in the hands of the wealthy—the 
‘‘supply side’’—would lead them to invest 
more in the economy, thus making it grow 
more quickly and providing more jobs. While 
Republicans came to embrace that ideology 
wholeheartedly, in fact it never showed signs 
of increasing economic growth. What it did 
was to move wealth dramatically upward. It 
also made the measure of the economy the 
health of Wall Street rather than Main 
Street. 
Since Abraham Lincoln’s administration, 
which faced a similar economic stratifica-
tion upward. Biden has followed in this tra-
dition. Insisting that he would build the 
economy ‘‘from the bottom up and the mid-
dle out,’’ he, along with the Democrats in 
Congress, bolstered domestic manufacturing 
with measures like the Bipartisan Infra-
structure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act, 
and the CHIPS and Science Act. 
Now, statistics show, that investment has 
paid off. Chad Moutray, the chief economist 
for the National Association of Manufactur-
ers, told the New York Times reporters: ‘‘We 
have 67,000 more workers today than we had 
in February 2020. 1 didn’t think we would get 
there, to be honest with you.’’ 
National Economic Council director Brian 
Deese told the reporters, ‘‘One of the most 
striking things that we are seeing now is the 
number of companies—U.S. companies and 
global companies—that are committing to 
build and expand their manufacturing foot-
print in the United States, and doing so 
based on their view that not only did the 
pandemic highlight the need for more resil-
ience in their supply chains, but that the 
United States is creating a policy environ-
ment that makes long-term investment here 
in the United States more attractive.’’ 
Meanwhile, the real net worth of the bot-
tom 50% of U.S. households has climbed 60% 
since Biden took office, now reaching $67,524. 
One of the things that will continue to feed 
this change is the plan to forgive significant 
student loan debt, especially among low-in-
come Black and Brown Americans. This 
story is hitting the news today after the 
Congressional Budget Office responded to a 
series of questions posed by Senator Richard 
Burr (R–NC) and Representative Virginia 
Foxx (R–NC), both fervently opposed to the 
program. The CBO’s responses to those spe-
cific questions have been widely published, 
suggesting the program will cost the U.S. 
$400 billion. This is sparking cries about its 
expense, but this particular CBO number cal-
culates the cost over the next 30 years rather 
than the usual ten, does not address the 
stimulus effects of the relief, and does not 
take into account how much anyone would 
actually have repaid. The estimate is, the 
CBO states in its letter, ‘‘highly uncertain.’’ 
In contrast to Biden’s economic program, 
on Friday the new government of Prime Min-
ister Liz Truss announced the most radical 
tax cuts in Britain since 1972, cutting the top 
income tax rate as well as corporate taxes to 
spur the economy. This unfunded cut will 
mean borrowing at rising interest rates. Con-
cerns about inflation, already hammering 
the British economy, made the value of the 
pound, which is the English unit of currency, 
drop to its lowest level since 1985. 
These different economic visions are in 
conflict here in the United States. Former 
Trump economic advisor Steve Moore re-
acted to the Truss tax cuts by saying: ‘‘This 
is exactly what we should be doing in the 
US.’’ White House economic advisor Jared 
Bernstein said: ‘‘President Biden has been 
very clear about the negative track record of 
trickle-down, Reagan-style tax cuts.’’ 
Republicans have managed to keep voters 
behind 
their 
economic 
program 
by 
downplaying it and emphasizing cultural 
issues, primarily abortion, which reliably 
turned out anti-abortion voters. Now that 
the Supreme Court has overturned the 1973 
Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, Re-
publicans have a demographic problem: a 
majority of voters support reproductive 
rights and are turning out to vote, and there 
is no longer a reason for anti-abortion voters 
to show up. 
So Republican leaders are downplaying 
abortion: reporter Eric Garcia noted today 
that Republican representative and Senate 
candidate Ted Budd (R–NC), who is a cospon-
sor of the House version of Senator Lindsey 
Graham’s (R–SC) national abortion bill, 
didn’t mention his stance in a recent rally 
with former president Trump. They are also 
inventing new cultural crises, most notably 
an attack on LGBTQIA folks but also a re-
newed attack on immigrants. 
Trump has gone further, jumping aboard 
the QAnon train, which the FBI considers a 
domestic terrorism threat, as his own legal 
troubles are mounting. His lawyers failed to 
slow down the criminal investigation into 
his theft of documents, including many 
marked with the highest levels of classifica-
tion. New York Attorney General Letitia 
James has sued Trump, his company, and his 
children and two associates for fraud. And 
now the House Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. 
Capitol is beginning to turn up more infor-
mation. 
On Friday the committee subpoenaed Wis-
consin House Speaker Robin Vos to ask 
about a phone call he had with Trump in 
July 2022 (not a typo) in which Trump tried 
to get him to change the 2020 result in Wis-
consin. Vos is challenging the subpoena. 
In the lead-up to Wednesday’s midday pub-
lic hearing of the committee, Zachary Cohen 
of CNN reported today that election denier 
Phil Waldron, a former Army colonel associ-
ated with Trump loyalist Michael Flynn, was 
in contact with White House chief of staff 
Mark Meadows in late December 2020 about 
gaining access to the voting systems in Ari-
zona and Georgia. Waldron referred to Ari-
zona as ‘‘our lead domino we were counting 
on to start the cascade,’’ to overturn the 
election. 
Meanwhile, Ginni Thomas, the wife of Su-
preme Court justice Clarence Thomas, was 
texting QAnon links to Meadows. And now, 
after flirting with QAnon since 2020, Trump 
has 
embraced 
it 
wholeheartedly, 
first 
‘‘retruthing’’ social media posts featuring 
him as a QAnon hero and warning that ‘‘The 
Storm Is Coming,’’ then using QAnon music 
at a rally. Now, he has sent out an email 
calling for the death penalty for drug deal-
ers—a favorite theme of fascists since the 
1930s and a major part of the program of 
former dictator Rodrigo Duterte of the Phil-
ippines, whom Trump admires—along with 
the warning that ‘‘Under Democrat control, 
the streets of our great cities are drenched in 
the blood of innocent victims,’’ tapping into 
the QAnon themes of violent retribution for 
those they see as preying on America’s 
youth. 
‘‘I certainly will do whatever it takes to 
make sure Donald Trump isn’t anywhere 
close to the Oval Office,’’ Representative Liz 
Cheney said this weekend at The Texas Trib-
une Festival, which highlights politics and 
policy. ‘‘And if he is the nominee, I won’t be 
a Republican.’’ She warned that a Repub-
lican majority in the House would empower 
Trump Republicans like Jim Jordan (OH), 
Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA), and Lauren 
Boebert (CO). 
And when asked if Trump should testify 
before the committee, Cheney answered: 
‘‘Any interaction that Donald Trump has 
with the committee will be under oath and 
subject to penalty of perjury.’’

positively but I think that’s going to reverse

Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SINEMA). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this 
week, the Senate has one extremely 
important item on our agenda: to keep 
the lights on; in other words, to pass a 
government funding bill. We are just 3 
days from the end of the fiscal year, 
and the Democrat-controlled Senate 
has yet to pass a single appropriations 
bill—no funding for our military, no 
funding for veterans services, no fund-
ing for border security, nothing. 
Now, this deadline does not sneak up 
out of nowhere; it arrives on the same 
day every year. Yet here we are, 3 days 
before the funding expires, and not a 
single appropriations bill has been 
voted on. 
The majority leader conceded a long 
time ago that the regular appropria-
tions bills would be punted to a later 
date and we would pass a short-term 
funding bill to bridge the gap. As a gen-
eral rule, I am not a fan of short-term 
funding bills. They don’t provide the 
stability or predictability we need to 
plan for the future. That is especially 
true for America’s military, which is 
operating in a dynamic threat environ-
ment with countless unknowns. In 
order to plan for and prepare for the fu-
ture, government Agencies need a pre-
dictable budget, and stopgap bills sim-
ply don’t cut it. 
As though this last-minute funding 
gambit isn’t dramatic enough, the ma-
jority leader has raised the stakes even 
higher. He is not putting a clean fund-
ing bill on the floor; he is weighing it 
down with partisan freight. This is part 
of a political horse trade that happened 
a couple of months ago. In order to get 
the senior Senator from West Virginia 
to vote for his reckless tax-and-spend-
ing bill, the majority leader promised 
to attach permitting reform to the gov-
ernment funding bill. Forget the fact 
that Senator MANCHIN’s permitting bill 
was nowhere near complete; the major-
ity leader blindly agreed to tack it on 
to must-pass legislation. 
Senator MANCHIN, the senior Senator 
from West Virginia, finally released his 
bill last week, and it became clear why 
he was so desperate to attach it to a 
must-pass continuing resolution. That 
is because the bill doesn’t even come 
close to delivering the real common-
sense changes that were promised. The 
provisions meant to speed up the ap-
proval process for new projects lack 
teeth, 
making 
them 
unlikely 
to 
produce any real progress. 
The bill doesn’t touch the environ-
mental reviews, which cause a lot of 
delays to happen in the first place. On 
top of that, it is a power grab by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
sion, granting them unprecedented au-
thority to force electric transmission 
lines on States. Under the current law, 
States have the authority to decide 
whether or not to grant transmission 
lines to run through their States. It is 
part of something called State sov-
ereignty, federalism. Under this bill, 
that 
would 
change, 
though. 
The 
unelected leaders at the Federal En-
ergy Regulatory Commission could 
override a State’s objection to a new 
project transmitting renewable energy. 
In short, if a State like Illinois needs 
a new interstate transmission line to 
help meet its clean energy mandates, 
its neighbors will have no choice but to 
oblige. It will be forced on them. Folks 
in Indiana or Ohio or any other State 
could be forced to help subsidize the 
costs of Illinois’ renewable energy. 
This is a far cry from the kind of com-
monsense permitting reform that Sen-
ator MANCHIN has been talking about. 
This bill falls short in almost every 
regard, which is why we have seen such 
broad 
bipartisan 
opposition. 
There 
aren’t many Energy bills where my 
vote aligns with that of the junior Sen-
ator from Vermont, Senator SANDERS, 
but this is one of them. 
Despite the strong opposition to Sen-
ator MANCHIN’s bill, the majority is 
still moving forward with a procedural 
vote this evening. He knows it will fail. 
It will not succeed. Then, Senator 
SCHUMER, the majority leader, will 
have a choice: pass a clean funding bill 
to keep the lights on, to keep govern-
ment open, or shut down the govern-
ment 
over 
their 
reckless 
tax-and- 
spending spree deal cut behind closed 
doors last summer. 
If you remember, a couple of months 
ago, at the same time he professed pub-
licly and privately that the disastrous, 
radical tax-and-spending spree bill was 
dead, the senior Senator from West 
Virginia was negotiating a sweetheart 
deal in secret, unbeknownst to Repub-
licans and, by the way, unbeknownst to 
all Democrats other than the majority 
leader. Fast-forward to today. When 
that deal falls apart this evening, he 
will need to abandon his secret deal 
with Senator SCHUMER. 
For our country’s sake, I hope the 
majority leader and Senator MANCHIN 
won’t shut down the government. With 
so much economic uncertainty already, 
the last thing we need is a government 
shutdown. 
LEGISLATION 
Madam President, this is the last 
week the House of Representatives will 
be in session until after the election. 
Once the Chamber gavels out at the 
end of the week, Members will go 
home, and they won’t return until No-
vember 14. That doesn’t leave a lot of 
time to accomplish the work of the 
American people. In fact, after this 
week, the House is scheduled to only be 
in session for 4 more weeks this year. 
As my colleagues here in the Senate 
know, the House has a lot to do and not 
a lot of time to do it. Since the start of 
the Congress, the Senate has passed a 
long list of bipartisan bills that are 
still awaiting action in the House. 
Many of these bills passed this Cham-
ber unanimously and will provide crit-
ical support for our communities. 
Here is just one example. Last year, 
Senator PADILLA, the junior Senator 
from California, and I introduced a bill 
to support infrastructure and disaster 
relief projects all across the country. 
Our bill would open up billions of dol-
lars for States and local governments 
to put toward their most critical 
projects without adding a penny to the 
deficit. That is because the money that 
would be freed up has already been ap-
propriated for COVID–19 relief but is in 
excess of what the States and local 
governments need for that purpose. 
Our bill would take the handcuffs off 
and allow them to spend that money if 
they want. They are not required to do 
so, but if they want, they can spend up 
to one-third of their excess funds on in-
frastructure or disaster relief, and it 
doesn’t add another penny to the def-
icit. 
Over the last year and a half, I have 
heard from leaders all across my State 
of Texas who are frustrated about the 
handcuffs that have been put on them 
when it comes to spending the money 
that Congress had appropriated for 
COVID–19 relief. Senator PADILLA told 
me he is hearing the same thing from 
leaders in California. So we got to 
work. We spoke with folks in our 
States as well as our Senate colleagues 
and administration officials, and we 
came up with legislation that was sim-
ple but very effective in providing that 
sort of flexibility that our local com-
munities and our States have asked 
for. 
With some places, that means pan-
demic-related 
expenses, 
which 
will

take the priority. Our legislation won’t 
interfere with any plans to spend that 
money on already-approved pandemic 
expenses, but it will give the States 
and localities without that need the 
option to invest those funds in infra-
structure projects. 
Usually, what happens here in Wash-
ington is the U.S. Congress appro-
priates money, and it literally takes a 
couple of years to get the money from 
DC down to places like Austin, TX, 
where the Texas legislators can then 
figure out how to disburse those funds. 
Now, we know they already have the 
money in their hands, but they simply 
can’t use it because of the restrictions 
placed on those funds. 
Senator PADILLA’s and my bill would 
remove those restrictions for impor-
tant purposes, like infrastructure and 
like disaster relief; things like wid-
ening highways, constructing bridges, 
extending 
railways, 
expanding 
broadband. Our bill includes a long list 
of qualifying expenses. 
It also will allow leaders to put their 
funding toward disaster relief, which is 
a major need in areas all across the 
country. Places like Texas and Ken-
tucky, for example, have experienced 
devastating flooding in the last few 
months. Puerto Rico, we know, has 
just been hit by a terrible hurricane 
and is still trying to restore power. 
Florida is bracing for impact of Hurri-
cane Ian as it makes its way to the gulf 
coast. California continues to battle 
destructive wildfires. 
Our bill would allow leaders to open 
up disaster relief funds virtually in-
stantly, as soon as the President signs 
the bill into law. They already have 
the funding in hand. They won’t have 
to wait for a Federal disaster declara-
tion or emergency funding from Con-
gress; they could write the check them-
selves and mobilize resources instanta-
neously. It is no surprise this bill 
passed the Senate 100 to 0. It was unan-
imous. 
These are the sorts of commonsense 
things that will benefit communities 
all across the United States. This bill 
will open up tens of millions of dollars 
for infrastructure projects in commu-
nities all across the country, and it 
will support critical disaster relief ef-
forts as well. It will empower State and 
local leaders to make the best deci-
sions for their communities. It will en-
sure that this funding can deliver on 
its intended purpose, which is to allevi-
ate the financial burden imposed by 
the pandemic on our State and local 
governments. I hope Speaker PELOSI 
will bring up and pass this bill as 
quickly as possible. It would help her 
State of California, but more impor-
tantly, it would help the entire coun-
try. 
But this is just one of many bipar-
tisan bills that are currently sitting in 
the House since the start of Congress— 
the Senate’s unanimously approved 
bills that I have introduced to prevent 
and identify child sexual abuse; to pro-
vide incarcerated individuals with ac-
cess to treatment for their substance 
use disorder; to facilitate more cross- 
border trade with our neighbors to the 
north and the south; to support pro-
grams and help individuals experi-
encing mental health crises; to provide 
tax relief to survivors of human traf-
ficking; to equip law enforcement offi-
cers with the tools they need in order 
to help people in crisis. 
It would be a shame if the Speaker 
declined to bring these bills up and 
pass them. I am sure they would pass 
by overwhelming votes in the U.S. 
House of Representatives, as they did 
here in the Senate. But the House is 
only scheduled to be in session a few 
more weeks this Congress. It is time to 
get moving on these commonsense, 
noncontroversial, 
nonpartisan 
bills. 
Otherwise, we will have to start back 
at square one next year. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

the quorum call be rescinded.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 
a short update on today’s vote for the 
information of all Senators. 
Later this afternoon, the Senate is 
scheduled to hold a cloture vote on a 
motion to proceed to a vehicle for the 
CR. 
Now, Senate Republicans have made 
very clear they will block legislation 
to fund the government if it includes 
bipartisan permitting reform because 
they have chosen to obstruct instead of 
work in a bipartisan way to achieve 
something they have long claimed they 
wanted to do. 
Because American families should 
not be subjected to a Republican-manu-
factured government shutdown, Sen-
ator MANCHIN has requested, and I have 
agreed, to move forward and pass the 
recently filed continuing resolution 
legislation without the Energy Inde-
pendence and Security Act of 2022. 
Senator MANCHIN, myself, and others 
will continue to have conversations 
about the best way to ensure respon-
sible permitting reform is passed be-
fore the end of the year. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
SOCIAL SECURITY 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
the majority leader for those com-
ments and for his leadership on this 
and so much else, including the subject 
that Senator WYDEN and I will be talk-
ing about today: Social Security. 
I rise to discuss an issue that Senator 
WYDEN and I have worked on, and I am 
honored to be part of this with a Sen-
ator who began his career active in the 
Gray Panthers. So his commitment to 
Social Security almost goes back to al-
most before I was born, if I can say it 
that way. 
Everything we do here—everything 
we do here—should come back to the 
dignity of work; the idea that hard 
work should pay off for everybody no 
matter who you are, no matter where 
you live, no matter what kind of work 
you do to support yourself and your 
family. 
When work has dignity, people al-
ways, always, always should have a se-
cure retirement. That means they can 
count on Medicare. It means they can 
count on Social Security. It means we 
protect in this body—Senator MARKEY 
has been very involved in this, too, as 
the Presiding Officer. It means we pro-
tect people’s pensions. It means people 
should make enough to save. 
It is why we saved—this body. I re-
member sitting here with Senator 
CASEY on March 6, 2021, and saying to 
him this was the best day of my career, 
when we voted 51 to 50 to save the pen-
sions of 100,000 people in Ohio, over a 
million workers around the country, 
the same day we passed the Child Tax 
Credit extension, which dropped the 
poverty rate in this country by 40 per-
cent. 
It is why we still fight for the Delphi 
retirees 
who 
lost 
their 
pensions 
through no fault of their own, through 
no wrongdoing of their own, through no 
malfeasance or anything else of their 
own. They lost it because the system 
didn’t guarantee it. It is why we will 
always, always fight back against at-
tacks on Social Security. A secure re-
tirement should never be partisan. 
Social Security and Medicare are two 
of the most popular and most unifying 
institutions in the country. 
Think back. We have had Social Se-
curity since the Roosevelt days. We 
have had Medicare since the LBJ 
days—so 80, 90 years of Social Security. 
The first Social Security check was in 
1940 to a woman in Vermont. We have 
had Social Security for 82 years. 
Medicare, passed by a Democratic 
House and Senate, with some Repub-
lican support joining President John-
son creating Medicare in the 1960s— 
again, two of the most popular and 
most unifying institutions in the coun-
try. 
Social Security is our government’s 
promise to working men and women, a 
promise they will be able to retire with 
dignity. 
Support for Social Security among 
the voters, among the public, cuts 
across party lines, geographic lines, ra-
cial lines. Almost everybody in this 
country supports Social Security. 
Americans want to not only protect 
Social Security and Medicare, but they 
want to make it stronger. 
I said almost everybody in the coun-
try supports Social Security and Medi-
care. Well, Mr. President, as you know 
and Chairman WYDEN of the Finance

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5043 
September 27, 2022 
Committee knows, almost everybody 
except a whole lot of people who come 
to the Senate and, down the hall, come 
to the House of Representatives and 
think their mission is to privatize So-
cial Security and privatize Medicare. 
So why do they do that? 
Well, it is their answer to pay for ev-
erything. How can we afford handouts 
to corporations? Well, the way to pay 
for it is to cut Social Security and you 
privatize Medicare. How do you pay for 
tax cuts for the wealthy? Well, you 
wipe out the retirement security of 
Americans. You cut Social Security. 
You privatize Medicare. That is their 
answer, time after time after time. 
They don’t really want to talk about 
it this close to an election. As soon as 
this election is over, we know the cre-
scendo; we know the loud voices, again, 
from Senator SCOTT, the leader, who 
happens to also run the Republican 
Senate Campaign Committee—the Sen-
ator from Florida who is a freshman 
who believes that privatizing—that we 
should have to renew Medicare and So-
cial Security every 5 years. Like we 
don’t want anybody to feel comfortable 
or be able to plan for the future or to 
feel, like, just secure in their retire-
ment. 
So it is always the same plan from 
the corporate elite and think-tank ex-
tremists. 
So when I said almost everybody, it 
was not quite fair to say it is only Re-
publican 
Senators 
and 
Republican 
House Members. It is also the cor-
porate elite, in many cases. It is the 
people at these rightwing think tanks, 
funded by billionaires, who think this 
is some way that—they come up with 
some new scheme to disguise their un-
popular agenda: privatize Social Secu-
rity or means-testing Social Security. 
Whatever it is, the plan is the same: to 
kill off Social Security. 
This time it is Senator RICK SCOTT 
and Senate Republicans’ plan to termi-
nate Social Security. As I said, they 
want to get rid of this bedrock prom-
ise. It doesn’t matter to them that 
most Americans support Social Secu-
rity. 
That is why, this week, Senator 
WYDEN, who, as I said, began his activ-
ism as an activist for the Gray Pan-
thers in Portland, OR; Senator CASEY, 
who sits next to me, one of the leaders 
in this Senate, a Senator from Penn-
sylvania—he came to the Senate the 
same day I did—who is one of the lead-
ers of this Senate and on Senator 
WYDEN’s committee to fight to affirm 
that Social Security should remain a 
guarantee for every American whom 
we 
want 
because 
our 
government 
should work for people, not against 
them. 
When workers have dignity—when 
work has dignity, we honor the retire-
ment security people earned. It should 
be an easy decision. 
I urge my Republican colleagues in 
this body—colleagues, frankly, with 
healthcare and retirement plans paid 
for by taxpayers—we all have that in 
this body—to think about the genera-
tions of Americans who have benefited 
from Social Security and the genera-
tions to come who are relying on the 
promise of Social Security. 
I have listened to their speeches for 
years extolling the value of hard work. 
I have heard some of them trying to 
run from their own plans to end Social 
Security. But the American people are 
on to Senate Republicans. 
The American people watched as all 
50 Republicans voted against or essen-
tially did nothing to solve the multi-
employer pension crisis. They are 
watching—a few exceptions. Senator 
PORTMAN has been helpful on this, on 
the bipartisan Delphi retiree fix, but 
many are trying to block it. 
The public watches as the Republican 
caucus tries to end Social Security for 
good. 
If the American people don’t need to 
worry about the Republican Senate 
plan to end Social Security, now is 
your chance to prove it. This is your 
chance, by voting—this is your chance 
to live up to your own words and co-
sponsor this resolution that Senator 
WYDEN and I and Senator CASEY are 
leading. 
Show Americans that if you work 
hard all your life, your government, 
your Senator will be there for you and 
that you are not working in this body 
to undermine the promise of Social Se-
curity. 
Senator WYDEN and I have worked to-
gether to protect Social Security for 
years. 
What is at stake with these attacks? 
Why do we need to show a united com-
mitment to Social Security in the U.S. 
Senate? 
Senator WYDEN. 
Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, 
Senator BROWN. And I see in the Chair 
another strong supporter of Social Se-
curity, the distinguished Senator from 
Massachusetts. 
And for colleagues who aren’t aware, 
Senator BROWN is our chair of the Sub-
committee on Social Security in the 
Senate Finance Committee. This is a 
crucial subcommittee for all the rea-
sons that Senator BROWN just men-
tioned, and I am just going to make a 
couple of points, and if my colleague is 
still on the floor, maybe we can have a 
little bit of a colloquy. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. Thank you. 
What Senator BROWN has illustrated 
again is the differences between the 
two parties on Social Security and 
Medicare, and my colleague was kind 
enough to go back to my past as co-
director of the Oregon Gray Panthers. 
Ever since those days, the difference 
between the two parties has been that 
on our side of the aisle, we are very 
blunt when we get asked about Social 
Security and Medicare. As Senator 
BROWN just said, on our side, we make 
it clear that Social Security and Medi-
care are a guarantee. They are not a 
voucher. They are not something that 
is going to be thrown to the private 
market. They are a guarantee. 
What we hear from our colleagues on 
the other side is sort of a word salad, 
but it nearly always involves a state-
ment about how much they want to 
protect Social Security, but then we 
hear a lot about privatization, about 
portability, about investment. 
It is anything but what you just 
heard Senator BROWN say; that Medi-
care and Social Security are not some-
thing to be privatized; they are about a 
guarantee. 
And we should make no mistake 
about it, seniors, others who are eligi-
ble for the programs have earned these 
benefits. They have earned these bene-
fits. 
And yet, somehow, our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle and can-
didates don’t get what the programs 
are really all about. 
For example, not long ago, I saw a 
Republican Senate candidate out West 
say in a primary forum: Congress 
ought to ‘‘privatize Social Security and 
just get the government out of it.’’ 
‘‘Just get the government out of it.’’ 
Now, apparently, he is the nominee, 
and he is for protecting Social Secu-
rity. He swears up and down he is for 
protecting 
Social 
Security—huge 
about-face. 
I heard another westerner asked on 
live TV about his thoughts on Social 
Security. And he said nothing about a 
guarantee. He said: We ought to look 
at portability issues and individual ac-
counts and benefit cuts are on the 
menu. 
Again, this is kind of Washington 
lingo, Washington code for unraveling 
the guarantee that is Social Security 
and Medicare that I learned about in 
those days when I was codirector of the 
Oregon Gray Panthers. 
And Americans don’t want their 
elected representatives to cut this cru-
cial set of programs that are earned 
benefits. And they certainly don’t want 
their elected officials and candidates to 
talk out of both sides of their mouth. 
Now, I mentioned this question of 
westerners and where westerners stand, 
but apparently this opposition to these 
core 
principles 
of 
Social 
Security 
doesn’t just reside in the West. It 
seems to spread across the country. 
Senator RICK SCOTT has proposed end-
ing, again, the guarantees of these bed-
rock programs—Social Security and 
Medicare—and just sunsetting them 
after 
just 
a 
few 
years—sunsetting 
them. 
So as I would say to my colleague, 
who has worked with me on a lot of 
these issues, let’s just unpack that for 
a minute. We believe that Social Secu-
rity and Medicare are guaranteed. 
They are not subject to these annual, 
political kind of battles and pushed and 
prodded for political advantage. They 
are guaranteed. But yet, after quoting 
those in the West who want to come 
join us, now we have a southerner in a 
position 
of 
great 
importance 
who 
wants to sunset programs like Social

Security and Medicare after just a few 
years and, in effect, throw them to the 
winds to see what kind of politics 
might be put in place. 
I don’t believe that is acceptable. 
Senator BROWN, the chair of our sub-
committee, doesn’t believe that is ac-
ceptable. Social Security is among the 
most foundational principles in our 
country’s history, providing financial 
security through guaranteed benefits 
for millions of Americans. Over 70 mil-
lion Americans receive Social Security 
and Supplemental Security Income 
every year. 
Mr. BROWN. Senator WYDEN, would 
the Senator yield for one moment? 
Mr. WYDEN. I would be happy to 
and, particularly, so you can tell ev-
erybody again why you feel so strong-
ly. 
Mr. BROWN. I would like to ask you 
this. You had said that Senator SCOTT, 
who is the chairman of the Republican 
Senate 
campaign 
committee, 
rep-
resents the third largest State in the 
country, Florida. He said he wants to 
sunset? 
What 
exactly—just 
explain 
that so my colleagues understand it. 
The word ‘‘sunset’’ doesn’t sound so 
bad until you really explain it. And I 
know Senator MARKEY understands it, 
but explain that, if you would. 
Mr. WYDEN. Yes. What ‘‘sunset’’ 
means is you would unravel the basic 
principles of Social Security and Medi-
care. We don’t subject them to annual 
or regular political fights. We have 
said that people have earned those ben-
efits, and we aren’t just going to set ar-
bitrary dates and say we are going to, 
in effect, move on and we will decide 
what happens to seniors and the dis-
abled based on the politics of the mo-
ment. 
It is a 180-degree departure from the 
kind of guarantee that you spelled out 
that I feel so strongly about. We don’t 
say we are just going to have these ar-
bitrary changes that could put at risk 
the entire program. 
Mr. BROWN. So he is saying then, so 
I understand this right. Senator SCOTT, 
the chair of the Republican Senate 
campaign committee, representing the 
third largest State in the country, is 
saying that every 5 years, if the Senate 
doesn’t say yes to Social Security and 
Medicare, then they are unraveled and 
they die. It is up to the Senate to say 
yes every 5 years? 
Mr. WYDEN. My colleague from Ohio 
is being way too logical because, you 
bet, what this essentially means is if 
you sunset it, the program and the ben-
efits are not going to continue as they 
have. As you said, if people decide be-
cause of some particular kind of flurry 
at the moment that for some cause 
they don’t want to continue it, the 
well-being and security of seniors is 
jeopardized. 
Mr. BROWN. So if there is a Presi-
dent and a Senate and a House in 5 
years that want to privatize Medicare 
and Social Security, or a President 
who wants to veto it, or a Senate lead-
er, like Senator MCCONNELL, who has 
never really believed in it, they can do 
nothing. They just do nothing. So it is 
up to the people who support Social Se-
curity and Medicare to keep it going 
every 5 years. In other words, the bur-
den is on the supporters, the public— 
which is, to me, 90 percent of the public 
who likes this. So that is the way it 
works, right? 
Mr. WYDEN. You have stated it well. 
It would mean that when you sunset it, 
you would have to have a brand-new 
fight to reestablish its primacy as a 
guarantee. You sunset it. 
Mr. BROWN. Well, go back to that. 
You said ‘‘a brand-new fight.’’ I am not 
a historian. I like reading history, but 
I know enough about Medicare because 
I care a lot about the history, as you 
do, of that—and Senator MARKEY and 
others and Senator LEAHY, who is on 
the floor about it too. 
President Truman wanted to enact 
Medicare, but he couldn’t get the Con-
gress to do it. And then President Ken-
nedy wanted to enact Medicare, and he 
couldn’t get Congress to do it. It prob-
ably took the Kennedy assassination 
and all that was happening to sort of 
light the fire under Congress to pass 
Medicare. 
So you would need that kind of polit-
ical will. In other words, it took almost 
20 years to pass Medicare. So if Medi-
care were to expire, you would need a 
huge public wave with elected officials 
who want to do it to get it back, in ef-
fect. 
Mr. WYDEN. Nope, no question about 
it, and it would put in jeopardy funda-
mental core principles that seniors all 
across the country—in Ohio and Or-
egon and Massachusetts—have been 
able to count on. When you sunset it, 
you say you can’t count on it. You 
have to wait for another political bat-
tle. 
And I would just say to my col-
leagues—showing how extreme the po-
sition is of our colleague from Florida, 
Senator SCOTT—that Senator Orrin 
Hatch, the late Senator Hatch who 
worked with us, when he was in the 
Senate said: We will update the Medi-
care guarantee to start covering chron-
ic care. This is something the Senator 
from Massachusetts has worked with 
me on, home care for seniors. So Sen-
ator Orrin Hatch, our late colleague 
and my personal friend, who was not 
exactly a liberal, he understood what 
you and I are talking about: that Medi-
care and Social Security are a guar-
antee. And when we talked about 
chronic care, he said: We are going to 
update the Medicare guarantee—noth-
ing about saying: Well, gee, maybe we 
will do something after we sunset it. 
So my colleague has said it well. 
Mr. BROWN. Let me ask another 
question. So if Senator SCOTT gets his 
way or Senator MCCONNELL, the Repub-
lican leader, gets his way, and all the 
new candidates Senator SCOTT is help-
ing to get elected, if they get their way 
and pass Senator SCOTT’s bill to sunset, 
would Senator SCOTT still have govern-
ment healthcare and a government 
pension? 
Mr. WYDEN. He hasn’t talked about 
it, but I think that would certainly be 
one of the questions our constituents 
would ask about, because this issue of 
there being a double standard between 
seniors at home and their elected offi-
cials would be very real. He hasn’t 
spelled out how he would deal with 
that, but there is certainly the ques-
tion of elected officials, because we 
have these retirement benefits that 
have been part, again, of a program 
that has been established for some 
time. They haven’t been talked about. 
But I will tell you, I think the chair 
of the Social Security Subcommittee 
and myself on the Finance Committee, 
we are going to go out there and say: 
No double standard. 
You can be sure of that. If something 
is sunsetted for working people and 
seniors and the disabled, we are cer-
tainly not going to let Senator SCOTT 
pretend that somehow it is business as 
usual for elected officials. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
think 
Senator 
BROWN started us off very well, and he 
is asking questions that I think mil-
lions of Americans are going to ask. 
My understanding is that my colleague 
from Ohio, the chairman of the sub-
committee, is going to be looking at a 
lot of these issues in his subcommittee. 
But certainly this last point, about 
politicians talking out of both sides of 
their mouth and saying somehow that 
we are going to have a program 
sunsetted for seniors and the disabled— 
Social Security, Medicare and others— 
but we are not going to even talk about 
what happens for elected officials is an 
example of how you shouldn’t legislate. 
It is an example of what I believe could 
be a double standard. 
And I will just close, unless Senator 
BROWN wants to. In fact, I am going to 
let Senator BROWN do it. I thought, as 
I listened to Senator BROWN, and I put 
it in the context of all these years with 
the Gray Panthers, that everybody can 
understand what Senator BROWN
is 
talking about. Medicare and Social Se-
curity are a guarantee—period—invio-
late, as a result of the history that we 
have had in this country where people 
worked so hard for this. 
On the other side, we are talking 
about privatization, we are talking 
about portability, and we are talking 
about lots of new cost analyses in the 
private sector and individualized pro-
grams. I am for individualized pro-
grams on top of Social Security, not in 
place of it. 
So I really appreciate your resolu-
tion, Senator BROWN, and I am going to 
do everything I can to support it. 
Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Senator 
WYDEN. And I will yield back my time 
in 30 seconds. 
Mr. President, thank you for your in-
dulgence. Senator LEAHY will be speak-
ing in a moment. And, Senator LEAHY, 
chairman of the Finance Committee, 
we are just asking for cosponsors. We 
have a number of colleagues that have 
cosponsored this to make sure that So-
cial Security is with us—a strong, good

Social Security system—as long as we 
are a nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I under-
stand the floor vote is going to be soon. 
I ask unanimous consent that it be 
after I finish my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, listening 
to Senator WYDEN and Senator BROWN 
about Social Security, I would tell my 
colleagues that the first recipient of 
Social Security was a Vermonter. And 
Vermonters at that time, I believe, 
were the most Republican State in the 
Nation. 
I remember growing up as a child 
hearing so many people say: Well, I 
may disagree with a whole lot of things 
that 
President 
Roosevelt 
and 
the 
Democrats did, but Social Security, I 
am all for that. 
And I learned that as a child, and it 
has been part of my mantra ever since, 
along with Senator BROWN and Senator 
WYDEN. Social Security is a contract, 
and we should follow it. 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION 
Mr. President, today, the Senate will 
vote to invoke cloture on the motion 
to proceed to H.R. 6833 and take up a 
substitute amendment containing a 
continuing resolution to fund the Fed-
eral Government through December 16. 
I will vote to invoke cloture and move 
the process forward. I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Funding the Federal Government is 
the most basic responsibility of Con-
gress. The continuing resolution before 
the Senate today will keep vital serv-
ices running for the American people 
through December 16, provide critical 
support 
for 
Ukraine, 
secure 
the 
LIHEAP safety net ahead of winter, 
and provide emergency relief to com-
munities recovering from natural dis-
asters around the country. 
However, let me be clear, this is only 
a temporary measure. As the chairman 
of the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee, I am committed to completing 
the work of the Appropriations Com-
mittee before the end of this Congress. 
In a time of rising inflation, when ev-
erything 
costs 
more—energy, 
food, 
fuel, housing—we must respond accord-
ingly. Running on autopilot after De-
cember would be irresponsible, and the 
American people deserve more. 
Our Federal agencies run thousands 
of programs every day that benefit 
working families. From nutrition pro-
grams to small business loans and 
grants, from affordable housing to 
healthcare for our Nation’s veterans, 
from childcare services to our Nation’s 
schools, the Federal Government pro-
vides services that impact nearly every 
aspect of Americans’ lives. At a time of 
rising inflation, we cannot fund these 
critical programs at last year’s levels 
without cutting services or under-
funding needs. It is simple math. En-
acting full year appropriations bills 
into law must be our top priority. We 
owe it to the American people who sent 
us here. 
This bill addresses several urgent and 
pressing issues that cannot wait. The 
third hottest summer on record has 
strained one of our most successful 
safety nets—the Low Income Home En-
ergy Assistance Program, LIHEAP—as 
families’ energy costs went up with the 
record-setting temperatures. This bill 
contains $1 billion to bolster LIHEAP 
ahead of the winter, where Putin’s war 
on Ukraine and inflation are expected 
to drive energy costs even higher. No 
family should have to choose between 
heating their home or buying food, not 
in Vermont and not in any community 
across the country. I am glad that we 
were able to secure these needed re-
sources. 
The bill includes $12.35 billion in 
emergency assistance for Ukraine, fur-
ther demonstrating our resolve to 
stand with the people of Ukraine 
against President Putin’s illegal, bru-
tal war on their country. These funds 
will 
provide 
much-needed 
training, 
equipment, logistical support, supplies, 
and weapons to the military and na-
tional security forces of Ukraine at 
this pivotal point in the war. These 
funds will also be used to provide direct 
assistance to Ukraine to help its gov-
ernment maintain day-to-day oper-
ations while it fights to repel Russia’s 
invasion. And it provides funding to re-
plenish U.S. stocks of equipment that 
have been provided to the government 
of Ukraine and to other countries in 
support of the cause. 
The bill provides $2.5 billion to sup-
port recovery efforts following the Her-
mit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire in New 
Mexico. The largest fire in New Mexi-
co’s history has scorched hundreds of 
thousands of acres, destroyed homes, 
displaced thousands, and sparked a 
fresh water crisis in the community of 
Las Vegas, New Mexico. This is not an 
issue of red States or blue States, we 
are the United States, and we must 
stand with communities in crisis wher-
ever they may be. 
The bill also includes $2 billion in 
community development block grants 
to help address unmet recovery needs 
in communities experiencing major 
disasters in 2021 and 2022, such as Ken-
tucky, Missouri, and Puerto Rico. And 
with Hurricane Ian advancing in the 
Gulf, the CR also includes an addi-
tional $18.8 billion for the FEMA dis-
aster relief fund. We must ensure 
FEMA has the resources to meet this 
challenge, and this bill provides those 
resources. 
I am disappointed that, due to Re-
publican opposition, there is no addi-
tional funding to combat COVID–19 or 
monkeypox. Reductions in the current 
infection levels for COVID–19 are a di-
rect result of the investments we have 
made in vaccines, therapeutics, and 
testing over the past 2 years. If we 
hope to avoid a surge this winter, we 
need the resources to continue that ef-
fort. And we should be investing now to 
get ahead of monkeypox before it con-
tinues to spread both in the United 
States and overseas. Not providing 
these resources is short-sighted, and I 
will continue to fight for the necessary 
funding to continue to combat these 
terrible diseases. 
Now Congress must do its job and 
complete the appropriations process 
before the end of the year. I look for-
ward to working with Vice Chairman 
SHELBY, Chair DELAURO, and Ranking 
Member GRANGER to get this done. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO DR. DOUGLAS REISIG 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today, I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Dr. Doug Reisig of Missoula County as 
Montanan of the Month for his distin-
guished career as an educator and for 
his devotion to Montana students, 
Montana parents, and the community. 
Doug was born and raised in Mon-
tana. He earned his master’s degree 
from the University of Montana and 
his Ph.D. from Montana State. Back 
home in Montana, Cat-Griz bipartisan-
ship is what Doug has in his back-
ground. You see, Doug taught at Bil-
lings West High School before accept-
ing a job at the St. Ignatius School 
District. It was in St. Ignatius that he 
met his lovely wife Mary Jo. Doug and 
Mary Jo have been married for almost 
43 years and have raised two wonderful 
daughters, Megan and Callie. They are 
now the proud grandparents of four 
grandsons. 
Doug has been a teacher, building ad-
ministrator, and superintendent for 46 
years, serving as superintendent at 
Hellgate Elementary for the past 34 
years. Prior to his retirement, he re-
ceived the G.V. Erickson Award from 
the School Administrators of Montana 
for his contribution to education in our 
great State. 
Since Doug took over as super-
intendent, the school has seen a 33-per-
cent increase in enrollment. He also 
oversaw the construction of the new 
middle school, and during the height of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, under Doug’s 
leadership, Hellgate Elementary was a 
leader in delivering meals to children 
in need and even went the extra mile 
by selflessly donating his increase in 
salary to the Family Resource Fund. 
With Doug’s direction and precautions 
in place, both Hellgate Elementary and 
Middle School were in session 5 days a 
week during the 2020 and 2021 school 
years. 
It is my honor to recognize Dr. Doug 
Reisig for serving the State of Montana 
as an educator and for his dedication to 
ensuring that Montana students have a 
very bright future ahead. 
Congratulations on your retirement, 
Doug. You truly make Montana proud.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO JUDGE-EXECUTIVE 
MICHAEL BUCHANON 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
after 29 years as Warren County judge- 
executive, Mike Buchanon is retiring 
at the end of his current term this Jan-
uary, leaving behind an impressive leg-
acy of public service. He has overseen 
explosive growth in his county over the 
past three decades, developed Bowling 
Green into a center for art and recre-
ation, and left an enduring mark on 
the residents, businesses, and new ini-
tiatives he championed. Today, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Judge Buchanon on his well-deserved 
retirement and thanking him for his 
contributions to Kentucky. 
I have been proud to call Judge 
Buchanon both a close colleague and a 
personal friend during his three-decade 
tenure on the job, working with him to 
promote job growth, workforce train-
ing, and development in South Central 
Kentucky. As a former judge-executive, 
I know both the difficulties and re-
wards of his position intimately. Judge 
Buchanon shares the passion I felt for 
my constituents during my time as 
Jefferson 
County 
judge-executive. 
After all, they are not just your voters; 
they are also your neighbors, family, 
and friends. Every achievement on the 
job brings real, tangible change to the 
community you call your home. 
Judge Buchanon built his reputation 
for diligent leadership in the face of in-
tense crises. From almost the moment 
he started the job, a major snowstorm 
battered Warren County, forcing Judge 
Buchanon to declare an emergency and 
call in the National Guard. Toward the 
end of his career, he faced similar dis-
asters, first with the onset of the 
COVID–19 pandemic in 2020 and then 
with last winter’s devastating tornado 
outbreak. In each of these emergencies, 
he worked long days and nights to en-
sure the security and safety of his con-
stituents, deftly handling communica-
tion with my office and other Federal 
authorities to ensure Warren County 
received the assistance it required. 
When not dealing with crisis situa-
tions, Judge Buchanon dedicated his 
time to helping Warren County grow. 
That growth came from a multitude of 
directions: the addition of tens of thou-
sands of new residents during his ten-
ure, the arrival of major new busi-
nesses, and the cultivation of one of 
Kentucky’s finest art scenes and public 
recreation systems, to name just a few. 
He fostered this development by main-
taining a consistent pro-job, pro-busi-
ness mentality, persistently pitching 
Warren County to private sector inves-
tors as a premier location for expan-
sion opportunities. 
His tenure has left a physical mark 
on the surface of Bowling Green. From 
the Kentucky Transpark industrial 
park, which is now home to 2 dozen 
companies employing some 3,000 peo-
ple, to Bowling Green’s downtown revi-
talization, anchored by the Southern 
Kentucky Performing Arts Center, to 
the county’s large and growing public 
park system, his touch is apparent all 
across 
Warren 
County. 
Judge 
Buchanon is a builder, understanding 
long ago that, for Bowling Green to 
achieve the success it has found today, 
its leaders needed to invest in projects 
that would be attractive to the resi-
dents of the future. 
Judge Buchanon has achieved success 
in part because of his dogged efforts, 
but also in part because his long tenure 
enabled him to plan and actualize 
projects over an extended timeframe. 
That would not have been possible were 
it not for the support he has seen 
among voters, time and time again, 
since his first election three decades 
ago. He has cultivated a close relation-
ship with his constituents, earning 
their trust and votes seven consecutive 
times, a rare feat for elected officials. 
No doubt, they are sad to see their 
foremost champion depart after so 
many years of success, even as he plans 
to stay closely involved in Warren 
County government. 
But Judge Buchanon has undeniably 
earned his retirement. His wife Ellen, 
two sons, Michael and Roy, grand-
children, and great-grandchildren have 
stood by his side during his long public 
service career, offering support and un-
derstanding when he had to work long 
nights on behalf of his community. 
Now, he looks forward to having ‘‘time 
to go to my grandkids’ ball games and 
travel some with my family.’’ He cer-
tainly deserves the respite. 
I would like to extend my sincere 
thanks to Judge Buchanon for his dec-
ades of service to his constituents and 
the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Warren County’s future is bright be-
cause of his dedicated work. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in congratulating 
Judge Buchanon on his retirement and 
wishing him the best as he moves on to 
the next chapter of his life.

TRIBUTE TO JUDGE-EXECUTIVE 
MIKE MALONE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
his 8 years as Carter County judge-ex-
ecutive, 
Mike 
Malone 
has 
battled 
Mother Nature, invited new develop-
ment to his community, and tried to 
bring neighbors on all sides of the po-
litical aisle together around their 
shared values. It hasn’t always been 
easy, but with dogged determination, 
Judge Malone has left Carter County a 
safer, more beautiful, more united

September 27, 2022 
place than he found it. Judge Malone is 
retiring at the end of his current term 
this January, and I ask my colleagues 
to join me in honoring this first-rate 
public servant for his contributions to 
Kentucky. 
Judge Malone didn’t start off his ca-
reer in government. Rather, he spent 
four decades in the private sector, 
building his businesses in Carter Coun-
ty. He developed a keen understanding 
of the role of public officials and the 
ways they could either help—or harm— 
business growth. Realizing he could put 
that knowledge to work on behalf of 
his family, neighbors, and friends, he 
threw his hat into the ring and filed to 
run for judge-executive. As he says, 
‘‘The rest is history.’’ 
Promoting businesses and jobs was 
always at the top of Judge Malone’s to- 
do list from his first days in office. But 
he was also forced to deal with some of 
the more unexpected duties of his role. 
Those started early on when, during 
Judge Malone’s first year in office, ice 
storms and flooding crippled Carter 
County’s infrastructure. Just 2 years 
ago, a winter storm hit the county 
again. Judge Malone worked around 
the clock to reconnect his constituents 
to accessible roadways and the power 
grid. He led an effort that removed 
thousands of cubic yards of debris and 
helped repair millions of dollars in 
damage to public utilities. 
Following this most recent storm, I 
visited Judge Malone in Carter County 
to discuss his community’s recovery 
and help direct Federal aid to the re-
gion. As a former judge-executive, I 
know 
the 
importance 
of 
Judge 
Malone’s work, from the financial as-
sistance he helped residents access, to 
the moral support he offered storm vic-
tims. I was impressed by his leadership 
and his ability to unite community 
members from all sides of the political 
spectrum around the common cause of 
helping their neighbors. As he says, 
‘‘it’s not Democrat or Republican. It’s 
‘what’s the problem and how do we fix 
it?’ ’’ 
Judge Malone has stood by his con-
stituents’ side in good times and bad, 
twice earning their trust and votes in 
his election to be judge-executive. At 
the end of this term, though, he is tak-
ing a step back from the political 
arena, opting to spend more time with 
his family and enjoy his hobbies after 
decades of hard work. I thank Judge 
Malone for his service to Carter County 
and the Commonwealth and wish him 
the best in the next stage of his life. 
Mr. President, the Daily Independent 
paid tribute to Judge Malone’s career 
in a recent article. I ask unanimous 
consent the article be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Daily Independent, Sep. 15, 2022] 
MALONE MOVING ON FROM CARTER JUDGE- 
EXEC. 
After eight years of serving as Carter 
County Judge-Executive, Mike Malone is off 
the ballot. Opting for a simpler life of retire-
ment filled with fishing and his grand-
children, Malone said, ‘‘I did the best I could 
do, I’m glad I did it, but I don’t want to do 
it again.’’ 
Before his current gig, Malone started out 
as a funeral director and later decided to 
work alongside his brother at his research 
business. Malone said he did compliance and 
purchasing, and his experience in business 
adds up to about 40 years. 
‘‘I filed to run for judge and the rest is his-
tory,’’ Malone laughed. 
It hasn’t been an easy job for Malone by 
any means. 
In just his first year as judge-executive, 
the county was slammed by Mother Nature 
with crippling ice storms and resulting flood-
ing, leaving behind utter destruction and an 
overwhelmed Malone. 
‘‘It was hard to step into,’’ he said. He had 
the business background, which helped, but 
Malone doesn’t believe anyone is truly pre-
pared for the responsibility the position 
holds. 
Malone explained that the seat requires 
one to deal with a ‘‘duty dumping ground.’’ 
‘‘If it doesn’t fit anywhere else, it goes on 
the county judge,’’ he added. 
Malone mentioned he was surprised to 
have to deal with some of the issues he’s run 
across as judge-executive. 
‘‘Animal control, solid waste issues and 
the scope of making sure your 911 system is 
functioning because people die if it doesn’t,’’ 
he said. 
When asked his favorite accomplishment, 
Malone stated he brought civility back to 
Carter County saying, ‘‘You gotta work with 
what you’ve got.’’ 
Malone said he’ll miss the people he’s 
worked with the most and extended his grat-
itude to the fiscal court, magistrates, sheriff, 
clerk and attorney. 
‘‘I’m lucky to have such great people,’’ Ma-
lone said. 
Despite polarizing beliefs, Malone said 
party never played a role. 
‘‘We don’t always agree, but there’s never 
been a fight or a fuss between them,’’ he 
said. ‘‘ . . . It’s not Democrat or Republican, 
it’s what’s the problem and how do we fix 
it?’’ 
In 2020, a late winter ice storm smacked 
the area, knocking Carter County down for 
two to three weeks and causing Malone and 
his team to struggle under the weight of the 
aid required after such events. 
Malone said during that time frame the 
citizens of the county went without power, 
electricity and accessible roadways. 
Malone said 159,000 cubic yards of tree de-
bris were removed and $10 million worth of 
damage was done to county roads and infra-
structure. 
‘‘Everybody stepped up,’’ Malone said, re-
ferring to office workers that headed out 
with chainsaws to cut timber and deliver 
water. 
‘‘It was our most trying time,’’ Malone 
said, ‘‘but my office really shined.’’ 
Malone recalled lighter memories, remem-
bering a time he got a call that a roadway 
had been blocked preventing a bus from pass-
ing through. When Malone inquired about 
what was blocking the roadway, he said a 
grand piano had been abandoned in the mid-
dle of the road. 
‘‘These sorts of things always came out of 
the blue,’’ he laughed. 
Malone also recalled working with the late 
Judge Henry Wilhoit to bring the veterans 
park to the lot across from the justice center 
in Grayson. 
A three-way battle will take place to fill 
Malone’s seat—Democrat Dustin Howard or 
Republican Brandon Burton or Independent 
Duane Suttles. 
‘‘We have good men that are honest that 
are running to replace me,’’ Malone said, 
‘‘They’re capable of doing a great job. Which-
ever gets it, I’ll do what I can to create a 
smooth transition.’’ 
Malone said that although he’s retiring, he 
wants to see Carter County succeed and will 
do what he can to help it even after he steps 
away from the political arena. 
But for now, Malone looks forward to fish-
ing as he said he hasn’t had much time to do 
it in the last eight years. 
(At the request of Mr. THUNE, the fol-
lowing statement was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD.)

HURRICANE IAN 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, due to

TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 117–1 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to 
commend the adoption of the resolu-
tion of ratification with respect to 
Treaty Document No. 117–1, amend-
ment to the Montreal Protocol. Adopt-
ing the Kigali Amendment, as it is bet-
ter known, will formalize the U.S. com-
mitment to phase down the use of 
hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, under 
the global climate treaty. These indus-
trial chemicals commonly found in air 
conditioners and refrigerators, insu-
lating foams, and pharmaceutical in-
halers are potent greenhouse gases. 
This historic achievement is the latest 
in a series by a Congress that will be 
remembered for its unprecedented ac-
tion to combat climate change and fu-
ture-proof our economy. 
Fittingly, last week was Climate 
Week NYC, an event that has taken 
place every year in New York City 
since 2009. The summit takes place 
alongside the UN General Assembly 
and brings together international lead-
ers from business, government, and 
civil society to showcase global cli-
mate action. 
A working paper on HFCs produced 
for the New Climate Economy by Na-
than 
Borgford-Parnell, 
Maxime 
Beaugrand, Stephen O. Anderson, and 
Durwood Zaelke of the Institute for 
Governance and Sustainable Develop-
ment, highlights HFC phasedown as 
one of the greatest opportunities to 
mitigate climate change quickly. 
Specifically, reducing HFC use in 
line with the Kigali Amendment to 
Montreal Protocol could avoid 0.5 de-
gree Celsius—0.9 degree Fahrenheit—of 
warming by 2100. That will go a long 
way toward limiting warming to 1.5 de-
grees Celsius under the Paris Agree-
ment and avoiding the worst impacts 
of climate change. U.S. adoption of the 
resolution, which has been ratified by 
137 countries, contributes to delivering 
on that commitment and cements the 
consensus on climate ambition as a 
complement to thriving economies. 
I would like to reflect on how we ar-
rived at this moment. Under the Mon-
treal Protocol, participating countries

September 27, 2022 
agreed to replace ozone-depleting prod-
ucts, such as chlorofluorocarbons— 
CFCs—found in refrigerants, aerosols, 
and solvents to help address the hole in 
the ozone layer. As a result, there has 
been a 97-percent reduction in the glob-
al consumption of controlled ozone-de-
pleting substances, with minimal eco-
nomic disruption. 
Hydrofluorocarbons—HFCs—make up 
the majority of the ozone-friendly 
products being used today to replace 
CFCs. HFCs can now be found in nearly 
every home in the United States, 
namely in our air conditioners and re-
frigerators. Although HFCs were devel-
oped as an ozone-layer-preserving al-
ternative to historical refrigerants, 
they are now known to be highly po-
tent greenhouse gases—hundreds or 
thousands of times more so than car-
bon dioxide. This discovery challenged 
policymakers and manufacturers to 
keep innovating. 
On October 15, 2016, in Kigali, Rwan-
da, more than 170 countries negotiated 
an amendment to the Montreal Pro-
tocol to include a global phasedown of 
HFCs. The goal of the Kigali Amend-
ment is to achieve an 80 percent or 
greater reduction in global HFC con-
sumption and production by 2047. 
Five years and three Presidential ad-
ministrations later, on November 16, 
2021, President Biden transmitted the 
Kigali Amendment to the U.S. Senate, 
which was referred to the U.S. Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, where I 
am proud to serve. The Foreign Rela-
tions 
Committee 
voted 
the 
Kigali 
Amendment out of committee by voice 
vote earlier this year. 
Today, U.S. businesses stand to ben-
efit tremendously from the global 
phase-down 
in 
hydrofluorocarbons— 
HFCs—and, thereby, the ratification of 
Kigali. This includes chemicals manu-
facturers such as Honeywell, air-condi-
tioning and refrigeration companies, 
and 
major 
retail 
companies 
like 
Walmart. Honeywell, headquartered in 
North Carolina, has a safety product 
manufacturing 
presence 
in 
Silver 
Spring, MD. I applaud the U.S. busi-
nesses at the forefront of innovation 
and development of commercially via-
ble alternatives to HFCs that have al-
ready invested billions of dollars in de-
veloping alternatives to HFCs, includ-
ing in anticipation of U.S. ratification 
of Kigali. This investment in research 
and development and new capacity, 
mainly in the U.S., will advance our 
ability to produce next-generation re-
frigerants, 
insulation 
materials, 
aerosols, and solvents here at home, in-
sulating our economy from supply 
chain disruptions. 
In fact, the United States is already 
implementing domestic authorities to 
phase down the use of HFCs in a man-
ner entirely consistent with Kigali, 
under the American Manufacturing and 
Innovation—AIM—Act that I am proud 
to have supported as a member of the 
Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee. During the challenging 
early days of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the committee gathered information 
from stakeholders on legislation intro-
duced by Senators KENNEDY and Chair-
man CARPER to establish a domestic 
phasedown 
of 
hydrofluorocarbons— 
HFCs—consistent 
with 
the 
Kigali 
Amendment to the Montreal Protocol 
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
Layer. We heard from an extraordinary 
range of industry and environmental 
stakeholder groups supporting this leg-
islation, particularly those most di-
rectly affected. 
It was through this process that I 
learned that a Maryland academic in-
stitution had contributed to the con-
sensus around the economic benefits of 
ratification. INFORUM, or Inter-indus-
try Forecasting at the University of 
Maryland, produced an analysis cited 
by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers, 
and many of the firms and industry as-
sociations that support the AIM bill. 
The University of Maryland study 
found that the phasedown of HFCs will 
create 33,000 new U.S. manufacturing 
jobs. When the indirect and induced ef-
fects were added to estimate the total 
impact, the number of jobs gained rose 
to 150,000. 
On December 27, 2020, the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act of 2021 was 
enacted, which included the American 
Innovation and Manufacturing—AIM— 
Act. The legislative language was near-
ly identical to the bipartisan legisla-
tion introduced by Senators KENNEDY 
and CARPER, which had broad bipar-
tisan backing in the Senate, with 16 
Republican cosponsors. EPA has al-
ready started implementing the AIM 
Act, with the first regulations issued in 
October 2021. 
Even before the Federal action taken 
in the last 2 years, States were acting 
in their interests to reduce HFCs. In 
November 2020, the Maryland Depart-
ment of the Environment—MDE—final-
ized regulations to phase out the use of 
HFCs and reduce methane emissions to 
help meet the State’s aggressive cli-
mate and environmental goals for re-
ducing greenhouse gases. 
This sub-national action was de-
signed to help Maryland meet its re-
quirements under the State’s emissions 
reduction target, which was subse-
quently made even more ambitious 
when the Climate Solutions Now Act 
become State law. The act set a new 
target of net zero by 2045, while con-
tinuing to have a net positive effect on 
the economy and job creation. Mary-
land participates in the U.S. Climate 
Alliance and is a member of the multi- 
State Regional Greenhouse Gas Initia-
tive—RGGI. 
Maryland is also a leader for green 
building in the U.S., having been in-
cluded in the Top 10 States for LEED 
list every year since 2011. The U.S. 
Green Buildings Council community 
has long shown leadership on refrig-
erants, with key studies issued in the 
early 2000s probing the balance between 
ozone layer and global warming. 
In fact, since 2010, 63 percent of 
LEED-certified projects have achieved 
the enhanced refrigerant management 
credit, which is intended reduce ozone 
depletion and support early compliance 
with the Montreal Protocol while mini-
mizing direct contributions to climate 
change. Embracing energy efficiency, 
including through the use of modern 
refrigerants, across these properties 
has a tangible impact in their home 
communities. 
The Federal Government given its 
real estate footprint needs to lead by 
example. Fortunately, there is major 
new Federal funding included in the In-
flation Reduction Act for the General 
Services Administration—GSA—to do 
just that, including funding to improve 
the environmental performance of Fed-
eral buildings and implement emerging 
and sustainable technologies. 
The next generation of coolant tech-
nologies is extremely energy efficient. 
This means the transition to HFC al-
ternatives will generate billions of dol-
lars in energy savings for American 
businesses and consumers over the next 
decade. In total, the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency—EPA—has 
estimated that the economic benefits 
from implementing the AIM Act alone 
will be more than $270 billion. Clearly, 
phasing down HFCs in favor of environ-
mentally safer alternatives and more 
energy-efficient cooling technologies 
benefits the climate and the economy. 
Nearly 1 year ago, I returned from 
my trip to Glasgow, Scotland, for 
COP26, the 2021 United Nations—UN— 
Climate Change Conference, where the 
need for concerted action at every 
level—State and local, national, and 
international, and nongovernmental— 
was undeniable. 
I was privileged to have 18 Senate 
colleagues join me to bolster President 
Biden’s agenda and the U.S. leadership 
role on the world stage. The Glasgow 
Climate Pact established a clear con-
sensus that all nations need to do 
much more, immediately, to prevent a 
catastrophic rise in global tempera-
tures. Thursday’s Senate action by a 
comfortable margin of 69–27 is a signal 
to the world that together we can pro-
tect our economic interests and im-
prove quality of life. While our work to 
combat the climate crisis is hardly 
complete, we can build on the momen-
tum generated by this hopeful, stra-
tegic victory. 
I will conclude by applauding my col-
leagues for their actions in support of 
adoption of the Kigali Amendment, and 
for our years’ long efforts along the 
path to this historic moment.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO HILLER AND 
MARILYN SUBER 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor Hiller and Marilyn 
Suber of Monticello, AR, for their tre-
mendous work as foster parents, open-
ing their home to more than 350 foster 
care placements over the last 20 years. 
The Congressional Coalition on Adop-
tion Institute—CCAI—recently recog-
nized the Subers as 2022 Angels in 
Adoption honorees. 
Since 2001, the CCAI has played a 
vital 
role 
in 
eliminating 
barriers 
standing between orphaned and foster 
children becoming part of a loving fam-
ily. As the CCAI’s signature public 
awareness program, Angels in Adoption 
annually recognizes outstanding indi-
viduals, 
families 
and 
organizations 
that have made extraordinary con-
tributions to adoption and child wel-
fare. 
The Subers are well-deserving of this 
honor for their work with children in 
need and the amazing example they set 
for families across Arkansas and the 
Nation. 
When Hiller and Marilyn married in 
1999, they decided to foster instead of 
trying to have children of their own. 
Although they cared for children of 
many ages at first, they found their 
niche with teenagers and are now one 
of the few homes in Arkansas that only 
fosters teens. 
The Arkansas Division of Children 
and Family Services recognized the 
Subers as the Arkansas Foster Parents 
of the Year in 2021. As DCFS Director 
Mischa Martin attested, many families 
are hesitant to open their homes to 
teenagers, but the State knows it ‘‘can 
always count on the Subers to take in 
teens and provide them with the love 
and 
support 
they 
need 
to 
really 
thrive,’’ adding, ‘‘they care deeply 
about our kids, and the kids love them 
right back.’’ 
As a member of the Congressional 
Coalition on Adoption, I am inspired by 
the love and dedication families like 
the Subers share every day to improve 
the lives of young people. It is my 
honor to congratulate them as 2022 An-
gels in Adoption and wish them many 
more years of happiness and fulfill-
ment in their mission. 
On behalf of the people of Arkansas, 
I extend my gratitude and congratula-
tions to Hiller and Marilyn Suber on 
earning this tremendous honor and ap-
plaud their humility and compassion.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DAN DINNING 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH 
and Representative RUSS FULCHER, we 
thank Dan Dinning for serving as 
Boundary County commissioner for 
more than 20 years. 
Dan Dinning began his service as 
Boundary County commissioner in 2001 
and, throughout, worked steadily to 
strengthen his community. A native of 
Boundary County who attended the 
University 
of 
Idaho, 
Commissioner 
Dinning has been the longest serving 
commissioner for his county. This 
comes as no surprise, given his deep 
commitment to his hometown, Bonners 
Ferry, Boundary County, and Idaho. 
Dan is extremely hard working, and 
we are told there has rarely been a 
meeting in Boundary County that Dan 
did not attend. This dedication is also 
apparent in the remarkable number of 
State and community groups he has 
served in and led. This includes the 
Governor’s appointment of Commis-
sioner Dinning to serve on the Idaho 
Roadless Rule Commission. Dan served 
on the Selkirk-Cabinet Yaak Grizzly 
Bear Conservation Subcommittee; mul-
tiple committees for the Idaho Associa-
tion of Counties; served as chair for the 
Idaho Department of Environmental 
Quality 
Panhandle 
Basin 
Advisory 
Group; and so much more. 
Natural resources issues in north 
Idaho, like in many parts of Idaho and 
the West, tend to be very controversial, 
and Commissioner Dinning has not 
shied away from those challenges. 
When meetings grew contentious, Dan 
was always a calm voice reminding 
attendees that we all care about the 
same things, just disagree on possible 
solutions. He rarely is the first one to 
speak. Rather, he listens first and then 
makes thoughtful comments. These 
productive characteristics have been 
instrumental in his leadership in start-
ing and sustaining the Kootenai Valley 
Resource 
Initiative, 
KVRI. 
KVRI 
changed the tone of natural resource 
conversations, and tensions eased as 
the community saw what collaboration 
can accomplish. 
In preparing this tribute, there was 
no shortage of great thoughts and sto-
ries that have been shared about Dan 
Dinning. They include a touching mo-
ment shared by Patty Perry about a 
trip to Washington, DC, when Dan was 
adamant about visiting the Vietnam 
Memorial Wall. His reason was to find 
a family’s son’s name on the wall and 
create a rubbing to bring home to them 
in Boundary County, since they would 
never get to see it. Patty recalled that, 
of course, it brought tears and was a 
reflection of the kind of guy Dan is.

September 27, 2022 
Dan is a man of high moral char-
acter, a salt of the earth, family man 
devoted to his community. Of all his 
achievements, we hear that he would 
cite his family as his greatest accom-
plishment. He and his wife Mary have 
three children, Lisa, Brian and Kevin; 
two 
granddaughters; 
and 
three 
grandsons. Thank you, Dan, for your 
service to your beloved community, 
county, and the entire State of Idaho. 
We look forward to continuing to hear 
your stories and you sharing your deep-
ly valued thoughts and perspective 
with 
us 
on 
how 
to 
continue 
to 
strengthen our great State.∑

TRIBUTE TO ALEX IRBY 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I honor 
Alex Irby, of Orofino, ID, for his many 
years of natural resources and collabo-
rative work in the Clearwater Basin of 
Idaho. 
More than 14 years ago, Alex Irby and 
Dale Harris asked for my help with set-
ting up and supporting the Clearwater 
Basin Collaborative, CBC. They love 
this wonderful part of Idaho and put 
their hard work into pulling together a 
collaborative effort to resolve natural 
resources challenges in the area. Alex 
even dedicated 10 years to serving as 
cochair of the CBC. The focus of the 
collaborative was to support the Nez 
Perce-Clearwater National Forests to 
get work done on the ground and save 
the local sawmills in the area. We 
launched the CBC in May of 2008, and 
the CBC has had an important role in 
furthering discussions about the man-
agement of the Nez Perce-Clearwater 
National Forests and achieved much- 
needed restoration of landscapes, in-
cluding water quality improvements, 
which are also providing a supply of 
raw materials to our local mills. 
The accomplishments of the CBC and 
the fact it is still going strong today is 
due in large part to the forethought 
and commitment of Alex Irby, the Nez 
Perce Tribe, and the other partners in 
the collaborative effort. Alex brought 
his decades of natural resources experi-
ence to the collaborative table. In 1959, 
at the age of 16, Alex started fighting 
fires for the Clearwater-Potlatch Tim-
ber Protection Association, C-PTPA, 
with roots in Idaho stretching back 
more than 100 years. Alex worked for 
C-PTPA for 26 years. He also worked 
for Konkolville Lumber Company from 
1984 to 2000, and he served as an Idaho 
Fish and Game Commissioner for 8 
years, starting in 1999. After his service 
to the Idaho Fish and Game Commis-
sion ended in 2007, Alex served as the 
Idaho Fish and Game Representative to 
the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Licens-
ing Board, with his position ending in 
2014. His other contributions to the 
natural resources sector include his 
service with his local soil and water 
conservation district and rural fire dis-
trict. Alex is also a founder of PLAY, 
Public 
Lands 
Access 
Year-Round, 
started in 1999 to work with public land 
managers, to help ensure more roads 
and trails remain open for continued 
motorized access for off highway vehi-
cles. 
To this day, Alex is out cutting trail 
and hunting in the Clearwater Basin. 
He has a wealth of knowledge and his-
tory of the area and backs the respon-
sibility of taking care of our public 
lands with hard work and know-how. 
He is willing to work with anyone who 
is a team player. Thank you, Alex Irby, 
for your remarkable contributions of 
your time and talents to improving and 
sustaining an amazing part of our 
great State and country.∑

TRIBUTE TO CHERYL HESER 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Cheryl Heser of Rosebud County for her 
passion for education and her dedica-
tion to preserving American history as 
a living history presenter for Mon-
tanans across the Treasure State. 
Cheryl has served her community as 
an educator for many years teaching 
high school English, Spanish, and jour-
nalism, and she managed a K–12 school 
library. She is also a published author 
and served as the director of the Rose-
bud County Library in Forsyth, MT, 
for 17 years. Cheryl earned statewide 
recognition for her esteemed radio pro-
gram and was named the 2014 Librarian 
of the Year by the Montana Library 
Association. 
Even after her retirement, Cheryl’s 
dedication to education and passion for 
storytelling 
continues 
through 
her 
work as a living history presenter. 
Cheryl travels to Montana commu-
nities to utilize her knack for story-
telling and skilled research to educate 
Montanans of all ages and preserve 
American history by portraying the 
lives of historical figures like Dolly 
Madison and Annie Oakley. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Cheryl Heser for her passion for edu-
cation and her work to preserve Amer-
ican history. I have no doubt Cheryl’s 
unique and captivating living history 
presentations have influenced Mon-
tanans of all ages. Keep up the great 
work, 
Cheryl; 
you 
make 
Montana 
proud.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CAROLINE KEANE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Caroline Keane of 
Concord as September’s Granite Stater 
of the Month. For the past 8 years, 
Caroline has organized the Ready to 
Learn Fair, where Concord School Dis-
trict 
students 
can 
receive 
free 
backpacks and other school supplies. 
About 9 years ago, when Caroline was 
an education assistant for Rundlett 
Middle School’s autism program, she 
came across a young student who was 
attempting to carry his books in a 
flimsy plastic bag, crying. He was 
upset because the plastic bag—his 
makeshift backpack—had torn open. 
She began raising money to purchase 
school supplies and reaching out to 
local businesses and organizations to 
donate materials or provide free serv-
ices. 
Over the past 8 years, the Ready to 
Learn Fair has expanded beyond just 
school supplies and has become an es-
sential part of the school’s community. 
At the fair, the New England School of 
Barbering provides free haircuts; and 
there is a long line for this every year. 
Caroline also works to bring represent-
atives from the district’s Free and Re-
duced Lunch Program to the fair so 
that families can sign up their kids. 
Last year, families could get their 
COVID–19 vaccines, and this year she is 
collecting winter supplies such as coats 
and hats for students in need. After the 
fair, Caroline stores any leftover sup-
plies in a closet at the school, so that 
students 
can 
access 
the 
supplies 
throughout the year. 
After seeing a need in her commu-
nity, Caroline took action to make 
sure that students, regardless of their 
family’s 
income, 
are 
prepared 
for 
school—helping students succeed and 
alleviating parents’ stress. Even be-
yond this impact, Caroline’s initiative 
brought her community together, from 
volunteers, to small business owners, 
to the school’s maintenance team, to 
donors. Caroline’s initiative represents 
the Granite State spirit of taking care 
of your neighbors and bringing people 
together for a common goal, and I com-
mend her for her work.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. DURBIN: 
S. 4962. A bill to establish within the 
Office of Gender Equality and Women’s 
Empowerment of the United States 
Agency for International Development 
a rural mobility program to promote 
mobility in rural communities through 
access to affordable, fit-for-purpose bi-
cycles, 
to 
provide 
support 
to 
sustainably increase access to rural 
areas, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to do something unusual on the 
floor of the Senate. I would like to re-
port some good news. It isn’t often we 
have these reports. Today, I have three 
items in my news that I would like to 
share with the people who are fol-
lowing this. I would like to start my 
remarks by sharing an incredible story 
from the other side of the world. 
In May 2020, as the world was reeling 
from the spread of the deadly new 
strain of the coronavirus, the Red 
Cross society in the African nation of 
Kenya received 500 bicycles from a Chi-
cago-based, nongovernmental organiza-
tion known as World Bicycle Relief. 
Community healthworkers used these 
bicycles to make house visits across 
southern Kenya, providing health serv-
ices to remote communities that would 
otherwise not be reached because of re-
strictions on movement due to COVID– 
19. 
In Malawi, young girls used these bi-
cycles to get safely to and from school, 
and when COVID–19 closed the schools 
down, girls like 17-year-old Elizabeth 
were able to shift focus to help their 
parents, who are farmers, weather the 
economic effects of the pandemic. She 
used her bicycle to take their produce 
to market. 
Stories 
like 
these 
are 
common 
around the world, showing the value of 
a simple, relatively inexpensive, green, 
and easy-to-repair means of mobility— 
a bicycle—to help meet important de-
velopment objectives. 
Since its founding in 2005, the World 
Bicycle Relief of Chicago has done 
great work in helping displaced sur-
vivors after a natural disaster in Sri 
Lanka, allowing farmers to move crops 
in Zambia, and getting girls to school 
in Malawi. 
I have even seen myself how a bicycle 
ambulance 
in 
rural 
Tanzania 
can 
change lives; and not long ago, my 
staff saw the group’s efforts in Kenya, 
where more than 25,000 sustainable, 
rugged bicycles have been provided. 
Since 2019, I have worked through ap-
propriations to push USAID to invest 
in bicycles, which help meet the needs 
in healthcare, education, women and 
girls’ empowerment, and more. Part of 
this funding has included an in-depth 
assessment to see what is most useful 
and how to make the programs locally 
sustainable. They not only send bikes; 
they send parts and then train the re-
pairmen. USAID has used these lessons 
and opportunities with increasing suc-
cess thanks to the work of many 
groups, including that of the World Bi-
cycle Relief of Chicago. 
Today, I am introducing legislation 
in partnering with the Kenya bicycle 
world and U.S. House of Representa-
tives’ 
Representative 
EARL
BLU-
MENAUER of Oregon. Our bill is going to 
codify these important efforts and for-
malize the creation of a mobility pro-
gram within USAID’s Office of Gender 
Equality and Women’s Empowerment. 
COVID–19 has taught us that a global 
health crisis can easily turn into an 
economic crisis, a food crisis, a mobil-
ity crisis, and more. Sometimes the 
simplest things, like a bicycle, can 
help make incredible progress. 
That is item No. 1. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4962

By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mr. DURBIN): 
S. 4968. A bill to create an Active 
Shooter Alert Communications Net-
work, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Active Shooter Alert 
Act of 2022. 
This legislation recognizes the need 
to protect the public during active 
shooter situations while our country 
experiences 
an 
unconscionable 
epi-
demic of mass shootings. 
This legislation would establish a 
voluntary public safety alert system 
for use by law enforcement to notify 
individuals of active shooter situations 
occurring within their communities. It 
would also appoint an Active Shooter 
Alert Coordinator at the Department 
of Justice who would direct Federal 
training, technical support, and best 
practices efforts across the country. 
Additionally, this legislation would 
establish an Advisory Panel to coordi-
nate with FEMA, the Department of 
Transportation, and the FCC. The 
panel would develop guidance on how 
alerts should be sent, how they should 
be designed, and what language should 
be used.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5056 
September 27, 2022 
Americans deserve to feel safe in 
their communities. The tragedies in 
Highland Park, Memphis, and Uvalde 
are reminders that we have to address 
the pressing issues surrounding mass 
shootings. 
The House has already passed this 
bill with strong bipartisan support 
from 43 Republicans who recognized 
that political affiliation should never 
jeopardize our obligation to protect 
Americans from harm. 
Public safety is paramount, and our 
country’s law enforcement officers, 
first responders, and healthcare pro-
viders deserve every tool available as 
they carry out their work. 
This bill is an important step to 
strengthen our public safety infra-
structure, and I look forward to work-
ing with my colleagues to pass the Ac-
tive Shooter Alert Act of 2022 as quick-
ly as possible.

RESOLUTION 
797—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
CONDEMNING 
AZER-
BAIJANI FORCES’ ILLEGAL AND 
UNPROVOKED ASSAULT ON AR-
MENIAN TERRITORY AND INSIST-
ING UPON THE CESSATION OF 
SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE 
TO 
AZERBAIJAN 
IN 
ACCORDANCE 
WITH FEDERAL LAW 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
RUBIO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 797 
Whereas on September 13, 2022, Azerbaijani 
forces mounted an illegal and unprovoked as-
sault on Armenian territory, including the 
cities 
of 
Vardenis, 
Sotk, 
Artanish, 
Ishkhanasar, Goris, and Kapan; 
Whereas by September 14, 2022, Armenian 
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced 
a preliminary death toll of more than 100 Ar-
menians; 
Whereas the Azerbaijani military fired ar-
tillery at Armenian villages along the bor-
der, forcing more than 2,750 civilians, includ-
ing 370 children and 55 people with disabil-
ities, to evacuate their homes and take shel-
ter; 
Whereas, according to Armenia’s Ministry 
of Territorial Administration and Infrastruc-
ture, the Azerbaijani attack damaged 192 res-
idential buildings in Gegharkunik, Syunik, 
and Vayots Dzor Provinces; 
Whereas, according to the Armenian Om-
budsman, Azerbaijani shelling set fire to a 
forest in Jermuk, with artillery fire pre-
venting Armenian firefighters from imme-
diate access to the blaze; 
Whereas 
according 
to 
Prime 
Minister 
Pashinyan, Azerbaijani forces illegally ad-
vanced into at least 10 square kilometers of 
Armenian territory; 
Whereas on the evening of September 14, 
2022, Secretary of the Security Council of Ar-
menia, Armen Grigoryan, announced that a 
ceasefire took hold; 
Whereas Azerbaijan’s latest attack on Ar-
menian territory and the Armenian people 
follows a long pattern of aggression, includ-
ing during the 2020 Nagorno Karabakh War, 
when an attack by Azerbaijani forces ignited 
a conflict that killed more than 6,500 people 
and displaced almost 100,000 ethnic Arme-
nians; 
Whereas Azerbaijan continues to hold at 
least 35 prisoners of war and 3 civilian pris-
oners from the Nagorno Karabakh War and 
Azerbaijan’s recent attack on Armenia; 
Whereas Azerbaijan’s attack on Armenia, 
which was launched on September 13, 2022, is 
a flagrant violation of Armenia’s sovereignty 
and territorial integrity, and a violation of 
international law; 
Whereas section 907 of the FREEDOM Sup-
port Act (22 U.S.C. 5812 note) prohibits 
United 
States 
assistance 
to 
Azerbaijan 
‘‘until the President determines, and so re-
ports to Congress, that the Government of 
Azerbaijan is taking demonstrable steps to 
cease all blockades and other offensive uses 
of force against Armenia and Nagorno- 
Karabakh’’; 
Whereas title II of the Foreign Operations, 
Export Financing, and Related Programs Ap-
propriations Act of 2002 (Public Law 107–115) 
allows the President to waive section 907 of 
the FREEDOM Support Act under certain 
statutorily defined conditions, including if 
doing so ‘‘will not undermine or hamper on-
going efforts to negotiate a peaceful settle-
ment between Armenia or Azerbaijan or be 
used for any offensive purposes against Ar-
menia’’; 
Whereas upon exercising such waiver, the 
President must submit a report to appro-
priate congressional committees outlining— 
(1) ‘‘the nature and quantity of all training 
and assistance provided to the Government 
of Azerbaijan pursuant to [the waiver],’’; 
(2) ‘‘the status of the military balance be-
tween Azerbaijan and Armenia and the im-
pact of United States assistance on that bal-
ance’’; and 
(3) ‘‘the status of negotiations for a peace-
ful settlement between Armenia and Azer-
baijan and the impact of United States as-
sistance on those negotiations’’; 
Whereas on March 2, 2022 the Government 
Accountability Office released a report, 
which found that the Department of State 
and the Department of Defense failed to 
meet certain statutory reporting require-
ments to Congress, including the impact of 
proposed assistance on the military balance 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia; 
Whereas the Government Accountability 
Office found that the Department of State 
and the Department of Defense did not docu-
ment their consideration of waiver require-
ments from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal 
year 2020, including how the departments de-
termined that assistance would not be used 
for offensive purposes against Armenia; and 
Whereas despite agreeing with the Govern-
ment Accountability Office’s recommenda-
tions, the Department of State has not dem-
onstrated how it will adequately report to 
Congress on statutorily required consider-
ations for aid to Azerbaijan: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) 
condemns 
Azerbaijan’s 
illegal 
and 
unprovoked attack on Armenian territory; 
(2) urges Azerbaijan to fully adhere to the 
ceasefire agreed to on September 14, 2022; 
(3) demands that Azerbaijan respect the 
territorial integrity of Armenia; 
(4) calls for the release of all Armenian 
prisoners of war and civilian prisoners held 
in Azerbaijan; 
(5) insists that the Department of State 
meet all statutorily required reporting re-
quirements 
for 
consideration 
of 
United 
States assistance to Azerbaijan; 
(6) urges the Secretary of State to imme-
diately halt all security assistance to Azer-
baijan; 
(7) urges the President to evaluate whether 
officials of the Government of Azerbaijan 
should be subject to sanctions under the 
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Account-
ability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public 
Law 114–328) for human rights abuses against 
ethnic Armenians; and 
(8) supports the robust provision of human-
itarian assistance to the people of Armenia 
and Nagorno Karabakh affected by Azer-
baijan’s war of aggression.

SAFETY WEEK TO REDUCE RAIL- 
RELATED 
ACCIDENTS, 
FATALI-
TIES, AND INJURIES 
Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. 
WICKER, Mr. PETERS, and Mrs. FISCHER) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
Whereas the first Rail Safety Week was 
held from September 24 through September 
30, 2017, by the national education safety 
nonprofit Operation Lifesaver, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, and other organiza-
tions; 
Whereas Rail Safety Week was launched to 
raise awareness about the need for increased 
education on how to be safe around highway- 
rail grade crossings and railroad tracks and 
to highlight efforts to further reduce colli-
sions, injuries, and fatalities; 
Whereas highway-rail grade crossing and 
trespassing accidents constituted approxi-
mately 94 percent of all rail-related fatali-
ties during 2021; 
Whereas, since 2005— 
(1) the number of public highway-rail grade 
crossings has decreased by 10 percent; and 
(2) the number of gates at such crossings 
has increased by 39 percent; 
Whereas, in 2021, 47 percent of all highway- 
rail grade crossing collisions and 65 percent 
of all fatal highway-rail grade crossing colli-
sions occurred at gated highway-rail grade 
crossings; 
Whereas preliminary Federal statistics in-
dicate that 2,145 highway-grade crossing col-
lisions occurred in the United States in 2021, 
resulting in 236 deaths and another 664 indi-
viduals injured; 
Whereas many collisions between trains 
and motor vehicles or pedestrians could have 
been prevented by increased education, engi-
neering, and enforcement; 
Whereas Operation Lifesaver, the foremost 
public information and education program 
on rail safety, administers a public edu-
cation program about grade-crossing safety 
and trespassing prevention; 
Whereas, during Rail Safety Week, from 
September 19 through 25, 2022, and through-
out the year, everyone is encouraged to take 
added caution as motorists or pedestrians 
approach tracks or trains; 
Whereas the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico will concurrently observe Rail Safety 
Week; and 
Whereas this important observance should 
lead to greater safety awareness and a reduc-
tion in highway-rail grade crossing collisions 
and other railroad incidents: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Rail Safe-
ty Week’’; 
(2) expresses strong support for— 
(A) the goals and ideals of Rail Safety 
Week; and 
(B) efforts to reduce rail-related accidents, 
fatalities, and injuries; and

and Ms. SMITH) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
Whereas October has been designated as 
‘‘National Energy Awareness Month’’; 
Whereas improvements in energy effi-
ciency technologies and practices, along 
with policies of the United States enacted 
since the 1970s, have resulted in energy sav-
ings of more than 60,000,000,000,000,000 British 
thermal units and energy cost avoidance of 
more than $800,000,000,000 annually; 
Whereas energy efficiency has enjoyed bi-
partisan support in Congress and in adminis-
trations of both parties for more than 40 
years; 
Whereas 
bipartisan 
legislation 
enacted 
since the 1970s to advance Federal energy ef-
ficiency policies includes— 
(1) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
(42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.); 
(2) the National Appliance Energy Con-
servation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–12; 101 
Stat. 103); 
(3) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 
13201 et seq.); 
(4) the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 
15801 et seq.); 
(5) the Energy Independence and Security 
Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17001 et seq.); 
(6) the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act 
of 2015 (Public Law 114–11; 129 Stat. 182); 
(7) the Energy Act of 2020 (Public Law 116– 
260; 134 Stat. 2418); and 
(8) the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act (Public Law 117-58; 135 Stat. 429); 
Whereas energy efficiency has long been 
supported by a diverse coalition of busi-
nesses (including manufacturers, utilities, 
energy service companies, and technology 
firms), public interest organizations, envi-
ronmental and conservation groups, and 
State and local governments; 
Whereas, since 1980, the United States has 
more than doubled its energy productivity, 
realizing twice the economic output per unit 
of energy consumed; 
Whereas more than 2,000,000 individuals in 
the United States are currently employed 
across the energy efficiency sector, as the 
United States has doubled its energy produc-
tivity, and business and industry have be-
come more innovative and competitive in 
global markets; 
Whereas the Office of Energy Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy of the Department of 
Energy is the principal Federal agency re-
sponsible for renewable energy technologies 
and energy efficiency efforts; 
Whereas cutting energy waste saves the 
consumers of the United States billions of 
dollars on utility bills annually; and 
Whereas energy efficiency policies, financ-
ing innovations, and public-private partner-
ships have contributed to a reduction in en-
ergy intensity in Federal facilities by nearly 
50 percent since the mid-1970s, which results 
in direct savings to United States taxpayers: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates October 5, 2022, as ‘‘Energy 
Efficiency Day’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
to observe Energy Efficiency Day with ap-
propriate programs, ceremonies, and activi-
ties.

Whereas the American Farm Bureau was 
created in 1919 to disseminate college re-
search results to farmers; 
Whereas, since 1919, the American Farm 
Bureau has since grown into one of the 
strongest lobbying organizations in the 
United States, with 6,000,000 members and af-
filiated services and member benefits that

anniversary of the Mississippi Farm Bureau 
Federation; and 
(2) commemorates the history, effective

lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of subtitle E of title XII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 1262. PEACE AND TOLERANCE IN PALES-
TINIAN EDUCATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) In 2016 and 2017, the Palestinian Author-
ity published a modified curriculum for 
school-aged children in grades 1 through 11. 
(2) Textbooks used by the Palestinian Au-
thority in the West Bank and Gaza include 
graphics portraying violence against Israeli 
soldiers, positive portrayals of individuals 
who have committed attacks against citizens 
of Israel, and references to Palestinian ef-
forts to target the ‘‘Zionists’’. 
(3) Palestinian Authority textbooks are 
used at schools sponsored by the United Na-
tions Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East because the 
schools use the textbooks of the host govern-
ment. 
(4) On April 26, 2018, the Government Ac-
countability Office published a report that 
found the following: 
(A) Textbooks in schools in areas con-
trolled by the Palestinian Authority feature 
inaccurate and misleading maps of the re-
gion and include militaristic, adversarial im-
agery and content that incites hatred. 
(B) The Department of State raised with 
Palestinian officials the objectionable con-
tent in the textbooks, including a specific 
math problem using the number of Pales-
tinian casualties in the First and Second 
Intifadas. 
(C) In its review of such textbooks, the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees in the Near East identi-
fied content not aligned with United Nations 
values. The majority of content so identified 
presents problematic issues relating to neu-
trality or bias, including issues relating to 
maps and references to Jerusalem as the cap-
ital of Palestine. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Palestinian Authority has 
not sufficiently eliminated from the cur-
riculum used in schools in areas controlled 
by the Palestinian Authority content that 
encourages violence or intolerance toward 
other countries and ethnic groups. 
(c) REPORTS.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary of State 
shall submit to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations of the Senate and the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs of the House of Represent-
atives a report reviewing the curriculum 
used in schools in areas controlled by the 
Palestinian Authority or located in Gaza and 
controlled by any other entity— 
(A) not later than 180 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act; and 
(B) during each of the 2 years following the 
submission of the initial report under sub-
paragraph (A), not later than 90 days after 
the date on which a new school year begins 
for schools in areas controlled by the Pales-
tinian Authority. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—Each report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include the following: 
(A) A determination as to whether the cur-
riculum reviewed contains content that en-
courages violence or intolerance toward 
other countries or ethnic groups, and a de-
tailed explanation of the reasons for reach-
ing such determination. 
(B) An assessment of the steps the Pales-
tinian Authority is taking to reform cur-
riculum containing such content at schools 
so as to conform with standards of peace and 
tolerance in the Declaration of Principles on 
Tolerance adopted by member countries of 
the United Nations Educational, Scientific, 
and Cultural Organization on November 16, 
1995. 
(C) A determination as to whether United 
States foreign assistance is used, directly or 
indirectly, to fund the dissemination of such 
curriculum by the Palestinian Authority. 
(D) A detailed report on the manner in 
which United States assistance is being used 
to address curriculum that encourages vio-
lence or intolerance toward other countries 
or ethnic groups. 
(E) A detailed report on United States dip-
lomatic efforts, during the 5-year period pre-
ceding the date on which the report is sub-
mitted, to encourage peace and tolerance in 
Palestinian education. 
(F) If any diplomatic effort referred to in 
subparagraph (E) was terminated by the Sec-
retary of State, the reasons for such termi-
nation. 
(3) PUBLIC
AVAILABILITY.—The Secretary 
shall make each report required by para-
graph (1) available to the public on a pub-
licly accessible internet website of the De-
partment of State.

families have timely access to mental and 
behavioral health care services through the

At the appropriate place, insert the fol-

TITLE lllll—DRIVING FOR 
OPPORTUNITY 
SEC. lll01. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Driving for 
Opportunity Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. lll02. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Driving a vehicle is an essential aspect 
of the daily lives of most people in the 
United States. 
(2) Driving is often required to access jobs 
and healthcare, take care of family, get gro-
ceries, and fulfill other basic responsibilities. 
(3) In many small cities, towns, and rural 
areas that do not have public transportation 
and ridesharing alternatives, driving is often 
the only realistic means of transportation. 
(4) Even in cities with public transpor-
tation and ridesharing options, individuals 
vulnerable to infection during the COVID–19 
pandemic and those complying with public 
health guidance regarding social distancing 
are increasingly reliant on driving as their 
primary means of transportation for essen-
tial travel. 
(5) In the United States, millions of Ameri-
cans have had their driver’s licenses sus-
pended for unpaid court fines and fees. 
(6) A person whose driver’s license is sus-
pended or revoked for unpaid fines and fees 
will often find it more difficult to earn a liv-
ing and therefore pay the debt owed to the 
government. 
(7) The barrier to employment posed by 
driver’s license suspensions and revocations 
for unpaid fines and fees is especially prob-
lematic during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
when the unemployment rate is the highest 
it has been since the Great Depression. 
(8) Drunk and dangerous driving are some 
of the leading causes of death and serious 
bodily injury in the United States, and pro-
moting safety on the roads is a legitimate, 
necessary, and core governmental function. 
Suspending a license for unsafe driving con-
duct presents different considerations than 
suspending a license for unpaid fines and 
fees. Suspending a license for unsafe driving 
is an appropriate tool to protect public safe-
ty. Policymakers also may consider alter-
natives to suspension of a license for unsafe 
driving such as ignition interlock device pro-
grams. 
(9) According to the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, every year on 
average, over 34,000 people are killed and 
2,400,000 more people are injured in motor ve-
hicle crashes. Some of the major causes of 
these crashes include speeding, impaired 
driving, and distracted driving. Nearly half 
of passenger vehicle occupants killed in 
crashes are unrestrained. The societal harm 
caused by motor vehicle crashes has been 
valued at $836,000,000,000 annually. The en-
actment of, enforcement of, and education 
regarding traffic laws are key to addressing 
unsafe behavior and promoting public safety. 
(10) However, most driver’s license suspen-
sions are not based on the need to protect 
public safety. 
(11) In the State of Florida, 1,100,000 resi-
dents received a suspension notice for unpaid 
fines and fees in 2017 alone. 
(12) Between 2010 and 2017, all but 3 States 
increased the amount of fines and fees for 
civil and criminal violations. 
(13) In the United States, 40 percent of all 
driver’s license suspensions are issued for 
conduct that was unrelated to driving. 
(14) In 2015, the State of Washington cal-
culated that State troopers spent 70,848 
hours dealing with license suspensions for 
non-driving offenses. 
(15) The American Association of Motor 
Vehicle Administrators estimated that ar-
resting a person for driving with a suspended 
license can take 9 hours of an officer’s time, 
including waiting for a tow truck, trans-
porting an individual to jail, filling out pa-
perwork, making a court appearance, and 
other administrative duties and accordingly 
Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste 
called non-driving suspensions a ‘‘drain on 
the system as a whole’’. 
(16) The Colorado Department of Motor Ve-
hicles determined that suspending driver’s 
licenses for offenses unrelated to driving 
consumed 8,566 hours per year of staff time 
in the Department. 
(17) Many States impose a significant fee 
for reinstating a suspended driver’s license, 
such as Alabama, where the fee is $275. 
(18) Driving on a suspended license is one 
of the most common criminal charges in ju-
risdictions across the country. 
(19) Seventy-five percent of those with sus-
pended licenses report continuing to drive. 
(20) It is more likely that those people are 
also driving without insurance due to the 
costs and restrictions associated with ob-
taining auto insurance on a suspended li-
cense, thereby placing a greater financial 
burden on other drivers when a driver with a 
suspended license causes an accident. 
(21) The American Association of Motor 
Vehicle Administrators has concluded the 
following: ‘‘Drivers who have been suspended 
for social non-conformance-related offenses 
are often trapped within the system. Some 
cannot afford to pay the original fines, and 
may lose their ability to legally get to and 
from work as a result of the suspension. 
Many make the decision to drive while sus-
pended. The suspension results in increased

financial obligations through new require-
ments such as reinstatement fees, court 
costs, and other penalties. While there is a 
clear societal interest in keeping those who 
are unfit to drive off the roads, broadly re-
stricting licenses for violations unrelated to 
an individual’s ability to drive safely may do 
more harm than good. This is especially true 
in areas of the country that lack alternative 
means of transportation. For those individ-
uals, a valid driver license can be a means to 
survive. Local communities, employers, and 
employees 
all 
experience 
negative 
con-
sequences as a result of social non-con-
formity suspensions, including unemploy-
ment, lower wages, fewer employment oppor-
tunities and hiring choices, and increased in-
surance costs.’’. 
(22) A report by the Harvard Law School 
Criminal Justice Policy Program concluded 
the following: ‘‘The suspension of a driver’s 
or professional license is one of the most per-
vasive poverty traps for poor people assessed 
a fine that they cannot afford to pay. The 
practice is widespread. Nearly 40 percent of 
license suspensions nationwide stem from 
unpaid fines, missed child support payments, 
and drug offenses—not from unsafe or intoxi-
cated driving or failing to obtain automotive 
insurance. Suspension of a driver’s or profes-
sional licenses is hugely counterproductive; 
it punishes non-payment by taking away a 
person’s means for making a living. License 
suspension programs are also expensive for 
States to run and they distract law enforce-
ment efforts from priorities related to public 
safety. License suspensions may also be un-
constitutional if the license was suspended 
before the judge determined the defendant 
had the ability to pay the criminal justice 
debt.’’.

SEC. 1286. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. 
Funds authorized to be appropriated pursu-
ant to section 1287 should be made available 
as follows, consistent with the overall stra-
tegic direction and capabilities of the De-
partment of State and the United States 
Agency for International Development: 
(1) For the Department of State, such 
funds should be the responsibility of the As-
sistant Secretary of State for Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Labor, except for funds 
provided to the NED. Such funds shall be 
made available as grants and should have as 
their primary purpose democracy programs 
that are incorporated into a larger diplo-
matic strategy and are flexible, innovative, 
and responsive to— 
(A) current human rights abuses and de-
mocracy deficiencies as documented in the 
annual Country Report on Human Rights 
Practices required by sections 116(d) and 
502B(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 
(22 U.S.C. 2151n(d), 2304(b)); and 
(B) emerging opportunities and sudden cri-
ses. 
(2) For USAID, such funds should have as 
their primary purpose flexible, innovative,

often 
coordinated 
through a Country Development Cooperation 
Strategy, and conducted in countries where 
a USAID Mission is present or a where a 
USAID Mission in a neighboring country can 
manage and oversee such programs effec-
tively. Such programs should, as appro-
priate, build enduring local capacity, incor-
porate democracy programming into a larger 
development and diplomatic strategy, and 
emphasize participatory and locally led pro-
grams when possible. Funds made available 
for civil society and political competition 
and consensus building programs abroad 
shall be provided in a manner that recog-
nizes the benefits of grants and cooperative 
agreements in implementing such programs. 
(3) In cases where both the Department of 
State and USAID are able to respond to 
emerging opportunities and sudden crises, 
including in closed and repressive societies, 
the Secretary of State and the USAID Ad-
ministrator shall coordinate their respective

SEC. 10ll. DESIGNATION OF OSWALDO PAYA´  
WAY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the revolution led by Fidel Castro in 
Cuba in 1959 started 61 years of an ongoing 
dictatorship, systemic human rights abuses, 
and a lack of basic freedom of press, religion, 
assembly, and association that continue to 
this day under the Communist rule of Rau´ l 
Castro and his successor, Miguel Dı´az-Canel; 
(2) Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as was a Cuban po-
litical dissident dedicated to promoting 
democratic freedoms and human rights in 
Cuba; 
(3) the Communist Party of Cuba has al-
ways viewed that commitment to democracy 
and freedom as a threat to the existence of 
the Communist Party of Cuba; 
(4) on July 22, 2012, a violent car crash, 
widely believed to have been carried out by 
the Castro regime, took the lives of Oswaldo 
Paya´ and Harold Cepero, another dissident; 
(5) the official investigation into the crash 
has been demonstrated to be compromised, 
and the Castro regime has offered no plau-
sible evidence of the innocence of the Castro 
regime 
in 
the 
crash, 
leaving 
the 
cir-
cumstances of the death of Oswaldo Paya´ un-
known; 
(6) opposition by Oswaldo Paya´
to the 
Communist Party of Cuba began at a young 
age, when he refused to become a member of 
the Young Communist League as a primary 
school student, and continued through high 
school, when he publicly criticized the inva-
sion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union;

sponded to the opposition by Oswaldo Paya´ 
to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the So-
viet Union by sending Oswaldo Paya´
to a 
labor camp for 3 years; 
(8) Oswaldo Paya´ forewent a chance to es-
cape Cuba in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, decid-
ing instead to continue the fight for democ-
racy in Cuba, saying, ‘‘This is what I am sup-
posed to be, this is what I have to do.’’;

political reforms through peaceful protests, 
Oswaldo Paya´
was awarded the Sakharov

pean Parliament in 2002 and the W. Averell 
Harriman Democracy Award from the Na-
tional 
Democratic 
Institute 
for 
Inter-
national Affairs in 2003 and was nominated

President Va´clav Havel in 2005; 
(11) on April 11, 2018, the Senate unani-
mously passed S. Res. 224, recognizing the 
sixth anniversary of the death of Oswaldo 
Paya´
Sardin˜ as, commemorating his legacy 
and commitment to democratic values and 
principles, and calling on the Cuban govern-
ment to allow an impartial, third-party in-
vestigation into the circumstances sur-
rounding his death; and 
(12) renaming the street in front of the Em-
bassy of Cuba in the District of Columbia 
after Oswaldo Paya´ serves as an expression 
of solidarity between the people of the 
United States and the people of the Cuba, 
who are engaged in a long, nonviolent strug-
gle for fundamental human rights.

SEC. 1276. AFGHAN VETTING ACCOUNTABILITY. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be

Act of 2022’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Office of the Inspector General of 
the Department of Homeland Security con-
ducted an audit, which included meetings 
with more than 130 individuals from the De-
partment of Homeland Security, to deter-
mine the extent to which the Department of 
Homeland Security screened, vetted, and in-
spected evacuees arriving as part of Oper-
ation Allies Refuge and Operation Allies 
Welcome. 
(2) In the report resulting from such audit, 
‘‘DHS Encountered Obstacles to Screen, Vet, 
and Inspect All Evacuees during the Recent 
Afghanistan Crisis’’, which was issued on 
September 6, 2022, the Inspector General of 
the Department of Homeland Security found 
that— 
(A) ‘‘[t]he United States welcomed more 
than 79,000 Afghan evacuees between July 
2021 and January 2022, as part of [Operation 
Allies Refuge and Operation Allies Wel-
come]’’; 
(B) ‘‘[t]he President directed the Secretary 
of Homeland Security to lead the coordina-
tion across the Federal Government to reset-
tle vulnerable Afghans arriving as part of 
[Operation Allies Welcome]’’; 
(C) ‘‘[the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity] encountered obstacles to screen, vet, 
and inspect all Afghan evacuees arriving as 
part of Operation Allies Refuge and Oper-
ation Allies Welcome’’; 
(D) ‘‘U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
did not always have critical data to properly 
screen, vet, or inspect the evacuees’’; 
(E) ‘‘some information used to vet evac-
uees through U.S. Government databases, 
such as name, date of birth, identification 
number, and travel document data, was inac-
curate, incomplete, or missing’’; and 
(F) ‘‘[U.S. Customs and Border Protection] 
admitted or paroled evacuees who were not 
fully vetted into the United States’’. 
(3) The Office of the Inspector General of 
the Department of Homeland Security at-
tributed the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s challenges with respect to properly 
screening, vetting, and inspecting such evac-
uees to not having— 
(A) a list of evacuees from Afghanistan 
who were unable to provide sufficient identi-
fication documents; 
(B) a contingency plan to support similar 
emergency situations; and 
(C) standardized policies. 
(4) As a result of such deficiencies, the De-
partment of Homeland Security may have 
admitted or paroled individuals into the 
United States who pose a risk to the na-
tional security of the United States and to 
the safety of local communities.

than 30 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Commissioner of U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection shall—

who— 
(A) were paroled into the United States 
during the period beginning on July 14, 2021, 
and ending on February 19, 2022, as part of 
Operation Allies Refuge or Operation Allies 
Welcome; and 
(B) remain in the United States; 
(2) for each such Afghan evacuee, conduct 
a full screening and vetting, including by 
consulting all law enforcement and inter-
national terrorist screening databases, based 
on the confirmed identity of the evacuee; 
(3) prioritize the screening and vetting de-
scribed in paragraph (2) for such evacuees 
who did not have documentation of their 
identity on arrival in the United States; 
(4) establish recurrent and periodic vetting 
processes for all such evacuees, including in- 
person interviews, to the extent necessary; 
(5) ensure that the vetting processes de-
scribed in paragraph (4) are carried out for 
each such evacuee for the duration of the au-
thorized period of parole of the evacuee; and 
(6) submit evidence to the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, the Attorney General, 
and the head of each State and local law en-
forcement agency with jurisdiction over a 
place where an Afghan evacuee resides that 
the full screening and vetting described in 
paragraph (2) and the recurrent and periodic 
vetting processes described in paragraph (4) 
have been carried out. 
(d) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the In-
spector General of the Department of Home-
land Security shall submit a report to the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs of the Senate and the

(1) the findings and results of the re-
screening and vetting required under sub-
section (c); and

fol-
lowing: 
(1) Taiwan is a free and prosperous democ-
racy of nearly 24,000,000 people and is an im-
portant contributor to peace and stability 
around the world. 
(2) Section 2(b) of the Taiwan Relations 
Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301(b)) states 
that it is the policy of the United States— 
(A) ‘‘to preserve and promote extensive, 
close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and 
other relations between the people of the 
United States and the people on Taiwan, as 
well as the people on the China mainland and

with the People’s Republic of China rests 
upon the expectation that the future of Tai-
wan will be determined by peaceful means’’;

other forms of coercion that would jeop-
ardize the security, or the social or economic 
system, of the people on Taiwan’’.

Ing-wen as President of Taiwan in 2016, the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China has intensified its efforts to pressure 
Taiwan through diplomatic isolation and

vers in and around the Taiwan Strait illus-
trate a clear threat to Taiwan’s security.

(1) both the United States and Taiwan have 
made significant strides since 1979 in bol-
stering their defense relationship;

matically increased the capability of its 
military forces since 1979; 
(3) the People’s Republic of China has in 
recent years increased the use of its military 
forces to harass and provoke Taiwan with 
the threat of overwhelming force; and 
(4) it is the policy of the United States to 
consider any effort to determine the future

SEC. 3118. PLAN TO ACCELERATE RESTORATION 
OF DOMESTIC URANIUM ENRICH-
MENT. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States is engaged in a period 
of intense strategic competition with 2 peer 
adversaries, each of which aims to develop 
nuclear forces superior to the nuclear forces 
of the United States and its allies in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization; 
(2) successfully deterring the aims of such 
adversaries and preserving the national secu-
rity of the United States and the security of 
its allies requires that the United States 
maintain a capable, credible nuclear force, 
including the capability to produce the ma-
terials needed to manufacture nuclear weap-
ons and provide reliable sources of energy for 
naval vessels and military facilities; and 
(3) a key component to achieving those 
goals is the restoration of the domestic ura-
nium enrichment capability of the United 
States, a component that will allow the 
United States to make significant strides to-
ward improved energy independence by re-
ducing reliance on international sources of 
enriched uranium and opening up tremen-
dous opportunities for improving the com-
petitiveness of the United States in the 
international energy economy. 
(b) PLAN.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than June 1, 
2023, the Secretary of Defense, in coordina-
tion with the Administrator for Nuclear Se-
curity, shall submit to the congressional de-
fense committees a plan to restore the do-
mestic uranium enrichment capability of the 
United States by not later than 2035. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The plan required by para-
graph (1) shall include the following ele-
ments: 
(A) Recommendations restore unobligated 
uranium production, conversion and enrich-
ment capabilities, including production of 
high-enriched uranium— 
(i) to refurbish the nuclear weapons stock-
pile of the United States over a period of not 
more than 30 years; 
(ii) to satisfy the annual requirements of 
the United States for naval reactor fuel, in-
cluding projections for satisfying fuel re-
quirements for all submarines developed 
using reactor designs and technology of the 
United States; and 
(iii) to satisfy the annual requirements of 
the United States for defense nuclear power 
reactors. 
(B) Recommendations to improve the pro-
duction capacity of unobligated low-enriched 
uranium needed to satisfy annual tritium 
production requirements for the nuclear 
weapons stockpile of the United States and 
associated research and development objec-
tives. 
(C) Such other recommendations and infor-
mation as the Secretary of Defense or the 
Administrator for Nuclear Security consider 
appropriate.

Mr. COONS, and Mr. BLUNT) submitted 
an amendment intended to be proposed 
to amendment SA 5499 submitted by

SEC. 1214. AUSTRALIA-UNITED STATES LEGISLA-
TIVE EXCHANGE PROGRAM. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Indo-Pacific region is among the 
fastest-growing regions of the world and is 
the most important region for United States 
interests. 
(2) The strategic challenges emerging from 
the Indo-Pacific region require collaboration 
and 
cooperative 
solutions 
between 
the 
United States and its allies and partners. 
(3) Australia has been one of the United 
States’ closest allies for well over 100 years. 
This ‘‘Mateship’’ began with the visit of the 
American Great White Fleet to Sydney Har-
bor in 1908. The United States-Australia 
bond was soon sealed as troops from both 
countries fought and died together in World 
War I. 
(4) Since World War I, Australians and 
Americans— 
(A) have supported each other in every 
major military conflict in which the United 
States was involved; and 
(B) have mutually supported each another 
in intelligence-sharing. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States must continue to 
build and maintain strong relationships with 
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region 
to successfully protect its vital interests and 
to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region; 
(2) the Australia-United States relation-
ship will continue to be vital throughout the 
21st century and beyond; 
(3) as the Australia-United States alliance 
evolves, it is necessary that emerging lead-
ers in both countries develop a deeper under-
standing of their ally’s view of the world; 
and 
(4) exchange programs between foreign pol-
icy and national security staff from the 
United States Congress and the Australian 
Parliament will further bind our nations to-
gether. 
(c) ESTABLISHMENT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The majority leader of the 
Senate, the minority leader of the Senate, 
the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
and the minority leader of the House of Rep-
resentatives, working through a designated 
nonprofit, such as a think tank, a founda-
tion, or another suitable organization con-
tracted by the Department of Defense com-
petitive award process, shall work with ap-
propriate leaders of the Australian Par-
liament to establish the Australia-United 
States Legislative Exchange Program (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘Program’’). 
(2) PURPOSE.—The purpose of the Program 
shall be to coordinate annual 1 to 2 week leg-
islative exchanges between United States 
congressional 
staff 
and 
Australian 
par-
liamentary staff that focus on foreign policy, 
national security, and other issues of mutual 
interest between both countries. 
(3) SELECTION OF STAFF.— 
(A) CONGRESSIONAL STAFF.—In carrying out 
the Program, the congressional leaders re-
ferred to in paragraph (1), in consultation 
with the head of the nonprofit designated 
pursuant to paragraph (1), shall jointly se-
lect a bipartisan, bicameral group of con-
gressional staff for each exchange described 
in paragraph (2). 
(B) PARLIAMENTARY STAFF.—It is the sense 
of Congress that leaders in the Australian 
Parliament will select a politically balanced 
group of Australian parliamentary staff who 
will participate in each exchange described 
in paragraph (2). 
(4) VENUES.—The exchanges described in 
paragraph (2) shall take place primarily in 
Washington, D.C. and Canberra, Australia, 
but may include opportunities for staff— 
(A) to engage in cultural immersion activi-
ties; and 
(B) to tour other key regions in each coun-
try in accordance with the purposes of the 
Program. 
(5) PROGRAM ACTIVITIES.—Program partici-
pants, while visiting the partner country, 
shall— 
(A) meet with senior executive branch and 
legislative 
branch 
officials, 
think 
tank 
scholars, and nonprofit advocacy groups; and 
(B) 
participate 
in 
specially-designed 
courses covering the politics and foreign pol-
icy issues in such country with the intent to 
foster a deeper understanding of the political 
environment in which their counterparts op-
erate. 
(6) CONSULTATION.—In managing the Pro-
gram on behalf of the congressional leaders 
referred to in paragraph (1), the head of the 
nonprofit designated pursuant to paragraph 
(1) shall consult with, and accepting guid-
ance from, senior staff of the Committee on 
Armed Services of the Senate, the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, 
the Committee on Armed Services of the 
House of Representatives, and the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
Representatives. 
(7) ALUMNI NETWORK.—The head of the non-
profit designated pursuant to paragraph (1) 
shall establish an alumni network program, 
in cooperation with a representative of the 
Australian Parliament, that brings together 
past alumni of the program for special 
events or programs that provide for further 
exchanges and lasting relationships between 
policymakers and leaders in both countries.

SEC. 155. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON USE OF 
TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP MODEL 
FOR PROCUREMENT OF NONTAC-
TICAL VEHICLES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) It is financially prudent for the Depart-
ment of Defense to procure cost-effective 
zero-emission vehicles by considering the 
total cost of ownership (referred to in this 
section as ‘‘TCO’’) of such vehicles. 
(2) A TCO procurement model would ac-
count for operating costs of vehicles, includ-
ing fuel, maintenance, and public health sav-
ings. 
(3) Use of a TCO procurement model by the 
Department of Defense in the procurement of 
nontactical vehicles would maximize cost 
savings and bolster energy and national se-
curity. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) the Department of Defense should cal-
culate and consider the TCO when procuring 
a nontactical vehicle; and 
(2) the Department of Defense, when con-
ducting any action with the Government 
Services Administration relating to the pro-
curement or requisition of a nontactical ve-
hicle, should— 
(A) work with the Department of Energy to 
develop a TCO procurement model that uses 
State-wide, regional, and inventory variables 
to estimate the cost of converting the non-
tactical vehicle fleet of the Department of 
Defense to zero-emission vehicles; 
(B) submit to Congress a report summa-
rizing such procurement or requisition that, 
at a minimum, identifies— 
(i) types of vehicles by— 
(I) size; and 
(II) fuel source; and 
(ii) the total estimated cost savings and 
avoided emissions that result or would have 
resulted from the purchase or lease of a zero- 
emission vehicle instead of an internal com-
bustion engine vehicle; 
(C) 
incorporate 
the 
TCO 
procurement 
model developed under subparagraph (A) into 
any such procurement or requisition action; 
and 
(D) authorize any exemptions from use of 
the TCO procurement model developed under 
subparagraph (A) as the Secretary of Defense 
considers appropriate, including by— 
(i) authorizing exemptions for certain cat-
egories of vehicles, including emergency ve-
hicles or other nontactical vehicles as deter-
mined by the Secretary, when a vehicle type 
is not available for the needed application; 
(ii) authorizing exemptions upon finding 
that a zero-emission vehicle is not a prac-
ticable alternative to an internal combus-
tion engine vehicle for a particular use, or 
for some other compelling reason; and 
(iii) developing guidance regarding proce-
dures for requesting such exemptions, in-
cluding the criteria for evaluating such ex-
emption requests, which should be published 
on the website of the Department of Defense 
and given a 30-day period for public review 
and comment before the Department adopts 
or revises such guidance.

Subtitle ll—HBCU RISE Act 
SEC. lll1. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘HBCU 
Research, Innovation, Security, and Excel-
lence Act’’ or the ‘‘HBCU RISE Act’’. 
SEC. lll2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Historically Black colleges and univer-
sities hold a unique position in the efforts of 
the United States to diversify the science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics 
academic and workforce communities. 
(2) Although our Nation’s historically 
Black colleges and universities make up just 
3 percent of the colleges and universities in 
the United States, historically Black col-
leges and universities graduate 25 percent of 
African-American 
students 
with 
bacca-
laureate degrees in the fields of science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics. 
(3) Historically Black colleges and univer-
sities are the institution of origin for almost 
30 percent of Black graduates of science and 
engineering doctorate programs. 
(4) The health of the Department of De-
fense and the United States research eco-
system relies on high quality researchers 
from a diverse talent pool. 
(5) Historically Black colleges and univer-
sities have a history of conducting high qual-
ity research in unique areas, both providing 
impactful research outcomes and developing 
the next generation of the research eco-
system, including by— 
(A) conducting high quality research in 
unique areas that has enriched the Depart-
ment of Defense research enterprise and the 
United States research ecosystem; 
(B) strengthening and diversifying the 
United States research ecosystem by in-
creasing the number of students who are stu-
dents of diverse backgrounds from histori-
cally Black colleges and universities with 
undergraduate 
or 
graduate 
degrees 
in 
science, technology, engineering, or mathe-
matics; and 
(C) fueling domestic and international col-
laborations that led to trailblazing discov-
eries and innovative technologies. 
(6) In 2019, historically Black colleges and 
universities received $371,000,000, or about 0.8 
percent of the $44,500,000,000 in Federal fund-
ing to institutions of higher education for re-
search and development. The amount of 
funding for 2019 is a marked decrease from 
fiscal year 2018, when historically Black col-
leges and universities received $400,000,000 in 
Federal research and development funding 
(0.9 percent of the Federal funding to institu-
tions of higher education for such purposes). 
(7) There are no historically Black colleges 
and universities designated as very high re-
search activity status, as classified by the 
Carnegie Classification of Institutions of 
Higher Education. 
(8) Meaningfully investing in the research 
capacity of historically Black colleges and 
universities is an investment in our Nation’s 
future and will help meet accelerating 
science, technology, engineering, and mathe-
matics workforce demands and safeguard the 
national security interests of the United 
States. 
SEC. lll3. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of the program established 
under this subtitle is to provide additional 
pathways needed for further increasing ca-
pacity at historically Black colleges and uni-
versities to achieve and maintain very high 
research activity status. 
SEC. lll4. DEFINITIONS. 
In this subtitle:

ble institution’’ means a historically Black 
college or university that is classified as a 
high research activity status institution at 
the time of application for a grant under sec-
tion 5. 
(2) HIGH RESEARCH ACTIVITY STATUS.—The 
term ‘‘high research activity status’’ means 
R2 status, as classified by the Carnegie Clas-
sification of Institutions of Higher Edu-
cation. 
(3) HISTORICALLY
BLACK
COLLEGE
OR
UNI-
VERSITY.—The term ‘‘historically Black col-
lege or university’’ has the meaning given 
the term ‘‘part B institution’’ under section 
322 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 1061). 
(4) 
SECRETARY.—The 
term 
‘‘Secretary’’ 
means the Secretary of Defense. 
(5) VERY HIGH RESEARCH ACTIVITY STATUS.— 
The term ‘‘very high research activity sta-
tus’’ means R1 status, as classified by the

Higher Education. 
(6) VERY HIGH RESEARCH ACTIVITY STATUS 
INDICATORS.—The term ‘‘very high research 
activity status indicators’’ means the cat-
egories used by the Carnegie Classification 
of Institutions of Higher Education to delin-
eate which institutions have very high activ-
ity status, including— 
(A) annual expenditures in science and en-
gineering; 
(B) per-capita (faculty member) expendi-
tures in science and engineering;

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—For each fiscal year, the

lated to the direct review of biosimilar bio-
logical product applications and supple-
ments, including additional formal meeting 
types, the direct review of postmarketing 
commitments and requirements, the direct 
review of risk evaluation and mitigation 
strategies, and the direct review of annual

paragraph result in fee revenue for a fiscal 
year that is less than the sum of the 
amounts under subsections (b)(1)(A) (the an-
nual base revenue for the fiscal year), 
(b)(1)(B) (the dollar amount of the inflation 
adjustment for the fiscal year), and (b)(1)(C) 
(the dollar amount of the strategic hiring 
and retention adjustment).

The Secretary shall publish in the Federal 
Register notice under paragraph (5) the fee 
revenue and fees resulting from the adjust-
ment and the methodologies under this para-
graph. 
‘‘(4) OPERATING RESERVE ADJUSTMENT.— 
‘‘(A) INCREASE.—For fiscal year 2023 and 
subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary shall, 
in addition to adjustments under paragraphs 
(1), (2), and (3), further increase the fee rev-
enue and fees if such an adjustment is nec-
essary to provide for at least 10 weeks of op-
erating reserves of carryover user fees for 
the process for the review of biosimilar bio-
logical product applications.

retary shall decrease such fee revenue and 
fees to provide for not more than 21 weeks of 
such operating reserves.

justment under subparagraph (A) or (B) is 
made, the rationale for the amount of the in-
crease or decrease (as applicable) in fee rev-
enue and fees shall be contained in the an-
nual Federal Register notice under para-

for the fiscal year involved.’’; and

This division may be cited as the ‘‘Her-
mit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance 
Act’’. 
SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) on April 6, 2022, the Forest Service initi-
ated the Las Dispensas-Gallinas prescribed 
burn on Federal land in the Santa Fe Na-
tional Forest in San Miguel County, New 
Mexico, when erratic winds were prevalent in 
the area that was also suffering from severe 
drought after many years of insufficient pre-
cipitation; 
(2) on April 6, 2022, the prescribed burn, 
which became known as the ‘‘Hermit’s Peak 
Fire’’, exceeded the containment capabilities 
of the Forest Service, was declared a wild-
fire, and spread to other Federal and non- 
Federal land; 
(3) on April 19, 2022, the Calf Canyon Fire, 
also in San Miguel County, New Mexico, 
began burning on Federal land and was later 
identified as the result of a pile burn in Jan-
uary 2022 that remained dormant under the 
surface before reemerging; 
(4) on April 27, 2022, the Hermit’s Peak Fire 
and the Calf Canyon Fire merged, and both 
fires were reported as the Hermit’s Peak Fire 
or the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire, 
which shall be referred to hereafter as the 
Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire; 
(5) by May 2, 2022, the fire had grown in 
size and caused evacuations in multiple vil-
lages and communities in San Miguel County 
and Mora County, including in the San 
Miguel county jail, the State’s psychiatric 
hospital, the United World College, and New 
Mexico Highlands University; 
(6) on May 4, 2022, the President issued a 
major disaster declaration for the counties 
of Colfax, Mora, and San Miguel, New Mex-
ico; 
(7) on May 20, 2022, U.S. Forest Service 
Chief Randy Moore ordered a 90-day review 
of prescribed burn policies to reduce the risk 
of wildfires and ensure the safety of the com-
munities involved; 
(8) the U.S. Forest Service has assumed re-
sponsibility for the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Can-
yon Fire; 
(9) the fire resulted in the loss of Federal, 
State, local, Tribal, and private property; 
and 
(10) the United States should compensate 
the victims of the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Can-
yon Fire. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
are— 
(1) to compensate victims of the Hermit’s 
Peak/Calf Canyon Fire, for injuries resulting 
from the fire; and 
(2) to provide for the expeditious consider-
ation and settlement of claims for those in-
juries.
