PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Merciful God, we enter this Chamber 
with a sense both of uncertainty and of 
indignation. The events of last week, 
the destruction, the damage, and the 
deaths of our fellow Americans are 
deeply disturbing. The seeds of dis-
content were sown across our country, 
and we have reaped the whirlwind. 
Almighty God, speak into this storm. 
Allow Your holy spirit to descend upon 
the chaos and minister to our hearts. 
Still our fears, that we would remain 
firm in our resolve. Still our anger, 
that we would yield ourselves to Your 
gracious design for this Nation. Lord, 
vindicate Your intent for us to serve as 
representatives not just of our dis-
tricts, but of Your will. Your love, 
Lord, endures forever. We pray, do not 
abandon the work of Your hands. 
And as the spirit moves among us, in-
spire us again with Your purpose. Stir 
in us anew the desire to serve You well 
and faithfully as we seek to serve this 
divided country. 
Call us to hear the words of Your 
mouth and praise You with our lives 
this day and in the days to come. 
For we pray these things in the 
strength of Your holy name. 
Amen.

INSPECTOR GENERAL PROTECTION 
ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 23, the Inspector General Protection Act, 
a straightforward, bipartisan bill to protect the 
role of our inspectors general, Since Congress 
passed the Inspector General Act of 1978, in-
spectors general have played a crucial role in 
our democracy. 
These government watchdogs root out 
waste, fraud, mismanagement, and abuse at 
all levels of government—saving the American 
taxpayer billions of dollars annually and ensur-
ing government programs benefit the People. 
One Government Accountability Office study 
concluded that the 73 Offices of Inspectors 
General saved taxpayers $43.3 billion in 2009, 
marking roughly an $18 return for every dollar 
invested in our nation’s inspectors general. By 
making inspectors general independent from 
the agencies they oversee, Congress signaled 
the importance of nonpartisan oversight that 
defines their role today. Our legislation, the In-
spector General Protection Act of 2021, en-
sures the independence and integrity of our 
nation’s inspectors general by combating two 
threats to these offices, 
First, H.R. 23 requires notification to Con-
gress in advance of an inspector general 
being placed on paid or unpaid non-duty sta-
tus, or incurring a change in status. This en-
sures Congress is aware of any potential at-
tempts to improperly sideline an inspector 
general. Second, the bill requires the Presi-
dent to report to Congress if an inspector gen-
eral has not been nominated within 210 days 
after a vacancy occurs for the position, includ-
ing the reasons a nomination has not been 
made and a target date for doing so. This re-
asserts Congress’ oversight role and allows 
Members to question—on an informed basis— 
the decision of any future administration to 
leave core offices vacant, which has histori-
cally been an all-too-common practice among 
presidents of both parties. 
I would like to express my gratitude to sev-
eral individuals for this legislation. First, to the 
late Elijah Cummings, the kind and generous 
former Chairman of the House Oversight and 
Reform Committee, who worked tirelessly to 
ensure the United States Government worked 
for all people, including by doggedly rooting 
out waste and fraud. He first passed the In-
spector General Protection Act through the 
Oversight and Reform Committee two years 
ago. Since then, the House has signaled its 
support for this legislation by passing the bill 
in numerous forms, including as part of the 
HEROES Act in May 2020. 
Next, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague, Representative JODY
HICE
from 
Georgia, for joining me in co-leading this bi-
partisan, commonsense legislation. Congress-
man HICE has been a valuable partner on nu-
merous oversight initiatives, including our re-
cent Oversight.gov Authorization Act, which 
was signed into law as part of the omnibus 
package last week. I thank him and his staff 
in the personal office and on Committee for 
their continued partnership. Finally, my thanks 
to Chairwoman CAROLYN MALONEY for her tire-
less work to hold those in power accountable 
to the people—including by supporting our 
many initiatives to strengthen our inspectors 
general. 
Chairwoman MALONEY is an invaluable lead-
er in the fight for good government. I urge my 
colleagues to support this narrowly tailored yet 
crucial legislation to protect our nation’s in-
spectors general, saving the taxpayer billions 
of dollars and ensuring the government works 
for the people.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. JOYCE BEATTY 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I was ab-
sent from the House Chamber on January 5, 
2021, to attend a funeral in my district. Had I 
been present, I would have voted yes on Roll 
Call number 9.

HONORING BRENT GROOME 
HON. TOM RICE 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
South Carolinian, Brent Groome. 
Mr. Groome has served Horry Telephone 
Cooperative and the region’s telecommuni-
cations industry over the last three decades. 
He currently serves as Chief Executive of Cor-
porate Communications and Government Re-
lations but will be retiring this month. Through-
out his tenure, Brent has served as a strong 
advocate for telephone and broadband ad-
vancements in South Carolina. 
Brent has certainly achieved many accom-
plishments over his career. He has dem-
onstrated consistent engagement and a com-
mitment to excellence while serving on numer-
ous industry boards during his career in tele-
communications. Brent’s commitment to the 
community goes beyond his career. He has 
been a tireless ambassador for many local 
non-profit and philanthropic organizations. 
Madam Speaker, I join his family and the 
people of Horry Telephone Cooperative in rec-
ognizing Brent Groome. We thank him for his 
service and commitment to our community. 
REMEMBERING FURMAN STEWART 
BALDWIN 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, along 
with Congresswoman JACKIE SPEIER, I rise to 
recognize the life of World War II veteran, 
Furman Stewart Baldwin, who passed away 
on December 7, 2020 at his home, in Millbrae, 
California. 
Furman was born on August 27, 1922, in 
Buffalo, New York. As a child he spent time 
on school, working in his father’s professional 
photo studio, and doing gymnastics. It was 
through gymnastics that he met the love of his 
life, Margaret, who everybody called Peg or 
Peggy. 
In 1943, Furman and Peggy married, and 
he was commissioned as a U.S. Navy officer 
and pilot. He was active in the Pacific theater. 
Furman finished his bachelor’s degree after 
the war and started working in television, at 
WBEN in Buffalo. While working in live tele-
vision at WBEN, eventually becoming a pro-
ducer/director, he also went back to school; he 
earned a master’s degree at the University of 
Buffalo. 
After 15 years at WBEN, Furman became 
head of the Audiovisual Branch of the U.S. 
Military Academy at West Point. He received 
several awards at West Point, including the 
Department of Defense Thomas Jefferson 
Award for excellence in television production, 
before retiring in 1986. 
Following retirement, Furman and Peggy 
enjoyed traveling the world together. When 
she developed health problems, Furman al-
ways stayed with Peggy; they eventually 
moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to be 
closer to their children. 
After Peggy passed away in 2010, Furman 
enjoyed time with his friends and working on 
his computer. He even made video shows, 
‘‘Furman’s Flicks,’’ to entertain follow residents 
at his assisted living home. 
Furman demonstrated the best the ‘‘Great-
est Generation’’ had to offer. He is also re-
membered for his commitment to his family, 
his love of life, his artistic stained glass work, 
and the famous photo he took in 1947, ‘‘Il 
Baccio.’’ 
Meaning ‘‘The Kiss,’’ the photo shows a 
young boy kissing a young girl. Another young 
girl looks on, seemingly mad that the boy is 
not kissing her. The two-year-old boy in the 
picture was his son, Furman Stewart Baldwin, 
Jr. 
Furman Baldwin, Jr., survives Furman, 
along with his other children, Claire Harrison, 
and Ronald, grandchildren Justine, Eric, and 
Alexandra, and great-grandchildren Melissa 
and Megan. Predeceasing him were his wife, 
son Frederick, and grandson Michael. 
Our 
deepest 
condolences 
go 
out 
to 
Furman’s friends and loved ones.

January 11, 2021 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am proud to 
have worked side-by-side with President 
Trump to enact historic tax reform, free and 
fair trade with Mexico and Canada, the repeal 
of the ObamaCare mandate and taxes, a ban 
on surprise medical bills, and the first reform 
of the IRS in two decades. His policy achieve-
ments have lifted working families across 
America. 
Distrust in America’s election system has 
been growing for two decades and is only 
growing worse. That is the true threat to de-
mocracy. For that reason, I gave unwavering 
support for President Trump to pursue all legal 
avenues and investigations. On December 10, 
2020, I joined 125 of my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives in signing the 
Amicus Brief to the Texas petition to the Su-
preme Court of the United States. The Texas 
suit presented election irregularities and advo-
cated the Court hold states accountable for 
following their own election laws. Unfortu-
nately, the Court refused to review the case. 
Due to a COVID–19 diagnosis, I am unable 
to participate in today’s proceedings in the 
U.S. House. If I were, I would remain true to 
the conservative Constitutional principles of 
states’ rights, limited Congressional power 
over presidential elections, and the Electoral 
College by accepting the Electoral College 
votes as legally certified by each state. 
Article II of the Constitution and the 12th 
Amendment are clear. As angry as we may be 
about this election, we do even more harm if 
we weaken the Constitution, allow Congress 
to seize more power to choose future presi-
dents, and undermine the Electoral College. 
If either party in Congress can simply ignore 
the elected slate of a state for political rea-
sons, aren’t we replacing 150 million votes 
with 535 in Congress? Doesn’t that change 
‘‘We the People’’ to ‘‘We the Congress’’? 
Democrats in the past have blatantly at-
tempted to overturn elections in Congress and 
seize more of this electoral power for Con-
gress. It was a violation of the Constitution 
then, and remains so today. 
I deeply respect my fellow Republicans who 
see this issue differently. 
I worry that if we help undermine the Elec-
toral College out of frustration and anger, we 
lend fuel to the liberal national popular vote 
scheme, inevitably we will one day stand on 
the sidelines as voters in only the largest cities 
determine our President. 
Our nation’s founders rejected this as dan-
gerous to our nation’s governance. I do too. 
The Electoral College ensures we have a 
President who is accountable to all the nation, 
and can be a Republican, a conservative, or 
a grassroots outsider if America so chooses. 
f 
IN HONOR OF SANDRA LEE FEWER 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Sandra Lee Fewer as she de-
parts the San Francisco Board of Supervisors 
after serving for four years, and after serving 
for a total of 12 years in elective office in San 
Francisco. The city is losing a tremendous ad-
vocate for small businesses, working families 
and struggling residents. 
Sandra Fewer and her husband, John, have 
lived in the Richmond District of San Fran-
cisco for over 50 years. They have three chil-
dren, Sara, Colleen, and Rory and the family 
has deep roots in the community. Her hus-
band spent 35 years on the police force and 
retired from the Richmond District station. 
Her children attended public schools and 
Sandra spent those early years as a PTA 
President for 12 terms. She also participated 
in school site councils, teacher appreciation 
days and organized numerous school events. 
As her participation in the community grew, so 
too did the recognition that she was a natural 
leader. She was elected to the Board of Edu-
cation in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. In 
2014, she served as Board President. 
There is so much about Sandra that can be 
summed up in a single word: Heart. For exam-
ple, from 2001 to 2009 she served as the Ex-
ecutive Director of Coleman Advocates for 
Children and Youth. This organization advo-
cates for young people across multiple issues 
impacting them in San Francisco, and before 
many major policymaking bodies. Homeless-
ness, closing the school achievement gap, 
and hunger were just a few of the causes she 
and student advocates took up. 
She was elected to the Board of Super-
visors in 2016, took office in 2017, and be-
came the first female to represent her district. 
As a Supervisor, Sandra was described by a 
local business owner as an outstanding advo-
cate for small businesses. This observation 
was made before the pandemic. 
Now, as she walks through the Richmond, 
she can see struggling small restaurants and 
stores that are boarded up. Recently, San 
Francisco offered these companies loans and 
grants, which Sandra supported. One Rich-
mond, an organization that she created, en-
courages residents to shop locally. It also en-
courages neighbors to help neighbors by vol-
unteering in the community. Its motto is, 
‘‘Have you done your One Richmond thing 
today?’’ 
Sandra takes seriously her job of helping 
those who need the most help. For example, 
she successfully pushed to obtain a state 
grant to create a nonprofit affordable housing 
developer that will someday build needed 
housing in her district. She supported creation 
of a public bank by the City of San Francisco 
in order to provide banking services and eco-
nomic development to communities ignored by 
traditional banks. 
She supported Proposition E that will facili-
tate the building of affordable housing and 
housing for educators throughout San Fran-
cisco. 65% of her constituents are renters and 
she’s offered them protections through her 
votes on the board and through these difficult 
times of the pandemic. Long after her term in 
office, her legacy of offering aid to those in 
need will produce results for those she served. 
She indicates that when she leaves office 
she will garden and renew her friendships, 
many ‘‘on hold’’ due to her board duties these 
past three years. Gardening will join medi-
tating as a hobby that she enjoys more fre-
quently with John. 
Soon, this woman of Washington High 
School, City College, Golden Gate University, 
and the fictional but illustrious Richmond Dis-
trict School of Hard Knocks, from which she 
graduated magna cum laude, will leave the 
public stage. She departs having earned dec-
ades of well wishes built from a lifetime of 
community service. On her website, she stat-
ed that as a Supervisor she would be a care-
taker for the residents of the Richmond Dis-
trict. She also noted that she understood that 
elective office is a trust. She amply dem-
onstrated both during her time on the board. 
Madam Speaker, I salute San Francisco Su-
pervisor Sandra Lee Fewer upon her depar-
ture. We may someday see her on Clement 
Street in one of the small shops or res-
taurants, and we’ll wonder what she’s doing. 
Make no mistake. Whatever her more obvious 
activity is at that moment, Sandra’s broader 
purpose will be as it always has been: To re-
main a member of her community and a friend 
to all of goodwill.

IN HONOR OF MR. DAN RIVERA OF 
LAWRENCE, MASSACHUSETTS 
HON. LORI TRAHAN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the leadership and legacy of a great 
leader and friend, Mayor Daniel ‘‘Dan’’ Rivera, 
who will retire as the 59th Mayor of the City 
of Lawrence, Massachusetts. Mayor Dan Ri-
vera is leaving his second four-year term in of-
fice early to become the President and CEO 
of MassDevelopment; the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts’ finance and economic devel-
opment agency. 
Mayor Rivera was born in New York City to 
a single mother who emigrated from the Do-
minican Republic in search of a better life for 
her family. His mother moved to Lawrence, 
Massachusetts to find work as a seamstress 
in the area’s mills, and it was in Lawrence that 
Mayor Rivera was raised and began his ca-
reer as a public servant. 
After 
graduating 
from 
Lawrence 
High 
School, Mayor Rivera enlisted in the United 
States Army and became a Military Police Of-
ficer, serving in Germany, Iraq, and Kuwait. 
After his multiple tours overseas, Mayor Ri-
vera returned home to attend the University of 
Massachusetts Amherst. Indeed, he became 
the first person in his family to graduate from 
college—something that he and I have in com-
mon. 
Prior to being elected as the City’s mayor, 
he worked tirelessly to improve the growth and 
economic development of the Merrimack Val-
ley for its residents. As an economic develop-
ment director for Congressman Marty Meehan, 
Mayor Rivera continued to bring critical invest-
ments to his hometown and communities 
across the Merrimack Valley. 
Not long after, he was elected to the Law-
rence City Council where he served as the 
Chairman of the Budget and Finance Com-
mittee. He provided key leadership in adjust-
ing the City’s budget in order to restore key 
services and personnel. Then-Councilor Ri-
vera worked to diversify the Lawrence Police 
Department by making it a majority-minority 
department with 53% of the officers making up 
individuals of color and tripling the number of 
women on the force, more accurately rep-
resenting the people of Lawrence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E25 
January 11, 2021 
In 2013, he was elected as the City’s 
mayor. Over the last seven years, he has led 
Lawrence through two major crises—the 2018 
Merrimack Valley natural gas explosions and 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Time and again, he 
has demonstrated his leadership and dedica-
tion to the residents of the great City of Law-
rence. 
The Merrimack Valley gas explosions forced 
thousands of families to flee the area, dam-
aged and destroyed dozens of homes, left 
many businesses with considerable financial 
losses, and tragically took a young man’s life. 
Throughout that period, Mayor Rivera led with 
purpose and empathy in every decision he 
made to get the City on the path of recovery, 
while fighting to ensure the community re-
ceived all necessary support and resources. 
He has been a close ally as we successfully 
advanced the Leonel Rondon Pipeline Safety 
Act. This legislation will ensure no community 
ever faces a disaster like this one again, be-
coming law in December of 2020. 
Just as the City of Lawrence was recovering 
from the natural gas explosions, the COVID– 
19 pandemic struck. Lawrence has been 
among the hardest hit communities in the 
Commonwealth by the pandemic, dispropor-
tionately impacting its large population of 
Black and brown residents. With the utmost 
transparency in communication, Mayor Rivera 
consistently urged the community to maintain 
social distance, enacted a city-wide eviction 
moratorium to protect renters, created two 
Emergency Small Business Relief Programs 
designed to help the Lawrence businesses 
and immigrant entrepreneur communities as 
they work to get back on their feet, and dili-
gently collaborated with the State and Federal 
governments to set up testing sites around the 
city. 
Mayor Rivera’s leadership and hard work 
has been recognized by various organizations. 
He was awarded Masslnc.’s Mayor Bill Car-
penter Award for Excellence in Gateway City 
Leadership in 2020, and in 2018 was recog-
nized as one of the 100 Most Influential Peo-
ple of Color in Greater Boston by Get 
Konnected. 
Through his many years of service, Mayor 
Rivera has made the City of Lawrence a bet-
ter place to call home. Thanks to his efforts, 
the City’s future is bright, and I join Lawrence 
residents in thanking him for his dedication to 
this incredible community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE INSULAR 
AREA MEDICAID PARITY ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, President- 
elect Biden has pledged to address the 
healthcare disparity in minority communities 
that the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare. 
One longstanding disparity is that our national 
Medicaid program does not reach all Ameri-
cans with full coverage. 
The Northern Mariana Islands, American 
Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Vir-
gin Islands are subject to a hard, statutory 
limit on federal Medicaid support, unlike the 
states and the District of Columbia. This cap 
means that preventative care and treatment 
for the poorest Americans in the insular areas 
will always be less available than for Ameri-
cans elsewhere. 
The final Obama-Biden administration budg-
et proposal, for fiscal year 2017, addressed 
this systemic inequity by proposing an align-
ment of insular area Medicaid programs with 
the rest of the nation, first by removing the 
cap on Medicaid funding, so that it would no 
longer operate as a block grant in any insular 
area. 
Congress has also acknowledged this in-
equity. We acted to provide more Medicaid 
funding for the insular areas by substantially 
lifting the cap through P.L. 116–94, Further 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. Pro-
visions in P.L. 116–127, the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act created equity be-
tween the states and the insular areas with re-
spect to the increase in the federal-local 
match for Medicaid. Families First, also, pro-
vided additional federal dollars for the insular 
area Medicaid programs. But our actions were 
temporary. These funding increases expire at 
the end of fiscal year 2021. 
Now, Congress must act again. And in 
doing so, we must create an enduring policy 
that safeguards the health of the poorest 
Americans in our insular areas. 
To achieve that goal, I am introducing the 
Insular Area Medicaid Parity Act. My bill aligns 
with President-elect Biden’s pledge to address 
healthcare disparities in minority communities 
by repealing the arbitrary cap on Medicaid for 
Americans in the insular areas. 
By repealing the cap, we will be doing more 
than just ensuring there are sufficient re-
sources to face the coronavirus crisis. We will 
be setting up the healthcare systems in the in-
sular areas to respond to the next public 
health challenge, whatever it may be. Most im-
portant of all, we will ensure that day-after-day 
and year-by-year those with the smallest in-
comes and no access to other insurance re-
ceive the care that will keep them healthy and 
help ward off debilitating disease. 
We will, also, be providing a level of cer-
tainty to healthcare providers—in the public 
and private sector—that will encourage invest-
ment in the health industry in the insular 
areas, which by any measure lags the rest of 
the nation. And by doing so we will create a 
virtuous cycle of rising quality of care powered 
by rising access that will benefit all at every in-
come level. 
The pandemic has brought home this truth: 
none of us can truly remain well, while some 
of us are ill. Now it is time for Congress to 
fully commit to making sure the poorest in the 
insular areas are treated equitably. 
I thank my colleagues who joined me in in-
troducing this legislation—Chairman MCGOV-
ERN, Chairwoman VELA´ZQUEZ, Chairwoman 
DELAURO, Chairman NADLER, Mr. CLEAVER II,

HONORING ALLEN CHIN 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Allen Chin, who 
passed away on November 18, 2013 at the 
age of 91. A proud Chinese Immigrant, Allen 
was a member of the Greatest Generation, 
and valiantly served our country in WWII to 
protect our freedom and American values at 
home and abroad. Allen’s life embodied the 
highest ideals of our nation, and his remark-
able courage are forever etched in our na-
tion’s history. For his service and sacrifice, 
Allen was posthumously awarded the Con-
gressional Gold Medal for his service during 
World War II. 
At 
age 
15, 
Allen 
left 
his 
family 
in 
Guangdong, China and emigrated to San 
Francisco, California with a sponsorship from 
his uncle. When WWII broke out, Allen an-
swered the call of duty and joined the U.S. 
Army. Allen was sent to serve in the Pacific 
Theater and became a machinist who helped 
train Chinese allied troops. His service instilled 
in him a deeply-held patriotism, which he 
would later inspire in future generations. 
Upon returning home to California, Allen be-
came an American citizen and sponsored his 
family in China to come to the United States. 
Allen’s first civilian career was owning and op-
erating the Sonoma House grocery store—a 
place where all in the neighborhood convened 
and shopped. He met and married his wife Lil-
lian who he called the ‘‘Pretty girl from Shang-
hai’’ and they began a long life together. 
Allen and his wife raised their daughter Ar-
lene and settled down permanently in Arizona 
to forge a new path filled with adventure. Allen 
was a devoted father and active member of 
the Tempe community. He opened and sold a 
successful Chinese restaurant, worked as a 
machinist in the semiconductor industry, and 
pursued perhaps his greatest passion: ball-
room dance. A man of dignity and honor, Al-
len’s spirit lives on with his daughter Arlene, 
who has followed in his footsteps and contin-
ued his legacy of service. She has served 
Tempe proudly becoming its first Asian-Amer-
ican city councilmember. 
We all owe a debt of gratitude to Allen for 
his selfless commitment and sacrifice. I wish 
to extend my heartfelt appreciation for all he 
has done to make our community, our state, 
and our country a better place. In this spirit of 
gratitude and remembrance, I humbly rise to 
honor his life and legacy, which will continue 
to be felt for generations to come. 
I thank Allen, and wish him Godspeed.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FARM-TO-

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS

Grant program to include rural roads that 
serve to transport agriculture products from 
farms or ranches to the marketplace. 
American agricultural communities play a 
pivotal role in the economy within my district 
and 
across 
America. 
These 
farms 
and 
ranches provide the communities they serve 
with fresh products daily, ensuring consumers 
have an adequate and healthy food supply. 
Unfortunately, many of the roads are deterio-
rating. 
Over 70 percent of our nation’s total road 
mileage is in rural areas, yet, between 2009– 
2015, these roads have only seen about 37 
percent of federal highway fund. As Congress 
debates how to move forward with a bold plan 
to address infrastructure, we need to ensure 
road-repair projects like these do not fall by 
the wayside as we seek to address other larg-
er infrastructure projects. Just because a road 
is in a rural area does not mean the road is 
small or otherwise unimportant. To the con-
trary, I am aware of several rural road projects 
in my district and the surrounding region that 
are major connectors that would benefit from 
this type of funding opportunity. 
Madam Speaker, my bill expands the cur-
rent surface block grant program to include 
these roads—roads that serve as a lifeline to 
the people that depend on them. We must in-
vest in our rural infrastructure now, before it is 
in complete disrepair. This legislation was in-
cluded in H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, 
when it passed in the House of Representa-
tives in the 116th Congress, and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to ensure 
it passes again. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this measure.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I have been

IN HONOR OF NORMAN YEE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the President of the San Fran-
cisco of Supervisors Norman Yee who is de-
parting the Board of Supervisors after eight 
years, and after serving a prior eight years as 
a commissioner on the San Francisco Board 
of Education. 
Norman is a native San Franciscan and was 
raised in Chinatown. From an early age, he 
worked at a Noe Valley grocery store owned 
by his parents. He graduated from Galileo 
Academy of Science and Technology, then at-
tended City College, and finally matriculated to 
the University of California at Berkeley, grad-
uating with a BS in Civil Engineering. He also 
holds a MA in Education from San Francisco 
State University. 
Norman Yee is an activist and leader. He 
taught ESL and citizenship classes at City 
College from 1984 to 1994, and for 18 years 
was the executive director for Wu Yee Chil-
dren’s Service, an advocacy group supporting 
child services in San Francisco. He was elect-
ed as a commissioner of the school district in 
2004 and served as its president during his 
second term. 
In 2012, he was elected to serve on the San 
Francisco Board of Supervisors. In this role, 
he sponsored or cosponsored 780 pieces of 
legislation, many of citywide significance that 
also went to the ballot. For example, in 2016 
he cosponsored Proposition W which made 
City College free for all city residents. In 2018, 
he cosponsored Proposition C to fund uni-
versal childcare. Both measures passed be-
cause San Franciscans deeply appreciate 
education. For his district, he secured more 
funding for parks, negotiated with neighbors to 
allow local businesses to expand, opposed 
short-term illegal rentals by AirBnB, pushed for 
lower speed limits on dangerous streets, and 
led efforts to boost funding for senior pro-
grams. 
He spearheaded creation of the city’s Early 
Head Start program, the Asian Parent Edu-
cation Network, the San Francisco Child Care 
Providers Association, and the Chinatown 
Beacon Center. He remains a board member 
of the San Francisco Child Care Providers As-
sociation. 
Last year, Norman Yee was elected presi-
dent of the San Francisco Board of Super-
visors. He is fair in setting agendas and works 
collaboratively with colleagues. He is also a 
leader. An example is the new housing being 
developed in his district at the Balboa res-
ervoir. 
Rents in San Francisco have declined dur-
ing the pandemic, but the long-term trend is 
sharply upward. The reservoir site is adjacent 
to the main campus of City College, a treasure 
within my district that I proudly support. Pro-
posals for housing stretch back to the 1960’s. 
A year before he was tragically taken from us, 
I personally spoke to Mayor Ed Lee about 
placing housing at this site. However, it’s hard 
to build when the public is divided. 
Supervisor Yee rolled up his sleeves to cre-
ate a proposal acceptable to most and of en-
during service to low income residents of San 
Francisco. Over time, many thousands will be 
served. 1,100 units of housing will be built, 50 
percent affordable, and 150 units will be dedi-
cated to City College faculty and staff. 
As our nation struggles to come to grips 
with systemic racism and abuses by some on 
police forces, Supervisor Yee recently placed 
onto the ballot a measure to change the way 
in which San Francisco staffs its police force. 
An existing city charter provision required San 
Francisco to have 1,971 full-time duty officers 
on the force. In November, San Francisco vot-
ers abolished this provision. This will allow the 
board, the police and community to talk about 
how the department will be staffed. 71 percent 
of the city’s voters agreed with Norman Yee 
that this change is needed to move the com-
munity forward. 
Supervisor Yee is a gentleman and a 
thoughtful public servant. I’ve known some 
elected officials who light up a room by de-
structively setting off verbal fireworks in a 
tightly crowded auditorium. Norman simply 
tells it like it is. This reassures his constituents 
that he’s not present at the meeting for adula-
tion from the crowd but for the hard work that 
produces progress. 
Madam Speaker, as Supervisor Yee exits 
public service, he will be remembered as the 
man everyone could have over for dinner be-
cause he’s so earnest and so interesting. Now 
that he’s leaving, his wife Cathy and their two 
children Karissa and Chandra may see him for 
a few more dinners. We thank them for their 
service, as well, because they also sacrificed 
for the community’s best interests during his 
time in elective office. We will see Norman on 
the streets of Westwood, his neighborhood, 
and perhaps in city hall from time to time. We 
will also remember him as the man who un-
derstood every corner of his beloved San 
Francisco because he earned the friendship of 
people throughout this great city.

HONORING MARIO LIZCANO 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Mario 
Lizcano of Edinburg, Texas for his incredible 
commitment to serve the Rio Grande Valley. 
Mario is a community leader who grew up in 
Pharr, Texas. He went to high school at PSJA 
High and attended college at the University of 
Texas San Antonio. 
Mr. Lizcano is now the Administrator of Cor-
porate Affairs at DHR Health, a physician- 
owned health system that offers some of the 
most comprehensive medical care on the U.S. 
Southern Border. Mario has been with DHR 
Health for nearly 14 years and has contributed 
significantly to the promotion of health and 
COVID–19 awareness in the Rio Grande Val-
ley. 
Mario was named Man of the Year for 2020 
by the Edinburg Chamber of Commerce for 
his magnificent record of public service. He 
was not only recognized for his work with 
DHR Health, but for his countless other self-
less acts that benefit the community. Mario 
served as the 2020 Edinburg Census Com-
mittee Chairman and helped ensure South 
Texas had the most accurate count possible. 
He is also the Chairman of the Board for the 
Greater Pharr Chamber of Commerce and the 
Vice President of the Pharr Economic Devel-
opment Corporation. 
In addition to his various leadership roles 
within the community, Mr. Lizcano is a 20-year 
volunteer firefighter veteran, achieving the 
rank of Firefighter of the year, twice, by the 
city of Mission, as well as the Firefighter of the 
Year for the entire Rio Grande Valley. Once, 
he even ran a 5k in full firefighter uniform to 
raise money for charity. 
Mario has contributed and volunteered for 
more than 500 regional and statewide events 
and has accumulated innumerable awards. 
The sheer amount of leadership positions and 
awards Mr. Lizcano has achieved is too many 
to recognize today in my allotted time. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I stand here 
today to acknowledge the countless achieve-
ments of Mario Lizcano. He has dedicated his 
life to the betterment of his community and his 
legacy will no doubt inspire public service and 
volunteerism of future generations. I thank Mr. 
Lizcano and congratulate him.

RECOGNIZING 
PHIL

SERVICE 
TO

INTER-

COUNCIL 5 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to congratulate Phil Lindquist on his re-
tirement from Director of Governmental Affairs 
at the International Union of Painters and Al-
lied Traders (IUPAT), District Council 5. 
Me and my staff had the pleasure of work-
ing with Phil for several years. Rarely have I 
met someone with the expertise, knowledge, 
and passion Phil possesses. He was an ex-
tremely effective advocate for workers’ rights 
and genuinely cared about the work he was 
doing. He recognized the need to have a 
strong, organized union and was an important 
leader in IUPAT, District Council 5. 
For nearly two decades Phil was an incred-
ible Director of Governmental Affairs to the 
union. The impact union leaders have are 
often overlooked, but they are incredibly im-
portant. I know his work-ethic, drive, and dedi-
cation will be missed by all and he has left an 
impressive legacy that will be hard for his suc-
cessor to fill. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Phil Lindquist for 
spending his career advancing the rights of 
workers and congratulate him on a well-de-
served retirement.

HONORING DR. JOE MCDONALD 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 11, 2021 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Dr. Joe McDonald, 
who passed away on November 16, 2019. Joe 
was a man of deep faith, an exceptional 
sportsman on and off the field, and an inspira-
tion to the thousands of students who had the 
great privilege to learn from him. A beloved 
member of our community, Joe’s life was 
marked by steadfast commitment to education 
and service to others. 
Joe grew up in Bakersfield, California and 
was the fourth of seven children. His child-
hood was filled with family and faith; Joe 
played sports and made harmless trouble with 
his brothers, gained a strong work ethic from 
his parents, and worshiped proudly, singing 
alongside his family in their church’s choir. 
After two years at Bakersfield Community 
College, Joe caught the eye of Arizona State 
University Football Head Coach Frank Kush 
who recruited him to play tight end for the 
team. Off the field, he earned his degree and 
met the love of his life, Sharon, before begin-
ning his career as an educator. A few years 
into his teaching career, Coach Kush reached 
out again, this time to ask Joe to be an assist-
ant coach for Sun Devil football—he said yes. 
Throughout Joe’s return to ASU, he coached 
for six years, served as the associate athletic 
director and earned both his master’s and 
doctoral degrees. Joe brought both success 
and diversity to ASU football, leading the Sun 
Devils to the 1970 Peach Bowl and the 1971– 
1973 Fiesta Bowls as one of the first Black 
coaches at a Division One University. 
Following his time at ASU, Joe returned to 
the classroom as a teacher and was later 
named the first principal of Desert Vista High 
School. During his principalship, the school 
was recognized multiple times for its academic 
achievements and excellence in athletics and 
fine arts. Joe always saw the good in every-
one. He constantly advocated for the best in-
terests of his students, teachers, and adminis-
trators because he knew they were the foun-
dation which made Desert Vista a welcoming 
and inclusive learning environment for all. In 
recognition of his more than a decade of serv-
ice to Desert Vista, the school’s auditorium 
was named after him upon his retirement. 
Joe was also active and engaged in our 
community; he was a member of the First In-
stitutional Baptist Church congregation for 52 
years, where he regularly taught Sunday 
School. He served on the Sun Angel Founda-
tion Executive Board and the Memorial Hos-
pital Board. For all of his work in the commu-
nity, Joe was recognized with the Arizona Afri-
can 
American 
Achievement 
Award, 
the 
NAACP Leadership Award, the Tribune Lead-
ership Award, and the Distinguished Adminis-
trator’s Award. 
Joe will be dearly missed by his friends, 
family, colleagues and all whom he empow-
ered during his lifetime of service as an edu-
cator and school administrator. We join his 
family in grief and gratitude, thankful we bore 
witness to his incredible legacy which will be 
felt for generations to come. 
I thank Joe, and wish him Godspeed.
