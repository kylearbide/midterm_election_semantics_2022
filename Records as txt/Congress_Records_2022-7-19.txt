Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JULY 19, 2022 
No. 119 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
July 19, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable SHELIA 
JACKSON LEE to act as Speaker pro tempore 
on this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Loving God, You have called those 
who believe in You to live in commu-
nity, to love and support those in need, 
and to encourage each other in the 
faith. God, at times these seem like 
such easy tasks. All we need do is look 
around us, and we see fellow human 
beings in great want for so many 
things. And yet, we are reluctant to 
act, not knowing where to start, whom 
to help first, or what the right help is 
for us to give. 
Open our eyes to those who are hun-
gry, who need clothes, who thirst for 
the water that will satisfy their deep-
est needs. May we be the hands that 
lead even the stranger to find shelter 
in Your care. 
Likewise, call us to ask how we can 
be of encouragement to one another. 
How do we serve one another that to-
gether we would be stepping stones and 
not stumbling blocks to the peace You 
would have us enjoy? 
Despite our differences, despite our 
disagreements, cause us to look into 
the eyes of the other and see Your 
image, so then may we be at peace. 
God of love and peace, be with us this 
day. In Your holy name we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mr. 
WALBERG) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. WALBERG led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
FUNDAMENTAL REPRODUCTIVE 
RIGHTS 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, it has been more than 3 weeks since 
the Supreme Court ignored the con-
stitutional right to privacy that guar-
anteed women could make their own 
reproductive health decisions. Now, 
States are encouraged to restrict or 
ban abortion and birth control. 
We are now witnessing the horrifying 
consequences of an extreme agenda to 
criminalize 
women’s 
reproductive 
health decisions, including the arrest 
of doctors. 
Americans overwhelmingly support 
protecting 
women’s 
reproductive 
rights, and I stand here today to affirm 
their voices and carry out their will. 
Last week, House Democrats passed 
two strong bills to defend women’s 
right to decide. This week, we will once 
again ensure progress, not regression, 
when we pass the Right to Contracep-
tion Act. 
Far-right 
extremists 
continue 
to 
wage an all-out war to control women’s 
reproductive rights, but we will con-
tinue to put people over politics and 
ensure birth control access for all. 
f 
CONGRATULATING MIKE MCARAN 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to offer my heartfelt con-
gratulations to Superintendent Mike 
McAran as he celebrates his retirement 
and to recognize his many years of 
service. His contributions to the com-
munity are worthy of commendation. 
Throughout his career, Mr. McAran 
served many roles within the education 
system, including as a history and 
English teacher in the Fraser school 
district, assistant principal and ath-
letic 
director 
at 
Tecumseh 
High 
School, and principal of Sand Creek 
Community Schools, as well as a mid-
dle school in Tecumseh. He would even-
tually become the superintendent of 
Tecumseh 
schools 
and 
later 
the 
Morenci Area School District. In total, 
Mike McAran dedicated 56 years of his 
career to education. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in celebrating the retire-
ment of Mike McAran. I am proud to 
honor his work, accomplishments, and 
significant 
community 
impact. 
We 
thank him for his outstanding service 
and wish him all the best in his future 
endeavors.

July 19, 2022 
RECOGNIZING LYNN VALBUENA 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
CORREA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I join the American Lung Asso-
ciation in recognizing an outstanding 
American 
and 
Californian, 
Lynn 
Valbuena, chairwoman of the San 
Manuel Band of Mission Indians. 
On August 25, Chairwoman Valbuena 
will be honored by the American Lung 
Association for her contributions to 
healthcare both to her Tribal nation 
and to other Tribal nations across the 
United States. 
Lynn has devoted her entire life to 
serving her Tribal nation and her com-
munity. In April, she was sworn in as 
chairwoman for the fifth nonconsecu-
tive term. 
I 
extend 
my 
congratulations 
to 
Chairwoman Lynn Valbuena for this 
well-deserved recognition and thank 
her for keeping up the good work.

ENOUGH OF THE JANUARY 6 
WITCH HUNT 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Speaker PELOSI and her sham partisan 
committee are desperately trying to 
distract the American people from all 
the crises their party philosophy has 
caused. 
The American people are not fooled. 
No amount of scripted, teleprompted, 
overproduced political soap opera can 
distract the American people from the 
pain they are feeling at the gas station, 
the grocery store, and the electric out-
lets, or the tightening of their purse 
strings, thanks to the Democrats’ 
wage-killing price hikes. 
It has been 18 months since Wash-
ington fell into Democrat one-party 
rule. Since then, inflation has sky-
rocketed; gas prices are at an all-time 
high; and we are headed into a reces-
sion. 
Why is Speaker PELOSI and her sham 
January 6th Committee still obsessing 
over the former President? 
While President Trump lives rent- 
free in Democrats’ heads, Republicans 
are working on real solutions to help 
the American people. We are trying to 
rein in reckless spending to bring down 
inflation and restart American energy 
dominance. 
Democrats should take notes. The 
polls show the American people want 
these solutions. 
Enough of this nonsense January 6 
witch hunt. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
LEGACY 
OF 
CHIEF 
MASTER 
SERGEANT 
JAMES M. MCCOY 
(Mr. FLOOD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FLOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the legacy of Chief 
Master Sergeant James M. McCoy of 
Omaha. Recognizing his life of service, 
both public and private, the United 
States lost an outstanding leader and, 
certainly, Nebraska lost a friend. 
Born in Creston, Iowa, he entered the 
Air Force at 18 years old in 1951. In 
1979, he was named the sixth chief mas-
ter sergeant of the United States Air 
Force. Whether as an instructor or part 
of a major command, he was an excep-
tional person, eventually being named 
one of the 12 Outstanding Airmen dur-
ing his assignment with the Pacific Air 
Forces. 
My district is home to Offutt Air 
Force Base, a pillar in our U.S. stra-
tegic defense. In 2007, its Airman Lead-
ership School was named for McCoy, 
and in 2016, he was inducted into the 
Strategic Air Command Hall of Fame. 
Just recently, in 2021, the Air Force As-
sociation awarded McCoy its Lifetime 
Achievement Award in the school now 
bearing his name. 
On behalf of the First District of Ne-
braska, I thank him and his family for 
his great service to his community and 
his Nation. 
f 
A WIN FOR U.S. FARMERS 
(Mr. MANN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate a win for American 
farmers, ranchers, and agricultural 
producers. 
Fertilizer 
prices 
have 
been 
sky-
rocketing for over a year now, with the 
cost of urea ammonium nitrate, in par-
ticular, rising to record highs. Since 
March, I have been urging the U.S. 
International Trade Commission to 
suspend duties on UAN imports from 
Trinidad and Tobago, and this week, 
they did just that. 
On July 18, the U.S. International 
Trade Commission rejected imposing 
final duties on urea ammonium ni-
trate, UAN, in its determination that 
antidumping activity surrounding UAN 
fertilizers in Trinidad and Tobago did 
not harm the U.S. fertilizer industry. 
With this determination, the ITC has 
finally responded to my three letters 
dating back to March, the legislation I 
introduced in that same month, and 
my testimony before them in June, all 
urging reconsideration of the initial 
duties. 
I am proud to lead the charge on this 
effort. I will continue to monitor the 
situation, and I look forward to seeing 
the immediate removal of duties on 
UAN imports from Trinidad and To-
bago, which is the most immediate op-
portunity for a near-term, partial rem-
edy to the high cost of fertilizer facing 
U.S. farmers. 
f 
JUSTICE FOR CYPRUS 
(Ms. MALLIOTAKIS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
48 years this week, on July 20, 1974, the 
Turkish military invaded the Republic 
of Cyprus in direct violation of the 
Charter of the United Nations and 
international law. 
To this day, there has been no ac-
countability for the deaths, displace-
ments, and destruction caused by this 
illegal invasion and occupation. 
I 
urge 
the 
President, 
Secretary 
Blinken, and this body to join calls for 
the immediate removal of Turkish 
troops, the return of property to right-
ful owners, and the reunification of Cy-
prus. 
Today Cyprus, Greece, and other na-
tions in the eastern Mediterranean face 
more aggression and continued threats 
from Turkey under President Erdogan, 
who has threatened exclusive economic 
zones, ordered repeated military fly-
overs over the Greek islands, and un-
dermined NATO sanctions on Russia 
and U.S. operations in Syria. 
Despite Turkey’s aggression, Presi-
dent Biden plans to sell U.S. fighter 
jets to Turkey. I thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for supporting 
our amendment last week to prevent 
this sale and our efforts to deliver jus-
tice for Cyprus once and for all. 
f 
SEC’S PROPOSED CLIMATE 
CHANGE RULE 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise today to bring attention to Presi-
dent Biden’s Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s proposed climate change 
rule. 
As Tennesseans suffer from the im-
pacts of record-breaking inflation that 
has driven the cost of almost every-
thing 
through 
the 
roof, 
President 
Biden and his SEC are trying to imple-
ment a regulation that will make it 
harder and more expensive to produce 
the food and fiber that feeds the world. 
We saw just last week that inflation 
is showing no signs of slowing down. 
The climate change rule proposed by 
Biden’s SEC will only make it worse, 
as the farmers and ranchers who work 
so hard to feed us will spend copious 
amounts of time, effort, and money to 
comply with this rule, if it is even pos-
sible. 
Biden’s SEC has clearly overstepped 
its bounds, as Congress has never given 
them the authority to regulate carbon 
emissions. If President Biden were seri-
ous about lower prices, he would imme-
diately hit the brakes on this proposed 
rule.

FIGHTING FOR WOMEN’S

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6711 
July 19, 2022 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of House 
Democrats and their efforts today to 
protect women and their fundamental 
reproductive rights. 
In my home State of Texas, more 
than 50,000 women had an abortion last 
year. These are women who made an 
extremely 
personal 
and 
intimate 
healthcare decision based on what is 
best for them, their families, and their 
future. 
Yet, MAGA Republicans have never 
wanted these women to have these fun-
damental rights, and they aim to strip 
away their freedoms. 
But to all the women and the fami-
lies who may be scared and are listen-
ing across America right now, please 
hear me now: 
House Democrats have your back. We 
trust women. We are fighting for you. 
We always have, and we always will.

forma amendments, and provides one 
motion to recommit. 
Second, the rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 8373 under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of general de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, self-executes a manager’s 
amendment, and provides one motion 
to recommit. 
Third, the rule provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 8404 under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of general de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
and provides for one motion to recom-
mit. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability to 
en bloc requested votes on suspension 
bills this week and deems passage of 
House Resolution 1230. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule pro-
vides for consideration of three impor-
tant bills—one that is part of the reg-
ular process of funding the government 
for the next year, and two that are 
emergency measures to respond to the 
ongoing assault by an extremist right-
wing minority against Americans’ indi-
vidual rights and liberties. 
The first bill is a package of bills 
called the minibus. This package of six 
annual appropriations bills provides 
funding for the Federal Government for 
the next fiscal year for a wide array of 
important government programs: Food 
and farming, transportation, housing, 
conservation and environmental pro-
tection, veterans programs, commu-
nity development, and general oper-
ations of the Federal Government. 
Thanks to the strong leadership of 
House Democrats on the Committee on 
Appropriations, 
today’s 
bill 
makes 
major investments to meet the needs of 
Americans at this difficult point in 
time. When we talk about these huge 
budget bills each year, it can be over-
whelming, so let’s look at some con-
crete examples of how these bills are 
going to benefit our country. 
This budget bill will increase funding 
for veterans’ healthcare by $20 billion, 
helping the VA to meet the health 
needs of our Nation’s veterans. In addi-
tion to funding traditional health serv-
ices for veterans, this bill will expand 
mental healthcare, including suicide 
prevention, 
improve 
women’s 
healthcare, homeless assistance pro-
grams, substance use disorder pro-
grams, and invest in medical research 
to address veterans’ unique health 
needs. 
With the lack of affordable housing 
being one of the major issues impact-
ing our communities across this coun-
try, this bill will increase funding for 
housing by $9 billion and provide 
140,000 more families and seniors with 
stable, affordable housing. It will get 
lead and radon out of public housing 
units and incentivize the construction 
of thousands of new units of affordable 
housing. 
This bill will provide a $7 billion 
boost for the Department of the Inte-
rior and the Environmental Protection 
Agency, which is funding for our na-
tional parks, our land and water con-
servation programs, and for enhanced 
enforcement of our environmental pro-
tection laws so that Americans of all 
ages and backgrounds—and our chil-
dren—can have clean air to breathe and 
water to drink, and enjoy the natural 
wonders that our amazing country has 
to offer. 
This bill provides a $2 billion in-
crease for programs that support public 
health, rural development, and fight 
hunger. Vital funding for SNAP and 
WIC will increase access to healthy 
foods for the 40 million Americans who 
rely upon our Nation’s antihunger pro-
grams, improving their health and low-
ering the cost of living for those in 
need. 
Funding for the FDA under this title 
will improve the safety and avail-
ability 
of 
baby 
formula. 
It 
will 
strengthen oversight of our food and 
drug safety laws and support supply 
chains for critical drugs and medical 
devices. 
Funding for rural development will 
provide grants and low-cost financing 
to expand broadband and fix water in-
frastructure in rural communities, pro-
moting community and economic de-
velopment. 
The bill also provides an additional 
$4 billion in funding for government op-
erations so that our Federal agencies 
can do the work that we all rely upon. 
Among other things, this boost will 
help the IRS improve its processing 
times and provide more taxpayers with 
help when filing. A stronger IRS will 
also be able to better enforce our tax 
laws to make sure that billionaires and 
large corporations pay their fair share. 
This funding will more than triple 
the Election Security Grants program 
which provides funding to the States to 
secure our Federal elections by pur-
chasing new technology and keeping 
ahead of bad actors who try to attack 
our elections. This funding has helped 
to make the U.S. elections so secure 
that anyone who says the 2020 election 
was stolen is either a liar or a fool. 
This funding will encourage eco-
nomic development by funding the 
Small Business Administration’s lend-
ing programs and the Treasury Depart-
ment’s Community Development Fi-
nancial Institutions. Combined, these 
programs are often the main source of 
financing for minority and women- 
owned small businesses, many of which 
are increasingly leading the way in cre-
ating jobs and economic opportunities. 
The minibus also makes major in-
vestments in our servicemembers by 
increasing funding for housing and 
childcare on military installations. 
b 1030 
This 
funding 
will 
provide 
more 
childcare services for the 1.2 million 
children of Active-Duty servicemem-
bers, as well as the ability to construct 
and 
remediate 
thousands 
of 
sub-
standard units of military family hous-
ing. 
Finally, this year’s appropriations 
bills build on last year’s successes with 
community project funding, which al-
lows Members of Congress to better 
represent their districts and exercise 
Congress’ responsibility to direct Fed-
eral spending, rather than delegating 
it. 
Community project funding allows 
Members to support smart, high-im-
pact investments in their districts in a 
way that is transparent and ethically 
sound. I thank the Appropriations 
Committee for their work to respon-
sibly reinstate this opportunity. 
Because of these rule changes, I have 
been able to bring millions of dollars 
back to my district for a variety of lo-
cally backed efforts ranging from men-
tal health programs to community cen-
ters to workforce development. This 
year, I am proud to have secured fund-
ing for 15 projects totaling $20 million 
for Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional 
District. 
Madam Speaker, obviously, I could 
keep going on about the amazing 
things that this bill will do, but all to-
gether the minibus is a strong invest-
ment in our country that will help 
working families, small businesses, and 
local communities, as well as helping 
to fight inflation, create jobs, and sup-
port economic development. 
Funding the government is Congress’ 
primary responsibility. It is right there 
in the beginning lines of Article I, Sec-
tion 8 of the Constitution, that Con-
gress has the power to provide for the 
common defense and general welfare of 
the United States. 
With the consideration of these six 
appropriations bills this week, and the 
other six later this month, House 
Democrats are meeting their responsi-
bility to the American people by pass-
ing a budget on time. 
I say House Democrats because I am 
concerned that my Republican col-
leagues may follow their recent prac-
tice of refusing to work in a bipartisan 
manner to fund the government or to 
solve problems for the American peo-
ple, and then voting against this bill 
when it comes to the floor. 
Of course, over in the 50–50 Senate, 
where 10 Republican votes are needed 
to pass a budget bill, the Senators have 
not even begun consideration of any 
appropriations packages. Just like last 
year, House Democrats are passing 
funding bills on time while Repub-
licans in the Senate are holding up the 
process for months by slow-walking ne-
gotiations and refusing to compromise. 
Last year, this obstructive behavior 
by Senate Republicans meant that 
Congress didn’t pass its 2022 budget 
until we were halfway through that 
year. That meant by the time the Fed-
eral Government received its 2022 fund-
ing, it only had 6 months left to use it. 
That is irresponsible. That is not good 
business, and it is not sound govern-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6713 
July 19, 2022 
At every turn, the filibuster and 
stonewalling by Republican Senators 
squash every single legislative initia-
tive that comes their way. 
Madam Speaker, this rule also brings 
two other critically important bills to 
the floor. Today’s rule also provides for 
consideration of the Right to Contra-
ception Act, a bill that would codify 
fundamental privacy rights relating to 
purchasing, using, and providing con-
traception; and the Respect for Mar-
riage Act, which would codify the right 
to same-sex marriage in Federal law. 
These are two basic freedoms that 
the overwhelming majority of Ameri-
cans support, and that most Americans 
are surprised to learn are now under 
threat from an extremist rightwing mi-
nority in our Supreme Court and many 
Republican State legislatures across 
the country. 
In the wake of the Dobbs decision, we 
immediately saw a number of States 
implement or try to pass abortion 
bans. The practical and tragic con-
sequences of those decisions are grow-
ing every day with women and girls un-
able to get the healthcare they need, 
whether it is a 10-year-old rape victim 
in Ohio being denied medical care in 
her home State or a women with an ec-
topic pregnancy in Missouri whose 
healthcare providers are withholding 
what is standard medical care because 
they fear prosecution under these laws. 
These tragic stories will continue, 
and they will get worse. This is the 
world we live in in the aftermath of the 
extremist Dobbs decision. But the im-
pact of the Dobbs decision does not end 
with abortion care. The extremist 
rightwing majority on the Supreme 
Court has put our country down a per-
ilous path. They have shown us the 
harsh reality of judicial review—no ob-
jectivity, no textualism or originalism, 
this is just politics by other means. 
The majority in Dobbs and others 
who hold this minority view are push-
ing a rightwing agenda that can be 
summed up as this: for all their talk 
about States’ rights and individual 
freedoms, the rightwing majority is 
going to uphold the rights they support 
and take away the rights they oppose. 
The two bills we consider today re-
spond to the immediate threat articu-
lated by Justice Thomas in his concur-
rence in the Dobbs decision—that he 
wants to overturn decisions that pro-
tect rights to contraception, same-sex 
marriage, et cetera. It is not just Jus-
tice Thomas, Justice Alito has joined 
him in similar concurrences; and, of 
course, he wrote the majority decision 
in Dobbs. 
Rightwing legislators and Members 
of Congress are saying exactly what 
they want to do and introducing bills 
to do exactly this—to undermine the 
right to contraception and to under-
mine the right to same-sex marriage. 
These are not hypotheticals but very 
real threats. 
In response to this insanity, the 
House must vote this week on the 
Right to Contraception Act and the Re-
spect for Marriage Act. The Right to 
Contraception 
Act 
would 
prohibit 
States from banning or restricting pos-
session, sale, purchase, transportation, 
use, prescription of contraception, in-
cluding birth control, IUDs, condoms, 
and other products that aid in family 
planning. 
The Respect for Marriage Act will 
codify the current law of the land and 
protect the thousands of same-sex mar-
riages and families across this country, 
who are now justifiably afraid that 
their families are under attack. I can’t 
tell you how many constituents, col-
leagues, friends, and their children 
that I am hearing from in the wake of 
this decision and in the wake of Justice 
Thomas’ explicit threat. 
Both of these bills will protect rights 
enjoyed by Americans that are now 
being threatened by the Supreme Court 
minority view and their co-conspira-
tors in the Republican Party. I am glad 
we are bringing these bills up for a vote 
so we can see who is going to vote for 
them and who is going to vote against 
them. 
I am confident that House Democrats 
will provide the votes necessary to pass 
the bills. It is time for our colleagues 
across the aisle to stand up and be 
counted. Will they vote to protect 
these fundamental freedoms, or will 
they vote to let States take those free-
doms away? 
Today we will find out. Then we will 
see what our colleagues in the Senate 
will do. We are going to put these bills 
up for a vote, and the public can see, on 
the record, how their Representatives 
and Senators respond. At least every-
one will know where their elected offi-
cials stand. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the distinguished gen-
tlewoman from my home State of 
Pennsylvania for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today makes in order three pieces of 
legislation, including H.R. 8294, a bill 
to fund 6 of the 12 appropriations bills. 
As a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, I want to just say I am ex-
tremely grateful to Ranking Member 
GRANGER
and Chairwoman DELAURO 
for all the hard work that they put in, 
and also the committee staff. I know a 
lot of effort went into this legislation. 
Unfortunately, the product before us 
was flawed from the very start. House 
Democrats drastically underfunded our 
national defense while providing major 
increases to the same social programs 
that have already received trillions of 
dollars in funding under the Biden ad-
ministration. 
It is clear that the Democrats’ out- 
of-control spending has been the key 
driver to inflation. Don’t take my word 
for it. Larry Summers, former eco-
nomic adviser to President Biden, went 
so far as to call the American Rescue 
Plan ‘‘the least responsible macro-
economic policy we’ve had in the last 
40 years.’’ Again, that was Larry Sum-
mers, Democrat adviser to the Presi-
dent. 
You know what? He was right. Last 
month, inflation hit 9.1 percent. That 
is the highest inflation rate in my life-
time. It is the highest inflation rate 
since 1981. 
President Biden’s inflation crisis has 
cost the American worker over $3,000 in 
annual income, and the skyrocketing 
cost of goods and services will cost the 
average American family over $6,000. 
That is what is so nefarious about in-
flation, it hits the working class and 
those on a fixed income the hardest. 
Yet, the Big Government Democrats 
with their reckless spending policies 
have these six bills before us today in-
cluded in the package. The six bills in-
cluded in today’s package received a 
total increase of 11 percent over the 
previous fiscal year with some ac-
counts, like the Federal Trade Com-
mission and the Office of Personnel 
Management, 
receiving 
double-digit 
and triple-digit percentage increases, 
which will, of course, fuel additional 
inflation. 
Keep in mind, the Defense appropria-
tions bill approved by the Appropria-
tions Committee had just a 4.4 percent 
increase. Additionally, instead of ad-
dressing record-high gas prices, Demo-
crats are pushing this partisan Green 
New Deal initiative that will only 
worsen Biden’s energy crisis. 
Under this measure, offshore oil and 
gas activities are restricted and oil and 
gas inspection fees are increased. This 
is just going to drive up the cost of en-
ergy for working families. 
H.R. 8294 also includes numerous far- 
left, radical, liberal policies like allow-
ing taxpayer dollars to fund abortions, 
and keeping our critical and strategic 
minerals in the ground. Alarmingly, it 
includes provisions that threaten our 
national security, including allowing 
for the closure of Guantanamo Bay, 
which houses some of the world’s most 
dangerous terrorists. It also fails to 
modernize the nuclear weapons stock-
pile and complex, and provides incen-
tives for illegal immigration. 
Further, the rule before us today pro-
vides for consideration of H.R. 8373, 
which goes far beyond supporting ac-
cess to contraception. Let me just be 
clear about this point. Not a single 
State in the Union, not a single general 
assembly in any State is debating con-
sidering making contraception illegal. 
This poorly drafted bill has extreme 
provisions that could harm the health 
of women, send taxpayer dollars to 
Planned Parenthood and other abor-
tion providers, and force people to vio-
late their religious and sincerely held 
beliefs. 
Madam Speaker, I, therefore, urge 
my colleagues to oppose this rule, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. 
SCANLON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
these appropriations bills are not going 
to make inflation worse. It is a bad- 
faith argument. Inflation is bad. It is

eating away at family paychecks not 
just here in America but all across the 
globe. 
My colleague cited the recent infla-
tion figures here in the U.S.—they are 
worse overseas. The economic shocks 
in supply chain disruptions caused by 
the pandemic and then exacerbated by 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are hit-
ting hard—yes, here at home and all 
across the world. There are things that 
we are doing to bring those prices 
down, and economic indicators show 
that prices are starting to come down. 
It doesn’t deny the real pain that we 
are all feeling right now. 
Second, which spending would he 
have eliminated? Would it have been 
the funding to develop vaccines and 
therapeutics? Maybe the funding to 
keep people in their homes during the 
pandemic? Would it be the funding that 
supported small businesses over the 
last several years, or maybe it is just 
the paycheck protection funding? 
I think it is a hollow argument, and 
I think it is also worth noting that we 
are not seeing any alternative solu-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. ROSS), a distinguished member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the urgent need to 
protect access to contraception. 
Just a few weeks ago, the Supreme 
Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization stripped 
millions of women of the right to abor-
tion care. After this decision, draco-
nian abortion bans in States across the 
country immediately went into effect. 
In my own State of North Carolina, 
Republican leaders have made it abun-
dantly clear that they will take any 
opportunity to restrict our rights. Per-
haps even more sinister than this deci-
sion are the opinions that accompanied 
it. 
Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring 
opinion laid the groundwork for even 
greater government interference in the 
personal and family decisions of our 
people, including the right to use con-
traception. 
Make 
no 
mistake, 
the 
American people will not go backward 
on contraception. 
We must codify Griswold v. Con-
necticut, which has protected women’s 
right to make decisions about their 
own contraceptive healthcare for dec-
ades. 
This week, we are considering the 
Right to Contraception Act. This crit-
ical legislation will safeguard contra-
ception and its access in the face of 
these 
extreme 
attacks. 
Americans 
overwhelmingly support the right to 
contraception. 
Madam Speaker, I hope to hear from 
my colleagues across the aisle about 
how they could do anything other than 
support expanding contraception in the 
wake of the Dobbs decision. 
If my colleagues want to prevent 
abortions, why would they restrict re-
sources to women who want to avoid 
unintended pregnancies? 
Madam Speaker, I fought to expand 
access to contraception in North Caro-
lina with support from legislators on 
both sides of the aisle. Twenty years 
later it is extremely disappointing that 
we could be going backward. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina. 
b 1045 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, women 
across the country are more deter-
mined than ever to combat these re-
lentless attacks on our freedom. I sup-
port the rule and the underlying bills. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, my friend and col-
league from Pennsylvania asked me 
which programs I would cut funding 
from as if this were some kind of 
checkmate in floor debate. It is not be-
cause the answer is very obvious. I 
have an extensive list of where I would 
cut. 
Just for starters, let’s look at some 
of the increases in the appropriations 
package and, of course, where I would 
cut. 
We have a 20 percent increase for the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency. 
That could be cut. 
We have a $1 billion increase for the 
Internal Revenue Service. That could 
be cut right there. 
There is a 30 percent increase for the 
Federal Trade Commission. That could 
be cut. Don’t take my word for it. Not 
one but two of the Commissioners of 
the FTC said that they don’t even need 
this increase. There is money that you 
could cut right there, Madam Speaker. 
There is a 12 percent increase to 
maintain and improve Federal build-
ings. I don’t know if anybody across 
the aisle has been paying attention, 
but most of the people in these Federal 
buildings have been working remotely 
from home for the last 2 years. Yet, we 
need to increase funding to Federal 
buildings that are literally sitting 
empty as people work from home? 
Then, we have a lot of bad ideas re-
garding climate. $100 million is pro-
vided for the President’s proposal to 
use the Defense Production Act au-
thorities to accelerate domestic manu-
facturing of select clean energy tech-
nologies. That can be cut. 
While we are talking about the shift 
to clean energy technologies, let’s just 
be honest about who benefits from this. 
It is China because they are the ones 
who are selling the rare earth elements 
that are going into things like solar 
panels. By the way, they are bringing 
more nuclear power plants online and 
more coal-fired plants online while we 
hamstring our economy and our energy 
sector 
with 
these 
absurd 
climate 
change proposals. 
I have more, actually, but for the 
sake of time and brevity, I will save 
them for later if the issue comes up. 
Additionally, this notion that infla-
tion is a worldwide issue, I am not sure 
when they stopped teaching economics 
in school, but we are the world’s larg-
est GDP. If we have inflation, then the 
world has inflation because we literally 
export it. That is just how economics 
works. 
To blame Ukraine, Ukraine might 
play a part in this, but who is to blame 
for Ukraine? It is President Biden. It 
was the weakness and vacillation—his 
surrender 
in 
Afghanistan—that 
emboldened Putin. It was the vacilla-
tion. It was the ‘‘minor incursion’’ 
comment that he had that gave Vladi-
mir Putin the green light to invade. 
Had he just been more resolute in our 
national security, then we could have 
deterred this invasion. So, he owns 
Ukraine, as well. 
The gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina brought up Dobbs. I want to quote 
the actual decision because I think a 
lot of the points in Dobbs were taken 
out of context. The Court made it clear 
in that decision that the decision on 
abortion should ‘‘not be misunderstood 
or mischaracterized . . . to cast doubt 
on precedents that do not concern 
abortion.’’ 
The Court went out of its way to 
state that they are not concerned 
about contraception, despite the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina saying 
otherwise. 
But let’s go back to Dobbs. Since the 
point of the leak of the Dobbs draft Su-
preme Court decision, there have been 
70 violent attacks and threats on 
churches, pregnancy centers, and pro- 
life organizations. 
These attacks consist of vandalism. 
They consist of destruction of prop-
erty, arson, and even included pro-
testers breaching the Arizona State 
Capitol, forcing legislators to evac-
uate. 
Radical pro-abortion groups have 
proudly declared ‘‘open season’’ on pro- 
life pregnancy centers while these or-
ganizations are providing critical re-
sources to pregnant women, infants, 
and families. 
Republicans want to protect public 
safety. We want to ensure pro-life orga-
nizations can continue helping women 
and babies in need. That is why if we 
defeat the previous question, I will per-
sonally offer an amendment to the rule 
to immediately consider H. Res. 1233, a 
resolution affirming the importance of 
pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, con-
demning the violent attacks by far-left 
extremist groups, and calling upon the 
Biden administration to use all law en-
forcement authorities to uphold public 
safety and protect the rights of pro-life 
facilities, groups, and churches. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6715 
July 19, 2022 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON). 
The vice chairman of the Republican 
Conference and sponsor of the resolu-
tion is here to explain the amendment. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful for the oppor-
tunity. I thank the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania for handling the rule and 
highlighting this very important issue. 
As he said, if the previous question is 
defeated, then Republicans will amend 
the rule to immediately consider H. 
Res. 1233. That is the resolution that 
condemns the spate of attacks that 
have recently occurred against pro-life 
facilities, groups, and churches in the 
wake of the Dobbs opinion. 
Madam Speaker, these acts are rep-
rehensible, but we shouldn’t be sur-
prised they are occurring all across the 
country. They have gone unchecked for 
far too long, ever since the draft Dobbs 
opinion was inexcusably leaked to the 
public in that unprecedented act. 
Republicans immediately condemned 
that leak as a threat to the institution 
of the Court itself, as a threat to the 
Justices themselves as individuals, and 
as a threat to our very Republic. The 
Democrat leadership of this body did 
nothing. 
Weeks went by as tensions grew. Pro-
testers harassed sitting Supreme Court 
Justices, a clear violation of the black- 
letter Federal Law. Republicans filed a 
resolution condemning those acts. The 
Democrat leadership of this body did 
nothing even as threats continued to 
pour in against the Justices and their 
families. 
The Senate acted. They unanimously 
passed legislation to extend security to 
the families of the Justices. I and 
many of my colleagues repeatedly 
called upon the Speaker of this House 
to bring this resolution to the floor so 
we could pass it here and send it to the 
President’s desk. But do you know 
what we got, Madam Speaker? Noth-
ing. 
It was only when an attempt was ac-
tually made on the life of Justice 
Kavanaugh that the Speaker finally 
gave in. She finally brought that legis-
lation to the floor so that we could 
push back against the angry mobs. 
Madam Speaker, the leadership of 
this body has another opportunity be-
fore them today to, once again, push 
back against the mob. This has gotten 
out of hand. 
Radical leftists were emboldened by 
the inaction of this body and the after-
math of a leaked opinion, and now they 
have targeted their violence against 
the very groups that care for women 
and their unborn children in their most 
vulnerable moments. It is unconscion-
able. 
Here is a short list of some examples. 
May 3, 2022: Individuals vandalized 
the Care Net Pregnancy Center in 
Frederick, Maryland, with pro-abortion 
graffiti, including the messages ‘‘not 
real clinic,’’ ‘‘end forced motherhood,’’ 
and go to Planned Parenthood instead. 
May 5, 2022: Portland, Oregon, van-
dals smashed numerous windows and 
spray-painted graffiti on the Southeast 
Portland Pregnancy Resource Center. 
May 7, 2022: Activists vandalized a 
crisis pregnancy center in Denton, 
Texas, with the radical pro-abortion 
messages ‘‘not a clinic’’ and ‘‘forced 
birth is murder.’’ 
May 7, 2022: In Fort Collins, Colo-
rado, activists painted ‘‘my body, my 
choice’’ on the doors of a Catholic par-
ish. 
May 8, 2022, Mother’s Day: Individ-
uals attempted to break into the Or-
egon Right to Life office in Keizer, Or-
egon, reportedly igniting and throwing 
two Molotov cocktails at the building. 
May 8, 2022: Vandals spray-painted 
pro-abortion messages such as ‘‘abor-
tion is a right,’’ ‘‘fake clinic,’’ and 
‘‘liars’’ on the side of a pro-life preg-
nancy center in Manassas, Virginia. 
May 8, 2022: A pro-life nonprofit cen-
ter in Madison, Wisconsin, was set 
ablaze and vandalized with the words 
‘‘if abortions aren’t safe, then you 
aren’t either.’’ 
May 13, 2022: Activists left threat-
ening messages on the front of the 
Alpha 
Pregnancy 
Center 
in 
Reisterstown, Maryland, including the 
messages ‘‘if abortions aren’t safe, nei-
ther are you,’’ ‘‘you’re anti-choice, not 
pro-life,’’ et cetera. 
May 18, 2022: Vandals targeted a 
women’s faith-based medical clinic in 
Auburn, Alabama, defacing the clinic’s 
sign and staff members’ vehicles. 
May 25, 2022: In Lynnwood, Wash-
ington, anti-life activists smashed win-
dows and vandalized the Next Step 
Pregnancy Center with the threat: ‘‘If 
abortion isn’t safe, you aren’t either.’’ 
June 2, 2022: Jane’s Revenge claimed 
credit for an attack in which its mem-
bers broke windows and scrawled mes-
sages, including ‘‘God loves abortion’’ 
and ‘‘fake clinic,’’ at Agape Pregnancy 
Resource Center in Des Moines, Iowa. 
June 3, 2022: Capitol Hill Crisis Preg-
nancy Center here in Washington, D.C., 
was the target of leftwing abortion ex-
tremists who threw red paint on the 
door, threw eggs at the window, and 
spray-painted the window with ‘‘Jane 
Says Revenge.’’ 
I have pages and pages of these. I 
don’t think I need to belabor the point. 
It is every day now. It is out of control. 
I am going to tell you, Madam 
Speaker, that this last one, July 11, on 
the list here, activists vandalized the 
Women’s New Life Clinic in Baton 
Rouge, Louisiana, by spray-painting 
anti-life messages and ‘‘Jane’s Re-
venge’’ on the exterior walls. 
That last one is personal to me. The 
Women’s New Life Clinic stands right 
next to the abortion provider in Baton 
Rouge and has offered hope to count-
less women over the years. Women’s 
New Life Clinic is doing extraordinary 
work. I am proud to call many of the 
leaders of that clinic personal friends. 
They do not deserve the treatment 
that they have endured, but they cer-
tainly deserve the support of the House 
of Representatives in condemning vio-
lence from the radical left. 
America’s pregnancy care centers 
provide absolutely essential services in 
all 50 States. There are 2,700 of these 
pregnancy centers. They serve millions 
of women every year. They are sup-
ported by over 10,000 medical profes-
sionals. I used to serve as legal counsel 
to a number of these groups, so I am 
telling you this from personal experi-
ence. 
Madam Speaker, I can go on all day 
with these examples. I will spare you. I 
would assume that you recognize the 
obvious. 
When will this body stand up against 
the mob? When will we restore law and 
order? 
CHUCK SCHUMER stood on the steps of 
the Supreme Court itself and infa-
mously called out Justices Kavanaugh 
and Gorsuch by name and said that we 
would release the whirlwind. Well, here 
it is. This shouldn’t surprise us. 
Madam Speaker, our side is ready to 
act. We are ready to do something. We 
have an obligation and responsibility 
to do it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am so happy that 
my colleagues are rising to condemn 
political violence, but I find it dis-
ingenuous and maybe even a little one- 
sided when they only condemn political 
violence that they disagree with. 
This previous question condemns vio-
lence, as my colleague just said, by the 
radical left but not the radical right. 
They are conveniently ignoring dec-
ades of violence, harassment, and even 
murder of abortion care providers and 
harassment of those seeking such care 
on a daily and weekly basis. 
Why are they surprised by this polit-
ical violence on this topic when this is 
a model that the anti-abortion forces 
have utilized for decades? 
Also, on a more practical note, I am 
stunned that my colleague is seeking 
to reduce funding for the IRS. Any re-
sponsible Member of Congress who 
prioritizes constituent services knows 
that we receive hundreds and hundreds 
of calls every year, particularly in re-
cent years, from people who are strug-
gling to get a response from the IRS, 
who are struggling to get their much- 
needed tax refund, and who are strug-
gling to get payments or straighten 
out difficulties. Why is that? It is be-
cause the IRS has been underfunded for 
decades. 
The IRS is facing a crisis with retire-
ments and with the inability to attract 
talent given the tight labor market. 
We need to fund the IRS again so that 
billionaires and large corporations pay 
their fair share. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GAR-
CIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, it has been interesting to listen to

the debate. I feel like it is a rerun of 
the Judiciary Committee, which we all 
serve on. 
I think we should tell the folks 
across the aisle to just spare us the in-
dignation over this political violence 
because, as the manager so aptly char-
acterized, they wrote the book on it. I 
can think of at least one doctor who 
was murdered and, I think, many oth-
ers injured by bombings and harass-
ment. It is just beyond the pale what 
has happened to abortion providers in 
the last decade. 
I want to get back to appropriations 
because, Madam Speaker, that is really 
what I came to talk about. 
The FY23 appropriations minibus bill 
is something that I support. I am real-
ly pleased that many of the projects 
that were included in my request will 
come to fruition. 
One of the six projects included in 
the bill is $4 million for the Target 
Hunger Campus and Education Center, 
which will focus on hunger prevention 
and nutrition education for my con-
stituents. 
Also included is $3 million for afford-
able housing construction projects in 
my district for Avenue Community De-
velopment, which, of course, will help 
us resolve some of the homelessness 
issues. 
This bill also includes a request for 
almost $3 million for enhancements to 
the University of Houston’s Tech-
nology Bridge. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 
seconds. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, those are just three of the 15 
projects that were funded. I think that 
when they talk about cutting and in-
flation, is this what they want to do, to 
stop a hunger project in my district? 
Do they want to stop making sure our 
kids get a good education? Just what is 
it they are doing? 
Finally, Madam Speaker, just quick-
ly, I also support, of course, the bill to 
protect a woman’s right to birth con-
trol and the right of same-sex couples 
to marriage. So, Madam Speaker, there 
are so many reasons to support this 
rule and the underlying bills. 
b 1100 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
There was an—I don’t know if you 
want to call it an allegation—an in-
sinuation that the only time I speak to 
condemn violence is when it is violence 
that I don’t agree with. 
I want to be clear about something. I 
condemn all acts of political violence. I 
have been very consistent on that; so 
have my colleagues across the aisle. 
Great example: The first time I ever 
spoke here on the House floor was in 
support of a resolution rejecting white 
supremacy, and I talked at length at 
that time of the Tree of Life synagogue 
shooting that occurred in Squirrel Hill, 
Pennsylvania. 
As you know, I am from the South 
Hills of Pittsburgh. I have a lot of 
friends that actually attend that syna-
gogue. And again, the first time I 
spoke on the House floor was to con-
demn violence. 
So I just want the RECORD to reflect 
my consistency on this issue and the 
consistency of my colleagues. 
I wish my friends on the left would 
condemn violence that the left has 
done. It seems that they cherry-pick 
their own outrage. 
But let’s just get back to economics. 
Again, there was this notion floated 
that inflation is not as bad here as it is 
internationally, and this is a global 
problem. Again, it is a global problem 
because we are the world’s largest 
GDP. We are exporting inflation. 
But even with that said, inflation is 
far worse here than it is in the devel-
oped world. Our inflation, by reference, 
is 9.1 percent. Japan is at 2.4 percent. 
The U.K. is at 9.1 percent; they are the 
same as we are. Italy is at 8 percent; 
Canada, 7.7 percent; France, 5.8 per-
cent. 
Again, all those countries I listed, 
those nations in the developed world 
have inflation that is lower than where 
we are, with the exception of the U.K., 
which is the same. In Brazil—I should 
say this about Brazil. It is at 11.9 per-
cent in Brazil. 
So this idea that everybody is experi-
encing inflation, and that we have it 
easier, is just not accurate when you 
look at the numbers. 
Now, I gave a list of what I would cut 
from the budget. It wasn’t an exhaus-
tive list, and neither is this, but I just 
want to give a few more examples. 
$75 million is allocated for public 
housing, energy efficiency and climate 
resilience upgrades. That could be cut. 
There is 75 million right there. 
Funding for the FDA—and let’s not 
forget, the FDA was the agency that 
failed to prevent the infant formula 
crisis. The Democrats are rewarding 
the FDA with a 10 percent increase. 
That can be cut. 
And what is so insulting about a 10 
percent increase to the FDA is, at the 
same time Democrats want to increase 
the funding to the FDA—again, the 
agency that led to the baby formula 
shortage—you have farmers and ranch-
ers that are struggling to make ends 
meet and to actually harvest food be-
cause of the rising food costs and fer-
tilizer costs, and there is no increase to 
them. 
And I think one of the most out-
rageous items that can be cut is the $90 
million that is going to The Presidio 
park, a park that is in an incredibly af-
fluent area of San Francisco, arguably, 
one of the wealthiest areas in the en-
tire United States. Yet, that park is 
getting $90 million, when those around 
that park can fund it. 
And again, what is so insulting about 
this is we are not even giving alloca-
tions to places like Yellowstone and 
Yosemite that are actually national 
parks. So those are just some of the 
areas I would cut. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me rise in support of and with re-
buttal to my good friend, my other 
good friend from Pennsylvania. 
It is well-known that the appropria-
tions process is an investment in 
America, and so I rise to support the 
appropriations that will be presented 
to us in this rule T-HUD, Agriculture, 
Energy and Water, Financial Services, 
Interior, Military Construction, and 
Veterans. 
I ask the question: Is anyone going to 
suggest that our military personnel do 
not need better housing, better schools, 
better facilities, and bases, both in the 
United States and across the world? 
And so, investment in the American 
people I will never run away from, and 
I hope the Senate does not, as well. 
And on the question of inflation, I 
want to remind my good friend from 
Pennsylvania, my other good friend, 
that the prices of gas at the pump are 
going down, because inflation is not 
pertaining to one administration; it is 
continuing. And the past administra-
tion dug the hole of the inflation that 
we are now in today. 
I also want to make sure that every 
aspect of reproductive freedom is pro-
tected, and the contraceptive legisla-
tion should be strongly supported be-
cause people are running for their 
lives. Women are running for their 
lives because they do not have the lack 
of fear that they could be arrested; 
that they could be stopped; or a doctor 
could say: I am sorry, I cannot help 
you in your desperate time of need. 
This rule is very important, and I 
support the underlying bills. 
And finally, let me—as I was here, as 
we debated this concept of whether or 
not you are free in your private rights 
to make a decision of who you love, I 
support H.R. 8404 the rule provides for 
this because it says the ‘‘full faith and 
credit given to marriage equality.’’ 
I want the LGBTQ community in 
Houston to hear me, the caucus to hear 
me, we are hearing your voices as well. 
And I want you to know that this bill 
includes, for the purpose of Federal 
law, rule, or regulation in which mar-
ital status is a factor, an individual 
shall be considered married if that in-
dividual’s marriage is valid in the 
State where the marriage was entered 
into or, in the case of a marriage en-
tered into outside any State, if the 
marriage is valid in the place where en-
tered into and the marriage could have 
been entered into, it is safe. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
GARCIA of Texas). The time of the gen-
tlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
know we are running short on time, 
but I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentlewoman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6717 
July 19, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I believe this law 
is key to rejecting the interpretation 
of Justice Clarence Thomas, who indi-
cated, or speculated, that other provi-
sions or rights under privacy may be in 
jeopardy. 
We should not jeopardize someone’s 
right to love who they want to love, 
interracial marriages, marriages of any 
kind. And I support the Respect for 
Marriage Act and the underlying rule. 
I thank the gentlewoman for her gra-
ciousness. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers at 
this time, and I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Since Democrats jammed through 
their $1.9 trillion stimulus bill last 
year, inflation is at an over 40-year 
high; the value of American paychecks 
has also fallen; and families are paying 
more for just about everything. 
Yet, the rule before us makes in 
order a funding package that provides 
double-digit and triple-digit increases 
for nondefense programs that will fur-
ther fuel Biden’s inflation crisis. 
And by the way, while this bill is pro-
viding double-digit and triple-digit in-
creases for nondefense programs, the 
defense budget has only increased 4.4 
percent. That is appalling. 
H.R. 8294 also is packed with far-left 
liberal wish list items like taxpayer- 
funded abortion, rather than policies 
that will address Biden’s economic cri-
sis and fix our supply chains, secure 
our border, and invest in national secu-
rity, and bring down gas and elec-
tricity costs through domestic energy 
production. 
Clearly, the Democrats’ spending and 
policy priorities are out of touch with 
everyday Americans. And that is just 
not me saying that. According to a 
poll, a shocking 75 percent of Ameri-
cans are experiencing hardship because 
of Joe Biden and House Democrats’ in-
flation crisis. And the majority of 
Americans expect the economy to get 
worse this year. 
This bill, like the Democratic Party, 
is tone-deaf and out of touch. 
I, therefore, urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and 
‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Today’s rule is a testament to the 
hard work and leadership of the Appro-
priations Committee led by Chair-
woman DELAURO. I applaud the efforts 
of my colleagues on the Appropriations 
Committee and their staff to prepare 
legislation that meets the needs of ev-
eryday Americans; to grow our econ-
omy from the bottom up and the mid-
dle out, rather than relying, once 
again, on the failed trickle-down eco-
nomics of the last 50 years. 
Given the draconian consequences of 
failing to pass a budget, I encourage 
my colleagues in the House and Senate 
to move quickly in negotiating a final 
budget bill so we can fund the govern-
ment on time. It is the responsible 
thing to do. 
We cannot afford to govern from CR 
to CR, or to pass a budget bill halfway 
through the fiscal year. 
And I am also incredibly grateful to 
my colleagues on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee and the Judiciary 
Committee for stepping up to present 
legislation 
to 
protect 
fundamental 
American freedoms that have been 
placed at risk by the rightwing major-
ity of the Supreme Court in over-
turning Roe v. Wade. 
I urge all of my colleagues to protect 
the right to contraception with the act 
of that name, and to repeal the statu-
tory ban on same-sex marriage by ap-
proving the Respect for Marriage Act 
in its floor consideration. 
At a time when Americans’ rights are 
under attack by a well-funded, extrem-
ist minority which has seized control 
of the Supreme Court and some State 
legislatures, it is more important than 
ever for elected Members of Congress 
to use their legislative powers to pro-
tect and expand Americans’ personal 
and fundamental freedoms. 
So, Madam Speaker, I urge all of my 
colleagues to vote for the rule and the 
underlying legislation. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1232 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the resolution 
(H. Res. 1233) expressing the sense of the 
House of Representatives condemning the re-
cent attacks on prolife facilities, groups, and 
churches. The resolution shall be considered 
as read. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the resolution and pre-
amble to adoption without intervening mo-
tion or demand for division of the question 
except one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of House Resolu-
tion 1233. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The question is on or-
dering the previous question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the 
Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the min-
imum time for any electronic vote on 
the question of adoption of the resolu-
tion. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays 
199, not voting 12, as follows:

RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 1232, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 8404) to repeal the Defense of 
Marriage Act and ensure respect for 
State regulation of marriage, and for 
other purposes, and ask for its imme-
diate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TORRES
of New York). Pursuant to

sidered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8404 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

color of State law may deny— 
‘‘(1) full faith and credit to any public act, 
record, or judicial proceeding of any other 
State pertaining to a marriage between 2 in-
dividuals, on the basis of the sex, race, eth-
nicity, or national origin of those individ-
uals; or 
‘‘(2) a right or claim arising from such a

nicity, or national origin of those individ-
uals. 
‘‘(b) ENFORCEMENT

‘‘(d) STATE DEFINED.—In this section, the 
term ‘State’ has the meaning given such 
term under section 7 of title 1.’’. 
SEC. 4. MARRIAGE RECOGNITION. 
Section 7 of title 1, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows: 
‘‘§ 7. Marriage 
‘‘(a) For the purposes of any Federal law, 
rule, or regulation in which marital status is 
a factor, an individual shall be considered 
married if that individual’s marriage is valid 
in the State where the marriage was entered 
into or, in the case of a marriage entered 
into outside any State, if the marriage is 
valid in the place where entered into and the 
marriage could have been entered into in a 
State. 
‘‘(b) In this section, the term ‘State’ means 
a State, the District of Columbia, the Com-
monwealth of Puerto Rico, or any other ter-
ritory or possession of the United States. 
‘‘(c) For purposes of subsection (a), in de-
termining whether a marriage is valid in a 
State or the place where entered into, if out-
side of any State, only the law of the juris-
diction applicable at the time the marriage 
was entered into may be considered.’’. 
SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY. 
If any provision of this Act, or any amend-
ment made by this Act, or the application of 
such provision to any person, entity, govern-
ment, or circumstance, is held to be uncon-
stitutional, the remainder of this Act, or any 
amendment made thereby, or the application 
of such provision to all other persons, enti-
ties, governments, or circumstances, shall 
not be affected thereby. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary or their re-
spective designees. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and insert 
extraneous material on H.R. 8404. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8404 the Respect 
for Marriage Act would reaffirm that 
marriage equality is, and must remain, 
the law of the land. 
Over the past several decades, mil-
lions of LGBTQ people in loving and 
supportive relationships have married 
and formed families, particularly after 
the Supreme Court ruled, in Obergefell 
v. Hodges, that the Constitution pro-
tects marriage equality. 
An estimated 2 million children are 
being raised by LGBTQ families today. 
An enormous body of research shows 
that stable and loving families are the 
foundation for children’s well-being 
and success, and children do best when 
their families have the critical legal 
protections to care for one another. 
Thankfully, marriage equality re-
mains constitutionally protected, and 
there is no indication that it will be 
overturned in the foreseeable future. It 
is—and should forever be considered— 
settled law. 
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court’s re-
cent position in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health, which extinguished 
the constitutional right to abortion, 
has raised concerns among some people 
that other rights rooted in the con-
stitutional right to privacy may be at 
risk, notwithstanding the Court’s as-
surance that Dobbs was limited to 
abortion. This includes the right to 
marriage equality. 
In fact, in a concurring opinion in 
Dobbs, Justice Clarence Thomas ex-
plicitly called on the Court to recon-
sider its decisions protecting other fun-
damental rights, including the right to 
same-sex marriage. And although Jus-
tice Thomas did not mention the right 
to interracial marriage, that right re-
lies on the same constitutional doc-
trines as the right to same-sex mar-
riage, and, therefore, it could be vul-
nerable to a legal challenge in the fu-
ture as well. 
Even if we accept the Court’s assur-
ance in Dobbs that its decision does 
not call other rights into question, 
Congress should provide additional re-
assurance that marriage equality is a

matter of settled law. All married peo-
ple who are building their lives to-
gether must know that the government 
will respect and recognize their mar-
riages—for all time. 
b 1215 
The Respect for Marriage Act, which 
I introduced with the co-chairs of the 
LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, the chairs of 
the Congressional Tri-Caucus, and the 
House 
Democratic 
Caucus 
chair, 
HAKEEM
JEFFRIES, 
is 
an 
updated 
version of the bill that I first intro-
duced in 2009. 
The first provision would repeal the 
odious Defense of Marriage Act, or 
DOMA—the 1996 law that discriminates 
against 
married 
same-sex 
couples. 
While that law was ruled unconstitu-
tional, it remains on the books, and it 
must be removed. 
The bill would also enshrine mar-
riage equality for Federal law purposes 
and would ensure that States give full 
legal effect to valid out-of-state mar-
riages regardless of the sex, race, eth-
nicity, or national origin of the indi-
viduals in the marriage. 
This legislation would provide addi-
tional stability for the lives that fami-
lies have built upon the foundation of 
our fundamental rights. Congress must 
pass the Respect for Marriage Act to 
dispel any concern or any uncertainty 
for families worried by the implica-
tions of the Dobbs decision. And it 
must pass the Respect for Marriage Act 
to enshrine in law the equality and lib-
erty that our Constitution guarantees. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we thought the Demo-
crats were obsessed with President 
Trump, but Justice Thomas is a close 
second. This bill is simply the latest 
installment of the Democrats’ cam-
paign to delegitimize and attempt to 
intimidate the United States Supreme 
Court. 
It started when President Trump 
nominated Brett Kavanaugh—that was 
just too much for the left to bear—and 
they launched a smear campaign in an 
attempt to derail his nomination. 
Then we saw Senator SCHUMER stand 
on the steps—remember, a leader in the 
legislative branch—stand on the steps 
of the Supreme Court, a separate and 
equal 
branch 
of 
government, 
and 
threaten Supreme Court Justices. He 
said: I want to tell you, Gorsuch; I 
want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you’ve 
released the whirlwind, and you will 
pay the price. You won’t know what hit 
you if you go forward with these awful 
decisions. 
Just last month, a crazed individual 
attempted 
to 
assassinate 
Justice 
Kavanaugh in his home. An assassina-
tion attempt on a sitting Justice of the 
United States Supreme Court. 
For months, Democrats on the Judi-
ciary Committee have pursued this 
narrative that the Supreme Court is 
somehow illegitimate. Members of the 
committee, including the chairman, 
have introduced a bill to pack the 
Court to add four associate Justices to 
our highest court. 
The committee has held hearings 
that can only be interpreted as an at-
tempt to lay the groundwork for an ef-
fort 
to 
impeach 
Justice 
Thomas. 
Today, the Democrats bring forward a 
bill that is completely unnecessary. 
Why are the Democrats going down 
this path? 
Because, frankly, they have nothing 
else. We are debating this bill today be-
cause it is July of an election year and 
inflation is at a level not seen in 40 
years. It is the highest inflation rate in 
41 years. The price of gas, the price of 
food, the price of daily necessities have 
skyrocketed. We are debating this bill 
today because illegal immigration is at 
unprecedented levels. 
Last month, Customs and Border Pa-
trol reported that we have already sur-
passed the prior years’ total for en-
counters at our southern border, and 
we still have 3 months left in the fiscal 
year. 
We are debating this bill today be-
cause they can’t talk about the fact 
that our country is gripped by an epi-
demic of violent crime in every major 
urban area in this country. Every day, 
Americans are being assaulted, robbed, 
and murdered in our cities. 
We are here because the Democrats 
have no answers and desperately hope 
that a manufactured crisis will help 
them in November. The Democrats 
want Americans to believe that the Su-
preme Court at any moment could step 
in 
and 
overturn 
its 
opinions 
in 
Obergefell and Loving—that is simply 
not true. 
The very decision that Democrats 
say creates this threat explicitly de-
nies it—explicitly disclaims it. Here is 
what the court said in the Dobbs deci-
sion. The Dobbs decision should not be 
misunderstood, 
mischaracterized 
to 
cast doubt on precedents that do not 
concern abortion. 
The court condemned the idea that 
the Dobbs decision would lead to an 
overturning of other cases, stating, 
‘‘Perhaps this is designed to stoke un-
founded fear that our decision will im-
peril other rights.’’ 
It is this unfounded fear that brings 
us here today. We are here for a cha-
rade; we are here for political mes-
saging. The Democrats can’t run on 
their disastrous record, they can’t run 
on any accomplishments. It is less than 
4 months before an election and all 
Democrats can do is stoke unfounded 
fears, and so that is why we are here 
with this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we can defeat it. 
I hope it doesn’t pass. As I said, it is 
unnecessary and wrong. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), the chair of the 
Equality Caucus and a member of the 
Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, today’s 
vote is about love. The love that cou-
ples have for each other and the gov-
ernment’s role in respecting that love 
regardless of their sex or race. Same- 
sex couples and interracial couples get 
married for the same reason others get 
married: to make a lifelong commit-
ment to the person they love. 
Yet, for too long, our government has 
rejected that love. They told these cou-
ples they were less than—that their 
marriages weren’t valid; that they 
didn’t deserve the affirmation or pro-
tections that come with legal recogni-
tion. 
The Supreme Court made clear in 
Loving, Windsor, and Obergefell that 
this rejection of interracial and same- 
sex couples and their commitment to 
one 
another 
was 
unconstitutional. 
Today, we have the opportunity to 
send a clear message to worried couples 
that the Federal Government will con-
tinue to recognize same-sex and inter-
racial marriages, no matter what the 
future holds. 
To Mr. JORDAN’s suggestion that this 
is not necessary—tell it to the millions 
of LGBTQ families that are worried 
about the Supreme Court’s intention to 
rip away more freedoms. They have 
taken away the freedom to reproduc-
tive care. They have hinted at taking 
away contraception. Justice Thomas 
urged them to look at marriage equal-
ity. This is real for families. 
When you talk about inflation, all 
families are dealing with the cost of 
fuel and food, but we don’t have to 
layer on top of that another fear about 
the sanctity of your marriage. This is 
about a fundamental fairness in our 
system, 
ensuring 
that 
people 
can 
marry the person they love. 
If it is not necessary, then vote for it. 
If you are right that we are worried 
and we shouldn’t be, reaffirm it. But 
don’t hide behind that to justify your 
refusal to vote for marriage equality in 
this country, that every single Amer-
ican has the right to marry the person 
they love. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the sponsors of this legislation 
and the leadership of our chairman, 
and, as well, the millions of families 
that are, in fact, families. 
My good friend from Ohio started out 
with the litany of violence, of which 
none of us stands for, we abhor vio-
lence. We believe in the freedom of 
speech and the right to petition. There 
are countless acts of violence against 
those who are seeking reproductive 
freedom and countless acts of violence 
against the LGBTQ community. 
Listen 
to 
the 
violence 
against 
transgender parents just trying to help 
their children, or the violence that 
started in the early days of this com-
munity seeking their freedom and their 
rights. 
I 
know 
it 
well 
from 
the 
LGBTQ+ community in Houston and

the Caucus and the leaders who started 
out in those early years. I know that 
they suffered from just the simple posi-
tion that they were different. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America because that is what the Re-
spect for Marriage Act exemplifies. It 
exemplifies a recognition of the Con-
stitution. As the legislation says, the 
full credit and faith to marriage equal-
ity. 
I believe that our friends have gotten 
it wrong. There is a constitutional 
right to privacy. And morally there is 
a right to love who you love and to es-
tablish a family as you desire. 
It is horrific to believe that with the 
elimination of the precedent of 50 years 
of Roe v. Wade, one Justice decided to 
say, wait, there may be more. There 
may be an ending to marriage equality. 
There may be an ending to any number 
of constitutional rights. 
Well, I am here today to say, I sup-
port enthusiastically H.R. 8404, the Re-
spect for Marriage Act, codifying the 
constitutional right to privacy and the 
constitutional right to marriage. 
Mr. Speaker, over and over again, I 
would ask my colleagues to vote for 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong 
support of H.R. 8404, the ‘‘Respect for Mar-
riage Act.’’ 
This Act would enshrine in federal law mar-
riage equality for same sex and interracial 
couples. 
It would also repeal the discriminatory De-
fense of Marriage Act (DOMA) of 1996 that 
problematically defined marriage as between 
one man and one woman. 
The Supreme Court’s backwards ruling in 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion that was used to justify overturning the 
right to abortion could be weaponized in the 
future to strip away other fundamental rights, 
including the right to marriage equality. 
In his concurring opinion in Dobbs, Justice 
Clarence Thomas explicitly called on the Su-
preme Court to reconsider its decisions pro-
tecting other fundamental rights, including the 
right to same-sex marriage recognized in 
Obergefell v. Hodges. 
Although 
Justice 
Thomas 
conveniently 
chose not to mention the right to interracial 
marriage—a right he currently enjoys—that 
right relies on the same constitutional doc-
trines as the right to same-sex marriage, and, 
therefore, could also be on the chopping 
block. 
The night before the Dobbs ruling, LGBTQI+ 
couples and people in interracial relationships 
went to sleep confident in the legality of their 
marriages. 
They had no reason to believe that the next 
morning five individuals would pass a ruling 
that would strip women of their right to abor-
tion and threaten the legality of their marriage 
unions. 
On June 24th, amidst the horror of the 
Court’s ruling against abortion rights, innocent 
LGBTQI+, Black, and Brown people had to 
also grapple with the possibility that the legal-
ity of their marriages might be violently 
stripped away. 
We cannot and will not allow Republican 
lawmakers and Conservative Justices to toy 
with the rights of the American people. 
That is why I strongly support the Respect 
for Marriage Act. 
This act would ensure that an individual be 
considered married as long as the marriage 
was valid in the state where it was performed. 
This ensures that same-sex and interracial 
couples would continue to enjoy equal treat-
ment under federal law—as the Constitution 
requires. 
This bill would go further by officially repeal-
ing the Defense of Marriage Act. 
While the Supreme Court effectively ren-
dered DOMA inert with its decision in 
Obergefell, this unconstitutional and discrimi-
natory law, however, still officially remains on 
the books. 
Therefore, H.R. 8404 would repeal DOMA 
once and for all. 
The Respect for Marriage Act would also 
prohibit any person acting under color of state 
law from denying full faith and credit to an out- 
of-state marriage based on the sex, race, eth-
nicity or national origin of the individuals in the 
marriage. 
It would also authorize the U.S. Attorney 
General to enforce these protections and 
would create recourses of action for any indi-
vidual harmed by a violation of this provision. 
If conservative lawmakers and Justices want 
to wage war against human and civil rights, 
we are ready to meet them toe for toe. 
We will not back down for marriage equality. 
We will not back down for racial justice. 
We will ensure equal rights for all American 
people. 
I strongly put my full support behind H.R. 
8404, the Respect for Marriage Act, and en-
courage my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The gentlewoman used the word ‘‘vio-
lence.’’ Violence? Fifty crisis preg-
nancy centers and churches have been 
attacked in the last 11 weeks—50 in 11 
weeks. Think about that. 
As I said in my opening statement, 
the leader of the Senate stood on the 
steps of the Supreme Court and said to 
two specific Justices: You have re-
leased the whirlwind, and you will pay 
the price. The Speaker of this body 
waited 4 weeks to give protection to 
Supreme Court Justices’ families after 
the left had posted online where her 
kids go to school, where their family 
attends church on Sunday morning. 
And in that interim, during that time 
after that bill had come out of the Sen-
ate unanimously, we had the assassina-
tion attempt on one of the Justices— 
one of the very Justices that the Sen-
ate Democrat leader had referenced in 
his comments on the steps of the Su-
preme Court. 
And, of course, the Attorney General 
of the United States refuses to pros-
ecute anyone who has protested at 
those Justices’ homes in direct viola-
tion of the statute while the case was 
still pending in front of the court. Di-
rectly on point. 
So concerns of violence—yeah, we all 
have concerns. She is right about one 
thing: We all have concerns about vio-
lence. But I just want everyone to un-
derstand what is going on as we speak. 
Fifty pregnancy centers and churches 
in 11 weeks. I don’t know if we have 
ever seen anything like that—that 
kind attack on the pro-life community. 
Even so much that a witness who 
came in front of our committee for the 
second time—she was here a few 
months ago and came back the second 
time. The second time she had to bring 
security with her because of threats 
against her life. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON), my good 
friend and the ranking member on the 
Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil 
Liberties Subcommittee on the Judici-
ary Committee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, a 
champion for freedom from Ohio (Mr. 
JORDAN). There is a lot to talk about 
here today, but I have to comment on 
what he just led in with and this vio-
lence that we supposedly all decry. It is 
a bit of a double standard, isn’t it? 
These care pregnancy centers are a 
vital institution in our country. They 
are in all 50 States. There are over 2,700 
of these centers doing vital work every 
single day. They help millions of Amer-
ican women every year. They employ 
and work with over 10,000 medical pro-
fessionals. 
Do you know what their singular 
goal is? 
It is to help women who are in dif-
ficult pregnancy situations, to help 
care for their unborn children. Who in 
the world could be opposed to that? 
You know what? 
Senator ELIZABETH WARREN spoke for 
a lot of our colleagues on the other side 
last week. She came out and shrieked 
they needed to be put out of business in 
her State. They needed to get rid of 
these centers. It is just incredible. 
In the debate on the rule here on this 
floor in the last couple of hours, I went 
down the litany of all those 50 occur-
rences—at least the ones we know 
about, and there are more—where vio-
lence has been perpetrated against 
these centers—these people who are 
doing extraordinary work down in the 
trenches to help their fellow man. 
I ran out of time, I could not list all 
of them and all of the vandalism and 
the destruction and the Molotov cock-
tails and the hatred that is spray- 
painted on the sides of these facilities 
that are funded, by the way, by church-
es and nonprofits and individuals who 
care about the sanctity of every single 
human life in America. Yet, there is 
just complete silence on the other side. 
That is a really sad statement about 
where we are. 
b 1230 
I used to be legal counsel for a num-
ber of those care pregnancy centers, so 
I speak to this with personal experi-
ence. 
Let me get to the issue of the day. 
This bill is just another superfluous ex-
ercise. This bill is completely and 
clearly unnecessary. 
Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? The 
sponsors of this bill know that. They

know that we are in a very divisive 
time in the country, and they are doing 
this anyway. 
This bill is not only unnecessary; it 
is more of the same. It is yet another 
effort to delegitimize the Supreme 
Court. As Mr. JORDAN explained, they 
have been doing that in earnest. Sen-
ator SCHUMER went to the steps of the 
Supreme Court and infamously called 
down 
the 
whirlwind 
on 
Justices 
Kavanaugh and Gorsuch. By the way, it 
led to a planned assassination of Jus-
tice Kavanaugh, all the lawless pro-
tests on their lawns, threatening their 
children, and doxing the addresses of 
Supreme Court Justices’ children. It is 
just unconscionable. It is against the 
law, the plain letter of the law, yet 
crickets from the other side. 
They want to delegitimize the Court. 
They tried to pack it. They want to put 
four liberal Justices on the Court be-
cause they are concerned about the 
conservative majority right now. It is a 
lawless approach and a lawless re-
sponse to the lawlessness of the radical 
left. So, this is another effort to 
delegitimize the Supreme Court. 
It is also a continued disregard, an 
utter and total disregard, for the reg-
ular order in this body. I will explain in 
just a moment why that is so perilous 
in a situation like this with a bill like 
this. 
It is also more desperation to focus 
on anything other than their policy 
failures, which Mr. JORDAN articulated 
here a few moments ago. 
Nonetheless, there is this bill before 
us today. Clearly, it is about simple 
fear-mongering. This is a partisan bill 
to make partisan arguments and to run 
ads in an election cycle. Do you know 
why we say that, Mr. Speaker? Be-
cause, as Mr. JORDAN said, in the Dobbs 
opinion, which supposedly precipitated 
all this, it is clear if you read the opin-
ion that this is not only an unneces-
sary piece of legislation, but it is divi-
sive and misleading, and they know it. 
Because why? Anybody can read the 
opinion for themselves. Justice Alito 
wrote the majority opinion, of course, 
and he clarified it. 
I am a constitutional law attorney. I 
used to litigate cases about the Con-
stitution, what it means, and how it 
should be applied. I did that for 20 
years before I got to Congress. Scarcely 
is there ever language this clear writ-
ten in a Supreme Court opinion. 
Let me give you the quote again, Mr. 
Speaker, in case anybody missed it, in 
case you didn’t see it or you didn’t 
want to see it. Justice Alito said in the 
majority opinion: ‘‘And to ensure that 
our decision is not misunderstood or 
mischaracterized, we emphasize that 
our decision concerns the constitu-
tional right to abortion and no other 
right.’’ He continues: ‘‘Nothing in this 
opinion should be understood to cast 
doubt on precedents that do not con-
cern abortion.’’ 
Does everybody hear that? I will say 
that again: ‘‘Nothing in this opinion 
should be understood to cast doubt on 
precedents that do not concern abor-
tion.’’ 
Do you know why, Mr. Speaker? Be-
cause abortion is a unique area of the 
law. Abortion is about taking the life 
of another unborn person, another per-
son, so the Court recognized that this 
is different and distinct, and everybody 
knows 
that. 
Everybody 
recognizes 
that, even Justice Clarence Thomas, 
whom they have worked so hard to de-
monize. 
If you look at page 119 of the opinion, 
Mr. Speaker, you can see it for your-
self. Justice Thomas said: ‘‘The Court’s 
abortion cases are unique . . . and no 
party has asked us to decide ‘whether 
our entire Fourteenth Amendment ju-
risprudence must be preserved or re-
vised’ . . . Thus, I agree that’’—and he 
quotes Justice Alito—nothing in the 
Court’s opinion ‘‘’should be understood 
to cast doubt on precedents that do not 
concern abortion.’’’ 
That language is so clear. Anybody 
in this country can read that and un-
derstand obviously and plainly what 
that means, every civics student, every 
child. But, apparently, our friends on 
the other side don’t like that language, 
or they don’t want to see it, so they 
have manufactured this crisis, this de-
meaning and divisive debate, trying to 
reopen Pandora’s box that no one has 
opened except the Democrats. 
This is crystal clear. We ought to 
take a moment to remember, too, what 
did not happen after the Obergefell rul-
ing that did happen after the Dobbs 
ruling. Did anybody harass Justice 
Kennedy at his home after Obergefell 
was handed down? No. Did conserv-
atives—those who adhere to the Judeo- 
Christian heritage of the country, 
Evangelicals, and Catholics—did any-
body vandalize businesses to promote 
their own viewpoints? Absolutely not. 
Did Republicans call to abolish the fili-
buster and add Justices to the Court? 
No, because we respect the institutions 
of this Nation. 
But that is exactly what we are see-
ing from the left: a death threat on a 
Justice, endless protests outside the 
homes of the Justices, threats on their 
children, and threats to pack the 
Court. 
Mr. Speaker, we live in an extraor-
dinarily divided time, and reopening 
this policy, which is under no threat of 
any legislative or judicial body any-
where, seems more like an attempt by 
Democrats to stoke fear before the No-
vember elections rather than bringing 
the country together. 
Mr. Speaker, we could use an effort 
to bring the country together right 
now. To that end, since the Democrats 
refuse to discuss what Americans are 
most concerned with, I will take just a 
moment, since we have the moment 
here, to walk through the failures of 
the Democrat policies. It is a quick 
summary. I won’t take long on it. 
I have been doing townhalls back in 
my State of Louisiana, and I can tell 
you what the people are concerned 
about, Mr. Speaker. 
They are concerned about soaring 
prices in the grocery store, at the gas 
pump, and their mortgages. 
They are concerned about uninhib-
ited illegal immigration at the border 
and the utter lawlessness that threat-
ens the very sovereignty, safety, and 
security of our country. 
They are deeply concerned about ris-
ing crime in our cities. 
They are concerned about the stun-
ning incompetence at the most basic 
functions of government from the 
Biden administration. 
These are what I am hearing back 
home as I travel the district holding 
townhalls and talking to constituents. 
Those constituents sent us here—the 
voters, the people—to be their Rep-
resentatives and to work on their be-
half, to work on behalf of them and 
their ability to provide for their fami-
lies with little government overreach 
into their lives. 
From economic failures at home to 
failures on the border, the Democrats 
have time and time again refused to 
work with Republicans on how to ad-
dress the issues at hand. Today is just 
another example. It is just more of the 
same. Here we go, from one vote on an 
unnecessary bill that is only being used 
as a distraction from those failures 
that I referenced to a vote on a spend-
ing bill that will only make those fail-
ures worse. 
I mentioned that part of the problem 
here, too, is the Democrats are rushing 
this bill to the floor outside regular 
order. They just completely defied reg-
ular order. They released the text for 
this bill only hours before its consider-
ation in the Rules Committee last 
night. Democrats have held no legisla-
tive hearing and no markups on this 
bill. 
We serve on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. This would have been within 
our jurisdiction. They didn’t bother to 
bring it to a committee. 
I remember from civics class that 
they taught us that this is how a bill 
becomes a law: You go through the 
process; you go to the committee. We 
shouldn’t even teach that to kids any-
more because it doesn’t happen here 
anymore. 
But that recklessness, that careless-
ness, and that defiance of the rules, 
order, and tradition here have real con-
sequences because one of the con-
sequences in the language of this bill, 
just one by way of example, is on page 
3 of this private right of action clause. 
It raised a lot of eyebrows. We didn’t 
have time to analyze that, debate it, 
and thoughtfully talk about that ap-
proach. Would that declare open season 
on religious persons and institutions? I 
don’t know. It is a question a lot of 
people are asking today, scratching 
their heads, but, again, we had no op-
portunity to delve into that, to talk 
about it, and debate it. Nothing. So, 
they present this bill, and they drop it 
on the country. 
Again, I just would reiterate, in sum-
mary, people back home ask us, there

are lots of problems with things that 
are going on there, but this particular 
bill, what is the problem? 
I just summarized it by saying that 
it is unnecessary, divisive, and mis-
leading. What is worse is that the pro-
ponents of the legislation know that. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, much of what the prior 
two speakers said was absolute non-
sense. Some was true. 
Unfortunately, pregnancy crisis cen-
ters have been the targets of terrorism, 
and that is deplorable. But so have 
abortion clinics. They didn’t mention 
that. Abortion clinics have also been 
the targets of terrorism. 
The murder of Dr. Bernard Slepian 
comes to mind. That is equally deplor-
able, and we should stop both of them 
if we can. 
The rest of what they said was non-
sense. 
The Supreme Court logic, the sub-
stantive due process logic by which the 
Court overthrew Roe v. Wade, applies 
equally to Obergefell, to Loving, and to 
Lawrence, in other words, to the right 
to contraception, to the right to gay 
marriage, and to the right to inter-
racial marriage, for that matter. 
Justice Thomas mentioned all that 
specifically. Yes, he said, this case 
doesn’t involve that. We are not decid-
ing that yet, which is the portion of his 
concurrence that Mr. JOHNSON
read, 
but read the rest of his concurrence 
where he said specifically that we 
should 
overrule 
or 
reconsider 
Obergefell and Lawrence, which is gay 
marriage, which is consensual sodomy. 
He didn’t mention Loving, though, 
for some reason, which is interracial 
marriage. Maybe the fact that he is 
intermarried and so is Senator MCCON-
NELL had something to do with it. But 
the same logic applies there, so that is 
not nonsense. 
Note that they offered no argument 
against this bill at all. We didn’t hear 
anything about the merits of the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN), who is a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I am in 
support of this bill, and I think every-
body should be in support of it. 
It simply says that each State will 
recognize the other States’ marriages 
and not deny a person the right to 
marry based on race, gender, or sexual 
orientation. It urges the Federal Gov-
ernment to do the same thing. 
As far as what the Supreme Court 
said, that we should listen to this and 
listen to that, the Senate listened to 
Gorsuch and Kavanaugh when they 
said that Roe v. Wade is precedent. Do 
you want to listen to them? 
Alito, when he was confirmed, said 
that Roe v. Wade is important prece-
dent. Do you want to listen to him? 
Listen to Thomas, who told you that 
we need to look at these cases, and we 
need to reconsider them. That is gay 
marriage. He didn’t mention inter-
racial, but it is on the same theory. Of 
course, he is involved in an interracial 
marriage. He wouldn’t be married to 
justice Ginni but for the Loving deci-
sion. He mentioned the other case of 
Lawrence. 
We need to be concerned. This bill is 
an American bill. Everybody should be 
for it. The only reason to be against it 
is because you really don’t want to go 
on record of being in favor of those 
rights that have been extended to 
Americans and that are potentially in 
jeopardy. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY), who is a member of the Ju-
diciary Committee. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle paint with a 
broad brush stroke the language of-
fered by Justice Clarence Thomas, a 
Justice whom I consider to be a friend, 
a great defender of the Constitution, 
and a great member of the United 
States Supreme Court despite being 
pilloried by the left and laid out as 
something other than the great patriot 
that he is. 
In his concurrence, Justice Thomas 
wrote: ‘‘After overruling these demon-
strably erroneous decisions, the ques-
tion would remain whether other con-
stitutional provisions guarantee the 
myriad rights that our substantive due 
process cases have generated. For ex-
ample, we could consider whether any 
of the rights announced in this Court’s 
substantive 
due 
process 
cases 
are 
‘privileges or immunities of citizens of 
the United States’ protected by the 
Fourteenth Amendment.’’ 
Now, we could have a robust debate 
in the Judiciary Committee about this 
whole issue. We didn’t do that. This 
bill was dropped on the body yesterday 
afternoon, an hour and a half before 
Rules. I went and testified before 
Rules, but we had no benefit of a de-
bate in Judiciary Committee to have a 
deep discussion about this issue, about 
the constitutional implications. Nor 
did we have the ability to debate the 
reality that the words that this codi-
fies Obergefell and Loving are simply 
false. It does no such thing. 
I do think in this case, as the chair-
man pointed out, that it is a full faith 
and credit recognition issue, but a lot 
of the rhetoric coming from the left is 
that this somehow codifies those two 
opinions. It does not. 
It does not do that because those 
opinions recognized rights under var-
ious legal theories, one of which is sub-
stantive due process, which Justice 
Thomas is pointing out he has concerns 
with because Justice Thomas has con-
cerns with how we make law and how 
we recognize law. He has concerns 
about that, the how. It matters, and 
that is what Justice Thomas laid out. 
He never said anything about his con-
clusion on those specific questions but 
rather the how. 
As my colleague from Ohio and my 
colleague from Louisiana both ade-
quately laid out, the majority opinion 
lays out very specifically their view 
about the implication of the Dobbs 
opinion on these other recognized 
rights under the previous precedent of 
the Court. But I think it merits noting 
that while we are here talking about 
the substance of the issue that it does 
matter when the Court steps in and 
makes law because we end up where we 
are right here. We end up in a situation 
with difficult decisions. 
For example, when does life begin? 
When does it begin? When do we have a 
duty to protect that life? 
We could have a very robust debate 
here in this body if we ever actually de-
bated on the floor of the people’s 
House, but we don’t. 
b 1245 
When does life begin? It is a com-
plicated question. My colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle don’t really want 
to have that discussion, right? 
Does life begin at birth? 
Does life begin before birth? 
You say, Well, it is up to the mother. 
Well, it is not up to the mother a week 
after birth. We, society, protect that 
life, right? 
So the debate is: Do you protect that 
life a week before birth? Do you pro-
tect that life at conception? These are 
actually, difficult complex questions 
involving faith, involving values, in-
volving life. 
But, no, no. We can’t have a debate 
about that here and have a reasoned 
debate because the Court plucked that 
out from the people, and the Court 
manufactured an opinion to define 
when life begins and how we should 
deal with it. 
Now, we are talking about other 
issues, talking about marriage. We 
have had opinions that deal with mar-
riage. 
Now, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle want to put forward a bill 
that is clearly political in nature. 
They don’t want to talk about infla-
tion. They don’t want to talk about 
wide-open borders. They don’t want to 
talk about rampant crime. They don’t 
want to talk about the state of this 
country, in decline, heading into a re-
cession, 
where 
people 
are 
hurting 
across the country. They don’t want to 
talk about that. 
So they bring forward a political bill. 
And then they want to take different 
issues and policy choices, marriage, 
marriage based on race, marriage based 
on sex, that this body didn’t define; 
that State legislatures did define in 
varying disagreeable terms across the 
Nation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. ROY. The court steps in in 2015 
and now, we are 7 years into recogni-
tion of same-sex marriage. And we can 
have a debate about the policy of that 
decision, but the Court steps in and 
says, there you go.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6724 
July 19, 2022 
And my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle want to purposely, for po-
litical reasons, conflate lots of dif-
ferent issues. 
And I think it is important that my 
colleagues on this side of the aisle un-
derstand what we are doing here today; 
that we are going to vote on the rec-
ognition of marriage, as a body, as rep-
resentatives of the people. Okay? 
Separate from whatever decision a 
court may make, we are going to make 
a decision here about the recognition 
of marriages across State lines where 
there are differences of opinion still to 
this day about how one defines mar-
riage. 
In the name of full faith and credit, 
you will go to the people of Texas, by 
our elected Representatives, to my Re-
publicans on this side of the aisle, Re-
publicans will be voting on this floor 
today on the question of whether the 
Federal Government should tell Texas 
what marriages they have to recognize, 
irrespective of what the Court has said. 
That is a vote; that is a choice; that 
is a decision. We should not hide be-
hind the use of the Equal Protection 
Clause with respect to marriage not 
being impacted because of race, to then 
say that marriage must be recognized 
for same-sex purposes by a vote by the 
body, by the people. 
It is a choice, and we should under-
stand that today, and we should under-
stand what we are voting on since we 
never had the luxury or the benefit or 
the responsibility of debating this in 
the Judiciary Committee where we 
should have debated it. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Much of what the gentleman from 
Texas just said was irrelevant; but he 
made one correct point. He said that 
the 
bill 
before 
us 
today 
codifies 
Obergefell. It does, and if Obergefell is 
not overruled by the Supreme Court, it 
is not necessary, but it is also not 
harmful. 
If Obergefell is overruled by the Su-
preme Court, as Justice Thomas hints 
it might be, then passing this bill be-
comes vital. 
And as to recognizing marriage in 
one State or another State, obviously, 
if you get married in Texas and you go 
to Nevada, you don’t get unmarried. 
You can’t be married in one State and 
not in another State. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
just want to say that I think we do un-
derstand what we are doing here today; 
and what we are doing is supporting 
people’s right to love and their equal 
protection under the law, plain and 
simple. 
Extreme, MAGA Republicans con-
tinue to weaponize our government in-
stitutions, turning them against the 
people they are called to protect. 
The Respect for Marriage Act will 
make marriage equality the law of the 
land. 
During Pride Month, the extreme 
Texas GOP openly declared, openly de-
clared, 
at 
their 
convention 
their 
homophobia and bigotry as part of 
their agenda. They are going as far as 
labelling same-sex couples as having an 
abnormal lifestyle. 
We will not allow this rightwing ob-
session to impose their personal reli-
gious views on people’s private lives to 
go any further. 
To my colleagues across the aisle, 
and to the Texas GOP, marrying the 
person you love is not abnormal. It is, 
frankly, none of your business. 
Abnormal is your obsession with 
what other people do in their private 
lives and in their homes. 
‘‘Love is love.’’ ‘‘Amor es amor.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The chairman of the full committee 
is right. This legislation would, in fact, 
codify Obergefell. But what it would 
also do is reverse the law in 35 States, 
where those States have said, marriage 
should be what—you know—traditional 
marriage. In fact, in 30 of those 35 
States, the people of those respective 
States went to the ballot and voted for 
that. 
So let’s be clear. He is right. You can 
codify what the Court said in that deci-
sion, but it would undo what the people 
in the respective States, 35 States, ei-
ther in 5 of those States through their 
elected Representatives in the legisla-
ture, or in 30 of those States where the 
people went to the voting booth and 
voted, it would undo that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the Su-
preme Court, in the Obergefell deci-
sion, reversed the actions of the people 
in those 30 or 35 States. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas 
(Ms. 
ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, once 
again, we have gotten a glimpse into 
the dark future Republicans have in 
store for Americans unless we stop 
them. 
The Republican-controlled Supreme 
Court hasn’t just stripped women of 
the right to determine their own future 
by overturning Roe v. Wade, but Jus-
tice Clarence Thomas has invited at-
tacks on access to contraceptives, pri-
vate intimacy between adults, and 
marriage equality. 
Last week, our House Democratic 
majority voted to codify Roe v. Wade, 
and this week, the House Democratic 
majority is here to defend your right to 
marry who you love. I rise in strong 
and urgent support of the Respect for 
Marriage Act. 
Republicans are intent on turning 
back the clock to create a group of sec-
ond-class citizens with limited rights. 
When they say they want to send these 
issues back to the States, that is code 
for wanting to ensure that State legis-
lative bodies can eradicate civil rights 
protections. 
If you think your hard-earned rights 
are protected, think again, because Re-
publicans are coming for you. Demo-
crats, however, are with you. 
To the American public, take note of 
our votes, and who is with you and who 
is not. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the distinguished 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
honored to see you presiding over this 
very 
important 
legislation. 
And 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for the leadership of bringing this im-
portant legislation to the floor. Mr. 
NADLER has been in the lead on this for 
decades. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support for the Respect for Marriage 
Act, bipartisan and bicameral legisla-
tion to enshrine into law a funda-
mental freedom, the right to marry 
whomever you choose. 
As radical justices and rightwing 
politicians continue their assault on 
our basic rights, Democrats believe 
that the government has no place be-
tween you and the person you love. 
Let us salute Judiciary Chairman 
JERRY NADLER for his persistent lead-
ership on this issue. It was 13 years 
ago, Chairman NADLER, alongside then- 
Representative, now-Senator TAMMY 
BALDWIN, Senator DIANNE
FEINSTEIN, 
and others introduced a bill by the 
same name to repeal the Defense of 
Marriage Act. 
Defense of marriage; proposed by 
somebody who had been married three 
times. We don’t know which marriage 
he was defending. 
And today, we will finally achieve 
that long-held goal. 
I really don’t care how many times 
somebody is married. I care about how 
they try to impose their hypocrisy on 
others. 
Thank you also to the Congressional 
LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus Chair DAVID 
CICILLINE, and all of the members of 
the Caucus, for being tireless voices in 
the fight for full equality. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here because just 
3 weeks ago, the Republican-controlled 
Supreme 
Court 
overturned 
Roe 
v. 
Wade, ripping away a woman’s freedom 
over her most intimate health deci-
sions. 
These radical Justices took a wreck-
ing ball to precedent of the court and 
privacy in the Constitution and placed 
even more of our cherished freedoms on 
the chopping block. 
Don’t take it from me. Indeed, as As-
sociate Justice Clarence Thomas de-
clared in his concurrence, this is what 
he said. These are his words: ‘‘ . . . in 
future cases, we should reconsider all 
of this Court’s substantive due process 
precedents, including Griswold, Law-
rence, and Obergefell. Because any sub-
stantive due process decision is ‘de-
monstrably erroneous,’ we have a duty 
to ‘correct the error’ established by 
those precedents.’’ 
In total defiance of the precedents of 
the Supreme Court; in total defiance of 
what some of the candidates for Jus-
tice on the Supreme Court testified

that they supported, precedent. And 
they voted against it. And now, they 
want to go after other rights of pri-
vacy. 
Make no mistake: While his legal 
reasoning is twisted and unsound, it is 
crucial that we take Justice Thomas 
and the extremist movement behind 
him at their word. This is what they 
intend to do. 
Indeed, just yesterday, a Republican 
Senator declared that the Obergefell 
decision was clearly wrong, plainly 
suggesting rightwing interest in taking 
aim at marriage equality. 
We must act now to defend same-sex 
and interracial marriages from this 
bigotry and extremism. 
In the wake of the Dobbs decision, 
with marriage rights now squarely in 
Republican crosshairs, Democrats are 
ferociously fighting back. 
With the landmark Respect for Mar-
riage Act, we ensure that marriage 
equality remains the law of the land, 
now and for generations to come. Im-
portantly, this legislation will repeal 
the unconstitutional and discrimina-
tory Defense of Marriage Act. 
The Republicans knew that the De-
fense of Marriage Act was unconstitu-
tional when they passed it. You know 
how I know that? Because shortly 
thereafter, they introduced a bill to 
overturn—to make sure that the De-
fense of Marriage Act was not sub-
jected to judicial review. Some of them 
proclaimed at that time that Marbury 
v. Madison, which established the prin-
ciple of judicial review was wrongly de-
cided, and they wanted to rid the proc-
ess of judicial review from the Defense 
of Marriage Act, recognizing, admit-
ting that they knew it cannot with-
stand judicial review. 
So while it was sent to—the Defense 
of Marriage—to the dustbin of history 
with United States v. Windsor and 
Obergefell v. Hodges, our bill finally 
takes it off the books for good. That 
way, no future administration or ma-
jority in Congress can wield this ap-
palling policy as a weapon against our 
LGBTQ loved ones. 
This legislation also guarantees that 
no married couple can be denied equal 
protection under Federal law. This is 
really very important—from tax provi-
sions to Social Security benefits, and 
more—even if the Court were to erase 
marriage freedom, God forbid. 
Finally, 
this 
legislation 
blocks 
States from denying recognition to 
valid, out-of-state marriages, even if a 
State were to enact heinous restric-
tions. 
By passing the Respect for Marriage 
Act today, House Democrats, in a bi-
partisan, bicameral—and I salute the 
Chairman for that announcement that 
he made—take another step to defend 
freedom for the American people. 
b 1300 
Last week, our proud pro-choice, pro- 
women Democratic majority passed 
two major bills to restore and protect 
health freedom. 
Our Ensuring Women’s Right to Re-
productive Freedom Act will ensure 
that the fundamental right to travel 
and obtain needed healthcare remains 
in the hands of the American people, 
not in those of extreme rightwing poli-
ticians which is the future House Re-
publicans’ desire. 
Our Women’s Health Protection Act 
will, once again, make the protections 
of Roe v. Wade the law of the land. 
Later this week, the House will pass 
the Right to Contraception Act so that 
every couple may determine the size 
and timing of their families as pro-
tected by Griswold v. Connecticut. 
Not just couples; people. Contracep-
tion. Contraception. Can you believe 
they are going after contraception? 
Well, believe it because they have been 
going after contraception for decades 
in the Congress. 
Now the Associate Justices have 
given us clear warning that this is in 
their sights. 
The contrast could not be clearer: 
While Democrats work to protect and 
expand freedom in our country, Repub-
licans seek to punish and control our 
most intimate personal decisions. 
Mr. Speaker, it is outrageous and un-
conscionable that today, a radical Re-
publican Party seeks to wind back the 
clock 
on 
decades 
of 
hard-fought 
progress. 
As we pass this landmark legislation 
today, we salute the generations of ac-
tivists and advocates, organizers and 
mobilizers, who fought relentlessly to 
advance the all-American ideal of full 
equality for all. 
I say often that our inside maneu-
vering can just go so far. The outside 
mobilization produces the best possible 
results. 
Personally, it is with some emotion 
that I think about my close friends, 
the iconic Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin 
of San Francisco. They were an inspi-
ration to so many of us in San Fran-
cisco, in California—indeed, the coun-
try—teaching us that equality is not 
about tolerance. It is about respect. It 
is about taking pride. 
This bill makes crystal clear that 
every couple and their children—imag-
ine if you are the children of a mar-
riage equality or an interracial couple, 
and you see the Congress of the United 
States and the Supreme Court of the 
United States making an assault on 
your parents’ marriage, how damaging 
that can be. 
This bill makes crystal clear that 
every couple and their children have 
the fundamental freedom to take pride 
in their marriage and have their mar-
riage respected under the law. 
With that, I urge a strong—hopefully 
a strongly bipartisan vote for the Re-
spect of Marriage Act. I, again, salute 
the chairman for his great work. 
Mr. 
JORDAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
Speaker of the House just said, ‘‘Re-
publicans knew the Defense of Mar-
riage Act was unconstitutional when 
they passed it.’’ 
Did the 118 Democrats who voted for 
that legislation know the same thing? 
Did the President of the United States, 
President Clinton, when he signed it 
into law, did he know it was unconsti-
tutional? 
I mean, I have heard some ridiculous 
things said on the House floor in my 
time here in the United States Con-
gress, but that one—that one—was 
right up there. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON), my good friend. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
We have just been treated to a mas-
ter 
class 
of 
misinformation. 
The 
Speaker also just said, ‘‘Can you be-
lieve they are going after contracep-
tion?’’ 
Give me a break. She knows that is 
not true. There is not a single Repub-
lican even talking about that or any of 
these other categories of the law. This 
is designed to divide the country. This 
bill is a shameful effort at that. 
Mr. NADLER, when we were talking 
about our concerns about the care 
pregnancy centers being under assault, 
to make his case that pro-lifers are vio-
lent, he referenced the terrible murder 
of Mr. Slepian, an abortion provider, in 
1998. That was a quarter century ago. 
We are talking about the last 11 
weeks. We have had 50 care pregnancy 
centers 
vandalized, 
attacked 
with 
Molotov 
cocktails, 
spray-painted, 
threats being made to Supreme Court 
Justices. There is no equivocation here 
at all. 
Mr. COHEN implied that the conserv-
ative Justices misled the Senate in 
their confirmation hearings. We have 
got the receipts on that. It is demon-
strably untrue. 
Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the 
majority opinion in Dobbs, said during 
his 2006 confirmation that Roe was ‘‘ 
. . . an important precedent of the Su-
preme Court.’’ 
‘‘It was decided in 1973, so it has been 
on the books for a long time.’’ 
But he declined to call the ruling 
‘‘settled law.’’ 
Justice Thomas, in 1991 in his hear-
ings, he declined to comment on his 
views on Roe at all. He said, ‘‘I do not 
think that at this time that I could 
maintain my impartiality as a member 
of the Judiciary and comment on that 
specific case.’’ 
Justice Gorsuch, 2017 confirmation 
hearings, he said Roe was ‘‘ . . . a 
precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
It was reaffirmed in Casey in 1992 and 
in several other cases.’’ 
‘‘So a good judge will consider it as 
precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court 
worthy as treatment of precedent like 
any other.’’ 
However, he refused to signal how he 
would rule in future cases on abortion. 
Justice Kavanaugh, 2018 confirma-
tion hearings, echoed Gorsuch by say-
ing that Roe was an ‘‘important prece-
dent,’’ but he indicated during his con-
firmation that he would be open to 
overturning ‘‘settled law,’’ including

Roe, citing a long list of past Supreme 
Court cases. 
Justice Barrett, she was much more 
reserved on the Roe precedent. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, in her confirmation hearings 
in 2020, she said she was committed to 
obeying ‘‘all the rules of stare decisis,’’ 
promising that ‘‘if a question comes up 
before me about whether Casey or any 
other case should be overruled, that I 
will follow the law of stare decisis, ap-
plying it as the Court is articulating it, 
applying 
all 
the 
factors, 
reliance, 
workability, being undermined by later 
facts in law, just all the standard fac-
tors.’’ ‘‘I promise to do that for any 
issue that comes up.’’ 
She said that she had to remain neu-
tral on it as an umpire, as they all did. 
The record is clear. The quotes are 
there. Anybody can Google this. What 
they are presenting here on this floor 
is not true. It is demonstrably untrue, 
and they are doing it for partisan pur-
poses. Every time they talk, they reaf-
firm our position on that. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JONES), a 
member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
because the far-right 6–3 majority on 
the Supreme Court is on a rampage 
against basic freedoms currently en-
joyed by the American people. 
In his concurring opinion in Dobbs, 
Justice Clarence Thomas gave us a 
heads-up that the Court is next coming 
for the ability of same-sex couples to 
get married. 
I am one of only nine openly gay 
members of this body. For me, this is 
personal. I still remember where I was 
on June 24, 2011, the day the New York 
State 
legislature 
passed 
marriage 
equality. 
I was living with my friends in New 
York City, but I was still closeted, and 
I was so afraid, still, that someone 
might find out the truth about my 
being gay. 
So, instead, I closed the door to my 
room and cried tears of joy by my lone-
some. Finally, my home State of New 
York had recognized me as a full 
human being, affirmed all of those 
scary, yet beautiful feelings that I had 
bottled up inside for decades; won-
dering, hoping one day that the world 
would change. 
Four 
years 
later, 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s decision in Obergefell sent this 
same message to millions of LGBTQ+ 
Americans. I remember being struck 
then by the words of Justice Kennedy 
who authored the opinion. 
‘‘It would misunderstand these men 
and women to say they disrespect the 
idea of marriage. Their plea is that 
they do respect it, respect it so deeply 
that they seek to find its fulfillment 
for themselves. Their hope is not to be 
condemned to live in loneliness, ex-
cluded from one of civilization’s oldest 
institutions. They ask only for equal 
dignity in the eyes of the law.’’ 
Well, since Obergefell, nearly 300,000 
same-sex couples have been married. 
Imagine telling the next generation of 
Americans—my generation—that we no 
longer have the right to marry who we 
love. Congress can’t allow that to hap-
pen. 
I am proud to introduce along with 
my colleagues, including Representa-
tive NADLER, the Respect for Marriage 
Act, which would codify the right to 
marriage equality under Federal law, 
but we have to do more than that. We 
have to expand the Supreme Court of 
the United States to protect funda-
mental rights once and for all. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York, (Mr. SEAN PATRICK 
MALONEY). 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of 
New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the Republicans want 
to talk about anything but marriage 
equality today. It is almost like they 
don’t have any good arguments to 
make on marriage equality. 
Mr. Speaker, my husband, Randy, 
and I have been together for 30 years. 
We have raised three remarkable kids 
from diapers to college diplomas. Dur-
ing all those years, during all that 
time together, we have only been le-
gally married since 2014. We had a 22- 
year engagement before an 8-year mar-
riage. 
When I was elected as a Member of 
Congress in 2012, my husband, Randy, 
couldn’t have health insurance through 
this body. His spouse ID said com-
panion on it, and we had to fight to get 
him one of these security pins we all 
wear. 
But through hard work and a historic 
coalition, through great allies and 
partnerships, love won. On the day the 
Supreme Court decided we had equality 
rights for marriage in this country, a 
bunch of us stood in front of the Court 
and sang the national anthem because 
it is a beautiful thing when your coun-
try catches up to you. 
Today, we are going to vote for the 
Respect for Marriage Act to decide and 
to make clear whether or not we will 
go back. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. SEAN
PATRICK 
MALONEY). 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of 
New York. Mr. Speaker, whether or not 
every American, despite their race or 
their sexuality, has the freedom to 
marry the person they love; it is a sim-
ple choice, and I know where I stand. 
Every Member of Congress will get to 
stand and be counted today, and you 
can choose between equality or dis-
crimination. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the Respect for Mar-
riage Act to enshrine the right to 
marry the person you love under Fed-
eral law by repealing the discrimina-
tory Defense of Marriage Act. 
In the wake of the Supreme Court’s 
overturning of Roe v. Wade, the doors 
have 
been 
swung 
wide 
open 
for 
unelected judges to further strip pro-
tections from the American people. 
This crucial bill reaffirms our com-
mitment to a promise of equality for 
all, erasing further discrimination still 
on the books against same-sex mar-
riage, and protecting the constitu-
tional right to marriage equality, in-
cluding interracial marriage. We will 
not allow the clock to be rolled back 
even further. 
Mr. Speaker, it is imperative we pass 
the Respect for Marriage Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN). 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
simple bill—whether or not you sup-
port current law on marriage in this 
country, which includes for the LGBT 
and the interracial couples across the 
Nation. 
My friend from Ohio said this bill is 
unnecessary. This bill is very necessary 
because the extremist-packed Supreme 
Court recently took away a half a cen-
tury of law on Roe. 
In that decision, Justice Clarence 
Thomas said they should revisit mar-
riage equality. We have people in this 
House and in the Senate, like Senator 
TED CRUZ, who have said the exact 
same thing. 
Here is what I want, I want to make 
sure that my husband, Phil, can visit 
me in the hospital, should I have to go 
back again, like when I had a triple by-
pass a few years ago. 
I want to ensure my husband has my 
earned benefits for retirement and So-
cial Security. I want to make sure that 
my husband is taken care of just like 
your spouses are taken care of. 
If I was the entity on the other side 
of the aisle, I would be more concerned 
when my own Member is accused of 
having cocaine-fueled orgies than wor-
rying about the morality of my mar-
riage. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ALLRED). 
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, we hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these 
are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. 
With 
these 
words, 
our 
Founders 
summed up the entire theory of what

has become our constitutional Repub-
lic. But since the Supreme Court’s rul-
ing overturning Roe v. Wade, we have 
seen inalienable rights, like the right 
to choose how and who to form a fam-
ily with, openly questioned by Justices 
on the Supreme Court and rightwing 
politicians. 
Mr. Speaker, love is love. It took us 
far too long to recognize the right for 
same-sex couples to marry. Within 7 
years since it was, millions of Ameri-
cans have come to expect that they, 
too, will be able to fall in love and 
marry the person of their choosing. 
What 
right 
could 
be 
more 
foundational? Their marriages, their 
family, their right to life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness is worth pro-
tecting, and that is why I will proudly 
vote for the Respect for Marriage Act. 
b 1315 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. NOR-
CROSS). 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, before 
us is a bill, the Respect for Marriage 
Act. 
I woke up this morning, got ready to 
come over to the Capitol, and as I often 
do, I glanced over to pictures of my 
family, and I glanced to a picture of 
my 9-month-old grandson. I couldn’t be 
happier about the newest addition to 
our family. I couldn’t be prouder of the 
two people who brought him into the 
world, my daughter Corey and her wife 
Hedya. 
When my daughter told me she want-
ed to get married, I told her what every 
good parent should tell their children, 
that if this is the person you want to 
spend the rest of your life with, I 
couldn’t be happier for you. 
Shortly after that announcement of 
wanting to get married, my daughter 
had some terrible news. Her fiancee 
just found out she had breast cancer. 
With decisions facing them, they de-
cided to get married right away. 
Given all the complications that 
come with managing treatment, the 
decision to get married quickly was in-
credibly important. As I stood at their 
wedding, in a U.S. court, with a Fed-
eral judge presiding over their union, I 
knew it was only made possible be-
cause of a recent Supreme Court deci-
sion. 
Today, we consider that legislation. 
That same Court has opened the door 
to dismantling families like mine, 
splitting this little guy’s family apart 
potentially. We can’t let that happen. 
We are talking about marriage, two 
committed people, to make sure they 
have a secure family, and all we have 
to do is vote ‘‘yes.’’ Don’t complicate 
the issue. It is that simple. 
I don’t speak about the religious be-
liefs of my colleagues, but I have to 
ask: What God would find fault in this 
baby and his two mommies? There is 
nothing wrong with this. This is pure 
love. It is what we all should aspire to. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ so we are equal in all 
States. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 8404, the Re-
spect for Marriage Act. 
Like many Americans, I was deeply 
disturbed by Justice Thomas’ opinion 
in Dobbs v. Jackson, which actually 
named marriage equality as the next 
piece of settled case law that he is in-
tent on destroying. 
Let’s face it, marriage equality is at 
risk in America, and we must pass leg-
islation to enshrine the right to marry 
for same sex and interracial couples be-
fore it is too late. 
Early in my career, when I was a 
State representative, I supported legis-
lation to ban discrimination based on 
sexual orientation. I remember dis-
cussing this bill with my late father, 
who grew up during the civil rights 
movement. He was no activist, but he 
firmly believed that all Americans 
should be entitled to equal civil rights. 
Just like the Jim Crow laws, which 
legalized discrimination, that existed 
during his lifetime, he believed that 
our Nation’s discriminatory treatment 
of LGBTQ Americans would mark a 
shameful chapter in our Nation’s his-
tory. 
When the Supreme Court legalized 
marriage equality, we turned a page 
granting equal protection under the 
law for all Americans, no matter who 
they love. But now I fear that future is 
no longer guaranteed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
bill so that marriage equality remains 
the law of the land. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, as I said 
at the outset and the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) have said, 
we think this legislation is unneces-
sary. 
Justice Alito was very clear—again, 
it has been read several times—the 
Dobbs decision should not be misunder-
stood or mischaracterized to cast doubt 
on precedents that do not concern 
abortion. 
The Court couldn’t have been clearer. 
The Obergefell decision undid what 35 
States have as law in their respective 
States. Thirty of those States it was 
the vote of the people, as I said before. 
But this legislation is going to, I guess, 
just go after the decision of the respec-
tive States, and, as I said, the voters in 
those States. 
I think it is also, as we have indi-
cated, a further effort to intimidate 
the Court. We have had Senator SCHU-
MER’s statements on the Supreme 
Court steps, we have had the AG’s inac-
tion with regard to protestors at Jus-
tices’ homes, and, of course, we have 
had the Democrats’ introduction of a 
bill to add four Associate Justices to 
the Supreme Court to pack the Court, 
and not focus on some of the things 
that are so pressing. 
I mean, Mr. JOHNSON was right when 
he talked about 50 attacks on churches 
and pro-life crisis pregnancy centers in 
11 weeks. That last clause is impor-
tant. In that short a time frame, that 
sustained effort by the left to go after 
the pro-life community and places of 
worship is as wrong as it gets. I would 
love to have a hearing on that issue 
and what actions we might be able to 
take to help stop that because that is 
not supposed to happen in our great 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the Re-
spect for Marriage Act provides addi-
tional stability for the millions of 
American married couples and families 
that have ordered their lives around 
the constitutional guarantee of mar-
riage equality. It has nothing to do 
with attacks on abortion clinics. It has 
nothing to do with attacks on so-called 
pregnancy crisis centers. It has to do 
with marriage. 
This legislation repeals an unconsti-
tutional and discriminatory statute 
that the Court has effectively rendered 
inoperative, but which remains on the 
books. It is time to appeal this abhor-
rent law and fix the mistake that Con-
gress made a generation ago while we 
reinforce and cement current law. 
As 
I 
pointed 
out 
before, 
the 
Obergefell decision is a decision of the 
Supreme Court. If that decision is not 
overturned, this bill is unnecessary but 
harmless. If that decision is over-
turned, this bill is crucial, and we don’t 
know what this Court is going to do. 
Despite what Justice Alito said, Jus-
tice Thomas suggested that the deci-
sion on gay marriage ought to be over-
ruled. 
We have seen this Court overrule 
other precedent in Dobbs, so who can 
be confident that the Court will not 
overturn the Lawrence decision or, 
rather, the Obergefell decision? Who 
can be confident of that? The answer is 
no one. 
As to the gentleman from Ohio’s 
comment that the people in, I think he 
said, 33 States or whatever have de-
cided that gay marriage should not be, 
and it should be up to the people of 
each State, that is absurd. And that is 
why we have one of the provisions of 
this bill. You can’t be married in Texas 
and not be married in New York or vice 
versa. You can’t lose your marriage 
status by crossing a State line. 
This legislation is very necessary to 
make sure that people have the right 
to remain married, that gay couples 
have the right to get married, have the 
right to stay married, and that is why 
leading national organizations have en-
dorsed the bill, including the ACLU,

Federation,

Americans, GLAAD, the Human Rights

ship Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights, the National Black Justice Co-
alition, the National Center for Les-
bian Rights, the National Women’s 
Law Center, and PFLAG. They know 
what is going on. They know what is at 
stake. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a long overdue 
bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme 
Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson dem-
onstrated not only the extremist majority of 
justices’ disregard for constitutional precedent; 
it also showed their disregard for the individual 
liberties of the American people. As if depriv-
ing women of their constitutional right to repro-
ductive health care weren’t enough, Justice 
Thomas’ 
concurring 
opinion 
specifically 
opened the door to the overturning of United 
States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges— 
and implicitly we can read this to mean Loving 
v. Virginia as well. These cases established 
constitutional protections for same-sex and 
interracial marriage in America. 
Today, 1.1 million Americans arc in same- 
sex marriages. Almost ten times as many are 
in interracial marriages. One of the very first 
votes I took as a young state senator in Mary-
land after my first election to public office was 
to repeal our state’s vile and racist anti-mis-
cegenation law. That was in 1967, five years 
after the Supreme Court’s decision in Loving 
v. Virginia. Fifty-five years have now passed 
since that ruling. It has been nine and seven 
years, respectively, since the Windsor and 
Obergefell rulings. Americans have become 
used to knowing that they have a constitu-
tional right to equal marriage. Indeed, Amer-
ican women had gotten used to the security of 
knowing that they had a constitutional right to 
reproductive choice for forty-nine years until 
last month. 
Just as was the case with the immediate 
aftermath of the Dobbs ruling, at least thirty- 
five states already have laws or amendments 
in their state constitution that would outlaw 
same-sex marriage if Obergefell were over-
turned. We must do everything in our power to 
ensure that Republican-controlled state legis-
latures don’t have the opportunity to restrict 
the rights of LGBTQ or interracial couples in 
America. Neither government officials nor Su-
preme Court justices should be able to decide 
that consenting American adults cannot marry. 
That’s why I’m bringing the Respect for Mar-
riage Act to the Floor today to codify the mar-
riage equality precedents set by Loving, Wind-
sor, and Obergefell into federal statute. 
I want to thank Chairman NADLER, Rep. 
CICILLINE, all the Co-Chairs of the LGBTQ+ 
Equality Caucus, Chairwoman BEATTY, Chair-
man RUIZ, Chairwoman CHU, and Democratic 
Caucus Chairman JEFFRIES for taking the lead 
on this crucial legislation. 
We cannot afford to underestimate the risk 
to marriage equality. We cannot afford to be 
complacent and take for granted the rights we 
have under the constitution as Americans. The 
millions of same-sex and interracial couples 
throughout the United States should not have 
to live with the fear that extremist Supreme 
Court justices—who act as though they are 
legislators—could end legal recognition for 
their families or prevent millions of others from 
being able to build families with equal legal 
status. They deserve the assurance that their 
marriages will always be recognized in every 
city, county, and state across the country. 
That is the overwhelming consensus of the 
American people, and it is the clear view of 
our constitution. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in voting 
‘yes’ on this legislation to protect and respect 
marriages across our country. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to support the Respect for 
Marriage Act of 2022. Thank you to Ju-
diciary Chair JERROLD NADLER for in-
troducing H.R. 8404, LGBTQ+ Equality 
Caucus Chair DAVID CICILLINE, and Tri- 
Caucus Chairs for your leadership to 
fight for equal rights for all commu-
nities. 
Everyone should have the equal right 
to marry whomever they love—what-
ever their identity, race or ethnicity. 
While the Supreme Court ruled the 
discriminatory Defense of Marriage 
Act unconstitutional, in the wake of 
the Court’s decision to overturn Roe, 
we cannot rely on the Court alone to 
protect our rights. First, they attacked 
our 
reproductive 
rights, 
but 
next, 
they’ll attack our right to marriage. 
What’s next? 
It is unconscionable that any person 
should face a situation where their 
marriage is threatened or rendered in-
valid because of the dangerous whims 
of the few who want to take this coun-
try backwards. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the entire House 
to support this bill, protect our right 
to marriage, and defend our people 
from the senseless assault on our lib-
erties. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1232, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill. 
The question is on the engrossment

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
b 1330 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Over this last year, Congress began 
to restore our investments after the 
years of disinvestment that working 
families, the middle class, and vulner-
able people believe was wrong. Spend-
ing has favored the biggest corpora-
tions and special interests, which got 
heard first in Washington. But hard-
working Americans are still paying 
high taxes and have not seen a pay in-
crease in years. 
The spike in the cost of living, gas 
prices, and rent are blows to so many. 
That has guided our priorities, and it 
has guided these bills. 
In the Appropriations Committee, we 
were determined to put together bills 
that ensure we offset the rise in prices 
produced by blocked supply chains, the 
greed of oil companies, and the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine. 
H.R. 8294, the package of the six 2023 
appropriations bills before us, provides 
the critical funding America needs. In-
stead of catering to big corporations 
and the wealthy, we uphold our com-
mitment with this legislation that 
helps lower the cost of living, creates 
American jobs, gives working families 
a better shot, and supports small busi-
nesses. As we do so, we tackle our Na-
tion’s and the world’s toughest crises. 
We reach some of our most vulner-
able Americans by funding the pro-
grams that keep roofs over the heads of 
millions and keep food on the tables of 
millions more. We strengthen nutrition 
assistance through WIC, food stamps, 
and child nutrition programs like 
school meals. We increase access to af-
fordable housing with rental assistance 
programs and improve the safety and 
living conditions of those in public 
housing. We also expand opportunities 
for families with support for homeown-
ership programs. 
These bills help invigorate rural 
communities as we expand broadband, 
strengthen water programs in rural 
areas, and invest in single-family home 
loans. 
We support Native Americans and 
honor the Federal Government’s re-
sponsibilities to Native families by in-
vesting in strong and resilient Tribal 
communities, including through hous-
ing, education, and healthcare pro-
grams. 
We also transform the ways we meet 
the needs of our veterans, who deserve 
and who have earned our support, in-
cluding the 9.2 million veterans who 
rely on the VA for their healthcare, by 
increasing funding for medical pro-
grams. For the first time ever, we put 
VA medical care into its own funding 
category so that funding for veterans 
does not have to compete with other 
critical programs. 
Supporting those who protect us also 
means protecting servicemembers and 
their families and communities all 
over our Nation. We invest in our na-
tional security and improve our mili-
tary readiness through robust invest-
ments in critical military installations 
at home and abroad and in the well- 
being of our servicemembers and their 
families. 
At the same time, we also make our 
communities safer by supporting vic-
tims while fighting crime, violence, 
and corruption. 
This package strengthens our capac-
ity to work for all Americans. We en-
sure the IRS has the resources to crack 
down on big corporations and the 
wealthy who do not pay their fair share 
and provide better customer service to 
families navigating the tax system. We 
protect consumers with more funding 
for critical consumer protection agen-
cies by strengthening our food safety

infrastructure, including oversight of 
the baby formula industry. 
We do this while bolstering economic 
development in distressed communities 
and strengthening our economy and 
our economic growth by supporting 
small businesses and entrepreneurs as 
they pursue the American Dream. We 
create jobs and put Americans to work 
rebuilding our infrastructure. We help 
small businesses grow and thrive, fos-
ter the green energy jobs of tomorrow, 
and support a skilled and growing 
workforce. 
We confront the existential threat of 
climate change and strengthen our re-
siliency on various fronts, including by 
investing in cleaner, safer, and more 
affordable American energy, advancing 
climate science, conserving our land 
and water, expanding environmental 
enforcement, and embracing stronger 
environmental justice efforts. 
Finally, with inclusion of nearly 2,700 
community project funding requests 
totaling over $6 billion, we are directly 
meeting the needs of Americans every-
where in ways that will have a pro-
found and lasting impact. 
When taken together, this package 
meets the moment at a time when so 
many want to see critical changes in 
our priorities. It reaches every corner 
of our Nation to give hardworking 
Americans, the middle class, and the 
vulnerable a better shot. I urge my col-
leagues to support these bills. 
I thank the subcommittee staff, led 
by our clerks, for all of their work: 
Christina Monroe with the Transpor-
tation, and Housing and Urban Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee; Martha Foley with the Ag-
riculture, Rural Development, Food 
and Drug Administration, and Related 
Agencies Subcommittee; Scott McKee 
with the Energy and Water Develop-
ment, 
and 
Related 
Agencies 
Sub-
committee; Matt Smith with Financial 
Services and General Government Sub-
committee; Rita Culp with the Inte-
rior, Environment, and Related Agen-
cies 
Subcommittee; 
and 
Jenny 
Neuscheler with the Military Construc-
tion, Veterans Affairs, and Related 
Agencies Subcommittee. 
I also thank all the subcommittee 
chairs and ranking members for their 
efforts and their dedication to these ef-
forts. Interior, Environment, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee Chair 
PINGREE is not here today, but I spe-
cifically thank her for her work. This 
bill makes transformative investments 
in our environment, and this is in large 
part because of her relentless advo-
cacy. 
Madam Chair, I urge support for the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 8294, a package of six ap-
propriations bills. 
As we sit here today, inflation is 9.1 
percent above last year, the highest it 
has been in more than 40 years. Econo-
mists 
recommend 
that 
American 
households budget an extra $5,000 this 
year to cover rising prices. That is over 
$400 a month. Many families simply 
can’t afford this. 
Under this administration, prices of 
everyday goods are skyrocketing. For 
example, gas prices hit an unprece-
dented $5 a gallon; energy services, like 
electricity and natural gas, are up 19 
percent; and groceries have increased 
over 12 percent, the highest jump since 
1979. 
Americans are paying more for just 
about everything. The social spending 
pushed by Members on the other side of 
the aisle is a key driver of today’s in-
flation. Simply put, record-high spend-
ing by the government means record- 
high prices for the American people. 
Unfortunately, the bills before us do 
not reduce spending or reflect the eco-
nomic realities we face. 
Many of these bills receive double- 
digit percentage increases, including a 
70 percent increase for Financial Serv-
ices and General Government, an 18 
percent increase for Interior-Environ-
ment, and a 12.2 percent increase for 
Transportation-Housing and Urban De-
velopment. 
At a time when Americans are strug-
gling to pay for gas and groceries, the 
Federal Government should be reduc-
ing spending. We should prioritize core 
responsibilities, such as our national 
security, and we must cut extravagant 
social programs. 
In addition to my concerns about 
funding levels, the policies proposed in 
these bills do not reflect a bipartisan 
agreement. In particular, the bills be-
fore us today drop longstanding pro-life 
protections 
that 
prevent 
taxpayer 
funding for abortions. The bills allow 
for the closure and transfer of dan-
gerous criminals from Guantanamo 
Bay to the United States and worsen 
our Nation’s energy crisis. 
Just a few months ago, we were able 
to come to an agreement and enact the 
fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills. 
Those 
bills 
continued 
longstanding 
policies supported in the past by Mem-
bers of both parties and drop new con-
troversial provisions. I hope we will be 
able to do the same this year so that 
those bills can get to the President’s 
desk and be signed into law. 
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the chairwoman of 
the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Energy 
and 
Water Development, and Related Agen-
cies. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I thank 
Chair DELAURO very much for her inde-
fatigable leadership of this committee 
in service to the American people. I 
also thank Ranking Member GRANGER, 
as well as the dedicated staff. Special 
plaudits to Ranking Member SIMPSON, 
a hardworking, serious Member of Con-
gress who devotes his considerable tal-
ents to real challenges facing our Na-
tion. 
Our 2023 Energy and Water bill takes 
a significant step forward to secure 
American energy independence, rebuild 
critical infrastructure, foster scientific 
innovation, and sustain life on our cor-
ner of Mother Earth. 
We meet at a time when Lake Mead, 
once the largest water reservoir in the 
United States, is now at record-low lev-
els due to a punishing Western drought 
across seven States that is sucking the 
Colorado River dry. London, England, 
has experienced its hottest day at 104 
degrees, and forest fires are raging now 
across Europe and in our Nation, as 
well. 
Madam Chair, 6,600 wildland fire-
fighters and support personnel are con-
taining 85 large fires and complexes 
that have already burned over 3 million 
acres in 13 of our States. Fourteen new 
large fires have been reported, seven in 
Texas, two in Alaska, two in Wash-
ington, and one each in Arizona, Cali-
fornia, and Idaho. 
In 
addition, 
Putin’s 
unjust 
war 
against Ukraine crystalizes how essen-
tial having a comprehensive energy 
independence strategy is for our Na-
tion, for our economy, and surely for 
our security. 
America has been making great 
progress since the Department of En-
ergy was established in 1977, but we are 
not at home plate in energy independ-
ence. With this bill, we are rounding 
second base and running hard toward 
third on our way to home plate. We are 
diversifying across many energy sec-
tors that hold promise and are climate- 
friendly: advanced nuclear, hydrogen, 
solar, and wind, but also thermal heat 
recapture, conservation, and so much 
more. 
In traditional sectors since 2010, oil 
production has doubled, and natural 
gas production is about 60 percent 
higher. But, of course, those supplies 
are finite. We must advance to infinite 
energy sources for the long haul of our 
country and world. 
Our bill invests over $56 billion for 
America’s energy and water priorities 
while 
supporting 
good-paying 
jobs 
across the country. Key investments 
include $48.2 billion for the Department 
of Energy, $3.3 billion above enacted. 
Within the Department of Energy, as 
our citizens experience water short-
ages, wildfires, and fiercer weather 
events, energy efficiency and renew-
able energy receive record funding of $4 
billion—yes, an $800 million increase 
above enacted. We live in unusual 
times. 
That includes a new office of State 
and community energy programs that 
receives $562 million to increase energy 
affordability at a time of inflation and 
transform our energy economy by 
working 
more 
cooperatively 
with 
State, 
local, 
and 
community-level 
partners. 
ARPA–E receives $550 million, $100 
million above enacted, to literally in-
vent a new energy future for this coun-
try. 
The Office of Science receives $8 bil-
lion, $525 million above enacted, which

is so vital to America’s energy innova-
tion and research in the physical 
sciences. 
The new Defense Production Act Do-
mestic Clean Energy Accelerator re-
ceives $100 million to expand domestic 
manufacturing and help America lead 
in solar and other clean energy indus-
tries that are being hacked every day 
by, frankly, our political enemies. 
We responsibly fund our nuclear de-
terrent while increasing funding for 
nonproliferation programs. 
The bill provides nearly $11 billion, 
$2.8 billion above the budget request, to 
rebuild our water infrastructure and 
respond to the severe Western drought. 
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Ohio. 
b 1345 
These investments in the Army Corps 
of Engineers and Bureau of Reclama-
tion are critical to protecting and sup-
plying communities in every district of 
our Nation. 
Our bill increases funding for re-
gional commissions which promote 
economic development in economically 
challenged regions and distressed coun-
ties across our country. Our bill will 
strengthen the foundational compo-
nents that underpin every aspect of de-
cent life in our Nation and represents a 
strategic investment in America’s fu-
ture, without question. 
Madam Chair, I thank the staff who 
worked tirelessly to put this bill to-
gether: Scott McKee, Brian Smith, Will 
Ostertag, Daniela Todesco, Eric Lipka, 
John Howes, and Angie Giancarlo. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. SIMPSON), the ranking member of 
Energy and Water Development, and 
Related Agencies Subcommittee. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding time. 
Madam Chair, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 8294, the six-bill fiscal year 
2023 appropriations package that in-
cludes the Energy and Water Develop-
ment appropriations bill. 
Unfortunately, these bills are based 
on funding levels that passed the House 
without any Republican support—zero 
Republican support. Like the Presi-
dent’s budget request, the majority’s 
Energy and Water bill overfunds cer-
tain nondefense programs and short-
changes our national security needs. 
For example, the bill before us is 
below the budget request for weapons 
activities and naval reactors—a budget 
request that many of us considered in-
sufficient to address the current global 
threats. 
We must uphold our Nation’s strong 
nuclear deterrence posture, and to do 
that, we must adequately fund the ac-
tivities necessary to maintain a safe, 
reliable, and effective stockpile. Yet, 
the bill before us cuts some of these 
programs below last year, below the 
budget request, and leaves other items 
completely out. 
On the other hand, the bill increases 
energy efficiency and renewable energy 
activities by more than 25 percent over 
last year’s—and that is on top of the 
tens of billions—I repeat—tens of bil-
lions of dollars in the infrastructure 
bill programs that are in the early 
stages of implementation. 
The bill includes funding for the 
President’s proposal to use the Defense 
Production 
Act 
for 
nonemergency 
issues. For instance, even the Depart-
ment of Energy has indicated that 
there is no supply shortage of insula-
tion. Yet, the administration is claim-
ing it is such an emergency that it jus-
tifies use of the Defense Production 
Act. 
With inflation at the highest levels 
in 40 years, we need to be more judi-
cious about how much and where we al-
locate our discretionary appropria-
tions. 
While 
Republicans 
have 
concerns 
with the overall direction of this bill, I 
would note there are also programs 
that, if considered individually, House 
Republicans could support. For exam-
ple, strong support for the Army Corps 
of Engineers including specific Commu-
nity Project Funding and additional 
programmatic funding that has long 
been a bipartisan priority. 
Of great importance to me, of course, 
is the Department of Energy’s Nuclear 
Energy program. I appreciate that the 
bill continues support for: 
Work on microreactors, including the 
MARVEL program. 
Work to ensure a supply of high- 
assay low-enriched uranium, which will 
be necessary for many of the next gen-
eration of reactors. 
The Advanced Reactors Demonstra-
tion Program; and 
The national laboratories infrastruc-
ture necessary to enable these other 
activities to succeed. 
I would like to work with my col-
leagues as we move the bill forward to 
better support the Advanced Small 
Modular Reactors demonstration pro-
gram. 
The NuScale SMR is the first ever 
NRC-approved SMR design, and we 
need to ensure this demonstration suc-
ceeds. 
Madam Chair, before I yield back, I 
would acknowledge Energy and Water 
Development and Related Agencies 
Chairwoman KAPTUR’s continued com-
mitment 
to 
addressing 
individual 
Member priorities on both sides of the 
aisle. I thank the chair for that consid-
eration, and she has been a pleasure to 
work with across the aisle. 
I also thank the staff for their hard 
work over the past several months, 
particularly 
Scott, 
Brian, 
Will, 
Daniela, and Jaime of the majority 
staff; Angie and Austin of the minority 
staff; and Sarah in my personal staff. 
Finally, 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
DELAURO
and 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER
of the full committee for 
their leadership and support of the im-
portant programs in this bill and doing 
the appropriations process in regular 
order. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Before I yield to the gentleman from 
North Carolina, I would say that Chair-
man PRICE, this will be the last time he 
brings an appropriations bill to the 
floor of the House of Representatives. I 
think I speak for all of us when I say 
that his honesty, his integrity, his 
commitment to the legislative process 
and making it work for the people, not 
only in his district but all over the 
United States, is really pretty extraor-
dinary. 
I quote from Shirley Chisholm, the 
first African-American woman who was 
elected to the House of Representa-
tives, when she said that public service 
is the rent you pay for space on this 
Earth. 
DAVID PRICE has paid that rent over 
and over and over again. 
Madam Chair, it gives me great 
pleasure to yield 6 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
PRICE), the chairman of the Transpor-
tation, and Housing, and Urban Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I thank the chairwoman for 
those kind and generous words. And I 
do rise in strong support of this critical 
legislation. As chairman of the Trans-
portation, and Housing and Urban De-
velopment, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee, or T-HUD as we call it, I 
first thank my partner and ranking 
member, MARIO DIAZ-BALART, for his 
cooperative and collaborative relation-
ship this year and for many years 
prior, including when our roles were re-
versed. 
Madam Chair, the bipartisan work we 
do in assembling our subcommittee 
bills reflects an earlier era when the 
Appropriations Committee presented a 
united front throughout the process. 
That era, regrettably, has passed, but 
the cooperative work remains at the 
subcommittee level. What we have 
done has made this a better bill, and 
hopefully will help us achieve agree-
ment eventually and finalize T-HUD 
and other bills. 
Division A of the bill, the T-HUD sec-
tion, represents our continued commit-
ment to upgrading our aging transpor-
tation infrastructure, addressing our 
Nation’s affordable housing and home-
lessness crises, bolstering our resil-
iency in the face of climate change and 
natural disasters, remedying inequities 
and disparities in our housing and 
transportation 
systems, 
and 
prioritizing safety—whether that is 
eliminating hazards in public housing 
or improving the certification of air-
craft. 
Overall, the bill includes $90.9 billion 
in discretionary funding; that is an in-
crease of $9.85 billion over the current 
year. 
The bill also provides $77.6 billion to 
fully fund programs that utilize the 
Highway Trust Fund as part of last 
year’s historic and bipartisan Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act.

July 19, 2022 
For housing, we continue to ensure 
housing stability for five million peo-
ple by fully renewing all Housing 
Choice Vouchers and meeting the re-
newal needs of public housing, home-
less assistance grants, and several 
other initiatives. This is coupled with 
new investments, including more than 
140,000 new tenant-based vouchers for 
low-income families and people experi-
encing or at risk of homelessness, over 
5,600 new affordable housing units for 
seniors and people with disabilities, 
and more than 6,700 new vouchers for 
veterans 
experiencing 
homelessness 
and youth aging out of foster care. 
The bill also provides an 8 percent in-
crease for the HOME program, an 11 
percent increase for NeighborWorks 
programs, and a historic 29 percent in-
crease for Choice Neighborhoods, a pro-
gram that, like housing for the elderly 
and for people with disabilities, our 
subcommittee has brought back into 
production after they were on life sup-
port. 
I was able to see some of these life- 
changing investments firsthand in my 
own State in Winston-Salem, where I 
toured a Choice Neighborhood with my 
colleague, KATHY MANNING. And there 
are more to come. 
Importantly, the bill provides, for 
the first time, a major investment in 
our Nation’s manufactured housing, by 
providing $500 million for a new pro-
gram to preserve and revitalize this es-
sential form of housing that has been 
too long overlooked. Many of these 
communities have faced significant in-
frastructure and resiliency challenges. 
This bill recognizes the opportunities 
that will come from direct investments 
in manufactured housing, a portion of 
our housing stock that provides for 
over 20 million people. 
On the transportation side, the bill 
upholds the commitment to respond to 
transportation needs across all modes: 
highways, transit, rail, aviation, bike 
and pedestrian projects, and ports. It 
invests in the safety and reliability of 
our passenger and freight rail systems, 
including a combined $1.2 billion for 
the CRISI program and the Federal- 
State Partnership for Intercity Pas-
senger Rail. That has been and remains 
a signature emphasis of our sub-
committee. 
I am particularly proud of this aspect 
of the bill as we build out the Raleigh 
to Richmond corridor, the next step in 
the Southeast Corridor from Wash-
ington to Charlotte and eventually At-
lanta. These regional corridors rep-
resent the future of passenger rail in 
this country, and they are critical to 
reducing 
congestion 
and 
lowering 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
The bill also provides robust funding 
for our transit infrastructure, includ-
ing $3 billion for Capital Investment 
Grants, or New Starts, to create new 
transit routes nationwide, and $646 mil-
lion for Transit Infrastructure Grants 
to help transit agencies innovate and 
improve public transit. 
Madam Chair, before closing, I, too, 
thank our staff for their immeasurable 
contributions to this bill and for guid-
ing the Members and staff on both 
sides of the aisle through this process. 
Starting with our wonderful chief 
clerk, Christina Monroe, as well as Jo-
sephine Eckert, Winnie Chang, Xavier 
Arriaga, Samhita Subramanian, and 
Rachel Keyes, along with Leigh Whit-
taker on my personal staff, and Doug 
Disrud on the minority side. 
Since this is my last time presenting 
the T-HUD bill, I also want to mention 
all of the staff who helped me and my 
colleagues through the subcommittee 
process since I took on the ranking 
member and eventually the chairman’s 
role. That includes three previous 
clerks: Kate Hallahan, Joe Carlisle, 
Matt Washington; and it includes An-
gela Ohm, Sarah Puro, Becky Salay, 
Jenny Neuscheler, and Gladys Barcena 
at the subcommittee, as well as Laura 
Thrift, Kate Roetzer, Sean Maxwell, 
and Nora Blalock from my own staff. A 
hearty thanks to all of you. 
Mr. Chairman, in closing, this year’s 
T-HUD will make forward-looking in-
vestments in our housing and transpor-
tation infrastructure while bolstering 
safety and uplifting vulnerable popu-
lations. It will benefit communities 
across America and lay a strong foun-
dation for economic growth and resil-
iency. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART), the ranking 
member of the Transportation, and 
Housing and Urban Development Sub-
committee. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I 
rise in opposition to the bill in its cur-
rent form but there are some really 
good things in this legislation, and I 
will talk about why I can’t support it 
at this time. 
But first, I thank my dear friend, 
Chairman PRICE, for his work on the T- 
HUD portion of the bill, and, most im-
portantly, as the chairwoman said, for 
his lifetime of honorable service to this 
country. 
I know that the committee and Con-
gress will miss Mr. PRICE. He has been, 
frankly, a privilege to work with. Not 
that we don’t have disagreements, but 
we always work through those dis-
agreements in a respectful, open proc-
ess. 
Evidence of his life and his service 
can be found in this bill as well as 
other past T-HUD bills. One example, 
Mr. Chairman, is the manufactured 
housing initiative that will, frankly, 
help revitalize communities across the 
Nation. Chairman PRICE
listened to 
stakeholders and developed this inno-
vative program with his characteristic 
deep understanding of policy. 
I have said—and I know he doesn’t 
feel it is a negative thing, on the con-
trary, I say it with great compliment— 
that he is a total policy wand, Mr. 
Chairman. And this is one of those 
areas where you see his policy involve-
ment. 
Some of you may not know that the 
Committee on Appropriations unani-
mously voted to name this efficiently 
the Preservation and Reinvestment 
Initiative for Community Enhance-
ment, PRICE, after Chairman PRICE. 
And I thank the chairman for including 
the funding that he did for port infra-
structure. I would also mention that he 
and I, and the entire T-HUD Com-
mittee, have always made safety a pri-
ority, and this bill continues in that 
tradition. 
The bill modernizes air traffic con-
trol systems to make sure that they 
are the safest in the world, as well as it 
makes progress in road and rail safety. 
We share a priority of supporting 
American innovation, whether it is 
automated vehicles to unmanned air-
craft to commercial space, this bill 
makes key investments in those areas 
as well. And it provides over $3 billion 
above last year, just to maintain 
HUD’s current rental assistance pro-
grams. And that is something that, ob-
viously, we all support, but I want to 
mention that those are things that 
once we do, we have to continue to 
fund every single year. Obviously, I 
support renewing this assistance, espe-
cially to the elderly, our disabled, and 
our veterans. 
Again, much of the HUD spending in 
this bill will create new liabilities for 
future years. For example, the bill ex-
pands Section 8—a program that obvi-
ously we all know about—by $1.1 bil-
lion. 
This new spending would, in essence, 
require several billion dollars for re-
newals in future years. So, in essence, 
it becomes a de facto mandatory re-
quirement which creates many, many 
issues. 
b 1400 
Let me be clear. I cannot support the 
bill at its current spending level. The 
bill was written under unrealistic top- 
line numbers, set by the majority. As a 
result, this bill has an overall increase 
of 12 percent above last year, which is, 
again, not acceptable. Inflation is at a 
40-year high. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. PHILLIPS). 
The time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, infla-
tion is at a 40-year high. Contrary to 
what some say, we cannot address in-
flation by spending more money—by 
continuing to spend more and more 
money. Instead, we need an agreement 
that reduces excessive spending that 
balances defense and nondefense spend-
ing, and, again, removes all of the con-
troversial riders. 
Once that happens, Mr. Chair, I am 
confident that we will be able to reach 
an agreement that this House and the 
majority and the minority can live 
with. 
Again, I thank Chairman PRICE for 
his leadership, his friendship, and open-
ness. He will be missed. I would be re-
miss if I didn’t thank the chairwoman

and the ranking member of the full 
committee for their leadership. 
I am confident that we will eventu-
ally be able to have numbers that we 
can live with and have a bipartisan 
bill, but until then, I have to oppose 
the bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. BISHOP), the chairman of the 
Agriculture, Rural Development, Food 
and Drug Administration, and Related 
Agencies Subcommittee. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I 
rise in support of H.R. 8294. As chair-
man of the Agriculture, Rural Develop-
ment, Food and Drug Administration, 
and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I 
am pleased to highlight the national 
priorities funded in our division. 
The impact of the agriculture divi-
sion is far-reaching and it touches the 
lives of every single American. We all 
eat the food, rely on the medicine and 
the medical devices, and wear products 
made from fibers, such as cotton, that 
are made possible by this bill. 
Our fiscal year 2023 allocation is $27.2 
billion, which is $2 billion over the fis-
cal year 2022 bill. The bill provides $4.2 
billion for Rural Development initia-
tives, including more than $560 million 
for broadband expansion to provide 
economic development opportunities 
and improved education and healthcare 
services. The bill continues important 
funding for the Community Facilities 
Program 
that 
supports 
everything 
from libraries and fire stations to 
childcare centers and nursing homes. 
Our bill fully funds the SNAP, WIC, 
and Child Nutrition programs. It con-
tinues to enhance fruit and vegetable 
benefits for women and children and 
provides 
additional 
protections 
for 
SNAP recipients. We have record-high 
funding for the Food for Peace pro-
gram, $1.8 billion, and $265 million for 
the McGovern-Dole program, critically 
needed in light of the global food crisis 
that has worsened following the Rus-
sian invasion of Ukraine. 
The bill provides $3.8 billion for agri-
culture 
research, 
which 
helps 
the 
United States produce the most abun-
dant and affordable food in the world, 
and provides $3.1 billion in farm and 
conservation programs, which includes 
funding to address the impacts of cli-
mate change. 
The Food and Drug Administration is 
funded at $3.6 billion in discretionary 
funding. There are important increases 
to help combat the opioid crisis, sup-
port unannounced inspections of for-
eign drug manufacturing facilities, and 
ensure the safety of infant formula. 
Finally, the bill provides funding for 
134 Community Project Funding re-
quests for members, totaling over $191 
million. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. I thank the ranking 
member, Dr. HARRIS, and his staff for 
helping produce this bill. I thank my 
personal staff and the subcommittee 
staff for their extraordinary work on 
the bill. Of course, I thank Chair-
woman DELAURO and Ranking Member 
GRANGER, as well as the majority and 
minority staffs of the full committee. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 6 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JOYCE), the ranking member of 
the Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies Subcommittee. 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 8294. 
Before I get into the details of the In-
terior-Environment section of the bill, 
I thank Chairwoman DELAURO
and 
Ranking Member GRANGER
for their 
leadership on the Appropriations Com-
mittee. 
I also extend my sincere thanks to 
CHELLIE PINGREE, the chair of the Inte-
rior, Environment, and Related Agen-
cies Subcommittee. Chair PINGREE has 
been a fair leader, and I appreciate the 
work she has done on the many bipar-
tisan priorities in the Interior bill, and 
to her staff for their tireless efforts. 
The Interior bill provides funding for 
many important and critical programs 
that help conserve and protect our Na-
tion’s most critical natural, cultural, 
and environmental resources. More 
than that, it makes investments that 
matter to communities, businesses, 
and industries across the country. 
The bill provides strong support for 
our National Parks, helps fight cata-
strophic wildfires, addresses our aging 
infrastructure, and fully funds the Pay-
ment in Lieu of Taxes, or PILT pro-
gram. 
I am grateful for my home district in 
Ohio that the bill provides increased 
funding for the Great Lakes Restora-
tion Initiative. The GLRI funding is 
critical in our work to restore and pro-
tect the lakes for future generations. 
Finally, I am pleased the bill ad-
vances longstanding efforts to increase 
the Federal commitment to honor our 
treaties and trust responsibilities with 
the American Indians and Alaskan Na-
tives by providing a $12.6 billion invest-
ment in Indian Country; and a new pro-
vision 
that 
will 
help 
ensure 
sov-
ereignty of Tribal laws. 
Unfortunately, while I am supportive 
of many of the bipartisan components 
of the bill, I am unable to support it 
today given serious spending and pol-
icy concerns. 
First and foremost, the bill fails to 
recognize the situation the country is 
now in and reverse this administra-
tion’s assault on conventional energy 
production. 
It eliminates longstanding, bipar-
tisan provisions and adds new, con-
troversial policy riders that would 
weaken U.S. energy and mineral secu-
rity by limiting domestic development 
of these and other natural resources. 
Given the rising energy costs and un-
precedented prices we are seeing at the 
gas pump, it is now more important 
than ever that we continue to support 
our all-of-the-above energy strategy. 
New provisions would prevent and 
disincentivize 
domestic 
production, 
only making us more dependent on our 
adversaries. Simply put, these provi-
sions undermine the American energy 
sector and fail to put American indus-
tries and the American people first. 
Similar riders were dropped from the 
final conference agreement last year, 
and the same must be done again be-
fore this bill can be signed into law. 
We must also address the spending in 
this bill before we can reach a final 
agreement. With a top-line increase of 
nearly $7 billion in double-digit in-
creases across many of the agencies, 
the spending is simply irresponsible in 
the absence of a broader, fiscally re-
sponsible Federal budget. 
With record-high inflation under this 
administration, now is the time to 
limit spending. The Federal Govern-
ment must make the tough choices to 
live within its means and work to rein 
in Federal spending to protect families 
from inflationary pressures and future 
generations from crippling debt. 
It is the combination of these fund-
ing and policy reasons that I cannot 
support the bill at this time. 
I look forward to supporting amend-
ments to improve H.R. 8294, including 
one to remove a harmful rider on tro-
phy permits, and my amendment to 
add limits on the burdensome SEC cli-
mate rule. 
The SEC, which has no mandate to 
regulate carbon emissions, wants pub-
lic companies to disclose new climate- 
related information, including green-
house gas emissions. These require-
ments have already lessened investor 
enthusiasm for domestic drilling and 
oil protection. 
At the same time, my friends on the 
other side of the aisle ask our energy 
producers to expand capacity—which, 
of course, requires investment. 
Make no mistake, this rule will im-
pact businesses of all kinds—small and 
large, public and private, energy and 
non-energy. 
Under this rule, many public compa-
nies will be required to disclose not 
only their greenhouse gas emissions, 
but also the emissions of businesses up-
stream and downstream in their value 
chain. 
Congress created the SEC to protect 
investors, maintain fair, orderly, and 
efficient markets, and facilitate cap-
ital formation—not to set climate pol-
icy. 
Unfortunately, the agency has lost 
its focus. I look forward to the debate 
on these key issues across all our ap-
propriations bills and am committed to 
working with Chair PINGREE and our 
colleagues as the fiscal year 2023 proc-
ess moves forward to craft legislation 
that can receive bipartisan support. 
Until then, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this package. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the distinguished 
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chair, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding. I thank her 
for her unsurpassed leadership as chair 
of the Appropriations Committee, for

reflecting the values of our country, 
based on her leadership in terms of lis-
tening to the American people and 
meeting their kitchen-table needs, and, 
again, advancing us into the future. 
We said about many of these initia-
tives: When we pass this, we will be 
making history. Not only that, we will 
be making progress, thanks to the 
leadership 
of 
Chairwoman 
ROSA 
DELAURO, chair of the committee. It is 
a source of great joy to me because I 
served on the committee with her, saw 
her leadership then and now as chair. 
Let me just describe—people say: 
What is a minibus? 
A minibus is a minibus. It is not an 
omnibus. Sometimes we would have a 
bill that contained all of the appropria-
tions bills. Omni, all. Omnibus. This is 
a minibus, which contains six of the 
bills—six very important pieces of leg-
islation—and hopefully we will move 
soon to pass the others. 
With these bills, our Democratic ma-
jority advances many of our Nation’s 
cherished principles and priorities, in-
cluding job creation, expanding oppor-
tunity, and protecting health and well- 
being. 
Let us salute the masterful Chair-
woman ROSA DELAURO, a maestro of 
the appropriations process, who is a 
constant source of inspiration, leader-
ship, and strategic thinking for all of 
us. 
I also thank our cardinals for their 
hard work in carefully crafting each of 
these six very important bills con-
tained in this minibus. You are called a 
cardinal if you rise to be a chair of one 
of the subcommittees of Appropria-
tions. It is a great honor. 
Mr. Chair, I do want to acknowledge 
the work of Chairman SANFORD BISHOP. 
We just heard from him about food, ag-
riculture, rural development, et cetera. 
Chairwoman MARCY KAPTUR, Energy 
and Water Development. 
Chairman MIKE QUIGLEY, Financial 
Services and General Government. 
Chairwoman CHELLIE PINGREE, Inte-
rior-Environment. 
Chairwoman 
DEBBIE
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ, Military Construction and 
Veterans Affairs. 
Chairman DAVID
PRICE, Transpor-
tation, and Housing and Urban Devel-
opment. Mr. PRICE will be leaving us at 
the end of this term, but his legacy will 
be with our country for a long time to 
come. 
Mr. Chair, I thank our colleague on 
the other side of the aisle for acknowl-
edging Mr. PRICE’s work, and naming a 
portion of the Transportation, and 
Housing and Urban Development bill in 
his name. Mr. DIAZ-BALART, I thank 
you for that beautiful recognition of 
Chairman PRICE. He certainly is re-
vered on our side of the aisle, and we 
appreciate the bipartisan recognition 
of his leadership. 
Mr. Chair, the House’s Appropria-
tions minibus will have an immediate 
impact on people’s lives because it puts 
working families first. 
This package defends health and 
well-being: improving the safety and 
security of our Nation’s food supply. A 
vote for this bill is a vote for the safety 
of our Nation’s food supply. A vote 
against it is a vote against the safety 
of our Nation’s food supply. 
The bill supports the WIC program— 
Women, Infants, and Children—food 
stamps, and other initiatives that keep 
our families fed. 
This package strengthens economic 
security with strong investments to ex-
pand access to safe, affordable hous-
ing—thank you, Mr. PRICE—support 
small business growth, and protect the 
interests of American consumers. 
In doing so, these bills advance Presi-
dent Biden’s commitment to putting 
justice and equity front and center, 
moving to close economic disparities 
weighing heaviest on communities of 
color and low-income families. 
At the same time, this package will 
further power Democrats’ mission to 
rebuild our Nation while reinvigorating 
the middle class. 
Our bipartisan infrastructure law 
that was bipartisan and passed last 
year was a monumental step forward. 
Now, this legislation builds on that bi-
partisan progress: creating good-paying 
American 
jobs, 
rehabilitating 
our 
crumbling 
infrastructure; 
securing 
critical funding for roads, bridges, 
ports and rail, transit and aviation, 
and more; and improving the strength 
and resilience of our water systems. 
This is a health issue in addition to a 
commerce issue. These investments lay 
a crucial economic foundation, better 
equipping our Nation to compete and 
win in the 21st century economy. 
This package is also about protecting 
and preserving our planet—a responsi-
bility we owe our children and grand-
children and future generations. 
The investments in this legislation, 
Mr. Chair, are another strong step to-
ward independent, affordable, clean en-
ergy jobs for the future: whether spur-
ring innovation in new, sustainable 
technologies; 
strengthening 
commu-
nity resilience to mitigate climate dis-
aster; or conserving our cherished pub-
lic lands. 
Anyone who watches the news these 
days sees the impact on the climate 
crisis on our planet. 
b 1415 
Throughout Europe, there are record 
heat waves. In our own country, we 
have had scores of our hottest record 
days, scores of them in our own coun-
try. The climate crisis is a real one. 
There is a short fuse on it. We must 
act. We cannot ignore the signs or the 
governance and the protections that go 
with it. 
Preserving clean air and clean water 
for our children is a public health 
issue. The air they breathe and the 
water they drink is an immediate 
health issue. It is an economic neces-
sity, creating good-paying jobs in the 
industries of the future while staving 
off catastrophic costs of inaction. 
A matter of national security is pre-
venting violent conflicts over resources 
and habitat. You have droughts; you 
have rising sea levels; you have en-
croachment of deserts; and you have 
change in the thermal management of 
the planet, Mr. Chair. All of this con-
tributes to competition for habitats 
and resources, and our National Secu-
rity Advisors tell us that that can be a 
cause of conflict, in addition to the toll 
it takes on people. 
For many of us, it is a moral issue if 
you believe as I do that this is God’s 
creation and that we have a moral re-
sponsibility to be good stewards of it. 
That is one purpose. But if you don’t 
share that view, you do understand 
that we have a moral responsibility to 
our children to pass on the planet in a 
responsible way for future generations. 
This is one of the Democratic major-
ity’s top priorities, and we will never 
stop fighting for the climate action 
that we need. 
Finally, and importantly—one of my 
favorite subjects—this package honors 
our Nation’s sacred duty to our vet-
erans, their families, and their care-
givers. A vote for this bill is a vote for 
our veterans, their families, and their 
caregivers with robust support for vet-
erans’ healthcare, which covers more 
than 7 million patients, with more re-
sources to build essential VA infra-
structure, and with increased funding 
to address mental health, substance 
abuse disorder, the scourge of veteran 
homelessness, and much more. 
As we do so, we honor the truth when 
the military says that, on the battle-
field, we leave no soldier behind, and 
when they come home, we leave no vet-
eran behind. 
Mr. Chair, Democrats believe that 
governance is a powerful force for good 
when we invest in what we value most 
as a nation—protection of our people, 
their health, their safety, the planet, 
the air they breathe, the water they 
drink, and security for our country. 
Today, our Democratic majority ad-
vances appropriations legislation that 
furthers that mission with funding 
that will meet the needs of American 
families in every corner of our country, 
and we take an important step to ad-
vance President Biden’s inspiring vi-
sion of building a better America for 
all with liberty and equity for all. 
Mr. Chair, I urge a strong bipartisan 
vote for this minibus package. I salute 
our cardinals for their great leadership, 
and I again pay homage to the chair of 
the committee, Madam Chair ROSA 
DELAURO, for her extraordinary leader-
ship. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HARRIS), who is the acting 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chair, I thank 
Ranking Member GRANGER for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 
8294, which includes the FY23 Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Food and

Drug 
Administration, 
and 
Related 
Agencies appropriations bill. 
First, I thank Chair DELAURO and 
Ranking Member GRANGER
for their 
leadership 
in 
moving 
these 
bills 
through the appropriations process. I 
also thank the Agriculture, Rural De-
velopment, Food and Drug Administra-
tion, 
and 
Related 
Agencies 
Sub-
committee chairman, Mr. BISHOP, for 
his leadership in crafting a bill that 
funds a number of programs with broad 
bipartisan 
support, 
such 
as 
rural 
broadband programs, critical ag re-
search programs, and protections to 
ensure we have safe food, drugs, and 
medical devices. 
While there are many things to like 
about this bill, the total discretionary 
spending level of $27.2 billion, or an 8 
percent increase over the previous 
year’s funding, does not acknowledge 
the economic reality that our Nation 
faces. 
A stunning 88 percent of Americans 
believe our country is on the wrong 
track, according to a recent poll by the 
Monmouth University Polling Insti-
tute. That is what Americans are talk-
ing about around their kitchen tables. 
Just last week, inflation jumped 
again to a 40-year high of 9.1 percent. 
We can’t keep ignoring this situation. 
Americans have figured out that more 
government spending only ends in 
higher prices for the American people 
and adds to the inflation problem cre-
ated by this Congress and the Biden ad-
ministration’s reckless and immoral 
spending included in this minibus. 
In this vein, this division of the mini-
bus provides unsustainable funding in-
creases across the board, most notably 
for the Food and Drug Administration, 
which would receive an overwhelming 
and unnecessary 10 percent increase. A 
lot of American families wish they 
were getting a 10 percent increase in 
their paychecks. Based on how the 
FDA has handled the infant formula 
crisis, it is clear that strong leadership 
is needed at the FDA, not this unneces-
sary increase in funding. 
The bill also includes increased bene-
fits for the WIC program, a great pro-
gram, but those increased benefits were 
intended to be a temporary, one-time 
increase included in the American Res-
cue Plan. I understand the importance 
of making sure WIC participants have 
access to fruits and vegetables. How-
ever, this bill is taking a temporary in-
crease in response to COVID and in-
cluding it in the regular, ongoing pro-
gram as if to make these increased ben-
efits permanent without regard to the 
inflationary pressures of out-of-control 
government spending that is already 
squeezing taxpayers. 
I am also extremely concerned about 
providing the administration with un-
limited spending authority for the Sup-
plemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram, or SNAP, at the end of the next 
fiscal year. The administration claims 
this authority is needed for an unex-
pected increase in SNAP participation, 
but the President continues to tout 
record-low unemployment rates, which 
should translate into a decrease in 
SNAP participation. Furthermore, the 
program has a reserve fund totaling up 
to $9 billion already to address unex-
pected participation increases should 
they unexpectedly occur, so providing 
USDA with a blank check is just sim-
ply irresponsible. 
In times like these, as stewards of 
taxpayer dollars, Congress must make 
tough decisions in the greater interest 
of the American people. While I sup-
port a number of programs in the bill, 
I cannot support the bill at this 
unsustainable spending level. 
This bill touches the lives of every 
American, and I hope we can find com-
mon ground to support America’s farm-
ers, ranchers, and rural communities. 
As this process moves forward, I am 
committed to working with Chairman 
BISHOP, Chair DELAURO, Ranking Mem-
ber GRANGER, and the rest of our col-
leagues to resolve these differences. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ), 
who is the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Military Construction, Veterans Af-
fairs, and Related Agencies. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 8294, the appropriations minibus 
for fiscal year 2023. 
I really want to start out my re-
marks, Mr. Chair, by saying what a joy 
it is to work with my counterpart, 
Judge Carter, as our ranking member. 
He and I really worked hand in glove. 
We are personal friends, and we worked 
very closely together, along with the 
ranking member, Ms. GRANGER, and 
Ms. DELAURO. In a very divisive proc-
ess, it is really nice to have met and 
befriended someone like Judge Carter. 
I wish him the best. 
By now, we all know President 
Biden’s wise words: ‘‘Don’t tell me 
what you value. Show me your budget, 
and I will tell you what you value.’’ 
This minibus truly reflects our val-
ues, the values of promoting progress 
and opportunity, and protecting those 
who most need it. That is why I take 
tremendous pride in this bill as the 
Military Construction, Veterans Af-
fairs, 
and 
Related 
Agencies 
Sub-
committee chair. It is a statement of 
principled values, especially with its 
strong support for veterans, service-
members, and their families. 
We steer $15.1 billion to critical mili-
tary infrastructure, such as new bar-
racks and child development centers, 
and focus on ensuring that family 
housing is clear of mold, lead, and con-
taminants. We invest in climate and 
energy resilience projects and devote 
$200 million to PFAS contamination 
cleanup at closed installations. 
We provide more to NATO security 
and support the infrastructure nec-
essary for wartime, peace, and deter-
rence operations by bolstering require-
ments to confront Russian aggression 
and protect our European allies. 
This bill improves the quality of life 
on military installations and honors 
servicemembers and their families once 
they leave these facilities by ensuring 
veterans receive the care and support 
they earned. We do it by providing the 
Department of Veterans Affairs with 
$135 billion to boost medical research 
and fully fund medical care. We make 
major investments in women’s health, 
mental health, suicide prevention, and 
homelessness programs, and we tackle 
the disability claims backlog. 
The bill also tackles two issues close 
to my and many Members’ hearts. It 
includes a prohibition on the painful 
scientific testing on dogs and cats, and 
it also makes permanent VA’s author-
ity to offer a full range of fertility 
treatment. That means expanding eli-
gibility to include partners in addition 
to spouses, removing discrimination 
against same-sex couples, and allowing 
the use of donated sperm and eggs in 
IVF. 
Outside of MILCON-VA, the Energy 
and Water bill appropriates a record 
$407 million for Everglades restoration. 
The river of grass is the lifeblood of 
south Florida, and the chance to make 
this level of historic progress is hugely 
significant toward our restoration ef-
forts. 
I am proud that this bill makes it a 
priority to reduce the number of inju-
ries and deaths associated with pools 
and spas. We will save lives by increas-
ing funding by pool safety grants to 
$2.5 million. Drowning poses a signifi-
cant public health risk to our Nation’s 
children, remaining the number one 
cause of unintentional death for chil-
dren younger than 5 years old in this 
country. 
Additionally, the Interior bill re-
flects the importance of protecting our 
coastlines from greedy oil companies 
by prohibiting the Department of the 
Interior from conducting offshore oil 
and gas leasing activities along Flor-
ida’s coasts. 
It also funds valuable community 
projects, and in my district, that 
means critical infrastructure, clean 
transit, and improved water quality in 
Hollywood, Southwest Ranches, and 
Sunrise. 
Finally, our values are reflected by 
how Congress confronts the dramatic 
rise in highway fatalities. New data 
shows we lost ground in our fight to 
end drunk driving, the leading cause of 
highway deaths. But this bill directs 
the DOT to take immediate steps to 
save lives by requiring the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
to issue a rule requiring all new pas-
senger vehicles to be equipped with ad-
vanced alcohol monitoring technology. 
This technology will save an estimated 
9,400 lives a year. For reference, air-
bags save 3,000 lives annually. Accord-
ing to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, 
this may be the most significant motor 
vehicle safety rulemaking ever under-
taken in terms of the lives it can save.

We have a chance to enhance, im-
prove, and save millions of lives by 
passing this minibus, and I respectfully 
urge my colleagues to support these 
cherished American values. 
Lastly, Mr. Chair, I thank my incred-
ible staff for all the work that they did 
to bring this remarkable piece of legis-
lation to the floor. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE), who is a member of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Chair, it is with sad-
ness that I come to the floor to speak 
against this measure. 
We had opportunities in the Appro-
priations Committee to work across 
the aisle to address the concerns of the 
minority and to fund the priorities of 
this country and its people. Unfortu-
nately, with a 40-year high in inflation, 
CPI rising to 9.1 percent in June, $30 
trillion in debt, and the CBO recently 
predicting $1.6 trillion in deficits over 
the next decade, business as usual can 
no longer be contemplated. 
We must take action to secure the fi-
nancial stability of this country for the 
future, for our children, for their chil-
dren, and for future generations. We 
have to return to fiscal sanity through 
these appropriations bills to rein in in-
flation and rescue this economy. 
Transportation-Housing and Urban 
Development has an increase of more 
than 12 percent; Agriculture an in-
crease of 8 percent; Financial Services 
and General Government an increase of 
17 percent over FY22; Interior, 18 per-
cent increase; MILCON, more than 10 
percent above 2022. 
All of these bills contain important 
priorities, but they also contain exces-
sive amounts of waste and liberal pri-
orities that are not in keeping with the 
priorities of the American people, so I 
urge their defeat. 
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Texas for her hard work in trying 
to get our priorities considered. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
to ensure that fiscal responsibility is 
the watchword of the day and that the 
American people have their tax dollars 
looked after by the Appropriations 
Committee. 
b 1430 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. QUIGLEY), the chairman of 
the Financial Services and General 
Government Subcommittee. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, as the 
chairman of the Financial Services and 
General Government Subcommittee, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
FY23 Financial Services and General 
Government Appropriations bill. 
First, I thank the staff on both sides 
for their efforts in drafting this bill 
and preparing it to come to the House 
floor. 
I also want to thank my colleague, 
the ranking member, Mr. WOMACK, for 
his hard work and collaboration on this 
bill. He has been thoughtful in his 
input and, frankly, a pleasure to work 
with. 
The FSGG bill includes $29.8 billion 
in funding, an increase of $4.3 billion 
over last year. 
For Treasury, the bill includes $15.6 
billion, $1.3 billion above last year. 
Within that level, there is $336 million 
for CDFIs, an increase of $41 million. 
The IRS gets $13.6 billion, an increase 
of $1 billion over the 2022 level. 
For ONDCP, $462 million, including 
$300 million for the High Intensity 
Drug Trafficking Areas program and 
$110 million for the Drug-Free Commu-
nities Program. 
For the Judiciary, $8.6 billion, within 
this amount, $128 million is targeted 
for judiciary security, cybersecurity, 
and 
information 
technology 
mod-
ernization. For the Supreme Court, 
$143 million, $30 million above last 
year, included in this increase is fund-
ing to provide for enhanced security 
services. 
For the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, $166.3 million, $27.3 mil-
lion above last year, including $2.5 mil-
lion for Pool Safety Grants. 
For Election Security Grants, $400 
million, an increase of $325 million 
above last year. These grants will help 
State and local governments protect 
our democracy through fair and secure 
elections. 
For the GSA, $1.1 billion over last 
year, including $500 million for a new 
FBI headquarters. Also included, $100 
million for both the Electric Vehicle 
Fund and the Technology Moderniza-
tion Fund. 
For SBA, $1.1 billion, $77 million 
above last year. This fund includes $326 
million for the Entrepreneurial Devel-
opment Programs. 
We have solid increases for the Fed-
eral Communications Commission, Se-
curities and Exchange Commission, 
OPM, the Archives, and the Federal 
Trade Commission. 
The bill is silent on the civilian pay 
increase, allowing the proposed 4.6 per-
cent increase to take effect. 
We removed harmful riders to the 
bill, including the Hyde restrictions, 
three ‘‘dark money’’ riders, and the 
D.C. cannabis rider. 
We include language making Dream-
ers eligible for Federal employment. 
And finally, I am proud this bill was 
able to include 98 percent of Members’ 
Community Project Funding requests, 
including from Democrats and Repub-
licans. This funding will go directly to 
important projects in Members’ dis-
tricts connected with the SBA, GSA, 
and the National Archives. 
I urge all Members to support the 
bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, as I 
said before, the bills before us do not 
reflect the economic realities we face. 
At a time of record-high inflation, the 
Federal Government should be reduc-
ing not increasing spending. The prior-
ities included in these bills are simply 
out of touch with what the American 
people need. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Chairman, first, let me just say, 
I thank the ranking member (Ms. 
GRANGER) for her commitment and her 
dedication to the Appropriations Com-
mittee and the process, a place where 
she has spent a number of years in the 
various subcommittees, and it is an 
honor to work with her in this effort. 
I applaud the funding bills that help 
the middle class, working families, and 
small businesses, in what are desperate 
times. And that is what these bills do 
is to provide that kind of assistance to 
these families. I am proud to support 
these bills. 
I listened to my colleagues about in-
flation, what they failed to mention, 
which has been really demonstrated, is 
that we are looking at oil companies 
who have consolidated; and what they 
are doing is buying back their stock, 
instead of lowering the price of gas. 
They now have 26 million acres of 
Federal land in which they could deal 
with extraction, and they have the per-
mits, but they refuse to do it. They are 
in the business of buying back their 
stock, thereby increasing inflation by 
keeping gas prices high. 
We have the same situation in the 
meat industry with meat, poultry, and 
pork, which is continuing to raise the 
price because of the consolidation. 
I would just mention one other thing. 
In the recommendations to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this package, it just is interesting 
to look at what my colleagues view as 
not wanting to do; that is, to provide 
an increase for the Internal Revenue 
Service. Why is that money provided to 
the IRS? It is really to look at those 
corporations who are not paying their 
fair share of taxes. 
So they are not much interested in 
seeing them pay their fair share of 
taxes, or the wealthiest of individuals 
who don’t pay their fair share of taxes. 
They also do not want to provide 
money for women, infants, and chil-
dren for food. They don’t want to pro-
vide money for food security, for people 
who are on the food stamp program. 
They don’t want to do anything for 
domestic manufacturing on clean en-
ergy, which could lower the cost of en-
ergy. So, there is a bit of disingenuous-
ness on what we are doing with the 
cost. 
I am proud to support these bills. I 
urge my colleagues to support the six- 
bill appropriations package, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I rise to support 
the Fiscal Year 2023 Interior, Environment, 
and Related Agencies appropriations bill. 
I thank Ranking Member JOYCE for his col-
laboration and partnership through this proc-
ess, and I am grateful for the leadership of 
Chairwoman DELAURO, and Ranking Member 
GRANGER. 
The fiscal year 2023 Interior, Environment 
and Related Agencies bill provides a total of 
$44.8 billion dollars. This is an increase of

$6.8 billion dollars over last year’s enacted 
level, which is an 18 percent increase. Last 
year, we made unprecedented investments to 
fight the climate crisis, return science as the 
foundation for decision-making, dedicate the 
highest level of federal funding to the arts and 
humanities ever, and continue our commit-
ment to tribal nations. 
This bill continues to build on those suc-
cesses. Through the investments made in this 
bill, our country will be better positioned to 
confront the climate crisis. Just last month, we 
witnessed Yellowstone, America’s first national 
park, experience devastating flooding that trig-
gered mudslides, resulting in its emergency 
closure and leaving damage that will take 
years to rebuild. Only weeks later, a destruc-
tive wildfire threatened to destroy the giant se-
quoias of Yosemite National Park. These trag-
edies underscored how vulnerable our eco-
systems and species are to the impacts of cli-
mate change. 
That is why the investments in this bill, such 
as the 15 percent increase for the land man-
agement agencies, will be meaningful for cli-
mate adaptation and resiliency efforts on our 
public lands. The bill also invests in renewable 
energy, both on and offshore, to provide op-
portunities for growth in this sector—creating 
good paying American jobs. And we make his-
toric investments for science and environ-
mental protection, providing the funding nec-
essary to build a strong EPA. 
In addition to these critical investments to 
protect our natural resources, the bill also in-
cludes strong funding for cultural resources by 
fostering the Arts and Humanities. The bill pro-
vides $414 million for both the National En-
dowment for the Arts and the National Endow-
ment for the Humanities. These funds benefit 
all of our districts and are a positive tool for 
economic development, education, and com-
munity building. 
And finally, this bill supports Native Amer-
ican families by investing in a strong and resil-
ient Indian Country, including through edu-
cation and health care programs. 
This is a strong bill. Through its invest-
ments, the Interior bill takes a whole-of-gov-
ernment approach to securing a safe and hab-

vided by section 9104 of such title as may be nec-
essary in carrying out the programs set forth in 
the budget for such corporation or agency ex-
cept as hereinafter provided: Provided, That col-
lections of these corporations and agencies may

mitments only to the extent expressly provided 
for in an appropriations Act (unless such loans

surance or guaranty operations of these cor-
porations, or where loans or mortgage purchases 
are necessary to protect the financial interest of 
the United States Government.’’. 
SEC. 205. Unless otherwise provided for in this 
Act or through a reprogramming of funds, no

cess of amounts set forth in the budget estimates

any, associated with one or more multifamily 
housing project or projects to another multi-
family housing project or projects. 
(b) PHASED TRANSFERS.—Transfers of project- 
based assistance under this section may be done 
in phases to accommodate the financing and 
other requirements related to rehabilitating or 
constructing the project or projects to which the 
assistance is transferred, to ensure that such 
project or projects meet the standards under 
subsection (c). 
(c) The transfer authorized in subsection (a) is 
subject to the following conditions: 
(1) NUMBER AND BEDROOM SIZE OF UNITS.— 
(A) For occupied units in the transferring 
project: The number of low-income and very 
low-income units and the configuration (i.e., 
bedroom size) provided by the transferring 
project shall be no less than when transferred to 
the receiving project or projects and the net dol-
lar amount of Federal assistance provided to the 
transferring project shall remain the same in the 
receiving project or projects. 
(B) For unoccupied units in the transferring 
project: The Secretary may authorize a reduc-
tion in the number of dwelling units in the re-
ceiving project or projects to allow for a recon-
figuration of bedroom sizes to meet current mar-
ket demands, as determined by the Secretary 
and provided there is no increase in the project- 
based assistance budget authority. 
(2) The transferring project shall, as deter-
mined by the Secretary, be either physically ob-
solete or economically nonviable, or be reason-
ably expected to become economically nonviable 
when complying with state or Federal require-
ments for community integration and reduced 
concentration of individuals with disabilities.

or exceed applicable physical standards estab-
lished by the Secretary.

(6) The Secretary determines that this transfer 
is in the best interest of the tenants. 
(7) If either the transferring project or the re-
ceiving project or projects meets the condition 
specified in subsection (d)(2)(A), any lien on the 
receiving project resulting from additional fi-
nancing obtained by the owner shall be subordi-
nate to any FHA-insured mortgage lien trans-
ferred to, or placed on, such project by the Sec-
retary, except that the Secretary may waive this 
requirement upon determination that such a 
waiver is necessary to facilitate the financing of 
acquisition, construction, and/or rehabilitation 
of the receiving project or projects. 
(8) If the transferring project meets the re-
quirements of subsection (d)(2), the owner or 
mortgagor of the receiving project or projects 
shall execute and record either a continuation 
of the existing use agreement or a new use 
agreement for the project where, in either case, 
any use restrictions in such agreement are of no 
lesser duration than the existing use restric-
tions. 
(9) The transfer does not increase the cost (as 
defined in section 502 of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 661a)) of any FHA- 
insured mortgage, except to the extent that ap-
propriations are provided in advance for the 
amount of any such increased cost.

July 19, 2022 
SEC. 210. The funds made available for Native 
Alaskans under paragraph (1) under the head-
ing ‘‘Native American Programs’’ in title II of 
this Act shall be allocated to the same Native 
Alaskan housing block grant recipients that re-
ceived funds in fiscal year 2005, and only such 
recipients shall be eligible to apply for funds 
made available under paragraph (2) of such 
heading. 
SEC. 211. Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, in fiscal year 2023, in managing and dis-
posing of any multifamily property that is 
owned or has a mortgage held by the Secretary 
of Housing and Urban Development, and during 
the process of foreclosure on any property with 
a contract for rental assistance payments under 
section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 
1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) or any other Federal pro-
grams, the Secretary shall maintain any rental 
assistance payments under section 8 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 and other 
programs that are attached to any dwelling 
units in the property. To the extent the Sec-
retary determines, in consultation with the ten-
ants and the local government that such a mul-
tifamily property owned or having a mortgage 
held by the Secretary is not feasible for contin-
ued rental assistance payments under such sec-
tion 8 or other programs, based on consideration 
of (1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating 
the property and all available Federal, State, 
and local resources, including rent adjustments 
under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted 
Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 
(in this section ‘‘MAHRAA’’) (42 U.S.C. 1437f 
note), and (2) environmental conditions that 
cannot be remedied in a cost-effective fashion, 
the Secretary may, in consultation with the ten-
ants of that property, contract for project-based 
rental assistance payments with an owner or 
owners of other existing housing properties, or 
provide other rental assistance. The Secretary 
shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that 
project-based contracts remain in effect prior to 
foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contrac-
tual abatement remedies to assist relocation of 
tenants for imminent major threats to health 
and safety after written notice to and informed 
consent of the affected tenants and use of other 
available remedies, such as partial abatements 
or receivership. After disposition of any multi-
family property described in this section, the 
contract and allowable rent levels on such prop-
erties shall be subject to the requirements under 
section 524 of MAHRAA. 
SEC. 212. Public housing agencies that own 
and operate 400 or fewer public housing units 
may elect to be exempt from any asset manage-
ment requirement imposed by the Secretary in 
connection with the operating fund rule: Pro-
vided, That an agency seeking a discontinuance 
of a reduction of subsidy under the operating 
fund formula shall not be exempt from asset 
management requirements. 
SEC. 213. With respect to the use of amounts 
provided in this Act and in future Acts for the 
operation, capital improvement, and manage-
ment of public housing as authorized by sections 
9(d) and 9(e) of the United States Housing Act 
of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d),(e)), the Secretary 
shall not impose any requirement or guideline 
relating to asset management that restricts or 
limits in any way the use of capital funds for 
central office costs pursuant to paragraph (1) or 
(2) of section 9(g) of the United States Housing 
Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)): Provided, 
That a public housing agency may not use cap-
ital funds authorized under section 9(d) for ac-
tivities that are eligible under section 9(e) for as-
sistance with amounts from the operating fund 
in excess of the amounts permitted under para-
graph (1) or (2) of section 9(g). 
SEC. 214. No official or employee of the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development 
shall be designated as an allotment holder un-
less the Office of the Chief Financial Officer has 
determined that such allotment holder has im-
plemented an adequate system of funds control 
and has received training in funds control pro-
cedures and directives. The Chief Financial Of-
ficer shall ensure that there is a trained allot-
ment holder for each HUD appropriation under 
the accounts ‘‘Executive Offices’’, ‘‘Administra-
tive Support Offices’’, ‘‘Program Offices’’, ‘‘Gov-
ernment National Mortgage Association—Guar-
antees of Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan 
Guarantee Program Account’’, and ‘‘Office of 
Inspector General’’ within the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. 
SEC. 215. The Secretary shall, for fiscal year 
2023, notify the public through the Federal Reg-
ister and other means, as determined appro-
priate, of the issuance of a notice of funding op-
portunity (NOFO) for any program or discre-
tionary fund administered by the Secretary that 
is to be competitively awarded. Notwithstanding 
any other provision of law, for fiscal year 2023, 
the Secretary may make the NOFO available 
only on the Internet at the appropriate Govern-
ment website or through other electronic media, 
as determined by the Secretary. 
SEC. 216. Payment of attorney fees in pro-
gram-related litigation shall be paid from the in-
dividual program office and Office of General 
Counsel salaries and expenses appropriations. 
SEC. 217. The Secretary is authorized to trans-
fer up to 10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is 
less, of funds appropriated for any office under 
the headings ‘‘Administrative Support Offices’’ 
or ‘‘Program Offices’’ to any other such office 
under such headings: Provided, That no appro-
priation for any such office under such head-
ings shall be increased or decreased by more 
than 10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less, 
without prior written approval of the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations: Provided 
further, That the Secretary shall provide notifi-
cation to such Committees 3 business days in ad-
vance of any such transfers under this section 
up to 10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less. 
SEC. 218. (a) Any entity receiving housing as-
sistance payments shall maintain decent, safe, 
and sanitary conditions, as determined by the 
Secretary, and comply with any standards 
under applicable State or local laws, rules, ordi-
nances, or regulations relating to the physical 
condition of any property covered under a hous-
ing assistance payment contract. 
(b) The Secretary shall take action under sub-
section (c) when a multifamily housing project 
with a contract under section 8 of the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) or a 
contract for similar project-based assistance— 
(1) receives a Uniform Physical Condition 
Standards (UPCS) score of 59 or less; or 
(2) fails to certify in writing to the Secretary 
within 3 days that all Exigent Health and Safe-
ty deficiencies identified by the inspector at the 
project have been corrected. 
Such requirements shall apply to insured and 
noninsured projects with assistance attached to 
the units under section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but shall 
not apply to such units assisted under section 
8(o)(13) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to 
public housing units assisted with capital or op-
erating funds under section 9 of the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g). 
(c)(1) Within 15 days of the issuance of the 
Real Estate Assessment Center (‘‘REAC’’) in-
spection, the Secretary shall provide the owner 
with a Notice of Default with a specified time-
table, determined by the Secretary, for cor-
recting all deficiencies. The Secretary shall pro-
vide a copy of the Notice of Default to the ten-
ants, the local government, any mortgagees, and 
any contract administrator. If the owner’s ap-
peal results in a UPCS score of 60 or above, the 
Secretary may withdraw the Notice of Default. 
(2) At the end of the time period for correcting 
all deficiencies specified in the Notice of De-
fault, if the owner fails to fully correct such de-
ficiencies, the Secretary shall take one or more 
of the following actions, and provide additional 
notice of those actions to the owner and the 
parties specified above— 
(A) require immediate replacement of project 
management with a management agent ap-
proved by the Secretary; 
(B) impose civil money penalties, which shall 
be used solely for the purpose of supporting safe 
and sanitary conditions at applicable properties, 
as designated by the Secretary, with priority 
given to the tenants of the property affected by 
the penalty; 
(C) abate the section 8 contract, including 
partial abatement, as determined by the Sec-
retary, until all deficiencies have been corrected; 
(D) pursue transfer of the project to an owner, 
approved by the Secretary under established 
procedures, who will be obligated to promptly 
make all required repairs and to accept renewal 
of the assistance contract if such renewal is of-
fered; 
(E) transfer the existing section 8 contract to 
another project or projects and owner or own-
ers; 
(F) pursue exclusionary sanctions, including 
suspensions or debarments from Federal pro-
grams; 
(G) seek judicial appointment of a receiver to 
manage the property and cure all project defi-
ciencies or seek a judicial order of specific per-
formance requiring the owner to cure all project 
deficiencies; 
(H) work with the owner, lender, or other re-
lated party to stabilize the property in an at-
tempt to preserve the property through compli-
ance, transfer of ownership, or an infusion of 
capital provided by a third-party that requires 
time to effectuate; or 
(I) take any other regulatory or contractual 
remedies available as deemed necessary and ap-
propriate by the Secretary. 
(d) The Secretary shall take appropriate steps 
to ensure that project-based contracts remain in 
effect, subject to the exercise of contractual 
abatement remedies to assist relocation of ten-
ants for major threats to health and safety after 
written notice to and informed consent of the 
affected tenants and use of other remedies set 
forth above. To the extent the Secretary deter-
mines, in consultation with the tenants and the 
local government, that the property is not fea-
sible for continued rental assistance payments 
under such section 8 or other programs, based 
on consideration of— 
(1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating 
the property and all available Federal, State, 
and local resources, including rent adjustments 
under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted 
Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 
(‘‘MAHRAA’’); and 
(2) environmental conditions that cannot be 
remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Sec-
retary may contract for project-based rental as-
sistance payments with an owner or owners of 
other existing housing properties, or provide 
other rental assistance. 
(e) The Secretary shall report semi-annually 
on all properties covered by this section that are 
assessed through the Real Estate Assessment 
Center and have UPCS physical inspection 
scores of less than 60 or have received an unsat-
isfactory management and occupancy review 
within the past 36 months. The report shall in-
clude— 
(1) identification of the property level enforce-
ment actions being taken to address such condi-
tions, including imposition of civil money pen-
alties and termination of subsidies, and identi-
fication of properties that have such conditions 
multiple times;

the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment is taking to protect tenants of such identi-
fied properties; and 
(3) any administrative or legislative rec-

such funding error in the next applicable for-
mula allocation cycle by (a) offsetting each such

mula allocation cycle) by the amount of any 
such funding error; and (b) reallocating any 
available balances that are attributable to the 
offset to the recipient or recipients that would 
have been allocated additional funds in the for-
mula allocation cycle in which any such error 
occurred (if such recipient or recipients are eli-

cable formula allocation cycle) in an amount 
proportionate to such recipient’s eligibility

ation to all Federal resources available to the 
recipient for the same grant purposes, the Sec-
retary determines that the offset in a next appli-
cable formula allocation cycle would critically 
impair the recipient’s ability to accomplish the 
purpose of the formula grant, the Secretary may 
adjust for the funding error across two or more 
formula allocation cycles.

in this section, the Secretary may adjust such 
rents, subject to the availability of funds for 
such rent adjustments, to rent levels that are 
equal to the lesser of budget-based rents or com-
parable market rents for the market area at the

person for the same purpose from another 
source, the grantee itself shall—

(2) bear responsibility for absorbing such cost

heading, unless the Secretary, upon the request 
of a grantee issues a public determination by 
publication in the Federal Register that it is not

served at the existing Bureau-funded school,

Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield to

thank our chair for the time. I rise in

support of H.R. 8294, which provides 
funding for numerous critical Federal 
programs for Fiscal Year 2023. 
And let me just take a moment to 
thank our chairwoman, ROSA DELAURO, 
for leading this appropriations process; 
what a job. But it was amazing, very 
inclusive, very democratic, and I thank 
her for including so much for not only 
Democrats in the bill, but also for our 
Republican colleagues. 
I also thank Leader HOYER, our 
Speaker, and Whip CLYBURN for work-
ing to get this bill to the floor. 
Not least, I thank Chairs BISHOP, 
KAPTUR, PINGREE, PRICE, QUIGLEY, and 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for their leader-
ship in crafting each of these indi-
vidual bills included in this package. 
I tell you, systemic racism—and you 
know I am going to talk about that, 
Mr. Chair—it is really at the heart of 
every crisis that we face today. This 
bill responds with critical investments 
to fight poverty, hunger, homelessness, 
housing insecurity, the climate crisis, 
and also includes so many provisions 
for equity and for justice. 
I represent a district in the Bay Area 
that has some of the biggest challenges 
with transportation and housing af-
fordability in the country. This bill 
fully funds President Biden’s plan to 
fight for fair housing. And it includes 
important investments in housing and 
transportation equity, to help reverse 
decades of systemic racism. 
The climate crisis threatens the 
health, safety, air quality, and liveli-
hoods of neighborhoods, especially poor 
and low-income neighborhoods which 
primarily are communities of color. 
This bill would advance energy inde-
pendence, lower energy costs, invest in 
renewable energy and scientific inno-
vation, and address fundamental envi-
ronmental injustices. 
Finally, as the co-chair of the Con-
gressional 
Cannabis 
Caucus, 
I 
am 
pleased that this bill furthers the effort 
to stop unfairly targeting people and 
businesses in States and localities 
where voters have chosen to make can-
nabis legal. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 
8294. I once again thank our chair-
woman for such a great job. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I move to 
strike the last word. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield to 
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WOMACK), the ranking member of the 
Financial Services and General Gov-
ernment Subcommittee. 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Chair, I thank the 
ranking member for the time. I would 
have been here a little bit earlier, but 
previous commitments kept me from 
speaking during general debate. 
I rise in opposition to this package of 
appropriations bills. I am the ranking 
member of the Financial Services and 
General 
Government 
Subcommittee, 
and I have a great deal of respect for 
my chairman, MIKE QUIGLEY. We work 
well together. I appreciate the hard 
work that Mike and his team put in in 
trying to get a bill that we can come to 
agreement on. 
However, the bill we are debating is 
packed 
with 
unjustifiable 
spending 
that 
ignores 
the 
government’s 
unsustainable fiscal trajectory and the 
historic level of inflation burdening all 
Americans, and we should be fixing 
that, not making it worse. 
As the pandemic wanes and inflation 
soars, I was hoping that we could begin 
reducing spending. Instead, the Finan-
cial Services division of this bill in-
creases discretionary spending by over 
17 percent. 
Many programs in the bill get dou-
ble-digit percentage increases; some 
get triple-digit percentage increases. 
For example, the bill provides: 
An increase of 433 percent for elec-
tion grants; 
A 20 percent for the White House; 
A 30 percent for the Federal Trade 
Commission; 
A $1 billion increase for the IRS; and 
A $1.6 billion increase for GSA. 
These increases are unconscionable 
when considering the U.S.’ historically 
high debt, now in excess of $30 trillion, 
and inflation over 9 percent. The com-
bination of debt and inflation places a 
heavy burden on future generations of 
Americans. We should be fixing that. 
There are also several controversial 
policy changes included in the FSGG 
division, such as allowing D.C. tax dol-
lars to fund abortions, and removing 
the prohibitions on Federal employee 
health benefits funding for abortions. 
These policy changes are no-goes. They 
make this bill and minibus, as a whole, 
dead in the water. They will have to be 
fixed if we are going to come to some 
agreement. 
We need to continue the longstanding 
legacy riders and drop the poison pills. 
And we need a top-line spending agree-
ment that reduces nondefense spending 
and funds national security at an ap-
propriate level. 
But maybe the larger question about 
this bill has more to do with how we 
came up with these top-line numbers. 
We allowed the four corners of leader-
ship to dictate these top-line numbers. 
They didn’t come out after a budget 
process. And we have a Budget Com-
mittee over here whose purpose is, in 
part, to do that very thing. 
b 1445 
But that didn’t happen. So we kick 
out numbers that we won’t agree to, 
wasn’t through a budget process where 
we can define our priorities, the emerg-
ing needs of our country, and come to 
some agreement through a legitimate 
budget process, but that is not what 
happened here. 
So it is long since time that we stop 
this process of doing deeming resolu-
tions or burying top-line numbers in 
rule bills and get back to the process 
that is laid out for us, and that is to do 
a budget resolution, House and Senate, 
to get to some kind of an agreement, 
and then establish an appropriate ap-
propriation process where we can do 
these bills individually. 
There are 12. We are going to do six 
today, and then we are going to do six 
later, but we ought to be doing them 
individually, and we ought to give the 
Members of Congress an opportunity— 
because it is our Article I responsi-
bility. We need to be giving the Mem-
bers of Congress the ability to have 
input on these bills and not just let the 
four corners of leadership decide what 
we are going to do or what we are not 
going to do. 
So while I oppose this package in its 
current form, I do look forward to 
working with my friend MIKE QUIGLEY 
on a bipartisan compromise, at least on 
the FSGG side, and then perhaps we 
can do that for the 12 bills completely 
and then get about the business of 
funding the government, which is part 
of our fundamental responsibility. 
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the Madam 
Ranking Member yielding time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1232, the gentle-
woman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Chair, I rise today 
with a deep concern over the rampant 
spending that has come out of this 
Chamber over the last 2 years. 
While our constituents suffer from 
40-year high inflation, this Chamber 
has done nothing to help them. In-
stead, my colleagues across the aisle 
have doubled down on their reckless 
spending and continue to make each 
bill bigger than the last. The spending 
has got to stop. 
We know that the American Rescue 
Plan was the catalyst for inflation 
problems. We know that Biden’s agen-
da has worsened those inflationary 
pressures. And yet, today—today—we 
are looking at even more exorbitant 
spending. 
We have been here before. Me and my 
colleagues remember the 1970s and the 
1980s when inflation was even worse 
than it is today. 
Inflation isn’t new. We know how to 
reverse it. We have to stop the spend-
ing. That is what my amendments do, 
cut our spending. 
I urge every Member of this Chamber 
to support my amendments, which will 
cut wasteful spending from government 
programs. 
The status quo is not serving our 
constituents. For 20 years, we have op-
erated without the appropriate appro-
priations process in this country. For 
the last 4 years, since I have been in 
Congress, I’ve never seen a budget that 
has been provided and worked out, as 
my colleague just mentioned prior to 
me. 
The spending has continued to rise 
unchallenged. When will it end? To 
maintain what we have done for the 
last 20 years is a disservice to the peo-
ple counting on us. 
When I am home in Oklahoma, the 
only thing my constituents ask me is: 
How are you going to stop inflation? 
I know it is the same for all of my 
colleagues. Here is how we can answer 
them: Cut the spending. 
Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my 
amendments from both sides of the 
aisle. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
While I have offered this en bloc 
amendment for the purposes of legisla-
tive efficiency, I strongly oppose it. 
This en bloc amendment makes severe 
and harmful cuts to the minibus. 
The draconian cuts are indiscrimi-
nate, they are harmful, and they seek 
to overturn long overdue investments. 
I urge all Members to oppose this en 
bloc amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY), 
the chair of the Subcommittee on Fi-
nancial Service and General Govern-
ment. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the legislation included in 
this amendment. These amendments 
would impose 5 and 22 percent cuts 
across the board. 
These cuts are, frankly, a clumsy 
way to randomly hack away at funding 
with no thought or consideration to 
their impact. 
The amendment would slash funding 
for the Small Business Administration 
by more than $200 million, severely un-
dercutting much-needed support for 
small businesses and entrepreneurs. 
The reduction to the IRS amendment 
would reduce staffing across the entire 
agency, resulting in lower customer 
service, reduced enforcement efforts, 
increasing the tax gap, and placing 
U.S. taxpayers at increased risk of 
identification theft. 
A 22 percent cut to the District of Co-
lumbia public safety funding would re-
sult in layoffs and reduced service for 
the D.C. courts, the D.C. Public De-
fender’s Office, and the Court Services 
and Offender Supervision Agency. The 
ability to monitor defendants pending 
trial and returning citizens would be 
severely hampered. 
A cut of this magnitude would also 
cripple many small but important 
agencies. It would prevent the Federal 
Trade Commission from investigating 
privacy and cybersecurity issues or 
pursuing cases to block anticompeti-
tive mergers. 
It would harm the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission’s ability to mon-
itor and block dangerous products. 
Additionally, this amendment would 
cripple the Office of Personnel Manage-
ment’s distribution of monthly annuity 
payments, as well as undermine other 
critical agencies that support millions 
of Federal workers across the country. 
I, therefore, urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this ill-conceived and ir-
responsible amendment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today 
in strong support of my amendments 
on this en bloc package. 
Let’s review our Nation’s fiscal tra-
jectory here. Our Nation is over $30 
trillion in debt. American families are 
dealing with record inflation, in large 
part due to unprecedented Federal 
spending.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6839 
July 19, 2022 
What does the other side want to do? 
Spend more money, which will make 
inflation worse. 
This time last year, the President 
told us inflation was temporary when 
the rate was just over 5 percent. Fast 
forward 12 months, and inflation in 
this country has skyrocketed to 9 per-
cent. This bill spends almost 14 percent 
over last year’s spending levels. 
If adopted, my three amendments 
would reduce spending by a modest 5 
percent in Transportation, Housing and 
Urban Development, Financial Serv-
ices and General Government, and De-
partment of the Interior, environment 
divisions of this spending package. 
This amendment should be an easy 
one for everyone to support. Look at 
the American people. Don’t you think 
they have cut their expenses much 
more than 5 percent because of infla-
tion? Are we going to respond to them 
like this? Yet, Democrats oppose those 
cuts. 
Every time I am in the district, I 
hear about the cost of food, the price of 
gas, and how the other side’s failed fis-
cal policies are harming American fam-
ilies. 
Milk is up 16 percent. Butter is up 21 
percent. Eggs are up 33 percent. The 
American people are not happy, and it 
is showing up in the President’s ap-
proval ratings. 
Instead of continuing down this reck-
less path, let’s change course. Ameri-
cans shouldn’t have to watch their 
hard-earned money continue to be de-
valued due to radical Democratic poli-
cies. If we are serious about stopping 
inflation, Congress must rein in waste-
ful spending and enact policies that 
will enable us to reclaim our energy 
independence. 
I urge all Members to vote in favor of 
my amendments in this en bloc pack-
age. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Transportation, 
Housing and Urban Development, and 
Related Agencies. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I urge my colleagues to sit up 
and take notice of this. This is quite an 
amendment—quite a radical amend-
ment. 
It indiscriminately would cut a total 
of 36 percent from programs in Trans-
portation and Housing without any re-
gard for the merits of the programs, 
just indiscriminate whacking away. 
This is only in the T-HUD section of 
the bill, and I will limit myself to that. 
I can’t imagine that Members would 
dream of supporting this amendment. 
Investments in our transportation 
and housing infrastructure will stall. 
Jobs will be lost. Some of our most vul-
nerable 
people, 
including 
veterans, 
children, will be harmed. 
This amendment will result in a re-
duction—I want to stress—in the very 
programs Republicans profess to sup-
port. Let me give you some good exam-
ples. 
The FAA’s Contract Tower Program 
that enjoyed strong bipartisan support, 
critical to air safety—whacked away. 
NeighborWorks, which supports local 
solutions to expand affordable housing, 
increased housing counseling assist-
ance, and strengthens economic devel-
opment. We increase NeighborWorks 
under bipartisan urging—slashed. 
Community Project Funding. Repub-
licans and Democrats alike have re-
quested these appropriations to address 
transportation and housing challenges 
in their local communities. Believe me: 
If we don’t do it, no one will. Those 
would be drastically cut. 
Port infrastructure, another Repub-
lican emphasis—cut. 
The amendment would even cut the 
small amount of defense spending in-
cluded in the T-HUD section of the bill: 
That would be directed to critical mar-
itime security programs. 
Here is what else this amendment 
would mean the eviction of tens of 
thousands of low-income households, 
half of which are elderly or disabled, a 
growing backlog of roof, elevator, and 
other critical health and safety repairs 
to public housing; thousands of home-
less veterans, survivors of domestic vi-
olence, youth out on the street; and a 
halt in the production of affordable 
housing, which already is in short sup-
ply. 
Roads, bridges, aviation, transit, rail, 
and port systems across rural and 
urban communities—having their re-
pair and upkeep halted or slowed, be-
coming less safe. 
The bill before us helps us make 
progress in rebuilding and restoring 
our infrastructure. This amendment 
would take us backward. 
It is strange, isn’t it, that deficits 
only seem to matter when it comes to 
helping people keep a safe roof over 
their heads and creating a more resil-
ient infrastructure that can withstand 
the next tornado or earthquake or 
flood, something every one of our dis-
tricts benefits from. 
This 
isn’t 
just 
a 
run-of-the-mill 
amendment. I suggest that Members 
look carefully at what is in it and what 
it would do and what kind of totally 
justified criticism they will be subject 
to if this amendment even comes close 
to passing. I urge its defeat. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. BISHOP), the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural 
Development, Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, and Related Agencies. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I 
rise in opposition to the en bloc. Mr. 
HERN’s amendment in this en bloc 
would cut discretionary programs in 
the agriculture bill by 22 percent. Mr. 
NORMAN’s would cut them by 5 percent. 
Either level will have devastating and 
counterproductive consequences across 
numerous programs. 
This would mean cutting rural devel-
opment initiatives. The 22 percent cut 
would reduce much-needed investments 
in rural broadband, electricity, water 
and waste systems, and housing at a 
time when we really, really want to lift 
our rural communities. 
It would mean cutting our invest-
ment in farm and conservation pro-
grams, agriculture research, Food for 
Peace grants, and the McGovern-Dole 
program. 
b 1500 
The Food and Drug Administration 
budget would be cut by over $800 mil-
lion under Mr. HERN’s proposal, less-
ening our ability to address the opioid 
crisis, medical supply chain issues, in-
fant formula, and food safety. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in op-
position to these amendments. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Chair, I appreciate 
the comments from my colleagues 
across the aisle. What the American 
people have just heard is the only way 
forward is to spend even more. 
Remember, the Obama administra-
tion’s own Treasury Secretary said the 
spending is what caused the inflation 
that you are experiencing that is run-
ning rampant across America. The 
spending is crushing the future of our 
American kids and our grandkids and 
future generations, with over $30 tril-
lion in debt. The same inflation that 
the Feds right now are raising interest 
rates, they are going to drive up our 
mandatory spending on the interest on 
our debt. 
The answer is not to continue spend-
ing ourselves into bankruptcy. There 
has been no offer from my colleagues 
across the aisle where there is any way 
to quit spending the amount of money 
we are seeing today. 
Moody’s just said that the American 
people have $5 trillion more in their 
bank accounts today than they had 
just a little over a year ago, money 
that was sent to them by the Federal 
Government 
that 
we 
borrow 
from 
places like China. 
Friends, we have got to be more fis-
cally responsible. I spent the last 2 
years—51⁄2 months last year, 51⁄2 months 
this year—as the budget chairman for 
the Republican Study Committee, ac-
tually working on the budget, actually 
seeing where our spending goes. 
We cannot keep having double-digit 
increases in our spending and expect to 
be ever responsible to the American 
people for the future of this country. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, if my col-
leagues on the other side were so inter-
ested in really reducing inflation, I 
would hope that they would be sup-
portive of the child tax credit, which 
none of them have supported, which, in 
fact, the majority of the people using 
the child tax credit are dealing with 
food, with clothing, with school sup-
plies, with rent, but all of these ex-
penses have gone up, and the money 
has run out. 
They can’t find their way clear to 
support a child tax credit, and that

lack of action from the Congress to 
renew the child tax credit is trouble, it 
is big trouble for these families, espe-
cially as the costs of life continue to 
swell due to inflation. 
Let’s look at the cost of inflation and 
why we have inflation and take a look 
at what the oil companies are doing 
with price gouging. What we ought to 
do is to do a windfall profits tax on 
people who are making money hand 
over fist and refuse to lower the price 
of gasoline at the pump because they 
are buying back stock to take care of 
themselves and their stakeholders. 
That is a portion of what is causing 
inflation and the rise in the cost of liv-
ing. If you were genuine about that, 
you would look at these matters as 
well as just talking about inflation and 
not looking at the root causes of it 
today. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the Republican 
leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I 
rise today in support of my amend-
ment, which is in part of the en bloc 
package of amendments No. 7 that is 
designed to help protect our giant se-
quoias, which are native to my home 
State of California, from catastrophic 
wildfires. 
Giant sequoias only grow one place 
in the world, in California. They live to 
2,000, 3,000 years. Historically, they 
only die when they tumble over after 
living through so many thousands of 
years. 
But right now, as I stand here, there 
are currently 1,500 firefighters on the 
ground 
working 
to 
contain 
the 
Washburn fire in Yosemite National 
Park. The fire is threatening more 
than 500 giant sequoias, including the 
world’s largest and oldest, the Grizzly 
Giant. 
On record prior, the only time in his-
tory that we had giant sequoias dying 
from fire was in 1297; but in the last 2 
years, we have lost 20 percent of all the 
giant sequoias from fire. Think about 
that. In just 2 years, we have now lost 
20 percent. As we speak and talk right 
now, 1,500 firefighters are trying to de-
fend 500 giant sequoias, even the oldest 
one on record. 
I led a bipartisan congressional dele-
gation to see the giant sequoias im-
pacted by fires in my district earlier 
this year. The devastation was shock-
ing. These losses are a clarion call for 
not only the National Park Service and 
the U.S. Forest Service to act to re-
move hazardous fuel buildup so we can 
reduce the risk of high-intensity fires 
in these groves, but for Congress to 
make the critical management reforms 
and provide the resources necessary to 
protect these iconic trees. 
It is interesting when we were there 
together in a bipartisan group to study 
it, there were people from other coun-
tries just to come see these majestic 
beauties. When you talk to the Forest 
Service that led us throughout, you 
would look at their badges. I don’t 
know if anyone has ever taken the 
time, but these trees are so iconic, 
they are on the badge of our U.S. For-
est Service. 
But, again, in the last 2 years, 20 per-
cent of them have been wiped out by 
fire. If we do nothing, they can all be 
taken away. 
In a Congress as divided as ours 
today, these giant sequoias have actu-
ally united a bipartisan group of law-
makers who are committed to pro-
tecting these natural wonders. I have 
been proud to introduce the Save Our 
Sequoias Act with fellow California 
Congressman SCOTT PETERS as well as 
Natural Resources Ranking Member 
BRUCE WESTERMAN, Congressman PA-
NETTA, Congressman MCCLINTOCK, Con-
gressman 
COSTA, 
Congressman 
VALADAO, 
and 
Congressman 
GARAMENDI. They have all taken the 
time to study what is before us right 
now. 
The SOS Act will help save giant se-
quoias because it was declared an 
emergency so we can immediately re-
duce the risk of catastrophic fires in 
the giant sequoia groves by removing 
the hazardous fuel buildup, remove the 
barriers that prevent the Forest Serv-
ice and local experts from taking ac-
tion in advance to save these resources, 
provide funding for the comprehensive 
reforestation study. 
We are able to come together on this 
bill because we all have deep under-
standings that our giant sequoias are 
in 
a 
crisis. 
That 
knowledge 
also 
brought us together to offer this 
amendment today. This amendment 
would prioritize $5 million in the Na-
tional Park Service and $5 million in 
the U.S. Forest Service to support ef-
forts to reduce the risk of catastrophic 
fires killing giant sequoias in the Si-
erra 
Nevada, 
including 
environ-
mentally responsible prescribed burns 
and mechanical thinning, among other 
things. But this would only be for the 
groves. 
It would also help prioritize funds for 
the development of a strategy by the 
Secretaries of the Interior and Agri-
culture to better protect the giant se-
quoia groves from catastrophic fires, a 
requirement included in the fiscal year 
2023 
Interior 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee report. 
We are racing against the clock. 
Fires are burning right now in the Si-
erra National Forest, threatening these 
trees. Some of them are more than 
2,000 years old. We cannot be the gen-
eration that allows these massive and 
ancient natural wonders to perish on 
our watch. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment and vote for the en bloc 
package No. 7. I thank the chairman, 
and I thank our ranking member for 
yielding the time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1232, the gentle-
woman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self 45 seconds. The en bloc amendment 
includes a number of proposals offered 
by my Democratic and Republican col-
leagues. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the important proposals contained 
in this amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of amendment No. 81, 
which would provide funding for the 
Modernization Access to Our Public 
Land Act, otherwise known as the 
MAPLand Act, which was enacted last 
April. 
I was proud to work with a strong, bi-
partisan coalition of Members in the 
House and the Senate to get this bill 
signed into law, and I appreciate Con-
gresswoman DINGELL for working with 
me on this amendment before us today. 
Making public land information more 
detailed and accessible in the digital 
age is one of the many reasons why 
this bill has enjoyed such broad sup-
port as it soared through the legisla-
tive process. 
Adoption of this amendment today 
will provide the funding needed to 
modernize and improve the quality of 
this data so that Americans can more 
easily recreate on our Federal lands, 
which will also improve our ability to 
fund important conservation programs 
that enhance and protect habitats 
across this Nation. 
This amendment is about helping 
families spend more time together out-
side, about improving the way our gov-
ernment works, and about fostering 
and sharing the joy of the great out-
doors. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support amendment No. 81. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chair, I am so 
glad that my amendment to fund the 
Research Facilities Act was included in 
this government spending package. We 
need to address our deferred research 
maintenance backlog and increase in-
vestments 
in 
next-generation 
agri-
culture research. 
This research is critical, as farmers 
in my district face daunting chal-
lenges. For example, the ability for re-
searchers to conduct experiments on 
plants under various environmental 
stresses is critical for understanding 
how crops respond to new climate con-
ditions. Modern facilities can also help 
researchers screen new crop varieties 
and understand the impacts of a chang-
ing climate on things like nutrient 
density 
and 
susceptibility 
to 
pes-
tilence. 
Many farmers in Washington State 
rely on the tremendous research done

at institutions like Washington State 
University. Ensuring that they have 
modern facilities, cutting-edge facili-
ties, will make it easier for them to at-
tract and keep world-class researchers. 
These investments will reposition the 
United States for leadership, long-term 
success, and competitiveness around 
the world, and make sure we are lead-
ing in agricultural research and food 
research. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of my amendment I 
introduced, which increases the Circuit 
Rider program. The modest increase of 
$418,000, offset entirely, means cleaner 
water for rural America. 
b 1515 
Circuit riders travel from facility to 
facility across our small towns, lending 
expertise and technical assistance be-
cause each individual locality does not 
have the money to pay for their own. 
Many treatment facilities in rural 
America have a dozen or less employ-
ees, and these circuit riders save 
money for local budgets and taxpayers. 
According to the National Rural 
Water Association, this minor increase 
allows for about 90 more circuit riders. 
That is 90 more experts traveling 
across rural America and rural Min-
nesota, lending their invaluable knowl-
edge to our rural water treatment fa-
cilities. 
In an industry losing expertise to re-
tirement or other jobs, this funding 
can also be used to keep these mission- 
critical positions competitive. 
Finally, this amendment brings fund-
ing for the Circuit Rider Program in 
line with a request I led along with 50 
other bipartisan Members of Congress. 
Let’s allow rural America to have 
clean, sanitary water, free up local 
budgets, and ensure our rural operators 
get the technical assistance they so 
desperately need. 
Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my 
amendment. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. BISHOP), the chair of the Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Food and 
Drug 
Administration, 
and 
Related 
Agencies Subcommittee. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I 
rise in support of this bipartisan en 
bloc. These amendments addressing the 
Agriculture division of the package 
were made in order by the rule, and 
they have been agreed to by both sides. 
This was a truly collaborative proc-
ess between both sides of the aisle, and 
I believe this bipartisan effort will defi-
nitely improve the bill. 
I thank the sponsors for their efforts 
and highlight a few of the issues that 
are covered by these amendments: en-
couraging innovation in USDA re-
search programs, protecting victims of 
trafficking, and increasing funding for 
the farm-to-school program and the 
Circuit Rider Program. 
Mr. Chair, I support the amendment 
and urge its adoption. It improves the 
bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, 
I thank Chairwoman DELAURO
very 
much for the opportunity to speak. 
Last 
year, 
Hurricane 
Ida 
swept 
through my State, leaving in its wake 
a shocking, terrible path of destruc-
tion. This body saw the devastation of 
this storm and saw fit to make an im-
mediate downpayment so that the re-
covery could begin in Louisiana as we 
assessed the incredible damage. 
Implied in that downpayment was a 
commitment to come back and do 
more when Louisiana determined its 
actual need. My State, and many peo-
ple here, are asking this body to keep 
its commitment. 
Disaster knows no boundary. It can 
and will hit all of our districts unex-
pectedly. I promise to be with you 
when it does. Today, I need this body 
to stand with me and pass additional 
hurricane relief funding so that the 
people of Louisiana can fully recover. 
Mr. Chair, I urge the passage of en 
bloc No. 2. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendments en bloc offered by 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Chair, I demand a 
recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendments en bloc 
offered by the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut will be postponed.

House Resolution 1232, the gentle-

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self 45 seconds. 
The amendments en bloc includes a 
number of proposals offered by my 
Democratic colleagues. It reflects our 
shared values of investing in the Amer-
ican people to create good-paying jobs, 
grow opportunity, and provide a life-
line to the vulnerable. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support the important proposals con-
tained in this en bloc, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I reserve

thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
These amendments en bloc address 
the Agriculture division of this pack-
age that were made in order by the

July 19, 2022 
Food Security Program. Representa-
tive VELA´ ZQUEZ’ amendment draws at-
tention to Puerto Rico’s nutrition 
needs, where about 1.5 million resi-
dents receive nutrition assistance. 
The amendments highlight other im-
portant issues, such as rural energy ef-
ficiency and the need to build our in-
fant formula manufacturing base in 
this country. 
Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, 
and I urge its adoption. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in opposition to the en bloc 
package 
of 
amendments. 
These 
46 
amendments do nothing to reduce in-
flation, fix the supply chain, lower gas 
prices, or bolster our national security. 
Instead, these amendments continue 
the majority’s trend of inflationary 
spending increases, including a pro-
posal to increase mandatory spending 
by another $1 billion, just one example 
of excess spending. 
The Energy Efficiency and Renew-
able Energy Office receives an enor-
mous 25 percent increase in this bill, 
and this en bloc package would in-
crease it even more. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle must understand Americans 
will not stand for bloated bureaucracy 
and runaway spending. 
Mr. Chair, I urge Members to vote 
‘‘no’’ on this en bloc package, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Chair, I rise 
in support of amendment No. 66 included in 
En Bloc 3 and sponsored by Congresswoman 
NYDIA VELA´ZQUEZ of New York. I am a co-
sponsor of this amendment, which supports an 
increase of $1 billion for the Nutrition Assist-
ance Program in Puerto Rico for Fiscal Year 
2023 . 
Unlike the 50 states, the U.S, Virgin Islands, 
and Guam, Puerto Rico does not participate in 
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram, known as SNAP. Instead, we have the 
NAP block grant, which provides capped fund-
ing and serves over 1.4 million of my constitu-
ents on the Island. 
Due to limited funds, NAP does not auto-
matically adjust to increases in demand These 
are most common in the aftermath of natural 
disasters, like we saw after the hurricanes in 
2017, and most recently the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Because of this, we have had to turn 
to Congress on multiple occasions to advocate 
for additional emergency NAP funds, included 
in various disaster supplementals. 
The most recent allotment, provided due to 
COVID–19, was expended last month, mean-
ing Island residents who rely on this program 
have already noticed a significant reduction in 
their monthly benefits as we continue man-
aging the challenges related to the pandemic 
and the rising costs of food. Additional funds 
are needed since, for many, NAP is the main 
program that secures their access to a healthy 
diet. 
Mr. Speaker, the true remedy to this issue 
is a transition to SNAP. Currently, NAP bene-
ficiaries in PR receive far less in monthly ben-
efits than their counterparts in SNAP, and 
don’t have access to programs like D–SNAP. 
which is a vehicle to get expedited disaster 
assistance without depending on supplemental 
legislation. As such, I have introduced H.R. 
5220, the Puerto Rico Nutrition Assistance 
Fairness Act, which transitions Puerto Rico 
from NAP to SNAP, and I continue working 
with stakeholders to gather additional input on 
this issue moving forward. 
Still, there is an immediate need at hand. As 
such, I support this and every effort that seeks 
to secure additional funds for NAP and under-
scores the need to transition to SNAP 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of my amendment to H.R. 
8294, the fiscal year 2023 Transportation, 
Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Energy and Water Devel-
opment, Financial Services and General Gov-
ernment, Interior, Environment, Military Con-
struction, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations 
Act, to ensure that Congress is adequately 
funding Tenant Participation Activities. I thank 
Chairs ROSA DELAURO AND DAVID PRICE for 
supporting this amendment. 
The right of tenants to organize is a funda-
mental part of successful federal housing pro-
grams. The tenant participation process, built 
into all of HUD’s major housing programs, can 
ensure that tenants play an integral role in the 
management process and promote services 
benefitting all residents. For example, through 
the public notice and comment process, ten-
ants can prevent changes to the property that 
will destabilize residents’ lives or diminish their 
rights. Funding resident participation and orga-
nizing activities is also an intentional and ac-
tive way to value the lived experience of as-
sisted families. Their empowerment is essen-
tial as we work towards a more just housing 
system. 
At present, these activities are not ade-
quately funded. The allotment that Public 
Housing Authorities can provide tenant partici-
pation activities through a formula—$25 per 
occupied unit—has not changed since 2001. 
As a former union organizer, I understand 
what a difference even a small amount of 
funds can make for getting people activated 
and motivated to join an organizing effort. My 
amendment seeks to ensure that the PHA al-
lotment is increased to $40 per occupied unit, 
per year, adjusted for inflation so that HUD 
residents have the financial support they need 
to participate in organizing activities that will 
improve the lives of residents and their sur-
rounding communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant amendment. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I 
rise today in support of my amendment 
to ensure that funding is prioritized for 
the Rebuilding American Infrastruc-
ture with Sustainability and Equity 
(RAISE) discretionary grant program 
in H.R. 8294, the fiscal year 2023 Trans-
portation, Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Energy and Water Development, Finan-
cial Services and General Government, 
Interior, Environment, Military Con-
struction, and Veterans Affairs Appro-
priations Act. It is critical that RAISE 
grants include equipping our highways 
with electric vehicle charging equip-
ment, as well as powering public buses 
and rail with electricity. I thank 
Chairs ROSA DELAURO and DAVID PRICE 
for their support for my amendment. 
Today, continued investments in out-
dated technology that contributes to 
our planet’s disastrous overheating are 
not sustainable. Instead, we should be 
investing 
in 
projects 
that 
will 
decarbonize and electrify our public 
transportation sector and help the 
country achieve net-zero carbon emis-
sions. We must also commit to funding 
projects that further the goal of equity 
and uplift our most vulnerable popu-
lations, as the effects of climate 
change have a disproportionate impact 
on communities of color. 
Our planet and the future of younger 
Americans and future generations de-
pend on our ability to act on climate 
change now, and take every oppor-
tunity to transition away from fossil 
fuel dependence. Madam Speaker, this 
is one of those critical opportunities. 
This is our opportunity to ensure that 
our infrastructure is sustainable and 
equitable; to make a strategic invest-
ment both in our nation’s infrastruc-
ture and our environment; to invest in 
future generations, not just for our 
grandchildren but for their children 
and beyond. I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, 
I rise in support of En Bloc 3 that includes my 
Rules amendment number 110 to increase 
funding for diversity in the aviation field. 
Being an aircraft pilot is an in-demand, high- 
paying profession, with the median annual 
wage for a commercial pilot being over 
$99,000. Unfortunately, the aviation industry is 
impressively homogenous. According to the 
Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 93 percent of 
aviation pilots and engineers in 2021 were 
White with only 6.1 percent being Hispanic/ 
Latino, 3.9 percent being Black, and 1.5 per-
cent being Asian. Approximately 95 percent of 
aviation pilots and engineers are men. 
Prior to the pandemic, the pilot pipeline was 
untenably low, We have heard repeatedly this 
summer about how the recent travel problems 
occur in part due to a pilot shortage. The high 
cost of pilot training is a key barrier to entering 
the profession, especially for people of color. 
Pilot training can cost between $80,000 to 
$100,000. 
My amendment gives Congress an oppor-
tunity to help individuals enter aviation careers 
while increasing the diversity of the field. My 
amendment increases and decreases the Re-
search, Engineering, and Development pro-
gram by $10 million to highlight the need to 
double funding for the Aviation Workforce De-
velopment Grants. The Aviation Workforce De-
velopment Grants program invests in training 
and diversification of aircraft pilots and avia-
tion maintenance workers. The aircraft pilot 
program and the aviation maintenance pro-
gram each is currently authorized at $5 mil-
lion. My amendment highlights how doubling 
funding for these grants would help address 
the immediate need to increase the aviation 
workforce with a focus on individuals currently 
underrepresented in the profession. 
Further, my amendment focuses on how the 
Aviation Workforce program could include 
more students of color by expanding partner-
ships with Historically Black Colleges and Uni-
versities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and 
the five Minority Serving Institutions, including: 
Asian American Native American Pacific Is-
lander-Serving Institutions; Alaska Native and

Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Hispanic

Non-Tribal Institutions; and Predominantly 
Black Institutions. These institutions have ex-
pertise in educating and graduating low in-
come students of color. Collaborating with 
these institutions is an effective way to target 
grants to students from racial/ethnic back-
grounds with financial need. 
In closing, I urge my colleagues to support 
my amendment to bring attention to the need 
to increase funding for aviation workforce 
training and diversity. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

AMENDMENTS EN BLOC NO. 4 OFFERED BY MS. 
DELAURO OF CONNECTICUT 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, pursuant 
to 
House 
Resolution 
1232, 
I 
offer 
amendments en bloc. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendments en bloc. 
Amendments en bloc No. 4 consisting 
of amendments Nos. 13 and 179, printed 
in part A of House Report 117–420, of-
fered by Ms. DELAURO of Connecticut: 
AMENDMENT NO. 13 OFFERED BY MR. GOOD OF 
VIRGINIA 
Page 241, after line 8, insert the following: 
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available 
by this Act may be used to implement, ad-
minister, or enforce the prevailing wage re-
quirements in subchapter IV of chapter 31 of 
title 40, United States Code (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Davis-Bacon Act’’). 
AMENDMENT NO. 179 OFFERED BY MR. GOOD OF 
VIRGINIA 
Page 241, after line 8, insert the following: 
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available 
by this Act may be used to implement, ad-
minister, or enforce the prevailing wage re-
quirements in subchapter IV of chapter 31 of 
title 40, United States Code (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Davis-Bacon Act’’). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1232, the gentle-
woman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I oppose these amendments en bloc. 
Davis-Bacon is a pretty simple concept 
and a fair one. What does the Davis- 
Bacon Act do? It protects the govern-
ment as well as workers in carrying 
out the policy of paying a decent wage 
on government contracts. 
The Davis-Bacon Act requires that 
workers on federally funded construc-
tion projects be paid no less than the 
wages paid in the community for simi-
lar work. It requires that every con-
tract for construction to which the 
Federal Government is a party, in ex-
cess of $2,000, contain a provision defin-
ing the minimum wages paid to various 
classes of laborers and mechanics. 
The House has taken numerous votes 
on this issue, and on every vote this 
body has voted to maintain Davis- 
Bacon requirements. We should not be 
attacking working-class people, men 
and women who work every single day 
for a decent paycheck, and their wages 
haven’t been increased with the cost of 
inflation. We should defeat the amend-
ment before us today, and we should 
move on to more important matters. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to vote 
‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 10 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. VALADAO), a member of the 
Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, I request 
support from my colleagues on a very 
simple amendment. 
This amendment would prohibit the 
Department of Energy from sending 
America’s Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve to China. Supporting this lan-
guage is common sense, especially 
since we need to focus on increasing 
energy production and not supporting 
our adversaries while Americans are 
still suffering from outrageously high 
fuel prices here at home. 
These reserves are meant to be used 
for emergencies only. They are not 
meant to be used when our leadership 
has failed us by unnecessarily restrict-
ing domestic energy production. 
What is even more concerning is that 
under the Biden administration, our 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve supplies 
have been severely diminished. It does 
not make sense that we are using our 
already depleted energy supplies to 
help China build up their own strategic 
reserves. 
It is irresponsible and dangerous for 
the United States to provide our for-
eign adversary with fuel that we des-
perately need to keep here in the 
United States in case of an emergency. 
It seems the Biden administration is 
helping to support China’s national se-
curity at the expense of our own. 
It has been suggested that selling re-
sources from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve will help reduce fuel prices 
here at home. That is simply not true. 
What we should be doing instead is 
supporting our energy producers here 
in the United States. We have abun-
dant resources here that can and 
should be used. We are deliberately 
holding our country back by overregu-
lating and stifling our domestic energy 
producers. The very last thing we 
should be doing is sending our precious 
resources from the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to China. I urge all of my 
colleagues to support the United States 
national security by supporting this 
amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD 
the text of this amendment. 
At the end of division C (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available 
by this Act may be used to draw down and 
sell petroleum products from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve to any entity that does 
not certify to the Secretary of Energy that— 
(1) it is not under the ownership, control, 
or influence of the Chinese Communist 
Party; and 
(2) such petroleum products will not be ex-
ported to the People’s Republic of China. 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, thank you 
for allowing me this time to talk about 
the importance of the three amend-
ments I submitted to this bill that, un-
fortunately, we won’t be voting on 
today. 
The severe drought throughout the 
American West has been negatively im-
pacting my constituents and local com-
munity for years. 
In the Central Valley, our farmers 
have had to turn to pumping ground-
water to protect their high-value crops. 
Towns have been forced to pump more 
and more groundwater to meet their 
communities’ needs. As a result, these 
communities have experienced land 
subsidence at the expense of critical 
water infrastructure. 
In the worst cases, farmers are forced 
to fallow their fields and dry out valu-
able orchards due to access to little or 
no water. 
My constituents are farmers who feed 
the world, and with record-high food 
prices, the inability for our domestic 
farmers to grow food is going to impact 
the entire country. The situation is 
dire and only getting worse. 
We can’t produce more water, but we 
can work with the water we already 
have and apply commonsense solutions 
to make this water available to our ag-
ricultural communities. 
My first amendment would have ad-
dressed water storage capacity issues 
by extending the storage provision of 
subtitle J of the WIIN Act. It would 
have also created a program to assist 
in funding the repairs to damaged 
canal facilities. 
Unless these canals are completely 
restored, the issue of subsidence and 
resulting unnecessary water loss will 
continue and conditions will worsen. 
b 1530 
My second amendment would codify 
the 2019 biological opinions that were 
independently peer-reviewed and in-
formed by the most accurate and best- 
available science. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion’s Bureau of Reclamation has ig-
nored science and reinitiated consulta-
tion with the BiOps with no expla-
nation. Codifying the 2019 BiOps would 
put an end to senseless litigation and 
provide operational certainty for Val-
ley farmers. 
My third amendment was one focused 
on transparency and would direct the 
Bureau of Reclamation to provide the 
Committee on Appropriations with a 
justification on their decision to reini-
tiate consultation of 2019 biological 
opinions. We need to stop playing poli-
tics with a resource that the Central 
Valley is so reliant on.

It is extremely disappointing that 
the majority rejected each one of these 
amendments that would bring more 
water to the communities throughout 
the Central Valley who are doing ev-
erything they possibly can to survive 
these conditions and provide food for 
our Nation. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS). 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I ap-
preciate the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Here we are once again having a dis-
cussion about Davis-Bacon prevailing 
wages. Dozens of studies over decades 
have shown prevailing wages increase 
productivity, raise wages, helps local 
contractors, promote high-quality ap-
prenticeship programs. The very thing 
that we talk about doing here for our 
districts. 
Prevailing wage laws increase pro-
ductivity by attracting higher-quality 
general contractors and subcontractors 
to bid on public works; it levels the 
playing 
field. 
As 
a 
result, 
public 
projects cut down on change orders and 
finish projects with greater efficiency. 
In fact, in 2015, West Virginia re-
pealed its State prevailing wage law, 
arguing it would allow the State to 
build five schools instead of four. But 
after a study, the repeal showed that 
there were no cost savings from repeal 
of the law—but massive decreases in 
wages, out-of-town contractors and ap-
prenticeships. 
Not only that, prevailing wage laws 
are also good for business. They are 
good for contractor associations. They 
are good for people. 
I find it absolutely unbelievable that 
we come down and have these discus-
sions each and every time saying: I am 
fighting to lower wages in my district. 
This is what my people want, they 
want to be paid less. Not a word on 
what the contractor/owners can make. 
But the workers, the ones who build 
things, we are fighting to lower those 
wages. 
This is insane. I would call it dumb, 
but I want to be kinder. We are in a 
great institution. Let’s just call it 
wrong, hateful, misappropriated. 
But the fact of the matter is, we are 
here to raise the level of quality and, 
certainly, of helping those who need it 
most, the ones who build America. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat this amendment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, 
I rise in support of two amendments 
that would prohibit Federal funding for 
Davis-Bacon under Division A and Di-
vision F of this minibus. 
Passed into law in 1931, Davis-Bacon 
was a conglomeration of many Jim 
Crow-era policies intended to inflate 
the wages of government contractors 
and eliminate competition for labor in 
favor of White union workers. 
Nearly every day on this House floor, 
we hear from Democrats about how 
anyone who disagrees with them must 
obviously be a racist. That is their de-
fault response to virtually all opposi-
tion to their disastrous policies. 
Climate—racist. 
Healthcare—racist. 
COVID—racist. Infrastructure—racist. 
Police—racist. School choice—racist. 
Border security—racist. Voting Repub-
lican—obviously, racist. Being a pa-
triot in the military—racist. Election 
integrity—super racist. 
In fact, the President of the United 
States called proponents of voter ID 
worse than Jim Crow. They were ‘‘Jim 
Eagle.’’ 
But will any Democrat join me today 
in this effort to oppose Davis-Bacon, a 
hateful, legal artifact from the Jim 
Crow era? 
Beyond its history, the Davis-Bacon 
Act artificially drives up the cost of 
Federally funded construction projects 
by requiring the payment of the pre-
vailing wage, an arbitrary wage deter-
mined by the Department of Labor, 
rather than the wage determined by 
the marketplace. That is never good, 
and certainly not in the interest of the 
taxpayer—you know, the ones who pay 
the bills. 
In fact, Davis-Bacon drives up Fed-
eral construction costs by about 10 per-
cent every year and costs taxpayers 
about $11 billion a year. I know, I 
know. We waste trillions around here, 
and we don’t care about billions. We 
don’t take that seriously. But why 
should American taxpayers subsidize 
unions when only 14 percent of con-
struction workers are unionized. 
Billions of Federal dollars are being 
funneled towards just one-tenth of the 
entire construction workforce in our 
country. By inflating wages far above 
the market rate, we are not helping 
American workers, we are robbing tax-
payers of $11 billion a year. Nonunion 
workers are paying more in taxes to 
subsidize higher union wages for Davis- 
Bacon workers. 
With the Biden price hike driving in-
flation to a 40-percent high at 9 per-
cent, we should all be thinking about 
ways to save taxpayer money and 
make government more efficient. The 
Biden price hike has the impact of 
making every American work one 
month for free this year. That is how 
much less purchasing power they have. 
My legislation to repeal the Davis- 
Bacon Act has the support of Ameri-
cans for Prosperity, Citizens Against 
Government 
Waste, 
FreedomWorks, 
Heritage Action for America, and Na-
tional Right to Work. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge all my col-
leagues to support my commonsense 
amendments to prohibit funding for 
Davis-Bacon and save taxpayers $11 bil-
lion per year. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the chairman of 
the Transportation, Housing and Urban 
Development, and Related Agencies for 
appropriations. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I strongly oppose this amend-
ment. It seeks to waive longstanding 
prevailing wage requirements that are 
contained in the Davis-Bacon Act. 
This act ensures that workers are 
paid decent wages while preventing 
contractors from undercutting com-
petitors by offering wages or setting 
wages below prevailing levels. 
Davis-Bacon helps protect workers. 
It helps protect the government. Davis- 
Bacon applies government-wide, but it 
does particularly apply to the T-HUD 
sections of the bill. Hence, I strongly 
oppose it. 
I often noted immodestly over these 
last years when everybody was talking 
infrastructure—and 
‘‘Infrastructure 
Week’’ almost became a punch line— 
that while everybody else was talking 
about it, we were doing it. We were 
doing it on the T-HUD Appropriations 
Subcommittee and in the Congress, 
year after year, plugging away at our 
infrastructure needs. 
And that is what we have done. We 
have actually made investments in the 
annual T-HUD bill, and these invest-
ments 
are 
practically 
synonymous 
with construction. That is what they 
are about. Construction. Construction 
workers. 
There are countless transportation 
formula and competitive grant pro-
grams, as well as affordable housing 
programs in the bill that follow Davis- 
Bacon requirements—have done so hap-
pily 
and 
productively 
over 
many 
years—and they would suddenly face 
new standards. 
Davis-Bacon has helped construction 
workers in all trades all throughout 
the Nation since 1931, and there is no 
need to abandon it now—although Re-
publicans have been trying to abandon 
it for a good number of those years. 
Instead of actively trying to reduce 
wages, we should be working to lift up 
workers and increase wages. The Con-
gress has rejected similar amendments 
in the past because there is a strong bi-
partisan support in this body for fair 
labor standards for construction con-
tracts. 
So it is my hope that we stop dis-
respecting working people. Stop dis-
respecting working people. Stand up 
for working people. Defeat this amend-
ment before us today. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to op-
pose the en bloc amendment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chairman, I 
rise today in support of my amendment 
to protect seniors and crack down on 
drug companies obscuring the side ef-
fects of their prescription drugs in 
their television ads. 
The United States is one of only two 
countries 
that 
allow 
direct-to-con-
sumer pharmaceutical advertising, and 
there are serious consumer safety con-
cerns about these ads. These ads use 
distracting imagery, such as butter-
flies, happy puppies, cheesy music, and

beautiful sunrises to distract con-
sumers from a drug’s dangerous side ef-
fects. 
Congress 
instructed 
the 
FDA 
to 
crack down on these deceptive tech-
niques more than a decade ago. How-
ever, the FDA has misused that statu-
tory deadline by more than a decade. 
My amendment simply instructs the 
agency to finalize the rulemaking as 
soon as possible. Medical decisions 
should always be made between a pa-
tient and their doctor, not between a 
patient and their TV screen. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support my commonsense consumer 
protection amendment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, in 
closing, I just remind my colleagues, 
this body has rejected this amendment 
on a bipartisan basis time and time 
again. 
Speaking about inflation, we know 
that wages have not kept up with infla-
tion, and working people are strug-
gling, living paycheck to paycheck. 
Why are we dealing with an amend-
ment that would try to curtail wages 
and prevailing wages for workers every 
day who go on a job and put forth all of 
their efforts to be able to get a decent 
wage to take care of their children, to 
be able to deal with inflation? 
It speaks loudly of my colleagues 
who refuse to believe that we need to 
have wages increase to help people 
fight inflation. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendments en bloc offered by 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I demand 
a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendments en bloc 
offered by the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut will be postponed.

The first thing is an overall concern 
of spending. It is a lot easier to break 
an economy than to fix an economy. 
And the American Rescue Plan and the 
very 
high-spending 
infrastructure 
bill—between them, spending over $3 
trillion—I think is the primary reason 
for the huge inflation we are having to 
deal with today. 
Look at these underlying bills—the 
T-HUD bill, up 12 percent; financial 
services—in general government up 17 
percent—these programs have to be 
held at an even or slight decrease level 
for years to make up for the damage 
that was done with those two big bills. 
I am not going to say there wasn’t 
damage done before that. I think a lit-
tle bit of the COVID bills that were 
originally signed by the prior President 
were not exactly the most frugal 
things either, but everybody knew at 
the time this was a problem. And my 
amendments are along the lines of not 
destroying programs, not taking out 
programs altogether, but going back to 
the amount that was spent last year, or 
the amount that was spent in Presi-
dent Obama’s final year. 
I sometimes use President Obama’s 
final year to show that I am not being 
reckless here, but what I am saying is, 
there ought to be a little bit of re-
straint in the Committee on Appropria-
tions and a little bit of restraint of the 
new bills coming out. 
A couple of my amendments also ad-
dress this obsession with hiring bu-
reaucrats to enforce diversity. America 
is supposed to be a country in which we 
view ourselves as individuals. There 
are people who, I think, want to de-
stroy America, and try to set one group 
against the other group. 
When I look in my district, I know a 
lot of people who are Hmong. I recently 
got to know a lot of people from India. 
I know people from Russia. They have 
had no problem succeeding in America. 
And they all tell me the same thing: 
The easiest place in the world to suc-
ceed is America. 
But there are people who try to di-
vide us and set up programs in which 
you say, I am not going to succeed be-
cause of who I am. I want to succeed as 
a group of people determined by where 
my ancestors were born three or five or 
ten generations ago. 
b 1545 
Not only are these programs, first of 
all, a waste of money. We have to have 
some people administer the programs, 
we have nowhere near enough people to 
work in American business as it is. 
Secondly, they are designed to train 
people that what goes on in Wash-
ington is a fight or a contest between 
ethnic groups—that is a cancerous way 
to think. The fact that so many immi-
grants come here without even being 
able to speak English and succeed, 
wildly show it as a lie. I am trying to 
reduce funding or get rid of funding all 
together for some of these programs. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-
port of my amendment in en bloc No. 5. 
My amendment prohibits funds made 
available by this act to be used to pro-
mulgate, implement, administer, or en-
force President Biden’s radical abor-
tion executive order number 14076. 
In this executive order, the Biden ad-
ministration chose to focus its atten-
tion on protecting the abortion indus-
try at the expense of women and their 
unborn children. This is totally unac-
ceptable. 
This executive order is also ruled by 
executive fiat, and my amendment 
rightfully defunds it. The executive 
order is also a great example of 
disinformation. The Biden administra-
tion tried to create the Disinformation 
Governance Board, and it didn’t do so 
well. Now we have it in an executive 
order—disinformation. 
Let me be very clear. Miscarriage 
management and the treatment of ec-
topic pregnancies are not abortions. 
The Biden administration’s executive 
order simply creates fear and confusion 
by spreading this misinformation. 
Finally, nothing in the Constitution 
grants the Federal Government the au-
thority to expand access to abortion. 
This is a State’s rights issue and must 
be resolved at the State level. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to 
support this amendment to defund this 
Biden executive order promoting abor-
tion. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
offered two amendments to this appro-
priations package that would save a 
total of $86 million in taxpayer dollars.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6849 
July 19, 2022 
One amendment strikes funding to 
buy electric vehicles for the Federal 
fleet, and the other removes woke Fed-
eral funding to make public housing 
‘‘climate resilient’’—whatever the heck 
that is. 
The American people cannot afford 
Biden’s climate agenda. They also 
don’t want it, as I am confident they 
will demonstrate 112 days from today. 
Americans are suffering from 9 per-
cent inflation, the highest in 40 years. 
Call it the Biden price hike, if you will, 
with an average national gas price of 
nearly $5 per gallon. 
Yet, this Democratic majority wants 
to make the American people pay for 
unelected bureaucrats to drive around 
in expensive electric vehicles and make 
them fund climate welfare programs. 
Washington is pumping $91 billion in 
funding toward a ridiculous transpor-
tation and housing bill. This is an in-
crease of 12 percent year over year. 
Voting for an absurd spending in-
crease is simply a vote for more infla-
tion and economic pain for all Ameri-
cans. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment, vote to elimi-
nate wasteful spending, and oppose the 
underlying bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume in 
closing. 
Mr. Chair, while I have offered this 
en bloc amendment for legislative effi-
ciency, I strongly oppose it. 
The en bloc amendment makes se-
vere, harmful changes to the bills that 
are under consideration. Included in 
the en bloc amendments there is a lim-
itation on the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency to be able to hire new em-
ployees and detrimental efforts to the 
environment; it limits access to voting; 
and, in particular, infringes on a wom-
an’s 
access 
to 
healthcare. 
These 
amendments do not move our country 
forward, they really are harmful to all 
Americans. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to op-
pose this amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The 
Acting 
CHAIR

KRISHNAMOORTHI). The question is on

peared to have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I demand 
a recorded vote.

ceedings on the amendments en bloc

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1232, the gentle-
woman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self 45 seconds. The en bloc includes a 
number of proposals offered by my 
Democratic colleagues. It reflects our 
shared values of investing in the Amer-
ican people to create good-paying jobs, 
to grow opportunity, and provide a life-
line to the vulnerable. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support the important proposals con-
tained in this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Chair, I would urge 
my colleagues to support my amend-
ment, amendment No. 133 of division D, 
a part of en bloc No. 5. 
This amendment would prohibit the 
SEC from implementing provisions of 
its proposal entitled Enhancement and 
Standardization 
of 
Climate-Related 
Disclosures for Investors that mandate 
disclosure of Scope 3 emissions. 
Scope 3 emissions include emissions 
from activities in an organization’s 
supply chain. Public companies have 
no ownership—and little to no con-
trol—of these emissions. 
Recently, I led a bipartisan letter 
with 118 Members of Congress express-
ing concern about the proposed rule’s 
impact on farmers. 
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD 
the letter. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, May 25, 2022. 
Hon. GARY GENSLER, 
Chair, Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR GENSLER: We write to express 
significant concerns with the impact the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) 
proposed rule on ‘‘Enhanced and Standard-
ization of Climate-Related Disclosures for 
Investors’’ will have on the agricultural 
community. 
It is our strong belief that this proposed 
rule, if promulgated, would be a significant 
and unworkable regulatory burden, and a 
considerable departure from the SEC’s mis-
sion to protect investors, facilitate capital 
formation, and foster fair, orderly, and effi-
cient markets. It is not within the purview 
of the SEC to regulate farmers and ranchers, 
which is what this rule would do by requir-
ing public companies to disclose their Scope 
3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To do 
business with public companies, small farms 
would be required to disclose a significant 
amount of climate-related information. But 
unlike large corporations, small farms do 
not have full-scale compliance departments. 
Imposing these additional reporting require-
ments could disqualify small, family-owned 
farms from doing business with companies 
which could lead to more consolidation in 
the agriculture industry. 
Farmers are already regulated by agencies 
at the local, state, and federal levels. There 
are currently multiple programs at the fed-
eral level to help farmers implement con-
servation practices. Bureaucrats in Wash-
ington, 
D.C.—specifically 
unelected 
SEC 
staff—who have no jurisdiction over environ-
mental policy and who have never stepped 
foot on a farm should not have such influ-
ence over how farmers take care of their 
land. 
We also have concerns about the specific 
information from each farm that would have 
to be reported under this proposal. The time 
and energy put into complying with this new 
regulation will divert American farmers 
away from their primary goal of producing 
our nation’s food, fuel, and fiber. As this rule 
is written, it is also unclear how farmers will 
be protected from privacy concerns as they, 
unlike corporations, live at their places of 
business where they would now have to dis-
close significant amounts of information. In 
American Farm Bureau Federation v. EPA, the 
8th U.S. Circuit Court for Appeals affirmed 
that public disclosure of farmers’ personal 
information would constitute a ‘‘substan-
tial’’ and ‘‘clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy.’’ Similarly, the SEC should 
consider how the disclosure of Scope 3 GHG 
emissions could have privacy implications 
for farmers and scrap this rule entirely to 
ensure their private property information 
would not end up on any public disclosures. 
Finally, we are concerned that the com-
ment period, although recently extended 
until June, is inadequate given the mag-
nitude of this proposed rule, which totals 510 
pages and has 1,068 technical footnotes. The 
Commission’s use of abbreviated comment 
periods for complex rules like this as well as 
the lack of consistency across rulemakings 
is troubling, as it will result in less, much- 
needed input from the public on these impor-
tant issues. 
We appreciate your attention to our con-
cerns and request a response no later than 
June 24, 2022.

Mr. ROSE. Mr. Chair, the proposal 
would drive capital away from smaller 
suppliers that may not have the re-
sources to measure their greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. 
SEC 
Chair 
Gensler 
points to significant investor demand 
for requiring this type of information, 
but the demand is coming from large 
asset managers and climate activists, 
not retail investors. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, this is a bill 
that has to pass if we are going to keep 
the government operating. The chair of 
this committee has worked very hard 
to get that done, and she has been suc-
cessful, as chair, of moving most of our 
bills through this House. 
The Senate has not yet moved any of 
its bills, as it did not last year. This is 
an important, critical part of our proc-
ess to fund government and keep it op-
erating and invest in the priorities of 
the American people. That is what we 
are doing today in these appropriation 
bills. 
Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman ROSA 
DELAURO and members of the staff of 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
for 
their hard work on this package. 
Once again, our majority is passing 
appropriation bills in a timely manner. 
Sadly, as I said, the Senate has yet to 
bring any appropriation bills to the 
Senate floor. 
Today’s package funds about a quar-
ter of the total expected discretionary 
funding for next year. It reflects the 
budget request from the Biden adminis-
tration, and in some cases funds pro-
grams at levels we have determined 
should be increased. 
It also includes Community Project 
Funding for investments in our com-
munities that will help improve public 
safety, encourage economic growth, 
and fight poverty. 
Bringing back Community Project 
Funding was an essential tool in help-
ing to restore Congress’ power of the 
purse. I add that it was done in a bipar-
tisan way, and it was done—thanks to 
the chair—in a very transparent way. 
We wanted to make sure that more 
funding decisions are being made by 
the Members who know their districts 
best. 
There is much to celebrate in this 
package, which is why I rise in support 
of this package. Many important and 
worthwhile investments in the Amer-
ican people, in our communities, in 
economic opportunity, and in so many 
areas—I am not going to go into all of 
them, they will be discussed. 
I do want to highlight just a few of 
the important victories in this bill, 
particularly for the constituents and 
communities I represent in Maryland’s 
Fifth District. 
First, Mr. Chairman, this bill moves 
us a major step closer to realizing a 
new, badly needed, consolidated FBI 
Headquarters, a critical national secu-
rity project that many of us have 
worked on for more than a decade. 
In fact, I started working on this in 
2009 when the director of the FBI said: 
This building is very out of date, does 
not accommodate the work that we 
need to do, and we must have a new 
building—and requested that there be a 
campus-like setting where all of the 
FBI could be consolidated from the al-
most 20 different locations that they 
were located in in the city. 
This legislation will ensure that we 
can build a fully consolidated FBI 
Headquarters that meets the needs of 
the Bureau with a substantial payment 
of $500 million toward that project. It 
limits the GSA to committing any of 
those funds only to one of the two sites 
in Maryland and one in Virginia. The 
GSA just recently adjudged all three of 
those sites to be eligible sites. 
This project, first requested, as I 
said, by the FBI in 2009, is now ready 
for final site selection. This building, 
which had been delayed at a cost of 
giving the Bureau the tools and facili-
ties necessary to fulfill its missions, 
can now be advanced in the timeframe 
I have understood from the administra-
tion, which is before the end of the fis-
cal year. 
b 1600 
In May of last year, the four Sen-
ators from Maryland and Virginia 
wrote to President Biden and urged his 
administration to move forward expe-
ditiously. That was some 15 months 
ago. It is long past expeditiously, and I 
look forward to seeing this project re-
alized. 
Mr. Chair, I thank the chair and the 
chair 
of 
the 
subcommittee, 
Mr. 
QUIGLEY, for his help on this effort. It 
is an important one for our country. 
Furthermore, this package would provide ci-
vilian Federal employees with a 4.6% cost-of- 
living adjustment—at parity with the raise 
being provided to military personnel—and 
makes DREAMERS eligible to serve as Fed-
eral employees. 
It increases the V.A. Health Care System’s 
budget by nearly $22 billion over last year, 
which will help provide high-quality care to 7.3 
million veterans in our country. 
And it provides the Army Corps of Engi-
neers with $3.5 million to further oyster recov-
ery in the Chesapeake Bay. 
In addition to these priorities for Maryland’s 
Fifth District, there are other critical invest-
ments for which I have advocated for a long 
time. 
These include $400 million in Election Secu-
rity Grants through the Election Assistance 
Commission, which was created under my 
Help America Vote Act Legislation in 2002. 
It also funds a program I’ve championed to 
encourage college students to become non-
partisan poll workers in their communities. 
I was also glad to see the inclusion of $100 
million for the Technology Modernization 
Fund, which was launched under bipartisan 
legislation I led with Leader MCCarthy. 
This will help agencies upgrade technology 
systems so that they can serve americans 
more efficiently and securely. 
Additionally, this package makes a strong 
investment in combatting hunger by providing 
W.I.C. funds to serve more than 6 million peo-
ple and $28.6 billion toward child-nutrition pro-
grams. 
It will also ensure that S.N.A.P. does not run 
out of money in 2023 and can continue help-
ing those with the lowest incomes put food on 
the table. 
Mr. Chair, this is a very solid and robust 
funding package, and it is—as I said—a first 
step in our effort to continue funding govern-
ment and delivering the priorities of the amer-
ican people on time. 
I urge the Senate to match our pace in the 
appropriations process so that we can con-
tinue governing responsibly ‘for the people.’ 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition 
to this en bloc package of amendments. 
These 29 amendments include excess 
funding and policies that expand the 
scope and reach of the Federal Govern-
ment. They do this while also limiting 
our country’s energy options and al-
lowing funding for President Biden’s 
executive order on abortion. 
Again, Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this en bloc package, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. QUIGLEY), who is the chairman of 
the Financial Services and General 
Government Subcommittee. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, last month, 
as the Appropriations Committee con-
sidered the FSGG funding bill, the Su-
preme Court took the unprecedented 
step of stripping American women of a 
constitutional right to decide their 
own reproductive destiny. Extremist 
Justices, inventing flimsy arguments 
against a right that Americans have 
enjoyed for nearly 50 years, opened the 
door for radical legislators to ban abor-
tion. 
This is a crisis, and a crisis means all 
hands are on deck. With my friends,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6852 
July 19, 2022 
Representatives LEE, DEGETTE, and 
FRANKEL, I am offering an amendment 
to ensure that the FSGG bill is in the 
fight. This amendment prohibits any 
Federal funds from my bill from being 
used in contravention to President 
Biden’s executive order on protecting 
access to reproductive healthcare. 
This is not just about the executive 
order itself. It is about the policies and 
recommendations that will result from 
it. The interagency policymaking ef-
fort to address barriers to abortion ac-
cess must include FSGG jurisdiction, 
and Federal agencies must all work to 
swiftly and fully implement solutions 
to these barriers. 
In addition, FSGG has jurisdiction 
over the District of Columbia. Anti- 
abortion extremists go so far as to try 
to tell D.C. taxpayers that they cannot 
make their own decisions about wheth-
er to support access to reproductive 
care. I am here to say that D.C. citi-
zens shouldn’t be bullied by extremists 
pushing an ideological agenda. The 
Federal Government’s place must only 
be to improve access to care in D.C., 
never to tell the citizens of our Na-
tion’s Capital that members of a body 
to which they are not even permitted 
to send a voting representative say 
that they can’t look after their own re-
productive destinies. 
President Biden called for a whole-of- 
government effort to safeguard abor-
tion access. As the branch of govern-
ment charged with the purse strings of 
the United States, it is our duty to join 
that effort. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS). 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of the en bloc pack-
age, which includes my amendment to 
increase funding for the Department of 
Veterans Affairs’ electronic records 
system. 
One of the most insistent casework 
requests I receive is from veterans who 
are unable to receive care due to the 
Department’s records request backlog. 
I have raised with the Department in-
dividual cases, and I have also been 
working with local veterans service or-
ganizations to advocate on behalf of 
their members. Yet, it still takes any-
where from 6 to 8 months to get any-
thing back from the archives. That is 
not acceptable. 
Digitizing veterans’ records will ex-
pedite their requests and improve their 
experience. 
I know first-hand what veterans ex-
perience while on Active Duty. It is our 
responsibility to ensure that they have 
access to the high-quality care and 
services promised to them when they 
swore an oath to protect and serve our 
country. 
Mr. Chair, I urge support for my 
amendment. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship, and the ranking member, as well. 
Let me say that America is going to 
get not a payday but an investment. 
Unlike how my colleagues like to 
characterize the hard work of the ap-
propriators and our chairwoman, this 
is about good-paying jobs, $90 billion in 
transportation. 
This is about tackling hunger and ag-
riculture, some $27 million. 
This is about helping Houston with 
its horrible and yearly confrontation 
with flooding. 
Yes, this is about the issues of En-
ergy. As well, with Financial Services, 
this is about helping our consumers. Of 
course, in Interior, I want to say that 
this is about helping the work that I 
am doing on the Emancipation Trail. 
I am delighted that I also rise to sup-
port all the en blocs. I have amend-
ments in all of them. Particularly, I 
want to emphasize the work that is 
being done through my amendments on 
oversight over the General Land Office 
that has tackled Houston, Harris Coun-
ty, and the region after Hurricane Har-
vey like they are at odds. Our Federal 
money, $4 billion, was supposed to go 
to Harris County and Houston. Houston 
ultimately got zero amount at a cer-
tain stage, and they only gave Harris 
County $800,000 when we are suffering 
with loss of housing and with major 
flooding. 
My amendment will talk about major 
oversight over the GLO and their treat-
ment of local jurisdictions. This plays 
across 
America 
when 
States 
get 
money, and they don’t believe that it 
should go to the local communities. 
Let me also indicate I am glad that 
my human trafficking victims bill is 
in. That provides for SNAP resources 
and to clarify that if you are educating 
a human trafficking victim that is not 
documented, you can clarify for them 
without looking like you are recruiting 
or selling SNAP to let them know that 
they are eligible for it, which is ex-
tremely important. 
Also, I–45, the President of the 
United States issued an equity policy 
that whenever you do major infrastruc-
ture projects, you should look at how 
it impacts historic neighborhoods and 
how it impacts the minority neighbor-
hoods and urban neighborhoods. I–45, a 
major Federal project, has not even 
perceived that to be important. My 
amendment indicates that that should 
be the case. 
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the 
gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield the 
gentlewoman from Texas an additional 
1 minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her gra-
ciousness. 
That is an ongoing issue that we have 
in our community, where the commu-
nities are not taken into consideration 
when the houses are leveled and when 
the flooding is increased by an infra-
structure project that we now have a 
title VI proceeding under that is fund-
ed by Federal dollars. 
Let me also express my appreciation 
for amendments dealing with the Fed-
eral Railroad Administration. Every-
one that knows it has trains. We know 
that it provides part of the supply 
chain. But in our communities, there 
are the crossings, there are the sounds, 
and there are the horns. All we want to 
do is work harmoniously in the over-
sight over the Federal Railroad Admin-
istration to deal with safety and oper-
ations in our communities. That is par-
ticularly important. 
I also want to express appreciation 
for the work my amendments will do 
and that they have been accepted deal-
ing with the issue of historic preserva-
tion, which will include places like 
Freedmen’s 
Town, 
Independence 
Heights, and, of course, the historic 
Third Ward where Emancipation Park 
is. 
Again, the underlying bill is a bill 
that will invest in America. I support 
this legislation and the good work of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. Chair, I ask everyone to support 
that and the amendments included in 
the en bloc. 
Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in a strong support 
of H.R. 8294, the Transportation, Housing and 
Urban Development, Agriculture, Rural Devel-
opment, Energy and Water Development, Fi-
nancial Services and General Government, In-
terior, Environment, Military Construction, and 
Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. 
H.R. 8294 makes key investments in re-
building our nation’s infrastructure, expanding 
research 
innovation, 
combating 
climate 
change, and honoring the sacrifice and com-
mitment of our nation’s veterans. 
The diligent work that produced this com-
prehensive legislation will make a very positive 
impact on so many sectors and activities 
throughout American society. 
Mr. Chair, I also want to voice my strong 
support for En Bloc Amendments No. 2, 3, 6, 
and 7, which incorporates Jackson Lee 
Amendments. 
I thank the Rules Committee and Chairman 
MCGOVERN for making these amendments in 
order and the Appropriations Committee and 
Chairwoman DELAURO for including it in this 
En Bloc Amendment. 
The Jackson Lee amendments are in the 
following Divisions of the bill: 
Division A—Transportation, Housing and 
Urban Development 
Division B—Agriculture 
Division E—Interior and the Environment 
EN BLOC #2 
Jackson Lee Amendment #46 supports the 
work of the National Institute of Food and Ag-
riculture (NIFA) by making a $2,000,000 in-
crease in funding to that office for the purpose 
of supporting agriculture research programs 
particularly at 1890s Institutions, which are 
land grant colleges at 28 Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), as well as 
Hispanic-serving institutions, and other edu-
cational institutions that benefit underrep-
resented communities.

forestry, and other innovations to improve our 
nation’s food production through agricultural

higher education. 
The NIFA was created at the time of the in-
dustrial revolution to ensure that the nation 
would have a sufficient number of working 
farms to provide a reliable supply of domesti-
cally produced food. 
One of ways NIFA achieves its mission is 
by providing research grants to education in-
stitutions, which include 1890s institutions cre-
ated by the Morrill Act of 1890. 
Today, land-grant colleges and universities 
can be found in 18 states, the District of Co-
lumbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The list in-
cludes: 
Alabama A&M University 
Alcorn State University 
Delaware State University 
Florida A&M University 
Fort Valley State University 
Kentucky State University 
Langston University 
Lincoln University 
North Carolina A&T State University 
Prairie View A&M University in Texas 
South Carolina State University 
Southern University System 
Tennessee State University 
Tuskegee University 
University of Arkansas Pine Bluff 
University of Maryland Eastern Shore 
University of the District of Columbia* 
University of the Virgin Islands 
Virginia State University 
West Virginia State University 
HBCUs annually enroll 40% of all African 
American students in 4-year colleges and uni-
versities. HBCUs are prominent among re-
search institutions in fields such as: 
animal sciences 
sustainable agriculture and agriculture eco-
nomics 
toxicology and waste management 
conservation and environmental manage-
ment 
business and industrial development 
biomedical science 
In particular, Jackson Lee Amendment #68 
is necessary to make clear that providing vic-
tims of trafficking access to information about 
their eligibility to receive SNAP benefits does 
not constitute the type of SNAP recruitment 
activities or ‘‘advertising’’ of the SNAP pro-
gram prohibited by the bill and by Section 
4018 of the Agriculture Act of 2014 (Public 
Law No: 113–079). 
Trafficking in humans, and especially do-
mestic child trafficking, has no place in a civ-
ilized society. Those who engage in this illicit 
trade should be prosecuted to the fullest ex-
tent of the law. This House made that clear 
again in 2021 when it passed H.R. 3530, the 
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which 
contained my Sense of the Congress amend-
ment added during the Judiciary Committee 
markup. 
That means we need to ensure that state 
and local law enforcement agencies have the 
tools, resources, and training necessary to 
identify, apprehend, and prosecute criminals 
who ruthless traffic in children and young per-
sons. 
And one of the most effective resources in 
bringing criminals to justice is the cooperation 
and assistance of their victims. 
Perpetrators of crime know that they are 
more likely to evade detection and punishment 
when their victims refuse to assist or cooper-
ate with law enforcement. That is why they 
make it a point to instill fear in their victims— 
for their own safety or that of family and loved 
ones. 
EN BLOC #3 
Jackson Lee Amendment #19 increases and 
decreases HUD’s Office of Inspector General 
account by $1,000,000 with the intent to sup-
port the OIG’s oversight of the Texas General 
Land Office to track the accounting of Emer-
gency Supplemental Disaster Appropriations 
for Hurricane Harvey Mitigation and Recovery 
that Congress approved for the 2017 disaster. 
food and nutrition 
plant and social sciences

Agricultural research programs at HCBUs 
assist people living in densely populated areas 
to learn ways to eliminate food deserts, in-
crease public education about farming, bolster 
appreciation for our nation’s farmers, and pro-
vide new avenues to careers for those grad-
uating with degrees in agriculture who seek to 
enter cutting-edge agricultural research. 
This amendment promotes NIFA’s work with 
agricultural experiment stations, cooperative 
forestry, and other innovations to improve our 
nation’s food production through agricultural 
research, economic analysis, extension, and 
higher education. 
The funds provided by the Jackson Lee 
amendment would support research and edu-
cation for helping urban and suburban com-
munities maximize their green space by turn-
ing it into productive farming resources to sup-
port access to affordable foods. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #47 provides a 
straightforward, important contribution to the 
bill for a goal shared by every Member of this 
body: ending the scourge of human trafficking. 
This amendment provides that: 
None of the funds made available by this 
Act for ‘‘DOMESTIC FOOD PROGRAMS— 
Food & Nutrition Service—Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program’’ may be used in con-
travention of section 107(b) of Division A of 
the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protec-
tion Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7105(b)). 
The effect of this amendment will be to 
make clear that nothing in this bill restricts the 
authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or any 
federal agency head from providing assistance 
and benefits to victims of trafficking under cur-
rent law as authorized by 22 U.S.C. § 7105(b) 
of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Pro-
tection Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 1464, Pub. Law 
106–386). 
Jackson Lee Amendment #20 provides an 
increase of $1,000,000 in assistance to ad-
dress challenges faced by historically dis-
advantaged communities and areas impacted 
by persistent poverty not included in decision 
making when major highway construction 
threatens their homes, businesses, and cul-
turally significant structures. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #21 increases and 
decreases by $1,000,000 the Community De-
velopment Fund and the Community Develop-
ment Block Grant program to address the fair-
ness in the use of Community Development 
Block Grant Disaster funding to repair or re-
place single family homes damaged during 
Hurricane 
Harvey 
to 
ensure 
that 
multi- 
generational homes can house families at doc-
umented pre-disaster capacity. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #22 increases and 
decreases by $1,000,000 the Federal Rail Ad-
ministration Safety and Operation’s account to 
emphasize the need to provide dedicated 
funding to address community engagement on 
safety issues related to railroad crossings in 
urban areas. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #23 prohibits the 
Department of Transportation from using funds 
for Section 106 Transportation construction 
projects in urban areas that have not been de-
termined to meet the statutory and fiduciary 
obligations of the National Historic Preserva-
tion Act (54 USC 306108). 
EN BLOC #6 
Jackson Lee Amendment #57 increases and 
decreases funding for Environmental Pro-
grams and Management by $5 million to high-
light the need to support culturally competent 
federal, state, and local public health and envi-
ronmental protection efforts to address cancer 
clusters impacting overburdened communities 
in the gulf coast region. 
EN BLOC #7 
Jackson Lee Amendment #56 increases and 
decreases funds for the Historic Preservation 
Fund by $3,000,000 with the intent of enhanc-
ing activities for the preservation, restoration, 
and maintenance of nationally significant sites, 
artifacts, and structures through competitive 
grants at the local, state, and federal levels fo-
cusing on projects involving HBCUs, sites and 
stories linked to the Civil Rights movement, 
landmarks associated with communities that 
are historically underrepresented, and sites re-
lated to the histories of Indigenous peoples. 
The Historic Preservation Fund is vital in 
working to preserve nationally significant sites, 
structures, and artifacts. We want the environ-
ment to be safe, but we want the historic envi-
ronment to be preserved for those who are a 
valuable part of the historical story of America. 
It is crucial to the Freedmen’s Town com-
munity in Houston, but it is also crucial to the 
Tulsa story in Oklahoma, the story of Chicago, 
Savannah, New York, and many other States 
where we have systematically ignored the his-
toric preservation of our Nation. Who will tell 
our children the story? I am fighting in Hous-
ton. Others are fighting elsewhere. This 
amendment is to create the historical record, 
the legislative record that we are committed 
to. 
I urge all Members to vote in support of En 
Bloc #2, 3, 6, and 7, and the Jackson Lee 
Amendments. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARSON. Mr. Chair, I rise today in sup-
port of my amendment, co-authored with Con-
gresswoman OMAR, in support of financial lit-
eracy education. The amendment increases 
and decreases the Treasury Salaries and Ex-
penses account by $500,000. This is to en-
courage Treasury to work with the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau to study the best 
models for financial literacy programming and 
assist schools, nonprofits, and localities in de-
veloping their own financial literacy programs 
for young people and families. 
If the pandemic has shown us anything it is 
that our financial well-being is important in 
times of crisis. Therefore, I believe it is impor-
tant to promote and establish financial literacy 
skills for students across our nation to estab-
lish habits that will last a lifetime. Studies have 
shown that 88 percent of Americans believe fi-
nance education should be taught in schools 
and 92 percent of K–12 teachers believe that 
financial education should be taught in school, 
but only 12 percent of teachers actually teach

the subject. Yet as of this year only 22.7 per-
cent of U.S. high school students are guaran-
teed to receive a personal finance education. 
According to the Government Accountability 
Office, giving Americans the information they 
need to make effective financial decisions can 
be key to their well-being and to the country’s 
economic health. The global financial crisis, 
when many borrowers failed to fully under-
stand the risks associated with certain finan-
cial products and currently, the economic 
hardships presented by the sudden disruptions 
caused by the spread of COVID–19, under-
score the need to improve individuals’ financial 
literacy and empower all Americans to make 
informed financial decisions. This is especially 
true for young people as they are earning their 
first paychecks, securing student aid, and es-
tablishing their financial independence. 
I believe America should be leading the 
world with the best-educated students who will 
drive our economic innovation and success. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this 
amendment. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today to urge support for my amendment to 
H.R. 8294, the fiscal year 2023 Transpor-
tation, Housing and Urban Development, Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Energy and Water 
Development, Financial Services and General 
Government, Interior, Environment, Military 
Construction, and Veterans Affairs Appropria-
tions Act, to require funds for the Election As-
sistance Commission to be used to pay for the 
wages of election poll workers. I thank Chairs 
ROSA DELAURO and MIKE QUIGLEY for their 
support of this amendment. 
We are at a crossroads in our nation. Efforts 
to undermine our democracy and perpetuate 
the Big Lie have made the workplace incredi-
bility challenging for election workers. Despite 
these challenges, election workers continue to 
ensure that Americans can vote safely and se-
curely. That is why we must ensure they are 
adequately paid for their contributions. Our 
system of democratic participation cannot 
function without them. 
Last month, I introduced H.R. 8015, the En-
hanced Pay for Election Workers Act along-
side 40 colleagues. The bill creates a new 
grant program to provide states with funding to 
increase election worker wages. This amend-
ment builds off that proposal to highlight the 
need for federal election funds to help pay 
election poll workers adequately. Election 
workers are chronically underpaid, and in-
creased wages will help improve recruitment 
and morale. In turn, this will help all of us by 
ensuring the smooth administration of elec-
tions, which safeguards our democracy. I urge 
a yes vote on this amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendments en bloc offered by 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut. 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I demand 
a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendments en bloc 
offered by the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut will be postponed.

STRENGTHENING THE ABRAHAM 
ACCORDS 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Biden administra-
tion’s efforts to expand and strengthen 
the Abraham Accords. 
When I met with Israeli political and 
military leaders last month, they em-
phasized the importance of regional de-
fense and deterrence against Iran’s ma-
lign activities. 
That is why President Biden’s reaffir-
mation of the United States’ commit-
ment to Israel’s security during his re-
cent trip to the region is so important. 
Our alliance with Israel is built on 
shared values and shared interests, 
which includes strengthening regional 
security and economic opportunity. 
Saudi Arabia’s decision to open its 
airspace to civilian flights to and from 
Israel is a significant step toward re-
gional integration and diplomatic nor-
malization. 
This 
important 
step, 
thanks to President Biden’s diplomatic 
efforts, lays the groundwork for addi-
tional economic, political, and security 
ties between these two countries. 
I commend President Biden for his 
success in building on the Abraham Ac-
cords, and I look forward to working 
with the administration to further 
deepen regional partnerships that ben-
efit Israel’s security. 
f 
THANKING CYREIA SANDLIN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and to 
thank Cyreia Sandlin, a reporter, for 
her decade of service to the greater Sa-
vannah area. 
Cyreia first arrived in Savannah in 
2011 after graduating from the Univer-
sity of Missouri School of Broadcast 
Journalism earlier that year. Since 
then, Cyreia has dedicated herself to 
keeping the people of Savannah in-
formed and educated, serving as an an-
chor 
on 
Savannah’s 
most 
popular 
morning news show. 
Additionally, her focus on commu-
nity news has helped the area’s grow-
ing population maintain its small-town 
kinship. 
Cyreia has also helped her commu-
nity outside of the newsroom. She has 
served as the president of the Telfair 
Museums’ William Jay Society, sat on 
the board of the Frank Callen Boys & 
Girls Club, and volunteered at the Chil-
dren’s Hospital at Memorial Health. 
A dedicated voice in her community, 
Cyreia Sandlin has provided the people 
of Savannah with a reliable source for 
news and information for over a dec-
ade. I thank her for all that she has 
given, and I wish her the best of luck in 
her new position. 
f 
WOMEN VETERANS TASK FORCE 
REAUTHORIZED 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
so very proud to announce that the 
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs 
once again authorized the Women Vet-
erans Task Force, which has been in-
strumental in helping Congress develop 
and pass impactful legislation that is 
greatly improving the lives of women 
veterans across the country. 
Since its establishment in 2019, the 
task force has built a powerful women 
veterans outreach network through 
convening bipartisan meetings with 
community advocates, veterans service 
organizations, stakeholders, and indi-
vidual veterans. 
The Deborah Sampson Act, the task 
force’s signature achievement and one 
of the most comprehensive pieces of 
legislation for women veterans in our 
history, is the result of this direct in-
sight. 
The authorization of the task force 
will further advance our mission to in-
crease the visibility of women veterans 
and promote inclusivity and true eq-
uity for the 2 million women who have 
served our Nation in uniform. 
As chair of the Women Veterans 
Task Force, I am proud to continue our 
work to recognize the service and sac-
rifice of America’s women veterans.

CONGRATULATING JEFFERSON- 
CLARION HEAD START 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
40 years of the Jefferson-Clarion Head 
Start program. 
Since its inception more than 50 
years ago, Head Start has improved the 
lives of more than 32 million children 
and their families. Head Start gives 
every 
child, 
regardless 
of 
cir-
cumstances at birth, a chance to suc-
ceed in school and in life. 
When Head Start was first launched 
in 1965, the idea of providing com-
prehensive health, nutrition, and edu-
cation services to children living in 
poverty was groundbreaking. 
Jefferson-Clarion Head Start is no 
exception. For 40 years they have pro-
vided families and children of all ages 
with 
comprehensive 
education 
and 
health services to income-eligible chil-
dren to ensure that they will be 
healthier and better prepared for suc-
cess in school and life. 
Currently 
Jefferson 
and 
Clarion 
County serves approximately 300 chil-
dren each year across 10 towns and two 
counties. 
Mr. Speaker, Head Start takes a 
comprehensive approach to meeting 
the needs of young children. They focus 
on the whole child and the whole fam-
ily. 
Congratulations to all who work and 
participate 
with 
Jefferson-Clarion 
Head Start. Your work is vital to our 
community. Thank you for going above 
and beyond every day to make sure our 
children get the education they need to 
prepare for their futures.

LGBTQ+ RIGHTS ARE UNDER 
ATTACK 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, between Florida’s 
‘‘don’t say gay or trans’’ legislation 
and Alabama’s ban on gender-affirming 
care for transgender youth, LGBTQ+ 
rights in this country are under at-
tack. 
Unfortunately, these attacks are not 
just limited to the States. Just 25 days 
ago, a rightwing majority overturned 
Roe v. Wade and indicated that contra-
ception and marriage equality are like-
ly next. 
That is why I was so pleased that the 
House passed the Respect for Marriage 
Act today, which would repeal the dis-
criminatory Defense of Marriage Act 
and ensure that marriage equality is 
protected across our country. 
I have always been a strong sup-
porter of LGBTQ+ rights. In 1986, I in-
troduced the first domestic partnership 
legislation in New York State history 
while I was on the city council. We 
need to do everything we can to pro-
tect these fundamental rights. 
f 
WE WILL NOT GO BACK 
(Ms. STANSBURY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, it is 
hard to believe that in the year 2022, I 
rise to defend the right to access con-
traception. That is right, contracep-
tion. 
Why? Because we have a renegade 
Supreme Court that has overturned a 
half century of settled law, stripping 
away our fundamental reproductive 
rights, and made it clear that they 
plan to not stop there. 
In fact, Justice Thomas’ concurring 
opinion in Dobbs makes it clear that 
the Supreme Court has its sights on 
overturning longstanding precedents 
that guarantee the right to access con-
traception and protect the right to 
same-sex marriage, which we just 
voted on. 
These are basic human rights: the 
right to marry, the right to love who 
you love, the right to control your own 
body, the right to control your own 
health, the right to control your own 
family decisions, and your right to pro-
tect your own privacy. 
Let me say it loud, and let me say it 
clear: We will not go back. 
My great-grandmother was born in 
this country before she had the right to 
vote. My mother was a machine oper-
ator and entrepreneur. I stand here 
today as your Congresswoman and your 
committed Congresswoman to say we 
will not go back. These are our bodies, 
our rights, and we will continue to 
fight to protect them. 
BOLSTERING EFFORTS TO BRING 
HOSTAGES 
AND 
WRONGFULLY 
DETAINED UNITED STATES NA-
TIONALS HOME—MESSAGE FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–132) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS) laid before the House the 
following message from the President 
of the United States; which was read 
and, together with the accompanying 
papers, referred to the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and ordered to be print-
ed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), I hereby report that I have 
issued an Executive Order declaring a 
national emergency with respect to 
hostage-taking and the wrongful deten-
tion of United States nationals. 
Hostage-taking and the wrongful de-
tention of United States nationals are 
heinous acts that undermine the rule 
of law. Terrorist organizations, crimi-
nal groups, and other malicious actors 
who take hostages for financial, polit-
ical, or other gain—as well as foreign 
states that engage in the practice of 
wrongful detention, including for polit-
ical leverage or to seek concessions 
from the United States—threaten the 
integrity of the international political 
system and the safety of United States 
nationals and other persons abroad. I 
have determined that hostage-taking 
and the wrongful detention of United 
States nationals abroad constitute an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued. 
JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr.
THE WHITE HOUSE, July 19, 2022.

ELIMINATING 
FEDERAL 
EXCISE 
TAX ON FIREARMS AND AMMU-
NITION 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, several 
weeks ago, I introduced my landmark 
legislation, the RETURN our Constitu-
tional Rights Act, which eliminates 
the Federal excise tax on firearms and 
ammunition 
because 
no 
American 
should be taxed on their enumerated 
constitutional rights. 
Since this unconstitutional tax funds 
Pittman-Robertson conservation pro-
grams, my legislation replaces this 
revenue stream with a more stable 
source 
of 
funding 
by 
redirecting 
unallocated lease revenue generated by 
onshore and offshore energy develop-
ment on Federal lands. Replacing this 
revenue is crucial to ensure Pittman- 
Robertson programs stay alive and 
well. 
While the firearm tax revenue fluc-
tuates annually based on firearms 
sales, it is also subject to the left’s rad-
ical gun control agenda. You see, if we 
allow anti-Second Amendment law-
makers to achieve their dangerous 
dream of an unarmed America, there 
will be no firearms sold, so Pittman- 
Robertson funding will cease to exist, 
threatening wildlife conservation pro-
grams. 
Therefore, the RETURN Act accom-
plishes 
both 
protecting 
Americans’ 
Second Amendment rights and pre-
serving Pittman-Robertson programs. 
We can and must do both.

HEALTHCARE SPENDING DRIVES 
OUR DEBT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
have been coming behind this mike 
every week when we are here, some-
times for half an hour or an hour, and 
I have been basically taking the bark 
off our brothers and sisters on the left 
because of my belief that so much of 
the policy here hurts people. 
I have shown over and over the work-
ing poor are getting poorer, the poor 
are getting poorer, the middle class—I 
mean, last week, I had charts here that 
showed that, in my Phoenix-Scottsdale 
area, we have the highest inflation in 
the continental United States. You get 
to work a month-and-a-half for free 
just because of the change in our infla-
tion index. Even when you plug in any 
salary growth we have had in our mar-
ketplace, you are functionally donat-
ing over a month of labor that you get 
no purchasing power for, no compensa-
tion. That is inflation. 
I have tried in those previous speech-
es to turn to my brothers and sisters in 
the majority, the Democrat side, and 
say: Hey, here are some things we 
could do policy-wise to take on infla-
tion. Inflation is not just a monetary 
issue; it is also things we can do on pol-
icy, the fiscal side. 
I thought I would go to crazy town 
for a moment and show some things 
that are optimistic. The fact of the 
matter is that a lot of them aren’t nec-
essarily right or left. They are just 
technology adoption. 
We have to stop doing the dumb— 
sorry, I think it is a break in decorum 
if I curse on the floor, so you can just 
fill in the blank there—but the virtue 
signaling, like we just did a half hour 
ago on the floor. It is theater. 
I understand the polling numbers are 
miserable for my brothers and sisters 
on the left, so they are going to throw 
out every virtue signaling vote, wheth-
er it is actually legal or mechanically 
sensible or even has any place in re-
ality. So let’s go to what is really 
going on and some things that would 
be good that we could do together. 
First off, we need to understand the 
scale of how much trouble we are in. 
This slide is almost a year old, but the

July 19, 2022 
fact of the matter is that we are in a 
world right now where your govern-
ment is an insurance company with an 
army. It is a way to think about it. We 
are an insurance company with an 
army. 
Then you start to understand, over 
the next 30 years, Medicare and Social 
Security are 100 percent of future debt. 
That future debt, from last year’s CBO 
number, is $112 trillion in today’s 
value. If you add in inflation, our cal-
culations are now blowing through $120 
trillion of borrowed money. 
Now, the fact of the matter is, al-
most every model says we can never 
get there; we blow up long before that. 
But you have to understand, manda-
tory—that is Social Security and Medi-
care and other things that we have 
made that are formula. Over here is the 
defense, and over here are other domes-
tic programs. Only about 13—actually, 
I think this coming year it may be less 
of everything we spend is really—it is 
FBI. It is environment. It is research. 
It is this tiny sliver down here. 
The reality is, what is driving that 
mandatory monster that is consuming 
everything? It is Medicare. About 
three-quarters of all the spending, 
about three-quarters of all the debt 
that is coming, is Medicare. The vast 
majority of Medicare comes out of the 
general fund. It is healthcare costs. 
The brain trust around here—we will 
do things like the ACA, ObamaCare, 
the Republican alternative, Medicare 
for All. They are all financing bills. We 
play games around here. It is about 
who gets subsidized, who has to pay. 
A number of the boards that I am 
going 
to 
show 
today 
are 
about 
healthcare disruption to change not 
who pays but what we pay. 
There is a reason you don’t go back 
to Blockbuster video anymore. There 
was a technology revolution where you 
no longer go wait in line at the local 
strip mall, get a little silver disc, and 
take it home. Half the time, three- 
quarters of the time, you couldn’t get 
the silver disc you wanted because 
somebody else already had it. 
Today, you go home and hit a button, 
and you have dozens of streaming serv-
ices. That is a technology disruption. If 
Blockbuster video had hired enough 
lobbyists, this place would have slowed 
down the internet to make sure Netflix 
couldn’t exist. 
You need to think about what goes 
on here. Let’s start to walk through 
and understand how much trouble we 
really are in. 
This board is a year or 2 old. You 
start to add in. When you do Social Se-
curity and healthcare entitlements, it 
is this line. The rest of the budget is 
actually in decline or flat. Defense is 
down here. You can wipe out every 
dime of defense, and you can’t keep up 
with the growth of the debt being 
caused by Social Security and Medi-
care. 
That is not Republican or Democrat. 
We got old as a society. Does anyone 
ever hear about baby boomers? This 
place basically didn’t figure out baby 
boomers existed until the last couple of 
years. 
It is demographics, and it is hap-
pening 
all 
over 
the 
industrialized 
world. When you look at our numbers— 
and we are working on this right now 
in our office—of what has happened the 
last couple of years, sort of the post- 
COVID baby bust—remember, last year 
was the lowest fertility rate in U.S. 
history. The math is getting really 
ugly. 
I am the ranking Republican over So-
cial Security, and we had the Social 
Security actuary report come out a 
couple of weeks ago, saying: Hey, we 
added a whole year. We now have 11, 12 
years before Social Security runs out 
of cash, and we just live on the reve-
nues. 
But they missed inflation. They also 
screwed up, I believe, on the fertility 
rates, population growth. 
Let’s start to walk through it. If 
healthcare costs are the primary driver 
of U.S. sovereign debt, what can you 
and I do? What could this place do? 
Some of this stuff will not work, but, 
damn it, we need to try. 
We do enough virtue signaling here 
where we say pretty words, and then 
we walk off the floor and say: Well, 
that is never going to actually happen, 
but, damn it, it is a great campaign ad. 
Maybe it is time we start to try to do 
some of the things that are really dif-
ficult. 
Some basic math—first, come down 
to this line. Thirty-three percent of all 
healthcare spending is associated with 
diabetes. That is type 2 and some type 
1, but mostly type 2, 33 percent of all 
healthcare spending and 31 percent of 
all Medicare spending. Why wouldn’t 
you absolutely fixate? 
Look, we won’t call it Operation 
Warp Speed because that had some-
thing to do with Donald Trump, and 
the left despises him, so give it any 
damn name you want. 
But come on, people. If I came to you 
and said 33 percent of all of our 
healthcare spending and 31 percent of 
all Medicare spending is diabetes and 
Medicare is the primary driver of U.S. 
sovereign debt, can’t we hold hands to-
gether and jump and say we are going 
to throw everything we have at this be-
cause we know there has been a break-
through? 
Now, it is only like a half dozen peo-
ple who have been cured of type 1 dia-
betes, and we don’t have any long-term 
data on it, but it is optimism. 
First, I want to go over my frustra-
tion. You will see this as a policy split 
on the way the brains around here 
work differently between my brothers 
and sisters on the left and those of us 
on the right. 
A few weeks ago, this place com-
mitted to give, I think it was $36 bil-
lion—might be 38—but I think I re-
member $36 billion of cash subsidies to 
Big Pharma, which they were railing 
against, saying they are charging too 
much for insulin. 
b 1900 
And the way we are going to stop 
these crazy insulin prices is, we are 
going to give a bunch of cash to the 
very people we think are charging too 
much. 
Does anyone see the absurdity? 
Instead of creating, Hey, we are 
going to incentivize competition. We 
are going to put more people in the 
marketplace. We are going to make the 
systems work—no, because the left is 
addicted to handing out cash. 
Well, it turns out at the same time 
they are doing that, not too far from 
here, in Virginia, there is functionally 
a co-op that had been put together 
years ago that is in construction right 
now that is going to bring a number of 
generic insulins to market at less than 
the new subsidized price. 
And the fact of the matter is, what 
the Democrats did a few weeks ago in 
trying to subsidize Big Pharma’s insu-
lin production, may have blown up 
some of the economics and the financ-
ing behind this. 
Why wouldn’t we have said, for a 
fraction of the money—say we are 
going to set aside some money. We are 
going to help these folks get their per-
mitting, their reviews. We are going to 
actually put FDA reviewers on site as 
they are building so that the day the 
clean rooms are up and ready, it can be 
in production. 
Add competition, not subsidies. And 
it exists. 
And think about this: They are talk-
ing about $55 for a whole box; $30 per 
vial. That is cheaper than the legisla-
tion we passed a few weeks ago where 
we are handing out, what, $36 billion in 
subsidies to Big Pharma. 
You see the craziness around here. 
The virtue signaling was more impor-
tant than actually something that 
made people’s lives better, and actu-
ally added optionality and competi-
tion. 
And this isn’t a Republican or Demo-
crat, this is a solution. But I guess 
there is a hell of a lot more power— 
maybe better fundraising opportuni-
ties—when you are handing $36 billion 
to the very people you rail against and 
then—wink wink, nod nod—here is the 
cash. This place has actually become 
perverse. 
So back to where I was going. I have 
talked about this over and over be-
cause it is one of my personal fixa-
tions. The discussion of an end to insu-
lin, where there has actually been—and 
we saw the first academic article on 
this last December, and we try to track 
it, functionally, every week, we try to 
follow what is going on. 
One of the trials that is actually in 
the FDA phase is on hold right now as 
they are doing some safety efficacy. 
But the fact of the matter is, we have 
a half-dozen Americans, who through a 
stem cell and now the newest ladle is 
they are taking it and apparently tag-
ging it with a CRISPR mechanism, so 
the body doesn’t see it as foreign. The 
elegance of that is that means that 
this mechanism works.

You can do a production line of these 
insulin-producing cells—the islet cells. 
I always get made fun of because I mis-
pronounce that. But the ability to get 
someone’s body to produce insulin 
again, why isn’t there just excitement 
around here? 
Remember, 
33 
percent 
of 
all 
healthcare spending is associated with 
diabetes. If there is a potential, just a 
potential, we can cure our brothers and 
sisters—and yes, it is going to cause all 
sorts of difficult decisions around here 
when you start dealing with type 2. I 
represent the population with the sec-
ond highest per capita population of di-
abetes in the Nation. My Tribal com-
munities, Salt River Pima-Maricopa, 
amazing community; smart, well run. 
And genetically, they are number two 
and their sister Tribe is number one, 
they are a population that has diabe-
tes. 
Next year, we are going to be doing 
the farm bill. Within that there will be 
nutrition support. One of the ways this 
place has always passed the farm sub-
sidy bills and nutrition support is they 
merge them together. 
How about if I came to you and said, 
Let’s just have a really uncomfortable 
conversation instead of the EBT card— 
which is sort of the modern-day food 
stamp. If you have someone who wants 
to sign up for the program, saying to 
them, We are going to try to cure your 
body and get your body to make insu-
lin again, but you have to do the nutri-
tion program with us. And that may be 
2 years of a food box showing up three 
times a day at your house, where it is 
microwavable; Lyft can drop it off. 
But what is more elegant? From a so-
ciety standpoint, what is kinder is, 
Here is an EBT card, go to Jack in the 
Box—I love the onion rings—and you 
can use the EBT card at Jack in the 
Box. 
Is 
that 
really 
making 
society 
healthy? Better? Because we have also 
been doing some experiments in the 
Joint Economic Committee, just trying 
to do math. And starting to realize 
health—the fact that you have a house-
hold member who has severe diabetes 
that may be heading to get a foot cut 
off is a component in income inequal-
ity. I thought that was the holy grail 
to my brothers and sisters on the left. 
Let’s try to make our brothers and sis-
ters healthier. 
And the fact of the matter is, if there 
is something going on out there in the 
literature, why wouldn’t we take some 
of the dollars we spend here, the things 
we put into pure theater, and say—this 
science is already in phase 1. Whether 
it be through tax incentives, whether it 
be through other types of incentives, 
how do we get this into the field? And 
then we, as a body, have to have really 
difficult discussions because you’re not 
going to give someone stem cells to get 
their pancreas to start producing insu-
lin again if they are still morbidly 
obese. 
I mean, this is a big boy conversa-
tion—a big person conversation, know-
ing we are not allowed to use gender 
identity anymore. 
But what is merciful? What would be 
great for the budget? What would be 
great for society? What would be great 
for productivity? 
Because at the end of the speech, my 
hook is going to be inflation is killing 
our country. It is blowing up the future 
of young people. It is eating the sav-
ings of older people. 
How do you get productivity back in 
the society? It is actually disruptions. 
It turns out if you can disrupt things 
like this, you have this virtuous circle. 
And how many times does this body 
even talk about doing big things that 
are actually really good for everyone. 
And if it is true, you would think the 
majority here, who basically controls 
all the power, one of the first things 
they would have done is invited the re-
searchers who had gotten together 
with CRISPR and the stem cell and 
brought them in here and said, Let’s 
have a conversation. 
How real is this? How far is it? 
What 
resources, 
what 
incentives, 
what things could we do in the capital 
stack to get money to invest in it? 
What could we do as a body? 
Because if this is really 33 percent of 
all healthcare spending is associated 
with diabetes. Could you imagine? 
Even if it was a fraction of that popu-
lation of our brothers and sisters, we 
are removed from the suffering. 
I have pitched over and over and over 
to people with power in this body say-
ing, Invite the researchers here. We 
need to understand this. And instead, 
over and over, my brothers and sisters 
on the left seem to say, no. We care 
more. We are going to build more dia-
betes clinics. We are going to build 
more community-based clinics. 
And I am saying the disruption is the 
solution. Cure the damn disease. It is 
going to be hard. There will be things 
that will go wrong. There will be peo-
ple who will call us names because we 
are trying to say, Well, we need to do 
the nutrition, and maybe some exer-
cises, as we get ready to make this in-
vestment in you. But it is the moral 
thing to do for our society, and also 
economically really smart. 
Let alone, also think of the economic 
expansion we get when we live in a so-
ciety where we have so many of our 
brothers and sisters who can’t partici-
pate in the economy because parts of 
their lives are miserable, their health 
issues. 
The 
cure 
is 
the 
solution. 
Patching people up is—it may be great 
virtue signaling but it is not that mer-
ciful. 
So that is sort of the theme. I am 
going to walk through these boards. 
Now, let’s go through other things we 
could do as a society to disrupt. 
So how many times have we all been 
here on the floor and we hear about the 
Build Back Better? Yes, we can spend 
more money and that would be good for 
inflation. 
And 
you 
sit 
there 
and 
scratch your head and say, My elemen-
tary school economics teacher was 
wrong. But they are working on it in 
the Senate. 
We are being told there is a pared 
back version coming. In that pared 
back version, would you believe there 
is a provision that you can’t automate 
the ports in California? Huh? 
You have to back up and think about 
this. So I have a White House—and 
some of my brothers and sisters here 
on the left, inflation isn’t their fault. 
It is not the incredible amounts of 
spending; the trillions of dollars being 
handed out to people without any re-
quirement for them to participate in 
the society or the economy. It is not 
their fault. It is supply chains. And one 
of the first things they really want to 
do is a piece of legislation that would 
restrict automating the ports. Huh? 
There is a worker shortage. There is 
a technology shortage. We have ships 
parked, but the longshoremen write 
checks to Democrats so they will slow 
down—you can’t have it both ways. 
So the fact of the matter is, the lan-
guage is there. I have had a number of 
people look at me and say, Oh, that 
can’t be. No? That slipped in, and it is 
still over there in the Senate draft. 
This is absurd. 
I will argue the disruption is the 
cure. So it is not only automating the 
ports, it is the second half. 
There are some brilliant articles out 
there with some technology now that 
say that the rail spurs in the Port of 
Long Beach, the Port of Los Angeles— 
some of the others—and these are some 
former space engineers that have de-
signed this—you take the container, 
you park it on the electric rail car, and 
you tell it where to go. And it just goes 
automatically to the spur, to drop it 
off, this and that. 
Functionally, you go from an auto-
mated port to an automated travel de-
livery system. That is forward think-
ing. That is policy that is rule set that 
popped that productivity, popped the 
problems in the supply chain. Ta-da. 
You did something positive, and when 
you do that, you also take on inflation. 
And instead, this body is trying to 
stop the very disruptions that would 
make our lives better. They are pan-
dering to a group that writes them a 
check. 
But it exists. I mean, there are fun 
articles about these automated freight 
train cars. And they are electric. You 
just, boom, put the container on it and 
tell it where to go. 
Look, we have a demographic crisis. 
We have trouble with workers. We have 
all these things. The disruption is the 
solution. Do you see any attempt 
around here? Instead, we have debates 
here where we sound like it is still the 
1990s. 
So one of the other battles here is en-
ergy prices. And I have had an ongoing, 
reasonably friendly discussion with a 
Democrat who’s from back East, who is 
a friend—and I will call him a friend: 
Oh, we have to stop hydrocarbon. Oh, 
natural gas isn’t this clean. Oh, David, 
you don’t understand.

Yes, 
natural 
gas 
when 
properly 
burned for energy, those things may be 
40 to 50 percent cleaner than other fuel 
sources, but you have methane leak-
age. 
Okay, I’ll do that with you. 
And we know the methane math on 
the latest calc is like 8.79 to 1 in its 
greenhouse effect if you do the math. 
But it also has—as we know, the new 
math has a much shorter half-life. 
That’s why so many of the global 
warming models from a year or two 
ago are actually wrong because we are 
now recalculating methane. 
But it turns out that some experi-
ments have been going on the last two 
years of, functionally, a solution for 
capturing methane, particularly in oil 
and gas and pipelines. And I am going 
to be a little silly here because it is a 
dirt-cheap solution. It is clay. I think 
it’s a copper-oxidized clay. It’s like a 
sponge for methane. 
Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. 
But there are a couple good academic 
papers saying, Hey, you do realize we 
could functionally take kitty litter, 
pack it into wellheads, pack it into the 
pipe fittings, pack it into the other 
things, and it is a methane sponge. 
Why wouldn’t we take a run at this? 
Instead, the Malthusians around here 
that basically run this place, say, No, 
we are going to restrict ourselves be-
cause, oh, God, we can’t have access to 
this. 
No, the solution is in the disruption. 
I am just excited about this one be-
cause it is super cheap. It is not some 
of the grandiose, build a new regu-
latory body, build an inspection, build 
these huge tankers that sit on top of 
the wellheads and capture the meth-
ane. Turns out it could be functionally 
copper-oxidized kitty litter. 
Does anyone around here read? 
So I have had a proposal here, and for 
anyone who is bored out of their mind, 
go 
to 
Schweikert 
environmental 
crowdsourcing. There is a YouTube 
video I put together a couple years ago 
that basically said, look, we all walk 
around with these super computers in 
our pocket. What if I came to you to-
morrow and said, Instead of the regu-
latory model we use right now to pro-
tect air quality and you can use those 
for water and other things, where func-
tionally you fill out pieces of paper, 
you take them to your local regulatory 
body—your EPA, county air quality, 
whatever you have in your area—and 
they stick it in a file cabinet. 
And everyone knows that file cabi-
nets full of pieces of paper make the 
air quality better, right? No, it’s docu-
mentation so one day someone can sue 
you. 
b 1915 
What would happen if I came to you 
and said they exist today and they are 
not expensive. If you had a couple 
thousand people in your marketplace, a 
few thousand—something like Mari-
copa County, which is huge—had a lit-
tle attachment on their phone and it 
does air quality samples? 
You crowd source the problem. You 
no longer need people filling out pieces 
of paper for their permitting because if 
someone screws up, you catch them im-
mediately. The elegance of this is the 
clowns that may be painting cars in 
their backyard behind your house, they 
are never getting a permit, they are 
never getting caught unless you had a 
crowd source model where the UPS 
driver, the soccer mom, everyone else 
is walking around with a little thing 
attached to their phone or a Bluetooth 
on their car or attached on the side. 
The beauty of these things—they do 
PM10, they do volatile organics. There 
is even one out there, a little panel, 
that actually does radioactive, which 
there was a discussion of putting those 
on UPS vans. 
The solutions are out there. Think of 
how different the world would be. I 
want to open up a motorcycle paint 
shop. I have to go get an engineer to 
stamp my air quality permit. I have to 
go get the scrubbers. I have to do this, 
do this, do this, do this. 
What if the solution is, hey, here are 
the things you have to do. You don’t 
need a permit because the moment you 
screw up, we catch you that same day. 
It is a living. Do any of you use Waze 
when you go driving? It is a living 
crowd source model. These ideas exist 
out there. 
In Detroit where they had the water 
issue. There is a little ring out there 
that is like $39. If you put it under the 
sink, you would have caught it. You 
could have crowd-sourced the informa-
tion and not gone through multibillion 
dollars of misery. The unwillingness of 
this place to understand what century 
we are in. If someone gets bored, take 
a look at that YouTube video, it sort of 
explains the concept. 
For those of us in the West, this is a 
crazy one but it’s worth thinking 
about. Maybe it works, maybe it 
doesn’t. Desalinization. You know we 
know there is a number of desaliniza-
tion plants along the coast of Cali-
fornia. There are even some discussions 
of some in Mexico and other places and 
around the world, but there is always 
an issue of the brine. You have got to 
really spread the brine out, so you 
don’t create intense areas. 
Now, there are some researchers out 
there that are going, hey, that brine— 
did you know, there may be all sorts of 
really neat stuff in that. There may be 
rare earths. As the desalinization plant 
is mining potable water, we could be 
mining the brine for rare earths. 
I am just begging the people around 
here—think—think a little more cre-
atively because this place is absolutely 
dystopian anymore, and there are solu-
tions out there. Is this Republican or 
Democrat? 
I am sure someone will make a con-
tribution to one side or the other and 
then immediately the other side will 
say, oh, that is a Republican idea. The 
fact of the matter is it is worth at least 
understanding. 
It turns out, I have an absolute fas-
cination with carbon capture. There is 
actually a tax credit in those things 
that I am the lead author on that is 
out there in law and other things. The 
break-throughs—it turns out we are 
getting really good at this. 
There is ambient where they are ac-
tually pulling in the air. There is point 
source. There is a power generation 
outside of Houston called an Allam 
cycle where they actually blow up the 
natural gas, and they don’t heat up 
steam to throw the turbine, they use 
the actual gas from the burn. It has no 
smokestack; they capture every bit of 
it. 
We are actually getting really good. 
And all over the world there are re-
searchers spending time on this. There 
was even an amazing paper about 2 
years ago, MIT came up with a 
nanotube electric-charged plate that 
goes on, off, on, off, but it actually 
crashed the cost of capturing—and 
they were doing it ambient. They were 
just blowing air across it, and it 
crashed the energy to do carbon cap-
ture. 
Okay. So my brothers and sisters on 
the left say they are the ones that care 
about the environment. Okay. But we 
are the ones actually doing the policy 
that is practical that works, that we 
don’t actually put ourselves back in 
the stone age, and options to grab the 
carbon. 
There are multiple versions of this. 
This is actually—there is an actual fa-
cility, and I think this one may actu-
ally be in Canada—and, yes, it has 
Gates Foundation money and others. 
This is an active ambient capture. It 
apparently does amazing things. This 
technology is only a couple years old, 
and it is already out of date. 
The technology is moving so fast. 
This isn’t pie in the sky. This isn’t the-
oretical—they exist. What could we do 
policy-wise other than me doing the 45 
on the tax code to try to say, hey, we 
are going to give you a tax credit for 
carbon you have captured if you se-
quester it or put it in concrete or other 
things. 
Are there things we could do? 
This becomes a moment where those 
of us who believe the use of hydro-
carbons is basically keeping a society 
prosperous. My brothers and sisters on 
the left that want to eliminate hydro-
carbons—maybe there is a technology 
solution that brings us together. It is 
worth understanding and working on. 
How many detailed hearings have we 
seen here where we brought in the en-
gineers? 
Not the talking heads, not the lobby-
ists. Not another idiot doing virtue sig-
naling for us, but the actual engineers. 
You know, those types where you have 
to have a conversation where you own 
a calculator. This stuff exists. 
There are other revolutions hap-
pening around us that are incredible 
opportunities—very scary, very won-
derful. We are going to do the farm bill 
next year. I grabbed this article almost 
2 years ago and we have been tracking 
it, and they have had some success. I

July 19, 2022 
am going to geek out for a couple sec-
onds. I will try to do this as quickly 
and lightly as I can. 
Do you all remember your high 
school biology class—C4 plants, C3 
plants. These plants actually need a 
carbon molecule to grow because they 
turned it into a sugar. But the dear 
Lord—there is actually this weird little 
glitch where sometimes the plant grabs 
an oxygen molecule, and it goes: Oh, I 
don’t need this. And it spends its en-
ergy purging the oxygen molecule and 
going back trying to get a carbon. 
What would happen if researchers— 
through a little synthetic biology— 
could tweak it so every time it grabbed 
the carbon? 
Some of the researchers think for 
some plants that could be a 40—now, on 
some of the other articles I am reading 
it is down, in some others plants it 
might be in the 20s, 25, 28, there is a 30. 
Think about it. 
If I had a crop that could grow 40 per-
cent more efficiently—40 percent less 
land, 40 percent less fertilizer, 40 per-
cent less water. The disruption to the 
world—you basically just fed the world 
for the next century. 
Worldwide agriculture functionally 
produces 2.2 times more global green-
house gases—I guess is the term the 
left uses—than every car on Earth—2.2 
times more. So if I had a 40 percent im-
provement, just this synthetic biology 
on plants would be equal to removing 
every car off the face of the Earth. 
Now, we all know the math is going 
to turn out that way—yes, there will be 
lots of people who resist it because 
they are scared of technology. Why 
wouldn’t we have this part of our con-
versation if we care about—those of us 
that live in drought-prone areas—care 
about the environment and care about 
feeding the world. 
This is the future. What is the chance 
anything like this will be part of the 
farm bill next year? 
Pretty much zero because it is a dis-
ruption of technology, and this place 
basically has become a protection 
racket. We protect incumbents. Not in-
cumbent Members of Congress, incum-
bent business models, incumbent asso-
ciations, incumbent bureaucracies. We 
don’t ask them to leap into the future. 
This is the future. 
This one I use on occasion, it is fairly 
snarky, but I think it makes a point. 
How many care about plastic in the 
ocean? Oh, the hands go up. Here in 
D.C. I don’t think we are allowed to use 
plastic straws because everyone knows 
D.C. plastic straws were critical to 
ocean-wide plastic except there is al-
most no plastic from North America in 
the ocean. 
It turns out that 90 percent of the 
plastic in the ocean comes from 10 riv-
ers—8 in Asia, 2 in Africa. Ninety per-
cent of the plastic in the ocean comes 
from 10 rivers, 8 in Asia and 2 in Africa. 
If you actually cared about plastic in 
the ocean, would you be writing your 
checks—or in this case, your credit 
card—to groups that go out and say, we 
are going to go out and capture plastic. 
Great. Or wouldn’t we adjust some of 
our technical foreign aid, our response 
in environmental aid? Saying, we are 
going to go to those 10 rivers, 8 in Asia 
and 2 in Africa, and we are going to do 
something like we are going to create a 
value for the plastic. All of a sudden, I 
have an economic solution. Instead of 
dumping it into the river, we are going 
to collect it. 
See, this is an actual solution. The 
problem is the solution takes away the 
virtue signaling. This place lives on 
telling great stories demonstrating you 
care. It doesn’t give a darn about ac-
tual solutions. Ninety percent of the 
ocean plastic comes from 10 rivers. Go 
to those rivers and let’s deal with it. 
Another 
thought 
experiment—and 
now I am going to do a lot more on 
healthcare. I accept a number of these 
will not work. I accept a number of 
these will make some people angry be-
cause it blows up their business model. 
Remember, money, power, vanity, but 
most of the time D.C. is about the 
money. 
What is the single most powerful 
thing this place could do tomorrow? 
If I said between now and the end of 
the year, I want to have a disruption in 
the cost of healthcare. But, David, that 
is only a few months. D.C. is not capa-
ble of actually setting off a revolution 
in a few months to do something pow-
erful for the price of healthcare. 
What if I came to you tomorrow and 
said: The models say—the research 
says—and this one we have known for 
years and years and years and years— 
16 percent of all healthcare spending is 
actually people not taking their medi-
cine—not taking it properly or not tak-
ing it at all. 
If you have hypertension and you 
don’t take the calcium inhibitor. You 
have high cholesterol; you don’t take 
your statin. It turns out you stroke 
out; you have a heart attack; you cost 
the system a fortune. You stay on your 
meds—actually, they are cheap, they 
are safe, they are very effective. We 
have decades and decades of history on 
their effectiveness; you stay healthy. 
It turns out you could actually just 
say for certain types of health pharma-
ceuticals, put the 99 cent pill cap on it 
that beeps at you when you didn’t open 
it today. If you want to do the fancy 
one—this slide’s a little year or two 
old—there is the fancy one where the 
pill cap actually talks to your phone 
and the phone tells you you didn’t take 
it. 
Mr. Speaker, 16 percent of U.S. 
healthcare costs—it would be $570 bil-
lion a year—so over a half a trillion 
dollars a year. What would happen if 
tomorrow this place got together, and 
said: Hey, for some of our populations 
that we know are likely to miss taking 
their pills, or grandma is having some 
cognitive issues, or someone is just 
busy in their life, let’s spend the 99 
cents on the pill bottle, give them the 
thing that beeps when it is not open. 
If that actually helped even a frac-
tion—maybe it is not 16 percent, but 
what if we were able to do half of that? 
We are talking hundreds of billions of 
dollars. Is this Republican or Demo-
crat? 
It smacks us in the face. There is just 
no constituency here lobbying or writ-
ing us checks for this. 
The solution is in the disruption. The 
disruption is part of the technology. 
b 1930 
Before I do this slide, I need to tell a 
story and see if I can put this in per-
spective. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a reason I seem 
to just annoy the hell out of so many 
folks here because this is a challenge 
to how we think. A few years ago, I was 
reading one of my crazy blogs. It is a 
material science blog, oddly enough. A 
professor, I think it was Duke, I may 
have the university wrong, she had 
been working on this breath biopsy 
where you could put breath across it, 
and it could designate if you have this 
category of flu. The model basically 
said that once we know that category, 
then we can bounce off your medical 
records on your phone, and it can just 
automatically work your antivirals. It 
has been worked on and worked on. 
Think of this, Mr. Speaker. It is a flu 
kazoo. You blow into it, and it can des-
ignate, and the latest models and ex-
periments now are picking up dead can-
cer proteins. When a cancer cell dies, it 
throws off a DNA strip. Some of the 
sensors are getting so good they can 
actually identify them. 
What is the problem with something 
like a breath biopsy? I wish I had some 
brothers and sisters here in the body to 
yell at me. What is the problem with 
it? You blow into it, it bangs up your 
medical records, and it orders your 
antivirals. 
What is the problem with it? It is il-
legal. I am allowing an algorithm to 
prescribe. The Social Security Act says 
I will see a doctor, not an algorithm. 
Now, the fact of the matter is wink, 
wink, nod, nod, if you have something 
with a diabetic pump, they already 
have an algorithm that is prescribing, 
and they have been doing it for years. 
This is not new. If you had it certified 
by the FDA—and there are algorithms 
certified by the FDA—why wouldn’t we 
make them reimbursable? 
Why wouldn’t we do some simple con-
ceptual ideas that you could have tech-
nology in your home medicine cabinet 
that you lick, you spit, you urinate, or 
you blow into—whatever it is—and you 
can monitor your health? That tech-
nology exists today. 
One of the reasons the capital stack 
won’t invest in it is it is functionally 
illegal, and they are basically betting 
that the lobbyist armies will keep it il-
legal here because—I have to be hon-
est—it will change the foot traffic in 
many of our medical facilities. It will 
also save society from the debt implo-
sion that is being driven by future 
healthcare costs. 
So, you have to decide: Are you going 
to save us? Are we going to protect the 
world from disruption?

It is back to my Blockbuster exam-
ple. Should Congress have stopped 
Netflix or streaming and protected the 
renting of the little silver disks? That 
is, 
functionally, 
what 
we 
do 
in 
healthcare. 
There is technology out there com-
ing. The newest version is of folks with 
the Apple watches. The reality is if I 
can know your O2, your temperature, 
your pulse rates, then the algorithm 
may say: Hey, you might have a prob-
lem here. 
What happens with the new versions 
that are stunningly accurate? We have 
math for a number of these that are 
more accurate than a human. Yes, it is 
scary. Disruption always is. If we don’t 
have a disruption in the cost of 
healthcare, then there is a technical 
economic term: We are screwed. 
There are lots of these at-home bi-
opsy-type tests. You have all seen the 
one because it had some great pop cul-
ture last year of an iPhone app where 
you could zoom in on a mole, and the 
algorithm behind it was stunningly ac-
curate: Yes, you need to get that thing 
cut off because that is skin cancer. 
Why aren’t we promoting things 
here? 
Mr. Speaker, I have been at war since 
I got here on telehealth. I had a piece 
of legislation over and over, and I could 
never get a hearing on it for telemedi-
cine, telehealth, until the pandemic 
hit. Then, they functionally took our 
language—I was actually doing this 
with a couple of my Democrat col-
leagues. They took our telehealth ex-
pansion language and put it into law 
for the pandemic. Mr. Speaker, do you 
know that the expansion of telehealth 
goes away the day the pandemic is de-
clared over? 
The argument used to be: Well, 
David, you don’t understand. Seniors 
aren’t going to figure out how to hit 
the button and use FaceTime to talk to 
their doctor. Seniors aren’t going to 
figure out how to put something on 
their wrist or on their chest or blow 
into it. You don’t understand. 
It turns out they were wrong. 
I am looking forward to this body de-
ciding: Are you going to be with the 
lobbyists or the expansion of access to 
healthcare 
through 
telehealth? 
Be-
cause this goes away when the pan-
demic is declared over. 
Here is another example. It is just 
another breath biopsy. These things 
exist. They have put them together. 
What is fascinating is this slide is 
about a year or so old, and it keeps 
going and going. They are working now 
on a number where it is a breath biopsy 
to detect different types of cancers. 
Why doesn’t this place find joy and 
embrace the solutions? 
Mr. Speaker, you start to understand 
that, outside the folks that politicized 
messenger RNA and didn’t understand 
the mechanisms and all those things— 
but we are getting so close to treating 
so many diseases, whether it be my fas-
cination with the stem cell being able 
to set off insulin production again, to 
the fact—I am going to show a number 
of slides here where an incredible num-
ber of the cancers, particularly soft 
cell, we can set off your body to fight 
them now using messenger RNA. We 
are getting right on the cusp. 
If I came to you right now, Mr. 
Speaker, and said: Hey, malaria, cer-
tain cancers, HIV, influenza, heart dis-
ease—the heart disease one is fas-
cinating, teaching your body through a 
messenger RNA how to build certain 
protein stacks to help rebuild heart 
damage. It is here. 
How much discussion do you have in 
this body? How many experts have we 
brought in saying that technology is 
the cure if healthcare is what is chew-
ing us alive? Do we do another bill on 
who is going to get subsidized and who 
has to pay? Do we do another group 
saying: Oh, there is a group out there 
we are not taxing enough. We need 
their cash to throw into Medicare be-
cause we all know the crisis that is 
happening on Medicare financing. 
Why is this place incapable of having 
a conversation about crashing the price 
of healthcare? 
I am going to go through a number of 
these because I collect these. I spend 10 
hours a week on an airplane, and I get 
bored easily. I read a lot of things. I 
keep coming across these. 
This one is really interesting. It is 
immunotherapy for brain cancer. Now, 
it is not the solid tumor, but they 
think they have had amazing success 
on this. This was one of those we didn’t 
think we could do anything with, and 
it 
looks 
like 
there 
is 
an 
immunotherapy for brain cancer. 
Here is one. I have not read the de-
tails on this because I just saw this on 
my flight, I think, a couple of days ago. 
A drug cures 100 percent of colorectal 
cancer patients in a small initial trial. 
Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. 
But this is what we need to be fixating 
on. Instead, what we are going to do 
here is watch the bill that comes from 
the Senate, where they are going to 
blow up the capital stack for the very 
research that finances these sorts of 
things. 
A couple more, just for the fun of it. 
Biotech—and I think this one is al-
ready out in phase one, in multiple 
phase ones; I don’t know if it has 
reached phase two—malaria. You do 
understand, Mr. Speaker, for much of 
the world, malaria is just a brutal, vi-
cious disease. I saw some data a couple 
of months ago. They were only about 30 
percent effective. Believe it or not, 
that is actually terrific because if they 
have hit 30 percent effective, we can 
through 
adjustments 
and 
through 
other factors. Could you imagine the 
amount of misery you could end in the 
world? They could get a 50 percent ef-
fective vaccine for malaria. 
Instead, we will do certain types of 
foreign aid. Instead, it turns out one of 
the most powerful things we could do 
for the world is our intellectual prop-
erty, fixing what we incentivize, and it 
is not handouts of cash. It is to fix the 
regulatory model here, fix the capital 
stacks, fix the tax incentive, and you 
do amazing things for the world. 
I did a presentation on sickle cell 
anemia last year, and I got a little over 
the top on getting a little technical. I 
used to have about a dozen slides on 
this one. But it turns out we think we 
know how to do a certain type of gene 
editing 
with 
a 
couple 
of 
other 
optionalities for sickle cell anemia, 
and this one is out there in trials. 
Isn’t that a moral thing to do? The 
fact of the matter is, do you try to help 
people maintain their misery? Or when 
you actually see data that says there is 
a path, do you pursue the cure? 
My argument here is the cure is bet-
ter for us as a society financially, pro-
ductivity-wise. Just from a purely eth-
ical and moral standpoint, removing 
someone’s misery is a pretty neat 
thing to do. 
This is a heart disease one. I just 
found it fascinating that through a 
functioning CAR T, which is the deriv-
ative of the mRNA, you are setting off 
your body. In this case, instead of it 
going after a disease, it is actually re-
pairing damage. I think this one is 
coming out of the Boston area. There is 
a reason that these folks have Nobel 
Prizes. 
When you start to understand these 
infectious diseases, herpes, diabetes, 
the other things, we are on the cusp of 
having cures, and the misery that I be-
lieve the last 16 months of really bad 
policy here have brought to this coun-
try, the damage inflation is doing, the 
damage that is going on at the border 
of my State, the homelessness, the 
fentanyl, imagine, Mr. Speaker, if this 
place would set aside some of the vir-
tue signaling legislation—oh, this is 
going to get the other side in the next 
legislation; oh, that just writes a great 
ad—and you brought in the engineers 
and experts in the different areas that 
we all claim to pretend we know some-
thing about and say: Here is what the 
future looks like, and if we get it right, 
the future is amazing. 
A little while ago, Mr. Speaker, you 
saw a little girl behind me. I have a 6- 
year-old. Two weeks ago, out of no-
where, my phone rang, and the birth 
mother of my little girl had a little 
boy. Now, my wife and I have a little 
boy. I have a 3-week-old. 
It is my primary reason for running 
again. I have to find a way to beat this 
body into submission to understand 
there are good things out there, but it 
doesn’t work into our current political 
construct. It doesn’t work in the way 
this place raises political money or 
keeps certain friends. The cures are 
disruptive, and disruption is the future. 
Disruption makes society healthier, 
better, wealthier, and more productive. 
That productivity solves the inflation 
problem, and it solves so many other 
things. 
How do we move this body to stop 
being terrified of its own shadow and 
saying, screw it, we are going to do 
what is right, not necessarily what is 
easy or political?

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
CHANGING MINDSET ON MENTAL 
HEALTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about mental health in 
general and the need for a different 
mindset about mental health and care 
in this country specifically. I stand up 
tonight for the countless family mem-
bers, friends, and neighbors across the 
country as they endure struggles with 
mental health, either for themselves or 
for a family member. 
The number of Americans battling 
mental illness or disorder is not small. 
In fact, over one-half of adults will deal 
with mental health issues, and one in 
five children has or will have a debili-
tating mental illness. 
Suicide is now ranked as the second 
leading cause of death among children 
ages 10 to 14. Think about that: Suicide 
is the second leading cause of death. 
This is more than simply heart-
breaking. We have a problem. That is 
nearly one death every 11 minutes. 
Suicide is a tragic outcome for peo-
ple dealing with mental crises, but 
across the country, there are so many 
dealing in other ways, especially in the 
midst of this pandemic: working par-
ents trying to make it through the day 
juggling; parents not working, trying 
to find ways to make ends meet; kids 
in remote school losing the oppor-
tunity for the social-emotional learn-
ing that is so critical for their develop-
ment; and families juggling remote 
work and remote school at the same 
time. All of these have contributed to 
what is truly a mental health crisis in 
the country. 
In fact, as we think about it, in the 
same way that young kids and babies 
born during the Depression were for-
ever known as Depression babies, it is 
very likely that this generation endur-
ing the pandemic will be COVID babies 
throughout their lives. It will have an 
impact. 
b 1945 
Beyond that we have the issues of 
mass violence. I live in Highland Park. 
Two weeks ago, we experienced some-
thing that no community should ever 
have to go through, but, unfortunately, 
too many communities have and con-
tinue to do so. 
Highland Park, Uvalde, we can go 
back to Sandy Hook, and so many oth-
ers, it is too long a list to give a com-
prehensive naming of every single com-
munity that has suffered from mass vi-
olence. 
But, at its core, there is something 
about these kids committing and per-
petrating these heinous crimes, mon-
strous crimes—if we can reach them at 
an earlier age, maybe we can reduce 
some of that violence. 
Nor is this an exhaustive list of all 
the things, all the aspects of mental 
health that affect people. 
We know that the pandemic has 
made all of us painfully aware of the 
inadequacies and inequalities of our 
mental health system. Too late in the 
process, our system steps in to deal 
with crises, rather than working on 
helping people have a strong and con-
fident, healthful life and tackle chal-
lenges as they occur. We should be pro-
viding holistic mental healthcare and 
provide support early and often. 
At the baseline, Americans are expe-
riencing anxiety and depression at 
higher rates, and the number of serv-
ices available just aren’t keeping up, 
putting a crisis on top of a crisis. 
For those already suffering from 
mental health issues, the pandemic has 
increased their symptoms, and experts 
worry that we will deal with the 
stressors and effects long after the offi-
cial end of this pandemic. 
Everywhere I go, in my district, and 
around the country, I hear stories, 
some heartbreaking, some just simply 
frustrating, about people’s struggles 
getting care for themselves and their 
loved ones. It is not a new problem. 
In fact, sharing just a couple of per-
sonal stories, my first experience of 
tragedy in the context of mental 
health, my best friend as a young child 
in elementary school, was a boy named 
David Segal. He was special, kind 
heart, a brilliant young man. As he 
aged, we moved apart in middle school. 
And then I learned that, at age 21, he 
took his own life. 
His parents were told that he felt as 
if he was locked in a box. He was so 
smart, and he could see the possibili-
ties available to his friends. He wanted 
more than anything else what he saw 
everyone else had, but he knew that it 
would never be available to him be-
cause of the box in which he was locked 
in. His pain was unbearable and, at 21, 
he took his life. 
Years later, I lost a cousin, Jeff, 
whose pain was also all-consuming. He 
tried many times to escape his pain. 
His family tried to help. We all tried to 
help. He sought therapy, but, again, 
that pain was so all-consuming that, 
ultimately, as a relatively young man, 
he died by suicide. 
Let me come back to the present mo-
ment. I have heard from the Ann & 
Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of 
Chicago that the pandemic has in-
creased the severity of the mental 
health crisis in children. 
During the pandemic, suicide at-
tempts jumped from a pre-pandemic 
level of two to three per month to two 
to three each and every day. Before the 
pandemic, Lurie Children’s would get 
maybe 50 calls a week for new appoint-
ments. At the height of the pandemic, 
they were receiving 50 calls every sin-
gle day. 
A third of clinicians are reporting a 
3-month wait time for an appointment, 
if they even have the room to begin 
with. In many places, the wait is much, 
much longer. This massive mismatch 
of supply and demand impacts the 
quality of care those with appoint-
ments are able to receive. 
Providers have empathy and compas-
sion fatigue, emotional exhaustion, and 
are less personal and less connected 
with their patients. 
Older Americans, some of the most 
vulnerable in our society, are at an in-
creased risk. High levels of isolation 
increase their risk of depression, cog-
nitive decline, and dementia. Already, 
20 percent—20 percent of those 55 or 
older typically experience some form of 
anxiety and depression to severe cog-
nitive impairment. 
Additionally, mental health does not 
only afflict those who have been diag-
nosed, it touches many other parts of 
our society. In 2008, Thomas R. Insel, 
then the leader of the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health, estimated that 
mental illness costs our economy about 
$193 billion—$193 billion each year in 
lost earnings. 
8.4 million Americans are providing 
about 32 hours of uncompensated care 
per 
week 
to 
those 
with 
mental 
healthcare needs, whether family or 
friends. 
Leaving 
mental 
illness 
unaddressed results in the increased in-
carceration of people with unmet men-
tal health needs. Those dealing with 
stressors related to mental health are 
left more susceptible to the overuse of 
drugs and alcohol. 
Despite the pervasiveness of mental 
health issues, less than half of adults 
with any mental health condition re-
ceived treatment in 2020. For Ameri-
cans of color, the rate of those getting 
treatment is even less than the na-
tional average. 
I find the current landscape of men-
tal health in America simply unaccept-
able. Every day we fail to take strong 
action to bolster mental healthcare 
services is another day closer to failing 
our friends, our family, our neighbors. 
That is why making access to the ap-
propriate 
mental 
health 
resources 
cheaper and easier is critical. 
I want to share with you one example 
of how the mental health crisis affects 
one of our most important population 
groups, our youth. 
Last year, I received a letter from a 
high school senior outlining her find-
ings about the disparities in mental 
health resources at her school. She 
highlighted the value placed on new 
gym flooring and new scoreboards, but 
the lack of investment in mental 
health counselors. 
She shared that they lost a classmate 
early in the year to suicide. She had 
also become more aware of so-called 
suicide websites and social media’s in-
fluence 
on 
our 
children’s 
mental 
health. 
I applaud the initiative of that high 
schooler writing to me and voicing her 
concern. Each of us has a responsibility 
to not only reach out for help, but to 
advocate for our neighbors who feel 
powerless and are left to struggle.

Another story I want to share is that 
of a dear, young, beautiful woman, 19- 
year-old Orli Sheffey from my town. 
Orli was a light that shined brightly. 
In fact, her name means, my light. 
She was a tenacious journalist and 
beloved friend with a passion for the 
pursuit of truth and justice. She 
strongly believed in the need to provide 
mental health services, to the point 
where she was training to provide con-
fidential peer counseling services to 
her classmates. 
Sufficient mental health services 
possibly could have saved Orli’s life. 
Orli’s time with us is not about how 
she left us, but it is about the impact 
she made while she was here, an impact 
that is still felt by so many today. 
No parent should lose their child at 
such a young age. 
We also lost Brian Kroeter’s younger 
sister, Katie, who died by suicide at 25. 
She was completing her master’s de-
gree in social work and was active in 
the community with programs like 
Meals on Wheels. The family has car-
ried on Katie’s memory through their 
suicide prevention advocacy work and 
Brian’s participation in the Bank of 
America Chicago Marathon in honor of 
his sister. 
Our unmet health needs reach from 
our youth to our Nation’s heroes. When 
it comes to veterans who defend our 
Nation and our freedom, we are losing 
22 to suicide every day. 
When it comes to our cops and fire-
fighters, we fail to recognize that their 
on-the-job trauma is crushing to their 
mental health and well-being. 
Jeff Smith was a Metropolitan police 
officer whose family lives in my dis-
trict. He was dispatched to the U.S. 
Capitol on January 6 and suffered inju-
ries, both visible and not, in defending 
us, in defending me that very day. His 
father shared with me that those inju-
ries and the combination of the stigma 
around mental health and the lack of 
access to care contributed to his ter-
rible loss. 
We must do better if we want to 
honor Officer Jeff Smith. We must do 
better if we want to honor our vet-
erans, if we want to honor Orli Sheffey, 
and if we want to honor all those we 
have lost to terrible mental health 
issues of all stripes. 
Fortunately, I have some positive 
news to share that is giving me hope 
and optimism about this mental health 
crisis. Here in the House, we passed the 
Restoring Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act of 2022 to holistically 
address American’s mental health and 
crisis care needs. 
One program I am glad this legisla-
tion will help strengthen is the Na-
tional 
Suicide 
Prevention 
Hotline, 
which is now 988. Moving to the 988 
phone number is a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity for America to strengthen 
and expand an existing lifeline to ev-
eryone and ensure that everyone is 
aware of this new service. 
The nationwide number will allow 
people to call or text a trained crisis 
counselor who can provide critical 
help, whether it is thoughts of suicide, 
mental health, or a substance use cri-
sis. No matter where you are in the 
country, a well-resourced 988 line will 
be able to: 
Connect a person in a mental health 
crisis to a trained counselor who can 
address their immediate needs and help 
connect them to ongoing care. 
Mitigate healthcare spending with 
more cost-effective early intervention. 
Help reduce the use of law enforce-
ment to treat mental health issues. 
Meet the rising need for crisis inter-
vention on a grand scale and, impor-
tantly, help end the stigma toward 
these seeking or accessing mental 
healthcare. 
The creation and launch of 988 fills 
me with hope and optimism that this 
will not be the last action we take. We 
will have to make sure that mental 
health resources are adequately funded 
for Americans and our healthcare pro-
viders, and properly managed if we 
want to see proper success. 
I will continue to fight for the belief 
that 
access 
to 
affordable 
quality 
healthcare is our right for every Amer-
ican, not just a reserved privilege for a 
select few. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), 
a dear friend and colleague. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, our Nation 
can be characterized by many great 
traits, hard work, discipline, grit, dedi-
cation, 
determination, 
selflessness, 
bravery, courage, strength, and a quest 
for success. 
We have a rugged streak of individ-
ualism, a desire to get things done by 
any means necessary, even if it means 
going it alone. These are admirable 
American traits and have made us who 
we are. But they are also why we are 
where we are on mental health. 
We Americans find it so difficult to 
ask for help; to show people we need 
support; to recognize that maybe we 
should not always go it alone. 
Our Nation is facing a mental health 
crisis, one which the unprecedented 
stress and uncertainty of the pandemic 
has forced into plain view, demanding 
to be addressed, to be seen, to be 
helped. And that, perhaps, may be the 
silver lining of the pandemic; that we 
have finally woken up and taken notice 
of this epidemic in our country. 
Just think about it: Healthcare pro-
viders were on the front lines of treat-
ing COVID–19 through waves and waves 
of patients, selflessly putting the needs 
of everyone else before themselves. In 
the early waves, when COVID–19 was 
still new, they were the only ones 
present to hold the hands of countless 
people as they passed from this world. 
Teachers, historically underpaid and 
overworked, putting together lesson 
plans to keep our children learning, 
while under the pressure of, what if my 
school is next? How will I protect my 
kids? As they see that yet another 
school is the recipient of thoughts and 
prayers. 
No occupation is spared. Law en-
forcement, firefighters, dentists, vet-
erinarians, farmers. 
Young people just beginning their 
lives thrown for a loop by the pan-
demic—milestones they and their fami-
lies had looked forward to, delayed or 
canceled, not being able to see friends 
and family members in person, the anx-
iety of entering a world changed al-
most overnight, trying to find a new 
normal. 
Parents, who served triple duty, care-
taker, teacher, breadwinner, all while 
trying to keep their families safe and 
healthy. 
We have all experienced grief and 
loss in one way or another over the last 
3 years. Some of us lost family and 
friends; some lost businesses or their 
health, and some of us experienced ex-
treme isolation, anxiety, and stress. 
But we all experienced something. 
Our strength as Americans isn’t just 
rooted in our individual discipline, self-
lessness, bravery, or courage, but in 
our collective ability to take care of 
one another. 
b 2000 
That is why I am so passionate about 
mental healthcare, making it more ac-
cessible, affordable, and available. 
During last year’s appropriations 
bill, I successfully fought for an in-
crease of $530 million for the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration, our most important Fed-
eral agency for supporting mental 
health and combating the addiction 
crisis. 
For our healthcare providers who 
have for so long taken care of us with 
so little support for their own care, I 
introduced the Dr. Lorna Breen Health 
Care Provider Protection Act, a bill 
that provides funding to reduce and 
prevent suicide, burnout, and mental 
and 
behavioral 
health 
conditions 
among healthcare professionals. I am 
very proud to say that it passed 
through the Senate and has been 
signed into law by President Biden. 
The bill is named for Dr. Lorna 
Breen, an emergency room doctor, who 
worked on the front lines of the pan-
demic and died by suicide in the spring 
of 2020. I am so proud to say that this 
bill was signed by President Biden this 
past spring. 
For students on college campuses, I 
have introduced and passed through 
the 
House 
the 
Enhancing 
Mental 
Health 
and 
Suicide 
Prevention 
Through Campus Planning Act, focus-
ing 
on 
promoting 
positive 
mental 
health among college students, and en-
couraging college leaders to engage in 
comprehensive planning efforts to pre-
vent suicide on college campuses. I am 
now focused on getting that through 
the Senate and signed into law. 
During this time of extreme stress 
for our young people, our colleges and 
universities need resources to reach 
out to students and to better support 
their mental health. 
Our young children have, unfortu-
nately, not been spared from the men-
tal health crisis. Suicide rates in young

children have been climbing, and the 
leading method has become by hang-
ing, with information found online. 
There is no reason for young children 
to be able to find directions on how to 
tie a noose on YouTube. I have been 
working to hold YouTube accountable 
and to bring down those videos. 
Our children deserve to grow up in a 
world that encourages them to be both 
strong and determined and able to ask 
for help and lean on their support sys-
tems. We all deserve that. 
Finally, we must make sure that our 
mental health professionals are re-
spected, that people are encouraged to 
go into that profession, and that that 
profession is fairly compensated. 
We have a shortage of mental health 
professionals that is hurting our coun-
try, hurting our communities. We, as 
individuals, and together as commu-
nities, are so much stronger when we 
have support systems in place to rein-
force our strength, to help us bounce 
back, and to be resilient. 
We can do this, but we have to work 
together. We have to admit our vulner-
abilities, and we have to put all poli-
tics aside as we work on this critical 
issue. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Thank you for your 
remarkable words, for sharing your 
perspective and expressing compassion 
I think we can all share. 
It is now my privilege to recognize 
my friend from Michigan, Representa-
tive ELISSA SLOTKIN. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Thank you, Rep-
resentative SCHNEIDER, for your leader-
ship. 
I rise today to honor the struggle 
that so many parents who must do the 
unimaginable have gone through, to 
grieve the loss of a child. As an Army 
wife and a former CIA officer who 
worked alongside the military on three 
tours in Iraq, I have watched many 
parents send their kids off to war, and, 
unfortunately, many did not return. 
For the families left behind, not only 
does the hole in their hearts never 
heal, but the ripple effect of that loss is 
also vast. The Tragedy Assistance Pro-
gram for Survivors, or TAPS, esti-
mates that for every Active Duty serv-
icemember killed in Afghanistan and 
Iraq, six family members are signifi-
cantly impacted. This is the dev-
astating collateral impact of combat. 
But our communities in the United 
States, our high schools and colleges, 
are not supposed to be war zones. For 
many of us adults, we look back fondly 
on those years as a time for liberation 
and new opportunities for work, study, 
and play, for learning new things, and 
for growing up. 
So when a parent sends their child 
into the world full of hopes and dreams 
for the future, they do so with visions 
of challenging classes that expand 
their horizons, friendships that will de-
fine their lives, Saturday tailgates, and 
spring break in sunshine. 
Most importantly, they send them off 
with the full and complete assumption 
that they will safely come back home. 
But what we don’t often think about 
is the incredible crisis of mental illness 
and emotional turmoil that so many 
young people today endure. 
Our students are struggling. They are 
fighting internal battles that even 
their closest friends and their parents 
do not see until it is much too late. 
Even before the pandemic up-ended 
our lives, we were already facing a 
mental health crisis for young people. 
At this point, crisis is not the right 
word. It is not strong enough. 
Mental health experts and research-
ers use the term epidemic to describe 
where we are with mental health chal-
lenges facing U.S. high school and col-
lege students. 
According to the National College 
Health Assessment, the most common 
mental health issues facing adolescents 
are depression, anxiety, suicidal idea-
tion and intent, eating disorders, and 
substance abuse. 
It is not easy getting help for any of 
those, navigating scarce mental health 
resources as a newly independent and 
struggling young adult. 
Even if a student tries to take steps 
to get help, there is a tremendous lack 
of services in our community, in our 
colleges, at our universities. On college 
campuses, the ratio of certified coun-
selors to students is generally between 
1 to 1,000 or 1 to 2,000 for small and 
moderate-size schools and 1 to 2,000 or 
3,000 to 5,000 for large universities. 
Far too often, the outcome is tragic 
as it has been for dear friends and even 
some of my colleagues here in Congress 
who have lost their children to mental 
health issues. 
In the past year and a half, one of my 
superintendents, Dr. Bob Shaner, a Ma-
rine veteran, he and his family lost 
their son in his freshman year of col-
lege. More recently, my friend, Steve 
Sheffey and the Sheffey family lost 
their beloved daughter, Orli, a young 
woman who wanted to change the 
world. 
It has become so common for me to 
get those terrible calls that it is nearly 
commonplace. It is, therefore, up to us 
to make sure we do something to 
change the system so that we honor 
their legacy. But we need to start early 
because we know that the problem 
doesn’t just appear in college or after 
high school. 
In my district in Michigan, one coun-
ty alone has had a 300 percent increase 
in demand for child psychiatric serv-
ices in the past 2 years and virtually no 
inpatient beds to offer them. It is not 
just the sheer volume of demand that 
has increased but also the acuity of 
distress for individual patients. 
Right now, in our country when it 
comes to mental health and young peo-
ple, there is a tsunami of need and only 
sandbags to meet it. 
You may know the now infamous 
name of a community in my district: 
Oxford, Michigan. In November of 2021, 
Oxford joined the terrible club that no 
one wants to be a part of, the list of 
districts where a school shooting has 
taken place. 
Like we have seen so many times in 
the past, the tragedy in Oxford is root-
ed in the toxic combination of mental 
health issues and access to weapons. 
Because of that, four students are dead 
and a community, including the police, 
fire, first responders, and teachers who 
were in the building that day are for-
ever traumatized. 
We must do better for the students of 
Oxford, for Orli, for every student and 
every parent. We must train providers 
in trauma-based care, increase access 
to mental healthcare services, treat 
mental illness like physical health so 
that we understand that the issues and 
ailments that affect us from the neck 
up are just as important as the ones 
that affect us from the neck down. 
We must improve insurance coverage 
for mental health services and reframe 
the entire conversation around what it 
really means to be healthy. The tasks 
are daunting, but the consequences of 
inaction, the collateral damage of this 
battle, are even greater. 
In closing, I offer a prayer often re-
cited when mourning the loss of a 
child: 
May it bring comfort to the hearts of those 
who grieve, and may it inspire all of us to 
keep their memories in the forefront of our 
work. 
A good person, though taken from us too 
soon, will rest in peace. 
For honor in old age, does not come from 
the length of life. 
Honor in old age does not come from the 
length of years. 
Understanding is the gray hair of human-
ity. 
A blameless life is ripeness of age. 
Perfection in limited years is like living 
for many years. 
So a good person, though taken from us 
too soon, will rest in peace. 
Let us, then, with peace of mind, let that 
good soul rest. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Thank you, Rep-

We have a national crisis. It needs a 
national response. We are a caring Na-
tion. It is reflected in the outreach 
across the Nation when a community is 
struck by tragedy, whether it is a mass 
shooting or a flood, hurricane, what-
ever the case may be. 
We see it in the response of individ-
uals lending a helping hand when they 
see someone fall on a curb or down a 
stair. It is who we are as a people. We 
need to extend that when we think 
about our mental health crisis and 
mental healthcare. We have to do so 
much to try to address the stigma. 
In the same way, if you think of a 
world-class athlete who is trying to 
achieve their highest potential, no one 
says going to seek assistance of a 
coach or advice of a friend is a short-
coming. 
When it comes to dealing with the 
challenges of life, too often that out-
reach for assistance, that simple ask, 
help me get through this moment, isn’t 
made because people are afraid of how 
they will be judged. Yet, even if we ad-
dress the stigma, we still have the

challenge of access as we talked here 
tonight—not 
enough 
providers, 
not 
enough quality services. 
Everyone in this country deserves ac-
cess to quality, affordable, and avail-
able care. We need to make sure that 
we are investing in training providers 
to provide services across our country 
and making sure that those services 
are available at a price that people can 
truly afford. 
We need to recognize that care for 
our mental health is every bit as im-
portant as care for our physical health. 
Think about it. If a child is diagnosed 
with cancer at a young age, we have 
poured billions of dollars into research 
to try to cure those cancers, and we are 
investing thousands, if not millions of 
dollars, in treating individuals and 
having great results. Kids with cancer 
today have a much higher likelihood of 
beating that cancer back and reaching 
their full potential. 
The same is true for diseases we 
might face in middle age or even treat-
ing our seniors. We are working so hard 
to address that. We need to do the 
same for mental health and mental 
healthcare. 
We need to recognize that the care 
for a challenge, a mental health chal-
lenge, is every bit as real and deserves 
every bit as much investment as the 
care for a physical health challenge. 
We are a caring Nation. We know we 
have a crisis. I am hopeful that this 
body will continue to do its work to 
try to address this crisis for the people 
we represent. 
I am grateful for the great words, 
kind words, insightful words, compas-
sionate words of my colleagues, and I 
am thankful for the work of this body. 
With that, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
talk about a variety of issues tonight. 
I will start one more time. I direct this 
talk not only to the Chair, not only to 
my colleagues in the legislature, but 
also the press corps that normally 
doesn’t cover this because I think I am 
going to touch on some stories that 
ought to appear in the press corps but 
for whatever reason they don’t. 
The first thing, and I have addressed 
it several times from this microphone, 
is what is our goal in Ukraine, okay? 
It would seem to me a good goal 
would be to end the war. We have a lot 
of Ukrainian troops who have died; we 
have a lot of Russian troops who have 
died; we have a lot of Ukrainian civil-
ians who have died; and it seems to me 
that every week or month that the war 
goes by, those numbers get greater and 
greater. 
Not only that, but particularly Rus-
sia is also a country with access to hor-
rific weapons, and every week or 
month that goes by, the chances that 
eventually some horrific weapons will 
have to be used goes up. 
b 2015 
I will also point out with regard to 
these two countries, not that losing 
any young life isn’t a tragedy, but it 
would seem to me there would be spe-
cial tragedies in these countries be-
cause both countries have low birth 
rates and declining numbers of young 
people. For two countries that have 
been around—I believe Ukraine has 
been—for millennia, we would kind of 
like to see these countries continue to 
exist into the future. 
Of 
sizable 
countries 
around 
the 
world, Ukraine has the second lowest 
birthrate, trailing only South Korea. 
There are also people who emigrate 
from Ukraine. In any event, I would 
think one of the primary goals of 
Ukraine is to make sure that they 
hang onto the young people they have 
left. 
Russia is in a similar situation. They 
also have a low birthrate. I repeated 
this story about 7 months ago before 
this war began. I was at the San Diego 
sector of our southern border, and San 
Diego is only one tiny sector of a large 
border, and it was only talking about 
the week or month that I was there, 
but in any event, at that time, the sec-
ond biggest nationality crossing our 
border came from Russia, which kind 
of surprised me. 
So not only do they have a low birth-
rate in Russia, we have a lot of people 
emigrating. It would seem to me a pri-
mary goal of the governments of both 
Russia and Ukraine is to make sure the 
few young people they have left don’t 
die in a war. 
Now, I do not know what President 
Biden’s goal here is in this war. I try to 
talk to some Democrat colleagues; I 
try to talk to people who should know 
President Biden. I think he himself 
may be a little bit mixed on the situa-
tion, but the press corps ought to be 
calling upon him and saying: What is 
your goal in this war? Is our goal to 
end the war and perhaps give President 
Putin an off-ramp; give Mr. Zelenskyy 
an off-ramp; find a way for both to de-
clare some sort of victory and stop the 
carnage? Or is our goal to continue on 
for another 6 months or year or 2 years, 
and we don’t care if another 5,000 or 
10,000 
or 
15,000 
Russian 
or 
15,000 
Ukrainian troops die; not to mention 
the monetary damages that take place 
when you have a war in your country? 
I would like to know where President 
Biden stands on this. We collectively 
have not had a decent briefing for con-
gressional Members since March 31. 
And given that we have been asked to 
give tens of millions of dollars to 
Ukraine—this week we were asked to 
affirm or accede in the policy of adding 
Sweden and Finland to NATO—I don’t 
think it is too much to ask that the ad-
ministration invite its key Cabinet 
members over here, as they did in Feb-
ruary and March, and let us know 
where the Biden administration stands 
on this war. 
I don’t think we have such a great re-
lationship right now with Russia that 
we can moderate a conclusion to the 
war, but I think perhaps Israel, perhaps 
Turkey, perhaps some other country 
should do that, and perhaps we could 
grease the skids a little bit. 
I mean, I realize back home right 
now everybody is focusing on inflation, 
but I will tell you if something bad 
happens in Ukraine, people are going to 
be focusing on that very, very quickly. 
It would be a lot better if we wrapped 
up this war. I know there are hard feel-
ings that will probably last for genera-
tions, but nevertheless I think the 
United States had very good relations 
with Russia only a few months ago. It 
would be good if we were able to wrap 
up this war, and it would be good if 
President Biden, if it was clear that we 
knew that his administration was 
working his way toward that. 
So, again, I ask the press corps to 
kind of lean in a little bit on President 
Biden, find out where he is. I ask my 
Democratic colleagues in particular, 
insofar as they have access to the ad-
ministration, to point out that it 
would be good to end this war, good to 
find countries that would mediate end-
ing this war, and insofar as people on 
that side of the aisle get to see Presi-
dent Biden, carry that message to him. 
VITAMIN D AND COVID 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Another topic that 
I have addressed before from this 
microphone but haven’t talked about 
for a couple months, so I am going to 
bring up again is that of vitamin D. 
People know I have talked about it be-
fore, but it bothers me that the House 
Select 
Subcommittee 
on 
the 
Coronavirus Crisis has not really ad-
dressed this issue. 
The most recent study that came out 
was that done by an Israeli researcher, 
and in that study, it indicated that if 
you had inadequate amounts of vita-
min D, which I believe he described as 
20 nanograms per milliliter, that you 
were 11 times more likely to die of 
COVID than if you had adequate 
amounts. 
If you break it down by race—and I 
don’t like it when we break things out 
by race, but I am going to do it for 
these purposes—it is even scarier in 
that studies show that 35 percent of the 
White population is inadequate in vita-
min D, 57 percent Hispanic, and 85 per-
cent Black, which means having an 
adequate amount of vitamin D in your 
system should be a huge priority for 
people of color. 
I think the COVID committee ought 
to have a hearing solely on vitamin D. 
We ought to find out, given the tril-
lions of dollars we have thrown at 
COVID and billions of dollars we have 
thrown at trying to solve this problem, 
why the public health establishment 
has not talked about vitamin D like 
they should. They may say we don’t 
know whether this is a matter of cau-
sation or a matter of correlation, but if

that is so, we should certainly be doing 
more studies on this matter, because I 
think it is possible that hundreds of 
thousands of lives could have been 
saved if we began to promote vitamin 
D when it appeared to be the cure, as it 
appeared before the vaccines were even 
invented. Nevertheless, to this day, it 
is not discussed. 
The next question that the com-
mittee ought to look at is why are we 
not routinely testing people who are at 
risk for vitamin D deficiency? I would 
think anytime anybody over 65 went to 
a doctor today, they should be tested 
for vitamin D. Now, some people say 
you can take vitamin D without get-
ting a test, which is true, but my per-
sonal 
experience 
in 
telling 
people 
about vitamin D is if they take a test 
right now, say the low level of ade-
quate is about 20 nanograms per milli-
liter, if somebody goes and takes a test 
and they wind up being a 12 or 8 or 7, 
they immediately go out and take vita-
min D because they have the result of 
the test that says you have got big 
trouble coming if you don’t take more 
vitamin D. Having the test specific to 
that individual is much more relevant 
than just a doctor saying it wouldn’t be 
a bad idea to take vitamin D. 
I do believe we would save a lot of 
lives if that was done. As I understand 
it, you can get an online vitamin D 
test for about $40, so it shouldn’t be a 
cost-prohibitive thing. Given the tril-
lions of dollars we put at it, we should 
even be paying for the test. But if we 
don’t, individuals should be encouraged 
at getting those tests. 
I do believe vitamin D is good for 
other things. It is good for bone health, 
another reason why people should be 
taking it. There is really no downside. 
Again, people back home that I know 
or even experts in the field begin to 
wonder if the reason we don’t push vi-
tamin D is because you can pay $20 for 
a bottle from Walgreens or CVS and 
there is not a lot of money to be made, 
and they seem to be more in favor of 
trying antidotes that will make money 
for somebody—there have been billion-
aires made on this disease—rather than 
focusing on vitamin D. 
I really beg the committee to look 
into it a little bit more, get some ex-
perts there. Even though this pandemic 
seems to be on the downside, hopefully 
we will be ready for a different sort of 
pandemic in the future. So I encourage 
the COVID committee to spend a little 
time looking at vitamin D because 
they could have cut the number of peo-
ple who died maybe in half. 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
next issue that maybe has bored the 
press by now, but they shouldn’t stop 
reporting on it, is what is going on on 
the southern border. 
We recently got the estimated num-
ber of migrants remaining in the inte-
rior who crossed the southern border 
for June. The good news is it is down a 
little bit from May and April, and it is 
expected to be down because June is 
such a hot month, fewer people cross 
our border. 
But if you look at June of this year, 
about 142,000 migrants remained in the 
interior. Of those 142,000, 50,000 are 
what they call got-aways, which means 
the Border Patrol didn’t even touch 
them. We didn’t even have a perfunc-
tory interview with them. They just 
came across the border, which should 
be particularly scary. 
What I want to point out, though, is 
that almost 150,000 from this June is 
compared to 79,000 last June. So we 
have gone from 79,000, which was a cri-
sis at the time, to 142,000. Two Junes 
ago, under another administration, we 
were around 9,000. So when we go from 
9,000 people a month to 79,000 people a 
month to 142,000 people a month, that 
should be a banner headline in every 
newspaper around the country. 
Now, I know the newspapers don’t 
like to do anything that would make 
the current administration look bad, 
but there is a reason why people don’t 
subscribe to newspapers anymore or 
don’t listen to the news at night, and 
that is they caught onto the idea that 
you are not going to be well informed 
if you read the local newspaper or turn 
on the news at night. 
Again, I will repeat those numbers: 
9,000 people in June of 2020 migrants 
crossing the border. We go from 9,000 to 
79,000 to 142,000. Massive increases. In 
addition to that, as we know, almost 
all these people who cross the border 
paid $5,000 or $10,000 or $20,000 to the 
Mexican drug cartels. I have been at 
the border about eight times. Every 
time I am down there, the Border Pa-
trol tells me they think the Mexican 
drug cartels are making more money 
letting people across the border than 
they are selling drugs. 
This brings another thing which 
hasn’t been brought up enough, our 
poor neighbor to the south, Mexico, is 
right now in very, very bad shape due 
to the strength of the drug cartels, and 
part of that is our inability to close 
our border. We are making the Mexican 
drug cartels wealthier and wealthier 
and wealthier with all their crime, 
with all their corruption. I think the 
United States, just as we refuse to en-
force our border, we refuse to stop tak-
ing illegal drugs crossing the southern 
border, and as a result we are making 
Mexico a complete mess. 
I beg my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle to express some interest in 
the flood of people coming here. I beg 
our newspapers to begin to report these 
monthly numbers with the banner 
headlines that they deserve so America 
can know what is really going on here. 
DRUG OVERDOSES IN AMERICA 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Related to the bor-
der, speaking of numbers, every year 
we come out with new numbers of the 
number of people who die of drug 
overdoses in this country, and that is 
something that has been underpub-
licized. 
When I first got this job 7 years ago, 
about 57,000 people died every year of 
drug overdoses. We are now at 107,000. 
Twice as many people die of drug 
overdoses every year as died in 12 years 
in Vietnam. That is another story that 
should be banner headlines, and every 
newspaper reporter in this country or 
cable news reporter ought to be asking 
politicians: What are you going to do? 
Why is Congress not doing something 
to save the 107,000 lives a year? 
It is a huge national problem. And, 
again, I don’t like to talk about race, 
but if you look at the last 4 years, par-
ticularly the number of Black men who 
die of drug overdoses is just going 
through the roof. I mean, normally we 
are always, particularly the Demo-
cratic Party, are always so eager to 
point out if there is a difference in sta-
tistics from one race to the other. Here 
there is a significant difference. They 
don’t even talk about it. I am not sure 
what causes it. Normally they would 
attribute prejudice. I don’t think that 
is it. I think to a certain extent it is 
police being less active than they have 
in the past, the judicial system not 
putting drug dealers in prison because 
we are all antiprison right now. 
But in any event, when you have 
107,000 people die every year, isn’t it 
something we ought to be talking 
about, both in this Chamber and on the 
nightly news? 
SPENDING IN CONGRESS 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
next issue we should be talking about 
more is the overall level of spending 
that is going on in this institution. I 
think it was very predicted when the 
first bills passed when President Biden 
took office—and then we had the infra-
structure bill; between those two bills 
we are looking at, I believe, over $3 
trillion—that it would lead to infla-
tion. 
But, again, the press corps, maybe 
because the press corps doesn’t like to 
talk about numbers, does not like to 
talk about the size of the increase in 
spending. Now, it is a lot easier to 
break an economy than it is to put it 
back together. 
Since the inflation was caused by ex-
cessive spending, I think the only way 
to get a handle on things is to not 
spend so much. 
We will, this week, be voting on a va-
riety of bills to fund the government, 
beginning October 1. I have not seen 
the press corps report what I think is 
enough on the size of the increase in 
those bills. It would seem to me we 
should go back to the days of sequester 
where routinely you were seeing these 
bills go up by 0 percent, 1 percent, 2 
percent. 
What do we have in the bills we are 
going to vote on this week? We have a 
transportation and housing bill, up 12 
percent. We have an agriculture and 
rural development bill up 8 percent. We 
have an energy and water bill up 6.4 
percent. Financial services up 17 per-
cent. Interior and the environment, up 
18 percent. Military construction and 
VA up 18 percent.

Again and again, what we are seeing 
here is just fiscal irresponsibility. It is 
just throwing more gasoline on the fire 
of inflation. 
I think the press corps, if they were 
responsible, should be asking Congress 
whether these numbers could be closer 
to 1 or 2 percent, which is where we 
should work toward. 
I think, quite frankly, Republicans 
during appropriations should be com-
ing forth and saying that we would like 
to see these numbers at 1 or 2 percent. 
If we are ever going to get our economy 
back, we can’t continue down this path 
of excessive spending or the amount of 
inflation is just going to continue to go 
up and up. 
The final spending vote we had today 
was on the National Park Foundation. 
I love the national parks. It wasn’t a 
huge spending bill by the standards of 
what we do around here, but it was a 
300 percent increase. Almost everybody 
in this body voted for it because who 
wants to be against the national parks. 
Think about that, a 300 percent in-
crease. 
I hope the press corps wakes up a lit-
tle and decides to report on the indi-
vidual lines of these budgets, how 
much the spending is going up line by 
line and the overall increases in spend-
ing in each of the packages. 
I will deal with one more issue here 
tonight that I think ought to be cov-
ered constantly but is covered nowhere 
near as much. 
I think so many of the problems that 
we deal with in society, or at least the 
people back home feel are part of the 
problem, are caused by the breakdown 
of the family. I think America used to 
have very strong families in the for-
ties, fifties, and early sixties. The 
breakup in the family did not just hap-
pen. It happened because we began with 
a welfare system in the 1960s that, 
quite frankly, put nonnuclear families 
in a position that sometimes was bet-
ter off than a married couple, depend-
ing upon their situation. 
In any event, we went from a situa-
tion in which the people born without 
a mom and dad at home rocketed up 
between the early sixties to about 40 
percent, went down a little, and has 
gone back up to 40 percent since the 
welfare reform of the 1990s. 
I find a lot of people in my age brack-
et think it is going to be very tough for 
the next generation, and when they 
talk about being tough on the next 
generation, above all, they talk about 
the breakdown of the family. 
I have pointed out before that Black 
Lives Matter—an organization that 
people should run from but apparently 
has been embraced by too many people 
in the majority party and some people 
in the minority party—originally came 
out saying they wanted to disrupt the 
traditional nuclear family. I would be 
very concerned when an organization 
that claims on their website that they 
want to disrupt the traditional nuclear 
family is received positively around 
here. 
I know some people will say that 
Black Lives Matter is a diffuse organi-
zation, and just because the founders 
say they want to disrupt the nuclear 
family doesn’t mean every segment of 
Black Lives Matter wants to disrupt 
the nuclear family. But I would feel 
better if more people came down to the 
well and boldly said: I am in favor of 
strengthening the nuclear family; I 
don’t care if I happen to have my pic-
ture taken next to Black Lives Matter. 
I haven’t seen that happen. 
You might say, what is the nature of 
the marriage penalty? I will tell you 
where to begin to look. I would look at 
some of my local administrators of 
low-income housing. I think particu-
larly 42 housing, which is newer hous-
ing, is frequently superior to other 
housing. I would ask people about that 
in your neighborhoods, my colleagues, 
and see what type of incentives we 
have when we have new housing, new 
apartments going up, some of them 
quite lavish, better than the old apart-
ments that other people have to rent. 
Is that a good or bad thing? 
I would ask the clerks in grocery 
stores, as far as the expensive food that 
people are buying, if they are more 
being provided for by the government 
than provided for within the family. 
I would ask tax accountants about 
the earned income tax credit and some 
of the perverse incentives that are in-
volved in the earned income tax credit. 
I would also ask the tax accountants 
what people are doing with the earned 
income tax credits when they get that 
$6,000, $7,000, or $9,000 check once a 
year. 
I think when we get done asking 
these questions, we can ask ourselves if 
we want to continue programs that 
prevent children from having both par-
ents, particularly a dad, at home. I 
think there are so many problems in 
our society that would, to a certain ex-
tent, be improved if only we got back 
to what we would call old-fashioned, 
traditional family values. 
In any event, those are some of the 
issues that I think the press corps 
ought to be covering but aren’t cov-
ering and some of the issues that I 
think our body ought to be addressing 
that we are not addressing. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the wonderful 
staff for being here so late, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

what You have done. Today, teach our 
Senators to do things Your way, em-
bracing Your precepts and walking in 
Your path. Remind them that the nar-
row and difficult road leads to life and 
true freedom. 
Lord, as You teach them to live with 
integrity, replace their anxiety with 
calm, their confusion with clarity, and 
their doubts with certainty. May Your

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today 
is going to be an exceedingly busy and 
productive day on the Senate floor. 
Later today, after months of hard 
work and countless rounds of talks, 
Senators will vote to move forward on 
legislation 
that 
our 
country 
des-
perately needs—a chips bill that will 
lower costs, boost American manufac-
turing, and protect American security 
interests. 
Over the past 24 hours, both parties 
have continued working on the final 
details to the chips package that we 
will vote on later today. We will see if 
Members can come to an agreement on 
adding other provisions to the bill, but 
the bottom line is that we must come 
up with a package that is capable of 
passing this Chamber without delay. 
We must act as soon as we can to make 
sure we bring chip manufacturing back 
to America because our Nation’s secu-
rity depends on it. 
I urge my colleagues, if you want to 
fight inflation, if you want to create 
more good-paying jobs right here at 
home, if you want to keep America 
strong and competitive and innovative 
in the 21st century so that we can lead 
the economy as we did in the 20th, then 
this chips bill is the way to go. It is a 
very important bill. 
The chips shortage is one of the most 
damaging trends over the past few 
years. This technology, which origi-
nated, of course, right here in America, 
is the bedrock for much of modern life. 
Cars, refrigerators, cell phones, med-
ical devices—they all depend on chips 
to function. But when chips suddenly 
become scarce, as is the case today, the 
consequences are felt across the board 
by companies but also by average 
Americans. 
Americans 
see 
higher 
prices and longer wait times for all 
sorts of consumer goods because of this 
chip shortage. 
It wasn’t always this way, but thanks 
to the pandemic, this crisis is now 
being felt across the country. 
A quarter century ago, the United 
States was the undisputed leader in 
global chip production. In 1990, we pro-
duced 40 percent—nearly 40 percent—of 
the world’s semiconductors. Today, 
that figure is going down to 12 percent 
and will get even lower if we don’t pass 
this bill. We have a chance of leading 
the way on chip manufacturing once 
again if we pass this legislation. 
As we speak, the country’s most im-
portant chip manufacturers—these are

American companies—are waiting on 
congressional 
action—mostly 
Amer-
ican companies, not all. But they are 
waiting on congressional action before 
they decide where to invest in chip pro-
duction. From Asia to Europe, other 
nations have copied the American play-
book and have already invested billions 
of dollars to incentivize chip manufac-
turers to come to them. If we do not 
match the efforts of other countries to 
boost chip manufacturing, the con-
sequences could be dire and long-last-
ing. Countless good-paying American 
jobs are on the line. Costs that Ameri-
cans are now paying—higher costs— 
getting them lowered is now on the 
line. Billions of dollars in economic ac-
tivity is on the line, and our national 
security is on the line. 
As Secretary Austin and Secretary 
Raimondo told us last week, our eco-
nomic and national security depends 
on our ability to invest in the tech-
nologies of today and tomorrow. 
If we allow other nations to lead the 
way on chips, the days of America lead-
ing the world in scientific innovation, 
the days of America being the leading 
economic and military power in the 
world may actually be over. Nobody 
wants that. So vote for this bill. This is 
a future none of us wants to see. 
Again, vote for this bill. I urge my 
colleagues 
to 
move 
forward 
later 
today. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, now on judges, as we 
move forward on legislation to boost 
chip manufacturing, there is a lot to do 
on the nominations front too. 
Let me start with a very important 
number: 73. Let me say that again: 73. 
That is the total number of judges the 
Senate will, hopefully, have confirmed 
by the end of today. A year and a half 
into President Biden’s term, that is 
nothing short of a towering achieve-
ment. 
Here is how we reach that figure 
today: Later this morning, the Senate 
will vote to confirm Nina Nin-Yuen 
Wang as U.S. district court judge for 
the District of Colorado. This after-
noon, we will hold a confirmation vote 
on Nancy Maldonado for the Northern 
District of Illinois. I expect these well- 
qualified nominees to move through 
this Chamber with bipartisan support. 
And as soon as today, the Senate will 
also vote on the confirmation of Judge 
Michelle Childs of South Carolina to 
serve on the DC Circuit. 
Judge Childs will be the fourth—only 
the fourth—Black woman to ever sit on 
the DC Circuit, founded nearly 130 
years ago. Confirming this remarkable 
jurist is an important step to reversing 
generations of underrepresentation and 
making our courts better reflect the 
Nation. 
Let’s not forget, after the Supreme 
Court, the DC Court of Appeals is the 
most important Federal court in the 
country, regularly taking up cases that 
the Supreme Court is unable to con-
sider. 
Oftentimes, 
the 
DC 
Circuit 
makes the final decision on some of the 
most important cases in the country, 
particularly those involving Congress 
and the executive branch. It is a really 
important court. Remember, the Su-
preme Court only hears about 75 cases 
a year. So lots of very vital cases are 
decided by this circuit court of appeals. 
The judges who preside on the DC 
Circuit must be individuals of high 
character and unassailable qualifica-
tion, and that is precisely what we 
have in Judge Childs. She is a native of 
Detroit, a graduate of the Universities 
of South Florida, South Carolina, and 
Duke. Judge Childs built a reputation 
as both a trailblazing jurist and a 
staunch defender of the Constitution. 
She already commands strong bipar-
tisan support from both sides of the 
aisle, and I thank my Democratic and 
Republican colleagues for their support 
of the judge. 
As the Senate continues to fulfill its 
duty 
of 
confirming 
well-qualified 
judges, we hope the trailblazers of 
today can be closer to the norm of to-
morrow. We want our courts to include 
more women, more diverse candidates, 
both 
demographically 
and 
profes-
sionally, and more judges who come 
from unique backgrounds. Our courts, 
our democracy, and the American peo-
ple will be better off through these ef-
forts. There is not a doubt in my mind 
Judge Childs will help advance this 
noble goal. I look forward to her final 
confirmation. 
MARRIAGE EQUALITY 
Mr. President, finally, on marriage 
equality, this week, the House of Rep-
resentatives is scheduled to vote on 
two pieces of legislation that will en-
shrine some of the most fundamental 
rights that every American should 
enjoy: the right to marriage equality 
and the access to contraceptives. 
These votes come at a disturbing and 
dangerous moment for our country. A 
few weeks ago, the Supreme Court con-
cluded one of its worst and most de-
structive terms in history. 
Casting aside a half century of prece-
dent, a conservative majority on the 
Court 
shamefully 
and 
disgustingly 
eliminated the fundamental right of 
women to make their own decisions re-
garding their bodies. It is a decision 
that will live in infamy, an indelible 
stain on the legacy of the highest 
Court in the land that will not be 
erased. 
Alarmingly, the nightmare is very 
likely far from over. The MAGA Repub-
licans on the Court and the MAGA 
radicals who are taking over the Re-
publican Party have made it abun-
dantly clear they are not satisfied with 
repealing Roe. As I said, it is an indel-
ible stain, and the attempts by some to 
talk it away and erase it will not hap-
pen because it is such a bad stain. 
Anyway, the MAGA Republicans who 
are taking over the Republican Party 
have made it abundantly clear they are 
not satisfied with repealing Roe. As 
many have openly said, they have 
turned their attention now to the 
Obergefell decision and marriage equal-
ity. 
A few days ago, the junior Senator 
from Texas said the Supreme Court’s 
decision protecting marriage equality 
was ‘‘clearly wrong’’ and argued that 
partisan State legislatures should de-
termine who can and cannot get mar-
ried. Other MAGA Republicans have 
echoed the same thing. We need to 
think—we need to pause and think 
about how unhinged—unhinged—this 
idea is. 
Fresh off repealing the rights of 
every single woman in this country, 
MAGA Republicans now want to reopen 
the doors for discrimination and hatred 
targeted 
against 
same-sex 
couples. 
Even one of the Justices on the Su-
preme Court indicated in his opinion 
that gay marriage should be reconsid-
ered by the courts. 
This is the future that MAGA Repub-
licans clamor for: one where women 
and same-sex couples are branded as 
second-class citizens. If they succeed, 
they will take our country down a dark 
path from which there may be no re-
turn, although we will fight it tooth 
and nail. Every single American should 
stand 
in 
opposition 
against 
these 
MAGA Republican views. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, a 
year ago today, with prices already ris-
ing, President Biden said that high in-
flation was ‘‘expected to be tem-
porary.’’ 
One 
year 
later, 
after 
9 
straight months of inflation over 6 per-
cent, the prices are now rising at their 
fastest rate in over 40 years. 
Last week’s inflation report con-
firmed on paper what working families 
have been feeling for a year: President 
Biden’s prediction was dead wrong. In-
stead, prices are skyrocketing, and 
paychecks aren’t keeping up. Real 
hourly wages are declining at break-
neck speeds, dropping a full 1 percent 
last month alone. The average Amer-
ican worker got a full 1-percent pay cut 
just last month alone due to inflation. 
The Biden administration has tried 
to claim that we are ‘‘stronger eco-
nomically than we have been in his-
tory.’’ That is what the White House 
Press Secretary told reporters earlier 
this month. Kentuckians know that is 
utterly absurd. They know the opposite 
is true. In my home State, the average 
household now spends over $600 more— 
$600 more—every month compared to 
the day President Biden took his oath 
of office. That comes out to more than 
$7,300 a year. 
Inflation is pushing Kentucky fami-
lies to the brink. As a result, food bank

demand is rising, and shelves are run-
ning low. A soup kitchen in Campbell 
County put out an urgent call for vol-
unteers as surging visitors threaten to 
overwhelm its limited staff. As the ex-
ecutive director said in an interview, 
with ‘‘inflation and milk [at] $4 a gal-
lon,’’ they see people who have ‘‘never 
needed help before.’’ 
I have received messages from con-
stituents all over the Commonwealth 
facing the same crisis: Prices are rising 
while real wages fall. 
A 59-year-old from Louisville tells 
me she has worked two jobs since she 
graduated from college in 1987 to save 
for retirement. Now she is afraid she 
will ‘‘lose [her] hard-earned money . . . 
due to this inflation.’’ 
Another 
constituent 
in 
Hopkins 
County tells me he worked 60 hours a 
week for years to afford the home he 
bought recently. Now, with rising 
prices, he ‘‘can’t even support [his] 
family anymore’’ and might lose his 
new house as well. 
A couple in Lexington in their late 
seventies spends almost all of their 
fixed income on rent, utilities, and 
medical bills. They are struggling to 
find enough left over for food. ‘‘What 
are we suppose[d] to do?’’ they ask. 
Families across Kentucky are asking 
themselves the same question every 
day. The answer from Washington 
Democrats is alarming but not sur-
prising. After spending us into infla-
tion, they now want to tax us into re-
cession. I can’t think of a more reck-
less response for struggling Kentuck-
ians. 
DISCLOSE ACT 
Mr. President, now on another mat-
ter, unfortunately, inflation and tax 
hikes don’t exhaust Washington Demo-
crats’ capacity to make trouble for the 
American people. Today, the Rules 
Committee will be reviewing the DIS-
CLOSE Act—a seemingly annual lib-
eral 
attempt 
to 
restrict 
political 
speech by threatening the privacy of 
those who see things differently from 
them. 
For decades, Washington Democrats 
have looked for opportunities to ex-
pand the reach of unelected Federal bu-
reaucrats to police the political activi-
ties of private citizens. The DISCLOSE 
Act is just one more example of a trou-
bling tendency on today’s political left: 
Quit trying to play by the rules and de-
manding a change in the rules instead. 
The DISCLOSE Act was a key pillar 
of 
the 
sweeping 
election 
takeover 
Democrats have been trying to pass 
since they lost an election in 2016. For 
years, they have failed to convince ma-
jorities in Congress or among the 
American people that the future of our 
democracy requires the playing field to 
be tilted toward their side. 
But failing to overhaul the system 
hasn’t stopped liberals from sabotaging 
the guardrails that protect political 
speech from the inside. Remember, the 
naming and shaming of conservatives 
for ‘‘wrong think’’ was practically an 
official policy back in the Obama- 
Biden IRS. More recently, leaked con-
fidential taxpayer information from 
the IRS wound up in the hands of lib-
eral publications just in time for tax 
debates on the Hill. Now Washington 
Democrats want to grease the skids for 
more. Needless to say, whether or not 
disclosure was legal hasn’t been a pri-
mary concern for the liberals behind 
these leaks in recent years. 
But to the extent our Democratic 
colleagues want to have a conversation 
about laws on the books, donations to 
political action committees are al-
ready disclosed to the FEC. So are do-
nations to 501(c)(4) organizations aimed 
at influencing Federal elections. In 
other words, existing law has already 
thought of this. 
What our colleagues want to do is 
newly expand the definition of political 
speech and stretch disclosure require-
ments. They want Americans who op-
pose them politically to have to either 
abandon their privacy or abandon the 
public square. They want conservatives 
to choose between their livelihoods or 
their political beliefs. The chilling ef-
fect on Americans’ speech is by design, 
not by coincidence. 
The same liberal groups who urged 
radical mobs to intimidate the Su-
preme Court Justices outside their pri-
vate family homes and the same elect-
ed Democratic officials who refuse to 
condemn that illegal intimidation now 
want to systematically ‘‘out’’ ordinary 
private citizens’ private donations and 
political speech. 
The pro-intimidation, anti-privacy 
modern left wants less privacy sur-
rounding the First Amendment. It 
doesn’t take much connecting the dots 
to see why. But even the liberal ACLU 
warned years ago that what liberals 
want 
here 
‘‘unconstitutionally 
in-
fringes on freedom of political speech 
and the right to associational pri-
vacy.’’ That is the ACLU, on the same 
side as myself. 
More recently, the NAACP and the 
ACLU teamed up in fighting State- 
level public disclosure laws at the Su-
preme Court—on the same side, again, 
as me and several other Republican 
Senators. They reiterated the land-
mark ruling in NAACP v. Alabama 
that ‘‘inviolability of privacy in group 
association 
may 
in 
many 
cir-
cumstances be indispensable to preser-
vation of freedom of association, par-
ticularly where a group espouses dis-
sident beliefs.’’ 
Ah, but today’s Democrats disagree. 
Over the years, Washington Democrats 
have cycled through a litany of reasons 
for passing their sweeping takeover of 
American elections. But while the ra-
tionales changed constantly, the goal 
never changes one inch: more power for 
elected Democrats to rewrite the rules 
of their own elections and more power 
for the political left to harass and in-
timidate citizens who don’t think like 
them. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, June in-
flation numbers came out last Wednes-
day, and, as is typical for the Biden 
Presidency, they weren’t good. In fact, 
they were spectacularly bad. Inflation 
hit 9.1 percent in June, the worst infla-
tion since November of 1981. The last 
time inflation was this bad, America 
was still a year and a half away from 
finding out whether Han Solo would 
survive his time in carbonite. 
Mr. President, we all know how we 
got here. In large part, it was via a 
Democratic 
spending 
spree. 
When 
Democrats took office in January 2021, 
Congress had just passed a fifth bipar-
tisan COVID relief bill that met essen-
tially 
all 
current 
pressing 
COVID 
needs. But now that they were in 
charge, Democrats were eager to get 
spending. So they passed a massive $1.9 
trillion piece of legislation under the 
guise of COVID relief that flooded the 
economy with unnecessary government 
money, and, as expected, the economy 
overheated as a result. 
Even worse, despite steadily climbing 
inflation in the wake of their bill, 
Democrats seemed incapable of learn-
ing from their mistake. In fact, they 
spent last fall attempting to double 
down on the strategy that helped get 
us into this mess in the first place. 
Fortunately, their plans for a second 
spending spree failed last December. 
But it has become clear that they are 
not giving up. In fact, right now, they 
are trying to pass a new version. In the 
latest iteration of their tax-and-spend-
ing spree, Democrats notably plan to 
hike taxes on small businesses. Yeah, 
that is right, on small businesses. 
Our country is struggling with soar-
ing inflation, the economy is teetering 
on the brink of a recession, and the 
Democrats want to raise taxes on small 
businesses—and particularly on small, 
individually, and family-owned busi-
nesses or what are often called pass-
through businesses, which make up 
more than 90 percent of the businesses 
in this country. 
Mr. President, I guess it shouldn’t be 
a surprise. After all, ‘‘tax and spend’’ is 
the unofficial Democrat motto. The 
Democrats have made their hostility to 
tax relief very plain. President Biden 
ran for President on repealing tax cuts 
from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the 
tax 
relief 
legislation 
Republicans 
passed in 2017 that helped increase 
wages and incomes, boost economic 
growth, and drive the poverty rate to a 
record low. 
In addition to the natural economic 
recovery coming out of the pandemic, 
much of the residual strength in the 
economy that President Biden likes to 
tout is a result of the tax relief passed

in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but that 
hasn’t stopped President Biden from 
claiming that the bill just benefited 
high-income earners and corporations. 
The only problem with his narrative, 
of course, is that lower- and middle-in-
come Americans are actually the ones 
who saw some of the biggest benefits 
from Republicans’ tax relief legisla-
tion. Wage growth in the wake of Re-
publicans’ legislation was strongest for 
those in lower income brackets. From 
2017 through the end of 2019, real 
wealth for the bottom 50 percent in-
creased by an astounding 28.4 percent, 
compared to 8.9 percent for the top 1 
percent. Meanwhile, government rev-
enue, which Democrats claimed would 
be hit hard by the Republican tax cuts, 
last year posted its largest increase in 
44 years. 
Mr. President, before the enactment 
of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Demo-
crats charged that reducing the U.S. 
corporate tax rate—from the highest 
rate, I would add, in the developed 
world, 35 percent, to a more globally 
competitive rate of 21 percent—would 
strip the government of corporate tax 
receipts. That has hardly been the 
case. Not only did Federal corporate 
tax revenues come in at a record high 
in fiscal year 2021; corporate tax rev-
enue, as a share of the economy, rose 
to its highest level since 2015. 
Total tax receipts are set to increase 
this year by 19.5 percent or $800 billion, 
according to the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office, after rising last 
year by 18 percent. Tax revenues year 
over year: 18 percent last year; 19.5-per-
cent increase in tax revenues this year, 
which begs the question: Why do Demo-
crats want to raise taxes when you 
have got record revenue coming into 
the Federal Government? 
The effects of tax reform on business 
investment, wages, and tax revenue 
have been a boon to the American peo-
ple and our economy. It is fascinating 
how Democrats claim to want one 
thing yet push for policies that will se-
cure the exact opposite. 
The President claims he ran for of-
fice because he was tired of the trickle- 
down economy and that he wanted to 
build an economy that works for work-
ing families. 
The ironic thing is that the pre- 
COVID economy President Biden com-
plains about was working for working 
families, thanks in large part to the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other Re-
publican economic policies. 
The Biden economy, in contrast, is 
the very opposite of an economy that 
works for working families. Working 
families in the Biden economy are suf-
fering. Food prices have risen astro-
nomically, and gas prices are nearly 
twice as high as they were when Presi-
dent Biden took office. Real average 
hourly earnings are currently declining 
at the fastest pace in 40 years, and 
Americans continue to see a de facto 
pay cut under President Biden. Cur-
rently, a growing number of Americans 
are digging into their savings—when 
they have them, that is—to make ends 
meet. Others are relying on things like 
credit cards or visits to food banks, 
where demand has soared. 
Now Democrats want to make things 
worse by raising taxes on small busi-
nesses and other Americans. That is 
likely to lead to a combination of 
lower wages for workers, lower returns 
for business owners, and higher prices 
for goods and services. When you com-
bine that with soaring inflation and 
more unnecessary government spend-
ing, you have a recipe for continued 
economic misery for American fami-
lies. 
If Democrats really wanted to help 
American families, they would be fo-
cused on making all of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act tax cuts permanent. In-
stead, they are pursuing tax-and-spend-
ing policies that will make the eco-
nomic havoc they created even worse. 
Let’s hope that the newest iteration 
of their Build Back Better tax-and- 
spending spree will fail before Amer-
ican families have to suffer any more 
consequences. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened to the Senator from South Da-
kota, my friend, and I think he fairly 
set out the Republican agenda: Take 
the Trump tax cuts—the cuts that ap-
peared during the Trump administra-
tion for the wealthiest people in Amer-
ica—and make them permanent. That 
is his idea of an economic boost that 
America needs; it is not mine. My idea 
is to try to address the challenges 
which working families in America 
face today, the challenges which many 
people in America of limited means 
face today. I think the Tax Code should 
be written with those people in mind, 
not with the wealthiest people in mind, 
which the Republicans did when they 
pushed through the Trump tax cuts, 
with the opposition of Democrats. 
So what are we proposing that was 
characterized yesterday by the Repub-
lican minority leader as socialistic? 
Well, what we are proposing is trying 
to bring some fairness when it comes 
to prescription drug pricing. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. President, ask Americans about 
the cost of living. They will certainly 
talk to you about gasoline and food 
and 
prescription 
drugs—particularly 
our seniors. 
It was ironic yesterday that after the 
Senator from Kentucky on the Repub-
lican side called cutting prescription 
drug pricing socialistic, just a few min-
utes later, the senior Republican Sen-
ator from Iowa took the floor and en-
dorsed the very same policy. He said he 
was in favor of cutting prescription 
drug pricing for senior citizens. The 
two of them obviously are not talking 
with one another or certainly not 
agreeing on a basic issue. 
Here is what we think. We believe the 
pharmaceutical industry in America is 
a great industry and very profitable. 
We believe that they are spending more 
money to increase their profits—not as 
much on research as they are on mar-
keting. What do I mean? Turn on the 
television station and try to avoid an 
ad for a drug. They are on constantly. 
Really, they spend a lot of money—the 
industry does—on those ads and mar-
keting efforts, more money than they 
spend on actual research for new drugs. 
What are they trying to do? They are 
trying to convince the American con-
sumers to ask for certain drugs when 
they go to the doctor. They have to 
work overtime to try to get us to the 
point where we can spell Xarelto and 
write it down on a piece of paper and 
go to a doctor and ask for it, and peo-
ple do, and it works. The money they 
spend on advertising works. 
There are only two countries on 
Earth that allow television advertising 
for pharmaceutical drugs: the United 
States and New Zealand. Most every 
other country says that those decisions 
should be made by medical profes-
sionals. Consumers can’t know the 
whole story, can’t know the medical 
aspects—every aspect of a drug. It is 
best to leave it to the professionals. 
But the American pharmaceutical in-
dustry sees it another way. If they can 
educate, inform, and motivate Amer-
ican consumers to ask for drugs, many 
doctors will prescribe them without a 
battle, and the cost of healthcare goes 
up. 
BlueCross BlueShield based in Chi-
cago, IL, told me that the push behind 
increases in health insurance pre-
miums for families across America is 
the cost of prescription drugs. They are 
so expensive. 
So we are trying to, on the Demo-
cratic side, come up with a plan that 
reduces the cost of prescription drugs 
for Americans and American families— 
particularly for senior citizens. It is 
long overdue. Senior citizens who can’t 
afford their prescriptions don’t fill 
them or take half a dose when they 
should take a full dose for their good 
health in the future. We want to reach 
the point where these pharmaceuticals 
and prescription drugs are affordable. 
Right now, we have what I consider 
to be a fair deal between the Veterans’ 
Administration and the pharma compa-
nies. They negotiated the prices of 
these drugs so that our veterans get 
the benefit of that negotiation. 
Incidentally, 
the 
pharmaceutical 
companies also have to negotiate with 
governments in other countries. Can-
ada, selling exactly the same drugs 
made in the same place in the United 
States, charges a fraction for most 
drugs over what is charged to the 
American consumers. What is the dif-
ference? The difference is, the Cana-
dian Government said: We are not 
going to let you exploit our customers 
in Canada. So they keep the costs of 
American drugs lower than what we 
pay in the United States. There is no 
fairness there. If we are going to have 
negotiation to bring pharmaceuticals 
down to an affordable level in Canada, 
we should do it in the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3347 
July 19, 2022 
The bill being pushed by the Demo-
crats and opposed by the Republicans 
would do several things. 
It would say that Medicare can nego-
tiate prices for drugs. That will help 
senior citizens and will save our Treas-
ury money. 
It also says that we are going to 
limit the amount of out-of-pocket ex-
penditures that seniors will face under 
Medicare to $2,000 a year. That is a real 
break for a lot of people who are strug-
gling to make ends meet among our 
senior citizens. 
We also say that if the pharma-
ceutical companies dramatically in-
crease the price of drugs, they will be 
subject to a penalty. There are condi-
tions for that, but we are trying to say 
to them that you can make a profit, 
but don’t try to capitalize on that prof-
it every single year by raising the cost 
of drugs. 
What we are talking about are actual 
family concerns for the affordability of 
lifesaving drugs. The Democrats are for 
it; the Republicans oppose it. They 
have said it is socialism; it is trying to 
make a buck—or whatever they want 
to characterize it, I don’t know. They 
ought to sit down and talk to some of 
these families. In fact, they ought to 
talk amongst themselves when a Re-
publican Senator took the floor yester-
day and agreed with our position on 
pharmaceuticals. 
I would say to the Senator from 
South Dakota, he can continue his 
campaign for the Republican dream of 
making tax cuts for the wealthiest peo-
ple permanent. I want to be part of the 
Democratic aspiration to make life 
more affordable, particularly for sen-
iors and those in need of affordable 
drugs. 
SEMICONDUCTORS 
Mr. President, today, the Senate is 
going to take up the CHIPS Act of 2022. 
It is critical to our economy and na-
tional security. It will provide billions 
of dollars to boost our domestic semi-
conductor manufacturing industry. 
In 1990, the United States produced 37 
percent of the world’s semiconduc-
tors—1990. Today, it is 12 percent. 
Semiconductors are used in every-
thing from vacuum cleaners to refrig-
erators, cell phones, cars, and fighter 
jets. The ongoing global shortage of 
microchips has led us to supply chain 
constraints on goods, higher prices, 
layoffs, and a great dependency on for-
eign suppliers. 
For generations, my home State of 
Illinois has been a leader in auto manu-
facturing. This includes companies like 
Stellantis, 
which 
has 
a 
plant 
in 
Belvidere, IL. Unfortunately, this plant 
has had forced shutdowns and layoffs 
in recent years—not because they lack 
customers; they lack chips. The global 
shortage of semiconductors has forced 
Stellantis to slash its workforce by 
more than 70 percent over the past 3 
years. A similar story unfolded at 
Ford’s Chicago Assembly Plant—re-
peatedly forced to stop production and 
lay off workers because of a shortage of 
chips. 
This isn’t just an Illinois problem. 
U.S. automakers are building an esti-
mated 3 million fewer vehicles than 
projected this year because of the 
semiconductor shortage. The global 
chip shortage and resultant slowdown 
in auto manufacturing has driven up 
the cost of cars and trucks. A new car 
costs 17 percent more today than a 
year ago. Talk about dealing with in-
flation—when it comes to the cost of 
vehicles, you are dealing with a short-
age in semiconductor chips. 
Across America, layoffs, closed pro-
duction lines, long waits, and high 
prices for cars, appliances, and other 
basics are evidence of the urgent need 
to invest in our domestic manufac-
turing industry and domestic produc-
tion of semiconductors. If we fail to 
make these investments, American 
workers and consumers will pay the 
price. 
This isn’t only about our Nation’s 
economy; it is also about our Nation’s 
security. Many U.S. defense systems 
and platforms rely on foreign-made 
chips for their performance, and semi-
conductors are particularly critical for 
the next generation of defense tech-
nology. 
Most of the chips that power U.S. de-
fense systems today are made in Asia. 
Think about that for a minute. We are 
dependent on Asia for the chips that we 
need to keep America safe. 
We have seen what a pandemic can do 
to supply chains. Think about how 
military conflict could end up with 
supply chains, global supply chains, in 
danger. Imagine if China, for instance, 
decided 
to 
deliberately 
withhold 
microchips from a nation to weaken 
their 
national 
defense. 
Rebuilding 
America’s 
microchip 
production 
is 
about defending our Nation and our al-
lies in a dangerous world. 
I understand some have concern 
about the subsidies in the bill, framing 
them as corporate giveaways. It is true 
that many of the chipmakers who 
would benefit from this bill are profit-
able or they moved production overseas 
despite 
receiving 
previous 
Federal 
funding. But in this bill are incentives 
to bring microchip production back to 
the United States, and they are abso-
lutely necessary for us to compete with 
other nations that are trying to lure 
chipmakers away from the United 
States. 
The bill also includes guardrails to 
protect and promote production in the 
United States, such as prohibiting the 
manufacture of certain chips in coun-
tries of concern, like China. 
Ultimately, this bill makes strategic 
investment to boost our domestic sup-
ply chain, counter the threat posed by 
other countries, like China and Russia, 
and help American consumers. I urge 
my colleagues to pass the CHIPS Act 
without delay. 
Mr. President, I would like to make 
one last statement on the record. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
NOMINATION OF NANCY L. MALDONADO 
Mr. DURBIN. It is not every day we 
get to say this, but this week, we have 
a chance to make history in the ‘‘Land 
of Lincoln.’’ Soon, the Senate will vote 
to confirm Nancy Maldonado as U.S. 
district court judge for the Northern 
District of Illinois. If confirmed, this 
eminently qualified nominee will be 
the first Hispanic woman to serve as an 
article III judge in Illinois. It marks 
yet another proud accomplishment in 
our efforts to build a judiciary that 
really reflects America. 
Born in Skokie, Ms. Maldonado has 
practiced law for more than two dec-
ades. She earned her A.B. cum laude 
from Harvard and her J.D. from Colum-
bia Law School. After graduating, she 
clerked for 2 years with Judge Ruben 
Castillo, who served on the court to 
which she has now been nominated. 
In the years since her clerkship, Ms. 
Maldonado has dedicated herself to de-
fending the rights of working people as 
a plaintiff-side employment law liti-
gator. Throughout her career, she has 
continually answered the call to serve 
our State. 
In the early 2010s, she worked as spe-
cial assistant state’s attorney to Cook 
County to investigate fraud. In 2018, 
our State’s attorney general appointed 
her to serve as consent decree monitor 
in 
two 
employment 
discrimination 
cases. Again last year, she was ap-
pointed to serve as a special assistant 
attorney general to investigate con-
sumer fraud. She was also confirmed by 
the Illinois State Senate to join the 
State Police Merit Board, a role in 
which she has worked to ensure that 
members of law enforcement who pro-
tect and serve our communities are 
treated fairly. 
With such impressive credentials, it 
is no wonder that Senator TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH and I enthusiastically sup-
port Ms. Maldonado and that the 
American Bar Association rated her 
‘‘well qualified.’’ 
Given her extensive experience and 
long record of service, she will be an 
asset to the Northern District of Illi-
nois. I hope all of my colleagues will 
join me in voting for her confirmation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
SEMICONDUCTORS 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, as it 
turns out, I rise to echo the sentiments 
of my colleague, the distinguished Sen-
ator from the State of Illinois. 
The Senate is prepared to finally 
begin debating a targeted version of 
the jobs and competition bill that 
many of us have been working on for 
more than a year, and I rise today to 
urge my colleagues not to waste any 
more time in getting this important 
bill across the finish line. We should 
not allow politics to get in the way of 
the people’s work. 
As a voice in the Senate for my home 
State of Georgia, I cannot stress 
enough how critical it is for us to get 
this bill done for our national security

and to keep our economy competitive 
against global actors like the Chinese 
Communist Party and to lower rising 
costs for hard-working families all 
across Georgia and all across our coun-
try. 
Now, I know that there might be dis-
appointment from some of my col-
leagues that we are not able to pass the 
more robust package right now that we 
have been working on and negotiating 
since last April. And, honestly, I share 
that disappointment. 
As both a member of the Commerce 
Committee and a member of the com-
mittee that has been negotiating the 
final competition bill, I have been 
working hard to secure several prior-
ities for Georgia in that package, and I 
am not about to stop fighting for those 
priorities. 
I am going to keep fighting to get in-
vestments and policies like funding for 
regional tech hubs, for STEM edu-
cation—an education program that in-
vests in all of our children, in all of our 
young people—and workforce develop-
ment passed into law. 
But let me be clear: Passing a bill 
that will strengthen domestic produc-
tion of one of our country’s most valu-
able 
resources, 
semiconductors 
or 
chips, is a crucial opportunity to invest 
in the economy, invest in our security, 
and our future. And we cannot wait an-
other minute. 
I want to shine a spotlight on this be-
cause I have heard from Georgians 
about the importance of this legisla-
tion and, specifically, investing and 
making more chips here in the United 
States. We know that chips are essen-
tial components in the products that 
support thousands of good-paying jobs 
in Georgia, not to mention things like 
cars, cell phones, computers, vacuum 
cleaners, ATMs. Chips are all around 
us, a host of products we rely on every 
single day. 
And we know that our chips supply 
chains are under significant strain, 
both from production limits and geo-
political threats. But what you may 
not know is how these issues directly 
affect workers and companies on the 
ground all across the State of Geor-
gia—companies like Kia, which has a 
thriving facility out in West Point, GA, 
about halfway between Atlanta and 
Montgomery, AL, on I–85. Semiconduc-
tors are essential to the manufacturing 
of the roughly 340,000 vehicles Kia pro-
duces in Georgia every year. At least 
twice in the past year, this facility, 
which I have visited on more than one 
occasion, has had to stop work at the 
plant because they didn’t have enough 
chips. 
They had to stop working, not be-
cause they didn’t have enough cus-
tomers, but because they didn’t have 
enough chips. I visited that West Point 
facility, and I met with some of those 
workers. And I can tell you that the 
last thing that those workers need is to 
miss days off work and money out of 
their paychecks because we don’t man-
ufacture enough of the materials that 
they work with every single day. 
And it is not just car manufacturers 
in Georgia. The chip shortage is hurt-
ing our State’s economy in myriad 
ways, big and small. For instance, Ste-
phen Milner is the CEO of Planters 
Telephone 
Cooperative, 
a 
member- 
owned telecommunications provider in 
Screven County that does broadband 
expansion, as well as broadband main-
tenance. 
Stephen’s company needs equipment 
to do that work that requires semi-
conductors, and as he explained re-
cently in the Atlanta Journal Con-
stitution, it has become harder to ex-
pand telephone and internet services to 
new businesses and homes in the rural 
communities he services because his 
company can’t guarantee that it will 
get the parts needed to complete the 
job. 
So think about that. The chip short-
age isn’t just hurting jobs and bottom 
lines; it is hobbling our ability to ex-
pand rural broadband. And farmers all 
across Georgia will tell you that you 
can’t even farm efficiently without a 
good broadband connection. 
And so this is devastating, especially 
for rural Georgians. And if we don’t act 
soon, it will get worse. We have got to 
ensure that all of our citizens can take 
full advantage of every opportunity in 
our changing economy. And this is a 
problem we can solve. We can solve it. 
The only thing that gets in the way 
of this right now is politics. And so we 
have got to pass this bill. If we pro-
duced more chips here at home, it 
would boost domestic manufacturing, 
ease supply chain issues, and help 
begin to lower rising costs for goods 
that families are experiencing in Geor-
gia and around the country. Why 
wouldn’t we want to take steps to drive 
down costs for hard-working families 
right now? We work for them. 
Lastly, this bill contains provisions I 
fought for that will expand these tax 
incentives to companies down the 
semiconductor 
supply 
chain, 
sup-
porting economic engines like the 
high-tech semiconductor plant being 
built in Covington, GA, that will create 
400 new jobs. 
There 
are 
real 
economic 
con-
sequences for people in my State if we 
do not pass this chips bill and make 
these 
investments. 
These 
are 
the 
human faces of the public policy that 
we would pass. But that is not the only 
reason we need to get this bill done as 
urgently as possible. 
It also bears repeating that passing 
this legislation is critical to our na-
tional security and strengthening our 
competitiveness against global actors 
like the Chinese Communist Party. 
Chips are used in technology critical to 
our national security. 
According to a 2020 report from the 
Semiconductor Industry Association, 
in 1990—listen—in 1990, the United 
States represented a 37 percent share of 
the world’s chip manufacturing capac-
ity. Today, that number is 12 percent— 
from 37 percent to 12 percent. 
I submit that that is unacceptable, 
and it is a threat to our national secu-
rity. As we have heard from Defense 
Secretary Austin, Commerce Secretary 
Raimondo, and other administration 
officials, we are at a tipping point—a 
tipping 
point—where 
international 
companies are making significant deci-
sions about where they are investing 
their capital and putting down roots. 
In fact, we have already seen several 
of these entities hesitate to invest in 
American manufacturing due to inac-
tion and political gamesmanship right 
here in Washington. 
So our ability to rise to this occasion 
will demonstrate whether the United 
States is willing to cede the innovation 
and economic higher ground to the Chi-
nese Communist Party or whether we 
will stand up to the People’s Republic 
of China and reinvest in the manufac-
turing and innovation prowess that has 
made America a lone superpower for 
decades. 
I submit that if we fail to pass this 
bill immediately, we will set back 
America’s competitiveness for a gen-
eration or more. This critical moment 
requires all of us to put the country 
above politics. Imagine that: Put the 
country above politics. Put hard-work-
ing American families who are doing 
the best they can right now above poli-
tics and strengthen our Nation’s com-
petitiveness. 
And so I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting the strong chips leg-
islation, and let’s ensure that the next 
century, like the 20th century, is the 
American century. 
I yield the floor. 
NOMINATION OF NINA NIN-YUEN WANG 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate continues its work 
confirming experienced, diverse nomi-
nees to the Federal judiciary. 
Today, the Senate will vote to con-
firm Judge Nina Wang, nominated to 
the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Colorado. Judge Wang currently 
serves as a magistrate judge in the Dis-
trict of Colorado. Prior to joining the 
bench, she worked in private practice, 
primarily representing plaintiffs and 
defendants in a broad range of complex 
intellectual property matters. Judge 
Wang also served as an Assistant U.S. 
Attorney for the District of Colorado, a 
role in which she litigated civil cases 
on employment, environmental, and 
civil rights matters. 
A graduate of Washington University 
in St. Louis and Harvard Law School, 
she clerked for Judge Peter J. Messitte 
on the District of Maryland a few years 
after earning her J.D. The American 
Bar Association has unanimously rated 
Judge Wang ‘‘well qualified’’, and she 
enjoys the strong support of her home 
State Senators, Mr. BENNET and Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER. 
I will support Judge Wang, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3350 
July 19, 2022 
upon the table, and the President will 
be immediately notified of the Senate’s 
actions. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
ABORTION 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
rise today to speak on behalf of Amer-
ican women, our fundamental rights, 
and our freedom to make our own 
healthcare decisions. 
It is shocking that in this day and 
age that we have to actually stand up 
and fight for something as basic as 
making our own reproductive health 
decisions, not a bunch of politicians, 
not a bunch of judges but women mak-
ing our own healthcare decisions. 
Thanks to a radically conservative 
Supreme Court that we now have, re-
productive freedom is no longer a con-
stitutional right in the United States 
of America—no longer a constitutional 
right in the United States of America 
after 50 years. 
Today’s 
daughters 
and 
grand-
daughters have fewer freedoms than 
their grandmothers did, and, for the 
record, we are furious. Want to know 
just how furious? Well, in Michigan, 
our State could soon revert back to a 
1931 law that makes abortion at any 
stage a felony—no exceptions for rape 
or incest; putting people in jail, poten-
tially; women going to jail; doctors 
going to jail. Who knows how far this 
would go? 
Well, the people of Michigan aren’t 
going to stand for that, and a group 
called Reproductive Freedom for All 
has gotten to work. These passionate 
advocates and volunteers from all 
across Michigan—west side, east side, 
up north, down south in Michigan— 
have collected more than 750,000 signa-
tures to put reproductive freedom on 
the ballot for Michigan women this No-
vember. 
It is the most signatures ever col-
lected for a ballot measure in Michi-
gan, twice as many as is actually need-
ed to put the ballot proposal on the No-
vember ballot—the most ever. Madam 
President, 750,000 people have come for-
ward to sign petitions to give them the 
right to vote, to protect their repro-
ductive freedoms. So our freedoms are 
on the ballot in November. 
Now, we also know that we have to 
continue to do everything we can right 
now, both at the State level and the 
Federal level, because waiting isn’t an 
option. Women’s lives and people’s 
livelihoods are on the line today, and it 
has revealed a stark contrast when we 
look at the actions that are being 
taken or not taken. 
Democrats are standing with women 
to protect our reproductive freedoms. 
As of June 1, Democrats in five States 
have already enacted laws—new laws— 
protecting access to legal abortion, and 
62 pieces of legislation have been intro-
duced in 17 States across America to 
protect 
reproductive 
freedom. 
Vermont, California, and Arizona have 
joined Michigan in pursuing ballot ini-
tiatives to enshrine reproductive free-
dom in their State constitutions. 
So men and women will have the op-
portunity there, the freedom to vote to 
protect their reproductive freedoms. 
Democratic Governors have issued ex-
ecutive orders and taken other actions 
to 
protect 
access 
to 
reproductive 
healthcare. The Biden administration 
signed an Executive order directing 
Agencies to protect access to medical 
care and is providing legal support to 
patients and healthcare providers. 
Meanwhile, Republicans are doing ev-
erything they can—everything they 
can—to stand in the way of women who 
are simply trying to access basic 
healthcare—basic healthcare, what is 
best for them, with their own faith, 
their own family, the counsel of their 
doctors, the capacity for women to 
make their own decisions, again, not a 
bunch of politicians, not a bunch of 
judges. It is the United States of Amer-
ica. This is not about what decisions 
are made; it is about who makes them: 
the government or women. 
Now, Republicans are saying the gov-
ernment at every level. Fifteen States 
have already banned abortion, and sev-
eral more are expected to follow soon. 
A clinic in Cleveland, OH, a State 
where care has been severely re-
stricted, is now sending its patients to 
Detroit. 
These women have to drive 21⁄2 hours, 
at least, to receive basic healthcare. 
And now some people want to take 
away their car keys. And to be clear, 
Republicans—Republican elected offi-
cials—want to take away their car 
keys. 
Republican 
lawmakers 
in 
some 
States are pursuing legislation to pre-
vent people from traveling to another 
State 
to 
receive 
reproductive 
healthcare. In America, people are 
being banned from driving to another 
State to be able to get the healthcare 
that they need, oftentimes, in very se-
rious emergency situations, tragedies. 
Think about that for a moment. Re-
publicans, who fancy themselves the 
party of freedom, are trying to pass 
laws that would prevent an Ohio 
woman from driving to Michigan for 
healthcare in America. 
The 
Freedom 
to 
Travel 
for 
Healthcare 
Act 
introduced 
by 
my 
friend Senator CORTEZ MASTO would 
have protected that right. It would pro-
tect that right, and last week we tried 
to pass it. 
Unfortunately, my Republican col-
leagues have blocked it, but we will 
keep trying. We will keep doing every-
thing we can to get enough people who 
are pro-choice, who respect privacy, re-
spect women in this Chamber to be 
able to make that happen. 
So, this week, we are trying a dif-
ferent approach to protect people’s re-
productive freedom. Senator SMITH and 
Senator MURRAY have introduced legis-
lation that I am pleased to cosponsor 
as well. It would provide $550 million a 
year in permanent funding for title X 
family planning programs. 
Now, let me remind everyone that 
title X funding can’t be used to provide 
abortion. 
This 
is 
about 
basic 
healthcare, yearly Pap smears, OB/ 
GYN visits, and the capacity to work 
with a clinic to get the basic care that 
you need and the basic birth control 
that you need. 
It prevents unplanned pregnancies in 
the first place by providing affordable 
birth control and other reproductive 
healthcare to people who need it. We 
should all be able to come together. 
Given my colleagues across the aisle 
and how passionate they are about pre-
venting abortions, I expect that they 
will eagerly support this commonsense 
bill when, in the next couple of days, a 
motion is made to pass it. 
Birth control is basic healthcare. We 
shouldn’t need to be here defending 
something that nearly 90 percent of 
American women use at some point in 
their lives. But we saw what happened 
to Roe, and we have since seen how 
eager Republicans at all levels are to 
constrain reproductive freedom. So 
here we are. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation coming before us this week. 
Democrats are standing with women. 
We respect women. We understand that 
women need to make their own deci-
sions, and Democrats understand that 
this is about freedom—the freedom to 
decide for ourselves, in whatever cir-
cumstance that we are in, whatever 
tragedy, whatever is happening that 
women need to be able to make our 
own basic healthcare decisions and not 
have the government coming in to reg-
ulate what is happening for women. 
So it is time for Republicans to join 
us on this legislation, basic legislation 
on title X that will ensure that there is 
support 
for 
basic 
reproductive 
healthcare. 
Again, 
we 
are 
talking 
about annual visits. We are talking 
about OB/GYN visits for women. We 
are talking about basic birth control. I 
certainly hope that my Republican col-
leagues are not going to say no to basic 
healthcare, reproductive healthcare for 
women. 
I hope Republican colleagues will 
join us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
CHIPS ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor of the Senate today 
because we are poised to begin consid-
eration of a really important piece of 
legislation. It is a plan to make Amer-
ica more competitive with China and a 
plan to bring good jobs back to Amer-
ica. I am talking about the bipartisan 
CHIPS Act, which includes reshoring 
semiconductor 
manufacturing 
to 
America and giving American workers 
and American companies the tools they 
need to compete and win. 
Let me give some background on why 
this legislation is so badly needed. U.S. 
dominance in what is called semicon-
ductor manufacturing has dwindled for 
decades, and it is an economic and a 
national security concern. The U.S. has 
always led the world in chip design. We

came up with this technology, but our 
share of the global chip manufacturing 
capacity over the past 30 years has 
gone from about 37 percent down to 
less than 12 percent today. 
As a result, we rely more and more 
on foreign countries for these essential 
chips; and in the past few years, the 
supply chain has not been reliable. You 
know that if you tried to buy a car re-
cently—maybe even a washing ma-
chine—that you had to wait forever. 
Why? Because of the lack of semi-
conductors. These chips are just not 
available. 
We have all come to learn in recent 
years that semiconductors are the 
building blocks of everything—auto-
mobiles, cell phones, computers, house-
hold appliances, medical equipment, 
but also military systems and weap-
onry like the F–35. And in a more dig-
ital economy, by the way, that demand 
for these semiconductors, these chips, 
will only continue to grow. 
Last year, this lack of semiconduc-
tors caused an estimated loss of $240 
billion to the U.S. gross domestic prod-
uct. So a $250-billion hit to our econ-
omy, according to the Department of 
Commerce, last year just because of 
these supply chain issues with semi-
conductors. 
This is more complicated by the key 
role that our adversaries play in the 
production of these semiconductors 
and the fact that we rely on some very 
vulnerable nations for critical compo-
nents of the supply chain. Neon gas, 
which is critical for the laser imprint-
ing of the chips, comes largely from 
Ukraine. Taiwan is the No. 1 semicon-
ductor fabricator in the world. By the 
way, 90 percent of the high-end chips 
are made in Taiwan; none are made 
here in America anymore—90 percent. 
Of course, Taiwan’s proximity to China 
and the constant threat of invasion by 
China adds to the urgency of diversi-
fying the semiconductor supply chain. 
By incentivizing companies to make 
these 
critical 
components 
here 
in 
America, we can make our supply 
chains more resilient; we can protect 
our national security; and we can boost 
economies all across the country. That 
is why the CHIPS Act is so important 
and why we have been working in a bi-
partisan fashion in Congress through 
legislation like this and the broader 
USICA legislation. 
This legislation would work to im-
prove our Nation’s competitiveness, 
generally, in technology, foreign rela-
tions and national security, domestic 
manufacturing, education, trade, and 
other matters. The CHIPS Act specifi-
cally would bring $52 billion in Federal 
investments 
for 
domestic 
semicon-
ductor research, design, and manufac-
turing. 
This 
broader 
bill, 
the 
so-called 
USICA bill, last June passed this Sen-
ate with an overwhelming bipartisan 
vote. We had hoped that the House 
would simply pass the Senate approved 
bill because it was already bipartisan. 
It had been worked out with Democrats 
and Republicans here in the Senate. 
Nineteen Republicans supported it; all 
50 Democrat Senators supported it; the 
White House supported it. 
Instead, the House sat on it. It took 
them almost a year—11 months—to 
pass their bill. But when they passed 
it, it was filled with all sorts of unre-
lated items that no Republican could 
support. That is why this has gone so 
slowly. 
So earlier this summer, we began 
conferencing the House- and the Sen-
ate-passed bills, trying to find that 
common ground between the two bills. 
We made some progress, but both 
Chambers have yet to agree on a final 
product. 
Meanwhile, there is an urgency to 
get this done because it is critical to 
the decisions that employers are mak-
ing right now to create and bring semi-
conductor manufacturing factories and 
jobs to America or to some other coun-
try. 
In January, Intel announced its plan 
to build a $20 billion site consisting of 
two semiconductor fabs in the United 
States and in my home State of Ohio. 
This is the largest investment in Ohio’s 
history, by far. It comes with a grand 
total of, again, $20 billion, two fabs; 
and we hope that is just a start. 
Intel has said time and time again 
that if the CHIPS Act funding is en-
acted, this will move forward and move 
forward quickly. They have also said 
that if the CHIPS Act moves forward, 
it could be extended—the $20 billion— 
to an up to $100-billion investment in 
Ohio. Remember, the $20 billion is 
hardly historic. That is because it 
would continue to build fabs—not just 
2, but up to 10. This 3,000-acre site in 
Ohio could be home to up to eight addi-
tional fabs and make central Ohio the 
silicon heartland. This would be great 
for my State, great for our region, and 
great for our country. 
This initial investment, by the way, 
would create about 10,000 good-paying 
jobs—3,000 on-site eventually, all good- 
paying, high-paying jobs, good benefits; 
but also 7,000 good-paying construction 
jobs in putting it together, tens of 
thousands of additional electrical, en-
gineering, supplier, restaurant, hous-
ing, 
healthcare, 
and 
entertainment 
jobs to support the region as it expands 
thanks to this investment. The sup-
pliers alone will be tens of thousands of 
new jobs. 
Ohio has already projected that this 
investment will add $2.8 billion to the 
State’s GDP, and that is just a start. 
Investments, like what is in front of us 
in Ohio, by the way—as well as similar 
efforts in Arizona where the Presiding 
Officer is from, Texas where my col-
league Senator CORNYN is from who is 
here on the floor with us today—are all 
perfect demonstrations of what this in-
vestment in semiconductors incentives 
can mean to American workers and 
American companies. 
China has committed a lot more than 
we are talking about as have, by the 
way, a lot of other countries. This is 
not a free market situation. One of my 
colleagues 
today 
asked 
me 
about, 
Shouldn’t we just let the market de-
cide? Well, if the market decides and 
China is offering $150 billion—which 
they are, over the next 10 years—when 
Europe has its own equivalent legisla-
tion to ours and is offering tens of bil-
lions of euros, or when South Korea or 
when Japan or when Taiwan are offer-
ing these huge incentives, it is very dif-
ficult to see us being able to bring 
these chips back to America—where 
costs are a little higher—and be able to 
be competitive. And we need that to 
happen for our domestic economy, but 
also our national security. 
If we fail to act, we are going to miss 
a key opportunity here to boost our 
competitive edge as a nation because 
these fabs will go elsewhere. 
I would also like to see us include 
some of the other key pieces of the 
broader Senate passed USICA bill that 
was passed on a bipartisan basis— 
again, 19 of us supported that here on 
the Republican side. That includes crit-
ical new investments in research but 
also key protections to be sure that 
that research is not stolen by foreign 
governments, such as China. 
We have got to remember that the 
overall goal of this effort is to improve 
our country’s competitiveness, espe-
cially with regard to China. To do that, 
we must not only invest in research 
and innovation, which I strongly sup-
port, but we must protect that tax-
payer-funded research and intellectual 
property from being taken by our com-
petitors like China and used against us. 
I believe, given current realities, with-
out such protections, any bill with sig-
nificant increased levels of Federal 
funding for research would be a huge 
giveaway to Beijing. Why do I say 
that? Because I have worked on this 
issue for the past 4 years. We have in-
vestigated it; we have held hearings; 
we have passed legislation. 
Recently, FBI Director Wray said it 
well: 
The biggest threat we face as a country 
from a counterintelligence perspective is 
from the People’s Republic of China and, es-
pecially, the Chinese Communist Party. 
They are targeting our innovation, our trade 
secrets, our intellectual property on a scale 
that is unprecedented in history. 
That is the Director of the FBI. 
Senator CARPER on the other side of 
the aisle and I introduced what is 
called the Safeguarding American In-
novation Act and insisted that it be in-
cluded in the USICA legislation in 
order for us to support it. That was my 
condition for supporting the broader 
USICA bill. This came after we did a 
yearlong study with the Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations that 
found, shockingly, how China had used 
what are called talent programs for 
two decades—two decades—to target 
the most promising taxpayer paid re-
search and researchers and to take 
that 
technology, 
that 
intellectual 
property, back to China. 
We found that the American tax-
payers had been unwittingly funding

the rise of China’s military and econ-
omy over the past two decades, while 
the Federal Government had done very 
little to nothing to stop it. In fact, 
when the FBI testified at our hearing, 
they acknowledged that. They said, We 
haven’t been focused on this in the past 
couple of decades like we should have 
been; we are going to now. 
And they started to. They started to 
make arrests—and you probably heard 
about some of these—arresting sci-
entists all over the country, who are 
abusing our lax attitude toward pro-
tecting research by taking research 
back to China and using it, often, 
against us. 
This legislation goes directly to the 
root of the problem. It makes it pun-
ishable by law to knowingly fail to dis-
close foreign funding on Federal grant 
applications. That is not a law now. 
The FBI has asked us for that law. It 
requires 
the 
executive 
branch 
to 
streamline and coordinate grant-mak-
ing between the Federal agencies so 
there is continuity, accountability, and 
coordination. That does not happen 
now. It is too wide open. It is not co-
ordinated. 
It allows the State Department to 
deny visas to foreign researchers who 
are coming to the United States to ex-
ploit the openness of our research en-
terprise, and it requires research insti-
tutions and universities to do much 
more, including telling the State De-
partment whether a foreign researcher 
will have access to export-controlled 
technologies. 
We have worked on this legislation, 
again, for the past few years. We have 
made lots of compromises and conces-
sions with people who had potential 
concerns about it. We have come up 
with legislation that is bipartisan and 
makes sense. It has already passed, 
again, with an overwhelming margin 
here in the U.S. Senate. I want to be 
sure, before we spend billions of dollars 
more in Federal research, which is 
being proposed, including to the Na-
tional Science Foundation, that that 
research can be protected. Who could 
be against that? Who could be for 
China being able to have better access 
to this information? Nobody. 
Again, a vital component of any com-
petitiveness bill is this commonsense, 
extensively negotiated bipartisan bill, 
which is already included in the Home-
land Security title of USICA. 
I can’t express enough the impor-
tance of passing this legislation, and it 
should be done on a bipartisan basis be-
cause it has been done before. It just 
makes sense. 
The broader USICA bill and the chips 
bill are both important. To pass the 
chips legislation is critical right now; 
it is urgent. And then what we can pass 
in terms of USICA is also important. 
Again, if we are putting more money 
into research, which is being proposed 
and which I support, it has to be pro-
tected. That is pretty simple and com-
mon sense. There is no perfect bill, but 
this bill will help keep America’s econ-
omy competitive. It will help keep 
American jobs here and grow new jobs, 
good-paying jobs with good benefits. 
We should pass this legislation, get it 
through the House, and take it to the 
President’s desk for signature. I hope 
my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting its passage. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
want to express my gratitude to the 
Senator from Ohio for his excellent re-
marks and for his support getting us to 
the point we are today, which is on the 
cusp of a historic accomplishment—and 
that is to make sure that the supply 
lines of advanced semiconductors re-
mains available to American busi-
nesses and, even more importantly, to 
our national security. 
Now, 2 years ago, Senator WARNER, 
the senior Senator from Vermont, and 
I introduced the CHIPS for America 
Act. It has been a long, strange trip till 
today. 
I daresay at the time we introduced 
the bill, there were many people who 
didn’t know the difference between 
chocolate chips and microchips. Frank-
ly, that is an exaggeration, but the 
point is that most people are really un-
aware of the dependency of our econ-
omy and our national security and, 
frankly, just the quality of our life on 
access to these microcircuits known as 
semiconductors. And over time, the 
semiconductor 
manufacturers 
have 
been able to make them smaller and 
smaller and more and more powerful 
until your cell phone, which is essen-
tially a minicomputer, contains thou-
sands 
of 
these 
microchips. 
Again, 
whether you are talking about a laptop 
computer or a new car or a washing 
machine or just some desktop com-
puter, all of them depend on access to 
these semiconductors. 
As I said, Senator WARNER and I in-
troduced the bipartisan CHIPS for 
America Act 2 years ago. Eighteen 
months ago, this legislation became 
law; that was as part of the National 
Defense Authorization Act. Thirteen 
months ago, the U.S. Senate passed a 
bipartisan bill to fund the program. 
Unfortunately, as the Senator from 
Ohio mentioned, the House failed to re-
spond to the bipartisan USICA, the 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, 
and sent over a partisan bill, which has 
delayed our consideration of this im-
portant legislation unnecessarily. 
Today, I am optimistic that the Sen-
ate will follow up on its commitment 
to enact this chips funding into law be-
fore we break for the August recess. 
This afternoon we will take a proce-
dural vote to kick-start consideration 
of the legislation. Of course, as we lead 
up to this important vote in debate, 
many of us have been talking about the 
size and shape of the bill on both sides 
of the aisle. And there is still some 
things that need to be decided, and the 
fate of the bill is not yet secure. Being 
the majority leader, Senator SCHUMER 
will ultimately be the one to determine 
what the size and shape of the bill will 
look like, but I am encouraged by 
where we stand. 
This bill will not, however, be the 
Senate’s U.S. Innovation and Competi-
tion Act or the USICA bill or the 
House’s 
massive 
partisan 
America 
COMPETES Act. This will be a far 
more narrow bill that focuses on the 
core issue of semiconductor manufac-
turing. Semiconductor manufacturing 
is, as I said, the key to our economy 
and our national security. As it turns 
out, most of the manufacturing capac-
ity has been built overseas, primarily 
in Asia, because it is significantly 
cheaper to build those manufacturing 
facilities there rather than here. I am 
not opposed to additional Commerce 
provisions, for example—that have al-
ready been voted on as part of USICA— 
being included, but anything else that 
is included by Senator SCHUMER must 
be bipartisan, and those decisions have 
to be made very quickly. The time for 
voting on this bill should not be de-
layed any further. 
Over the last three decades, the 
United States has gone from making 37 
percent of these microcircuits, or semi-
conductors—37 percent—to only about 
12 percent now. When you look at the 
most advanced chips, the smallest and 
the most powerful, none of these are 
made in the United States—none. Now, 
Taiwan’s Semiconductor, located in 
Taipei, Taiwan, has a great business 
model: American companies design the 
chips, and they make them. As I said, 
it is cheaper to make them in Asia 
than it is here in America, but post- 
COVID we have come to realize the vul-
nerability of our supply chains for vir-
tually everything. 
When you look at our dependency on 
the supply chain of these advanced 
chips and what it might mean to our 
country, well, it is shocking. The CEO 
of Micron, out of Idaho, has said there 
is a 35- to 45-percent cost gap between 
domestic 
and 
overseas 
production. 
Now, if you are talking about making 
toys or something like that or fur-
niture items, it is great to have a 
cheaper alternative where that product 
is manufactured overseas rather than 
here in America. That is good for con-
sumers as it makes things a lot more 
affordable, but when you are talking 
about a sole source for the most ad-
vanced semiconductors, that goes from 
being a convenience to a nightmare, 
and, of course, during the pandemic, we 
experienced a number of supply chain 
vulnerabilities. Now, as the economy 
around the world continues to expand, 
anybody who has tried to buy a car, a 
dishwasher, or a computer over the last 
couple of years has likely been im-
pacted with higher costs or long delays 
or both. 
As a matter of fact, due to the short-
ages of supply, that has necessarily 
driven the costs higher, which has fur-
ther exacerbated inflation, but there is 
an even more important reason to get 
this bill done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3353 
July 19, 2022 
The chip shortage and our lack of do-
mestic manufacturing capability is a 
huge national security risk. That is 
why the Secretaries of the Depart-
ments of Defense and Commerce sent a 
letter to Congress a few weeks ago, 
saying very clearly: 
Funding the CHIPS Act is critical to our 
national defense. 
That is why the Republican-led Sen-
ate passed the original bill and helped 
it become law during the previous ad-
ministration. That is why I hope the 
current Congress will fund it with to-
day’s vote—or with, actually, this 
week’s vote. 
Whether it is advanced fighters, the 
fifth-generation stealth strike fighter, 
like the F–35; whether we are talking 
about quantum computing, the next 
generation of computing; or whether 
we are talking about missile defense 
systems or the Stinger or Javelin mis-
siles that we have exported to Ukraine 
for them to defend themselves against 
Russian aggression, all of them depend 
on semiconductors. As a matter of fact, 
a single rocket interceptor used in 
Israel’s Iron Dome, for example, con-
tains more than 750 chips. An overreli-
ance on other countries to produce the 
key components to our most vital de-
fense assets is a huge and unacceptable 
risk. 
As I said, that is why Senator WAR-
NER and I initially introduced the bill 
in June of 2020 and why it has received 
such strong bipartisan support. 
Building a new foundry—or ‘‘fab’’ as 
they are sometimes called—is a huge 
undertaking and requires a massive in-
vestment. A single foundry can cost 
upward of $10 to $20 billion—$10 to $20 
billion. Without some level of support 
from the government, these invest-
ments simply won’t materialize, at 
least not in America. Other govern-
ments, as you have heard, have made 
similar investments in semiconductor 
manufacturing in trying to make sure 
that their supply chains are not vul-
nerable. Countries like China, South 
Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Germany, 
and a number of others have included 
an over-$100 billion pledge to boost 
semiconductor manufacturing in the 
European Union alone. The United 
States simply cannot get left behind, 
and we can’t keep dragging our feet. 
It doesn’t just take a lot of money to 
get these foundries up and running; it 
also takes time. Last year, I hosted a 
roundtable in Dallas, TX, to talk about 
the impact of the chip shortage with 
industry leaders. During our conversa-
tion, a Qorvo executive talked about 
how it can take years to receive all of 
the high-functioning equipment that is 
necessary to make semiconductors. 
That is why there has been such a big 
push in Congress to get this funding 
out the door. 
Chip makers who have to make deci-
sions about where and when to build 
their 
next 
manufacturing 
facilities 
need to know that these incentives are 
available for them to build those 
foundries here in America, and the win-
dow of that decision-making process is 
closing rapidly. If it closes—if we con-
tinue to drag our feet and not fund the 
chips bill—they are going to pull their 
investments from new or expanded 
foundries in the United States and take 
them 
overseas. 
This 
isn’t 
just 
a 
‘‘Chicken Little’’ claim. Companies 
have put out the warning call, and I be-
lieve them. 
One company called GlobalWafers is 
planning to build a new silicon wafer 
factory in Sherman, TX, which would 
create up to 1,500 new jobs and produce 
1.2 million wafers a month. Silicon wa-
fers are an essential component of 
semiconductors. Commerce Secretary 
Gina Raimondo said that the CEO told 
her that their plan to build this factory 
in Sherman, TX, is contingent on Con-
gress passing the CHIPS Act. Unless 
the funding is approved by the August 
recess, which is rapidly approaching, 
the company will scrap its plans for 
that facility. 
As you heard from our colleague 
from Ohio, the CEO of Intel expressed a 
similar sentiment for a planned Ohio 
facility. He said the company would ex-
pand chip production in Europe instead 
of in America if Congress fails to pass 
this funding. 
Another company, NXP Semiconduc-
tors, is weighing new investments too. 
It is looking at expanding one of its 
factories in Austin, TX—a project that 
would cost, roughly, $2.6 billion. The 
company is planning to decide later 
this year whether to move forward 
with that investment or to take that 
investment to Europe or Asia. 
In other words, there are real con-
sequences on the line. If Congress 
passes this chips funding act in the 
coming days, we can shore up this do-
mestic 
supply 
chain 
vulnerability, 
bring good jobs back to America, and 
protect our economic and national se-
curity, but if we fail to act or if we fail 
to act with dispatch, all of those bene-
fits will evaporate, and all of those 
dangers will become our worst night-
mare. Instead of here in America, those 
benefits from building those fabs will 
rain down on communities on the other 
side of the planet instead of here at 
home. 
It has been more than a year and a 
half since the CHIPS Act became law, 
and we simply cannot afford to wait 
any longer. Every day that goes by cre-
ates additional risks. Unless Congress 
gets this job done in the coming days, 
these companies will simply go else-
where. 
Chips funding will help secure our 
most critical supply chains. It will cre-
ate thousands of well-paying jobs and 
boost our global competitiveness by 
providing made-in-America chips to 
our friends and allies around the world. 
So we have a big opportunity ahead of 
us but big risks in not acting as well, 
and success, I believe, is our only op-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING DAVID BELCHER 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to speak of a 
person who took his own life. It was ei-
ther on Thursday or Friday of last 
week. It happens far too often. 
This guy was an Army veteran. His 
name was Dave Belcher, and I had 
known Dave for 30 years. Dave worked 
at White Refrigeration as a salesman. I 
bought TVs from him in the early nine-
ties. I bought the first front-loading 
washer from him and a refrigerator. He 
was just a great guy—just a great 
guy—but he had a challenge. His chal-
lenge was that he served his country, 
and because of that service to this 
country, he ended up with something 
that we talk about on this floor a lot. 
It is called post-traumatic stress dis-
order, PTSD. And because of that 
PTSD, Dave, not to my knowledge at 
the time when I first met him, but he 
was fighting demons, and he fought de-
mons throughout his life. There were 
issues of depression and guilt that he 
just couldn’t overcome and in the end, 
probably some paranoia involved, but 
he ended up taking his own life. 
I think to myself, back when I first 
met Dave 30 years ago, how this guy 
was as normal as anybody you would 
ever meet. He is not somebody you 
would look at and say: You know, he 
has got a bunch of problems. He is not 
somebody who you could predict, 30 
years after the fact, that he would have 
taken his own life, but that is what 
happened. 
It happens far too often. In fact, it 
happens 22 times a day to our veterans 
in this country. This time, it happened 
to somebody whom I considered a 
friend—not somebody I saw a lot, but 
he is somebody who I knew had his 
struggles in the end. He went through 
veterans court. He was one of the first 
graduates of the veterans court and 
was somebody who did his best to try 
to get his life turned around, but it 
didn’t happen. The demons got him. 
I just wanted to come to the floor 
today to say: Dave, you and all your 
friends who have served this country 
have people in the Senate, people in 
Congress who fight for you every day. 
For those folks who are watching 
this, who can relate to what I am say-
ing, if you have an issue, please get 
ahold of somebody who can help you, 
like a mental healthcare professional 
out there, because mental health can 
be fixed. All you need to do is get the 
tools to be able to deal with it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3770 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, we have 
broken another record. Unfortunately, 
it is not the kind of record we want to

July 19, 2022 
boast about. Last week, the latest Con-
sumer Price Index exceeded inflation 
expectations at a staggering 9.1 per-
cent. In Utah, that rate is much higher. 
The Biden administration’s evolving 
blame game has shifted. It has shifted 
its focus from the pandemic to the sup-
ply chain and then from the supply 
chain to Putin. There is, however, a 
more coherent answer: Government 
continues to spend more than it has—a 
lot more. Last year, we saw this play 
out. This Congress spent a stunning 
$6.8 trillion while collecting just over 
$4 trillion in revenue. With the return 
of 
legislative 
earmarks, 
porkbarrel 
spending, meanwhile, has increased 
over 1,700 percent. 
Rather than recognizing the prob-
lems associated with spending more 
than the government brings in, the 
government simply prints itself more 
money. Like a child stricken with 
affluenza, rather than being cut off, the 
government 
helps 
itself 
to 
more 
money. It doesn’t take long to lose the 
value of a dollar when you are not 
spending your own money. Government 
is no different. 
While hard-working Americans pinch 
pennies, lawmakers spend carelessly. 
To pay for their next project, they 
threaten to raise taxes. When they 
don’t have the support to raise taxes, 
they nevertheless continue to spend 
and drive up inflation. Inflation is 
nothing but an invisible tax on the peo-
ple—a tax on the people that, I would 
add, disproportionately affects hard- 
working Americans, the poor and mid-
dle-class Americans. Sometimes the 
wealthiest of the wealthy can find 
ways to get even wealthier in times of 
inflation. Everyone else gets hurt. 
With no action, the reckless spending 
will drive us off a financial cliff. But 
our spending trajectory is such that we 
cannot afford to wait for the consensus 
needed to pass a constitutional amend-
ment. 
While hard-working Americans wait, 
I have introduced the Preventing Run-
away Inflation in Consumer Expendi-
tures Act, or the PRICE Act, to stop 
the bleeding. The PRICE Act requires a 
three-fifths supermajority of Senators 
to approve new spending measures 
when the Nation’s inflation rate is at 
or above 3 percent. 
The PRICE Act is desperately need-
ed. This insatiable spending machine is 
now costing Utahns $881 a month more 
than they paid last year, and that is on 
top of what they already pay in taxes. 
Those are 881 dollars every month for 
which Utahns receive nothing in re-
turn. It represents money that could be 
spent toward their home, toward their 
child’s college education, toward filling 
their empty gas tank, but instead, mil-
lions of Americans will look at the 
skyrocketing costs of living and deter-
mine that they must sacrifice their 
wants and, in many cases, their needs 
just to meet their most basic, funda-
mental necessities. 
My PRICE Act flips the script. It 
doesn’t altogether prevent lawmakers 
from spending when inflation is above 3 
percent, but it requires lawmakers to 
offset that spending with cuts from 
somewhere else. In essence, it puts the 
impetus on Congress to weigh its legis-
lative wants against the legislative 
needs of the American people. That is 
because for everyone living in reality, 
a budget means something. 
Failure to live within a budget has 
profound consequences. When Jack has 
to pay an extra $93 a month on food, he 
begins to doubt his ability to feed his 
family. When Jill has to pay an extra 
$145 a month for housing, she doubts 
her ability to keep a roof over her 
child’s head. When Joe has to pay an 
extra $404 a month on transportation, 
he doubts his ability to get his child to 
and from soccer practice. 
So why is it that when inflation is at 
9.1 percent, lawmakers are still spend-
ing and looking for ways to spend even 
more? As Americans are filled with fi-
nancial fear and doubt, why is it that 
Senate Democrats want to spend an ad-
ditional trillion dollars for their Build 
Back Better plan? 
Congress is failing to exercise self-re-
straint during this period of unprece-
dented inflation. As Americans tighten 
their belts, Congress has opened the 
spigot. If a household ran this disaster 
of a budget, a family would quickly be 
met with foreclosures, repossessions, 
and ultimately bankruptcy. Ronald 
Reagan couldn’t have been more pre-
scient when he described inflation as 
‘‘the price we pay for those government 
benefits everyone thought were free.’’ 
While Members tout their shiny new 
pet projects, Americans are footing the 
bill. 
It is unconscionable that Congress 
continues to pat itself on the back for 
passing massive spending bills while 
the country has a financial millstone 
around its neck. It is high time that 
Congress subject itself to the same cut-
backs that working-class families are 
facing now. 
Although I wish Members of Congress 
would self-impose these restraints, this 
latest push for a new trillion-dollar 
spending plan shows that is unlikely to 
happen. Given our long-demonstrated 
lack of self-restraint, it is time to pass 
the PRICE Act. 
Congress has become the trust fund 
baby that doesn’t understand the value 
of a dollar. The PRICE Act is the rec-
ognition that sometimes you need to 
take away the credit card. So to that 
end, I would like to secure passage of 
this measure to protect the American 
people. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Budget 
Committee be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 3770 and that the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. I further ask that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Is there objection? 
Mr. SANDERS. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Senator LEE raises 
important issues about the deficit. I 
hope very much that he will be able to 
convince his Republican colleagues and 
Democratic colleagues as well that, 
among many other reasons, we should 
vote against this major corporate wel-
fare bill that is coming down the pike, 
which will add at least $76 billion to 
the deficit. So if we are concerned 
about the deficit, as Senator LEE is and 
many others are, I hope that will be 
one of the reasons we vote against this 
massive corporate welfare bill that we 
will be considering later this after-
noon. 
I hear a lot of concern about the def-
icit here in the Senate, and I hear peo-
ple say: We can’t afford to feed hungry 
children. We can’t afford to deal with 
climate change. We can’t afford to 
guarantee healthcare to all. The deficit 
is very, very large. 
Well, we are talking about $76 bil-
lion—at least that; maybe more—which 
will add to the deficit. So when you 
consider the deficit, you might want to 
also take into account tax breaks and 
corporate welfare for large, profitable 
corporations. 
I want to say a few words about this 
so-called chips bill and what it says 
about our national priorities, what it 
says about our tax policies, and basi-
cally what it says as to whether or not 
the U.S. Congress is capable of rep-
resenting the needs of working families 
or whether we are totally beholden to 
wealthy and powerful corporate inter-
ests and their campaign contributions. 
Last week, when I spoke about this 
issue, I expressed deep concern that 
Congress would provide $52 billion to a 
handful of profitable corporations in 
the microchip industry with no strings 
attached. Here it is, guys, $52 billion. 
Well, I stand corrected. As a result of 
some new tax-reduction language, the 
corporate 
welfare 
total 
for 
the 
microchip industry has gone up; it is 
now at $76 billion. And the corporate 
lobbyists working on this bill, like pigs 
at the trough, are not yet finished. 
They want more and more and more. 
Their needs are insatiable. 
Needless to say, I do not usually 
quote approvingly from the editorial 
page of the Wall Street Journal. They 
are not my best friends. In fact, I think 
I get attacked on that page more than 
any other Member of the Congress. 
But, as you know, a broken clock is 
right twice a day, and even the Wall 
Street Journal got this one right. 
Among the many reasons they urged 
Congress to vote against this bill is one 
that I think is very relevant. Let me 
quote. This is from the Wall Street 
Journal editorial page today: 
The chip bill isn’t needed to compete with 
China, and it will set a precedent that other 
industries will follow. Anybody who can

throw up a China competition angle will ask 
for money. Why Republicans want to sign up 
for this is a mystery. 
The Wall Street Journal. The point 
they make is a good one. We should be 
clear that over 90 percent of the cell 
phones used in this country and over 90 
percent of the laptops used in this 
country are made in China. 
So you pass this bill, and tomorrow 
we will hear, no doubt, from the cell 
phone industry, from the computer 
laptop industry about how they need 
their welfare checks as well. So I think 
the Wall Street Journal every once in a 
while makes a good point, and today 
they did. 
Mr. President, I recently came across 
a very, very interesting interview that 
the CEO of Intel, Mr. Pat Gelsinger, did 
last Friday on CNBC’s ‘‘Squawk Box,’’ 
and I think in that interview he did 
tell us everything we want to know 
about the American oligarchy, about 
corporate arrogance, and the state of 
American politics. This is what Mr. 
Gelsinger 
said 
last 
Friday—Mr. 
Gelsinger, head of Intel: 
My message to congressional leaders is, 
hey, if I’m not done with the job, I don’t get 
to go home. Neither should you. 
He is talking to Congress. 
Do not go home for August recess until you 
have passed the CHIPS Act because I and 
others in the industry will make investment 
decisions, and do you want those invest-
ments in the U.S., or are we simply not com-
petitive enough to do them here and we need 
to go to Europe or Asia for those? Get the 
job done. Do not go home for August recess 
without getting these bills passed. 
That is Pat Gelsinger, head of Intel, 
last Friday. 
In other words, Mr. President, the 
CEO of a major corporation which 
made nearly $20 billion in profits last 
year and a CEO who received a $179 
million compensation package is say-
ing to Congress that if you don’t give 
my industry, the microchip industry, 
$76 billion and my company, it is esti-
mated, some $20- or $30 billion, that de-
spite their profound love for our coun-
try and their respect for American 
workers and their understanding of the 
needs of the U.S. military and the 
healthcare 
industry—despite 
all 
of 
that, in order to make more profits, 
they are prepared to go to Europe and 
Asia. 
Now, Mr. President, I am, thankfully, 
not a lawyer, but that sure sounds like 
extortion to me. What Mr. Gelsinger is 
saying is that if you don’t give the in-
dustry a blank check—here is $76 bil-
lion—and they want more, by the 
way—despite the needs of the military 
for advanced microchips—and we hear 
that from the military—despite the 
needs of the medical industry for ad-
vanced microchips, despite the entire 
needs of the American economy for ad-
vanced microchips, the industry is 
threatening to abandon this country 
and move abroad. Patriotic people, no 
doubt. Clearly, lovers of America. 
Mr. Gelsinger says we should stay in 
session, if necessary, through August 
in order to pass his legislation. Well, I 
think we might want to stay in session 
through August but not necessarily to 
pass his legislation, because what I 
hear from the people in Vermont and 
people all across this country is that 
the job they want done is not a massive 
handout to large, profitable corpora-
tions; the job they want Congress to do 
is, for a change, to protect the Amer-
ican working class, our middle class, 
and the needs of the most vulnerable 
people in this country. 
What I hear is that the American 
people want us to guarantee healthcare 
to every man, woman, and child, as 
every other major country on Earth 
does. 
What I hear is that the American 
people think it is absurd that some of 
the wealthiest people in this country 
and largest corporations don’t pay a 
nickel in Federal taxes and that we 
should demand that those loopholes be 
ended. 
What I hear is that the American 
people want us to deal with the exis-
tential threat of climate change so 
that the young people of this country 
can actually have a planet they can 
grow up with in a healthy way. 
What I hear from the elderly people 
in this country, in my State, is they 
can’t make it on the Social Security 
benefits they are receiving now; they 
want to raise those benefits. 
What I hear from the people back 
home is they want Congress to do the 
job and protect a woman’s right to con-
trol her own body, they want to see us 
pass serious gun safety legislation, and 
they want to protect the rights of all 
Americans to be able to vote. 
That, among many other things, is 
what I hear from the American people 
in terms of getting the job done. Not 
too many people that I can recall—I 
have been all over this country—say: 
Bernie, you go back there and you get 
the job done, and you give enormously 
profitable corporations, which pay out-
rageous 
compensation 
packages 
to 
their CEOs, billions and billions of dol-
lars in corporate welfare. 
Now, maybe, Mr. President, you hear 
that. I don’t hear that from the people 
in my State. 
By the way, when we talk about an 
expenditure of $76 billion, yeah, we can 
give it to some large, profitable cor-
poration with no strings attached or 
we can use it—$76 billion—to expand 
Medicare, to provide senior citizens 
with the high-quality hearing aids and 
eyeglasses they desperately need, and 
for a bit more, we can provide dental 
care as well. 
For $76 billion, we could eliminate 
homelessness in America and create 
hundreds of thousands of good-paying 
jobs from Maine to California, building 
all of the affordable rental units that 
this country desperately needs. We can 
end homelessness or give a corporate 
welfare check to profitable corpora-
tions. 
Mr. President, for $76 billion, we 
could make every community college 
in America tuition-free for the next 7 
years. Go home and ask the people 
whether they think they would rather 
spend money on allowing our young 
people to be able to go to community 
college tuition-free or a welfare check 
to large, profitable corporations. 
And on and on it goes. Seventy-six 
billion is a lot of money. I know Sen-
ator LEE would probably prefer to see 
that go into deficit reduction. Fair 
enough. And I am concerned about def-
icit reduction, but I am making the 
point that we can invest this in a way 
that really improves lives for millions 
and millions of working families. 
Mr. President, there is no doubt that 
there is a serious global shortage in 
microchips and semiconductors, which 
is making it harder for manufacturers 
to produce the cars, the cell phones, 
and the electronic equipment we need. 
This shortage is costing American 
workers good jobs and raising prices 
for families, and that is why I strongly 
support 
efforts 
to 
expand 
U.S. 
microchip production. But the question 
we should be asking is this: Should the 
American 
taxpayers 
provide 
the 
microchip industry with a blank check 
of $76 billion at a time when semicon-
ductor companies are making tens of 
billions of dollars a year in profits and 
paying their CEOs very high salaries 
and compensation packages? I think 
the answer to that is a resounding no. 
It is important, in light of Mr. 
Gelsinger’s remarks and his threat to 
go to Asia or to Europe, to have a little 
bit of history about this issue. Over the 
last 20 years, the microchip industry 
has shut down over 780 manufacturing 
plants in the United States and elimi-
nated 150,000 American jobs while mov-
ing most of its production overseas. 
They did that, by the way, after receiv-
ing $9.5 billion in government subsidies 
and loans. 
In other words, we have the absurd 
situation where we have a crisis that is 
caused precisely by the people we are 
now attempting to bail out. So as a re-
ward for their bad behavior, for shut-
ting down 780 manufacturing establish-
ments in America, they come back and 
say: Oh, we have a crisis in America. 
We need your help. 
So they want us to pay to undo the 
damage they caused. Well, that may 
make sense to someone but not to me. 
In total, Mr. President, it has been 
estimated that five major semicon-
ductor companies will receive the 
lion’s share of this technology hand-
out. Those companies are Intel, Texas 
Instruments, 
Micron 
Technology, 
GlobalFoundries, and Samsung. These 
five companies made $70 billion in prof-
its last year. 
The company that will likely benefit 
the most from this taxpayer assistance 
is Mr. Gelsinger’s company, Intel. Now, 
I have nothing against Intel, and I wish 
them the best, but Intel is not a poor 
company. Last year, Intel made nearly 
$20 billion in profits. During the pan-
demic, Intel had enough money to 
spend $16.6 billion not on research and 
development, not on building new

plants, but on buying back its own 
stock to reward its executives and 
wealthy shareholders. 
Over the past 20 years, Intel has 
spent over $100 million on lobbying and 
campaign contributions. So $100 mil-
lion may seem like a lot of money, but 
if you are about to get $20 billion from 
the taxpayers of America, that is a 
very modest investment. Meanwhile, 
while they spent $100 million on lob-
bying 
and 
campaign 
contributions, 
they were shipping thousands of jobs to 
China and other low-income countries. 
Does this really sound like a company 
that needs a taxpayer handout? 
Another company that would receive 
taxpayer assistance under this legisla-
tion is Texas Instruments. Last year, 
Texas Instruments made $7.8 billion in 
profits. In 2020, the company spent $2.5 
billion buying back its own stock. 
Meanwhile, other companies that 
will receive taxpayer support are the 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 
Company—and by the way, you would 
be shocked to know that the largest 
shareholder of the Taiwan Semicon-
ductor Manufacturing Company is— 
well, you guessed it; it is the Govern-
ment of Taiwan. So we would be giving 
money, I guess, directly to the Govern-
ment of Taiwan. And on and on it goes. 
Mr. President, I should be clear in 
stating that I do believe in industrial 
policy. I think that at times it is abso-
lutely appropriate for the government 
to sit down with the private sector and 
say: Look, we have needs, and we want 
to work with you to solve those needs. 
You have a right to make a fair profit. 
We have the need—the right to see the 
needs of the American people ad-
dressed. We need a partnership. 
To me, industrial policy means co-
operation between the government and 
the private sector—cooperation. It does 
not mean the government providing 
massive amounts of corporate welfare 
to profitable corporations without get-
ting anything in return. 
So the question is, Will the U.S. Gov-
ernment develop an industrial policy 
that benefits all of our society or will 
we continue to have an industrial pol-
icy that benefits the wealthy, the pow-
erful, their lobbyists, and the campaign 
contributors? 
In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
said: 
The problem is that we all too often have 
socialism for the rich and rugged free enter-
prise capitalism for the poor. 
I am afraid that what Dr. King said 
54 years ago was accurate back then 
and is even more accurate today. 
So, Mr. President, the Senate has an 
important decision to make, and that 
is, do we simply provide a blank check 
or do we put some restrictions on that 
money? That is why I will be offering 
an amendment which does that. 
It seems to me that if private compa-
nies are going to benefit from generous 
taxpayer subsidies, the financial gains 
made by these companies must be 
shared with the American people, not 
just wealthy shareholders. In other 
words, if microchip companies make a 
profit as a direct result of these Fed-
eral grants, the taxpayers of this coun-
try have a right to get a reasonable 
turn on that investment. 
Further, if microchip companies re-
ceive taxpayer assistance, they must 
agree that they will not buy back their 
own stock, outsource American jobs 
overseas, repeal existing collective bar-
gaining agreements, and must remain 
neutral in any union-organizing effort. 
This is not a radical idea. All of these 
conditions were imposed on companies 
that received taxpayer assistance dur-
ing the pandemic and passed the Sen-
ate in the CARES Act by a vote of 96 to 
0. That is why I will be filing an 
amendment to impose these conditions 
to this legislation. 
I understand that some language has 
been inserted into this bill that would 
prohibit microchip companies from 
using these grants to buy back their 
own stock. Let us be clear: This lan-
guage is totally meaningless. Under 
this legislation, companies will still be 
able to use the enormous profits that 
they are making on stock buybacks. 
Bottom line: Let us rebuild the U.S. 
microchip industry, but let us do it in 
a way that benefits all of our people, 
not just a handful of wealthy profitable 
and powerful corporations. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the Senator 
from Vermont and I don’t agree on 
every issue. We represent very different 
States, come from very different polit-
ical backgrounds. While I don’t agree 
with everything he just said and while 
I am disappointed by his objection to 
my effort to pass the PRICE Act, which 
I regard as necessary to help keep in-
flation under control, I want to echo 
and applaud so much of what my col-
league from Vermont just finished say-
ing. 
I don’t think it is appropriate, when 
we have people throughout the country 
struggling just to get by and we have 
people in Utah shelling out an addi-
tional $881 a month—every month—not 
for luxury items, not for some wish-list 
item, but for their basic household 
monthly expenses, every single month 
because of excessive runaway spending 
in Washington leading to that infla-
tion. Especially in that circumstance, I 
can’t fathom why we would want to 
turn now and devote $75 to $76 billion 
to what my colleague from Vermont 
appropriately described as corporate 
welfare. 
This is industrial policy, which—un-
like the Senator from Vermont, I don’t 
like 
industrial 
policy—but 
I 
com-
pletely agree with my colleague from 
Vermont. This goes beyond even that. 
This is corporate welfare. 
There is an editorial in today’s copy 
of the Wall Street Journal by the edi-
torial board. It makes some excellent 
points, which I would like to excerpt 
and present to the Senate today. The 
editorial starts out as follows: 
Industrial policy is back in fashion in 
Washington, or as it ought to be called, cor-
porate welfare. The semiconductor industry 
is first in the queue, but it won’t be the last. 
Taxpayers should at least know they’ll be 
subsidizing highly profitable companies that 
don’t need the help and might end up regret-
ting the political handcuffs they’re acquir-
ing. 
The bill that will head to the Senate floor 
as early as Tuesday— 
Meaning today— 
includes $52.2 billion in grants to the com-
puter chip industry. But wait, there’s more. 
Congress is also offering a 25% tax credit for 
semiconductor fabrication, which is esti-
mated to cost about $24 billion over five 
years. That’s $76 billion for one industry. 
The editorial continues: 
Republicans on the House Ways and Means 
Committee point out that for the same 
money Congress could double the research 
and development tax credit for all companies 
through 2025. It could also throw in 100% ex-
pensing for companies and allow immediate 
R&D deductions through 2025. But that 
would mean the politicians aren’t picking fa-
vorites, which is what they prefer to do. 
The editorial goes on from there to 
describe the circumstances that led to 
the introduction of this bill, the fact 
that there was surging demand and di-
minished capacity to produce the semi-
conductors during the pandemic and 
that, since the pandemic, a lot of these 
very same firms trying, understand-
ably, to keep up with demand have in-
creased their production. 
Meanwhile, 2 years later, they find 
themselves in a position where, due to 
changing economic circumstances, de-
mand is starting to soften; and so they 
may now be in a position where they 
have ramped up supply only to see that 
demand is diminishing. All of which 
starts to beg the question, Why would 
we dump over $76 billion into this in-
dustry right now when people across 
America, including these Utahns, are 
facing some of the highest price hikes 
in the country for a variety of reasons? 
Why would we give money to a small 
handful of wealthy corporations at a 
time like this, understanding that 
every dollar we spend here that we 
don’t have means that we are inflating 
the currency even more? And that ends 
up creating all sorts of problems. 
A few paragraphs later the editorial 
goes on to explain the next line of ar-
guments. They point out that those ad-
vocating on behalf of the CHIPS Act 
say: But, oh, we have to do this because 
it is about China. We have to do this in 
order to stop China, and this also can’t 
withstand scrutiny. 
Look, as the editorial writers of the 
editorial board of the Wall Street Jour-
nal point out: 
Global semiconductor capacity increased 
6.7 percent in 2020 and 8.6 percent in 2021 and 
is expected to grow another 8.7 percent this 
year. The risk of over-capacity is growing as 
China heaps subsidies on its semiconductor 
industry as part of its Made in China 2025 
initiative, and the U.S. and Europe race to 
compete. 
Some 15,000 new semiconductor firms reg-
istered in China in 2020. Some have drawn in-
vestment from U.S. venture-capital firms. 
Intel has backed Chinese startups even as 
CEO Pat Gelsinger lobbies Congress for sub-
sidies to counter Beijing. Intel has threat-
ened to delay a planned Ohio factory unless 
Congress passes the subsidy bill.

S3357 
July 19, 2022 
I pause here to note that this is trou-
bling. If true, this should be a warning 
to us about why we don’t engage in cor-
porate welfare. This is wrong. Deep 
down, we know it is wrong to take from 
the poor and give to the rich. We have 
no business doing this, nor do we have 
any business voting cloture on a mo-
tion to proceed to a bill that doesn’t 
yet exist. We don’t yet know what is in 
the bill because it is still being trans-
formed significantly, even as we speak. 
The Wall Street Journal editorial 
board continues: 
The other claim for the bill is that the U.S. 
must subsidize domestic chipmaking to com-
pete with China, but this also isn’t persua-
sive. The companies like to point out that 
the U.S. share of the world’s chips has fallen 
to 12 percent from 37 percent in 1990. They 
don’t mention that the U.S. leads in chip de-
sign (52 percent) and chipmaking equipment 
(50 percent). Seven of the world’s ten largest 
semiconductor companies are based in the 
U.S. China trails American companies by 
years in semiconductor technology. 
Chip fabrication has moved to South Korea 
and Taiwan because many chips are com-
modities with low margins. But chip makers 
are working to diversify their manufacturing 
bases to avoid future supply disruptions and 
have announced $80 billion in new U.S. in-
vestments through 2025. Samsung plans to 
build a $17-billion factory in Texas. TSMC 
has a $12-billion plant under construction in 
Arizona. 
I pause here to note that in meeting 
with representatives from some of 
these 
companies, 
including 
TSMC, 
TSMC noted—in my conversations with 
high-ranking executives of that com-
pany—that plant isn’t made contingent 
on any legislation they are producing. 
They are doing that because it makes 
good business sense, not because it is 
their last-gasp effort. This is a profit-
able company doing well, and for the 
United States to be considering giving 
money—whether to domestic compa-
nies or foreign ones—under these cir-
cumstances in this amount of money 
makes no sense. 
The editorial continues: 
One unfortunate impetus behind this bill is 
that, for all their talk about competing with 
China, many politicians believe that Bei-
jing’s economic planning is superior to the 
U.S. free market system. It reminds us of the 
1980s when legendary Intel CEO Andrew 
Grove warned that Japan was going to domi-
nate the chip industry and the future of 
global technology. 
As former Cypress Semiconductor CEO 
T.J. Rodgers explained on these pages last 
year, the government set up the Sematech 
chip consortium that ‘‘was obsolescent when 
it opened.’’ But Intel innovated with more 
advanced chips, and no one is talking now 
about Tokyo’s central-planning genius. 
The editorial concludes: 
History 
shows 
that 
easy 
government 
money can undermine competitiveness. It 
often leads to inefficient spending and in-
vestment. The politicians will also attach 
their own strings, perhaps with limits on 
stock buybacks and dividends. Wait until 
Bernie Sanders is heard from on the Senate 
floor. 
They forecasted what we have seen 
today. It closes with the following sen-
tences: 
The chip bill isn’t needed to compete with 
China, and it will set a precedent that other 
industries will follow. Anybody who can 
throw up a China competitive angle will ask 
for money. Why Republicans want to sign up 
for this is a mystery, especially when they 
might control both Houses of Congress in six 
months. 
I couldn’t agree more with the edi-
torial board of the Wall Street Journal 
on this assessment. This is wrong. We 
know it is wrong. The bill still, as it 
stands right now, is unknown to most 
for the entirety of this body. We do 
know it costs over $76 billion. We do 
know people across America, including 
poor people throughout the State of 
Utah—not just the poor, but most peo-
ple—again, with inflation, during peri-
ods of inflation, the extremely wealthy 
can find ways to become even wealthi-
er, but everyone else suffers—literally, 
everyone else. The poorer you are, the 
more you suffer. Even people well-en-
trenched in the middle class get gouged 
considerably. Why we would want to 
take money away from them and give 
it to the wealthy is beyond my ability 
to fathom. 
All of this ties back to the reason I 
came to the floor today, which was to 
try to pass the PRICE Act by unani-
mous consent. We didn’t succeed today, 
but we are not going away. We are 
going to keep undertaking this effort 
because the fact is, we do need to im-
pose a supermajority requirement for 
spending, especially when spending lev-
els are producing inflation in excess of 
3 percent. We are at 9.1 percent nation-
ally. And in many of our States, in-
cluding my own, it is higher than that. 
That is why we need this. 
My colleague pointed out he believes 
that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may 
have contributed to that. Well, that is 
not exactly how things work. When you 
are passing a tax reform bill—a tax re-
form bill that makes downward adjust-
ments to marginal income tax rates 
and to corporate rates and capital 
gains rates—yes, it brings in less rev-
enue, but the government taking in 
less revenue doesn’t cause inflation. It 
is deficit spending that causes infla-
tion. 
Given that it is deficit spending—par-
ticularly deficit spending during peri-
ods of inflation—that matters, I believe 
that is where we ought to be focused. 
We ought to be focused on pro-growth 
opportunities. And, frankly, if those 
adjustments to corporate rates, to cap-
ital gains rates, and to marginal tax 
rates are, in fact, pro-growth, they re-
duce disincentives to work, they bring 
more people back into the labor mar-
ket, and that, in turn, produces more 
tax revenue. 
You can expand, broaden the base, 
while lowering their rates and, ulti-
mately, come out on top and with more 
robust economic growth. But what you 
can’t do is engage in increasingly more 
aggressive deficit spending and expect 
that is going to do anything but harm 
the American people, especially Amer-
ica’s poor and middle class. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Let me suggest to my 
friend from Utah that I agree with a 
lot of what he said about this legisla-
tion that we are going to be voting on 
within the hour. 
I would simply add that while this 
bill has had many names—lately, they 
call it the chips bill; it has also been 
called the China bill and so forth—but 
theoretically, it is supposed to be com-
peting against China. 
But I would point out that since 2005, 
Intel has invested at least $700 million 
in Chinese technology companies, in-
cluding 
at 
least 
four 
microchip 
startups. In 2020, 2 years ago, Intel in-
vested in two Chinese semiconductor 
startups, ProPlus and Spectrum Mate-
rials, as part of a $132 million invest-
ment in 11 startups, including 3 in 
China. So we are investing, ostensibly 
to protect us from China, in a company 
that, in fact, invests in China. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in a few 
minutes, I am going to put forward a 
request for the Senate to confirm the 
nomination of Rebecca Jones Gaston to 
serve as Commissioner on Children, 
Youth, and Families within the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices. I briefly want to talk about why 
her confirmation is so important and 
what makes her the right person for 
the job. 
The 
Administration 
on 
Children, 
Youth, and Families may not grab na-
tional headlines every day, but its 
work is essential to the well-being of 
millions of young people and families 
across the land. That is particularly 
true for vulnerable children, including 
those in the child welfare system. 
One of its big jobs over the last few 
years has been the implementation of 
the Family First Prevention Services 
Act. The landmark reform of the child 
welfare system was written by the Fi-
nance Committee on a bipartisan basis. 
And for colleagues who remember the 
late Orrin Hatch, who cared so much 
about children and particularly welfare 
reform, this and the extension of the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program 
for 10 years—the longest extension 
ever—were the two bills for children 
that 
Chairman 
Hatch 
really 
felt 
strongly about. 
The underlying goal of the legisla-
tion, which I was proud to cosponsor 
with him, was simple. The foster care 
system was breaking families up too 
often. We designed the Family First 
Act to keep families together whenever 
it was safe and possible to do so. Maybe 
a grandparent is the right person to 
step in as a caretaker for their 
grandkids. I have been particularly in-
volved in having grandparents play a 
bigger role in our human services pro-
grams. It is known as kinship care. We 
have been working on it for well over a 
decade. Chairman Hatch helped us ex-
pand it. Maybe all that is needed for a

family to thrive is to help with mental 
healthcare for mom or dad. And with a 
little more flexibility in the program, a 
little more support, more families stay 
together and get ahead. 
The underlying goal that Chairman 
Hatch and I had was simple, but imple-
mentation has certainly been a chal-
lenge. It has required a lot of close col-
laboration between the Department of 
Health and Human Services, the Fi-
nance Committee, and State and local 
agencies. 
My view is, when you are talking 
about reforms dealing with the well- 
being of our youngest, particularly 
most vulnerable kids, it is just critical 
to get it right. That is why Rebecca 
Jones Gaston is the right person to 
lead the Administration on Children, 
Youth, and Families. She serves as the 
child welfare director for Oregon’s De-
partment of Human Services. She is 
showing herself to be an effective lead-
er and a strong advocate for the vul-
nerable. She served in a similar role in 
the State of Maryland under a Repub-
lican Governor. So this is somebody 
who shows up every single day, willing 
to work with elected officials on both 
sides of the aisle. All in all, she brings 
nearly 25 years of experience in public 
policy dealing with support for families 
and children. 
The Finance Committee approved her 
nomination on a bipartisan basis in 
March. My view is, the full Senate has 
waited long enough. Ms. Gaston is a 
highly qualified nominee, and the Ad-
ministration on Children, Youth, and 
Families needs a confirmed leader. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate consider the following 
nomination: Calendar No. 763, Rebecca 
E. Jones Gaston to be Commissioner on 
Children, Youth, and Families, Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services; 
that the Senate vote on the nomina-
tion without intervening action or de-
bate; that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table; and that any statements related 
to the nomination be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, since last 
year, I have been asking for a commit-
ment from my Democrat colleagues 
that any future reconciliation legisla-
tion in this Congress will not incor-
porate policies that will reduce access 
to care in nonexpansion States such as 
Tennessee. Specifically, my concern is 
that 
this 
reconciliation 
legislation 
that the House of Representatives 
passed last fall included provisions 
that cut DSH and uncompensated care 
pool 
payments 
for 
nonexpansion 
States. This would result in less 
healthcare for vulnerable populations 
in my State, accelerate hospital clo-
sures in my State, and it would dis-
advantage rural communities in my 
State of Tennessee. These are places 
and populations for which we are try-
ing to secure more quality healthcare, 
not less. 
Because I have not received con-
firmation that these provisions will 
not be included in any future reconcili-
ation bill, I cannot consent to expe-
diting confirmation of this nominee, 
and I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just 
speaking briefly again, let me tell my 
colleague from Tennessee that I have 
very much enjoyed working with him 
on various policies here in the Senate. 
My understanding is that my col-
league believes that his State has some 
ideas for showing that you can essen-
tially meet Medicaid standards for 
health services for vulnerable people 
and that the State of Tennessee is in-
terested in trying out some new ap-
proaches. I want to assure my col-
league that we are interested in hear-
ing more about this. There is a specific 
waiver provision, for example, in the 
Affordable Care Act to try out new ap-
proaches consistent with these guard-
rails 
so 
that 
people 
actually 
get 
healthcare coverage. My colleague has 
said to me that he is interested in pur-
suing those kinds of ideas. I want him 
to know that the Finance Democratic 
staff is available to hear his staff out 
on this, and I hope we can work it out, 
and I hope we can move Rebecca Gas-
ton quickly. 
This is a program that really makes 
a difference. Prior to Chairman Hatch 
working with me on this, we had essen-
tially two alternatives for these vul-
nerable kids, neither of them particu-
larly valuable. One was just sending 
the kids off to foster care—some of 
those facilities are good; some of them, 
not so good—or keeping them at home 
in a less than desirable situation. What 
we did on a bipartisan basis is find a 
third path for these vulnerable young-
sters, where, for example, if a parent 
was having difficulty with alcohol or 
drugs, they could get treatment and 
stay as the parent. 
So this is an important program. Re-
becca Gaston knows how to run it well. 
I want to see her confirmed as quickly 
as possible, and I want to tell my col-
league I recognize his concern today 
and will be interested in following up 
with him and his staff to hear more 
about the program in the days ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today, I 
rise in support of the nomination of 
Rita Landgraf for the position of As-
sistant Secretary for Aging and Admin-
istrator of the Administration for Com-
munity Living at the Department of 
Health and Human Services. I have 
been privileged to know Rita Landgraf 
for over two decades and to have 
worked with her when I was Governor 
of Delaware and in the years since 
then. 
She is a longtime Delaware commu-
nity leader who previously served as 
cabinet secretary of the Delaware De-
partment of Health and Social Serv-
ices, which may be the most chal-
lenging job of any cabinet secretary in 
the State government of Delaware. 
There, she oversaw State implementa-
tion of the Older Americans Act, Med-
icaid, 
home- 
and 
community-based 
services, and disability services as 
well. She also had leadership roles with 
the State offices of AARP, the ARC, 
and the National Alliance on Mental 
Illness, which are key national part-
ners for initiatives within the Adminis-
tration for Community Living. 
Rita’s career has been inspired by her 
relationships with the elderly and 
those with disabilities, including her 
stepson. In addition to her extensive 
expertise, she will bring a personal pas-
sion to her work as Assistant Sec-
retary. Rita’s experience in leading or-
ganizations focused on advocating for 
people with disabilities and seniors, 
along with her time in State govern-
ment, makes her an excellent—an ex-
cellent—choice to serve as Assistant 
Secretary of Aging. I applaud President 
Biden for nominating her to serve in 
this role. 
The Administration for Community 
Living does critically important work 
ensuring older Americans of all ages 
with disabilities are able to live where 
they choose, with the people they 
choose, and with the ability to partici-
pate fully in their communities. The 
Administration for Community Living 
works through community-based orga-
nizations and invests in research, edu-
cation, and innovation that help make 
this priority a reality for millions of 
older Americans and people with dis-
abilities. 
Rita Landgraf is the right person for 
this job. As secretary of Delaware’s De-
partment of Health and Social Serv-
ices, Rita Landgraf successfully led one 
of the State’s largest cabinet agencies 
and expanded community-based serv-
ices aimed at helping older Americans 
age in place and people with disabil-
ities live, work, and participate in 
their communities—exactly the type of 
work the Administration for Commu-
nity Living supports. 
Rita is a powerful advocate and a 
convener of stakeholders and partners. 
She will bring partners together to fur-
ther the mission of the Administration 
for Community Living and bring new 
and innovative insight to address prior-
ities on aging that we can all agree 
upon. 
Rita wants older Americans to age in 
place. She believes in the strength and 
value of home- and community-based 
services for both the elderly and the 
disabled, especially in light of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. For Americans 
with mental health and special needs, 
Rita Landgraf has prioritized keeping 
folks in their homes and expanding em-
ployment 
opportunities 
for 
them— 
steps we can take to ensure that these 
vulnerable populations can be full par-
ticipants in their communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3359 
July 19, 2022 
I want to thank our chair, Chair 
MURRAY, and Ranking Member BURR 
for supporting Rita Landgraf’s nomina-
tion out of the Senate HELP Com-
mittee with strong bipartisan support. 
I urge my colleagues today to join 
me in confirming Rita Landgraf to 
serve as Assistant Secretary of Aging 
and Administrator of the Administra-
tion for Community Living. 
With that, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate consider the following 
nomination: Calendar No. 966, Rita M. 
Landgraf, to be Assistant Secretary for 
Aging, 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human Services; that the Senate vote 
on the nomination without intervening 
action or debate and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table; and that any state-
ments related to the nomination be 
printed in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, I have 
been asking for a commitment from 
my Democratic colleagues that any fu-
ture reconciliation legislation in this 
Congress will not incorporate policies 
that will reduce access to care in my 
home State of Tennessee. Reiterating, 
my concern is that the reconciliation 
legislation that the House passed last 
fall included provisions that cut DSH 
payments and uncompensated care pool 
payments 
for 
nonexpansion 
States 
which would result in less healthcare 
for vulnerable populations in my State, 
accelerate hospital closures, and dis-
advantage rural communities. These 
are places and populations for which 
we are trying to secure more quality 
healthcare, not less. 
Because I have still not received con-
firmation that these provisions will 
not be included in any future reconcili-
ation bill, I cannot consent to expe-
diting confirmation of this nominee, 
and I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if I 
could speak momentarily, I had an op-
portunity to speak briefly with our col-
league from Tennessee with respect to 
his concerns and the reasons that led 
him to object to what I think—and he 
may agree—is actually quite an excel-
lent nomination. And my hope is to 
better 
understand 
those 
objections 
that he has voiced and to see if they 
can be objected to in a way that would 
allow us to go forward with the nomi-
nation of Rita Landgraf to serve as As-
sistant Secretary for Aging for the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Rhode Island. 
SUICIDE PREVENTION 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would 
like to talk today about a health epi-
demic that is claiming the lives of tens 
of thousands of Americans each year. I 
am speaking about the epidemic of sui-
cide. 
I will talk more about this in detail 
in a moment, but if there is one thing 
I would like those listening to my re-
marks to remember is the number 9–8– 
8—9–8–8, because 9–8–8 is a three-digit 
number for the National Suicide Pre-
vention Lifeline. 
If you need help, please dial 9–8–8. 
Over the last several years, we have 
all observed the increasing mental 
health needs in our country. Indeed, 
the isolation of the COVID–19 pandemic 
made those needs more pronounced, 
particularly among children, adoles-
cents, and young adults. 
In October 2021, the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics, the American Acad-
emy of Child and Adolescent Psychi-
atry, and the Children’s Hospital Asso-
ciation—organizations representing ex-
perts in children’s mental health—de-
clared a national emergency in child 
and adolescent mental health. Accord-
ing to these organizations, ‘‘Rates of 
childhood mental health concerns and 
suicide rose steadily between 2010 and 
2020 and by 2018 suicide was the second 
leading cause of death for youth ages 
10–24. The pandemic has intensified 
this crisis: across the country we have 
witnessed dramatic increases in Emer-
gency Department visits for all mental 
health emergencies including suspected 
suicide attempts.’’ 
According to the National Alliance 
on Mental Illness, nearly 20 percent of 
high school students report serious 
thoughts of suicide, and about 9 per-
cent have tried to take their own lives. 
During the pandemic, children faced 
challenges we couldn’t have imagined 
just a few years ago. Children isolated 
from their friends and family members 
to limit the spread of COVID–19. But 
this meant that many children were 
separated from loved ones and other 
trusted adults like teachers who can 
help keep kids safe. And kids were iso-
lated from their peers, impeding social 
learning and development. And in these 
tough times, rates of domestic violence 
and child abuse tend to increase. On 
top of all these challenges, more than 
140,000 children in the United States 
lost a caregiver to COVID–19. And it is 
no wonder that so many of our children 
and young adults are in crisis. 
These hardships are not unique to 
young people. Adults are feeling them 
as well. Regrettably, suicide remains 
the leading cause of death in the 
United States. In 2020, suicide claimed 
the lives of 45,979 Americans, according 
to the latest data from the CDC. This 
is about one death every 11 minutes. 
More people died by suicide in 2020 
than in motor vehicle accidents. The 
number of people who think about or 
attempt suicide is even higher. In 2020, 
an estimated 12.2 million American 
adults seriously thought about suicide, 
3.2 million planned a suicide attempt, 
and 1.2 million attempted suicide. 
Now, there are no easy solutions, but 
there are things we can do to prevent 
suicide and improve access to mental 
health treatment. And we have made 
some progress. Almost two decades 
ago, we passed legislation to ensure 
parity in insurance coverage for men-
tal and behavioral health. We have 
more work to do to enforce the law, 
but it was an important first step. And 
one of the most significant invest-
ments 
we 
have 
made 
in 
mental 
healthcare was in passing the Afford-
able Care Act. We expanded health in-
surance coverage for millions of Ameri-
cans and made sure that coverage in-
cluded mental and behavioral care, 
which was often excluded from health 
insurance before the ACA. 
We need to do more though. More and 
more people need mental and behav-
ioral healthcare and do not have the 
resources to get such care. And those 
with the resources find that there 
aren’t enough providers to see them, 
even with good healthcare insurance. 
There simply aren’t enough clinicians 
for the need. And lastly, we need to 
better help people in crisis. We can’t 
get people into effective care for the 
long term if we haven’t stopped the im-
mediate crisis. That is why suicidal 
prevention efforts are so critical. 
As I alluded to earlier, last weekend, 
the National Suicide Prevention Life-
line made the switch from its long-
standing 10-digit number to an easy-to- 
remember 3-digit number, 9–8–8. 
In 2019, I joined my colleagues Sen-
ators 
TAMMY
BALDWIN
and 
JERRY 
MORAN and former Senator Cory Gard-
ner in introducing legislation requiring 
this switch. Our bill was signed into 
law the next year, and we have been 
working since then to make sure that 
9–8–8 has the funding to be able to han-
dle the influx of new callers. It is esti-
mated that the Lifeline will receive 
millions more calls with the new num-
ber, so we need trained people on the 
other end of the line ready to get peo-
ple the help that they need. 
When we started this effort, the Life-
line only received about $7 million in 
Federal funding each year. Last year, 
with the help of President Biden, Chair 
MURRAY and Chairman LEAHY, we were 
able to secure nearly $300 million for 
the Lifeline, and we are working to get 
the number up to $700 million next 
year. This level of funding will help en-
sure that calls are answered quickly 
and locally so that people calling can 
talk to someone from their State who 
will know exactly where to find nearby 
resources. We are also working toward 
a system in which mobile response 
teams can respond in real time and be 
deployed to help people in crisis who 
call. 
While the switch to 9–8–8 over the 
weekend was a huge step forward, we 
are just beginning to build a much 
broader system to help people in crisis 
across the country. I introduced the 
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 
Improvement Act with Senator MORAN 
last year to help move the Lifeline to-
ward a more comprehensive system.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3360 
July 19, 2022 
Pensions Committee passed this bipar-
tisan bill unanimously almost a year 
ago. It is time for the full Senate to 
take it up and pass it. 
Senator MORAN, I must point out, has 
been a true leader in these efforts. Re-
cently, we have teamed up in intro-
ducing the Suicide Prevention Act to 
try and intervene with those who may 
be in crisis but may not know to call 9– 
8–8 or reach out otherwise. The Suicide 
Prevention Act would fund prevention 
programs in hospital emergency de-
partments to better screen for suicide 
or mental health crises. This is impor-
tant because over 90 percent of people 
who attempt suicide have seen a 
healthcare provider—often a visit to a 
hospital, particularly an emergency 
room—in the weeks and days prior to 
their attempt. As these people are ac-
cessing the healthcare system, the 
mental health issues that really are 
driving them to seek medical attention 
are often overlooked. There are evi-
dence-based strategies that healthcare 
professionals can employ to intervene 
before it is too late, but they need the 
training and the resources in order to 
do so. The bill would also strengthen 
data collection on suicide so we can 
better direct resources where they are 
needed most. 
We also need to respond to the chal-
lenges facing young people. Back in 
2004, I joined my former colleague Sen-
ator Gordon Smith in introducing the 
Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, 
which was named for his son Garrett, 
who tragically lost his life to suicide 
the day before his 22nd birthday. This 
tragedy drove home the realization 
that suicide and mental health crises 
are so common among young people. 
Our legislation authorized new fund-
ing for youth suicide prevention pro-
grams in States and on college cam-
puses. Since it was first enacted, the 
Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act has 
delivered roughly $750 million in sui-
cide prevention funding nationally. 
And I am pleased that Senator LISA 
MURKOWSKI, another longstanding part-
ner and champion on this issue, joined 
me in introducing the reauthorization 
of this law so we can continue funding 
programs to support youth and young 
adults. 
Mental health and suicide have for 
too long been subjects that have been 
difficult to talk about, much less con-
front. In meeting the challenge of this 
mental health crisis, we must be re-
lentless. We cannot just do one thing 
or even a few things because there is no 
single solution. 
A few days ago, President Biden 
signed the Bipartisan Safer Commu-
nities Act, which included new re-
sources for mental healthcare, includ-
ing an additional $150 million for im-
plementation of 9–8–8 and billions of 
dollars for other mental health services 
such as the nationwide expansion of 
the Certified Community Behavioral 
Health Clinic model. But that cannot 
be the end of our work. 
Each of the efforts and bills I have 
mentioned represent our continuing 
and unfinished work. They would add 
another layer to help prevent suicide 
and strengthen our mental healthcare 
system. 
So I urge my colleagues to work with 
me and my colleagues like Senator 
MORAN and Senator MURKOWSKI to pass 
the Suicide Prevention Act, the Na-
tional Suicide Prevention Lifeline Im-
provement Act, the Garrett Lee Smith 
Memorial Act reauthorization, and to 
undertake many other efforts spear-
headed by my colleagues. We should 
move forward with these measures 
without delay to prevent another 45,000 
Americans from falling victim to sui-
cide. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SEMICONDUCTORS 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
know we are expecting a vote soon 
here, and I know that our colleagues 
know that we will have two votes—one 
on a nominee and the second one on a 
motion to proceed to what has been 
known as the Innovation and Competi-
tion Act. I just wanted to say, because 
I know there have been a few people 
out here on the floor—and I won’t 
spend a lot of time now—that, hope-
fully, we will proceed on the motion to 
proceed and that we will have a much 
larger discussion. 
I do want to clarify that today’s vote 
is really about whether we are going to 
stop shipping jobs overseas and instead 
invest in American R&D. If we invest 
in American R&D, then we will see the 
plant, like is being talked about in 
Ohio, get built instead of getting im-
mediately built in Europe. We will see 
other companies make investments in 
States like Texas and Arizona and 
Idaho and in many other parts of the 
United States. We will help build an 
ecosystem here in the United States of 
technology and next-generation devel-
opment. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote for 
a bill that makes an investment and 
competes 
with 
the 
next-generation 
semiconductors so that we can go even 
faster with innovation than we are cur-
rently doing because so much of that 
development is happening overseas. It 
is happening in Taiwan, and it is hap-
pening in Korea. They have had ‘‘game 
on’’ for a while. They have had ‘‘game 
on’’ and have literally taken a page out 
of what the United States has done to 
attract and keep industry here. Innova-
tion is in the DNA of Americans, and if 
we want to create the economy of the 
future, we need to invest in the R&D of 
today. That means passing this next 
motion to proceed, getting on the bill, 
and passing as much of it as we can 
today. That way, we can be assured 
that we are not going to lose out in 
this round of investment that is, yes, 
very challenging on a global basis. 
We should be really realistic. We 
have a chip shortage today, and it is 
costing our economy, and it is increas-
ing inflation. We know that there is 
going to be a chip demand that is going 
to be threefold from where we are 
today in the very near future. That 
means, if we don’t start building here, 
we are not going to catch up. More im-
portantly is the national security ele-
ment of making sure that the United 
States is making the most advanced 
semiconductors. 
So today’s vote is to say to our col-
leagues that we believe in the R&D 
ecosystem of the United States—we be-
lieve in the NSF; we believe in our uni-
versities; we believe in the DOE—and 
that 
we 
believe 
that 
we 
can 
do 
translational science and help our 
manufacturing base be more competi-
tive whether it is autos or airplanes or 
other aspects of the tech sector. 
This underlying bill invests in 10 key 
technology areas that we need to make 
investments in, and it makes sure that 
we in the United States of America are 
saying: We want to see that innovation 
here. We want to see these in tech hubs 
and in tech centers. We want our uni-
versities to translate that science fast-
er and keep our patents and make sure 
that we are, obviously, continuing to 
lead the world in innovation. If we fail 
to do this, I guarantee you that more 
jobs are going to go overseas. 
American R&D can create the hub of 
innovation that we would like to see 
for the future. We have done it many 
times over. We just need to proceed to 
make sure that we are aware of the 
competition that exists around the 
globe. The United States is up to it; it 
is capable of competing; and this insti-
tution is also capable of making deci-
sions and proceeding by working to-
gether. Trust me. That is what people 
are looking at around the world. 
Whether they are in Europe or Asia, 
they want to know whether we know 
how to get things done. 
Let’s show them that American inno-
vation is here to stay; that it is the top 
of the game; and that we can compete 
with anyone given the right invest-
ments in STEM, job training, edu-
cation, and in taking that ecosystem 
that is so unique and making an in-
vestment in it. 
I yield the floor. 
NOMINATION OF JULIANNA MICHELLE CHILDS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate continues its work 
confirming experienced and fair-mind-
ed nominees to the Federal judiciary. 
Today, we will vote to confirm Judge 
Julianna Michelle Childs to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Co-
lumbia Circuit. With over 15 years of 
experience as a judge, Judge Childs is 
exceptionally qualified to serve on the 
D.C. Circuit. As a district court judge 
for the District of South Carolina since 
2010, Judge Childs has presided over al-
most 5,000 civil and criminal matters,

including 50 jury trials and 11 bench 
trials. During this time, she has been 
reversed or vacated on appeal in fewer 
than 1 percent of her cases, an impres-
sive record for any District Court 
Judge. 
Before joining the Federal bench, 
Judge Childs served for 4 years as a cir-
cuit court judge for the South Carolina 
Judicial Department, where she pre-
sided over thousands of State court 
matters. Judge Childs also served as a 
commissioner on the South Carolina 
Workers’ Compensation Commission, 
adjudicating administrative decisions 
and reviewing administrative appeals. 
Prior to her judicial service, Judge 
Childs served South Carolina as the 
deputy director of the division of labor 
for the South Carolina Department of 
Labor, Licensing and Regulation. In 
this position, she administered State 
and Federal programs. Given that the 
D.C. Circuit hears more cases involving 
administrative law than any other cir-
cuit court, this practical experience 
with administrative law will be an 
asset to the court. 
Before her time in public service, 
Judge Childs worked in private prac-
tice as a civil litigator, and she ulti-
mately became the first Black woman 
in South Carolina to become a partner 
in a large law firm—only 8 years after 
joining her firm. 
Judge Childs is also the first member 
of her family to go to college, and she 
graduated with her B.S. cum laude 
from the University of South Florida 
Honors College. She then received her 
J.D. and M.A. at the University of 
South Carolina. While serving as a dis-
trict court judge, Judge Childs also 
earned her LL.M. at Duke University 
School of Law. 
The American Bar Association has 
unanimously rated Judge Childs as 
‘‘well qualified’’ to serve on the D.C. 
Circuit. Her outstanding qualifications 
make it no surprise that she has re-
ceived strong, bipartisan support from 
her home State’s delegation, most no-
tably from Congressman and Majority 
Whip CLYBURN and my colleague on the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator 
GRAHAM. 
With her extensive judicial service at 
the State and Federal level, her experi-
ence administering State and Federal 
programs, and her historic career in 
private practice, Judge Childs will be 
ready to serve the D.C. Circuit with 
distinction on day one.

CHIPS ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
few moments, the Senate will take the 
first procedural vote on the chips bill 
that will fight inflation, boost Amer-
ican manufacturing, ease our supply 
chains, and protect American security 
interests. 
This is one of the important votes 
that we will take this session, because 
advancing this bill is crucial for low-
ering costs, solving our Nation’s chip 
shortage, and making sure America re-
mains competitive in the 21st century. 
America will fall behind in so many 
areas if we don’t pass this bill, and we 
could very well lose our ranking as the 
No. 1 economy and innovator in the 
world if we can’t pass this. 
Lower costs, more jobs, a stronger 
economy—that is the recipe behind 
this bill, and it spells good news for the 
American people today and for decades 
to come. 
I want to thank both my Democratic 
and Republican colleagues for working 
together for more than a year on these 
policies. I want to thank Senator CANT-
WELL, our very able, dedicated, and 
hard-working committee chair, as well 
as Senators WICKER and CORNYN and 
WARNER and KELLY and SINEMA, as well 
as our conference members, as well as 
the many individual Senators on both 
sides who contributed to this legisla-
tion. This has been bipartisan work in 
the Senate at its best—something we 
have done on several pieces of legisla-
tion this year—and I hope we can do 
more and do it more often. 
Now, on the procedure, Members 
should know this vote will be a test 
vote, and a favorable outcome will 
allow the science portion of USICA to 
be included in this bill. 
Let me explain. This vote will be a 
motion to proceed on a House message, 
which we will use as a vehicle to pass 
our chips legislation. It only requires 
50 votes to proceed, but if we can get 
enough votes to comfortably withstand 
a filibuster, I will amend this chips, 
ITC, and ORAN bill to include the 
science provisions that so many of my 
colleagues, led by Senators Cantwell 
and Wicker, have worked on so hard to 
secure. 
I want everyone to understand, a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this motion to proceed 
indicates Members will vote yes on clo-
ture on a package that includes chips, 
ITC, ORAN, and the science provision. 
As you all know, I am a strong sup-
porter of the science provisions. I was 
the original author, along with Senator 
YOUNG, of many of these policies under 
the Endless Frontier Act. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
this vote, and I thank Senator YOUNG 
for his 2-year partnership on this legis-
lation. However, folks, if this vote 
doesn’t produce enough votes to com-
fortably withstand a filibuster, we will 
move forward with the chips, ORAN, 
and ITC provisions here on the floor. It 
is my preference for the Senate to in-
clude the science provisions in this bill 
because they are so important for the 
future of our country. 
I am very optimistic we will see a 
strong bipartisan vote later today.

Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I

talk about Russia’s brutal invasion of 
Ukraine. Before I do, though, I want to 
pause for a minute and honor the lives 
lost in the downing of Malaysian Air-
lines

MH17

Ukraine, 
knocked down by Russian and Russian- 
backed separatists. This week marks

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3363 
July 19, 2022 
on Ukraine didn’t just start this 
spring. Eight years ago, the people of 
Ukraine made a courageous choice. 
They said that they were going to 
stand up to a corrupt Russian-backed 
regime. And when they did that, Russia 
responded by invading their country, 
taking Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula but 
also territory here in what is called the 
Donbas. So this is not new. For almost 
9 years, the people of Ukraine have 
been fighting this war with Russia. 
More recently, of course, the invasion 
was even more devastating. 
So I join Bridget Brink, who is our 
new U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, who 
said: 
[We] honor the memories of those killed 
eight years ago—even as missiles continue to 
fall on Mykolaiv, Dnipro, and other Ukrain-
ian 
cities, 
killing 
civilians 
and 
dem-
onstrating the Kremlin’s disregard for inter-
national law and human life.’’ 
She is right. Ambassador Brink said 
it right. The civilian toll in this war is 
devastating. Ukraine’s Prosecutor Gen-
eral recently said that since late Feb-
ruary of this year, 353 children have 
died in this war and more than 1,000 
have been wounded. 
The Associated Press painted a vivid 
picture of this with a story about the 
killing of a 4-year-old girl named Liza, 
Liza Dmytrieva. Liza had Down syn-
drome and was on her way to see a 
speech therapist last Thursday when 
her mother and she were attacked by 
Russian missiles. She was in a town 
called Vinnytsia. At least 24 people 
were killed that day, including Liza 
and two boys who were 7 and 8 years 
old. Almost 200 were wounded. Liza’s 
mother is still in intensive care. 
It is important to know that when 
the war started, Liza’s family fled Kyiv 
but stayed in Ukraine, fleeing to this 
town, Vinnytsia, about 167 miles south-
west of Kyiv. 
They thought they could be safe 
there. It is well behind enemy lines. It 
is well behind the frontlines of the bat-
tle. Yet this is the reality of President 
Putin’s war on Ukraine. It is targeting 
civilians. But it won’t just stop in 
Ukraine. 
This is why Finland and Sweden, in a 
move that just a few years ago would 
have seemed impossible, left a history 
of neutrality behind and joined NATO. 
Their application is currently in place. 
They see President Putin’s brutal war, 
and they know that they could be next. 
Last week, I mentioned on the floor 
that as recently as 2016, President 
Putin said ‘‘The borders of Russia 
never end.’’ It bears repeating because 
he and other Kremlin leaders seem in-
tent on restoring the Russian empire, 
even if it means rolling over other free 
and independent countries. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee took a momentous step today 
by voting to ratify the NATO applica-
tions for these two allies of the United 
States: Sweden and Finland. I was 
proud to vote to ratify and speak in 
committee about why this expansion is 
so good for our national security to 
have these two countries with strong 
militaries and strong economies join 
our NATO alliance. I hope that the 
leadership of the Senate will put this 
legislation on the floor as soon as pos-
sible so that we can show the world 
that we are enthusiastically supporting 
the joining of these two countries to 
the NATO alliance. 
We need to continue to demonstrate 
global solidarity in this war. President 
Putin, of course, had hoped to divide 
NATO and divide Europe and divide the 
West, but he underestimated what 
would happen. He underestimated the 
foresight and wisdom of the people of 
Sweden and Finland, just as he under-
estimated the courage and resiliency of 
the people of Ukraine. 
On the energy front, a significant de-
velopment that isn’t getting nearly 
enough attention happened last week. 
Back in June, Russia cut gas to Europe 
via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline by 60 
percent because of ‘‘maintenance prob-
lems.’’ They claimed they needed gas 
turbines that had gone to Canada to be 
repaired to be able to continue the flow 
of the pipeline. Those turbines were 
prohibited from being returned to Rus-
sia because of the sanctions that are in 
place with regard to Russian energy in-
frastructure. 
Of course, what President Putin’s 
government claims to be true is often 
not. The reality is Russia was pun-
ishing Europe and trying to poke holes 
in the Western sanctions regime. Un-
fortunately, the Russians succeeded. 
What happened next was discouraging. 
Canada gave in to Russia’s demands 
last week and returned the gas tur-
bines, and then the State Department 
applauded this move saying that some-
how, it was standing up to Russia’s en-
ergy blackmail. 
I understand the administration’s de-
sire to preserve allied unity in the face 
of Russian aggression. That is impor-
tant, especially in our effort to stand 
up against Russia over the long term. 
But if we are unified behind a bad pol-
icy, then that unity doesn’t do us much 
good. 
We saw this with Nord Stream 2, re-
member, when the Biden administra-
tion sided with Germany to remove 
sanctions on the pipeline, even though 
that decision undermined the security 
of our allies, including Ukraine. And I 
think it sent the wrong message, the 
wrong message to Russia, and it is one 
reason that they felt empowered to in-
vade Ukraine more recently. 
Now we are seeing the same thing 
here. In the name of preserving unity 
with certain allies, we are giving in to 
Russia’s demands. As I said, unity with 
our allies is important, I get that. But 
instead of settling for weak policy, we 
should be pushing our allies to adopt 
stronger policies against Russia, in-
cluding with regard to energy. 
Unfortunately, Russia knows that by 
manufacturing a ‘‘maintenance prob-
lem’’ with their pipelines, our allies 
tend to back down on our sanctions. I 
wonder when will the next ‘‘mainte-
nance problem’’ appear. 
President Zelenskyy has called the 
return of these gas turbines to Russia 
‘‘absolutely unacceptable.’’ But the 
Biden administration characterizes it 
as a counter to Russia’s attempt to 
weaponize energy. This just isn’t the 
case. 
It is worth noting that another crisis 
is looming as a result of this war and is 
the direct result of Russia’s blockade 
of Ukraine’s ports, especially the port 
at Odesa. Here is the Odesa Port. There 
are other ports along this area into the 
Black Sea that are absolutely essential 
for Ukraine’s exports, and yet Russia is 
blocking them. 
Here, I cannot overstate the impor-
tance of this issue as Ukraine supplies 
so much of the world’s food. And with-
out ports to export, that food is not 
making it to the people who need it 
badly, and it is causing food shortages 
around the world. Let me be clear: 
Food should never be used as a weapon 
of war. But that is exactly what Presi-
dent Putin is doing. 
The effects are far-reaching. Accord-
ing to the World Food Programme, in-
creases in the cost of food and fuel 
since March have caused 47 million 
people to experience food insecurity, 
and of those, some 50 million are living 
close to famine. And that number 
grows every single day. 
To be specific, according to the Wall 
Street Journal: 
In 
Somalia, 
Ethiopia, 
South 
Sudan, 
Yemen, and Afghanistan, nearly 900,000 peo-
ple already face starvation and death. That 
is more than 10-fold [the] increase from 
2019—and, by some estimates, could result in 
more people dying from hunger in 2022 and 
2023 than in any year since the 1960s and 
[the] China’s disastrous Great Leap Forward 
agricultural policies. 
Wow. The World Food Programme 
provides aid for these countries, but 
there are shortages because of Russia’s 
war of choice, and the cost of that aid 
has risen tremendously. They report 
that their costs have jumped 46 percent 
compared with 2019. That is about 50 
percent over the last few years. And 
any organization, let alone one that 
provides humanitarian aid, would have 
immense problems keeping up. There 
are increases in everyday items, like 
vegetable oils and special nutritional 
pastes given to children who are in 
famine or malnourished. 
While these problems persist, it is 
the most vulnerable among us who 
truly feel the cost of malnourishment. 
It is the kids and the children who are 
most at risk from the effects of hunger. 
Their bodies, from the lack of nutri-
ents from food, are too weak to fight 
off diseases such as measles or cholera. 
Even those who survive these terrible 
illnesses will often face long-term 
health problems that could impact 
them forever. 
So we are not only facing a brutal in-
vasion of Ukraine. We have talked 
about that. War crimes are being com-
mitted there every day. But there is 
also a humanitarian crisis that is tak-
ing its toll around the world, as we 
speak, as a result of this war on

Ukraine and the blockade of these 
ports. This is a battle on so many 
fronts, and we have to face the realities 
of this head-on. 
In a war that was thought to be over 
within weeks, the fighting has contin-
ued well beyond that and may continue 
for much longer. It has already gone on 
longer than most people expected. And 
while Ukrainians continue to show 
their fortitude and strength, the world 
feels the effects of this through the 
global fallout. 
Ukraine’s First Lady Olena Zelenska 
will speak to Congress tomorrow about 
the damaging effects of this war, just 
as her husband, President Zelenskyy, 
addressed these Chambers in March. I 
look forward to hearing what she has 
to say. She has been a passionate advo-
cate for the rights of innocent Ukrain-
ian citizens who have been killed and 
wounded by these Russian attacks. She 
has even started her own initiative to 
address the mental health impacts of 
Russia’s terrible war and the trauma 
that the people of Ukraine have experi-
enced. 
That 
is 
the 
kind 
of 
leadership 
Ukraine needs. Frankly, it is the kind 
of leadership the world needs. She and 
her husband should be commended for 
their bravery in the face of tyranny 
and their steadfastness through the de-
struction that Vladimir Putin has 
caused her beloved homeland. 
In Ukraine, the stakes remain high. 
The casualties, both civilian and pro-
fessional soldiers alike, go into the 
thousands—thousands. The damage to 
Ukraine’s infrastructure—their beau-
tiful cities, ports, schools, hospitals, 
daycares, and apartment buildings— 
goes into the billions. 
This is a photograph of an apartment 
building that was recently bombed in 
the eastern part of Ukraine, killing, of 
course, innocent civilians. According 
to the Kyiv School of Economics, 
Ukraine will need at least $165 billion 
for postwar reconstruction. Per their 
latest update, almost half of these 
losses 
are 
attributable to housing 
losses like this one, civilian targets of 
Russia’s unrelenting bombing cam-
paign. 
Neighborhoods, 
residential 
areas, homes, and apartments have 
been hit by these Russian airstrikes. 
These are acts of terror. I am a co-
sponsor of Senator GRAHAM’s resolu-
tion to urge the Biden administration 
to name Russia a state sponsor of ter-
ror. I urge leadership to bring this to a 
vote. We voted it out of committee al-
ready. It is on the floor. Let’s take it 
up. 
So what happens next? We know that 
making any territorial concessions to 
Russia would only embolden President 
Putin and other future would-be con-
querors. The lesson they would learn is 
that, with enough patience, they can 
wear down the West and get what they 
want. We must not let that happen, and 
the people of Ukraine and the brave 
President certainly know this. We 
must do more quickly to arm Ukraine 
and help them to be able to protect 
themselves and to be able to win this 
war. 
It is clear that President Putin un-
derestimated the courage, the effec-
tiveness, and the resiliency of the 
Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian 
military, and now President Putin 
knows what the Ukrainians are capable 
of. And, by the way, the Russian forces 
also understand this. 
On Monday, Russian Defense Min-
ister Sergei Shoigu told Russian troops 
to hit Ukraine’s High Mobility Artil-
lery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS. He 
asked them to do so because of the suc-
cess the Ukrainians have had with just 
eight of these HIMARS units. These 
are systems from the United States. 
Many of us have pushed very hard to 
get these to Ukraine. They went too 
late. Many lives were lost and cities 
were flattened because they did not 
have them early on. 
These rocket systems are absolutely 
essential because, before that, the Rus-
sians could sit back and indiscrimi-
nately bomb Ukrainian cities and 
Ukrainian soldiers and civilians and 
the Ukrainian artillery could not reach 
them. These HIMARS systems have a 
longer range and are more accurate, 
and they have been quite effective. 
Only eight systems are there now, 
also three from the UK and a few from 
Germany. They need a lot more. But 
just this week, because of these sys-
tems, Ukrainian forces killed a Russian 
commander after a HIMARS hit a Rus-
sian control and command center here 
in the south of Ukraine. Last week, 
HIMARS took out a Russian ammuni-
tion warehouse in the same region. 
They have now taken out a couple 
dozen of these ammo depots, especially 
here in the south and here in the east. 
That is incredibly important because, 
by reducing the Russian ammunition 
stores, it will be much more likely that 
the Russians will realize that this war 
is damaging them, their equipment, 
their soldiers, and be more willing to 
come to the bargaining table. 
If this is what the Ukrainians can do 
with just eight HIMARS, imagine what 
they could do with what they have 
been asking for and what they really 
need, which is around 40 or 50 of these 
units. These weapons are crucial to the 
brave Ukrainian fighters as Ukraine 
continues its effort to defend itself 
from these Russian airstrikes and mis-
sile strikes. 
Finally, Ukrainian forces have mis-
siles with adequate range to reach 
these Russian missiles, to reach these 
ammo depots, to reach these command 
posts. Russia will still have the advan-
tage, of course, of more missiles, more 
men, and more rockets, and their at-
tacks are relentless. 
President Zelenskyy highlighted this 
when he said on Monday that Russia 
has fired thousands of cruise missiles 
and rockets during this war—thou-
sands. These often come in the middle 
of the night and hit residential areas 
and city infrastructure in places like 
Nikopol, a city that is located here, 
right near Kherson. Rockets have also 
hit apartment complexes, as we saw, 
and shopping malls. 
Here is a shopping mall that Rus-
sians attacked a few weeks ago. This is 
a shopping mall, much as you would 
see in the United States of America. It 
was full of people who were out shop-
ping on a summer day, maybe buying 
clothes, maybe buying some food. Over 
20 shoppers were killed at this shopping 
center, and over 56 people were wound-
ed. 
This shopping center, by the way, 
was in the central part of Ukraine. If 
you look at the map, this is not any-
where near the war zone, more up in 
this area, in the middle part of 
Ukraine. So bombings of shopping cen-
ters, apartments, schools, hospitals—it 
is really hard to imagine, but it is hap-
pening. 
We can help Ukraine fight back. 
Again, the best way is provide them 
with more weapons like the HIMARS 
that they need. We have hundreds in 
our stocks, by the way. It is more crit-
ical than ever that the United States 
and our allies support Ukraine to try 
to turn the tide. Only that will get 
Russia to the bargaining table. 
Meanwhile, we must continue to ex-
pose the brutality. Much of the media 
attention has gone away while lives 
continue to be lost and cities continue 
to be bombarded. We need to keep let-
ting people know about these atroc-
ities. 
That is why I am here on the floor of 
the Senate for the 18th consecutive 
week to talk about what is happening 
to the people of Ukraine, what has hap-
pened in the past week, and why they 
deserve and need our help. 
Ukrainians are fighting because they 
know what it is like to live under the 
thumb of authoritarianism. They have 
been subject to that through their his-
tory, and, more recently, they broke 
away from that and toward democracy 
in 1991 and again in 2014. 
It is important to note that Ukraine 
is not asking us to fight this war for 
them. They just want us to help them, 
along with our allies, to be able to have 
the tools they need to protect them-
selves. They are asking us for increased 
lethal military assistance to help de-
fend themselves, and they are asking 
all of us to abide by the commitments 
that we have made. 
In 1994, after the Berlin Wall came 
down, Ukraine signed what is called 
the Budapest Memorandum. It was a 
treaty where Ukraine agreed to give up 
all of its nuclear weapons—and they 
had a lot of them—in exchange for se-
curity guarantees from Russia, the 
United States of America, and the 
United Kingdom—guarantees that we 
would all respect the independence and 
sovereignty of Ukraine and refrain 
from the threat or use of force against 
Ukraine. That was in 1994—so much for 
Russia’s commitment. 
I have seen the spirit and persever-
ance of Ukrainians firsthand when I 
have visited the country. I have been

there seven, eight, nine times. I was 
there right after the Revolution of Dig-
nity, as it is called, in 2014, when 
Ukrainians decided to turn away from 
a Russian-backed and corrupt govern-
ment and stand with us and Europe to 
pursue a hopeful future of freedom and 
democracy. 
Now, it is time for us and our allies 
to stand with them. The world must 
know that freedom-loving countries 
around the globe have Ukraine’s back 
and we will be there until the bitter 
end. President Putin must know that 
we will not back down as he orders the 
ruthless slaughter of more innocents. 
At the beginning of my speech, I 
talked about this 4-year-old girl. Liza’s 
death occurred because of these rocket 
attacks. 
At 
her 
funeral, 
Orthodox 
priest Vitalii Holoskevych said this: 
‘‘We know that evil cannot win.’’ 
‘‘We know that evil cannot win.’’ And 
maybe that is the bottom line here 
today. This is a struggle between free-
dom and democracy and the right of 
self-determination on the one hand and 
evil on the other hand—the evil of con-
quest, the evil of authoritarianism, the 
evil of tyranny. Now is not the time to 
be tentative or equivocal. At this crit-
ical juncture, we need to work with our 
allies to provide Ukraine what they 
need to defeat evil, to protect their 
homeland, and to defend democracy.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Belgium—F–16 Sustainment 
The Government of Belgium has requested 
to buy additional F–16 sustainment support 
that will be added to a previously imple-
mented case. The original FMS case, valued 
at $98.4 million, included F–16 sustainment, 
consisting of AN/ARC–210 radios; classified 
software, Computer Program Identification 
Numbers (CPINs), and software integration 
support; Electronic Warfare (EW) database 
support; test support and equipment; aircraft 
and munitions support and support equip-
ment; flight simulator support; additional 
hardware and software delivery and support; 
spare and repair parts, consumables and ac-
cessories; 
maintenance 
and 
maintenance 
support; 
mission 
planning 
system 
sustainment; facilities, utilities, and infor-
mation technology support at U.S. Air Force 
bases; classified and unclassified publica-
tions and technical documentation; and U.S. 
Government and contractor 
engineering, 
technical and logistics support services, 
studies and surveys; and other related ele-
ments of logistical and program support. 
This notification will include more of the 
same items and services. The estimated total 
cost is $127 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by improving the security 
of a NATO ally which is an important force 
for political stability and economic progress 
in Europe. 
The proposed sale will improve Belgium’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by maintaining its F–16 fleet in com-
bat-ready status and providing rotational 
forces to NATO’s Eastern flank. Belgium will 
have no difficulty absorbing these articles 
and services into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin, Bethesda, MD. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Belgium. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AN/ARC–210 is a voice communica-
tions radio system equipped with HAVE 
QUICK II, which employs cryptographic 
technology. Other waveforms may be in-
cluded as needed. 
2. The Electronic Warfare Integrated Re-
programming Database (EWIRDB) is used by 
USG engineers in the reprogramming and 
creation of shareable Mission Data Files for 
the AN/ALQ–131 electronic countermeasures 
pod on the F–16 aircraft. 
3. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
4. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
5. A determination has been made that Bel-
gium can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
6. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Bel-
gium.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
United Arab Emirates—C–17 Aircraft 
Sustainment 
The Government of the United Arab Emir-
ates (UAE) has requested to buy follow-on 
sustainment and support of C–17 fleet to in-
clude aircraft hardware and software modi-
fications and support; Joint Mission Plan-
ning System (JMPS) software; classified 
software support for Electronic Warfare 
(EW) self-protection; aircraft and engine sup-
port equipment, components, consumables, 
spare parts and repair/return; publications

been, and continues to be, a vital U.S. part-
ner for political stability and economic 
progress in the Middle East. 
The proposed renewal of C–17 aircraft sup-
port will provide the Government of the UAE 
with a credible defense capability, provide 
strategic and humanitarian airlift, and en-
sure interoperability with U.S. forces. The 
UAE already operates the C–17 and will have 
no 
difficulty 
absorbing 
the 
additional 
sustainment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor will be The Boeing 
Company, Chicago, IL. The purchaser typi-
cally requests offsets. Any offset agreement 
will be defined in negotiations between the 
purchaser and the contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale may 
require the assignment of up to twelve (12) 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the UAE. Implementation of this 
proposed sale will require periodic Program 
Management Reviews in the United States or 
in the UAE. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

GLOBAL LEARNING LOSS 
ASSESSMENT ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about the bipartisan 
Global Learning Loss Assessment Act, 
S. 552, which I introduced along with 
Senator BOOZMAN last year. This bill 
requires the U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development, or USAID, to 
submit a report to Congress that as-
sesses learning loss, identifies gaps in 
access to education, and outlines the 
response that is needed to help stu-
dents recover from COVID–19 and reach 
their full potential. I applaud the ad-
vancement of this bill, which was voted 
on favorably in the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee earlier today and 
will now move to the Senate floor for 
consideration. I should note that the 
House companion bill passed the House 
in June 2021. So it is time for the Sen-
ate to act. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has forced 
schools around the world to suspend in- 
person learning as a measure to con-
tain the spread of the virus and safe-
guard public health. Even before the 
pandemic began, UNESCO reported 
that 258 million children were out of 
school globally, including 130 million 
girls. Now, the pandemic has disrupted 
the education of an estimated 90 per-
cent of the world’s student popu-
lation—over 1.6 billion children and 
youth—who saw their schools close at 
some point due to COVID–19. 
We already know that school closures 
lead to interrupted learning, poor nu-
trition, gaps in childcare, increased 
dropout rates, exposure to violence, 
and social isolation. What is more, stu-
dents already at a disadvantage before 
COVID–19 
will 
experience 
greater 
learning loss, thereby worsening in-
equity and inequality in education. 
School closures are especially bur-
densome for girls, who are frequently 
expected to shoulder more household 
responsibilities and are more vulner-
able to gender-based violence—GBV. 
For example, according to a study by 
the United Nations Development Pro-
gram, school closures in Sierra Leone 
necessitated by the Ebola pandemic led 
to increased instances of sexual- and 
gender-based violence, teenage preg-
nancy, school dropout, and child labor 
for girls. 
Restrictions associated with COVID– 
19 have also made girls more vulner-
able to child and early forced marriage. 
The United Nations Population Fund— 
UNFPA—estimates that 13,000,000 more 
child marriages could take place by 
2030 than would have without the pan-
demic, and when a girl gets married, 
her education almost always stops. 
When school closures occur, a signifi-
cant percentage of distance learning 
alternatives rely exclusively on online 
platforms. 
However, 
according 
to 
UNICEF, two-thirds of the world’s 
school-aged children do not have an 
internet connection in their homes, 
with that number rising to about 90 
percent of students in sub-Saharan Af-
rica. Furthermore, schools and local 
learning centers frequently have inad-
equate internet connectivity. 
The Global Learning Loss Assess-
ment Act will help improve the quality 
and reach of international education 
assistance by giving Congress the in-
formation we need to assess the status 
of education worldwide. The critical in-
formation included in the report pro-
duced by USAID will be used to inform 
future 
policy, 
oversight, 
and 
pro-
grammatic decisions by Congress and 
USAID, and will help ensure that our 
partner countries are better prepared 
to respond to future crises that could 
disrupt the education system. 
Specifically, the USAID report shall 
include: an assessment of learning loss 
globally and of the impact on U.S. 
basic education programs; an overview 
of distance learning in low resource 
contexts; a description of the barriers 
to education or distance learning for 
marginalized children; data on USAID 
programs that have been supporting 
learning during the pandemic; an over-
view of how USAID has, independently 
and in coordination with partners, 
adapted basic education programming 
during the COVID–19 pandemic to sup-
port continued learning; and a descrip-
tion of the authorities and resources 
USAID needs to continue to support 
education programs during and after 
the pandemic to mitigate learning loss 
and help students get back on track. 
The Global Learning Loss Assess-
ment Act has been endorsed by several 
important NGOs, including the Basic 
Education Coalition, Cambridge Edu-
cation, 
Catholic 
Relief 
Services, 
Chemonics 
International, 
Childhood 
Education International, Food for the 
Hungry, Global Campaign for Edu-
cation-US, 
Jesuit 
Refugee 
Service/ 
USA, Luminos Fund, RESULTS, RISE 
Institute, RTI International, Save the 
Children, 
Unbounded 
Associates, 
UNICEF USA, World Education, and 
World Learning. 
I look forward to the opportunity for 
this important bill supporting edu-
cation worldwide to be adopted by the 
Senate.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, fol-
lowing my submission yesterday, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD the next part of an inves-
tigation directed by the U.S. Central 
Command concerning the Abbey Gate 
bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
ACTS-SCK-DO 
SUBJECT: 
Findings 
and Recommenda-
tion—Attack 
Against 
U.S. 
Forces 
Con-
ducting NEO at Hamid Karzai International 
Airport on 26 August 2021 
(r) The SPMAGTF EOD Team, attached to 
2/1, conducted a post blast analysis at 0620 on 
27 August with U.K. Forces EOD and Taliban 
security (exhibits 5, 65). EOD concluded the 
blast was either a vest or backpack deto-
nated on the far side of the canal held above 
the waist, directly across from 1st Platoon, 
Golf Company Marines (exhibit 5). EOD de-
duced this location from the fragmentation 
pattern in the nearside canal wall, frag-
mentation in the PSYOP vehicle, and blast 
burns on the wall on the far side of the canal 
(exhibit 5). The fragmentation from the vest 
or backpack was primarily ball bearings (ex-
hibits 5, 95). Open source news reported the 
Taliban had recently freed the individual 
bomber, (TEXT REDACTED) on 15 August 
from the Parwan Detention Facility near 
Bagram Air Base (exhibit 165). The investiga-
tion found no evidence to support a conclu-
sion the bomber used U.S. identification to 
clear Taliban checkpoints on the approaches 
to the Abbey Gate canal. There were mul-
tiple avenues of approach to the canal, con-
tinuously used by Afghans to bypass Taliban 
checkpoints (exhibits 76, 102). The bomber 
likely used one of these avenues. Further, no 
Marine mentioned that any person used U.S. 
identification to move closer to their posi-
tion in relation to the attack. 
(s) There was no complex attack; it was a 
single suicide bomber not accompanied by 
enemy small arms fire. 
(i) Immediately following the blast, nearly 
all Marines and personnel reported small 
arms fire (see all exhibits with 2/1 Marines, 
24th MEU). There is wide variation of 
thought on where the firing originated and 
who was actually doing the firing. Many Ma-
rines described personnel near the canal as 
the source of outgoing small arms fire imme-
diately following the blast. Many Marines, to

include snipers in the tower, also recall fire 
from the Chevron area into the outer gate 
and from the East (see all exhibits with 2/1 
Marines, 24th MEU). Marines from Golf Com-
pany described seeing individuals on a roof 
near a water tank to their east, one with a 
camera and one with a rifle (exhibits 86, 87). 
These Marines stated they fired on the indi-
viduals after confirming they posed a threat, 
and that they suppressed the threat (exhibits 
86, 87, 88). Golf Company Marines reported 
U.K. Forces occupied the position in that 
building shortly after the attack, but (TEXT 
REDACTED) 2 PARA, stated his soldiers 
never occupied a position in that building 
(exhibits 86, 87, 88, 127, 148). Several key lead-
ers from 2/1 stated it was unlikely Marines 
received fire from the East, as Taliban mem-
bers had occupied those buildings through-
out the NEO (exhibits 53, 76, 77). The 2/1 Ma-
rines S2 stated that friendly forces occupied 
all elevated positions around Abbey Gate 
(exhibit 76). Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne 
Division provided overwatch of Abbey Gate 
from a tower 75 meters north of the outer 
gate tower. (TEXT REDACTED) was in the 
tower during and after the blast, and was 
confident small arms fire came from the vi-
cinity of the Barron Hotel and not the Chev-
ron or the East (exhibit 144). (TEXT RE-
DACTED) also had visual of one Afghan ci-
vilian on a rooftop near Abbey Gate, but this 
individual posed no threat (exhibit 144). It is 
unlikely Marines received fire from buildings 
to the East of Abbey Gate. If they did, it was 
far more likely to have originated from a 
rogue Taliban member, than it was part of a 
complex attack. 
(ii) Marines who reported hearing small 
arms fire after the blast most likely heard 
friendly warning shots. Golf Company, 2/1 
Marines specifically identified members of 
the Recon Company, 24th MEU as shooting 
from near the canal after the explosion (ex-
hibits 77, 87, 88). (TEXT REDACTED) of the 
2nd Marine Recon Company, stated during 
their interview that (TEXT REDACTED) 
fired unsuppressed warning shots (two ham-
mered pairs) at an individual who positioned 
himself to observe the Marines’ reaction to 
the blast and had been in the crowd acting 
suspiciously before the blast (exhibit 106, 184, 
237). (TEXT REDACTED) fired the rounds 
southwest, down the canal, toward the Bar-
ron Hotel. The rounds would have crossed 
the frontage of Marines, who were entering 
the canal to recover casualties and take up 
security positions, which would have con-
tributed to their perception that they were 
taking fire (106, 237). No Marines beyond the 
Recon element Staff NCOs, and those firing 
at the individuals near the water tank, de-
scribe having positive identification of any 
targets (exhibits 62, 66, 86, 87, 88, 106). This 
includes the snipers in the Abbey Gate tower 
and Soldiers in the tower to the North, who 
had the best vantage point (exhibit 62, 144). 
(iii) In addition to the Recon element fir-
ing warning shots, (TEXT REDACTED) 2 
PARA, confirmed U.K. Troops fired warning 
shots to help control the crowd in vicinity of 
the Barron Hotel (exhibits 127, 148). The 
Bravo 
Company, 
2/501 
PIR 
(TEXT 
RE-
DACTED) was in the outer corridor, south of 
the blast area, and described seeing two U.K. 
Soldiers firing their weapons at a 45-degree 
angle into the air, towards the northeast (ex-
hibit 124). These roundsalso would have 
crossed in front of Golf 2/1 Marines, contrib-
uting to their confusion about taking fire. 
(iv) Claims by the Marines to have heard or 
felt fire originating from outside Abbey Gate 
should be attributed to both the 2 PARA and 
Marine 
Recon 
personnel 
firing 
warning 
shots, and their potential for disorientation 
post blast (exhibits 76, 95, 106, 127, 148). Many 
of the Marines we interviewed were at Abbey 
Gate. The vast majority of those Marines 
were within the blast radius and suffered po-
tential TBIs or concussions from the event 
(exhibits 62, 63, 77, 88, 91, 92, 93, 95, 164). There 
was a tremendous amount of smoke, and tear 
gas canisters were ruptured and pouring 
chemicals into the blast area, further lim-
iting visibility, and responsiveness (exhibits 
63, 89, 127), Nearby observers noted the over-
whelming noise from the wounded and civil-
ian crowd fleeing the area (exhibit 148). Ma-
rines at the canal were already exhausted 
and were now experiencing sensory overload 
(exhibits 77, 127). It is unknown whom Ma-
rines engaged holding a weapon on a rooftop 
immediately following the blast, or even if 
this actually occurred. (exhibits 76, 77, 87, 
88). During the interviews, fellow Marines ex-
pressed skepticism and doubt about possible 
positive identification of targets (exhibits 87, 
88). It is worth noting the only Marines who 
reported receiving fire following the explo-
sion were junior Marines, with no prior com-
bat experience. (TEXT REDACTED) and 
other leaders concluded there was no com-
plex attack, merely the belief there was one 
(exhibits 53, 76, 77, 102, 148). 
(t) Interviews with Marines at Abbey Gate 
post-attack revealed no information sup-
porting a conclusion fratricide or civilian 
casualties resulted from reaction to the 
blast. Open source research found no report-
ing to support a conclusion warning shots or 
engagement of targets in response to the at-
tack caused additional harm to civilians. 
Marines did report stopping civilians from 
running through the gate after the attack, 
and presenting deadly force to stop civilians 
with bags from approaching or using hones, 
but no shots were fired in these instances 
(exhibited 
63). 
A 
Platoon 
(TEXT 
RE-
DACTED) from 2/1 Marines, (TEXT RE-
DACTED) stated during a group interviewed 
he witnessed a flash bang grenade detonate 
near a civilian’s head (exhibit 84). He stated 
the incident did not appear intentional and 
assumed the injury resulted in death (exhibit 
84). This incident took place during the con-
frontation at Abbey Gate on 20 August be-
tween Golf Company and unruly civilians 
who breached the gate (exhibit 84). (TEXT 
REDACTED) Surgeon at the Role II-E, re-
called treating a civilian with an eye injury 
that may have been from Abbey Gate (ex-
hibit 128). 
(u) The reaction to the blast, and the im-
mediate CASEVAC, by the 2/1 Marines, and 
adjacent Army and Marine units, were noth-
ing short of incredible. All wounded per-
sonnel were evacuated from the canal blast 
site to the inner gate CCP in 15 minutes (ex-
hibit 53). All the wounded were evacuated by 
vehicle to the Role II-E at North HKIA in 
less than one hour (exhibit 66). Marines 
flooded the blast area, worked through tear 
gas, and expeditiously moved over 30 per-
sonnel nearly 100 meters to the CCP (exhibits 
62, 63, 64, 65, 76, 77, 88, 92). Marines used riot 
control shields as makeshift litters and a 
Marine immediately cut multiple holes in 
the fence to shorten the distance from the 
blast site to the CCP (exhibits 62, 63, 88, 92). 
At the CCP, Navy corpsmen, and Marines 
with additional medical training, were as-
sessing and stabilizing the wounded rapidly 
(exhibits 63, 77, 98, 144). The situation was 
chaotic. With many leaders injured, it was 
difficult to determine if anyone was truly in 
charge, but collectively the task of triage 
and movement was successfully accom-
plished (exhibits 53, 57, 66, 76. 77, 78, 90, 98,124, 
128, 131). At least twenty vehicles rotated 
through Abbey Gate to move the wounded ei-
ther to the SPMAGTF’s STP Role I-E facil-
ity, positioned between Abbey and East 
Gates, or directly to the Role II-E at North 
HKIA (exhibits 66, 124). The STP Role I-E fa-
cility treated four urgent surgical patients, 
to include 2/1 Marine (TEXT REDACTED) 
during the MASCAL event (exhibit 66). The 
STP also treated injured Afghan civilians for 
over an hour and half after the attack (ex-
hibit 66). All wounded from Abbey Gate were 
evacuated from HKIA rearward to CONUS by 
0700 on 27 August. 
(v) After the blast and recovery of all Ma-
rines 
and 
U.S. 
personnel, 
(TEXT 
RE-
DACTED) 
Echo 
Company 
(TEXT 
RE-
DACTED) took control of the outer gate, 
closed the gate and focused on internal secu-
rity (exhibits 56, 77) (TEXT REDACTED) fo-
cused internally on his company, which sus-
tained heavy casualties (exhibit 77). The 
SPMAGTF EOD Team attached to 2/1 con-
ducted a search for secondary devices and 
sensitive items after the gate was closed (ex-
hibit 65). U.K. Forces took over security of 
the canal and outer corridor, but the blast 
dispersed the crowd considerably (exhibits 
15, 17, 18, 53, 56, 65, 77). At approximately 0200 
on 27 August, (TEXT REDACTED) Bravo 
Company, 2/501 PIR, began to transition his 
company into Abbey Gate to relieve Echo 
Company and 2/1 Marines (exhibit 124). By 
0500, Bravo Company had taken responsi-
bility for security of Abbey Gate (exhibit 
124). U.K. Forces did not complete their oper-
ations at Barron Hotel and fully retrograde 
through the inner gate of Abbey Gate until 
0700 (exhibits 124, 127). 
(w) 2/1 Marines consolidated in North HKIA 
and received the task of demilitarizing 
equipment in preparation for the JTE (exhib-
its 54, 57, 77). At approximately 1300 on 27 Au-
gust, they attended the Ramp Ceremony and 
the KIA from the blast were evacuated rear-
ward (exhibits 14, 54, 100). Before departing 
HKIA, but after completion of demilitariza-
tion, 2/1 Marines were tasked to police call 
the PAX Terminal area of trash and debris 
(exhibits 54, 56). 2/1 Marines perceived this 
order to be punishment for some of their ex-
cessive demilitarization efforts, namely de-
facing and breaking property that was not 
supposed to be broken (exhibit 56). MG 
Donahue specifically commented on the ex-
cessive destruction by 2/1 Marines, stating 
DoS and 82nd had to intervene (exhibit 125). 
He overtly noted Golf Company Marines, led 
by (TEXT REDACTED) were not involved in 
the destruction and had set the standard for 
all units operating at the gates throughout 
the NEO (exhibit 125). The 2/1 Marines de-
parted in two groups, with Fox Company (-), 
Golf Company, and Weapons Company de-
parting for Camp Buehring, Kuwait on 28 Au-
gust and 2/1 Battalion HQ with Echo Com-
pany departing on 29 August for PSAB (ex-
hibit 54). 
c. Force Protection, specifically including 
pertinent issues associated with; Force Pos-
ture. and Gate Operations. 
(1) Key Finding. The attack was not pre-
ventable at the tactical level without de-
grading the mission to maximize the number 
of evacuees. 
(2) Force Posture 
(a) Manning. Abbey Gate was operated by 
2/1 Marines throughout the NEO (exhibits 53, 
56, 77,100). On 19 August, Golf Company con-
sisted of three platoons, and was reinforced 
by two additional platoons of Fox Company, 
when they established operations at Abbey 
Gate (exhibits 77, 81). From 19–22 August, 
Golf Company was responsible for Abbey 
Gate and relieved by Echo Company on 22 
August (exhibits 56, 77). From 22–25 August, 
Echo Company, with four platoons, rein-
forced by two Weapons Company platoons, 
was responsible for Abbey Gate. At approxi-
mately 1600 on 25 August, Golf Company re-
inforced by Fox Company platoons, resumed 
responsibility of Abbey Gate (exhibits 56, 77). 
Echo Company, reinforced by Weapons Com-
pany platoons, was tasked to prepare Abbey 
Gate for closure and RIP with 1/82 IBCT (ex-
hibits 56, 57). On the afternoon of 26 August,

the size and aggressiveness of the crowd in-
creased (exhibits 53, 56, 77). (TEXT RE-
DACTED) tasked Echo Company to assume 
operation of the inner corridor to facilitate 
Golf Company’s need to allocate more pla-
toons for crowd control in the outer corridor 
(exhibits 53, 56, 77). At the time of the blast, 
approximately seven platoons were oper-
ating Abbey Gate. This consisted of three 
from Golf Company, two from Fox Company, 
and two from Echo Company (exhibits 53, 56, 
77, 81). Steady state manning was generally 
five to six platoons (exhibits 53, 56, 77). 
(b) Rest Cycle. Companies rotated between 
Abbey Gate, QRF, rest, and evacuee security 
for those waiting for processing or flights 
(exhibits 53, 56, 57, 77). While establishing the 
gate, rest cycles were initially by oppor-
tunity only, resulting in infrequent and 
short periods for Marines to sleep during 72- 
hour periods at the gate (exhibits 53, 56, 57, 
77). After gate operations normalized, the 
companies were able to establish a sustain-
able rest cycle, with one platoon rotating to 
a rest shift for six or eight hours (exhibits 53, 
56, 77, 81). Because of the tempo of oper-
ations, all units at HKIA experienced chal-
lenges establishing rest cycles (exhibits 13, 
15, 53, 57, 76). 
(c) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). 
Marines at Abbey Gate consistently main-
tained full PPE while working in the outer 
corridor and canal areas (exhibits 54, 89, 98). 
PPE included plate carrier, small arms pro-
tective inserts (SAPI), eye protection, bal-
listic helmet, and issued combat gloves (ex-
hibit 55, 89, 98). Marines could remove PPE 
during rest periods. In the inner corridor, be-
hind protective cover (exhibits 83, 89). Ma-
rines occasionally removed their helmets to 
humanize themselves and deescalate con-
frontations with civilian evacuees (exhibits 
83, 89). Marines affected by the blast were 
universally wearing their PPE, as evidenced 
by statements, autopsy results, and JTAPIC 
analysis (exhibits 77, 83, 89, 138, 145). The one 
known exception was (TEXT REDACTED) 
1st Platoon (TEXT REDACTED). At the time 
of the blast, he removed his helmet to en-
gage with a civilian evacuee at the canal 
wall (exhibit 83, 92). JTAPIC analysis dem-
onstrated helmets and SAPls were effective 
in stopping all fragmentation (exhibit 138). 
(d) Crowd Control Measures. The most ef-
fective method of crowd control was physical 
presence and interaction by Marines with 
the crowds (exhibits 56, 77, 80, 129). Profes-
sional actions, verbal commands, physical 
force, and riot control shields prevented 
crowds from breaching the gate (exhibits 56, 
77, 80, 89). Forces utilized warning shots with 
varying degrees of success at HKIA (exhibits 
53, 54, 100, 117, 118). 2/1 Marines did not use 
warning shots and only used flash bang gre-
nades infrequently (exhibits 53, 54, 77, 80, 83). 
The employment of riot control agents 
(RCAs), such as tear gas, required 0–6 ap-
proval for use in defensive situations (ex-
hibit 116, 117). 2/1 Marines employed cross 
cultural engagement and de-escalation with 
the civilian population to establish calm and 
decrease aggressiveness (exhibits 57, 77). The 
employment of PSYOP capabilities served to 
enhance the 2/1 Marines’ techniques by com-
municating threat warnings, document re-
quirements, and advisements for safety and 
temporary closures (exhibits 105, 129). 
(e) Force Protection Measures. Abbey Gate 
Corridor provided some natural force protec-
tion and required additional effort by 2/1 Ma-
rines to enhance survivability. 
(i) The canal running southwest to north-
east initially served as a natural obstacle. 
The canal was approximately three meters 
wide and two-three meters deep, and held ap-
proximately a foot of water throughout the 
NEO (exhibits 172, 176–178, 192). The wall and 
fence of Abbey Gate bordered the canal on 
the northwest, or nearside, and a wall and 
fence on the opposite side divided the area 
from private property, which created a long 
alley (exhibits 167, 172, 176–178, 192). The 
canal walls rose approximately three feet 
above the ground on each side, providing pro-
tection to Marines on one side, and creating 
an obstacle for the crowd on the other side 
(exhibits 167, 172, 173, 175, 177, 178, 192). Jersey 
barriers were located at the base of the snip-
er tower to impede the flow of civilians from 
approaching the gate on the nearside of the 
canal (exhibits 167, 172, 177, 178, 180, 182, 185, 
192). The terrain limited the crowd from 
massing and overwhelming Marine forma-
tions (exhibits 167, 172, 175–178, 192). 
(ii) 2/1 Marines made a significant improve-
ment to force protection when they em-
placed the shipping containers, known as the 
Chevron 
(exhibit 
83, 
89). 
This 
obstacle 
blocked the road leading to Abbey Gate from 
the South, reducing risk of VBIEDs and con-
trolling the in-flow of crowds (exhibits 15, 18, 
53, 77, 89). Another improvement was instal-
lation of concertina wire across the nearside 
canal wall to prevent civilians from climbing 
out of the canal (exhibits 167, 172, 176–178, 
192). Snipers continuously operated from the 
tower to provide overwatch of Marines exe-
cuting screening and to observe the crowd 
for potential risks to force (exhibit 62), The 
SPMAGTF EOD section installed two ECM 
devices at Abbey Gate to prevent the use of 
remote control detonated IEDs and inhibit 
the cell phone communications of potential 
attackers (exhibit 62, 65). When threat 
streams indicated an impending attack, 
commanders regularly stopped processing 
evacuees, pulled Marines back to cover, and 
reduced posture (exhibits 19, 77, 80, 89), Lead-
ers utilized UAVs and RAID cameras to ob-
serve avenues of approach and maintain situ-
ational awareness to employ QRF for emer-
gencies (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 54, 102, 125).

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF LEHMAN 
CAVES NATIONAL MONUMENT 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I come forward today to recognize the 
100th anniversary of Lehman Caves Na-
tional Monument, the precursor to 
Great Basin National Park. Today, 
Great Basin National Park is a 77,000- 
acre expanse known for its natural 
beauty and wonderful trails. The Leh-
man Caves Monument has been man-
aged by the National Park Service for 
more than half a century, prior to the 
creation of the larger park. Lehman 
Caves attracts tens of thousands of 
visitors each year, providing them with 
the opportunity to explore under-
ground wonders. 
The caves themselves were first used 
by Native Americans and later ‘‘redis-
covered’’ by settlers in the late 1880s 
before President Warren Harding estab-
lished Lehman Caves National Monu-
ment on January 24, 1922. This declara-
tion provided for custodians of the 
caves to make improvements, includ-
ing much-needed repairs and the cre-
ation of safer routes for tourists to ex-
plore the caves’ beauty. In the 1930s, 
President Franklin Roosevelt trans-
ferred control of Lehman Caves to the 
National Park Service, enhancing work 
to repair and rehabilitate the caves. 
The caves were then added to the larg-
er National Park legislation that offi-
cially created Great Basin National 
Park, which was passed by Congress 
and signed into law by President Ron-
ald Reagan on October 27, 1986. As a 
part of Great Basin National Park, 
Lehman 
Caves 
remains 
accessible 
today through tours led by park rang-
ers. 
Further, the quarter-mile long cav-
ern is filled with spectacular geological 
formations, including stalactites, sta-
lagmites, popcorn, and a wavy rock 
pattern of colorful flowstone, com-
monly referred to as ‘‘cave bacon.’’ The 
cavern is also home to a number of 
unique species. The Great Basin cave 
pseudoscorpion and the Lehman Caves 
millipede, for example, were first found 
in Lehman Caves and exist only in 
Great Basin National Park. From its 
geology to its ecosystem, Lehman 
Caves has provided visitors with an ex-
perience unlike any other in the world. 
The joy that outdoor recreation 
brings Nevada’s residents and visitors 
is invaluable, and the ongoing success 
of monuments and parks like Lehman 
Caves is yet another reason that we 
must work to keep our natural re-
sources healthy and available for fu-
ture generations. From Lehman Caves 
to Lake Tahoe, Nevada’s public lands 
are treasured by visitors and locals 
alike. 
I am pleased to recognize Lehman 
Caves’ 100 years of official service to 
our great State, and I wish Great Basin 
National Park staff well in continuing 
their work to preserve and enhance the 
park for many years to come. Nevadans 
are fortunate to have this precious nat-
ural wonder in our State, and we will 
continue to protect it as a part of our 
home.

TRIBUTE TO DR. STEPHEN W. 
KRESS 
∑ Mr. KING. Mr. President, today, I 
wish to recognize the outstanding ca-
reer of Dr. Stephen Kress and his con-
tributions to the restoration of seabird 
colonies in Maine and around the 
globe. For over 50 years, Dr. Kress has 
dedicated his life to preserving and re-
establishing seabird colonies that had 
previously been decimated by hunting. 
His perseverance has been a driving 
force in the repopulation of Maine 
puffin 
colonies 
and 
various 
other 
seabird species throughout the world. 
Dr. Kress’s restoration of seabird 
populations began in 1969 when he 
started with the National Audubon So-
ciety’s Hog Island Education Camp on 
the coast of Maine. It was there that he 
learned of the devastation the Atlantic 
Puffin had experienced at the hands of 
hunters. In 1973 Dr. Kress launched 
Project Puffin, a novel approach to 
translocate puffin chicks from a colony 
at Great Island, Newfoundland, to

Eastern Egg Rock in Maine. In the 
early years of Project Puffin, Dr. Kress 
hand-raised the chicks until they were 
fledglings. Under his leadership, the 
project grew to incorporate Seal Island 
National Wildlife Refuge in Maine, and 
he oversaw the translocation of over 
1,000 puffin chicks over the next decade 
to both islands. 
These efforts were an immediate suc-
cess, but attracting the fledglings back 
to the island to nest proved difficult. 
Through trial and error, Dr. Kress dis-
covered and adopted innovative prac-
tices using vocalization playback, de-
coys, and mirrors to attract the mi-
grating birds to return to the island. 
These methods are now known collec-
tively as social attraction and are em-
ployed by ornithological experts inter-
nationally. 
Dr. Kress later applied social attrac-
tion techniques to seabird restoration 
projects across the globe, leading the 
way for the successful rehabilitation of 
colonies in Hawaii, Bermuda, Japan, 
China, and Taiwan. As of 2012, 128 
seabird restoration projects had uti-
lized 
social 
attraction 
and 
chick 
translocation techniques, for the ben-
efit of nearly 50 species at locations in 
14 countries. His work transformed or-
nithological 
conservation 
and 
pre-
served numerous species of endangered 
coastal birds, redefining the possibili-
ties for seabird conservation. These 
projects are a testament to Dr. Kress’s 
commitment to conservation, the envi-
ronment, and ornithology. 
Dr. Kress’s research opened new 
doors for conservation and his con-
tributions to the scientific community 
have saved countless seabird colonies. 
As a result of his work, Maine islands 
are now home to some of the largest 
and most diverse seabird populations in 
the Gulf of Maine. His legacy will live 
on in the hundreds of people he has 
mentored during his career and the 
seabird populations our State is home 
to. I join with the people of Maine in 
commending Dr. Kress for his extraor-
dinary efforts to preserve and cultivate 
our State’s wildlife.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT 
RELATIVE 
TO 
THE 
ISSUANCE 
OF 
AN 
EXECUTIVE 
ORDER DECLARING A NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
HOSTAGE-TAKING 
AND 
THE 
WRONGFUL 
DETENTION 
OF 
UNITED STATES NATIONALS—PM 
35 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), I hereby report that I have 
issued an Executive Order declaring a 
national emergency with respect to 
hostage-taking and the wrongful deten-
tion of United States nationals. 
Hostage-taking and the wrongful de-
tention of United States nationals are 
heinous acts that undermine the rule 
of law. Terrorist organizations, crimi-
nal groups, and other malicious actors 
who take hostages for financial, polit-
ical, or other gain—as well as foreign 
states that engage in the practice of 
wrongful detention, including for polit-
ical leverage or to seek concessions 
from the United States—threaten the 
integrity of the international political 
system and the safety of United States 
nationals and other persons abroad. I 
have determined that hostage-taking 
and the wrongful detention of United 
States nationals abroad constitute an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued. 
JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr. 
THE WHITE HOUSE, July 19, 2022.

f 
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–158. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Ohio urging the United States Commission 
on International Religious Freedom to take 
whatever action is necessary to address and 
rectify the situation described in this resolu-
tion, and consider adding Canada to the Spe-
cial Watch List of countries where the gov-
ernment engages in violations of religious 
freedom; to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 194 
Whereas, The citizens of Ohio are citizens 
of the United States, which by its nature 1s 
a country of religious freedom free of gov-
ernment interference; and 
Whereas, 
Civilized 
societies 
normative 
structures show churches to have jurisdic-
tions separate from civil authorities, with 
the civil authorities having no authority in 
church governance, courts, preaching, or sac-
raments; and 
Whereas, The first line of the First Amend-
ment of the Bill of Rights states that ‘‘Con-
gress shall make no law respecting an estab-
lishment of religion, or prohibiting the free 
exercise thereof,’’ thus upholding freedom of 
religion as one of our most sacred of Rights; 
and 
Whereas, The founders themselves elabo-
rated upon and celebrated religious freedom 
in their writings; and 
Whereas, Thomas Jefferson in his letter to 
the Danbury Baptist Convention, said ‘‘Be-
lieving with you that religion is a matter 
which lies solely between Man & his God, 
that he owes account to none other for his 
faith or his worship, that the legitimate 
powers of government reach actions only, & 
not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign 
reverence that act of the whole American 
people which declared that their legislature 
should ‘‘make no law respecting an estab-
lishment of religion, or prohibiting the free 
exercise thereof,’’ thus building a wall of sep-
aration between Church & State. Adhering 
to this expression of the supreme will of the 
nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, 
I shall see with sincere satisfaction the 
progress of those sentiments which tend to 
restore to man all his natural rights, con-
vinced he has no natural right in opposition 
to his social duties’’; and 
Whereas, Roger Williams, founder of Rhode 
Island, believed that any government in-
volvement in the church would corrupt the 
church and coined the term ‘‘separation of 
church and state’’ to keep the church safe 
from government interference; and 
Whereas, The State of Ohio itself was 
founded upon similar premises from its in-
ception as a part of the Northwest Territory; 
and 
Whereas, The Northwest Ordinance stated 
in its first article, ‘‘No person, demeaning 
himself in a peaceable and orderly manner, 
shall ever be molested on account of his 
mode of worship or religious sentiments in 
the said territory’’; and 
Whereas, The Northwest Ordinance stated 
in its third article, ‘‘Religion, morality and 
knowledge, being necessary to good govern-
ment and the happiness of mankind, schools 
and the means of education shall forever be 
encouraged’’; and 
Whereas, The Ohio Constitution’s Bill of 
Rights states in Article I Section 7, ‘‘All men 
have a natural and indefeasible right to wor-
ship Almighty God according to the dictates 
of their own conscience. No person shall be 
compelled to attend, erect, or support any 
place of worship, or maintain any form of 
worship, against his consent; and no pref-
erence shall be given, by law, to any reli-
gious society; nor shall any interference 
with the rights of conscience be permitted. 
No religious test shall be required, as a qual-
ification for office, nor shall any person be 
incompetent to be a witness on account of 
his religious belief; but nothing herein shall 
be construed to dispense with oaths and af-
firmations. Religion, morality, and knowl-
edge, however, being essential to good gov-
ernment, it shall be the duty of the general 
assembly to pass suitable laws to protect 
every religious denomination in the peace-
able enjoyment of its own mode of public 
worship, and to encourage schools and the 
means of instruction’’; and 
Whereas, The citizens of Ohio have a ro-
bust system of local religious charity sys-
tems; and 
Whereas, The citizens of Ohio have stood 
against injustices throughout our history; 
and 
Whereas, During the American Civil War, 
to help rid the nation of the injustice of slav-
ery, the State of Ohio provided the United 
States government with more than two hun-
dred sixty regiments, upwards of three hun-
dred thousand men, including the prominent 
Generals McDowell, Buell, Sheridan, McClel-
lan, Sherman, and future President Ulysses 
S. Grant; and 
Whereas, 
Ohio 
abolitionists 
played 
a 
prominent role in the Underground Railroad, 
helping thousands escape the bondage of 
slavery to find freedom, such as our involve-
ment in the abolition of slavery in the 
North; and 
Whereas, We, the members of the House of 
Representatives of the 134th General Assem-
bly of the State of Ohio, are the State rep-
resentative body of such a freedom-loving 
people; and 
Whereas, During the COVID–19 emergency, 
the government of Ohio stood up for reli-
gious liberty and exempted religious services 
from COVID–19 restrictions; and 
Whereas, The State of Ohio has a vested in-
terest in the affairs of Canada, being our 
neighbor to the North and Ohio’s number one 
trading partner in the world in both imports 
and exports; and 
Whereas, Ohio’s exports to Canada benefit 
many segments of the economy, and thou-
sands of individual companies, on both sides 
of the border; and 
Whereas, Indeed Ohio is not alone in val-
uing freedom. The Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms states that ‘‘Everyone 
has the following fundamental freedoms,’’ 
which include the ‘‘freedom of conscience 
and religion.’’ The arrests and actions de-
scribed below, taken to enforce overly bur-
densome and unjustified orders, however, do 
not seem to live up to this praiseworthy 
statement; and 
Whereas, We, the members of the House of 
Representatives of the 134th General Assem-
bly of the State of Ohio, have taken note of 
the abuses of religious liberty that have gone 
on throughout the Provinces of Canada dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3375 
July 19, 2022 
Whereas, Pastor James Coates of Edmon-
ton, Alberta was jailed for thirty-five days 
and in solitary confinement for seven days 
straight for holding religious services at a 
capacity not in keeping with the Public 
Health Act; and 
Whereas, 
Brothers 
Artur 
and 
David 
Pawlowski, pastors from Alberta, Canada 
were arrested and spent three days in jail for 
organizing a church service that ignored 
COVID–19 social distancing rules and mask 
mandates; and 
Whereas, Pastor Coates, and perhaps other 
Canadian pastors, have held services in un-
disclosed locations, essentially going under-
ground, in order to avoid persecution by gov-
ernment 
authorities, 
and 
to 
allay 
congregant’s fears; and 
Whereas, 
Pastor 
Tobias 
Tissen 
of 
Steinbach, Manitoba, was arrested for hold-
ing an outdoor service that violated a health 
order that prohibited gatherings of more 
than five people; and 
Whereas, Under Province of Alberta health 
orders, in-person faith group meetings, and 
other religious gatherings, have been prohib-
ited in private homes while the emergency is 
in effect, thus intruding into the most sacred 
liberties of its citizens, those of religious 
freedom and privacy; and 
Whereas, All of the Canadian provinces 
have at times prohibited religious gatherings 
outright, or have limited the size of religious 
gatherings, and many provinces still have se-
vere size limitations on religious gatherings 
either held indoors or outdoors, punishable 
by harassment, fines, and jail time of faith 
leaders, thus limiting the parishioners’ or 
members’ ability to attend the assembly of 
their choice, and generally limiting religious 
liberty; and 
Whereas, On December 8, 2021, Canada’s 
Senate Bill C–4 received royal assent and be-
came law. This act is overly broad in scope 
and has potential negative implications for 
religious liberties and expression, including 
a prison sentence of up to five years for 
merely expressing a biblical view of mar-
riage, thus restricting the ability of religious 
leaders from expressing sincerely held reli-
gious beliefs on marriage and sexuality; and 
Whereas, In 1998, the Congress of the 
United States established the United States 
Commission on International Religious Free-
dom; and 
Whereas, The Commission includes mem-
bers appointed by the President of the 
United States, by the President Pro Tempore 
of the United States Senate, and by the 
Speaker of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives; and 
Whereas, The purpose of the Commission, 
as enumerated in federal law, in part, is to 
consider and recommend options for policies 
of the United States government with re-
spect to each foreign country the govern-
ment of which has engaged in or tolerated 
violations of religious freedom; and 
Whereas, The Commission maintains a 
Special Watch List of countries where the 
government engages in or tolerates ‘‘severe’’ 
violations of religious freedom; Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That we, the members of the 
House of Representatives of the 134th Gen-
eral Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the 
United States Commission on International 
Religious Freedom to take whatever action 
is necessary to address and rectify the situa-
tion, described in this resolution, and con-
sider adding Canada to the Special Watch 
List; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives transmit duly authenticated 
copies of this resolution to each commis-
sioner of the United States Commission on 
International Religious Freedom, the Presi-
dent of the United States, the President Pro 
Tempore of the United States Senate, the 
Speaker of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, each member of the Ohio Con-
gressional delegation, the Prime Minister of 
Canada, the Speaker of the House of Com-
mons of Canada, the Speaker of the Senate 
of Canada, and the news media of Ohio. 
POM–159. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Hawaii af-
firming Hawaii’s ongoing commitment to 
the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, 
the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals, and endorsement of the Fossil Fuel 
Non-Proliferation Treaty; to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 108 
Whereas, the scientific consensus is clear 
that human activities are primarily respon-
sible for accelerating global climate change, 
and that the climate crisis now represents 
one 4 of the preeminent threats to global civ-
ilization; and 
Whereas, the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) reported in 2018 that 
we must achieve net zero in greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions by the middle of this cen-
tury in order to have a reasonable chance of 
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Cel-
sius; and 
Whereas, the IPCC released its Sixth As-
sessment Report from Working Group II, 
which was approved by one hundred ninety- 
five member states, in February 2022, and the 
summary for policy makers notes that there 
is high confidence that ‘‘the rise in weather 
and climate extremes has led to some irre-
versible impacts as natural and human sys-
tems are pushed beyond their ability to 
adapt’’; and 
Whereas, the United Nations Secretary- 
General Antonio Guteres responded, ‘‘The 
IPCC is an atlas of human suffering . . . ac-
cording to current commitment, global emis-
sions are set to increase almost 14 percent. 
. . . It will destroy any chance of keeping 1.5 
alive . . . coal and other fossil fuels are 
choking humanity’’; and 
Whereas, 
the 
United 
Nations 
Human 
Rights Council in 2021 adopted landmark leg-
islation, Resolution 48/13, recognizing that a 
clean, healthy and sustainable environment 
is a human right; and 
Whereas, changes in Hawaii’s climate are 
already being felt, as evidenced by rising sea 
levels, coastal inundation, ocean warming as 
well as coral bleaching, heightened risk of 
wild fires, and increasing severe storms; and 
Whereas, the entire community is im-
pacted by the health and safety risks of fos-
sil fuel expansion, particularly those who 
also face socioeconomic and health inequi-
ties, including low-income families, those ex-
periencing homelessness, people of color and 
indigenous peoples, youth, seniors, those ex-
periencing mental and physical disabilities, 
and people with health conditions; and 
Whereas, youth and future generations 
have the most to lose from a lack of imme-
diate action to stop fossil fuel expansion as 
they face major and lifelong health, ecologi-
cal, social, and economic impacts from pro-
longed and cumulative effects of climate 
change, including food and water shortages, 
infectious diseases, and natural disasters; 
and 
Whereas, the Paris Climate Agreement is 
silent on coal, oil, and gas, an omission with 
respect to the supply and production of fossil 
fuels (the largest source of GHG) that needs 
to be collectively addressed by other means; 
and 
Whereas, the Glasgow Climate Pact pro-
vided for incremental improvements, only 
calling for a phase down, not a phase out, of 
coal; and 
Whereas, global governments and the fossil 
fuel industry are currently planning to 
produce about one hundred twenty percent 
more emissions by 2030 than what is needed 
to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and 
avert catastrophic climate disruption, and 
such plans risk undoing the work of the 
State to reduce GHG emissions; and 
Whereas, the fossil fuel industry is cur-
rently 
claiming 
over 
fifty 
percent 
of 
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic recovery 
funding from senior levels of government in 
the Group of Twenty, thereby siphoning 
away recovery funding badly needed by cities 
and other industries; and 
Whereas, the construction of new fossil 
fuel infrastructure and expanded reliance on 
fossil fuels expose communities to untenable 
risks to public health and safety at the local 
and global levels; and 
Whereas, the economic opportunities pre-
sented by a clean energy transition far out-
weigh the opportunities presented by an 
economy supported by expanding fossil fuel 
use and extraction; and 
Whereas, the community is committed, as 
part of the climate emergency response, to a 
just energy transition and to ambitious in-
vestments in the green infrastructure and in-
dustries that will create jobs and rapidly 
decarbonize the economy; and 
Whereas, Hawaii recognizes that it is the 
urgent responsibility and moral obligation of 
wealthy fossil fuel producers to lead efforts 
to end fossil fuel development and to manage 
the decline of existing production; and 
Whereas, a new global initiative is under-
way calling for a Fossil Fuel Non-Prolifera-
tion Treaty that would end new fossil fuel 
exploration and expansion, phase out exist-
ing production in line with the global com-
mitment to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Cel-
sius, and accelerate equitable transition 
plans; now, therefore, 
Be it Resolved by the Senate of the Thirty- 
first Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Reg-
ular Session of 2022, the House of Represent-
atives concurring, that this body affirms the 
State’s ongoing commitment to the goals of 
the Paris Climate Agreement, the United Na-
tions Sustainable Development Goals, and 
greenhouse gas reduction targets as called 
for by the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change and pledges to meet its propor-
tionate greenhouse gas reductions under the 
Paris Climate Agreement; and 
Be it further Resolved that the State and 
each county are requested to formally en-
dorse the call for a Fossil Fuel NonProlifera-
tion Treaty; and 
Be it further Resolved that the United 
States government is urged to support the 
initiative for a Fossil Fuel NonProliferation 
Treaty; and 
Be it further Resolved that certified copies 
of this Concurrent Resolution be transmitted 
to the United Nations Secretary General and 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United 
States, President Pro Tempore of the United

Whereas, the People’s Republic of China 
has illegally occupied Xinjiang since 1949; 
and 
Whereas, the communist party of China 
and the People’s Republic of China are com-
mitting genocide against Uyghurs and other 
ethnic and religious groups; and 
Whereas, the communist party of China 
and the People’s Republic of China have har-
vested organs of falun gong practitioners and 
political prisoners; and 
Whereas, the communist party of China 
and the People’s Republic of China have vio-
lated the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ policy 
which gave Hong Kong special autonomy; 
and 
Whereas, the communist party of China 
and the People’s Republic of China have vio-
lently and undemocratically clamped down 
on dissent in Hong Kong; and 
Whereas, the People’s Republic of China 
has illegally constructed artificial islands in 
the South China Sea and have laid claim to 
other countries’ sovereign territorial waters; 
and 
Whereas, the People’s Republic of China is 
increasingly becoming a threat to global de-
mocracy; and 
Whereas, the communist party of China 
and the People’s Republic of China have 
made it their goal to destabilize America 
and its allies; and 
Whereas, the Republic of China (Taiwan) is 
one of the world’s strongest democracies; 
now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives: 
That the New Hampshire house of rep-
resentatives stands with the people of Hong 
Kong and commends the Republic of China 
(Taiwan) for its strong democratic system; 
and 
That the New Hampshire house of rep-
resentatives condemns the communist party 
of the People’s Republic of China in the 
strongest possible terms and calls on the fed-
eral government to do more to curb the com-
munist party of China’s global influence, im-
pose more sanctions on the communist party 
of China, and to either eliminate the ‘‘one 
China’’ policy or to recognize the Republic of 
China (Taiwan) as the official China; and 
That the house clerk forward copies of this 
resolution to the President of the United 
States, the President of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United 
States House of Representatives, the New 
Hampshire 
congressional 
delegation, 
the 
Ambassador of the People’s Republic of 
China to the United States, and the Taipei

POM–161. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of New 
Hampshire calling for the federal govern-
ment to construct a nuclear waste repository 
to permanently store our nation’s nuclear 
waste; to the Committee on Environment 
and Public Works. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 16 
Whereas, the United States has no perma-
nent nuclear waste storage facility; and 
Whereas, spent nuclear fuel and other ra-
dioactive byproducts of nuclear power gen-
eration have nowhere to go and must remain 
on the sites of nuclear power facilities; and 
Whereas, keeping nuclear waste on-site of 
nuclear power facilities potentially increases 
the risk to safety; and 
Whereas, the state of New Hampshire has 
such a facility in Seabrook which stores nu-
clear waste on-site; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives: 
That the New Hampshire house of rep-
resentatives requests the federal government 
construct a nuclear waste repository to per-
manently store our nation’s nuclear waste; 
and 
That copies of this resolution, signed by 
the speaker of the house of representatives 
be forwarded by him to the President of the 
United States, the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and to each 
member of the New Hampshire congressional 
delegation. 
POM–162. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of New 
Hampshire supporting the principles of fed-
eralism; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 9 
Whereas, our nation was organized by the 
Constitution with a clear division of civil au-
thority between the federal government and 
the individual states; and 
Whereas, the Constitution contains several 
provisions intended to establish and preserve 
that proper balance of civil authority be-
tween the federal government and the indi-
vidual states; and 
Whereas, those provisions in the original 
Constitution include, in Article I, a Senate 
with equal suffrage for all states, equal suf-
frage for the House of Representatives when 
selecting a President, and a specific limita-
tion of federal authority with the enumer-
ated powers of Congress. In Article III there 
is a specific list of original jurisdictional au-
thorities for the Supreme Court and Congres-
sional control of appellate jurisdictional au-
thority for the Supreme Court. In Article V 
equal suffrage is required for all states when 
proposing 
and 
ratifying 
constitutional 
amendments; and 
Whereas, in the Bill of Rights certain 
rights of the people are enumerated m the 
first 8 amendments and the Ninth Amend-
ment reserves all unremunerated rights for 
the people; and 
Whereas, the Tenth Amendment clearly 
states: ‘‘The powers not delegated to the 
United States by the Constitution, nor pro-
hibited by it to the States, are reserved to 
the States respectively, or to the people;’’ 
and 
Whereas, James Madison said in Federalist 
#45 ‘‘The powers delegated [that is, enumer-
ated] by the proposed Constitution to the 
federal government are few and defined. 
Those which are to remain in the state gov-
ernments are numerous and indefinite. The 
former [federal powers) will be exercised 
principally on external objects, as war, 
peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; 
with which last the power of taxation will, 
for the most part, be connected. The powers 
reserved to the several states will extend to 
all the objects which in the ordinary course 
of affairs concern the lives, liberties, and 
properties of the people, and the internal 
order, improvement, and prosperity of the 
state;’’ and 
Whereas, James Madison warned in 1792: 
‘‘If Congress can apply money indefinitely to 
the ‘general welfare,’ and are the sole and su-
preme judges of the ‘general welfare,’ they 
may take the care of religion into their own 
hands; they may establish teachers in every 
state, county, and parish, and pay them out 
of the public treasury; they may take into 
their own hands, the education of children, 
establishing in like manner schools through-
out the Union; they may undertake the regu-
lation of all roads other than post roads. In 
short, everything, from the highest object of 
state legislation down to the most minute 
object of police would be thrown under the 
power of Congress . . .’’; and 
Whereas, in 1791 Thomas Jefferson wrote: 
‘‘I consider the foundation of the Constitu-
tion as laid on this ground that ‘all powers 
not delegated to the United States, by the 
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the 
states, are reserved to the states or to the 
people.’ To take a single step beyond the 
boundaries thus specially drawn around the 
powers of Congress is to take possession of a 
boundless field of power, no longer suscep-
tible of any definition;’’ and 
Whereas, in 1800 Thomas Jefferson wrote: 
‘‘What an augmentation [growth] of the field 
for jobbing, speculating, plundering, office- 
building, and office-hunting would be pro-
duced by an assumption of all the state pow-
ers into the hands of the [federal] govern-
ment. The true theory of our Constitution is 
surely the wisest and best: that the States 
are independent as to everything within 
themselves, and united as to everything re-
specting foreign nations;’’ and 
Whereas, Richard Henry Lee, in 1788 wrote: 
‘‘In forming a federal constitution, which ex 
vi termini, supposes state governments ex-
isting, and which is only to manage a few 
great national concerns, we often find it 
easier to enumerate particularly the powers 
to be delegated to the federal head than to 
enumerate particularly the individual rights 
to be reserved;’’ and 
Whereas, Supreme Court Justice Joseph 
Story wrote in 1833: ‘‘Let us never forget 
that our constitutions of government are 
solemn instruments, addressed to the com-
mon sense of the people and designed to fix 
and perpetuate their rights and their lib-
erties. They are not to be frittered awav to 
please the demagogues of the day. They are 
not to be violated to gratify the ambition of 
political leaders. They are to speak in the 
same voice now and forever. They are of no 
man’s private interpretation. They are or-
dained by the will of the people and can be 
changed only by the sovereign command of 
the people’’; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives: 
That the state of New Hampshire, on be-
half of all the citizens of this individual 
state, renews its commitment to all of the 
unalienable rights of its citizens and all of 
the constitutional civil authority reserved 
for the individual state of New Hampshire; 
and 
That the clerk of the New Hampshire 
house of representatives transmit a copy of 
this resolution to the President of the 
United States, the President of the United 
States Senate, and the Speaker and the 
Clerk of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives. 
POM–163. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of New 
Hampshire requesting an investigation on 
whether opioids, benzodiazepines, and expo-
sure to chemical agents contribute to sui-
cides by veterans; to the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO.8 
Whereas, in fiscal 2012, the Veterans Ad-
ministration issued benzodiazepines to 28 
percent of the 640,000 veterans seen for post 
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the 
amount of prescriptions at the Veterans Ad-
ministration for these drugs amounted to 2.4 
million in fiscal 2014; and 
Whereas, 27 percent of veterans who re-
ceived opioid analgesics from 2004–2009 also 
received benzodiazepines; and 
Whereas, benzodiazepines can be addictive 
and can possibly enhance fear following trau-
ma and suicidal thoughts, they also have 
some valid uses, such as stopping panic at-
tacks from escalating, easing sleep disorders, 
and helping agitated patients at high risk of 
harm to themselves or others; and 
Whereas, the 2015 suicide rate for female 
veterans receiving care through the Veterans 
Health Administration was 17.8 per 100,000, 
compared to 45.6 male veterans under care; 
and 
Whereas, the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs now reports that the New Hampshire

July 19, 2022 
veterans suicide rate of 33 per year was, ‘‘sig-
nificantly higher than the national suicide 
rate;’’ and 
Whereas, 20.6 armed service veterans are 
taking their own lives each day, substan-
tially higher than the national average, with 
the suicide rate for veterans aged 18–34 in-
creased substantially to 45 deaths per 100,000; 
and 
Whereas, while the Veterans Administra-
tion’s 
clinical 
practice 
guidelines 
rec-
ommend against their use in patients with 
PTSD due to ‘‘lack of efficacy data and 
growing evidence for the potential risk of 
harm,’’ physicians often prescribe them to 
patients who come to them already taking 
those medications because abruptly stopping 
them can incur serious risks; and 
Whereas, the suicide rate among veterans 
ages 18 to 27 receiving care at VA medical fa-
cilities is 79 per 100,000, and suicide rates 
among armed service veterans receiving care 
has been substantially higher than among 
those not under care; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives: 
That the New Hampshire house of rep-
resentatives respectfully urges the Congress 
of the United States, the Department of De-
fense, and the Department of Veteran Affairs 
to continue to investigate whether opioids, 
benzodiazepines, exposure to agent orange, 
insecticides, pyridostigmine bromide, and 
nerve agents including, but not limited to, 
sarin and cyclosarin, as well as vaccines ad-
ministered to military personnel such as 
Mefloquine, and constant, long term stress 
from service in the theater of operations are 
contributing to the high number of suicides 
by veteran members of the armed forces and 
whether veteran members of the armed 
forces who seek treatment for conditions 
that cause pain should receive alternative 
treatments such as chiropractic, physical 
therapy, occupational therapy, acupuncture, 
massage therapy, and/or osteopathic manipu-
lation before receiving prescriptions for 
opioids; and 
That the house clerk forward official cop-
ies of this resolution to the President of the 
United States, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent of the United States Senate, the Sec-
retary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs, and to all the members of the New 
Hampshire congressional delegation with the 
request that this resolution be officially en-
tered in the Congressional Record as a high 
priority for the Congress of the United 
States of America.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Ms. BALDWIN, and Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 4556. A bill to repeal the Defense of 
Marriage Act and ensure respect for 
State regulation of marriage, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, I am reintroducing legislation 
that would guarantee legal rights for 
millions of marriages in the United 
States. Americans should be free to 
marry the person they love, regardless 
of their sexual orientation or race, 
without fear of discrimination or fear 
that their marriages will be invali-
dated. 
Very simply, this bill makes clear 
that the Federal Government and the 
States must recognize a legal mar-
riage—as has been the law of the land 
for same-sex couples since 2015 and for 
interracial couples since 1967. 
I have long been an ally and advocate 
for the LGBT community. I spent two 
decades as a supervisor and mayor of 
San Francisco, when the city was at 
the forefront of elevating their voices 
and advancing their rights, and I 
watched firsthand as the LGBT com-
munity fought for legal recognition of 
their lives, relationships, and personal 
dignity. 
That is why I first introduced the Re-
spect for Marriage Act in 2011. The ini-
tial version of the bill would have re-
pealed the discriminatory Defense of 
Marriage Act—commonly referred to as 
DOMA—and ensured that legally mar-
ried couples, including same-sex cou-
ples, were treated equally under Fed-
eral law. 
In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in 
Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex 
couples have the right to marry under 
the U.S. Constitution. The Court recog-
nized that committed couples should be 
able to marry, regardless of their sex-
ual 
orientation—a 
belief 
that 
the 
American people have held for quite 
some time. In fact, a recent poll placed 
support for same-sex marriage at 71 
percent. 
Fifty-five years ago, in Loving v. Vir-
ginia, the Supreme Court ruled that 
‘‘the freedom to marry . . . a person of 
another race resides with the indi-
vidual, and cannot be infringed by the 
state.’’ Support for interracial mar-
riage has grown exponentially since 
then, and a 2021 Gallup poll found it 
has reached an approval rating of 94 
percent. 
Unfortunately, we may now be tak-
ing a step backward. Following the Su-
preme Court’s decision overturning the 
longstanding 
constitutional 
protec-
tions provided by Roe v. Wade, it be-
came clear that this conservative Su-
preme Court is open to revisiting many 
other established constitutional rights, 
including the right to same-sex mar-
riage and the right to interracial mar-
riage. 
Overturning Obergefell and Loving 
would be a disastrous return to a 
patchwork of State laws where couples 
could be subject to State-sanctioned 
discrimination. The legal ramifications 
would be far-reaching, from disrupting 
tax filings and benefits to calling pa-
rental rights into question—and be-
yond. 
That is why I, along with my col-
leagues in the House and the Senate, 
am reintroducing the Respect for Mar-
riage Act: to ensure that Federal law 
protects marriage equality and to en-
sure that States cannot discriminate 
against valid same-sex or interracial 
marriages. 
Inequitable 
treatment 
of 
LGBT 
Americans and discriminatory mar-
riage laws belong in our history books, 
not in our Federal code. 
I thank Senators BALDWIN and COL-
LINS for their leadership on this impor-
tant issue and urge the rest of my col-
leagues to support this bill.

tion.

‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—In the case of any 
amount treated as a payment which is made

out application of this subsection, would be 
otherwise allowable (determined without re-
gard to section 38(c)) under subsection (a) 
with respect to such property for such tax-
able year. 
‘‘(3) DENIAL

BENEFIT.—In the 
case of a taxpayer making an election under 
this subsection with respect to the credit de-
termined under subsection (a), such credit

have been allowed to the taxpayer for such 
taxable year.

of any possession of the United States with a 
mirror code tax system (as defined in section 
24(k)), this subsection shall not be treated as 
part of the income tax laws of the United 
States for purposes of determining the in-
come tax law of such possession unless such 
possession elects to have this subsection be 
so treated.

REDUCTION
AND
RECAPTURE.—

tion 38(c)).

OF CREDIT.—The credit 
allowed under this section shall not apply to

ble transaction by an applicable taxpayer be-
fore the close of the 10-year period beginning 
on the date such taxpayer placed in service

under this chapter for the taxable year in 
which such transaction occurs shall be in-
creased by 100 percent of the aggregate de-
crease in the credits allowed under section 38 
for all prior taxable years which would have 
resulted solely from reducing to zero any 
credit determined under section 46 which is 
attributable to the advanced manufacturing 
investment credit under section 48D(a) with 
respect to such property. 
‘‘(B) EXCEPTION.—Subparagraph (A) shall

onstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary 
that the applicable transaction has been 
ceased or abandoned within 45 days of a de-
termination and notice by the Secretary. 
‘‘(C) REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE.—The Sec-
retary shall issue such regulations or other 
guidance as the Secretary determines nec-
essary or appropriate to carry out the pur-
poses of this paragraph, including regula-
tions or other guidance which provide for re-
quirements for recordkeeping or information 
reporting for purposes of administering the 
requirements of this paragraph.’’.

that is a key driver of the economy of the 
United States and a critical component of 
national security; 
(2) openness to diverse perspectives and a 
focus on freedom from censorship and polit-
ical bias will continue to make educational 
and research institutions in the United 
States beacons to thousands of students 
from across the world; 
(3) increasing research and technology 
transfer investments, building regional ca-
pacity and reducing geographic disparity, 
strengthening supply chains, and increasing 
capabilities in key technology focus areas 
will enhance the competitive advantage and 
leadership of the United States in the global 
economy; 
(4) the Federal Government must utilize 
the full talent and potential of the entire Na-

centration of research and STEM education 
funding, encouraging broader participation 
of populations underrepresented in STEM, 
and collaborating with nongovernment part-
ners to ensure the leadership of the United 
States in technological innovation; and 
(5) authorization and funding for invest-
ments in research, education, technology 
transfer, intellectual property, manufac-

the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Department of Defense began devel-
oping the Arecibo Observatory located in 
Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, dur-
ing the 1950s, and its characteristic instru-
ment, a large radio telescope of 305 meters in 
diameter was completed in 1963. 
(2) The facility was later owned by the Na-
tional Science Foundation, and supported by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration and various university partners. 
(3) The Arecibo Observatory’s 305-meter 
fixed spherical radio telescope, was the 
world’s largest single-dish radio telescope 
until 
the 
Five-Hundred-Meter 
Aperture 
Spherical Radio Telescope located in Gizhou, 
China, began observing in 2016. 
(4) The 305-meter radio telescope made un-
paralleled contributions to the fields of radio 
astronomy, 
planetary, 
and 
atmospheric 
sciences, and played a role in inspiring thou-
sands of students in Puerto Rico, the Nation,

and the study of the interstellar medium, 
and played a key role in the search for extra-
terrestrial intelligence. 
(6) The Arecibo Observatory had the best 
planetary radar system in the world, used by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration for near-Earth object detection and 
was an essential part of the agency’s plan-
etary defense program. 
(7) The planetary radar at the Arecibo Ob-
servatory has contributed fundamentally 
and significantly to the knowledge of the 
solar system. 
(8) The Arecibo Observatory’s Incoherent 
Scatter Radar and supporting facilities have 
provided fundamental understanding of the 
ionosphere and upper atmosphere, and the 
interface between the atmosphere and space 
that protects the planet from solar wind, me-
teors, and other potential threats. 
(9) December 1, 2021, marks the 1-year an-
niversary of the uncontrolled collapse sus-
tained by the radio telescope after a series of 
cable failures in tower 4. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Congress— 
(1) acknowledges the loss of the Arecibo 
Observatory’s radio telescope due to its col-
lapse and its implications for the loss of a 
unique world-class multidisciplinary science 
facility which conducted research in the 
areas of space and atmospheric sciences, 
radar astronomy and planetary sciences, as-
tronomy, and astrophysics; 
(2) acknowledges that the uncontrolled col-
lapse of the 305-meter radio telescope rep-
resents a loss of astronomical observation 
capabilities, scientific research and develop-
ment, planetary defense capabilities, and ap-
plied science capabilities for the United 
States; 
(3) recognizes the rich scientific, edu-
cational, and economic benefits that the 
Arecibo Telescope has made to the people of 
Puerto Rico, the Nation, and the world;

made by the thousands of dedicated staff 
who have supported the Arecibo Observatory 
for close to 6 decades; 
(5) commends the National Science Foun-
dation for convening a virtual workshop in 
June 2021, to explore ideas for future sci-
entific and educational activities at the Are-
cibo Observatory; and

Subtitle D—Combating Sexual Harassment in 
Science 
SEC. 10531. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) According to the report issued by the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engineer-
ing, and Medicine in 2018 entitled ‘‘Sexual 
Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and 
Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine’’— 
(A) sexual harassment is pervasive in insti-
tutions of higher education; 
(B) the most common type of sexual har-
assment is gender harassment; 
(C) 58 percent of individuals in the aca-
demic workplace experience sexual harass-
ment, the second highest rate when com-
pared to the military, the private sector, and 
Federal, State, and local government; 
(D) women who are members of racial or 
ethnic minority groups are more likely to 
experience sexual harassment and to feel un-
safe at work than White women, White men, 
or men who are members of such groups; 
(E) the training for each individual who 
has a Doctor of Philosophy in the science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics 
fields is estimated to cost approximately 
$500,000; and 
(F) attrition of an individual so trained re-
sults in a loss of talent and money. 
(2) According to a 2017 University of Illi-
nois study, among astronomers and plan-
etary scientists, 18 percent of women who 
are members of racial or ethnic minority 
groups and 12 percent of White women 
skipped professional events because they did 
not feel safe attending. 
(3) Reporting procedures with respect to 
sexual harassment are inconsistent among 
Federal research agencies and have varying 
degrees of accessibility. 
(4) There is not adequate communication 
among Federal research agencies and be-
tween such agencies and recipients regarding 
reports of sexual harassment, which has re-
sulted in harassers receiving Federal funding 
after moving to a different institution. 
SEC. 10532. PURPOSE.

ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if 
there is no further business to come be-
fore the Senate, I ask that it stand ad-
journed under the previous order, fol-
lowing the remarks of Senator KLO-
BUCHAR.

f 
AMERICAN INNOVATION AND 
CHOICE ONLINE ACT 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today, as I will many times, to ad-
dress my colleagues on the topic of 
competition policy, especially in our 
digital markets where we have a situa-
tion where a few Big Tech titans have 
grown into the largest corporations our 
country has ever seen. 
Just today, there is new reporting 
that shows that Google and Amazon 
have used their gatekeeper power to 
eliminate their competition for years. I 
don’t think we are surprised by this, 
but this is new information that I 
think is important, as we learn new 
things all the time, that my colleagues 
know. 
According to a 2014 memo first ob-
tained by the House Judiciary Com-
mittee, a Google executive described— 
this is what the memo says—‘‘grave 
concerns’’ about a new service from a 
rival 
‘‘competing 
with 
their 
core 
search experience.’’ The documents 
also included an email from 2009 in 
which Amazon executives discussed 
ways to stop a company—that would be 
Diapers.com, 
a 
company 
it 
later 
bought—from advertising on their own 
platform. 
This gets to the core of what we are 
talking about here and why we must 
take action. This email that was made 
public today reads: 
We are under no obligation to allow them 
to advertise on our site. . . . I’d argue we 
should block them from buying product ads 
immediately, or at minimum price those ads 
so they truly reflect the opportunity costs. 
What does that mean? Well, Amazon 
could charge their rival whatever they 
wanted for advertisements and try and 
keep consumers in the dark about 
lower prices. That is only two from the 
dozens of documents newly released 
today by the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
I come to the floor today because the 
evidence is clear and continues to 
mount. These dominant tech platforms 
have abused their power for years, and 
now we are at a crossroads. Will Amer-
ica continue to be a place where entre-
preneurs lead our economy forward or 
will we become a country where a 
handful of monopolists get to dictate 
who gets a chance to succeed? 
Remember when they all started— 
whether they were in garages or what-
ever—they started with this idea that 
they were platforms for sharing this in-
formation. I don’t think anyone ever 
conceived they would also own things 
on the platform and then preference 
those things over other competitors. 
That is what is going on now. This is 
where consumers go to make their de-
cisions about what they are going to 
buy. 
When you have situations where 
Google has 90 percent of the search 
market, that is a monopoly, clear as 
can be. The decisions we make and the 
actions we take today will set the tra-
jectory for American innovation, for 
ingenuity, and prosperity for the next 
generation. I say we must meet the 
moment. 
As a member of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, I have had the opportunity 
to serve as chair of the committee’s 
Subcommittee on Competition Policy, 
Antitrust, and Consumer Rights. From 
my vantage point, I can tell you it has 
become painfully obvious, as many of 
my colleagues—Democrats and Repub-
licans—have seen, that we have a seri-
ous competition problem throughout 
our economy, especially in Big Tech 
but not only in Big Tech. This issue 
impacts all Americans every single 
day. 
Why are there only two dominant 
smartphone operating systems? Why do 
social media companies face so few 
consequences for playing fast and loose 
with our personal data? Why does Ama-
zon keep raising prices that consumers 
and small businesses pay? The answer 
is simple: They are monopolies. That is 
what monopolies do. They are the big 
guys on the block, and there is a lack 
of competition. 
Despite the volume of evidence that 
supports taking action, Congress has 
yet to pass a single bill on online plat-
form competition since the dawn of the 
internet. That is right. At the begin-
ning, we were told we don’t want to 
squelch these new products and com-
petition. That made sense back then, 
but it doesn’t make sense now. 
This evening, I am going to talk 
about the problems consumers and 
small businesses are experiencing in 
the online marketplace and the cost of 
inaction. It is really easy around this 
place not to act, to say things are too 
hard to deal with, whether it is climate 
change, whether it is immigration re-
form, whether it is tech policy from 
competition to privacy. But at some 
point, you have to stop blaming other 
people and do something about it. 
I am going to review how other coun-
tries are attacking this problem and 
actually taking it on. I will discuss the 
many examples throughout history 
when Congress and enforcers have 
stepped 
up 
to 
confront 
monopoly 
power. This has long been a problem in 
our country. 
You go way back to the Founding Fa-
thers. So many people actually came to 
America because they wanted to be en-
trepreneurs. They don’t want to have 
to buy all their tea from the East India 
tea company. You think about the Sen-
ators from the past taking on monopo-
lies. Whether it is the railroad trust, 
whether it is the sugar trust, they took 
on monopolies. 
There are old cartoons in this very 
Chamber, our Old Senate Chamber, 
showing these big, bloated monopoly 
trusts looking down on the Senators 
because they controlled them. We don’t 
want that to happen in our modern day 
because we know many times from the 
past, the Senate did stand up and do 
something. That is the case I am going 
to make today for why my bipartisan 
bill with Senator GRASSLEY, the Amer-
ican Innovation and Choice Online Act, 
is necessary to level the playing field 
in our digital economy. 
First, let me say a word about what 
we are up against. That is what every-
one sees. I am trying to measure my 
audience today on C–SPAN versus what 
we believe is well around $100 million 
that the Big Tech companies have pur-
chased for ads, especially in States 
where Senators are up for reelection 
where they have purchased ads all over 
the country. But people do listen. 
There are a few people here right now, 
and if I give this speech in different 
ways a number of times, I can win. 
Let’s talk about what we are up 
against. When I talk about the domi-
nant digital platforms, I am talking 
about some of the most powerful com-
panies in the world with armies of lob-
byists 
and 
lawyers—thousands 
and 
thousands of lawyers and lobbyists. I 
have two. They are sitting right here 
in the Chamber. 
We do have kind of a David and Goli-
ath situation, but the lawyers for Big 
Tech are everywhere, in every corner 
in this town, at every cocktail party, 
and all over this building. I tell my col-
leagues they don’t even know some-
times when someone is trying to influ-
ence them because they may think 
they are just talking to a friend or 
someone who worked on their cam-
paign a while ago. But once they talk 
about antitrust and Big Tech, they 
should ask the person if they are being 
paid by a tech company or if they are 
on the board of a tech company or if 
they have some affiliation with one of 
the Big Tech companies because, time 
and time again, they have been sur-
prised to find the answer is yes. 
But these Big Tech companies aren’t 
just lobbying my colleagues; they are 
also lobbying the American people with 
astroturf campaigning and other dis-
honest PR tactics. 
At the same time that I have been 
working with my colleagues in good 
faith on commonsense solutions to on-
line competition problems, these com-
panies have been telling anyone who 
will listen that acting to protect com-
petition in our digital markets will 
sometimes or somehow cede our na-
tional security or it will outlaw Ama-
zon Prime—claims that were disputed 
by the Department of Justice and Ama-
zon’s own lobbyists in the press. That 
is just two examples. We deal with this 
all the time. They will say anything 
and everything. Senator GRASSLEY and 
I came down here together to the Sen-
ate floor to refute this a few months 
ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3498 
July 19, 2022 
Then, of course, there is the money. 
I think this is actually the best evi-
dence of just how big and dominant and 
bullying these companies are, running 
ads in States where people are in tough 
races. I think they get the message. 
They are showing they are out there. 
They are showing they are going to be 
able to put whatever money it takes 
into ads to stop this bill. How obvious 
can it be? Message received: We are out 
here, and we can hurt you. 
And, by the way, they wouldn’t be 
spending millions and millions of dol-
lars to stop us if we didn’t have mo-
mentum. Let me give you some num-
bers. In 2021, Big Tech companies spent 
more than $70 million combined lob-
bying Congress. That does not include 
these ads I am talking about. In the 
first quarter of this year, Facebook, 
Meta; Amazon; Alphabet, which is 
Google; and Apple spent more than $16 
million lobbying Congress. That is in 
one quarter. And you see my two law-
yers on the other side. 
In just one recent week in May, one 
industry group, the Computer and 
Communications Industry Association, 
spent $22 million on TV ads against 
this bill. That is $22 million against 
one bill in 1 week. So when you see 
those TV ads, which they love running 
in Washington so that Members will 
see them, remember that number, $22 
million, and think ‘‘two lawyers.’’ That 
is what we are up against. 
But it doesn’t surprise me. I am not 
trying to win a popularity contest with 
the tech companies. That ship has 
sailed. I am simply trying to do the 
right thing. 
Since I am a Senator and not a tech- 
backed industry group, I don’t get to 
spread my message with a multi-
million-dollar ad campaign. I don’t 
have paid actors, but Big Tech lobby-
ists can’t stop me from standing here 
today on the floor of the Senate and 
tell you the truth. The truth is these 
companies will stop at nothing to pro-
tect their profits, even if it means sti-
fling the innovation and ingenuity that 
has made our Nation’s economy second 
to none. American prosperity was, of 
course, built on a foundation of open 
markets and fair competition. It is 
competition between companies that 
give consumers lower prices, drives 
manufacturers to constantly innovate 
and improve their products, and forces 
companies to pay fair wages to com-
pete for workers. 
Competition provides opportunities 
for entrepreneurs to start and grow 
new businesses, fueling future eco-
nomic growth. But if you look at our 
markets today, we see big cracks in 
that free market foundation. We see 
bigger businesses and fewer competi-
tors and more dominant companies 
using their market power to suppress 
their rivals and line their own pockets. 
As an example, more than two-thirds 
of U.S. industries have become more 
concentrated between—and these are 
the last figures we had, 1997 and 2012, 
because our government doesn’t really 
collect these figures because someone 
stopped them from doing it. The White 
House highlighted this problem a year 
ago in its Executive order on competi-
tion, pointing out that in over 75 per-
cent of our industries ranging from ag-
riculture to banking to healthcare, a 
smaller number of large companies 
now control more of the business than 
they did 20 years ago. 
This is raising prices overall for 
Americans. The lack of competition is 
estimated to cost the median American 
household $5,000 per year. The problem, 
of course, is most obvious in the tech 
industry because that is a relatively 
new area compared to some of our 
more embedded industries. And while, 
over time, we did things with pharma, 
we have done things in other areas, 
there is, as I noted, no law passed since 
the advent of the internet involving 
tech competition. 
Tech has given us some great prod-
ucts. I am wearing one, a Fitbit. I use 
Google Maps, order from Amazon and 
other places, carry an iPhone. Over the 
last several decades, companies like 
Google, 
Amazon, 
Apple, 
Facebook, 
Microsoft have created many great in-
novations. We went from the Wall 
Street Gordon Gekko days with his cell 
phone affectionately known as the 
Brick, that weighed 2 pounds and was 
13 inches long, to cell phones the size of 
a watch. 
But while these tech companies were 
once scrappy startups innovating to 
survive, they are now some of the larg-
est companies the world has ever 
known. And when you get that big— 
guess what—you have responsibilities, 
you have to be accountable. You aren’t 
just out there as a brandnew startup 
doing whatever you want. But that is 
the mentality. 
They are still introducing new prod-
ucts; that is great. But they are also 
gatekeepers, and they use their power 
as gatekeepers to stifle competition 
and innovation by their competitors 
and the businesses that have no choice 
but to use their services. So that is a 
problem. 
So if you want to sell something big 
time, you better get on the App Store. 
But when you get on the App Store, de-
pending on the size of your company, 
as you get bigger—let’s say you are 
Spotify—you have to pay 30 percent of 
the revenue you make on that App 
Store to Apple for the pleasure of com-
peting with their own product, Apple 
Music. 
So to my colleagues I say this: Yes, 
you can love the products; you can love 
the CEOs themselves; you can love the 
companies—but you also have to love 
competition and love and take seri-
ously the unique role that we are sup-
posed to play as Senators and as Mem-
bers of Congress to ensure there is an 
even playing field. 
You go back, way back, to the god-
father of capitalism, Adam Smith, who 
said to always watch out for the stand-
ing army of monopolies. We knew from 
the beginnings of this country that we 
would have to step in time and time 
again to make sure that we rejuvenate 
capitalism. That is what this is about. 
Throughout 
history, 
whether 
in 
telecom in the 1990s with the breakup 
of AT&T—which, by the way, made the 
company, according to one of their 
former 
presidents, 
stronger—or 
by 
passing the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in 
the 1970s, to stopping sweetheart merg-
er settlements, Congress has brought 
down prices over time by ensuring that 
there is competition. It is actually a 
uniquely American way to do things. 
I am grateful for our friends in the 
House, Chairman CICILLINE and Rank-
ing Member KEN BUCK, who led bipar-
tisan hearings on Big Tech and its 
anticompetitive conduct. They gave us 
a whole treasure trove of information. 
They conducted an 18-month investiga-
tion in the House Judiciary Com-
mittee—18-months—focused on how the 
largest and most dominant digital plat-
forms harm small businesses, quash in-
novation, raise prices, and reduce qual-
ity. 
This is, by the way, what bothers me 
when some of our colleagues say, Well, 
we don’t know enough. 
Seriously? Eighteen months of an in-
vestigation. And anyone in this room— 
it is public—can go look at it: 1,287,997 
documents and communications—this 
is on the record—testimony from 38 
witnesses, a hearing record that spans 
more than 1,800 pages, 38 submissions 
from 60 antitrust experts from across 
the political spectrum, and interviews 
with more than 240 market partici-
pants, former employees of the inves-
tigative platforms, and other individ-
uals totaling thousands of hours. 
That doesn’t even include what we 
have done in the U.S. Senate Judiciary 
Committee. So, please, spare me hear-
ing that we have not learned enough 
about this. 
The report is 450 pages, but let me 
read some excerpts that capture the 
harms to consumers and small busi-
nesses that we have seen as a result of 
our failure to update our competition 
policy. 
Here we go. This is from the record: 
To put it simply, companies that once were 
scrappy underdog startups that challenge 
the status quo have become the kinds of 
monopolies we last saw in the era of oil 
barons and railroad tycoons. Although 
these firms have delivered clear bene-
fits to society, the dominance of Ama-
zon, Apple, Facebook, [and] Google has 
come at a price. 
These firms typically run the mar-
ketplace in each of their areas. You all 
know that. Everyone in this room 
knows that because 90 percent of the 
people, when they are doing a search 
engine, they go to one that is Google. 
You know the dominance of Amazon. 
You all know the dominance of these 
companies. 
These firms are in a position that en-
able them to write one set of rules for 
others while they play by another or to 
engage in a form of their own private 
quasi-regulation that is unaccountable 
to anyone but themselves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3499 
July 19, 2022 
[T]he totality of the evidence produced 
during this investigation— 
This is from the House— 
demonstrates the pressing need for legisla-
tive action and reform. These firms have too 
much power, and that power must be reined 
in and subject to appropriate oversight and 
enforcement. Our economy and [our] democ-
racy are at stake. 
The subcommittee identified numerous in-
stances in which dominant platforms en-
gaged 
in 
preferential 
or 
discriminatory 
treatment. In some cases, the dominant plat-
form privileged its own products or services. 
In [another], a dominant platform gave pref-
erential treatment to one business partner 
over [the other]. Because the dominant plat-
form was, in most instances— 
And this is what is key— 
the only viable path to market, its discrimi-
natory treatment had the effect of picking 
winners and losers in the marketplace. 
That is us. We are supposed to pick 
the winners and the losers in the mar-
ketplace and decide what is the best 
product based on what is supposed to 
be the least priced or what is supposed 
to be the highest quality. But now they 
have inserted themselves while at the 
same time, in many instances, placing 
their own product above others, not be-
cause they are less money, not because 
they are better, but because they are 
theirs. 
Google, for example, engaged in self- 
preferencing— 
I am back to the report— 
by systematically ranking its own content 
above third-party content, even when its 
content was inferior or less relevant for 
users. Web publishers of content that Google 
demoted suffered economic losses and had no 
way of competing on the merits. Over the 
course of the investigation, numerous third 
parties also told the House subcommittee 
that self-preferencing and discriminatory 
treatment by the dominant platforms forced 
businesses to lay off employees and divert re-
sources away from developing new products 
and towards paying a dominant platform for 
advertisements or other ancillary services. 
They added that some of the harmful busi-
ness practices of the platforms discouraged 
investors from supporting their business and 
made it challenging to grow and sustain a 
business, even with highly popular products. 
Without the opportunity to compete fairly, 
businesses and entrepreneurs are dissuaded 
from investing; and, over the long term, in-
novation suffers. 
By virtue of functioning as the only 
viable path to the market—and that is 
what they are in so many instances— 
dominant platforms enjoy superior bar-
gaining power over the third parties 
that depend on their platform to access 
users and the market. 
Their bargaining leverage is a form of mar-
ket power [in] which the dominant platforms 
routinely use to protect and expand their 
dominance. 
Since 1998, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and 
Google collectively have purchased more 
than 500 companies. The antitrust agencies 
did not block a single acquisition. 
They did not block a single acquisi-
tion. And as I look back, I remember, 
just—in bright lights—that e-mail that 
was discovered during the House hear-
ing in which Mark Zuckerberg wrote, 
‘‘I would rather buy than compete.’’ 
‘‘I would rather buy than compete.’’ 
To me, that pretty much is exhibit A. 
The House report has far more infor-
mation than I could ever share in a sin-
gle speech, but I will be sharing it over 
the next few months. 
But overall, the House report found 
that if there was true competition, we 
would have a more dynamic and inno-
vative tech center with more small and 
medium-sized 
businesses. 
Maybe 
if 
Facebook hadn’t bought them—remem-
ber, ‘‘I would rather buy than com-
pete’’—an independent Instagram, an 
independent WhatsApp—because Meta 
now owns them—could have developed 
the bells and whistles and privacy con-
trols and other things. We will never 
know. 
Why will we never know? Because 
they bought them. But if you have big 
monopolies that buy up all of that po-
tential innovation, that buy up smaller 
companies, you lose the ability to get 
at some of the major challenges that 
we see in our country. 
I believe in the market. I was in the 
private sector for over a decade. I be-
lieve in capitalism, but if you don’t 
have an even playing field for competi-
tion, you have got a problem. 
Over time, if left unchecked, big 
companies dominate markets, exclude 
their rivals, and buy out their competi-
tors. 
As one of the witnesses at a hearing 
that I chaired with Ranking Member 
LEE said before our Subcommittee on 
Competition Policy, Alex Harman of 
Public Citizen put it: 
When companies face less competition, ei-
ther because of consolidation, or from forces 
that make competitive threats less likely, 
they invest less in research and develop-
ment. They in turn are less likely to produce 
new innovations [that benefit consumers and 
the economy]. And, all too often, companies 
across the economic spectrum that depend 
on these gatekeeping firms to reach the mar-
ketplace slash jobs and cut back on devel-
oping new products. 
As one founder put it: ‘‘It feels like 
we are treading water with cement 
blocks around our feet.’’ 
This is what has been going on in our 
country. It describes the problems we 
are facing from these digital gate-
keepers. We have also heard from many 
other companies, nonprofits, trade as-
sociations, about what has been hap-
pening to them as a consequence of the 
monopoly power wielded by the largest 
digital platforms. 
Consumer Reports says this: 
Multiple investigations and studies have 
found that the largest online platforms have 
too much market power, and that this is re-
sulting in harm to consumers, businesses, 
and the economy. 
A group of 60 small and medium-sized 
businesses wrote a letter saying: 
Gaining access to the dominant platforms 
and integrating with their services has in-
creasingly become a take-it-or-leave-it proc-
ess replete with anticompetitive demands. It 
doesn’t serve American consumers or small 
and medium sized businesses when the tech 
behemoths use their platform dominance to 
tilt the competitive scales. 
In January, the National Association 
of Wholesaler-Distributors wrote: 
Unchecked, Amazon’s dominance threatens 
to cripple the highly competitive B2B system 
in the United States. 
The American Hotels and Lodging 
Association, not exactly a radical 
group, wrote: 
Dominant technology companies give their 
own paid advertising products and services 
preferential treatment and placement within 
their platforms to ensure that, despite the 
specifics of what a consumer may be search-
ing for, they will likely be steered down a 
booking path that benefits the search pro-
vider. 
Not that benefits you, but benefits 
one of the biggest companies the world 
has ever known. 
From a group of 40 small and me-
dium-sized businesses back in January: 
Due to their gatekeeper status, dominant 
technology companies can: use manipulative 
design tactics to steer individuals away from 
rival services; restrict the ability of com-
petitors to interoperate on the platform; use 
non-public data to benefit the companies’ 
own services or products. 
And I could go on. 
So what do we have here? Google has 
90 percent market share in search en-
gines. Apple controls 100 percent of app 
distribution for iPhones, and Google 
controls the other app distribution, so 
they are what we call a duopoly. Three 
out of every four social media users— 
and there are 4 billion of them—are ac-
tive Facebook users. 
Amazon is expected to seize half of 
the entire e-commerce retail market 
this year. That is what is happening. 
What are we doing? Let me repeat: 
We have done nothing. We have done 
nothing. We have had hearings; we 
have thrown popcorn at CEOs. But we 
haven’t passed one bill out of the U.S. 
Congress to do anything about this 
competitive situation. 
What do other countries do? Well, 
other countries are now leaving us in 
the dust. They look to our leadership 
because 
America 
has 
always 
been 
known as a country of entrepreneurs 
and a country that encourages com-
petition, but now look what is hap-
pening. Canada introduced legislation 
in April to make the dominant digital 
platforms fairly compensate news pub-
lishers for their content, following 
Australia’s lead, which took similar ac-
tion about a year earlier. And Europe 
is moving forward with its Digital Mar-
kets Act, DMA, a broad and sweeping 
piece of legislation that will place 
many new obligations on digital gate-
keepers. The legislation puts rules of 
the road in place for how the digital 
gatekeepers 
determine 
search 
rankings, set defaults, process and use 
personal data, negotiate with business 
users on their platforms, interoperate, 
and demonstrate the efficiency of their 
digital advertising programs and the 
effectiveness of them. It also required 
gatekeepers to notify the European 
Commission about intended mergers 
and other deals that include the collec-
tion of data. 
If that sounds more intense than the 
bill Senator GRASSLEY and I have put 
together, it is more intense. But the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3500 
July 19, 2022 
point is that it has gone through the 
European Parliament. 
In the European Union, we are seeing 
the effects of efforts to rein in Big 
Tech. Just last week, Amazon made a 
settlement offer to the European Com-
mission in an attempt to resolve an 
antitrust case. The European Commis-
sion investigations into Amazon’s con-
duct were launched in 2019 and 2020 and 
involved three key issues that impli-
cate self-preferencing conduct in the 
United States too. First, the Europeans 
investigated 
whether 
Amazon 
used 
nonpublic data from sellers. Remem-
ber, the sellers have no choice if they 
really want to sell their stuff. They 
have to go on Amazon, right? So they 
have to give data to get on that plat-
form. What they found out was that 
Amazon was using the nonpublic data 
from sellers to inform its own targets 
for new product development. 
That is what monopolies do. 
The little sellers have no choice but 
to sell on the Amazon platform. Then 
Amazon says: Oh, now we are going to 
see what products are good and how 
they are doing because we uniquely 
have all the information, and then we 
are going to copy that product, either 
directly, as they did with a four-person 
luggage carrier firm where they lit-
erally ripped off every detail of the 
product—based on reporting from the 
Wall Street Journal we now know 
that—or they just know this product is 
doing well so they do one just like it, 
and then they put it at the top of the 
search 
engine. 
Amazon 
has 
sworn 
under oath in the U.S. Congress that it 
does not do that. 
Well, now let’s look at what is hap-
pening in Europe. Amazon also tightly 
controls who wins the coveted Buy 
Box, often awarding that preferred 
placement to itself. Third, Amazon re-
quires sellers who want to be Prime to 
use Amazon’s logistics services even if 
there could be a better alternative. 
We are not getting rid of Prime. We 
are just saying you have got to open 
the door so there could be alternatives. 
Amazon’s settlement offer is filled 
with elements from my bill. That is 
what is so interesting because around 
this place or if you watch the TV ads, 
you would think the world was going to 
end. If we did a modicum of things 
while investigations are going on—of 
course, we know that there are various 
investigations in the Justice Depart-
ment and around the country at the 
FTC. We are just going to sit there and 
let this continue until every appeal is 
made? 
Here is what is so interesting. In Eu-
rope, under the offer that Amazon just 
made in Europe, Amazon will stop 
using seller data to decide what private 
label products to launch, make it easi-
er for third parties to win the Buy Box, 
and allow sellers to participate in the 
Prime program without using ‘‘fulfill-
ment by Amazon’’ services to manage 
logistics like warehousing and ship-
ping. 
My bill with Senator GRASSLEY and 
what was called the ‘‘Ocean’s 11 of co-
sponsors’’ because everyone has such 
different political beliefs, but we come 
together in support of capitalism for 
this bill—this bill that we have here, 
that is what it would do. It would re-
quire Amazon to do the same things 
that I just mentioned that they put 
forward in their settlement offer in Eu-
rope. Yet Amazon has claimed, in its 
multimillion dollar ad campaign, that 
this will break Prime in the United 
States. The hypocrisy is simply stun-
ning. 
Why should consumers in Europe and 
small businesses in Europe have the 
benefit of the offer they are giving 
them, and we in the United States—we, 
who host their company—try to simply 
put the same requirements into law, 
and we are told: Oh, this is outrageous, 
when they are offering the exact same 
thing in other countries. 
The British have been working on 
these issues, too, particularly when it 
comes to app stores. And I want to 
thank 
Senators 
BLUMENTHAL
and 
BLACKBURN for their leadership in this 
area. The Competition and Markets 
Authority in the United Kingdom just 
last month issued a final report on the 
app store ecosystem, reaching the fol-
lowing conclusions. This is in the 
United Kingdom, which is, of course, a 
government that is different than the 
one we have here. 
This is from the Brits: 
Apple and Google have each captured such 
a large proportion and volume of consumers 
in the UK that their ecosystems are, for 
practical purposes, indispensable to online 
businesses. 
I think that is pretty fair to say that 
is what is going on around here. 
Let me continue with the Brits. 
Apple and Google act as gatekeepers to 
most UK consumers with mobile devices, and 
as a result can set the rules of the game for 
providers of online content and services. 
The evidence demonstrates that in the 
areas where Apple and Google generate the 
vast majority of their revenues from their 
mobile ecosystems, there is room for greater 
and more effective price competition. In the 
case of Apple’s mobile devices, both firms’ 
app stores, and Google’s search and adver-
tising services, the evidence strongly sug-
gests the prices charged are above a competi-
tive rate. . . . Consumers would get a better 
deal if Apple and Google faced more robust 
competition, either from each other or from 
third parties. 
The report continues: 
Weak competition within and between Ap-
ple’s and Google’s mobile ecosystems is 
harming consumers, and will do so to a 
greater degree . . . absent [any] interven-
tion. Most importantly, we are concerned 
that consumers will miss out on innovative 
new features or transformative new products 
and services that are held back or discour-
aged by the power that Apple and Google 
wield. 
That is one report. 
If we continue to fail to take action 
in this country, we will lose our leader-
ship position when it comes to anti-
trust on the global stage. That actu-
ally is not that great of a thing be-
cause then we are letting other coun-
tries determine what is going to hap-
pen to the future of competition. That 
is a huge risk for our country. It is 
time to take action just as Congress 
has done before when facing significant 
evidence of market failures and mas-
sive consolidation. 
So when Big Tech companies talk 
about this bill or really any serious 
antitrust effort, they try to make it 
sound like we are pushing for some 
kind of unprecedented action. And, as I 
just discussed, that is not true because 
we know they are getting all kinds of 
pushback in other countries and actu-
ally are making settlement offers that 
are exactly akin to some of the things 
we have in the bill. 
But it also isn’t true in the history of 
our own country. 
I think everyone—while people don’t 
think they have something in their 
background to do with monopolies or 
their dads or their moms or their 
grandparents had nothing to do, every-
one has got something about competi-
tive policy that affected their lives in 
the past or affected their relatives. For 
me, I think of the James J. HILL House 
in St. Paul. No, we never lived there. I 
will get to that in a minute. 
Calling it a house is actually an un-
derstatement. 
The 
36,000-square-foot 
mansion has 22 fireplaces, 13 bath-
rooms, and a 100-foot-long reception 
hall. It was constructed in 1890, which 
is the same year that Congress actu-
ally finally did something about com-
petition by passing the Sherman Act. 
The man who built this house, James 
J. Hill, was a railroad magnate whose 
railroad ran from St. Paul to Seattle. 
He 
consolidated 
multiple 
railroads 
across the country using a legal con-
cept called a trust—that is why we 
have antitrust—in which the stock-
holders of multiple competitors trans-
ferred their shares to a single set of 
trustees. There were all kinds of trusts, 
as I mentioned—rail trusts, oil trusts. 
Standard Oil Trust controlled more 
than 90 percent of the country’s refin-
ing capacity. The Sugar Trust con-
trolled 98 percent of refined sugar. And 
we had trusts in everything from sewer 
pipes to thread. 
When I was growing up, my mom 
would like to take me to see the 
Christmas lights by that house and 
other estate houses, and I remember at 
some of the houses, unlike this one, 
there were actually people in it and 
kind of ducking down. She loved to 
show me those things on my way from 
piano lessons in her red car. And she 
would remind me that in order to build 
that house, Hill needed workers. Hill 
needed the monopoly railroads that 
gave him the money to build this 
humongous mansion, and he needed 
cheap labor to do the work. 
That is where my family comes in. 
That is where the Klobuchars fit in. My 
great-grandpa and my grandpa were 
both miners in the iron ore mines in 
Northern Minnesota, and they did the 
work that supported the monopolies. 
Over time, unions came in; wages got 
better; the mines got safer. But in the 
end, that is how he built his house.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3501 
July 19, 2022 
Our Nation, as I noted, has a very, 
very rich and difficult history of deal-
ing with monopolies. But every single 
time, whether it was the East India tea 
company and throwing that tea into 
the harbor—yes, it was about taxation 
without representation, but it was also 
about a monopoly company. Every sin-
gle time we have found a way to push 
back, whether it was farmers in the 
Granger movement with their pitch-
forks taking on the cost of rail, wheth-
er it was in Chicago, the Pullman 
strikes, strikes by workers against mo-
nopolies in the beef industry. 
Finally, in 1901, Republican President 
Teddy Roosevelt rode his antimonopoly 
horse right into the White House. He fi-
nally did something about it. He used 
the first passed antitrust law, the 
Sherman Act, and was able to actually 
take on the trusts. And since then you 
have seen this rejuvenation over time. 
Sometimes, there is a lull, and then 
things get so bad—like what happened 
with AT&T—that between Democratic 
and Republican administrations, peo-
ple come in and do something about it. 
I know a little bit about this because 
my first job out of law school was rep-
resenting MCI at a law firm, and that 
is when they were fighting to get into 
the monopoly market. Finally, when 
AT&T was broken up, what happened? 
Long distance rates went way down, 
and we finally got a cell phone indus-
try because one company wasn’t con-
trolling everything because they did 
not have at that time—after a while— 
they were cool at first, and then they 
didn’t have any kind of incentive to in-
novate. Then they finally did. 
That gets us to the present where we 
have been hanging out and waiting and 
doing nothing for now decades and dec-
ades since the advent of the internet. 
And it is time to act—hence, our legis-
lation. 
January 1, 1983, is considered the offi-
cial birthday of the internet. So it has 
been 40 years since then, and we still 
have not passed, as I noted, competi-
tion legislation. That is why our group 
of Senators have come together. And 
that includes DICK
DURBIN, LINDSEY 
GRAHAM, RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, JOHN 
KENNEDY, CORY BOOKER, CYNTHIA LUM-
MIS, MAZIE
HIRONO, MARK
WARNER, 
JOSH HAWLEY, STEVE DAINES, SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE, and several more who are 
supporting the bill and said enough is 
enough. 
Our bill creates rules of the road for 
these platforms. That means, first of 
all, that they can’t abuse their gate-
keeper power by favoring their own 
products 
or 
services 
and 
disadvantaging rivals in ways that 
harm competition. In other words, in 
the examples I have used, Amazon will 
not be able to use small business’s data 
in order to copy their products and 
then compete against them. Apple 
won’t be able to stifle competition by 
blocking 
other 
companies’ 
services 
from interoperating with their plat-
forms. And Google won’t be able to bias 
their platform’s search results in favor 
of their own products and services 
without merit. That is what our bill 
does. 
Amazon should rank products based 
on price and quality, not based on their 
own profit margins. The world’s largest 
and most powerful platforms shouldn’t 
be allowed to copy a small business’s 
private data. I used the example of lug-
gage carriers. There are many, many 
more. 
Another challenge to cracking down 
on antitrust violations is how difficult 
and time consuming it can be to try 
these cases in court. Currently, the 
government has to spend millions on 
economic experts and years in the 
courts, and even after all that, the 
likelihood of victory because of very 
conservative Supreme Court cases in 
the last few decades is small. 
This bill streamlines things in this 
area. It doesn’t break up the compa-
nies. Some people would like to do 
that. That is not what this bill does. It 
doesn’t stop mergers. I think we should 
put in stronger merger guidelines, but 
that is not what this bill does. 
This bill simply gives us rules of the 
road for these companies to be fair 
going forward, while we figure out the 
other things that need to be figured 
out. 
So support for this bill: 
The Boston Globe, October 2021, said 
on their editorial page that ‘‘[i]f the 
largest platforms can’t be trusted to 
enforce even their own anticompetitive 
policies, then Washington has little 
choice but to act.’’ They noted that the 
bill I have with Senator GRASSLEY rep-
resents ‘‘a chance for Congress to turn 
concern over Big Tech’s sway into ac-
tion.’’ 
The Seattle Times, March 2022, wrote 
that ‘‘[a]s antitrust efforts ramp up in 
Congress, Big Tech is fighting back, 
unleashing an army of lobbyists, en-
listing business groups to apply pres-
sure and engaging in fearmongering to 
avoid critical legislation.’’ 
Let me tell you, a lot of our Senators 
have proved that fearmongering. 
Lawmakers must forge ahead and support 
legislation that reins in the tech giants’ 
worst impulses, ensures fair competition and 
protects consumers and small businesses. 
But no matter what the tech companies say, 
antitrust legislation will not slay these gi-
ants or kill innovation . . . that is not its 
goal. What it will do is limit Big Tech’s abil-
ity to run roughshod over competitors and 
consumers. Enough Democrats and Repub-
licans agree, but time is running out. Con-
gress needs to act. 
The Washington Post editorial, in 
April of 2022, called our bill a ‘‘sound’’ 
bill and pressed for movement on the 
legislation, including by writing as fol-
lows: 
Antitrust . . . needs revisions that prevent 
dominant companies from building barriers 
to a marketplace where those consumers will 
have both choice and protection. Legislators 
should view the bills before Congress as an 
opportunity to achieve this aim at last. 
The bill also has support from Agen-
cy experts who have enforced antitrust 
laws and worked to protect competi-
tion in the U.S. markets. 
The Department of Justice has en-
dorsed the bill. I know this is after the 
Department of Justice under the pre-
vious 
administration—under 
the 
Trump administration, with Bill Barr 
as the Attorney General and Makan 
Delrahim as the head of Antitrust—ac-
tually started the initial lawsuit—the 
major, major lawsuit—against Google 
and after the FTC, under the Trump 
administration, started the lawsuit 
against Facebook. They filed major 
lawsuits that are being continued by 
this administration. 
The Department of Justice wrote 
this: 
The Department views the rise of domi-
nant platforms as presenting a threat to 
open markets and competition, with risks 
for consumers, businesses, innovation, resil-
iency, global competitiveness, and our de-
mocracy. By controlling key arteries of the 
nation’s commerce and communications, 
such platforms can exercise outsized market 
power in our modern economy. Vesting the 
power to pick winners and losers across mar-
kets in a small number of corporations con-
travenes the foundations of our capitalist 
system, and given the increasing importance 
of these markets, the power of such plat-
forms is likely to continue to grow unless 
checked. This puts at risk the nation’s eco-
nomic progress and prosperity, ultimately 
threatening 
the 
economic 
liberty 
that 
undergirds our democracy. 
The Department of Justice contin-
ued: 
If enacted, we believe that this legislation 
has the potential to have a positive effect on 
dynamism in digital markets going forward. 
Our future global competitiveness depends 
on innovators and entrepreneurs having the 
ability to access markets free from domi-
nant incumbents that impede innovation, 
competition, resiliency, and widespread pros-
perity. 
And Commerce Secretary Raimondo 
testified before our Senate Commerce 
Committee—I was there—saying: 
I applaud your efforts and . . . clearly 
agree that we need to improve competition, 
which increases innovation. 
She said: 
Last month, the DOJ released a views let-
ter— 
That is what I just read— 
on behalf of the administration in support of 
the American Innovation and Choice Online 
Act and the [Commerce] Department and I 
. . . support . . . and concur with the aim of 
[that] legislation. 
It is not just officials currently in 
these roles who support this bill. Roger 
Alford, who served as a Deputy Assist-
ant Attorney General in the Antitrust 
Division from 2017 to 2019, wrote to us, 
saying: 
Bills such as S. 2992 provide hope that Con-
gress will restore competition to digital 
marketplaces. 
And while people may have seen the 
disingenuous ads on TV against the 
bill, I think it is worth reading por-
tions of the letters that we have re-
ceived. 
The Consumer Federation of America 
wrote: 
To maintain a healthy economy, it turns 
out we need both sensible regulation and 
antitrust enforcement. . . .

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3502 
July 19, 2022 
The American Innovation and Choice On-
line Act addresses the key issues in a sector 
of the digital economy that has not been ad-
dressed by competition policy and antitrust 
law. It targets big data platforms, which can 
abuse their market power as gatekeepers and 
vertically 
integrated 
firms, 
using 
self- 
preferencing and data to block competition. 
. . . 
Antitrust legal scholars wrote—and I 
will put all of this in the RECORD. More 
than 60 small- and medium-sized busi-
nesses wrote, and YELP, DuckDuckGo, 
Y Combinator, and other businesses 
wrote that S. 2992 will ‘‘help restore 
competition in the digital market-
place.’’ 
Small Business Rising wrote that the 
legislation ‘‘is a critical part of the so-
lution to the harms caused by the out-
sized power of the tech giants.’’ 
As the president of Hobby Works, a 
Maryland hobby shop, said recently, 
‘‘All that any small business asks for is 
a somewhat level playing field and a 
somewhat fair environment in which to 
compete.’’ 
I will end with this: Monopoly power, 
consumer choice, and reduced innova-
tion aren’t topics that came up for the 
first time when we marked up and 
passed this bill. I just read to you the 
thousands and thousands of pieces of 
documents and testimony from the 
House for 18 months that our col-
leagues Representative CICILLINE and 
Representative BUCK put together. So 
don’t tell me this is the first time, 
when that went on for 18 months and 
when we have had hearing after hear-
ing in the U.S. Senate. 
It is time to stop throwing the pop-
corn at the CEOs and actually do some-
thing. We got this bill through the Ju-
diciary Committee with a 16-to-6 vote 
just 6 months ago. Now it is time to 
bring this bill to a vote on the floor. 
We have monopoly problems. You can 
still like the products. You can like the 
companies if you want—OK—but at 
some point they have gotten so big 
that you have to put some rules of the 
road in place to ensure that we can 
have the next Google or that we can 
have another competitor to Google or 
that we can have a true competitor to 
Amazon or that we can find, finally, so-
cial media platforms that protect our 
privacy and our data and our democ-
racy. This isn’t going to happen if you 
just let four big platforms control the 
day. As long as they do, which looks 
like it will be for the well foreseeable 
future, at least let’s protect capitalism 
by putting some rules of the road in 
place. 
I yield the floor.

ACTIVE SHOOTER ALERT ACT OF 
2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the Active Shooter Alert Act: an-
other strong step to help save lives from the 
scourge of gun violence. 
As we all know, our Nation witnessed a hor-
rific mass shooting at a holiday parade in 
Highland Park, Illinois—stealing at least seven 
beautiful souls, shattering innocent families 
and forever scarring the community. 
Over the Fourth of July weekend alone, 
more than 220 Americans were tragically shot 
and killed—the latest surge of shootings in a 
year that has already seen more than 20,000 
heartbreaking gun deaths. 
Sadly, this epidemic has reached a fever 
pitch, with: 
Countless mass shootings, from Uvalde to 
Buffalo and many more; and 
The daily massacre of gun crime, which 
rarely makes the evening news. 
These shootings often unfold in the heart of 
our communities: in our schools and on our 
streets; at our malls and in our movie theaters. 
But in active shooter situations, there’s cur-
rently no efficient, effective way for law en-
forcement to warn the public—putting more 
lives at risk. 
That is why, today, the House will pass 
strong, bipartisan legislation to quickly warn 
communities when a gunman opens fire. 
Our Active Shooter Alert Act will help set up 
a system similar to AMBER Alerts—helping 
state and local law enforcement agencies to 
notify those in the area of an active shooter 
threat. 
Let us salute an unyielding champion in the 
fight against gun violence, Congressman 
DAVID CICILLINE, for crafting this commonsense 
and lifesaving measure. 
Importantly, this bill has the support of many 
major law enforcement organizations. They 
know firsthand the challenges of keeping fami-
lies safe in an active shooter scenario—and 
they are calling for this legislation. 
When we brought this legislation to the 
Floor three weeks ago, it was overwhelmingly 
opposed by House Republicans. 
Their opposition to this legislation is uncon-
scionable and inexplicable. 
Why would anyone vote against keeping 
communities better informed of potential dan-
ger? 
Why would anyone vote against ensuring in-
nocent children do not accidentally walk into 
the line of fire? 
Why would anyone vote against the re-
sponding to the needs of our law enforcement 
heroes? 
Nevertheless, today—with or without Repub-
lican support—our House Democratic Majority 
will proudly pass this life-saving legislation. 
This legislation builds on Democrats’ deter-
mined leadership to end the gun violence cri-
sis. 
On Monday, many of us gathered at the 
White House to celebrate the enactment of the 
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act: the most 
significant gun violence prevention legislation 
in three decades. 
While more is needed, this bill will take 
steps to save lives: 
Encouraging states to establish Extreme 
Risk Protection Order laws; 
Combating illegal straw purchases; 
Moving to close the boyfriend loophole; and 
Expanding background checks for buyers 
under 21; and more. 
Meanwhile, our Majority has twice passed 
the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and the 
Enhanced Background Checks Act, to secure 
universal background checks on all gun pur-
chases. 
And last month, we passed our Protecting 
Our Kids Act to: 
Raise the age to 21 years old to buy weap-
ons of war; 
Ban high-capacity magazines designed for 
mass murder; and 
Ensure safe storage to protect our children 
from tragic accidents and take additional steps 
to save lives. 
Madam Speaker, our fight to prevent gun vi-
olence is of, by and for the children. 
Of the children, because they are suffering. 
It is heartbreaking that, in America, more chil-
dren die from guns than any other cause. 
By the children, because they are leading. 
We see them marching in the streets, testi-
fying before the Congress, demanding action. 
And always For The Children: building a fu-
ture where every child can reach his or her 
fulfillment, free from the fear of gun violence. 
Protecting our children must be a unifying 
mission in the Congress—as it is a unifying 
issue for the American people. 
Nowhere will we find more agreement than 
this commonsense measure to help keep in-
nocent families out of the line of fire. 
And we strengthened in this fight by the 
courage and commitment of President Biden: 
author of the Brady law in 1994, champion of 
the assault weapons ban and a long-time 
leader on this important issue. 
With that, I urge a strong, bipartisan ‘‘aye’’ 
vote for this life-saving legislation.

RECOGNIZING SERVICIOS DE LA 
RAZA 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize ‘‘Servicios de la Raza’’ for 
receiving the Ohtli Award granted by the Gov-
ernment of Mexico for dedicating their work to 
making our community a better place, while 
promoting the beauties of Mexican American 
culture. 
Servicios de la Raza has served our com-
munity for over five decades—making it their 
mission to dismantle the cycle of poverty by 
placing an emphasis on empowering low- and 
moderate-income people and communities of 
color. Their work includes counseling, job- 
training, and other culturally responsive, es-
sential human services meant to foster suc-
cess in our community. 
As we have seen time and time again, the 
Latinx community is an incredibly important 
part of the fabric of both our district and our 
Nation. It is because of them that our commu-
nity has found incredible strength in diversity, 
and I congratulate Servicios de la Raza on re-
ceiving this much deserved award.

REMEMBERING REVEREND HUEY 
PRICE LAWSON 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the passing of Rev. 
Huey Price Lawson after 87 years of serving 
his country and community. 
Reverend Huey Price Lawson was born 
February 26, 1935, in Loyd Bridge, Louisiana 
to Reverend Joseph Solomon Lawson, Sr. and 
Eula Henton Lawson. The family relocated to 
Alexandria, Louisiana in 1941 where he re-
sided until entering eternal rest on Friday, July 
8, 2022, at his home surrounded by his loving 
family. 
Reverend Lawson attended Rapides Parish 
public schools and is a 1953 graduate of Pea-
body High School. After graduating high 
school, he enrolled at Grambling College (now 
Grambling State University) in the Fall of that 
year. While in school, he served as a cook for 
Jeansonne Grocery and Catering in Alexan-
dria, Louisiana. In 1957, he earned a Bachelor 
of Science Degree in Elementary Education. 
Upon graduation, he gained employment as a 
teacher in the Rapides Parish School District. 
For 21 years, he provided positive classroom 
instruction at J.B. LaFargue, Lincoln Williams, 
Silver City, and Aiken Elementary Schools, in-
cluding stints as Title I Coordinator, Boy Scout 
Troop Leader, 4–H Leader, and Basketball 
Coach. In 1958, he was drafted by the U.S. 
Army. Upon returning from service, he went 
back to the classroom and served as a Teach-
er where he was promoted to Center Director 
for PACE’s (Central Louisiana Headstart Sum-
mer Program). 
He was an entrepreneur at heart. Through-
out his career as an educator, he also ex-
plored several part-time marketing and sales 
opportunities to provide many extras for his 
family, friends, and students. This included 
selling everything from wigs, stainless steel 
pots and pans (Franchise Holder, Manager, 
and Salesperson for Flavorite Stainless Steel, 
Inc. (1963–1967), World Book Encyclopedias 
(Area Manager and Teacher, 1967–1970),

HONORING NORMAN MINETA 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Secretary Norman Mineta, 
who passed away on May 3, 2022, at the age 
of 90. Norm was a pioneer of Asian American 
representation in politics and was an exem-
plary patriot. 
Norm was born in San Jose, California on 
November 12, 1931, to Japanese immigrant 
parents. In 1942, when he was just ten years 
old, Norm and his family were forcibly relo-
cated from California to Heart Mountain War 
Relocation Center in Wyoming, where they 
were imprisoned at a Japanese internment 
camp during World War II. After 18 months of 
incarceration, Norm and his family moved to 
the Chicago area, where his father, an insur-
ance agent, volunteered to teach Japanese 
language courses to soldiers in the U.S. Army. 
Only when Norm was a teenager were he and 
his family finally able to return to San Jose. 
After graduating from the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley in 1953 with a degree in 
business administration, Norm served as an 
intelligence officer for the Army for three years 
and later took over his father’s Mineta Insur-
ance Agency. After serving on the San Jose 
Human Relations Commission, Norm was 
asked by San Jose’s then-mayor to fill a city 
council vacancy in 1967. Following four suc-
cessful years as a city councilmember, Norm 
was elected to be San Jose’s mayor, making 
him the first Asian American to serve as 
mayor of a major American city. 
With a staunch belief that local officials 
should have more authority over how federal 
funding is used to improve roads and railways, 
Norm decided to run for Congress, promising 
to address these very issues. And he did just 
that. Elected to the U.S. House of Representa-
tives in 1974, Norm went on to serve for ten 
terms from 1975 to 1995. 
In Congress, Norm successfully fought to 
strengthen civil rights for the Asian American 
and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. He 
spearheaded efforts to pass the Civil Liberties 
Act of 1988, which granted reparations to Jap-
anese Americans incarcerated during WWII or 
their surviving family members. In 1994, he 
co-founded the Congressional Asian Pacific 
American Caucus to ensure that AAPIs have 
a voice in Congress and served as the Cau-
cus’ first chair. Seeing the need to increase 
the AAPI public service pipeline in Wash-
ington, D.C., Norm also founded the Asian Pa-
cific American Institute for Congressional 
Studies (APAICS) in 1994. Since then, 
APAICS has played a critical role in cultivating 
future AAPI leaders through internships and 
fellowships, and many alumni have gone on to 
such remarkable positions, including within the 
White House and Capitol Hill. 
Following his Congressional tenure, Norm 
was appointed to serve as Secretary of Com-
merce for the last six months of President Bill 
Clinton’s term, making him the first Asian 
American member of a Presidential Cabinet. 
Then, under President George W. Bush, Norm 
became the first Cabinet Secretary to switch 
directly from a Democratic to Republican ad-
ministration, where he served as Secretary of 
Transportation. Notably, he was also the only 
Democrat to serve in President Bush’s cabi-
net, displaying his talents in bipartisan efforts. 
As Secretary of Transportation, Norm fought 
for investments in roads and bridges nation-
wide, and secured billions of dollars in federal 
funding for highways. 
Norm’s time as Secretary of Transportation 
was defined by the terrorist attack on Sep-
tember 11, 2001. When the second plane 
struck the World Trade Center, Norm was 
moved to a secret bunker under the White 
House alongside Vice President Dick Cheney. 
It was here that Norm made the historic call to 
ground nearly 5,000 planes in U.S. airspace, 
an unprecedented decision for which protocols 
had never been established. Following the at-
tacks, Norm regularly worked 100-hour weeks 
to bolster security at seaports, airports, rail-
ways and facilities with oil and gas lines. Fur-
thermore, he spearheaded the effort to estab-
lish a new federal agency, the Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA), to successfully 
increase security at airports and avoid future 
attacks. In a time when Islamophobia was 
sharply exacerbated, Norm routinely drew par-
allels between his experience with Japanese 
American incarceration and scapegoating of 
Muslim Americans. 
For his extraordinary accomplishments, the 
San Jose airport was renamed in 2001 to the 
Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Air-
port. Additionally, Norm was awarded the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country’s 
highest civilian honor, by President George W. 
Bush in 2006. Norm is survived by his wife, 
Deni, his sons David, Stuart, Robert and Mark, 
and 11 grandchildren. He was truly a trail-
blazer and defined what it means to be a pub-
lic servant, paving the way for generations of 
Asian American elected officials, like myself, 
to come. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
commemorating this extraordinary individual.

RECOGNIZING JUNE AS NATIONAL 
FAMILY REUNIFICATION MONTH 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize June as National Reunifica-
tion Month, and to honor the tremendous re-
unifications efforts of individuals across the 
country who work tirelessly to ensure that 
safe, timely, and healthy reunification con-
tinues to be prioritized for the 400,000 youth 
in the U.S. foster care system. Each June, 
states and jurisdictions celebrate these efforts 
and extend their commitments to working to 
strengthen pathways to ensuring thriving, sup-
portive families, and communities. 
Federal initiatives including Preventing Sex 
Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, the 
Family First Prevention Services Act, Victims 
of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization of 2018 
and the Supporting Foster Youth and Families 
through the Pandemic Act, have improved 
services and reunification for children and 
families in the foster care system, but there is 
more to be done. 
Since 2020, four National partners of the 
U.S. Children’s Bureau, Annie E. Casey Foun-
dation, Prevent Child Abuse America, Casey 
Family Programs and now recently the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention have 
joined the Thriving Families, Safer Children 
Movement within the child welfare community 
to bring a first-of-its-kind national, multiyear ef-
fort that spans the public, private and philan-
thropic sectors. It will create and enhance net-
works of community-based programming while 
also aligning government resources to offer a 
full continuum of prevention supports and 
services. Beyond building stronger families 
and communities, the movement seeks to end 
the harmful practice of family separation in 
child welfare systems. This work involves 
closely collaborating with children and families 
within the child welfare system and leveraging 
resources to create a more just, equitable, and 
humane well-being system. Twenty-two states 
and jurisdictions have committed to moving 
this work forward, including Arizona. 
With that in mind, I want to thank all those 
involved for making this much-needed invest-
ment into our youth and families’ futures in-
cluding: biological and kinship parents, family 
members, social workers, foster parents, serv-
ice providers, attorneys, courts, court ap-
pointed special advocates (CASAs), advo-
cates, public child welfare professionals and 
the greater child welfare community at large. 
And when honoring National Reunification 
Month, we must push to further assist migrant 
families that were separated at our southern 
border due to cruel and inhumane border poli-
cies denying them their right to seek asylum. 
I commend the Biden-Harris administration for 
fully repealing the Trump-era ‘‘zero tolerance’’ 
policy and establishing the President’s Inter-
agency Task Force on the Reunification of 
Families aimed at bringing families back to-
gether. Thousands of children were cruelly 
separated from their families, and I applaud 
the work of the President’s Taskforce who is 
working to reunite hundreds of children that 
remain separated from their families to this 
day. More must be done to ensure all migrant 
families are reunited and no more families are

our domestic foster care system and for those 
who entered our country for refuge.

OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today along with Representative JASON CROW 
to recognize Vicky Lea for her contributions to 
the Denver Metro region and State of Colo-
rado as Director of Aerospace and Aviation for 
the Metro Denver Economic Development 
Corporation. 
For more than a decade, Vicky has worked 
to bolster Colorado’s aerospace and aviation 
industries by building partnerships among in-
dustry professionals, organizing education ef-
forts, and implementing strategic recruitment 
initiatives. Vicky’s relentless advocacy on be-
half of Colorado’s aerospace community has 
been instrumental in establishing Colorado as 
the number one state in the nation for aero-
space jobs per capita. 
In this role, Vicky’s passion and hard work 
have also been essential to Colorado’s overall 
economic growth. Vicky’s tenure with the 
Metro Denver Economic Development Cor-
poration has directly correlated with increasing 
opportunities for innovation and growth for 
small and large aerospace businesses across 
the state that provide tens of thousands of 
high-paying jobs for Coloradans. 
Congratulations again to Vicky Lea on her 
noteworthy career and contributions during her 
time at the Metro Denver Economic Develop-
ment Corporation. We are thankful for her 
service and commitment to the great State of 
Colorado and wish her all the best as she 
moves to the next stage of her career.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BICYCLES 
FOR 
RURAL 
AFRICAN 
TRANS-
PORT ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Bicycles for Rural African 
Transport Act. Transportation access in the 
developing world is limited. In sub-Saharan Af-
rica, more than seventy percent of people rely 
on walking as their primary mode of transpor-
tation. For these individuals access to a bicy-
cle is revolutionary. 
Bicycles can be impactful tools for effective 
foreign aid and international economic devel-
opment. 
Low-cost, high-impact investments in bicy-
cles will allow us to use existing foreign aid 
more effectively. Many developing-world rural 
populations suffer from time poverty, which 
limits 
opportunities 
to 
access 
education, 
healthcare, employment and job training op-
portunities, and markets. By reducing time 
poverty, bicycle access significantly improves 
school attendance for rural girls. In one trial, 
girls with bicycles were 19 percent less likely 
to drop out of school. 
In recent years, USAID has conducted a 
small rural mobility program to study the bicy-
cle’s development impacts. In Tanzania in 
2019, USAID donated 2,160 bicycles to health 
care workers as part of AIDS treatment efforts, 
allowing the workers to reach more patients 
and reducing AIDS transmission in the area. 
In Malawi in 2020, USAID established a re-
volving loan fund to finance bicycles for work-
ers on a sugar cane cooperative, reducing 
their commute times and increasing produc-
tivity. 
USAID’s work on this program has clearly 
demonstrated the value of bicycles for rural 
transportation in developing nations. This leg-
islation authorizes a permanent rural mobility 
program at USAID which will promote rural, 
sub-Saharan communities’ access to services 
and opportunities through affordable, fit-for- 
purpose bicycles. This more systematic ap-
proach will allow USAID to maximize the po-
tential impact of bicycle projects and ensure 
the United States continues utilizing this sim-
ple, revolutionary development tool.

SUPPORT FOR FINLAND AND 
SWEDEN TO JOIN NATO 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in solidarity with the democratic nations of Fin-
land and Sweden in their bid to join the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
For more than seven decades, NATO has 
served as an Allied bulwark of free nations in 
defense of Liberty against those seeking to re-
ignite the brutal horrors of the 20th century’s 
world wars. Powerful nations cannot willfully 
invade sovereign territories of other nations at 
will. 
With Putin now choosing murder and vio-
lence in an attempt to resurrect the fallen 
pride of the former Soviet Union, it is essential 
for free nations to band together for the pres-
ervation and fortification of Liberty on the con-
tinent of Europe. 
Russia has unambiguously demonstrated its 
outlaw status on the world stage. The only de-
fense to further escalation is strong Alliance 
between nations devoted to upholding the rule 
of law. Finland and Sweden did not choose 
this path—Putin and his warmongers forced 
their hands. 
The survival of global freedom is very much 
on the line. The time to admit Sweden and 
Finland into this sacred Alliance has arrived, 
NATO’s member nations must do so without 
delay.

MR. 
RUSTON 
HENRY 
AND MR. TROY HENRY ON THE 
UNVEILING OF THE HENRY TRIB-
UTE 
MURAL 
CELEBRATING 
BLACK EXCELLENCE 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate two of my dear friends 
and constituents, Mr. Ruston Henry, Sr., RPh 
and Mr. Troy Henry, on the occasion of a 
Mural Unveiling Celebrating Black Excellence. 
This mural recognizes the accomplishments of 
two of New Orleans’ native sons located at 
1667 Tchoupitoulas Street near New Orleans’ 
port access road along the Mississippi River, 
‘‘Clarence Henry Truckway’’, coincidentally 
named after their grandfather, the late Clar-
ence ‘‘Chink’’ Henry, Sr., a legendary labor 
leader and civil rights activist, also known as 
a Louisiana AFL–CIO Labor Hall of Fame 
Honoree. 
They are the proud sons of Mrs. Elvira Day 
Henry and the late Mr. Sterling Henry, Sr., a 
pioneer black pharmacist, responsible for inte-
grating the workforce of the historic Treme’s 
Circle Food Store, a key local business lo-
cated in New Orleans’ Seventh Ward, men-
toring, and providing internships to many Xa-
vier University of Louisiana pharmacy students 
beginning in the early 1960’s. Their parents in-
stilled in their children the importance of sup-
porting underprivileged families, and helping 
ensure no one in need was left behind. 
Mr. Ruston Henry, Sr., RPh, a 1985 grad-
uate of Xavier University’s College of Phar-
macy, following his parents through their alma 
mater, is a highly qualified pharmacist with 
more than 32 years of pharmacy experience in 
the management, administration, construction 
and operation of retail pharmacies. Mr. Henry 
is a Licensed Pharmacist in Louisiana and 
Mississippi who excels at teamwork, conflict 
resolution and sound decision-making under 
pressure. A second-generation pharmacist, he 
is the current owner and operator of H & W 
Drug Store, Inc. This store was co-founded by 
his late father in three retail locations, New Or-
leans East, the Westbank of Jefferson Parish, 
and inside the historic Treme’ Circle Food 
Store. In 1999, Mr. Sterling J. Henry, Sr. re-
tired and his son, Mr. Ruston Henry, Sr. took 
over the business, and now serves as the cur-
rent owner and Chief Pharmacist. 
In 2017, Mr. Ruston Henry began pursuing 
alternative treatments involving medical can-
nabis. In 2018, the Louisiana Board of Phar-
macy (LBP) selected the H & W Drug Store, 
Inc. to operate the first Medical Marijuana 
Pharmacy in the Metropolitan Region of Lou-
isiana. H & W’s services Orleans, Jefferson, 
St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes. H & W 
Drug Store Dispensary opened in August of 
2019 and is currently located at 1667 
Tchoupitoulas Street. H & W’s primary focus 
was and always is to provide our patients with 
the best pharmaceutical healthcare available. 
Mr. Troy Henry, graduate of Stanford Uni-
versity, then Carnegie Mellon University, is the 
Managing Partner and principal fiduciary of 
Henry Consulting (HC). He is responsible for 
all 3 lines of business of HC: management 
consulting services, business services and eq-
uity ventures. Troy has over 30 years of man-
agement experience, with concentrations in

ernment. He has expertise in managing multi- 
million-dollar projects and leading teams that 
develop business strategies, implement solu-
tions, and solve problems. 
Mr. Troy Henry’s responsibilities with HC in-
clude providing general management and 
oversight on numerous HC projects and ven-
tures throughout the country. In addition to ap-
plying his business acumen to these client 
specific engagements, Henry is Managing 
Member for several HC owned equity ven-
tures: Infinity Fuels—a wholesale and com-
mercial fuel supply company, Infinity Petro-
leum—a retail fuel and store management 
company, Pneuma Aviation—a private mem-
ber-driven aviation company, Equity Media—a 
New Orleans-based media services company, 
and Bayou Phoenix—a commercial real estate 
development partnership. Through Henry’s 
leadership, HC continues to be one of the 
fastest growing enterprises in the southern re-
gion. 
Previously, as President of the United Water 
Corporation, Mr. Troy Henry had responsibility 
for overseeing operations and management of 
United Water’s regulated and unregulated 
water and wastewater businesses, customer 
satisfaction, client relations and marketing ac-
tivities in nineteen states. Henry has also 
served in executive positions with IBM, Enron,

Commerce, the Eastover Property Owners As-
sociation (EPOA), the East New Orleans 
Neighborhood Advisory Commission, the Dis-
trict 100 Community Development Corpora-
tion, and the Shell Regional Wholesale Coun-
cil. Henry served as Chairman of Mayor 
LaToya Cantrell’s Infrastructure Transition 
Team, and as Chairman of the Board of St. 
Augustine High School for over 12 years, 
which included oversight of the high school re-
construction effort following Hurricane Katrina. 
Henry is the founder of the leading business 
organization for East New Orleans, known as 
the East New Orleans Business Development 
District (ENOBDD) which produces ‘‘The East 
Magazine.’’ 
Congratulations to both Ruston and Troy 
Henry on continuing the legacy of their grand-
parents and parents, who are all so proud of 
them. New Orleans is blessed to have these 
native home-grown sons in our lives. May this 
mural remain forever as a mark to continue 
the Henry Family Legacy.

TRIBUTE TO DAVID BROWN 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker,I rise today to 
recognize David G. Brown, who is retiring from 
the Greater Omaha Chamber after 19 years of 
public service. David came to Omaha in 2003 
after an already accomplished career, leading 
economic development organizations in the 
Midwest and South Carolina. Since coming to 
Omaha, he has overseen a period of extraor-
dinary growth and prosperity within the busi-
ness community that is nothing short of re-
markable. 
Over the course of his career, as CEO of 
the Greater Omaha Chamber, the metro re-
gion has seen an 88 percent increase in aver-
age Gross Domestic Product. Since launching 
the Greater Omaha Economic Development 
Partnership, the Chamber has brokered 920 
projects, which encompasses 47,000 jobs and 
$12 Billion in capital investments. For his ef-
forts, the Omaha Chamber was deemed the 
Chamber of the Year in 2015 by the Associa-
tion of Chamber of Commerce Executives. 
David began his career at Dartmouth, where 
he majored in geography and minored in envi-
ronmental studies. While there, he won the 
1978 Ivy League football championship, and 
was awarded the Earl Hamilton Award for 
friendliness and humor. While he recognizes 
Chambers as mechanisms for economic 
growth, he sees his role as that of a catalyst 
for growth within the community. David has 
continuously given back by volunteering at 
local service organizations such as the 
Aksarben Future Trust, the Boy Scouts of 
America, the Greater Omaha Alliance for Busi-
ness Ethics, and Opera Omaha. 
David’s tenure truly has embodied the motto 
of the Omaha Chamber: ‘‘We Don’t Coast’’— 
David never let down his steam as he strived 
to bring the business community and the com-
munity at large to a place where people can 
prosper, and we can be very proud. 
After retiring, he plans to spend more time 
with his family, including his wife Maggie, of 
39 years, and their two sons Gregory and Eli-
jah, but there is no doubt that he will continue 
to contribute his time and services to Greater 
Omaha and all of Nebraska. 
I thank David for his service and contribu-
tions. It certainly does not go unnoticed, and 
the entire Greater Omaha Community is deep-
ly in his debt.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF 
SYLVAN GLEN 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 100th anniversary of 
Sylvan Glen Golf Course, a popular attraction 
for both locals and tourists in Troy, Michigan. 
Over the past century, Sylvan Glen solidified 
itself as a popular destination to make memo-
ries and connect with others over a game of 
golf or by participating in one its many events 
and activities. People of all generations come 
together to enjoy the beautiful greenery of Syl-
van Glen, and I am proud to represent the dis-
trict that encompasses this local landmark as 
the member of Congress for Michigan’s 11th 
District. 
Opened in 1922, Sylvan Glen predates the 
designation of the City of Troy, offering unique 
insight into the earlier, natural state of the re-
gion. Just minutes from Detroit, Sylvan Glen 
serves as a reprieve for those looking to es-
cape the city and spend time among the trees 
and wildlife over a game of golf. In addition, 
the course offers excellent cross-country ski-
ing and sledding opportunities, bringing to-
gether members of the community from all 
backgrounds and interests to take advantage 
of Michigan outdoors. 
Madam Speaker, over the past 100 years, 
Sylvan Glen Golf Course has established itself 
as an essential fixture of the community. Many 
have come together to enjoy this local wonder, 
undoubtedly securing a special place in the 
hearts of thousands of residents in Michigan’s 
11th District and greater Southeast Michigan. 
Please join me in honoring Sylvan Glen Golf 
Course upon its 100th year and in wishing 
Sylvan Glen continued success for many more 
years to come.

RECOGNIZING ISABELLA 
MARGOLIN 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
today to recognize Isabella Margolin, who 
earned the Congressional Award—the highest 
honor a youth civilian can receive from their 
Member of Congress. 
In 2020, Isabella completed over 100 hours 
of community service and set personal goals 
to hone her interests in photography and 
physical fitness. Isabella’s leadership and ini-
tiative is exemplified in her hard work to not 
only better herself and those around her, but 
to make a sizable and lasting impact in her 
community. 
It’s young folks like her that remind me of 
the unlimited promise of future generations 
and give me hope that inspiring young leaders 
like Isabella will one-day take the torch and 
solve many of our nation’s most pressing chal-
lenges. 
I am more than proud to congratulate Isa-
bella on earning the bronze Congressional 
Award and look forward to seeing what incred-
ible things she does next.

HONORING PRISCILLA PRESLEY 
HON. STEVE COHEN

Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to my friend Priscilla Presley 
who will be honored Friday night in Memphis 
with a musical extravaganza at Theatre Mem-
phis. 
It’s an honor to take a moment to discuss 
the work I have done with Priscilla, particularly 
in the area of the humane treatment of Ten-
nessee Walking Horses. Like me, she has 
long advocated the end of the practice of 
‘‘soring’’ horses to give them the exaggerated 
walking gait known as ‘‘the Big Lick.’’ 
My Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act 
made it through the markup in the Energy and 
Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Pro-
tection and Commerce last month, and is now 
pending before the full committee.

In my press release on that development, I 
noted that Priscilla has been a consistent and 
dedicated advocate of this reform and that she 
and Elvis both loved walking horses. Priscilla 
has made tremendous contributions to Mem-
phis, not the least of which was opening 
Graceland to the public 40 years ago, now 
one of the five most visited homes in the 
country. 
A former Memphian, and a frequent visitor 
for events related to music, Priscilla deserves 
to be considered an honorary citizen of Ten-
nessee’s 9th Congressional District. Priscilla’s 
friend Dabney Coors, who had the splendid 
idea is co-chairing Friday night’s event, is 
doing a beautiful thing in honoring this kind 
and generous woman, and I look forward to a 
wonderful evening.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF JONATHON CODY 
HON. MARILYN STRICKLAND 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and service of Major 
Jonathon Cody, an extraordinary public serv-
ant in Washington State who recently retired 
from the United States Army. 
Jonathon Cody, the son of a veteran and 
police officer, grew up with a strong sense of 
patriotism. Jonathon demonstrated his dedica-
tion to his country when he entered the Army 
ROTC program and began active-duty service 
in 2002. 
When he was Second Lieutenant in the 
Ordnance Corps, Jonathon was assigned to a 
combat unit near the DMZ in South Korea. On 
active duty, his commitment to excellence was 
recognized when he was selected to attend 
the U.S. Navy School of Explosive Ordnance 
Disposal, where he earned the coveted Explo-
sive Ordnance Disposal badge. After his pro-
motion to Captain, Jonathon assumed com-
mand of the 731st EOD company, where he 
demonstrated remarkable leadership in com-
mand. He also deployed to Iraq from 2007 to 
2008 and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal 
for heroic actions which saved many lives. 
Following 
his 
deployment, 
Jonathon’s 
achievements were recognized by his chain of 
command when he was selected for the Judge 
Advocate Generals Funded Legal Education 
Program. It comes as no surprise that 
Jonathon continued to excel as a JAG. He 
served as a military prosecutor and command 
legal advisor in Washington state, served an 
additional tour in Afghanistan, and served as 
the legal advisor for the George C. Marshall 
European Center for Security Studies, where 
he met his wife, Anna Ilchenko. 
Wanting to return home to Washington state 
as he neared retirement, Jonathon was reas-
signed to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where 
he completed his service as the Chief of Fed-
eral Litigation Division and Special Assistant 
United States Attorney. On June 30, 2022, 
Major Jonathon Cody retired after 20 years of 
active-duty service in the Army. Remaining 
committed to public service, Jonathon has 
taken on a new role as a Prosecuting Attorney 
in Thurston County, Washington. 
Madam Speaker, Major Jonathon Cody has 
demonstrated remarkable courage, honor, and 
duty in service of his country. His devotion to 
our community and his country is inspirational. 
I am proud to recognize his achievements, 
celebrate his retirement, and offer these re-
marks in his honor.

ALTERNATIVE TO PUTIN 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, in response to war criminal Putin’s 
war in Ukraine, another viable alternative has 
been reported by Reuters to eliminate depend-
ency in Europe for Putin’s gas. 
Algeria, Niger, Nigeria revive talks on Sa-
haran gas pipeline. 
Algeria, Niger, and Nigeria held talks this 
week on the revival of a decades-old project 
to pipe gas across the Sahara, a potential op-
portunity for Europe to diversify its gas 
sources. 
The Trans-Saharan gas pipeline is an esti-
mated $13 billion project that could send up 
to 30 billion cubic metres a year of supplies 
to Europe. 
The revival comes at a strategic time, as 
the European Union seeks to wean itself off 
Russian gas following Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine, and is seeking alternative sources. 
‘‘(The pipeline) should allow Europe to di-
versify its sources of natural gas supply but 
also allow several African states to access 
this high value energy source,’’ said a joint 
statement. 
With a length of 4,128 kilometres (2,565 
miles), the pipeline would start in Warri, Ni-
geria, and end in Hassi R’Mel, Algeria, where 
it would connect to existing pipelines that 
run to Europe. 
Nigeria also took steps this month to move 
forward on another long-awaited pipeline, 
which would go through West Africa and Mo-
rocco to Europe. 
Along with increased American production 
reversing Biden’s failed energy policies, the 
world can come together in the conflict of au-
thoritarians (rule of gun) against democracy 
(rule of law).

HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
along 
with 
Representative 
DIANA 
DEGETTE, Representative KEN BUCK and Rep-
resentative JASON CROW to recognize Jeff 
Shoemaker of The Greenway Foundation on 
his retirement. 
For more than forty years, Jeff has served 
as the Executive Director of The Greenway 
Foundation (TGF). Under his leadership, TGF 
has partnered with countless public and pri-
vate organizations to help raise $500 million 
for environmental and recreational improve-
ments along the South Platte River and its nu-
merous tributaries throughout the Denver 
metro region and beyond. These priceless 
amenities include the watersheds of the City 
and County of Denver, along with Adams, 
Arapahoe, Boulder, Clear Creek, Douglas, and 
Jefferson Counties, as well as a number of 
nearby municipalities. This collective invest-
ment over the last four decades to the rec-
lamation and preservation of one of the re-
gion’s greatest natural resources is also a re-
sult of the more than $20 billion in economic 
development of the surrounding areas. Today 
the region is home to over 100 miles of multi- 
use recreational trails, more than 100 acres of 
parks and natural areas, and over 100,000 
acre feet of rivers and creeks. Jeffs out-
standing work has helped improve both the 
water quality and access for our region. 
Throughout his career, Jeff has made count-
less other contributions to the community 
through service on various boards and com-
mittees. In November 2018, Jeff served on the 
Executive Committee in support of the 2A bal-
lot measure in the City of Denver which se-
cured over $35 million per year for Denver’s 
parks and waterways. And as the Chair of 
Metro Denver’s Chamber’s successful 7G bal-
lot measure, he was able to help secure more 
than $20 million per year for the Urban Drain-
age and Flood Control District. Jeff also 
served as the Executive Director of the Colo-
rado Parks Foundation (CPF) which, working 
with Colorado Parks & Wildlife (CPW) as well 
as numerous county, municipal and non-profit 
organizations, provides funding, advocacy and 
community outreach for the benefit of Colo-
rado’s 42 State Parks. To date, the CPF has 
provided over $1,000,000 of project and pro-
gram-based grants since its inception in 1985. 
In 2010, the CPF coordinated the procedural 
and legislative processes resulting in the cre-
ation of a Colorado State Parks License Plate, 
allowing supporters of State Parks across Col-
orado and beyond to promote and advocate 
that support through the purchase of a State 
Parks Plate. Over 3,500 Colorado residents 
are now proud owners of the Colorado State 
Parks Plate with related proceeds providing

additional financial support to Colorado State 
Parks which, to date, has provided over 
$20,000 in grants to state parks across Colo-
rado. 
In addition to Jeff’s work professionally, he 
has served his community in other capacities. 
He taught as a public school teacher from 
1977 to 1982, served as a member of the Col-
orado Legislature from 1987 to 1992 and was 
appointed to two terms on the CSU Board of 
Trustees from 1999 to 2008. Jeff was ap-
pointed to the MSU Denver Board of Trustees 
in 2016 and serves as the President of a local 
non-profit organization called Up Close and 
Musical, which provides professional perform-
ances of classical music to elementary 
schools by Colorado Symphony Orchestra mu-
sicians. Jeff is a devoted husband to his wife 
Nancy, and a proud dad of four adult daugh-
ters and he has two granddaughters. 
We have had the privilege of working with 
Jeff on many different occasions and continue 
to appreciate his service on behalf of our com-
munity, particularly his hard work and dedica-
tion to environmental causes. We wish Jeff all 
the best in retirement and send gratitude for 
his service to our community, the State of Col-
orado, and the United States of America.

Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight the enduring friendship between 
the United States and Uzbekistan and to ex-
press my concern over the recent events that 
occurred in Karakalpakstan due to proposed 
constitutional 
amendments 
that 
revise 
Karakalpakstan’s political position within Uz-
bekistan. 
Since Uzbekistan’s independence from the 
Soviet Union in 1991, the world has witnessed 
its transformation from a once isolated and re-
pressive nation into one that strives to mod-
ernize, address human rights concerns, ease 
political tension, and engage with the inter-
national community. 
I support Uzbekistan’s sovereignty, inde-
pendence, and efforts to implement demo-
cratic reforms. I am confident in Uzbekistan’s 
ability to uphold the standards it has worked 
hard to attain in the face of this current chal-
lenge by protecting fundamental rights, includ-
ing peaceful assembly and expression. 
I express my deepest condolences to the 
families of those who lost their lives and my 
sympathies to those injured. I applaud the 
great strides Uzbekistan has made to democ-
ratize and I urge all parties to seek peaceful 
resolution to these tensions. 
I look forward to a long and mutually bene-
ficial relationship between our nations.

Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
today to recognize Jordyn Poulter for winning 
a gold medal as a member of the U.S. Wom-
en’s Volleyball team. 
Jordyn began her volleyball career at

incredible work-ethic, Jordyn led the Raptors 
to four consecutive top-eight state finishes, in-
cluding a third place finish in 2013. 
After a successful career at the University of 
Illinois and as a member of the gold-medal 
U20 Women’s Junior National Team—Jordyn 
was chosen to represent the United States at 
the 2021 Summer Olympics in Tokyo where 
she once again brought home the gold. 
Jordyn’s hard work and dedication undoubt-
edly led to her success on the court and will 
serve as an inspiration to young folks across 
the district. I want to congratulate Jordyn on 
her much-deserved success and thank her for 
being Colorado 6th’s very own Olympian.
