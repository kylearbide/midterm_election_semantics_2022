Hear our prayers, O Lord. Day and

the sun rises, we cry for Your help. Our 
evenings are overwhelmed with ques-
tions and concerns only You can an-
swer. 
If we obey Your word, will You hear 
us? If we abide by Your laws, will You 
give us an audience? 
God, You are a God of love. Love us 
with the fulfillment of Your promises. 
You are a God of justice. Show Your 
righteousness in the midst of all that 
seems so wrong around us. 
As we face down the unrest, the divi-
siveness, the cruelty that surrounds us, 
assure us that You have not abandoned 
us. When we come up against impos-
sibilities, uncertainties, and adversi-
ties, speak Your word. Give evidence of 
Your power to transform and redeem 
even the most devastating outlook for 
our future. 
All along, You have been with us. 
Today, You stand beside us. And in the 
days to come, You have promised to 
abide with us. May we trust in these 
assurances and in You this day and for-
ever. 
In Your enduring name we pray. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
D.J. JACOBETTI MICHIGAN VET-
ERANS HOME 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, on this 
Veterans Day, it is my honor to recognize the 
D.J. Jacobetti Veterans Home for decades of 
service to veterans, their families, and our 
communities. Through their tireless work and 
steadfast devotion to veterans, D.J. Jacobetti 
has become an indispensable part of the 
Upper Peninsula and the State of Michigan. 
D.J. Jacobetti was created in Marquette, 
Michigan, in 1981 following the increase in 
Michigan’s veteran population after the Viet-
nam War. The establishment of the facility fea-
tured a spacious four-story building that was 
renovated from the former St. Mary’s Hospital 
and was appropriately dedicated to the Yooper 
and longest serving member of the Michigan 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
Dominic 
J. 
Jacobetti. Throughout the past 40 years, D.J. 
Jacobetti and their staff have worked diligently 
to improve the lives of countless veterans, of-
fering a variety of care options which include 
an on-site pharmacy, rehab and therapy, de-
mentia care, and many others. The impact of 
their work has bettered the quality of life for 
many Yoopers, and their devotion to our vet-
erans and local community cannot be over-
stated. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
D.J. Jacobetti Michigan Veterans Home for 
their continued service to veterans and our 
Upper Peninsula communities. Michiganders 
can take great pride in knowing the First Dis-
trict is home to such dedicated citizens. On 
behalf of my constituents, I wish them all the 
best in their future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING 
BEN 
HERNANDEZ- 
STERN 
AND 
HIS 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
HOUSE 
JUDICIARY 
COM-
MITTEE 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise, along 
with my colleague, Congresswoman SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE, Chair of the Subcommittee on 
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, to 
thank Ben Hernandez-Stern for his service to 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ben came to the Committee as part of a ca-
reer focused on serving his country, which has 
included service in the National Guard, Air 
Force, Federal courts, Department of Health 
and Human Services, and Department of Jus-
tice. Ben received his B.A. from Brown Univer-
sity, J.D. from Stanford Law School, and M.A. 
from the U.S. Naval War College. 
Ben joined our Subcommittee on Crime, 
Terrorism, and Homeland Security as Counsel 
in 2019 and played a critical role in advancing 
the Subcommittee’s priorities during the 116th 
Congress and the beginning of the 117th Con-
gress. In the wake of an increase in hate 
crimes and gun violence, Ben played a lead-
ing role in the Subcommittee’s work to ad-
dress these crises. His portfolio included a 
wide range of issues, such as reforming our 
bail system, addressing fines and fees that 
disproportionately impact the poor and people 
of color, improving access to justice, and ad-
dressing domestic terrorism. 
Ben is a team player, who was always will-
ing to help out however needed. During the 
impeachments of President Donald Trump, 
Ben aided our oversight team—in addition to 
continuing to work on his broad policy port-
folio—in our solemn duty to hold President 
Trump accountable for his impeachable of-
fenses. 
Ben’s service to the country, however, 
wasn’t limited just to his work on the Com-
mittee during the past few years; he also con-
tinued to serve as a Judge Advocate in the 
U.S. Air Force Reserve, deploying numerous 
times to serve his country in this additional ca-
pacity. 
Ben’s work on the Committee, to make our 
laws more just, has left a lasting impact on our 
country. In addition, Ben played a key role in 
developing the next generation of public serv-
ants. During his time on the committee, Ben 
mentored dozens of interns, both on and off 
his Subcommittee, providing them with assign-
ments, valuable feedback, and guidance. 
Many of these interns went on to obtain full- 
time positions in the government thanks to 
Ben’s mentorship. 
While Ben’s career at the House Judiciary 
Committee has come to a close, his career as 
a public servant has not. Ben was nominated 
and is now serving as a Judge in the Los An-
geles County Superior Court. The California 
judiciary is fortunate to have such a strong ad-
vocate for justice on its bench. 
We thank Ben for his service to the Com-
mittee and wish him the best of luck with this 
new chapter.

RECOGNIZING 
ANDREW 
FRENCH, 
2020 CHAIR OF THE MICHIGAN 
RESTAURANT & LODGING ASSO-
CIATION 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Andrew French of Ann 
Arbor, Michigan, the 2020 Chair of the Michi-
gan Restaurant & Lodging Association and 
President of Aubree’s Flagstar. His decades of 
service to Michigan’s restaurant and lodging 
industry and to our local community is worthy 
of commendation. 
Aubrey William ‘‘Bill’’ and Sandee French 
opened Aubree’s, a bar in Ypsilanti’s historic 
Depot Town neighborhood in 1972. Raised in 
Ypsilanti, Michigan, Mr. French grew up in the 
restaurant industry. At age 15 he could be 
found in the back of his parent’s bar washing 
dishes. After graduating from Michigan State 
University in 1997, he returned home to help 
his mom and dad revamp the family bar. In 
1998, they purchased the space next door to 
the bar and expanded to become Aubree’s 
Pizzeria & Grill. 
In 2005, Mr. French became Vice President 
of the organization and when his father 
passed in 2015, he became President and 
CEO. The pizzeria quickly became a neighbor-
hood favorite and gathering spot for family and 
friends in the area. With the success of the 
original Depot Town location, Aubree’s has ex-
panded to ten locations across the state of 
Michigan. To him the most important part of 
the job is creating a great customer experi-
ence for guests—Aubree’s employees are part 
of the family. 
In 2012, Mr. French was appointed to Board 
of the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Asso-
ciation. A strong advocate for Michigan’s res-
taurant industry, he was appointed Chair of 
the Board in 2020. A voice for hospitality on 
the local, state, and federal levels, Mr. French 
is a tireless advocate for Michigan restaurants 
and their employees. Even during the pan-
demic, he has continued to help keep hun-
dreds of small businesses afloat. Active in his 
own neighborhood, he serves on the Depot 
Town Community Development Corporation, 
as the Vice Chair of the Ypsilanti DDA, and on 
the board of the Ann Arbor Area Convention 
and Visitors Bureau. He previously served on 
the boards for the Hope Clinic and the Ypsi-
lanti Area Community Foundation. He resides 
in Ann Arbor with his family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in honoring Mr. Andrew French for 
his exceptional leadership and extraordinary 
time. We are grateful for his commitment to 
the local community and economy and wish 
him and the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging 
Association continued success in the years 
ahead.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF BOB KNIGHT 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Bob 
Knight, a man who gave himself freely and 
fully to his family, business, state and commu-
nity, who died on October 28, 2021. 
He was born July 15, 1945, in the former 
Rollins Hospital at Gassville, Arkansas. Bob 
graduated from Mountain Home High School 
in 1963, the Wichita School of Broadcasting in 
1965, and served in the U.S. Navy from 1965 
to 1969 aboard the battleship New Jersey.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

November 12, 2021 
Those who were lucky enough to know Bob 
were aware that he had a deep and abiding 
passion for the Bombers, broadcasting, the 
Twin Lakes Area, his state, and the Navy. 
Many of his numberless stories were centered 
on one of those passions. His family was his 
first priority. He was married to the former Sue 
Hightower for 48 years. They were a team in 
every sense of the word. He would light up 
when talking about his daughter and grand-
children. 
Bob was 23 when he started working at 
KTLO in 1968. He and Sue were part of a 
group including two local doctors—Johnny and 
Bobby Ahrens—who bought the station in 
1973. In 1994, current co-owner Danny Ward 
and his wife, Velma, became partners, along 
with Charlie and Scottie Earls. Mountain Lakes 
Broadcasting Corporation was formed. The 
Knights and Wards bought the Earls’ interest 
in 2012. 
Bob earned accolades for his devoted and 
tireless service to organizations both local and 
statewide. He was president of the Mountain 
Home Educational Foundation for 16 years. 
He was also a past president of the Arkansas 
Broadcasters’ Association and chairman of the 
Arkansas Parks and Tourism Commission. 
The jobs Bob held had one general aim—to 
make the Twin Lake Area and the State of Ar-
kansas better places to live and work. 
Bob’s sense of humor brightened up the day 
and will be missed. For four decades, people 
in the KTLO listening area have started their 
day with his program’s signature opening, ‘‘It’s 
time to rise and shine.’’ Bob Knight was pre-
ceded in death by his wife of almost 50 years, 
Sue Hightower Knight; and son, Jordan 
Knight. He is survived by his daughter, Heath-
er Loftis, her husband, Chris, and two grand-
children: Mia and Jordan Zane Loftis.

RECOGNIZING THE 95TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE MARINE CORPS 
RESERVE ASSOCIATION 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 95th Anniversary of the 
United States Marine Corps Reserve Associa-
tion. The work of the USMCRA over nearly a 
century has been critical in ensuring the com-
mon defense of our country and assisting in 
the readiness of the U.S. Marine Corps Re-
serves for future conflict. 
The United States Naval and Marine Corps 
Reserves were established through the Naval 
Appropriations Act on August 29, 1916. Ten 
years later, the USMCRA was formed to en-
sure the readiness of Reserve Forces and 
promote the interests of the United States Ma-
rine Corps and United States Marine Corps 
Reserves. Since then, the USMCRA has con-
stantly worked to help preserve the safety of 
our country and the wellbeing of those whom 
defend it. As a Retired Lt. General and the 
former Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps 
Reserves and Marine Forces North, I deeply 
understand the importance of strong and bat-
tle-ready reserves units and will continue to 
support their mission here in Congress. The 
work of the USMCRA and the impact of their 
advocacy on behalf of our servicemembers, 
Veterans, and their families cannot be over-
stated. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize 
the United States Marine Corps Reserve As-
sociation for 95 years of service to our coun-
try. I look forward to assisting in fulfilling their 
mission to support our Servicemen and 
women. Please join me in congratulating the 
USMCRA for this historic achievement.

RECOGNIZING THE WWI MOBILE 
MUSEUM 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, as we gath-
er this Veterans Day, we pay tribute to the val-
iant men and women who dedicated their lives 
to preserving our freedoms through service to 
our great nation. 
What was proclaimed as Armistice Day on 
November 11, 1919 in commemoration of the 
end of the first World War, is now a day to 
honor America’s veterans for their patriotism, 
love of country, and willingness to serve in 
times of peace and war. By remembering the 
service and sacrifice of those who have borne 
the battle, we acknowledge their courageous 
efforts and work towards preserving peace for 
future generations. 
Today, I recognize Keith Colley, founder of 
the WWI Mobile Museum, who provides an in-
valuable opportunity for all generations to 
honor the rich history of the Great War 
through the display of the various artifacts 
ranging from trench warfare, to photographic 
and cinematic treatment of the war. Appro-
priately named the ‘‘Lest We Forget’’ exhibit, 
stemming from President Woodrow Wilson’s 
speech following the war, keeping the memory 
of WWI alive is a show of respect for the men 
and women who served and who ultimately 
perished during the conflict. 
In his time as a bereavement counselor in 
hospice care, Mr. Colley found by sharing his 
own experience visiting the National WWI Mu-
seum and Memorial, he was able to tap into 
patient memories that were previously not ac-
cessible. Mr. Colley’s initial collection of arti-
facts and photographs fully immersed his pa-
tients in their own memories, providing a 
meaningful experience that extended beyond 
traditional care. 
In partnership with the WWI Centennial 
Commission, the WWI Mobile Museum began 
touring around the country in 2015, making 
stops at multiple sites including schools, sen-
ior living communities, and historical muse-
ums. The museum has since provided citizens 
of all ages and stages with an opportunity to 
learn and reflect on the significance of WWI 
through its display of artifacts from what was 
one of the deadliest conflicts in history. 
Now, as we recognize the contributions of 
the WWI Mobile Museum in preserving these 
historical artifacts as a learning tool for future 
generations, I ask that you join me in honoring 
efforts to help others to remember the past by

HONORING THE LATE DAPHNE 
BROOKINS 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and honor Daphne Brookins an 
incredible mentor, mother, and friend to the 
people of Fort Worth’s 4th District. 
Brookins was a young adult motivational 
speaker, writer, Fort Worth ISD District 4 trust-
ee, and most recently served as an adjunct in-
structor at her alma mater, Texas Wesleyan 
University. She and her late husband, Carl 
Brookins, leave behind three sons. 
Brookins served previously as council mem-
ber and mayor pro tempore for the city of For-
est Hill. Brookins’ other affiliations include 
leadership roles with the One Star Foundation 
board, which she was appointed to by Gov. 
Greg Abbott, as well as the YMCA Metropoli-
tan Board, Director’s Circle with Girls Inc., 
Tarrant County Challenge Inc. board member, 
Advisory Board member for Expanding Your 
Horizon, Tarrant County CHIP Coalition co- 
chairperson for the Marketing Task Force, and 
the Ladder Alliance board member. 
In 2019, Brookins was elected to the FWISD 
Board of Trustees. She was later elected to a 
full term in May 2021. As a FWISD board 
member Brookins’ main focus was on advanc-
ing opportunities for young women and chil-
dren and ensuring all daycare facilities in Fort 
Worth were on the same page as the district’s 
early learning program. She was also an early 
supporter and board member for the district’s 
Young Women’s Leadership Academy. 
As a part of Fort Worth’s 4th District, she 
represented 13 schools which included O.D. 
Wyatt High School, I.M. Terrell Academy, 
Morningside Middle School, Morningside Ele-
mentary School, W.M. Green Elementary 
School, David K. Sellars Elementary School, 
Harlean Beal Elementary School, Clifford 
Davis Elementary School, Carter Park Ele-
mentary School, Edward J. Briscoe Elemen-
tary School, Carroll Peak Elementary School, 
Van Zandt-Guinn Elementary School, and 
Versia Williams Elementary School. 
It was said that Brookins was always fo-
cused on students and never allowed any op-
portunity to further their needs to be lost. She 
always wanted to ensure that families received 
resources that allowed stability and a good 
education for their children. Brookins was a 
champion for kids and a person who em-
braced her board work with collegiality and 
dedication. 
Daphne Brookins leaves behind a legacy of 
love and commitment to service that will be 
missed by all in the Fort Worth community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1225 
November 12, 2021 
As the men and women of my home state 
of Alabama know well, we have been blessed 
with a rich history in agriculture—largely 
thanks to the peanut. 
In the early 1900s, as boll weevils dev-
astated cotton crops and producers across the 
southeastern United States, Alabama farmers 
began to instead plant peanuts. This decision 
to diversify ultimately preserved the struggling 
region and led to new levels of success for its 
people. 
Having grown up on a family farm, I know 
firsthand the hard work and dedication that it 
takes to succeed in farming. Genesis 2:15 
says, ‘‘then the Lord God took the man and 
put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it 
and keep it.’’ That is exactly what our farmers 
continue to do in South Alabama. 
Today, we are proud to boast that the ma-
jority of all peanuts produced in the United 
States are grown within a 100-mile radius of 
Dothan, Alabama. 
Since November of 1938, when Dr. George 
Washington Carver addressed the very first 
National Peanut Festival, countless friends 
and families have gathered to celebrate the 
annual harvest and the many successes the 
peanut has brought to the Wiregrass. 
The festival has grown from a three-day 
event in 1938 to a full ten-day celebration in 
2021, with over 200,000 expected attendees. 
I am proud that Alabama has continued this 
tradition—a tradition that commemorates the 
true grit of our people and the pride we have 
in our history. 
I join the Second Congressional District of 
Alabama, as well as the entire state, in con-
gratulating the National Peanut Festival on its 
77th year, and I look forward to celebrating 
with this community for many years to come.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
AMERICAN 
LEGION 
POST 92 OF ROCKLAND, MI 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 100th anniversary of 
American Legion Post 92 for their century of 
service to veterans, their families, and our 
communities. Through their tireless work, ex-
ceptional leadership, and steadfast selfless-
ness, Post 92 has become an indispensable 
part of the Upper Peninsula and the State of 
Michigan. 
Post 92 was created in 1919 in Victoria, 
Michigan, following the national charter of the 
American Legion by Congress. The post was 
formed to establish a local organization to 
bring fellow Yooper Veterans together within 
the U.P. Two years later, the Legion moved to 
Rockland, Michigan, where they have been 
headquartered ever since with the mission of 
defending the U.S. Constitution and honoring 
our men and women in uniform, amongst 
many other goals. Over the last century, the 
American Legion has grown to two million 
members with over thirteen thousand posts 
nationwide. Post 92’s work has significantly 
improved the lives of countless Veterans and 
their families, and their dedication cannot be 
overstated. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
American Legion Post 92 for a century of 
service to the veterans and communities of 
the Upper Peninsula. Michiganders can take 
great pride in knowing the First District is 
home to such devoted organizations and citi-
zens. On behalf of my constituents, I wish 
them all the best in their future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING 
MONALISA 
DUGUE´  
AND 
HER 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise, along 
with my colleague, Congresswoman SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE, Chair of the Subcommittee on 
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, to 
thank Monalisa Dugue´
for her nearly five 
years of service to the Committee on the Judi-
ciary. 
Monalisa came to the Committee after 
spending more than a decade with the Public 
Defender’s office in Chicago and several years 
working for non-profits and as a consultant. 
Before starting her career, Monalisa received 
her B.A. from DePaul University and her J.D. 
from Valparaiso University School of Law. 
Monalisa joined the Committee in 2017, as 
Deputy Chief Counsel of our Subcommittee on 
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security. 
Since then, she has played an indispensable 
role in working to reform our criminal justice 
system. 
As Deputy Chief Counsel, Monalisa worked 
on a broad range of issues, including criminal 
justice reform, juvenile justice reform, and 
Tribal justice—including addressing the crisis 
of missing and murdered indigenous women. 
Monalisa 
has 
been 
instrumental 
in 
the 
House’s work to reauthorize the Violence 
Against Women Act, to pass the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act, to enact the First Step 
Act, and to fund evidence-informed strategies 
to reduce community violence and fund com-
munity violence intervention programs that ad-
dress the cycles of violence in communities. 
Monalisa’s work in the committee has had a 
lasting impact on the American people. She 
has played a key role in passing numerous 
bills into law, some of which include the VOCA 
Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act, the 
Not Invisible Act, Savanna’s Act, the Debbie 
Smith Reauthorization Act, the Commission on 
the Social Status of Black Men and Boys Act, 
and the Strengthening the Opposition to Fe-
male Genital Mutilation (STOP FGM) Act. 
Throughout all of her work, Monalisa 
brought her commitment to justice and equity 
and her tireless work ethic. Our committee, 
Congress, and the American people greatly 
benefited from her wisdom, experience, and 
contributions. Our country is a better place be-
cause of the mark Monalisa has left on it. 
While we will miss Monalisa greatly, we are 
glad she is not going far, as she will be con-
tinuing her public service career as Chief of 
Staff to Senator WHITEHOUSE. 
We thank Monalisa for her service to the 
Committee and wish her the best of luck with 
this new chapter. 
TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF WILLARD 
KINZER 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to my long-time 
friend Willard Kinzer, a World War II veteran, 
racecar driver, and successful businessman in 
Eastern Kentucky. He is a loyal patriot of this 
great nation, a generous philanthropist for 
Kentucky’s Appalachian communities and an 
innovative leader for the Kinzer Drilling Com-
pany. 
One of the most iconic symbols in Eastern 
Kentucky has become the giant American flag 
flying in front of the Kinzer Drilling head-
quarters in Prestonsburg, Kentucky. It rep-
resents Willard’s consummate pride in the 
American way of life, our military, and his 
dedication to the people of our region. After 
the attack on Pearl Harbor, Willard joined the 
U.S. Navy when he was only 16 years old— 
he adjusted his birth certificate, determined to 
help his country in World War II. He narrowly 
missed the deadly explosion on ammunition 
ship USS Mount Hood just before he was sent 
back home to the United States. That explo-
sion killed the entire 300-plus crew on board 
and nearly 100 more crew members on the 
nearby USS Mindanao. It injured 371 more, 
sank 22 small boats and damaged 18 larger 
ships. On that day, Willard’s perspective for-
ever changed, and he began living with a new 
fearless lease on life. 
Willard Kinzer is the type of person who 
wakes up and hits the ground running. In fact, 
he has a sign at home that says ‘‘Life begins 
at 200 mph.’’ With a passion for fast cars, he 
has won countless trophies and awards for 
drag racing and hill climbing competitions over 
the years, and he holds the record for being 
the first person in history to drive a stock sus-
pension car faster than 230 miles per hour. It 
should come as no surprise that he celebrated 
his 90th birthday winning a drag race cham-
pionship in Bristol, Tennessee. He is truly a 
thrill-seeker at heart. 
For 70 years, he was blessed to share 
every adventure with his wife, Lucy. Together, 
they raised a beautiful family and invested in 
local communities, helping build the Mountain 
Arts Center, the Wesley Christian School in 
Allen, 
and 
Hope 
in 
the 
Mountains 
in 
Prestonsburg. They also grew the Kinzer Drill-
ing Company into a successful gas and oil 
business, spanning 800 miles in Eastern Ken-
tucky and West Virginia. 
On this Veterans Day, I count it a great 
honor to join the people of Eastern Kentucky 
in recognizing the outstanding accomplish-
ments of Willard Kinzer, saluting him for his 
valiant service during World War II and his 
continued work across Eastern Kentucky.

war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This 
short, but furious and deadly, conflict stemmed 
from historical differences regarding geo-
graphic territory based on ethnicity and reli-
gion. I do not pretend to know the details of 
this conflict. The seeds for this conflict were 
sown decades ago, perhaps even a century 
ago, with the advent of the Soviet Union as 
well as the decline of the Ottoman Empire. 
Here is what I do know. The Armenians and 
the Azerbaijanis deserve to live and prosper in 
peace. Nations require territorial integrity. The 
boundaries of a given nation should also re-
flect history, ethnicity, and religious differences 
to minimize conflict. 
I am hopeful for the future that these two 
nations, both with a proud and great history, 
will be able to resume their relationship in 
peace and that the parties work, in good faith, 
to resolve their issues without bullets. 
God bless the people there and through His 
will it is my hope peace will prevail.

HONORING PATRICIA THOMPSON 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Patricia Thompson and 
wish her well in her retirement after 43 years 
of dedicated service to the township of 
Willingboro, New Jersey. 
Patricia first joined the Willingboro Police 
Department in 1978 as a traffic guard and 
since day one, she has been a comforting 
presence to Willingboro students and resi-
dents. Having lived in the town for most of her 
life, I was not surprised to hear that through-
out her tenure, Patricia was eager to take on 
additional responsibilities like overseeing the 
bicycle 
auction. 
Her 
commitment 
to 
Willingboro earned her a promotion to Cross-
ing Guard Supervisor in 2011, where she has 
been a vital addition to training the next gen-
eration of crossing guards. 
On behalf of our entire district, I want to 
thank Patricia for her tireless commitment to 
the township of Willingboro, New Jersey. I 
wish Patricia every enjoyment in retirement 
with her husband and children.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF GEORGE LABLONDE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the life of George 
LaBlonde, who passed away recently after a 
lifetime of service. Through his extreme dedi-
cation to the public good, George became an 
indispensable part of the Upper Peninsula, the 
State of Michigan, and the United States of 
America. 
A native Yooper, George was born in 
Ironwood, Michigan, on October 17, 1938. He 
was raised in Ironwood and graduated from 
Luther L. Wright High School in 1956. With a 
deep-rooted drive to serve others, George 
furthered his education at the Michigan Col-
lege of Mining and Technology in 1960 while 
also earning a commission as a Second Lieu-
tenant with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
He went on to attend several other prestigious 
institutions including Purdue University, the 
U.S. Army War College, the Department of 
Defense Language Institute, the Army Com-
mand and General Staff College, and com-
pleted numerous other specialized courses. In 
addition to his impressive and comprehensive 
military education, George’s 30 years of serv-
ice earned him several honors and decora-
tions including the Legion of Merit Medal, the 
Bronze Star Medal, the Meritorious Service 
Medal, the Air Medal, the Joint Service Com-
mendation Medal, the Army Commendation 
Medal with ‘‘V’’ device, the Parachute Badge, 
amongst many others. As a retired Marine my-
self, I greatly appreciate the longtime devotion 
George gave to our Nation. 
George passed away on October 29, 2021. 
His steadfast care and friendly nature towards 
all members of his community will surely leave 
a lasting mark on those who had the oppor-
tunity to know him. He is missed dearly by his 
family and friends, and his legacy will un-
doubtedly live on for generations to come. 
George’s tireless dedication to public service 
touched the lives of countless Michiganders, 
and the impact of his work cannot be over-
stated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life of George LaBlonde. 
His legacy will forever live on in his family and 
in the many lives he bettered through his serv-
ice.

RECOGNIZING 
CHRISTINE

ARD AND HER SERVICE TO THE 
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise along 
with my colleague, Congresswoman SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE, Chair of the Subcommittee on 
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, to 
thank Christine Leonard for her service to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Christine came to the Committee as part of 
a career focused on judiciary and criminal jus-
tice issues. Before joining the Committee as 
Counsel, Christine had a long history of work-
ing closely with the Committee in various 
roles, including as Counsel to Rep. Delahunt, 
Senior Counsel to Sen. Ted Kennedy, Director 
of the Office of Legislative Affairs at the Office 
of National Drug Control Policy, as the Direc-
tor of the Vera Institute of Justice’s DC Office, 
Executive Director of the Coalition for Public 
Safety, and as Director of the Office of Legis-
lative Affairs at the U.S. Sentencing Commis-
sion. Christine received her B.A. and J.D. from 
Boston College. 
Christine 
joined 
our 
Subcommittee 
on 
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security as 
Counsel in 2020 and has played an integral 
role in our prison and drug enforcement re-
form work. Among other things, she also 
played a critical role in helping to advance my 
bill, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment 
and Expungement (MORE) Act—which would 
reverse failed federal policies criminalizing 
marijuana and would take steps to address 
the heavy toll this policy has taken across the 
country, particularly among communities of 
color—through the Committee. 
The Committee and the country at large 
have benefited greatly from Christine’s dedica-
tion to reforming our criminal justice system 
and ensuring our laws are equitably applied. 
We will greatly miss her strong work ethic and 
passion for justice, as she takes the next step 
in her career. 
We thank Christine for her service to the

this new chapter.

OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise

Mason. Lt. Colonel Mason enlisted as a medic 
on Active Duty in 1985. He served in Desert 
Shield/Desert Storm as a medic on a Forward 
Area Surgical Team assigned to the 44th

He commissioned as an Engineer Officer in

utive Officer with the 239th Engineer Com-
pany, 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team to

ious full-time duty assignments in the AGR

Adjutant Generals’ special staff, State Public 
Affairs Officer and Director of Communica-
tions. 
He was an Assistant Professor of Military

also served two years in the command posi-
tion, the Professor of Military Science, bringing 
the program back from closure and into viabil-
ity standards. During his six and a half years 
at Arkansas State University, he commis-
sioned 102 officers for the Active Duty Army, 
Army National Guard, and Army Reserve. 
Upon retirement, Lt. Colonel Mason and his 
wife, Loretta, plan to enjoy their grandchildren

Lt. Colonel Mason for 36 years of total service 
and 26 years of Active Duty service to our Na-

November 12, 2021 
me in celebrating Paul Laurence Dunbar Sen-
ior High School’s 150th anniversary and par-
ticularly Carrie Thornhill for her phenomenal 
leadership with the Dunbar Alumni Federation. 
I am fortunate to be an alumna of Dunbar 
High School and a member of the class of 
1955. 
Dunbar High School, which started in a 
church basement, was the first public high 
school for African Americans in the United 
States and remained segregated until 1954, 
when the District of Columbia was one of the 
six Brown v. Board of Education jurisdictions 
that 
successfully 
challenged 
segregated 
schools in the United States. Dunbar was in-
strumental in making the District of Columbia 
a bulwark of education for almost a century, 
attracting students from across the District, 
who were drawn by the school’s excellent rep-
utation. That same reputation was reinforced 
by Dunbar’s remarkable record of graduating 
more distinguished African Americans than 
any high school in the country. Among them 
were Edward Brooke, the first Black popularly 
elected United States Senator; Robert C. 
Weaver, the first Black cabinet secretary; Ben-
jamin O. Davis Sr., the first Black general in 
the U.S. Army; Wesley Brown, the first Black 
graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy; Charles 
R. Drew, the discoverer of blood plasma; and 
Mary Jane Patterson, the first African Amer-
ican to achieve a college degree. Dunbar also 
drew teachers with advanced degrees who 
would have been college professors but for 
segregation in higher education. 
In 2002, Dunbar High School established 
the Dunbar Alumni Federation, which works in 
partnership with school leadership to create 
better futures for Dunbar students and grad-
uates, which has already awarded over $1.5 
million in scholarships to over 700 students. 
Dunbar has been recently rebuilt into a state- 
of-the-art facility and became a neighborhood 
school following the Brown decision. Its storied 
history continues to inspire generations of stu-
dents. 
I have introduced a bill directing the Sec-
retary of the Treasury to mint commemorative 
coins in recognition of Paul Laurence Dunbar, 
the proceeds from the sale of which would 
benefit of the Dunbar Alumni Association. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in congratulating Dun-
bar High School for 150 years of educating 
the students of the District of Columbia.

HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, 
today I recognize my good friend Mary Anne 
Chern, ACFRE, FAHP, a highly regarded 
healthcare fundraiser who has retired from Ad-
ventist Health White Memorial in Los Angeles 
after 24 years of dedicated service. White Me-
morial is the region’s leading faith-based, non-
profit hospital and is located in the Boyle 
Heights neighborhood of East Los Angeles. 
For years, Mary Anne served as president of 
the Adventist Health White Memorial Chari-
table Foundation and as a member of the hos-
pital’s Executive Team. I thank Mary Anne for 
her years of friendship and counsel and her 
unrelenting dedication to the healthcare fund-
raising profession. 
Over the course of her 40-year career, Mary 
Anne has raised over $500 million for 
healthcare institutions in principal and major 
gifts, private grants, and government funding. 
She is highly respected by her peers and is a 
friend and mentor to healthcare development 
professionals across the nation and worldwide. 
Mary Anne is one of only seven fundraising 
professionals in the world to have achieved 
both the Advanced Certified Fund Raising Ex-
ecutive (ACFRE) and the Fellow of Associa-
tion of Healthcare Philanthropy (FAHP) certifi-
cations. She is also a Si Seymour Award win-
ner for ‘‘career excellence and outstanding 
leadership.’’ The Si Seymour Award is the 
highest international recognition in healthcare 
fundraising and has only been given to a total 
of 41 fundraising professionals since 1970. 
In 2010, Mary Anne was elected to be the 
international chair of the Association of 
Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP) by its over 
5,000 members. The AHP is the leading au-
thority on healthcare philanthropy and it rep-
resents development professionals at more 
than 2,000 nonprofit hospitals, medical cen-
ters, health systems and related facilities 
throughout North America and abroad. 
Mary Anne has extensive experience teach-
ing fundraising best practices and she served 
on the two boards that certify professional 
fundraisers internationally: the CFRE Board of 
Directors and the AHP Board of Certification, 
the latter of which she chaired. She also 
served on the national board of the Associa-
tion of Fundraising Professionals and its great-
er Los Angeles chapter, as well as the boards 
of CFRE International, which credentials fund-
raising professionals; the Milton Murray Foun-
dation for Philanthropy, which develops the 
expertise of nonprofit leaders; and the South-
ern California Association for Healthcare De-
velopment (SCAHD). 
Mary Anne is the co-author of a book and 
the author of numerous articles on fundraising. 
She won the AHP Journal Award in 2009 for 
her article, ‘‘Hispanic Fundraising: Myths and 
Realities.’’ She has a special interest in social 
determinants of both individual and population 
health, and she currently serves on the Steer-
ing Committee of the Los Angeles County

Partnership. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in recognizing Mary Anne’s immense 
contributions to the healthcare fundraising in-
dustry and her outstanding leadership and 
commitment to providing quality and acces-
sible health services to the greater Eastside 
Los Angeles community through Adventist 
White Memorial. Thanks to her years of serv-
ice, my constituents have been able to access 
high-quality care in a modern and techno-
logically advanced facility. Mary Anne’s ability 
to make others feel special and welcome in 
the Adventist Health White Memorial commu-
nity is something we will all miss. I thank her 
for her warmth and her dedication to ensuring 
that the healthcare industry has the funding it 
needs to implement the highest possible care 
for 
Angelenos, 
Americans, 
and 
patients 
around the world.

CONGRATULATING 
KIEL 
ATANASOFF FOR RECEIVING THE 
PATRIOT AWARD 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Kiel Atanasoff for receiving 
the Patriot Award by the Department of De-
fense. Through his exceptional leadership and 
steadfast 
devotion 
to 
workers 
and 
servicemembers at Krist Oil Company, Kiel 
has become an indispensable part of the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 
The Patriot Award is presented to super-
visors and employers across the country who 
display 
exceptional 
support 
towards 
servicemembers in their workforce. In recogni-
tion of his exceptional leadership and devotion 
to his colleagues, fellow employee and 
Guardsman David Froland nominated Kiel for 
this distinguished award. This is in response 
to Kiel’s continued support to Mr. Froland 
when he was deployed to Washington, D.C., 
earlier this year with the U.S. National Guard. 
A longtime U.P. company, Krist Oil has contin-
ued to exemplify the gold standard of support 
for our military members and communities. As 
a veteran myself, I greatly appreciate the dedi-
cation they give to both our active and retired 
Servicemembers. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Kiel Atanasoff for receiving the Patriot 
Award. Michiganders can take great pride in 
knowing the First District is home to such a 
selfless leader. On behalf of my constituents, 
I wish Kiel all the best in his future endeavors.

thank Tieffa ‘‘Ti’’ Harper for her service to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ti came to the Committee as a detailee 
from the Federal Public Defender’s Office ear-
lier this year, and she has contributed greatly 
to the work of the committee. Ti has worked 
on a broad range of issues, including, among 
other areas, reauthorization of the Violence 
Against Women Act, oversight of the Bureau 
of Prisons, sentencing reform—including ad-
dressing the crack cocaine sentencing dis-
parity through the EQUAL Act—and juvenile 
justice. 
The Committee has significantly benefited 
from Ti’s insight as a public defender, her so-
phisticated legal analysis skills, and her knowl-
edge of the criminal justice system. Ti was 
able to quickly jump into the work of the Com-
mittee when her detail began, expertly ana-
lyzing complex legislation, drafting policy op-
tions to address some of the most pressing 
criminal justice issues of our time, and pre-
paring for hearings and markups. 
The Committee and the American people 
have been fortunate to have Ti as a strong ad-
vocate for a more just legal system during her 
time working in Congress. While we will miss 
Ti greatly, we congratulate her on her new po-
sition with the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
We thank Ti for her service to the Com-
mittee and wish her the best of luck with this 
new chapter.

RECOGNIZING BAKERSFIELD 
COLLEGE 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bakersfield College for 
their incredible work and commitment to high-
er education. 
Bakersfield College is a vital institution in 
our community. The staff, students, and fac-
ulty of this school are completely dedicated to 
quality education and are a model to all of us 
in California’s Central Valley. 
This year, Bakersfield College has once 
again received statewide recognition for their 
commitment to excellence by being awarded 
the Champion of Higher Education by the 
Campaign for College Opportunity. This award 
recognizes Bakersfield College for their cre-
ative work to advance educational success 
among their students, many of whom are first 
generation Americans. 
This is the fourth consecutive year that Ba-
kersfield College will be receiving recognition 
as a Champion of Higher Education. Winning 
this award year after year demonstrates their 
commitment to creative solutions that help stu-
dents grow academically, as well as reduce 
barriers to entry. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the incredible work of both 
the students and faculty of Bakersfield Col-
lege. They are a vital part of our community, 
and I wish them continued success in their en-
during pursuit to provide high-quality education 
opportunities to our community.

TEXAS 
MEMORIAL 
ILLUMINATION AT SAN JACINTO 
IN LA PORTE, TX 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the San Jacinto Museum and Bat-
tlefield Association, the Texas Historical Com-
mission, and the volunteers honoring the thou-
sands of Texans who selflessly gave their 
lives in armed conflict around the world. From 
the start of the Texas Revolution in 1835 
through the war in Afghanistan, 21,500 Texan 
lives have been lost. 
On November 13, 2021, volunteers will 
place and light 21,500 luminaries on the San 
Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site to 
honor every Texan who made the ultimate 
sacrifice. Each luminary reminds us that free-
dom is not free and honors all those who 
humbly gave their lives to protect our liberties, 
Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize 
and express my gratitude to ‘‘The Texas Me-
morial Illumination at San Jacinto’’ and their 
volunteers for their hard work to honor those 
Texans who died fighting for what they be-
lieved in.

INTRODUCTION OF THE RESOLU-
TION EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION 
OF 
THE 
MONTH OF NOVEMBER 2021 AS 
‘‘PANCREATIC 
CANCER 
AWARE-
NESS MONTH’’ 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to introduce a bipartisan resolution 
today with my colleagues, Representatives 
ESHOO, MCKINLEY, and MCCLAIN. Our resolu-
tion raises awareness about pancreatic cancer 
and the importance of increased Congres-
sional funding for research by expressing sup-
port for the designation of the month of No-
vember 2021 as Pancreatic Cancer Aware-
ness Month. I am grateful for Representatives 
ESHOO, MCKINLEY, and MCCLAIN’s leadership 
in helping to combat pancreatic cancer. 
Recently, pancreatic cancer has killed three 
American icons: Congressman John Lewis, 
Congressman Alcee Hastings, and Supreme 
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Accurately 
described as a silent killer, this disease does 
not have an early detection test, so unfortu-
nately, by year’s end, pancreatic cancer will 
have killed an estimated 47,050 Americans 
and is the third largest cause of cancer-related 
death in our country. As COVID–19 continues 
to rob us of our fellow Americans, pancreatic 
cancer continues to devastate thousands of 
American families and communities. In my 
home state of Indiana, nearly 1,000 Hoosiers 
will be killed by pancreatic cancer by year’s 
end, and almost 2,000 Hoosiers will be newly 
diagnosed with this terrible disease. Nation-
wide, an additional 60,430 Americans will be 
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year. 
These horrific statistics highlight how few 
tools exist to detect this disease and, as a re-
sult, the immense pain and suffering it causes. 
Alarmingly, pancreatic cancer still has no early 
detection test to quickly and accurately deter-
mine the presence of this cancer. As a result, 
it is very difficult to detect this cancer before 
it has advanced to later—and more deadly— 
stages. Tragically, 72 percent of pancreatic 
cancer patients live less than one year fol-
lowing their diagnosis. This was the case for 
our colleague, Congressman John Lewis, who 
was killed by pancreatic cancer less than a 
year following his diagnosis. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has also high-
lighted how longstanding health disparities and 
lack of access to care results in dispropor-
tionate numbers of infections and deaths from 
this virus in communities of color. Sadly, the 
same is true with pancreatic cancer. The inci-
dence rate for pancreatic cancer among Black 
Americans is twenty percent higher than that 
of any other racial demographic and the death 
rate is seventeen percent higher for Black 
men than for white men. In this way, the lack 
of pancreatic cancer early detection research 
accelerates the racial inequities in our health 
care system, with devastating consequences 
for minorities. 
To help detect pancreatic cancer earlier and 
to help address racial inequities, the 117th 
Congress has a unique opportunity to make 
historic investments in pancreatic cancer re-
search at the Department of Defense (DoD). 
Congress can do this by increasing funding to 
pancreatic cancer research. Within this re-
search funding, DoD should include early de-
tection research as a major funding priority to 
help more patients detect this deadly disease 
early. In fact, if diagnosed early, the 5-year 
survival rate for pancreatic cancer patients is 
above 80 percent. Current pancreatic cancer 
research funding remains at a fraction of the 
level that our fellow Americans struggling with 
this disease deserve. That’s why it is so crit-
ical that we raise awareness about how dead-
ly and destructive this cancer is to our Amer-
ican family, and why increasing pancreatic 
cancer research is critical to lowering this dis-
ease’s deadliness. 
Moreover, at a time when our country is 
having a national conversation about the deep 
disparities in access to health care for Black 
and Brown people during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Congress must do everything within 
our power to improve health outcomes through 
research and treatment, and that includes 
pancreatic cancer. And in order to ensure that 
we improve outcomes, we need to raise 
awareness with the American public and our 
colleagues in Congress about just how deadly 
this cancer is and why we need to find early 
detection tools, effective treatments and re-
duce this disease’s disproportionate impact on 
communities of color. 
I urge my colleagues in the House to sup-
port this resolution.

Eduardo Corte´s and congratulate him on his 
retirement. Throughout his career, Dr. Corte´s 
has played an integral role in strengthening 
and empowering our district’s Latino commu-
nity. 
Corte´s’ career in academia has taken him 
across the nation, with faculty and administra-
tive appointments at the University of Colo-
rado Denver, the University of San Francisco, 
and the University of California, Berkeley, 
where he taught graduate courses in social 
policy advocacy and public policy analysis. 
Corte´s also served as Scholar in Residence 
and Special Community Member at the Uni-
versity of Denver Graduate School of Social 
Work where he tackled questions surrounding 
income security and care for disabled Latino 
elders, policy analysis and advocacy by public 
charities, and improvement of curricula in 
schools of social work. 
His contribution to the community did not 
stop there. Dr. Corte´s spends much of his 
time outside work volunteering to help Latinos 
in Colorado solve problems facing their com-
munities. Recently, Dr. Corte´s was honored by 
the Latino Caucus in the Colorado General 
Assembly for his work as executive director at 
the Colorado Latino Leadership, Advocacy, 
and Research Organization (CLLARO). In this 
role, he led the organization in its effort to em-
power Latinos across Colorado through lead-
ership development, advocacy, and policy re-
search. 
Dr. Corte´s’ extraordinary career and service 
to our community has caused a positive ripple 
effect across our community that has certainly 
not gone unnoticed. I congratulate Dr. Corte´s 
on his retirement and thank him for his incred-
ible dedication to our community.

RECOGNIZING 
ANTONIO 
‘‘TONY’’ 
D’AGOSTINI FOR HIS SERVICE TO 
OUR COUNTRY AND HIS COMMU-
NITY 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Antonio ‘‘Tony’’ D’Agostini 
of Sterling Heights, Michigan, for his decades 
long service to our country and his community. 
Born in Italy, Tony soon moved with his 
family to Canada and then Michigan. In Sep-
tember of 1965, Tony was drafted into the 
United States Army and served in the 9th In-
fantry Division, 15th Engineer Battalion. After 
spending time at Fort Riley in Kansas, Tony 
was sent to Vietnam, spending a year there 
before returning home and leaving the service 
in August 1967. More than 50 years later, 
Tony still pays tribute and keeps the memory 
of his fallen comrades alive. Just this past 
week, Tony and his wife came to Washington 
for Veterans Day in order to honor and re-
member those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. 
After his service, Tony spent some time in 
college before joining his dad and brother in 
the family construction company. Tony retired 
a few years ago, after roughly a half century 
of work. Outside of work, Tony has given back 
to his community. For example, he has an an-
nual car show that raises money for soup 
kitchens, and he has given money to organi-
zations such as Forgotten Harvest, who help 
ensure food that would otherwise go to waste 
is delivered to the hungry. His philosophy is 
simple, as he said, ‘‘we just help people that 
really need help.’’ For his philanthropic efforts, 
Tony was the recent recipient of a humani-
tarian award. 
Madam Speaker, Tony D’Agostini is a self-
less American patriot. He has served his 
country with honor and his community with 
compassion. The legacy he has built is one of 
altruism and of thoughtfulness for others. I 
hope he is proud of the contributions he has 
made to this country and its citizens. I thank 
Tony for his service, for keeping the memory 
of America’s heroes alive, and for his devotion 
to others. He has set an example I hope all 
will follow. I wish him nothing but the best as 
he continues to lead a life of selfless dedica-
tion to others.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
CHARLES E. HAWTHORNE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 12, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Doctor Charles E. 
Hawthorne of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who 
passed away on November 1st. His lifetime of 
service and dedication to our community is 
worthy of commendation. 
The son of Jesse and Cleanna Hawthorne, 
Dr. Hawthorne felt the call to serve from a 
young age. A graduate of Cooley High School 
in Detroit, Michigan, he started and led a cam-
pus ministry called Youth For Christ. In col-
lege, Dr. Hawthorne founded the United Stu-
dents for Christ ministry. He graduated from 
the University of Michigan with a B.A. in Soci-
ology and M.A. in Guidance & Counseling. 
While still studying in university, he became a 
licensed minister in 1976 through Pastor 
James E. Slappy, Jr. and was ordained to the 
ministry in 1978 by Bishop J.S. Bailey. He 
later graduated summa cum laude from Trinity 
Theological Seminary with a Ph.D. in Biblical 
Counseling in 1987. 
As soon as Dr. Hawthorne graduated from 
the University of Michigan he stepped into 
ministry full-time with United Ministries in High-
er Education at Eastern Michigan University. A 
talented preacher, he spread his passion at 
college 
campuses 
across 
Michigan 
and 
touched the lives of countless students. In 
1980, he founded Labor of Love Ministries, 
and in 1982 it officially became a church. 
Labor of Love Ministries located in Ypsilanti, 
Michigan, where Dr. Hawthorne served as 
Senior Pastor, has been a faithful gathering 
place and spiritual home for so many. 
Described by those who knew him as a vi-
sionary leader and passionate teacher, Dr. 
Hawthorne sought to spread his faith around 
the nation and the world but felt strongest 
about serving his home church and loving 
community here in Michigan. A leader not only 
in the world of ministry, he was a member of 
the Ministerial Alliance of Ann Arbor and Ypsi-
lanti and the Pastors Alliance for County 
Transformation. Dr. Hawthorne also served as 
President and CEO of Hawthorne Ministries, 
President of Samaritan Community Develop-
ment Corporation, Superintendent of the 
Northeast Michigan Headquarters District, and 
as a Board Member of the Church of God in 
Christ Missions Department, A man with a tre-
mendous heart, beloved by his family, stu-
dents, and congregation alike—he will never 
be forgotten. 
Madam Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Dr. Charles E. Haw-
thorne, a pillar of our community and a man 
of true faith. His legacy is one that will remain 
for years to come in the hearts of those who 
knew him. Our thoughts are with his family— 
wife 
Donna, 
children 
Charles 
II 
and 
LaDonna—friends, and their congregation at 
this time.
