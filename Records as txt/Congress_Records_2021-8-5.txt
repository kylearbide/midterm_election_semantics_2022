PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Spirit, our counselor and 
guide, give our lawmakers the faith to 
believe in the ultimate triumph of 
truth and righteousness. 
Lord, teach them to do things Your 
way, embracing Your precepts, and 
walking in Your path. Provide them 
the wisdom to not become careless 
about their spiritual and moral growth, 
as You provide them courage and grace 
to do Your will. Inspire them to expect 
to live satisfying lives as You enable 
them to replace their fears with faith, 
their confusion with clarity, and their 
discouragement with optimism. 
We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.

UNANIMOUS 
CONSENT 
AGREE-
MENT—EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before my remarks, I ask unanimous 
consent that the cloture vote on the 
Lee nomination occur at a time to be 
determined today by the majority lead-
er following consultation with the Re-
publican leader. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, all 
week, as we all know, Senators have 
worked together to move forward on 
the 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
bill. 
Since the text of the bipartisan pro-
posal was finalized on Sunday, both 
sides have had extensive opportunities 
to offer amendments. Senators have 
certainly taken advantage. 
So far, the Senate has considered 22 
amendments on this bipartisan piece of 
legislation. We considered 14 amend-
ments yesterday alone. Of the 22 total 
amendments, more than half have been 
offered by our Republican colleagues. 
Clearly, the Democratic majority has 
given Members who were not part of 
the bipartisan group a chance to make 
their mark on this important bill. 
Taking a step back, this Senate has 
operated much differently under Demo-
cratic leadership this year than it did 
under Republican leadership over the 
past 6. We have had bipartisan bills on 
the floor, open for amendment, and all 
100 Senators are participating in the 
legislative process. The anti-Asian hate 
crimes bill and the USICA bill were 
both major bills that worked in a bi-
partisan way with amendments, as is 
this bill. 
We have taken more amendment 
votes this year than nearly any year in 
recent memory. In fact, we have had 
more rollcall votes on amendments 
this year, only halfway through, than 
during the past 2 years, where the Re-
publicans were in charge, combined. In 
other words, in one-half of the year in 
2021, where Democrats got in charge, 
we have had more amendments than in 
all of 2019 and 2020. So any talk that we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5892 
August 5, 2021 
are not working the Senate, whenever 
we can, in a fair, bipartisan way is just 
wrong—just wrong. 
Consider this: At this point in the 
calendar year in 2017, the first year of 
a Republican President and a Repub-
lican Senate majority—a one-to-one 
comparison to our current political 
configuration—the Senate held rollcall 
votes on 10 amendments—10—at this 
point in the first year of the Trump 
Presidency. On this bipartisan infra-
structure bill alone, the Senate has 
held rollcall votes on 17 amendments. 
In 7 months, the 2017 Republican ma-
jority allowed rollcall votes on only 10 
amendments, and we have done almost 
double that number in the past 7 days 
alone. 
This is how I promised the Chamber 
would function under a Democratic 
majority. I promised it while we were 
fighting to get that majority, and we 
are fulfilling that promise now that we 
have it. Legislators should actually 
have a chance to legislate. No one can 
deny that we kept our word here in the 
Democratic majority. 
Today, we will consider even more 
amendments, and then, hopefully, we 
can bring this bill to a close very 
shortly. Our goal is to pass both a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill and a budg-
et resolution during this work period, 
and we will stay here to get both done. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. On another matter, 
climate. President Biden announced 
this morning that he will sign an Exec-
utive order to significantly escalate 
our country’s fight against climate 
change. 
Specifically, President Biden’s Exec-
utive order will set an ambitious goal 
to make half of all new cars sold in 
America zero emissions by the end of 
the decade. He will announce further 
steps to address several of the worst 
climate-warming rules that were put in 
place under the Trump administration. 
I applaud President Biden for taking 
necessary steps to put our country on a 
path to substantially reduce our car-
bon pollution. Climate change is the 
defining challenge of our times. We 
have no choice but to reduce our coun-
try’s greenhouse gas emissions very 
quickly to reach the targets that will 
spare our country and our planet the 
worst effects of climate change, and we 
cannot do it without dealing with car-
bon pollution from cars we drive. 
Transportation is the biggest source of 
carbon pollution, accounting for rough-
ly one-third of America’s carbon out-
put. 
President Biden’s Executive order is 
an important step in the right direc-
tion, and I am happy and proud to say 
it dovetails with an effort I have long 
advocated here in the Congress, even 
before the Biden Presidency. It is 
called Clean Cars for America. In fact, 
President Biden generously adopted 
our Clean Cars for America plan and 
placed it in his Build Back Better. 
My Clean Cars for America pro-
posal—and I have worked closely with 
Senator STABENOW, Senator PETERS, 
and others on this proposal—would 
help our country make the transition 
that President Biden is talking about 
today by making electric cars more af-
fordable, expanding our charging infra-
structure, and creating incentives to 
manufacture batteries and electric ve-
hicles here in America. It is good for 
climate. It good for jobs. And it is good 
for America to become the center of 
electric 
car 
manufacturing 
in 
the 
world, as we have been with the tradi-
tional type of automobile. 
The proposal—I am proud to say we 
worked hard to make this happen. 
Clean Cars for America is now, as I 
said, largely adopted in the Build Back 
Better plan and is supported not only 
by the environmental community, but 
by the major labor unions and several 
of the major car manufacturers as well. 
It is the first time on a major piece of 
climate legislation we have gotten 
such broad support. 
The transition to electric vehicles, of 
course, is already underway, but it is 
not happening fast enough to reach the 
targets 
that 
President 
Biden 
an-
nounced today. Clean Cars for America 
is the way to supercharge the transi-
tion to electric vehicles, and large 
parts of it will be—some of it was put 
in the bipartisan infrastructure bill, 
but large parts of it we hope to add in 
the reconciliation process. 
Put another way: If President Biden’s 
Executive order represents the destina-
tion we need to reach on the horizon, 
our Clean Cars for America is the road 
to get there. 
President 
Biden’s 
announcement, 
combined with our Clean Cars proposal, 
represents the bold level of action we 
need to tackling carbon pollution from 
cars. 
When Democrats assumed the major-
ity, I instructed my committee chairs 
to find climate-reducing policies to in-
corporate into the legislation we work 
on. Earlier this year, the Senate passed 
the first major climate legislation in 
years when we reversed the Trump ad-
ministration’s methane emissions rule. 
And as we continue working on a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill and a budget 
resolution, I have committed that we 
will make historic investments in re-
versing climate change. I am proud to 
say our Clean Cars for America is going 
to be a very big part of that. 
Democrats promised action on cli-
mate, and we are going to make it a 
vital part of the legislation we work on 
in the weeks to come. It is a big chal-
lenge, but one we must meet. It is so 
important for the future of our planet, 
for our children, and our grandchildren 
even more than for us. 
f 
EVICTION MORATORIUM 
Mr. SCHUMER. One final matter, 
evictions. Earlier this week, the Biden 
administration announced that the 
CDC will adopt an eviction moratorium 
to provide critical protections for an-
other 60 days as our country continues 
its path towards full recovery. 
I applaud everyone who made it hap-
pen, from the President to the CDC, to 
Speaker PELOSI, to Senator BROWN, as 
well as several of my Democratic col-
leagues in the House, including a brave 
band of New Yorkers, including Con-
gress Member OCASIO-CORTEZ and Con-
gressman JONES. Above all, Represent-
ative CORI BUSH gets huge credit—one 
person who changed things for tens of 
thousands, maybe hundreds of thou-
sands of people, and everyone who 
stood with her as well. 
As I explained yesterday, while this 
moratorium is an important safeguard 
to protect millions of American fami-
lies in danger of evictions, it is not the 
only piece of the puzzle. Once the mor-
atorium comes to an end—whenever 
that is—there is still a fundamental 
challenge of making up for a year of 
lost rent and lost mortgage payments. 
Congress considered this problem 
very early this year. I pushed for, and 
we passed, along with Senator BROWN 
and so many others, substantial rental 
and mortgage assistance in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. 
Unfortunately, 
State 
governments 
have been really uneven about distrib-
uting that crucial assistance. A few 
States—the State of Illinois, the State 
of Texas—have done a pretty good job, 
but many have not. Unfortunately, one 
of those that has done a very poor job 
distributing this money is my home 
State of New York. 
Simply put: State governments, espe-
cially New York, must do a better job 
of distributing the $47 billion Congress 
appropriated for emergency rental as-
sistance. The money is there, but far 
too little has gone out the door. 
In New York specifically, Congress 
sent more than $2 billion to help rent-
ers in New York; and, inexplicably, 
some reports indicate less than 0.5 per-
cent of New York’s allocation had been 
received by tenants and landlords as of 
a week ago. 
Today, I am sending a letter with 
colleagues in the New York delegation 
to the New York State Office of Tem-
porary and Disability Assistance, call-
ing on that office to hurry up to fix the 
inexcusable delays in rental assistance 
and 
immediately 
begin 
disbursing 
these funds. 
We need to understand why New 
Yorkers are having such trouble navi-
gating the process to get the money 
they need. There have been reports of 
frustrating crashes and glitches on the 
online application process, confusing 
instructions, and very little support to 
help the applicants, even though the 
money has been there for several 
months. 
The clock is ticking to fix this mess. 
The State moratorium expires in less 
than a month, and the CDC’s morato-
rium will give only one more month of 
protection after that. New York State 
needs to act quickly, and we expect a 
response by August 9 as to how we can

get a handle on these delays and, most 
importantly, get the money to New 
Yorkers faster so they can pay the 
rent. 
By the way, many landlords, particu-
larly small landlords, depend on this as 
well. If you worked hard—let’s say you 
are a bus driver and you own a three- 
family house. When the tenants in your 
house don’t pay you, you don’t have 
any cushion and you have to pay the 
mortgage. So this bill will help with 
that as well, this proposal. 
Right now, there are 61⁄2
million 
Americans who are behind in their 
rent. According to the New York 
Times, over 400,000 renters in New York 
City alone owe a collective debt of $2 
billion. 
Congress did its job by making sure 
that we have money in place to help 
these Americans avoid evictions. Now 
the States need to step it up to make 
sure that this money gets into the 
hands of renters as soon as possible. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The

OFFICER

AWARDING FOUR CONGRESSIONAL 
GOLD MEDALS TO THE UNITED 
STATES 
CAPITOL 
POLICE 
AND 
THOSE 
WHO 
PROTECTED 
THE 
U.S. CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6, 2021 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, ear-
lier this week, the Senate proudly and 
unanimously 
passed 
a 
resolution 
awarding a Congressional Gold Medal 
to the U.S. Capitol Police along with 
other law enforcement personnel who 
helped defend this institution on Janu-
ary 6. 
Today, President Biden will sign this 
resolution into law, and the brave men 
and women who served that day will 
receive the highest honor that Con-
gress can bestow. 
With the home of our representative 
democracy literally under attack, the 
officers of the Capitol Police, their col-
leagues from the DC Metropolitan Po-
lice, and others made huge, huge sac-
rifices to keep all of us safe. 
On January 6, Congress got a first-
hand reminder of a reality that many 
American citizens face every day; that 
the brave men and women of law en-
forcement really are the thin blue line 
standing between peace and chaos. 
I am so proud we are adding our own 
colleagues in blue to the list of ex-
traordinary Americans that Congress 
has honored with its gold medal. 
So thank you and congratulations. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a completely different matter, 
we are more than a year from the tech-
nical end of the COVID–19 recession. 
There are more than 9 million job 
openings in the country, the most in 
American history by far. Three safe 
and effective vaccines are easily avail-
able all across our country, free of 
charge, for any adult who wants one. 
Medical contraindications are rare, and 
CDC data tell us that, once somebody 
is fully vaccinated, their risk of dying 
from COVID–19 absolutely plummets 
right down to the normal range of risk 
that we implicitly face on a daily basis. 
Vaccines may not magically eliminate 
the virus overnight, but the evidence 
tells us that vaccines can eliminate the 
degree to which the virus represents a 
unique crisis. 
We may not be entirely out of the 
woods—the Delta uptick makes that 
clear—but it is time to stop governing 
as if we were trapped in a permanent 
economic meltdown. It factually is 
simply not the case, but the Demo-
cratic Party’s far-left flank is resisting 
this simple fact. They were counting 
on this terrible but temporary pan-
demic to be their Trojan horse for per-
manent socialism. So they don’t want 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
vaccines 
are 
transitioning COVID from a crisis into 
a challenge—case in point, the surreal 
episode that has unfolded this past 
week over evictions. 
For a year and a half now, the gov-
ernment has basically told landlords 
they have little or no recourse if ten-
ants stop paying the rent. This isn’t 
just about massive corporations that 
some think could eat losses forever; 
family businesses who own one or two 
units have had to keep paying their 
bills, their taxes, and their mortgages 
the whole time. 
Congress already sent billions of dol-
lars to States for rental assistance. 
The problem is with State governments 
that have been pathetically slow to get 
the money out, but when some Social-
ist House Members fail to convince 
their own fellow Democrats to extend 
this nationwide socialism through leg-
islation, they somehow prevailed on 
President Biden through PR stunts— 
PR stunts. 
One day before the President’s an-
nouncement, his senior adviser said the 
President had ‘‘double-, triple-, quad-
ruple-checked’’ whether he had the 
legal authority to do this, and he con-
cluded he did not. The President him-
self admitted that legal scholars find 
his position untenable, but he still 
caved and did it. 
The far left wants to turn this ter-
rible but temporary pandemic into a 
Trojan horse for permanent socialism, 
and the administration is letting them 
call the shots. 
f 
DEBT LIMIT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
just a few days our colleagues will 
start ramming through yet another— 
another—reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree: trillions more in inflationary 
spending when families just want good 
jobs and stable prices. 
But there is something funny hap-
pening. Even as Democrats crow about 
how all this spending is so good and so 
needed, they are petrified to vote for 
the credit limit increase that would 
make it possible. 
The Democrats are about to tell Re-
publicans to go take a hike and start 
teeing up trillions more dollars in bor-
rowing and spending, of course, with-
out a single Republican vote. Ah, but 
at the same time, they are extolling 
the virtues of their latest socialist 
shopping list, they are afraid to up the 
limit on their credit card. They want 
Republicans to give them political 
cover for the partisan debt bomb that 
they will go right on to detonate with 
zero input from us. My colleagues are 
so mixed up on this, it is almost com-
ical. 
The sums that we borrowed and spent 
through 
2020—through 
last 
year, 
through 
the 
last 
administration, 
through the actual economic emer-
gency—were largely covered by the 
previous debt suspension that just ex-
pired, but Democrats want a new debt 
limit increase for the new borrowing 
and the new spending that they will-
fully piled up since they took power: 
about $2 trillion back in March, tril-
lions more sometime soon. 
So they want to unleash another 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
with zero Republican input—oh, oh— 
but when the bill comes, they say it is 
time to split the check. When the bill 
comes, it is time to split the check. 
Initiating another budget reconcili-
ation process in a 50–50 Senate is as 
willfully partisan, as ‘‘go it alone’’ as 
it gets, especially in a Senate that 
keeps proving we can do bipartisan 
work. 
So, look, if our colleagues want to 
ram through yet another reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree without our 
input, if they want all this spending 
and debt to be their signature legacy, 
they should leap at the chance to own 
every bit of it. 
So let me make something perfectly 
clear: If they don’t need or want our 
input, they won’t get our help. They 
won’t get our help with the debt limit 
increase that these reckless plans will 
require. I could not be more clear. 
They have the ability. They control 
the White House; they control the 
House; they control the Senate. They 
can raise the debt ceiling, and if it is 
raised, they will do it.

Mr.

Mr. 
President, 
now, on another matter, this week, 
Senate Republicans are saying goodbye 
to some all-star staffers. 
Nick Rossi, the chief of staff to our 
whip, Senator THUNE, has spent 15

Senate.

Harvard Law horsepower to steer of-
fices, committees, and our entire con-
ference in the right direction. Our whip

has had a whip-smart right-hand man. 
I won’t be able to top his boss’s won-
derful tribute remarks from yesterday, 
so I won’t even try, but I did just want 
to add my own brief thanks and con-
gratulations. 
I have gotten to see Nick’s great 
work up close. Senator THUNE and I 
have a standing Monday meeting to 
plan the week. It is a very small meet-
ing with very few staff. Nick has been 
in that room, and, every time, I have 
been glad he was. It is a rare thing in 
Washington to meet someone who is 
probably almost one of the smartest 
people in the room but who also never 
lets you know it, but Nick combines 
brilliance and humility in just that 
way. 
So my staff and I join Senator THUNE 
and the whole Senate in bidding Nick a 
fond, if reluctant, farewell. 
Thank you, sincerely, for your fine, 
fine service. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ANDREW FERGUSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on one final matter, when you 
have served in the Senate as long as I 
have, you get to hire and work with a 
lot of talented people, and when you 
find rock stars, you try to hang onto 
them. As a result, when a key staff 
member moves on, it often means re-
flecting on an extended Senate career 
of many years, including shared memo-
ries of old war stories going back ages. 
Andrew Ferguson is a different case. 
It was only 2 years ago that I hired 
Andrew to be my chief counsel. He has 
only been in the Senate about 3 years. 
By the standards of this place, he is a 
spring chicken. But it has only taken 
Andrew this short time to leave a stun-
ningly outsized imprint on my work, 
on our conference, on the judiciary, 
and on everyone who has gotten to 
work alongside of him as well. 
So, a few days before Andrew con-
cludes his Senate service, I am both 
happy for the opportunity to share how 
this happened and really, really sorry 
that I have to do it. 
The chief counsel in my leadership 
office handles a portfolio that is al-
most comically large: judicial con-
firmations, law enforcement and crime, 
immigration and border security, some 
constitutional questions that intersect 
with the separation of powers, others 
that intersect with national security, 
sometimes arcane Senate history. It 
takes a lawyer’s lawyer with expertise 
in our laws and Constitution and some-
one who can feel out the politics, the 
personalities, and the shades of gray 
that drive a political body. 
One look at Andrew’s resume told me 
that qualification No. 1 was, clearly, no 
problem—UVA Law; clerked on the DC 
Circuit; clerked for Justice Thomas; 
experience in the private sector—a law-
yer anybody would be glad to hire. 
Oh, but what about the second quali-
fication? 
Like I said, Andrew wasn’t a long- 
serving Senate hand. He arrived at Ju-
diciary in time to help Chairman 
GRASSLEY notch a win for the country 
and the sanity of the Senate with the 
confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh. He 
had only just been promoted to Chair-
man GRAHAM’s top nominations coun-
sel when I poached him. 
Well, Andrew stepped into this com-
plex role, and, boy, did he flourish. 
He became a go-to leader for commit-
tees and offices across the Republican 
side, a key Senate liaison to both the 
executive and judicial branches. He 
added to his lawyerly chops and grew 
into a strategic adviser of the first- 
rate. Our Republican conference is a 
big tent with a range of visions, but 
Senators from across the conference 
have come not just to trust Andrew’s 
judgment, but they seek it out. 
Andrew’s impact has been truly dra-
matic. I do not believe any other Sen-
ate staffer played a more crucial role 
in the last two Supreme Court con-
firmations combined. He was our side’s 
field general in confirming Justice Bar-
rett. Our majority spent 4 years re-
building the kind of Federal judiciary 
that our constitutional order requires. 
Andrew played an indispensable part. 
The last couple of years have brought 
all sorts of unusual national chal-
lenges. The 2 years that Andrew has 
spent with us feel more like 10. We 
faced scenarios that would have sound-
ed like wild law school hypotheticals. 
Who would have guessed we would be 
fighting to protect Americans’ reli-
gious freedom while the government 
battled an airborne virus? But our 
chief counsel invariably brought us up 
to speed on whatever the day would 
bring with a good head, a big heart, 
and great humor. And if the topic was 
new to him, a big stack of library 
books were on his desk. 
It might sound like Andrew was just 
very dedicated to his job. That is not 
totally unusual. But that doesn’t fully 
capture it. See, I have come to believe 
he is simply this intense about abso-
lutely everything. Andrew takes work 
very seriously, but he also takes his 
faith seriously, and he takes family se-
riously. He treasures the upbringing 
that his parents, Roy and Susan, pro-
vided for him and his two brothers. He 
takes his interests seriously, his hob-
bies. There is an intense, infectious en-
thusiasm for all of it, a kind of good- 
natured aggression. 
Now, as his colleagues will attest, all 
this intensity can yield, actually, en-
tertaining results. If, for example, you 
took a stroll by Andrew’s desk, you 
would often hear him shouting—shout-
ing—excitedly at a colleague, but you 
would generally genuinely have no clue 
whether he is strongly disagreeing with 
the person or just agreeing with them 
with great gusto. He could be dis-
cussing the law, but it might also be 
Roman history or the Protestant Ref-
ormation or the merits of some TV 
comedy or his weekend plans involving 
the lawful exercise of his Second 
Amendment rights. Whatever the sub-
ject, you would get maximum enthu-
siasm, maximum force of nature, and 
everybody in earshot usually learns 
some new fact and shares a big laugh. 
Different people enjoy this line of 
work for different reasons, but for An-
drew, I think politics and policy mat-
ter so much because ideas and prin-
ciples matter so much. That is why one 
of the most darkly funny and cynical 
people on our team has also been one of 
the most earnest and idealistic. Every-
thing is worth thinking through. Ev-
erything is worth taking seriously be-
cause principles matter, the rule of law 
matters, and our country matters. 
That is why we come to work every 
day. 
A lot of people first come to Wash-
ington with a warrior mentality, but 
the rhythms of this city sometimes lull 
folks into a somewhat calmer mixture. 
But, believe me, as I suspect the entire 
Senate can attest by now, we need not 
worry that Andrew Ferguson will be 
lulled into a calmer anything. 
So, my friend, you may be leaving 
the trenches for now, but we both know 
there is no chance you will be able to 
stay away forever. You are going to 
miss the good fight, and I can say with 
personal certainty that the fight is 
going to miss you as well. Thank you 
for the law lectures. Thank you for the 
laughs. Thank you for an outstanding 
job for our country. Job well done.

NOMINATION OF EUNICE C. LEE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week the Senate will vote on Eunice 
Lee’s nomination to serve on the Sec-
ond Circuit Court of Appeals. If con-
firmed, Ms. Lee would be the only—the 
only 
Black 
woman—and 
the 
only 
former public defender to serve on the 
Second Circuit. With her nomination,

August 5, 2021 
to build a Federal judiciary that looks 
like America. 
I would like to take a moment or two 
to discuss Ms. Lee’s qualifications and 
what she will bring to the bench—a 
perspective that is sorely needed. 
Ms. Lee has dedicated her entire 
legal career to public defense work, 
most recently as an assistant Federal 
public defender with the Federal De-
fenders of New York. 
Graduating from Ohio State Univer-
sity and Yale Law School, Ms. Lee 
began her legal career clerking with 
the Southern District of Ohio and then 
with the Sixth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. 
She then joined New York’s Office of 
the Appellate Defender, where she 
spent more than 20 years advocating 
for indigent criminal defendants at all 
levels of the New York State court sys-
tem. During that time, Ms. Lee taught 
and mentored a new generation of law-
yers when she served as an adjunct as-
sistant professor of clinical law at New 
York University. 
She then joined the Federal Defend-
ers of New York, where she has briefed 
and argued criminal appeals in the Sec-
ond Circuit, the court to which she is 
now nominated. 
In short, Ms. Lee has dedicated her 
entire life to upholding the Sixth 
Amendment right to counsel, rep-
resenting defendants who cannot afford 
to hire a lawyer. 
Now, some of my Republican col-
leagues have claimed, without any evi-
dence, that, as a former Federal public 
defender, Ms. Lee would be biased as a 
judge in favor of defendants. It is curi-
ous to me that these concerns of her 
bias didn’t seem to crop up over the 
decades when former prosecutors were 
nominated to the Federal bench, and 
for good reason. It is as flimsy an argu-
ment as it is offensive to the lawyers 
who represent defendants—a represen-
tation mandated under the Constitu-
tion. 
Let’s be clear: Both prosecutors and 
public defenders play essential roles in 
our justice system, and their jobs give 
them extensive courtroom experience, 
which is something we demand of all 
judges. 
Additionally, Ms. Lee has made it 
clear she understands the difference be-
tween being a lawyer and a judge. As a 
lawyer, she is an advocate; as a judge, 
an arbiter. At her hearing before the 
Judiciary Committee, Ms. Lee ex-
plained 
that 
she 
‘‘critically 
recognize[s] the importance of [being] a 
fair decision-maker.’’ 
What is more, 70 former prosecu-
tors—those are the women and men sit-
ting at the other table in the court-
room—in the Southern and Eastern 
Districts of New York, the very pros-
ecutors that she squared off with in the 
courtrooms, have stressed the impor-
tance of having her perspective as a 
public defender represented on the Sec-
ond Circuit. 
In a letter to the Judiciary Com-
mittee, these prosecutors wrote: ‘‘[W]e 
enthusiastically support Ms. Lee not 
just because of her sterling credentials. 
We believe that after a career as a pub-
lic defender serving indigent clients in 
criminal cases, Ms. Lee would bring a 
unique and under-represented perspec-
tive to the job of hearing and deciding 
federal appeals.’’ 
Then they added that Ms. Lee was 
‘‘an incredibly talented lawyer and 
public 
servant, 
whose 
career 
rep-
resenting the most vulnerable among 
us will bring a critical, unique perspec-
tive to the bench.’’ 
Finally, I want to share a passage 
from a recent op-ed written by Clark 
Neily, a scholar at the Cato Institute, 
and Devi Rao, a counsel at the Mac-
Arthur Justice Center. 
They wrote: ‘‘Judges with a greater 
diversity of professional experience 
would improve judicial decision-mak-
ing overall. A judiciary with members 
whose formative professional experi-
ences span the legal profession will be 
best equipped to handle the diverse 
range of cases and issues presented to 
them.’’ 
Legal experts across the ideological 
spectrum agree. Professional diversity 
on the Federal bench is beneficial to 
our system of justice. 
With Eunice Lee’s confirmation, this 
Senate can continue bringing balance 
to our Nation’s courts and elevate a 
professional 
perspective 
severely 
underrepresented today. I will vote for 
Ms. Lee’s nomination, and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Let me just add in closing, I want to 
thank the Members of the Senate, both 
political parties, for proposing nomi-
nees to the Biden White House for con-
sideration for lifetime appointments to 
the 
Federal 
judiciary. 
They 
have 
brought those nominations to the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, where I chair 
the proceedings, and it is remarkable. 
The women and men who have come to 
us, prepared to serve, make a lifetime 
commitment to serve our Federal judi-
ciary. 
The diversity in that group is amaz-
ing, remarkable, and the quality is 
without exception. Nearly all of them 
have been found at least ‘‘well quali-
fied’’ unanimously by the American 
Bar Association—in many cases, and 
certainly in others, very positive re-
ports as well. 
I want to continue bringing these 
women and men to the floor of the Sen-
ate. I pleaded even this morning with 
the majority leader, Senator SCHUMER, 
who has the toughest job in the world 
of trying to move all the things we 
want to do onto this calendar and off 
again. I thank him for his cooperation. 
I would like to say a few words on a 
separate topic. 
EVICTION MORATORIUM 
Mr. President, I listened carefully to 
the Senate Republican leader this 
morning, Senator MCCONNELL. I strug-
gle to understand one aspect of his 
speech. He referred to the notion of 
helping those who are facing eviction 
as some form of socialism. 
What we are doing, of course, is try-
ing to make certain that all of these 
people have a roof over their heads, and 
some of them are going through ex-
traordinarily difficult economic chal-
lenges and extraordinarily difficult 
public health challenges. 
The money that we are sending their 
way is not just for them, obviously, but 
also to benefit the landlords, the people 
who own the property that they oc-
cupy. 
Now, that is not unusual for this 
Congress in the midst of this pandemic 
to step up and help small businesses 
like landlords who are trying to pay 
their mortgages during this difficult 
time when they have tenants who are 
going through economic distress. I 
don’t think that is socialism. 
It wasn’t socialism when we created 
the PPP program in 2020 on a bipar-
tisan basis, with recordbreaking sums 
of money, to give to small businesses 
to help them through the treacherous 
times of this pandemic. It was just 
common sense. Our economy was tak-
ing a hit, and they were too. 
We wanted the day to come when we 
could deal with this pandemic effec-
tively and also that they could return 
to their businesses. Was that socialism, 
that we would have that kind of an ef-
fort? I don’t think so. 
As a matter of fact, when it came to 
passing that legislation, it was bipar-
tisan and virtually unanimous—Presi-
dent Trump supporting it as well as 
Speaker PELOSI when it all came to 
pass. I mean, that is an indication of 
bridging the vast political differences 
in this country when an emergency de-
manded it. I don’t think that is social-
ism. 
When it comes to those tenants who 
are struggling to get by in these dif-
ficult times, helping them and the 
landlords whose property they occupy 
is not socialism; it is what America is 
all about. It is, of course, an involve-
ment of the government, and we all 
voted for that, but it is in a specific 
context of helping people. 
What the President has now proposed 
beyond this infrastructure bill that we 
are facing is that we look to other as-
pects of family life where we can help 
families cut the cost of the basics that 
they face, whether it is childcare or 
sending a child to college. 
I don’t think it is socialistic to say 
we want 2 additional years of education 
for the graduates of high school in 
America so they are prepared to com-
pete in the 21st century. That is just 
common sense. Socialism? I don’t be-
lieve it is even close to socialism. It is 
really preparing them for a competi-
tive, entrepreneurial economy and for 
success in life. That, to me, is a noble 
goal, whatever party is behind it. 
When it comes to the debt ceiling of 
this country, I just hope we can find a 
way to deal with this responsibly. It 
has always been a political football, de-
pending on which party was in power, 
but to risk the possibility of a default 
on America’s debt at this moment in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5896 
August 5, 2021 
our economic history is a dangerous, 
dangerous undertaking. We need to do 
the right thing. We have to concede the 
obvious. 
Certainly the previous President, 
Trump, didn’t win any accolades for 
fiscal conservatism. And we have to 
come together to recognize, whoever 
the President may be, the important 
thing is that this Nation move for-
ward—move forward to our cures for 
the illnesses that we face but also to an 
economy that is expanded. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. CARPER. Before the Democratic 
whip leaves the floor, I just want to 
thank him for raising the three words 
‘‘Ohio State University.’’ As a proud 
Buckeye for—— 
Mr. DURBIN. The Ohio State—— 
Mr. CARPER. No, I never say ‘‘The 
Ohio State.’’ We want to be humble. 
But I used to be a Navy ROTC mid-
shipman there for a number of years 
and have great memories of being a 
part of the student body there and part 
of the Navy ROTC unit. 
Later, I had the opportunity, as my 
colleague knows, to join forces in the 
U.S. House of Representatives in 1982— 
one of the largest freshman classes 
ever. It seems like yesterday. He went 
on to come and serve in the Senate, 
and I went on to serve as Governor. 
One of the things I never thought 
about as Governor is the job of the 
Governor to nominate people to serve 
on the courts. I never thought about 
that. 
As it turns out, in Delaware, given 
the positions we have in corporate law 
and other parts of our economy and 
business, judicial appointments are 
over-sized. They are really extremely 
important. 
And while I hadn’t given it a lot of 
thought, I remember I had, I think, 45 
joint appearances with my Republican 
opponent when I ran for Governor—45 
in the year 1992, and not once did any-
body ever ask of either of us: What 
would you look for in nominating 
judges? 
It turned out to be hugely important. 
I studied economics and got an MBA, 
but I don’t pretend to be an expert on 
legal matters. One of the things that I 
learned—and I felt it was important— 
was to have a judiciary that was di-
verse and that looked like Delaware. I 
think the same is true here for our 
country for district court judges, ap-
peals courts, and the Supreme Court. 
I wanted to nominate people who 
were bright and who were smart, and 
intellectually curious. I wanted to 
nominate people who were hard work-
ing, who brought a diversity of experi-
ences to the bench. And mostly, I 
wanted to nominate people who were 
able to make good decisions—even 
tough decisions—and were fair and 
treated everybody in their court before 
them with fairness. 
The reputation of the nominee whom 
you referred to, I think she checks all 
those boxes, and I want to thank you 
for raising her before us here today. 
Thank you. 
We have our colleague from Lou-
isiana here with us today. He has 
worked hard, along with 21 of our col-
leagues, to try to fashion a bipartisan 
consensus to build on the work of, 
among others, the Environment and 
Public Works Committee on infrastruc-
ture. 
We worked hard in our committee— 
SHELLEY CAPITO, the lead Republican, 
and myself, and 18 others—to report 
and later to vote on legislation on 
water infrastructure here, drinking 
water and wastewater sanitation legis-
lation. We voted on it a couple months 
ago after reporting it unanimously out 
of committee. And 89 to 2, the same bill 
came up here—89 to 2. And we have 
used that as one of the building blocks 
on which the bipartisan infrastructure 
package is fashioned. 
We also have in the Environment and 
Public Works Committee the great 
support and leadership of our ranking 
member, Senator CAPITO, and the par-
ticipation of every single U.S. Senator 
who gathered input to help us fashion 
legislation in the Committee on water, 
drinking water, wastewater, and roads, 
highways, bridges, and climate, in 
order to be able to put together a foun-
dation, if you will, under which the 
Gang of—we affectionately call it the 
Gang of 22—have built this infrastruc-
ture piece along with the help of the 
administration and a lot of other folks 
who participated. 
I go back and forth on the train. I lit-
erally went home last night to Dela-
ware and was back here this morning. 
I am a bit weary, but I was encouraged. 
So many times over the years, people 
say to me, as I am waiting to catch a 
train in Wilmington or waiting to 
catch a train back home at the end of 
the day—people say to me: Why can’t 
you guys just work together? Why 
can’t you just work to get stuff done 
for this country? 
I think they would be encouraged by 
what they would have seen and the 
work of not just the Environment and 
Public Works Committee but the work 
of the Commerce Committee, the work 
of the Banking Committee, and the 
work of the Energy and Natural Re-
sources 
Committee—rather 
extraor-
dinary, every one of them. Democrats, 
Republicans, a couple of Independents 
are all working together to fashion leg-
islation that is going to help strength-
en our economy and make our economy 
work better and help provide employ-
ment opportunities to literally mil-
lions of people at a time when we need 
that. 
And, yesterday, I think we had the 
votes. Correct me if I am wrong. But 
more than a dozen votes we have had 
this week, and more than a score of 
votes on amendments to this package— 
this infrastructure package. One of the 
things I love about it is that a bunch of 
those amendments were bipartisan. It 
wasn’t just Democratic amendments or 
Republican amendments. They were 
amendments we offered together. 
And interestingly enough, we had 
any number of instances yesterday, in-
cluding late last night, when we didn’t 
have long, dragged out debate. We ac-
tually voice-voted a number of provi-
sions that were being offered to us. The 
amendments were being offered. I am 
encouraged by that. 
And I note that, tomorrow morning, 
a lot of us—I am not sure how many, 
but maybe a third of the U.S. Senate, 
will join together and get on a plane— 
I think an Air Force plane—and we will 
head for Gillette, WY, to say good- 
bye—say good-bye to a dear friend, and 
that is Mike Enzi. 
I spoke about him on the floor in the 
last week. So I will be brief right here. 
Mike Enzi would love what we are 
doing. He would have loved to have 
been a part of this. He was the guy who 
first taught me about the 80–20 rule. 
The 80–20 rule—when I asked him how 
Mike Enzi, one of the most conserv-
ative Republicans we had here in the 
Senate, and Ted Kennedy, one of the 
most liberal Senators we had here in 
the United States, how could they 
work together on the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
and get so much done—and get so much 
done? 
I will never forget what he said. He 
gave a speech on the floor here when I 
was presiding as a brandnew freshman 
Senator, years ago—20 years ago. He 
spoke of the 80–20 rule, and I asked him 
when he finished speaking: What is the 
80–20 rule? 
And he said: It is the secret to Ted 
Kennedy and I being successful in the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee—being so successful 
in taking on legislation and coming up 
with principled, bipartisan solutions. 
And he said: Ted and I agree on 80 
percent of the issues that come before 
our committee. We disagree on maybe 
20 percent. And what we do on the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee is we focus on the 80 
percent where we agree, and we set 
aside the 20 percent where we don’t 
agree to another day. We come back to 
it, and we deal with that later on. 
And it worked for them. 
He would be delighted. My guess is he 
is tuned in today, somewhere up there. 
But he would be delighted to see that 
this week the 80–20 rule that Mike Enzi 
epitomized is alive and well on both 
sides of the aisle. I hope that the spirit 
that has infused our work, leading up 
to the work of our committees—the 
committees of jurisdiction—providing 
the foundation on which the gang of 20 
and the administration went to work— 
my hope is that that spirit of biparti-
sanship and Mike Enzi’s 80–20 rule will 
continue to infuse our work here this 
week into the latter part of this 
evening, and, hopefully, not too late 
into the evening. Maybe we can wrap 
things up here in short order. 
With that, I am going to yield the 
floor, and I just want to say to every-
one who is working hard to make this

S5897 
August 5, 2021 
a productive week, a productive mis-
sion: I just want to say a real thank 
you, not just to the members of the rel-
evant committees I mentioned but to 
everybody, all the folks who serve here, 
and especially our staff. 
I like to say that people ask me 
sometimes—and I say this to my friend 
Senator CASSIDY from Louisiana, who 
is a truly brilliant person and a great 
colleague to work with. I would like to 
say that about Senator THUNE, with 
whom I will be joining in a Bible study 
later again today as we join with the 
Chaplain every day. There are a lot 
smarter people in the U.S. Senate than 
me, but I am smart enough to hire 
really smart people. They work hard 
and I work hard, and most days we get 
a lot done. 
For all the staff here in this body and 
in this building and the committee 
staff out across the Capitol and around 
the world, we especially thank you for 
your efforts. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
REMEMBERING MIKE ENZI 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to 
associate myself with the comments of 
my colleague from Delaware with re-
spect to Senator Enzi. He is absolutely 
right. Senator Enzi, who will be laid to 
rest in Wyoming, was a wonderful pub-
lic servant and someone who there 
weren’t any pretensions about him. He 
was a ‘‘what you see is what you get’’ 
type 
of 
individual, 
somebody 
who 
worked hard every day, was solutions- 
oriented, results-oriented, and brought 
with him a humble spirit and demeanor 
that we all benefited from here, and 
something that I think all of us could 
aspire to here as well. 
And I was reminded as my colleague 
from Delaware was speaking, of a verse 
in the Old Testament Book of Micah, 
where it says: 
He has told you, old man, what is good. 
And what does the Lord require of you but to 
do justice, to love kindness, and to walk 
humbly with your God. 
And I think that certainly describes 
Senator Mike Enzi. And we think 
about him and his family and keep 
them in our prayers as they prepare for 
that ceremony tomorrow. 
BROADBAND 
Mr. President, as a Senator from a 
rural State and a member and former 
chairman of the Senate Commerce 
Committee, expanding broadband ac-
cess to rural areas has long been a pri-
ority of mine. Given our economy’s in-
creasing reliance on broadband in the 
digital age, it makes sense, as part of 
this infrastructure bill, that we are 
prioritizing expanding broadband ac-
cess to unserved areas. 
But I have to say I am concerned, be-
cause a lot of the money allocated for 
expanding access—more than $42 bil-
lion—would be funneled not through 
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion, where the majority of the Govern-
ment’s broadband experience resides, 
but through the Commerce Depart-
ment’s National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration, or 
NTIA, which has previously fumbled 
attempts to bring broadband access to 
more communities. 
Back in 2009, a government stimulus 
bill allocated $4.7 billion to NTIA to 
expand broadband access in rural and 
underserved areas. It didn’t go very 
well. The Agency struggled with imple-
mentation. There were serious issues 
with a number of the projects the 
Agency approved. In fact, 14 projects 
were either temporarily or perma-
nently halted. 
Other projects resulted in a signifi-
cant amount of overbuilding, meaning 
that they resulted in the construction 
of additional broadband infrastructure 
in areas that already had access to reli-
able broadband. A Government Ac-
countability Office report found that 
the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration lacked the 
data it needed to determine whether 
areas were genuinely underserved. 
More recently, just last month, the 
NTIA called for ‘‘volunteers’’—volun-
teers—to 
evaluate 
grant 
proposals. 
That is right. The NTIA has called for 
volunteers to help determine how to al-
locate the $1.5 billion Congress has pro-
vided to NTIA over the past year to im-
prove broadband access. 
Now, we should think long and hard 
before giving the Agency the authority 
to administer more than $42 billion in 
grants when it has to call on volun-
teers to help allocate a tiny fraction of 
that money. 
NTIA simply has not demonstrated 
its ability to administer a grant pro-
gram of this size and complexity. A 
much better alternative would be to 
put the Federal Communications Com-
mission 
in 
charge 
of 
disbursing 
broadband funds. 
In contrast to NTIA which has just 
157 employees, the Federal Commu-
nications Commission employs more 
than 1,400 people. It has the staffing re-
sources it needs in-house to administer 
this grant program. The FCC also, cru-
cially, has the necessary expertise to 
identify truly unserved areas so that 
Federal dollars go to communities with 
the most significant lack of broadband 
access. 
I have proposed an amendment to the 
infrastructure legislation before us 
that would strike the NTIA grant pro-
gram and redirect that money to the 
bipartisan legislation I have intro-
duced—the 
Rural 
Connectivity 
Ad-
vancement Program Act. 
The Rural Connectivity Advance-
ment Program Act would mandate that 
10-percent of the net proceeds of any 
spectrum auctions mandated by the 
Federal Government go to building out 
broadband networks with the goal of 
strengthening connectivity in rural 
and Tribal areas. Redirecting the pro-
posed $42 billion in grants to this pro-
gram would allow the Federal Commu-
nications Commission to administer 
these funds, which would make it more 
likely that this funding would actually 
go to meet the broadband needs of 
unserved communities. 
On a related note, I have also intro-
duced an amendment to strike a provi-
sion of the infrastructure bill that 
would allow NTIA to make changes to 
the formula that Congress is providing 
to determine what areas of the country 
are eligible for grants. 
Why is Congress bothering to put 
funding guardrails in this legislation if 
it is going to allow the NTIA to change 
them at will? 
As I have said, NTIA lacks adequate 
expertise when it comes to identifying 
what areas of the country are truly 
unserved. And I am not sure why we 
give NTIA the authority to change 
Congress’s guidelines and possibly fur-
ther diminish the chances that this 
grant program will deliver on its objec-
tive. 
Unfortunately, just yesterday, the 
Senate voted down an amendment of-
fered by the ranking member of the 
Commerce Committee that would have 
provided 
critical 
safeguards 
should 
NTIA establish this program. The pro-
ponents of this legislation have report-
edly received assurances from the Sec-
retary of Commerce about how NTIA 
will implement the bill. 
If this bill is enacted, the Secretary 
should expect close scrutiny from the 
Commerce Committee and be prepared 
to explain how she will prevent a re-
peat of the Agency’s past missteps. As 
I said, there have been problems in the 
past with government broadband dol-
lars going to overbuilding of broadband 
in areas that already have a substan-
tial amount of access, and I am con-
cerned that this bill could result in the 
same problem. 
In addition to the NTIA grant pro-
gram, the infrastructure bill would au-
thorize the Department of Agriculture 
to improve grant funding of areas 
where 50 percent of the homes lack ade-
quate access to broadband services. 
While this may sound like an appro-
priate percentage, the truth is that a 
grant for building out broadband in an 
area where 50 percent of the homes al-
ready have adequate access is likely to 
result in significant overbuilding at 
taxpayer expense. 
We seem to have forgotten that Fed-
eral resources are—or at least should 
be—limited. There are plenty of areas 
where broadband access is almost non-
existent and where there is almost no 
available broadband infrastructure to 
build on. And those are the first places 
where we need to direct available gov-
ernment funding, which is why I am of-
fering an amendment to change the 
formula 
to 
require 
that 
proposed 
grants cover an area where at least 80 
percent of homes lack broadband ac-
cess. This bipartisan amendment de-
serves a vote. 
I am also concerned that we are ad-
vancing this bill without any of the 
provisions, particularly the broadband 
components, going through regular 
committee consideration. The Com-
merce Committee has a long history of

advancing legislation to expand access 
to broadband services. Rushed legisla-
tive efforts that bypass the committees 
of jurisdiction and the subject matter 
expertise that they offer could lead to 
billions of dollars being spent with lit-
tle to show. 
I am appreciative of the efforts of the 
bipartisan negotiators who crafted this 
bill. I know they share my goal of tar-
geting broadband resources to those 
most in need. I am very pleased that 
my Telecommunications Skilled Work-
force Act amendment received a vote 
the other day and passed the Senate by 
an overwhelmingly bipartisan margin. 
This amendment would help ensure 
that we develop the workforce nec-
essary to meet the demands of the next 
generation of mobile broadband inter-
net, 5G. 
But I hope—I hope—that we will also 
have a chance to vote on my other 
amendments—those I just mentioned— 
and amendments being offered by my 
colleagues. Infrastructure legislation is 
tremendously important to our econ-
omy, and we need to take the time to 
get this legislation right. And that 
means giving Senators, who are not 
part of the working group, adequate 
time to offer amendments and, hope-
fully, improve this product. We have 
made some progress on that front this 
week, and I hope to make more before 
finishing this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MARK KELLY MAIDEN SPEECH 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I just 
want to say, earlier this week—I am al-
most at a loss for words. I know I nor-
mally am not standing where I nor-
mally stand. 
Earlier this week, you gave your 
freshman year first speech—your first 
speech—and not everybody was able to 
hear it. A lot of people came up. Demo-
crats and Republicans were here. I just 
want to say again how much I enjoyed 
it. 
From an old Navy guy to a not-so-old 
Navy guy, we are very proud of your 
service in uniform and also proud of 
your service here. I am delighted that 
you are a member of our Environment 
and Public Works Committee. We have 
done some really good work on this 
issue. I thank you for your help and 
contribution. 
DISPARITY STUDIES 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have a 
couple of unanimous consent requests. 
I ask unanimous consent to have print-
ed in the RECORD a list of studies pre-
senting a strong basis of evidence for 
the 
conclusion 
that 
discrimination 
against minority- and women-owned 
businesses continues to affect the con-
struction, architecture, and engineer-
ing and related surface transportation 
contracting markets nationwide. 
These disparity studies contain rig-
orous statistical analyses to determine 
whether business discrimination based 
on—whether it is based upon race or 
gender, continues to exist, and a review 
of these studies reveals that the an-
swer, sadly, is a resounding yes, and, 
therefore, the current Disadvantaged 
Business Enterprise provisions are still 
warranted. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD 
those disparity studies. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have a 
second unanimous consent request I 
want to mention, and that is a request 
to have printed in the RECORD letters 
of support for electric school buses. 
I would ask unanimous consent to 
have printed in the RECORD two let-
ters—one from three American school 
bus manufacturers, and another from 
125 nonprofit foundations, businesses, 
health and scientific organizations, and 
advocacy groups—in support of invest-
ments in electric school buses in this 
bipartisan package. 
Both letters highlight the fact that 
no other school bus technology manu-
factured today reduces more emissions 
than electric vehicle school buses; and 
both letters highlight that investments 
in electric school buses would drive the 
demand for new electric buses and pro-
mote cost parity between electric 
school buses and older technologies. 
The 
message 
from 
these 
diverse 
groups to Congress is clear: Investing 
in electric school buses supports Amer-
ican workers and American manufac-
turers. Not only that, it cleans up our 
air, protects our kids and our planet on 
which we live.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5900 
August 5, 2021 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JULY 27, 2021. 
Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER AND MI-
NORITY LEADER MCCONNELL: We are writing 
to urge funding for a transition to electric 
school buses as part of the bipartisan infra-
structure package being developed on Cap-
itol Hill. 
Over the past 15 years much has been ac-
complished in reducing emissions from older 
school buses using the Diesel Emission Re-
duction Act of 2005. Newer buses are avail-
able 
with 
propane, 
CNG 
and 
electric 
powertrains which reduce emissions by as 
much as 100 percent compared with school 
buses manufactured prior to the enactment 
of DERA. 
The focus of these programs has been in re-
ducing emissions of priority pollutants like 
nitrogen oxides (NOX) and particulate matter 
(PM) but today there is serious concern 
about carbon emissions. These have not been 
the focus of earlier programs. We believe the 
technology that provides the best oppor-
tunity to achieve both clean air and carbon 
reduction is electric vehicle technology. 
School buses are an ideal platform for elec-
tric drive because they have a duty cycle 
that is highly compatible with electrifica-
tion, they start and end the day at the same 
location (simplifies charging infrastructure 
needs), and enjoy a design that allows for in-
stallation of large battery packs. They do 
not have range issues as they drive daily the 
same well-established routes that are well 
within the battery capacity available on the 
bus. Electric school buses have been in daily 
use since 2015, accumulating millions of 
miles. They are reliably and dependably de-
ployed in school districts across the country 
and we as manufacturers and end users of 
them can affirm that we are ready to meet 
the increased demand. This technology is 
here and ready to go. 
Electric school buses are being rapidly in-
troduced but remain more expensive than 
even some of the other clean vehicle options. 
Manufacturers believe that a major Federal 
investment will assist in driving down the 
cost through economies of scale that result 
from high volume manufacture. Such an in-
vestment would make electric school buses 
cost competitive with other platforms in al-
lowing greater adoption of a technology that 
achieves zero emissions of harmful pollut-
ants and greenhouse gases. 
In addition to the health and climate bene-
fits for school children and their commu-
nities, it would also create many well-paying 
domestic 
jobs 
in 
engineering, 
manufac-
turing, and sales. 
Accordingly, we believe that Congress 
should include substantial Federal funding 
for clean school buses and that not less than 
half of that funding should go exclusively to 
electric buses. We understand that some 
communities want to use older technologies. 
If Congress decides to make some portion of 
funding available for these older tech-
nologies, we strongly support making it 
available for electric buses as well and its re-
lated infrastructure to allow for the fastest 
possible deployment of zero emission vehicle 
technology. 
Sincerely, 
BLUE BIRD CORPORATION. 
IC BUS, A NAVISTAR 
COMPANY. 
THOMAS BUILT BUSES. 
JULY 27, 2021. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER AND MI-
NORITY LEADER MCCONNELL: We, the under-
signed organizations, representing millions 
of members and companies, strongly support 
ensuring that the full $7.5 billion in school 
bus funding goes towards school districts to 
purchase electric school buses and install the 
necessary charging infrastructure, as laid 
out in the memo by Brian Deese explaining 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework. 
The 475,000 school buses that carry 25 million 
children to school every day are some of the 
oldest technology on the road. Due to their 
short routes, school buses are frequently on 
the road for 15–20 years. Diesel exhaust is a 
known carcinogen which directly and dis-
proportionately impacts the kids and drivers 
of these buses. Reduced pollution from bus 
emissions 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
decrease 
incidences of asthma, bronchitis, and pneu-
monia 
and 
also 
decreases 
absenteeism. 
Eliminating emissions from buses should 
have even stronger effects. 
Fortunately, electric school buses are 
available from several domestic manufactur-
ers and are being integrated into school bus 
fleets across the country. The significant in-
vestment that the government is planning to 
make in school buses is critical and 100% of 
this funding should be spent to help school 
districts to acquire these zero emission tech-
nologies. We particularly support ensuring 
that communities most impacted by air pol-
lution are prioritized in the application proc-
ess. 
We oppose any funding going to fossil fuel 
buses as these buses do not eliminate tail-
pipe pollution, CNG and propane buses are 
already cost competitive with diesel, and all 
new buses purchased today will be on the 
road for 15–20 years, thus ensuring long term 
dependence on fossil fuels. The news story 
that broke last night shows that the bipar-
tisan group of Senators working on this leg-
islation is planning to use half of the school 
bus money to buy new fossil fuel buses for 
school districts, which undermines our cli-
mate goals and doesn’t support the growth of 
the domestic EV bus industry. As the cli-
mate crisis is worsening, and our kids are 
breathing polluted air, we need to rapidly 
transition to electric buses. The govern-
ment’s role is to help in that transition. 
Even allowing one third of these funds to 
purchase buses that run on CNG, propane, 
and biofuels (which are blended in small vol-
umes into gasoline and diesel) would lock in 
up to 7.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emis-
sions, up to 88 billion pounds of carbon mon-
oxide pollution, and up to 12.5 million pounds 
of NOX, not to mention installing fueling in-
frastructure that will be stranded assets as 
these school districts move to electrification 
down the road. 
Please ensure that all federal funding for 
school buses is for electric buses that will 
both mitigate climate change and reduce 
dangerous air pollution. We have an oppor-
tunity to invest in a domestic industry, pro-
mote more good-paying jobs, train more 
workers to be on the cutting edge of trans-
portation technologies, and reduce asthma 
attacks and other respiratory ailments for 
our nation’s school children. We sincerely 
hope that Congress seizes this chance to 
make a difference and puts $7.5 billion into 
electric school buses.

Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would 
like to point out I like to work out. I 
showed up at Pensacola at the age of 21

Navy as a midshipman. Before they put 
us in airplanes, as you may recall, they

conditioning. So I worked out, like, 6, 
7 days a week then, and I come pretty 
close to that today. 
And a couple of days a week I like to 
run. I always like to run outside. And 
all this work we were doing this last 
week—we were doing a lot of work not 
only on the Senate floor, but behind 
the scenes on electric school buses, to 
make sure that we would be able to 
provide funding for a lot of them going 
forward. 
And one morning, I went out run-
ning, and it was still almost dark, and 
I was almost run over by two electric 
buses, and I said: Don’t worry, I am on 
your side. And I had a nice chat with a 
couple of drivers. 
So I came here to present this mes-
sage and these unanimous consent re-
quests today. 
I also wanted to say that we did get 
to work yesterday—Democrats and Re-
publicans working together. A bunch of 
amendments were adopted; one or two 
not. But it was a good spirit last night, 
well into the night, and good work has 
been 
done 
and 
has 
continued 
in 
through the evening and again this 
morning on both sides of the aisle to 
find some additional compromises. 
I am told that several amendments 
are ready to be brought to the floor. I 
would just say to my colleagues: Bring 
them. If you got something you think 
is ready for prime time, whether it is 
Democrat or Republican, and it is a 
combined bipartisan amendment, bring 
it. Let’s hear about it. Let’s have a 
chance to discuss it and to vote on it. 
We could be up late into the night. 
We are going to be up really early in 
the morning. I think there is a 7 
o’clock flight, maybe out of Andrews. 
At least we leave from here to Andrews 
to go catch a 7 o’clock flight to attend 
the memorial service for Senator Enzi 
in Wyoming tomorrow. 
I think we would be smart not to 
stay up half the night, and do as much 
as we can this morning, and then—oh, 
it is noon, high noon. Get started now. 
I think we will be glad that we did. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD TRUMKA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise 
today with some sad, some horrible 
news about the passing of a great 
friend, Rich Trumka, who left us this 
morning. 
The working people of America have 
lost a fierce warrior at a time when we 
needed him most. Just yesterday, Rich 
was lending his support to the striking 
miners in Alabama. 
Following in his father’s footsteps, 
he worked in the mines. He went to 
Penn State, earned his law degree. He 
didn’t practice. He didn’t go to some 
fancy place. He went right to work for 
the United Mine Workers, which he 
lead for so many years, and then he be-
came head—first, secretary-treasurer— 
of the AFL–CIO. 
He had in his veins and every atom of 
his body the heart, the thoughts, the 
needs of the working people of Amer-
ica. He was them. Rich Trumka was 
the working people of America. He 
never had any airs. He never put it on, 
and he cared about his fellow workers 
so. 
He was a great leader. He knew that 
the labor movement and working peo-
ple had to expand and be diverse. One 
of his passions as a labor leader was 
immigration reform, which I talked to 
him about repeatedly because they 
were working people, too, no matter 
where they came from or what they 
looked like. 
It is just horrible news. I will have 
more to say about it later, but I want-
ed to inform my colleagues that we 
have just lost a giant, and we need him 
so. 
We will remember him forever, and 
his memory will, I know, importune all 
of us to do more, even more, for the 
working people of America, who Rich 
Trumka so dearly and deeply loved. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
just wanted to lend words and support 
to what Majority Leader SCHUMER just 
said about Rich Trumka. 
I send my prayers and love to Bar-
bara, his family, and everyone in the 
labor movement. 
What a strong, vibrant, committed 
leader. We have worked together on so 
many different issues, and it was al-
ways about: Is this going to create 
good-paying jobs? Are workers going to 
be able to have their voice in the work-
place? Is their standard of living going 
to increase? What are we doing for 
folks? Are we bringing jobs home? Are 
we creating jobs here? What are we 
doing for the backbone of our country, 
which are working men and women? 
So I just want to indicate my pro-
found sadness and shock and my love 
and support for all of those who I know 
are very sad and grieving at this mo-
ment. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to highlight an important com-
ponent of the bipartisan infrastructure 
legislation that we are now debating. 
This legislation includes new invest-
ments that will help communities in 
Michigan and across the country ad-
dress the serious risk posed by severe 
flooding, shoreline erosion, and other 
natural disasters. 
As a result of climate change, we are 
continuing to experience an increase in 
the frequency and intensity of severe 
weather events. In June, Southeast 
Michigan faced yet another severe 
flooding event that, tragically, led to 
two deaths, damaged small businesses 
and thousands of homes, and dev-
astated families. 
The Federal Government has spent 
many billions of dollars to help respond 
to and recover from disasters. However, 
until very recently, we chronically 
underinvested in mitigating the effects 
of disasters before they occur, despite 
the fact that it protects lives, safe-
guards property, and saves taxpayer 
dollars. In fact, studies show that 
every dollar invested in hazard mitiga-
tion or prevention saves as much as $6 
for the taxpayers. 
This package provides critical invest-
ments to a number of mitigation pro-
grams, but I want to highlight just one 
in particular, the STORM Act. Last 
year, I authored bipartisan legislation 
to create a new revolving loan program 
to be overseen by the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency, or FEMA. 
In January of this year, that bill was 
signed into law, establishing a new pro-
gram to help our communities tackle 
this rising threat. 
As the Senate crafted this important 
bipartisan infrastructure package over 
the past few weeks, I was able to work 
with my colleagues to secure $500 mil-
lion in initial funding for this program, 
the first Federal investment that will 
kick-start loans for communities all 
across our country to begin addressing 
this serious problem. 
With this downpayment, States will 
receive funding to create revolving 
loan funds to support local government 
investments 
in 
hazard 
mitigation 
projects that will help reduce natural 
disaster risk. The low-interest loans 
provided by this program will offer 
critical 
resources 
to 
cash-strapped 
local communities. Over time, repay-
ment of those loans at an extremely 
low interest rate will provide States 
with a self-sustaining fund that they 
can use to continue improving resil-
ience in other localities. 
Because the revolving loan funds are 
managed at the State level, each State 
will have the authority to prioritize 
funding for the projects with the great-
est need, rather than having the Fed-
eral Government make those decisions. 
This flexibility will allow States to 
focus on protecting vulnerable commu-
nities that are particularly hard hit by 
extreme weather events. 
Additionally, unlike other mitiga-
tion programs, the STORM Act is the 
first program to allow States to invest 
in projects to mitigate shoreline ero-
sion, rising water levels, and severe 
rainfall that can wreak havoc on public 
and private property alike. This is es-
pecially important for my home State 
of Michigan, where Great Lakes com-
munities have endured flooded camp-
grounds, streets, and basements be-
cause of storm water drainage issues; 
boating problems due to submerged 
structures; and the destruction of 
beaches and homes from high water 
levels.

S5902 
August 5, 2021 
Funding for the STORM Act, along 
with other mitigation funds provided 
in this legislation, will help transform 
our country into a more resilient na-
tion and save us money in the long run. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this critical investment in 
mitigation and enacting the bipartisan 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SURVIVORS’ BILL OF RIGHTS ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
reintroducing the Survivors’ Bill of 
Rights in the States Act of 2021. This 
measure, which Senator SHAHEEN has 
joined me in sponsoring, builds on an 
initiative on which the two of us 
worked together in 2016. 
Entitled 
the 
‘‘Survivors’ 
Bill 
of 
Rights Act,’’ that earlier legislation 
cleared the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee in June of 2016, during my ten-
ure as its chairman. The House of Rep-
resentatives introduced a similar pack-
age of rights some months later, and 
that version was enacted in the fall of 
2016 with my strong support. 
The 2016 statute provides very impor-
tant rights for victims of sexual vio-
lence, but that act only accomplishes 
those cases that are Federal. Such 
rights include, for example, the right 
to know the results of your forensic 
exam, the right to have evidence pre-
served for a certain period, and lastly, 
the right to notice before your forensic 
kit is destroyed. 
A young sexual assault survivor, 
Amanda Nguyen, who advocated for 
these rights at the Federal level, now 
is leading the effort to persuade other 
jurisdictions to adopt the same rights 
for all sexual assault victims. One of 
those jurisdictions is my home State of 
Iowa, which this summer adopted a 
package of rights that is closely mod-
eled after the Federal Survivors’ Bill of 
Rights. 
I want to take the opportunity to 
again thank Amanda, who arrived in 
my office 6 years ago and convinced me 
of the importance of working with her 
on this important initiative. Amanda 
also later testified before the Judiciary 
Committee, not once but twice, at my 
invitation, about the importance of 
protecting the rights of victims of sex-
ual violence in our criminal justice 
system. 
Amanda worked with Senator SHA-
HEEN on this same legislation, as well 
as this Senator, and I am pleased to 
partner with Senator SHAHEEN again in 
introducing today’s measure that will 
hopefully affect more States adopting 
this legislation. 
This bill that we sponsored, then, 
gives each State a financial incentive 
to adopt new rights for survivors in all 
sex crime cases, modeled on the same 
rights that victims in Federal cases 
now enjoy. Each State that extends 
these same rights to survivors of sex-
ual violence would then be eligible to 
receive a Federal grant under the legis-
lation that we have introduced. The 
amount of each State grant would be 
calculated based on the formula that is 
used to calculate STOP grant funding 
to States under a program that is au-
thorized 
by 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act. 
Finally, this measure that we have 
introduced would authorize $20 million 
annually for each of the next 5 fiscal 
years to support the implementation of 
the new grant program established by 
this bill. 
Once again, I want to thank Senator 
SHAHEEN for joining me in leading this 
legislation and for her commitment to 
working to increase protections for vic-
tims of sexual violence. 
I also want to thank the National Al-
liance to End Sexual Violence for 
working with us on the bill’s develop-
ment. 
Finally, 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
JACKIE SPEIER and Congressman KELLY 
ARMSTRONG for initiating this measure 
in the other Chamber. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in co-
sponsoring this bipartisan, bicameral 
legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, when I 
first ran for Congress in 2010, then-Vice 
President Biden was on a ‘‘recovery 
summer’’ tour. You see, on the heels of 
a trillion-dollar stimulus package, he 
argued millions of jobs would magi-
cally appear. 
Happy days are here again. 
When that summer ended, the unem-
ployment rate was 9.4 percent, and 
280,000 jobs vanished. If ever there was 
a show that did not deserve a sequel, 
this was it. But that is exactly what 
the American people are living through 
right now. 
When they passed their $1.9 trillion 
‘‘son of stimulus’’ package earlier this 
year, the President and his friends in 
Congress promised millions of jobs and 
another summer of recovery. Like the 
original, this sequel is a flop. That is 
because, once again, our friends across 
the aisle are confusing taxpayer prior-
ities with a liberal wish list. 
I see at home the cost of living is ris-
ing for Hoosier families and job cre-
ators. You take a trip to my hometown 
grocery in Greenwood, IN, the cost of 
steak and chicken and bread have all 
increased. Across the board, the cost of 
putting food on the table has gone up 
over 5 percent since last year. 
It is not just groceries. The cost of 
gas and energy and housing and house-
hold goods are at historic highs, all 
while America endures a nationwide 
crime wave and our borders are over-
run. 
Now, I know my Democratic col-
leagues don’t want to use the I-word, 
but let’s call it what it is: Inflation. 
Taxation without legislation. And in-
flation is at its highest level since 2008. 
We know they want to raise taxes on 
Americans, including those in the mid-
dle class, but this is probably not what 
Democrats had in mind. 
But the President, evidently, he is 
not worried. He says the rising cost of 
living is only temporary. It is transi-
tory. 
Look, this is easy for him to say. His 
pocketbook isn’t impacted by infla-
tion. He isn’t buying groceries at the 
local grocery store or a new fridge for 
the White House. He is not gassing up 
the Presidential limousine. Maybe that 
explains why he is urging Congress to 
spend another $3.5 trillion taxpayer 
dollars—$10 billion here for environ-
mental justice, $174 billion there for 
electric cars, a massive expansion of 
Medicare and Medicaid, and trillions 
more in taxes on American families as 
we emerge from a global pandemic. 
Trust me, I can tell you, Hoosiers 
don’t want any of that, nor do the ma-
jority of the American people: no more 
trillion-dollar 
tax-and-spend 
rescue 
plans. They aren’t rescuing Americans; 
they are raising their cost of living. 
Don’t take it from me. Take it from 
Larry Summers, President Obama’s 
economic adviser. He is warning Presi-
dent Biden about inflation—has been 
for a number of months. In fact, he de-
scribed recent fiscal macroeconomic 
policy, including the last round of 
nearly $2 trillion in stimulus as ‘‘the 
least responsible fiscal macroeconomic 
policy we’ve had in the last 40 years.’’ 
With friends like these—but, you know, 
he speaks the truth. 
I wish the President would listen to 
Secretary 
Summers. 
He 
certainly 
won’t listen to us. We are not arguing 
for inaction, though. In fact, we are 
willing to collaborate. We know there 
is need for targeted and responsible 
government spending tied to actual re-
sults on core infrastructure, on work-
force training, on cutting-edge tech-
nology. 
We just believe that every taxpayer 
dollar is a sacred trust, and we should 
treat it accordingly. If we are going to 
invest it, the American people better 
see returns. What they are seeing in 
the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget pro-
posal is a rerun of a failed trillion-dol-
lar tax-and-spend spectacle from just a 
decade ago. 
Now, the final act of that show, by 
the way, was not recovery. It was the 
American people handing control of the 
House of Representatives over to the 
Republican 
Party.

should keep that in mind. The Presi-
dent should keep that in mind. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD TRUMKA 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise 
with—I don’t know if I ever actually 
said this on the Senate floor—I rise 
with a heavy heart because of the 
death earlier today of a longtime 
friend, Rich Trumka, who was the 
longtime President of the National 
AFL–CIO. 
I call him a friend because my wife 
Connie—who is in the Gallery with our 
grandson Clayton. My wife Connie and 
I have walked picket lines with Rich 
Trumka, 
done 
rallies 
with 
Rich 
Trumka, and spoken on behalf of work-
ers with Rich Trumka. 
He was a son of our part of the coun-
try—Pennsylvania, 
West 
Virginia, 
Ohio. He was a coal miner, not just the 
son of a coal miner. I believe he once 
told me he was the grandson of a coal 
miner, but he was a coal miner early in 
life. 
He embodied the soul of the labor 
movement. He understood workers. He 
was for them and of them in ways that 
are unusual in America in the 21st cen-
tury. 
He understood and lived and fought 
for the dignity of work, the idea that 
hard work should pay off for everyone. 
He understood what a woman from 
southern West Virginia said to me 
some weeks ago at a ‘‘Dignity of 
Work’’ hearing in the Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs Committee that 
I chair. She said the words ‘‘working’’ 
and ‘‘poor’’ should not be in the same 
sentence. Think about that. The words 
‘‘working’’ and ‘‘poor’’ should not be in 
the same sentence. 
Rich Trumka understood the dignity 
of work. When you work hard—whether 
you punch a clock or swipe a badge or 
work for salary or work for tips or take 
care of children or grandchildren or 
children or grandparents—that hard 
work should be rewarded; that no one 
who works hard should not have a de-
cent standard of living. 
Few in this country have done more 
for workers than Rich. Giving workers 
a voice has been his life’s work. From 
his days in the mine, when he was an 
outspoken advocate for trade union-
ism, he understood it was unions; that 
carrying a union card was about em-
powering workers. If you join a union; 
you make better wages; you get better 
benefits; you get health insurance; you 
have more power over your schedule. 
You have a safety net often when trag-
edy strikes. Rich understood that. He 
understood that unions helped build ca-
reers and provide for families. 
Our hearts are with Barbara, his wife, 
and their son and with all the workers 
around the country. I can’t even imag-
ine how many workers Rich Trumka 
touched. 
I looked at the impact of just the 
work he did with me, let alone with so 
many in this body; the work he did 
fighting for pensions, and with his sup-
port—leading the charge, really—a mil-
lion families in the United States— 
more than a million families—had 
their pensions restored back in March 
when we passed the American Rescue 
Plan. 
He understood the importance of the 
child tax credit. He understood the im-
portance of the Affordable Care Act. He 
understood the importance of pro-
tecting the right to organize, which 47 
Senate Democrats are cosponsors of. 
He was even, yesterday, on a call with 
workers in Alabama, helping to encour-
age them to organize. He knew that his 
job as a labor leader was to represent 
the hundreds and hundreds and hun-
dreds of thousands of members and 
their families but to always try to re-
cruit new people to join the labor 
movement, and he knew that it was an 
uphill fight because of the way the sys-
tem is rigged toward corporations and 
toward employers. 
He would say, if he were here, how 
important it is to carry on with or 
without him, carry on his life’s work 
by standing in solidarity with all the 
men and women of the labor move-
ment, who built the strongest middle 
class the world has ever seen. 
We see that middle class shrinking 
day by day, slowly shrinking, and the 
reason is because we see the number of 
union members shrinking. He knew the 
way to turn that around was the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act. He 
knew the way to turn that around was 
to get more people organized, to give 
them the option. 
Half of America would like to join a 
union, surveys say—at least half—if 
they had the opportunity. Most don’t 
because of the outmoded, outdated, 
rigged-against-them labor laws in this 
country, but Rich understood that. He 
understood people staying in the mid-
dle class. The union card helped people 
join the middle class, expand the mid-
dle class. 
Also, one other point is, I thought of 
what Rich Trumka did. One of the 
things I worked most of my career on 
is a better fair trade policy. I voted 
against every single trade agreement 
that came in front of me until 2 years 
ago, and that is because Rich Trumka 
played 
a 
major 
role 
in 
changing 
NAFTA, in changing the USMCA, the 
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment, and put in language that Sen-
ator WYDEN and I worked on that will 
put workers at the center. 
The way that Rich Trumka under-
stood government is, if you put work-
ers at the center of our policy—work-
ers at the center of our trade policy, 
workers at the center of our tax policy, 
workers at the center of everything we 
do here; call it dignity of work; call it 
putting workers at the center—if you 
do that, everything right will flow 
from there. We will have a more just 
society. We will have a more pros-
perous society. We will have more op-
portunity for our children. That is 
what Rich Trumka was. That is what 
he stood for. That is what he was all 
about. That is the fight that we need to 
carry on on his behalf and in his mem-
ory. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, before I 
begin, I want to take a moment to ac-
knowledge 
the 
passing 
of 
Richard 
Trumka, just as my colleagues have 
been speaking of him so wonderfully. 
You know, during his time leading 
the AFL–CIO, he was a tireless de-
fender of workers and the rights of 
working Americans all across our 
country. He recognized the capability 
of what Americans—of what they could 
achieve by working together. He fought 
fiercely to help build something better 
for our country and for our country’s 
workforce. 
My thoughts are with his family and 
his loved ones. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. President, let us all take inspira-
tion and lessons from the trail that he 
blazed, which is why I rise today to dis-
cuss a bill that would also help to build 
something better for our country as 
well as our country’s workers: the In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
This bipartisan bill is an opportunity 
for the U.S. Senate to make a major in-
vestment in our communities, in our 
States, in our country. The goal of the 
G–22 bipartisan working group, which I 
was proud to join earlier this year, has 
been to develop bold, comprehensive 
legislation that will make a real, 
meaningful difference in people’s lives, 
and now—now—we are close to seeing 
that goal achieved. 
This bill has been years in the mak-
ing. During my time in Congress, we 
have gone from one infrastructure 
week to the next with never much to 
show for it until now. 
It is not hyperbole to say that our bi-
partisan bill will be the most signifi-
cant investment in American infra-
structure since we built the Interstate 
Highway System. I know that for my 
State, for Nevada, these investments— 
well, they are going to make a real dif-
ference because this bill takes steps to 
support our traditional infrastructure: 
our roads, our bridges, our rail, our 
transit. 
You know, in Nevada, there are over 
1,000 miles of highway in our State 
that are in need of repair and well over 
two dozen of Nevada’s bridges that 
need to be restored. We have all experi-
enced driving on cracked roads and 
broken-down bridges. We know the toll 
it takes. And this degradation—it poses 
serious safety concerns. It increases 
commute times. It costs Nevada driv-
ers hundreds each year in costs, maybe 
thousands, due to poor conditions. And 
now, right now, we have an oppor-
tunity to make critical upgrades and 
repairs both for those who call the Sil-
ver State home and for the millions— 
millions—of travelers that visit us 
from far and wide.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5904 
August 5, 2021 
Our bill would also provide funding 
to expand our roads, bridges, and high-
ways in Nevada and across the whole 
country, from the Presiding Officer’s 
State of Maine all the way down to us 
in Southern Nevada. 
As a member of the group who nego-
tiated this bipartisan legislation, I am 
proud that our bill provides flexible 
funding to States and communities to 
address their unique challenges. In Ne-
vada, that means meeting the needs of 
a growing population and making our 
State accessible to visitors who con-
tribute to our economy and support our 
job-creating businesses. The Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act—well, it 
meets that need by providing growing 
Western States like mine, Nevada, crit-
ical funding for surface transportation 
investments. 
The bill would also make significant 
investments in accessible public trans-
port and rail systems to ease travel for 
people in our cities and to connect our 
rural and suburban communities to our 
urban cores. 
Through the bill’s investment in 
western water systems, we can trans-
port water across communities to bet-
ter meet needs swiftly and develop im-
portant water recycling and reuse 
projects that will go a long way to pro-
viding greater access to water—some-
thing especially needed in my State 
and so many others as we deal with the 
current historic drought conditions. 
But beyond traditional infrastruc-
ture investments, this bill is also for-
ward-thinking in its scope and in its 
intent. The Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act—well, it just doesn’t in-
vest in solutions to our current prob-
lems; it will help invest in the success 
of our Nation’s future and our ability 
to 
overcome 
emerging 
problems 
through energy and cyber security in-
frastructure, like my Cyber Sense Act, 
bipartisan legislation that is included 
in this legislation to ensure the cyber 
security of technologies used in our 
bulk power system. 
You 
know, 
in 
addressing 
these 
emerging challenges, it took hard 
work, and it took compromise—exactly 
what our constituents expect of us but 
which Congress far too often fails to 
deliver. 
Many of you know that the process of 
bringing this bill together involved nu-
merous 
meetings, long hours, and 
many discussions across party lines on 
all the issues involved. I was proud to 
take part in helping put this bill to-
gether because I wanted to be the voice 
at the table for Nevadans, that voice at 
the negotiating table that they need 
me to be, and I wanted to make sure 
that we addressed the issues important 
to our State. I am here to say that this 
bill does just that. 
This bill includes investments that 
will uniquely benefit Nevada now and 
for years to come by increasing access 
to broadband, by upgrading our State’s 
airports—two sections of the legisla-
tion that I took a leading role in draft-
ing. 
I don’t have to tell anyone, but fast, 
reliable access to the internet—it is 
critical for all of our daily lives, and it 
has been for decades. The pandemic— 
well, it only put a spotlight on our cur-
rent digital divide and the challenges 
that far too many Americans face get-
ting connected. 
During COVID–19, many Nevadans 
went online, well, to conduct business, 
to seek medical care, or pursue edu-
cation, but our State’s broadband dis-
parity limits many Nevadans, from 
rural and Tribal communities to our 
underserved areas and our large cities, 
from using or even having the most 
basic of internet services. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act is going to bring broadband to 
communities that have long gone with-
out access. It makes an unprecedented 
investment in building out broadband 
infrastructure. Never before has Con-
gress taken such a bold step to get all 
Americans connected. Our bill includes 
over $42 billion for State broadband de-
ployment grants to connect unserved 
and underserved communities to high- 
speed internet. 
Finally, we will tackle the ‘‘last 
mile’’ challenges that have plagued so 
many of our communities for years. 
This bipartisan legislation also in-
cludes my Middle Mile Broadband De-
ployment Act, which I drafted to fund 
critical broadband infrastructure that 
connects internet carriers to local net-
works 
and 
community 
institutions 
that will serve as a launching-off point 
and connector for getting broadband 
out to all households in their areas. It 
would also make the cost of broadband 
more affordable to Nevada families, 
providing low-income households sup-
port to help pay for this service via the 
new infrastructure that we are build-
ing. 
Initial estimates are that our bipar-
tisan legislation will make broadband 
access accessible to more than 120,000 
Nevadans who currently lack it, and it 
will provide subsidies to about a quar-
ter of our State’s residents most in 
need so that they can afford it. 
Through this bill, we are taking steps 
to get Nevadans connected for success 
in the 21st century and beyond. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act—well, it is also going to help 
support a key industry in the Silver 
State: travel and tourism. It does so by 
providing much needed funding for air-
ports to expand and upgrade their ter-
minals and facilities. As we prepare for 
a postpandemic world, these critical 
investments will allow us to bring in 
travelers and tourists in even greater 
numbers. As they come, these visitors 
will support our State’s local busi-
nesses; they will boost our commu-
nities and our economy. 
As chair of the Senate Subcommittee 
on Tourism, Trade, and Export Pro-
motion, I made it my priority to fight 
for Nevada’s travel, tourism, and hospi-
tality economy as a member of the G– 
22, and I will continue to do so. 
In addition to securing robust fund-
ing for our airports, I am also proud 
that this legislation includes my bipar-
tisan TOURISM Act, which requires 
the Department of Transportation to 
update its national travel and tourism 
infrastructure strategic plan to develop 
an 
immediate-term 
and 
long-term 
strategy to use the infrastructure in-
vestments that we make today—that 
we are going to make, this week, pos-
sible—to revive the travel and tourism 
not just in Nevada but, of course, all 
across this Nation as we come out of a 
deadly pandemic. 
Through the investments provided in 
this bill, Nevada’s travel and tourism 
industry and hopefully all of our tour-
ism can soar once more. To make all of 
these things happen, this bill, our bill, 
invests in creating jobs, jobs that will 
help repair and strengthen our infra-
structure and jobs that will build our 
country’s new foundation. 
With the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act, we can rebuild; we can 
revamp; we can work through all of our 
infrastructure. Through that, we will 
create good-paying jobs, and we will 
improve the lives of hard-working fam-
ilies and communities all across this 
country. 
I urge all of my colleagues to choose 
to make this investment with us. Join 
us, please, in investing in our families 
and investing in our communities and 
investing in our States and in our 
country’s future. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CLEAN SCHOOL BUS PROGRAM 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, for al-
most two decades, I have worked on 
policies to clean up dirty diesel en-
gines, 
especially 
our 
Nation’s 
schoolbuses. 
And our Presiding Officer—as am I, a 
recovering Governor—has thought a lot 
over the years about schools and edu-
cation and more than a little bit about 
schoolbuses and how to get kids where 
they need to go to get educated. 
During a normal school year, I am 
told that more than 25 million Amer-
ican children—more than 25 million 
American children—ride a schoolbus 
every day—at least every schoolday to 
school. 
Ninety-five percent of these buses are 
powered by diesel fuel; and the major-
ity are old, dirty engines that pollute 
the air, in many cases make our kids 
sick, and impact our climate. 
When we clean up schoolbuses, it is a 
win-win 
situation. 
Our 
kids 
get 
healthier air to breath, our businesses 
get the message that it is time to in-
vest right here in America on the lat-
est and cleanest technologies, and we 
add to our toolbox for tackling the 
challenge of climate change. 
Electric schoolbuses make this win- 
win possible. Schoolbuses have a set

route and can be predictably recharged. 
Schoolbuses, unlike other heavy-duty 
vehicles, do not often travel more than 
150 miles a day and, therefore, do not 
have the range issues with current bat-
tery technology. 
However, electric schoolbuses today 
are expensive compared to diesel buses; 
and, too often, buying an electric 
schoolbus is hard for schools that are 
already strapped for cash, especially 
schools that serve low-income and mi-
nority populations. 
The EPA Diesel Emission Reduction 
Act, known as DERA—the original co-
sponsors of whom were George Voino-
vich of Ohio and yours truly—helps 
schools replace dirty diesel engines 
with all types of technologies, includ-
ing electric vehicles. 
With the death of George Voinovich, 
gosh, close to a decade ago, JIM INHOFE, 
a colleague from Oklahoma, has taken 
up the torch from our good friend 
George to champion through the Diesel 
Emission Reduction Act, the focus of 
replacing dirty diesel engines, includ-
ing for schoolbuses. 
However, the DERA program is woe-
fully underfunded and is not structured 
specifically 
to 
meet 
school 
needs. 
DERA also does not prioritize low-in-
come schools, nor provide funds specifi-
cally for electric schoolbuses. 
With a new EPA Clean School Bus 
program, we can build on the lessons 
learned from the Diesel Emissions Re-
duction Act and help make it easier for 
schools 
to 
buy 
zero-emitting 
schoolbuses and other schoolbuses to 
meet emission standards. 
Through this new Clean School Bus 
program, we also will use the Federal 
purchasing power to increase the de-
mand for electric schoolbuses, buses 
that are manufactured here in America 
in places, among others, like Georgia, 
which, in turn, will bring down the 
overall cost of schoolbuses for every-
body. 
Here is what the clean schoolbus lan-
guage in this legislation does. The 
Clean School Bus program amends the 
EPA Clean School Bus program that 
was originally authorized in the En-
ergy Policy Act of 2005, but never fund-
ed by Congress or implemented by EPA 
16 years ago. EPA is authorized to cre-
ate a national program to fund the re-
placement of existing schoolbuses with 
zero-emitting schoolbuses and other 
clean schoolbuses through grants and 
rebates. 
The Clean School Bus program places 
a priority on schools that serve low-in-
come students, are on Tribal lands, or 
are located in rural areas, and the pro-
gram can fund up to 100 percent of the 
cost of a new schoolbus. 
The legislation provides $5 billion in 
funding for this new Clean School Bus 
program over 5 years, with $2.5 billion 
allocated exclusively for zero-emission 
schoolbuses. The remaining $2.5 billion 
can be used on buses that run on lique-
fied natural gas, compressed natural 
gas, on hydrogen, propane, or biofuels, 
and can be used for zero-emission 
schoolbuses. 
My Environment and Public Works 
Committee staff and I, along with the 
administration, worked hard to make 
sure that zero-emitting schoolbuses 
had dedicated funding in this program 
and would be eligible for all program 
funding. This agreement does just that. 
I expect EPA to work to implement 
this program in a way that focuses on 
pushing zero-emission technology out 
into the market. Technology that uses 
fossil fuels is readily available and eco-
nomic today and should not be broadly 
subsidized by taxpayer dollars. 
My hope is that this is just a down 
payment, and that Congress will invest 
in the future even more in zero-emit-
ting schoolbuses. Our kids and our cli-
mate can’t wait. They deserve it, and 
we need to deliver it to them. 
With that, I yield the floor to the 
Senator from Iowa. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
January 27 of this year, the Biden ad-
ministration put out a wide-ranging 
Executive order on tackling climate 
change. Tucked in that Executive order 
was a line directing Secretaries of Ag-
riculture, the Interior, and Commerce 
to develop a plan to conserve at least 
30 percent of our lands and waters by 
2030. This plan is commonly referred to 
as the ‘‘30 by 30.’’ 
To reach the Biden administration’s 
goal of 30 percent of the land in con-
servation by 2030, the Federal Govern-
ment will have significant work ahead 
of them to accomplish that. 
This is what 30 percent means. Thirty 
percent of the land would mean that we 
will need 440 million additional acres 
in permanent conservation. 
To put 440 million acres of land into 
perspective, it is the equivalent of tak-
ing the State of Iowa and putting all of 
Iowa’s land into permanent conserva-
tion. But that is still not enough to get 
to 440 million acres. You would repeat 
that 11 more times to reach the Biden 
administration’s goal of 30 percent of 
the land in conservation by 2030. 
This is not really an attempt at con-
servation; it is an attempt at confisca-
tion, even though the confiscation 
would be rewarded, presumably, by an-
nual payments from the Federal Gov-
ernment. Between the 30 by 30 land 
grab and the Waters of the U.S. re-
write, it is clear that this administra-
tion simply does not understand rural 
America. If they did understand, then 
they would realize that farmers are the 
first and best conservationists because 
it is good for their pocketbook and 
good for the environment. 
If the United States decides to go for-
ward with the 30 by 30 plan, we already 
know what will happen. This rhetoric 
empowers our Nation’s corn and soy-
bean competitors to increase their out-
put. 
Now, Brazil is the best example of 
our corn and soybean competitors, so 
let’s look at Brazil. This week, the Bra-
zilian House of Representatives ad-
vanced a bill that their President, 
President Bolsonaro, supports, that al-
lows the squatters on public lands in 
the Amazon rainforest to more easily 
receive deeds to their properties. Now, 
there is nothing wrong with deeds to 
property, but what this is going to do 
is allow squatters to burn the forest to 
plant corn and soybeans. 
Let me tell you how significant this 
burning is, and this was a few years ago 
that I read this. I read something from 
the astronauts in our space station cir-
cling the globe. They said there were 
two significant things that stand out 
on the Earth’s surface when you look 
down: No. 1 is the Great Wall of China, 
and No. 2 is the smoke coming from the 
burning of the rainforest. 
Now, Brazil has already plowed under 
more than half of the Cerrado, which is 
tropical savanna. The Cerrado is a vital 
storehouse for carbon dioxide that has 
been disappearing at rates faster than 
even the Amazon rainforest. 
If we tie the hands of American farm-
ers, our competitors, like the ones in 
Brazil, will continue to meet the needs 
of a growing, hungry world. By 2050, 
the world population will grow to 9 bil-
lion people, and we are going to have to 
feed them. 
I don’t think the United States 
should cede our leadership in produc-
tion agriculture to other countries 
that already have poor environmental 
standards. So what you are saying is, 
in this Cerrado, where the carbon is al-
ready sequestered for millennia, that 
somehow we ought to have a policy 
here to store more carbon by more con-
servation to let them plow up more in 
Brazil. 
The 5-year farm bill already does a 
great job of encouraging farmers and 
landowners to preserve fragile lands, 
enhancing environmental benefits for 
all Americans. These farm bill provi-
sions are referred to as ‘‘working lands 
programs’’—programs like the Envi-
ronmental Quality Incentives Program 
that goes by the acronym EQIP, or the 
Conservation Stewardship Program we 
call CSP. These programs provide in-
centives to help producers adopt man-
agement practices on their ground that 
allows the land to stay in production 
while improving environmental out-
comes. 
If the Biden administration focuses 
on these longtime conservation pro-
grams, my speech today would be 
praising those efforts; but, instead, this 
administration has proposals that take 
productive farmland out of production, 
placing the U.S. at a competitive dis-
advantage. 
We have learned from the Conserva-
tion Reserve Program—the CRP we 
call it in agriculture—the CRP pro-
gram we have had around for decades. 
About 24 million acres is in CRP now. 
But we learned a lesson from the early 
days of CRP that if you take too much 
land out of production in a certain 
area, it hurts the small business people 
who either serve farmers after the 
products leave their farm or serve 
farmers with input into agriculture.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5906 
August 5, 2021 
So later on, we had to put a require-
ment that no more than 25 percent of 
one county can be put into the CRP. 
Even in doing that—we have counties 
in southern Iowa that have 25 percent 
of their land in CRP—and we know 
even there that with the limit of 25 
percent, we still have lost a lot of 
small business people who work with 
farmers, and we ruin the small commu-
nities of States that have that prob-
lem. 
So I would be praising these efforts if 
this is what the administration was 
satisfied with, but, instead, they have 
these proposals to take productive 
farmland out of production and putting 
our competitors in a financial advan-
tage. 
These ideas also make it harder for 
new and beginning farmers to compete 
on rental rates and gain access to 
land—another lesson we learned in the 
years ‘13, ‘14, and ‘15. We changed it in 
the 2018 farm bill, but what we learned 
in ‘13, ‘14, and ‘15, is when the Govern-
ment is paying more for farmers to 
take their land out of production than 
is the going rate for cash rent in those 
areas, when the government becomes 
an unfair competitor and pays more, 
then the farmer landlords put their 
land in the CRP. Then those farmers 
that were farming that land can’t farm 
it anymore because they can’t afford to 
compete with what the Government is 
paying. 
Now, there is a limit that cash rent 
from the Government can’t be more 
than 80 percent of the average cash 
rent in a particular county. So we have 
kind of overcome that problem. But if 
you pay farmers now to put 30 percent 
of the land out of production, you are 
going to lose a lot of farmers that are 
cash renters, and we shouldn’t be hav-
ing the Government be an unfair com-
petitor against the farmers that pay 
cash rent. 
So these farmers understand how 
conservation 
and 
sustainable 
agri-
culture affects productivity and gener-
ational prosperity. It is important for 
us to leave the land better than we 
found it for our children and grand-
children. 
So far the Biden administration has 
said their 30 by 30 plan focuses on vol-
untary measures. Well, farmers can 
make a choice to do it or not, but to 
get to 440 million additional acres in 
conservation, you would be foolish to 
think that voluntary measures are 
going to get to the goal this adminis-
tration wants. 
Instead of focusing on taking more 
land out of production agriculture, 
let’s work on a strategy that allows 
farmers to continue to farm their land 
while improving environmental out-
comes. 
I yield the floor. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD TRUMKA 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
came to the floor today to make re-
marks in support of the bipartisan in-
frastructure modernization plan. But 
before I do that, I do want to take a 
moment to remember a real giant of 
the American working people, and that 
is Richard Trumka, the head of the 
AFL–CIO, who is somebody who got up 
every single morning thinking about 
how to make life better for working 
people in America. 
He was passionate about it. He was a 
fellow Marylander. We are going to 
miss him, but I know that we will con-
tinue to be inspired by his example and 
his understanding that when working 
people ban together to form a union, 
that is the best way for them to be able 
to bargain for better wages and better 
benefits and a better retirement and a 
better life. 
So I know that we will all carry on in 
his memory. And as we take up this 
bill to modernize our infrastructure, it 
was something that he worked with us 
on to ensure that as we modernize our 
infrastructure, we also create good- 
paying jobs. And I do think that this 
bill will modernize our infrastructure 
and generate millions of good-paying 
jobs for the American people. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. President, it was just about 6 
months ago that I came to the floor to 
urge my Senate colleagues to heed the 
call of the American people and pass 
the American Rescue Plan. At that 
time, the country was being ravaged by 
the COVID–19 pandemic. The economy 
was in a slump. The country was hurt-
ing, and the American people were 
hurting. 
The American Rescue Plan was de-
signed to accelerate the deployment of 
vaccines to defeat the pandemic, to ex-
tend a hand to those who have been 
hardest hit, and to boost an economic 
comeback. We knew we had to be bold, 
we had to be quick, and we had to be 
decisive in our actions or risk a drawn 
out recovery and a weakened public 
health response. 
That legislation, the American Res-
cue Plan, promised immediate action 
to meet the urgency of the moment, 
and that is exactly what it did. Thanks 
to the American Rescue Plan, we jump- 
started 
the 
deployment 
of 
the 
coronavirus vaccines in faster and fair-
er ways, distributed around the coun-
try. Thanks to the American Rescue 
Plan, millions of American households 
received a new round of direct pay-
ments, bringing their total relief pay-
ment—including the December relief 
bill—up to $2,000 per person. 
The American Rescue Plan also ex-
panded the child tax credit to cut child 
poverty nearly in half this year, with 
millions of American families receiving 
up to $300 each month for each child. 
And because of the American Rescue 
Plan, State and local governments are 
receiving the direct funding they need 
to keep frontline workers on the job 
and continue essential benefits to lift 
up our communities. 
And thanks to the American Rescue 
Plan, we secured Federal funds to keep 
restaurants 
and 
small 
businesses 
afloat, assist children with disabilities, 
get our kids back in school more quick-
ly and more safely, bolster childcare, 
and help more people get connected to 
the internet during this time when we 
had to experience so much social 
distancing, and much more. 
That plan was a victory. It was a vic-
tory for our families, for our workers, 
for small businesses, for communities, 
and for the country. And while we 
know we have more work to do to de-
feat the Delta variant of the virus, 
today, more than 70 percent of the 
adult population has gotten at least 
one shot of the COVID–19 vaccine. And 
last quarter, our economy grew at an 
annualized rate of 61⁄2 percent, and our 
gross domestic product rose for the 
first time from the beginning of the 
pandemic to the point where it had 
been before that started. 
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan 
and the resilience of the American peo-
ple, we are building back from this cri-
sis. But while building back is good, it 
is not good enough. As President Biden 
has said, we need to not just build back 
but build back better. And building 
back better means not only growing 
our economy bigger and faster but pro-
viding for more inclusive growth and 
more shared prosperity. We cannot ac-
cept an economy where the already- 
rich grow ever richer while everyone 
else is running in place or falling be-
hind. A rising tide must lift all boats, 
not just the yachts. 
President Biden has laid out two im-
portant pieces to advance the better 
part of the Build Back Better agenda. 
One is the American Jobs Plan, and the 
other is the American Families Plan. 
Both of these plans, and more, are key 
to building an economy that works for 
everyone and not just those who are al-
ready at the top. 
The bipartisan infrastructure plan 
that we are considering now contains 
many elements of the Biden American 
Jobs Plan. And while I wish it included 
even more, it is a very important start, 
and I strongly support it. 
And I appreciate the bipartisan co-
operation that helped advance this 
plan, including the efforts of the Pre-
siding Officer. These combined efforts 
have produced a plan that will make 
key investments in virtually every 
part of our infrastructure. 
It will include investments in our 
transit systems and railways and help 
repair our roads and bridges and tun-
nels and more. It makes the largest in-
vestment in clean drinking water and 
wastewater infrastructure in American 
history. And, very importantly, this 
legislation includes essential invest-
ments to build the backbone of the 
modern 21st century economy, includ-
ing funds to expand broadband so we 
can bridge the digital divide and funds 
to start building out our clean energy 
grid and the deployment of electric 
charging stations. 
I was proud to work with my col-
league and friend from Maryland, Sen-
ator CARDIN, to secure some key ele-
ments that will directly support our 
home State of Maryland and the people

August 5, 2021 
who live there. I would like to take a 
moment to discuss the impact of this 
legislation here in Maryland, starting 
with the funds that it provides to re-
pair and restore our roads, our bridges, 
and our tunnels. 
Under this plan, the State of Mary-
land will receive $4.1 billion for Federal 
highways and $409 million for bridge re-
placement and repairs over the next 5 
years. These funds will be absolutely 
vital as we work to restore 273 bridges 
and over 2,000 miles of Maryland high-
ways that are in poor condition and in 
desperate need of repair. 
This plan also makes a historic in-
vestment in public transit and rail sys-
tems in Maryland and the DMV area. 
Maryland will receive $1.7 billion over 5 
years to improve public transportation 
options across our entire State. 
And this legislation will make an im-
portant down payment on our Amtrak 
passenger rail systems by addressing 
the big repair backlog along Amtrak’s 
Northeast Corridor and by supporting 
projects like the B&P Tunnel in Balti-
more, which is used by 9 million trav-
elers every year but has faced chal-
lenges of structural deterioration and 
fire safety concerns for far too long. 
Restoring this tunnel could slash the 
time it takes to get from Baltimore to 
Washington down to just 30 minutes 
and create 30,000 jobs. And it is a shin-
ing example of the type of projects that 
could be funded by this bill and we ex-
pect will be funded by this bill. 
As you know, we are not just talking 
about heavy rail. This plan also au-
thorizes transit monies and, impor-
tantly, it continues the $150 million an-
nual Federal contribution to the Wash-
ington area Metro system, known as 
WMATA. We call it the Nation’s Metro 
system. 
This bill will extend the Federal au-
thorization of $150 million for another 8 
years. This is especially important 
since that authorization has now ex-
pired. It is also important because this 
new version includes provisions to 
strengthen WMATA’s inspector gen-
eral’s authority in order to improve 
oversight and passenger safety. It is a 
big win for passengers and transit em-
ployees alike, and I am delighted to see 
that 8-year authorization in this bill. 
That is good news for this part of the 
region and for this part of Maryland 
that is covered by WMATA, but in the 
Baltimore area, many residents don’t 
have easy access to accessible, afford-
able transit that can get them where 
they need to go around the city or the 
region when they need to go there. 
That is why we also secured a provision 
in this bill to keep alive future Federal 
funding for the Baltimore Red Line 
Metro system. 
This is a project that had been years 
in the making, and, if completed, 
would boost jobs and economic growth, 
reduce travel times in the Baltimore 
region, alleviate congestion, and re-
duce air pollution. The Maryland dele-
gation fought for years to get this 
project to the front of the line, and, in 
2015, we were pleased to secure $900 
million in Federal funds for the Balti-
more Red Line project. 
But then something happened. The 
Maryland Governor pulled the plug on 
the entire Red Line project, turning 
down the jobs and improved transpor-
tation network for the Baltimore area. 
Other cities and regions around the 
country were celebrating when they 
got those funds instead of Baltimore. 
Senator CARDIN and I have not given 
up. And while the Federal Government 
cannot, by itself, bring this project on-
line, this bill states that the Federal 
Government is still a willing partner 
on the Red Line when State and local 
officials signal that they are ready and 
willing to move forward again. 
At the end of the day, the transpor-
tation investments made in this bill 
will facilitate people and products 
moving more quickly throughout their 
regions and throughout the country. It 
invests in airports and ports, including 
$17 billion in ports like the Port of Bal-
timore and others around the country. 
This funding will benefit our port, 
the Port of Baltimore, which is a key 
asset in our State and a powerful en-
gine for economic and job growth. It is 
currently a hub for 15,000 jobs, with 
room for growth that can be fueled by 
this bill. 
I was pleased to join others in wel-
coming our Secretary of Transpor-
tation, Pete Buttigieg, to Baltimore 
just last week where he underscored 
the Department’s commitment to in-
vesting in our ports and the men and 
women who work there. This legisla-
tion helps us make good on that com-
mitment. 
I partnered with colleagues over the 
years to secure over $500 million in 
Federal funds for that port, including 
funds to dredge channels in the Chesa-
peake Bay and the Baltimore Harbor so 
that they are deep enough to accommo-
date the biggest ships. 
Speaking of the Chesapeake Bay, 
every 
Marylander 
knows 
that 
the 
health of the bay is deeply bound to 
Maryland’s local economy and Mary-
land’s environmental well-being, and I 
am pleased that we secured $238 million 
in funding for the EPA Chesapeake Bay 
Program to help us meet the pollution 
reduction targets that are spelled out 
in the most recent multistate Chesa-
peake Bay agreement as part of this 
legislation. 
While this legislation provides im-
portant investments to modernize the 
infrastructure for this century, we, the 
Federal Government, should also take 
responsibility to help eliminate some 
of the past projects that, rather than 
helping 
unite 
communities, 
divide 
them and harm them. And there is no 
clearer example of such a project than 
what is known as the ‘‘highway to no-
where’’ in West Baltimore. 
As many Marylanders know, the 
‘‘highway to nowhere’’ was a project 
conceived in the 1960s as a way to link 
Baltimore with the growing U.S. Inter-
state Highway System. Instead, it tore 
West 
Baltimore 
apart. 
Developers 
started dividing up the community to 
make room for the highway, residents 
were evicted from their homes, busi-
nesses were shut down, and a Black 
community was split down the middle 
by that ‘‘highway to nowhere.’’ It is es-
timated that 971 houses and 62 busi-
nesses were destroyed, and over 1,500 
residents were displaced. 
And that has been the story of sev-
eral 
other 
Federal 
infrastructure 
projects from the 1960s, projects that 
too often place pavement over people. I 
am pleased that this bipartisan plan 
makes at least an initial down pay-
ment for the first time to put Federal 
dollars toward removing harmful infra-
structure projects like the ‘‘highway to 
nowhere’’ so we can reconnect these 
communities and make them whole. 
This provision was based off a pilot 
program I authored in 2019. I want to 
thank my colleagues, Senator CARDIN 
and Senator CARPER, for helping make 
this vision a reality, and President 
Biden for including it as part of his 
American Jobs Plan. While we didn’t 
get the full amount of funds that we 
would like, this is a very important 
first step. 
As we dismantle some of the harmful 
legacy from the 1960s and 20th century 
projects, we must build out and meet 
the new needs for the 21st century, like 
universal, affordable access to high- 
speed internet. 
I am very pleased that Maryland will 
receive a minimum of $100 million from 
this 
legislation 
to 
help 
provide 
broadband coverage across the State, 
including providing access to the at 
least 148,000 Marylanders who cur-
rently lack it—they are not con-
nected—and it would provide over 1 
million Marylanders access to the af-
fordability connectivity benefit plan to 
help 
lower 
income 
families 
afford 
internet access. It doesn’t do you much 
good to be connected to the internet if 
you can’t afford to use it. 
This bill also will make important 
progress, a first step, toward building 
out clean energy grid and a network of 
charging stations to facilitate long-dis-
tance travel and provide convenient 
charging options for electric vehicles. 
In short, and for all of these reasons, 
this bipartisan bill is an important 
step to helping us build back better 
and stronger than before the pandemic. 
That work starts here with this bill, 
and I strongly support it. But while 
that work starts here, it does not stop 
or end here. 
To pass this legislation and then call 
it quits would be to leave a big part of 
our job undone. We still have urgent 
work to do in our mission to enact all 
of President Biden’s Build Back Better 
agenda and address the profound chal-
lenges facing our communities that 
have been exacerbated by this pan-
demic. 
While this bill provides important 
downpayments in many areas, it does 
not do everything we need to do. That

August 5, 2021 
is especially true when it comes to in-
frastructure in the area of clean en-
ergy. We need to make sure we take up 
the other big pieces of the clean energy 
agenda in President Biden’s American 
Jobs Plan and other proposals that 
many of us have put forward here in 
this body, including the clean energy 
standard, including a clean energy ac-
celerator financing system, and many 
other provisions, in order for us to be 
true to the science and really confront 
the climate crisis that is upon us. 
And as we take those next steps to 
fully modernized our physical infra-
structure, we also have to dramatically 
expand opportunities for every child 
and every family and every worker in 
America. Much of that is laid out in 
President Biden’s American Families 
Plan, including universal access to 
early education so every single child, 
regardless of ZIP Code, has a chance 
and a good start in life; making work-
force training more affordable and col-
lege more affordable, whether it is 2 
years of community colleges or more. 
And we also have to make sure that 
we continue to provide support for fam-
ilies in the form of affordable childcare 
and, very importantly, extend the child 
tax credit payments that so many fam-
ilies are now receiving up to $300 a 
month. That ends at the end of this 
year if we don’t extend it. 
While it is always a good thing to re-
duce child poverty in America—and 
that reduces it by about half—that 
would only be true to the end of this 
year. We need to finish the job and 
keep going. 
We also need to reduce the costs that 
are squeezing the pocketbooks of every 
American family. We need to reduce 
the skyrocketing costs of prescription 
drugs. We need to reduce the costs of 
childcare. We need to make sure that 
families don’t have to spend more than 
8.5 percent of their budget on their an-
nual healthcare premiums. And we 
need to provide more security for ev-
erybody, including our seniors, by ex-
panding Medicare coverage to cover 
dental and vision and hearing needs. 
Those are just some of the additional 
things that we need to do as part of the 
American Families Plan and as part of 
passing the overall Build Back Better 
agenda. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to do all of that. But every 
journey begins with a big step, and this 
is a very important big step forward on 
that Build Back Better agenda. 
So I am pleased to join many of my 
colleagues, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan infrastructure 
modernization bill as part of a very im-
portant first step to implement the 
Build Back Better agenda and make 
sure that we truly build an economy 
that works for every American. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Wyoming. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President. I 
come to the floor today to comment on 
statements made by the majority lead-
er earlier today on this Senate floor, 
and he made those after President 
Biden, this morning, signed another ex-
pensive Executive order relating to cli-
mate change. 
The President at the time said it was 
his goal of making half of all new cars 
emission-free in less than a decade. In 
practice, that means making half of all 
new cars electric. 
Well, after the President signed his 
Executive order, the majority leader 
came to the floor, and he talked about 
his own plans to give more of American 
taxpayer dollars to the manufacturers 
and purchasers of electric vehicles. 
He said: 
[W]e hope to add large parts of the plan. 
Well, where does he want to add it? 
Well, he wants to add it to the reckless 
Democrat tax-and-spending plan. 
The American taxpayers are already 
giving billions and billions of taxpayer 
dollars to electric vehicle manufactur-
ers and owners. Electric vehicle mak-
ers have been given free tax dollars for 
30 years. The truth is, electric car buy-
ers don’t need more taxpayer money. 
They have plenty of their own. 
Today, the market for electric vehi-
cles is very well established. There are 
more than a million electric vehicles 
on the road today. They are being 
made by everyone: General Motors, 
Mercedes-Benz, 
U.S. 
manufacturers, 
foreign manufacturers. They are being 
made all around the world. 
In fact, the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration projects that sales of 
light-duty electric vehicles is going to 
reach 4 million by the year 2025. Elec-
tric vehicle makers are doing just fine. 
They are also receiving free money 
from just about every State. So who 
benefits from these taxpayer handouts 
to electric vehicle makers and users? 
Well, customers are usually wealthy. 
They don’t need more money. 
Now, seniors on fixed incomes, cer-
tainly in Wyoming, are not trading in 
their cars for expensive electric vehi-
cles. Middle-class families who are try-
ing to make ends meet are dealing with 
inflation that is hitting them every 
day under the Biden economy. They 
are not going out to buy expensive new 
electric vehicles. Seniors and middle- 
class families are hurting right now be-
cause of inflation hitting them when 
they buy gas, when they buy groceries, 
when they buy other goods. And this is, 
of course, triggered by massive Demo-
crat spending, including the borrowing 
and spending that has occurred under 
the 
last 
coronavirus—the 
so-called 
coronavirus relief bill. 
So Democrats aren’t looking out for 
them under the proposal. Oh, no. 
Nearly 80 percent of tax credits for 
electric vehicles go to households that 
earned at least $100,000 a year. Let me 
repeat that. Nearly 80 percent of the 
tax credits for electric vehicles go to 
households 
that 
have 
earned 
over 
$100,000 a year, not to mention the fact 
that these drivers don’t pay for the use 
and the abuse that occurs to the roads 
from them driving on the roads. The 
rest of us do. Anybody who puts gaso-
line in their car pays the gas tax. It 
goes to the highway trust fund. It goes 
to repair damage done to the roads. 
We are in a debate over infrastruc-
ture. Electric vehicles, no gas tax— 
that is the ordinary source of funding 
to do repair of our roads and our high-
ways. 
Now, even though a Tesla puts as 
much wear and tear on the road as a 
Ford Focus, the Tesla driver pays next 
to nothing to fix the roads. They con-
tribute nothing to the highway trust 
fund—one more Democrat giveaway to 
the rich. 
Electric vehicle owners don’t need 
our tax dollars. They have enough. 
They should pay fair share for the use 
and abuse that they do to the roads on 
which they drive. 
That is why I have introduced legis-
lation called the ELITE Act. It stands 
for End Lavish Incentives to Electric 
Vehicles. We need to make sure to end 
these incentives to electric vehicles. 
The bill would end the billion-dollar 
giveaways to electric vehicle makers. 
According to the Manhattan Insti-
tute, my bill would actually save tax-
payers $20 billion. At a time when mid-
dle-class families are hurting from in-
flation caused by Democrat spending, 
it is unconscionable that Democrats 
want to raise taxes to give more hand-
outs to the rich. It is certainly bad eco-
nomics, and it is bad news for hard- 
working American taxpayers. 
Rather than increasing the give-
aways, we should be bringing them to 
an end. We should stop this wasteful 
waste of taxpayer dollars. Any waste of 
taxpayer dollars is wrong, and this is 
certainly a case where taxpayer dollars 
are not necessary to be spent. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD TRUMKA 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Before I begin 
the remarks that brought me here 
today, I want to say a word about Rich-
ard Trumka, a hero to all of us who 
care about working people and a good 
friend to many of us. 
I am proud to call him a friend and 
proud to have been with him as an ally 
in causes and principles that are so im-
portant to the present of America and 
the future of America. I am proud to 
have been with him on picket line and 
platform, to have stood with him and 
behind him in supporting the rights of 
working men and women to decent pay, 
fair treatment, and safety on the job. 
He came from America, and he never 
forgot where he came from. His life is

a lesson to so many of us who seek to 
emulate his devotion to the public in-
terest. 
As a leader of the labor movement, 
his life also reminds us that unions 
count; 
that 
collective 
bargaining 
means something; that the rights of 
working men and women succeed be-
cause they come together in unions, 
and we ought to respect those unions 
and listen to them and champion their 
right to represent fairly and freely and 
to organize men and women on their 
jobs. 
So we will miss Richard Trumka, but 
his legacy is going to be an inspiration 
to all of us—certainly to me—in fight-
ing even harder for the great convic-
tions, sense of conscience, the wonder-
ful heart and spirit that embraced peo-
ple who disagreed with him. A life’s 
lesson for all of us. 
(The remarks of Mr. BLUMENTHAL 
pertaining to the introduction of S. 
2654 are printed in today’s RECORD 
under ‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills 
and Joint Resolutions.’’) 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The assistant majority leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me say a word of support for the Sen-
ator from Connecticut as well as the 
Senator from New Jersey. I couldn’t 
agree with them more. There is no rea-
son why this information—full disclo-
sure of this information—has not been 
made known first to the families but 
certainly to the people of this country 
at this moment in history, 20 years 
after that terrible tragedy. It is time 
for the truth to be known. 
I support your efforts completely, 
Senator BLUMENTHAL, and I will help 
you in any way that I can. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD TRUMKA 
Madam President, when I grew up in 
East St. Louis, IL, I knew I was from a 
railroad family because, well, both 
Mom and Dad worked for the railroads. 
I knew we had a pretty comfortable 
life. I have come to learn that we 
weren’t by any means rich, but we did 
well enough—two older brothers and 
myself. I knew that my mom and dad 
worked for a railroad, and eventually 
all of us in the family did in some ca-
pacity. 
I also knew that we were a union 
family, and I didn’t realize until much 
later in life a couple facts: No. 1, there 
were a lot of families around us who 
weren’t that lucky. We were fortunate 
to be a union family. Secondly, what 
the union did for my family in East St. 
Louis, IL, it did for millions of families 
across America throughout our his-
tory. Those labor unions could stand up 
and fight for people who couldn’t fight 
alone and have a chance to win. 
I have a healthy respect for unions. I 
believe that, more than any other force 
in American history, the American 
labor movement, the union movement, 
created the middle class in America. I 
am living proof of that. My mom and 
dad had eighth grade educations. My 
mother was an immigrant to this coun-
try. But hard work, a good work ethic, 
and a strong support of a labor union 
gave them a chance to earn a decent 
living on a safe job and to raise a good 
family. 
I reflect on that at this moment be-
cause we have lost one of the pillars of 
the union movement in the United 
States of America, Richard Trumka. 
What an amazing biography. I used 
to think back. I had heard he was the 
son of immigrants, and I knew that he 
worked in the coal mines, but then I 
knew he also went to law school, and 
he became head of the AFL–CIO, the 
largest gathering of unions in our 
country. 
If you ever met him, with his little 
brush mustache and the gruff way 
about him, you knew he was no push-
over. How could you be a pushover and 
head of the United Mine Workers union 
which he was at a very early age? How 
could you be a pushover and be head of 
a national labor organization like the 
AFL–CIO? He did that, and he was an 
amazing advocate for the women and 
men whom he represented in the labor 
movement. 
I can’t even start to count the num-
ber of meetings that I attended with 
Richard Trumka. When we wanted la-
bor’s voice, we called Richard Trumka, 
and we knew that when that door was 
closed, he was going to be brutally hon-
est with us. He would spend a few min-
utes thanking us, and then he would 
spend the rest of the meeting telling 
how we needed to do better: The work-
ing families of America were expecting 
us to stand up and fight for them. And 
he took no prisoners when he went 
through the roster and the rollcall of 
how people had voted and where they 
stood on union issues. It was an amaz-
ing performance by a man who had the 
credentials to deliver it, a man who 
was part of the labor movement from 
working in those coal mines, and a 
man who had developed the skills and 
talents at law school and beyond to be 
able to fight for those men and women. 
It is stunning to think that we lost 
him today at age 72. That is way too 
young. He did such an amazing job as 
the son of a coal miner himself. You 
never had to ask ever which side Rich 
Trumka was on—ever. 
I have got to be honest with you. 
There are some people who are fighting 
for causes in Washington, DC, because 
there is a paycheck at the end of the 
day, but there are some people who are 
fighting for causes who couldn’t give a 
damn about a paycheck. They are there 
because they believe it. Trumka was 
one of those people. He was fighting for 
working 
people 
across 
the 
United 
States night and day, endlessly, 24/7. 
He was on the side of workers who 
built America’s roads and bridges and 
of the men and women who were not in 
the labor movement but trying to be-
come part of it. He fought for the men 
and women who kept our powerplants 
running and our schools, homes, offices 
running. 
He always asked for one basic thing: 
respect and fairness for working men 
and women. 
He was with me on the Dream Act. 
He understood, as the son of immi-
grants, that immigrants are a vital 
part of this country, and they should 
be for years to come. 
Trumka was on the side of growing 
this American economy the right way, 
not from the top-down, not trickle- 
down, but from the bottom-up. He be-
lieved, growing up in Pennsylvania and 
the life that he led, that it was critical 
that we be there for families when they 
made the basic decisions about whether 
or not they were going to buy a new 
home, buy a new car, be able to pay for 
their kids to go to college. He believed, 
as my old friend Paul Wellstone would 
say, ‘‘We all do better when we all do 
better.’’ 
He was a giant who led the labor 
movement in America through one of 
the most challenging periods in our 
history, when his leadership was need-
ed the most. 
It is on us now—isn’t it?—those of us 
who think about Rich and what he said 
to us so many times privately, pub-
licly. The responsibility that we have 
is to stand up for the men and women 
who work in this country who don’t 
have a voice otherwise. Our responsi-
bility is to give those in the labor 
movement the respect they deserve for 
fighting for the right cause. 
My wife Loretta and I send our con-
dolences to Rich’s wife Barb and their 
son and family. 
I understand that he was with his 
grandson when he was stricken this 
morning. As a grandfather, I will tell 
you it is a happy moment when you are 
with your grandkids, and that is the 
way it should have been for Rich. 
President Trumka’s friends, his sis-
ters and brothers in the labor move-
ment, and to all the families to whom 
Rich Trumka devoted his life, they and 
we have lost a true champion. 
America is better for Rich Trumka 
having lived and been part of fighting 
for those who worked to make America 
a great nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Massa-
chusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
am here to honor the memory of my 
friend and the friend of every working 
person in America, Rich Trumka. 
We lost Rich this morning, and all I 
kept thinking is the kind of man we 
have lost and what that means to all of 
us. 
Rich was real. He was a third-genera-
tion coal miner who rose to become the 
president of the United Mine Workers 
and the president of the American Fed-
eration of Labor. Rich was also a hun-
ter, and he had the patience of a hun-
ter—the planning, the long hours, 
sometimes long days, but always on his 
target. And Rich was a fighter. He was 
relentless. When Rich got in a fight, 
Rich never gave up. Might not plan 
every one of those fights, at least not 
the first time out, but he never gave 
up.

S5910 
August 5, 2021 
From his growl to his laughter, Rich 
was real all the way through. He lived 
his heart every single day. He was al-
ways Rich. 
Back during the financial crash in 
2008, 2009, we were trying to build an 
idea for a consumer agency to make 
sure that people wouldn’t get cheated 
next time around the way they had 
been, and what led up to that crash. 
Rich was there, and he was there be-
cause he had seen firsthand what it is 
like. He had seen his brothers and sis-
ters in the labor movement, who had 
lost their homes, had lost their jobs, 
and seen their pensions disappear be-
cause a handful of greedy banks and 
feckless regulators had permitted the 
rich and powerful to take over our gov-
ernment and to take over our economy, 
and they brought that economy to its 
knees. It fell hard on working people, 
and Rich was determined that would 
not happen again. 
I remember the day when President 
Obama 
announced 
that 
they 
were 
ready to lay out the first—first out-
lines of what the financial response 
should look like, what kind of laws we 
should pass here in Congress in order 
to make sure that this didn’t come 
again. And there were a bunch of folks 
who were invited to the White House. I 
was invited. It was my first time there. 
I am looking around—wow. 
And a bunch of people crowded, and 
all we cared about was: Hand us the 
list. I want to see what is on it. Is there 
a consumer agency on this? 
And we get in our assigned seats, and 
I am sitting on these tiny, little chairs, 
jammed together so they can get as 
many people as possible. And Rich, who 
was a man of considerable size, is sit-
ting 
directly 
behind 
me, 
kind 
of 
mashed up against the back of my 
chair and leaning out, and we were on 
the aisle, both of us, and furiously 
going through it to see what is there. 
And, sure enough, the White House 
had said there is going to be a con-
sumer agency, or at least that is what 
they are going to ask for. 
So I am smiling. I turn and I say: See 
this? You see this? 
And he said: Yeah. 
And I said: You know, it makes me a 
little nervous for you to be right be-
hind me here. 
And he leaned over and he whispered 
in my ear and he said: I will always 
have your back, Elizabeth. 
And I reached back, patted him on 
the leg. 
And it was true. I never got in a fight 
for working people that Rich Trumka 
wasn’t already there, that he was al-
ready in that fight, that he already saw 
what was happening to working people 
on the ground, and what it was that we 
needed our government to do by way of 
response. 
Rich fought for decades for working 
people. It was his true north. He never 
varied from that. He never wanted any-
thing for himself. All he wanted to do 
was to see workers get more power so 
that they were playing on a level play-
ing field, to see workers be able to 
work in safe conditions, to see workers 
get a chance to build some real secu-
rity for themselves and for their fami-
lies. 
Rich measured everything that came 
his way against that test: What is it 
going to do for working people? And if 
you could show him this is going to 
help working people, Rich was in it all 
the way. 
During COVID–19, Rich was here back 
and forth and back and forth, trying to 
push this government to get more 
workers’ safety in place, more regula-
tions that were going to protect people 
so people weren’t out there dying try-
ing to do their jobs. 
Rich was there, trying to protect the 
economic security of workers, people 
who had been laid off, people who had 
been shut out of the workplace. It was 
Rich who helped lead the charge, watch 
out for working families. 
He didn’t need the glory. He didn’t 
need the spotlight, but, boy, he was in 
there pushing in the way that only 
Rich Trumka could do it. 
Rich understood that when we put 
workers at the center of our policies, 
then families win; when we put work-
ers at the center of our policies, then 
our economy wins; when we put work-
ers at the center of our policies, then 
our Nation wins. That is how Rich 
lived, and that is how Rich died. 
To Rich’s family, I am so sorry for 
your loss. For Rich’s brothers and sis-
ters in the labor movement, I am so 
sorry for your loss. Rich is gone, and 
that is a hard blow to you and to our 
whole Nation, and this is the moment 
to honor Rich’s legacy not just with 
words, but by staying in the fights that 
Rich led us on, by staying in the fights 
relentlessly for workers’ rights. 
We are going to miss Rich. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
since last March, State and local gov-
ernments have received about a half 
trillion dollars in Federal funding to 
bolster their fight against COVID–19. 
Leaders in my State have used this 
funding to cover the mounting costs of 
expenses at the start of the pandemic. 
It enabled them to stand up testing, in-
crease bed space for ICUs and hospitals, 
and provide grants to small businesses 
without the fear of cutting other crit-
ical services. 
As time has gone on, the battle 
against this virus has shifted, and so 
have the needs of my State and our 
local communities. Many simply don’t 
have the continued need or even oppor-
tunity under the guardrails Congress 
imposed to spend this money within 
the set timeline. 
That is especially true in some of the 
rural parts of my State or places where 
COVID numbers are, thankfully, low. 
Qualifying pandemic-related expenses 
are few and far between in some of 
those places, as strange as that may 
sound here in Washington, DC. 
I have heard from State and local 
leaders who are frustrated by the strict 
rules on the funding. They have needs, 
but somehow the limitations that Con-
gress has put on their access to the 
money are stifling their ability to deal 
with priorities that they have at the 
local level. 
They are able to use these dollars on 
some of the tough financial dealings of 
the pandemic, but not all. One of the 
greatest needs they have is to deal 
with 
infrastructure. 
When 
folks 
hunkered down at home to stop the 
spread of COVID–19, State and local 
transportation budgets took a big hit. 
As 
a 
result, 
many 
infrastructure 
projects ended up on the chopping 
block. 
In 2020, States and cities across the 
country delayed or canceled transpor-
tation improvement projects totaling 
about 
$12 
billion. 
Many 
of 
these 
projects are still in limbo. Without suf-
ficient funding, there is no timeline 
when that planned construction might 
actually begin. 
For months now, there has been a 
clear need to bridge the gap. Back in 
March, nearly three dozen organiza-
tions wrote to Treasury Secretary 
Yellen urging her to make transpor-
tation infrastructure an eligible ex-
pense. They said the pandemic had im-
pacted every State and community dif-
ferently, and they wanted and asked 
for flexibility. They said that flexi-
bility will be critical to ensuring funds 
are used expeditiously and with max-
imum impact. 
I have gotten the same sort of re-
quests from the people I represent in 
Texas, so I drafted an amendment to 
this legislation to provide that flexi-
bility. Thankfully, I found a partner in 
Senator ALEX PADILLA of California, 
and our bipartisan amendment, which 
will, I believe, when we vote on it, re-
ceive broad bipartisan support. I am 
hopeful we can vote on that amend-
ment sometime later today. 
This amendment puts decision-mak-
ing power at the local level and gives 
these leaders more flexibility to invest 
in the most critical projects for their 
communities, whatever those might be. 
In some places, that may still mean 
pandemic-related expenses. 
The Delta variant has thrown us a 
curve ball, to be sure, and is surging in 
some places, and leaders in those areas 
are going to continue to use this fund-
ing to bolster the fight against the 
virus. 
But this change doesn’t interfere 
with those plans in any way, because 
what Senator PADILLA and I propose is 
to make that strictly an option—not a 
mandate, but an option—so leaders at 
the State and local level can decide 
what fits their particular need. 
It simply gives States and localities 
that aren’t facing a mountain of 
COVID-related expenses the ability to 
invest this funding in—you guessed it— 
infrastructure projects, something that 
the bill we are currently considering is 
designed to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5911 
August 5, 2021 
But one of the things I have noticed 
since I have been in the Senate is, fre-
quently, we will appropriate money, 
and it takes not just months, but some-
times years to get to the intended ben-
eficiary. I know the Presiding Officer 
has seen with me the fact that we ap-
propriated $46 billion to prevent evic-
tions for people that can’t pay their 
rent, and yet that money has simply 
not made its way to the intended bene-
ficiaries in a timely and expeditious 
way. Hopefully, that will improve. But 
this is money that is available imme-
diately to our local and State officials 
to use now. 
This infrastructure bill, to the credit 
of the bipartisan infrastructure negoti-
ating committee, I think, has some 
good, very positive elements to it. But 
the truth is, what we are doing in this 
bill probably will not flow quickly to 
local jurisdictions in our States, like 
the money that they already have but 
are handcuffed from using for infra-
structure purposes. 
Whether it is widening highways, 
constructing bridges, extending rail-
ways, 
or 
expanding 
access 
to 
broadband, the list of new qualifying 
expenses is a long one. As I said, there 
is simply no requirement that they 
spend a penny on infrastructure if they 
don’t want to or if they think they 
need to hold more of this money that 
the Federal Government has appro-
priated in reserve. All we are doing is 
simply giving them the freedom to use 
these Federal dollars on these projects 
if that makes sense for these commu-
nities. 
Senator PADILLA and I have worked 
with our colleagues to make some 
changes that support a vast array of in-
frastructure projects. We added addi-
tional 
qualifying 
infrastructure 
projects to ensure unique, but no less 
important, needs in the various States 
are eligible. 
The White House initially raised con-
cerns about the amount of funding that 
we might authorize under our amend-
ment, and worried it would take away 
from necessary COVID–19 expenses. 
Well, Senator PADILLA
and I have 
worked with the White House, and I be-
lieve we have come up with a good- 
faith resolution of their concerns and 
our interest in getting this money to 
be available. 
Under our amendment, up to 30 per-
cent of the unspent COVID–19 funds 
would be available to the States and 
local government for infrastructure 
projects. It is difficult to quantify ex-
actly how much of the money will be 
spent on infrastructure projects be-
cause, as I said, the States and local 
governments are not required to spend 
a penny of that money on infrastruc-
ture. 
But should they wish to do so, and 
should local conditions permit, this 
will open up tens of millions of dollars 
for infrastructure projects in commu-
nities across the country. This can help 
critical projects that were delayed by 
the pandemic get back on track and 
put this funding toward its intended 
purpose, the very purpose we are debat-
ing right now, to both alleviate the 
burden of the pandemic on cities and 
States, as well as to refurbish and ex-
pand our critical infrastructure, in-
cluding broadband. 
So this isn’t just a win for our local 
communities; it is a win for taxpayers 
too. 
Here is something that may be a lit-
tle unexpected: The cost of this amend-
ment is zero. It is nothing because the 
money has already been appropriated 
and already been scored on previous 
COVID–19-relief acts. All it does is it 
removes the handcuffs from the local 
jurisdictions and allows them to meet 
their needs based on their best judg-
ment. So this does not increase the def-
icit and does not add to the debt. 
This amendment has been endorsed 
by more than two dozen organizations 
representing a diverse set of stake-
holders. The National Governors Asso-
ciation—which, as you know, is a bi-
partisan group of Governors—has en-
dorsed this amendment. The U.S. Con-
ference of Mayors and a long list of or-
ganizations have thrown their support 
behind this commonsense change. 
This will give communities in Texas 
and Nevada and all the other States 
the ability to use pandemic-relief fund-
ing when and where it is needed most. 
They know the needs of their com-
munities far better than we do sitting 
here in Washington, DC. And I hope 
this amendment will be adopted to give 
these leaders greater decision-making 
flexibility. 
I want to thank Senators on both 
sides of the aisle who have worked with 
Senator PADILLA and myself on this 
amendment. And, later today, I hope 
we will receive broad, bipartisan sup-
port for this amendment. And I antici-
pate we will, because I know the cir-
cumstances in my State dealing with 
my constituents is really no different 
when it comes to giving flexibility and 
access to those Federal COVID–19 dol-
lars, that the story is probably largely 
the same in whatever State you rep-
resent. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD TRUMKA 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, 
before I begin, I want to take a mo-
ment to pause and remember an effec-
tive leader in the labor movement and 
a real champion for working families, 
Richard Trumka. 
Richard Trumka believed in the dig-
nity of work, and he also believed in 
the dignity of workers and that they 
should share in the prosperity they 
provide for others. 
His family is in my prayers as we re-
member and honor his legacy as a vital 
leader in the labor movement and in 
the larger quest to make us a more just 
society, providing opportunity for all 
of us. 
HEALTHCARE 
Madam President, I am back on the 
floor of the Senate because I believe 
that healthcare is a human right, and 
it is certainly something that the rich-
est Nation on the planet can afford to 
provide for all of its citizens. 
I have come to the Senate floor with 
the same message week after week be-
cause I think it is vital and important. 
With all of the incentives on the table 
for my home State of Georgia to ex-
pand Medicaid, it is past time for Geor-
gia and the other 11 nonexpansion 
States to finally expand Medicaid. 
My home State of Georgia has the 
opportunity 
to 
provide 
affordable 
healthcare to 646,000 people who could 
qualify. Instead of allowing Georgians 
to continue to suffer and be cut off 
from care while politicians are playing 
games, I introduced the Medicaid Saves 
Lives Act. This is legislation that 
would provide people in States like 
mine that have not expanded Medicaid 
an alternative path to health coverage. 
In the richest country in the world in 
2021 and amid a once-in-a-century pan-
demic that has both illuminated and 
exacerbated the consequences of long-
standing disparities in healthcare, too 
many Georgians are still struggling to 
get what they deserve and what is al-
ready available if we would just expand 
Medicaid. 
And for far too many, access to af-
fordable, 
reliable, 
and 
continuous 
healthcare is quite literally the dif-
ference between life and death. 
We do policy here, but we can only do 
policy in an effective manner when we 
keep in front of us the human faces be-
hind the policy we would create or the 
consequences for real people when we 
fail to do what we were sent here to do. 
So I want to share the story and re-
member the life of a Georgian who 
fought to expand Medicaid. She and 
other Georgians live in the coverage 
gap. She advocated for herself and oth-
ers like her. 
This is Lorie Davis and her husband 
Bob, both from Covington, GA. Lorie 
was one of our heroes. She spent much 
of her life serving her neighbors as a 
trauma nurse at the Grady Memorial 
Hospital. I have been to that hospital 
time and time again as a pastor and 
now as a Senator. I have seen firsthand 
the important work that they do. 
She was a trauma nurse there at 
Grady, 
and 
while 
working 
as 
a 
healthcare 
professional 
in 
Georgia, 
Lorie was diagnosed with pelvic adhe-
sive disease. The chronic pain associ-
ated with this condition eventually 
pushed her to leave the nursing profes-
sion. 
After that, while also working to 
manage her own chronic condition, 
Lorie struggled to maintain steady em-
ployment in the restaurant industry—a

August 5, 2021 
healthcare professional no longer able 
to serve in her profession as a trauma 
nurse, working as hard as she can, as 
hard as she could in the restaurant in-
dustry. 
She believed in working. She under-
stood the dignity of work. But while 
working, she could not afford health 
insurance. She made too much to qual-
ify for Medicaid but not enough to af-
ford other insurance plans. And while 
in this limbo, Lorie had to wait many 
years for her Social Security disability 
claim to be adjudicated. She finally 
qualified for benefits in 2017, but even 
then, she was unable to qualify for 
Medicaid because of her and Bob’s com-
bined marital income. This left Lorie 
in the coverage gap, unable to purchase 
coverage because it was financially out 
of reach. 
Lorie went without health insurance 
for years, relying on her own medical 
training and free healthcare clinics to 
treat her chronic condition—a trauma 
nurse who had cared for others, unable 
to receive any care. 
Then, in August of 2020, Lorie began 
feeling ill, and her condition got no-
ticeably worse. Fearful of costs, she de-
layed seeking healthcare. Unable to 
follow the advice that she, no doubt, 
had provided to other patients: Seek 
healthcare early. Many things are pre-
ventable if you can get there earlier 
rather than later. She was not able to 
follow her own advice. But I want us to 
think about that. She put off seeking 
the care she needed because she was 
afraid she would not be able to afford 
it. 
As Members of this body, we should 
be ashamed that in the richest Nation 
in the world, a country with all of our 
resources, with all of our medical tech-
nology, 
that 
some 
citizens 
would 
choose not to seek treatment even 
when they know better because they 
fear they cannot afford the pricetag of 
lifesaving care. That is Lorie’s story. 
The next month, in September of 
2020, Lorie was admitted to the hos-
pital with pneumonia. And while there, 
she learned, sadly, that she had lung 
cancer, a treatable condition had she 
received an earlier diagnosis. 
Put together, it was too much. On 
September 17, 2020, Lorie passed away. 
This is the human face of our public 
policy. These are the tragic casualties 
of the games that politicians play. 
As a pastor, I am praying for Lorie’s 
family as they mourn her unspeakable 
and, perhaps, unnecessary loss and the 
legacy she left behind. 
As a Senator who believes that 
healthcare is a human right, a sacred 
obligation, I refuse to stop fighting 
until Georgians, like Lorie Davis, have 
access to the care that they need when 
they need it. 
Like Lorie, who advocated Members 
of this body for healthcare during her 
lifetime, I am committed to gaining 
ground in this fight to improve access 
to healthcare for Georgians in every 
corner of the State. She can no longer 
speak. We must be her voice. 
She is not the only one. There are 
millions of hard-working people all 
across our country who went to school, 
played by the rules, and they don’t 
have access to lifesaving care, costing 
them their lives and costing us more 
money. 
So we need to pass the Medicaid 
Saves Lives Act. It is not just the 
name of a bill; it is actually true, Med-
icaid saves lives. 
Until we get this done, I am going to 
keep lifting up Lorie’s story and the 
stories of others who would benefit 
from this lifesaving legislation. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Pennsyl-
vania. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want 
to address an opportunity that we have 
in this body to fix a flaw in a provision 
in this infrastructure bill. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
Oregon and our colleague from Wyo-
ming. The three of us have been work-
ing on this, and I really hope we get 
this done. I am going to insist on hav-
ing a vote on this. 
Let me just give a little context here. 
So we are all aware of this new cat-
egory of assets some describe as cur-
rencies, 
which 
are 
also 
called 
cryptocurrencies. And this is a fas-
cinating development. Actually, some 
have been around for some time now, 
but they have come into the public eye 
in a much, much bigger way in recent 
years—very recent years. 
And while sometimes we think of 
this as some kind of unit of value that 
is traded and has some pretty spectac-
ular volatility sometimes, for me, 
while that is very interesting, what is 
much more interesting is the under-
lying technology and what that might 
make possible. I am still trying to un-
derstand. I am still on a steep learning 
curve about all the possibilities of the 
distributed 
ledger 
technology, 
the 
methodology 
by 
which 
cryptocurrencies 
can 
be 
exchanged 
without an intermediary. There is no 
bank that the money has to go 
through. 
It is an amazing and fascinating 
technology where individuals scattered 
around the globe actually validate the 
legitimacy of a transaction and it be-
comes immutable. And there is a per-
manent record in some cases. There are 
other models where it is different. But 
this is an amazing technology. It has 
tremendous potential. 
We had a hearing in the Banking 
Committee just last week, at my re-
quest—the chairman agreed to a hear-
ing—where we talked about some of 
the use cases for this underlying tech-
nology, and we heard some amazing 
things. 
So the most common activity now is 
trading in these digital currencies, 
whether it is Bitcoin or Ethereum or 
others. There are many, many of them. 
And that is the biggest single activity, 
but there are very, very important and 
interesting additional use cases that 
are occurring. 
One of the things that I am fas-
cinated by is the potential to have this 
dispersed mechanism for validating 
ownership. Think of all the amount of 
time and money and effort we spend on 
all kinds of transactions where, ulti-
mately, we are trying to validate some-
one’s ownership: the title to their 
house, the title to their car, your own-
ership of the stocks that you bought 
from your broker. 
We have developed very expensive, 
actually, 
and 
sometimes 
time-con-
suming processes by which we do this. 
This can all be done on a blockchain. 
This can all be done almost instantly, 
at almost no cost, and I think that this 
is the direction that we are going to be 
heading in. 
That is just one example. There is 
another whole category that is fas-
cinating to me, which is what people 
refer to as programmable money. 
Think 
about 
it, 
programmable 
money; what is that? Well, here is a 
great example that we heard at our 
hearing from a witness who works for a 
company that actually provides these 
kinds of services. But here is an exam-
ple. You know, one of the things that 
has always been a challenge is, how do 
you ensure that, say, a person who has 
a copyright is properly compensated 
when that copyright is used in one 
form or another? 
I used to have a restaurant. And 
when we played music in the back-
ground to create a certain ambiance in 
our restaurant, how do you make sure 
that the people who have the copyright 
on those songs gets paid properly for 
that? I will tell you, it is a terrible sys-
tem. It is completely arbitrary, and 
there is no precision to it. There is no 
way to monitor it. 
Well, how about an idea where you 
have a programmable capability where, 
if I listen to a music app on my iPhone, 
for every second of a particular artist’s 
music I listen to, it automatically 
sends a corresponding tiny fraction of 
some currency to the person who owns 
that copyright? That is completely do-
able in the context of this kind of tech-
nology. 
I just mention these two things just 
to provide a little, tiny glimpse and il-
lustration of the kinds of amazing 
things that I think this underlying 
technology is capable of, and it is like-
ly going to change the way we do an 
awful lot of things in the coming years. 
I say that as background because in 
this legislation, there is a very reason-
able intent, but I think the drafting 
doesn’t get it quite right. The intent is 
to say: for those exchanges, for those 
places where people go to buy and sell 
cryptocurrencies—and there are cen-
tralized exchanges where that happens 
every day in huge, huge volumes—we 
want to require these exchanges to 
have the same kind of reporting re-
quirements that a conventional broker 
would have when a security is bought.

August 5, 2021 
So, in other words, we want the folks 
who run the exchange to report the 
name, 
some 
identifying 
number— 
maybe it is a Social Security number— 
the dollar amount. And all of this is be-
cause people buying and selling these 
cryptocurrencies are generating cap-
ital gains and losses. It is an asset. If 
you sell it later after a gain, you 
should have to pay a capital gains tax 
on that asset, depending on how long 
you have held it. If you have lost 
money on it, then you ought to be able 
to take that loss against gains that 
you may have elsewhere. 
It is completely reasonable to have a 
provision that requires the reporting of 
the transaction. That, I think, is the 
intent of this legislation. But, unfortu-
nately, the way it got drafted, to my 
reading, and to—I am certainly not 
alone; I think this is almost univer-
sally 
acknowledged—the 
language 
would impose this reporting require-
ment 
on 
people 
involved 
in 
the 
cryptocurrency world who don’t even 
have the information about the person 
making the purchase or the sale. 
So, for instance, it might very well 
be interpreted to impose this reporting 
requirement on the miners, the people 
who are involved in the arithmetic 
process by which you validate trans-
actions. They don’t even know the 
names. They have a numerical rep-
resentation of the transaction. They 
don’t know who is buying it. They have 
no idea. They have no way of knowing. 
So it is not a reasonable—not an even 
slightly reasonable burden to impose 
on them. 
That is one little example of how 
badly flawed this language is. It wasn’t 
intended that way. The good news is, it 
can be fixed. And Senator WYDEN and 
Senator LUMMIS and I have come up 
with language that fixes this problem. 
It would make sure that the reporting 
requirement on a centralized exchange, 
the folks running that who have this 
information, would, in fact, have to re-
port it. They don’t right now. There is 
no statute. There is no regulation that 
requires that. This would require the 
reporting. 
And the industry is fine with that. 
They recognize that they should have 
to report this. But they also recognize 
that it should only be imposed on peo-
ple for whom it makes sense, right? 
The people who actually have that in-
formation. So our amendment address-
es this. It fixes this. It solves this prob-
lem. I think it achieves the intent. And 
we are having a little trouble getting 
the ability to offer this as an amend-
ment here on the Senate floor on this 
bill. 
I am not here to ask that we simply 
adopt it by acclamation. I welcome de-
bate and welcome a vote, but we ought 
to be able to have a vote. We abso-
lutely should have this debate and have 
a vote before we go ahead and impose 
this requirement. And if we were not to 
adopt this amendment, then we could 
be doing a lot of damage. We could 
have a very chilling effect on the devel-
opment of this technology, and that is 
what I am most concerned about. That 
is what I want to avoid. 
This technology is very, very excit-
ing. It has tremendous potential. And 
the last thing we should do is allow a 
flawed drafting exercise to have this 
chilling effect on the further develop-
ment of this technology. 
I see the Senator from Oregon is here 
on the floor, and I want to thank him 
for his leadership on this effort, for his 
work. He and I, I think, have a very 
similar way of viewing this. And if he 
would like to make some comments, I 
will yield some time to him. 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague, 
and I will be brief. 
As Senator TOOMEY has indicated, he 
and Senator LUMMIS
and I have an 
amendment to the infrastructure bill 
dealing with cryptocurrency and taxes. 
And I am going to go into some of the 
philosophical underpinnings of what we 
are doing, but I want to note some-
thing at the outset. 
Our 
amendment, 
this 
bipartisan 
amendment, ought to be accepted when 
the author of the underlying provision 
has said publicly he will vote for it if 
the Senate gets a chance to vote, as 
Senator TOOMEY and I have indicated. 
So let me just outline a couple of 
fundamental propositions about our 
proposal and start with one that ought 
to bring the U.S. Senate together. Peo-
ple avoiding taxes they owe on money 
through cryptocurrencies is a serious 
issue. It is fundamentally unfair to 
every working person whose taxes 
come straight out of their paycheck. 
Now, my view is the Senate needs to 
make sure that new rules addressing 
this tax avoidance ensure that it is 
possible to run down the crooks, have 
strong tax enforcement, while leaving 
a clear field for an innovation here at 
home. 
We want that innovation here. The 
fact is, when you don’t innovate some-
place, it goes somewhere else. We want 
it here at home. 
Without our amendment, this bipar-
tisan amendment, it seems to us that 
essentially the whole notion of dealing 
with tax avoidance somehow is going 
to get lost in approaches for the brick- 
and-mortar rule. And, as I said, those 
rules run the very real risk of chilling 
innovation in the digital economy and 
driving the core innovations in crypto 
to places far beyond the reach of the 
U.S. Treasury and other law enforce-
ment. 
So two sentences about what we do in 
our amendment: We want it stated the 
tax enforcement rules should focus on 
the companies that deal with buying, 
selling, and trading cryptocurrencies. 
These rules don’t need to sweep up 
other uses of blockchain technologies 
that have nothing to do with tax avoid-
ance. 
Senator TOOMEY and I serve on the 
Senate Finance Committee. I am the 
chair; Senator TOOMEY, a senior mem-
ber. We have been struck by how many 
people in that space—the various as-
pects of blockchain technologies—don’t 
even have the tax documents that they 
would have to file, normally, if they 
were one of these big crypto exchanges. 
Now, the fact is, making changes in 
both tech and tax policy is hard work 
that takes time. When I wrote the 
Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act 
that ensured that the rules online and 
the rules offline would be the same, we 
had hearings; we had debates; we fo-
cused on the issues and produced bipar-
tisan legislation. 
The Senate is going to debate these 
issues further in the months and years 
ahead. As the chairman of this com-
mittee, I am open to working with any-
body who wants to show that tough, ef-
fective tax enforcement and promoting 
innovation is not mutually exclusive. 
Smart policy—smart targeted policy— 
will get you both. 
Our amendment simply says that no-
body can use crypto to avoid paying 
the taxes they owe, and anybody acting 
as a broker in the cryptocurrency in-
dustry must comply with reporting re-
quirements, the same as brokers in 
every other industry. That is because 
they are brokers. They are not the peo-
ple who Senator TOOMEY and I have 
been concerned about with going to be 
swept up in this treatment of crypto 
exchanges and the like. 
We advocate a smart, targeted ap-
proach and we make sure that report-
ing requirements, just like brokers in 
every other industry, are complied 
with. That is the kind of policy in the 
crypto area that lays the foundation 
for future debates. 
What Senator TOOMEY
and I are 
doing is very focused in one specific 
area: Making sure we come down hard 
on tax avoidance by brokers and people 
in crypto exchanges, but we also make 
sure we are not discouraging innova-
tion in other areas. 
This is going to be a debate that is 
going to play out over the years, but 
when the author of the provision in the 
bipartisan proposal on crypto, the au-
thor of the underlying provision in the 
legislation in front of us today, has 
publicly said in the last few hours he 
will vote for what Senator TOOMEY, 
Senator LUMMIS, and I have developed, 
we certainly ought to get a vote. My 
own view is it ought to be accepted by 
this body. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Reclaiming my time. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
Oregon for his thoughtful leadership on 
this. 
I thank the Senator from Wyoming. 
Senator LUMMIS, is on her way down. 
She is going to join us, as she has been 
an integral part of this effort to just 
correct this. 
This is a big deal in a number of re-
spects. I would point out—I want to 
stress, right now there is no statutory 
reporting requirement in this whole 
space. There is no regulatory require-
ment. I don’t think you could have a 
regulatory requirement without a stat-
ute authorizing it.

August 5, 2021 
So this is a big deal. It would require 
the companies operating these ex-
changes to report this financial infor-
mation so that it dramatically en-
hances the likelihood that capital 
gains taxes would be collected. This 
provision scores as a source of revenue 
because it increases the likelihood of 
compliance. 
I don’t know why anyone would ob-
ject. I am not aware of any objection of 
the substance of this on my side of the 
aisle. I know Senator WYDEN has like- 
minded folks on his side of the aisle. 
It is really important that we not 
overreach, that we not do this wrong. 
We have not gone through the ordinary 
process for developing tax legislation. 
Tax legislation is notoriously com-
plicated and difficult to get exactly 
right and prone to unintended con-
sequences. 
Normally, we have hearings in the 
Finance Committee. We get input from 
all kinds of experts. We make drafts. 
We circuit the drafts. It is a long proc-
ess to make sure you get it right. This 
has gone through none of that, zero. 
What we are trying to do is say let’s 
restrict this to where it belongs, let’s 
clean this up the best we can. 
You know what? 
This space is changing. A year from 
now, there will be new innovations we 
haven’t thought of, that probably no-
body has thought of, and we will prob-
ably have to go back and revisit this. 
What 
we 
wouldn’t 
want 
to 
do— 
shouldn’t want to do—is have an overly 
broad mandate, a reporting require-
ment on people who can’t possibly 
comply with it because they don’t have 
the information. We wouldn’t want to 
impose that and have a stifling impact 
on the development of a really, really 
exciting and potentially powerful new 
technology. That is what this is about. 
As I said earlier, I am going to insist 
on having a vote on this. I don’t know 
why we wouldn’t win by a big margin 
since, after all, we are just ensuring 
that we get the intent of this legisla-
tion rather than a miscarriage of it. 
As the Senator from Oregon pointed 
out, Senator PORTMAN from Ohio, who 
has worked so long and so hard on this 
infrastructure bill, supports us getting 
a vote on this. He supports the amend-
ment that we have drafted. 
I am hopeful that this is going to 
pass. I will be insistent that we get our 
vote. That is something we ought to 
do. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SURVIVORS’ BILL OF RIGHTS ACT 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. I had intended to 
come to the floor earlier today with 
Senator GRASSLEY so that we could 
talk about our legislation that we are 
introducing this week, that would 
build upon our efforts to protect the 
survivors of sexual assault in the 
criminal justice system. 
Unfortunately, I got delayed, but 
Senator GRASSLEY
was here on the 
floor. I want to recognize all of his ef-
forts to address this critical issue, and 
appreciate, again, his willingness to 
work with me. 
The effort to extend rights for sexual 
assault survivors across the country is 
critically important, and I am hopeful 
that when the bill that we introduced 
gets to the floor, that all of our col-
leagues will join us in passing this bi-
partisan legislation. 
I first became involved in the pre-
cursor to this legislation in 2015, when 
a 
young 
woman 
named 
Amanda 
Nguyen of the Rise organization con-
tacted my office. She had been trav-
eling from office to office here in the 
Senate, trying to find somebody to lis-
ten to her story. 
Amanda is a survivor of sexual as-
sault, and she is a fierce advocate for 
change in the way our criminal justice 
system treats survivors. When she de-
tailed her harrowing story of sexual as-
sault and subsequent interactions with 
the criminal justice system, it was 
very clear something had to change. 
Amanda described a system that fur-
ther traumatized survivors and pro-
vided scarce protection of their rights. 
Evidence of assaults was being de-
stroyed without survivors even know-
ing about it, and survivors were forced 
to periodically follow up with law en-
forcement to preserve evidence of their 
assaults. 
The broken process that survivors 
were forced to endure resulted in a sys-
tem where they were often revictim-
ized. This system forced survivors to 
confront the trauma of reliving their 
attacks each time they sought to pre-
serve evidence or gather information 
about their cases. 
Working with Amanda, I introduced 
the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Rights 
Act to ensure survivors were guaran-
teed basic rights while pursuing jus-
tice. The legislation created the first 
legally recognized set of rights for sur-
vivors to enforce in a court of law. 
I am so grateful that Senator GRASS-
LEY worked on this effort with me, and 
he included the legislation in the Adam 
Walsh Reauthorization Act so that it 
could be signed into law. 
The legislation that we passed back 
in 2015–2016 provided survivors with 
greater protections in Federal cases 
with a focus on notice, access, and the 
preservation of sexual assault evidence 
collection kits. 
By creating this set of court-enforce-
able rights at the Federal level, Con-
gress established a model for all States 
to adopt similar legislation to protect 
the rights of survivors. And that has 
happened in many States, including in 
my home State of New Hampshire. 
States have adopted legislation to 
guarantee 
survivors 
certain 
basic 
rights in the criminal justice system. 
Unfortunately, we have a lot of other 
States that have not followed suit and 
don’t have legislation that protects 
survivors. That is why the bill that 
Senator GRASSLEY and I came to the 
floor today to discuss is just so impor-
tant. 
The Survivors’ Bill of Rights in the 
States Act would establish a grant pro-
gram accessible to States that have in 
place a law which guarantees the 
rights contained in the Sexual Assault 
Survivors’ Rights Act. States could 
then use the funds to implement sur-
vivor rights, preserve sexual assault 
evidence collection kits, reduce the 
backlog of kits, and provide support for 
victim services. 
Now is the time to pass this legisla-
tion. The risk of sexual assault and do-
mestic violence has increased during 
this coronavirus pandemic. We can 
look at any of the statistics and they 
show us that. 
We need to ensure that States pro-
vide the same level of protection for 
these survivors as they receive at the 
Federal level. No survivor should be 
compelled to bear the indignity of peti-
tioning law enforcement merely to en-
sure that they are given a fair shake in 
the criminal justice process. 
It is my hope that this legislation 
will lead to an increase in States pass-
ing bills that protect survivors’ rights. 
Let’s again show survivors that Con-
gress is behind them and that we will 
stand up for their rights. Let’s pass the 
Survivors’ Bill of Rights in the States 
Act. 
Again, I want to thank Senator 
GRASSLEY for all of his efforts. I hope 
together, with the support of other 
sponsors in this body, that we can get 
this bill across the finish line. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
would like to ask unanimous consent 
to speak as if in morning business for, 
let’s say, 22 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
these speeches on the scheme by dark 
money interests to seize control of the 
Supreme Court are designed to describe 
it in all its repulsive intricacy. 
My last speech discussed an oper-
ation in this scheme within the Fed-
eralist Society. This speech will take 
you literally down the hall from the 
Federalist Society to something called 
the Judicial Crisis Network, or JCN. 
They share the same purpose, the same 
hallway, and likely the same control-
ling donors. 
Remember David Koch’s disastrous 
bid for Vice President on the Liber-
tarian Party ticket that showed how 
unappetizing his rightwing extremism 
was to normal people. And remember 
the Lewis Powell playbook, which ad-
vised: 
Strength lies in organization . . . and in 
the political power available only through 
united action and national organizations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5915 
August 5, 2021 
No one corporation or wealthy indi-
vidual needs to, as Powell said, ‘‘get 
too far out in front and . . . make itself 
too 
visible 
a 
target.’’ 
Let 
inter-
mediaries do that work. 
Corporate interests like Big Tobacco 
and the fossil fuel industry have, for a 
long time, used coordinated webs of na-
tional front groups in their plots to 
fend off accountability for the dangers 
of tobacco and carbon emissions. 
These front group webs grew and 
multiplied and specialized, all while 
concealing their true interests and 
funders. They got more numerous, and 
they also got smarter and more stra-
tegic over time, polishing up front 
group names, like the not-too-subtle 
Tobacco Institute, to names like the 
more wholesome-sounding Heartland 
Institute. 
It is quite a web. They created 
science groups to counter real sci-
entific research on public health and 
climate change with fake science; 
think tanks to churn out white papers 
and hire sound bite-friendly fake ex-
perts; legal organizations to challenge 
and delay government regulation of 
harmful products; academic hothouses 
in which to grow donor-friendly, right-
wing judicial philosophies; identity- 
laundering screens to hide the true do-
nors and controllers and their inter-
ests; and political attack groups to 
pressure elected officials. People who 
study this have reported these groups 
numbering in multiple dozens, and 
their backers play the front groups like 
keys on a piano. 
Apply this method to the scheme to 
capture the Court, and you see that the 
dark money donors needed more than 
just the nominations turnstile that 
they ran out of the Federalist Society. 
They also needed a bare-knuckle polit-
ical brawler. 
One night in early 2005, at an upscale 
Italian dinner, with special guest Jus-
tice Antonin Scalia, major donor and 
corporate lawyer Ann Corkery, Cali-
fornia real estate tycoon Robin Arkley, 
and Federalist Society executive vice 
president Leonard Leo got together 
and celebrated George W. Bush’s sec-
ond term. The political importance of 
the Supreme Court would have been on 
everyone’s mind there as it was the 
five Republicans on the Supreme Court 
who gave George W. Bush his first 
term. 
According 
to 
reporting 
by 
OpenSecrets and the Daily Beast, this 
dinner linked to the creation of a 
501(c)(4) dark money group, then called 
the Judicial Confirmation Network. By 
the end of that year, this group would 
spend money—lots of money, lots of big 
donor money—and they would spend it 
anonymously, first to boost John Rob-
erts as Chief Justice and then Samuel 
Alito as Associate Justice, cementing 
rightwing corporate control over the 
Court and shifting its decisions further 
in big donors’ favor. 
There are a few things to note about 
the Judicial Confirmation Network’s 
early days: 
One, it began work fast. Just months 
after starting, JCN ads hit the air in 
support of Bush nominees. 
Two, it had lots of money. Beginning 
in 2008, Ann Corkery took control of 
something called the Wellspring Com-
mittee—a dark money, identity-laun-
dering group, seeded with funding from 
Charles and David Kochs’ donor net-
work. Thereafter, Wellspring funneled 
seven- or eight-figure dark money do-
nations to JCN every year—millions of 
anonymous dollars. 
Three, they brought on a lawyer with 
heavy rightwing chops to run the 
place. Wendy Long, a former clerk to 
Justice Clarence Thomas, became chief 
counsel and mouthpiece. 
Thus, in just a few months, JCN ap-
peared and became a polished, power-
ful, anonymized campaigner for the big 
donor scheme to take over the Court. 
And 
then 
came 
the 
election 
of 
Barack Obama, and JCN had to go from 
offense for nominees to defense against 
nominees. That ‘‘C’’ in JCN, for ‘‘con-
firmation,’’ 
no 
longer 
made 
much 
sense, and the scheme now faced a cri-
sis—the crisis for it of a President 
nominating judges who had not been 
screened by them, judges whose fealty 
to the corporate rightwing could not be 
confirmed, judges who might even rule 
against the rightwing donors’ agenda. 
So they quickly rebranded JCN as the 
Judicial Crisis Network, but even in 
the Obama years, the Republican 5-to- 
4 majority on the captured Court deliv-
ered big things for JCN and its secre-
tive backers. 
In the administration’s first term, 
the Roberts Court handed down Citi-
zens United and other decisions open-
ing donor pipelines to 501(c)(4) groups 
like JCN. This caused the tsunami of 
slime we saw in our politics, and cor-
porations and rightwing donors rushed 
to the feast. Anonymous money flooded 
in. 
Annual 
donations 
laundered 
through Wellspring to JCN rose from 
millions of dollars to many millions of 
dollars. JCN even expanded the scheme 
to seek to influence State supreme 
courts and State attorney general 
seats. The scheme was flourishing. 
Then, on a 2016 all-expenses-paid trip 
for Justice Scalia to a luxury hunting 
ranch in Texas, the Justice died, leav-
ing a Supreme Court vacancy, with the 
better part of a year left before the 
Presidential election. Now there really 
was a crisis. The big donors suddenly 
faced the prospect of a Democratic 
President appointing Scalia’s replace-
ment, shifting the balance of the Court 
5 to 4 against them, taking away their 
precious majority, undoing the scheme. 
So the donors swung into action. 
Within days, MITCH MCCONNELL quick-
ly pledged to hold the seat open, and 
within days, Republican Senators uni-
formly lined up behind that decision— 
a decision very possibly explained by 
the overlay between dark money do-
nors to the scheme and dark money do-
nors to Republican Senate political op-
erations. History will have to judge the 
extent of that overlay. 
In any event, dark money funding of 
JCN hit escape velocity during this pe-
riod. According to tax records obtained 
by OpenSecrets and others, JCN re-
ceived big donations in fiscal year 2015 
to 2016. One single anonymous donation 
alone totaled $17.9 million. Wellspring 
separately channeled $23.5 million in 
dark money to JCN in 2016, then an-
other $14.8 million the next year. When 
Wellspring dissolved in 2018, big slugs 
of dark money continued to flow 
through other conduits. JCN received 
four separate, individual, anonymous 
donations, each of $15 million or more 
following Justice Scalia’s death. We 
cannot say for sure because the donors 
hide behind the dark money screen, but 
these donations, over $60 million in all, 
could well have all come from the same 
donor. 
And one wonders, what are the odds 
that someone willing to spend $60 mil-
lion anonymously to influence the 
makeup of the Supreme Court is some-
one who has business before the Court? 
Pretty high, I would say, but dark 
money scheming keeps this informa-
tion secret. 
How did JCN spend all this money? 
Attack. Leonard Leo’s Federalist Soci-
ety operation had handed Trump a list 
of approved nominees. JCN spending 
poured into TV ads, pressuring Sen-
ators, and to media blitzes to sell the 
Federalist Society list. The group 
spent $7 million to attack Merrick Gar-
land; $10 million to boost Neil Gorsuch; 
$10 million or more to prop up Brett 
Kavanaugh’s deeply troubled nomina-
tion with its—now we know—fake FBI 
tip line; and $10 million in under 2 
months to support Amy Coney Barrett. 
On its own, this anonymous $37 mil-
lion barrage smells terrible, but it is 
only part of the Judicial Crisis Net-
work operation. JCN has a corporate 
twin, the Judicial Education Project, 
each group backing up the actions and 
finances of the other. Let me walk you 
through this setup because it is a cap-
sule summary of how political schem-
ing is accomplished in our corrupted 
dark money era. 
First, you pair a 501(c)(3) and a 
501(c)(4). The Judicial Crisis Network 
was chartered as a 501(c)(4) social wel-
fare group, the Judicial Education 
Project as its allied 501(c)(3) nonprofit 
organization. Under a perverse reading 
of the law, the 501(c)(4) organization is 
allowed to operate as a dark money po-
litical attack group. We see this ar-
rangement commonly now in the clan-
destine world of dark money politics. 
In fact, a recent Supreme Court case 
about dark money was brought by a 
group called Americans for Prosperity 
Foundation, which was the 501(c)(3) as-
sociated with Americans for Pros-
perity, which is the Koch brothers’ 
501(c)(4) that spent millions of dollars 
to help Amy Coney Barrett get her 
seat, and yet she didn’t recuse herself 
from the case involving the 501(c)(3). 
So, second, you operate the two as 
one unit: Judicial Crisis Network and

Judicial Education Project are con-
nected by staff, by dollars, and by loca-
tion. 
According to the most recent tax 
records, 
long-serving 
JCN 
staffer 
Carrie Severino is also the sole and 
principal officer of—you guessed it— 
the 
Judicial 
Education 
Project. 
Severino is not listed on JCN’s tax 
forms, but she serves as its public-fac-
ing ‘‘chief counsel and policy director.’’ 
JCN and JEP tax records both list the 
same 
address 
in 
Washington, 
DC, 
which, by the way, is right down the 
hall from the Federalist Society at the 
same address, and both groups share 
day-to-day staff. There is a doctrine in 
the law called piercing the corporate 
veil. In this case, the corporate veil be-
tween these two is a web of holes. 
What is the next thing you do? You 
soak up dark money together. 
It is hard to know much about these 
two groups’ dark money funding—that 
is why they keep it dark—but we know 
the Wellspring Committee has funded 
both groups. Both have also paid 
money to something called BH Group, 
which is a mysterious LLC that Leon-
ard Leo once disclosed as his employer, 
that made a $1 million mystery dona-
tion to Trump’s inaugural. It seems to 
do no other business. They used the 
501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) status precisely 
because it lets them hide their donors 
and controllers. 
And the last thing is that you get to 
play shell games with your name. A 
couple of years ago, those two organi-
zations formally changed their legal 
names in Virginia. Now, follow this for 
a minute. Judicial Crisis Network 
changed its name, and it became the 
Concord 
Fund. 
Judicial 
Education 
Project changed its name, and it be-
came the 85 Fund. 
The Concord Fund then registered its 
old name, Judicial Crisis Network, as 
what is called a fictitious name, a kind 
of corporate alias under Virginia law, 
and continued to operate as the Judi-
cial Crisis Network. 
Here is the Virginia law that allows 
them to do that: 
A fictitious name is a name that a person 
(individual or business entity) uses instead 
of the person’s true name, usually in the 
course of transacting or offering to transact 
business. 
It also registered the name ‘‘Honest 
Elections Project Action’’ as an addi-
tional fictitious name to carry out a 
new voter suppression project. The 85 
Fund likewise registered its old name, 
the ‘‘Judicial Education Project,’’ as a 
fictitious name, and it separately reg-
istered 
as 
the 
‘‘Honest 
Elections 
Project’’ as an additional fictitious 
name. 
It gets even better than this because, 
as I said before, when the Washington 
Post exposed the $250 million scheme 
that Leonard Leo was at the center of 
to pack and control the Supreme 
Court, to capture it like a captured 
agency, he wasn’t much use any longer. 
He was like a blown agent in a covert 
operation. He had to go someplace. 
Where did he hop to? He hopped from 
the Federalist Society to the Honest 
Elections Project so he could get to 
work on the Presiding Officer’s favorite 
cause, voter suppression. Same guy, 
same corporate network, new name, 
and new purpose: voter suppression. 
As if this weren’t enough, both of 
these groups have now filed new ficti-
tious names. This is to help them wade 
into the rightwing fuss over what the 
rightwing likes to call critical race 
theory. So the Concord Fund has now 
added the fictitious name ‘‘Free to 
Learn Action,’’ and the 85 Fund has 
now added the fictitious name ‘‘Free to 
Learn.’’ Again, you see the pairing of 
the 501(c)(3) and the 501(c)(4) as part of 
the basic structure for dark money po-
litical influence operations. 
By the way, the same person filled 
out all these forms for both organiza-
tions and is listed with various titles 
on each. 
So now we have one group that calls 
itself the Concord Fund that operates 
simultaneously as the Judicial Crisis 
Network, the Honest Elections Project 
Action, and the Free to Learn Action, 
and we have a sister organization, the 
85 Fund, that operates simultaneously 
as the Judicial Education Project, the 
Honest Elections Project, and Free to 
Learn—all with overlapping staff, loca-
tions, and funding. 
By the way, when you are the funder 
of these groups, you are their con-
troller. 
Now, imagine this level of com-
plexity multiplied many times over, 
because that is what the Washington 
Post disclosed. And I borrow a photo-
graph from their video of their inves-
tigation. 
That Washington Post expose´ on the 
covert court-capture operation exposed 
the Judicial Crisis Network as one 
part, just one part of a massive—there 
it is, Judicial Crisis Network—one part 
of a massive web of groups, a web of 
groups that took in over $250 million in 
dark money between 2014 and 2017. 
This effort to capture the Supreme 
Court? They are not kidding around. 
Spending $250 million in dark money is 
a serious investment that demands a 
serious return. And guess what. Expert 
testimony before my Senate Courts 
Subcommittee has since raised that 
number to $400 million through 2018. 
Through all these allied and coordi-
nated front groups—the keys on the 
dark money piano that the big donors 
can play in chords and singly as they 
wish—dark money donors can, from 
hiding, covertly channel tens if not 
hundreds of millions of dollars in 
anonymized 
money 
toward 
the 
scheme’s court-capture goals. 
Colleagues, this is a scheme akin in 
complexity and trade craft to an intel-
ligence agency covert operation—only 
this one is not being run by one coun-
try against another; this one is being 
run in and against our own country by 
a handful of creepy billionaires and 
their foundations, trying to impose 
their self-serving ideology on the rest 
of us through our least democratic 
branch—the branch that doesn’t care if 
normal people hate this stuff because 
they are in robes for life. That is our 
Federal courts, and particularly, it is 
our Supreme Court. 
The big dark money donors have 
pretty well pulled it off, too, following 
Lewis Powell’s old admonition to use 
‘‘strength . . . in organization’’ and 
‘‘united action’’ of all of this com-
plexity. They have just made it all 
clandestine, which is why I am going to 
keep digging. 
To be continued. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD TRUMKA 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleagues in saying I 
am deeply saddened to learn of the 
passing of my great friend Richard 
Trumka. 
To say Rich was a champion for 
workers is really an understatement. 
He dedicated his life to fighting to se-
cure and strengthen workers’ rights. 
Everyone who knew Rich knew just 
how deeply committed he was to that 
mission. He understood how hard peo-
ple in this country work for their fami-
lies. He understood the dignity of 
work. He grew up understanding it. His 
grandfather was a coal miner, his fa-
ther was a coal miner, and so was he. 
It is because he knew how hard peo-
ple across the country work that he 
was driven to work so hard himself, to 
hold 
Washington 
accountable 
and 
make sure our country was looking out 
for working families. 
For decades, Rich led the charge in 
creating a country that treats all 
workers with the dignity and respect 
they deserve and where every worker 
had the right to join a union, including 
by fighting to root out systemic in-
equities and racism in this country. 
Rich once said: 
There’s no evil that’s inflicted more pain 
and more suffering than racism and it’s 
something we in the labor movement have a 
special responsibility to challenge. 
He worked to live up to that chal-
lenge and to push others as well, and 
this country is better because of it. 
I have worked with Rich for years 
and seen firsthand how hard he fought 
every day to make sure workers had a 
seat at the table on healthcare, edu-
cation, taxes, climate change. What-
ever the issue, you could expect to hear 
from Rich because of how those issues 
affected working people. 
I will always remember working to-
gether to develop and draft the PRO 
Act, which embodied our vision to give 
workers and their families a fair shot 
in this country—something Rich not 
only fought for every day, but, in my 
mind, will always be remembered for 
on this floor, in the halls, and all 
across our country. 
If you didn’t hear him in a meeting, 
you would hear him over the bullhorn 
soon enough because he was as com-
fortable on a picket line as he was in a

boardroom or in the Halls of Congress, 
if not more comfortable, which is why, 
even as Rich shaped national policy 
conversations and led one of the Na-
tion’s biggest unions in the country 
through some of the most trying times 
in its history, including a recession and 
a pandemic, his legacy stretches far be-
yond his legislative accomplishments 
and beyond his leadership of the AFL– 
CIO, and it will stretch onward still as 
we continue his lifetime work of fight-
ing for our workers. That is how we can 
honor Rich’s legacy. 
Rich may have been a recognizable 
face on television, especially with his 
mustache; he may have met with Presi-
dents regularly; he may have changed 
the history of our Nation for the bet-
ter; but perhaps the most remarkable 
thing is, even at his tallest, he never 
talked down to people. Even at his big-
gest, he fought for the small. Even 
after all that he accomplished, he 
never stopped fighting to do more, 
which is why we must not either. 
My heart goes out to his wife Bar-
bara and his son Rich Junior during 
this tragic time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to talk about the process that we 
are in here; first of all, the process that 
brings us the legislation that is before 
us. 
Now, I respect my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle have come together to 
draft the legislation that we have been 
debating on and off, voting even less, 
but that process shortchanges, I think, 
the Senate and the American people. 
It is a process that our colleagues— 
well-intentioned and working incred-
ibly hard but had no geographic diver-
sity, had no ethnic diversity, had no 
racial diversity, and that is consequen-
tial. It is consequential in the legisla-
tion that we are dealing before us. For 
example, this legislation does very well 
in taking care of dealing with aban-
doned mines, but it doesn’t do all that 
well 
with 
dealing 
with 
Superfund 
sites—the sites that most Americans 
who happen to be from disadvantaged 
communities ultimately reside along. 
This legislation does much to help 
with the challenges of wildfires in our 
country, which I support, but doesn’t 
do very much for the questions of 
flooding—flooding 
that 
takes 
place 
along the Mississippi, flooding that 
takes place in Louisiana, flooding that 
takes place in my home State of New 
Jersey and along the Atlantic coast. 
So that lack of diversity is not only 
consequential in terms of the legisla-
tion—geographic, ethnic, and racial—it 
is also consequential to disadvantaged 
communities. 
For too long, our infrastructure and 
transportation system have often been 
used to divide communities, split com-
munities, 
where 
a 
highway 
goes 
through it and ultimately divides the 
community into the ‘‘right side of the 
track’’ and ‘‘wrong side of the track.’’ 
This was an opportunity to actually 
change that dynamic. This was an op-
portunity to create equity in our infra-
structure system, to make sure that 
those divided communities no longer 
were divided and that all of them had a 
highway to opportunity, to make sure 
that transit access to minority com-
munities struggling for employment 
could be realized. Even though, you 
know, there is a transit provision, it is 
$9 billion less than what we were origi-
nally told, but other elements are 
much, much higher. 
Those provisions not only have a con-
sequence to the communities for which 
transit mobility is a critical element 
in order for employment, it often deals 
with minority communities that find 
themselves disadvantaged in terms of 
mobility for minority communities to 
opportunities for employment. 
Look at the pay-fors. The pay-fors, it 
is pretty remarkable, one of them par-
ticularly ends a rebate that is supposed 
to ultimately end up for consumers at 
the prescription drug counter. I often 
hear from people across the spectrum 
that we need to ultimately ensure that 
the cost of prescription drugs are low-
ered, but then here we have a pay-for 
that has absolutely nothing to do with 
lowering the cost of prescription drugs. 
Then I hear that, ‘‘well, we are wait-
ing for amendments.’’ Well, I have bi-
partisan amendments, amendments on 
flooding, amendments on our national 
ferry system that many parts of our 
Nation 
depend 
upon, 
amendments 
about eligibility for bus terminals; and 
they are bipartisan, but the gate-
keepers are keeping us away. 
Here we are. It is 5:30 in the evening. 
We have yet to vote on one single 
amendment. We have yet to vote on 
anything today. So this cannot be the 
process by which the world’s most de-
liberative body operates under. 
And I just want to serve notice that, 
as it relates to this Senator, this Sen-
ator has no intention of supporting leg-
islation that comes through this proc-
ess again and that ultimately does not 
have that diversity of geography, of 
ethnicity, of race. It doesn’t have a 
committee process which provides for 
that diversity to be represented and 
those points of view. I may not win, 
but I would like to have my point of 
view and those of the communities I 
represent have a shot. After all, that is 
what the American dream is all about, 
having a shot at it. 
So 5:30, no votes. This is a fantastic 
process, but one that I can serve notice 
on, I have no intention of supporting in 
the future. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of two nominations to critical 
positions within the Department of 
Homeland Security: Robert Silvers to 
be the Under Secretary for Strategy, 
Policy and Plans; and Jonathan Meyer 
to be General Counsel. 
Both nominees are well qualified for 
these important roles, and both of 
them have strong bipartisan support, 
including from former national secu-
rity officials who served both under 
Democratic and Republican Presidents. 
Mr. Silver’s public service includes 
several senior roles in the Department 
of Homeland Security, including Dep-
uty Chief of Staff and Assistant Sec-
retary for Cyber Policy during the 
Obama administration. 
As a lawyer in the private sector 
since 2017, Mr. Silvers has been a leader 
on cybersecurity, data privacy, and ar-
tificial intelligence issues. As Under 
Secretary for Strategy, Policy and 
Plans, Mr. Silvers will help the Depart-
ment to take a strategic and coordi-
nated approach to address challenging 
policy areas, including domestic ter-
rorism, border security, and cybersecu-
rity. 
Jonathan Meyers’ previous govern-
ment service spans 17 years and in-
cludes senior roles in the Department 
of Justice, the U.S. Senate, and as Dep-
uty General Counsel for DHS during 
the Obama administration. Since re-
turning to private practice in 2016, Mr. 
Meyers’ legal work has continued to 
focus on cybersecurity, technology, 
and Homeland Security. 
DHS 
needs 
qualified 
Senate-con-
firmed leaders in place to effectively 
carry out its critical mission of safe-
guarding our Nation, and I urge my 
colleagues to confirm these qualified 
nominees today. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to execu-
tive session to consider the following 
nomination: Calendar No. 158; that the 
nomination be confirmed, the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate, that no further mo-
tions be in order to the nominations, 
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action, and the 
Senate then resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I do 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Reserving the right 
to object. 
I would say this is a complicated 
issue to walk through the issues of im-
migration, and there are a lot of ques-
tions that hang out there. Secretary 
Mayorkas was in front of our com-
mittee on May 13 to be able to walk 
through the issues we are facing. 
Just as a quick review, we had a 
record number of people illegally cross 
the border in March. That was beaten 
in April. That was beaten in May. That 
was beaten in June. That was beaten in 
July. 
In July, we had 210,000 people ille-
gally cross our border, that we know 
of.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5918 
August 5, 2021 
The DHS, in a recent court filing— 
actually filed in a court filing where 
they made this statement: 
Based on current trends, the Department 
expects that total encounters this fiscal year 
are likely to be the highest ever recorded. 
. . . The Department also expects that these 
numbers will climb even higher if the CDC 
Order [Title 42] is enjoined. 
There is a real issue that is going on. 
So when Ale Mayorkas was in front of 
our committee, our committee had di-
rect jurisdiction for oversight in what 
is happening in Homeland Security. 
There have been a lot of changes that 
have been done this year in how we are 
enforcing or not enforcing the border. 
We have record numbers of individ-
uals crossing the border. The border 
wall and that whole infrastructure, as 
well as the technology on the southern 
border, 
all 
the 
construction 
has 
stopped on that. The best we can tell, 
we have spent $2 billion this year not 
building the wall. 
Currently, it is not getting better. It 
continues to be able to get worse. We 
have 10,000 migrants in the Rio Grande 
Valley currently being held right now. 
That is 783 percent overcapacity in the 
Rio Grande Valley right now. 
And on the Interior enforcement side 
with ICE—we have 6,000 ICE agents— 
and the last number that we saw last 
month, they did 3,000 deportations 
among 6,000 ICE agents in a month. 
The standard for them to actually 
interdict, detain, or deport an indi-
vidual has now reached such a high 
standard that they have to contact re-
gional leadership and ask permission 
by name to be able to interdict some-
one. 
That has dramatically slowed down 
what is happening in Interior enforce-
ment, what is happening at our border 
area. 
And as we continue to be able to 
watch the number of individuals cross 
our border that are COVID positive, we 
have this odd situation where the Na-
tion and the President are talking to 
companies and telling companies, ‘‘you 
need to mandate vaccines and you need 
to mandate masks,’’ when at the whole 
time we are literally bringing people 
from all over the world across our 
southern border and releasing them 
into the United States. 
We have legitimate questions that 
need to be answered. May 13, when Ale 
Mayorkas was in front of our Com-
mittee, there were multiple questions 
that I had. It was a very cordial inter-
change and very frank going through 
the issues. I asked him very specific 
questions for specific numbers. 
He said: I will follow up with that. 
We wrote him a list of specific ques-
tions and asked for specific answers for 
that. To their credit, 2 months later— 
2 months later—we got a list of an-
swers to the questions that I had 
asked. That was 24 hours ago. 
The very specific answer on the 
issues—I asked about the volunteer 
force in DHS. The humanitarian excep-
tions to Title 42, including the policy 
documents, they were very commend-
able on how they actually answered 
those. 
To DHS, I would ask specific ques-
tions on how they are handling sex of-
fenders, because ICE agents have told 
me over and over again sex offenders 
are not being interdicted in the num-
bers they were in the past. They gave 
us very specific answers on that. 
But the problem was, half of the 
questions they gave us answers to and 
half they did not. For instance, we 
asked about the study that they start-
ed January 20th on the border wall. 
That study was supposed to be 60 days. 
It has now been more than 200 days. We 
just asked for the status of that study 
and, if we could see any of it, what 
were the findings. 
Instead, I was sent a press release 
that they had put out. That is not what 
I need. In fact, that press release was 
copied in multiple places in the docu-
ment to say ‘‘this is responsive.’’ That 
is not responsive. 
There is a new process that has been 
put in place by this DHS called notice 
to report, where literally there is a 
large number of people crossing the 
border at once. They are taking those 
individuals 
out, 
doing 
biometrics, 
background checks and releasing them 
into the country with the statement of: 
Turn yourself in at an ICE office some-
where in the country. 
No administration has ever done 
that. As far as we can tell, 55,000 people 
this year have been released into the 
country under a notice to report. That 
is a new process that is undefined. The 
questions we asked about that were 
completely unresponsive. 
The Supreme Court made a decision 
on what is called a notice to appear 
just this year that should change the 
process from how DHS handles notice 
to appear. We asked very specific ques-
tions on how DHS is handling this issue 
based on the Supreme Court decision 
that was made a few months ago. They 
were completely unresponsive on that. 
We asked about cost analysis for the 
border construction, what is happening 
on eminent domain on those issues and 
areas where they are choosing not to 
do eminent domain, and they were 
completely unresponsive to that. 
So literally half our questions they 
answered completely, and half our 
questions they sent us fluff. 
I am the only one who is holding this 
up—I am very aware—but it is also my 
committee of jurisdiction that specifi-
cally has border management. I am the 
one who is supposed to ask these ques-
tions, and I am asking these questions, 
and they are not unreasonable ques-
tions. 
We are just asking to be able to get 
an answer to the questions so we can 
figure out what is the process and what 
is happening. 
As recently as today, I learned that 
ICE is currently looking at a facility in 
western Oklahoma to do what they are 
calling a surge overflow temporary fa-
cility. That surge overflow temporary 
facility they are looking to open is in 
western Oklahoma, to move people 
from the border, process them in west-
ern Oklahoma, and then release them 
from western Oklahoma. 
It is not an unfair question for me to 
ask: What is this facility? What is its 
purpose? And will individuals who are 
not legally present in the country be 
released in western Oklahoma? 
This is the same question that has 
been asked by mayors and leaders in 
Arizona, who have a facility like this 
in Arizona, where processing was done 
there and then they were released from 
there. And mayors and individuals 
there have asked the question: Why are 
individuals who are not legally present 
in the country being brought from the 
border to my town, and then released 
in my town? 
It is not unfair for me to be able to 
ask that as well. I have already had 
that conversation with the Secretary 
of DHS. I do not have an answer. 
So, yes, I object because we need to 
get some straightforward answers to 
some very straightforward, very fair 
questions.

INVESTING IN A NEW VISION FOR 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
AND 
SUR-
FACE 
TRANSPORTATION 
IN 
AMERICA ACT—Continued 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to discuss the mammoth $1.2 trillion 
infrastructure bill before the Senate. 
On Sunday night, we finally got to 
see the 2,700-page infrastructure bill 
that we will be voting on sometime to-
morrow or Saturday. And what we saw 
is that Democrats want to give billions 
of dollars to unelected bureaucrats in 
the Biden administration to spend how-
ever they please. 
This bill spends $21.5 billion to create 
a new office at the Department of En-
ergy called the Office of Clean Energy 
Demonstrations, 
which 
would 
give 
President Biden’s Secretary of Energy 
the power to use taxpayer dollars to in-
vest in whatever green energy initia-
tive 
she 
likes. 
Reminiscent 
of 
Solyndra, we can have the same bank-
ruptcies at taxpayer expense. 
This bill spends $24 billion in tax-
payer dollars to preserve the water in 
the San Francisco Bay, and the Long 
Island Sound would receive $106 million 
in taxpayer dollars. 
As the New York Times reported, 
‘‘Climate resiliency programs would re-
ceive their largest burst of government 
spending ever’’ from this bill. 
And the Wall Street Journal rightly 
called it ‘‘a major down payment on 
President Biden’s Green New Deal.’’ 
That is exactly what this bill is. 
Furthermore, this bill institutes a 
new tax on 42 chemicals that will raise 
prices for everyday consumers. Texans 
will bear the brunt of these high prices 
because 40 percent of the manufac-
turing plants that this new tax will hit 
are in Texas alone. 
But this tax will also hurt Louisiana 
and Michigan and Pennsylvania and 
Ohio and other manufacturing States. 
Indeed, this provision will also likely 
make many of the raw materials used 
in infrastructure projects more expen-
sive. 
I filed an amendment that would 
strike this harmful provision. Not only 
will manufacturing plants in Texas be 
hurt by this new tax, but for some of 
these plants, the new taxes will exceed 
profit margins, leading to plant clos-
ings and more and more manufacturing 
moving to China. 
In effect, the loss of these plants 
would result in lower tax revenue to 
the Federal Government, not more. Im-
ports would rise, U.S. exports would 
fall, and production in the United 
States would fall as well. 
Ironically, this infrastructure bill 
also tries to grow more critical min-
erals manufacturing and personal pro-
tective equipment, or PPE, manufac-
turing in America. But it places a 
brandnew tax on both of these things. 
PPE is made with many of the 42 
chemicals this infrastructure bill now 
wants to tax, and four of these chemi-
cals are on the Biden administration’s 
own critical minerals list. 
The old saying was: If it moves, tax 
it, and if it stops moving, subsidize it. 
Well, this bill taxes the things that we 
are trying to get moving in the first 
place. 
This bill is also a liberal spending 
wish list. The fact of the matter is, this 
bill spends too much money, and it is 
not paid for. We are told that this bill 
would, in part, be paid for with $205 bil-
lion in repurposed COVID relief funds. 
But when the bill text was released, 
magically, those funds weren’t there. It 
became apparent, instead, that only 
about $50 billion in COVID funds was 
being used to help pay for this bill. 
Some have claimed that the bill is 
paid for, but, by any measure, the pay- 
fors are quite simply gimmicks. This is 
a bait-and-switch, and the bill is not 
paid for like we were promised. 
At a time when we spent trillions of 
dollars already to combat a deadly pan-
demic, at a time when we are seeing 
rising inflation across the country, we 
can’t responsibly be spending yet an-
other trillion dollars. This bill is part 
of a much broader problem we are hav-
ing with reckless Federal spending. 
Furthermore, suppose this so-called 
bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure 
bill were being offered in exchange for 
the Democrats’ massive $3.5 trillion 
reckless tax-and-spend bill. In that 
case, I could understand the logic of 
doing the smaller bill instead of the 
massive bill. But it is not being offered 
in exchange. 
The Democrats have made it clear 
that they are going to pass this infra-
structure bill, take every penny of the 
spending, and then turn around and try 
to ram through their massive $3.5 tril-
lion tax-and-spend bill right on top of 
this, which means we are looking at 
about $5 trillion of spending in just 
those two bills. 
That means trillions of dollars in 
new taxes. If you pay taxes, they are 
going up. It means corporate taxes are 
going up; it means individual taxes are 
going up; it means small business taxes 
are going up; it means capital gains 
taxes are going up; it means the death 
tax is going up—all while our debt is 
going through the roof and inflation is 
rising across the country. 
Republicans shouldn’t play a part in 
this. We should instead say enough is 
enough. 
Look, the American people want 
good roads and good bridges. I want 
good roads and good bridges. But what 
this bill does is reminds me of the old 
swindler who says over and over again: 
I am going to sell you a bridge; I am 
going to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge— 
because the proponents of this bill are 
selling the same bridge over and over 
and over again. They go on TV, and 
they say: Bridges are popular. Roads 
are popular. You want roads and 
bridges; therefore, we have to do this. 
So let’s see what the actual spending 
looks like to understand the shell game 
that is being played. 
This bill has about $100 billion for 
roads and bridges. Do you know what? 
If the Democrats want to pass just 
that—$100 
billion 
for 
roads 
and 
bridges—I bet you could we get 90 Sen-
ators to agree with that. We could be 
done and go home this evening. 
And let me remind my fellow Sen-
ators: $100 billion is a lot of money. We 
aren’t talking about $5 at a soda ma-
chine in the hall. We aren’t talking 
about $100. We are talking about $100 
billion, which, in history, is massive 
spending. But compare that to the $1.2 
trillion in this bill. It is not Monopoly 
money. It is not make-believe money. 
It is taxpayer dollars, and it is money 
we are borrowing from China and debt 
that we are putting on our kids and 
grandkids. 
The roads and bridges part of this 
bill, in the context of the larger spend-
ing free-for-all in Washington, is about 
one-eighty-sixth the explosive spending 
going on. Let’s compare that to the 
overall spending going on in this bill 
and the total spending, so that it is not 
in a silo or a vacuum; it is all together. 
The $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill 
today is roughly 12 times the new 
spending on roads and bridges. So they 
are selling the roads and bridges, but 
the bill is 12 times bigger. But that 
ain’t it. A few months ago, the Demo-
crats rammed through a massive, so- 
called COVID relief bill. Only 9 percent 
of the bill actually went to healthcare 
spending for COVID. 
That was $1.9 trillion. So that was 
roughly 19 times larger than what is 
being spent on roads and bridges. Mind 
you, we keep being told: Roads and 
bridges are good. 
That bill was 19 times that. 
And then the massive $3.5 trillion 
tax-and-spend bill that is coming right 
after this that the Democrats intend to 
ram through—that is 35 times the 
spending on roads and bridges. And 
when you add up the spending from De-
cember 2020 to now, with the Biden 
budget request, with the Democrats’ 
tax-and-spend reconciliation proposal,

August 5, 2021 
with this infrastructure bill, with the 
so-called COVID relief bill, and with 
the emergency spending in December, 
you hit a whopping $9.5 trillion. That is 
86 times the newest spending on roads 
and bridges. 
You know, that is hard to wrap your 
mind around. These numbers all seem 
abstract—millions, billions, trillions. 
It is hard to know what you are talking 
about. So let’s see if we can make it a 
little more real. 
To understand the comparative size, 
let’s take a look at the average Amer-
ican home, right here. The average 
American home is about 20 feet tall. 
Compare that to a giant sequoia tree, 
which is about 240 feet tall, 10 times as 
much. That is a lot. 
But compare that to Big Ben, 380 feet 
tall. Compare that to Trump Tower in 
New York City at 700 feet tall. Com-
pare that to One Shell Plaza, where I 
used to work, in Houston, TX. Or com-
pare that to the Sears Tower, now 
called the Willis Tower. I don’t know 
why. I like Sears. Compare that to the 
Sears Tower at 1,400 feet tall. 
The Sears Tower is 70 times as tall as 
the 
average 
American 
house. 
The 
Democrats’ reckless spending is more 
than 70 times what is being spent on 
roads and bridges. 
So when you see politicians going on 
TV saying: Isn’t it going to be great to 
have a new freeway? Isn’t it going to be 
great to repair a bridge?—yes, we 
should do that—they are selling this. 
That is what they are selling—this 
tiny, little bit. But understand that 
what they are ramming through is this. 
They are ramming through trillions of 
dollars. 
To give you a sense of what $9.5 tril-
lion means, if the Democrats get their 
way, Congress will be spending $28,563 
for every single American. So I ask you 
at home: Have you got 28 grand sitting 
around? The Democrats think you do, 
and they want to spend it. 
I have said more than once: Dear 
God, please let nobody tell the Demo-
crats what comes after a trillion. 
These numbers are real. To put that 
in perspective, indexed for inflation, 
the U.S. Government spent $4.1 trillion 
to win World War II—$4.1 trillion to 
win World War II—the greatest genera-
tion, scaling the cliffs of Normandy, 
beating the Nazis. The Democrats, in 7 
months, are spending more than double 
what we spent to win World War II. 
This is reckless, and it is unprece-
dented. As Admiral Ackbar said in Star 
Wars, ‘‘It’s a trap.’’ This is a trap. This 
is a trap. 
Now, listen, for Democrats, it is what 
they campaign on. If you are a Demo-
crat, you want to raise taxes and raise 
spending. You want more debt from 
China. That is what Democrats do. But 
for Republicans—come on, guys—we 
are like Charlie Brown, with CHUCK 
SCHUMER being Lucy and the football. 
And you have Republicans happily run-
ning going: Oh, he is going to keep the 
football; he is going to keep the foot-
ball. 
And, every time, Lucy pulls the foot-
ball back, and we go up in the air and 
land on our rear. It would be nice for 
Republicans not to fall for it again. 
The Senate minority leader is fond of 
saying there is no learning in the sec-
ond kick from a mule. Well, there are 
a whole lot of Republicans that seem 
eager to get kicked a second time from 
a mule. The spending that we are look-
ing at—I want to repeat again—is more 
than double what the United States 
spent to win World War II, in 7 months. 
If you care about your kids, if you 
care about your grandkids, that is irre-
sponsible. And let me tell you some-
thing it is causing. It is causing infla-
tion across this country. You know, 
families at home—in Texas, in Vir-
ginia, across the country—families go 
to the grocery store, and they buy food 
for that week. They buy milk. They 
buy cereal. They buy fruit. They are 
noticing the cost of groceries going up 
and up and up. You get to the cash reg-
ister, and, gosh, that costs a lot more 
than it cost a month ago, and it costs 
a lot more than it cost 3 months ago, 
and it costs a lot more than it cost a 
year ago. 
Then when you go out and fill up 
your car with gas, you notice the cost 
has gone way, way up. And then maybe 
you go with your daughter to Home 
Depot to buy some lumber. And you 
look at the prices of the lumber, and 
you think: Is this a typo? How did 
these prices go so high? 
And then maybe you go to buy a new 
house, and you see the prices of a new 
house—the average new house—going 
up $20,000 to $30,000. 
In the last decade or so, we have been 
living in a little bit of a holiday from 
history. Inflation has not been a major 
factor for many people. Particularly 
many young people don’t know what 
inflation is. Mr. President, you and I 
are both old enough to remember the 
1970s. We remember the Jimmy Carter 
Presidency. We remember double-digit 
inflation. We remember 20 percent 
home-mortgage rates. 
Inflation is a cruel tax. It is a tax on 
the middle class. It is a tax on working 
men and women. It is a tax on anyone 
with a fixed income. And it is a tax, in 
particular, on seniors. Millions of sen-
iors across this country, on Social Se-
curity, struggling to make ends meet, 
their income isn’t going up. But thanks 
to the Democrats’ reckless spending 
and endless printing of money, their 
expenses are going up each and every 
month. 
This is wrong. This is harmful. The 
inflation bomb we are facing is hurting 
Americans. 
In a perfect world, I would ask my 
Democratic colleagues to reconsider. 
How about we spend just what we spent 
on World War II, not twice as much. In 
a perfect world, that might seem like a 
reasonable proposition. Actually, in a 
perfect world, anyone would say you 
are out of your mind to spend what you 
spent on World War II. 
But I am not naive enough to think 
that Democrats are suddenly going to 
see the light. I hope, though, at least 
some Republicans will. If you vote for 
this monstrosity, it will open the door 
to trillions more. That is harmful for 
our country. 
And if you are being told it is all 
about roads and bridges, just remember 
the one little house we saw. Roads and 
bridges are one-eighty-sixth of the 
total spending that is being rammed 
through. These trillions are 86 times 
more. We can’t afford it. It is irrespon-
sible, and I urge every Senator to say: 
Enough is enough. Stop the madness. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would 
ask unanimous consent to speak as if 
in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD TRUMKA 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this 
afternoon, almost the evening now, to 
reflect on the sad news that we re-
ceived today that Rich Trumka, the 
president of the AFL–CIO, passed away 
today. 
I wanted to try to provide some per-
spective, at least from my vantage 
point as a Pennsylvanian, because he 
was a son of Pennsylvania, born in 
Southwestern Pennsylvania, in Greene 
County. 
Greene County, for those who don’t 
know where it is, is in the furthest 
southwestern corner of our State, the 
corner where Pennsylvania, Ohio, and 
West Virginia meet. 
Rich Trumka was a man who fought 
his whole life in the cause of justice, 
fighting on behalf of working men and 
women. Before he became president of 
the AFL–CIO, obviously a national po-
sition, he also, as a very young man— 
I think he might have been 32 at the 
time—served as the president of the 
United Mine Workers of America, that 
union. And that was during a very dif-
ficult time for coal miners and their 
families. 
And then, in that position and in so 
many others, he fought for workers ev-
erywhere, literally the world over—not 
just here in America but workers in 
South Africa and other parts of the 
world. 
So to sum up what he meant to this 
country is difficult, but I think it can 
be said of Rich Trumka that he spent 
every day of his adult life advancing 
the cause of justice: the cause of jus-
tice for workers; the cause of economic 
justice, social justice, and racial jus-
tice. He dedicated his life in service to 
American workers and their families. 
I wanted to reflect a little bit about 
two parts of his life: first of all, his 
roots and then, secondly, his work and 
his contributions. 
I mentioned that Rich was a native 
of Greene County, PA—Southwestern 
Pennsylvania—a coal county. He was 
not just a miner himself as a young 
man, before and actually overlapping, 
really, getting a degree at Penn State 
and then eventually getting a law de-
gree at Villanova University, but he

August 5, 2021 
worked in the coal mines himself. He 
was a third-generation miner. Both his 
father and grandfather and uncles— 
just like any coal-mining community, 
virtually everyone was working in the 
mines. 
The town that he was born in and 
raised 
in 
goes 
by 
the 
name 
of 
Nemacolin, PA, in Greene County, 
right on the Greene County-Fayette 
County border. And it was that kind of 
community, a coal-mining community, 
as was most of Greene County in those 
days. 
I think of this community from the 
perspective of my own ancestors’ back-
ground. I come from the other end of 
the State, all the way up in the north-
eastern part of the State—Scranton, 
Lackawanna 
County, 
Northeastern 
Pennsylvania, also a coal community. 
Lackawanna County, Luzerne County, 
Carbon County, Susquehanna County, 
Northumberland County—I may have 
left one out, but they were the main 
counties that were producing anthra-
cite coal, hard coal. Where Rich and his 
family were living was so-called bitu-
minous coal—soft coal, as they used to 
call it. 
In 1894, the great novelist Stephen 
Crane, who is famous for, among other 
novels, ‘‘The Red Badge of Courage’’— 
Stephen Crane visited a coal mine near 
my hometown of Scranton, and he was, 
at the time, a very young man. I think 
he passed away before the age of 30. So 
he was in his twenties when he wrote a 
long essay about visiting this coal 
mine, a beautiful description but a 
haunting description of what a coal 
mine was like in 1894. 
Now, when Rich Trumka went into 
the mines in the late sixties, of course, 
there were great advancements to pro-
tect workers, new technology, other 
protections that his ancestors and 
mine would not have benefited from. 
But you are still going underground. 
You are still going every day into that 
darkness, into that place of so many 
risks, what Stephen Crane called a 
place 
of 
‘‘inscrutable 
darkness, 
a 
soundless place of tangible loneliness.’’ 
That is how he described his first im-
pression of a coal mine, when Crane 
was just in his twenties. Later, he de-
scribed all the ways you could die in 
that coal mine, what he called the 100 
perils of dying in a coal mine. Of 
course, this is in the context of the 
1890s, but he said: 
There is an insidious, silent enemy in the 
gas. If the huge fanwheel on the top of the 
earth should stop for a brief period, there is 
certain death. If a man escapes the gas, the 
floods, the ‘‘squeezes’’ of falling rock, the 
cars shooting through little tunnels, the pre-
carious elevators, the hundred perils, there 
usually comes to him an attack of ‘‘miner’s 
asthma’’ that slowly racks and shakes him 
into the grave. 
He 
was 
talking 
about 
pneumo-
coniosis, what they used to call miner’s 
asthma in the old, old days. 
Rich Trumka understood that. His 
own family members had died from 
that same cause of death. It wasn’t 
some theory or some passage he read in 
a history book or even a passage that 
he might have read from Stephen 
Crane. He lived it. His father and his 
grandfather and his extended family 
and his community lived it. 
And that awareness, that under-
standing of danger in the workplace, 
that understanding of suffering that 
workers still face today—in a different 
context but certainly faced in a coal 
mine all those years ago—is part of 
who he was. And to understand Rich 
Trumka 
and 
his 
contributions 
to 
American working men and women, 
you have to understand where he came 
from, those roots. 
So I am thinking about that today 
because of the connection to my own 
region of Pennsylvania; really, the con-
nection to my own family. I am far re-
moved from it. We had, I guess, four 
generations before me working the coal 
mines, but it kind of stopped when my 
grandfather worked there as a child 
and then was able to escape the mines. 
These were people who not only un-
derstood labor and suffering and con-
tribution to their community, these 
are people who kept their promises. 
That is why we fought so hard just a 
couple of years ago—the Presiding Offi-
cer was one of the people waging this 
battle—to get healthcare benefits for 
retired miners. They waited year after 
year after year, when we finally had a 
breakthrough. And one of the argu-
ments we were making is, these miners 
had kept their promise. They were told 
by their country, by their govern-
ment—the Federal Government—that 
those benefits would be there for them. 
And the Federal Government was not, 
at that time, keeping its promise. 
You had miners who had kept their 
promise to their country—sometimes 
serving in combat and World War II or 
the Korean war or Vietnam and Iraq 
and 
Afghanistan—but 
also 
keeping 
their promise to their employer to 
work every day in the most dangerous 
job in the world, and, of course, they 
kept their promise to their family. 
So Rich Trumka knew what it meant 
to make a commitment and to keep 
your promise, to never break faith with 
those to whom you had made the prom-
ise. And that is why workers all over 
the country trusted him. They knew 
that he came from them, that he un-
derstood their struggles, and that he 
kept his promises. So to understand 
the life of Rich Trumka and what he 
meant to this country, what he meant 
to workers, you have to understand his 
roots in the coal mines. 
How about his work? Well, it was a 
lifetime of fighting battles tooth and 
nail for workers, first for coal miners 
and then for workers across the board, 
represented by the AFL–CIO. 
And there is no way, if I had a half an 
hour or several hours—there is no way 
I could encapsulate his work leading 
the AFL–CIO. So I won’t try to do that. 
But suffice it to say, if there was a bat-
tle on healthcare or pensions or the 
minimum wage or the right to organize 
and bargain collectively, Rich Trumka 
was at the center of it, often the leader 
of all those battles, and it is note-
worthy—and this, of course, applies to 
Rich Trumka but also any labor orga-
nization or any labor leader—often 
fighting battles for the rest of us, bat-
tles that they had already won. Rich 
Trumka was trying to preserve the pro-
tections of the Affordable Care Act, 
and yet as the leader of the AFL–CIO, 
unions have already bargained and ne-
gotiated for healthcare benefits. But he 
knew that other people who were not 
members of a union needed that protec-
tion, needed the protection and the se-
curity that a family would need that 
the Affordable Care Act would provide. 
The minimum wage, another exam-
ple. Unions had already bargained for 
their wage—in almost every instance, 
higher than minimum wage. But there 
they were, and there he was, Rich 
Trumka, on the street, marching and 
battling for an increase in the min-
imum wage, even though his entire 
membership already had a higher wage, 
always helping those who didn’t have 
power. 
It is difficult on a day like today to 
be comprehensive in a recitation of all 
that 
Rich 
Trumka 
contributed 
to 
working men and women and, by exten-
sion, our country. 
But I think our best tribute is not 
what we will say in a floor speech or in 
a statement or even in a eulogy, as im-
portant as those words are, as impor-
tant as it is to pay tribute—maybe the 
best tribute of all that we can con-
tribute, that we can offer in memory of 
Rich Trumka, is to keep up the work, 
to pick up the banner and keep march-
ing, keep fighting. And we have one of 
those opportunities in the next few 
months in the opportunity that pre-
sents itself in the form of a piece of 
legislation 
that 
Senator 
MURRAY 
talked about from the floor today and 
she has led the fight on—the PRO Act, 
the Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act, that Rich Trumka spent his whole 
life—or, I should say, the most recent 
years of his life trying to enact into 
law. Our tribute to him should be to 
pass that piece of legislation. 
Let me conclude with condolences for 
Rich’s family, especially his wife Bar-
bara and his son and the men and 
women of the AFL–CIO who have lost a 
leader but, more importantly, have lost 
a friend, someone who would walk with 
them in every battle. May it be said of 
all of us that we will walk those same 
battle lines with him. 
With that, I will yield the floor.

Secretary 
or 
the

It is my understanding that an agree-

group 
that 
no 
rate 
regulation 
of 
broadband services would be authorized 
or permitted by NTIA or the Assistant 
Secretary who leads the NTIA, as part 
of the State broadband grants program. 
Is it the Senator’s understanding

Mr. WICKER. I thank the Senator.

AMENDMENT NO. 2498 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I want 
to say a few words about the Wyden- 
Lummis-Toomey amendment that is 
ready before the Senate to vote on to-
night. 
America is, at its core, a country of 
innovators. It is written into our DNA. 
It is why we were the first country to 
develop a computer, land on the Moon, 
and develop the internet. 
Right now, our financial system is 
evolving before our eyes, much in the 
same way that the internet first began 
to find a foothold in the mid-1990s. Dis-
tributed ledgers, digital assets, and 
other forms of financial technology are 
in the early stages of transforming the 
way we share and store value. 
These technologies have the poten-
tial, if implemented properly, to create 
a vast, new economic opportunity, re-
duce systemic risk in our economy, and 
provide for faster payments and create 
a more inclusive financial system. 
These are principles that all Americans 
can agree on. 
America has a heritage of being the 
global leader in financial services, and 
this has created enormous wealth and 
opportunity in this Nation. But we 
must be careful not to rest on our lau-
rels. America’s leadership in the global 
economy is a privilege, not a right, and 
one we must earn through innovation 
and hard work. 
Europe, China, Singapore, and other 
nations have a head start on the 
United States in implementing finan-
cial technology and integrating it into 
their economies. We have a window to 
catch up because the U.S. dollar is still 
the world’s reserve currency and be-
cause our central role in payments and 
the capital markets put us there. But 
let’s not make a mistake here; we still 
have a lot of catching up to do. 
The digital asset reporting provisions 
in the infrastructure bill is one of the 
first times the Senate has been re-
quired to grapple with the opportuni-
ties and risks of digital assets. 
I thank Senator PORTMAN for bring-
ing attention to this very important 
issue: the issue of ensuring tax compli-
ance in the digital asset markets. Ev-
eryone should be paying the taxes they 
owe under the law, and I support the 
spirit of this provision. 
I 
also 
want 
to 
thank 
Senator 
PORTMAN for his willingness to work 
with me over the last week to make 
changes to the language currently in 
the bill. It has come a long way. But 
even with these changes, it isn’t quite 
ready to become law. 
The Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amend-
ment is very simple. It clarifies in law 
what most of us already believe, that 
validators of distributed ledger data 
like miners and stakers, hardware wal-
let providers, and software developers 
should be required to report trans-
actional data to the Internal Revenue 
Service. This is common sense. 
The 
most 
important 
thing 
this 
amendment does is say in plain English 
what the law means. This is so impor-
tant to startups, small business own-
ers, and ordinary Americans who want 
to take a risk on their ideas. In many 
cases, these Americans can’t hire a 
fancy lawyer to tell them what a com-
plicated law means. 
The amendment makes clear that 
Congress is about to have a really im-
portant debate on the legal status of 
digital assets as securities or commod-
ities and the appropriate regulatory 
framework in which to house digital 
assets. 
We 
must 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
validators of distributed ledger assets— 
like miners and stakers, hardware wal-
let providers, and software developers— 
are not in a position to report trans-
action data to the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
Mr. President, this amendment is the 
first step in a long journey towards 
America renewing its commitment to 
innovation and retaining its role as the 
leader in the global economy. This is 
why Chairman WYDEN, Ranking Mem-
ber TOOMEY, and I brought this amend-
ment forward. It is because we care 
deeply about the future of American 
innovation, 
and 
we 
want 
to 
see 
thoughtful debate and good public pol-
icy around these issues. 
I am very thankful to Chairman 
WYDEN, Ranking Member TOOMEY, Sen-
ator SINEMA, Senator PORTMAN, and 
others for allowing us to have this de-
bate today. It will be the first of many 
in the coming years. 
I urge my colleagues to thoughtfully 
consider Senate amendment No. 2498 
and to support it when it comes up for 
a vote. 
I yield the floor.

underlying bill for a Saturday vote. If 
we come to an agreement yet tonight, 
which is our preference, we will have 
additional votes on amendments. I be-
lieve we are very close to an agreement 
and see no reason why we can’t com-
plete this important bipartisan bill. I 
urge both sides to continue working 
diligently to make it happen.

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
we have worked long, hard, and col-
laboratively to finish this important 
bipartisan bill. 
The Senate has considered 22 amend-
ments during this process, and we have 
been willing to consider many more. In 
fact, we have been trying to vote on 
amendments all day but have encoun-
tered numerous objections from the 
other side. 
However, we very much want to fin-
ish this important bill, so we will re-
convene Saturday at noon to vote on 
cloture, and then we will follow the 
regular order to finish the bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of the majority leader’s com-
ments, and I want to commend my col-
leagues for the work we have done to-
gether in a bipartisan fashion over the 
last 4 days, considering and clearing 22 
amendments as a body together in the 
Senate. 
And while we were unable to agree on 
additional amendments today, I do also 
look forward to us reconvening to-
gether on Saturday and proceeding 
under regular order to finish what will 
be a historic piece of legislation both 
in its bipartisan nature and in the im-
pact it will have on our country. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER.

that the Senate vote on the nomina-
tions en bloc without intervening ac-
tion or debate; that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table, with no intervening ac-
tion or debate; that any statements re-
lated to the nominations be printed in

MORNING BUSINESS 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is 
alarming to know that voter suppres-
sion, which we have worked for decades 
to overcome, is not a ghost from our 
past. Suppression efforts are resur-
facing—and surging—in State legisla-
tures across the country. Voter roll 
purging, out-of-the-way polling sta-
tions, and needless barriers to access-
ing the ballot box are underway and 
under consideration in jurisdictions 
across the country. It cannot stand. 
Under the guise of election integrity, 
even in the wake of the most secure 
election in our Nation’s history, pro-
ponents of these suppressive move-
ments make no effort to hide their tar-
gets: African Americans, Latino Amer-
icans, college students, low-income 
voters, the list goes on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5924 
August 5, 2021 
Those who do not feel compelled to 
push against these voter suppression 
need a lesson in history. Thankfully, a 
July 27 column in the Washington Post 
by Norman Lear offers just that in-
sight. Penned on the occasion of his 
99th birthday, this decorated American 
war hero, one of our Nation’s Greatest 
Generation, recalls the pain and be-
trayal felt by African-American war 
heroes 
who 
fought 
for 
democracy 
abroad, only to be excluded from it at 
home. He reminds us that it took dec-
ades of relentless activism to give mil-
lions of minority American voters and 
others a real voice by finally giving 
them a vote. 
And most importantly, he urges all 
Americans to fight now to protect the 
right to vote, the very right that gives 
democracy its name. This is a call to 
action. 
Voting 
suppression 
cannot 
stand. From the For the People Act to 
my own bipartisan John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, named for 
another icon of the voting movement, 
this Senate has a real opportunity to 
stand for democracy. I will work in 
good faith with any member of the 
Senate, regardless of party, to find a 
path to passing and enacting that im-
portant 
bill 
bearing 
John 
Lewis’s 
name. Efforts to restore the Voting 
Rights Act have always been bipar-
tisan. There is no reason it shouldn’t 
be bipartisan again now. 
To echo Norman’s words, the right to 
vote isn’t about party or even politics. 
It is about our system of self-govern-
ment and the notion that a govern-
ment of, by, and for the people is worth 
protecting 
in 
a 
world 
where 
authoritarianism and tyranny are still 
forces we are reckoning with. I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Norman 
Lear’s opinion piece, titled ‘‘Norman 
Lear: As I begin my 100th year, I’m baf-
fled that voting rights are still under 
attack,’’ be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, July 27, 2021] 
AS I BEGIN MY 100TH YEAR, I’M BAFFLED 
THAT VOTING RIGHTS ARE STILL UNDER AT-
TACK 
(By Norman Lear) 
I woke up today at the start of my 100th 
year as a citizen of this beautiful, bewil-
dering country. I am proud of the progress 
we’ve made in my first 99 years, and it 
breaks my heart to see it undermined by 
politicians more committed to their own 
power than the principles that should bind 
us together. Frankly, I am baffled and dis-
turbed that 21st-century Americans must 
still struggle to protect their right to vote. 
I am a patriot, and I will not surrender 
that word to those who play to our worst im-
pulses rather than our highest ideals. When 
the United States entered World War II, I 
dropped out of college to fight fascism. I flew 
52 missions with a crew in a B–17, dropping 
bombs 35 times. Unlike so many others, I re-
turned from that war safely, to another 70- 
plus years of life, love, family, failure and 
triumph. 
It’s very likely that I owe my ass and all 
those decades of human experience to that 
Black and Brown squadron of Red Tail P–51 
fighter pilots known as the Tuskegee air-
men. When we saw their red tails coming to 
escort us, we all felt a bit safer. 
Yet when these courageous men returned 
to the United States, they returned to rac-
ism, segregation and discrimination. Their 
heroism did not shield them from the indig-
nities and violence of Jim Crow. I can only 
imagine the depth of the betrayal the airmen 
must have felt, but it did not prevent many 
of them from accomplishing great things. 
I think often of the congresswoman Bar-
bara Jordan. She will always be remembered 
for declaring during President Richard M. 
Nixon’s impeachment hearings, ‘‘My faith in 
the Constitution is whole; it is complete; it 
is total.’’ Even now, it gives me chills to 
think of her saying that, as a Black woman, 
in the face of her own experiences of preju-
dice and her full knowledge of our history. 
I believe Jordan’s faith in the Constitu-
tion, like my continued faith in our country, 
was grounded in the faith, love and hope of 
all the people who have struggled for the 
past 230 years—including millions who ral-
lied for racial justice this past year—to 
make the Constitution’s promises real for all 
of us. 
After we defeated fascism overseas, it took 
20 more years to pass the Voting Rights Act 
and Civil Rights Act at home. Now, head-
lines seem drawn from the past: States tar-
get Black voters with voter-suppression 
bills. Federal voting-rights laws blocked in 
the Senate by a filibuster. Racial and reli-
gious 
nationalism, 
nativism 
and 
authoritarianism are seemingly on the rise 
everywhere. It is deeply discouraging to this 
member of what has been called ‘‘the Great-
est Generation.’’ 
But do you know who else was part of the 
Greatest Generation? Rosa Parks, Fannie 
Lou Hamer and Thurgood Marshall. And 
think of the greatness demonstrated by gen-
erations that followed us: Jordan, the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis, and 
millions of not-famous people who risked ev-
erything to claim the right to vote. 
To legislators getting between people and 
the ballot box, and to senators who are 
standing in the dishonorable tradition of 
those who filibustered civil rights legisla-
tion, I say this: You may pass some unjust 
laws. You may win elections by preventing 
or discouraging people from voting. 
But you will not in the end defeat the 
democratic spirit, the spirit that animated 
the Tuskegee airmen to whom I owe my life, 
the spirit that powers millions of Americans 
who give of themselves to defend voting 
rights, protect our environment, preserve 
peaceful pluralism, defeat discrimination, 
and expand educational and economic oppor-
tunity. 
The right to vote is foundational to ad-
dressing all these issues. It is at the heart of 
everything I have fought for in war and in 
peacetime. 
To senators who are willing to sacrifice the 
right to vote to some outdated notion of bi-
partisanship and Senate tradition, I almost 
do not know what to say. On the scale of jus-
tice, this is not even a close call. Do what’s 
right. 
Protecting voting rights should not be to-
day’s struggle. But it is. And that means it 
is our struggle, yours and mine, for as long 
as we have breath and strength.

SOUTH SUDAN 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after dec-
ades of civil war, famine, and political 
instability, after millions were killed 
and millions more became refugees, 
many hoped that independence and a 
peace agreement in South Sudan would 
usher in a period of stability and 
progress. 
Some South Sudanese refugees who 
had resettled in the United States re-
turned to South Sudan to aid in re-
building. 
Unfortunately, 
peace 
was 
fleeting and the past decade of inde-
pendence has been marred by continued 
violent 
ethnic 
conflict, 
widespread 
hunger, and ongoing disputes between 
rival politicians that have cared more 
about their own ambitions than the 
South Sudanese people. Despite several 
power sharing agreements, promises of 
unity and reconciliation, and a goal to 
seat a full Parliament in 2020, the ri-
valry between President Salva Kiir and 
Vice President Riek Machar has stoked 
tensions between the Dinka and Nuer 
ethnic groups and neglected public in-
frastructure and basic services. On Au-
gust 2, almost a year past the promised 
deadline, an incomplete Parliament 
was sworn into office, with 62 members 
absent due to disagreements over the 
power-sharing arrangement. 
The people of South Sudan cannot 
wait another decade for progress. They 
cannot wait for politicians to argue 
over control while their children go 
hungry, while they sink deeper into 
poverty, while they worry that the 
next outbreak of violent conflict might 
send them fleeing for their lives. Re-
cently, the People’s Coalition for Civil 
Action launched an effort to mobilize 
all South Sudanese people, whether liv-
ing within the country or abroad, and 
demand political change. In a declara-
tion, they said they ‘‘have had enough 
of war, enough of corruption, enough of 
insecurity, enough of economic hard-
ships, enough of public neglect and 
leadership failure.’’ They admonished 
the administration of President Salva 
Kiir, which has completely failed to 
fulfill its most basic responsibilities to 
provide security and stability for its 
citizens. 
Just days later, the South Sudanese 
National Security Service—NSS—ar-
rested two of the leaders of the move-
ment, Augustino Ting Mayai and a 
former State Governor, Kuel Aguer 
Kuel, for signing the declaration. The 
NSS shut down the Sudd Institute, a 
think tank involved in the creation of 
the People’s Coalition for Civil Action, 
and issued arrest warrants for Rajab 
Mohandis and Abraham Awolich, two 
other signatories of the declaration, 
who have gone into hiding. This sup-
pression of dissent is not new in South 
Sudan. Weak and paranoid new leaders 
often resort to projecting strength by 
arresting civil society leaders, journal-
ists, and political rivals, and over the 
years, this has become President Kiir’s 
trademark. This most recent trans-
parent attempt to silence his own citi-
zens for nothing more than demanding 
that he keep his promises and do his 
duty has not gone unnoticed by the 
rest of the world. 
President Kiir may not know that 
Abraham Awolich was one of the now- 
famous Lost Boys, who as a child sur-
vived the civil war that killed most of

his family, endured malnutrition, and 
escaped attacks by rebel groups seek-
ing child soldiers, only to find himself 
alone in a refugee camp. He eventually 
was resettled in the United States, ar-
riving in Vermont in 2001, graduating 
from the University of Vermont, be-
coming an American citizen, and going 
on to get his master’s degree. He was 
my constituent for many years, and I 
am very proud of the work he did as a 
member 
of 
the 
South 
Sudanese 
diasporic community who returned to 
his native country to help rebuild. 
President Kiir may not have known 
that Abraham was my constituent or 
that I will always consider him my 
constituent. So I call upon him now to 
immediately release Kuel Aguer Kuel 
and Augustino Ting Mayai, to cancel 
the arrest warrants for Rajab Mohandis 
and Abraham Awolich, and end the re-
pression of civil society leaders, jour-
nalists, and dissidents. 
I want to read into the RECORD a 
quote from Abraham Awolich’s state-
ment at the launch of their movement. 
What he said is instructive to every 
citizen of every democracy around the 
world. He said, ‘‘In the last 10 years the 
people of South Sudan have been dor-
mant, they have not been challenging 
the status quo in the Republic of South 
Sudan and we cannot expect to have a 
democratic 
country 
without 
active 
citizenship.’’ 
President Kiir has an opportunity 
now, with a new Parliament seated and 
the seeds for an active and engaged 
citizenry sown, to show true leader-
ship. He has no time to waste, or he 
will risk wasting his country’s future 
and losing the support of the United 
States. 
f 
BELARUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in early 
2011, I had one of the more unusual ex-
periences of my Senate career. I trav-
eled back in time, from a free and 
democratic Lithuania to a closed and 
totalitarian Belarus. The trip was less 
than 3 hours, but it took me back to a 
dark past. 
You see, Belarus is the last dictator-
ship in Europe. But like many dictator-
ships, it claims to be a democracy. In 
December 2010, it held what was billed 
as a Presidential election. The victor 
in that rigged contest was a heavy by 
the name of Alexander Lukashenko. 
His first act, after seizing the Presi-
dency, was to jail all of those who were 
bold enough to run against him. 
Months later, I drove from Vilnius to 
Minsk to meet with the family mem-
bers of those jailed candidates, who had 
been arrested by Belarus security serv-
ices still called the KGB. Mind you, the 
original KGB was dissolved more than 
three decades ago. That tells you all 
you need to know about how much the 
Belarusian Government has evolved 
since the fall of the Soviet Union. My 
meeting with those family members 
was sobering, and it is an encounter I 
will never forget. 
Fortunately, over time, we were able 
to see the release of all these brave 
Belarusians, but not because Alexander 
Lukashenko had a sudden change of 
heart. He is still the same authori-
tarian thug he has always been. The 
world was reminded of that a year ago, 
when another sham election was held 
in Belarus. True to form, Lukashenko 
was reelected in that rigged contest. 
And once again, he began jailing those 
who had opposed him. 
When one leading candidate, social 
media personality Sergei Tikhanovsky, 
was 
arbitrarily 
jailed, 
his 
wife 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya stepped in to 
run in his place. She likely won the en-
suing election, although we will never 
know for certain. The stolen electoral 
process that unfolded scared her into 
fleeing for safety in neighboring Lith-
uania. 
Last 
month, 
Ms. 
Tikhanovskaya 
traveled to Washington, DC, to seek 
support for the Belarussian peoples’ 
fight for freedom from tyranny. I was 
proud to meet with her, along with 
Senators SHAHEEN and SULLIVAN. And I 
was glad to see President Biden met 
with 
her 
as 
well. 
Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya is a brave patriot car-
rying the torch of democracy for all 
the people of Belarus. 
I 
thought 
of 
her, 
and 
other 
Belarussian patriots, as I watched the 
Olympics this week. In Tokyo, another 
brave 
Belarussian 
woman, 
sprinter 
Krystsina Tisimansouskaya, dared to 
publicly criticize Belarussian Olympic 
officials, a group from Lukashenko’s 
ruling 
party. 
For 
her 
audacity, 
Lukashenko ordered the 24-year-old 
sprinter to return to Belarus imme-
diately, right before she was scheduled 
to run in the women’s 200-meter race 
on Monday. 
If she had obliged, there is a very 
good chance she would be locked up in 
a Belarusian jail at this very moment, 
along with so many other political 
prisoners. 
But 
Krystsina 
Tisimansouskaya 
said 
no. 
At 
the 
Tokyo airport, before she could be 
forced onto a plane home, she sought 
protection from Japanese police. She 
also appealed to the International 
Olympic Committee for help. Her ap-
peals worked. The Polish Government 
granted her a humanitarian visa. And 
Slovenia and the Czech Republic said 
she was welcome in their countries, 
too. 
Ten years since my trip to Belarus, I 
am still moved by the courage of so 
many 
Belarusians 
like 
Ms. 
Tisimansouskaya, Ms. Tikhanovskaya, 
and the thousands upon thousands who 
have peacefully protested for a better 
future. These heroic leaders are still 
trapped in a dark past thanks to the 
same ruthless dictator who continues 
to cling onto power. 
They are willing to risk so much for 
a chance at freedom. They are unafraid 
to stand up to despots and defend de-
mocracy. And they are an inspiration 
to a world that needs it. I want them to 
know we see them, and America stands 
with them in their efforts to create a 
better and truly democratic Belarus. 
f 
HUNGARY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on a re-
lated note, Alexander Lukashenko may 
be the last dictator in Europe. But 
Hungarian 
Prime 
Minister 
Victor 
Orban is working hard to become the 
next dictator in Europe. 
In his 15 years as Prime Minister, 
Orban 
has 
undermined 
Hungary’s 
democratic institutions and the civil 
society groups that support them. He 
has dusted off the autocrat’s handbook 
and used many of its familiar tricks, 
including using public funds to reward 
his cronies, spying on and jailing dis-
sidents and independent journalists, 
and turning media organizations into 
his personal mouthpieces. 
He spews ultranationalist bigotry 
dressed up as traditional values and 
rails against what he calls an immi-
grant invasion. Critics on both sides of 
the Atlantic cite him as a cautionary 
example of how democracies can die. 
Some European leaders have called for 
Hungary’s expulsion from the E.U. be-
cause of Hungary’s growing hostility to 
the bedrock values of democracy under 
Orban. 
Despite this, every night this week, 
Tucker 
Carlson 
has 
broadcast 
his 
prime-time FOX show from Budapest, 
Hungary. He is not there to interview 
the brave supporters of Hungarian de-
mocracy who are trying to save their 
country from Orban and autocracy. 
No, Tucker Carlson is in Hungary to 
praise 
Orban 
and 
hold 
up 
his 
strongman stunts as an example for 
America to follow. It is reported that 
he will also address a conference linked 
to Mr. Orban’s anti-democratic nation-
alist movement. 
Tucker Carlson has gone from spout-
ing his dangerous anti-vax quackery 
and spreading the Big Lie at home, to 
travelling abroad to fawn over an auto-
crat and herald him as a leader worth 
emulating in this country. 
Ronald Reagan would be horrified. 
We all should be.

THE 
GHOST 
ARMY 
CONGRES-
SIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to recognize the contributions of the 
Ghost Army units of World War II and 
explain why I decided to join the Ghost 
Army Congressional Gold Medal Act as 
a cosponsor. The 23rd Headquarters 
Special Troops and the 3133rd Signal 
Service Company, together known as 
the Ghost Army, used deception tactics 
to fool the German Army about the lo-
cation of American troops. These spe-
cialized units used inflatable tanks and 
sound effects to give the impression of 
a larger presence. While their role was 
theatrical, the units suffered causal-
ities and operated close to the front 
lines. For over 50 years, these units and 
the contributions of the men who com-
prised them were kept a secret. I

CONFIRMATION OF ROBERT PETER 
SILVERS 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, had 
there been a recorded vote, I would 
have voted no on the confirmation of 
Executive Calendar No. 158, Robert 
Peter Silvers, of the District of Colum-
bia, to be Under Secretary for Strat-
egy, Policy, and Plans, Department of 
Homeland Security. 
f 
THE NATIONAL DEBT 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the Senate 
is considering an infrastructure bill, 
and I am glad we are. For too long, 
Americans have been compelled to send 
their tax dollars overseas to improve 
the infrastructure of other countries. I 
have been fighting, for several years, to 
invest in infrastructure here at home, 
which is why I find it frustrating that 
the very people who celebrate this 
package today actually opposed my ef-
forts in the past. 
We have a short memory here in the 
Senate. Only 2 years ago, I offered my 
Penny Plan for Infrastructure for a 
vote. My plan would have invested 
nearly $40 billion in infrastructure over 
those 2 years. In those 2 years, nearly 
20,000 miles of roads could have been 
resurfaced. Instead, those investments 
weren’t made and 2 additional years of 
wear and tear passed by. 
The parade of Senators coming to the 
floor and expounding upon the urgency 
of this package is nothing less than 
shocking, 
particularly 
when 
those 
same Members voted against 20,000 
miles of resurfaced roads only a short 
time ago. 
The Penny Plan was not my only ef-
fort to invest in infrastructure. Six 
years ago, I worked on a bipartisan 
package that would have made $ 130 
billion available for infrastructure. 
Had my plan been enacted into law, 
Americans would now be driving on 130 
thousand miles of new roads. 
So, why for more than 5 years have 
my infrastructure proposals been sti-
fled? For only one reason: each of my 
proposals were paid for. 
And if there is only one thing Con-
gress always agrees on: never pay for 
any new spending. Ever. 
Proponents of this bill claim it is 
paid for. And by using budgetary gim-
micks, they hope they will erect 
enough smoke and mirrors to obscure 
this bill’s enormous price tag. But this 
$1.2 trillion bill is not paid for. And, 
perhaps the most alarming part of the 
cost, is the authors of this bill know it 
is not paid for. And we know that be-
cause they wrote the bill so as to ex-
empt it from rules that require the bill 
be paid for. 
You see, Congress passed a law back 
in 2010 mandating that new spending 
has to be paid for. That law is called 
statutory pay-go, or pay as you go. And 
if Congress can’t help itself and refuses 
to offset the cost of new spending, pay- 
go is enforced by an automatic cut to 
spending elsewhere. 
But Congress rarely adheres to its 
own rules. Instead, Congress waived 
pay-go more than 60 times over the 
past decade and added over $10 trillion 
to our debt. 
This time is no different. This bill, 
which its proponents say is paid for, 
also carries a provision that says pay- 
go won’t apply to it. 
The only way to ensure Congress ad-
heres to pay-go is through a point of 
order. If this bill is actually paid for, 
then you should have no trouble sup-
porting the point of order. But if you 
vote to waive the point of order, if you 
vote to exempt Congress from its own 
rule requiring that we be good stewards 
of taxpayer dollars, then stop telling 
people something you know is not true. 
The truth is, this bill is not paid for. 
And every American should ask a 
simple question: Why won’t Congress 
obey its own rules? 
This bill plus the next pork-laden bill 
will add trillions of dollars of new debt. 
We are adding debt at an unprece-
dented pace. There will be repercus-
sions. A day of reckoning awaits. 
But today there is a choice to make. 
A vote for the point of order is a vote 
not to keep adding debt. 
I urge my colleagues to vote with me 
to stop the bleeding, to stop the red 
ink that threatens our country’s fu-
ture. 
f 
OIL AND GAS LEASES 
MORATORIUM 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of North Dakota At-
torney General Wayne Stenehjem fil-
ing a lawsuit against the Biden admin-
istration’s continued cancelation of oil 
and gas leases on Federal lands and its 
impact on State and private mineral 
owners. 
In addition to being a foolish idea, I 
believe President Biden’s moratorium 
is illegal. It increases Federal and 
State budget shortfalls, hampers State 
and private mineral owners’ rights, and 
makes the United States less energy 
independent and more reliant on for-
eign producers. 
My State of North Dakota is unique-
ly harmed by this action, given what is 
commonly referred to as the split es-
tate issue. For roughly 100 years, the 
Federal Government has retained Fed-
eral mineral rights on land near where 
State and/or private entities also hold 
surface and mineral rights. About 30 
percent of the spacing units in North 
Dakota have interspersed federal min-
eral interests and therefore must go 
through the leasing process of the Bu-
reau of Land Management—BLM—re-
gardless of its size. 
Accordingly, since the moratorium, 
it is estimated our State has lost $4.77 
billion in tax revenues and $1.2 billion 
in private royalties. We are grateful 
the Louisiana Federal District Court 
Order agreed the Biden administra-
tion’s actions are illegal, but unfortu-
nately, we are being given no reason to 
think the near of this harmful policy is 
near. 
On a recent call between the leader-
ship of the BLM Montana/Dakotas of-
fice and constituents from the region, 
BLM officials stated that they are can-
celing quarterly lease sales at least 
through the end of calendar year 2021. 
Citing the administration’s plans to 
appeal the district court ruling, State 
Director John Mehloff said, ‘‘We’ll 
probably, at earliest, would be able to 
hold an oil and gas lease sale late first 
quarter of 2022.’’ 
That is disappointing, to say the 
least. Thankfully, North Dakota is 
taking action to protect our producers 
and America’s energy security. I sup-
port the State’s efforts in court and 
hope they are successful. 
f 
RECHARGE ACT 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Mr. President, 
I recently introduced the RECHARGE 
Act, S. 2241, with my friend and col-
league, Senator WHITEHOUSE, and we 
are very pleased that this bill, as 
amended, is included in the Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act as Sec-
tion 40431. 
Section 40431 amends section 111(d) of 
the Public Utility Regulatory Policies 
Act of 1978, 16 U.S.C. 2621(d) in order to 
establish a new requirement that all 
public utilities—investor-owned utili-
ties, customer-owned cooperatives, and 
public power utilities—must consider 
establishing EV-specific rates for resi-
dential customers, EV drivers, and 
commercial customers, who operate 
public and fleet EV charging stations, 
to promote greater electrification in 
the transportation sector. 
Lowering emissions in the transpor-
tation sector will hinge upon the elec-
trification of our country’s motorized 
vehicles. Large investments in electric 
vehicle, or EV, charging infrastructure 
of the type included in other sections 
of this legislation will provide a cata-
lyst for mass EV adoption. 
The successful adoption of EVs will 
depend not only upon modernizing 
America’s grid and charging infrastruc-
ture, but also upon updating our elec-
tricity sector rates, so that the infra-
structure funded by this act can oper-
ate in an economically sustainable 
manner for decades to come. The com-
mercial rates present today were not 
designed with the unique electricity 
load profile of a growing EV fleet in 
mind.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5927 
August 5, 2021 
Public EV charging stations, and par-
ticularly high-powered DC fast charg-
ing stations designed for highway cor-
ridors and for heavier-duty EVs like 
buses and trucks, face a distinct set of 
hurdles imposed by the current regu-
latory system and traditional, demand- 
based electricity rates. 
Most prominent among barriers to 
deploying commercial EV charging are 
demand charges, which are electricity 
rates set by public utilities on their 
customers, including EV charging sta-
tion owners, based on the maximum 
amount of power, kW, drawn for any 
given time interval, typically 15 min-
utes, during the billing period, multi-
plied by the relevant tariff demand 
charge. 
Demand charges are designed to cap-
ture the marginal costs imposed on the 
grid by high-capacity, high-utilization 
infrastructure such as factories. How-
ever, when traditional demand charges 
are levied upon high-capacity, low-uti-
lization infrastructure such as EV 
charging stations, they can place a dis-
proportionate cost burden on the sta-
tion owners. 
The high-powered, fast-charging sta-
tions our Nation needs to serve the EV 
driving public, public and private fleet 
vehicle operators, and the trucking in-
dustry have different load profiles than 
most commercial entities, with periods 
of dormancy punctuated by spikes in 
activity. And unlike most commercial 
operations, their demand profile is 
driven by real-time customer activity. 
So it is difficult for these stations to 
optimize their load profiles. 
The burden of demand charges varies 
by State and by region and can fail to 
accurately reflect the marginal costs 
imposed on the system by EV charging 
stations. For example, in the Colorado 
PUC Electric Vehicle Working Group 
Report published in 2019, the Colorado 
Public Utilities Commission found that 
demand charges result in the annual 
cost to operate a direct current fast 
charging, DCFC, station in one Colo-
rado utility territory being 35 times 
higher than the cost in a neighboring 
service territory. The problem will 
only worsen for the still higher-demand 
and lower-utilization application of EV 
truck charging. 
Demand charges, if not reformed, 
may also introduce new issues of in-
equity as America electrifies transpor-
tation. For example, homeowners are 
able to charge an electric vehicle on 
very 
affordable 
residential 
utility 
rates, which currently average $1.16 per 
gasoline gallon equivalent according to 
the Department of Energy. But those 
who live in multiunit housing and rent 
their abode, a population that is dis-
proportionately low-income and minor-
ity, often cannot charge an EV at 
home. They will charge their EVs at 
public charging stations, and those 
public charging stations must pay 
much higher commercial utility rates, 
including commercial demand charges, 
which make up as much as 90 percent 
of public charging station’s utility bills 
according to RMI. 
In recent years, some States and util-
ities have recognized this inequity and 
taken steps to reform their utility 
rates, to reduce and reform commercial 
demand charges and to adopt rates de-
signed for low-load or electric vehicle 
charging infrastructure. These utilities 
and regulators should be commended 
for their forward-leaning approach to a 
complicated issue. Utilities in Colorado 
have begun to do this, as have utilities 
in quite a few other States. 
Section 40431 requires only those 
States and utilities which have not al-
ready done so to take up the issue of 
how demand charge rates affect EV 
charging in order to encourage new pri-
vate-sector investment in EV charging 
stations. 
These States and utilities are al-
lowed 2 years to consider the establish-
ment of new rates that A, promote af-
fordable and equitable EV charging op-
tions; B, facilitate deployment of fast-
er charging technology that improves 
the customer experience; C, accelerate 
third-party investment in EV charging 
infrastructure; and D, appropriately re-
cover marginal costs. 
Our intention is to ensure that alter-
natives to traditional, demand-based 
electricity rates are made available to 
EV charging station owners with ap-
propriate oversight by State public 
utility commissions. To remove any 
doubt, section 40431 does not empower, 
encourage, or allow State public utility 
commissions to regulate the prices 
that third-party owned EV charging 
stations charge their customers for EV 
charging services. Those prices are set 
in a competitive marketplace that ben-
efits consumers, and this legislation 
does not affect that marketplace. 
Section 40431 should prompt forward- 
looking change at the State and utility 
level which appropriately reflects and 
accommodates the real differences in 
geographies, electricity markets, and 
business environments which exist be-
tween and within States and utility 
territories. It ensures that attention 
will be paid to this problem nation-
wide, but also that each State and util-
ity can decide how to address the prob-
lem its own way. Ultimately, it should 
lead to new rate designs that enable 
the private sector to make economi-
cally sustainable investments in the 
high-powered charging stations that 
will help drivers, fleet operators, and 
truckers go electric, while more appro-
priately reflecting the actual marginal 
costs added to the grid by EV charging 
stations.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING PATRICK J. 
SOLANO 
∑ Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the distinguished life 
and career of Patrick J. Solano, who 
passed away on January 23, 2021. I am 
proud to remember Pat, a resident of 
Pittston 
Township, 
PA, 
decorated 
World War II veteran and lifelong pub-
lic servant. Pat will be remembered at 
an annual golf tournament in Luzerne 
County on August 6. 
In 1942, Pat was drafted by the U.S. 
Army Air Corps after he graduated 
from Pittston Township High School. 
During his military career, he served 
as a flight engineer on 23 combat mis-
sions with the Eighth United States 
Air Force Heavy Bombardment Group, 
aboard the B–17 Flying Fortress. For 
his service during World War II, he was 
awarded the Group Presidential Cita-
tion, the Air Force Medal with two 
oakleaf clusters, and the Europe Com-
bat Theater Medal with two Bronze 
Stars. 
Pat’s service to our country did not 
end with World War II, as he came 
home and embarked on a lifetime of 
public service at both the local and 
State level in Pennsylvania. He was 
recognized as a trusted political ad-
viser for almost 50 years and served in 
the administrations of nine Governors 
of both political parties. His service to 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
crossed party lines, and he became 
known as a voice of reason and a uni-
fying force in Harrisburg. 
He served in the Pennsylvania De-
partment of Environmental Regula-
tion, later known as the department of 
environmental protection. Later, he 
was appointed the acting secretary for 
the department of conservation and 
natural resources when it was first cre-
ated in 1995. Pat helped to shape the fu-
ture of the department and its mission 
to conserve and sustain Pennsylvania’s 
natural resources for present and fu-
ture generations. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
Pat’s wife, Marie; his children, Mary 
Pat, Cathy, Anita, Rita, Liz, and Anne; 
his 11 grandchildren and 3 great-grand-
children; and his countless friends.∑

REMEMBERING ALLEN THOMAS 
NOBLE 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH, 
Representative MIKE SIMPSON, and Rep-
resentative RUSS
FULCHER, I honor 
Allen Thomas Noble, a stalwart of the 
city of Boise and a great Idahoan. 
Allen Noble was a visionary, who 
loved our country. He was a native Ida-
hoan, born in Idaho Falls. He grad-
uated from Kuna High School and 
started out in farming in the Happy 
Valley of Idaho. Allen married Vera 
May Shulz, of Kuna, and they had five 
children: Susan, Linda, June, David, 
and Mark. As his obituary reads, ‘‘He 
loved farm equipment and in 1958 
bought an interest in Nampa Inter-
national Harvester and moved his fam-
ily to Nampa.’’ Allen’s deep love for 
farming was evident in his agricultural 
advancements, including his develop-
ment of ‘‘high lift pumping’’ that ad-
vanced farm irrigation capabilities in 
the Dry Lake area and later near 
Glenns Ferry. In 1965, Allen married 
Billie Dee Jolley Johnson and added

four more children to the family: Linda 
Sue, Cindee Lou, Kate, and Rusty. He 
later expanded into John Deere dealer-
ships, as Campbell Tractor Co., and ex-
tended his appreciation for aviation 
into agricultural spraying and Idaho 
Helicopters, Inc.’s firefighting and air 
medical operations. His helicopter op-
erations have served as the primary 
life flight service in the Pacific North-
west, saving countless lives. This serv-
ice has been instrumental in serving 
Idaho’s backcountry and moving pa-
tients quickly from accidents to med-
ical care. 
In addition to his success and ad-
vancements in agriculture, Allen gave 
generously of his time, talents, and re-
sources to many organizations and ef-
forts in the community. He was a long-
time supporter of Boise State football, 
and he contributed for decades to the 
Boise State athletic department. This 
included backing the expansion of 
Albertsons Stadium and helping to es-
tablish the Allen Noble Hall of Fame 
Gallery, named in his honor. He served 
on the Bronco Athletic Association 
Board of Directors and earned the 
Bronze Bronco Award. He also served 
on the board of directors for the Idaho 
First National Bank. Additionally, he 
was an initial outside investor in Mi-
cron Technology and served on its 
board of directors, playing a key role 
in the start and growth of the com-
pany. 
Allen’s light shined brightly over the 
92 years we were blessed to have him as 
part of our world. He has been fittingly 
described as a great man who had an 
innovative 
mind, 
a 
passion 
for 
progress, and a pioneering spirit with 
the drive and determination to accom-
plish anything he put his mind to. He 
was also warmhearted and giving, and 
his 
encouragement 
and 
support 
touched many lives over the years. 
He is remembered as a loyal friend 
who was open and generous with his 
life. We offer our heartfelt condolences 
to his many friends and loved ones, in-
cluding his siblings, children, grand-
children, and great-grandchildren. Mul-
tiple lifetimes may not have been long 
enough for all Allen Noble had in mind 
and was so capable of accomplishing, 
but he certainly made his time on 
earth count—putting strong founda-
tions under his ideas and steadfastly 
helping others.∑

REMEMBERING FRED C. ADAMS 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, through the 
summer and fall, in the growing town 
of Cedar City, UT, hundreds of people 
will fill the seats of the Engelstad 
Shakespeare Theater, modeled after 
the Globe, to enjoy a showing of Peri-
cles, Prince of Tyre by William Shake-
speare. Families will cry and cheer, 
gasp and giggle as they enjoy a Utah 
tradition: the annual Utah Shake-
speare Festival. 
Each year, for the last six decades, 
families from around the world have 
flocked to the campus of Southern 
Utah University to enjoy productions 
of the Bard’s best works. Founded in 
1961, the Utah Shakespeare Festival is 
a prime example of how private initia-
tive can catalyze growth and unite 
community. 
Nobody 
embodies 
this 
story 
more 
vividly 
than 
Fred 
C. 
Adams, the festival’s founder. 
As a young man, Fred made acting 
look easy. Not only did he develop a 
passion for the world of theater, he 
also 
demonstrated 
a 
knack 
for 
stagecraft. Over time, his talent and 
passion developed from a hobby into a 
career. 
Years before the Utah Shakespeare 
Festival put on its first show, Fred 
served his country from the Pentagon. 
During the Korean war, he was in 
charge of entertainment and morale. 
Having grown up acting, he dedicated 
himself to the work of production and 
performance, bringing joy and bril-
liance to those who served with him. 
After his service during the Korean 
war, Fred returned to his home in 
southern Utah in 1961. At that time, 
hundreds of thousands of tourists vis-
ited each summer to see the area’s na-
tional parks by day, but by night, there 
was little to do. It was around that 
same time that a new freeway exit was 
planned along I–15, Utah’s primary 
interstate highway, right in the heart 
of Cedar City. Excited by the prospect 
of growth, Fred saw an opportunity. 
One day, while he and his girlfriend 
Barbara, who later became his wife, 
were in the Fluffy Bundle Laundromat, 
daydreaming while waiting for their 
laundry to dry, the two thought up an 
idea. Both Fred and Barbara were pas-
sionate about theater, and Fred even 
taught theater classes at the local Col-
lege of Southern Utah. ‘‘Why not start 
a Shakespearean festival in Cedar 
City?’’ they thought. With a bit of 
funding and the help of friends, the 
idea seemed like it could become a re-
ality. Eager to learn more about how 
such a festival might come to be, Fred 
left the laundromat, packed up his 
bags, and headed to Ashland, OR, where 
the Oregon Shakespeare Festival takes 
place each year. 
When Fred got to Oregon, he was be-
friended by Angus Bowmer, the founder 
of the Oregon Shakespearean Festival. 
After a few days of observation there, 
Fred returned to Cedar City and then 
set out with Barbara, Barbara’s mother 
Louise, and two theater students to 
visit theaters in Canada and Con-
necticut. On the road, the Utah Shake-
speare Festival was born. 
Fred eagerly approached the Cedar 
City Council and the Chamber of Com-
merce to tell them about his plan to 
attract people to Cedar City. Their re-
action was dismal. Fred once re-
counted: ‘‘the idea went over like a 
pregnant pole vaulter . . . they thought 
it was a dumb idea, really dumb.’’ De-
spite the lack of enthusiasm, however, 
the local Lions Club agreed to under-
write his plan with $1,000 after he told 
them the festival expected to recover 
all of the money in ticket sales. Hope-
ful and excited about the first season of 
the Utah Shakespeare Festival, Fred 
set out to show just how significant the 
economic impact of the festival could 
be on Cedar City. 
To demonstrate the reach of the fes-
tival, Fred went out and got hundreds 
of silver dollars upon which he painted 
a red line. The stage was set. Each 
time someone paid for a ticket at the 
festival and needed change, the ticket 
counter would give them a painted sil-
ver dollar. Little by little, the dollars 
began to enter circulation and people 
in the city wondered where the painted 
coins were from. Just 3 weeks after 
Fred began painting coins, he attended 
a chamber of commerce meeting in 
Cedar City. In the meeting, he was 
asked if he knew anything about the 
silver dollars with a red line on them. 
He laughed and responded, ‘‘that is the 
economic impact of the Shakespeare 
Festival in Cedar City!’’ 
That first season of the festival saw 
productions of ‘‘The Taming of the 
Shrew,’’ ‘‘Hamlet,’’ and ‘‘The Merchant 
of Venice,’’ performed by a small com-
pany of Fred’s students, friends, and 
neighbors. Over 3,000 people attended 
the shows during the 2-week-long sea-
son. After paying off their debts, the 
festival had also raised an impressive 
$2,000 to help put on a second season 
the following year. 
Since that first year, the Utah 
Shakespeare Festival has grown to 
serve more than 110,000 patrons, who 
view nearly 300 plays each year in 
three theaters over a 16-week season. 
The festival has become a year-round 
operation with over 30 full-time em-
ployees and a budget of over $7 million. 
Fred’s 
work 
catalyzed 
tremendous 
growth. 
The festival has received many na-
tional 
awards, 
including 
the 
2011 
Emmy Award for its production of ‘‘A 
Midsummer Night’s Dream,’’ the 2001 
National Governors Association Award 
for Distinguished Service in the Arts, 
and most notably the Tony Award for 
Outstanding Regional Theatre in 2000. 
Fred’s work united the community to 
accomplish something truly remark-
able. 
After 44 years as executive producer, 
Fred retired from an active role with 
the festival but, despite his retirement, 
could never fully step away. Not a day 
went by that he wasn’t seen at the fes-
tival either directing shows, acting on-
stage, raising funds, or pulling weeds in 
the Shakespeare statue garden. Fred 
loved his work and those he worked 
with dearly, cherishing them all his 
life. 
In February of last year, after a 22- 
year battle with cancer, Fred was re-
united with his late wife Barbara. To-
gether, he and Barbara had dreamed up 
the Utah Shakespeare Festival and 
made their dream a reality. Surely, he 
and Barbara are now working hard to 
put on heavenly productions with the 
help of angels. 
Fred’s life story is a testament to 
how personal initiative can catalyze

growth and unite community. He tire-
lessly worked to see his dream of a 
Utah Shakespeare Festival realized and 
tirelessly loved his family, his friends, 
and his community along the way. And 
as a result, Cedar City has grown, the 
festival has drawn international praise, 
and we all benefit from the example he 
has left behind. 
So when times are tough, when work 
seems monotonous, and when dreams 
seem far-fetched or far-gone, remember 
Fred. His story can inspire us all.∑

TRIBUTE TO MILDRED JANZEN 
∑ Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I want to 
congratulate and pay tribute to Mil-
dred Schindler Janzen, a World War II 
survivor and author of the memoir, 
‘‘Surviving Hitler, Evading Stalin.’’ 
Mildred was born in Great Bend, KS, 
in 1929 to German parents. Shortly 
after her birth, her family returned to 
Germany to take care of the family 
farm. Growing up in Nazi Germany, 
World War II completely disrupted 
Mildred’s childhood and her family’s 
life. Mildred and her family were driv-
en away from their home, separated 
from each other, and forced to become 
refugees in their own country. As a 
teenager, Mildred and her family were 
captured by Russian soldiers, and even-
tually, her father was led away to 
never be seen again. After returning to 
their family farm, she and her mother 
and brother were displaced once again 
by Polish soldiers. 
Mildred experienced the horrors of 
World War II and her courage in shar-
ing her story should be commended. 
After the war and with the help of her 
American birth certificate, Mildred 
was able to return to the United States 
to live with relatives. Back in the 
United States, Mildred came back to 
Kansas, to her birthplace. She settled 
in Ellsworth, KS, where she attended 
high 
school, 
learned 
English, 
and 
worked at a local bank. During her 
time in high school, Mildred met and 
married Leon Janzen, and they had 
four children together: Karen, Kenton, 
Susan, and Galen. 
After sharing her story with many 
others, Mildred decided to write a 
memoir. It is her hope that releasing 
this memoir will help prevent history 
from repeating itself. Mildred’s bravery 
and resilience is a testament to her 
strong character. Her choice to rise 
above past hardships and instead focus 
on a life filled with happiness, persist-
ence, and love is a prime example of 
the enduring survivor that Mildred is. 
Today, Mildred spends her time gar-
dening, baking, being active within her 
church and being with family. She em-
bodies a true Kansan: determined, 
hard-working, and committed to her 
community. 
Mildred, I congratulate you on the 
release of your memoir and thank you 
for demonstrating to Kansans and the 
world your outstanding courage and 
character. Thank you for telling your 
story.∑ 
RECOGNIZING SOUTHCENTRAL 
VETERINARY SERVICES 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Southcentral Veterinary Serv-
ices, a family-owned small business in 
Bowling Green, KY, as the Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
In 2011, Dr. Eddie Grimes and his 
wife, 
Nicole 
Grimes, 
founded 
Southcentral 
Veterinary 
Services— 
SVS—in Bowling Green, KY. Growing 
up in Warren County, Dr. Grimes and 
Nicole were childhood friends and both 
attended Western Kentucky Univer-
sity—WKU—where Dr. Grimes majored 
in animal science and Nicole studied fi-
nance. The couple, high school sweet-
hearts, married after graduating from 
WKU in 2000. Dr. Grimes went on to 
earn his doctorate of veterinary medi-
cine 
from 
Auburn 
University 
and 
worked as a veterinarian for a few 
years before moving back to Bowling 
Green. With Nicole, who had experience 
in the banking industry, by his side, 
Dr. Grimes established Southcentral 
Veterinary Services. 
Today, 
Southcentral 
Veterinary 
Services provides exceptional mixed 
animal care in Warren County, KY. Ini-
tially, Dr. Grimes worked out of his 
truck and provided ambulatory veteri-
nary services; however, the business 
grew quickly and expanded to a phys-
ical location that provides grooming 
and boarding services, in addition to 
veterinary care. Being very hands on 
with the daily operations at SVS, in 
addition 
to 
being 
co-owners, 
Dr. 
Grimes is one of the veterinarians, and 
Nicole is the human resource manager. 
Together, they lead a team of more 
than 10 employees, including a second 
veterinarian, to meet the animal needs 
of the community. Since opening its 
doors, Southcentral Veterinary Serv-
ices has been recognized by local and 
industry 
publications 
for 
its 
out-
standing, high-quality veterinary care. 
Furthermore, for the last 3 years, 
Southcentral Veterinary Services was 
recognized as Bowling Green’s Best 
Veterinarian, and in 2020, SVS earned 
the title of Bowling Green’s Best Pet 
Groomer. 
Outside of being business owners, Dr. 
Grimes and Nicole can be found giving 
back to their community. Southcentral 
Veterinary 
Services 
has 
sponsored 
local youth sports teams and regularly 
hires local high school and college stu-
dents, providing training and men-
toring to students interested in pur-
suing a career in veterinary medicine. 
One of these students is the Grimes’ 
son, Garrett, who works part-time as a 
veterinary assistant and one day as-
pires to follow in his father’s footsteps 
becoming a veterinarian himself. Dr. 
Grimes and Nicole’s charitable acts 
don’t stop at mentoring students. No-
tably, 
the 
Grimes 
established 
4AnnieGirl, an organization dedicated 
to raising awareness of Spinal Mus-
cular Atrophy—SMA—after their sec-
ond child, Annie, who was born with 
SMA, passed away from the terminal 
disease that causes weakness and loss 
of voluntary muscles. After cherishing 
9 precious months with their baby girl, 
the Grimes sought to help other fami-
lies affected by this disease by pro-
moting early testing, research, and 
fundraising to combat SMA through 
4AnnieGirl. By hosting speaking en-
gagements and fundraisers, 4AnnieGirl 
has raised over $30,000 for SMA re-
search 
and 
awareness. 
To 
honor 
Annie’s memory, the Grimes family re-
mains committed to raising awareness 
for SMA and to advocating for more re-
search. 
Southcentral Veterinary Services is 
a remarkable example of the positive 
role that family-owned small busi-
nesses play in their communities. 
Local 
veterinary 
practices, 
like 
Southcentral 
Veterinary 
Services, 
form the heart of towns across Ken-
tucky, regularly stepping up to support 
their communities. Congratulations to 
Dr. Grimes, Nicole, and the entire team 
at Southcentral Veterinary Services. I 
wish SVS the best of luck, and I look 
forward to watching this small busi-
ness’ continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5935 
August 5, 2021 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, 
Mr. SCHUMER, Mr. CORNYN, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY, 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Mr. BOOKER, 
and Mr. MURPHY): 
S. 2654. A bill to require a declas-
sification review of certain investiga-
tion documents concerning foreign sup-
port for the terrorist attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and for other purposes; 
to 
the 
Select 
Committee 
on 
Intelligence. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today, I was very proud to introduce 
with my colleague Senator MENENDEZ, 
who is leading this effort, and Senator 
CORNYN, Senator GRASSLEY the Sep-
tember 11 Transparency Act. 
Members of this body have heard me 
talk about this issue before. It has been 
a repeated issue for me but for this 
body as well. 
We passed JASTA because we wanted 
the 9/11 families to have access to the 
courts and have their fair day in court. 
We passed the resolution in 2018 to re-
quire that the government declassify, 
to the maximum extent possible, all of 
the 
information 
surrounding 
9/11. 
JASTA was passed over President 
Obama’s veto. His veto was overridden 
on a bipartisan basis. The resolution 
demanding more declassification was 
passed with overwhelming bipartisan 
support and signed by the President. 
The letters that we have written, the 
questions that I posed in hearings, the 
press conferences held, the constant ef-
fort to provide documents and informa-
tion to those families so they can have 
their fair day in court has been a con-
tinuing and constant one and, so far, 
completely unavailable. 
Administration 
after 
administra-
tion—Obama, Trump, and hopefully 
not but apparently Biden—have re-
sisted these calls for declassifying and 
disclosure. 
That information is evidence that 
those families need to seek justice in 
their effort to hold accountable the 
Government of Saudi Arabia for its al-
leged complicity, its aiding and abet-
ting, its support for the 9/11 attack. 
They want to hold them liable in an 
American court, which JASTA enables 
them to do. They want to pinpoint re-
sponsibility and liability so that we 
will know, as Americans, whether the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was, in fact, 
complicit 
and 
supportive 
of 
those 
attackers. 
The truth they seek is not just for 
themselves; it is for the American peo-
ple, and the concealment by successive 
administrations denies the American 
people the truth they deserve and need. 
Today, I was proud to stand with 
Senator MENENDEZ and some of those 
families led by Terry Strada and Brett 
Eagleson in front of this Capitol as we 
announced our introduction of the act, 
the September 11 Transparency Act, 
that would very simply require the Di-
rector of National Intelligence, the At-
torney General, and the Director of the 
CIA to conduct declassification reviews 
of certain investigative documents in 
their 9/11 file. It is a baby step toward 
full disclosure and truthtelling. 
But I was so proud to stand with 
these families, represented by Terry 
Strada, among others, when she said: 
Yes, we know the Kingdom played a major 
role in supporting, and financing al Qaeda 
and evidence demonstrates that Saudi agents 
who the Kingdom sent here aided and abet-
ted some if not all the 19 hijackers leading 
into the attack. 
It is an indisputable fact the hijackers 
were living in our country 12–18 months prior 
to 9/11 planning and plotting the murder of 
thousands and that the FBI and the CIA 
knew of at least two of them, Nawaf Al- 
Hamzi and Khalid Al-Midhar. 
She further said: 
By keeping evidence hidden that will shed 
light on the brutal murder of our loved ones, 
our own government is not only perpet-
uating our continued pain and suffering, but 
it is also leaving the facilitators of the at-
tacks unaccountable and our nation vulner-
able to terrorist attacks. 
Her remarks were so powerful, I hope 
that every one of my colleagues will 
read them. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent the remarks from Terry Strada be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
September 11th will mark the 20th anniver-
sary of the murder of my husband Tom and 
nearly 3,000 people; all brutally slain on or-
ders given by the known Saudi terrorist, 
Usama bin Laden and his 19 mostly Saudi 
Islamist al Qaeda terrorists when they infil-
trated our country and carried out the dead-
liest terrorist attack in our nation’s history. 
For reasons I do not know and cannot fath-
om, a select group of FBI and CIA operatives 
knew some of the 19 hijackers were known 
terrorists traveling freely on American soil 
using their real names. How much of their 
planning and plotting were they privy to—I 
do not know, but clearly, the agencies did 
absolutely nothing to stop them and failed 
at the most important job they had; they 
failed to protect America and her populace. 
Along with the entire world, I watched in 
horror our country under a violent attack. I 
witnessed on live television the toxic black 
smoke billowing from the north tower. I 
spoke with my husband and heard first-hand 
the fear and panic he and my dear friends 
were experiencing in the hell-fire they were 
engulfed in. I watched the North Tower col-
lapse, knowing the father of my three chil-
dren and my husband’s life was being extin-
guished right before my eyes. 
Now, 20 years later, the DOJ and FBI con-
tinue to protect the very country who pro-
duced 15 of the 19 hijackers, the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia. 
Yes, we know the Kingdom played a major 
role in supporting, and financing al Qaeda 
and evidence demonstrates that Saudi agents 
who the Kingdom sent here aided and abet-
ted some if not all the 19 hijackers leading 
into the attack. 
It is an indisputable fact the hijackers 
were living in our country 12–18 months prior 
to 9/11 planning and plotting the murder of 
thousands and that the FBI and CIA knew of 
at least two of them, Nawaf Al-Hamzi and 
Khalid Al-Midhar. 
Rather than hold the Kingdom account-
able, the State Department, FBI, and the 
CIA continue to betray the 9/11 community 
and cower to the Kingdom’s desperate pleas 
of keeping Saudi Arabia’s involvement in 
murdering our loved ones a secret, while the 
Department of Justice ignores our pleas for 
the truth; instead, choosing to help keep the 
Kingdom’s dirty little secret—that they sup-
port radical Islamist terrorism and the hate-
ful ideology that spawned the largest mass 
murder in our country’s history and death of 
my husband and our children’s father . . . for 
what and why I ask? 
Every Administration since 9/11 continues 
to turn their backs on us, the victims’ fam-
ily members and survivors. Why are we 
standing here today adversaries to the FBI 
and Department of Justice instead of al-
lies?—And perversely, why do they stand as 
allies to the Kingdom against us? 
Critical documents are being held from 
public view because the DOJ refuses to re-
lease them in any format. In fact, in many 
cases they have refused to even look at docu-
ments responsive to the subpoena served on 
them in April 2018. Instead, our government 
argues it would just be too much of a burden 
for the most advanced country of the free 
world to review documents it is supposed to 
be vigilant about retaining from one of the 
most important investigations the Country 
has ever performed. Let me underscore 
that—we, the 9/11 Community—we the Amer-
ican public—are too burdensome in the eyes 
of the bureaucracy. We are asking too much 
for them to tell us what they uncovered in 
looking into the attacks on all of us. 
By keeping evidence hidden that will shed 
light on the brutal murder of our loved ones, 
our own government is not only perpet-
uating our continued pain and suffering, but 
it is also leaving the facilitators of the at-
tacks unaccountable and our nation vulner-
able to future terrorist attacks. 
This travesty of justice must come to an 
end in order for this chapter of our lives to 
close and keep Americans safe from the end-
less grief and gruesome carnage terrorist at-
tacks leave behind. 
For two decades, Congress has shown a 
united front and been a staunch supporter 
for transparency regarding 9/11 and our quest 
for the truth. Many here today have walked 
beside us on our path of grief. They have 
worked hard for us and the American people 
by passing a resolution to release the ‘‘28 
pages’’ excised from the Joint Inquiry. Those 
pages offered us clear facts about the Saudis 
involvement in 9/11. Congress also worked for 
seven years on the Justice Against Sponsors 
of Terrorism Act—JASTA; ultimately voting 
unanimously for its passage with unfettered 
enthusiasm and then overriding a Presi-
dential veto to enact JASTA, cementing our 
right to our day in court and we believed— 
ensuring all evidence would see the light of 
day. 
No one standing here today anticipated the 
level of pushback, lack of respect, or the ex-
tent to which our State Department, the De-
partment of Justice, and the FBI would go to 
withhold vital investigative reports from the 
9/11 community and the nation at large—all 
in an effort to protect the Kingdom from em-
barrassment and accountability. 
Attorney General Garland, Director of Na-
tional Intelligence Haines, FBI Director 
Wray and the State Department—by ignor-
ing our direct pleas to them—are showing us 
where their loyalty lies time and time 
again—with a foreign nation capable of mur-
dering their own. 
Aside from the occasional disingenuous 
words to recognize our loss—by protecting 
the Saudis they have not shown their alle-
giance to us the American public and the 
victims’ family members and survivors. 
They have ignored numerous letters, not 
only from us, but from several members of

Congress as well. We have never been met 
with such disdain. Not only have they 
snubbed our invitations to meet in person, 
the DOJ has fought vigorously to avoid pro-
ducing mountains of documents responsive 
to subpoenas served on the government over 
three years ago. 
This legislation in the Congress and I pray 
this Administration will right that wrong. 
While the DOJ claims it has distributed 
thousands of pages to our representatives, 
that claim falls patently short of what was 
requested. Instead of allowing the DOJ to 
continue cherry picking what documents it 
wants to release and tolerating their inde-
fensible excuse that it would be ‘‘too burden-
some’’ to search their files, we now have the 
full force of the United States Senate—and 
we anticipate all of Congress—supporting a 
full declassification review process for all 
relevant documents related to the Saudis 
and 9/11. 
As a tragic result of 9/11 and the war on 
terror tomorrow will sadly mark the 10th an-
niversary of the deadliest incident and larg-
est loss of life in the Naval Special Warfare, 
when 30 American troops, including 16 com-
mandos from the Navy’s Seal Team 6 Call 
Sign Extortion 16, helicopter was shot down 
killing all on board in the Tangi Valley, 
Wardak Province in Afghanistan. They were 
there fighting for all of us, rooting out the 
evil created by the Kingdom that threatens 
our freedoms and our way of life. 
The truths we seek with ‘‘The 9/11 Trans-
parency Act’’ are not just for us, but for all 
of our fallen heroes. May every brave war-
rior, rescue worker and those who have died 
from 9/11 related illnesses rest in peace. 
We sincerely thank Senator Menendez and 
these Senators introducing ’The 9/11 Trans-
parency Act’’; another great bipartisan ef-
fort from our esteemed leaders and ask that 
the entire body of Congress act bravely and 
cohesively in support of our right to know 
what the government has uncovered about 
who facilitated the attacks on us 20 years 
ago. Yes, let us never forget—but let us 
never let it happen again. Thank you. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. We are fast ap-
proaching 9/11, the 20th anniversary of 
that horrific, unspeakable murder of 
thousands of our fellow citizens, in-
cluding Terry Strada’s husband and 
Brett Eagleson’s father. 
Brett Eagleson put it very, very 
starkly and simply. I am not quoting, 
but essentially his warning to us ought 
to reverberate in these Halls. Public of-
ficials on that anniversary will be 
making speeches about how we should 
never forget, about how we need to 
commemorate the memories of all who 
perished in 9/11. But, as he said, their 
words will ring shallow or hollow if 
their own government continues to 
refuse to disclose documents and evi-
dence needed for them to seek justice. 
Those families deserve better. 
And the cause is bigger than just 
those families. It is the American peo-
ple who deserve better. They deserve 
and they need to know the truth about 
whether the complicity and other 
kinds of potential criminal activity 
can be proved in a court of law, can be 
used to learn about future action to be 
taken. If Agencies of the U.S. Govern-
ment, including our intelligence Agen-
cies, knew about those attackers and 
the danger they posed and failed to 
take sufficient action, we should know 
those facts as well. 
It is incomprehensible why the U.S. 
Government has failed to provide this 
truth to the American people. There 
has been no explanation for the failure 
to declassify. There is no explanation 
for invoking the State Secrets Act. The 
courts have said that that privilege, 
the state secrets privilege, cannot be 
invoked unless it could reasonably be 
expected that there would be a harm to 
our national security. No Agency, no 
official of the U.S. Government has 
ever said what harm could result, espe-
cially 20 years after that attack. 
The idea that sources or methods 
could be endangered seems farfetched. 
Certainly, there has been no such con-
tention. The idea that maybe the 
Saudis would be embarrassed is a pos-
sible explanation, but it is no excuse— 
none—for refusing to declassify and 
disclose this information. The fact that 
the Saudis may be embarrassed or they 
may be held liable is no valid reason to 
withhold this truth from those families 
and from the American people. 
The administration, at the very 
least, owes us an explanation. We de-
manded it again and again at the At-
torney General’s confirmation hearing, 
at the oversight hearings for the Direc-
tor of the FBI, at hearings for con-
firming lower but top-ranking officials 
of the Department of Justice, and 
every one of them has promised to look 
into it but nothing back—no expla-
nation, no justification. 
So Senator MENENDEZ and I, along 
with our colleagues Senators CORNYN 
and GRASSLEY, have introduced the 
September 11th Transparency Act. It 
wouldn’t require the declassification of 
any document, but it would require the 
review, and it is not unprecedented, be-
cause this Congress, 7 years ago, passed 
and President Obama signed the Intel-
ligence Authorization Act for the fiscal 
year 2014. It had a similar provision re-
quiring the Director of National Intel-
ligence to complete a declassification 
review of documents collected during 
the Osama bin Laden raid in Pakistan 
in 2011. 
This measure should have broad bi-
partisan support, just as JASTA did 
and the resolution calling for declas-
sification in 2018, and I have been proud 
to stand with my Republican col-
leagues in favor of simple justice. 
As Senator SCHUMER said today at 
that meeting in front of the Capitol, 
‘‘Justice, justice, justice.’’ That is 
what these families deserve. That is 
what the American people should ex-
pect of their government, not conceal-
ment or obstruction and obfuscation. 
Right now, these families are in a 
struggle against the Government of 
Saudi Arabia but, equally so, against 
their own government in seeking fair-
ness 
and 
transparency, 
disclosure, 
when it counts for them and when it 
should count for the American people. 
We will continue this fight. I don’t 
expect any single speech will persuade 
administration officials—certainly no 
single speech of mine—but they are 
going to be making speeches as we go 
closer to 9/11. Let them keep in mind 
that the voices and faces of those fami-
lies—Brett Eagleson and Terry Strada 
and others who were there that day and 
many others in Connecticut, as well as 
New Jersey and New York and all 
around the country—will be there as 
well, and ultimately, our government 
must be held accountable for telling 
the American people the truth. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in a 
little over a month, we will remember 
one of the most horrific events to ever 
occur on U.S. soil. The lives of those 
we lost can never be replaced. But their 
memories forever live on through their 
spouses, children, family, and friends. 
For the last 20 years, the Federal 
Government has failed these individ-
uals. Tens of thousands of pages of doc-
uments relating to the September 11, 
2001, terrorist attacks remain classi-
fied. Without their release, victims, 
their families, and the public still do 
not have the full picture of everything 
that led up to that day and who was in-
volved. While some of these documents 
must remain classified for defense or 
national 
security 
reasons, 
a 
com-
prehensive review of these materials is 
long overdue. In fact, in 2004, the chair-
men of the 9/11 Commission, Tom Kean 
and Lee Hamilton, wrote that this de-
classification review should be con-
ducted no later than 2009. 
We have fallen short. But today, I 
hope to remedy this wrong, and I am 
proud to join my colleagues, Senators 
MENENDEZ, CORNYN, and BLUMENTHAL, 
on the bipartisan September 11 Trans-
parency Act of 2021. The bill follows fa-
miliar legislative precedent, requiring 
that any documents that can be re-
leased, must be released. It is the same 
step Congress took in requiring the ex-
ecutive branch to conduct a full review 
of 
the 
documents 
captured 
at 
Abbottabad during the Osama Bin 
Laden raid and publish all materials to 
the fullest-extent possible. 
This is not the first time I have re-
quested 
this 
review. 
In 
2018, 
I 
coponsored a Senate Resolution calling 
on the administration to declassify 9/11 
documents to the greatest extent pos-
sible. I am sad to say, that review was 
never conducted. Last year, I joined 
my colleagues on a letter to Inspector 
General Horowitz, asking for an IG in-
vestigation into the FBI’s handing of 
the 9/11 classified documents. We never 
received a response. 
I have been a long-standing champion 
of victims of terror, injured or killed 
both at home and abroad. For example, 
in 1992, I sponsored the Anti-Terrorism 
Act, allowing Americans who fall vic-
tim to acts of terrorism while abroad 
to seek damages in U.S. courts, and 
subsequent clarifying laws. And I plan 
to continue to stand firm for these in-
dividuals. 
September 11 is a wrong that can 
never be righted. But we can be on the 
right side of history and finally put lin-
gering questions to rest by expedi-
tiously declassifying any documents

held by the Federal Government re-
lated to 9/11 to the greatest extent pos-
sible. 
Thank you. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mrs. GILLIBRAND): 
S. 2669. A bill to ban the use of ortho- 
phthalate chemicals as food contact 
substances; 
to 
the 
Committee 
on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the ‘‘Pre-
venting 
Harmful 
Exposure 
to 
Phthalates Act.’’ This bill would ban 
harmful 
chemicals 
known 
as 
phthalates from products used in food 
processing and packaging and would re-
quire the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to review other products under its 
purview that might also expose Ameri-
cans to harmful phthalates. 
The harm associated with phthalate 
exposure 
is 
well-documented, 
with 
studies showing that prenatal exposure 
to these chemicals can have lasting 
consequences to child brain develop-
ment and increase children’s risks for 
learning, attention, and behavioral dis-
orders. 
We also know that women are dis-
proportionately affected by phthalates 
through 
higher 
exposure 
to 
these 
harmful chemicals in personal care 
products, like nail polish, fragrances, 
and hair products, as compared to men. 
Pregnant 
women’s 
exposure 
to 
phthalates has been shown to decrease 
fetal testosterone and harm reproduc-
tive development in male babies. Black 
and Latina women are also dispropor-
tionately affected, experiencing higher 
exposure to certain phthalates com-
pared to white women. 
Studies 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
Americans are exposed to phthalates 
through our diet. Phthalates from pro-
duction materials involved in food 
processing and packaging are able to 
leach into our food. These materials in-
clude plastic equipment such as tubing 
used in commercial dairy operations, 
lid gaskets, food preparation gloves, 
conveyor belts, and food packaging ma-
terials. 
People are also exposed to phthalates 
found in medical devices, flooring, and 
other home furnishing and building 
materials. The fact that phthalate ex-
posure often comes from multiple 
sources simultaneously further empha-
sizes the unknown collective health 
risk that these harmful chemicals pose. 
We 
must 
remove 
these 
harmful 
chemicals 
from 
consumer 
products 
with the utmost urgency. Congress has 
already banned them from children’s 
toys and child care products due to the 
serious long-term health effects that 
they pose. We now need to remove 
them from our food packaging and the 
other remaining consumer products 
that are slowly poisoning us. 
The ‘‘Preventing Harmful Exposure 
to Phthalates Act’’ would specifically 
ban phthalates from being used in ma-
terials that touch food and ensure that 
any substance used as a replacement is 
safe. 
The bill would also require a review 
of other products to determine whether 
they lead to phthalate exposure. This 
review would need to include consider-
ation of whether communities of color 
are disproportionately exposed to these 
harmful products as well as the health 
effects caused by exposure and any in-
creased risk of preterm birth, low birth 
weight, or other risks to children’s 
health. 
I want to thank Senator GILLIBRAND 
for joining me in introducing this im-
portant legislation, as well as Rep-
resentatives LIEU and PORTER, who are 
sponsoring companion legislation in 
the House. 
I also want to thank the health and 
consumer safety organizations for their 
support for this bill, including the 
American 
Academy 
of 
Pediatrics, 
American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, Breast Cancer Preven-
tion Partners, Earthjustice, Endocrine 
Society, 
Environmental 
Working 
Group, Healthy Babies Bright Futures, 
and Project TENDR. 
Families deserve to know that the 
products they’re consuming aren’t ex-
posing them to unnecessary harm. I 
look forward to working with my col-
leagues on this important issue, and I 
urge my fellow Senators to cosponsor 
the ‘‘Preventing Harmful Exposure to 
Phthalates Act.’’ 
Thank you Mr. President, and I yield 
the floor. 
By Mr. SCHUMER: 
S. 2670. A bill to provide for redis-
tricting reform, and for other purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 2670 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Redis-
tricting Reform Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHOR-
ITY. 
Congress finds that it has the authority to 
establish the terms and conditions States 
must follow in carrying out congressional re-
districting after an apportionment of Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives be-
cause— 
(1) the authority granted to Congress 
under article I, section 4 of the Constitution 
of the United States gives Congress the 
power to enact laws governing the time, 
place, and manner of elections for Members 
of the House of Representatives; and 
(2) the authority granted to Congress 
under section 5 of the 14th amendment to the 
Constitution gives Congress the power to 
enact laws to enforce section 2 of such 
amendment, which requires Representatives 
to be apportioned among the several States 
according to their number. 
TITLE I—REQUIREMENTS FOR 
CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING 
SEC. 101. REQUIRING CONGRESSIONAL REDIS-
TRICTING 
TO

PLAN
REQUIRED.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, and ex-
cept as provided in subsection (c), any con-
gressional redistricting conducted by a State 
shall be conducted in accordance with—

acted into law by the independent redis-
tricting 
commission 
established 
in 
the 
State, in accordance with title II; or 
(2) if a plan developed by such commission 
is not enacted into law, the redistricting 
plan developed and enacted into law by a 3- 
judge court, in accordance with section 301. 
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 22(c) 
of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to provide for 
the fifteenth and subsequent decennial cen-
suses and to provide for apportionment of 
Representatives in Congress’’, approved June

ing ‘‘in the manner provided by the law 
thereof’’ and inserting ‘‘in the manner pro-
vided by the Redistricting Reform Act of 
2021’’. 
(c) SPECIAL RULE
FOR EXISTING COMMIS-
SIONS.—Subsection (a) does not apply to any 
State in which, under law in effect continu-
ously on and after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, congressional redistricting is 
carried out in accordance with a plan devel-
oped and approved by an independent redis-
tricting commission that is in compliance 
with each of the following requirements: 
(1) PUBLICLY AVAILABLE APPLICATION PROC-
ESS.—Membership on the commission is open 
to citizens of the State through a publicly 
available application process. 
(2) DISQUALIFICATIONS
FOR

viduals who, for a covered period of time as 
established by the State, hold or have held 
public office, individuals who are or have 
been candidates for elected public office, and 
individuals who serve or have served as an 
officer, employee, or paid consultant of a 
campaign committee of a candidate for pub-
lic office are disqualified from serving on the 
commission. 
(3) SCREENING FOR CONFLICTS.—Individuals 
who apply to serve on the commission are 
screened through a process that excludes 
persons with conflicts of interest from the 
pool of potential commissioners. 
(4) MULTI-PARTISAN COMPOSITION.—Member-
ship on the commission represents those who 
are affiliated with the 2 political parties 
whose candidates received the most votes in 
the most recent statewide election for Fed-
eral office held in the State, as well as those 
who are unaffiliated with any party or who 
are affiliated with political parties other 
than the 2 political parties whose candidates 
received the most votes in the most recent 
statewide election for Federal office held in 
the State. 
(5) CRITERIA FOR REDISTRICTING.—Members 
of the commission are required to meet cer-
tain criteria in the map drawing process, in-
cluding minimizing the division of commu-
nities of interest and a ban on drawing maps 
to favor a political party. 
(6) PUBLIC INPUT.—Public hearings are held 
and comments from the public are accepted 
before a final map is approved. 
(7) BROAD-BASED SUPPORT FOR APPROVAL OF 
FINAL PLAN.—The approval of the final redis-

(C) Members who are not affiliated with 
any political party or who are affiliated with 
political parties other than the political par-
ties described in subparagraphs (A) and (B). 
(d) TREATMENT
OF STATE
OF IOWA.—Sub-
section (a) does not apply to the State of 
Iowa, so long as congressional redistricting 
in such State is carried out in accordance 
with a plan developed by the Iowa Legisla-
tive Services Agency with the assistance of a 
Temporary Redistricting Advisory Commis-
sion, under law which was in effect for the 
most recent congressional redistricting car-
ried out in the State prior to the date of the 
enactment of this Act and which remains in 
effect continuously on and after the date of 
the enactment of this Act. 
SEC. 102. BAN ON MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING. 
A State that has been redistricted in ac-
cordance with this Act and a State described 
in section 101(c) may not be redistricted 
again until after the next apportionment of 
Representatives under section 22(a) of the 
Act entitled ‘‘An Act to provide for the fif-
teenth and subsequent decennial censuses 
and to provide for an apportionment of Rep-
resentatives in Congress’’, approved June 18, 
1929 (2 U.S.C. 2a), unless a court requires the 
State to conduct such subsequent redis-
tricting to comply with the Constitution of 
the United States, the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), the Constitution 
of the State, or the terms or conditions of 
this Act. 
SEC. 103. CRITERIA FOR REDISTRICTING. 
(a) CRITERIA.—Under the redistricting plan 
of a State, there shall be established single- 
member congressional districts using the fol-
lowing criteria as set forth in the following 
order of priority: 
(1) Districts shall comply with the United 
States Constitution, including the require-
ment that they equalize total population. 
(2) Districts shall comply with the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), in-
cluding by creating any districts where two 
or more politically cohesive groups pro-
tected by such Act are able to elect rep-
resentatives of choice in coalition with one 
another, and all applicable Federal laws. 
(3) Districts shall be drawn, to the extent 
that the totality of the circumstances war-
rant, to ensure the practical ability of a 
group protected under the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) to participate 
in the political process and to nominate can-
didates and to elect representatives of choice 
is not diluted or diminished, regardless of 
whether or not such protected group con-
stitutes a majority of a district’s citizen vot-
ing age population. 
(4) Districts shall respect communities of 
interest, neighborhoods, and political sub-
divisions to the extent practicable and after 
compliance with the requirements of para-
graphs (1) through (3). A community of inter-
est is defined as an area with recognized sim-
ilarities of interests, including ethnic, ra-
cial, economic, tribal, social, cultural, geo-
graphic or historic identities. The term com-
munities of interest may, in certain cir-
cumstances, include political subdivisions 
such as counties, municipalities, tribal lands 
and reservations, or school districts, but 
shall not include common relationships with 
political parties or political candidates. 
(b) NO FAVORING OR DISFAVORING OF POLIT-
ICAL PARTIES.— 
(1) PROHIBITION.—The redistricting plan en-
acted by a State shall not, when considered 
on a Statewide basis, be drawn with the in-
tent or the effect of unduly favoring or 
disfavoring any political party. 
(2) DETERMINATION OF EFFECT.— 
(A) TOTALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES.—For pur-
poses of paragraph (1), the determination of 
whether a redistricting plan has the effect of 
unduly favoring or disfavoring a political 
party shall be based on the totality of cir-
cumstances, including evidence regarding 
the durability and severity of a plan’s par-
tisan bias. 
(B) PLANS DEEMED TO HAVE EFFECT OF UN-
DULY FAVORING OR DISFAVORING A POLITICAL 
PARTY.—Without limiting other ways in 
which a redistricting plan may be deter-
mined to have the effect of unduly favoring 
or disfavoring a political party under the to-
tality of circumstances under subparagraph 
(A), a redistricting plan shall be deemed to 
have the effect of unduly favoring or 
disfavoring a political party if— 
(i) modeling based on relevant historical 
voting patterns shows that the plan is statis-
tically likely to result in a partisan bias of 
more than one seat in States with 20 or fewer 
congressional districts or a partisan bias of 
more than 2 seats in States with more than 
20 congressional districts, as determined 
using quantitative measures of partisan fair-
ness, which may include, but are not limited 
to, the seats-to-votes curve for an enacted 
plan, the efficiency gap, the declination, par-
tisan asymmetry, and the mean-median dif-
ference; and 
(ii) alternative plans, which may include, 
but are not limited to, those generated by re-
districting algorithms, exist that could have 
complied with the requirements of law and 
not been in violation of paragraph (1). 
(3) DETERMINATION
OF
INTENT.—For pur-
poses of paragraph (1), a rebuttable presump-
tion shall exist that a redistricting plan en-
acted by the legislature of a State was not 
enacted with the intent of unduly favoring 
or disfavoring a political party if the plan 
was enacted with the support of at least a 
third of the members of the second largest 
political party in each house of the legisla-
ture. 
(4) NO
VIOLATION
BASED
ON
CERTAIN
CRI-
TERIA.—No redistricting plan shall be found 
to be in violation of paragraph (1) because of 
partisan bias attributable to the application 
of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), 
or (3) of subsection (a), unless one or more 
alternative plans could have complied with 
such paragraphs without having the effect of 
unduly favoring or disfavoring a political 
party. 
(c) FACTORS PROHIBITED FROM CONSIDER-
ATION.—In developing the redistricting plan 
for the State, the independent redistricting 
commission may not take into consideration 
any of the following factors, except as nec-
essary to comply with the criteria described 
in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection

eral elections for the House of Representa-
tives.

ments of this Act, no stay shall issue which

SENATE RESOLUTION 338—DESIG-
NATING SEPTEMBER 2021 AS NA-
TIONAL DEMOCRACY MONTH AS 
A TIME TO REFLECT ON THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE SYSTEM 
OF 
GOVERNMENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
TO 
A 
MORE 
FREE AND STABLE WORLD 
Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. 
GRASSLEY) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 338 
Whereas, 2,000 years after the ancient 
Greeks laid the groundwork for democracy, 
the founders of the United States built an 
even greater system of government, a demo-
cratic republic, propelling the United States 
to become the most advanced nation in 
human history; 
Whereas the model of government of the 
United States has been reproduced around 
the world; 
Whereas, according to Freedom House, 
more than 1 in 3 people in the world do not 
live in states considered free; 
Whereas the Constitution of the United 
States and the Bill of Rights, including the 
addition of the Reconstruction Era amend-
ments, enshrine the rights and civil liberties 
of citizens of the United States, including 
the right to vote in free and fair elections; 
Whereas the perpetuation of the ideals of 
democracy does not happen on its own and 
can be stalled or reversed; 
Whereas surveys show that citizens of the 
United States are losing faith in the demo-
cratic system; 
Whereas former Supreme Court Justice 
Sandra Day O’Connor said, ‘‘The practice of 
democracy is not passed down through the 
gene pool. It must be taught and learned 
anew by each generation of citizens.’’; 
Whereas President John F. Kennedy said, 
‘‘Democracy is never a final achievement. It 
is a call to untiring effort, to continual sac-
rifice and to the willingness, if necessary, to 
die in its defense.’’; 
Whereas President Ronald Reagan said, 
‘‘Democracy is worth dying for, because it’s 
the most deeply honorable form of govern-
ment ever devised by man.’’; 
Whereas Congressman John R. Lewis said, 
in his final words to the United States, ‘‘De-
mocracy is not a state. It is an act, and each 
generation must do its part to help build 
what we called the Beloved Community, a 
nation and world society at peace with 
itself.’’; 
Whereas World War II demonstrated the 
fragility of democracy and the civilized life 
that accompanies democracy; 
Whereas British Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill observed that, ‘‘Indeed it has been 
said that democracy is the worst form of 
Government except for all those other forms 
that have been tried from time to time . . . 
.’’; 
Whereas President George Washington said 
the United States must recognize the im-
mense value of the national Union and work 
towards preservation of that Union with 
‘‘jealous anxiety’’ and wrote that the secu-
rity of a free Constitution may be accom-
plished by ‘‘teaching the people themselves 
to know and to value their own rights’’; 
Whereas 
President 
Thomas 
Jefferson 
wrote, ‘‘Educate and inform the whole mass 
of the people . . . . They are the only sure re-
liance for the preservation of our liberty.’’; 
and 
Whereas the Government of the United 
States must teach and educate the people by 
taking appropriate actions to highlight and 
emphasize the importance of democratic 
principles and the essential role of demo-
cratic principles in the freedoms and way of 
life enjoyed by the people of the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2021 as ‘‘National 
Democracy Month’’; 
(2) encourages States and local govern-
ments to designate September 2021 as ‘‘Na-
tional Democracy Month’’; 
(3) recognizes the celebration of ‘‘National 
Democracy Month’’ as a time to reflect on 
the contributions of the system of govern-
ment of the United States to a more free and 
stable world; and 
(4) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe ‘‘National Democracy 
Month’’ with appropriate ceremonies and ac-
tivities that— 
(A) provide appreciation for the system of 
government of the United States; and 
(B) demonstrate that the people of the 
United States shall never forget the sac-
rifices made by past generations of people of 
the United States to preserve the freedoms 
and principles of the United States.

Mr. MURPHY (for himself and Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 339 
Whereas ataxia is a clinical manifestation 
indicating degeneration or dysfunction of 
the brain that negatively affects the coordi-
nation, precision, and accurate timing of 
physical movements; 
Whereas ataxia can strike individuals of 
all ages, including children; 
Whereas the term ‘‘ataxia’’ is used to clas-
sify 
a 
group 
of 
rare, 
inherited 
neurodegenerative diseases including— 
(1) ataxia telangiectasia; 
(2) episodic ataxia; 
(3) Friedreich’s ataxia; and 
(4) spinocerebellar ataxia; 
Whereas there are many known types of 
genetic ataxia, but the genetic basis for 
ataxia in some patients is still unknown; 
Whereas all inherited ataxias affect fewer 
than 200,000 individuals and, therefore, are 
recognized as rare diseases under the Orphan 
Drug Act (Public Law 97–414; 96 Stat. 2049); 
Whereas some genetic ataxias are inher-
ited in an autosomal dominant manner, 
while others are inherited in an autosomal 
recessive manner; 
Whereas ataxia symptoms can also be 
caused by noninherited health conditions 
and other factors, including stroke, tumor, 
cerebral palsy, head trauma, multiple scle-
rosis, alcohol abuse, and certain medica-
tions; 
Whereas ataxia can present physical, psy-
chological, and financial challenges for pa-
tients and their families; 
Whereas symptoms and outcomes of ataxia 
progress at different rates and include—

(5) eye movement abnormalities; 
(6) difficulty walking; 
(7) tremors; 
(8) trouble eating and swallowing; 
(9) difficulties with other activities that 
require fine motor skills; and 
(10) death; 
Whereas most patients with ataxia require 
the use of assistive devices, such as wheel-
chairs and walkers, to aid in their mobility, 
and many individuals may need physical and 
occupational therapy; 
Whereas there is no treatment or cure ap-
proved by the Food and Drug Administration 
for ataxia; and 
Whereas clinical research to develop safe 
and effective treatments for ataxia is ongo-
ing: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the need for greater public 
awareness of ataxia; 
(2) expresses support for the designation of 
September 25, 2021, as ‘‘National Ataxia 
Awareness Day’’; 
(3) supports the goals of National Ataxia 
Awareness Day, which are— 
(A) to raise awareness of the causes and 
symptoms of ataxia among the general pub-
lic and health care professionals; 
(B) to improve diagnosis of ataxia and ac-
cess to care for patients affected by ataxia; 
and 
(C) to accelerate ataxia research, including 
on safe and effective treatment options and, 
ultimately, a cure; 
(4) acknowledges the challenges facing in-
dividuals in the United States who have 
ataxia and the families of those individuals;

SENATE RESOLUTION 340—OPPOS-
ING 
LEGISLATION 
MANDATING 
THE REGISTRATION OF WOMEN 
FOR 
THE 
SELECTIVE 
SERVICE 
SYSTEM 
Mr. LEE (for himself, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. 
LANKFORD, Mr. HAWLEY, Mr. DAINES, 
and Mr. WICKER) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Armed Services: 
S. RES. 340 
Whereas clause 12 of section 8 of article I of 
the Constitution of the United States em-
powers Congress with the responsibility to 
‘‘raise and support Armies’’; 
Whereas the Military Selective Service Act 
(50 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.) provides authority to 
the President to require the registration of 
male citizens of the United States, between 
the ages of 18 and 26, for the Selective Serv-
ice System; 
Whereas, when a draft for training and 
service in the Armed Forces has commenced 
under the Military Selective Service Act, the 
primary function for drafted men is to re-
place front line combatants after casualty 
losses; 
Whereas, in Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 
57 (1981), the Supreme Court of the United 
States upheld the all-male draft as constitu-
tional and held that Congress had ‘‘deter-
mined that any future draft, which would be 
facilitated by the registration scheme, would 
be characterized by a need for combat 
troops’’; 
Whereas, in 2015, nearly all combat posi-
tions in the all-volunteer force within the 
Armed Forces became open to any woman as 
long as the woman could meet certain phys-
ical fitness requirements; 
Whereas only a small subset of women are 
able to meet the physical fitness require-
ments for combat roles, and physical dis-
advantages between men and women often 
result in excessive fatigue and more frequent 
injuries to women; 
Whereas the Ground Combat Element Inte-
grated Task Force within the United States 
Marine Corps found that the musculoskeletal 
rate of injury for a woman was nearly twice 
the rate of injury for a man, and research at 
the Infantry Training Battalion found that 
the rate of injury for an enlisted women was 
6 times the rate of injury for a man; 
Whereas the results of United States Ma-
rine Corps research led General Joseph F. 
Dunford, Jr., a former commandant of the 
United States Marine Corps, to seek an ex-
emption to ensure certain Marine combat 
roles were only available to men; 
Whereas all members of Congress should 
have the opportunity to review the rationale 
provided by General Dunford for requesting 
the exemption; 
Whereas, in 2018, the United States Army 
replaced the gender-separate Army Physical 
Fitness Test with the gender-neutral Army 
Combat Fitness Test; 
Whereas United States Army data has 
demonstrated a fail rate ranging between 65 
percent and 84 percent for women and be-
tween 10 percent and 30 percent for men on 
the Army Combat Fitness Test since its in-
ception; and 
Whereas mandating the registration of 
women for Selective Service System has the 
potential to unduly increase the fatality and 
injury risks of women in the United States 
and hinder combat unit readiness in battle: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that the Senate should not pass legislation 
mandating the registration of women for Se-
lective Service System.

SEC. 4007. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TREAT-
MENT OF REDUCTION OF APPRO-
PRIATIONS 
LEVELS 
TO 
ACHIEVE 
SAVINGS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) H. Con. Res. 448 (96th Congress), the 
concurrent resolution on the budget for fis-
cal year 1981, gave authorizing committees 
reconciliation instructions which amounted 
to approximately two-thirds of the savings 
required under reconciliation. 
(2) The language in H. Con. Res. 448 re-
sulted in a debate about how reconciling dis-
cretionary spending programs could be in 
order given that authorizations of appropria-
tions for programs did not actually change 
spending and the programs authorized would 
be funded through later annual appropria-
tion. The staff of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate and the counsel to the 
Majority Leader advised that upon consulta-
tion with the Parliamentarian, the original 
instructions on discretionary spending would 
be out of order because of the phrase, ‘‘to 
modify programs’’. This was seen as too 
broad and programs could be modified with-
out resulting in changes to their future ap-
propriations. 
(3) To rectify this violation, the Com-
mittee on the Budget of the Senate reported 
S. Con. Res. 9 (97th Congress), revising the 
congressional budget for the United States 
Government for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 
1983, to include reconciliation, which revised 
the language in the reconciliation instruc-
tions to change entitlement law and ‘‘to re-
port changes in laws within the jurisdiction 
of that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings’’. 
(4) This was understood to mean changes in 
authorization language of discretionary pro-
grams would be permissible under reconcili-
ation procedures provided such changes in 
law would have the result in affecting a 
change in later outlays derived from future 
appropriations. Further it was understood 
that a change in authorization language that 
caused a change in later outlays was consid-
ered to be a change in outlays for the pur-
pose of reconciliation. 
(5) On April 2, 1981, the Senate voted 88 to 
10 to approve S. Con. Res. 9 with the modi-
fied reconciliation language. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that committees reporting 
changes in laws within the jurisdiction of 
that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings shall 
be considered to be changes in outlays for 
the purpose of enforcing the prohibition on 
extraneous matters in reconciliation bills. 
SEC. 4008. PROHIBITION ON PREEMPTIVE WAIV-
ERS. 
In the Senate, it shall not be in order to 
move to waive or suspend a point of order 
under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 
U.S.C. 621 et seq.) or any concurrent resolu-
tion on the budget with respect to a bill, 
joint 
resolution, 
motion, 
amendment,

(2) with full recognition of the constitu-

ology), that limitation shall remain in effect 
for each year until the year in which those 
full actuarial rates takes effect.

ciety, and independent news media violate the 
fundamental freedoms and basic human rights 
of the people of Nicaragua; 
(2) Congress unequivocally condemns the po-
litically motivated and unlawful detention of 
presidential candidates Cristiana Chamorro, 
Arturo Cruz, Felix Maradiaga, and Juan Sebas-
tian Chamorro; 
(3) Congress unequivocally condemns the pas-
sage of the Foreign Agents Regulation Law, the 
Special Cybercrimes Law, the Self-Determina-
tion Law, and the Consumer Protection Law by 
the National Assembly of Nicaragua, which rep-
resent clear attempts by the Ortega government 
to curtail the fundamental freedoms and basic 
human rights of the people of Nicaragua; 
(4) Congress recognizes that free, fair, and 
transparent elections predicated on robust re-
form measures and the presence of domestic and 
international observers represent the best oppor-
tunity for the people of Nicaragua to restore de-
mocracy and reach a peaceful solution to the 
political and social crisis in Nicaragua; 
(5) the United States recognizes the right of 
the people of Nicaragua to freely determine their 
own political future as vital to ensuring the sus-
tainable restoration of democracy in their coun-
try; 
(6) the United States should align the use of 
diplomatic engagement and all other foreign 
policy tools, including the use of targeted sanc-
tions, in support of efforts by democratic polit-
ical actors and civil society in Nicaragua to ad-
vance the necessary conditions for free, fair, 
and transparent elections in Nicaragua; 
(7) the United States, in order to maximize the 
effectiveness of efforts described in paragraph 
(6), should— 
(A) coordinate with diplomatic partners, in-
cluding the Government of Canada, the Euro-
pean Union, and partners in Latin America and 
the Caribbean; 
(B) advance diplomatic initiatives in consulta-
tion with the Organization of American States 
and the United Nations; and 
(C) thoroughly investigate the assets and 
holdings of the Nicaraguan Armed Forces in the 
United States and consider appropriate actions 
to hold such forces accountable for gross viola-
tions of human rights; and 
(8) pursuant to section 6(b) of the Nicaragua 
Investment Conditionality Act of 2018, the Presi-
dent should waive the application of restrictions 
under section 4 of that Act and the sanctions 
under section 5 of that Act if the Secretary of 
State certifies that the Government of Nicaragua 
is taking the steps identified in section 6(a) of 
that Act, including taking steps to ‘‘to hold free 
and fair elections overseen by credible domestic 
and international observers’’. 
SEC. 3. REVIEW OF PARTICIPATION OF NICA-
RAGUA IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC- 
CENTRAL AMERICA-UNITED STATES 
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following 
findings: 
(1) On November 27, 2018, the President signed 
Executive Order 13851 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; re-
lating to blocking property of certain persons 
contributing to the situation in Nicaragua), 
which stated that ‘‘the situation in Nicaragua, 
including the violent response by the Govern-
ment of Nicaragua to the protests that began on 
April 18, 2018, and the Ortega regime’s system-
atic dismantling and undermining of democratic 
institutions and the rule of law, its use of indis-
criminate violence and repressive tactics against 
civilians, as well as its corruption leading to the 
destabilization of Nicaragua’s economy, con-
stitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States’’. 
(2) Article 21.2 of the Dominican Republic- 
Central America-United States Free Trade 
Agreement approved by Congress under section 
101(a)(1) of the Dominican Republic-Central 
America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 4011(a)(1)) states, 
‘‘Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed . 
. . to preclude a Party from applying measures 
that it considers necessary for the fulfillment of 
its obligations with respect to the maintenance 
or restoration of international peace or security, 
or the protection of its own essential security in-
terests.’’. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the President should review the 
continued participation of Nicaragua in the Do-
minican 
Republic-Central 
America-United 
States Free Trade Agreement if the Government 
of Nicaragua continues to tighten its authori-
tarian rule in an attempt to subvert democratic 
elections in November 2021 and undermine de-
mocracy and human rights in Nicaragua.

plementing the restrictions described in sub-

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE 
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) 
is a specialized agency of the United Nations, 
charged with coordinating health efforts 
within the United Nations system. The 
World Health Assembly (WHA) is the deci-
sion-making body of the WHO, which con-
venes annually in May to set the policies and 
priorities of the organization. Statehood is 
not a requirement for attendance at the 
WHA, and numerous observers, including 
non-members and non-governmental organi-
zations, attended the most recent virtual 
WHA in May 2020. 
(2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in 
the WHO as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with 
strong support from successive United States 
Administrations, Congress, and like-minded 
WHO Member States, and during a period of 
improved Cross-Strait relations, Taiwan re-
ceived an invitation to attend the WHA as an 
observer under the name ‘‘Chinese Taipei’’. 
Taiwan received the same invitation each 
year until 2016, when following the election 
of President Tsai-Ing Wen of the Democratic 
Progressive Party, Taiwan’s engagement in 
the international community began facing 
increased resistance from the People’s Re-
public of China (PRC). Taiwan’s invitation to 
the 2016 WHA was received late and included 
new language conditioning Taiwan’s partici-
pation on the PRC’s ‘‘one China principle’’. 
The WHO did not invite Taiwan to attend 
the WHA as an observer in 2017, 2018, 2019, or 
2020.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5990 
August 5, 2021 
(3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to 
world health, having provided financial and 
technical assistance to respond to numerous 
global health challenges. Taiwan has in-
vested over $6,000,000,000 in international 
medical and humanitarian aid efforts im-
pacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014, 
Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by do-
nating $1,000,000 and providing 100,000 sets of 
personal protective equipment. Through the 
Global Cooperation and Training Frame-
work, the United States and Taiwan have 
jointly conducted training programs for ex-
perts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and 
Zika. In 2020, after successfully containing 
the spread of the novel coronavirus within 
its borders while upholding democratic prin-
ciples, Taiwan generously donated millions 
of pieces of personal protective equipment 
and COVID–19 tests to countries in need. 
These diseases know no borders, and Tai-
wan’s needless exclusion from global health 
cooperation increases the dangers presented 
by global pandemics. 
(4) Taiwan’s international engagement has 
faced increased resistance from the PRC. 
Taiwan was not invited to the 2016 Assembly 
of the International Civil Aviation Organiza-
tion (ICAO), despite participating as a guest 
at the organization’s prior summit in 2013. 
Taiwan’s requests to participate in the Gen-
eral Assembly of the International Criminal 
Police Organization (INTERPOL) have also 
been rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates 
disrupted a meeting of the Kimberley Proc-
ess on conflict diamonds held in Perth, Aus-
tralia, until delegates from Taiwan were 
asked to leave. Since 2016, the Democratic 
Republic of Sa˜o Tome´ and Prı´ncipe, the Re-
public of Panama, the Dominican Republic, 
Burkina Faso, the Republic of El Salvador, 
the Solomon Islands, and the Republic of 
Kiribati have terminated longstanding diplo-
matic relationships with Taiwan and granted 
diplomatic recognition to the PRC. 
(5) Congress has established a policy of 
support for Taiwan’s participation in inter-
national 
bodies 
that 
address 
shared 
transnational challenges, particularly in the 
WHO. Congress passed H.R. 1794 in the 106th 
Congress, H.R. 428 in the 107th Congress, and 
S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to direct the 
Secretary of State to establish a strategy 
for, and to report annually to Congress on, 
efforts to obtain observer status for Taiwan 
at the WHA. Congress also passed H.R. 1151 
in the 113th Congress, directing the Sec-
retary to report on a strategy to gain ob-
server status for Taiwan at the ICAO Assem-
bly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress, di-
recting the Secretary to report on a strategy 
to gain observer status for Taiwan at the 
INTERPOL Assembly. However, since 2016, 
Taiwan has not received an invitation to at-
tend any of these events as an observer. 
(b) AUGMENTATION OF REPORT CONCERNING 
THE PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (c) of section 1 
of the Act entitled, ‘‘To address the partici-
pation of Taiwan in the World Health Orga-
nization’’ (Public Law 108–235; 22 U.S.C. 290 
note) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new paragraph: 
‘‘(3) An account of the changes and im-
provements the Secretary of State has made 
to the United States plan to endorse and ob-
tain observer status for Taiwan at the World 
Health Assembly, following any annual 
meetings of the World Health Assembly at 
which Taiwan did not obtain observer sta-
tus.’’. 
(2) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendment 
made by paragraph (1) shall take effect and 
apply beginning with the first report re-
quired under subsection (c) of section 1 of the 
Act entitled, ‘‘To address the participation 
of Taiwan in the World Health Organization’’ 
(Public Law 108–235; 22 U.S.C. 290 note) that 
is submitted after the date of the enactment 
of this Act.
