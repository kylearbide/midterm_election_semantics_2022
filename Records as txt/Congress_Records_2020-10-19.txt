Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2020

House of Representatives 
The House was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Tuesday, October 20, 2020, at 9 a.m.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2020 
The Senate met at 4:30 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, who is our hope for the years 
to come, bring us safely to the harbor 
of your choosing. Continue to work for 
the good of those who love You and in-
fuse us with the spirit of Your peace. 
Lord, help our lawmakers to do what 
is fair, remembering your Golden Rule 
which states: ‘‘Do for others what you 
would like them to do for you.’’ 
Lord, you said in Matthew 7:12 that 
this principle is a summary of all that 
is taught in the law and the prophets. 
We praise You for this profound maxim 
to guide our ethical conduct. May it 
provide our lawmakers with wisdom to 
make sound decisions and strength to 
walk in the way of justice and freedom 
for all. 
We pray in Your wonderful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). The President pro tempore. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask to speak for 1 minute in morning 
business, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CENSORSHIP 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Last week, news 
broke about Hunter Biden’s question-
able financial dealings. That informa-
tion, allegedly from Hunter Biden’s 
laptop, appears to show that Vice 
President Biden may have been more 
aware of his son’s financial dealings 
with foreign despots and criminals 
than he admitted to the American peo-
ple. That information was quickly 
censored by big tech companies. 
Just today, DNI Director Ratcliffe 
said that Hunter Biden’s laptop issue is 
not part of a Russian disinformation 
campaign. 
The Steele dossier is fake news, but I 
don’t recall reporters and Big Tech 
censoring the false reporting about 
President Trump and the Steele dos-
sier. Instead, the liberal media did just 
the 
opposite. 
They 
became 
super-
spreaders of false reporting across the 
world. 
What happened last week is election 
interference 
and 
anti-conservative 
bias, and Facebook and Twitter are 
guilty. Democrats and liberals in the 
press can’t have veto authority over in-
formation just because it makes their 
nominee look bad. They can’t have a 
double standard. Vice President Biden 
owes the American people answers. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY 
BARRETT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Last week, the 
Senate Judiciary Committee and the 
entire country heard from one of the 
most impressive nominees for any pub-
lic office in a long time. Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett demonstrated that she 
has the deep legal expertise, dis-
passionate judicial temperament, and 
sheer 
intellectual 
horsepower 
the 
American people deserve to have on the 
Supreme 
Court. 
Her 
nomination 
prompted an outpouring of praise from 
across academia, the legal profession, 
and, importantly, the political spec-
trum. Last week, our committee col-
leagues saw why fellow legal scholars 
called Judge Barrett ‘‘a brilliant and 
conscientious lawyer who will analyze 
and decide cases in good faith’’ and say 
she is ‘‘tailor-made for this job.’’ They 
heard firsthand why her former law 
clerks and students called her ‘‘a 
woman of unassailable integrity’’ and 
‘‘a role model for generations to 
come.’’ 
They heard thoughtful answers that 
explained why the American Bar Asso-
ciation—an institution the Democratic 
leader has called ‘‘the gold standard’’— 
deems Judge Barrett ‘‘well qualified’’ 
to sit on the Supreme Court. They 
heard why the legal professionals be-
hind that rating call her ‘‘a staggering 
academic mind.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6050 
October 19, 2020 
The Chair of the ABA’s Standing 
Committee on the Federal Judiciary 
told the committee directly that ‘‘in 
interviews with individuals in the legal 
profession and community who know 
Judge Barrett, whether for a few years 
or decades, not one person uttered a 
negative word about her character.’’ 
Of course, there is another way you 
can tell that Judge Barrett is so im-
pressive and so qualified. It is the fact 
that the people who precommitted to 
oppose 
her 
nomination 
have 
com-
pletely retreated from arguing the 
merits. Virtually none of the politi-
cians, pundits, or special interests that 
opposed Judge Barrett from the begin-
ning have even tried to lay a finger on 
her qualifications or credentials. 
We have seen inaccurate claims that 
it would be abnormal for the Senate to 
fill this seat. We have seen bizarre, 
barely disguised insinuations about the 
nominee’s religious faith, and now, this 
morning, there was improper press 
scrutiny of her children. We have heard 
Democrats try to take hostage our 
very institutions of government to stop 
this precedent-backed process from 
moving forward, but none of the distor-
tions can even begin to cloud the in-
credible qualifications of the nominee. 
I look forward to the Judiciary Com-
mittee’s vote on Thursday. The full 
Senate will turn to Judge Barrett’s 
nomination as soon as it comes out of 
committee. I will be proud to vote to 
confirm this exceptional jurist. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this week the Senate will vote on more 
coronavirus relief that Congress could 
deliver to American families right now. 
Month after month, Speaker PELOSI 
has held up urgent assistance for work-
ers, 
families, 
schools, 
and 
our 
healthcare system. Month after month, 
she has refused to set aside non- 
COVID-related demands and far-left 
policy riders that she knows are sabo-
taging any shot at a deal. Why? Well, 
because—and 
these 
are 
her 
own 
words—she thinks agreeing to a bipar-
tisan compromise might make the 
Democrats seem like ‘‘a cheap date’’— 
her words. The Speaker said over and 
over again that she does not believe it 
is better for workers to get something 
rather than nothing. 
Thus far, Senate Democrats have 
gone along with it. We could have 
passed hundreds of billions of dollars in 
relief more than a month ago, but our 
Democratic colleagues voted in lock-
step to filibuster relief and kill the 
bill. Unless Democrats got every single 
non-COVID-related wish-list item they 
were after, American families would 
get nothing. Every single Senate Dem-
ocrat voted to filibuster hundreds of 
billions of dollars of noncontroversial 
assistance, except our colleague who is 
running for Vice President. So she 
wasn’t here at all. 
This 
has 
been 
the 
position 
for 
months: all-or-nothing obstruction. It 
has to stop. The Speaker’s Marie An-
toinette act needs to end. Zero dollars 
for working families but a whole lot of 
television time for the Speaker of the 
House is not a good trade for the Amer-
ican people. 
Speaker PELOSI’s supposed leverage 
is not putting food on the table in 
households where one or both parents 
have lost their jobs. Speaker PELOSI’s 
so-called 
leverage 
is 
not 
helping 
schools reopen safely or struggling 
small business to avoid layoffs. The 
Democrats’ talking points are not 
doing a single thing to fund more test-
ing, more tracing, or double down on 
Project Warp Speed so we can produce 
and distribute a vaccine. 
Tomorrow and Wednesday, the Sen-
ate is going to vote. We will see wheth-
er our Democratic colleagues in this 
Chamber agree that families deserve 
nothing rather than something, or 
whether they are ready to let the Sen-
ate make law across the huge areas 
where we do not even disagree. 
Tomorrow, we will have a stand- 
alone vote on creating a second round 
of the historic Paycheck Protection 
Program for the hardest hit small busi-
nesses. The PPP has saved tens of mil-
lions of American jobs and kept main 
streets across America from turning 
into permanent COVID–19 ghost towns. 
The program is as bipartisan as it 
gets. Not only did it pass unanimously 
in the first place, but we also added 
funding and made tweaks several times 
without a single objection in either 
Chamber. 
So tomorrow, Tuesday, every Sen-
ator will cast an up-or-down vote on es-
tablishing a whole second draw of these 
emergency loans for the small busi-
nesses that need it the most—no more 
all or nothing, no more endless pos-
turing, just one clear vote on one clear 
good thing that nobody even says they 
oppose. It would make a huge dif-
ference for workers who may otherwise 
be laid off. 
Then, on Wednesday, the Senate will 
vote again on a larger bill. It will pour 
hundreds of billions of dollars into the 
PPP expansion, plus more Federal un-
employment insurance, more money 
for safe schools, more money for test-
ing, more money for vaccines, and 
many other important priorities. 
Nobody thinks this proposal would 
resolve every problem forever. What it 
does contain is half a trillion dollars of 
good that Congress can do right now 
through programs that Democrats do 
not even say they oppose. American 
families deserve for us to agree where 
we can, make law, and push huge 
amounts of money out the door while 
Washington continues arguing over the 
rest. It is common sense. It is what the 
country needs. I hope our Democratic 
colleagues will finally let it happen. 
Madam President, what is the pend-
ing business?

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
last week, the Republican majority on 
the Senate Judiciary Committee con-
cluded what can only be described as a 
farcical set of hearings for a Supreme 
Court nominee. In the midst of a pan-
demic, when several members of the 
committee majority were exposed to or 
tested positive for the coronavirus or 
themselves were sick with COVID–19 in 
the 
days 
immediately 
beforehand, 
hearings and an in-person markup were 
conducted with virtually no regard for 
the risks. 
No uniform testing protocol was put 
in place to protect all of the people 
who had to be in that room. Why? Be-
cause the Republican majority wanted 
to jam this nomination through before 
the election. 
The chairman of the committee ig-
nored the committee’s quorum rules so 
that he could conduct business without 
the participation of the minority. 
Why? Because the Republican majority 
has decided to ignore the rules, norms, 
and standards—even its own rules, even 
its own standards—to get this nominee 
onto the bench. 
Four short years ago, every member 
of the Committee on the Judiciary said 
that we shouldn’t approve a Supreme 
Court nominee in a Presidential elec-
tion year. Many refused even to meet 
with Obama’s nominee. 
‘‘Use my words against me,’’ Chair-
man GRAHAM said, in case a Supreme 
Court vacancy opened up in the final 
year of his term. LINDSEY GRAHAM, in 
talking about himself, said: ‘‘LINDSEY 
GRAHAM says let’s let the next presi-
dent [decide].’’ 
But now the Republican majority’s 
supposed principle that we shouldn’t 
approve Supreme Court nominees in 
election years has been exposed as a 
farce. It is trying to confirm a Supreme 
Court nominee in the middle of a na-
tional election. The Republican major-
ity is running the most hypocritical, 
most partisan, and least legitimate 
process in the history of Supreme 
Court confirmations. Again, the Repub-
lican majority is running the most 
hypocritical, most partisan, and least 
legitimate process in the history—the 
long history—of Supreme Court nomi-
nations. 
And what of the nominee? She per-
formed as nearly every Trump-nomi-
nated judge has performed when nomi-
nated to the Supreme Court. Essen-
tially, she answered nothing—nothing 
of substance. Throughout the week, the 
Committee on the Judiciary and the 
American people were treated to the 
same practiced evasions that have be-
come a hallmark of these hearings. 
According to Judge Barrett, the judi-
cial standard of ethics that a nominee 
‘‘shouldn’t comment on cases that 
might come before the Court’’ is an ex-
cuse so large that it applies to any 
question she might not want to an-
swer—even questions of basic legal 
fact. It produced an absurd and stun-
ning set of exchanges. 
Judge Barrett would not say whether 
voter intimidation is illegal. It very 
much is. Judge Barrett would not say 
whether Congress is empowered to pro-
tect the right to vote. We certainly 
have that power. Judge Barrett would 
not say if the President of the United 
States can unilaterally change the date 
of an election. He cannot. She wouldn’t 
say a President should commit to the 
peaceful transfer of power, if absentee 
ballots were a proper way to vote, or if 
Medicare and Social Security were con-
stitutional. She wouldn’t even say 
that. 
On the final day of her confirmation 
hearings, Judge Barrett refused to say 
if climate change were real, because 
her answer might be ‘‘politically con-
troversial.’’ Seriously? This nominee 
was unable to confirm the existence of 
climate change? What is next—gravity? 
Is the Earth round? To be fair, the Flat 
Earth Society might find that opinion 
politically controversial. 
These aren’t matters of opinion. 
These are matters of law and matters 
of fact. She is a sitting judge, and if 
the Republican majority gets its way, 
she will be a Justice on the highest 
Court in the country, but, apparently, 
the American people do not deserve to 
hear anything about her views. 
The principal thing we learned about 
Judge Barrett in her hearings was she 
believes she doesn’t have to answer any 
question that might upset President 
Trump, but, of course, we do know that 
Judge Barrett has a certain interpreta-
tion of our laws and the Constitution— 
one that she wants to hide from the 
American people because it is so ad-
verse to what they believe. 
President Trump swore that he would 
only nominate Justices to the Supreme 
Court who would ‘‘terminate’’ the Af-
fordable Care Act. Judge Barrett her-
self harshly criticized Justice Roberts’ 
decision to uphold the law. Senator 
HAWLEY said, after his meeting with 
Judge Barrett, he was satisfied she be-
lieves Roe v. Wade was not correctly 
decided. At one moment in the hear-
ings last week, Judge Barrett admitted 
she considered Brown v. Board a super-
precedent—outside the realm of legal 
challenge—but that Roe v. Wade was 
not. 
So, despite what the American people 
heard in the hearings last week, Judge 
Barrett does have opinions; she does 
hold views. She has a track record of 
criticizing the decisions that have 
upheld our healthcare law. She has be-
longed to organizations and signed her 
name to advertisements that have 
called for an end—an end—to a wom-
an’s right to choose. Her judicial opin-
ions express an extreme and rather bi-
zarre view of the Second Amendment. 
She believes that the government lacks 
the power to forbid felons from owning 
guns—a view far to the right of even 
Justice Scalia. 
If Judge Barrett is confirmed, those 
views will matter a great deal to Amer-
icans whose fundamental rights are on 
the line at the Supreme Court—their 
right 
to 
affordable 
healthcare, 
to 
marry whom they love, to join a union, 
to make private medical decisions with 
their doctors and without government 
interference, to vote without first hav-
ing to jump through 15 hoops and do 20 
somersaults. 
The American people should make no 
mistake: If Judge Barrett becomes Jus-
tice Barrett, every single one of their 
fundamental rights would be at risk. 
Her views are so far away from what 
the average American believes and 
would do so much damage to the funda-
mental structure and comity of this 
country that I just hope and pray two 
Republicans will see the light and real-
ize that we should not nominate any 
nominee before the election, which is 2 
weeks and 1 day away. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, now, of course, in-
stead of ramming through a Supreme 
Court nominee in the most hypo-
critical of circumstances, the Repub-
lican majority should be working with 
the Democrats on a real comprehensive 
COVID relief bill. 
Over the past few weeks, COVID–19 
cases, 
unfortunately, 
have 
swelled 
across the country. The United States 
reported 69,000 new cases last Friday, 
with 10 States reporting their highest 
single-day totals ever. Poverty is be-
ginning to increase. Unemployment re-
mains alarmingly high. More than 6 
million Americans missed their rent or 
mortgage payments in September. 
What we need right now is an emer-
gency relief package with enough re-
sources to beat back this enormous cri-
sis. Yet, Leader MCCONNELL, this week, 
will, once again, force a vote on a par-
tisan, emaciated COVID bill—so defi-
cient and laden with poison pills that 
it is obvious he designed it to fail. In 
the immortal words of Yogi Berra: 
‘‘It’s deja vu all over again.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6052 
October 19, 2020 
Leader MCCONNELL
tried the same 
stunt last month. It failed. Instead of 
trying to work with the Democrats or 
increase the size of the relief package 
to 
meet 
the 
needs—the 
desperate 
needs—of the American people, Leader 
MCCONNELL
is back with the same 
sorry excuse for a bill. It fails to in-
clude robust unemployment insurance, 
enough funding for schools and univer-
sities, or funding for rental, housing, or 
nutrition assistance. It does nothing 
for the census or our elections and 
abandons State, local, and Tribal gov-
ernments on the brink of catastrophe. 
It doesn’t include recent bipartisan leg-
islation that helps independent music 
and 
theater 
venues—the 
Save 
our 
Stages Act—or bipartisan legislation 
to help our ailing restaurants. It is to-
tally inadequate when it comes to 
funding for testing and tracing, espe-
cially given the new spike in cases and 
especially given the fact that a second 
wave may be upon us. I hope and pray 
it isn’t. It, once again, includes the poi-
son pill of all poison pills—a sweeping 
corporate 
immunity 
provision 
that 
would shield corporations from ac-
countability if they put their workers 
in harm’s way. 
Let me be clear: The Republican pro-
posal was unacceptable a month ago, 
and it remains unacceptable now, even 
more so in that the crisis has gotten 
even worse. 
Remember, Leader MCCONNELL
has 
been clear that as many as 20 Repub-
lican Senators don’t want to provide 
any more relief to the American peo-
ple. According to press reports, one 
Senator said: ‘‘Not another dime.’’ Re-
publican Senators gave their counter-
parts in the White House an earful for 
even considering a bigger package of 
aid. So this is not a serious attempt at 
pandemic relief. It seems to be another 
attempt at giving the Republicans po-
litical cover before the election. 
Speaker PELOSI continues to nego-
tiate with Secretary Mnuchin and the 
White House in the hopes of finding a 
deal that would actually meet the 
needs of the American people. Instead 
of repeating the same failed partisan 
gambit, Leader MCCONNELL should be 
working with the Democrats and the 
administration on a proposal that ac-
tually has a chance of making it 
through both Houses of Congress. The 
longer he waits, the greater the cost to 
the American people. 
Now, before I yield the floor, I want 
to be clear about one thing. Because 
our Republican colleagues have made 
such a mockery of the Supreme Court 
confirmation process, we are not going 
to have business as usual here in the 
Senate. Tonight, I will move to bring 
up a vote under the Congressional Re-
view Act and force action on a resolu-
tion to undo the Trump administra-
tion’s gutting of the Community Rein-
vestment Act. This is an important 
fight in its own right. We should be 
standing up for critical civil rights 
laws, like the Community Reinvest-
ment Act—laws that help deliver op-
portunity and resources to commu-
nities of color. 
The Trump administration’s rewrite 
of the rule not only undermines core 
elements of the CRA, but it replaces 
past practices with complicated re-
quirements that would lead to less 
lending in communities that need it 
most. I have fought too hard through-
out my career to lift up the protections 
of the CRA to stand idly by as the 
Trump administration tries to tear 
them down. 
The window to challenge this rule 
under the Congressional Review Act 
closes today, so I will move to consider 
the resolution this evening. Normally, 
we would work these votes out with the 
majority, but its abuse of the Supreme 
Court process means we will not have 
business as usual—not now, not until 
the Republicans stop their mad dash to 
confirm a Supreme Court Justice mere 
days before a Presidential election.

approval under chapter 8 of title 5, United 
States Code, of the rule submitted by the Of-
fice of the Comptroller of the Currency relat-
ing to ‘‘Community Reinvestment Act Regu-
lations’’. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the vote 
on the motion to proceed to H.J. Res. 
90 occur at 5:45 p.m. today, with the 
time equally divided between the two 
leaders or their designees. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Tennessee 
is recognized. 
CENSORSHIP AND SOCIAL MEDIA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it 
doesn’t take a genius to figure out that 
there is a small but very loud sector of 
the American people who are willing to 
condition their tolerance for diverging 
viewpoints on how they feel, they 
themselves feel about what is being 
said, worshipped, or reported. And as 
scary and as frightening as that atti-
tude is to many of us, it is increasingly 
reflected in the very companies that 
have the most influence over how we 
access and consume information. 
Last week, we saw two of these com-
panies go to extremes to get in line 
with radicals who are trying to block, 
censor, and intimidate their way into 
power. We all know the companies and 
the controversy I am talking about. 
Twitter and Facebook censored the 
spread of a New York Post article con-
taining allegations that could poten-
tially affect the outcome of the upcom-
ing election. 
That is all I am going to say about 
the article itself because, frankly, the 
content bears no importance on how 
anyone should react to what happened 
after it was posted. Someone working 
for a private company—someone who is 
a content reviewer or content moder-
ator—someone working for a private 
company made a unilateral decision to 
stop Americans from reading the arti-
cle. They didn’t like it. They said: I 
have the power to stop it, and because 
I have that power, I am going to stop 
it. 
Now that is precisely what happened, 
and I will tell you, colleagues, it is not 
just that they blocked the link and the 
text of the article, it is that at least in 
Twitter’s case, they suspended the 
Trump campaign’s account; they sus-
pended the New York Post account; 
they locked the White House Press Sec-
retary’s account; and they suppressed 
information posted by the House Judi-
ciary Committee Republicans. They 
couldn’t even provide a plausible expla-
nation for why they did this. Think 
about that. 
They made themselves the arbiters of 
free speech, and they, in their almighty 
position, decided they were going to de-
termine what you could hear, when you 
could hear it, and how you could hear 
it. They decided. 
The common element, of course, in 
all of this action that took place was 
the New York Post story. Was it infor-
mation or hacked information or just 
inconvenient 
information? 
No 
one 
seems to want to answer that question. 
Why do they not want to answer that 
question? It is because they didn’t like 
the information. It did not suit their 
narrative, but the way things stand, 
they didn’t have to, because there is no 
real accountability and now their weak 
explanations have been co-opted into 
arguments made by activists, rival 
media organizations, and even journal-
ists who were insisting that the infor-
mation is harmful and must be strick-
en from the record. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator 
yield? I have brought an announcement 
to the floor that will take a brief 
minute. I don’t mean to interrupt. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I would be happy 
to yield to the Democratic leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6053 
October 19, 2020 
Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator 
from Tennessee. 
NOTICE OF INTENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. I just want to put the 
Members on notice. Later this evening, 
I will make a motion to adjourn the 
Senate until after the November elec-
tion. 
The Republican majority refused to 
consider the Supreme Court nominee of 
a duly elected Democratic President 
because it was 8 months before the 
election. Now they are trying to ram 
through a Justice in mere days—days— 
before an election. It is the most 
rushed, the most partisan, the least le-
gitimate nomination process in Su-
preme Court history, and it should not 
proceed. 
So I want the Members to know that 
I will move to adjourn until after the 
election with the ability to come back 
into session if there is a bipartisan 
agreement on a COVID relief package. 
I thank the Senator for letting me 
put Members on notice that we will do 
this later this evening. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator may proceed. 
CENSORSHIP AND SOCIAL MEDIA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Thank you very 
much, Mr. President. I have to tell you, 
listening to the Democratic leader 
there, this is one of the things that so-
cial media has taken off on. 
They lost. They lost the 2016 Presi-
dential election, and they have never 
accepted the results. Never. It doesn’t 
fit their narrative. So what do they do? 
Look at this. Let’s just not even work. 
Let’s just adjourn. Let’s not do our 
constitutional duty. 
I tell you what, you can’t make this 
stuff up. You really can’t. Cognitive 
dissonance of this moment in history 
has overwhelmed the discourse. 
It is important to make it abun-
dantly clear that the outrage—the ab-
solute outrage from the American peo-
ple over this incident with social media 
has everything to do with their very 
fluid and subjective standards that 
these companies use to control the flow 
of information, and over the last few 
years, they have gotten worse about it. 
And you know what? They do it until 
we slap their hands and then pull them 
back in, and we say: You can’t do this. 
Now, in the case that we are dis-
cussing that happened last week, it 
looks suspiciously like they applied a 
brandnew set of standards because 
someone got spooked at the prospect of 
losing momentum on a political nar-
rative. 
They are all working together on 
this. So let’s go home; let’s not work; 
let’s not do our job; let’s bury a story 
on social media. Why? Their gal didn’t 
win in 2016, and Donald Trump did be-
cause the American people said: We are 
with him, not her. 
Now, here in Washington we can 
argue all over election-year politics, 
but in Tennessee, the people are seeing 
this for what it is, and they are not 
talking about politics. They think this 
is pretty terrifying. They are seeing a 
news platform censor the news, and 
they are seeing extremely powerful 
people cheer it on. To them and to me, 
that is frightening. 
They are looking to us to get into 
one of those policy debates my col-
leagues across the aisle were so eager 
to jump into just last week during 
Judge Barrett’s confirmation hearing. 
Fortunately, for them, we have got a 
head start on that discussion. Big Tech 
has spent the last several years build-
ing up a body of evidence against its 
own intentions, and if we don’t address 
their growing influence, we will lose 
our ability to create responsive policy. 
I have already come to the floor sev-
eral times to speak on various ways we 
are doing this—through legislation, 
antitrust 
investigations, 
and 
some 
good old-fashioned committee hear-
ings. Congress doing its job, precisely 
why we ought not to adjourn, precisely 
why we should stay here and do our 
work. 
On October 28, the Commerce Com-
mittee will host a few familiar faces 
for a hearing where we will analyze the 
effect that the liability shield found in 
section 230 of the Communications De-
cency Act has on Big Tech’s behavior. 
Over the course of the hearing, we will 
speak with Jack Dorsey of Twitter, 
Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and 
Sundar Pichai of Google about their 
approach to using the section 230 
shield. 
We will also examine various legisla-
tive proposals to modernize section 230, 
including one of my own that would re-
solve some ambiguities regarding what 
sorts of content moderation policies 
are shielded from liability and which 
ones aren’t protected. We are going to 
talk 
about 
the 
unintended 
con-
sequences that stem from these poli-
cies. We are going to talk about their 
platforms’ interaction with activists 
and with the media. 
I think we will probably get around 
to talking about it, whether they like 
it or not, because we have the bipar-
tisan and unanimously authorized sub-
poenas in hand to do it, and those sub-
poenas are good through the end of this 
Congress. 
Hopefully, by going straight to the 
top, we will gain a better under-
standing of why these companies can’t 
seem to regulate themselves, why they 
can’t seem to stop themselves from 
having a complete meltdown every sin-
gle time we turn up the heat and talk 
about these issues of privacy, talk 
about 
censorship, 
talk 
about 
prioritization, talk about preferencing, 
talk about holding them accountable 
for the spectrum they use to put out 
their message and the activity that 
they are taking now to censor the free 
speech of the American public. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am glad 
to see a Member of the majority saying 
that MITCH MCCONNELL ought to have 
us around here doing some work. I ap-
preciate the Senator from Tennessee 
saying that. 
Senator MCCONNELL said there was 
no urgency to help unemployed work-
ers. Six hundred thousand unemployed 
workers in my State in August lost 
their $600 a week. What are they to do? 
Foreclosures are up. There are no 
dollars for public education so schools 
can open safely. 
I appreciate the Senator from Ten-
nessee. Maybe she will talk to Senator 
MCCONNELL and ask him to do his job 
so we can do our job. 
H.J. RES. 90 
Mr. President, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.J. Res. 90, the joint resolution 
of disapproval of the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency’s Commu-
nity Reinvestment Act rule. 
We know who gets hit the hardest by 
this pandemic and economic crisis. It is 
not Wall Street. It is not CEOs. It is 
not U.S. Senators. It is low-income 
workers. It is essential workers. It is 
workers who go to work every day and 
get exposed to this virus and then come 
home, anxious about potentially in-
fecting their family. It is the middle 
class. It is communities of color. Those 
are the people getting hit the hardest. 
It is the same story we see over and 
over and over. Corporate lobbyists and 
their allies in Washington do whatever 
it takes—whatever it takes to make 
sure that Wall Street recovers, and 
then they say: Oh, no, we can’t afford 
to—we can’t—the budget, the deficit. 
We can give a tax cut to rich people, 
explode the deficit, but we can’t do 
anything for regular people, for mid-
dle-class people, and for low-income 
people. We just can’t afford to help 
anyone else. 
The stock market is back up, so 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
and 
President 
Trump seem to think that everything 
is just fine, thank you, in our country. 
Meanwhile, families don’t know how to 
feed their children and how to make 
rent. They don’t know about family 
businesses closing their doors and 
schools can’t open for in-person learn-
ing. But, oh, yeah, the stock market is 
up, so Leader MCCONNELL and Presi-
dent Trump seem to think everything 
is fine. 
Black-owned businesses have closed 
down at twice the rate—including in 
the State of Arkansas—closed at twice 
the rate of White-owned businesses 
during 
this 
pandemic. 
Black 
and 
Latino renters are more likely to be 
behind on their rent or mortgage. But 
the stock market is up, so Leader 
MCCONNELL and President Trump seem 
to think that everything is just fine. 
Low-wage workers are more likely to 
remain out of work. There are 600,000 
people in my State who can’t find jobs. 
They have lost their unemployment in-
surance. But the stock market is up, so 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
and 
President 
Trump seem to think that everything 
is fine. 
Low-wage workers are more likely to 
remain out of work and more likely to 
be struggling to pay for food. We

should—we should—but we are not be-
cause Leader MCCONNELL is taking care 
of his contributors, he is taking care of 
the big-money people, and he is taking 
care of Wall Street. The stock market 
is up—I know I have said that a few 
times—but that is what matters to far 
too many people around here, and to 
the President of the United States, 
that is what matters. We should be 
rolling up our sleeves to invest in 
neighborhoods and the small businesses 
that sustain them. Instead, we have 
had another Trump appointee working 
to actually make it harder to invest in 
these communities at a time when they 
need support the most. 
For decades, redlining and govern-
ment bank sanctions—you know how 
they started. It was the Black codes 
after reconstruction; then it was Jim 
Crow; then it was redlining; and now it 
is locking in discrimination by Trump 
nominees who have had another Trump 
appointee working to make it harder to 
invest. 
For 
decades, 
redlining 
and 
government- and bank-sanctioned dis-
crimination left parts of this country— 
often Black and Brown communities, 
often rural areas in Southeast Ohio and 
Arkansas—with virtually no invest-
ment from banks. All kinds of people 
had dreams to start businesses, to 
build houses, to grow and support their 
communities, but they couldn’t get the 
loans to do it. Even after Congress out-
lawed housing and lending discrimina-
tion based on race, whole communities 
struggled to get the loans they needed. 
Banks were happy to take Black and 
Brown and low-income people’s depos-
its, and then they would lend their 
money to wealthy investors and com-
panies outside of the community. Long 
after redlining and long after legal seg-
regation officially ended, people living 
in largely Black and Brown neighbor-
hoods weren’t able to get mortgages to 
buy a home because the bank just 
wasn’t making loans in those parts of 
town. 
Small farms and small businesses 
couldn’t get the loans they needed to 
grow. That is why we passed the Com-
munity Reinvestment Act, the CRA, to 
make it clear that banks have a re-
sponsibility to serve all of the places 
where they do business, including low- 
and moderate-income areas. As I said, 
they would take the deposits and then 
take the money and lend it out to 
wealthy investors. 
The CRA is one of the foundational 
civil rights laws passed to address dec-
ades of explicit disinvestment and 
begin to undo the legacy of redlining. 
For 40 years, our government and 
banks alike have recognized in the-
ory—in theory—that banking shouldn’t 
just be about serving the people with 
six-figure salaries and big mortgages. 
It is about helping a family farm take 
out a loan. It is about helping a bus-
driver buy their first home or a brother 
and sister open a corner store in a 
neighborhood where there is nowhere 
to buy fresh groceries. It is about lis-
tening to what the communities need 
and making it happen, like helping to 
finance a new affordable housing devel-
opment or offering small loans so that 
people don’t have to turn to payday 
lenders. It is about investing in neigh-
borhoods and borrowers who are locked 
out of the financial system based on 
who they were and where they were 
born. 
The three entities that oversee our 
banking system—the Comptroller of 
the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the 
FDIC—acted together over those 40 
years so that there was one CRA for all 
banks to follow and one set of expecta-
tions about serving customers in com-
munities. 
But, in May, the Trump OCC threw 
out 40 years of progress—just threw it 
out the window. But, you know, the 
stock market is up, so Leader MCCON-
NELL
and President Trump seem to 
think everything is just fine. In the 
middle of a pandemic disproportion-
ately—we have established, and even 
Senator MCCONNELL understands, this 
pandemic 
disproportionately 
harms 
Black and Brown communities in Ken-
tucky, Arkansas, New Jersey, Dela-
ware, Ohio, and all over this country, 
but Trump’s OCC unilaterally rewrote 
the 
CRA—unilaterally. 
The 
other 
Trump nominees didn’t even go that 
far. 
Just 6 weeks before the rule was fi-
nalized, civil rights leaders, commu-
nity development organizations, State 
and local officials, Senator MENENDEZ 
on the Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs Budget Committee, and I and 
others submitted over 7,500 comments 
on the OCC’s and FDIC’s proposed re-
write of the CRA. The vast majority of 
commenters opposed the agency’s pro-
posal. A coalition of civil rights lead-
ers, the NAACP, the National Fair 
Housing Alliance, and UnidosUS said 
the 
proposed 
rule 
invited—their 
words—‘‘a return to discrimination 
against communities of color and low- 
and moderate-income neighborhoods.’’ 
Remember how this worked. It was 
the Black codes; then it was Jim Crow; 
then it was redlining. Now it is locking 
in these discriminatory rules, and we 
said no to that. But, unfortunately, the 
Trump administration says yes to that. 
But 22 State attorneys general wrote 
that the proposal was ‘‘contrary to the 
[Community Reinvestment Act’s] pur-
pose and text, will harm communities 
in the States, and should be with-
drawn.’’ 
Across my home State of Ohio, cities 
such as Akron, Toledo, Dayton, Cin-
cinnati, Mansfield, Lima, and many 
others wrote and passed resolutions op-
posing this plan. Some in govern-
ment—those not directly connected to 
the Trump administration—listened to 
the people we serve. The FDIC heard 
the feedback. FDIC saw the financial 
pain of the pandemic, and they de-
clined to move forward. The Federal 
Reserve also said no, but the OCC 
plowed ahead. It ignored the thousands 
of civil rights groups and local non-
profits and banks, all of whom told 
them their plan just wouldn’t work for 
low- 
and 
moderate-income 
commu-
nities. Instead, the agency said: We 
know best. 
They think these Trump appointees 
in Washington know better than may-
ors and city council members and local 
advocates and small businesses in Ohio 
and around the country. 
The day after they announced they 
were ignoring the rest of the country 
and plowing ahead, Comptroller of the 
Currency Otting announced he would 
resign. Imagine that. First he inflicts 
this on us, and then he walks away, 
probably for a better paying job down 
the road. 
Since the rule was finalized, the Fed-
eral Reserve has set out on a path for 
all three regulators to work together 
to create a CRA rule that will increase 
the focus on lending and investments 
and services in low- and moderate-in-
come communities and to small busi-
nesses and farms. That is what CRA is 
there for. That used to be bipartisan. 
That used to be the consensus around 
here. We should be investing in these 
communities that have been systemati-
cally excluded from sharing in our 
country’s 
prosperity. 
That 
means 
strengthening the CRA. It means lis-
tening to communities when they tell 
us what they need. But the OCC’s rule 
does the opposite. They even acknowl-
edge there was widespread opposition 
to this rule, particularly from the com-
munities the CRA was meant to serve. 
It should be easy for my Republican 
colleagues to join us in voting to re-
voke the OCC’s rule and to stand up for 
the underserved in low- and moderate- 
income communities, rural commu-
nities, and communities of color whom 
CRA was meant to serve. 
I would just ask our Republican col-
leagues to join with what the FDIC 
wants to do—the Trump appointees 
there. Join with the Federal Reserve— 
Jay Powell, Chair of the Federal Re-
serve, Trump appointee. It is what the 
Senate should be doing—working to get 
our country through the worst crisis 
we have seen in our lifetime and in-
vesting in the communities getting hit 
the hardest. 
Instead, Leader MCCONNELL is using 
the final days before an election to jam 
through another special interest judge 
who will carry out the corporate agen-
da that the voters keep rejecting. The 
Senate needs to get back to focusing on 
the people we are here to serve and to 
repeal the OCC’s misguided rule to gut 
the Community Reinvestment Act. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
resolution so that we can get back to 
the task of strengthening the CRA. The 
stock market being up—as important 
as that is to Leader MCCONNELL and 
President Trump in their belief that 
everything is fine because the stock 
market is up, there is way more to 
measure our economy than that. Sup-
port our resolution; strengthen the 
CRA; and help our communities across 
the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6055 
October 19, 2020 
Before yielding the floor, I ask unani-
mous consent that the letters from the 
National Urban League, the Center for 
Responsible Lending, and 45 civil rights 
organizations, 
consumer 
advocates, 
and unions in support of H.J. Res. 90 
and opposing OCC’s CRA rule be print-
ed in the RECORD. Along with these let-
ters that I have requested to be print-
ed, I would also like to refer to a coali-
tion letter supporting the resolution 
which can be found at: https://ncrc.org/ 
wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2020/10/ 
FINAL-H.J.-Res-90-SignOn-Letter.pdf. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE, 
October 19, 2020. 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATORS: On behalf of the National 
Urban League and our 90 affiliates across 36 
states and the District of Columbia, I write 
to express strong support for H.J. Resolution 
90 (H.J. Res. 90), a Congressional Review Act 
resolution intended to reverse the Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) 
harmful and woefully misguided changes to 
the implementation of the Community Rein-
vestment Act of 1977 (CRA). 
The framework represented by OCC’s final 
CRA rule represents a serious shift from the 
CRA’s original intent of addressing the his-
tory of redlining, disinvestment, and the 
market failures that continue to leave com-
munities of color in America underserved. 
Notably, it is illustrative that two of the 
three federal agencies charged with enforc-
ing the CRA—the Federal Reserve (the Fed) 
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion (FDIC)—did not join the OCC in final-
izing 
this 
controversial 
rule. 
Moreover, 
under the leadership of Chair Jerome Powell 
and Governor Lael Brainard, the Fed has 
now proposed a different approach to mod-
ernizing the CRA that better aligns with the 
original intent of this crucial civil rights 
law. 
If fully enacted, the OCC’s final rule would 
effectively give banks under the agency’s ju-
risdiction more credit for performing less 
CRA activity, resulting in significantly 
fewer lending opportunities and bank serv-
ices for the many low- and middle-income 
(LMI) families nationwide who most need 
the vital access to the sustainable lending 
and homeownership opportunities made pos-
sible by the CRA. Additionally, the OCC’s 
final rule favors investments that are al-
ready well-served by current market trends 
and for which the CRA was never intended. 
The CRA was designed to combat genera-
tions of discrimination and redlining by re-
quiring banks to better meet the lending 
needs of the surrounding communities in 
which they are chartered to serve, including 
underserved areas. This important law was 
enacted in large part because communities 
of color continued to face barriers accessing 
credit despite the passage of federal fair 
lending laws, including the Fair Housing 
Act, the Equal Opportunity Act, and the 
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 
In light of the very serious concerns about 
the OCC’s finalized changes to the implemen-
tation of the CRA, the National Urban 
League urges Senators to vote in favor of 
H.J. Res. 90 when it comes to the Senate 
floor for consideration. Should you have any 
questions, please feel free to contact Julius 
Niyonsaba at the National Urban League. 
Sincerely, 
MARC H. MORIAL, 
President & CEO, National Urban League. 
CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING 
October 19, 2020. 
U.S. SENATE, 
U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR: The Center for Responsible 
Lending writes to express our strong support 
for H.J. Res. 90, a Congressional Review Act 
resolution of disapproval that will invalidate 
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
(OCC) final rule on the Community Reinvest-
ment Act. 
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 
(CRA) was one in a series of landmark civil 
rights legislation and is a critical tool to 
help our nation work toward overcoming the 
legacy of redlining. Today’s racial wealth 
gap and lending disparities are in large part 
the result of decades of government policies 
and practices that enabled the redlining of 
communities of color for most of the 20th 
century. In the post-Depression era, federal 
policies that created housing opportunities 
for returning veterans and their families ex-
plicitly excluded people of color from the 
benefits of government-supported housing 
programs. Among these programs were pub-
lic housing, the Home Owners’ Loan Corpora-
tion 
(HOLC), 
and 
mortgage 
insurance 
through the Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA). Not only did this redlining segregate 
residential neighborhoods across the United 
States, but it granted whites the ability to 
build wealth through homeownership while 
denying equal opportunities for families of 
color to build similar home equity over the 
same period. The inequities that result from 
these discriminatory programs are part of 
the injustices that today’s people led pro-
tests are demanding to be addressed. 
The CRA imposes continuing and affirma-
tive obligations on banks to help meet the 
credit needs of the local communities in 
which they are chartered and continues to be 
an important tool for fostering access to 
credit for these communities today. The law 
has urged banks to more actively lend in 
LMI areas; it has also played a key role in 
ensuring bank participation in community 
revitalization efforts across the country. 
Despite the importance of CRA and the 
community investment it has spurred, CRA 
rules must be strengthened. The CRA as ap-
plied has not done nearly enough to revi-
talize previously redlined areas and has not 
made a substantial dent in the lagging home-
ownership rate for people of color. The white 
homeownership rate is 73% while the rate is 
44% and 48% for Black and Latino borrowers 
respectively. Additionally, bank lending in 
LMI communities and communities of color 
has declined dramatically since the Great 
Recession. And existing disparities will be 
further perpetuated in the face of the 
COVID–19 global public health and economic 
crisis. 
Unfortunately, the OCC decided to act uni-
laterally—without the Federal Reserve and 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—to 
issue a structurally flawed final rule that 
weakens the CRA and will harm low- and 
moderate-communities and communities of 
color. Rather than postpone rulemaking to 
focus on the devastating economic crisis 
caused by the COVID–19 health pandemic, 
the OCC issued the rule a mere six weeks 
after the closing of the comment period on 
its proposed rule despite broad requests for 
delay from community groups, civil rights 
and consumer organizations, and industry. 
The OCC acknowledged in the preamble to 
the final rule that most of the comments dis-
agreed with the proposal’s approach. Yet, the 
OCC decided to side with the minority of 
comments in support of the proposed rule. 
The OCC’s rule will harm the communities 
most adversely affected by the current crisis, 
including many families that were hardest 
hit by the Great Recession and have yet to 
recover. 
The final rule imposes an overly simplistic 
evaluation measure that fails to ensure that 
local banking needs are met, and sanctions 
bank redlining. The rule overvalues the dol-
lar amount of CRA activities in comparison 
to the quality of such activities and allows 
banks to earn more credit for easier and 
larger investments in communities from 
which they can get the highest return. In-
deed, the rule permits banks to ignore 20% of 
their assessment areas and still pass, result-
ing in unchecked neighborhood disinvest-
ment and redlining. The rule also disincen-
tives investment in LMI neighborhoods and 
communities of color. It incentivizes activi-
ties and investments that do not ‘‘pri-
marily’’ benefit LMI communities, such as 
large-scale 
infrastructure 
projects. 
Esti-
mating such projects’ impact on LMI neigh-
borhoods is difficult and thus will likely di-
vest funds away from smaller scale, yet 
impactful community development activi-
ties. Furthermore, the rule reduces the im-
portance of retail lending and retail services, 
resulting in less lending and investments in 
communities that are already credit starved. 
The rule is opposite to the CRA’s statutory 
mission and will cause deep harm to commu-
nities. 
We urge support for H.J. Res. 90 to reverse 
the OCC’s regulatory attack on the Commu-
nity Reinvestment Act. Thank you for your 
consideration. 
Sincerely, 
CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING. 
NATIONAL COMMUNITY 
REINVESTMENT COALITION, 
October 19, 2020. 
DEAR SENATOR: We, the undersigned orga-
nizations, write to express our strong sup-
port for H.J. Res. 90, a Congressional Review 
Act resolution of disapproval that will nul-
lify a rulemaking by the Office of the Comp-
troller of the Currency (OCC) that, if allowed 
to stand, would drastically undermine one of 
our nation’s most important civil rights 
laws, the Community Reinvestment Act of 
1977 (the CRA). 
Enacted in 1977, the Community Reinvest-
ment Act (CRA) has been vital in fighting 
redlining, a practice that systematically— 
and for decades, as a matter of federal pol-
icy—shut neighborhoods of color and lower- 
income communities out from home loans 
and other essential financial services. The 
CRA requires banks to undertake reasonable 
efforts to lend to and invest in all of the 
neighborhoods in areas where they do busi-
ness. The law has helped to spur increased 
investments in formerly-redlined commu-
nities. It did not, however, prevent non-bank 
lenders (who are not subject to the CRA) 
from flooding communities of color with 
toxic subprime mortgages in the years before 
the 2008 crisis; and research shows that ra-
cial disparities in lending—which cannot be 
explained away by differences in credit 
scores—persist to this day. 
It is clear that the CRA needs to be mod-
ernized and strengthened in order to fulfill 
its original purpose. But in January, the 
OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor-
poration (FDIC) published a Notice of Pro-
posed Rulemaking (NPRM) that would in-
stead significantly weaken the CRA. The 
agencies proposed new overly simplistic 
metrics system that would make it far easier 
for banks to pass their CRA exams by mak-
ing large investments in communities where 
they can reap the largest rewards, rather 
than carefully-targeted, smaller investments 
in underserved consumers and neighbor-
hoods. 
Even before the NPRM was published, a 
wide range of stakeholders weighed in with

October 19, 2020 
both the OCC and FDIC to raise concerns and 
to ask for more data justifying the changes. 
Those concerns were not addressed, and the 
data was never released. By the time the 
NPRM was published, the United States and 
the world were just beginning to learn about 
the growing threat posed by a dangerous new 
respiratory virus. In the coming weeks, it be-
came clear that the virus had not been con-
tained, and it spread rapidly to multiple 
countries including the United States. As 
stakeholders and the public began devoting 
more and more resources and attention to 
the health, social, and economic fallout of 
the growing pandemic, and many urged the 
OCC and FDIC to temporarily suspend rule-
making not related to COVID–19, the agen-
cies continued plowing ahead, only agreeing 
to a one-month extension for comments. 
In the days before the deadline for com-
ments on the rule, it had become clear that 
COVID–19 was proving fatal to communities 
of color—the very communities the CRA was 
intended to help—at a rate several times 
higher than the population at large; the U.S. 
Surgeon General warned the public to pre-
pare for ‘‘our 9/11 moment,’’ and models pre-
dicted 100,000 or more deaths in the United 
States alone. Only 41 days after the com-
ment period ended, and even though only a 
minority of commenters voiced support for 
the new framework, the OCC rushed through 
a final rule that left it largely intact. The 
FDIC, to its credit, declined to finalize its 
version of the rule at this time. 
In the months since the OCC finalized its 
rule, our nation has been facing a long-over-
due reckoning with our troubled legacy of 
racial and ethnic discrimination. While 
much of the conversation has rightly been 
focused on police brutality and the impact of 
over-policing in communities of color, this 
conversation is inexorably tied to the lasting 
economic, social, and legal legacy of red-
lining and other forms of racial discrimina-
tion. 
We will not succeed in addressing issues 
surrounding law enforcement in commu-
nities of color without also addressing dec-
ades of underinvestment in housing, employ-
ment, education, health care, transpor-
tation, and other factors that, to this day, 
have contributed to the longstanding dis-
parities that are once again coming to light. 
Now is certainly not the time to weaken the 
most important civil rights laws we have at 
our disposal to correct those disparities. 
As such, we urge Congress to support H.J. 
Res. 90, to overturn the OCC’s regulatory at-
tack on the Community Reinvestment Act.

Mr. BROWN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to 
join my colleagues from Ohio and from 
New Jersey in saying that we should 
not allow this OCC rule, gutting the 
core elements of the CRA, to move for-
ward. The Community Reinvestment 
Act is a landmark civil rights and anti- 
redlining law created to improve the 
welfare of low- and moderate-income 
Americans all over our Nation and to 
assess banks lending to, investing in, 
and serving of the communities in 
which they do business. 
The Community Reinvestment Act 
works. Since its enactment in 1977, it 
has resulted in trillions of dollars in-
vested in low- and moderate-income 
communities. It promotes fair treat-
ment and equal access to credit and 
capital for Black and Brown commu-
nities, for underserved populations, and 
it is essential to the economic health 
of our country. It is a successful incen-
tive for banks to provide mortgage 
lending and financial services to neigh-
borhoods of color and low- and mod-
erate-income communities. 
There is a long legacy of racial dis-
crimination in our Nation in financial 
services, and the Community Reinvest-
ment Act has been a vital tool in help-
ing to fight that cruel legacy. In Dela-
ware, I have seen the benefits of the 
CRA firsthand. I have seen investments 
in affordable housing, homeownership 
opportunities, and economic and small 
business development as a result. 
Discover 
Bank, 
for 
example, 
partnered with the Delaware State 
Housing Authority to provide mort-
gages to low- and moderate-income 
borrowers throughout the State by pur-
chasing loans. WSFA made a $1.5 mil-
lion investment in NCALL’s Restoring 
Central Dover Initiative and a $500,000 
line of credit to help build homes for 
new homeowners who were low- and 
moderate-income and gave a $1 million 
low-interest loan for economic develop-
ment in our capital city. Capital One 
recently made a $20 million loan to fi-
nance the community education build-
ing in downtown Wilmington where 
Kuumba Academy is residing. 
The OCC final rule is wrong in sub-
stance and in process. The CRA has 
been beneficial for more than four dec-
ades. Sure, there is some room for mod-
ernization or improvement, and it is 
necessary to continue to build on this 
monumental act, but the OCC final 
rule goes in exactly the wrong direc-
tion. In substance, it is unlikely to en-
courage investment in underresourced 
and overlooked regions. Instead, it ex-
pands qualifying CRA activities to in-
clude ones that don’t directly benefit 
communities in need. This OCC rule 
will cause harm to current investment 
areas, leading to less community devel-
opment in Delaware and across our Na-
tion. 
The OCC rule would allow banks to 
pass 
their 
CRA 
assessments 
with 
broad-stroke, large investments in-
stead of smaller, targeted investments 
in underserved communities. In proc-
ess, the OCC hasn’t worked to achieve 
consensus with fellow Federal regu-
lators, the Fed and the FDIC, nor with 
banks, community advocacy, and civil 
rights groups. That is why I am joining 
my colleagues from New Jersey, Ohio, 
and many other States in voting for 
congressional disapproval of this OCC 
final rule. It undermines and actively 
weakens this important civil rights 
law. We must ensure changes to the 
CRA strengthen the law, not weaken it, 
and all the related regulators and 
stakeholders must work together to 
ensure that any changes to the CRA 
work to combat racial inequality and 
to lift up communities long overlooked 
by traditional banking and their in-
vestment priorities. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, I rise to urge my colleagues to 
take a stand for civil rights and basic 
financial fairness and join us in defense 
of the Community Reinvestment Act. I 
appreciate my distinguished colleagues 
from Delaware and the ranking Demo-
crat on the Banking Committee, Sen-
ator BROWN, for their remarks. 
For more than four decades now, this 
core civil rights law has helped ensure 
that banks that do business in our low- 
and moderate-income communities ac-
tually invest—invest—in those commu-
nities. Before the Community Rein-
vestment Act, or CRA, as it is called, 
banks often avoided lending to cus-
tomers and businesses in the lower in-
come neighborhoods where they opened 
branches. This practice was known as 
redlining because, back then, banks 
would draw literal red lines around the 
communities that they did not want to 
lend money to. Not surprisingly, the 
communities that were redlined were 
African American, Latino, and low-in-
come communities. 
In essence, they were content to take 
the deposits from low- and moderate- 
income families, people of color, small 
businesses, and farms, but then they 
turned around and denied those very 
customers mortgages, loans, and other 
lines of credit. 
The Community Reinvestment Act 
was enacted to put an end to that red-
lining and spur greater investment in 
our minority communities and lower 
income neighborhoods. But even today, 
we are still grappling with the socio-
economic and racial consequences of 
this systemic financial discrimination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6057 
October 19, 2020 
Many of our most impoverished neigh-
borhoods are the same neighborhoods 
that were redlined decades ago. It is 
one of the reasons that the genera-
tional wealth of Black and Brown 
Americans remains drastically lesser 
than those of their White counterparts. 
That is why we have to reject the 
Trump administration’s proposed rule 
changes to the Community Reinvest-
ment Act. 
The Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency’s—the OCC—CRA new rule 
would result in significantly fewer 
loans, investments, and services to 
low- 
and 
moderate-income 
commu-
nities, and it would permit banks to 
avoid businesses and investments in 
these neighborhoods. In essence, it 
would lead to a new form of modern- 
day redlining, all with the Federal 
Government’s blessing. It is no wonder 
why civil rights groups, including the 
NAACP and the Leadership Council on 
Civil and Human Rights, have fought 
so hard against this rule. They do not 
want banks to be given the green light 
to discriminate against minority and 
low-income consumers. Make no mis-
take—industry stakeholders and regu-
lators are just as divided over the 
Trump administration’s actions. That 
is why, in fact, neither the Federal De-
posit Insurance Corporation nor the 
Federal Reserve has joined in this ef-
fort. Neither of them has joined in this 
effort. 
That is why I urge our colleagues to 
do the right thing and repeal this 
harmful new CRA rule. 
In a year where the entrenched racial 
and economic disparities that have 
long plagued our Nation have been ex-
acerbated and on full display, the last 
thing we need to do is to steer money 
away from Black and Brown families, 
homeowners, 
consumers, 
and 
busi-
nesses. As a matter of fact, in the 
midst of this pandemic, we can see the 
consequences to those communities 
that are often at the frontline of mort-
gage 
foreclosure 
and 
losing 
their 
homes. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in re-
jecting this new CRA rule. This is 
about protecting civil rights. This is 
about protecting economic opportunity 
for all. And this is about continuing to 
do the hard work of reversing the dis-
crimination, the financial disparities, 
and the socioeconomic injustices that 
have plagued our Nation for far too 
long. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho is recognized. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to 
oppose the resolution vacating the 
OCC’s final rule on the Community Re-
investment Act, or CRA. 
Acting Comptroller of the Currency 
Brian Brooks has noted: ‘‘The new 
Community Reinvestment Act rule was 
finalized for one reason—to promote 
more lending and investment in under-
served areas—including low- and mod-
erate-income neighborhoods.’’ 
The key changes the rule makes are 
these: It clarifies what counts for CRA 
credit, updates where activity is evalu-
ated, evaluates CRA performance more 
objectively, and makes record-keeping 
and reporting timelier and more trans-
parent. 
The OCC’s efforts to improve the 
CRA framework began in 2017 with an 
extensive and deliberate process, en-
gaging numerous stakeholders along 
the way. The OCC issued its advance 
notice of proposed rulemaking in 2018, 
and in December 2019, the OCC jointly 
issued a proposed rule with the FDIC, 
which received 7,500 comments. The 
OCC says those comments made it bet-
ter and significantly different from the 
proposal. 
The status quo was failing. The OCC 
found that the regulatory status quo 
had failed to improve economic out-
comes for underserved groups, includ-
ing minorities and low- and moderate- 
income communities. 
The CRA regulatory process was bro-
ken. Acting Comptroller Brooks stated: 
In addition to not achieving the societal 
goals of the statute, the regulatory process 
around CRA was broken. Banks and stake-
holders were uncertain of what activities 
would qualify for CRA consideration from 
exam to exam. The framework’s lack of ob-
jectivity, transparency, consistency, and 
fairness left the whole process open to sweet-
heart deals and made it nearly impossible to 
assess the impact of billions of dollars that 
were spent each year. Stakeholders have 
voiced the need to update the CRA regula-
tions now for more than a decade. 
What does the final rule do? The final 
rule establishes objective criteria for 
determining and an illustrative list of 
what qualifies for CRA credit, while 
also creating a preapproval process for 
banks. It updates and expands assess-
ment areas to better reflect how banks 
serve customers today by adding de-
posit-based assessment areas. It also 
incentivizes CRA activity in new areas 
of need, including Indian Country and 
rural and distressed areas. The final 
rule establishes new general perform-
ance standards to more objectively 
evaluate a bank’s CRA performance. 
Finally, the rule requires banks to re-
port better data to improve the trans-
parency and accountability of banks 
and their regulators to their commu-
nities. 
Importantly, 
the 
rule 
does 
not 
change the OCC’s authority or obliga-
tion to fight discrimination and illegal 
practices. 
Several organizations have praised 
the final rule, including the Consumer 
Bankers Association, the National Dis-
ability Institute, the National Con-
gress of American Indians, and the Na-
tional Diversity Coalition. 
FDIC Chairman McWilliams noted: 
‘‘There are many provisions in the 
final rule that will greatly benefit low- 
and 
moderate-income 
communities, 
and provide greater clarity to banks on 
CRA expectations.’’ 
Last month, the Federal Reserve 
issued its own advance notice of pro-
posed rulemaking, and Acting Comp-
troller Brooks observed that ‘‘there is 
a significant amount of overlap be-
tween what the Fed has proposed and 
what the OCC has finalized.’’ 
The OCC issued this rule in May. 
Senate Democrats have waited until 
the end of the Congressional Review 
Act window to act, timing this vote to 
be most disruptive to the Senate’s floor 
schedule. More importantly, this vote 
comes after the rule’s effective date of 
October 1. Voiding it would create con-
fusion and uncertainty for commu-
nities, 
industry, 
and 
other 
stake-
holders, harming the very communities 
the CRA would help. 
Acting Comptroller Brooks said it 
well: 
Overturning the OCC’s new CRA rule would 
roll back benefits to Native Americans, peo-
ple with disabilities, American farmers, and 
small business owners. It would preserve a 
status quo that on its face has failed to 
make the progress promised 43 years ago. It 
would force banks, communities groups, and 
examiners to operate in the dark without the 
transparency, objectivity, and regulatory 
certainty that the new rule provides. It 
would also prevent future Comptrollers from 
taking up the rule to improve how CRA 
works in the future. 
Additionally, former Comptroller Jo-
seph Otting wrote: 
The coronavirus pandemic has only made 
it more dire that communities—particularly 
low- and moderate-income communities— 
need more capital and better access to cap-
ital. And they need it now. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting against this resolution, to pre-
serve this important modernization of 
our CRA regulations. 
Thank you. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the vote scheduled for 5:45 
p.m. begin immediately.

Without objection, it is so ordered.

MOTION TO ADJOURN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, our 
Republican majority refused to con-
sider the Supreme Court nominee of 
the duly elected Democratic President 
on the supposed principle that the 
American people should have a voice in 
selecting their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Now they are moving forward 
with a Supreme Court nomination 
while the Presidential election is al-
ready under way. 
This is the most rushed, most par-
tisan, least legitimate Supreme Court 
nomination process in our Nation’s his-
tory—in our Nation’s entire history— 
and it should not proceed. Therefore, I 
will move to adjourn the Senate until 
after the November 3 election with the 
ability to come back into session if 
there is a bipartisan agreement on a 
COVID relief package. 
Therefore, I move to adjourn and 
then convene for pro forma sessions 
only, with no business being conducted, 
at 12 noon on the following dates, and 
that, following each pro forma session, 
the Senate adjourn until the next pro 
forma session: Tuesday, October 20; 
Friday, October 23; Tuesday, October 
27; Friday, October 30; Tuesday, No-
vember 3; Friday, November 6; that 
when the Senate adjourns on Friday, 
November 6, it reconvene at 4:30 p.m., 
Monday, November 9, and that fol-
lowing the prayer and pledge, the 
morning hour be deemed expired, the 
Journal of proceedings be approved to 
date, the time for the two leaders be 
reserved for their use later in the day, 
and morning business be closed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That mo-
tion would require consent and is not 
in order. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. SCHUMER. I appeal the ruling of 
the Chair, and I move to table the ap-
peal. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on the motion to table the 
appeal. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Is there a sufficient 
second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator

cision of the Chair stands. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
glad we just voted down the motion by 
the Democratic leader to adjourn be-
cause we have work to do here, includ-
ing the COVID–19 legislation that we 
need to be here to be working on. So I 
am glad the motion to table was suc-
cessful. And, yes, we also have to fill a 
vacancy on the Supreme Court. 
TRIBUTE TO JOHN RUTHVEN 
Mr. President, I have come to the 
floor today to pay tribute to John 
Ruthven, a beloved son of Ohio who 
passed away last week at the age of 95. 
John Ruthven was a nationally rec-
ognized wildlife artist and a naturalist 
whose 
extraordinary 
artistic 
skills 
earned him numerous awards and other 
recognitions. But it was John’s integ-
rity, his humility, his generosity, and 
personal warmth that led to so many 
admirers. 
John never met a stranger, and even 
in these strident times, John never had 
an enemy. He was an eternal optimist 
who looked for the best in people and 
in doing so, brought out the best in ev-
eryone. 
John was a true son of Ohio who grew 
up in Cincinnati and, as a boy, was 
often found fishing and hunting and 
sketching along the Ohio River. He was 
a lifelong patriot who was very proud 
of his country and proud of having 
served his country as an 18-year-old 
sailor during World War II. He was gen-
erous of spirit and generous in giving 
back to his community, contributing 
his time and artwork to literally hun-
dreds of good causes. 
John loved his family—his kids, 
Ricki and Kevin; his grandsons, Adam 
and Matt; and his great-grandsons, Wil-
liam, Jack, and Michael. He lost the 
love of his life, Judy, just under a dec-
ade ago. They were inseparable, and 
they are now together. 
My wife Jane and I feel John’s pres-
ence every day through his artwork 
that hangs on our walls at home and at 
work. Here in my Washington, DC, of-
fice, we displayed his painting ‘‘Eagle 
to the Moon,’’ for the past decade, a 
masterpiece of natural painting signed 
not just by John but also John’s good 
friend, the famous astronaut Neil Arm-
strong. 
Each Ruthven painting has its own 
story, and ‘‘Eagle to the Moon’’ is no 
exception. 
Ohio 
Governor 
James 
Rhodes had commissioned John to 
paint an eagle on the Moon in honor of 
the Apollo 11 mission and Neil Arm-
strong’s famous words, ‘‘The eagle has 
landed.’’ John told the Governor there 
were no eagles on the Moon, and as a 
naturalist painter, he refused to place 
one there. Governor Rhodes insisted, so 
John—always a peacemaker—found a 
compromise. He painted a majestic 
bald eagle flying past an Ohio buckeye 
tree—tying the eagle, therefore, to the 
Earth and to Ohio—and put a glowing 
Moon in the background to please Gov-
ernor Rhodes. The Governor could not 
say no to such a beautiful portrayal, 
and it is beautiful. 
His paintings are displayed in the 
statehouse in Columbus and in thou-
sands of offices and living rooms all 
across Ohio and beyond. You will see 
his work when strolling through my 
hometown of Cincinnati, where the side 
of a downtown building displays a 
three-story high mural dedicated to 
Martha, the last passenger pigeon who 
died at the Cincinnati Zoo. At age 88, 
high on a rickety scaffolding in the Au-
gust heat, John Ruthven led the volun-
teers in creating that rendition of pas-
senger pigeons, taking it from one of

his paintings. Those passenger pigeons, 
once numerous and now extinct, are 
soaring through the air in a thick 
flock, warning us all of the fragility of 
nature. 
I will always feel John’s presence 
personally when I am in the woods of 
Southern Ohio, where I had the privi-
lege of spending many hours with him 
hunting for edible wild mushrooms, 
hunting turkeys, and learning from an 
accomplished naturalist who had sto-
ries about every single tree, flower, and 
bird. It was a joy to learn from John. It 
wasn’t a lecture; like every good teach-
er, John drew you in. 
John was called a modern-day James 
Audubon, and there were striking simi-
larities between the two. Both were 
naturalists, good hunters, artists, and 
authors whose work was influential in 
teaching us about the natural world. 
Like Audubon, John was rightly recog-
nized as one of the most important am-
bassadors for nature of his time. 
Starting with his delivery of a hum-
mingbird to the Cincinnati Museum of 
Natural History at age 10, his name is 
on specimens he collected around the 
world and donated to museums. Four 
Presidents commissioned painters from 
John Ruthven, and his artwork is hung 
in the galleries of the Smithsonian and 
right here in the Halls of Congress. 
Early in his career, John had the 
great honor of being selected as the 
artist for the annual Federal duck 
stamp. He has been featured in many 
major magazines and documentaries. 
He received numerous awards and hon-
ors, including from some of his favorite 
organizations like the Cincinnati Zoo, 
the Cincinnati Nature Center, the Mu-
seum Center, and so many others. 
One accolade John was most proud of 
was when he and his wife Judy were in-
ducted into the Brown County Hall of 
Fame. Judy and John had a beautiful 
farm and an art gallery in Brown Coun-
ty, 50 miles east of Cincinnati. They 
developed lifelong friendships there 
and dedicated time and energy to their 
adopted home, leading to the restora-
tion of the historic courthouse in 
Georgetown, OH, and preserving and 
promoting the boyhood home of Ulys-
ses S. Grant, one of John’s heroes. 
In 2004, I was with John and Presi-
dent George W. Bush at the White 
House when he became the first wild-
life artist ever to receive the National 
Medal of the Arts, the highest honor 
that can be bestowed upon an artist. 
Until his death, John continued to 
paint every day at his home studio. He 
still had a number of commissions he 
was working on. For countless young 
artists and lovers of nature, he was and 
will continue to be a true inspiration. 
As we mourn our loss, we take heart 
in knowing that we will all continue to 
feel his presence, that John Ruthven 
will live on through his masterful art-
work, his loving family, and all he did 
to advance the cause of appreciating 
and protecting the natural world. 
I yield the floor.

States by improving the security of a trusted 
partner which is an important force for po-
litical stability and economic progress in 
Europe. It is vital to the U.S. national inter-
est to assist Finland in developing and main-
taining a strong and ready self-defense capa-
bility. 
The proposed sale of F–35s and associated 
missiles and munitions will provide Finland 
with a credible defense capability to deter 
aggression in the region and ensure inter-
operability with U.S. forces. The proposed 
sale will replace Finland’s retiring F/A–18s 
and enhance its air-to-air and air-to-ground 
self-defense capability. Finland will have no 
difficulty absorbing these aircraft into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractors will be Lockheed 
Martin Aeronautics Company, Fort Worth, 
TX; Pratt & Whitney Military Engines, East 
Hartford, CT; The Boeing Company, St. 
Charles, MO; and Raytheon Missiles and De-
fense, Tucson, AZ. This proposal is being of-
fered in the context of a competition. If the 
proposal is accepted, it is expected that off-
set agreements will be required. Any offset 
agreement will be defined in negotiations be-
tween the purchaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require multiple trips to Finland involving 
U.S. Government and contractor representa-
tives for technical reviews/support, program 
management and training over the life of the 
program. U.S. contractor representatives 
will be required in Finland to conduct Con-
tractor 
Engineering 
Technical 
Services 
(CETS) and Autonomic Logistics and Global 
Support (ALGS) for after-aircraft delivery. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The F–35A Conventional Take Off and 
Landing (CTOL) aircraft is a single-seat, sin-
gle-engine, all-weather, stealth, fifth-genera-
tion, multirole aircraft. The F–35A CTOL 
contains sensitive technology including the 
low observable airframe/outer mold line, the 
Pratt and Whitney Fl35 engine, AN/ APG–81 
radar, an integrated core processor central 
computer, a mission systems/electronic war-
fare suite, a multiple sensor suite, technical 
data/documentation, and associated soft-
ware. Sensitive elements of the F–35A are 
also included in operational flight and main-
tenance trainers. Sensitive and classified 
elements of the F–35A CTOL aircraft include 
hardware, accessories, components, and asso-
ciated software for the following major sub-
systems: 
a. The Pratt and Whitney F135 engine is a 
single 40,000-lb thrust class engine designed 
for the F–35 and assures highly reliable, af-
fordable performance. The engine is designed 
to be utilized in all F–35 variants, providing 
unmatched commonality and supportability 
throughout the worldwide base of F–35 users. 
b. The AN/ APG–81 Active Electronically 
Scanned Array (AESA) is a high processing 
power/high transmission power electronic 
array capable of detecting air and ground 
targets from a greater distance than me-
chanically scanned array radars. It also con-
tains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), 
which creates high-resolution ground maps 
and provides weather data to the pilot, and 
provides air and ground tracks to the mis-
sion system, which uses it as a component to 
fuse sensor data. 
c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System 
(EOTS) provides long-range detection and 
tracking as well as an infrared search and 
track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared 
(FLIR) capability for precision tracking, 
weapons delivery, and bomb damage assess-
ment (BDA). The EOTS replaces multiple 
separate internal or podded systems typi-
cally found on legacy aircraft. 
d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aper-
ture System (EODAS) provides the pilot with 
full spherical coverage for air-to-air and air- 
to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision 
enhancements, a fire control capability, and 
precision tracking of wingmen/friendly air-
craft. The EODAS provides data directly to 
the pilot’s helmet as well as the mission sys-
tem. 
e. The Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a 
reprogrammable, integrated system that 
provides radar warning and electronic sup-
port measures (ESM) along with a fully inte-
grated countermeasures (CM) system. The 
EW system is the primary subsystem used to 
enhance situational awareness, targeting 
support and self-defense through the search, 
intercept, location and identification of in- 
band emitters and to automatically counter 
IR and RF threats. 
f. The Command, Control, Communica-
tions, Computers and Intelligence/Commu-
nications, Navigation, and Identification 
(C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with un-
matched connectivity to flight members, co-
alition forces, and the battlefield. It is an in-
tegrated subsystem designed to provide a 
broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and 
data communications, precision radio navi-
gation and landing capability, self-identi-
fication, beyond visual range target identi-
fication, 
and 
connectivity 
to 
off-board 
sources of information. It also includes an 
inertial navigation and global positioning 
system (GPS) for precise location informa-
tion. The functionality is tightly integrated 
within the mission system to enhance effi-
ciency. 
g. The aircraft C4I/CNI system includes 
two data links, the Multi-Function Advanced 
Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The MADL 
is designed specifically for the F–35 and al-
lows for stealthy communications between 
F–35s. Link 16 data link equipment allows 
the F–35 to communicate with legacy air-
craft using widely-distributed J-series mes-
sage protocols. 
h. The F–35 Autonomic Logistics Global 
Sustainment (ALGS) provides a fully inte-
grated logistics management solution. ALGS 
integrates a number of functional areas, in-
cluding supply chain management, repair, 
support equipment, engine support, and 
training. The ALGS infrastructure employs 
a state-of-the-art information system that 
provides real-time, decision-worthy informa-
tion for sustainment decisions by flight line 
personnel. 
Prognostic 
health 
monitoring 
technology is integrated with the air system 
and is crucial to predictive maintenance of 
vital components. 
i. The F–35 Operational Data Integrated 
Network (ODIN) provides an intelligent in-
formation infrastructure that binds all the 
key concepts of ALGS into an effective sup-
port system. ODIN establishes the appro-
priate interfaces among the F–35 Air Vehicle, 
the warfighter, the training system, govern-
ment information technology (IT) systems, 
and supporting commercial enterprise sys-
tems. Additionally, ODIN provides a com-
prehensive tool for data collection and anal-
ysis, decision support and action tracking. 
j. The F–35 Training System includes sev-
eral training devices to provide integrated 
training for pilots and maintainers. The 
pilot training devices include a Full Mission 
Simulator (FMS) and Deployable Mission 
Rehearsal Trainer (DMRT). The maintainer 
training devices include an Aircraft Systems 
Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection Sys-
tem Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer 
Mold Line (OML) Lab, Flexible Linear 
Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, F135 Engine 
Module Trainer, and Weapons Loading Train-
er (WLT). The F–35 Training System can be 
integrated, where both pilots and maintain-
ers learn in the same Integrated Training 
Center (ITC). Alternatively, the pilots and 
maintainers can train in separate facilities 
(Pilot Training Center and Maintenance 
Training Center). 
k. Other subsystems, features, and capa-
bilities include the F–35’s low observable air 
frame, Integrated Core Processor (ICP) Cen-
tral Computer, Helmet Mounted Display Sys-
tem (HMDS), Pilot Life Support System 
(PLSS), Off-Board Mission Support (OMS) 
System and publications/maintenance manu-
als. The HMDS provides a fully sunlight 
readable, bi-ocular display presentation of 
aircraft information projected onto the pi-
lot’s helmet visor. The use of a night vision 
camera integrated into the helmet elimi-
nates the need for separate Night Vision 
Goggles. The PLSS provides a measure of 
Pilot Chemical, Biological, and Radiological 
Protection through use of an On-Board Oxy-
gen Generating System (OBOGS); and an es-
cape system that provides additional protec-
tion to the pilot. OBOGS takes the Power 
and Thermal Management System (PTMS) 
air and enriches it by removing gases (main-
ly nitrogen) by adsorption, thereby increas-
ing the concentration of oxygen in the prod-
uct gas and supplying breathable air to the 
pilot. The OMS provides a mission planning, 
mission briefing, and a maintenance/intel-
ligence/tactical debriefing platform for the 
F–35. 
2. The Reprogramming Center is located in 
the United States and provides F–35 cus-
tomers a means to update F–35 electronic 
warfare databases. 
3. The AGM–158B Joint Air-to-Surface 
Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM– 
ER) is an extended range low-observable, 
highly survivable subsonic cruise missile de-
signed to penetrate next generation air de-
fense systems en-route to target. It is de-
signed to kill hard, medium-hardened, soft 
and area type targets. The extended range 
over the baseline was obtained by going from 
a turbo jet to a turbo-fan engine and by re-
configuring the fuel tanks for added capac-
ity. Purchase will include test and training 
missiles. 
4. The AGM–154 Joint Standoff Weapon 
(JSOW) is used by the Navy, Marine Corps, 
and Air Force, and allows aircraft to attack 
well-defended targets in day, night, and ad-
verse weather conditions. The JSOW C and 
C–1 
utilize 
GPS/INS 
guidance 
and 
an 
uncooled imaging infrared (IIR) seeker for 
terminal guidance, autonomous acquisition, 
and provides a precision targeting, 500-lb- 
class tandem warhead that is the Navy’s pri-
mary standoff weapon against hardened tar-
gets. The JSOW C–1 added the Link 16 data 
link enabling a robust and flexible capability 
against high-value stationary land targets 
and moving maritime target capability. 
JSOW C–1 can fly via two dimensional and 
three dimensional waypoints to the target, 
offering the optimal path around integrated 
air defense systems (IADS). 
5. The AIM–9X Block II+ (Plus) SIDE-
WINDER Missile is a supersonic, short-range 
Air-to-Air (A/A) guided missile which em-
ploys a passive Infrared (IR) target acquisi-
tion system, proportional navigational guid-
ance, and a closed-loop position servo Fin 
Actuator Unit (FAU). It represents a sub-
stantial increase in missile acquisition and 
kinematics performance over the AIM–9M 
and replaces the AIM–9X Block I Missile con-
figuration. The missile includes a high off-

boresight seeker, enhanced countermeasure 
rejection capability, low drag/high angle of 
attack airframe and the ability to integrate 
the Helmet Mounted Cueing System. The 
software algorithms are the most sensitive 
portion of the AIM–9X missile. The software 
continues to be modified via a pre-planned 
product improvement (P3I) program in order 
to improve its counter-countermeasure capa-
bilities. No software source code or algo-
rithms will be released. 
a. AIM–9X BLK II Captive Air Training 
Missile (CATM) is a flight certified inert 
mass simulator with a functioning Guidance 
Unit (GU). The CATM is the primary aircrew 
training device providing all pre-launch 
functions as well as realistic aerodynamic 
performance that equate to carrying a tac-
tical missile. The CATM provides pilot train-
ing in aerial target acquisition and use of 
aircraft controls/displays. 
b. AIM–9X BLK II+ (Plus) Tactical GU, 
WGU–57/B, provides the missile tracking, 
guidance, and control signals. The GU pro-
vides counter-countermeasures, improved re-
liability and maintainability over earlier 
Sidewinder models. Improvements include: 
(1) upgrade/redesign to the Electronics Unit 
Circuit Card Assemblies, (2) a redesigned 
center section harnessing, and (3) a larger 
capacity missile battery. 
c. AIM–9X BLK II CATM GU, WGU–57/B, is 
identical to the tactical GU except the GU 
and Control Actuation System (CAS) bat-
teries are inert and the software Captive. 
The software switch tells the missile proc-
essor that it is attached to a CATM and to 
ignore missile launch commands. The switch 
also signals software to not enter abort mode 
because there is no FAU connected to the 
GU. 
d. AIM–9X BLK II Multi-Purpose Training 
Missile (MPTM) is a ground training device 
used to train ground personnel in aircraft 
loading, 
sectionalization, 
maintenance, 
transportation, storage procedures, and tech-
niques. The missile replicates external ap-
pearance and features of a tactical AIM–9X– 
2 missile. The MPTM will physically inter-
face with loading equipment, maintenance 
equipment, launchers, and test equipment. 
The missile is explosively and electrically 
inert and is NOT flight certified. 
e. AIM–9X BLK II Dummy Air Training 
Missile (DATM) is used to train ground per-
sonnel in missile maintenance, loading, 
transportation, and storage procedures. All 
components are completely inert. The mis-
sile contains no programmable electrical 
components and is not approved for flight. 
f. AIM–9X BLK II Active Optical Target 
Detector (AOTD) is newly designed for Block 
IL The AOTD/Data Link (AOTD/DL) uses the 
latest laser technology allowing significant 
increases in sensitivity, aerosol perform-
ance, low altitude performance, and Pk 
(Probability of Kill). The AOTD/DL design 
includes a DL for 2-way platform commu-
nication. The AOTD/DL communicates with 
the GU over a serial interface which allows 
the GU to receive and transmit data so that 
a target position and status communication 
with a launching platform is possible during 
missile flight. 
6. The GBU–31 Joint Direct Attack Muni-
tion (JDAM) is a 2,000 pound Inertial Naviga-
tion 
System/Global 
Positioning 
System 
(INS/GPS) guided precision air to ground 
munition. The GBU–31 has two JDAM tailkit 
variants, KMU–556 and the KMU–557. Each 
tailkit is bomb body specific. The KMU–556 is 
assembled to the MK–84 or BLU–117 bomb 
body to make the GBU–31v1, and the KMU– 
557 is assembled with BLU–109 bomb body to 
make the GBU–31v3. 
7. The GBU–38 Joint Direct Attack Muni-
tion (JDAM) is a 500 pound INS/GPS guided 
precision air to ground munition. The GBU– 
38 consists of a KMU–572 bomb body specific 
tail kit, and MK–82 or BLU–111 bomb body. 
8. The GBU–54 Laser Joint Direct Attack 
Munition (LJDAM) is a 500 pound JDAM 
which incorporates all the capabilities of the 
JDAM guidance tail kit and adds a precision 
laser guidance set. The LJDAM gives the 
weapon system an optional semi-active laser 
guidance in addition to INS/GPS guidance. 
This provides the optional capability to 
strike moving targets. The GBU–54 consists 
of a DSU–38 laser guidance set, and a KMU– 
572 bomb body specific tail kit, and MK–82 or 
BLU–111 bomb body. 
9. The GBU–53/8 Small Diameter Bomb In-
crement II (SDB II) is a 250-lb class preci-
sion-guided, semi-autonomous, conventional, 
air-to-ground munition used to defeat mov-
ing targets through adverse weather from 
standoff range. The SDB II has deployable 
wings and fins and uses GPS/INS guidance, 
network-enabled 
datalink 
(Link–16 
and 
UHF), and a multi-mode seeker (millimeter 
wave radar, imaging infrared, semi-active 
laser) to autonomously search, acquire, 
track, and defeat targets from a standoff 
range. The SDB IT employs a multi-effects 
warhead 
(Blast, 
Fragmentation, 
and 
ShapedCharge) 
for 
maximum 
lethality 
against armored and soft targets. The SDB II 
weapon system consists of the tactical all-up 
round (AUR) weapon, a 4-place common car-
riage system, and mission planning system 
munitions application program (MAP). The 
carriage system is the BRU–61B/A. Two other 
operable configurations and two mainte-
nance training configurations are described 
as follows: 
a. SDB II Guided Test Vehicle (GTV) is an 
SDB II configuration used for land or sea 
range-based testing of the SDB TI weapon 
system. The GTV has common flight charac-
teristics of an SDB TI AUR, but in place of 
the multi-effects warhead is a Flight Termi-
nation, Tracking, and Telemetry (FTTT) 
subassembly that mirrors the AUR multi-ef-
fects warhead’s size and mass properties, but 
provides safe flight termination, free flight 
tracking and telemetry of encrypted data 
from the GTV to the data receivers. The SDB 
II GTV can have either inert or live fuses. 
All other flight control, guidance, data-link, 
and seeker functions are representative of 
the SDB II AUR. 
b. SDB II Captive Carry Vehicles (CCV), 
formerly known as Captive Carry Reliability 
Test (CCRT) vehicles, are an SDB II configu-
ration primarily used for reliability data col-
lection during carriage. The CCV has com-
mon characteristics of an SDB II AUR but 
with an inert warhead and fuze. The CCV has 
an inert mass in place of the warhead that 
mimics the warhead’s mass properties. 
c. The SDB II Weapon Load Crew Trainer 
(WLCT) is a mass mockup of the tactical 
AUR used for load crew and maintenance 
training. It does not contain energetics, a 
live fuze, any sensitive components, or haz-
ardous material. It is not flight certified. 
d. The SDB II Practical Explosive Ord-
nance Disposal Trainer (PEST) is an EOD 
training unit with sections and internal sub-
assemblies which are identical to, or cor-
relate to, the external hardware, sections 
and internal subassemblies of the tactical 
AUR. The PEST does not contain energetics, 
a live fuze, any sensitive components, or haz-
ardous material. It is not flight certified. 
10. The highest level of classification of in-
formation included in this potential sale is 
SECRET. 
11. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
12. A determination has been made that 
Finland can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furthering 
U.S. foreign policy and national security ob-
jectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 
13. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to Finland.

1. The Naval Strike Missile (NSM) Coastal 
Defense System (CDS) provides a high per-
formance, mobile, ground-based coastal de-
fense capability. It has a net centric archi-
tecture, which enables multiple simulta-
neous 
engagements 
and 
over-the-horizon 
(OTH) targeting. The system can be closely 
integrated and adapted to a country’s adja-
cent weapons and command and control sys-
tems. This expands the defended area and en-
hances the total fighting capability of the 
force. The NSM CDS is a ‘‘turn-key’’ solu-
tion that includes equipment, prime movers, 
spares, training, training equipment, logis-
tics 
support 
equipment,

timated cost is $14.7 billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by improving the security of a trusted 
partner which is an important force for po-
litical stability and economic progress in 
Europe. It is vital to the U.S. national inter-
est to assist Finland in developing and main-
taining a strong and ready self-defense capa-
bility. 
The proposed sale of F/A–18E/Fs and EA– 
18Gs and associated weapons will provide 
Finland with a credible defense capability to 
deter aggression in the region and ensure 
interoperability with U.S. Forces. The pro-
posed sale will replace Finland’s retiring F/ 
A–18C/Ds and enhance its air-to-air and air- 
to-ground self-defense capability. Finland 
will have no difficulty absorbing these air-
craft into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be The Boe-
ing Company, St. Louis, MO; Northrop 
Grumman, Los Angeles, CA; Raytheon Com-
pany, El Segundo, CA; Raytheon Missile Sys-
tems Company, Tucson, AZ; General Elec-
tric, Lynn, MA; and Lockheed Martin, Troy, 
AL. This proposal is being offered in the con-
text of a competition. If the proposal is ac-
cepted, it is expected that offset agreements 
will be required. Any offset agreement will 
be defined in negotiations between the pur-
chaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of six (6) additional 
U.S. contractor representatives to Finland 
on an intermittent basis for a duration of 
the life of the case to support delivery of the 
F/A–18E/F Super Hornet and EA–18G Growler 
aircraft and provide supply support manage-
ment, inventory control, and equipment fa-
miliarization. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

October 19, 2020 
18G Growler aircraft with all-weather, multi- 
mission capability for performing Air-to-Air 
and Air-to-Ground targeting and attack. Air- 
to-Air modes provide the capability for all- 
aspect target detection, long-range search 
and track, automatic target acquisition, and 
tracking of multiple targets. Air-to-Surface 
attack modes provide high-resolution ground 
mapping navigation, weapon delivery, and 
sensor cueing. 
b. The AN/ALR–67(V)3 Electric Warfare 
Countermeasures Receiving Set provides the 
F/A–18E/F aircrew with radar threat warn-
ings by detecting and evaluating friendly 
and hostile radar frequency threat emitters 
and providing identification and status infor-
mation about the emitters to on-board Elec-
tronic Warfare (EW) equipment and the air-
crew. The Operational Flight Program (OFP) 
and User Data Files (UDF) used in the AN/ 
ALR–67(V)3 contain threat parametric data 
used to identify and establish priority of de-
tected radar emitters. 
c. The AN/ALE–47 Countermeasures Dis-
pensing System is a threat-adaptive dis-
pensing system that dispenses chaff, flares, 
and expendable jammers for self-protection 
against airborne and ground-based Radio 
Frequency (RF) and Infrared threats. The 
Operational Flight Program (OFP) and Mis-
sion Data Files (MDF) used in the AN/ALE– 
47 contain algorithms used to calculate the 
best defense against specific threats. 
d. The AN/ALQ–214 is an advanced airborne 
Integrated Defensive Electronic Counter-
measures (IDECM) programmable modular 
automated system capable of intercepting, 
identifying, processing received radar signals 
(pulsed and continuous) and applying an op-
timum countermeasures technique in the di-
rection of the radar signal, thereby improv-
ing individual aircraft probability of sur-
vival from a variety of Surface-to-Air and 
Air-to-Air Radio Frequency (RF) threats. 
The system operates in a standalone or Elec-
tronic Warfare (EW) suite mode. In the EW 
suite mode, the AN/ALQ–214 operates in a 
fully coordinated mode with the towed dis-
pensable decoy, Radar Warning Receiver 
(RWR), and the on-board radar in the F/A– 
18E/F Super Hornet in a coordinated, non-in-
terference manner sharing information for 
enhanced information. The AN/ALQ–214 was 
designed to operate in a high-density Elec-
tromagnetic Hostile Environment with the 
ability to identify and counter a wide vari-
ety of multiple threats, including those with 
Doppler characteristics. 
e. The AN/APX–111 Combined Interrogator/ 
Transponder (CIT) with the Conformal An-
tenna System (CAS) is a complete MARK– 
XII identification system compatible with 
Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Modes 1, 2, 
3/A, C and 4 (secure). A single slide-in module 
that can be customized to the unique cryp-
tographic functions for a specific country 
provides the systems secure mode capabili-
ties. As a transponder, the CIT is capable or 
replying to interrogation modes 1, 2, 3/A C 
(altitude) and secure mode 4. The require-
ment is to upgrade Finland’s Combined In-
terrogator Transponder (CIT) AN/APX–111 
(V) IFF system software to implement Mode 
Select (Mode S) capabilities. Beginning in 
early 2005 EUROCONTROL mandated the 
civil community in Europe to transition to a 
Mode S only system and for all aircraft to be 
compliant by 2009. The Mode S Beacon Sys-
tem is a combined data link and Secondary 
Surveillance Radar (SSR) system that was 
standardized in 1985 by the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Mode S 
provides air surveillance using a data link 
with a permanent unique aircraft address. 
Selective Interrogation provides higher data 
integrity, reduced Radio Frequency (RF) in-
terference levels, increased air traffic capac-
ity, and adds air-to-ground data link. 
f. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Sys-
tem (JHMCS) is a modified HGU–55/P helmet 
that incorporates a visor-projected Heads-Up 
Display (HUD) to cue weapons and aircraft 
sensors to air and ground targets. In close 
combat, a pilot must currently align the air-
craft to shoot at a target. JHMCS allows the 
pilot to simply look at a target to shoot. 
This system projects visual targeting and 
aircraft performance information on the 
back of the helmet’s visor, enabling the pilot 
to monitor this information without inter-
rupting his field of view through the cockpit 
canopy, the system uses a magnetic trans-
mitter unit fixed to the pilot’s seat and a 
magnetic field probe mounted on the helmet 
to define helmet pointing positioning. A Hel-
met Vehicle Interface (HVI) interacts with 
the aircraft system bus to provide signal 
generation for the helmet display. This pro-
vides significant improvement for close com-
bat targeting and engagement. 
g. The Joint Mission Planning System 
(JMPS) will provide mission planning capa-
bility for support of military aviation oper-
ations. It will also provide support for unit- 
level mission planning for all phases of mili-
tary flight operations and have the capa-
bility to provide necessary mission data for 
the 
aircrew. 
JMPS 
will 
support 
the 
downloading of data to electronics data 
transfer devices for transfer to aircraft and 
weapon systems. A JMPS for a specific air-
craft type will consist of basic planning tools 
called the Joint Mission Planning Environ-
ment (JMPE) mated with a Unique Planning 
Component (UPC) provided by the aircraft 
program. In addition, UPCs will be required 
for specific weapons, communication devices, 
and moving map displays. The JMPS will be 
tailored to the specific releasable configura-
tion for the F/A–18E/F Super Hornet and EA– 
18G Growler. 
h. The AN/AVS–9 Night Vision Goggles 
(NVG) provide imagery sufficient for an avi-
ator to complete night time missions down 
to starlight and extreme low light condi-
tions. The AN/AVS–9 is designed to satisfy 
the F/A–18E/F mission requirements for cov-
ert night combat, engagement, and support. 
The third generation light amplification 
tubes provide a high-performance, image-in-
tensification system for optimized F/A–18E/F 
and EA–18G night flying at terrain-masking 
altitudes. 
i. The AN/AVS–11 Night Vision Goggles 
(NVG) is capable of high resolution imaging. 
This capability allows reduced visibility 
weapon delivery. While the NVCD hardware 
is UNCLASSIFIED, this item requires En-
hanced End Use Monitoring (EEUM). 
j. The AN/ALE–55 Towed Decoy improves 
aircraft survivability by providing an en-
hanced, coordinated onboard/off-board coun-
termeasure response to enemy threats. 
k. The Multifunctional Informational Dis-
tribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical 
Radio System (JTRS) a secure data and 
voice communication network using Link–16 
architecture. The system provides enhanced 
situational awareness, positive identifica-
tion of participants within the network, se-
cure fighter-to-fighter connectivity, secure 
voice 
capability, 
and 
ARN–118 
TACAN 
functionality. It provides three major func-
tions: Air Control, Wide Area Surveillance, 
and Fighter-to-Fighter. The MIDS JTRS can 
be used to transfer data in Air-to-Air, Air-to- 
Surface, and Air-to-Ground scenarios. The 
MIDS Enhanced Interference Blanking Unit 
(EIBU) provides validation and verification 
of equipment and concept. EIBU enhances 
input/output signal capacity of the MIDS 
JTRS and addresses parts obsolescence. 
l. LAU–127E/A Guided Missile Launchers 
designed to enable F/A–18E/F Super Hornet 
aircraft to carry and launch missiles. It pro-
vides the electrical and mechanical interface 
between the missile and launch aircraft as 
well as the two-way data transfer between 
missile and cockpit controls and displays to 
support preflight orientation and control cir-
cuits to prepare and launch the missile. 
m. Accurate Navigation (ANAV) Global 
Positioning System (GPS) also includes Key 
Loading Installation and Facility Charges. 
The ANAV is a 24-channel SAASM based 
pulse-per-second GPS receiver built for next 
generation GPS technology. 
n. The AN/ARC–210 Radio’s Line-of-sight 
data transfer rates up to 80 kb/s in a 25 kHz 
channel creating high-speed communication 
of critical situational awareness information 
for increased mission effectiveness. Software 
that is reprogrammable in the field via Mem-
ory Loader/Verifier Software making flexible 
use for multiple missions. The AN/ARC–210 
has embedded software with programmable 
cryptography for secure communications. 
o. AN/PYQ–1O(C) is the next generation of 
the currently fielded AN/CYZ–10 Data Trans-
fer Device (DTD). The AN/PYQ–1O(C) pro-
vides automated, secure and user-friendly 
methods for managing and distributing cryp-
tographic key material, Signal Operating In-
structions (SOI), and Electronic Protection 
data. This course introduces some of the 
basic components and activities associated 
with the AN/PYQ–1O(C) in addition to hands- 
on training. Learners will become familiar 
with the security features of the SKL, prac-
tice the initial setup of the SKL, and will re-
ceive and distribute electronic keys using 
the SKL. 
p. KIV–78 Dual Channel Encryptor Mode 4/ 
Mode 5 Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) Crypto 
applique includes aircraft installs and initial 
spares, to ensure proper identification of air-
craft during coalition efforts. The KIV–78

s. The Advanced Targeting Forward Look-
ing Infrared (ATFLIR) pod is a multi-sensor, 
electro-optical targeting pod incorporating 
infrared, low-light television camera, laser 
range finder/target designator, and laser spot 
tracker. It is used to provide navigation and 
targeting for military aircraft in adverse 
weather and using precision-guided weapons 
such as laser guided bombs. It offers much 
greater target resolution and imagery accu-
racy than previous systems. 
t. The Infrared Search and Track (IRST) is 
a long wave infrared targeting pod in an ex-
ternal fuel tank outer mold and carried on 
the centerline station. The IRST has an up-
graded infrared receiver and processor to 
provide full system capability. 
u. The Distributed Targeting Processor— 
Networked (DTP-N) will host the geo-loca-
tion capability previously resident in the 
DTS, providing increased memory and speed, 
improving overall functionality. DTP-N en-
abled geo-registration and targeting en-
hancements, when used in conjunction with 
the advanced networking capabilities, will 
provide near real-time dissemination of ac-
tionable warfighting data thereby reducing

y. LAU-l16B/A Guided Missile Launchers 
designed to enable F/A–18E/F Super Hornet 
aircraft to carry and launch missiles. Two 
launchers, one left hand and one right hand, 
are installed in the underside of the aircraft 
fuselage at stations 4 and 6. The launchers 
are recessed in cavities within the aircraft 
fuselage, allowing the missiles to be semi re-
cessed 
for 
aerodynamic 
purposes. 
Both 
versions of the LAU–116 are ejection launch-
ers. 
z. LAU-118A Guided Missile Launchers de-
signed to enable F/A–18E/F Super Hornet air-
craft to carry and launch missiles. It pro-
vides the electrical and mechanical interface 
between the missile and launch aircraft, as 
well as the two-way data transfer between 
missile and cockpit controls and displays to 
support preflight orientation and control cir-
cuits to prepare and launch the missile. 
aa. The Advanced Electronic Attack Kit 
for the EA–18G Growler consists of the ALQ– 
2l8(V)2 Tactical Jamming Receiver, ALQ–

Receiver (JTTR) and associated hardware re-
quired for installation. 
bb. Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band 
(NGJ-MB) Sets provides a mid-band jamming 
capability for the EA–18G. On aircraft, two 
NGJ-MB pods, referred to as a shipset, work 
in conjunction with one another to provide 
full-uninterrupted azimuth coverage. NGJ- 
MB is designed to operate as a symmetric 
loadout, with one each on stations 3 and 9. 
cc. The SNIPER Pod is a multi-sensor, 
electro-optical targeting pod incorporating 
infrared, low-light television camera, laser 
rangefinder/target designator, and laser spot 
tracker. It is used to provide navigation and 
targeting for military aircraft in adverse 
weather and using precision-guided weapons 
such as laser-guided bombs. It offers much 
greater target resolution and imagery accu-
racy than previous systems. 
dd. AN/AAQ–28(V) Litening Targeting Pod 
is a multi-sensor, electro-optical targeting 
pod incorporating infrared, low-light tele-
vision camera, laser rangefinder/target des-
ignator, and laser spot tracker. It signifi-
cantly increases the combat effectiveness of 
the aircraft during day night and other 
weather conditions in the attack of air and 
ground missions. The targeting pod contains 
high resolution forward looking infrared sen-
sors that displays an infrared image of the 
target to the aircrew. 
ee. Cartridge Actuated Devices (CADs) are 
designed for the F/A–18E/F Super Hornet as 
small explosive devices used to eject stores 
from launched devices, actuate other explo-
sive systems, or provide initiation for air-
crew escape devices. Propellant Actuated De-
vices (PADs) are a tool or specialized mecha-
nized device or gas generator system that is 
activated by a propellant or releases or di-
rects work through a propellant charge. 
Weapons release, aircraft ejection, life sup-
port, and fire-suppression systems are some 
facets that rely heavily on CADs and PADs. 
ff. Books and Other Publications includes 
flight manuals, technical manuals and sup-
port of technical data and updates, release 
and distribution of classified publications for 
the operation and/or maintenance of the F / 
A–18E/F aircraft or systems. 
gg. Software provides for initial design and 
development of the Electronic Warfare Soft-
ware suite which encompasses AN/ALQ–214,

stallation 
for 
the 
Tactical 
Operational 
Flight Trainers (TOFT), Low Cost Trainers 
(LCT), Aircrew courseware and spares for de-
livery and installation of Systems Configu-
ration Sets (SCS). 
2. The AIM–9X Block II Sidewinder Missile 
is a supersonic, short-range Air-to-Air (A/A) 
guided missile which employs a passive In-
frared (IR) target acquisition system, pro-
portional 
navigational 
guidance, 
and 
a 
closed-loop position servo Fin Actuator Unit 
(FAU). It represents a substantial increase in 
missile acquisition and kinematics perform-
ance over the AIM–9M and replaces the AIM– 
9X Block I Missile configuration. The missile 
includes a high off-boresight seeker, en-
hanced countermeasure rejection capability, 
low drag/high angle of attack airframe and 
the ability to integrate the Helmet Mounted 
Cueing System. The software algorithms are 
the most sensitive portion of the ATM–9X 
missile. The software continues to be modi-
fied via a preplanned product improvement 
(P3I) program in order to improve its 
counter-countermeasure 
capabilities. 
No 
software source code or algorithms will be 
released. 
a. AIM–9X BLK II Captive Air Training 
Missile (CATM) is a flight certified inert 
mass simulator with a functioning Guidance 
Unit (GU). The CATM is the primary aircrew 
training device providing all pre-launch 
functions as well as realistic aerodynamic 
performance that equate to carrying a tac-
tical missile. The CATM provides pilot train-
ing in aerial target acquisition and use of 
aircraft controls/displays. 
b. AIM–9X BLK II Tactical GU, WGU–57/B, 
provides the missile tracking, guidance, and 
control signals. The GU provides counter- 
countermeasures, improved reliability and 
maintainability 
over 
earlier 
Sidewinder 
models. Improvements include: (1) upgrade/ 
redesign to the Electronics Unit Circuit Card 
Assemblies, (2) a redesigned center section 
harnessing, and (3) a larger capacity missile 
battery. 
c. AIM–9X BLK II CATM GU, WGU–57/B, is 
identical to the tactical GU except the GU 
and Control Actuation System (CAS) bat-
teries are inert and the software Captive. 
The software switch tells the missile proc-
essor that it is attached to a CATM and to 
ignore missile launch commands. The switch 
also signals software to not enter abort mode 
because there is no FAU connected to the 
GU. 
d. AIM–9X BLK II Multi-Purpose Training 
Missile (MPTM) is a ground training device 
used to train ground personnel in aircraft 
loading, 
sectionalization, 
maintenance, 
transportation, storage procedures, and tech-
niques. The missile replicates external ap-
pearance and features of a tactical AIM–9X– 
2 missile. The MPTM will physically inter-
face with loading equipment, maintenance 
equipment, launchers, and test equipment. 
The missile is explosively and electrically 
inert and is NOT flight certified. 
e. AIM–9X BLK II Dummy Air Training 
Missile (DATM) is used to train ground per-
sonnel in missile maintenance, loading, 
transportation, and storage procedures. All 
components are completely inert. The mis-
sile contains no programmable electrical 
components and is not approved for flight. 
f. AIM–9X BLK II Active Optical Target 
Detector (AOTD) is newly designed for Block 
II. The AOTD/Data Link (AOTD/DL) uses the 
latest laser technology allowing significant 
increases in sensitivity, aerosol perform-
ance, low altitude performance, and Pk 
(Probability of Kill). The AOTD/DL design 
includes a DL for 2–way platform commu-
nication. The AOTD/DL communicates with 
the GU over a serial interface which allows 
the GU to receive and transmit data so that 
a target position and status communication 
with a launching platform is possible during 
missile flight. 
3. The GBU–53/B Small Diameter Bomb In-
crement II (SDB II) is a 250-lb class precision 
guided, semi-autonomous, conventional, air- 
to-ground munition used to defeat moving 
targets through adverse weather from stand-
off range. The SDB II has deployable wings 
and fins and uses GPS/INS guidance, net-
work-enabled datalink (Link–16 and UHF), 
and a multi-mode seeker (millimeter wave 
radar, imaging infrared, semi-active laser) to 
autonomously search, acquire, track, and de-
feat targets. The SDB II employs a multi-ef-
fects warhead (Blast, Fragmentation, and 
Shaped 
Charge) 
for 
maximum 
lethality 
against armored and soft targets. The SDB II 
weapon system consists of the tactical all-up 
round (AUR) weapon, a 4–place common car-
riage system, and mission planning system 
munitions application program (MAP). The 
carriage system is the BRU–61B/A. The BRU 
and the MAP are not further described here. 
Two other operable configurations, two 
maintenance training configurations, and 
two containers of the system are described 
as follows: 
a. SDB II Guided Test Vehicle (GTV) is an 
SDB II configuration used for land or sea 
range-based testing of the SDB II weapon 
system. The GTV has common flight charac-
teristics of an SDB II AUR, but in place of 
the multi-effects warhead is a Flight Termi-
nation, Tracking, and Telemetry (FTTT) 
subassembly that mirrors the AUR multi-
effects warhead’s size and mass properties, 
but provides safe flight termination, free 
flight tracking and telemetry of encrypted 
data from the GTV to the data receivers. The 
SDB II GTV can have either inert or live 
fuzes. All other flight control, guidance, 
data-link, and seeker functions are rep-
resentative of the SDB II AUR. 
b. SDB II Captive Carry Vehicles (CCVs), 
formerly known as Captive Carry Reliability 
Test (CCRT) vehicles are an SDB II configu-
ration primarily used for reliability data col-
lection during carriage. The CCV has com-
mon characteristics of an SDB II AUR but 
with an inert warhead and fuze. The CCV has 
an inert mass in place of the warhead that 
mimics the warhead’s mass properties. The 
CCV is a flight capable representative of the 
SDB II AUR but has not yet been approved 
for release from any aircraft. Since all other 
flight control, guidance, data-link, and seek-
er functions are representative of the SDB II 
AUR, with flight release approval, this con-
figuration could be used for any purpose 
where an inert round without telemetry or 
termination capability would be useful. 
c. The SDB II Weapon Load Crew Trainer 
(WLCT) is a mass mockup of the tactical 
AUR used for load crew and maintenance 
training. It does not contain energetics, a

terial. It is not flight certified. 
d. The SDB II Practical Explosive Ordi-
nance Disposal Trainer (PEST) is an EOD 
training unit with sections and internal sub-
assemblies which are identical to, or cor-
relate to, the external hardware, sections 
and internal subassemblies of the tactical 
AUR. The PEST does not contain energetics, 
a live fuze, classified or hazardous material. 
It is not flight certified. 
e. The SDB II single round container, no-
menclature CNU–714/U, is airtight sealable 
and contains a BIT harness assembly that al-
lows for BIT testing and software reprogram-
ming without the need for removing the 
cover assembly. The base assembly contains 
a humidity indicator, a breather valve, and a 
desiccant port/BIT access cover on the aft 
side of the container. There are also two 
forklift pockets located on the base assem-
bly. Internally, the CNU–714/U contains sepa-
rate upper and lower cradle assemblies. The 
lower cradle assembly is attached to the base 
assembly on top of four wire rope shock 
insulators, which provide shock isolation 
during transport. The upper cradle assembly 
provides an interface with standard Air 
Force loading equipment. The CNU–714/U 
lower cradle assembly contains indexing 
blocks that allow multiple lower cradle as-
semblies to be placed on the ground, side-by- 
side, for quick loading of a BRU–61. 
f. The SDB II dual round container, nomen-
clature CNU–715/U, is airtight sealable and 
contains two BIT harness assemblies that 
allow for BIT testing and software re-
programming without the need for removing 
the cover assembly. The base assembly con-
tains a breather valve and a desiccant port/ 
BIT access cover on the aft side of the con-
tainer. The dual container has two separate 
lower cradle assemblies. Each lower cradle 
assembly is attached to the base assembly on 
top of four wire rope shock insulators, which 
provide shock isolation during transport. 
The lower cradles of the CNU–715/U are not 
detachable from the base assembly. The 
cover assembly contains a humidity indi-
cator and four latch assemblies to aid in the 
stacking of CNU–715/U containers on top of 
each other. There are also two sets of fork-
lift pockets, laterally and longitudinally, lo-
cated on the base assembly. 
4. The AGM–158B Joint Air-to-Surface 
Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM 
ER) is an extended range low-observable, 
highly survivable subsonic cruise missile de-
signed to penetrate next generation air de-
fense systems en-route to target. It is de-
signed to kill hard, medium hardened, soft 
and area type targets. The extended range 
over the baseline was obtained by going from 
a turbo jet to a turbo-fan engine and by re-
configuring the fuel tanks for added capac-
ity. Classification of the technical data and 
information on the AGM–158’s performance, 
capabilities, 
systems, 
subsystems, 
oper-
ations, and maintenance will range from UN-
CLASSIFIED to SECRET. 
a. The AGM–158B Joint Air-to-Surface 
Standoff Missile (JASSM) software-in-the- 
Loop (SIL) testing assets are required for 
software development, integration, and test 
in the lab environment as well as ground 
mount operations before STV or Live Fire 
assets can be loaded on the aircraft to exe-
cute Airworthiness, Flight Test, and Live 
Fire events. These assets are for testing in 
the contiguous United States and will not be 
exported. Software development will be to 
the extent necessary to produce Engineering 
Releases needed to conduct airworthiness, 
integration and live fire testing. Testing 
equipment is CLASSIFIED. 
b. The AGM–158B–2 JASSM Separation 
Test Vehicle (STV) is equipped with Intel-
ligent Test Instrumentation Kit (iTIK). 
These assets will be used as part of the air-
worthiness data collection process to ensure 
safe separation of the munition from the air-
craft. These missiles will be handled and 
stored in custom individual containers. 
These two (2) missiles are for testing in the 
contiguous United States and will not be ex-
ported. Software development will be to the

leases needed to conduct airworthiness, inte-
gration and live fire testing. 
c. The AGM–158B–2 (JASSM) Instrumented 
Test Vehicle (ITV) is equipped with iTIK. 
This asset will be utilized to capture flight 
data information in a ‘‘Captive Carry’’ con-
figuration. The information collected will 
ensure the munition can be safely carried 
and is required as part of the airworthiness 
process prior to launch of the STV, JTV, and 
the Live Fire asset. These missiles will be 
handled and stored in custom individual con-
tainers. This missile is for testing in the con-
tiguous United States and will not be ex-
ported. Software development will be to the 
extent necessary to produce Engineering Re-
leases needed to conduct airworthiness, inte-
gration and live fire testing. 
d. The AGM–158B–2 JASSM Jettison Test 
Vehicle (JTV) is not equipped with an iTIK. 
These assets will be used as part of the air-
worthiness data collection process to ensure 
safe jettison of the munition from the air-
craft. These missiles will be handled and 
stored in custom individual containers. 
These two (2) missiles are for testing in the 
contiguous United States and will not be ex-
ported. Software development will be to the 
extent necessary to produce Engineering Re-
leases needed to conduct airworthiness, inte-
gration and live fire testing. 
e. The AGM–158B–2 JASSM Maintenance

NUCLEAR SCIENCE WEEK 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to call attention to Nuclear 
Science Week, Oct. 19–23. 
Established in 2010, Nuclear Science 
Week aims to educate the public on the 
five pillars of nuclear science: carbon- 
free energy, global leadership, trans-
formative healthcare, innovation and 
technology, and space exploration. 
In Idaho, Nuclear Science Week is es-
pecially important because we host the 
Nation’s lead national laboratory for 
nuclear energy research and develop-
ment: Idaho National Laboratory. 
In 2019, INL celebrated its 70th anni-
versary. The laboratory’s rich research 
legacy includes 52 test reactors built 
and deployed in the eastern Idaho 
desert, and empowerment of a nuclear 
energy industry that today produces 
nearly 20 percent of our Nation’s elec-
tricity and more than half our zero- 
carbon emitting electricity. 
INL research helped develop Amer-
ica’s nuclear Navy, which has contrib-
uted to U.S. national security efforts 
for decades. Research at INL’s Ad-
vanced Test Reactor, which has been in 
operation for more than a half century, 
allowed for the modernization of our 
nuclear Navy, whose ships and sub-
marines can now operate for decades 
without costly and time-consuming re-
fueling. 
Nuclear Science Week allows us to 
focus attention on the training, edu-
cation, and empowerment of the future 
energy 
workforce, 
students 
across 
America who will develop the techno-
logical breakthroughs of the future. In 
the meantime, INL remains at the fore-
front of our Nation’s effort to develop 
and deploy advanced nuclear tech-
nologies, including small modular nu-
clear reactors and microreactors. 
As the home of the National Reactor 
Innovation Center, INL’s world-class

researchers, working with industry, 
will develop those technologies that 
allow us to retain our world leadership 
role in nuclear energy while ensuring 
economic 
prosperity 
and 
environ-
mental protection. 
In reference to the fifth pillar of nu-
clear science, space exploration, all of 
us in Idaho are proud to say that INL 
played an important role in the recent 
launch of the 2020 Mars Rover by as-
sembling and testing the nuclear power 
system that will allow NASA scientists 
to learn more about our universe. 
I am honored to represent this impor-
tant national laboratory, which em-
bodies the traits that built our Nation: 
scientific achievement, the pursuit of 
knowledge, and curiosity. 
By spreading the word about Nuclear 
Science Week and inspiring our youth, 
we will make the world a better place 
for everyone.

RECOGNIZING EASTON 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am 
delighted to commend Easton Elemen-
tary School in Easton, ME, on being 
named a 2020 National Blue Ribbon Ex-
emplary High Performing School. Serv-
ing 128 students from pre-kindergarten 
through sixth grade, this outstanding 
school is one of only 367 schools across 
the country this year to receive Blue 
Ribbon recognition from the U.S. De-
partment of Education. 
Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon 
Schools Program honors public and pri-
vate schools that are either academi-
cally superior in their States or that 
demonstrate significant gains in stu-
dent achievement. The schools singled 
out for this national recognition are 
models of high educational standards 
and accountability. 
Easton is a rural community of 1,300 
residents in Aroostook County, just 20 
miles from my hometown of Caribou. It 
is a small town with a big commitment 
to education. 
Easton Elementary School’s mission 
is to achieve academic excellence in a 
safe and nurturing environment of fair-
ness, respect, and caring. All students 
are provided with personal enrichment 
opportunities and work with teachers 
and staff to set their own learning 
goals. 
The core curriculum is math, lit-
eracy, and social studies, with a par-
ticular focus on science. Students regu-
larly visit the renowned Francis Mal-
colm Science Center in Easton, which 
has a planetarium, interactive labora-
tory, and nature studies area. 
In addition to strong theater and 
music programs, the school places an 
emphasis on helping students develop 
healthy lifestyles. The relationship be-
tween the school and the Easton Recre-
ation Department provides students 
with 
opportunities 
for 
traditional 
sports programming, as well as cooking 
lessons and babysitting courses. 
Citizenship is an important part of 
the curriculum. Students participate in 
activities to support polio vaccine dis-
tribution, cancer research, and Down 
syndrome awareness. Easton is an agri-
cultural community, and the school 
continues the Aroostook County tradi-
tion of starting the school year early 
to accommodate a 3-week break in the 
fall so students can help local farmers 
with the potato harvest. An active par-
ent-teacher organization helps to forge 
a strong bond between the school and 
the community. 
I applaud the administrators, teach-
ers, staff, and parents of Easton Ele-
mentary School. Together, they are 
succeeding in their mission to build 
students’ confidence and generate mo-
mentum for learning. I am pleased that 
the U.S. Department of Education has 
selected Easton Elementary School for 
this well-deserved honor, and I con-
gratulate the entire community for 
this outstanding achievement.

RECOGNIZING MARY SNOW 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am 
delighted to commend Mary Snow Ele-
mentary School in Bangor, ME, on 
being named a 2019 National Blue Rib-
bon 
Exemplary 
High 
Performing 
School. Serving 240 students in the 
fourth and fifth grades, this out-
standing school is one of only 367 
schools across the country this year to 
receive Blue Ribbon recognition from 
the U.S. Department of Education. 
Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon 
Schools Program honors public and pri-
vate schools that are either academi-
cally superior in their States or that 
demonstrate significant gains in stu-
dent achievement. The schools singled 
out for this national recognition are 
models of high educational standards 
and accountability. 
The Blue Ribbon designation con-
tinues a tradition of quality education 
in Bangor. Last year, the pre-kinder-
garten 
through 
third 
grade 
Fruit 
Street Elementary School, which sends 
students to Mary Snow, was recognized 
as a Blue Ribbon School. 
Although students attend Mary Snow 
School for only 2 years, teachers and 
staff strive to build positive relation-
ships with students and their families 
and create a welcoming atmosphere. 
The school involves families by hosting 
10 events each year that encourage par-
ents and guardians to become involved 
in their child’s education. 
The 
Bangor 
School 
Department’s 
mission is ‘‘Academic Excellence for 
All.’’ At Mary Snow, students are en-
couraged to develop their full poten-
tial. The core curriculum of language 
arts, math, science, and social studies 
is rigorous, yet provides the flexibility 
for individual students to learn at their 
own pace. 
Mary Snow is committed to helping 
students pursue their interests and to 
discover new ones. Strong visual and 
performing arts programs encourage 
creativity. Physical education encour-
ages healthy lifestyles. Technology is 
integrated into the classroom so that 
students develop the skills to succeed 
in the 21st century economy. 
Faculty, parents, and community 
members are committed to both aca-
demic excellence and each child’s so-
cial, emotional, and physical health. 
Faculty work to ensure a safe and se-
cure learning environment and to de-
velop strong and collaborative rela-
tionships with parents and community 
members. An active parent-teacher or-
ganization 
supports 
enriching

I applaud the administrators, teach-

RECOGNIZING POND COVE 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am 
delighted to commend Pond Cove Ele-
mentary School of Cape Elizabeth, ME, 
on being named a 2020 National Blue 
Ribbon Exemplary High Performing 
School. This outstanding school is one 
of only 367 schools across the country 
to receive Blue Ribbon recognition 
from the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation. 
Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon 
Schools Program honors public and pri-
vate schools that are either academi-
cally superior in their States or that 
demonstrate significant gains in stu-
dent achievement. The schools singled 
out for this national recognition are 
models of high educational standards 
and accountability. 
This 
prestigious 
designation 
con-
tinues Cape Elizabeth’s tradition of 
quality education. Last year, Cape 
Elizabeth High School was awarded its 
second Blue Ribbon. Many high school 
and middle school students serve as 
volunteer mentors for elementary pu-
pils, making a strong and positive im-
pact on young learners. 
Pond Cove serves 530 pupils from kin-
dergarten through the fourth grade. 
This award recognizes the hard work 
and determination of students, teach-
ers, and staff. It is a top-performing 
school on State-required assessments, 
and educators at the school use assess-
ments throughout the academic year 
as a tool for improving and custom-
izing instruction. A strong commit-
ment to professional development en-
sures that teachers and staff, as well as 
students, are lifelong learners. 
Pond Cove excels as a school built on 
a foundation of the school district’s 
values of community, academics, pas-
sion, and ethics. Through a unique tra-
dition of adding links to a paper chain

throughout the school, teachers and 
staff recognize students who dem-
onstrate those values, instilling a sense 
of individual and school pride. 
In addition to a rigorous core cur-
riculum and a focus on world lan-
guages, the school is known for its ex-
tensive extracurricular activities in 
academics, athletics, and the arts, and 
students are encouraged to pursue 
their 
interests. 
A 
comprehensive 
health and wellness program empha-
sizes good nutrition, physical activity, 
and 
stress 
management. 
The 
schoolwide 
peacemakers 
curriculum 
helps students develop the skills to 
work collaboratively and to respect 
others. Students learn the value of 
community service through a variety 
of opportunities, such as supporting 
the local food pantry and connecting 
with senior citizens. 
Family and community support is 
one of the school’s greatest assets. The 
Pond Cove Parents Association and 
other community organizations pro-
vide supplemental funding and re-
sources. Just last year, parents, staff 
members, and local businesses joined 
together to create a new playground 
and outdoor learning center with out-
door classrooms, vegetable gardens, 
and nature observation areas. 
This Blue Ribbon Award is a tribute 
not only to the students, but also to 
the administrators, teachers, staff, and 
parents 
of 
Pond 
Cove 
Elementary 
School. Together, they are succeeding 
in their mission to generate excite-
ment and momentum for learning. 
They are making a difference in the 
lives of their students, helping them 
reach their full potential as inde-
pendent, responsible learners and citi-
zens. I congratulate the entire Cape 
Elizabeth community for this well-de-
served recognition.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING ADVANCED CERAMIC 
FIBERS 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to 
honor Advanced Ceramic Fibers in 
Idaho Falls as the Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Month for October 2020. 
Prior to founding Advanced Ceramic 
Fibers, Dr. John Garnier enjoyed 6 suc-
cessful years as the armor program 
lead for the National and Homeland Se-
curity Directorate at the Idaho Na-
tional Lab, INL. As part of his work, 
Dr. Garnier co-invented a process for 
converting carbon fibers into an alpha 
silicon carbide for military use and 
found that the product could have nu-
merous applications in the infrastruc-
ture, energy, and aerospace industries. 
Recognizing its potential, Dr. Garnier 
retired from INL and teamed up with 
businessmen Ken Koller, Shawn Per-
kins, and David Harrell to commer-
cialize his invention and establish Ad-
vanced Ceramic Fibers. With the help 
of the INL technology transfer pro-
gram, the Idaho Small Business Devel-
opment Center, and 3 years of self- 
funding, the startup was able to expand 
operations, hire additional employees 
for research and development, and se-
cure contracts with several govern-
ment agencies. 
Since its founding, Advanced Ce-
ramic Fibers has become a leading ex-
ample of small business driven innova-
tion in Idaho. Its clients, including the 
Department of Energy, U.S. Navy, and 
NASA, have utilized its production of 
heat and abrasion resistant fibers in 
the development of aerospace and sta-
tionary power generation turbines and 
nuclear propulsion engines. They have 
expanded their innovations to include 
34 different kinds of novel metallic car-
bides in both fiber and nano-particle 
forms. It is no surprise that the com-
pany was awarded the Early Stage In-
novation of the Year award for 2015 by 
the Idaho Technology Council and the 
2016 Excellence in Business Award from 
the Idaho Small Business Development 
Center. 
With the slogan ‘‘Transforming the 
Reinforced 
Materials 
Marketplace,’’ 
Advanced Ceramic Fibers continues to 
be a catalyst of innovation in the Gem 
State. Today, the company employs 
nearly a dozen employees and owns the 
rights to nine different patents. With 
its continued growth, the business is 
now expanding into a larger facility 
and expects to provide more than two 
dozen jobs to the local community. Ad-
vance Ceramic Fiber’s ingenuity and 
cutting-edge product designs exemplify 
how Idaho small businesses continue to 
lead the country in technological de-
velopment. 
Congratulations 
to 
John, 
Ken, 
Shawn, Dave, and all of the employees 
of Advanced Ceramic Fibers on being 
selected as the Idaho Small Business of 
the Month for October 2020. You make 
our great State proud, and I look for-
ward to your continued growth and 
success.∑

ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION—SCIENCE 
STUDY ON COVID–19 DISINFORMATION 
SEC. 204. (a) STUDY.—No later than 30 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Director of the National Science Foundation 
shall enter into an arrangement with the Na-
tional Academies of Science, Engineering, 
and Medicine (National Academies) to con-
duct a study on the current understanding of 
the 
spread 
of 
COVID–19-related 
disinformation on the internet and social 
media platforms. The study shall address the 
following: 
(1) the role disinformation and misin-
formation has played in the public response 
to COVID–19; 
(2) 
the 
sources 
of 
COVID–19-related 
disinformation—both foreign and domestic— 
and 
the 
mechanisms 
by 
which 
that 
disinformation influences the public debate; 
(3) the role social media plays in the dis-
semination and promotion of COVID–19 
disinformation and misinformation content 
and the role social media platforms play in 
the organization of groups seeking to spread 
COVID–19 disinformation; 
(4) the potential financial returns for cre-
ators 
or 
distributors 
of 
COVID–19 
disinformation, and the role such financial 
incentives play in the propagation of COVID– 
19 disinformation; 
(5) potential strategies to mitigate the dis-
semination and negative impacts of COVID– 
19 disinformation, including specifically, the 
dissemination of disinformation on social 
media, including through improved disclo-
sures; and 
(6) an analysis of the limitations of these 
mitigation strategies, and an analysis of how 
these strategies can be implemented without 
infringing 
on 
Americans’ 
Constitutional 
rights and civil liberties. 
(b) REPORT.—In entering into an arrange-
ment under this section, the Director shall 
request that the National Academies trans-
mit to Congress a report on the results of the 
study not later than 12 months after the date

The Child Abuse Prevention and Treat-

U.S.C. 5111 et seq.) is amended by inserting 
after section 201 the following: 
‘‘SEC. 202. REPORT AND GUIDANCE ON UNREGU-
LATED CUSTODY TRANSFERS. 
‘‘(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that: 
‘‘(1) Some adopted children may be at risk 
of experiencing an unregulated custody 
transfer because the challenges associated 
with adoptions (including the child’s mental 
health needs and the difficulties many fami-
lies face in acquiring support services) may 
lead families to seek out unregulated cus-
tody transfers. 
‘‘(2) Some adopted children experience 
trauma, and the disruption and placement in 
another home by unregulated custody trans-
fer creates additional trauma and instability 
for children. 
‘‘(3) Children who experience an unregu-
lated custody transfer may be placed with 
families who have not completed required 
child welfare or criminal background checks 
or clearances. 
‘‘(4) Social services agencies and courts are 
often unaware of the placement of children 
through unregulated custody transfer and 
therefore do not conduct assessments on the 
child’s safety and well-being in such place-
ments. 
‘‘(5) Such lack of placement oversight 
places a child at risk for future abuse and in-
creases the chance that the child may expe-
rience— 
‘‘(A) abuse or neglect; 
‘‘(B) contact with unsafe adults or youth; 
and 
‘‘(C) exposure to unsafe or isolated envi-
ronments. 
‘‘(6) The caregivers with whom a child is 
placed through unregulated custody transfer 
often have no legal responsibility with re-
spect to such child, placing the child at risk 
for additional unregulated custody transfers. 
‘‘(7) Such caregivers also may not have 
complete records with respect to such child, 
including the child’s birth, medical, or immi-
gration records. 
‘‘(8) A child adopted through intercountry 
adoption may be at risk of not acquiring 
United States citizenship if an unregulated 
custody transfer occurs before the adoptive 
parents complete all necessary steps to final-
ize the adoption of such child. 
‘‘(9) Engaging in, or offering to engage in, 
unregulated custody transfer places children 
at risk of harm. 
‘‘(b) REPORT TO CONGRESS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year 
after the date of the enactment of this sec-
tion, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services shall provide to the Committee on 
Education and Labor of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Committee on Ways and 
Means of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee on Finance of the Senate, and 
the Committee on Health, Education, Labor 
and Pensions of the Senate a report on un-
regulated custody transfers of children, in-
cluding of adopted children. 
‘‘(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required under 
paragraph (1) shall include— 
‘‘(A) the causes, methods, and characteris-
tics of unregulated custody transfers, includ-
ing the use of social media and the internet; 
‘‘(B) the effects of unregulated custody 
transfers on children, including the lack of 
assessment of a child’s safety and well-being 
by social services agencies and courts due to 
such unregulated custody transfer; 
‘‘(C) the prevalence of unregulated custody 
transfers within each State and across all 
States; and 
‘‘(D) recommended policies for preventing, 
identifying, and responding to unregulated 
custody transfers, including of adopted chil-
dren, that include— 
‘‘(i) amendments to Federal and State law 
to address unregulated custody transfers; 
‘‘(ii) amendments to child protection prac-
tices to address unregulated custody trans-
fers; and 
‘‘(iii) methods of providing the public in-
formation regarding adoption and child pro-
tection. 
‘‘(c) GUIDANCE TO STATES.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date specified in subsection (b)(1), 
the Secretary shall issue guidance and tech-
nical assistance to States related to pre-
venting, identifying, and responding to un-
regulated custody transfers, including of 
adopted children. 
‘‘(2) ELEMENTS.—The guidance required 
under paragraph (1) shall include— 
‘‘(A) education materials related to pre-
venting, identifying, and responding to un-
regulated custody transfers for employees of 
State, local, and Tribal agencies that pro-
vide child welfare services; 
‘‘(B) guidance on appropriate pre-adoption 
education and post-adoption services for do-
mestic and international adoptive families 
to promote child permanency; and 
‘‘(C) the assistance available through the 
National Resource Center for Special Needs 
Adoption under section 203(b)(9). 
‘‘(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
‘‘(1) STATE.—The term ‘State’ means each 
of the several States, the District of Colum-
bia, and any commonwealth, territory, or 
possession of the United States. 
‘‘(2) UNREGULATED
CUSTODY
TRANSFER.— 
The term ‘unregulated custody transfer’ 
means the abandonment of a child, by the 
child’s parent, legal guardian, or a person or 
entity acting on behalf, and with the con-
sent, of such parent or guardian— 
‘‘(A) by placing a child with a person who 
is not— 
‘‘(i) the child’s parent, step–parent, grand-
parent, adult sibling, legal guardian, or 
other adult relative; 
‘‘(ii) a friend of the family who is an adult 
and with whom the child is familiar; or 
‘‘(iii) a member of the Federally recognized 
Indian tribe of which the child is also a 
member; 
‘‘(B) with the intent of severing the rela-
tionship between the child and the parent or 
guardian of such child; and 
‘‘(C) without— 
‘‘(i) reasonably ensuring the safety of the 
child and permanency of the placement of 
the child, including by conducting an official 
home study, background check, and super-
vision; and 
‘‘(ii) transferring the legal rights and re-
sponsibilities of parenthood or guardianship 
under applicable Federal and State law to a

section (f)) shall be reduced (but not below 
zero) by 5 percent of so much of the tax-
payer’s modified adjusted gross income as

the taxpayer on the return of tax for the tax-
able year. 
‘‘(B) JOINT RETURNS.—In the case of a joint 
return, the $2,400 amount in subsection (b)(1) 
shall be treated as being— 
‘‘(i) zero if the TIN of neither spouse is in-
cluded on the return of tax for the taxable 
year, and 
‘‘(ii) $1,200 if the TIN of only one spouse is 
so included. 
‘‘(C) DEPENDENTS.—A dependent shall not

fund or credit made or allowed under sub-
section (g) with respect to a joint return,

vidual filing such return. 
‘‘(g) ADVANCE REFUNDS AND CREDITS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (5), 
each individual who was an eligible indi-
vidual for such individual’s first taxable year

made a payment against the tax imposed by 
chapter 1 for such taxable year in an amount 
equal to the advance refund amount for such 
taxable year. 
‘‘(2) ADVANCE
REFUND
AMOUNT.—For pur-
poses of paragraph (1), the advance refund 
amount is the amount that would have been 
allowed as a credit under this section for

plied to such taxable year.

based on information provided by the gov-
ernment of the respective possession.

as being equal to the aggregate benefits (if 
any) that would have been provided to resi-
dents of such possession by reason of the 
amendments made by this section if a mirror 
code tax system had been in effect in such 
possession. The preceding sentence shall not 
apply unless the respective possession has a 
plan, which has been approved by the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, under which such 
possession will promptly distribute such pay-
ments to its residents.

(4) MIRROR
CODE

SYSTEM.—For pur-
poses of this subsection, the term ‘‘mirror

sion under such system is determined by ref-
erence to the income tax laws of the United 
States as if such possession were the United 
States.

plan’s application for special partition under

that the application is incomplete or the 
plan is not eligible under this section. A spe-
cial partition order issued by the corporation 
shall be effective no later than 120 days after

extent of a reduction in accordance with sec-
tion 305(e)(8) adopted prior to the plan’s ap-
plication for partition under this section).

poration shall adjust the special partition 
assistance described in subsection (e) as nec-
essary for the eligible multiemployer plan to 
satisfy the funding goals described in sub-

years.

ble multiemployer plan that is the subject of

tioned under section (a) relating to increases

A MULTIEMPLOYER 
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a de-
fined benefit plan that is a multiemployer 
plan may, subject to paragraph (2), amend 
the plan to incorporate the features of a 
composite plan as a component of the multi-
employer plan separate from the defined ben-
efit plan component, except in the case of a 
defined benefit plan for which the plan actu-
ary has certified under section 305(b)(3) that 
the plan is or will be in critical status for 
the plan year in which such amendment 
would become effective or for any of the suc-
ceeding 5 plan years. 
‘‘(2) REQUIREMENTS.—Any amendment pur-
suant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the fea-
tures of a composite plan as a component of 
a multiemployer plan shall— 
‘‘(A) apply with respect to all collective 
bargaining agreements providing for con-
tributions to the multiemployer plan on or 
after the effective date of the amendment;

tributions are made to the multiemployer 
plan on or after the effective date of the 
amendment;

amendment is— 
‘‘(i) the first day of a specified plan year 
following the date of the adoption of the 
amendment, except that the plan sponsor

fective date with respect to each collective 
bargaining agreement under which contribu-
tions to the multiemployer plan are re-
quired, which shall occur on the first day of 
the first plan year beginning after the termi-

sor of the multiemployer plan shall agree to; 
and 
‘‘(ii) not later than the first day of the 
fifth plan year beginning on or after the date 
of the adoption of the amendment; 
‘‘(D) specify that, as of the amendment’s 
effective date, no further benefits shall ac-
crue under the defined benefit component of 
the multiemployer plan; and 
‘‘(E) specify that, as of the amendment’s 
effective date, the plan sponsor of the multi-
employer plan shall be the plan sponsor of 
both the composite plan component and the 
defined benefit plan component of the plan. 
‘‘(3) SPECIAL
RULES.—If a multiemployer 
plan is amended pursuant to paragraph (1)— 
‘‘(A) the requirements of this title and 
title IV shall be applied to the composite 
plan component and the defined benefit plan

separate plan; and

ponent and the defined benefit plan compo-
nent of the plan shall be held in a single 
trust forming part of the plan under which 
the trust instrument expressly provides—

records) to be maintained to reflect the in-
terest which each of the plan components 
has in the trust, including separate account-
ing for additions to the trust for the benefit 
of each plan component, disbursements made 
from each plan component’s account in the 
trust, investment experience of the trust al-
locable to that account, and administrative 
expenses (whether direct expenses or shared 
expenses allocated proportionally), and per-
mits, but does not require, the pooling of 
some or all of the assets of the two plan com-
ponents for investment purposes; and 
‘‘(ii) that the assets of each of the two plan 
components shall be held, invested, rein-
vested, managed, administered and distrib-
uted for the exclusive benefit of the partici-
pants and beneficiaries of each such plan 
component, and in no event shall the assets 
of one of the plan components be available to 
pay benefits due under the other plan compo-
nent. 
‘‘(4) NOT A TERMINATION EVENT.—Notwith-
standing section 4041A, an amendment pur-
suant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the fea-
tures of a composite plan as a component of 
a multiemployer plan does not constitute 
termination of the multiemployer plan. 
‘‘(5) NOTICE TO THE SECRETARY.— 
‘‘(A) NOTICE.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall provide notice to the Sec-
retary of the intent to establish the com-
posite plan (or, in the case of a composite

posite plan incorporated as a component of a 
multiemployer plan as described in para-
graph (1), such notice shall include a certifi-
cation by the plan actuary under section 
305(b)(3) that the effective date of the amend-
ment occurs in a plan year for which the 
multiemployer plan is not in critical status 
for that plan year and any of the succeeding 
5 plan years.

NENT.—As used in this part, the term ‘com-
posite plan’ includes a composite plan com-
ponent added to a defined benefit plan pursu-
ant to paragraph (1). 
‘‘(7) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph 
(2)(A) shall not be construed as preventing 
the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan 
from adopting an amendment pursuant to 
paragraph (1) because some collective bar-
gaining agreements are amended to cease 
any covered employer’s obligation to con-
tribute to the multiemployer plan before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. Para-
graph (2)(B) shall not be construed as pre-
venting the plan sponsor of a multiemployer 
plan from adopting an amendment pursuant 
to paragraph (1) because some participants 
cease to have contributions made to the mul-
tiemployer plan on their behalf before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. 
‘‘(c) COORDINATION WITH FUNDING RULES.— 
Except as otherwise provided in this title, 
sections 302, 304, and 305 shall not apply to a 
composite plan. 
‘‘(d) TREATMENT
OF
A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
For purposes of this Act (other than sections 
302 and 4245), a composite plan shall be treat-
ed as if it were a defined benefit plan unless 
a different treatment is provided for under 
applicable law.

TIONS. 
‘‘(a) CERTIFICATION OF FUNDED RATIOS.—

posite plan shall certify to the Secretary, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, and the plan 
sponsor the plan’s current funded ratio and 
projected funded ratio for the plan year. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
CURRENT
FUNDED 
RATIO
AND
PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—For 
purposes of this section: 
‘‘(A) CURRENT FUNDED RATIO.—The current 
funded ratio is the ratio (expressed as a per-
centage) of— 
‘‘(i) the value of the plan’s assets as of the 
first day of the plan year; to 
‘‘(ii) the plan actuary’s best estimate of 
the present value of the plan liabilities as of 
the first day of the plan year. 
‘‘(B) PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—The pro-
jected funded ratio is the current funded 
ratio projected to the first day of the fif-
teenth plan year following the plan year for 
which the determination is being made. 
‘‘(3) CONSIDERATION OF CONTRIBUTION RATE 
INCREASES.—For 
purposes 
of 
projections 
under this subsection, the plan sponsor may 
anticipate contribution rate increases be-
yond the term of the current collective bar-
gaining agreement and any agreed-to supple-
ments, up to a maximum of 2.5 percent per 
year, compounded annually, unless it would 
be unreasonable under the circumstances to 
assume that contributions would increase by 
that amount. 
‘‘(b) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS
AND METH-
ODS.—For purposes of this part: 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—All costs, liabilities, 
rates of interest and other factors under the

CERTAIN
CONTRIBUTIONS 
DEEMED MADE.—Any contributions for a plan 
year made by an employer after the last day

‘‘SEC. 803. REALIGNMENT PROGRAM. 
‘‘(a) REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(1) ADOPTION.—In any case in which the 
plan actuary certifies under section 802(a) 
that the plan’s projected funded ratio is 
below 120 percent for the plan year, the plan 
sponsor shall adopt a realignment program 
under paragraph (2) not later than 210 days 
after the due date of the certification re-
quired under such section 802(a). The plan 
sponsor shall adopt an updated realignment 
program for each succeeding plan year for 
which a certification described in the pre-
ceding sentence is made. 
‘‘(2) CONTENT OF REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—A realignment program 
adopted under this paragraph is a written 
program which consists of all reasonable 
measures, including options or a range of op-
tions to be undertaken by the plan sponsor 
or proposed to the bargaining parties, formu-
lated, based on reasonably anticipated expe-
rience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, 
to enable the plan to achieve a projected 
funded ratio of at least 120 percent for the 
following plan year. 
‘‘(B) INITIAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—Reason-
able measures under a realignment program 
described in subparagraph (A) may include 
any of the following: 
‘‘(i) Proposed contribution increases. 
‘‘(ii) A reduction in the rate of future ben-
efit accruals, so long as the resulting rate is 
not less than 1 percent of the contributions 
on which benefits are based as of the start of 
the plan year (or the equivalent standard ac-
crual rate as described in section 305(e)(6)). 
‘‘(iii) A modification or elimination of ad-
justable benefits of participants that are not 
in pay status before the date of the notice re-
quired under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(iv) Any other lawfully available meas-
ures not specifically described in this sub-
paragraph or subparagraph (C) or (D) that 
the plan sponsor determines are reasonable. 
‘‘(C) ADDITIONAL
PROGRAM
ELEMENTS.—If 
the plan sponsor has determined that all rea-
sonable measures available under subpara-
graph (B) will not enable the plan to achieve 
a projected funded ratio of at least 120 per-
cent for the following plan year, such reason-
able measures may also include— 
‘‘(i) a reduction of accrued benefits that 
are not in pay status by the date of the no-
tice required under subsection (b)(1); or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of any benefits of partici-
pants that are in pay status before the date 
of the notice required under subsection (b)(1) 
other than core benefits as defined in para-
graph (4). 
‘‘(D) ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS.—In the case 
of a composite plan for which the plan spon-
sor has determined that all reasonable meas-
ures available under subparagraphs (B) and 
(C) will not enable the plan to achieve a pro-
jected funded ratio of at least 120 percent for 
the following plan year, such reasonable 
measures may also include— 
‘‘(i) a further reduction in the rate of fu-
ture benefit accruals without regard to the 
limitation applicable under subparagraph 
(B)(ii); or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of core benefits; 
provided that such reductions shall be equi-
tably distributed across the participant and 
beneficiary population, taking into account 
factors, with respect to participants and 
beneficiaries and their benefits, that may in-
clude one or more of the factors listed in 
subclauses 
(I) 
through 
(X) 
of 
section 
305(e)(9)(D)(vi), to the extent necessary to en-
able the plan to achieve a projected funded 
ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year, or at the election of the plan spon-
sor, a projected funded ratio of at least 100 
percent for the following plan year and a 
current funded ratio of at least 90 percent. 
‘‘(3) ADJUSTABLE
BENEFIT
DEFINED.—For 
purposes of this part, the term ‘adjustable 
benefit’ means— 
‘‘(A) benefits, rights, and features under 
the plan, including post-retirement death 
benefits, 60-month guarantees, disability 
benefits not yet in pay status, and similar 
benefits; 
‘‘(B) any early retirement benefit or retire-
ment-type subsidy (within the meaning of 
section 204(g)(2)(A)) and any benefit payment 
option (other than the qualified joint and 
survivor annuity); and 
‘‘(C) benefit increases that were adopted 
(or, if later, took effect) less than 60 months 
before the first day such realignment pro-
gram took effect. 
‘‘(4) CORE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For purposes 
of this part, the term ‘core benefit’ means a 
participant’s accrued benefit payable in the 
normal form of an annuity commencing at 
normal retirement age, determined without 
regard to— 
‘‘(A) any early retirement benefits, retire-
ment-type 
subsidies, 
or 
other 
benefits, 
rights, or features that may be associated 
with that benefit; and 
‘‘(B) any cost-of-living adjustments or ben-
efit increases effective after the date of re-
tirement. 
‘‘(5) COORDINATION
WITH
CONTRIBUTION
IN-
CREASES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—A realignment program 
may provide that some or all of the benefit 
modifications described in the program will 
only take effect if the bargaining parties fail 
to agree to specified levels of increases in 
contributions to the plan, effective as of 
specified dates. 
‘‘(B) 
INDEPENDENT
BENEFIT
MODIFICA-
TIONS.—If a realignment program adopts any 
changes to the benefit formula that are inde-
pendent of potential contribution increases, 
such changes shall take effect not later than 
180 days after the first day of the first plan 
year that begins following the adoption of 
the realignment program. 
‘‘(C) CONDITIONAL BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes 
to the benefit formula that take effect only 
if the bargaining parties fail to agree to con-
tribution increases, such changes shall take 
effect not later than the first day of the first 
plan year beginning after the third anniver-
sary of the date of adoption of the realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(D) REVOCATION OF CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Benefit modifications described 
in subparagraph (C) may be revoked, in 
whole or in part, and retroactively or pro-
spectively, when contributions to the plan 
are increased, as specified in the realignment 
program, including any amendments thereto. 
The preceding sentence shall not apply un-
less the contribution increases are to be ef-
fective not later than the fifth anniversary 
of the first day of the first plan year that be-
gins after the adoption of the realignment 
program. 
‘‘(b) NOTICE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which it is 
certified under section 802(a) that the pro-
jected funded ratio is less than 120 percent, 
the plan sponsor shall, not later than 30 days 
after the date of the certification, provide 
notification of the current and projected 
funded ratios to the participants and bene-
ficiaries, the bargaining parties, and the Sec-
retary. Such notice shall include—

increases or benefit reductions may be nec-
essary; 
‘‘(B) a description of the types of benefits 
that might be reduced; and

creases and benefit reductions that may be 
necessary to achieve a projected funded ratio 
of 120 percent. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—No modifications may 
be made that reduce the rate of future ben-
efit accrual or that reduce core benefits or 
adjustable benefits unless notice of such re-
duction has been given at least 180 days be-
fore the general effective date of such reduc-
tion for all participants and beneficiaries 
to— 
‘‘(i) plan participants and beneficiaries; 
‘‘(ii) each employer who has an obligation 
to contribute to the composite plan; and 
‘‘(iii) each employee organization which,

‘‘SEC. 804. LIMITATION ON INCREASING BENE-
FITS. 
‘‘(a) LEVEL OF CURRENT FUNDED RATIOS.— 
Except as provided in subsections (c), (d), 
and (e), no plan amendment increasing bene-
fits or establishing new benefits under a 
composite plan may be adopted for a plan 
year unless— 
‘‘(1) the plan’s current funded ratio is at 
least 110 percent (without regard to the ben-
efit increase or new benefits); 
‘‘(2) taking the benefit increase or new ben-
efits into account, the current funded ratio 
is at least 100 percent and the projected fund-
ed ratio for the current plan year is at least 
120 percent; 
‘‘(3) in any case in which, after taking the 
benefit increase or new benefits into ac-
count, the current funded ratio is less than 
140 percent and the projected funded ratio is 
less than 140 percent, the benefit increase or 
new benefits are projected by the plan actu-
ary to increase the present value of the 
plan’s liabilities for the plan year by not 
more than 3 percent; and 
‘‘(4) expected contributions for the current 
plan year are at least 120 percent of normal 
cost for the plan year, determined using the 
unit credit funding method and treating the 
benefit increase or new benefits as in effect 
for the entire plan year. 
‘‘(b) 
ADDITIONAL
REQUIREMENTS
WHERE 
CORE BENEFITS REDUCED.—If a plan has been 
amended to reduce core benefits pursuant to 
a 
realignment 
program 
under 
section 
803(a)(2)(D), such plan may not be subse-
quently amended to increase core benefits 
unless the amendment— 
‘‘(1) increases the level of future benefit 
payments only; and 
‘‘(2) provides for an equitable distribution 
of benefit increases across the participant 
and beneficiary population, taking into ac-
count the extent to which the benefits of 
participants were previously reduced pursu-
ant to such realignment program. 
‘‘(c) EXCEPTION TO COMPLY WITH APPLICA-
BLE LAW.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in 
connection with a plan amendment if the 
amendment is required as a condition of 
qualification under part I of subchapter D of 
chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 or to comply with other applicable law. 
‘‘(d) EXCEPTION WHERE MAXIMUM DEDUCT-
IBLE LIMIT APPLIES.—Subsection (a) shall not 
apply in connection with a plan amendment 
if and to the extent that contributions to the 
composite plan would not be deductible for 
the plan year under section 404(a)(1)(E) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if the plan 
amendment is not adopted. 
‘‘(e) EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in 
connection with a plan amendment under 
section 803(a)(5)(C), regarding conditional 
benefit modifications. 
‘‘(f) TREATMENT
OF PLAN AMENDMENTS.— 
For purposes of this section— 
‘‘(1) if two or more plan amendments in-
creasing benefits or establishing new bene-
fits are adopted in a plan year, such amend-
ments shall be treated as a single amend-
ment adopted on the last day of the plan 
year; 
‘‘(2) all benefit increases and new benefits 
adopted in a single amendment are treated 
as a single benefit increase, irrespective of 
whether the increases and new benefits take 
effect in more than one plan year; and 
‘‘(3) increases in contributions or decreases 
in plan liabilities which are scheduled to 
take effect in future plan years may be 
taken into account in connection with a plan 
amendment if they have been agreed to in 
writing or otherwise formalized by the date 
the plan amendment is adopted. 
‘‘SEC. 805. COMPOSITE PLAN RESTRICTIONS TO 
PRESERVE LEGACY PLAN FUNDING. 
‘‘(a) TREATMENT AS A LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this part 
and parts 2 and 3, a defined benefit plan shall 
be treated as a legacy plan with respect to 
the composite plan under which the employ-
ees who were eligible to accrue a benefit 
under the defined benefit plan become eligi-
ble to accrue a benefit under such composite 
plan. 
‘‘(2) COMPONENT
PLANS.—In any case in 
which a defined benefit plan is amended to 
add a composite plan component pursuant to 
section 801(b), paragraph (1) shall be applied 
by substituting ‘defined benefit component’ 
for ‘defined benefit plan’ and ‘composite plan 
component’ for ‘composite plan’. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE
TO
ACCRUE
A
BENEFIT.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is 
considered eligible to accrue a benefit under 
a composite plan as of the first day in which 
the employee completes an hour of service 
under a collective bargaining agreement 
that provides for contributions to and accru-
als under the composite plan in lieu of accru-
als under the legacy plan. 
‘‘(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.— 
As used in this part, the term ‘collective bar-
gaining agreement’ includes any agreement 
under which an employer has an obligation 
to contribute to a plan. 
‘‘(5) OTHER TERMS.—Any term used in this 
part which is not defined in this part and 
which is also used in section 305 shall have 
the same meaning provided such term in 
such section. 
‘‘(b) RESTRICTIONS ON ACCEPTANCE BY COM-
POSITE PLAN OF AGREEMENTS AND CONTRIBU-
TIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a 
composite plan shall not accept or recognize 
a collective bargaining agreement (or any 
modification to such agreement), and no con-
tributions may be accepted and no benefits 
may be accrued or otherwise earned under 
the agreement— 
‘‘(A) in any case in which the plan actuary 
of any defined benefit plan that would be 
treated as a legacy plan with respect to such 
composite plan has certified under section 
305(b)(3) that such defined benefit plan is or 
will be in critical status for the plan year in 
which such agreement would take effect or 
for any of the succeeding 5 plan years; and 
‘‘(B) unless the agreement requires each 
employer who is a party to such agreement, 
including employers whose employees are 
not participants in the legacy plan, to pro-
vide contributions to the legacy plan with 
respect to such composite plan in a manner 
that satisfies the transition contribution re-
quirements of subsection (d). 
‘‘(2) NOTICE.—Not later than 30 days after a 
determination by a plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan that an agreement fails to satisfy 
the requirements described in paragraph (1), 
the plan sponsor shall provide notification of 
such failure and the reasons for such deter-
mination— 
‘‘(A) to the parties to the agreement; 
‘‘(B) to active participants of the com-
posite plan who have ceased to accrue or oth-
erwise earn benefits with respect to service 
with an employer pursuant to paragraph (1); 
and 
‘‘(C) to the Secretary, the Secretary of the 
Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation. 
‘‘(3) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits 
accrued before the date on which notice is 
provided under paragraph (2). 
‘‘(c) RESTRICTION ON ACCRUAL OF BENEFITS 
UNDER A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which an 
employer, under a collective bargaining 
agreement entered into after the date of en-
actment of the Giving Retirement Options to 
Workers Act of 2020, ceases to have an obli-
gation to contribute to a multiemployer de-
fined benefit plan, no employees employed 
by the employer may accrue or otherwise 
earn benefits under any composite plan, with 
respect to service with that employer, for a 
60-month period beginning on the date on 
which the employer entered into such collec-
tive bargaining agreement. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.— 
Within 30 days of determining that an em-
ployer has ceased to have an obligation to 
contribute to a legacy plan with respect to 
employees employed by an employer that is 
or will be contributing to a composite plan 
with respect to service of such employees, 
the plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall no-
tify the plan sponsor of the composite plan 
of that cessation. 
‘‘(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.— 
Not later than 30 days after determining 
that an employer has ceased to have an obli-
gation to contribute to a legacy plan, the 
plan sponsor of the composite plan shall no-
tify the bargaining parties, the active par-
ticipants affected by the cessation of accru-
als, the Secretary, the Secretary of the 
Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation of the cessation of accruals, the 
period during which such cessation is in ef-
fect, and the reasons therefor. 
‘‘(4) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits 
accrued before the date on which notice is 
provided under paragraph (3). 
‘‘(d) TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION
REQUIRE-
MENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A collective bargaining 
agreement satisfies the transition contribu-
tion requirements of this subsection if the 
agreement— 
‘‘(A) authorizes payment of contributions 
to a legacy plan at a rate or rates equal to 
or greater than the transition contribution 
rate established by the legacy plan under 
paragraph (2); and 
‘‘(B) does not provide for— 
‘‘(i) a suspension of contributions to the 
legacy plan with respect to any period of 
service; or 
‘‘(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of 
younger or newly hired employees of the em-
ployer from being taken into account in de-
termining contributions owed to the legacy 
plan. 
‘‘(2) TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The transition contribu-
tion rate for a plan year is the contribution 
rate that, as certified by the actuary of the 
legacy plan in accordance with the principles 
in section 305(b)(3)(B), is reasonably expected 
to be adequate— 
‘‘(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan 
year; 
‘‘(ii) to amortize the plan’s unfunded liabil-
ities in level annual installments over 25 
years, beginning with the plan year in which 
the transition contribution rate is first es-
tablished; and 
‘‘(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes 
in the legacy plan’s unfunded liability due to 
experience gains or losses (including invest-
ment gains or losses, gains or losses due to 
contributions greater or less than the con-
tributions made under the prior transition 
contribution rate, and other actuarial gains 
or losses), changes in actuarial assumptions, 
changes to the legacy plan’s benefits, or 
changes in funding method over a period of 
15 plan years beginning with the plan year in 
which such change in unfunded liability is 
incurred.

S6168 
October 19, 2020 
The transition contribution rate for any plan 
year may not be less than the transition con-
tribution rate for the plan year in which 
such rate is first established. 
‘‘(B) MULTIPLE RATES.—If different rates of 
contribution are payable to the legacy plan 
by different employers or for different class-
es of employees, the certification shall speci-
fy a transition contribution rate for each 
such employer. 
‘‘(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided by 
clause (ii), the transition contribution rate 
applicable to an employer for a plan year is 
the rate in effect for the plan year of the leg-
acy plan that commences on or after 180 days 
before the earlier of— 
‘‘(I) the effective date of the collective bar-
gaining agreement pursuant to which the 
employer contributes to the legacy plan; or 
‘‘(II) 5 years after the last plan year for 
which the transition contribution rate appli-
cable to the employer was established or up-
dated. 
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—The transition contribu-
tion rate applicable to an employer for the 
first plan year beginning on or after the 
commencement of the employer’s obligation 
to contribute to the composite plan is the 
rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy 
plan that commences on or after 180 days be-
fore such first plan year. 
‘‘(D) EFFECT OF LEGACY PLAN FINANCIAL CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—If the plan actuary of the leg-
acy plan has certified under section 305 that 
the plan is in endangered or critical status 
for a plan year, the transition contribution 
rate for the following plan year is the rate 
determined with respect to the employer 
under the legacy plan’s funding improvement 
or rehabilitation plan under section 305, if 
greater than the rate otherwise determined, 
but in no event greater than 75 percent of the 
sum of the contribution rates applicable to 
the legacy plan and the composite plan for 
the plan year. 
‘‘(E) OTHER
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND 
METHODS.—Except as provided in subpara-
graph (A), the determination of the transi-
tion contribution rate for a plan year shall 
be based on actuarial assumptions and meth-
ods consistent with the minimum funding 
determinations made under section 304 (or, if 
applicable, section 305) with respect to the 
legacy plan for the plan year. 
‘‘(F) ADJUSTMENTS
IN
RATE.—The plan 
sponsor of a legacy plan from time to time 
may adjust the transition contribution rate 
or rates applicable to an employer under this 
paragraph by increasing some rates and de-
creasing others if the actuary certifies that 
such adjusted rates in combination will 
produce projected contribution income for 
the plan year beginning on or after the date 
of certification that is not less than would be 
produced by the transition contribution 
rates in effect at the time of the certifi-
cation. 
‘‘(G) NOTICE
OF
TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION 
RATE.—The plan sponsor of a legacy plan 
shall provide notice to the parties to collec-
tive bargaining agreements pursuant to 
which contributions are made to the legacy 
plan of changes to the transition contribu-
tion rate requirements at least 30 days be-
fore the beginning of the plan year for which 
the rate is effective. 
‘‘(H) NOTICE TO COMPOSITE PLAN SPONSOR.— 
Not later than 30 days after a determination 
by the plan sponsor of a legacy plan that a 
collective bargaining agreement provides for 
a rate of contributions that is below the 
transition contribution rate applicable to 
one or more employers that are parties to 
the collective bargaining agreement, the 
plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall notify 
the plan sponsor of any composite plan under 
which employees of such employer would 
otherwise be eligible to accrue a benefit. 
‘‘(3) CORRECTION PROCEDURES.—Pursuant to 
standards prescribed by the Secretary, the 
plan sponsor of a composite plan shall adopt 
rules and procedures that give the parties to 
the collective bargaining agreement notice 
of the failure of such agreement to satisfy 
the transition contribution requirements of 
this subsection, and a reasonable oppor-
tunity to correct such failure, not to exceed 
180 days from the date of notice given under 
subsection (b)(2). 
‘‘(4) SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS.—A col-
lective bargaining agreement may provide 
for supplemental contributions to the legacy 
plan for a plan year in excess of the transi-
tion contribution rate determined under 
paragraph (2), regardless of whether the leg-
acy plan is in endangered or critical status 
for such plan year. 
‘‘(e) NONAPPLICATION
OF COMPOSITE PLAN 
RESTRICTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The provisions of sub-
sections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply with 
respect to a collective bargaining agreement, 
to the extent the agreement, or a prede-
cessor agreement, provides or provided for 
contributions to a defined benefit plan that 
is a legacy plan, as of the first day of the 
first plan year following a plan year for 
which the plan actuary certifies that the 
plan is fully funded, has been fully funded for 
at least three out of the immediately pre-
ceding 5 plan years, and is projected to re-
main fully funded for at least the following 
4 plan years. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION OF FULLY FUNDED.—A 
plan is fully funded for purposes of paragraph 
(1) if, as of the valuation date of the plan for 
a plan year, the value of the plan’s assets 
equals or exceeds the present value of the 
plan’s liabilities, determined in accordance 
with the rules prescribed by the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation under sections 
4219(c)(1)(D) and 4281 for multiemployer 
plans terminating by mass withdrawal, as in 
effect for the date of the determination, ex-
cept the plan’s reasonable assumption re-
garding the starting date of benefits may be 
used. 
‘‘(3) OTHER APPLICABLE RULES.—Except as 
provided in paragraph (2), actuarial deter-
minations and projections under this section 
shall be based on the rules in section 305(b)(3)

COMPOSITE PLANS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Assets and liabilities of 
a composite plan may only be merged with, 
or transferred to, another plan if— 
‘‘(1) the other plan is a composite plan; 
‘‘(2) the plan or plans resulting from the 
merger or transfer is a composite plan; 
‘‘(3) no participant’s accrued benefit or ad-
justable benefit is lower immediately after 
the transaction than it was immediately be-
fore the transaction; and 
‘‘(4) the value of the assets transferred in 
the case of a transfer reasonably reflects the 
value of the amounts contributed with re-
spect to the participants whose benefits are 
being transferred, adjusted for allocable dis-
tributions, investment gains and losses, and 
administrative expenses. 
‘‘(b) LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—After a merger or trans-
fer involving a composite plan, the legacy 
plan with respect to an employer that is ob-
ligated to contribute to the resulting com-
posite plan is the legacy plan that applied to 
that employer immediately before the merg-
er or transfer. 
‘‘(2) MULTIPLE
LEGACY
PLANS.—If an em-
ployer is obligated to contribute to more 
than one legacy plan with respect to employ-
ees eligible to accrue benefits under more 
than one composite plan and there is a merg-
er or transfer of such legacy plans, the tran-
sition contribution rate applicable to the 
legacy plan resulting from the merger or 
transfer with respect to that employer shall 
be determined in accordance with the provi-
sions of section 805(d)(2)(B).’’.

gram under that section by the deadline es-
tablished in such section; or 
‘‘(B) fails to update or comply with the 
terms of the realignment program in accord-
ance with the requirements of such section, 
by the Secretary, by an employer that has an 
obligation to contribute with respect to the 
composite plan, or by an employee organiza-
tion that represents active participants in

gram, or to update or comply with the terms 
of the realignment program, in accordance 
with the requirements of such section and 
the realignment program.’’. 
(B) CIVIL PENALTIES.—Section 502(c) of such

alty of not more than $1,100 per day for each 
violation by such sponsor— 
‘‘(A) of the requirement under section 
802(a) on the plan actuary to certify the 
plan’s current or projected funded ratio by 
the date specified in such subsection; or 
‘‘(B) of the requirement under section 803 
to adopt a realignment program by the dead-

any plan sponsor of a composite plan a civil 
penalty of not more than $100 per day for 
each violation by such sponsor of the re-
quirement under section 803(b) to provide no-
tice as described in such section, except that 
no penalty may be assessed in any case in 
which the plan sponsor exercised reasonable 
diligence to meet the requirements of such 
section and— 
‘‘(i) the plan sponsor did not know that the 
violation existed; or 
‘‘(ii) the plan sponsor provided such notice 
during the 30-day period beginning on the 
first date on which the plan sponsor knew, or 
in exercising reasonable due diligence should 
have known, that such violation existed. 
‘‘(B) In any case in which the plan sponsor 
exercised reasonable diligence to meet the 
requirements of section 803(b)—

title, the term ‘composite plan’ means a pen-
sion plan— 
‘‘(1) which is a multiemployer plan that is 
neither a defined benefit plan nor a defined 
contribution plan, 
‘‘(2) the terms of which provide that the 
plan is a composite plan for purposes of this 
title with respect to which not more than 
one multiemployer defined benefit plan is 
treated as a legacy plan within the meaning 
of section 440A, unless there is more than 
one legacy plan following a merger of com-
posite plans under section 440B, 
‘‘(3) which provides systematically for the 
payment of benefits— 
‘‘(A) objectively calculated pursuant to a 
formula enumerated in the plan document 
with respect to plan participants after re-
tirement, for life, and

plan years, and 
‘‘(6) the board of trustees of which includes 
at least one retiree or beneficiary in pay sta-
tus during each plan year following the first 
plan year in which at least 5 percent of the 
participants in the plan are retirees or bene-
ficiaries in pay status. 
‘‘(b) TRANSITION FROM
A MULTIEMPLOYER 
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a de-
fined benefit plan that is a multiemployer 
plan may, subject to paragraph (2), amend 
the plan to incorporate the features of a 
composite plan as a component of the multi-
employer plan separate from the defined ben-
efit plan component, except in the case of a 
defined benefit plan for which the plan actu-
ary has certified under section 432(b)(3) that 
the plan is or will be in critical status for 
the plan year in which such amendment 
would become effective or for any of the suc-
ceeding 5 plan years. 
‘‘(2) REQUIREMENTS.—Any amendment pur-
suant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the fea-
tures of a composite plan as a component of 
a multiemployer plan shall— 
‘‘(A) apply with respect to all collective 
bargaining agreements providing for con-
tributions to the multiemployer plan on or 
after the effective date of the amendment, 
‘‘(B) apply with respect to all participants 
in the multiemployer plan for whom con-
tributions are made to the multiemployer 
plan on or after the effective date of the 
amendment, 
‘‘(C) specify that the effective date of the 
amendment is— 
‘‘(i) the first day of a specified plan year 
following the date of the adoption of the 
amendment, except that the plan sponsor 
may alternatively provide for a separate ef-
fective date with respect to each collective 
bargaining agreement under which contribu-
tions to the multiemployer plan are re-
quired, which shall occur on the first day of 
the first plan year beginning after the termi-
nation, or if earlier, the re-opening, of each 
such agreement, or such earlier date as the 
parties to the agreement and the plan spon-
sor of the multiemployer plan shall agree to, 
and 
‘‘(ii) not later than the first day of the 
fifth plan year beginning on or after the date 
of the adoption of the amendment, 
‘‘(D) specify that, as of the amendment’s 
effective date, no further benefits shall ac-
crue under the defined benefit component of 
the multiemployer plan, and 
‘‘(E) specify that, as of the amendment’s 
effective date, the plan sponsor of the multi-
employer plan shall be the plan sponsor of 
both the composite plan component and the 
defined benefit plan component of the plan. 
‘‘(3) SPECIAL
RULES.—If a multiemployer 
plan is amended pursuant to paragraph (1)— 
‘‘(A) the requirements of this title shall be 
applied to the composite plan component 
and the defined benefit plan component of 
the multiemployer plan as if each such com-
ponent were maintained as a separate plan, 
and 
‘‘(B) the assets of the composite plan com-
ponent and the defined benefit plan compo-
nent of the plan shall be held in a single 
trust forming part of the plan under which 
the trust instrument expressly provides— 
‘‘(i) for separate accounts (and appropriate 
records) to be maintained to reflect the in-
terest which each of the plan components 
has in the trust, including separate account-
ing for additions to the trust for the benefit 
of each plan component, disbursements made 
from each plan component’s account in the 
trust, investment experience of the trust al-
locable to that account, and administrative 
expenses (whether direct expenses or shared 
expenses allocated proportionally), and per-
mits, but does not require, the pooling of 
some or all of the assets of the two plan com-
ponents for investment purposes, and 
‘‘(ii) that the assets of each of the two plan 
components shall be held, invested, rein-
vested, managed, administered and distrib-
uted for the exclusive benefit of the partici-
pants and beneficiaries of each such plan 
component, and in no event shall the assets 
of one of the plan components be available to 
pay benefits due under the other plan compo-
nent. 
‘‘(4) NOT A TERMINATION EVENT.—Notwith-
standing section 4041A of the Employee Re-
tirement Income Security Act of 1974, an 
amendment pursuant to paragraph (1) to in-
corporate the features of a composite plan as 
a component of a multiemployer plan does 
not constitute termination of the multiem-
ployer plan. 
‘‘(5) NOTICE TO THE SECRETARY.— 
‘‘(A) NOTICE.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall provide notice to the Sec-
retary of the intent to establish the com-
posite plan (or, in the case of a composite 
plan incorporated as a component of a multi-
employer plan as described in paragraph (1), 
the intent to amend the multiemployer plan 
to incorporate such composite plan) at least 
30 days prior to the effective date of such es-
tablishment or amendment. 
‘‘(B) CERTIFICATION.—In the case of a com-
posite plan incorporated as a component of a 
multiemployer plan as described in para-
graph (1), such notice shall include a certifi-
cation by the plan actuary under section 
432(b)(3) that the effective date of the amend-
ment occurs in a plan year for which the 
multiemployer plan is not in critical status 
for that plan year and any of the succeeding 
5 plan years. 
‘‘(6) REFERENCES TO COMPOSITE PLAN COMPO-
NENT.—As used in this subpart, the term 
‘composite plan’ includes a composite plan 
component added to a defined benefit plan 
pursuant to paragraph (1). 
‘‘(7) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph 
(2)(A) shall not be construed as preventing 
the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan 
from adopting an amendment pursuant to 
paragraph (1) because some collective bar-
gaining agreements are amended to cease 
any covered employer’s obligation to con-
tribute to the multiemployer plan before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. Para-
graph (2)(B) shall not be construed as pre-
venting the plan sponsor of a multiemployer 
plan from adopting an amendment pursuant 
to paragraph (1) because some participants 
cease to have contributions made to the mul-
tiemployer plan on their behalf before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. 
‘‘(c) COORDINATION WITH FUNDING RULES.— 
Except as otherwise provided in this title, 
sections 412, 431, and 432 shall not apply to a 
composite plan. 
‘‘(d) TREATMENT
OF
A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
For purposes of this title (other than sec-
tions 412 and 418E), a composite plan shall be 
treated as if it were a defined benefit plan 
unless a different treatment is provided for 
under applicable law. 
‘‘SEC. 438. FUNDED RATIOS; ACTUARIAL ASSUMP-
TIONS. 
‘‘(a) CERTIFICATION OF FUNDED RATIOS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than the one- 
hundred twentieth day of each plan year of a 
composite plan, the plan actuary of the com-
posite plan shall certify to the Secretary, 
the Secretary of Labor, and the plan sponsor 
the plan’s current funded ratio and projected 
funded ratio for the plan year. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
CURRENT
FUNDED 
RATIO
AND
PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—For 
purposes of this section— 
‘‘(A) CURRENT FUNDED RATIO.—The current 
funded ratio is the ratio (expressed as a per-
centage) of— 
‘‘(i) the value of the plan’s assets as of the 
first day of the plan year, to 
‘‘(ii) the plan actuary’s best estimate of 
the present value of the plan liabilities as of 
the first day of the plan year.

‘‘(B) PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—The pro-
jected funded ratio is the current funded 
ratio projected to the first day of the fif-
teenth plan year following the plan year for 
which the determination is being made. 
‘‘(3) CONSIDERATION OF CONTRIBUTION RATE 
INCREASES.—For 
purposes 
of 
projections 
under this subsection, the plan sponsor may 
anticipate contribution rate increases be-
yond the term of the current collective bar-
gaining agreement and any agreed-to supple-
ments, up to a maximum of 2.5 percent per 
year, compounded annually, unless it would 
be unreasonable under the circumstances to 
assume that contributions would increase by 
that amount. 
‘‘(b) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS
AND METH-
ODS.—For purposes of this part— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—All costs, liabilities, 
rates of interest, and other factors under the 
plan shall be determined for a plan year on 
the basis of actuarial assumptions and meth-
ods— 
‘‘(A) each of which is reasonable (taking 
into account the experience of the plan and 
reasonable expectations), 
‘‘(B) which, in combination, offer the actu-
ary’s best estimate of anticipated experience 
under the plan, and 
‘‘(C) with respect to which any change 
from the actuarial assumptions and methods 
used in the previous plan year shall be cer-
tified by the plan actuary and the actuarial 
rationale for such change provided in the an-
nual report required by section 6058. 
‘‘(2) FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS.—The 
value of the plan’s assets shall be taken into 
account on the basis of their fair market 
value. 
‘‘(3) DETERMINATION OF NORMAL COST AND 
PLAN LIABILITIES.—A plan’s normal cost and 
liabilities shall be based on the most recent 
actuarial valuation required under section 
437(a)(5)(A) and the unit credit funding meth-
od. 
‘‘(4) TIME
WHEN
CERTAIN
CONTRIBUTIONS 
DEEMED MADE.—Any contributions for a plan 
year made by an employer after the last day 
of such plan year, but not later than two and 
one-half months after such day, shall be 
deemed to have been made on such last day. 
For purposes of this paragraph, such two and 
one-half month period may be extended for 
not more than six months under regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary. 
‘‘(5) ADDITIONAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.— 
Except where otherwise provided in this sub-
part, the provisions of section 432(b)(3)(B) 
shall apply to any determination or projec-
tion under this subpart. 
‘‘SEC. 439. REALIGNMENT PROGRAM. 
‘‘(a) REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(1) ADOPTION.—In any case in which the 
plan actuary certifies under section 438(a) 
that the plan’s projected funded ratio is 
below 120 percent for the plan year, the plan 
sponsor shall adopt a realignment program 
under paragraph (2) not later than 210 days 
after the due date of the certification re-
quired under section 438(a). The plan sponsor 
shall adopt an updated realignment program 
for each succeeding plan year for which a 
certification described in the preceding sen-
tence is made. 
‘‘(2) CONTENT OF REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—A realignment program 
adopted under this paragraph is a written 
program which consists of all reasonable 
measures, including options or a range of op-
tions to be undertaken by the plan sponsor 
or proposed to the bargaining parties, formu-
lated, based on reasonably anticipated expe-
rience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, 
to enable the plan to achieve a projected 
funded ratio of at least 120 percent for the 
following plan year. 
‘‘(B) INITIAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—Reason-
able measures under a realignment program 
described in subparagraph (A) may include 
any of the following: 
‘‘(i) Proposed contribution increases. 
‘‘(ii) A reduction in the rate of future ben-
efit accruals, so long as the resulting rate 
shall not be less than 1 percent of the con-
tributions on which benefits are based as of 
the start of the plan year (or the equivalent 
standard accrual rate as described in section 
432(e)(6)). 
‘‘(iii) A modification or elimination of ad-
justable benefits of participants that are not 
in pay status before the date of the notice re-
quired under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(iv) Any other legally available measures 
not specifically described in this subpara-
graph or subparagraph (C) or (D) that the 
plan sponsor determines are reasonable. 
‘‘(C) ADDITIONAL
PROGRAM
ELEMENTS.—If 
the plan sponsor has determined that all rea-
sonable measures available under subpara-
graph (B) will not enable the plan to achieve 
a projected funded ratio of at least 120 per-
cent the following plan year, such reasonable 
measures may also include— 
‘‘(i) a reduction of accrued benefits that 
are not in pay status by the date of the no-
tice required under subsection (b)(1), or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of any benefits of partici-
pants that are in pay status before the date 
of the notice required under subsection (b)(1) 
other than core benefits as defined in para-
graph (4). 
‘‘(D) ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS.—In the case 
of a composite plan for which the plan spon-
sor has determined that all reasonable meas-
ures available under subparagraphs (B) and 
(C) will not enable the plan to achieve a pro-
jected funded ratio of at least 120 percent for 
the following plan year, such reasonable 
measures may also include— 
‘‘(i) a further reduction in the rate of fu-
ture benefit accruals without regard to the 
limitation applicable under subparagraph 
(B)(ii), or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of core benefits, 
provided that such reductions shall be equi-
tably distributed across the participant and 
beneficiary population, taking into account 
factors, with respect to participants and 
beneficiaries and their benefits, that may in-
clude one or more of the factors listed in 
subclauses 
(I) 
through 
(X) 
of 
section 
432(e)(9)(D)(vi), to the extent necessary to en-
able the plan to achieve a projected funded 
ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year, or at the election of the plan spon-
sor, a projected funded ratio of at least 100 
percent for the following plan year and a 
current funded ratio of at least 90 percent. 
‘‘(3) ADJUSTABLE
BENEFIT
DEFINED.—For 
purposes of this subpart, the term ‘adjust-
able benefit’ means— 
‘‘(A) benefits, rights, and features under 
the plan, including post-retirement death 
benefits, 60-month guarantees, disability 
benefits not yet in pay status, and similar 
benefits, 
‘‘(B) any early retirement benefit or retire-
ment-type subsidy (within the meaning of 
section 411(d)(6)(B)(i)) and any benefit pay-
ment option (other than the qualified joint 
and survivor annuity), and 
‘‘(C) benefit increases that were adopted 
(or, if later, took effect) less than 60 months 
before the first day such realignment pro-
gram took effect. 
‘‘(4) CORE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For purposes 
of this subpart, the term ‘core benefit’ means 
a participant’s accrued benefit payable in 
the normal form of an annuity commencing 
at normal retirement age, determined with-
out regard to— 
‘‘(A) any early retirement benefits, retire-
ment-type 
subsidies, 
or 
other 
benefits, 
rights, or features that may be associated 
with that benefit, and 
‘‘(B) any cost-of-living adjustments or ben-
efit increases effective after the date of re-
tirement. 
‘‘(5) COORDINATION
WITH
CONTRIBUTION
IN-
CREASES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—A realignment program 
may provide that some or all of the benefit 
modifications described in the program will 
only take effect if the bargaining parties fail 
to agree to specified levels of increases in 
contributions to the plan, effective as of 
specified dates. 
‘‘(B) 
INDEPENDENT
BENEFIT
MODIFICA-
TIONS.—If a realignment program adopts any 
changes to the benefit formula that are inde-
pendent of potential contribution increases, 
such changes shall take effect not later than 
180 days following the first day of the first 
plan year that begins following the adoption 
of the realignment program. 
‘‘(C) CONDITIONAL BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes 
to the benefit formula that take effect only 
if the bargaining parties fail to agree to con-
tribution increases, such changes shall take 
effect not later than the first day of the first 
plan year beginning after the third anniver-
sary of the date of adoption of the realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(D) REVOCATION OF CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Benefit modifications described 
in paragraph (3) may be revoked, in whole or 
in part, and retroactively or prospectively, 
when contributions to the plan are in-
creased, as specified in the realignment pro-
gram, including any amendments thereto. 
The preceding sentence shall not apply un-
less the contribution increases are to be ef-
fective not later than the fifth anniversary 
of the first day of the first plan year that be-
gins after the adoption of the realignment 
program. 
‘‘(b) NOTICE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which it is 
certified under section 438(a) that the pro-
jected funded ratio is less than 120 percent, 
the plan sponsor shall, not later than 30 days 
after the date of the certification, provide 
notification of the current and projected 
funded ratios to the participants and bene-
ficiaries, the bargaining parties, and the Sec-
retary. Such notice shall include— 
‘‘(A) an explanation that contribution rate 
increases or benefit reductions may be nec-
essary, 
‘‘(B) a description of the types of benefits 
that might be reduced, and 
‘‘(C) an estimate of the contribution in-
creases and benefit reductions that may be 
necessary to achieve a projected funded ratio 
of 120 percent. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—No modifications may 
be made that reduce the rate of future ben-
efit accrual or that reduce core benefits or 
adjustable benefits unless notice of such re-
duction has been given at least 180 days be-
fore the general effective date of such reduc-
tion for all participants and beneficiaries 
to— 
‘‘(i) plan participants and beneficiaries, 
‘‘(ii) each employer who has an obligation 
to contribute to the composite plan, and 
‘‘(iii) each employee organization which, 
for purposes of collective bargaining, rep-
resents plan participants employed by such 
employers. 
‘‘(B) CONTENT OF NOTICE.—The notice under 
subparagraph (A) shall contain— 
‘‘(i) sufficient information to enable par-
ticipants and beneficiaries to understand the 
effect of any reduction on their benefits, in-
cluding an illustration of any affected ben-
efit or subsidy, on an annual or monthly

in plan liabilities which are scheduled to 
take effect in future plan years may be 
taken into account in connection with a plan

‘‘SEC. 440A. COMPOSITE PLAN RESTRICTIONS TO 
PRESERVE LEGACY PLAN FUNDING. 
‘‘(a) TREATMENT AS A LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sub-
chapter, a defined benefit plan shall be treat-
ed as a legacy plan with respect to the com-
posite plan under which the employees who 
were eligible to accrue a benefit under the 
defined benefit plan become eligible to ac-
crue a benefit under such composite plan. 
‘‘(2) COMPONENT
PLANS.—In any case in 
which a defined benefit plan is amended to 
add a composite plan component pursuant to

component’ for ‘composite plan’. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE
TO
ACCRUE
A
BENEFIT.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is 
considered eligible to accrue a benefit under

als under the composite plan in lieu of accru-
als under the legacy plan. 
‘‘(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.— 
As used in this subpart, the term ‘collective 
bargaining agreement’ includes any agree-
ment under which an employer has an obli-
gation to contribute to a plan.

POSITE PLAN OF AGREEMENTS AND CONTRIBU-
TIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a 
composite plan shall not accept or recognize 
a collective bargaining agreement (or any 
modification to such agreement), and no con-
tributions may be accepted and no benefits 
may be accrued or otherwise earned under 
the agreement— 
‘‘(A) in any case in which the plan actuary 
of any defined benefit plan that would be 
treated as a legacy plan with respect to such 
composite plan has certified under section 
432(b)(3) that such defined benefit plan is or 
will be in critical status for the plan year in 
which such agreement would take effect or 
for any of the succeeding 5 plan years, and 
‘‘(B) unless the agreement requires each 
employer who is a party to such agreement, 
including employers whose employees are 
not participants in the legacy plan, to pro-
vide contributions to the legacy plan with 
respect to such composite plan in a manner 
that satisfies the transition contribution re-
quirements of subsection (d). 
‘‘(2) NOTICE.—Not later than 30 days after a 
determination by a plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan that an agreement fails to satisfy 
the requirements described in paragraph (1), 
the plan sponsor shall provide notification of 
such failure and the reasons for such deter-
mination to— 
‘‘(A) the parties to the agreement, 
‘‘(B) active participants of the composite 
plan who have ceased to accrue or otherwise 
earn benefits with respect to service with an 
employer pursuant to paragraph (1), and 
‘‘(C) the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary 
of the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation. 
‘‘(3) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits 
accrued before the date on which notice is 
provided under paragraph (2). 
‘‘(c) RESTRICTION ON ACCRUAL OF BENEFITS 
UNDER A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which an 
employer, under a collective bargaining 
agreement entered into after the date of en-
actment of the Giving Retirement Options to 
Workers Act of 2020, ceases to have an obli-
gation to contribute to a multiemployer de-
fined benefit plan, no employees employed 
by the employer may accrue or otherwise 
earn benefits under any composite plan, with 
respect to service with that employer, for a 
60-month period beginning on the date on 
which the employer entered into such collec-
tive bargaining agreement. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.— 
Within 30 days of determining that an em-
ployer has ceased to have an obligation to 
contribute to a legacy plan with respect to 
employees employed by an employer that is 
or will be contributing to a composite plan 
with respect to service of such employees, 
the plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall no-
tify the plan sponsor of the composite plan 
of that cessation. 
‘‘(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.— 
Not later than 30 days after determining 
that an employer has ceased to have an obli-
gation to contribute to a legacy plan, the 
plan sponsor of the composite plan shall no-
tify the bargaining parties, the active par-
ticipants affected by the cessation of accru-
als, the Secretary, the Secretary of Labor, 
and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpora-
tion of the cessation of accruals, the period

provided under paragraph (3). 
‘‘(d) TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION
REQUIRE-
MENTS.—

agreement satisfies the transition contribu-
tion requirements of this subsection if the 
agreement— 
‘‘(A) authorizes for payment of contribu-
tions to a legacy plan at a rate or rates equal 
to or greater than the transition contribu-
tion rate established under paragraph (2), 
and 
‘‘(B) does not provide for— 
‘‘(i) a suspension of contributions to the 
legacy plan with respect to any period of 
service, or 
‘‘(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of 
younger or newly hired employees of the em-
ployer from being taken into account in de-
termining contributions owed to the legacy

October 19, 2020 
in section 432(b)(3)(B), is reasonably expected 
to be adequate— 
‘‘(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan 
year, 
‘‘(ii) to amortize the plan’s unfunded liabil-
ities in level annual installments over 25 
years, beginning with the plan year in which 
the transition contribution rate is first es-
tablished, and 
‘‘(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes 
in the legacy plan’s unfunded liability due to 
experience gains or losses (including invest-
ment gains or losses, gains or losses due to 
contributions greater or less than the con-
tributions made under the prior transition 
contribution rate, and other actuarial gains 
or losses), changes in actuarial assumptions, 
changes to the legacy plan’s benefits, or 
changes in funding method over a period of 
15 plan years beginning with the plan year in 
which such change in unfunded liability is 
incurred. 
The transition contribution rate for any plan 
year may not be less than the transition con-
tribution rate for the plan year in which 
such rate is first established. 
‘‘(B) MULTIPLE RATES.—If different rates of 
contribution are payable to the legacy plan 
by different employers or for different class-
es of employees, the certification shall speci-
fy a transition contribution rate for each 
such employer. 
‘‘(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided by 
clause (ii), the transition contribution rate 
applicable to an employer for a plan year is 
the rate in effect for the plan year of the leg-
acy plan that commences on or after 180 days 
before the earlier of— 
‘‘(I) the effective date of the collective bar-
gaining agreement pursuant to which the 
employer contributes to the legacy plan, or 
‘‘(II) 5 years after the last plan year for 
which the transition contribution rate appli-
cable to the employer was established or up-
dated. 
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—The transition contribu-
tion rate applicable to an employer for the 
first plan year beginning on or after the 
commencement of the employer’s obligation 
to contribute to the composite plan is the 
rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy 
plan that commences on or after 180 days be-
fore such first plan year. 
‘‘(D) EFFECT OF LEGACY PLAN FINANCIAL CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—If the plan actuary of the leg-
acy plan has certified under section 432 that 
the plan is in endangered or critical status 
for a plan year, the transition contribution 
rate for the following plan year is the rate 
determined with respect to the employer 
under the legacy plan’s funding improvement 
or rehabilitation plan under section 432, if 
greater than the rate otherwise determined, 
but in no event greater than 75 percent of the 
sum of the contribution rates applicable to 
the legacy plan and the composite plan for 
the plan year. 
‘‘(E) OTHER
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND 
METHODS.—Except as provided in subpara-
graph (A), the determination of the transi-
tion contribution rate for a plan year shall 
be based on actuarial assumptions and meth-
ods consistent with the minimum funding 
determinations made under section 431 (or, if 
applicable, section 432) with respect to the 
legacy plan for the plan year. 
‘‘(F) ADJUSTMENTS
IN
RATE.—The plan 
sponsor of a legacy plan from time to time 
may adjust the transition contribution rate 
or rates applicable to an employer under this 
paragraph by increasing some rates and de-
creasing others if the actuary certifies that 
such adjusted rates in combination will 
produce projected contribution income for 
the plan year beginning on or after the date 
of certification that is not less than would be 
produced by the transition contribution 
rates in effect at the time of the certifi-
cation. 
‘‘(G) NOTICE
OF
TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION 
RATE.—The plan sponsor of a legacy plan 
shall provide notice to the parties to collec-
tive bargaining agreements pursuant to 
which contributions are made to the legacy 
plan of changes to the transition contribu-
tion rate requirements at least 30 days be-
fore the beginning of the plan year for which 
the rate is effective. 
‘‘(H) NOTICE TO COMPOSITE PLAN SPONSOR.— 
Not later than 30 days after a determination 
by the plan sponsor of a legacy plan that a 
collective bargaining agreement provides for 
a rate of contributions that is below the 
transition contribution rate applicable to 
one or more employers that are parties to 
the collective bargaining agreement, the 
plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall notify 
the plan sponsor of any composite plan under 
which employees of such employer would 
otherwise be eligible to accrue a benefit. 
‘‘(3) CORRECTION PROCEDURES.—Pursuant to 
standards prescribed by the Secretary of 
Labor, the plan sponsor of a composite plan 
shall adopt rules and procedures that give 
the parties to the collective bargaining 
agreement notice of the failure of such 
agreement to satisfy the transition contribu-
tion requirements of this subsection, and a 
reasonable opportunity to correct such fail-
ure, not to exceed 180 days from the date of 
notice given under subsection (b)(2). 
‘‘(4) SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS.—A col-
lective bargaining agreement may provide 
for supplemental contributions to the legacy 
plan for a plan year in excess of the transi-
tion contribution rate determined under 
paragraph (2), regardless of whether the leg-
acy plan is in endangered or critical status 
for such plan year. 
‘‘(e) NONAPPLICATION
OF COMPOSITE PLAN 
RESTRICTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The provisions of sub-
sections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply with 
respect to a collective bargaining agreement, 
to the extent the agreement, or a prede-
cessor agreement, provides or provided for 
contributions to a defined benefit plan that 
is a legacy plan, as of the first day of the 
first plan year following a plan year for 
which the plan actuary certifies that the 
plan is fully funded, has been fully funded for 
at least three out of the immediately pre-
ceding 5 plan years, and is projected to re-
main fully funded for at least the following 
4 plan years. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION OF FULLY FUNDED.—A 
plan is fully funded for purposes of paragraph 
(1) if, as of the valuation date of the plan for 
a plan year, the value of the plan’s assets 
equals or exceeds the present value of the 
plan’s liabilities, determined in accordance 
with the rules prescribed by the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation under sections 
4219(c)(1)(D) and 4281 of Employee Retire-
ment Income and Security Act for multiem-
ployer plans terminating by mass with-
drawal, as in effect for the date of the deter-
mination, except the plan’s reasonable as-
sumption regarding the starting date of ben-
efits may be used. 
‘‘(3) OTHER APPLICABLE RULES.—Except as 
provided in paragraph (2), actuarial deter-
minations and projections under this section 
shall be based on the rules in section 432(b)(3) 
and section 438(b). 
‘‘SEC. 440B. MERGERS AND ASSET TRANSFERS OF 
COMPOSITE PLANS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Assets and liabilities of 
a composite plan may only be merged with, 
or transferred to, another plan if— 
‘‘(1) the other plan is a composite plan, 
‘‘(2) the plan or plans resulting from the 
merger or transfer is a composite plan, 
‘‘(3) no participant’s accrued benefit or ad-
justable benefit is lower immediately after 
the transaction than it was immediately be-
fore the transaction, and 
‘‘(4) the value of the assets transferred in 
the case of a transfer reasonably reflects the 
value of the amounts contributed with re-
spect to the participants whose benefits are 
being transferred, adjusted for allocable dis-
tributions, investment gains and losses, and 
administrative expenses. 
‘‘(b) LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—After a merger or trans-
fer involving a composite plan, the legacy 
plan with respect to an employer that is ob-
ligated to contribute to the resulting com-
posite plan is the legacy plan that applied to 
that employer immediately before the merg-
er or transfer. 
‘‘(2) MULTIPLE
LEGACY
PLANS.—If an em-
ployer is obligated to contribute to more 
than one legacy plan with respect to employ-
ees eligible to accrue benefits under more 
than one composite plan and there is a merg-
er or transfer of such legacy plans, the tran-
sition contribution rate applicable to the 
legacy plan resulting from the merger or 
transfer with respect to that employer shall 
be determined in accordance with the provi-
sions of section 440A(d)(2)(B).’’.

average price at which the same or a similar 
good or service was readily obtainable from 
other similarly situated competing sellers 
before January 31, 2020. 
(3) Whether such price reasonably reflects 
additional costs, not within the control of 
such person, that were paid, incurred, or rea-
sonably anticipated by such person, or rea-
sonably reflects the profitability of forgone

October 19, 2020 
impact the safety and security of commu-
nities in the United States by damaging rela-
tionships between incarcerated persons and 
their support systems, thereby exacerbating 
recidivism. 
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has greatly in-
tensified these concerns. Jails and prisons 
have become epicenters for the spread of the 
virus, 
with 
incarcerated 
persons 
con-
centrated in small, confined spaces and often 
without access to adequate health care. At 
Cook County jail alone, hundreds of incar-
cerated persons and jail staff have tested 
positive for the virus since its outbreak. 
(4) To prevent the spread of the virus, 
many jails and prisons across the country 
suspended public visitation, leaving confine-
ment facility communications services as 
the only way that incarcerated persons can 
stay in touch with their families. 
(5) All people in the United States, includ-
ing anyone who pays for confinement facility 
communications services, should have access 
to communications services at charges that 
are just and reasonable. 
(6) Unemployment has risen sharply as a 
result of the COVID–19 pandemic, straining 
the incomes of millions of Americans and 
making it even more difficult for families of 
incarcerated persons to pay the high costs of 
confinement facility communications serv-
ices. 
(7) Certain markets for confinement facil-
ity communications services are distorted 
due to reverse competition, in which the fi-
nancial interests of the entity making the 
buying decision (the confinement facility) 
are aligned with the seller (the provider of 
confinement facility communications serv-
ices) and not the consumer (the incarcerated 
person or a member of his or her family). 
This reverse competition occurs because site 
commission payments to the confinement fa-
cility from the provider of confinement facil-
ity communications services are the chief 
criterion many facilities use to select their 
provider of confinement facility communica-
tions services. 
(8) Charges for confinement facility com-
munications services that have been shown 
to be unjust and unreasonable are often a re-
sult of site commission payments that far 
exceed the costs incurred by the confinement 
facility in accommodating these services. 
(9) Unjust and unreasonable charges have 
been assessed for both audio and video serv-
ices and for both intrastate and interstate 
communications from confinement facilities. 
(10) Though Congress enacted emergency 
legislation to allow free communications in 
Federal prisons during the pandemic, it does 
not cover communications to or from anyone 
incarcerated in State and local prisons or 
jails. 
(11) Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed led a cam-
paign for just communications rates for in-
carcerated people for over a decade. 
(12) Mrs. Wright-Reed was the lead plaintiff 
in Wright v. Corrections Corporation of 
America, CA No. 00–293 (GK) (D.D.C. 2001). 
(13) That case ultimately led to the Wright 
Petition at the Federal Communications 
Commission, CC Docket No. 96–128 (Novem-
ber 3, 2003). 
(14) As a grandmother, Mrs. Wright-Reed 
was forced to choose between purchasing 
medication and communicating with her in-
carcerated grandson. 
(15) Mrs. Wright-Reed passed away on Jan-
uary 18, 2015, before fully realizing her dream 
of just communications rates for all people.

ICES, DURING THE COVID–19 PAN-
DEMIC AND OTHER TIMES.

rower remains the same as it was prior to 
the forbearance, subject to any adjustment 
of the index pursuant to the terms of an ad-
justable rate mortgage, and that— 
‘‘(I) defers the payment of total arrearages,

EXCEPTION.—Notwithstanding

vances or arrearages if the servicer has infor-
mation indicating that the borrower cannot 
resume the pre-forbearance mortgage pay-

fees or corporate advances related to a fore-
closure on the basis that the borrower has 
failed to perform under the loss mitigation 
offer in paragraph (2)(A) within the first 90 
days after the option is offered, including a

tain the documents and information needed 
to complete the loss mitigation application 
of the borrower; and

reasonable diligence, the loss mitigation ap-
plication remains incomplete 60 days after 
the notice in paragraph (2)(A) is sent—

or incomplete loss mitigation application 
without reference to whether the borrower 
has previously submitted a complete loss 
mitigation application; and

mitigation options for which the borrower 
qualifies under applicable investor guide-

quired documentation.

application, offer, or evaluation for loss 
mitigation under this section for a covered 
mortgage loan that is not a federally insured 
reverse mortgage loan shall not be the basis

as duplicative or for a reduction in the ap-
peal rights of the borrower under Regulation 
X in part 1024 of title 12, Code of Federal 
Regulations, in regard to any loss mitigation 
application submitted after the servicer has

ages, including any escrow advances, to the 
end of the existing term of the loan, without 
the charging or collection of any additional 
interest on the deferred amounts; or

loan, and capitalizes, defers, or forgives all 
escrow advances and other arrearages, with-
out the charging of any fees or penalties be-

condition to sending a due and payable re-
quest to the Secretary or initiating or con-
tinuing a foreclosure process—

COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THROUGH IN-
CLUSIVE LENDING 
SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Promoting 
and 
Advancing 
Communities 
of 
Color 
through Inclusive Lending Act’’. 
SEC. 702. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID–19) pan-
demic and the resulting recession have led to 
more than 4.8 million cases and at least 
157,000 deaths in the United States as of Au-
gust 6, 2020; a 7.6 percent increase in the un-
employment rate from February to June, or 
approximately 12 million more persons who 
have lost their job; and an estimated 36 per-
cent of renters and 4.1 million homeowners 
who are struggling to pay their rent and 
mortgages. 
(2) According to the Centers for Disease 
Control, ‘‘long-standing systemic health and 
social inequities have put some members of 
racial and ethnic minority groups at in-
creased risk of getting COVID–19 or experi-
encing severe illness’’. 
(3) Minority-owned businesses are also fac-
ing more difficult economic circumstances 
than others as a result of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. In April 2020, the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York reported that minority- 
and women-owned businesses were not only 
more likely to show signs of limited finan-
cial health, but also twice as likely to be 
classified as ‘‘at risk’’ or ‘‘distressed’’ than 
their non-minority counterparts.

pandemic, community development financial

October 19, 2020 
institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository 
institutions (MDIs) have delivered needed 
capital and relief to underserved commu-
nities, many of which have borne a dis-
proportionate impact of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Through August 8, 2020, CDFIs and 
MDIs have provided more than $16.4 billion 
in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 
loans to small businesses with a smaller me-
dian loan size of about $74,000 compared to 
the overall program median loan size of 
$101,000. 
(5) In addition to establishing relief funds 
and services for local businesses and individ-
uals experiencing loss of income, CDFIs and 
MDIs have provided mortgage forbearances, 
loan deferments, and modifications to help 
address the needs of their borrowers. CDFIs 
and MDIs are reaching underserved commu-
nities and minority-owned businesses at a 
critical time. 
(6) The Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) is an agency 
of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and 
was established by the Riegle Community 
Development and Regulatory Improvement 
Act of 1994. The mission of the CDFI Fund is 
‘‘to expand economic opportunity for under-
served people and communities by sup-
porting the growth and capacity of a na-
tional network of community development 
lenders, investors, and financial service pro-
viders’’. As of September 15, 2020, there were 
1,137 certified CDFIs in all 50 States, District 
of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. 
(7) Following the 2008 financial crisis and 
the disproportionate impact the Great Re-
cession had on minority communities, the 
number of MDI banks fell more than 30 per-
cent over the following decade, to 143 as of 
the second quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, MDI 
credit unions have seen similar declines, 
with more than one-third of such institu-
tions disappearing since 2013. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—The following is 
the sense of the Congress: 
(1) The Department of the Treasury, Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
Small Business Administration (SBA), Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal 
Deposit 
Insurance 
Corporation, 
National 
Credit Union Administration, and other Fed-
eral agencies should take steps to support, 
engage with, and utilize minority depository 
institutions and community development fi-
nancial institutions in the near term, espe-
cially as they carry out programs to respond 
to the COVID–19 pandemic, and the long 
term. 
(2) The Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System should, consistent with its 
mandates, work to increase lending by mi-
nority depository institutions and commu-
nity development financial institutions to 
underserved communities, and when appro-
priate, should work with the Department of 
the Treasury to increase lending by minority 
depository institutions and community de-
velopment financial institutions to under-
served communities. 
(3) The Department of the Treasury and 
prudential regulators should establish a stra-
tegic plan identifying concrete steps that 
they can take to support existing minority 
depository institutions, as well as the forma-
tion of new minority depository institutions 
consistent with the goals established in the 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, 
and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) to 
preserve and promote minority depository 
institutions. 
(4) Congress should increase funding and 
make other enhancements, including those 
provided by this legislation, to enhance the 
effectiveness of the CDFI Fund, especially 
reforms to support minority-owned and mi-
nority led CDFIs in times of crisis and be-
yond. 
(5) Congress should conduct robust and on-
going oversight of the Department of the 
Treasury, CDFI Fund, Federal prudential 
regulators, SBA, and other Federal agencies 
to ensure they fulfill their obligations under 
the law as well as implement this title and 
other laws in a manner that supports and 
fully utilizes minority depository institu-
tions and community development financial 
intuitions, as appropriate. 
(6) The investments made by the Secretary 
of the Treasury under this title and the 
amendments made by this title should be de-
signed to maximize the benefit to low- and 
moderate-income and minority communities 
and contemplate losses to capital of the 
Treasury. 
SEC. 703. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this title is to— 
(1) establish programs to revitalize and 
provide long-term financial products and 
service availability for, and provide invest-
ments in, low- and moderate-income and mi-
nority communities; 
(2) respond to the unprecedented loss of 
Black-owned businesses and unemployment; 
and 
(3) otherwise enhance the stability, safety 
and soundness of community financial insti-
tutions that support low- and moderate-in-
come and minority communities.

ties under this title and the amendments 
made by this title, the Secretary of the

nonprofit 
organizations,

SEC. 707. ENSURING DIVERSITY IN COMMUNITY 
BANKING. 
(a) SENSE
OF CONGRESS
ON FUNDING
THE 
LOAN-LOSS RESERVE FUND FOR SMALL DOLLAR 
LOANS.—The sense of Congress is the fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund (the ‘‘CDFI Fund’’) is an 
agency of the Department of the Treasury, 
and was established by the Riegle Commu-
nity Development and Regulatory Improve-
ment Act of 1994. The mission of the CDFI 
Fund is ‘‘to expand economic opportunity for 
underserved people and communities by sup-
porting the growth and capacity of a na-
tional network of community development 
lenders, investors, and financial service pro-
viders’’. A community development financial 
institution (a ‘‘CDFI’’) is a specialized finan-
cial institution serving low-income commu-
nities and a Community Development Entity 
(a ‘‘CDE’’) is a domestic corporation or part-
nership that is an intermediary vehicle for 
the provision of loans, investments, or finan-
cial counseling in low-income communities. 
The CDFI Fund certifies CDFIs and CDEs. 
Becoming a certified CDFI or CDE allows or-
ganizations to participate in various CDFI 
Fund programs as follows: 
(A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, 
which provides FDIC-insured depository in-
stitutions awards for a demonstrated in-
crease in lending and investments in dis-
tressed communities and CDFIs. 
(B) The CDFI Program, which provides Fi-
nancial and Technical Assistance awards to 
CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI, and to build 
the capacity of the CDFI, including financ-
ing product development and loan loss re-
serves. 
(C) The Native American CDFI Assistance 
Program, which provides CDFIs and spon-
soring entities Financial and Technical As-
sistance awards to increase lending and grow 
the number of CDFIs owned by Native Amer-
icans to help build capacity of such CDFIs. 
(D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, 
which provides tax credits for making equity 
investments in CDEs that stimulate capital 
investments in low-income communities. 
(E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which pro-
vides awards to CDFIs and nonprofit afford-
able housing organizations to finance afford-
able housing solutions and related economic 
development activities. 
(F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source 
of long-term, patient capital for CDFIs to ex-
pand lending and investment capacity for 
community and economic development pur-
poses. 
(2) The Department of the Treasury is au-
thorized to create multi-year grant programs 
designed to encourage low-to-moderate in-
come individuals to establish accounts at 
federally insured banks, and to improve low- 
to-moderate income individuals’ access to 
such accounts on reasonable terms. 
(3) Under this authority, grants to partici-
pants in CDFI Fund programs may be used 
for loan-loss reserves and to establish small- 
dollar loan programs by subsidizing related 
losses. These grants also allow for the pro-
viding recipients with the financial coun-
seling and education necessary to conduct 
transactions and manage their accounts. 
These loans provide low-cost alternatives to 
payday loans and other nontraditional forms 
of financing that often impose excessive in-
terest rates and fees on borrowers, and lead 
millions of Americans to fall into debt traps. 
Small-dollar loans can only be made pursu-
ant to terms, conditions, and practices that 
are reasonable for the individual consumer 
obtaining the loan. 
(4) Program participation is restricted to 
eligible institutions, which are limited to or-
ganizations listed in section 501(c)(3) of the 
Internal Revenue Code and exempt from tax 
under 501(a) of such Code, federally insured 
depository institutions, community develop-
ment financial institutions and State, local, 
or Tribal government entities. 
(5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has 
awarded over $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and 
CDEs, allocated $54,000,000,000 in tax credits, 
and $1,510,000,000 in bond guarantees. Accord-
ing to the CDFI Fund, some programs at-
tract as much as $10 in private capital for 
every $1 invested by the CDFI Fund. The Ad-
ministration 
and 
the 
Congress 
should 
prioritize appropriation of funds for the loan 
loss reserve fund and technical assistance 
programs administered by the Community 
Development Financial Institution Fund. 
(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL IN-
STITUTION.—The term ‘‘community develop-
ment financial institution’’ has the meaning 
given under section 103 of the Riegle Commu-
nity Development and Regulatory Improve-

(2) MINORITY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.—The 
term ‘‘minority depository institution’’ has 
the meaning given under section 308 of the 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, 
and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 1463 
note).

cial with the missing signature on a form

lot request application to be completed and 
submitted online and if the website permits 
the individual—

individual may complete the application and 
return it to the official; or

cation be transmitted to the individual by 
mail or electronic mail so that the indi-
vidual may complete the application and re-
turn it to the official.

DELIVERY
PRIOR
TO
ELEC-
TION.—If an individual requests to vote by 
absentee ballot in an election for Federal of-
fice, the appropriate State or local election

MAILED BALLOTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A State may not refuse 
to accept or process a ballot submitted by an

grounds that the individual did not meet a 
deadline for returning the ballot to the ap-
propriate State or local election official if— 
‘‘(A) the ballot is postmarked, signed, or 
otherwise indicated by the United States 
Postal Service to have been mailed on or be-
fore the date of the election; and

priate election official prior to the expira-
tion of the 10-day period which begins on the

ballot by delivering the ballot at such times 
and to such locations as the State may es-
tablish, including— 
‘‘(A) permitting the individual to deliver 
the ballot to a polling place on any date on

cation.

VOTERS
TO
DESIGNATE 
OTHER
PERSON
TO
RETURN

State— 
‘‘(A) shall permit a voter to designate any 
person to return a voted and sealed absentee 
ballot to the post office, a ballot drop-off lo-
cation, tribally designated building, or elec-
tion office so long as the person designated 
to return the ballot does not receive any 
form of compensation based on the number 
of ballots that the person has returned and 
no individual, group, or organization pro-
vides compensation on this basis; and 
‘‘(B) may not put any limit on how many 
voted and sealed absentee ballots any des-
ignated person can return to the post office, 
a ballot drop off location, tribally designated 
building, or election office.

SEC. 108. ACCOMMODATIONS FOR VOTERS RESID-
ING IN INDIAN LANDS. 
(a) ACCOMMODATIONS DESCRIBED.— 
(1) DESIGNATION OF BALLOT PICKUP AND COL-
LECTION
LOCATIONS.—Given the widespread 
lack of residential mail delivery in Indian 
Country, an Indian Tribe may designate 
buildings as ballot pickup and collection lo-
cations with respect to an election for Fed-
eral office at no cost to the Indian Tribe. An 
Indian Tribe may designate one building per 
precinct located within Indian lands. The ap-
plicable State or political subdivision shall 
collect ballots from those locations. The ap-
plicable State or political subdivision shall 
provide the Indian Tribe with accurate pre-
cinct maps for all precincts located within 
Indian lands 60 days before the election. 
(2) PROVISION
OF
MAIL-IN
AND
ABSENTEE 
BALLOTS.—The State or political subdivision 
shall provide mail-in and absentee ballots 
with respect to an election for Federal office 
to each individual who is registered to vote 
in the election who resides on Indian lands in 
the State or political subdivision involved 
without requiring a residential address or a 
mail-in or absentee ballot request. 
(3) USE OF DESIGNATED BUILDING AS RESI-
DENTIAL AND MAILING ADDRESS.—The address 
of a designated building that is a ballot pick-
up and collection location with respect to an 
election for Federal office may serve as the 
residential address and mailing address for 
voters living on Indian lands if the tribally 
designated building is in the same precinct 
as that voter. If there is no tribally des-
ignated building within a voter’s precinct, 
the voter may use another tribally des-
ignated building within the Indian lands 
where the voter is located. Voters using a 
tribally designated building outside of the 
voter’s precinct may use the tribally des-
ignated building as a mailing address and 
may separately designate the voter’s appro-
priate precinct through a description of the 
voter’s address, as specified in section 
9428.4(a)(2) of title 11, Code of Federal Regu-
lations. 
(4) LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY.—In the case of 
a State or political subdivision that is a cov-
ered State or political subdivision under sec-
tion 203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 
U.S.C. 10503), that State or political subdivi-
sion shall provide absentee or mail-in voting 
materials with respect to an election for 
Federal office in the language of the applica-
ble minority group as well as in the English 
language, bilingual election voting assist-
ance, and written translations of all voting 
materials in the language of the applicable 
minority group, as required by section 203 of 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 
10503), as amended by subsection (b). 
(5) CLARIFICATION.—Nothing in this section 
alters the ability of an individual voter re-
siding on Indian lands to request a ballot in 
a manner available to all other voters in the 
State. 
(6) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(A) ELECTION
FOR
FEDERAL
OFFICE.—The 
term ‘‘election for Federal office’’ means a 
general, special, primary or runoff election 
for the office of President or Vice President, 
or of Senator or Representative in, or Dele-
gate or Resident Commissioner to, the Con-
gress.

term 
‘‘Indian

TITLE II—GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY ACT 
OF 2020 
SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Global 
Health Security Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 202. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In December 2009, President Obama re-
leased the National Strategy for Countering 
Biological Threats, which listed as one of 
seven objectives ‘‘Promote global health se-
curity: Increase the availability of and ac-
cess to knowledge and products of the life 
sciences that can help reduce the impact 
from outbreaks of infectious disease whether 
of natural, accidental, or deliberate origin’’. 
(2) In February 2014, the United States and 
nearly 30 other nations launched the Global 
Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to address 
several high-priority, global infectious dis-
ease threats. The GHSA is a multi-faceted, 
multi-country initiative intended to accel-
erate partner countries’ measurable capabili-
ties to achieve specific targets to prevent, 
detect, and respond to infectious disease 
threats, whether naturally occurring, delib-
erate, or accidental. 
(3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
Sustainable 
Development 
Goals 
(SDGs), 
which include specific reference to the im-
portance of global health security as part of 
SDG 3 ‘‘ensure healthy lives and promote 
well-being for all at all ages’’ as follows: 
‘‘strengthen the capacity of all countries, in 
particular developing countries, for early 
warning, risk reduction and management of 
national and global health risks’’. 
(4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama 
signed Executive Order 13747, ‘‘Advancing 
the Global Health Security Agenda to 
Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infec-
tious Disease Threats’’. 
(5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial 
Meeting in Uganda, the United States and

SEC. 208. COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOREIGN AID 
TRANSPARENCY 
AND 
ACCOUNT-
ABILITY ACT OF 2016. 
Section 2(3) of the Foreign Aid Trans-
parency and Accountability Act of 2016 (Pub-
lic Law 114–191; 22 U.S.C. 2394c note) is 
amended— 
(1) in subparagraph (C), by striking ‘‘and’’ 
at the end; 
(2) in subparagraph (D), by striking the pe-
riod at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(E) the Global Health Security Act of 
2020.’’. 
SEC. 209. DEFINITIONS. 
In this title: 
(1) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘‘appropriate congressional 
committees’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(B) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate. 
(2) GLOBAL
HEALTH
SECURITY.—The term 
‘‘global health security’’ means activities 
supporting epidemic and pandemic prepared-
ness and capabilities at the country and 
global levels in order to minimize vulner-
ability to acute public health events that 
can endanger the health of populations 
across 
geographical 
regions 
and 
inter-
national boundaries. 
SEC. 210. SUNSET. 
This title (other than section 205), and the 
amendments made by this title, shall cease 
to be effective on December 31, 2024. 
TITLE III—SECURING AMERICA FROM 
EPIDEMICS ACT 
SEC. 301. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Due to increasing population and popu-
lation density, human mobility, and ecologi-
cal change, emerging infectious diseases pose 
a real and growing threat to global health 
security. 
(2) While vaccines can be the most effec-
tive tools to protect against infectious dis-
ease, the absence of vaccines for a new or 
emerging infectious disease with epidemic 
potential is a major health security threat 
globally, 
posing 
catastrophic 
potential 
human and economic costs. 
(3) The 1918 influenza pandemic infected 
500,000,000 people, or about one-third of the 
world’s population at the time, and killed 
50,000,000 people—more than died in the First 
World War. 
(4) The economic cost of an outbreak can 
be devastating. The estimated global cost 
today, should an outbreak of the scale of the 
1918 influenza pandemic strike, is 5 percent 
of global gross domestic product. 
(5) Even regional outbreaks can have enor-
mous human costs and substantially disrupt 
the global economy and cripple regional 
economies. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West 
Africa killed more than 11,000 and cost 
$2,800,000,000 in losses in the affected coun-
tries alone. 
(6) The ongoing novel coronavirus out-
break reflects the pressing need for quick 
and effective vaccine and countermeasure 
development. 
(7) While the need for vaccines to address 
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets 
to drive the necessary development of vac-
cines to address them—a complex and expen-
sive undertaking—are very often critically 
absent. Also absent are mechanisms to en-
sure access to those vaccines by those who 
need them when they need them. 
(8) To address this global vulnerability and 
the deficit of political commitment, institu-
tional capacity, and funding, in 2017, several 
countries and private partners launched the 
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innova-
tions (CEPI). CEPI’s mission is to stimulate, 
finance, and coordinate development of vac-
cines for high-priority, epidemic-potential 
threats in cases where traditional markets 
do not exist or cannot create sufficient de-
mand. 
(9) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates 
through the end of phase II clinical trials, as 
well as support vaccine platforms that can 
be rapidly deployed against emerging patho-
gens. 
(10) CEPI has funded multiple partners to 
develop vaccine candidates against the novel 
coronavirus, responding to this urgent, glob-
al requirement. 
(11) Support for and participation in CEPI 
is an important part of the United States 
own health security and biodefense and is in 
the national interest, complementing the 
work of many Federal agencies and pro-
viding significant value through global part-
nership and burden-sharing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6286 
October 19, 2020 
(3) Although the United States has less 
than 5 percent of the world’s population, the 
United States holds approximately 21 per-
cent of the world’s prisoners and leads the 
world in the number of individuals incarcer-
ated, with nearly 2,200,000 people incarcer-
ated in State and Federal prisons and local 
jails. 
(4) Studies have shown that individuals age 
out of crime starting around 25 years of age, 
and released individuals over the age of 50 
have a very low recidivism rate. 
(5) According to public health experts, in-
carcerated individuals are particularly vul-
nerable to being gravely impacted by the 
novel corona virus pandemic because— 
(A) they have higher rates of underlying 
health issues than members of the general 
public, including higher rates of respiratory 
disease, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, HIV/ 
AIDS, substance abuse, hepatitis, and other 
conditions that suppress immune response; 
and 
(B) the close conditions and lack of access 
to hygiene products in prisons make these 
institutions unusually susceptible to viral 
pandemics. 
(6) The spread of communicable disease in 
the United States generally constitutes a se-
rious, heightened threat to the safety of in-
carcerated individuals, and there is a serious 
threat to the general public that prisons 
may 
become 
incubators 
of 
community 
spread of communicable viral disease.

(iii) has a covered health condition; or 
(iv) is within 12 months of release from in-
carceration; and

paragraph (A) who is serving a term of im-
prisonment for an offense committed before 
November 1, 1987, or who is serving a term of 
imprisonment in the custody of the Bureau 
of Prisons for a sentence imposed pursuant

gency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5191(b)) with

(1) AUTHORITY.—Except as provided in

which a national emergency relating to a 
communicable disease is declared and ending

tional emergency expires or is terminated—

(I) appearance by the defendant or any 
party; or 
(II) requiring a petition, motion, or other 
similar document to be filed; 
(ii) may not place in community super-
vision any individual if the court deter-
mines, after a hearing and the attorney for 
the Government shows by clear and con-
vincing evidence based on individualized 
facts, that detention is necessary because 
the individual’s release will pose a specific 
and substantial risk that the individual will 
cause bodily injury or use violent force 
against the person of another and that no 
conditions of release will reasonably miti-
gate that risk; 
(iii) in carrying out clauses (i) and (ii), 
may— 
(I) rely on evidence presented in prior 
court proceedings; and 
(II) if the court determines it necessary,

ties to make the determination. 
(3) LIMITATION ON COMMUNITY SUPERVISION

a national emergency relating to a commu-
nicable disease is declared and ending on the

gency expires or is terminated, in imposing 
conditions of release, the judicial officer 
may not require payment of cash bail, proof 
of ability to pay an unsecured bond, execu-
tion of a bail bond, a solvent surety to co- 
sign a secured or unsecured bond, or posting 
of real property. 
(2) LIMITATION.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Beginning on the date on 
which a national emergency relating to a 
communicable disease is declared and ending 
on the date that is 60 days after such na-
tional emergency expires or is terminated, 
at any initial appearance hearing, detention 
hearing, hearing on a motion for pretrial re-
lease, or any other hearing where the attor-
ney for the Government is seeking the deten-
tion or continued detention of any indi-
vidual, the judicial officer shall order the 
pretrial release of the individual on personal 
recognizance or on a condition or combina-
tion of conditions under section 3142(c) of 
title 18, United States Code, unless the attor-
ney for the Government shows by clear and 
convincing evidence based on individualized 
facts that detention is necessary because the 
individual’s release will pose a specific and 
substantial risk that the individual will 
cause bodily injury or use violent force 
against the person of another and that no 
conditions of release will reasonably miti-
gate that risk. 
(B) REQUIRED
CONSIDERATION
OF
CERTAIN 
FACTORS.—If the judicial officer finds that 
the attorney for the Government has made 
the requisite showing under subparagraph 
(A), the judicial officer shall take into con-
sideration, in determining whether detention 
is necessary— 
(i) whether the individual’s age or medical 
condition renders them especially vulner-
able; and 
(ii) whether detention will compromise the 
individual’s access to adequate medical 
treatment, access to medications, or ability 
to privately consult with counsel and mean-
ingfully prepare a defense. 
(C) JUVENILES.— 
(i) IN GENERAL.—Beginning on the date on 
which a national emergency relating to a 
communicable disease is declared and ending 
on the date that is 60 days after such na-
tional emergency expires or is terminated,

venile alleged to have committed an act of 
juvenile delinquency, the judicial officer

guardian, custodian, or other responsible 
party (including the director of a shelter- 
care facility) upon their promise to bring 
such juvenile before the appropriate court 
when requested by the judicial officer. 
(ii) EXCEPTION.—A juvenile alleged to have 
committed an act of juvenile delinquency 
may be detained pending trial only if, at a 
hearing at which the juvenile is represented 
by counsel, the attorney for the Government 
shows by clear and convincing evidence 
based on individualized facts that detention 
is necessary because the juvenile’s release 
will pose a specific and substantial risk that 
the juvenile will use violent force against a 
reasonably identifiable person and that no 
conditions of release will reasonably miti-
gate that risk, except that in no case may a 
judicial officer order the detention of a juve-
nile if it will compromise the juvenile’s ac-
cess to adequate medical treatment, access 
to medications, or ability to privately con-
sult with counsel and meaningfully prepare a 
defense. 
(iii) LEAST RESTRICTIVE DETENTION.—In the 
case that the judicial officer orders the de-
tention of a juvenile under clause (ii), the ju-
dicial officer shall order the detention of the 
juvenile in the least restrictive and safest 
environment possible, taking the national 
emergency relating to a communicable dis-
ease into consideration.

viduals in congregant living situations may 
promote the spread of COVID–19. 
‘‘(B) While individuals arrested and proc-
essed at local correctional facilities may 
only be held for hours or days, exposure to 
large number of individuals in holding cells 
and courtrooms promotes the spread of 
COVID–19. 
‘‘(C) Pretrial detainees and individuals in 
correctional facilities are then later released 
into the community having being exposed to 
COVID–19. 
‘‘(2) PURPOSE.—The purpose of the grant 
program under section 3065 is to substan-
tially increase the use of risk-based citation 
release for all individuals who do not present

lease the persons described in paragraph (2)

TITLE IV—JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT 
SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Jabara- 
Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, 
and Threats to Equality Act of 2020’’ or the 
‘‘Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act’’. 
SEC. 402. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
crimes or crimes motivated by bias poses a 
serious national problem. 
(2) According to data obtained by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of 
such violence increased in 2017, the most re-
cent year for which data is available. 
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate 
Crime Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 
U.S.C. 534 note) to provide the Federal Gov-
ernment, law enforcement agencies, and the 
public with data regarding the incidence of 
hate crime. The Hate Crimes Statistics Act 
and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, 
Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E 
of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have en-
abled Federal authorities to understand and, 
where appropriate, investigate and prosecute 
hate crimes. 
(4) A more complete understanding of the 
national problem posed by hate crime is in 
the public interest and supports the Federal 
interest in eradicating bias-motivated vio-
lence referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of 
title 18, United States Code. 
(5) However, a complete understanding of 
the national problem posed by hate crimes is 
hindered by incomplete data from Federal, 
State, and local jurisdictions through the 
Uniform Crime Reports program authorized 
under section 534 of title 28, United States 
Code, and administered by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation. 
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the pro-
vision of inaccurate and incomplete data re-
garding the incidence of hate crime through 
the Uniform Crime Reports program. A sig-
nificant contributing factor is the quality 
and quantity of training that State and local 
law enforcement agencies receive on the 
identification and reporting of suspected 
bias-motivated crimes. 
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by 
bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and 
interstate in nature as to warrant Federal fi-
nancial assistance to States and local juris-
dictions. 
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard 
to certain violent crimes motivated by bias 
enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
to work together as partners in the inves-
tigation and prosecution of such crimes.

FICATION. 
(a) Section 4002 of the CARES Act (Public 
Law 116–136; 15 U.S.C. 9041) is amended by 
adding at the end the following new para-
graph: 
‘‘(13) BUSINESSES CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING 
NATIONAL

critical to maintaining national security’ in-
cludes businesses that manufacture and 
produce aerospace-related products, civil or

ther defined by the Secretary, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of Defense and the

the preceding sentence, aerospace-related 
products include, but are not limited to, 
components, parts, or systems of aircraft, 
aircraft engines, or appliances for inclusion 
in an aircraft, aircraft engine, or appli-
ance.’’. 
SEC. 402. TRADE OF INJURIOUS SPECIES AND 
SPECIES THAT POSE A RISK TO 
HUMAN HEALTH. 
Section 42 of title 18, United States Code, 
is amended— 
(1) in subsection (a)— 
(A) in paragraph (1)— 
(i) by inserting ‘‘or any interstate trans-
port between States within the continental 
United States,’’ after ‘‘shipment between the 
continental United States, the District of 
Columbia, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United 
States,’’; and 
(ii) by striking ‘‘to be injurious to human 
beings, to the interests of agriculture’’ and 
inserting ‘‘to be injurious to or to transmit 
a pathogen that can cause disease in hu-
mans, to be injurious to the interests of agri-
culture’’; and 
(B) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(6) In the case of an emergency posing a 
significant risk to the health of humans, the 
Secretary of the Interior may designate a 
species by interim final rule. At the time of 
publication of the regulation in the Federal 
Register, the Secretary shall publish therein 
detailed reasons why such regulation is nec-
essary, and in the case that such regulation 
applies to a native species, the Secretary 
shall give actual notice of such regulation to 
the State agency in each State in which such 
species is believed to occur. Any regulation 
promulgated under the authority of this 
paragraph shall cease to have force and ef-
fect at the close of the 365-day period fol-
lowing the date of publication unless, during 
such 365-day period, the rulemaking proce-
dures which would apply to such regulation 
without regard to this paragraph are com-
plied with. If at any time after issuing an 
emergency regulation the Secretary deter-
mines, on the basis of the best appropriate 
data available to the Secretary, that sub-
stantial evidence does not exist to warrant 
such regulation, the Secretary shall with-
draw it. 
‘‘(7) Not more than 90 days after receiving 
a petition of an interested person under sec-
tion 553(e) of title 5, United States Code, to 
determine that a species is injurious under 
this section, the Secretary of the Interior 
shall determine whether such petition has 
scientific merit. If the Secretary determines 
a petition has scientific merit, such Sec-
retary shall make a determination regarding 
such petition not more than 12 months after 
the date such Secretary received such peti-
tion.’’; and 
(2) by amending subsection (b) to read as 
follows: 
‘‘(b) Any person who knowingly imports, 
ships, or transports any species in violation 
of subsection (a) of this section and who rea-
sonably should have known that the species 
at issue in such violation is a species listed

regulation issued pursuant thereto, shall be 
fined under this title or imprisoned not more 
than six months, or both.’’. 
SEC. 403. RESCISSION OF FUNDS. 
Of the unobligated balances available 
under section 4027 of division A of the 
CARES 
Act 
(Public 
Law 
116–136), 
$146,000,000,000 is hereby permanently re-
scinded. 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE): 
S. 4804. A bill to amend the Magnu-
son-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act to add Rhode Island 
to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Manage-
ment Council, and for other purposes; 
to 
the 
Committee 
on 
Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
introducing the Rhode Island Fisher-
men’s Fairness Act of 2020 along with 
my colleague Senator WHITEHOUSE. 
This legislation seeks to address a 
longstanding inequity in our Nation’s 
fisheries management system which 
denies Rhode Islanders a voice in the 
governance of many stocks that local 
fishermen catch and rely upon for their 
livelihoods. 
The Magnuson-Stevens Act granted 
Rhode Island voting membership on 
the New England Fishery Management 
Council (NEFMC), as NEFMC-managed 
stocks represent a significant percent-
age of landings and revenue for the 
State. However, Rhode Island has an 
even larger stake in Mid-Atlantic fish-
eries. Yet, it does not have voting rep-
resentation on the Mid-Atlantic Fish-
ery Management Council (MAFMC), 
which currently consists of representa-
tives from New York, New Jersey, 
Delaware, 
Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, 
Virginia, and North Carolina. 
According to data provided by the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration (NOAA), between 2014 and 
2108, Rhode Island accounted for ap-
proximately a quarter of the commer-
cial landings by value from stocks 
under the MAFMC’s sole jurisdiction, 
and 
its 
commercial 
landings 
were 
greater than the total landings of all of 
the states currently represented on the 
MAFMC with the exception of New Jer-
sey. 
As the rest of the Nation learned dur-
ing the Democratic National Conven-
tion, the Rhode Island State appetizer 
is calamari. That is squid. And while 
squid is our number one landed species, 
Rhode Island doesn’t have a formal say 
in the management of this stock. 
This legislation offers a simple solu-
tion with sound precedent. North Caro-
lina was added to the MAFMC through 
an amendment to the Sustainable Fish-
eries Act in 1996. Like Rhode Island, a 
significant portion of North Carolina’s 
landed fish species were managed by 
the MAFMC, yet the State had no vote 
on the council. Similarly, the Rhode Is-
land Fishermen’s Fairness Act would 
create two seats on the MAFMC for 
Rhode Island: one seat appointed by 
the Secretary of Commerce based on 
recommendations from the Governor of 
Rhode Island, and a second seat filled 
by Rhode Island’s principal State offi-
cial with marine fishery management 
responsibility. To accommodate these 
new members, the MAFMC would in-
crease in size from 21 to 23 voting mem-
bers. In short, Rhode Island would be 
guaranteed the same minimum rep-
resentation as every other State on the 
MAFMC. 
With mounting economic, ecological, 
and regulatory challenges, it is more 
important than ever that Rhode Island 
fishermen have a voice in the manage-
ment of the fisheries they depend on. 
I urge our colleagues to join us in 
supporting this commonsense legisla-
tion.

tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives their written 
declaration that the President is unable to 
discharge the powers and duties of his office, 
the Vice President shall immediately assume 
the powers and duties of the office as Acting 
President.’’; 
Whereas the 25th Amendment was drafted 
in the wake of the death of President John 
F. Kennedy and was intended to provide for 
a clear path of succession in the event of the 
President’s death or inability to discharge 
the powers and duties of his office, and not 
as a political tool to remove a duly elected 
President in the absence of just cause; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives intends to introduce legislation 
creating a Commission on Presidential Ca-
pacity to Discharge the Powers and Duties of 
the Office for the purposes of removing 
President Donald J. Trump from office under 
section 4 of the 25th Amendment; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives has failed to put forward a just 
cause for invoking the 25th Amendment; 
Whereas the proposed actions by the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives are 
an unprecedented attempt to remove a duly 
elected President; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House Rep-
resentatives and the Democratic Caucus of 
the House of Representatives have under-
taken a multi-year campaign to delegitimize 
the duly elected President of the United 
States and overturn the results of the 2016 
Presidential election, and in the course of 
this campaign have wasted taxpayer dollars 
and weaponized House resources, including 
committee and floor time, that could have 
otherwise been used to help the people of the 
United States; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives is politicizing the 25th Amend-
ment and the health of the United States 
President during a global pandemic in order 
to influence the upcoming November elec-
tions; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives has failed to negotiate in good 
faith in regard to providing COVID–19 relief 
to the people of the United States; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives is politicizing the 25th Amend-
ment and the health of the United States 
President in order to increase leverage on 
negotiations involving COVID–19 relief; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives is abusing the power of the 
House of Representatives, violating the in-
tent of the 25th Amendment for political 
purposes, and misusing taxpayer dollars; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives is degrading the office she holds 
and conducting herself in a manner that does 
not reflect creditably on the House of Rep-
resentatives; and 
Whereas, if allowed to stand, this action by 
the Speaker of the House of Representatives 
would set a dangerous precedent for the con-
stitutional system of Government in the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate disapproves of 
the statements and actions of the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Demo-
cratic Caucus of the House of Representa-
tives for politicizing the 25th Amendment of 
the Constitution of the United States.
