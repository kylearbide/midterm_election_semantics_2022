WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 2022 
No. 4 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Sovereign God, these times are in 
Your hands. Incline Your ear to us and 
hear our prayers for our Congress, for 
our Nation, for its people. 
As compatriots, we are too often sep-
arated by politics and perspectives, in-
dividual certainties, and intractable 
opinions. 
On this anniversary of national dis-
cord and despair, send Your healing 
Spirit among us and tend to the dispir-
itedness and disagreement here within 
and around the people’s House. 
This day, into Your hands we com-
mend our spirits of fear, anger, and un-
certainty and ask that You would re-
vive in us our shared commitment to 
this 
country’s 
highest 
ideals, 
its 
strength in its diversity, and its power 
in its defense of the common good. 
On these virtues was our country 
founded and for them countless heroes 
have sacrificed. Remind us, inspire us— 
the aggrieved, the skeptical, the disen-
franchised, all of us—to hold true and 
remain worthy of this noble heritage. 
We offer the words of Abraham Lin-
coln that once again we would emerge 
from our national turmoil: 
With malice toward none and charity for 
all, with firmness in the right, as You give 
us to see the right; to finish the work we are 
in, to bind up the Nation’s wounds; to do all 
which may achieve and cherish a just and 
lasting peace among ourselves. 
Merciful God, restore to us this sa-
cred obligation of unity and moral pur-
pose. Inspire us to live lives which 
serve as a witness to Your restoration 
and reconciliation. 
We pray Your peace over Your peo-
ple. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. MCGOVERN led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to Section 
4(a) of House Resolution 829, no organi-
zational or legislative business will be 
conducted on this day. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will ad-
dress the Chamber. 
Today, one year ago, the Capitol and 
those who work in it were targeted in 
a violent insurrection that sought to 
undermine democracy. 
As we acknowledge the horror of that 
day, we honor the heroism of so many, 
particularly the U.S. Capitol Police; 
and the institutional staff; floor, lead-
ership, committee, and Member staff. 
We had a session this morning where 
we could say thank you to many of 
them. Unfortunately, COVID did not 
enable us to have the full House. We 
will have another time when the at-
tending physician allows. 
As we acknowledge the horror of that 
day, in the face of extreme danger, 
they all risked their safety for our de-
mocracy by protecting the Capitol 
complex, Members, staff, and press 
within; safeguarding the ballots in 
those mahogany boxes to validate the 
election; and ensuring that Congress 
could accomplish our purpose and 
honor our duty to the Constitution and 
to our country. 
That day, and in the days after, they 
were the defenders of our democracy, 
and their courage and patriotism re-
main an inspiration. Because of them, 
Congress was able to defeat the insur-
rection and return to the Capitol that 
same night to ensure that the peaceful 
transfer of power took place. Because 
of them and our Members, the insurrec-
tion failed. 
One year ago, this sacred space— 
where 
Members 
legislate, 
children 
learn, and visitors are welcomed—was 
defiled and damaged. 
As we reflect on that darkest day, we 
remember that the insurrectionists 
sought not only to attack the building 
but to undermine democracy itself. 
When the violent assault was made 
on the Capitol, its purpose was to 
thwart Congress’ constitutional duty 
to validate the electoral count and to 
ensure the peaceful transfer of power. 
But the assault did not deter us from 
our duty. In this Capitol, a symbol of 
democracy to the world, that evening, 
because of the courage of all of you, 
the Congress rose to honor our oath 
and to protect our democracy. 
We did so honoring the words of 
President Lincoln during the Civil War: 
Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. 
We . . . will be remembered in spite of our-
selves. No personal significance, or insignifi-
cance, can spare one or another of us. 
We hold the power; therefore, we bear the 
responsibility. 
Today, we accept a responsibility as 
daunting and demanding as any that 
previous generations of leadership have 
faced. 
Since the January 6 insurrection, 
there have been continued assaults on

our democracy, undermining the sanc-
tity of the vote and the integrity of our 
elections, which are the bases of our 
democracy. 
Let us be true to the vision of our 
Founders, who brilliantly established 
our democracy and made it a model for 
the world. 
Let us honor the sacrifice of our men 
and women in uniform who protect 
that freedom with their lives. 
Let us remember the words of an-
other President, our patriarch, Presi-
dent George Washington, when he de-
livered the Constitution to Congress: 
The Constitution represents the creation 
of a government which would allow for the 
continuation of rigorous debate but relies 
upon the common sense and good faith of the 
American people to find the better angels of 
their nature. 
As we proceed, let us find our com-
mon ground and reach our Nation’s 
heights, with liberty and justice for all, 
remembering the words of our great pa-
triarch and in the spirit that our Chap-
lain referenced of President Lincoln, 
with malice toward none, with charity 
toward all. 
As I conclude, I want to acknowledge 
our fallen heroes of that day: 
U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian 
Sicknick; 
U.S. Capitol Police Officer Howard 
Liebengood; 
Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey 
Smith; 
U.S. Capitol Police Officer Billy 
Evans, of a later assault. 
Now I ask all Members to rise for a 
moment of silence in their memory.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
ANNIVERSARY OF JANUARY 6 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is 
difficult to put into words what it is 
like to stand here on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate on this day of all days. 
For 163 years, this space has been the 
home of the upper Chamber of the 
American Congress. What has taken 
place inside this room over the cen-
turies has determined in very real ways 
the trajectory of our Nation. In this 
room, we carry on the mission handed 
down to us by the Framers to assure 
the voice of the people is heard and 
represented and acted upon. 
But 1 year ago today, on January 6, 
2021, mob violence descended upon this 
Chamber and upon this Capitol. Thou-
sands of rioters, possessed by equal 
measures of rage, conspiracy, and 
spurred into action by the sitting 
President of the United States, at-
tacked the U.S. Capitol in an armed, 
violent, and deadly effort to halt the 
peaceful transfer of power. 
Its windows were smashed. Its offices 
were vandalized. And lawmakers and 
our staffs—everyday citizens who love 
their country and work here every 
day—feared for their lives. Nearly 140 
police officers were injured, and at 
least 5 people lost their lives that day 
or in its aftermath. 
The warnings of history are clear. 
When democracies are in danger, it 
often starts with a mob. That is what 
happened a year ago here in this build-
ing: a mob attack. And for mob vio-
lence to win the day, it doesn’t need 
everyone to join in. It just needs a crit-
ical mass of people to stay out of the 
way, to ignore it, to underestimate it, 
to excuse it and even condone it. 
The mob can start out as a small 
number, but if it is allowed to grow and 
leaders egg on the mob, encourage it, it 
can become poison. That is what Don-
ald Trump is doing, as even his re-
sponse to President Biden’s speech 
today showed. And once that happens, 
the unthinkable could become real. De-
mocracy erodes and could, God forbid— 
God forbid, horror of horrors—vanish. 
The poisonous mob mentality lives 
on today in the threats against elec-
tion workers, poll workers, even other 
public servants like school board mem-
bers and health workers. This is what 
erodes 
a 
democracy. 
And 
Donald 
Trump today continues to spread his 
poisonous vile about the Big Lie. 
To borrow from President Franklin 
Roosevelt, the violent insurrection of 
January 6 was a day that will live for-
ever in infamy, a permanent stain in 
the story of the American democracy 
and the final bitter, unforgivable act of 
the worst President in modern times. 
Today, on this first anniversary, 
Members from both the House and Sen-
ate and our staffs, the President, and 
the Vice President are here today at 
the Capitol, and one of our purposes is 
to share memories in commemoration 
of that day. At noon we will hold a mo-
ment of silence in honor of those who 
were lost because of the attack. 
And to all my colleagues and to staff 
who struggle to get through today, you 
are not alone. You are not alone. We 
are here by your side. The Employee 
Assistance 
Program 
has 
resources 
available to all Senate staff who are 
processing what happened a year ago. 
Let me share my personal experience 
on that day. As I have recounted many 
times since then, my personal experi-
ence that day was, in some ways, like

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S56 
January 6, 2022 
the opening sentence of Charles Dick-
ens’ ‘‘A Tale of Two Cities’’: the best of 
times, the worst of times. 
First came the best of times. Twelve 
hours before the attack, at 4 a.m. in 
the morning, I learned—or several 
hours before the attack, at 4 a.m., I 
learned that our two Democratic Sen-
ators had won in Georgia and we would 
gain the majority. 
At 4 a.m. it became clear. I tried to 
get some sleep, couldn’t, got down in 
my car, drove to Washington, and got 
to the floor of this Chamber at 1 p.m., 
for the first time as the putative ma-
jority leader. 
Within 45 minutes of sitting there 
and watching the beginning of count-
ing the ballots, a police officer in a big 
flak jacket and a large rifle grabbed me 
firmly by the collar like this—I will 
never forget that grip—and said to me: 
‘‘Senator, we’ve got to get out of here. 
You’re in danger.’’ 
We walked out the Senate Chamber 
door, made a right turn, went through 
another door. This happened to be cap-
tured on the videotape above, and it 
was shown at the impeachment trial, 
although I didn’t even know they had 
the tape until I saw it at the impeach-
ment trial. But we go through the door. 
You don’t see us for 20 seconds. And 
then we are running out of the door at 
full speed. 
I was within 30 feet of these nasty, 
racist, bigoted insurrectionists. Had 
someone had a gun, had two of them 
blocked off the door, who knows what 
would have happened. I was told later 
that one of them reportedly said: 
‘‘There’s the big Jew. Let’s get him.’’ 
Bigotry 
against 
one 
is 
bigotry 
against all. And I saw something that I 
had been told later never happened be-
fore—the Confederate flag flying in 
this dear Capitol. That is just one of 
many searing, grotesque images of that 
unimaginable, most un-American day. 
There were good moments too. I re-
member when the leaders—Senator 
MCCONNELL, myself, Speaker PELOSI, 
Leader MCCARTHY—were sent off to the 
secret place. We convened after des-
perately trying to get the President on 
the phone to ask him to call the rioters 
off. We spoke to the Secretary of De-
fense and the Acting Attorney General, 
but to no avail. But then the four of us 
got together and said: We are going to 
come back. We are going to count 
those votes. We are not going to let the 
violent insurrectionists stop us. And 
count the votes we did until, I believe 
it was 3 a.m. the next morning. That 
was the moment, amidst a lot of bad 
moments. 
So now we ask 1 year later, how shall 
our country move forward? What are 
we to say and think and do in response 
to a day when a sitting American 
President, rather than step down from 
office, unleashed his own supporters to 
attack the government through mob 
violence? How can we help those 
scarred by that day find solace, find 
healing? How can we make clear to the 
American people, to the world, and 
even to ourselves that our democracy 
is still whole? 
First, we must begin by commemo-
rating our emergency responders who 
have died, whether through complica-
tions from injuries or, sadly, through 
suicide in the days and months after 
the violence: Brian Sicknick of New 
Jersey; Howie Liebengood of Virginia; 
Billy Evans of Massachusetts; Jeffrey 
Smith of Illinois; and Gunther Hashida 
of Virginia. Today and every day, we 
remember them; we mourn their loss; 
we honor their limitless heroism in the 
face of the unthinkable. 
Second, we also thank every single 
member of the Capitol Police, the DC 
Metro Police, and the National Guard, 
who kept us safe and prevented a vio-
lent riot from turning into something 
much worse. That afternoon, our Cap-
itol Police were outnumbered, unpre-
pared, and largely left on their own. 
Just watching on television the brutal 
beating of one of them by the mob, an-
other being crushed between a door and 
a wall, just rips your heart apart. You 
relive that day, and you remember how 
the Capitol Police suffered but per-
sisted and helped preserve our democ-
racy. When they held the line, our de-
mocracy survived. So not only do we 
thank them but we commit to continue 
supporting them and fighting for them 
as they fought to defend this building. 
Finally, the only way we will truly 
move forward from January 6 is by 
speaking truth to power—we cannot 
avoid it—the truth about what hap-
pened that day, about what led to the 
violence, and about what it means for 
our democracy moving forward. 
I say this because too many—often 
depending on their allegiances—seem 
desperate to sweep the memory of Jan-
uary 6 under the rug. Too many are 
working to rewrite the history of what 
happened, to downplay or excuse or 
even defend the mob, to excuse an in-
surrection of this very Capitol. Too 
many are hoping the American people 
will just look away and forget that day 
ever took place. After all, they say, 
Donald Trump is no longer President, 
right? That can’t happen. We can’t let 
that happen. We have an obligation not 
to let that happen because history 
shows us that when you ignore or paint 
over this kind of violent action, it will 
recur, often in worse form than it had 
originally. That is what history shows. 
We didn’t look away after the attack 
on Pearl Harbor. We didn’t look away 
after the attacks on 9/11. They may 
have been from foreign powers, but we 
still—just because it was Americans 
who did this, we cannot look away 
after the attack of January 6. What we 
must do instead is stare the truth, 
however ugly, in the face: The attack 
of January 6 didn’t come out of the 
blue. It was not an act of God. It was 
not something that came from foreign 
soil. It wasn’t even just some mere pro-
test that got out of hand. No, no, no, 
no, no. January 6 was an attempt to re-
verse, through violent means, the out-
come of a free and fair election, an in-
surrection—call it what it is, what it 
was. It was fundamentally rooted in 
Donald Trump’s Big Lie that the elec-
tion of 2020 was illegitimate, in deep of-
fense 
to 
the 
peaceful 
transfer 
of 
power—indeed, in deep offense to the 
very notion of truth itself. 
Anyone who thinks that the origins 
of this insurrection are going away 
should just have listened a few mo-
ments ago when Donald Trump did it 
again—lying and lying and lying about 
the election, a clear reminder of the 
threat that he and his lie remain to our 
Nation. 
Alarmingly—alarmingly—many 
of 
his supporters quickly embraced the lie 
in the aftermath of the 2020 election. 
Many of them truly believed and still 
believe that he won the election and 
the game was rigged—not a small num-
ber, large numbers of Americans; if you 
look at polls, tens of millions. 
It didn’t matter there was no proof to 
any of these claims. Donald Trump 
kept saying it and saying it and saying 
it again. And he called his supporters 
to rally here in Washington in a last- 
ditch effort to stay in power. We all 
know this. That is what happened. We 
can’t forget it. 
It was Donald Trump’s Big Lie that 
soaked our political landscape in ker-
osene. It was Donald Trump’s rally on 
The Mall that struck the match. Then 
came the fire. And pouring gasoline on 
that fire are many in one branch of our 
media who spread the Big Lie then and 
continue to spread the Big Lie even 
though they know it is false, and mil-
lions listen to these people and believe 
it. 
Here, too, is another terrible truth: 
The disease of the Big Lie continues to 
this day. The attacks on our democ-
racy are ongoing, if not by the force of 
baseball bats and pipe bombs, then cer-
tainly through a quieter and much 
more organized effort to subvert de-
mocracy from the bottom up. 
Just as the Big Lie inspired the at-
tack of January 6, the Big Lie con-
tinues like a disease across State legis-
latures throughout the country, where 
we are seeing the most restrictive 
voter suppression efforts since Jim 
Crow—since Jim Crow—in 21st-century 
America, turning the clock way back. 
Let’s be abundantly clear. These new 
anti-voter laws are on the books today 
only because their authors cited the 
Big Lie, cited the fictitious bugaboo of 
voter fraud and are trying to succeed 
where the insurrection failed. 
Unless we confront the Big Lie, un-
less we all do our part to fortify and 
strengthen our democracy, the polit-
ical violence of January 6 risks becom-
ing not an aberration but, God forbid, 
the norm. And we have seen it, too, 
with the threats against election work-
ers, teachers, school administrators, 
healthcare workers. We cannot put our 
heads in the sand. We cannot brush this 
over. 
What does that mean for the Senate? 
I think we have to talk about the reali-
ties here today too. It means we must

January 6, 2022 
pass legislation, effective legislation, 
to defend our democracy, to protect 
the right to vote. We must pass the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act and the Freedom to Vote Act 
so that our country’s destiny is deter-
mined by the voice of the people and 
not by the violent whims of lies and 
even mob rule. We must also guard 
against the false hopes of solutions 
that don’t deal with the problem, that 
try to cover it up or push it away be-
cause people don’t want to deal with it. 
Some say the answer lies in doing the 
bare minimum, like reforming the 
Electoral Count Act that my friend the 
Republican leader has floated in recent 
days. Let me take this opportunity to 
make clear that that plan, the McCon-
nell plan—that is what it is—is unac-
ceptably insufficient and even offen-
sive. Scorekeeping matters little if the 
game is rigged. 
As we know too well, State legisla-
tures are working day and night to un-
dermine our democratic process from 
the get-go by empowering partisans to 
potentially say which ballots count 
and which do not. What good is it to 
accurately count a result that is com-
promised from the start? 
Senator MCCONNELL’s plan to reform 
the Electoral Count Act would do noth-
ing more than codify the Vice Presi-
dent’s ceremonial role in the counting 
of the electoral college votes, effec-
tively 
guaranteeing 
that 
partisan 
State legislatures could overturn the 
elections without fear of recourse. 
Look at what it does. Look at what it 
does. It is a cynical idea. It is an idea 
to divert attention from the real issue 
because they don’t want to confront 
the real issue. 
This cannot be. This should not be 
about one party versus another. Voting 
rights have always been bipartisan— 
supported by Bush, H.W., and W., sup-
ported by Reagan—passing this Cham-
ber with large votes from both sides of 
the aisle. That is what always used to 
happen until the Republican Party was 
taken over by Donald Trump. 
So it is not about one party versus 
another. It can’t be. It is about one ter-
rible lie against democracy itself, the 
kind of lie that, if let stand both ver-
bally and in action, erodes our democ-
racy—erodes our democracy. 
If a majority of people—there is al-
ready a substantial minority who don’t 
believe our elections are legitimate, 
aided and egged on by Donald Trump 
and rightwing media. What if a major-
ity of this country, because of these 
pernicious actions, starts believing it? 
A majority of Americans don’t believe 
that elections are on the level? Just 
ask yourself what will happen. I can’t 
predict the details, but I can predict 
that it will diminish the greatness of 
this country in small and even large 
ways. 
So we cannot—this should not be a 
partisan issue. It is about falsehood 
versus truth. In the history of this 
country, we have always disagreed on 
ideology but never on facts until re-
cently and in such an important area. 
If lying about results of an election is 
acceptable, 
if 
instigating 
a 
mob 
against the government is considered 
permissible, if encouraging political vi-
olence becomes the norm, it will be 
open season on this grand democracy, 
this noble experiment, and everything 
will be up for grabs by whoever has the 
biggest clubs, the sharpest spears, the 
most effective lies. 
I do not believe that is the ultimate 
destiny of our country. The mob may 
be strong, but the counter is stronger— 
the roots of democracy, the feelings of 
the American people. And the affection 
and love for this grand, noble experi-
ment in democracy are stronger as 
long as we speak out, as long as we act. 
The wellspring of democracy is deep, 
and even in the most difficult of times, 
Americans have rallied and risen to the 
occasion. Since the early days of our 
Republic, Americans launched mighty 
movements, fought a bloody civil war, 
and, yes, passed Federal election laws 
and voting rights laws to expand the 
promise of democracy until there were 
no more boundaries. 
We are called on, importuned by the 
millions who have lost their lives, to 
defend this democracy, to defend it 
once again. I call on all Americans— 
Democrats, 
Republicans, 
Independ-
ents—to rise to the occasion and en-
sure that the mob, the violence, the 
lies do not win the day. Let the anni-
versary of January 6 forever serve as a 
reminder that the march to perfect our 
democracy is never over; that our de-
mocracy is a precious, sometimes frag-
ile gift, purchased by those who strug-
gled before us and that all of us now 
must do our part to keep the American 
vision going in the present and into the 
future. 
Somehow, in ways I can’t predict but 
I know are true, I am certain that 
God’s mysterious hand will guide us, 
and truth and right will prevail. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Sen-
ator SCHUMER, for your leadership and 
your work and your words today. 
As I stand here, I look at the faces of 
the staff. I remember the moment 
when we were pushed out of this Cham-
ber for security reasons. I remember 
the words of one staff member, Leigh, 
who yelled out: Take the boxes. Take 
the boxes. She was talking about the 
mahogany boxes that were filled with 
the electoral ballots because we knew 
they would be destroyed if they were 
left behind. 
I remember my own staff—one of 
them is here today—hearing their sto-
ries of being in a closet, hiding in a 
closet with only forks that happened to 
be next door to protect themselves, 
right next to the doors where the in-
surrectionists had invaded. 
I remember the staff throughout this 
building who were marooned in places 
and the faces of the police officers, the 
cuts on their faces, the anguish, and 
the words of Officer Dunn, who said, at 
the end of the day, that he had been 
called the N-word multiple times and 
that he had looked to his friends, as 
they collapsed in the Rotunda, and 
said: ‘‘Is this America?’’ 
‘‘Is this America?’’ 
The haunting words of the police offi-
cer on the police radio that was heard 
broadcast in the middle of the whole 
thing: ‘‘Is there a plan?’’ 
‘‘Is there a plan?’’ 
There were many breakdowns that 
day, but the biggest breakdown was the 
breakdown of our democracy; that 
some people actually felt that they 
could take the law into their own 
hands; that they could invade not just 
a building but our very Republic. 
I look back at the words and the 
speeches that people gave that day, not 
only after the insurrection, but what 
was telling was what they said before 
it started. I think I would urge people 
to look at those speeches. That discus-
sion that we were having about this 
had been raging for weeks and for 
months. 
I remember standing at this very 
place right before we closed down the 
Senate because of the insurrection and 
going through the facts—going through 
the facts about how President-Elect 
Biden at the time had won more votes 
than any President in history; the 
facts that 10 living Defense Secretaries 
had actually stood up at the time, in-
cluding both of Donald Trump’s De-
fense Secretaries, including people like 
Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and 
William Cohen, and came together and 
said that the scurrilous attacks on our 
democracy must stop, and we must 
allow for the peaceful transition of 
power. 
Then I looked at the very end of my 
remarks, and I ended with this right 
before we were invaded. I said this: 
My friend Roy Blunt— 
Whom I still have immense respect 
for what he did that evening. 
My friend Roy Blunt, my fellow Rules 
Committee leader, many years ago, found a 
statue, a bust of a man at the top of a book-
case. He did research. He went to the histo-
rians. [And][a]ll he could find out was that 
no one knew who this guy was except that he 
was a cleric. Hence, the statue is called ‘‘The 
Unknown Cleric.’’ 
Now, at the time, our leaders [in this great 
place] thought this man important enough 
that they would warrant a statue for him, 
but today no one knows who he is. Senator 
Blunt’s message to schoolkids and Senators 
alike that visit his office, when he shows 
them the statue: What we do here is more 
important than who we are. 
And I ended with this: 
Senators, what matters is not our futures, 
not our short-term destinies. 
What matters is our democracy’s destiny 
because I think many of us know [that] peo-
ple will not know who we are 100 years from 
now or 200 years from now, but what they 
will know is this: They will know what we 
did today, how we voted today. [And] that is 
more important than who we are. [As some-
one once said,] [i]t is a Republic, if we can 
keep it. 
‘‘It is a Republic, if we can keep it.’’ 
Those words ring more true now than

January 6, 2022 
they did a year ago because, as we 
know, the haunting shrieks of the po-
lice that day, the officer pinned be-
tween the doors at the hands of riot-
ers—there were people who stood up for 
our Republic, and there were people 
who attacked our Republic. 
I remember Captain Carneysha Men-
doza, a 19-year veteran of the Capitol 
Police, who testified before the Rules 
Committee, 
who 
suffered 
chemical 
burns to her face while commanding 
the officers in the Rotunda while they 
struggled to hold the doors open. 
Who can forget Officer Eugene Good-
man, who after saving Senator ROMNEY 
from walking directly into the mob, 
ran by himself to take on a group of ri-
oters with his baton and then diverted 
that mob away from the Senate Cham-
ber, allowing us to safely depart? 
Mr. President, who can forget the 
image right there where you sit on 
that dais of the insurrectionists rifling 
through papers on people’s desks, open-
ing up their offices and desks? 
Tragically, five officers who reported 
for duty have since passed away—five 
officers. You wonder why you see sad 
faces today on many people in this 
building who were their friends. Cap-
itol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died 
the day after the attack. Four other of-
ficers died in the days and months that 
followed—Capitol Police Officer How-
ard Liebengood, DC Metropolitan Po-
lice Officers Jeffrey Smith, Gunther 
Hashida, and Kyle DeFreytag. 
Many more suffered physical injuries 
and even more sustained emotional 
trauma from the events of that day. We 
also remember, of course, Officer Billy 
Evans, who tragically died doing his 
job at his post in April. 
Recognizing the sacrifice of those he-
roes to defend our democracy is the 
least we can do. Senator BLUNT and I 
led legislation, with the support our 
leaders, honoring those who protected 
the Capitol on January 6 with the Con-
gressional Gold Medal. It was an honor 
to stand with officers and their fami-
lies in August as President Biden 
signed this bill into law. 
We have made many, many improve-
ments to the security of the Capitol. I 
think it is very important for staff and 
officers alike and those who work there 
to know that. 
I want to thank Senator SCHUMER for 
his work in installing a new Sergeant 
at Arms, Karen Gibson, for the Senate. 
We have General Walker over in the 
House, and we have a new Police Chief, 
Chief Manger, who did an excellent job 
yesterday in describing the changes. 
We know there are many challenges 
ahead. 
Last, but not least, is that we do not 
have enough police officers right now 
to fill vacancies so people are working 
double shifts; they are working vaca-
tions; they are canceling vacations. We 
have over 400 openings, an experience 
that many police departments through-
out the country have right now, but 
one that is very important, and the 
Chief has committed to fill those va-
cancies. 
But what have we done, the progress? 
Well, we have, one, gotten new per-
sonnel in. Two, we have passed a law in 
this Chamber and signed into law by 
President Biden that makes it easier 
for the Chief to call in the National 
Guard in the case of emergency. We 
have made sure that there are oper-
ational plans in place as there were 
this summer when major events occur. 
One of the saddest memories of that 
day was the fact that 75 percent of the 
police officers asked to defend this 
Capitol were in plain clothes—75 per-
cent. In many cases, they had less pro-
tective gear on than the invaders of the 
Capitol. That has changed—no more 
equipment that is going to be locked 
on a bus that they can’t access. With 
Senator LEAHY’s leadership with Ap-
propriations 
and 
Senator 
SHELBY’s 
leadership, we have been able to obtain 
more funding to get them the equip-
ment that they need. All of those 
things are important. 
But as Senator SCHUMER noted, the 
other piece of this is our democracy 
itself. And that means getting to the 
bottom of what happened. Something 
is happening right now with the House 
Select Committee that is working to 
get the facts. We would have loved to 
have an independent Commission like 
the 9/11 Commission to do that, but 
they are doing that work over in the 
House. 
Yesterday, we heard from Attorney 
General Garland, who pledged to look 
at this at every level and to go where 
the facts will lead. Those were his 
words. Accountability at every level 
for what happened here is key, and it is 
the largest investigation we have seen 
in the history of America. Over 700 peo-
ple have been charged. That is a big 
piece of this work as well—account-
ability. 
As Senator SCHUMER noted, this is 
also about carrying on the torch of our 
democracy. The voting rights legisla-
tion that we are working on right now 
couldn’t be more important because 
what was not accomplished with bear 
spray and bayonets has now been 
passed on to others to pass bills as we 
have seen in Wisconsin, where a bill ac-
tually passed that would have allowed 
for only one ballot dropoff box in the 
entire city of Milwaukee. That one was 
vetoed by Governor Evers. But others 
have passed in States like Georgia, in 
States like Texas. And across this 
country is a concerted effort to under-
mine our democracy. 
So it is on us, when we take an oath 
to defend the Constitution of the 
United States, no matter what party 
we are in, to hold our democracy dear. 
It is a precious, precious thing and it is 
very fragile and it is in our hands to 
protect, just as our police officers pro-
tected it on January 6. 
When you have 9,600 threats against 
Members of Congress—double what it 
has ever been in the past—that is not a 
small thing; that is January 6 contin-
ued. When you have election officials 
who have to leave their posts because, 
in the words of the election official 
from the city of Philadelphia, his own 
family was threatened, their names, 
their addresses, their house put out on 
the internet; Katie Hobbs, secretary of 
state in Arizona, receiving a voice mail 
saying: ‘‘I am a hunter—and I think 
you should be hunted;’’ people in rural 
areas who are elected officials who can-
not have the kind of security that peo-
ple may have in this building—that is 
January 6 continued. 
And we cannot forget our duty going 
forward. I will end with that image 
that I will always cherish and the hope 
that democracy will prevail. At 3:30 in 
the morning, when Senator BLUNT and 
I and Vice President Pence took that 
long walk over to the House with the 
two young women with the mahogany 
box filled with the last of the electoral 
ballots up through Wyoming—there 
was broken glass on all sides; there was 
spray paint on statues. It was the same 
walk we had taken in the morning, 
which had been so joyful, the celebra-
tion of our democracy, so ceremonial— 
and there we were, the last ones left 
taking that walk into the House Cham-
bers where we finished our job. So 
when I look back at that day, that is 
the lasting image; that in the end, de-
mocracy prevailed. 
Two weeks later, there we were under 
that beautiful blue sky with leaders of 
both parties on that inaugural stage 
saying that, yes, our democracy stood 
tall. It brushed itself off, and we moved 
forward as one Nation under God, with 
liberty and justice for all, as we always 
do. And that is the spirit with which 
we must go forward in the coming 
weeks as we debate the importance— 
the importance—of keeping that de-
mocracy strong with election laws; 
that we continue to improve the secu-
rity in this Capitol; and that we hold 
the people who did this not just to us, 
not just to this building but to our 
very Republic—accountable for what 
they did. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, these are 
among the most somber and sorrowful 
remarks that I have had to make as 
President pro tempore and also my sev-
eral decades of service in this body. 
What an unthinkable event it is that 
we are marking today—an attempted 
coup incited not against a President 
but by a President, who promoted and 
still promotes a litany of lies to over-
turn the results of the election in order 
for him to hold on to power that he no 
longer possesses. We are in the business 
of words, but there are none to ade-
quately capture the damage that he 
and his henchmen have done and are 
doing to our country. 
I am certain that no one serving here 
ever thought such an attack on our de-
mocracy by a violent insurrectionist 
mob who stormed the Capitol—the very 
citadel of our democracy—could ever 
happen in our beloved country, the 
world’s most enduring democracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S59 
January 6, 2022 
This very Chamber where we are 
gathered today was breached. It was 
desecrated as was the rest of the Cap-
itol. 
This morning, in my capacity as 
President pro tempore, I called the 
Senate into session. As I looked around 
the Chamber, so many memories came 
to mind. I first saw this Senate Cham-
ber as a teenager, visiting from our 
home in Montpelier, VT, with my par-
ents and my sister, coming to this Cap-
itol. 
And then later as a Georgetown law 
student, I would sit in the Visitors’ 
Gallery and just watch. I saw the Mem-
bers of the Senate in both parties 
speaking to the conscience of our Na-
tion—the conscience of our Nation— 
and trying to protect our Constitution. 
In 1975, I came onto the floor of the 
Senate as the junior-most Member of 
this body. I was in awe of the Senate 
then. I never expected to become the 
dean of the Senate. 
But a year ago, I sat on the floor of 
the Senate as Vice President Pence was 
announcing the certification of ballots. 
I saw him doing this in a straight-
forward and honest way, even though 
he knew that, at the end of the count, 
he would soon no longer be Vice Presi-
dent nor would Donald Trump be Presi-
dent. 
We were all in the Senate paying at-
tention when suddenly officers came 
rushing onto the floor, and they took 
the Vice President off the dais and out 
the door. CHUCK GRASSLEY, the then- 
President pro tem, went to the dais and 
prepared to recess the Senate. 
As for most of us, I remember look-
ing around here. We were wondering 
what was happening, until I saw 2 feet 
from me a man wearing a vest that 
said ‘‘police’’ on the Senate floor. He 
was carrying a submachine gun. I had 
never seen anything like this in the 
U.S. Senate. And you recall the police 
rushed us to the back door to the base-
ment of the Capitol, and they shuttled 
us off to a secure location. I was still 
trying to sort through my mind what 
was happening. 
Officers were going through the halls. 
And one officer came along, took my 
arm, and said: ‘‘We’re going to watch 
out for you, Shamrock.’’ 
So many memories flooded back be-
cause Shamrock was the police code 
name for me when I was a recipient of 
a deadly anthrax letter addressed to 
me that killed and maimed others. 
Ahead of me I could see the brave Par-
liamentarians, and others had grabbed 
the cases with the certification of bal-
lots. They also grabbed an ivory gavel 
that is right in front of you now, the 
same gavel I used today to call the 
Senate into session. 
And when we were in the secure room 
and were starting to see the television, 
we saw a mob, Americans who turned 
into a mob and turned their back on 
our Nation’s constitutional history. 
They were rejecting everything that 
made America great. They were ignor-
ing our laws, our customs, and, most of 
all, they were ignoring our history. 
The destruction and rampage was 
something you would see in a movie. I 
never expected to see it in the Capitol, 
a building that has always been a sym-
bol of our democracy. 
A suggestion was made when we were 
in the secure room that we use our au-
thority under the law to vote and make 
the secure room the Senate Chamber. I 
said: No, we should not be hiding here. 
As soon as we are safe to go back to the 
Senate, whenever it is, we should go 
back there, all of us, and have the 
American people see us there. 
I said: It may take an hour, it may 
take 10 hours, but we should be there 
carrying out the Constitution and say-
ing no criminals can destroy our his-
tory, our Constitution, our America. 
And I was relieved when virtually all 
of the Republicans and Democrats who 
were in that room stood and said loud-
ly that they agreed with me and that 
we would wait until we went back. 
I was standing next to the Parlia-
mentarian and the leather boxes car-
rying the certification of election. We 
both looked at them, and I am sure we 
were both thinking the same thing: We 
will protect our Constitution. We will 
protect the Senate. We will protect 
America. 
To the credit of the Members of the 
Senate and the House, we reconvened 
after the siege. We fulfilled our con-
stitutional duties to certify the con-
firmed results of the election—results 
that every State and Federal court has 
upheld in the face of blatantly frivo-
lous challenges. 
So my thoughts today are not only 
about how fragile our democracy is but 
about the heroes of the day: the Cap-
itol Police officers, some of whom lost 
their lives or suffered grievous and en-
during injuries; and those who joined 
in the Capitol’s defense, especially 
from the Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment. 
That day, 1 year ago, was such a sad 
and wrenching day. So disturbing was 
it to see such hatred—hatred and 
anger—to see the Confederate battle 
flag paraded in the Capitol, where it 
never was brought, even during the 
Civil War, and to see Nazi emblems and 
other symbols of hate and violence car-
ried by some of those in the mob. 
It was so horrifying to see our brave 
police officers, many of them war vet-
erans who defended America in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, not just disregarded 
and disrespected but brutally attacked, 
even by the wielding of poles bearing 
the American flag used as bludgeons 
and spears. 
In the aftermath, the National Guard 
from several of our States were called 
in to protect the Capitol. I visited with 
members of the Vermont National 
Guard. I know that many other Sen-
ators did that with their States’ Guard 
troops. 
In the moment, that night, and the 
next day, Senators on both sides of the 
aisle called this out for the travesty 
that it was, but amnesia has set in 
since then in some quarters. There has 
been a concerted effort to downplay or 
grossly mischaracterize the terrible 
events of that day by some Members in 
both Chambers of Congress. It was not, 
as has been said, ‘‘just another day in 
January’’—what an insult to those who 
lost their lives and to those who suf-
fered injuries from which they still 
struggle to recover. 
The question begs and answers itself: 
What are we in the Senate here for, if 
not to defend the Republic and our 
Constitution? 
There is a clear need for justice, and 
the courts are doing their essential 
work. There is a clear need to know the 
truth, and even some of the former 
President’s closest supporters are heed-
ing their duty to respond to the bipar-
tisan congressional investigation into 
what happened that day. 
There will be a clear need to learn 
the lessons, to safeguard and strength-
en our democracy, to protect those who 
serve and protect the Capitol and those 
who work here. 
The courts are dealing with these 
crimes, but it is detestable how so 
many were so callously used as cannon 
fodder. Their actions were wrong, but 
many believed they were acting as pa-
triots. The former President told them 
so and egged them on, and they be-
lieved him. 
Meanwhile, he and so many of his 
cronies, unlike many of his followers 
who stormed the Capitol, have paid no 
price for their roles. They must be held 
accountable for planning and pro-
moting this travesty and, in his case, 
doing nothing to stop the assault, even 
when appealed to, repeatedly, by his 
closest advisers. 
The New York Times has observed 
our Nation faces an existential threat 
from a movement that is openly con-
temptuous of democracy and has shown 
a willingness to use violence to achieve 
its end. No self-governing society can 
survive such a threat by denying it ex-
ists. To deny it is to be complicit in 
what happened. 
But, more than anything else, today 
is a day to remember, to feel sorrow 
that our great Nation ever suffered 
such violence and division, to mourn 
those who died and were injured and to 
mark the day as history will: the first 
time in 244 years that our exceptional 
country was almost prevented from 
carrying out a peaceful transfer of 
power, a sacred principle, a tradition in 
which we have taken pride for genera-
tions and which we have taken for 
granted throughout our entire lives 
and that we have held up as an example 
to people everywhere. 
Now, our job in Congress is different 
than the prosecutors’ roles. Democracy 
needs a foundation, and that founda-
tion is nothing less than the truth. It 
has been said that trust in the rule of 
law is built in drops and lost in buck-
ets. 
Our job is fundamental: Defend and 
advance the truth. Protect the rule of 
law itself. And as dean of this body, 
that is what I will do until the day I 
walk off this floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S60 
January 6, 2022 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip and Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a year 
ago today, we witnessed one of the 
worst assaults on our democracy in liv-
ing memory. For those of us who were 
in the Chamber—that includes vir-
tually every Senator—there are images 
which are emblazoned in our memory. 
Mine, like others, was of a Vice Presi-
dent sitting, where you are sitting, who 
shortly after 2 p.m. in the afternoon 
was pulled off of the dais by two of his 
security detail and hurried out that 
door. It is an unusual thing to happen 
under any circumstances, but while we 
were counting the electoral college re-
turns, it was amazing and unprece-
dented. 
Then they came up and the Capitol 
Police instructed us: Stay at your 
desk. This is going to be a secure room. 
We are going to start bringing in all 
the staff, and they will be lining the 
walls here. We will keep you safe. 
Well, we all sat there in anticipation 
of the next thing to happen and, not 10 
minutes later, another Capitol police-
man came up and said: That last direc-
tive is off. Evacuate this body, this 
room, as quickly and orderly as pos-
sible. 
And we all started piling out the 
doors. As we left and went down the 
exit stairways just outside the doors of 
this Chamber, I looked out the window 
and saw a sea of Trump signs con-
verging on the Capitol. It was an image 
I won’t forget. 
We went to what we considered to be 
a safe location and witnessed over tele-
vision what most of America was 
watching. 
How serious was it? Well, one mis-
guided soul, a Republican Congressman 
from Georgia, said it was just a group 
of tourists—tourists—in the Capitol. 
Yesterday, the Attorney General of 
the United States, Merrick Garland, 
had a press conference and remarked 
on the first anniversary of January 6. 
And among the things he said was this: 
All of the investigations—the criminal 
investigations of what happened that 
day—have 
disclosed 
some 
horrible 
things: evidence of perpetrators punch-
ing dozens of law enforcement officers, 
knocking them unconscious. Some per-
petrators tackled and dragged law en-
forcement officers. Among the many 
examples of such violence, one officer 
was crushed in a door, another was 
dragged down a set of stairs facedown, 
repeatedly tased and beaten, and suf-
fered a heart attack. 
Some perpetrators attacked law en-
forcement 
officers 
with 
chemical 
agents, burning their eyes and skins. 
We saw it—didn’t we?—spraying the 
bear spray in the faces of these officers. 
Some assaulted officers with pipes 
and poles and other dangerous and 
deadly weapons. Perpetrators targeted, 
assaulted, tackled, and harassed jour-
nalists, destroying their equipment, 
and that launched the most com-
prehensive and perhaps largest crimi-
nal prosecution in the history of this 
Nation. 
According to the Attorney General, 
725 individuals have been charged with 
a Federal crime, and 145 pled guilty al-
ready to Federal misdemeanors. Over 
325 have been charged with felonies, 
many for assaulting officers and many 
for corruptly obstructing or attempt-
ing to obstruct an official proceeding. 
Twenty defendants charged with felo-
nies have already pled guilty, and the 
investigation continues. 
They talked about the assistance 
they received: over 300,000 tips from or-
dinary citizens to help our government 
bring to justice those responsible for 
January 6. I say that because I listened 
in disbelief to the polling data which 
suggests that it really wasn’t an attack 
on the Capitol; it was only a visit of 
tourists who were in an orderly fashion 
visiting this building. The videos don’t 
lie. The facts are the facts. 
Individuals are paying a criminal 
price, and their lives will be changed 
because of their bad decisions to leave 
the Trump rally and follow his instruc-
tions to come up to this building. That 
is the reality of what happened that 
day. 
But the grimmest reality was the 
death of five of our law enforcement of-
ficials, who have been named and 
should be named every time we stand 
on this floor—Officer Brian Sicknick, 
Officer Howard Liebengood, Officer Jef-
frey Smith, Officer Gunther Hashida, 
and Officer Kyle DeFreytag—and 140 
other law enforcement officials who 
were assaulted, many of them seri-
ously, and are still paying the price for 
that day in their lives when they stood 
in defense of us, in defense of this 
building. 
That is the reality, and if nothing 
more comes of this speech, commemo-
ration today, I hope that all of us, re-
gardless of our political persuasion— 
the most conservative Republican to 
the most progressive Democrat, Inde-
pendents in between; Black, White, and 
Brown; men and women; rural, urban 
across America, will finally come to 
agreement on one thing: Violence has 
no place in a democracy. 
Those who resort to violence, wher-
ever they fit on the political spectrum, 
do not fit on that spectrum, do not be-
long in this country. And what we saw 
a year ago today was violence unbri-
dled, violence provoked by a former 
President of the United States, and 
many innocent people paid a price. 
I listened as the President and Vice 
President spoke this morning in Stat-
uary Hall. It was a somber and mean-
ingful occasion, as they talked about 
what was at stake on January 6 and 
the challenge we face today. And I 
thought for a moment what a dif-
ference it would have made, in fact, as 
the President spoke, if Republican and 
Democratic leaders stood by his side, 
but that was not to be the case. 
You see, when the proposal was made 
for a bipartisan commission of Demo-
crats and Republicans—commissions 
we have seen in the past, from 9/11 and 
other events that marked our history— 
that was stopped by Senator MCCON-
NELL, the Republican leader of the Sen-
ate, by the threat of a filibuster. 
He wouldn’t agree to a bipartisan 
commission to look into the origins of 
January 6 and what we need to do to 
avoid them in the future. So I want to 
salute Speaker PELOSI for organizing a 
bipartisan committee in the U.S. House 
of 
Representatives, 
who 
is 
inves-
tigating this matter. 
I want to salute my fellow Congress-
man from Illinois, ADAM
KINZINGER, 
who has had the courage to step for-
ward and be part of it, as well as Con-
gresswoman LIZ CHENEY of Wyoming 
and the Democrats who are part of that 
effort. They are serving this Nation as 
they should: bringing forth the facts, 
fighting the resistance from those who 
don’t want to tell the truth. 
But there is more that we must do. It 
has been mentioned several times and 
bears repeating: What is happening 
across America since January 6 is 
equally alarming to this assault on the 
Capitol, and that is the effort by doz-
ens of States across the Nation to re-
strict Americans’ right to vote. 
To think of it, in that last election in 
2020, we had the largest turnout in the 
history of the United States to cast 
votes in the Presidential election, and 
the response by so many of these 
States controlled by Republican legis-
latures is to try to do their best to 
make sure that never happens again; to 
restrict the opportunity to vote for eli-
gible Americans, when we should be 
doing just the opposite. 
I have won elections, and I have lost 
elections. As long as they were fair 
elections, I accepted the results, and 
they all were. I was lucky. Sometimes, 
I won; sometimes, I lost. But I felt at 
the end of the day that they were fair 
elections. We should feel the same way 
about the election that occurred the 
year before last, in 2020, with the elec-
tion of Joe Biden as President of the 
United States. 
It was a fair election. It has been cer-
tified. I marvel at my colleagues on the 
Republican side who come to the floor 
and say we have no right to tell these 
States what their laws should be when 
it comes to elections. 
This little booklet is in each of our 
desks. I would commend to my col-
leagues, particularly on the Republican 
side, to consider opening it and con-
sider reading article I, section 4. I 
would like to read into the RECORD: 
‘‘The Times, Places and Manner of 
holding Elections for Senators and 
Representatives, shall be prescribed in 
each State by the Legislature thereof; 
but the Congress may at any time by 
Law make or alter such Regulations, 
except as to the Places of chusing Sen-
ators.’’ 
And you go further in and read the 
Bill of Rights and the amendments to 
the Constitution. And then Amend-
ment 15 says: 
The right of citizens of the United States 
to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the

United States or by any State on account of 
race, color, or previous condition of ser-
vitude. 
Section 2 of the amendment says: 
The Congress shall have the power to en-
force this article by appropriate legislation. 
And yet Republican after Republican 
comes to the floor and questions how 
we can have the audacity to suggest 
that we are establishing standards so 
eligible voters across this country have 
an opportunity to vote. 
It is our constitutional responsibility 
to do it, and simply making that eligi-
bility turn into an actual exercise of 
that right is consistent with our de-
mocracy. 
I know other colleagues are here to 
speak today. I will close by saying this: 
What brought that mob to this Capitol 
was the inspiration of a former Presi-
dent, 
who 
provoked 
them, 
incited 
them, and turned them loose on this 
building, and now, we are led to believe 
that he sat back and watched on tele-
vision, as the events unfolded, doing 
nothing—not picking up the phone, not 
calling on anyone to stop the violence, 
to stop the bloodshed, to stop the death 
that took place in this Capitol. He did 
nothing for hours until, finally, enough 
forces came in to reclaim this building. 
When I saw the images, the photo-
graphs, and the videos of people who 
were clowning in this Chamber, posing 
for photographs, going through my 
desk and other desks, and others tak-
ing photographs with their phones, sit-
ting in that chair to pose for pictures 
to send back home, it makes me sick to 
my stomach. This is a sacred place. It 
is not sacred because I serve here or 
anyone else does. It is sacred because it 
was built to be a symbol of this great 
Nation. 
It was during the administration of a 
man from Illinois named Lincoln, who 
completed the Capitol dome in the 
midst of a Civil War so that this build-
ing would always be a symbol of the 
unity of our Nation and the promise of 
our Nation. 
That symbol was desecrated on Janu-
ary 6. And now, the question arises: 
Will we summon the courage to come 
together and lead to extend the oppor-
tunity to vote to more and more Amer-
icans, to make this democracy more 
complete and more just? Or will we 
step back and accept the verdict of his-
tory that we are going to go back in 
time instead of forward as a Nation? 
I trust we will move forward. These 
American people are great people. Re-
gardless of their political persuasion, 
they have one abiding knowledge, and 
that is the fact that we are blessed to 
live in this country, and we each bear 
a responsibility to its future. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today, along with colleagues, to 
look back at a year ago, January 6, 
2021—I wish this was actually a bipar-
tisan coming together today—a hor-
rible, tragic day in our Nation’s his-
tory. 
But it is not enough to look back. We 
also need to look at what is happening 
today because the threats against our 
democracy didn’t go away when those 
black metal fences came down. Some of 
these threats against the democracy 
have found fertile soil right in this 
very Chamber. 
January 6, 2021, will go down in his-
tory as one of the worst days our Na-
tion has ever faced. It was disturbing. 
It was frightening. It was enraging. I 
know that I will never, ever forget it. 
Many people who were working here 
that day still carry scars. Some can be 
seen, and some can only be felt. 
The Capitol Police, the DC Police, 
the National Guard members, our other 
first responders, Capitol staff who were 
there that day are really heroes, and 
they deserve our thanks and our con-
tinued support. 
What we all witnessed that day was 
nothing less than a violent insurrec-
tion against the very seat of our de-
mocracy and our American form of 
government. It was sparked by a big 
lie, concocted by a political loser, and 
fueled by a network of his supporters. 
So let me take a moment to remind 
everyone that Donald Trump lost the 
2020 election fair and square. In my 
home State of Michigan, in the middle 
of a pandemic, more people voted than 
ever before, 51⁄2
million people. And 
Michigan voters clearly and resound-
ingly chose Joe Biden to be our Presi-
dent and KAMALA HARRIS to be our 
Vice President. 
But 
instead 
of 
accepting 
defeat 
gracefully, like every other President 
in our history, Democrat or Repub-
lican, Donald Trump claimed that the 
election had been stolen from him. No 
one likes to lose an election. I have 
done both, winning and losing. It is not 
fun. But the election was not stolen 
from him. 
But this Big Lie has fueled the entire 
movement, people who will stop at 
nothing, including deadly violence, to 
undermine our Constitution and our 
country. They attacked our Capitol a 
year ago today, on January 6. They 
will use and incite violence to disrupt 
future elections if they feel they need 
to. 
And now, they are organizing on the 
State level to challenge the rules and 
take away people’s freedom to vote. 
And tragically, our colleagues across 
the aisle are standing by and allowing 
this continuing attack on our democ-
racy. We should be standing together, 
Democrats and Republicans, saying no 
to this assault on our Constitution and 
our country. 
Republicans said the right things 
that day. The senior Senator from 
South Carolina said, soon after the 
riot, that he was humiliated and em-
barrassed for our country and that 
Trump should ‘‘count him out.’’ But a 
few short weeks later, Trump counted 
him in for 2 days of golf and dining at 
Mar-a-Lago. 
And then there is the Republican 
leader. He said that the January 6 riot-
ers were ‘‘fed wild falsehoods by the 
most powerful man on earth because he 
was angry he lost an election.’’ He 
added that Trump was ‘‘practically and 
morally responsible for provoking the 
events of the day.’’ And he was right. 
Then the Republican leader and the 
majority of Republicans voted no on 
impeachment. They opposed a bipar-
tisan commission to investigate the 
events of January 6. They blocked 
three bills to protect our freedom to 
vote, and they endorsed a Senate can-
didate who agrees with Trump that the 
2020 election was stolen from him. 
In total, 147 Republican Members of 
the House and Senate—147—voted to 
overturn the results of the 2020 elec-
tion. And a number of those eight Re-
publican Senators still won’t admit 
that Joe Biden is our duly-elected 
President. 
Why am I focusing on this? 
Because our country has reached a 
critical crossroads: either we are going 
to come together as Americans, defend 
our democracy, and look back on Janu-
ary 6 as a painful low point in our Na-
tion’s history, or we can turn our 
power to a mob that is willing to do 
anything and say anything to dis-
mantle our democracy and destroy— 
Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague 
yield for a minute? 
Ms. STABENOW. I would be happy 
to. 
Mr. SCHUMER. OK. We are about to 
approach noon, where we will have a 
moment of silence, not only in memory 
of those who were lost and those who 
were injured, but in all of the work-
force here on Capitol Hill, who worked 
through that day under dire cir-
cumstances—they did an amazing job— 
and in recognition of the great job they 
do for us every day. 
So we thank not only the floor staff, 
but all of those who work here. 
And with that, I think we will com-
mence the moment of silence, and after 
we finish, I will call on Senator KLO-
BUCHAR and then Senator STABENOW, 
who will resume. OK? 
So if we might now at 12 noon—well, 
it is a little before. It is 2 minutes be-
fore. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
want to recognize the heroic efforts of 
our staff, many of whom are here with 
us today; of our law enforcement who, 
in the face of overwhelming numbers 
and an unprecedented violent assault, 
valiantly placed their lives on the line 
for this Republic. 
It is also an opportunity to remem-
ber to recommit ourselves to making 
sure nothing like this ever happens 
again. As President Biden said today, 
our democracy held. We, the people, 
endured; we, the people, prevailed. 
And we devote this moment of si-
lence to those who stood up, not only 
for this building, not only for the peo-
ple that worked here, but for our very 
democracy itself. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President I ask 
we commence a minute of silence, a

moment of silence, for all of those who 
have helped us then and help us now, 
the staffs and everybody else. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will now 
observe a moment of silence in observ-
ance of the events of January 6, 2021. 
(Moment of silence.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, let 
me just conclude by saying that either 
we are going to come together as 
Americans, which I hope and pray we 
do, to defend our democracy and look 
back on January 6 as a painful low 
point in our Nation’s history or we can 
turn over power to a mob that is will-
ing to do anything and say anything to 
dismantle our democracy and destroy 
this grand experiment called America. 
The January 6 insurrection tried to 
overthrow our Capitol, and their side-
kicks in suits and ties are trying to 
overthrow our elections. Just as we 
shored up our security here to protect 
the people’s House, we need to upgrade 
our election laws to protect people’s 
freedom to vote. 
Today is a day to remember, to be 
grateful for all of those who risked and 
lost their lives to protect us, to be 
grateful for all of those who stood up 
for democracy and continue to stand 
up every single day. Today is a day to 
be grateful that we live in this great 
democracy called America, and it is a 
day to reconnect ourselves to protect 
our freedoms for our children and our 
grandchildren. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
this morning, I have been listening to 
my colleagues, watching the news, 
watching our President, and reflecting 
on this day a year ago and where I was 
during this incredible insurrection that 
we now know happened on the Capitol. 
I was in my Capitol office here, as we 
all have an office here in the Capitol. I 
was getting ready to come to the floor 
of the Senate and certify that Joe 
Biden had won the Presidency in a free 
and fair election. The senior Senator 
from Minnesota had organized many of 
us to stand in defense of that free and 
fair election, and I had been asked to 
stand in defense of the certified elec-
toral votes in Arizona. And what I had 
been told, they were going to challenge 
Nevada. It was a significant moment. 
Even before President Biden’s vic-
tory, people had been spreading lies 
about the election for political gain, 
and I had planned to deliver a speech to 
combat those lies and explain in detail 
that the 2020 vote count was fair and 
accurate. So as I left my Capitol office 
and was walking to the Senate to de-
liver that speech, it became clear that 
something 
unprecedented 
was 
hap-
pening, because on my way out of my 
Capitol office, I came across two of my 
colleagues, one of them here today, 
Senator SMITH, and Senator MUR-
KOWSKI. They were standing outside an 
open door to a restroom that we share 
amongst our Capitol offices, and I 
asked them what was going on. 
They said: There is a Capitol Police 
officer in there. He has got something 
in his eyes, and he is flushing his eyes 
out with water. 
I leaned in, and I saw the officer at 
the bathroom sink. I thought to myself 
and I said aloud to my colleagues: I 
think he has been pepper-sprayed. 
I asked him: Have you been pepper 
sprayed? 
He said: Yes, but don’t worry. Every-
thing is fine. I am going to keep you all 
safe. 
With that, he dashed back out the 
door, up the stairs, and outside to pro-
tect all of us and everyone else in this 
building. 
Now, I knew there had been a rally 
going on near the White House and 
that there were protests. What I did 
not know that morning was just how 
close the protesters were to forcing 
their way into this Capitol. 
Now, everyone knows what happened 
next. As we sat here, all of the Sen-
ators, all of the staff who work with us 
day in and day out, our partners, the 
next thing we heard was this Chamber 
being shut down by the Capitol Police, 
claiming that the Capitol had been 
breached. They told us to stay in our 
seats. 
This is the safest place for you to be 
right now, and we will protect you. 
At that moment, we could all hear 
outside the doors. We didn’t know what 
was going on, because we can’t see be-
yond this room, what was happening 
outside, but we knew. We could hear 
the voices, and we could hear what was 
happening. We also could hear, outside 
of the one set of double doors that we 
call the hallway with the Ohio Clock 
that leads to the Rotunda, a lot of 
noise. It was at that moment, as the 
noise was working its way toward the 
Rotunda, that the Capitol Police offi-
cers then told all of us to get up and 
move quickly. We moved out these op-
posite doors right here, moved as 
quickly as we possibly could. 
That is when everybody came to-
gether, all of the Senators—I don’t care 
if they were Republican or Democrat— 
our floor staff who was with us, grab-
bing those electoral votes, and we all 
started going up and down stairs, 
through hallways, up and down stairs, 
through hallways, until we could get to 
a secure location. 
As we were going through the hall-
ways and when we got to the secure lo-
cation, it was clear why this was hap-
pening. We were under attack because 
insurrectionists had been whipped into 
a frenzy by the false claim that the 
election in Nevada and in other States 
was fraudulent. That is exactly what 
the speakers said during that rally be-
fore the violence began. 
We saw the same false claims in Ne-
vada, where extremists tried to chal-
lenge our election results in an effort 
to prevent Joe Biden from becoming 
President. The former President’s cam-
paign and his supporters filed a total of 
five lawsuits challenging the security 
of the election system and targeting 
our secretary of state in Nevada. Every 
one of those lawsuits was thrown out 
or failed, every single one of them in 
Nevada. When the official tally was 
completed, President Biden won Ne-
vada by 33,596 votes. 
The Nevada secretary of state not 
only certified the election, she also in-
vestigated each and every claim of 
election fraud, and she made clear that 
her office found no evidence of wide-
spread fraud. 
Now, I was the attorney general of 
the State of Nevada for 8 years, and I 
can tell you from personal experience, 
when we find voter fraud, we prosecute 
it. I also know there was, again, no 
widespread voter fraud in Nevada in 
the year 2020. 
Let me explain what ‘‘widespread 
voter fraud’’ means because that is now 
being challenged by some of the former 
President’s supporters. ‘‘Widespread’’ 
means that there was not enough to 
have changed the results of the elec-
tion; that it was still a safe and secure 
election and Joe Biden is our Presi-
dent. In fact, not only Nevada’s elec-
tions were safe, accessible, and secure, 
but across the country, they have been 
proven to be safe, accessible, and se-
cure. 
I also want to share with the rest of 
the country that in my State, in Ne-
vada, we have enacted important pro-
tections for protecting voting rights, 
including automatic voter registration, 
vote by mail, early voting, and same- 
day registration. In the 2020 Presi-
dential election, almost half of Nevad-
ans—people from both parties—took 
advantage of our vote-by-mail laws. 
But because the defeated former 
President and his supporters were 
upset that he lost the election, some of 
them publicized the lie that he had 
won, and that lie, in turn, spurred 
members of the public to violence that 
resulted in five deaths and countless 
injuries. 
Now, we all know, after the Capitol 
Police helped us move to safety, my 
colleagues and I from both parties 
talked about what to do. We knew the 
insurrectionists were trying to stop us 
from certifying the election, and we 
knew we had to finish our job, no mat-
ter how late it was. We all agreed that 
we had to go back to the Senate Cham-
ber so that we could show the rest of 
the country that we would not let our 
democracy be subverted by violence; 
that we would honor our Constitution 
and the peaceful transfer of power in 
this country. 
I want to make this clear. I would 
have stood up to certify the valid re-
sults of the 2020 election no matter who 
won. This isn’t about partisanship; it is 
about patriotism. I took an oath to up-
hold the Constitution and protect it 
against all enemies, foreign and domes-
tic, and nothing and no one will pre-
vent me from doing that sworn duty. 
So I walked back to the Senate floor 
on the evening of January 6 to finish

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S63 
January 6, 2022 
my work. I will remember what I saw 
for the rest of my life. As I walked 
back, furniture had been thrown every-
where like matchsticks. Trash and bro-
ken glass littered the floor. It was like 
a war zone. 
That night, I stood up and spoke in 
defense of our democracy as I had 
planned to do hours before. And at 3:42 
a.m., Vice President Pence announced 
that Joe Biden was the President-elect. 
We honored the Democratic transfer 
of power for the 59th time in American 
history, but I am here to tell you, 
there is so much to do to ensure that 
there will be a 60th time. Our democ-
racy is more fragile than it has been in 
decades. The same bad actors who 
fueled the violence in the first place, 
including the defeated former Presi-
dent and his supporters, continue to 
spread the Big Lie that the election 
was stolen, and they are using these 
false claims to pass legislation threat-
ening our very democracy. 
Around the country, more than 400 
State laws were introduced to restrict 
voting last year alone. In Nevada, we 
expanded vote-by-mail drop box loca-
tions, but in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, 
and Indiana, new laws make it harder 
to use those drop boxes. Nevada has 
same-day voter registration, but Texas 
just made it harder to register, not 
easier. In Georgia, it is now even ille-
gal to give food or water to people 
waiting in long lines to vote. The list 
goes on and on. 
These are partisan laws. They are de-
signed to favor one group of voters over 
another. That is not democracy. A real 
democracy honors everyone’s right to 
be heard. It makes sure that everyone 
gets a vote and that every vote is 
counted. 
Democracy is a remarkable thing—a 
system where the people get to choose 
their own leaders. We all need to stand 
up for it, just as the countless heroes of 
our history have done, from Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton to Abraham Lincoln, to 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 
I will not stop fighting to protect our 
country and our democracy. I will con-
tinue working with my colleagues to 
pass voting rights legislation. We need 
to follow Nevada’s lead and protect ac-
cess to the polls. We cannot let anyone 
silence America’s voice in their own 
government. 
I also want to recognize many of the 
heroes who protected us that day, like 
the Capitol Police officer I encountered 
that morning. After the attack was 
over, I learned that 140 police officers I 
pass in the halls of Congress every day 
had broken bones or worse. Four of 
them later took their own lives. These 
are brave men and women who put 
themselves at risk every day to protect 
not just the people’s elected represent-
atives but our dedicated staff and the 
hardest working people here at the 
Capitol, from the janitors to the cafe-
teria workers, to the postal employees. 
All of these people carry their own 
memories of January 6, and we need to 
make sure they never have to go 
through something like that again. 
So many of them are still here at the 
Capitol, still doing their jobs, like the 
Capitol Police officer I saw earlier who 
had been pepper-sprayed. But I will tell 
you what: They give me hope, and they 
remind me that all of us have a job to 
do just like we did on January 6. One 
year later, it is clear that we all must 
stand united in defense of our democ-
racy. I hope we can do just that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, a year ago, 
thousands of supporters of then-Presi-
dent Donald Trump—marching under 
banners 
supporting 
secession, 
con-
spiracy theories, and White suprem-
acy—violently stormed the U.S. Cap-
itol and breached the Senate and House 
Chambers in the hopes of overturning a 
free and fair election in which 7 million 
more Americans voted for President 
Biden. There was, of course, no proof 
and no truth to the claims of aberrant 
voting that Mr. Trump invented in 
order to fuel the mob. 
The assault on the Capitol was an at-
tack on the United States and on de-
mocracy itself. We have the brave men 
and women of the U.S. Capitol Police 
to thank for defending the country 
against what can accurately be called 
an insurrection, and while the assault 
failed that day, thanks to the efforts of 
these officers and their partners from 
neighboring jurisdictions, an insidious 
campaign against our democracy con-
tinues through the baseless lies and an-
tics of the former President and his as-
sociates. 
Mr. Trump set the events of January 
6 in motion when he refused to say that 
he would accept the results of the No-
vember 2020 election, and he continued 
to value his ego over our democracy 
when he urged the mob to march to the 
Capitol and disrupt the election certifi-
cation process. He repeatedly lied that 
the election he lost by 7 million votes 
had somehow been stolen, when the 
facts and the courts demonstrated that 
was clearly not the case. 
Stoked by his vitriol, Mr. Trump’s 
supporters used pipes and flagpoles to 
brutally beat police officers. Some of 
the attacks were also directed at or 
were planned to be directed at our own 
Members in both the House and the 
Senate, and anyone who refused to sub-
vert the election was a target of the in-
surrectionist mob. That included Mr. 
Trump’s own Vice President, Vice 
President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump, who 
lit the fuse and stood by, his actions 
sent a demoralizing signal to billions 
around the world as they watched his 
supporters assault the Capitol. 
One year ago today, the U.S. Capitol 
Police, Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement partners, and the National 
Guard physically cleared the Capitol 
Building and grounds. The House of 
Representatives impeached Mr. Trump 
for his actions. Yet most of my Senate 
Republican colleagues made the tor-
tured arguments that his actions were 
reprehensible but not technically im-
peachable. As a result, the democrat-
ically defeated former President con-
tinues his rhetorical assaults through 
lies and misinformation. He would 
rather rip our country apart and under-
mine our elections and democracy 
rather than to accept the will of the 
American voter. 
The bipartisan House Select Com-
mittee on the January 6 Attack on the 
U.S. Capitol is working tirelessly to 
get to the truth of that day. It is me-
thodically collecting and following the 
evidence despite there being a lack of 
cooperation from Mr. Trump and his 
inner circle. The committee must con-
tinue to be transparent, and we must 
all continue to call out the repeated 
lies of Trump and his enablers. 
Every American, regardless of party 
affiliation, who believes in the right to 
vote and in upholding the Constitution, 
should want the truth about January 6 
to come out. Congress must rise to the 
occasion. The stakes could not be any 
higher. Because of the former Presi-
dent’s actions a year ago and his re-
lentless lying since then, a significant 
minority of Americans now indicates 
that violence is an acceptable way to 
resolve political disagreement. We can-
not afford to have such a sentiment 
persist. Together, we must accept the 
truth, restore trust in one another, and 
take steps to improve political dis-
course. 
One step we must take is to honor 
the officers of the Capitol Police, not 
just with our words but with real sup-
port. Last year, we passed a supple-
mental appropriations bill that pro-
vided over $107 million in additional 
funding, including roughly $35 million 
for overtime, retention bonuses, hazard 
pay, and student loan repayments for 
officers. It also provided critical fund-
ing to address the trauma experienced 
by our officers and helped support their 
mental health needs. But we can’t stop 
there. We have to continue in this fis-
cal year, 2022, to support our police and 
to continue to support those who pro-
tect us. 
I am afraid, if we don’t quickly re-
solve our differences, that we could fall 
into the state of a continuing resolu-
tion, which would actually deny our 
police—the Capitol Police—and our se-
curity forces the tools they will need 
not only to protect us and protect 
themselves but also to sustain their 
morale and their mental health. So I 
hope we can make progress, at least on 
that point, of reaching a budget agree-
ment on behalf of the men and women 
who protect us and who literally, on 
that day, gave their lives for us. 
Now, in addition to that, we have a 
critical role to play when it comes to 
safeguarding the rights of the Amer-
ican voter. We have before us the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
and the Freedom to Vote Act ready for 
passage. We have the opportunity, and 
the time is now. I continue to urge my 
colleagues, 
both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, to work together to swiftly 
pass these critical voting rights bills

that are needed to protect our elec-
tions and our democracy. 
We must bolster the security, acces-
sibility, and transparency of our elec-
tions in order to mend the wounds of 
January 6 and begin to heal as a na-
tion, indivisible, with liberty and jus-
tice for all. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise 
today with my colleagues, and I would 
like to particularly thank my col-
league, the senior Senator from Min-
nesota, for bringing us together today. 
I rise today with my colleagues to 
commemorate the first anniversary of 
January 6—the attack on our Capitol 
and the attempted coup to overturn 
our democracy. 
You know, I have thought a lot about 
this day over the last year, and I speak 
today because I think it is important 
that we are clear about what happened 
on January 6, how it connects to what 
has happened since, and what needs to 
happen next. So let me be direct. 
On January 6, there was a violent at-
tack on the U.S. Capitol, led by insur-
rectionists with the explicit goal to 
overturn our free and fair elections and 
the election of Joe Biden. The attack 
happened because former President 
Trump and his allies encouraged his 
supporters to come to Washington. 
They told them, falsely, that the elec-
tion had been stolen. He incited them 
to violence. Then he sat and watched 
while the Capitol was attacked. These 
are the facts, and there was no attempt 
to hide it. It is as plain as that wintery 
January day. 
Now, I am sure that all of us in this 
room have vivid memories of what hap-
pened on that day. Moments of crisis 
leave a deep impression. For us, of 
course, this violence happened in our 
workplace while we were doing our 
jobs. The Capitol, on January 6, was 
full of Members of Congress, of na-
tional political leaders of both parties, 
and of a Vice President whom the 
former President had exhorted his 
angry mob to hunt down. It was also, 
though, full of journalists, custodians, 
and cafeteria workers. In this Chamber 
were our clerks and colleagues and 
Parliamentarians 
and 
the 
stenog-
raphers. They are here, hour after 
hour, making this place work. 
You are public servants who were 
thrown into violent chaos and danger 
by the former President. 
As for law enforcement and first re-
sponders, let’s remember that January 
6 was one of the worst days for injuries 
to law enforcement since 9/11, as a vio-
lent mob bludgeoned and crushed and 
wounded and killed. That is what hap-
pened, and no amount of whitewashing 
is going to change it. 
It also happened, when we came back 
into this Chamber to finish our jobs 
and to certify the people’s votes, that 
some Republicans spoke the truth 
about the terrible tragedy of that day. 
Senator MCCONNELL said: 
The mob was fed lies. They were provoked 
by the President and other powerful people. 
Senator LINDSEY
GRAHAM, sitting 
right over there, declared in reference 
to the disgraced former President: 
Count me out. Enough is enough. 
So, for a moment, it seemed like we 
would unify in condemning the polit-
ical violence incited by a President 
who had betrayed our fundamental 
democratic principles, but later that 
night, 
Senator 
CRUZ
and 
Senator 
HAWLEY and six other Senators voted 
to overturn our free and fair elections, 
continuing down this reckless path. 
Within days, Republican Party lead-
ers and rightwing media outlets began 
turning away from the facts of January 
6. Former President Trump was im-
peached for his seditious actions, but 
his hold on the Republican Party was 
so strong that only seven Republican 
Senators voted to convict. 
Republicans, to this day, continue to 
promote the Big Lie that the election 
was stolen from Trump. They claim 
that the people who stormed the Cap-
itol with zip ties and bludgeons were 
tourists. They have attempted to por-
tray the violent insurgents as martyrs 
rather than as domestic terrorists. 
This is why, today, 58 percent of Re-
publicans believe, falsely, that the 
election was stolen from President 
Trump. 
The insurrection and coup attempt 
on January 6 was, ultimately, unsuc-
cessful, but this fight continues in 
State legislatures across the country, 
and they are prevailing. According to 
the Brennan Center, in 2021, 19 States 
passed laws restricting Americans’ vot-
ing rights and giving partisan officials, 
Republicans, 
unprecedented 
control 
over the certification of election re-
sults. 
Their plan is right out there in plain 
view. Step 1 is to make it harder for 
some people to vote. Step 2 is to give 
partisans at the local level the power 
to ignore and overturn the people’s 
votes. This is a coordinated strategy 
connected directly to the events of 
January 6, and it is the path to over-
turning our democracy if we allow it. 
We cannot allow it. 
Through the January 6 Commission 
and through the Department of Jus-
tice, we must hold accountable those 
responsible for the crimes of that infa-
mous day, including those at the top. 
We also need to pass the Freedom to 
Vote Act, which provides for basic 
standards for free and fair elections 
and fulfills the promise of our Nation 
that, in this democratic Republic, the 
people decide. 
Not a single Republican Senator is 
willing to join us Democrats in this en-
deavor, and that is a tragedy. 
Colleagues, I implore you: We cannot 
let Republicans hide behind Senate 
rules and block us from taking this 
commonsense step to protecting our 
democracy. 
In a democracy, a majority of the 
people decides. That is how it works in 
township meetings and city halls and 
county board meetings and in State 
legislatures, and that is how it should 
work in the U.S. Senate. We Senators 
have the power to protect our democ-
racy, and we have no excuse not to use 
that power. 
On January 6, I woke up early, and I 
wrote down a few thoughts as I was 
heading to the Capitol. I had been 
sworn into office for the third time in 
3 years just a few days before. My hus-
band, Archie, had been with me for the 
swearing in, and he had headed home 
the day before. 
As he left, he said: Are you going to 
be OK? 
And I said to him: For sure. The U.S. 
Capitol is one of the safest places in 
the country. I am going to be fine. 
Here is what I wrote that morning 
before I came to the Capitol. 
I wrote: 
Today is a remarkable day. This morning, 
I’m filled with optimism. Georgians turned 
out in record numbers to elect Reverend 
[Ralph] Warnock [to the U.S. Senate], pastor 
of Dr. King’s home church. And it looks very 
likely that Jon Ossoff will be victorious, giv-
ing Democrats a majority in the Senate. For 
me, this means the work that Minnesotans 
sent me to do in Washington can actually 
get done. 
‘‘We will get through this day,’’ I 
wrote that morning. 
I truly believe our democracy is resilient 
and can withstand this desperate coup at-
tempt. But it’s a reminder of how hard we 
[need] to fight for our core principles, that 
no one is above the law and that . . . a de-
mocracy [is when] the people decide. 
Now, little did I know. But my opti-
mism still holds, and my faith also still 
holds—my faith that we can be worthy 
of the promise laid out in our Constitu-
tion. 
‘‘We the People of the United States, 
in order to form a more perfect Union, 
establish 
Justice, 
insure 
domestic 
Tranquility, provide for the common 
defense, promote the general Welfare, 
and secure the Blessings of Liberty to 
ourselves and our Prosperity’’—that is 
our oath and our promise. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise, as 
so many of us have done, on this day to 
do a couple of things—No. 1, to reflect 
and remember. That is important for 
so many reasons, but we are also here, 
I think, to express gratitude and com-
mendation for so many who work in 
this building, the staff and the Capitol 
Police and so many others who kept us 
safe 1 year ago today on that awful 
day. 
I will get to some other issues in a 
moment, but I want to start with just 
some reflections on what I remember 
about that day but also what I think 
the country experienced on a day of 
horror and terror and desecration—a 
day when a group of Americans came 
to this building to stop the counting of 
the electoral votes, and they were told 
to do that by the then-President of the 
United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S65 
January 6, 2022 
We know all the death that ensued 
from that, especially of law enforce-
ment officers; something on the order 
of 140 injures, some of them grievous, 
permanent injuries to law enforce-
ment—all based upon the violence 
based upon a Big Lie, a deliberate 
falsehood that started long before even 
election day. It started during the 
course of the 2020 election. 
But despite that Big Lie—I don’t 
want to spend all of today talking 
about that—despite that Big Lie and 
the violence that flowed from that Big 
Lie and the near collapse of our democ-
racy, despite that, we know that some-
thing on the order of 60 judges through-
out the country—Federal judges and 
State judges appointed by Democrats 
and Republicans and even some ap-
pointed by the former President— 
called out that Big Lie by rejecting the 
arguments based upon that Big Lie in 
about 60 different matters before those 
judges. 
So we know what happened, and I 
think the January 6 Commission will 
continue to put the evidence on the 
record and hold people accountable, 
but I think on a day like today, I want 
to focus on two issues. One is to ex-
press that gratitude that I mentioned 
before for the thousands of Americans 
who work in this building, the thou-
sands who are not Members of Congress 
who helped us on that day, everything 
from getting us to safety to making 
sandwiches for us when we were in a 
safe, 
secure 
room—something 
that 
basic. 
But, of course, so many Americans 
now know, after all these months have 
unfolded, about the sacrifices made by 
so many on that day, especially law en-
forcement, but people in this building, 
who work in this building—have done 
so for years—they, too, were terrorized 
on that day. It wasn’t just Members of 
Congress and the Nation more broadly. 
We even had the image—the horrible, 
disturbing, racist image—on television 
of an American walking through the 
halls of this building with a Confed-
erate flag. It never happened before. 
Not even during the American Civil 
War had that happened. 
So when we talk about those who 
have done so much, here is what we are 
talking about: We are talking about 
people who suffered devastating inju-
ries, as I said before, some of them life-
long. The emotional toll that this vio-
lence imposed upon members of the 
staff here in the building, both during 
the siege and in its aftermath, is al-
most incalculable. So we are grateful 
for their service on every day, every 
day of their work, but especially on 
that terrible day. 
I also want to thank—and we can’t do 
this enough; we can do it a thousand 
times, and it wouldn’t be enough—the 
U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropoli-
tan Police Department for all they did 
to protect us, to ultimately quell the 
violence, and to literally protect our 
democracy. These officers were bruised 
and beaten. They were attacked with 
bolts and bricks and bats and bear 
spray, as we saw so much, as well as 
stun guns. They had broken bones. 
They had concussions, chemical burns, 
scars, stitches, and on and on. That is 
what violence does to a human being. 
They were also subjected to—those 
who happened to be Black Americans 
in law enforcement or in communities 
of color—they were subjected to hor-
rific racial epithets, the kind of lan-
guage that should never be tolerated 
not only here in the Capitol but any-
where in our country. Some of them 
were even attacked by an American 
flag—by a flagpole with an American 
flag on it. 
So what this all adds up to is, unfor-
tunately, not just a mob going into a 
building; this is about domestic ter-
rorism. I think it is an important day 
to be thankful that so many stood up 
to that domestic terrorism in law en-
forcement. So we both offer our grati-
tude and try—as inadequate as it is by 
mere words—on a day like today to be-
stow some measure of both gratitude 
and commendation for what they did 
on that day. 
Finally, Mr. President, I think today 
is a day for resolve, to be determined 
to take action, legislative action. The 
best way we can do that is by passing 
the Freedom to Vote Act. That is the 
best thing we can do, not only for the 
next couple of weeks, but really it 
might be the most important thing any 
of us work on. 
I want to thank Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and so many others who have worked 
on these issues, not just in the after-
math of January 6 but for thinking 
about the future—the future of our de-
mocracy, literally the future of wheth-
er someone will have a clear pathway 
in the right to vote, the ability to vote 
in ways that so many Americans were 
able to vote in the midst of the pan-
demic. 
There were a lot of people back in 
2020 who said: Oh, you know, in Penn-
sylvania, you had a big turnout for 
President in 2016, but that turnout is 
going to go way down because it is a 
reelection, and there is a pandemic, 
and people won’t vote, and people will 
be afraid to vote. 
Guess what happened. We went from 
about 6 million votes in 2016 to almost 
6.9 million votes. Almost 900,000 more 
people voted in Pennsylvania than did 
just 4 years earlier—probably the high-
est turnout in more than 120 years in 
our State, just like it was for the Na-
tion. 
Now, that didn’t happen in our State 
just because people were more inter-
ested; it happened because we had 
pathways by way of a change in State 
law to allow them to vote, very similar 
to what we are trying to do by enacting 
into law the Freedom to Vote Act— 
being able to vote early, being able to 
vote by way of a mail-in ballot, having 
a drop box. 
What if you are 90 years old and you 
live in a rural area in Pennsylvania? 
We have 48 rural counties, by the way. 
What if you live in a rural area, and 
you can’t get to the county election 
bureau to drop off your mail-in ballot? 
Shouldn’t you have a drop box if you 
are 90 years old and you want to vote? 
What if you live on a farm? What if you 
are running a farm and you have a busy 
life or you are running a small busi-
ness? Shouldn’t you have the oppor-
tunity to vote or should you just be re-
stricted to 1 day in the year, 1 day 
every year for a general election, and if 
you can’t get to vote that day, then 
you are not able to vote? Why would 
we go back to those days? But appar-
ently a lot of people in this Chamber 
are supporting efforts all across the 
country—hundreds of voter suppression 
bills. 
As Reverend WARNOCK
said, seems 
like some people don’t want some peo-
ple to vote. I don’t understand that, 
after we had record turnout in Penn-
sylvania from 2016 to 2020 because we 
had different pathways for people to 
vote. That is what we are trying to do 
with the Freedom to Vote Act, to have 
national standards so people will have 
a chance to vote in the way that they 
want, in a way that is helpful in terms 
of their family life or their work life. 
But we are at a point now where the 
Big Lie is perpetuating itself in more 
ways than one. 
Let me conclude with one thought. 
My hometown newspaper, the Scranton 
Times-Tribune, published an editorial 
today. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD and 
as part of my remarks an editorial en-
titled ‘‘Long year after 1/6/21, it con-
tinues,’’ which is dated today. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Times-Tribune, Jan. 6, 2022] 
LONG YEAR AFTER 1/6/21, IT CONTINUES 
It would be sobering enough today to look 
back on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Cap-
itol, thus on the people of the United States 
and the nation’s representative democracy, 
as a singular event. That’s impossible be-
cause the attack continues. It carries on in 
statehouses like Pennsylvania’s, where law-
makers continue to question the outcome of 
the 2020 presidential election—the most 
transparent and heavily scrutinized vote in 
the nation’s history—craft bills to diminish 
the sort of heavy turnout that carried Presi-
dent Joe Biden to victory, waste public 
money on fraudulent searches for fraud, and 
gerrymander congressional districts in the 
cause of minority rule. More than 60 Repub-
lican members of the Pennsylvania Legisla-
tures endorsed disqualifying Pennsylvania’s 
electoral 
votes, 
which 
would 
have 
disenfranchised 
6.8 
million 
Pennsylvania 
voters, on the preposterous claim that the 
election law that they had passed less than a 
year earlier unconstitutionally had skewed 
the election. 
It continues in the person of disgraced 
politicians, such as Republican Reps. Dan 
Meuser and Fred Keller of Northeast and 
Central Pennsylvania, who supported a law-
suit spawned in Texas that aimed to dis-
enfranchise 
their 
fellow 
Pennsylvanians. 
Then they voted in the Congress of the 
United States, after the mob attacked it, not 
to certify the duly vetted Electoral College 
results from Pennsylvania.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S66 
January 6, 2022 
It continues in the movement to replace, 
with partisan hacks, the professional elec-
tion administrators who resisted pressure in 
2020 to cook local and state election results 
in favor of President Donald Trump. 
It continues in the shameless efforts of 
many Republican members of Congress—who 
sensibly ran for their lives as Trump-inspired 
rioters invaded the Capitol—to characterize 
the Jan. 6 insurrection as anything other 
than what it was and is. 
Another day of infamy. 
Americans who care about the future of 
U.S. democracy cannot view Jan. 6, 2021, as a 
one-off. It is a date that should be considered 
in the same sentence as other insidious at-
tacks—Dec. 7, 1941, and Sept. 11, 2001. 
Though the Capitol insurrection was not as 
deadly as the other attacks, it potentially is 
more serious because it came from within. 
And the ongoing results are profound. There 
is no doubt that it has emboldened totali-
tarians abroad to challenge democratic re-
gimes and movements. It is not coincidental 
that Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has 
amassed troops on the Ukrainian border and 
that Chinese dictator Xi Jinping crushed a 
democracy movement in Hong Kong and in-
creased menacing conduct toward Taiwan in 
the wake of the insurrection. 
Just as sustained action was required fol-
lowing the 1941 and 2001 attacks, so it is re-
quired in the wake of the 2021 insurrection. 
Congress must pass the For the People 
Act, which would establish a host of election 
reforms, and the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Acts, which would restore pro-
tections for voting that the Supreme Court 
foolishly has diminished by weakening the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
That will require suspension or elimi-
nation of the filibuster in the Senate, which 
undoubtedly would produce political howl-
ing. But the filibuster is a mere procedural 
rule in one chamber of the Congress. Allow-
ing any one of 100 senators the power to di-
minish the voting rights of millions of Amer-
icans is not how a representative democracy 
is supposed to work. 
Likewise, Congress should update the Elec-
toral Count Act of 1887 to eliminate its po-
tential to be a vehicle for a coup. 
And the select House committee inves-
tigating Jan. 6, along with the Department 
of Justice, aggressively must move to hold 
accountable not only the rioters, but those 
who facilitated them in any way. 
At some point, Americans might be able to 
view Jan. 6, 2021, as a crisis that U.S. democ-
racy survived. But that day is not today. 
Mr. CASEY. I won’t read all of it, ob-
viously, but the point that this edi-
torial makes is that the attack con-
tinues today. It is not over. It is not 
some event in the past that we are just 
reflecting upon, as important as it is to 
reflect and remember and offer grati-
tude and commendation. Here is what 
the editorial says, and I will just read 
a short portion of it. It says: 
[T]he attack continues. It carries on in 
statehouses like Pennsylvania’s, where law-
makers continue to question the outcome of 
the 2020 presidential election—the most 
transparent and heavily scrutinized vote in 
[our] nation’s history—craft bills to diminish 
the sort of heavy turnout that carried . . . 
Joe Biden to victory, waste public money on 
fraudulent searches for fraud, and gerry-
mander congressional districts in the cause 
of minority rule. 
It goes on from there, saying that the 
attack continues by all of this work to 
lie about the election of 2020 and to 
pass voter suppression bills all across 
the country. 
The good news is, that is not going to 
happen. We are not going to allow a 
partisan minority to prevent us from 
passing legislation to keep that path-
way to the right to vote clear in the 
ways that it was clear so that so many 
Pennsylvanians and many Americans— 
as I said, in my home State, hundreds 
of thousands more voted in a pandemic 
than voted just 4 years earlier. 
So on this day when we remember 
with horror that day just a year ago 
and we say thank you to those law en-
forcement officials and others who 
work in this building and did so much 
for us and for the Nation, we also are 
determined to move forward to protect 
our democracy and ensure that this 
great American experiment continues 
for generations. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, we 
will be joined shortly by your colleague 
from the great State of Virginia, and I 
wanted to address some of the incred-
ible work done by the Maryland and 
the Virginia National Guard, which 
was so important that day. 
We have fixed a lot of the issues 
going forward about how they get 
called in, but that moment when they 
had to stand up, they did. So we really, 
truly appreciate their help, as well as 
other National Guards—from as far 
away as New Jersey and as close as 
DC—for helping out that day. They 
made a critical difference. 
I see the Senator from Michigan is 
here, and we thank him for his leader-
ship of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee and the work that we did to-
gether in the aftermath of this insur-
rection to make sure something like 
this—and to guarantee to the staff and 
the officers in this Capitol that some-
thing like this never happens again. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. 
One year ago today, a shocking, vio-
lent, and unthinkable attack on the 
U.S. Capitol shook the very founda-
tions of our democracy. I was here, in 
this Chamber, as we were conducting 
the ceremonial certification of our 
election, and I just remember so viv-
idly as the proceedings were so abrupt-
ly paused and the Vice President was 
hurried off of the podium by the Secret 
Service and the confusion as we evacu-
ated this Chamber. 
And, in that moment, none of us were 
aware of the brutal altercations that 
were unfolding all around us as our he-
roic law enforcement officers and first 
responders fended off the violent mob 
of insurrectionists. 
The images from that day are abso-
lutely horrifying. They are images that 
I and this country will hopefully never 
forget. We are forever indebted to the 
brave U.S. Capitol Police officers, the 
DC Metropolitan Police, the National 
Guard, and others whose valiant efforts 
defended a democracy that day and 
thwarted an attempted insurrection. 
Not only did this attack leave front-
line officers with serious physical inju-
ries, but it also took the lives of sev-
eral. The attack has taken an unimagi-
nable mental and emotional toll on 
first responders, the Capitol Hill com-
munity, and Americans all across our 
Nation who witnessed this assault on 
the heart of our democracy with their 
own eyes, either here in person or 
watching it on television. 
Sadly, as we mark this solemn anni-
versary, the threat that we all watched 
become a violent act 1 year ago has 
only continued to grow. In my role as 
chairman of the Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs Committee, 
along with Rules Committee Chair-
woman KLOBUCHAR, we were proud to 
lead the first bipartisan oversight hear-
ings—investigation—and report on the 
immediate changes needed to secure 
the Capitol and to prevent a future at-
tack. 
Since that report was released last 
June, nearly 16 of the 20 recommenda-
tions that we made have been imple-
mented or are well underway. The Cap-
itol is secure, and we are much better 
prepared for a future attack. 
But let us be very clear: We must do 
more to tackle the threat of domestic 
and violent extremism, especially as 
more and more people embrace con-
spiracy theories and outright lies and 
report that they believe that violence 
can be justified to get their desired po-
litical outcomes. Once relegated to the 
fringes of our society, these kinds of 
views are now creeping further into the 
mainstream, and that presents a grave 
threat to the future of our democracy. 
There is no easy one solution to ad-
dress this matter, but there are actions 
that we can take to protect our democ-
racy and strengthen it for generations 
to come. Most significantly, our Na-
tion’s political leaders, no matter their 
political affiliation, must condemn the 
violence 
that 
occurred 
on 
these 
grounds 1 year ago and speak out 
against the lies and conspiracies about 
the 2020 election that have compelled 
further threats and acts of violence. 
We must also address how this 
disinformation and other extremist 
content spreads online, reaches new au-
diences, and drives too many people 
down a rabbit hole of radicalization. 
We have seen all too clearly how the 
spread of such extreme content online 
can swiftly become real-world violence. 
More actions must be taken to limit 
the amplification of disinformation 
and extreme content online and to pre-
vent extremist views from reaching 
that tipping point into violent acts. 
And our counterterrorism agencies 
must ensure that they are effectively 
focusing on the threat at hand by en-
suring that they have sufficient per-
sonnel and resources devoted to domes-
tic terrorism and domestic violent ex-
tremism. 
And finally, today and every day, all 
Americans must remain committed to

protecting our democracy. We cannot 
take our democracy for granted. It is 
built on the promise that every Amer-
ican is committed to the same core 
values of free and fair elections, the 
peaceful transfer of power, and an ac-
countable government for all of the 
people. 
If we lose this shared commitment to 
continue upholding our most cherished 
principles, we risk losing the very free-
doms and the rights that have made 
our Nation a beacon of light for the en-
tire world. 
Every Member of this body—every 
American—has a vital role in strength-
ening our democracy. Elected officials 
on both sides of the aisle and at every 
level of government should make clear 
that the lies and violent action that 
took place on January 6 have no place 
in our country and commit themselves 
to restoring faith in our democratic in-
stitutions by ensuring that everyone 
can make their voices heard in our de-
mocracy through the ballot box. 
One year ago, we saw our democracy 
endure against a violent attempted in-
surrection, but we must be very clear- 
eyed moving forward. We cannot let ef-
forts to weaken and erode confidence in 
the future of our democracy continue. 
Let’s come together and take the 
very real challenges our Nation faces 
head-on. In times of adversity, our 
country persevered because we came 
together as one. We must channel that 
spirit and strive to create a more per-
fect Union today, tomorrow, and for 
generations to come. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, thank 
you for that recognition, and it is great 
to see you safe and secure, out of your 
vehicle, presiding over the Senate. 
It is a great honor for me to follow 
my friend the Senator from Michigan 
on this important day, and I want to 
start by thanking my friend and chair-
person of the Rules Committee, the 
Senator from Minnesota, for organizing 
us to come together today to com-
memorate or acknowledge what was a 
dark, dark day in American history, 
what happened a year ago. 
I want to thank—and I will do this in 
a more formal way in a moment—all 
the folks who helped protect us on Jan-
uary 6, a year ago. And I want to com-
mend an organization that I know the 
Presiding Officer is aware of, as is the 
Senator from Minnesota and the Sen-
ator from Colorado—the World Central 
Kitchen, led by Jose Andres, who is 
right now downstairs—Jose is not, but 
the organization is—serving Capitol 
Police and other Capitol personnel free 
meals today. 
It is a wonderful organization that 
supports those in need all across the 
world and all across the country, and 
the fact that they are here today say-
ing ‘‘thank you’’ to our Capitol Police 
and others is appropriate. 
Mr. President, I rise today to mark 
the anniversary of the January 6 insur-
rection in which a mob broke into this 
Capitol, broke onto the floor of the 
Senate, in an effort to overturn the 
2020 Presidential election. This was an 
effort to undermine democracy, plain 
and simple. 
In the last year, I think most of us 
have reflected a lot on the effort by our 
U.S. Capitol Police, the DC Metropoli-
tan Police, the Virginia State Police, 
and the Maryland State Police that 
day. They quite literally held the line 
to protect our democracy. I am person-
ally indebted to those individuals who 
saved so many lives and some of whom 
lost their own. 
And while others, I know, have al-
ready come before me and talked about 
the incredible role of the Capitol Police 
and other allies—the Metropolitan Po-
lice—as the Presiding Officer knows, 
the first State police to arrive on the 
scene were Maryland and Virginia. 
They actually got here quicker than 
the National Guard. 
But I would like to highlight in my 
comments today another group of peo-
ple who helped quell the insurrection, 
and that was the Virginia National 
Guard, a group of men and women that 
I and the Presiding Officer have great 
pride in. We both have served as Gov-
ernors of the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia, and one of the most important 
roles in being Governor—beyond the 
fact of the incredibly important title 
you carry when you are Governor—is 
the fact that we served during those 
each of our 4 years, the Presiding Offi-
cer and I, as the commander in chief of 
the Guard. 
One of the most meaningful parts I 
recall was seeing off those Guard mem-
bers, young and old—these are folks 
who have day jobs and lives and studies 
and work—seeing them off, deployed to 
Iraq and Afghanistan and to respond in 
the aftermath of hurricanes and floods 
and welcoming back these citizen sol-
diers in a way that oftentimes doesn’t 
get the recognition that they deserve. 
But I, again, think back to January 
6. As the crowds grew here on Capitol 
grounds and steadily advanced their 
positions, eventually into this building 
itself—and, again, so many of us were 
here. And I think the Senator from 
Oklahoma was speaking as we heard 
the glass break and people shouting, 
‘‘Quick, let’s secure the doors.’’ 
I think all of us who work here, our 
pages, the great members of the floor 
staff, with particular recognition of the 
Parliamentarian staff—we come racing 
in, and we think about those doors up-
stairs, which are, frankly, pretty flim-
sy. We all remember that day and 
those moments. It was obvious pretty 
quickly that we were going to need ad-
ditional force to augment the Capitol 
Police and the Metropolitan Police. 
Now, a year ago, it took much too 
long than was needed to get the Na-
tional Guard to provide that assist-
ance. We had, at that point, a con-
voluted system in place that resulted 
in delays in getting the Guard to the 
Capitol. I am proud to say that since 
then Congress—again, under the lead-
ership of our chair of the Rules Com-
mittee, 
Senator 
KLOBUCHAR—has 
passed on a bipartisan basis and the 
President has signed into law the Cap-
itol Police Emergency Assistance Act, 
which empowers the Capitol Police 
chief to request the assistance of the 
DC Guard or other Federal law enforce-
ment agencies in emergencies without 
the prior approval process that was 
used in the past: the Capitol Police 
Board and the kind of bureaucratic 
hurdles that, frankly, didn’t allow the 
Guard to get called in a year ago. 
When the decision was finally made 
to utilize National Guard personnel, 
men and women from the DC National 
Guard, the Maryland National Guard, 
and the Virginia Guard were literally 
the first ones to be called up. Within 
hours of the riot and the Capitol being 
stormed, while personnel here on the 
ground were still working to secure 
and fully regain control of the Capitol 
Complex, men and women in the Vir-
ginia National Guard were ready for 
deployment 
(Mr. KING assumed the Chair.) 
As I mentioned earlier, those of us— 
and I see now the Presiding Officer is 
the former Governor of Maine. He had 
that same responsibility that I had and 
the previous Presiding Officer had as 
Governors to be commander in chief of 
our Guards. 
We know firsthand that the National 
Guard in each of our respective States 
is a civilian force. These men and 
women who were called up on January 
6 and 7 were called from their jobs, 
their studies, and most importantly, 
their families. They were called from 
cities and towns and big cities and 
small farming communities all across 
the Commonwealth. Within hours, they 
mobilized for a domestic deployment to 
our National Capitol. 
I remember one Guard member I met, 
who lived in Arlington—he was work-
ing, got the deployment call, rushed 
back home to pick up some clothes, 
take a shower, and had, frankly, to 
drive all the way down—I think they 
were mustering in Newport News at 
that point and then were redeployed up 
here at the Capitol the next morning. 
On January 7, the morning following 
the riot, the first National Guard per-
sonnel arrived on the scene to support 
the ongoing security effort and to pro-
tect against the possibility of future 
threats. 
Folks in this room remember how 
uncertain the immediate aftermath 
was. The men and women of the Guard 
arrived in DC fully armed and had been 
told to prepare for the possibility of 
confronting heavily armed rioters and 
protesters—not tourists; heavily armed 
rioters and protesters—and even the 
possibility that some of those rioters 
and protesters might bring bombs or 
IEDs that could have been placed in 
the vicinity of the Capitol. We still 
haven’t found the source of those 
bombs that were placed at the Demo-
cratic and Republican National Com-
mittees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S68 
January 6, 2022 
The weeks leading up to the inau-
guration, after the 7th and before the 
21st, even more National Guard per-
sonnel poured into DC from across the 
country. The Virginia National Guard 
continued to perform a critical and 
outsized role in this response, with 
nearly 2,500 men and women—close to 
10 percent of the total Guard presence 
in DC—securing the Capitol grounds 
and Library of Congress, providing 
quick-reaction capabilities to Capitol, 
Metropolitan, and Park Police, and 
adding critical communications, med-
ical, logistical, and chaplain support. 
I want to specifically highlight the 
Virginia National Guard’s 116th Infan-
try 
Brigade 
Combat 
Team, 
which 
played a leading role in protecting our 
Capitol in the weeks following January 
6. 
The IBCT, under the command of 
COL Chris Samulski, led a task force of 
more than 7,400 airmen and soldiers 
from 12 different States and was re-
sponsible for maintaining the physical 
security of the Capitol grounds leading 
up to the inauguration. 
Twice during their mission here at 
the Capitol, I had the privilege of 
meeting with the Virginia Guard. What 
I heard time and again was the great 
mix of emotion that came with this de-
ployment. These women and men had 
volunteered for duty to serve the 
United States and protect our Con-
stitution, but what they normally ex-
pect that duty to ensue was protecting 
us against our foreign enemies. 
I see my friend, my colleague from 
Virginia. I know he visited with the 
Guard as well. 
Many of these men and women had 
been deployed—in some cases, multiple 
times—to Iraq and Afghanistan. Many 
of these soldiers and airmen had been 
deployed in the aftermath of hurri-
canes and storms and natural disasters. 
None of them, not only from Virginia 
but from any other State that was 
mustered here, had ever been deployed 
when the frontline against people who 
wanted to overthrow our government 
was not abroad but right here in our 
Nation’s Capital. They were as shocked 
as all of us that this very building 
where we work every day needed Na-
tional Guard protection. 
The truth was, they would spend 
weeks on duty, camped out in our Cap-
itol and around the congressional office 
buildings. Again, I thank the chairman 
of the Rules Committee. When some-
times they didn’t get a fair shake or 
tried to get pushed aside, many of us, 
under her leadership, said: No, these 
folks should not be pushed out in the 
cold because somebody wants their 
parking space back. 
I remember their kind of uncer-
tainty. They were kind of saying: Sen-
ator, we didn’t think we would ever be 
here. But I also remember their pride 
in serving as part of this historic mis-
sion and their direct role in safe-
guarding our democracy. Their pres-
ence during that time, all the way 
through the inauguration when there 
were still concerns that the mobs 
might be back, I think helped calm the 
Capitol, not just Members but those 
who were pages at that point and the 
many, many staff. They helped calm 
the Capitol and our country. 
While we faced and still face unprece-
dented challenges as a nation, the work 
and dedication of the men and women 
of the Guard demonstrated that our de-
mocracy is stronger than the destruc-
tive behavior of any mob. 
This is important because the events 
of January 6 were not an isolated 
event. What happened that day was the 
product of the Big Lie, perpetrated by 
a former President and cultivated by 
those who wished to chip away at the 
sacred values upon which our Nation 
was founded. Those same individuals— 
those same individuals—in many in-
stances continue to stoke that lie that 
our elections are not secure and that 
they are better off in the hands of par-
tisan officials with the authority to 
overturn the results if somehow those 
partisan officials don’t like the results 
of the people. 
Fueled by the Big Lie, a number of 
States across the country are changing 
laws to undermine the right to vote in 
free and fair elections. The rights of all 
Americans 
but 
especially 
minority 
Americans—people 
of 
color, 
young 
Americans—are being attacked, and 
the basic tenets of our democracy are 
under siege. 
These changes to voting laws are un- 
American; for example, what happened 
on Wednesday, where, as we heard yes-
terday—oftentimes 
in 
precincts 
of 
color, particularly precincts with a 
heavy concentration of African Ameri-
cans, you wait not an hour or 10 min-
utes in line; you wait 2, 5, 8, 10 hours in 
line. So the idea that we can’t give you 
any water or food while you are wait-
ing that 10 hours in line, who is going 
to vote? In States like Texas, where 
they are saying a local government can 
overturn the results of a local elec-
tion—that is not democracy. It is des-
picable that some people want to make 
it harder for eligible Americans to par-
ticipate in our democracy. 
One of the things that we saw and 
that I am very proud of in the Com-
monwealth of Virginia is that we dra-
matically expanded our voting rights 
this year. We had an unprecedented 
turnout. It resulted in favor of one 
party. Our candidate of choice didn’t 
win. The Republican candidate won be-
cause he helped turn out the early 
vote. 
The notion—I don’t understand those 
who are trying to restrict. What are 
people afraid of when more people par-
ticipate? Consequently, that is why we 
need to act now to protect our democ-
racy by passing the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act and the Free-
dom to Vote Act. Since the Senate has 
shown it cannot do this basic duty and 
find 60 Senators to support basic voting 
rights, it is time to change the Senate 
rules so the filibuster can’t be abused 
to 
continue 
blocking 
vital 
voting 
rights legislation. 
I can think of no better way to honor 
the sacrifices that were made in de-
fense of our democracy last year than 
by passing these bills to prevent fur-
ther subversion of our electoral system 
and safeguard our democracy for future 
generations. 
I note my former colleague passed 
today. I wish many of my Republican 
colleagues were here so they, too, could 
stand up and express their views and 
thoughts on what happened a year ago. 
I hope, even if they are not here today 
or tomorrow, that next week, they will 
come to the floor as well. Let their 
voices be heard. What do they think a 
year after on January 6? Is that accept-
able behavior? What do they think 
about the efforts to try to restrict vot-
ing all across many places of the 
South? But that is going to change as 
more and more State legislatures come 
in this year. What are their views on 
these critical issues? Where do they 
stand on protecting Americans’ right 
to vote and preserving our democracy, 
which was under assault a year ago? 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleagues in marking 
a very solemn anniversary. A year ago, 
our former President, Donald Trump, 
and his Big Lie about the 2020 election 
incited a violent insurrection on our 
Nation’s Capitol and an attack on our 
very democracy. 
We must never forget this dark day 
in our Nation’s history. We must never 
forget the heroic work of the Capitol 
Police, the Metropolitan Police, and 
the National Guard to protect all of us 
and this institution and its critical 
work from that violent mob. We must 
never tolerate such an attack on our 
democracy and our democratic values. 
That disgraceful day led to the 
deaths and injuries of brave people in 
uniform, 
created 
lasting 
scars 
for 
countless members of our community, 
and further opened the door to under-
mine our trusted democratic process 
for generations to come. 
I applaud the ongoing efforts of the 
House Select Committee, bipartisan in 
nature, to uncover the truth, to pro-
vide accountability, and to ensure that 
this never happens again in our coun-
try. But Congress cannot stop at mak-
ing clear to the American people how 
January 6 came to be and ensuring 
those who contributed to this tragic 
attack on our Nation and its institu-
tions face the consequences of their ac-
tions. 
We must also act to protect the right 
of every eligible American to vote and 
to secure the integrity of our elections 
against partisan interference because 
the Big Lie hasn’t gone away—far from 
it. Across the country, Republican 
State legislatures are using it to jus-
tify attacking our democracy time and 
time again. 
In the last year alone, more than 400 
pieces of legislation—bills—that re-
strict access to voting have been intro-
duced in 49 of our States, and in at

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S69 
January 6, 2022 
least 19 of those States, these measures 
have become law. 
In my home State of Wisconsin, the 
Republicans in the State legislature 
are willing to disregard the clear re-
ality that Wisconsinites from across 
the political spectrum exercised their 
right to vote in record numbers in a se-
cure, fair, and safe election in 2020. In-
stead, they are pushing Trump’s Big 
Lie to gain a partisan advantage by 
curtailing voting rights and putting up 
barriers to make it harder to vote. 
They are today fleecing taxpayers to 
support a sham, partisan process under 
the false guise of election integrity, 
undermining people’s faith in our elec-
tions. At the same time, they are ad-
vancing a redistricting proposal that 
will double down on Wisconsin’s un-
precedented level of partisan gerry-
mandering, all while our hard-working 
election officials are facing threats 
against their lives simply for doing 
their jobs. 
Enough is enough. That is why the 
Senate must take up and pass the Free-
dom to Vote Act and the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act with-
out delay. 
Regardless of where you live in this 
country, you should have the same ac-
cess to the ballot box and faith that 
our elections are fair and safe. Voting 
rights has long been a bipartisan issue, 
but, unfortunately, my Republican col-
leagues are obstructing us from taking 
up this incredibly important legisla-
tion and obstructing us from taking ac-
tion to stop voter suppression and pro-
tect voting rights. 
The 
Freedom 
to 
Vote 
Act 
will 
counter election interference by pro-
tecting election officials from the kind 
of threats, intimidation, and harass-
ment that we are seeing across the 
country and, very specifically, we are 
seeing in Wisconsin. It will put an end 
to the partisan gerrymandering that 
lets legislators choose their voters, 
something we have seen all too clearly 
in my home State. And it will ensure 
that there are commonsense, nation-
wide standards on early voting and vot-
ing by mail that make it easier for 
more people to exercise their constitu-
tional right to vote, particularly in 
challenging circumstances like this 
global pandemic. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act will restore protections 
under the Voting Rights Act against 
the type of efforts to restrict access to 
the ballot that we continue to see in 
States across the country. 
January 6, 2021, is a day none of us 
will ever forget. The images of insur-
rectionists assaulting our brave people 
in uniform, our seat of government and 
democracy, will forever be burned into 
my mind. But far too many would like 
to whitewash the violent day and pre-
tend the insurrection was not an exis-
tential threat to our democracy. 
We 
have 
colleagues 
who 
have 
inexplicably and falsely said the vio-
lent mob was a group of mere ‘‘tour-
ists.’’ My Republican counterpart from 
the great State of Wisconsin even 
called January 6 a ‘‘peaceful protest.’’ 
These fly in the face of the truth. This 
is not right, and we cannot allow the 
truth to be buried. 
We must all condemn this insurrec-
tion in no uncertain terms, as well as 
the Big Lie about the 2020 election that 
drove the mob to desecrate this hal-
lowed Chamber. And we must honor 
and strengthen our democracy by pass-
ing legislation that puts an end to 
these ceaseless attacks on voters and 
the integrity of our elections. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I feel 
grateful to have the chance here to join 
my colleagues to mark the anniversary 
of January 6. I thank the chair of the 
Rules Committee, Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
for her leadership in all of this. 
We had an insurrection here a year 
ago that could have very easily turned 
into a conflagration if it had not been 
for the incredible bravery of the Cap-
itol Police and the other law enforce-
ment who were summoned to the Cap-
itol too late but nevertheless here. The 
National Guard, as my colleague from 
Virginia was talking about, kept this 
place from being burned down. They 
kept people from getting killed. They 
lost their lives on that day and in sub-
sequent days because of the trauma 
that they were exposed to. They suf-
fered racial epithets that nobody in 
America should have to suffer, shouted 
in the halls of this Capitol—T-shirts 
with the most racist, holocaust-deny-
ing slogans on them. 
And there are people here, as my col-
league from Wisconsin said, who were 
claiming that they were acting like 
tourists. That is a really big lie too. 
This was an incredibly dangerous situ-
ation, and we were saved, not just us 
but the staff all over this Capitol and 
everybody else. 
I just heard somebody downstairs in 
the basement walking by, and they 
were pointing out one of those pictures 
that is down there of newsboys stand-
ing in front of the Capitol when they 
were kids. And the guy said: Those 
were my great-uncles. Because this 
place and the people who work here— 
not talking about the Senate but the 
people who work here who are the staff 
whose 
grandparents 
worked 
here, 
whose great-uncles who are on the pic-
tures downstairs—to them, this was a 
family, and it was attacked. It was as-
saulted on behalf of people who came 
summoned here by the President, who 
claimed that the election had been sto-
len from him, who was perpetrating a 
big lie about what had happened in the 
election. 
There shouldn’t have even been a sur-
prise about the results in the election. 
There was little reason for suspense. 
And it is tragic that a year later, we 
still have to come here and say Joe 
Biden won the election—and he did by 
any fair study of what happened that 
day—on election day. He won Arizona 
by 10,000 votes. He won Georgia by 
11,000 votes. He won Wisconsin by 20,000 
votes. He won Pennsylvania by 80,000 
votes and Michigan by 150,000 votes. In 
every one of those swing States, he 
won by more votes than Donald Trump 
won in his election against Hillary 
Clinton. So this wasn’t some razor-thin 
margin. This margin was bigger in 
those States, except Arizona, than the 
margin that Donald Trump had won 
when he won the election against Hil-
lary Clinton. Joe Biden won this elec-
tion by 7 million votes. 
Donald Trump actually lost the pop-
ular vote when he won the election by 
3 million votes. But his election wasn’t 
seriously contended by anybody, and it 
shouldn’t have been because he had 
won the electoral college, just as Joe 
Biden had won the electoral college. 
And he still claims the election was 
stolen, even though there is no evi-
dence that that is true. His own Attor-
ney General said it is a lie. His law-
yers—Donald 
Trump’s 
lawyers—had 
been thrown out of more than 60 court-
rooms by State and Federal judges, 
some of them appointed by President 
Trump, himself, saying that there was 
no evidence that there was fraud. 
A year later, there has been another 
incredibly expensive audit or review of 
the election—this time, the election in 
Georgia. Do you know what? There 
were four people down there who were 
dead who voted—four people. They 
didn’t actually vote. They were dead, 
but people cast ballots on behalf of 
them. Four people out of 5 million, and 
one of those cast a vote for Donald 
Trump. But President Trump continues 
to say that there were dead people vot-
ing all over the United States of Amer-
ica. 
The Associated Press did a review of 
all those swing States that I was men-
tioning earlier, and they found that if 
you just looked at the disputed bal-
lots—so these aren’t even fraudulent 
ballots because they haven’t been iden-
tified as fraudulent; they are just dis-
puted ballots. In all these cases, the 
disputed ballots came to about 1.5 per-
cent of the margin in any one of these 
races. In other words, in not a single 
one of these swing States where there 
is a dispute that President Trump has 
brought would it make a material dif-
ference, even if it were true what he al-
leges, which it is not. 
He has still doubled down on the Big 
Lie, and the result is, as my colleagues 
have said here today, there are more 
than 400 bills nationwide in the name 
of that Big Lie, making it harder for 
the American people to vote, making it 
harder for them to register, making it 
harder for people to vote early or to 
vote-by-mail because of a myth, be-
cause of a lie. 
Slashing the number of polling places 
and drop boxes. In Texas, they are 
down to one drop box per county. In 
Colorado, I can practically cross my 
street and vote at a drop box. This is 
an effort to subvert elections to cling 
to power. That is what is happening

January 6, 2022 
here, and it is based on a massive false-
hood, the Big Lie. 
I think one needs to ask oneself, even 
people who support President Trump: 
What future does the ‘‘stop the steal’’ 
movement imagine for our country? 
What future do they imagine for this 
democracy—where every election is 
going to be contested; where political 
violence replaces the ballot box; where 
elections are decided by strongmen, 
not votes, turning us into Russia or 
China. 
Is that really what we want our leg-
acy to be here in the country? Do we 
want to be the first generation of 
Americans to decide that it is just too 
hard to do our duty to the people who 
founded this country, the people who 
fought from the time this country was 
founded until today, who died for the 
sake of democracy; that it is just too 
hard; that somehow our differences are 
unique or so important that we are 
going to give up on our shared commit-
ment to the democracy in favor of 
those disagreements? 
I think we need to ask ourselves at a 
moment like this what we owe the gen-
erations of Americans that have fought 
to make this country more democratic, 
more fair and more free. What do we 
owe 
the 
158 
million 
Americans—a 
record—who 
showed 
up 
during 
a 
plague, this COVID pandemic, to cast 
their votes for Donald Trump and for 
Joe Biden? What are they owed and 
what do we owe our kids and our 
grandkids? I think the answer is very 
clear, which is a stronger democracy 
and economy that works for everybody, 
not just the people at the very top. 
And where do we begin? You know, 
Colorado, I think, is a great example 
where we have made it a lot easier for 
people to vote. We have one of the 
highest voter turnouts in the country. 
I always have to say, especially when 
the Senator from Minnesota is around, 
that we are No. 2 in terms of voter 
turnout. Minnesota is No. 1, but we are 
coming for you. And that is the spirit 
we should all have. We should be trying 
to get more people to vote, not fewer 
people to vote. We should have vote-by- 
mail. We should have early balloting. 
We have all of that in Colorado and one 
of the highest turnout rates in the 
Country and no fraud—no fraud. 
I am going to just finish by saying we 
should distrust politicians who can’t 
seem to win people’s votes with their 
argument, just as we should distrust 
politicians who attack the free press to 
avoid accountability, even though that 
free press is enshrined in our Constitu-
tion. And we should recommit to each 
other and the democracy. 
Let me tell you something, Mr. 
President. Last week, we had another 
tragedy in Colorado, another disaster. 
Pueblo, CO—or Boulder, CO, started 
out this year with a mass shooting in a 
grocery store. Some of you may re-
member that. And, basically, on New 
Year’s Eve, we had a massive fire that 
ripped through neighborhoods in the 
Front Range of Colorado in Boulder 
County. A thousand people—a thousand 
houses were burned. More than 30,000 
people lost their homes. I sat there 
thinking to myself, as I was with my 
daughters watching those fires on the 
television set, how much we actually 
need each other, you know? And there 
is a lot of evidence out there in those 
2 days that the law enforcement who 
got those 30,000 people out had almost 
literally no fatalities because of what 
they did and what they sacrificed. 
Coloradans stepped up that night and 
said: You can come to my house. We 
will put you up in my house. So out of 
those 30,000 people, there were fewer 
than 300 people in a shelter that night. 
The reporters, the journalists were 
out there long into the night reporting 
on that fire so that people might have 
some sense of whether their house had 
been lost or their house had been 
saved. Local county officials have 
worked tirelessly after flood and after 
fire and after natural disasters to come 
together to make sure that we build 
back stronger, which we always do in 
Colorado—and even, let me say, the 
Federal 
Government’s 
contribution, 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency—because if there is one reason 
that we should be one Nation under 
God, it is for a natural disaster like the 
one that just occurred in Colorado. 
This is our choice: We either save 
this democracy, which I believe we 
will, or we let it go. And it is going to 
be on us. If we let it go, generations of 
Americans are going to indict us. If we 
save it, I think they will celebrate the 
work we did here, just as we celebrate 
the work of the people who came before 
us who made our country more demo-
cratic, more fair, and more free. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I want to thank 
my colleague from Colorado for re-
minding us of how important it is for 
us to come together as Americans to 
protect our communities and to pro-
tect our country. That is really why we 
are all here today on the floor of the 
Senate because, 1 year ago today, we 
witnessed a violent attack on this Cap-
itol and on our democracy itself. 
It was not a sneak attack by a for-
eign power, like Pearl Harbor. It was 
not an attack by a foreign terrorist 
group, like 9/11. It was an attack from 
within, and it was orchestrated and in-
stigated by the former President of the 
United States. 
One year later, while we have im-
proved the physical security of this 
Capitol, we have not secured our de-
mocracy. Our great American experi-
ment remains under as much threat 
today as it did a year ago, and we as 
Americans have a duty to come to-
gether to take action to protect it. 
The violent mob unleashed by Donald 
Trump a year ago stormed and sacked 
this Capitol. Insurrectionists scaled 
the ramparts, tore through the barri-
cades, and breached this building. They 
used flagpoles to beat Officer Michael 
Fanone and used chemical spray to as-
sault Officer Brian Sicknick, who trag-
ically died the next day. A gallows was 
built outside of this Capitol while riot-
ers chanted ‘‘hang Mike Pence.’’ Like 
many others, I recall watching horri-
fying television footage of a rioter 
pulling down an American flag and 
raising up a Trump flag in its place. 
Confederate flags and banners of far- 
right extremist groups were paraded 
through these halls. This citadel of our 
democracy was violently attacked. The 
Capitol Hill community was trauma-
tized and so was the country. 
But in that dark hour when our de-
mocracy was under attack, members of 
the U.S. Capitol Police, the National 
Guard, and the DC Metropolitan Police 
stepped up and answered the call. 
There were many stories of bravery 
from that day, but I want to draw at-
tention to Officer Eugene Goodman, a 
Marylander who protected our democ-
racy by diverting the mob away from 
this Senate Chamber. His actions on 
January 6 saved lives, and Maryland is 
proud to call him one of our own. It is 
because of the courage of Officer Good-
man, his fellow officers, and many 
other heroes that the mob was ulti-
mately forced to retreat and the Sen-
ate and the House were able to recon-
vene to finish the certification of the 
electoral count. That was the job that 
we had all come here to do on January 
6, 2021, and that was the job the rioters 
had tried to stop. 
They were driven to violence by Don-
ald Trump’s Big Lie that the 2020 elec-
tion was stolen, and they were hell- 
bent on answering his call to overturn 
the results of that election and over-
turn the will of the American people. 
They failed in that effort. On that day, 
all of us were determined not to leave 
this place until we got the job done and 
certified the vote. And that is what we 
did. 
And when we returned to the Senate 
floor after the attack on our Capitol, I 
really believed, for those few hours, 
that most Members of this Senate ap-
preciated the gravity of the moment 
we had just lived through. 
I had real hope that all of us, regard-
less of party or politics, felt the weight 
of history upon us. I had hoped that 
most of us grasped the idea that the 
machinery of our democracy does not 
operate automatically; it is not self- 
executing, that institutions are ulti-
mately only as strong as the people 
who safeguard them, that it is up to 
each and every one of us to nurture and 
protect our democracy, that we are the 
current stewards of our Republic’s tra-
dition of the peaceful transfer of power. 
I really believed that night that that 
was a shared belief in this Senate. In 
my remarks when we returned that 
evening, I described the attack as a 
wake-up call to the country for all of 
us as Americans. That day showed us 
exactly what can happen when we fail 
to come together—not as Republicans 
or Democrats but as Americans, to 
stand up for the truth, to stand up for

January 6, 2022 
our democracy, and to stand up against 
lies that undermine public confidence 
and faith in our elections. 
That day showed us, in a violent and 
undeniable way, that if we allowed the 
poison of the Big Lie to continue to 
spread, our democracy would continue 
to be under threat. I hoped we would 
heed the warning of that horrible day. 
And I was pleased to work with col-
leagues here, including the Senator 
from Minnesota and others, to help for-
tify the physical security of our Cap-
itol Building. We have delivered addi-
tional resources to the Capitol Police. 
We selected a new Sergeant of Arms 
and a new Chief of the Capitol Police. 
And we are continuing to implement 
the other key recommendations that 
have been made to strengthen the secu-
rity of Capitol Hill. While we are im-
proving the physical security here on 
Capitol Hill, we are failing in our larg-
er duty to the American people. 
We have failed to stop the spread of 
the Big Lie and its corrosive impact on 
the confidence in our democracy. We 
know that Joe Biden beat Donald 
Trump in a free and fair election, and 
yet too many of our Republican col-
leagues 
put 
political 
convenience 
ahead of country and ahead of our Con-
stitution. 
Too many are afraid to state the 
facts and tell the American people the 
simple truth. And because of that fun-
damental failure, the Big Lie has me-
tastasized and represents a clear and 
present danger to the democratic proc-
ess throughout the country. 
When the violent mob failed to over-
turn the election results in this Cham-
ber a year ago today, the Big Lie did 
not end. It materialized in other forms 
to undermine our democracy. As we 
speak, Republican-controlled State leg-
islatures, fueled by the Big Lie, are 
passing laws making it harder for peo-
ple to vote—especially people of color, 
people with disabilities, and younger 
voters. 
In addition to putting up barriers to 
voting, proponents of the Big Lie are 
stripping power from election officials 
who dared to challenge Donald Trump’s 
plot to falsely claim victory in the 2020 
election. The Georgia General Assem-
bly removed Georgia Secretary of 
State Brad Raffensperger as head of 
the State election board after he de-
nied Trump’s request to ‘‘find 11,780 
votes,’’ the exact number he needed to 
defeat Joe Biden in Georgia. It was not 
enough that Raffensperger, a loyal Re-
publican, had voted for Donald Trump. 
His offense was failure to implement 
the Big Lie. 
In Michigan, Republicans are moving 
to saturate election wards with Big Lie 
loyalists in an effort to control the 
counting of ballots. And across the 
country, other laws are being passed at 
the State level that would authorize 
partisan officials to change or overturn 
the results of elections, even after 
votes have been cast and counted. 
What we are witnessing is an all-out, 
continuing assault on our democracy. 
And the longer we wait, the more the 
threat grows. The clock is ticking. Now 
is the time to act. 
That is why we must establish uni-
form national standards to protect ac-
cess to the ballot box and ensure that 
our elections reflect the will of the 
American people, not the political 
wishes of any party or any one person. 
That is exactly what the Freedom to 
Vote Act does and why we must pass it. 
This bill would defend every Ameri-
can’s right to the ballot. The Freedom 
to Vote Act also helps protect election 
officials 
from 
unfair 
removal 
and 
guards against attempts to tamper 
with or change election results. 
In addition, the bill contains provi-
sions to keep our elections fair and 
honest, including crucial campaign fi-
nance reform and a ban on partisan 
gerrymandering. An enactment of the 
Freedom to Vote Act should go hand in 
hand with the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act to restore the 
full protections guaranteed by the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965. 
While I had hoped that action to pre-
serve our democracy would be a bipar-
tisan endeavor, it is clear that our Sen-
ate Republican colleagues are not will-
ing to join us in passing these bills. 
Efforts to strike a compromise have 
been met with virtually zero support 
on the other side of the aisle. Demo-
crats are willing to move forward our-
selves to protect our democracy, but 
our 
Republican 
colleagues 
have 
weaponized the current filibuster rule 
and are using it to thwart progress. 
They have even blocked our attempt to 
have a debate on voting rights when we 
raised the issue 6 months ago. 
Those actions are undermining the 
very spirit, the tradition, and function 
of this Senate. The Senate was de-
signed to promote vigorous and long 
debate while also respecting the ulti-
mate will of a majority of Senators and 
a majority of the American people. 
Today, we see the opposite: very lit-
tle real debate on the Senate floor and 
the denial—the denial—of a majority 
vote to resolve the big questions of the 
day, resulting in the denial of the will 
of the American people. 
We can change that. We have to 
change that. We can change it by 
adapting the current rules of the Sen-
ate to restore the original intent of the 
Framers. We must do that for the 
health of our institutions and the good 
of our democracy. 
James McHenry, Maryland’s delegate 
to 
the 
Constitutional 
Convention, 
wrote in his diaries about a famous ex-
change between Elizabeth Willing Pow-
ell and Benjamin Franklin. He wrote: 
A lady asked Dr. Franklin Well Doctor 
what have we got a republic or a monarchy— 
A republic replied the Doctor if you can keep 
it. 
A year ago today on this floor, I 
quoted this exact exchange. And now, 
on the 1-year anniversary of January 6, 
we are still met with the same question 
and same test of whether or not we can 
muster the will to do what must be 
done to keep our Republic. There is 
still time. We can still repair and sus-
tain our democracy. 
One year ago, we did not allow a vio-
lent mob to prevent us from staying 
right here to do our job. We completed 
the certification of the Presidential 
election, but our job is not over. We 
have not finished the job of security or 
democracy. 
Now is the time for us to do that. 
Let’s come together and do what is 
necessary and right for our Republic, 
for our democracy, and for the Amer-
ican people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am so 
happy to join my colleagues on the 
floor in a very solemn effort to think 
through the meaning, at a 1-year anni-
versary, of the attack upon the Capitol 
on January 6. 
Today is not only that anniversary. 
Today, in the Christian tradition, is 
the Feast of the Epiphany. And I re-
membered, sitting in the Chamber last 
year, as we were barricaded in, under 
attack, and with the confusion all 
around me, at one point I realized: 
Today is the Feast of the Epiphany— 
the Feast of the Epiphany, January 6. 
What is Epiphany? The Feast of the 
Epiphany celebrates the arrival of the 
magi at the manger. Wise men of the 
day saw a portent and disturbance in 
the sky, and were led to a place where 
they believed something remarkable 
would happen. 
What they found completely sur-
prised them. It wasn’t what they were 
expecting. It wasn’t power. It wasn’t 
pomp. It wasn’t majesty. It was a tiny 
baby, born to a family too humble to 
even get a room at an inn, lying with 
his mother in a stable, surrounded by 
barnyard animals. 
They found something that they 
couldn’t have imagined, and it changed 
their lives and it changed the world. 
Why do I reference the Feast of the 
Epiphany? I reference it because, like 
many things in the Christian story, it 
has gone way beyond Christianity. 
By the middle 1700s or 1800s, the word 
‘‘epiphany’’ now had a broader use. It 
was not just about the arrival of the 
magi at the manger. The word ‘‘epiph-
any’’ now means something much more 
widespread in the English language. It 
is defined as a moment in which you 
suddenly see something in a new or 
very clear way. 
The word ‘‘epiphany’’ comes from a 
Greek root meaning reveal. All of us— 
all of us—no matter how long we have 
been around, have the capacity for 
epiphanies—deeper understandings of 
essential truths that reveal themselves 
in our lives. 
I want to talk about January 6 and 
one epiphany I have had as a result of 
it. 
Before I do, I want to acknowledge 
five people, five Virginia law enforce-
ment officers, who lost their lives in 
the days after the Capitol attack.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S72 
January 6, 2022 
I thank my colleague Senator WAR-
NER, who talked at really important 
length about the contributions of the 
Virginia State Police and the VA Na-
tional Guard. I want to focus on five 
people: Brian Sicknick, U.S. Capitol 
Police, 42-year-old, after service in the 
military, had been with the Capitol Po-
lice for 13 years, dying immediately 
after the attack because of injuries he 
received that day; Jeffrey Smith, an-
other Virginian, 35 years old, 12-year 
patrolman with the Metropolitan Po-
lice Department, died after the attack, 
by suicide; Howie Liebengood, 51 years 
old, a 15-year veteran of the U.S. Cap-
itol Police, died shortly after the at-
tack, by suicide; Kyle DeFreytag, 26- 
year-old, 5-year veteran of the Metro-
politan Police Department, died a few 
days after the attack, by suicide; Gun-
ther Hashida, 43 years old, an 18-year 
veteran of the Metropolitan Police De-
partment, died in the days after the at-
tack, by suicide—all Virginians. 
I am haunted by these deaths, and I 
will say, I am particularly haunted by 
those who died by suicide, whose fami-
lies are now fighting to get line-of-duty 
benefits for their deaths. 
All of us, in our lives, have been af-
fected by suicide in families and 
friends. And suicide is complicated. 
There is not a single thing, as you dig 
into a suicide, but I just use the in-
sights I have gained as a member of the 
Armed Services Committee, together 
with you, Mr. President. 
Over the time we have been here, 
there has been a slight shift in under-
standing of causes of suicide within the 
military. 
The conventional wisdom about it, 
when I came here, was that suicide was 
driven, maybe, as a principal factor in 
the military and among veterans be-
cause of the cumulative effects of trau-
ma. The trauma was so significant that 
that led to suicide. Of course, trauma 
is a key factor, but a more recent un-
derstanding of suicide suggests that an 
even more important factor may not be 
trauma, but a sense of abandonment. 
I was in a military unit. I had a lot 
of people around me. They had my 
back. We were close. We were con-
nected. We were really tight. And then 
I moved into a civilian world, where I 
didn’t have that connection and people 
didn’t have my back, and I was lost, 
and I didn’t know whom to turn to or 
who would look out for me. 
I am haunted by the deaths of these 
four Virginians to suicide because I 
wonder if they felt abandoned. Did they 
feel abandoned by us? 
They were fighting that day to save 
our democracy, to save this Capitol, 
and to save their lives, and yet 147 of 
the 535 Members of Congress voted with 
the mob to overturn the election, to 
throw out the democracy, to do the 
bidding of a would-be authoritarian. 
If you are fighting to protect these 
535 Members of Congress and this insti-
tution and you watch nearly 30 percent 
of 
the 
Members 
side 
with 
the 
attackers, I would suggest that they 
might have felt abandoned. 
When I was here on January 6, I expe-
rienced a lot of emotions, and I am just 
going to describe two: relief and anger. 
Relief? How could that day create a 
sense of relief? 
I was relieved that I had told my 
staff to stay home. My chief of staff 
disobeyed me. But I was relieved that I 
had told my staff to stay home. Thank 
God, they were safe. 
I was relieved to look right here and 
see no pages. I was relieved that pages 
were not here in this Chamber, be-
cause, thank God, they would be safe. 
And I was relieved not only because 
my staff was safe, but I was relieved 
because I didn’t want their youthful, 
altruistic, public-service motivation to 
be damaged or demoralized by what 
was happening that day. 
I expressed this to my staff this 
morning. I sent a note to them, and I 
said: In the middle of all these emo-
tions, I was relieved that you weren’t 
here; that I had told you to stay home 
so you wouldn’t be in danger like so 
many were. But I don’t want you to be 
demoralized by what happened. 
And I had a staff member come to me 
right before I came to the floor and 
said: January 6 didn’t demoralize me; 
it energized me. 
Thank God for that. 
The second emotion that was so pow-
erful in me, and even so powerful that 
I couldn’t quite understand it, was 
anger. Now, of course, anger would be 
an acceptable and completely under-
standable reaction to what was going 
on. And I have known anger in my life, 
but the anger I felt that day was dif-
ferent than what I had felt in 63 years. 
There was something different about 
it. 
And it took me months—it took me 
months—to figure it out. Was it just 
the physical attack? Was it the friends 
and staff and other people who were in 
danger? Yeah, that was all part of it. 
It took me months to figure out ex-
actly why I was so angry. And then I 
had an epiphany. I had an epiphany. 
No one in my life had ever tried to 
disenfranchise me. I am a White male, 
born in 1958. I am a civil rights lawyer 
in the capital of the Confederacy, 
fighting for voting rights for all kinds 
of people. Of course, voting rights were 
important. I was passionately com-
mitted to it in my professional life be-
fore I came here, but it was something 
that I was sort of, you know, trying to 
do to help others. No one had ever tried 
to disenfranchise me. 
But what was going on on the floor 
that day was an effort to object to the 
very first State, as you went through 
them alphabetically, that had voted for 
Joe Biden, to object to that State and 
try to disenfranchise, through that ob-
jection and others that were lined up, 
the 80 million people who had voted for 
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. All of us 
who cast our ballots that way, we were 
being disenfranchised that day. 
It had never happened to me before. 
For some Americans, they had experi-
enced 
disenfranchisement 
often 
in 
their lives. Some Americans have expe-
rienced 
disenfranchisement 
during 
their whole lives. Some Americans 
have experienced disenfranchisement 
not for 4 hours but for 4 centuries. It 
had never happened to me. 
For a few hours, and just a few—and 
just a few—I felt the pain of those who 
have faced disenfranchisement efforts 
to take away or threaten their vote for 
their whole lives, and I hated it. I 
hated that feeling. I hated that feeling. 
My epiphany was one of empathy: So 
this is how it feels when others scheme 
to take your vote, when they try to ex-
clude you, when they try to say you 
don’t count. This is how it feels. It 
hadn’t happened to me before, and for a 
few hours, it did. 
The next morning, I walked into the 
Capitol and the Sun was shining and 
the threat to me was past. We had fin-
ished the work. The insurrection de-
layed the certification and peaceful 
transfer of power, but it couldn’t stop 
it. 
But the epiphany of briefly being in 
the shoes of those who have been disen-
franchised throughout their lives has 
changed 
me 
profoundly. 
It 
hasn’t 
changed my personality. It hasn’t 
changed my relationships. But it has 
changed my priorities. 
Again, I was a civil rights lawyer 
doing voting rights work in the capital 
of the Confederacy. Protecting the 
right to vote has always been impor-
tant to me. Protecting the integrity of 
campaigns and elections have always 
been important to me. But now it is be-
yond that. It is not just an important 
priority, it is an existential necessity 
that we respond to the mass disenfran-
chisement effort of January 6, with 
guaranteeing the franchise; guaran-
teeing people’s right to vote; guaran-
teeing that, when they vote, they can 
be secure that their vote will be count-
ed; guaranteeing that they can trust 
the integrity of the officials that will 
call the outcomes of elections. 
My epiphany of empathy has put me 
in the shoes, for a few hours, of those 
who have experienced disenfranchise-
ment, and I have concluded that the 
only response to that has to be—has to 
be—a concerted effort to protect voting 
and protect the democracy that relies 
upon it. 
I will say this and conclude: January 
6 will always be remembered as the at-
tack on the Capitol. January 6 will al-
ways be the Feast of the Epiphany. 
January 6 was a day in our history of 
epiphanies. 
But what is the purpose of an epiph-
any? Is it just to kind of see things a 
new way? 
I think the purpose of an epiphany is 
to change your life; it is to be sur-
prised. Go and see something that you 
didn’t expect, and then be willing to 
adjust your life and your priority as 
proof that you were paying attention. 
We will be faced with a most signifi-
cant decision in the coming days. Hav-
ing been the 100 Senators out of the 
2,000 in history who have inhabited this

Chamber who were here during the at-
tack, will we understand what hap-
pened, absorb that epiphany, and then 
act to protect people’s rights to par-
ticipate in this democracy? 
I pray that we will. I pray that we 
will. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I stand 
here today with a sober heart. I am a 
big believer that if America hasn’t bro-
ken your heart, you probably don’t 
love her enough. 
We are here on the 1-year anniver-
sary of one of our great Nation’s mo-
ments of shame. 
We saw a violent attack on this Cap-
itol, ignited and incited by demagogues 
who were trying to spread a lie; telling 
people their votes were stolen by a 
President who broke with our tradi-
tions of a peaceful transfer of power 
and told his supporters to come to this 
building. 
(Mr. VAN HOLLEN assumed the 
Chair.) 
On that day of that vicious attack, 
we saw heroic actions by men and 
women who stood in the breach to try 
to protect the 535 Members of Congress, 
their staffs—the people in this body 
who do so much good to keep this Na-
tion’s traditions moving. As a result of 
that conflict, lives were lost. Brian 
Sicknick from my State died as a re-
sult of his injuries. 
The feelings of that day are still with 
me. I was sitting right here next to 
friends and colleagues as we were told 
to stay in our seats, as we were told 
that the Capitol was under attack. I 
watched the basic decency of people in 
this room as staffers came in, in tears 
and in pain, and the comforting that I 
saw of some of my colleagues, and I 
watched other staff members pro-
tecting historic artifacts, protecting 
the very boxes that would ensure that 
our tradition would continue; that here 
on this Earth, a nation would be 
formed that values that highest ideals 
of humanity; that the people can come 
together and form amongst them a sys-
tem of government. 
We were escorted out that door, and 
I think the gravity of it really hit me 
when we came right out that door, and 
one of the first things I saw was an of-
ficer down. 
I rushed over, and I said: ‘‘What hap-
pened?’’ 
He said: ‘‘I was hit. I was hit.’’ 
All along our retreat in that igno-
minious moment, all along that re-
treat, we saw officers injured. 
I eventually walked and worked my 
way to my office, and I will never for-
get this moment as long as I live. I felt 
not just my own pain, but I thought 
immediately of my dad, and I felt the 
pain of my ancestors because, when I 
turned on that screen, the very first 
thing I saw was the Confederate flag, 
and it all came rushing to my heart, 
and I felt an ache and a hurt. My heart 
was broken. 
I know that day shocked a lot of peo-
ple, but when I saw that flag, it con-
nected to a current of the dark eddies 
of our Nation’s history that have per-
sisted because violent mobs from the 
beginning of our country have tried to 
stop our democratic traditions. 
That flag in so many communities in 
this country is carried by Klansmen, 
carried by those who took democrat-
ically 
elected 
officials—Blacks 
in 
Southern States—ripped them from 
their offices, dragged judges out into 
the street, beat them, lynched them. 
That was their flag. 
As I watched from my office, I saw 
swastikas. I saw Muslim hate. I talked 
to Black officers here, and as they de-
fended the country they loved, they 
were repeatedly called the N-word over 
and over again. You can’t be surprised. 
You just can’t. 
As we have always, in every genera-
tion, tried to make a more perfect 
union, this is part of that story—people 
who want to stop the march of democ-
racy. Do you think that the suffrage 
movement didn’t face violence? It did, 
as people tried to intimidate and beat 
and stop the equal franchise. Do you 
think the civil rights movement didn’t 
face violence? How many martyrs’ 
names do we know, people who were 
shot down and killed because they did 
not want them to have equal represen-
tation? 
Why did I ache for my ancestors? Be-
cause those were the stories of my 
grandparents, those were the stories of 
my father, of the fear and intimidation 
of just trying to exercise their fran-
chise. 
Why are we surprised by dema-
goguery and hate in our Nation? It is a 
part of our story. But the greatness of 
our country is not that that existed 
but the good people who have come to-
gether in every generation and said: 
Not on our watch. We are better than 
this. We will pull together, out of the 
great, vast diversity of our Nation, a 
rainbow coalition of people dedicated 
not to a race or religion but to a na-
tional ideal. 
I am here as a Senator, just the 
fourth Black person ever elected popu-
larly in our Nation’s history. I am here 
because White folks and Black folks 
and Asian folks and all Americans 
didn’t just hope for a better democ-
racy, didn’t just condemn violence; 
they worked to preserve and protect 
and advance our Nation. 
What are we doing now? Is this going 
to be a day where we just condemn 
what happened? Is this just going to be 
a day where we point fingers of blame 
and feel good in our contempt for those 
who were at the core of that? If that is 
what this day is about, it is for naught 
because we fail then to recognize this 
is not about a day. This was not 1 day. 
It was not one moment. It is a part of 
our story, and the threats continue. 
How can we be blind to the violence 
that has continued since that day? 
Threats on Federal judges—we had a 
Federal judge’s family shot and killed 
in my State. They are up 300, 400 per-
cent. Threats on Members of this body, 
threats on all 535 Congresspeople are 
up around twofold. 
Do you think this is about a day, 
when election officials, nonpartisan 
people, all across this country are now 
seeing threats? Reuters documented 
more than 850 threatening, hostile mes-
sages aimed at election officials. In 
Philadelphia, a Republican who dared 
to tell the truth about the election, 
mirroring the words of then-President 
Donald Trump’s highest official that 
the election was fair—what happened 
to him? Threats and intimidation. Peo-
ple calling his home, literally threat-
ening to murder his three children. 
You think this is about 1 day in 
time? 
A survey from the Brennan Center 
for Justice in April of 2021 found that 
one in three U.S. American election of-
ficials feels unsafe because of their job, 
and about 20 percent listed threats to 
their lives as a job-related concern. 
This is not a foreign country. This is 
the United States of America, and our 
election officials, nonpartisan individ-
uals—Republicans, Democrats, fellow 
Americans—are afraid to do their job 
because they tell the truth. 
This is not about 1 day. This is not. 
This is a story of the founding of our 
country. As our Founders tried to 
break with the course of human events 
and establish here the greatest experi-
ment of humanity, there were people 
who wanted authoritarianism; there 
were people who wanted bigotry; there 
were people who wanted to protect 
with violence the kind of despotism 
that we broke away from. 
We make a big mistake if on this 
day, we just talk about what happened 
here. We have protection. We have se-
curity. But all across this country 
right now, there are believers in this 
democracy who have the same fears 
that my grandparents did, the same 
fears that my father did, the same fear 
that Blacks and Whites who joined 
arms to march across the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge for voting rights did. 
This is a cancer. It has always been 
here. And we make a tragic mistake 
just by talking about this day, because 
when I survey the United States of 
America, I am so worried. There has 
never been a time in my life where I 
have been more worried about this de-
mocracy. 
I grew up with stories of family mem-
bers who talked about the preciousness 
about what it is to vote. They love the 
heroes of John F. Kennedy and Medgar 
Evers and these people who fought for 
them from all backgrounds. My parents 
taught me to love people—Jewish peo-
ple, like Abraham Joshua Heschel and 
Joachim Prinz; people who knew that 
in America, if you just fight for your 
own rights, who are you? This is a na-
tion where we know we are all in this. 
But I stand here today to ask you, 
why aren’t we talking about the fact 
that in States right now, laws are 
being passed specifically designed to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S74 
January 6, 2022 
disenfranchise people? Don’t take my 
word for it. The year I came to this 
body, in 2013, a Federal judge in North 
Carolina looked at that voting law and 
said it was designed ‘‘with surgical-like 
precision’’ 
to 
disenfranchise 
Black 
Americans. 
But I don’t need to go back to 2013 to 
see reason for us all to be concerned. 
When early voting started in the fall of 
2020 in Georgia, some voters had to 
wait up to 10 hours to vote in six metro 
areas in Georgia counties—six metro 
areas. 
At polling places where minorities 
constituted more than 90 percent of ac-
tive, registered voters, the average 
wait time in the evening for those 
Black communities was 51 minutes. 
When Whites comprised 90 percent, in 
those communities, the average wait 
time was 6 minutes. Think about this 
for a second. Are we satisfied with a de-
mocracy where in some communities, 
the Black communities will have to 
wait eight times longer to vote? Is that 
what we mean, equal justice under the 
law? Is that what we mean when we 
look at our flag and say ‘‘liberty and 
justice for all’’? 
There are States right now passing 
voting laws to make it harder to vote. 
What happens when a working mom 
with three kids shows up, and the line 
is a 1-hour wait or a 2-hour wait? What 
does she do? Is it fair to her? Then they 
go as far in Georgia—say that person 
does want to wait and brings a folding 
chair and sits there for 2 and 3 and 4 
hours. They make it illegal, for that 
person who might have diabetes, ille-
gal, for that person who might have a 
mental condition, for someone to bring 
them water. 
I am sorry. I grew up—and I confess 
it on the Senate floor—with the naive 
belief that the stories of my father and 
the stories of my grandparents were 
history; that we wouldn’t live in a 
country where Black people are wait-
ing eight, nine times the wait of White 
people; that in some communities, the 
wait would be 5, 6, 7 hours—a day’s 
work for families who can’t afford to 
give up a day’s work. 
You think this was about a day? I 
tell you it is about the cancer in our 
democracy that has been here from its 
start. This country’s very survival has 
to be faced every generation. Democ-
racy is not certain. It is not automatic. 
Democracy is hard. 
Democracy takes work. Democracy 
takes sacrifice, but as we sit here now, 
in dozens of States, laws are being 
passed that disproportionately impact 
the disabled, that disproportionately 
impact Native Americans, and that dis-
proportionately impact people of color. 
So when I go back to the Confederate 
flag I saw waving just feet from where 
we stand right now—a flag that got so 
much currency during the backlash 
after Reconstruction and that got so 
much currency during the backlash 
after Brown v. Board of Education—I 
know it is part of a larger problem and 
that none of us who love our Nation 
and love this democracy can ever rest. 
There are two people I want to men-
tion before I conclude, both men I have 
come to admire. Both men risked their 
lives for this country. They weren’t 
like our great, great veterans who 
fought nobly—and many of them died— 
but I hope we don’t cheapen the truth 
of their stories because they did the 
work here at home, evidencing our 
highest values when our Founders 
wrote in the Declaration of Independ-
ence that we must mutually pledge our 
lives, our fortunes, and our sacred 
honor. 
Both of these men happen to be 
Black, but it is a value that is evi-
denced in all backgrounds and all peo-
ple. I am here because of that truth. 
Both of them were riddled with hateful 
words, called the N-word over and over 
and over again. One of those men I had 
the privilege of serving with, and both 
of these men were violently attacked. 
John Lewis was violently attacked as 
he tried to advance this democracy. He 
was beaten and had his head cracked 
open on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. He 
was spit on at sit-ins, and he won bat-
tles with others. He came to Congress, 
and he worked and fought and de-
fended. 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
sup-
ported the voting rights bill, but then 
it was gutted by the Supreme Court. 
Maybe you will have the experience I 
have had of when your heroes become 
your friends. I would ask him how it 
felt to watch part of his life’s work be 
torn apart and have these new voting 
laws that disproportionately impact 
African Americans. How did it feel? 
John Lewis, who was this man of 
peace and this man of grace, just said 
to me: You cannot stop the work of 
this democracy. One generation’s gains 
don’t pass on like an inheritance to the 
next. They have to earn them. 
The other person is a guy named 
Harry Dunn. Like John Lewis, he put 
his life on the line in defending the 
Capitol. He is a Capitol Police Officer. 
When I read and saw his interviews 
after battling to save our lives against 
a mob incited by a demagogic Presi-
dent, he was sitting under the Rotunda 
and turned to another person after 
being called the N-word over and over 
again and said simply: ‘‘Is this Amer-
ica?’’ 
I hope all of us see that we have a re-
sponsibility to answer that question. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act and the Freedom to 
Vote Act will be part of the answer to 
that question of whether a little Black 
boy and a little Black girl and a little 
White girl and a little White boy who 
go to vote with their parents can see 
an equal voting opportunity. That is 
going to be an answer to that question. 
Every generation has got to make this 
country live up to its promise. We are 
losing ground, and it didn’t start on 
January 6 of last year. 
I end with an answer, an inadequate 
answer, to Officer Dunn, in a poem I 
learned from my parents and in a poem 
I shared an affection for with John 
Lewis that calls upon every American 
not to point fingers of blame to others 
but to accept a responsibility not just 
to be satisfied in your contempt for 
some but to rise up as a force of light 
and love for all. 
I end with Langston Hughes’ poem: 
O, let America be America again— 
The land that never has been yet— 
[But] yet must be—the land where [everyone] 
is free . . . the poor [man], [Indian], 
[Negro], ME— 
Who made America . . . 
Whose faith and pain, 
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in 
the rain, 
Must [make this] mighty dream [live] again. 
O, yes, 
I say it plain, 
America never was America to me, 
And yet I swear this oath— 
America will be! 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, first, I 
want to thank Senator BOOKER for his 
powerful, 
powerful 
statement. 
The 
whole country has to hear what he 
said. 
I want to thank Senator KAINE for 
your powerful words as well. It is just 
so important that people of your stat-
ure speak to our country on what we 
should be aspiring to do. Thank you for 
your leadership. 
Thank you to Senator KLOBUCHAR for 
organizing this incredibly important 
moment on the first anniversary of the 
insurrection against the Capitol. 
One year ago, my colleagues and I 
started the day in this Chamber, ready 
to ratify the electoral college votes 
and declare Joe Biden the next Presi-
dent of the United States. Instead, 
Members of Congress were forced to 
take shelter under their desks and 
under Gallery benches, place gas masks 
over their heads, and pray that they 
would make it home to their families 
that day. Our staffs, journalists, Cap-
itol workers wondered if they would 
live through the day, and their views of 
their workplace changed forever. 
Instead of a day celebrating the 
workings of our democracy, our Nation 
was met with anti-democratic, White 
supremacist forces storming their way 
inside this building, violently attempt-
ing to overturn the results of the 2020 
election. It was an insurrection. 
One year ago, the people’s Houses 
changed, but even though the ratifica-
tion process, which recognizes the will 
of the American people, was inter-
rupted, it was not defeated. On the 
night of January 6, 2021, as Members of 
Congress returned to the Chamber to 
ratify the results of the election of 
2020, our democracy prevailed. 
We thank the Capitol Police. We 
thank them for what they did that day. 
Some lost their lives. Some were in-
jured. Some still suffer from the trau-
matic impact of what they had to do in 
order to protect these Chambers, in 
order to protect the electoral college 
votes that were in the well of this 
Chamber. The whole country owes a

debt of obligation to those police offi-
cers and what they did to stand here 
and to protect all of us—the staff, the 
Members, the Parliamentarians—but 
to, more importantly, protect democ-
racy because we were able to return 
here after 8 p.m. that night in order to 
cast those votes. We owe a great debt 
of gratitude to those police officers 
who sacrificed so much on that day. 
Tragically, former President Donald 
Trump’s Big Lie has turned into the 
Big Threat to our democracy. The in-
surrectionists 
were 
unsuccessful 
in 
overturning election results, but the 
death, injury, and breach of national 
security they caused must be held to 
account. 
I want to thank the House of Rep-
resentatives’ Select Committee to In-
vestigate the January 6th Attack for 
their commitment to that ongoing mis-
sion as well as the hard-working men 
and women of the Department of Jus-
tice who have already brought charges 
against more than 725 individuals for 
their involvement in the insurrection. 
Donald Trump does lie, but the video, 
texts, and messages from January 6 do 
not lie. We all saw what happened that 
day, and anyone who orchestrated, 
abetted, or participated in the January 
6 attack must be held accountable. 
That includes those at the very highest 
level of our government. It means, as 
Attorney General Merrick Garland said 
yesterday, ‘‘follow[ing] the facts wher-
ever they [may] lead.’’ If the facts lead 
to Donald Trump’s criminal responsi-
bility for the insurrection, then he 
should face the same consequences as 
anyone else, even if it means the only 
place he will be in 2024 is in jail. 
Even as we now reflect on this day 1 
year later, we must understand that in-
vestigation and prosecution alone will 
not prevent another attack on our de-
mocracy. This problem is larger than 
any one person or candidate or election 
cycle. We cannot forget the role that 
online platforms played during the 
lead-up to the insurrection. Make no 
mistake, social media platforms have 
become hotbeds of disinformation, hate 
speech, and dangerous conspiracy theo-
ries. Today, the seeds of offline harms 
are planted, grown, and spread online. 
In the days before insurrectionists 
attacked the building, social media 
platforms, black boxes, algorithms pro-
moted election misinformation and po-
litical groups that spread Trump’s Big 
Lie. We need to open the hood to the 
online systems that are pushing toxic 
content to the public and feeding dan-
gerous social movements online. 
But the January 6 mob was fueled 
not only by the Big Lie but by the 
global rise of authoritarian and nation-
alist movements that reject the basic 
principles of American democracy of 
quality, freedom, and the peaceful 
transfer of power. The attack on the 
Capitol revealed the growing fragility 
in our democratic processes and insti-
tutions 
and 
a 
systemic 
weakness 
caused by years of falsehoods and poli-
cies meant to undermine our right to 
vote in free and fair elections. It is un-
bearable to think that a big part of 
America no longer believes in any kind 
of democracy. They no longer believe 
in the rules that we all live by and the 
pursuit of goodness and fairness and 
progress. 
Donald Trump is gone from the 
White House, but we know that the 
hate and division that defined his cor-
rupt tenure has been with us since our 
founding. So many were willing to be-
lieve lies about the legitimacy of Presi-
dent Biden’s victory because they had 
lost faith in the integrity of our demo-
cratic system. Some were even willing 
to engage in horrific violence because 
they believed elections could be stolen. 
The architects of the January 6 au-
thoritarians, White nationalists, and 
those who stand to benefit from the 
continued undermining of our democ-
racy want us to feel this way. 
For years, the dangerous coalition 
has worked to limit access to the bal-
lot box, undermine fair voting dis-
tricts, 
and 
continuously 
spread 
disinformation about voter fraud. In 
the wake of their attack on the Cap-
itol, they now have accelerated their 
efforts. In 2021 alone, 19 States have 
passed 34 laws restricting the access to 
voting, continuing the assault on our 
electoral system. These efforts have 
eroded Americans’ faith that they can 
actually choose their own elected Rep-
resentatives, sabotage public truth in 
electoral outcomes, and disenfranchise 
countless voters, especially commu-
nities of color, indigenous people, the 
poor, young Americans, and individuals 
with disabilities. 
The Big Lie is that the election was 
stolen from Donald Trump in 2020. It 
was not. The Big Truth is that Donald 
Trump and his allies have put in place 
a process to steal the election of 2022 
and 2024. That is the Big Truth of what 
is going on in this country, right now. 
And the way they are going to accom-
plish that Big Truth is by having State 
after State in the United States pass 
laws which restrict the access to vote 
for Black and Brown and indigenous, 
and poor and disabled Americans. That 
is the Big Truth about what is going on 
in our country right now—a systematic 
plan to steal the election of 2022, to 
steal the Presidency in 2024. 
And the Republican Party has be-
come a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Donald Trump on the issue of voter 
suppression, on the issue of making it 
impossible for this body, for the U.S. 
Congress, to pass laws which protect 
the rights of every American to vote. 
But we do have a chance, right now, 
on the Senate floor, to stand up to this 
anti-democratic movement and to ban-
ish these discriminatory policies and 
put them in the political dust bin of 
history. 
The Senate can and must take action 
to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act and the Freedom to 
Vote Act, and we must abolish the fili-
buster, if just for this issue, to protect 
the right to vote for every person in 
our country. 
With these bills, if we modify the fili-
buster, American voices will no longer 
be drowned out by special interests, by 
redistricting that keeps Black and 
Brown communities marginalized, and 
by voting laws that are reminiscent of 
poll taxes and literacy tests that were 
used for centuries to stop Black voters, 
minority voters from participating in 
our democracy. 
We need expanded early and mail-in 
voting. We need automatic and same- 
day voter registration. We need to 
make election day a national holiday. 
We need to get rid of hours-long voting 
lines. We need to ban partisan gerry-
mandering. We need to get dark money 
out of our elections. We need to end the 
discriminatory voting laws that re-
strict access to the ballot box on the 
basis of race and age and income and 
more. 
We now have the opportunity to 
make sure that every voice is heard in 
our democracy: the 85-year-old Black 
woman in Georgia who has waited 
hours to cast her ballot without even a 
bottle of water; the newly naturalized 
family in Arizona who took the bus 45 
minutes to the closest voting location, 
energized by the chance to fully par-
ticipate in American democracy; the 
mother of four in Massachusetts who 
works two jobs just to make ends meet 
and desperately needs that mail-in bal-
lot. These are the voices that the ugly 
mob of hate and violence and division 
that attacked the Capitol on January 6 
do not want to be heard in American 
politics, in 2022, in the United States of 
America. 
But will we stand up? We have to en-
sure that at our moment in American 
history, there is enough evidence to 
convict us of having stood up for de-
mocracy, of having fought for all of 
those who will otherwise be disenfran-
chised this year, 2022, in the United 
States of America. Otherwise, we will 
have been found wanting in preserving 
the foundations of our democracy, that 
we will have fixed this broken system 
of government that is being dismantled 
by Republicans across this country, 
State after State, with Republicans 
here in Washington unwilling to cast a 
single vote—not one Republican willing 
to stand up and say: We must pass laws 
to protect against what is happening in 
State after State to suppress the votes 
of Black and Brown and disabled and 
poor and indigenous Americans. 
With the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act and the Freedom to 
Vote Act, we will not only guarantee 
that all Americans can exercise their 
vote—their right to vote in free and 
fair elections—we can also counter the 
distrust and the disenfranchisement 
that the insurrectionists exploited on 
January 6. These reforms can restore 
Americans’ faith in the peaceful trans-
fer of power and prevent another at-
tempt at insurrection by ensuring we 
have a government that is truly of, by, 
and for the American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S76 
January 6, 2022 
One year after the attack on the Cap-
itol, we understand how fragile our de-
mocracy is and that the fight to pro-
tect it requires vigilance and clear- 
eyed determination. The very least we 
can offer the American people—all 
American people—on this day is our 
commitment to protect their right to 
vote. 
Former Attorney General Ramsey 
Clark, who helped draft the original 
Voting Rights Act in 1965, once said: 
A right is not what someone gives you; it’s 
what no one can take from you. 
Let us pass this historic legislation 
so that no one can take the funda-
mental right to vote away from those 
who rightfully have it today. 
The job of building and protecting a 
healthy and strong democracy is the 
sacred duty of this institution. The 
fate of the United States depends on us 
doing our jobs. May this day, January 
6, always remind us that we must never 
give up that fight. And, here, in 2022, 
let us win this fight on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate to protect the right to vote 
for every American, regardless of the 
State they live in, regardless of their 
color, their religion, their country of 
origin. That is our historic responsi-
bility. 
God help the Senate if it does not re-
spond to this historic challenge. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he 
leaves, I want to thank my colleague 
from Massachusetts. We have worked 
often together on these democracy 
issues, and I look forward to doing that 
in the days ahead. 
I also want to commend Senator KLO-
BUCHAR
from Minnesota because she 
has been our point person on the Rules 
Committee, which is central to this 
whole debate. I think we all understand 
what is at stake. That is what my col-
leagues have been outlining. And I 
think we have been very fortunate to 
have Senator KLOBUCHAR at the helm. 
She and I have worked together on one 
of the issues I am going to talk about, 
vote by mail, but I just want people to 
understand how valuable she has been. 
Mr. President and colleagues, a year 
ago today, not far from where we stand 
this 
afternoon, 
domestic 
terrorists 
tried to beat our democracy to the 
ground. They might have been success-
ful were it not for the police officers 
who defended our democracy as they 
were viciously attacked and beaten. 
Before anything else is said, in my 
view, by an elected official, we need to 
salute these officers and all those who 
work day in and day out alongside 
them here in the Capitol. For their 
courage, we ought to be internally 
grateful. 
The insurrection on January 6 was 
instigated by the former President, 
who wanted to undo the results of a 
democratic election. Let’s also under-
stand that, unfortunately, inciting the 
mob wasn’t the end of it. Donald 
Trump didn’t exactly walk quietly off 
into the sunset after the Biden inau-
guration. The effort to undermine our 
democracy, to end free and fair elec-
tions in America, goes on as we speak. 
Support for the Big Lie is essentially 
unchanged from where it was a year 
ago. An awful lot of Republicans who 
said after January 6 that they were 
done with the former President have 
cozied back up to him just 12 months 
later. The only reason the mob is not 
here today is Donald Trump didn’t 
summon them back. 
Now, in my view, it is our job to en-
sure that another attack like this, or 
by any other means, never succeeds. 
We will have more to say about those 
issues in the days ahead. 
In my view, protecting the vote has 
got to be step one in protecting democ-
racy. A guiding principle for the Sen-
ate must be that while politics may 
guide a citizen’s vote, it should never 
determine whether they are allowed to 
vote. To act otherwise would under-
mine the very foundations of a rep-
resentative 
democracy, 
empowering 
voters with a system built on integrity 
and accountability, a system that pro-
motes participation rather than dis-
courages it, a system with a real his-
tory of bipartisanship. 
I say to the Presiding Officer and col-
leagues, that is the kind we have in my 
home State of Oregon. Oregon believes 
so strongly in the right to vote that ev-
erybody gets a ballot sent straight to 
their home. 
I am honored to say that I was the 
first U.S. Senator elected in an all 
vote-by-mail election. Back then, it 
was Oregon Republicans who were 
pushing to expand vote-by-mail. A 
Democratic Governor even vetoed a 
vote-by-mail bill in 1995. Right after 
my election, the Oregon Republicans 
flipped back, and vote-by-mail was sud-
denly, oh, so bad. 
Everything flipped a few months 
later, when my friend, Gordon Smith, a 
Republican from eastern Oregon, be-
came the second U.S. Senator to be 
elected by mail. At this point, Oregon 
voters said: We have just had it with 
everybody looking for some kind of 
partisan slant here. We just think vote- 
by-mail is a really terrific idea. They 
went out to vote on a ballot measure, 
and they chose to make Oregon’s elec-
tions all vote-by-mail, passing it with 
70 percent of the vote in 1998. 
This, in my view, was the culmina-
tion of a process that started 40 years 
ago with some local elections in Linn 
County, a small county in the western 
part of our State. It grew and grew 
from there. Election officials learned 
that when you let people vote at home, 
participation goes up, and the costs go 
down. 
One of the biggest defenders of Or-
egon’s vote-at-home system was the 
late Dennis Richardson. He was our 
secretary of state. And by his charac-
terization, he was about as conserv-
ative—a Republican as you could get. 
But when the Trump era came along 
and people criticized our elections and 
said, ‘‘Oh, there is all this fraud,’’ 
spouting lies about it, the late Dennis 
Richardson stood up and said: I am a 
conservative 
Republican. 
They 
are 
wrong. They are wrong in what they 
are saying about Oregon. 
He even wrote to Donald Trump in 
2017: ‘‘We are confident that voter 
fraud in last November’s election did 
not occur in Oregon.’’ 
Every election now, young Orego-
nians 
watch 
their 
parents 
voting 
around their kitchen table, and it is a 
real inspiration to the next generation 
to make sure they are committed vot-
ers. Voting at home gives you the op-
portunity to be more informed. If there 
is a particular measure, initiative, or a 
race that you haven’t researched, you 
get time to look into the options. 
When you are done, your ballot goes 
into a security envelope, you sign the 
outside, and off it goes. For me, that is 
when I head from our home in South-
east Portland to the Sellwood branch 
of the Multnomah County Public Li-
brary, drop my ballot in the collection 
box, and head home—no long lines, no 
glitchy touchscreen systems, just has-
sle-free voting. 
A recent analysis in the Election 
Law Journal said that of all 50 States, 
voting is easiest in Oregon. And Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR, I have heard col-
leagues go back and forth to say who is 
No. 1 in participation and who is No. 1 
in all of these aspects. And I think, 
like a number of other States, we are 
all kind of competing for the highest 
turnout rates. We get some of the high-
est in the country. We have been a 
leader in terms of increasing turnout 
among Black and Latino voters. Voter 
registration is automatic. It is as easy 
as a trip to the Department of Motor 
Vehicles. 
For myself—and Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and I have talked about this so often 
over the years—I have been proposing 
legislation to have universal at-home 
voting since 2002. That is what my Vote 
at Home Act would do. It would give 
every American the right to vote the 
Oregon way, the vote that my neigh-
bors and I can do. I will say here on the 
Senate floor that I guarantee that, if 
you do it the Oregon way, it will be a 
nationwide hit immediately. 
Letting people vote at home is also 
the best defense against some of the 
really horrendous methods of sup-
pressing the vote; for example, what we 
have seen over the last few years with 
State and local governments shutting 
polling places, particularly ones that 
serve Black and Latino voters—what 
unforgivable actions. 
These days, in some areas, Repub-
licans are making it illegal to give food 
and water to people standing in line to 
vote. It shouldn’t be a test of physical 
stamina to be able to vote. Nobody 
should have to wonder if they will be 
able to vote if they step out of line to 
go to a bathroom. Nobody should have 
to sacrifice an entire day to participate 
in this incredible, incredible demo-
cratic system that is America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S77 
January 6, 2022 
That is why I proposed the People 
Over Long Lines Act, called the POLL 
Act. The bill says State governments 
have to guarantee that everybody who 
votes in person can do so within 30 
minutes. Anybody who is forced to 
wait longer has a legal action they can 
bring. If they sue and win, it is 50 
bucks for waiting longer than 30 min-
utes and 50 bucks more for every hour 
after that. 
A free bit of advice to States: Get 
ready. Make sure people don’t have to 
wait in lines. One of the best ways to 
make sure they don’t have to wait in 
lines is to let them vote at home. 
It is not just Oregon, by the way, 
that votes by mail. And I think, Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR, we heard some of our 
colleagues talk about their States and 
voting by mail. If you need another ex-
ample, let’s think about the U.S. 
Armed Forces. Most servicemembers 
and their families vote by mail in 
every election. All of the people who 
wear the uniform of the United States 
can vote by mail in every Federal elec-
tion. It has been that way for decades. 
So the bottom line is that we think 
it is time to get the Oregon system 
into every nook and cranny in Amer-
ica. We feel that way because it works. 
It raises voter participation, it lowers 
the cost of running elections, it helps 
voters be more informed, and it is safe 
and secure. And if you are resisting 
safe and efficient elections with higher 
voter turnout, then you are sup-
pressing democracy in America. 
My home State of Oregon shows the 
way to preserve America. 
I am going to close my remarks, but 
I think we will have Senator KLO-
BUCHAR speak for all of us here in a mo-
ment. But, in my closing, I want to 
touch just for a moment on my family 
that I am so proud of. 
My German family fled their home-
land, a place where they were deeply 
rooted in that nation’s society, as my 
grandfather was a Member of Par-
liament and served on the Berlin city 
council. 
My family was forced, as Jews, to 
flee the fascists who had taken over 
their democracy. They fled to America 
as the last remaining beacon of free-
dom. With that freedom, my dad chose 
to serve in our Army, which fought 
against German fascism, and my dad 
has been recognized for his unique con-
tributions. 
We were so thrilled, for example, to 
have the Senators from Maryland talk 
about the Ritchie Boys. My dad was 
one of the Ritchie Boys, a German kid 
who taught himself English so he could 
be out there fighting the Nazis. And I 
remember the good work of the Sen-
ators from Maryland and how thrilled 
our family was about that. 
My dad was about the greatest pa-
triot around. He felt he was so lucky to 
be an American, to be in our Army, to 
stand up for American values. And my 
final remark here today is about my 
dad. If my dad were alive today, he 
would tell us: Senators, make sure that 
the light in America’s beacon of free-
dom never goes out. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator from Oregon. We 
have had a day of tributes to those who 
work in the Capitol, those who pro-
tected us. We have had a day of reflec-
tion, and we have had a day of hope as 
we look to the future for our democ-
racy that we hold with such care. 
I want to thank the staff that was 
there that day. And for those of you— 
I am looking at the pages—who are 
new in the Senate, over the next few 
weeks, it is worth talking to one of the 
staff members who was here that day 
to hear their stories, to let them re-
flect on what happened to them, 
whether they were people who were as-
signed to the hallways or the trams or 
the cafeteria. What happened to them 
that day? The Sergeant at Arms, so 
many employees there who were here 
that day because this was the day of 
the peaceful transition of power in this 
Chamber and in the House. The Parlia-
mentarian’s office, those that work 
there—that was one of the most dif-
ficult moments, to walk into their of-
fice late in the morning, 4 in the morn-
ing. Senator BLUNT and myself, when 
this was all done, after we had done our 
work with Vice President Pence and 
the House, we walked around down-
stairs. It was eerily quiet. There was 
no one there. And you walked into the 
rooms, and there was glass from peo-
ple’s personal photos in the Parliamen-
tarian’s office that cracked, things 
thrown on the floor, their personal be-
longings. 
And you wondered: Why did they go 
in that office? Was it just a fluke? No, 
they actually understood where that 
office was. We later found out they 
knew exactly that that office was in 
charge of these electoral ballots and in 
charge that day of the proceedings and 
had a special place in our democracy. 
And they actually knew where that of-
fice was and deliberately went into 
that office and invaded that office. 
Everyone from the Capitol physician 
to the floor staffs, both Democratic 
and Republican floor staffs, who were 
here that day, charged with making 
this day move like it had over and over 
and over again every 4 years when, no 
matter who wins, we go and we do our 
work that is demanded of us under the 
Constitution. 
I remember, 4 years before that, my 
candidate certainly didn’t win in 2016, 
but we went and we did our job. And I 
remember at the time, Vice President 
Biden was presiding over that pro-
ceeding because it was the end of his 
time as Vice President, just like Vice 
President Pence was involved this last 
time. And he did his job. 
I think about what the Senators have 
talked about today, and we have heard 
from so many of our colleagues—Sen-
ator WARNER
and VAN
HOLLEN
and 
KAINE
talking 
about 
the 
National 
Guards of Virginia and Maryland and 
their police that came in—not planned 
that this was going to happen this 
day—and came in and helped protect 
the Capitol and, along with National 
Guards throughout our country, in-
cluding from my own State of Min-
nesota, then stayed on for weeks and 
weeks and months and months until we 
could get the security in order in this 
place. 
The Capitol Police—and so many of 
my 
colleagues, 
including 
Senator 
BOOKER, have shared the stories of the 
Capitol Police that day. And I know we 
have used some famous examples of 
those officers, but I think it is really 
important to note that every officer 
did something that mattered that day, 
some act of heroic duty, by doing their 
jobs. 
We thank the work that has done by 
the staffs of our Rules Committee, who 
are here today—Senator BLUNT’s and 
my staff—as well as Homeland Secu-
rity, 
with 
Senators 
Peters 
and 
Portman, who immediately took on the 
task of holding very public hearings 
about what went wrong on the security 
side and then the decisions to hire new 
leaders for our Sergeant at Arms; with 
Senator SCHUMER’s work on that, as 
well as the police chief with Chief Man-
ger, who testified at length yesterday 
in a very bipartisan hearing, actually, 
in the Rules Committee about the 
changes that have been made, the 
changes when it comes to equipment, 
as we remember that 75 percent of the 
officers that day were in plainclothes 
and only 25 percent had riot gear—the 
horrifying image of the riot gear 
locked onto a bus that no one could ac-
cess while the Capitol was being in-
vaded; the lack of a plan, in the words 
of the police officer broadcast on the 
police radio: Does anyone have a plan? 
Does anyone have a plan? 
And, sadly, the answer was, literally, 
no. That has now changed, as the chief 
has told us, when events have happened 
in the last few months in the Capitol— 
plans in place, operational plans, drills 
that have been conducted in this Cap-
itol. 
The lack of resources, which had 
been demanded in the past, that Sen-
ator LEAHY in the Appropriations Com-
mittee and Senator SHELBY have come 
to the floor and have worked to get 
them the resources that they need. 
But the challenges that still remain, 
the vacancies on the police force, peo-
ple working double shifts and overtime 
and people not being able to take their 
vacation and be with their families be-
cause they are still working to protect 
our Capitol. And the police chief’s 
pledge to work to recruit 200 or so 
more officers in just the next year with 
retention benefits and all the work 
that is being done. 
The other piece of this that we heard 
a lot about today was accountability. 
We heard from Senator DURBIN
and 
members of the Judiciary Committee 
and Senator BOOKER about the need— 
and 
Senator 
MARKEY—for 
account-
ability. And this includes the select 
committee over in the House and the

investigation that they are conducting 
with not just Democrats but also two 
very strong Republicans who have been 
willing to basically put their careers 
on the line because they believe so 
much in this democracy that we must 
get to the bottom of what happened. 
The work going on in the Justice De-
partment, which has now been, as of 
yesterday, as the Attorney General of 
the United States described to us, the 
biggest investigation in the history of 
America, because I don’t think people 
had envisioned that we would have an 
attack like this, but we did. 
Two hundred forty-four years of de-
mocracy—244 years of democracy—that 
it is our charge to protect, and that is 
why you see this investigation. That is 
why you see over 700 people charged. 
This is why you see the Attorney Gen-
eral pledge to follow this to every level 
and to follow the facts to where they 
go. 
We must remember, in the end, as my 
colleague from Oregon Senator WYDEN 
has addressed, this is not just and was 
not just an attack on a building; it was 
an attack on our Republic. 
I was looking back at the Inaugura-
tion Day and that beautiful moment 
with that blue sky, and there were lit-
tle snowflakes coming down. I remem-
ber hearing the beautiful words of 
Amanda Gorman, in her gold coat, that 
day, with that amazing poem, the sing-
ing. I remember Garth Brooks singing 
‘‘Amazing Grace.’’ I looked up at the 
sky and thought that anything and ev-
erything is possible and our democracy 
has prevailed. 
I remember the words of Abraham 
Lincoln, actually, which I quoted in 
my brief speech that day, when he gave 
his first inaugural address in front of 
this Capitol. The dome was only par-
tially constructed—it was braced by 
ropes of steel back then—and he prom-
ised he would finish it. He was actually 
criticized for spending funds during the 
Civil War on the dome, as it was some-
how frivolous. To those critics, he re-
plied: ‘‘If people see the Capitol going 
on, it is a sign we intend the Union 
shall go on.’’ 
When we gathered that day on that 
inaugural stage, there was still spray 
paint on the columns. They actually 
couldn’t get it all out because the in-
surrectionists had first come to that 
platform because—just as they knew 
what was going on in the Parliamen-
tarian’s Office, they targeted that plat-
form because that is exactly where 
President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS
were going to receive their 
oaths of office. There were still traces 
of spray paint. The windows behind us 
weren’t the real windows; they were 
makeshift windows. But we all gath-
ered there. The President-elect, now 
President, would not have his inau-
guration in a bunker. Senator BLUNT 
and I strongly believed that this should 
be a public event. As we stood out 
there, ‘‘The Capitol shall go on’’—that 
was the message we were sending to 
the country. 
So what does that mean right now, a 
year later, this anniversary, ‘‘The Cap-
itol shall go on’’? Yes, it means that we 
have better security, and we do better 
by our police officers, and we have 
their backs. It means that. We do bet-
ter by the staff in this great building. 
Yes, it means we have accountability 
for the people who had the audacity to 
invade this Capitol and take the law 
into their own hands and commit acts 
of violence. But the other thing it has 
to mean a year later is that we carry 
on that torch of our democracy, as the 
Senator from Oregon explained, that 
we make sure our very democracy is 
protected. 
(Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the 
Chair.) 
That means guaranteeing that people 
have the right to vote. 
What was not accomplished that day 
with the bear spray and the bayonets 
and the flagpoles sadly carried on be-
cause these bills that have been intro-
duced in so many States and passed 
across the country—over 400 of them 
passed in many, many States across 
the country or proposed, seriously pro-
posed, in others—bring us backwards. 
It basically says: You know what. De-
mocracy—the people who propose these 
bills—is not about who votes for whom, 
regardless of who wins; it is about us 
choosing our voters and deciding haves 
and have-nots and who is going to be 
able to vote and who isn’t going to be 
able to vote. 
When you think about what the peo-
ple of this country will do to preserve 
that right to vote—I think about those 
people in Wisconsin with homemade 
masks and garbage bags, standing in 
the pouring rain at the beginning of 
the pandemic just to exercise their 
right to vote. 
I think about the veteran I met when 
we did our field hearing with Senators 
WARNOCK
and OSSOFF
and Senators 
MERKLEY
and PADILLA
down in At-
lanta. This veteran told us that he had 
signed up to serve our country, and 
there wasn’t a waiting line, but when 
he went to exercise his right to vote, 
he had to wait hours and hours—4, 5 
hours—in line in the hot Sun just to 
exercise his right to vote. He told the 
stories of older people who had left be-
cause they couldn’t stand the heat, 
they couldn’t stand out there anymore. 
That is not what our democracy is 
supposed to look like. It is not sup-
posed to look like one ballot box in the 
entire county of Harris County, which 
includes Houston in Texas, over 5 mil-
lion people with one ballot drop-off 
box. That is not our democracy. 
But the American people in that 2020 
election said: You know what. No mat-
ter what you do to us, we are going to 
go vote. And they voted in droves. 
They voted more votes than in the his-
tory of America. Part of that was be-
cause, 
because 
of 
the 
pandemic, 
changes were made to the law, includ-
ing that some States took away ridicu-
lous requirements that you have to get 
a notary public. Think about it—in the 
middle of a pandemic. 
Right now, by the way, South Caro-
lina has put this law back into effect. 
To get your mail-in ballot because you 
can’t go vote in person because you 
have COVID, you have to have a notary 
public. There are stories reported in 
the news of people having notary 
publics, through the glass windows of 
hospitals, sign off on the application of 
ballots. All of that is designed, in the 
words of Reverend WARNOCK, so that 
some people don’t allow some people to 
vote. That is what that is about. 
So it is on us right now to carry on 
the democracy. And that feeling we 
had when the leaders of both parties all 
stood on that inaugural stage or when 
we took that last walk, Senator BLUNT 
and Vice President Pence and I and the 
two young women with the mahogany 
box with the last of the electoral bal-
lots—that feeling was a good one, and 
it was a celebration of joy for our coun-
try and the peaceful transition of 
power. 
As pointed out in our speeches on the 
Senate floor right after the insurrec-
tion—I remember Senator SHAHEEN 
standing right there talking about how 
the world is watching our democracy. 
Well, this is another moment. The 
world is watching as we see dictators 
coming into power in other countries 
around the world, as we see the former 
President still out there rallying the 
troops around this Big Lie that he 
somehow won the election when every 
single local election official in this 
country knows that is not true. This is 
our moment to stand up to that be-
cause the people are watching. Our 
kids are watching. And the democracy 
stands in the breach. This is our mo-
ment. We must pass the Freedom to 
Vote Act, and we must uphold our de-
mocracy. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S79 
January 6, 2022 
progress. The past decade has been 
plagued by continued ethnic violence, 
widespread hunger, and ongoing dis-
putes between rival politicians who 
have been motivated by their own per-
sonal ambitions rather than building a 
democratic country or improving the 
lives of the South Sudanese people. 
Two individuals, President Salva Kiir 
and First Vice President Riek Machar, 
are primarily to blame for fueling ten-
sions and mobilizing support along eth-
nic lines and for failing in their respon-
sibility to invest in public infrastruc-
ture, basic services, and the institu-
tions of a multi-party democracy. The 
country remains divided, violent, and 
impoverished. The Parliament is noth-
ing 
more 
than 
a 
hand-picked 
rubberstamp. 
In S. Res. 380, which passed unani-
mously on December 9, 2021, we re-
counted the failure of leadership that 
continues to plague South Sudan. We 
said: 
Whereas despite years of fighting, wide-
spread suffering of South Sudanese civilians, 
punitive actions by the international com-
munity, and 2 peace agreements, the leaders 
of South Sudan have failed to build sustain-
able peace, and critical provisions of the Re-
vitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the 
Conflict 
[R-ARCSS] 
. . . 
remain 
unimplemented; 
Whereas the leaders of South Sudan have 
consistently failed to uphold their respon-
sibilities to create the conditions for peace 
and prosperity, have prioritized self-preser-
vation and corruption over the needs of the 
people they represent, have acted in bad 
faith in the implementation of cease fire and 
peace agreements, and have betrayed the 
cause of freedom, resulting in the loss of mil-
lions of lives; and 
Whereas South Sudan has not held an elec-
tion since its independence and the current 
leaders of South Sudan were appointed or in-
stalled through transitional arrangements 
based on peace agreements. 
The people of South Sudan deserve 
better. Their children are hungry. They 
live in constant fear that the country 
will again erupt into civil war, and 
they will be forced to flee their homes 
yet again. It is a travesty that, despite 
billions of dollars in international aid, 
oil revenues, and black market loans, 
so little has been accomplished due to 
the whims and greed of two politicians. 
Where did all that money go, when the 
government does not pay teachers, or 
health workers, diplomats, or war vet-
erans, or build schools, health clinics, 
housing, or roads, or otherwise address 
the basic needs of the people of South 
Sudan? Where did the money go when 
the government does nothing to pro-
tect its citizens and their livestock 
from drowning from the yearly flood-
ing of the Nile River? Does anyone 
doubt that it ended up in secret bank 
accounts or to purchase properties far 
away from South Sudan? 
I have spoken before of the People’s 
Coalition for Civil Action—PCCA—a 
pro-democracy civil rights movement 
that seeks to mobilize the people of 
South Sudan in their pursuit of peace-
ful political change, which is their 
right. The PCCA and similar peaceful 
organizations represent a rejection of 
war, corruption, insecurity, and pov-
erty. They are calling for new, honest, 
and capable leadership that is com-
mitted to improving the lives of their 
people, to providing stability and secu-
rity, rather than self-enrichment. 
I note that S. Res. 380 calls on the 
Secretary of State to ‘‘lead a com-
prehensive interagency process to de-
velop a revitalized United States policy 
toward South Sudan that . . . identifies 
South Sudanese political and civilian 
stakeholders, beyond President Kiir 
and First Vice President Machar, with 
whom the United States may work for 
the promotion of peace, democracy, de-
velopment, 
accountability, 
trans-
parency, and anti-corruption efforts.’’ 
Supporting the PCCA would be a good 
place to start. 
How has President Kiir responded to 
this praiseworthy demand for nothing 
more than that he and Vice President 
Machar keep their promise to lead the 
country out of poverty? Several of the 
PCCA’s leaders have been arrested. 
Others live in exile, fearing that they 
too would be jailed if they return 
home. 
I think of Abraham Awolich, one of 
the lost boys. One of his brothers was 
killed fighting for the liberation of 
South Sudan, and Abraham nearly died 
himself for the same cause, but he was 
fortunate to be educated in a refugee 
camp in Kenya and resettled in my 
State of Vermont, where he graduated 
from the university. He is one of the 
dedicated leaders of the PCCA who 
have called for free and fair elections 
so the country can finally have new 
leadership and leave behind a genera-
tion of corruption, violence, and mis-
ery. Abraham left the comfort of living 
in America and chose to go back to 
South Sudan to help build a new demo-
cratic society, but he has had to flee 
his country, and his assets have been 
frozen for speaking out and standing up 
for democracy and civil rights. This is 
wrong. 
Others who are in jail for their peace-
ful advocacy are Kuel Aguer Kuel, Pas-
tor 
Abraham 
Chol 
Maketh, 
Malik 
Angok, 
and 
Fadhia 
Ngor. 
Rajab 
Mohandis, Wani Michael, Joseph Akol 
Makeer, and Jame David Kolok are on 
the run for the same reason, their as-
sets also frozen. Other advocacy orga-
nizations the government has targeted 
besides the PCCA include the Organiza-
tion for Responsive Governance, the 
Okay Africa Foundation, and the Foun-
dation for Democracy and Accountable 
Governance. 
These individuals and organizations 
deserve and need our support. 
I urge the South Sudanese authori-
ties to release Kuel Aguer Kuel and all 
the political prisoners mentioned so 
they can begin this new year with their 
families. The government should also 
unfreeze the assets of the individuals 
and organizations affected and issue a 
public statement revoking any further 
threats against them and their organi-
zations. 
The repressive actions of the South 
Sudanese Government should outrage 
each of us, especially considering the 
billions of dollars American taxpayers 
contributed to secure South Sudan’s 
independence and put the country on a 
path to a prosperous future. President 
Kiir and Vice President Machar have a 
duty to provide the political and civic 
space for their people to exercise their 
rights of free expression, association, 
and assembly and to petition for free 
and fair elections and for honest and 
competent governance. 
Ever since independence 10 years ago, 
the people of South Sudan have strug-
gled to survive under the suffocating 
oppression of the same two disgraced 
leaders. President Kiir and Vice Presi-
dent Machar have an opportunity to 
show real statesmanship, but time is 
running out. They should listen to the 
voices 
of 
their 
people 
expressed 
through the National Dialogue and 
step aside and give South Sudan a new 
beginning. The two could end the un-
rest in South Sudan with a public dec-
laration of their intention not to con-
test the next election. Rather than 
delay elections as they have done re-
peatedly before, President Kiir and 
Vice President Machar should set a 
date for national and Parliamentary 
elections, in accordance with the R- 
ARCSS, and declare their uncondi-
tional commitment to relinquish power 
as soon as South Sudan’s new leaders 
are sworn in. 
In acting on this advice, President 
Kiir and Vice President Machar would 
receive international support for an 
honorable exit from power. Ignoring 
this advice, however, would result in 
further 
condemnation 
and 
con-
sequences from the United States and 
the rest of the international commu-
nity. 
The text of S. Res. 380 bears repeat-
ing, because it identifies some, but by 
no means all, of the consequences that 
could result. It ‘‘urges the Secretary of 
the Treasury— 
(A) to prioritize investigations into illicit 
financial flows fueling violence in South 
Sudan; 
(B) to work with the Secretary of State to 
update, on a regular basis, the list of individ-
uals and entities designated under the South 
Sudan sanctions program, including individ-
uals at the highest levels of leadership in 
South Sudan and from within the National 
Security Service; and 
(C) to coordinate, in cooperation with the 
Secretary of State, with the United Kingdom 
and the European Union on South Sudan-re-
lated sanctions designations and enforce-
ment.’’ 
What has befallen the people of 
South Sudan in the 10 years since inde-
pendence is a travesty. Their dreams of 
a better future have been crushed. 
Their rights have been trampled. Many 
have paid with their lives or their free-
dom. Their government has become a 
subject of ridicule by the same inter-
national donors that staked so much 
on the good faith of leaders who have 
failed them. 
Time has run out for President Kiir 
and Vice President Machar. The pa-
tience of the South Sudanese people

has run out. The tolerance of the inter-
national community has run out. They 
have squandered and abused their au-
thority for far too long. They would be 
well-advised to stand aside so that oth-
ers, chosen in a free and fair election, 
can begin the process of uniting and re-
building the country. To that end, the 
United States can work with regional 
allies, Canada, Norway, the UK, other 
European nations, and church leaders 
to achieve a democratic and peaceful 
solution in South Sudan.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE LENOXBURG 
GENERAL STORE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week, I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, I am honored to recog-
nize the Lenoxburg General Store of 
Foster, KY, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week. 
When Scott and Angela Horn took 
over the Lenoxburg General Store 
nearly 2 years ago, they inherited more 
than four walls stacked with merchan-
dise. The illustrious history and cul-
ture of the store bring with it a tradi-
tion that the Horn’s were determined 
to uphold and enhance. Founded by 
Sam Lenoxburg in 1938 during the 
height of the Great Depression, the 
General Store brought local farmers 
and tradesmen together for excellent 
meals and butchering services. It rep-
resented a gathering place for a rapidly 
expanding community and was the cor-
nerstone of Bracken and Pendleton 
County. While large cities and towns 
had cinemas and famous diners to 
bring about this connection, it was 
Sam Lenoxburg’s store that generated 
the communal culture in the tight-knit 
Kentucky town for generations. 
Today, the Lenoxburg General Store 
continues to supply both general serv-
ice and deli processing to its local cli-
entele. The location remains a con-
gregation hub, drawing folks from all 
over and the bordering counties to dine 
and shop with a traditional flair. Since 
the Horns took ownership, the store 
has branched into catering and offers 
delivery for local events across the 
community it serves. The location also 
hosts events of its own, including fish- 
fry contests and holiday celebrations. 
But most importantly, during this 
time, Angela and Scott have continued 
in their tradition of hiring within their 
community, serving as a boon to their 
local 
economy. 
This 
family-owned 
business has supported a community- 
first atmosphere in the store which at-
tracts visitors and customers from sur-
rounding counties. 
Philanthropy and hospitality are cru-
cial tenants to Kentucky’s character, 
and the Horns exemplify these traits 
through their charitable work. Scott, 
the local game warden, has partnered 
with Kentucky Hunters for the Hungry 
to deliver more than 1,450 pounds of 
venison to more than 350 families in 
need. The Horns are also involved with 
national charities and use their busi-
ness to contribute to the Bracken and 
Pendleton tourism committees, along 
with 
the 
counties’ 
4–H 
programs. 
Lenoxburg General Store was heavily 
involved in the preparation and execu-
tion of the Heritage Days in Augusta, 
the longest running event in the area. 
Scott and Angela are committed to 
serving their friends and neighbors and 
get involved whenever they can to im-
prove the lives of those around them. 
The Horns’ dedicated approach to 
supporting the store’s family-like at-
mosphere goes beyond their praised 
home-cooked specials. As business own-
ers and operators, Scott and Angela go 
above and beyond for their community 
and demonstrate how small businesses 
serve as the backbone of towns across 
Kentucky. 
Congratulations to Scott, Angela, 
and the entire Lenoxburg General 
Store team. I wish them the best of 
luck, and I look forward to watching 
their continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.∑

FINAL DECISIONS 
HON. MARY GAY SCANLON 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD the House Communications 
Standards Commission Summary of Final De-
cisions: 
May 24, 2021. The House Communications

HONORING MR. STANLEY WEISS 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, two weeks after what would have been 
his 95th birthday, to honor Mr. Stanley A. 
Weiss—a business executive, prolific writer, 
and civic leader who passed away earlier this 
year in August. 
Self-described as a ‘‘skinny Jewish kid from 
South Philadelphia’’, he lived a life of adven-
ture and purpose. Mere weeks after turning 
17, he joined the Army and the next summer, 
he was training for the invasion of Japan when 
the atomic bombs ended World War II. He 
launched his first business, selling scrap metal 
and surplus Army supplies, shortly thereafter. 
While studying at Georgetown, he was in-
spired by the film The Treasure of Sierra 
Madre to move to Mexico in search of gold. 
Without knowing Spanish and with no previous 
mining experience, he took his pickaxe to the 
hills. Mr. Weiss didn’t find gold—but he found 
rich deposits of manganese, a crucial ingre-
dient used in the production of metal alloys. 
By 1960, Mr. Weiss had founded a mining 
and mineral processing company that, after a 
merger, became American Premier, Inc. The 
conglomerate became a major supplier and 
processor for chemicals used in everything 
from glazing tiles to Epsom salt, and at the 
height of the Cold War, was responsible for 
fostering trade opportunities between the U.S. 
and the USSR. 
In addition to his business acumen, Mr. 
Weiss always had an interest in giving back. 
During the 1977 to 1978 school year, he was 
a business fellow at Harvard’s Center of Inter-
national Affairs, and would later serve as a 
member of the Council on Foreign Relations, 
on the Board of Visitors for Georgetown’s 
Walsh School of Foregn Service, as well as 
the on advisory board of the RAND Center for 
Middle East Public Policy. 
However, his greatest contribution to the 
public arena was as the founding chairman of 
Business Executives for National Security 
(BENS). When asked why he and other lead-
ers in the private sector were getting involved 
in national security issues, he delivered his 
signature phrase: ‘‘being dead is bad for busi-
ness.’’ Focused on nuclear non-proliferation, 
arms control, and the defense procurement 
process, BENS was instrumental in reforming 
the Pentagon and cutting unnecessary waste 
and pork from the budget. 
His advocacy, in addition to his leadership 
in supporting innovation in government, led to 
him being honored with the Distinguished Ci-
vilian Service Award by the U.S. Department 
of Defense in 2007. 
Right up until his death, Mr. Weiss was writ-
ing. His last piece, published on Election Day 
last year, talks about his experience as a 13- 
year old seeing the 1940 election up close. He 
recounts how President Roosevelt’s opponent, 
Wendell Willkie, initially stood opposed to 
American intervention in Europe as the Third 
Reich invaded its neighbors. And then, in a 
speech to 300,000 supporters a month after 
France fell to the Nazis, Willkie ‘‘did one of the 
most extraordinary things a politician had ever 
done: he decided that Roosevelt was right.’’ 
He chose the correct path even if it was the 
unpopular one with the party that nominated 
him. 
Although he lost in a historic landslide, Will-
kie’s actions after the election stand as an 
even greater testament to his bipartisanship. 
He appealed to his fellow Republicans to not 
oppose the President for the sake of opposi-
tion and even flew to England as an envoy to 
reassure Prime Minister Churchill that the U.S. 
would be there for its ally when it was needed 
most. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that Mr. 
Weiss’ commitment to forging a more perfect 
union rivals the one that he writes about. His 
loss is a great loss for his friends, his family, 
and the country that he loved. For his accom-
plishments as a businessman and his advo-
cacy for public service, It is my honor to sub-
mit these words in the People’s House so that 
his legacy may be remembered for years to 
come. 
CELEBRATING 
THE 
TRICENTEN-
NIAL 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
TOWN 
OF 
NOTTINGHAM, 
NEW 
HAMPSHIRE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the tricentennial anniversary of 
the incorporation of the Town of Nottingham, 
New Hampshire. Incorporated by Lieutenant 
Governor John Wentworth and named for 
Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, this 
town’s long and rich history has culminated in 
the vibrant and caring community that we see 
today. 
From the beloved Pawtuckaway State Park 
to intimate local museums, the town of Not-
tingham has perfectly captured the beauty of 
its present and past. Nottingham’s dedicated 
conservation efforts have preserved the sur-
rounding wilderness in pristine condition. As 
the first town in the United States to make re-
cycling mandatory, Nottingham has led the 
way in protecting our natural resources. The 
communities that have grown and persevered 
over the past three hundred years in Notting-
ham are remembered in the town’s museums 
and in the families that pass on their stories. 
If the past three centuries are any indication of 
the future, the town of Nottingham will remain 
a harbor for its loving community and beautiful 
nature for many years to come. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate the Town of Nottingham on this 
incredible milestone. I look forward to a contin-
ued partnership with Nottingham and its resi-
dents who I am proud to represent in Con-
gress.

GENERAL 
RESI-
DENCY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia National 
Guard Commanding General Residency Act, 
which would require the Commanding General 
of the D.C. National Guard to reside in D.C. 
Last year, I introduced a substantially similar 
version of this bill, but I am introducing this 
version for committee jurisdiction reasons. 
This bill is even more important now because 
my provision in the House’s National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (NDAA) 
that would have given the D.C. mayor control 
over the D.C. National Guard was removed 
from the enacted NDAA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E6 
January 6, 2022 
The D.C. National Guard is a federal entity, 
and the Commanding General of the D.C. Na-
tional Guard is a federal official. The Com-
manding General of the D.C. National Guard 
is not required to reside in D.C. Congress has 
justifiably required that certain Federal officials 
reside in the jurisdiction they serve to ensure 
in-depth knowledge of the unique issues and 
challenges residents and Federal officials 
face. The President controls the D.C. National 
Guard, including the appointment of the Com-
manding General. In the states and territories, 
the governors control their National Guards, 
the top official in the National Guard is usually 
appointed by the governor and the top official 
can be required to live in the jurisdiction. All of 
these are compelling reasons why the Com-
manding General of the D.C. National Guard 
should be required to be a D.C. resident. 
This bill follows in the footsteps of several 
other bills that I have introduced that would re-
quire certain federal officials serving D.C. ex-
clusively to reside in D.C. My District of Co-
lumbia Federal Officials Residency Equality 
Act (H.R. 3786) would require the Federal dis-
trict court judges, Federal circuit court judges, 
the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Marshals for 
D.C. to reside in D.C. I have also introduced 
a bill (H.R. 4393) that would require the Direc-
tor of the Court Services and Offender Super-
vision Agency for the District of Columbia and 
the Director of the District of Columbia Pretrial 
Services Agency to reside in D.C. 
With the most recent permanent D.C. Na-
tional Guard Commanding General, Major 
General William J. Walker, now serving as the 
House Sergeant at Arms, leaving a vacancy in 
the position of Commanding General of the 
D.C. National Guard, this bill is more timely 
than ever. Moreover, the attack on the U.S. 
Capitol on January 6, 2021, and the events at 
Lafayette Square on June 1, 2020, are prime 
examples of why this bill is so important. Resi-
dents of the District would feel more confident 
in the D.C. National Guard if the Commanding 
General were required to be a D.C. resident. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY 
OF MS. ELSIE HARTMANN 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate and honor the 100th 
birthday of Ms. Elsie Hartmann. 
Ms. Hartmann was born in Dansville, New 
York, on January 9, 1922, to Ray and Ruth 
Finch. As a child, she was adventurous, loved 
the outdoors, and was a proud member of the 
Girl Scouts. Ms. Hartmann graduated from 
Dansville High School in 1939 and served as 
Senior Class Treasurer alongside her future 
husband Austin ‘‘Mush’’ Hartmann, who was 
Senior Class President. 
After high school, Ms. Hartmann attended 
Cortland Normal School for one year as a 
Physical Education major, and then enrolled at 
the Rochester Business Institute and grad-
uated with a certificate in Secretarial Science. 
After graduating, Ms. Hartmann accepted a 
job as a clerk in the Methods and Tool Design 
department at Gleason Works, a machine 
shop in Rochester, New York. 
In 1943, Ms. Hartmann left Gleason Works 
and enlisted with the U.S. Marine Corps and 
was part of the second group of women to en-
list with the U.S. Marine Corps. Ms. Hartmann 
joined the Marine Corps to become a me-
chanic, but because of Ms. Hartmann’s secre-
tarial background, she was sent to Arlington, 
Virginia, to work at the headquarters of the 
U.S. Marine Corps. At the end of WWII, Ms. 
Hartmann was discharged with the rank of 
Sergeant, and in 1946 she married her high 
school sweetheart, Mush Hartmann. 
Ms. Hartmann enjoys the simple things of 
life, bird watching and flower gardening, and is 
happiest when her house is filled with family. 
As the proud matriarch of her large family, 
which is comprised of 6 children, 13 grand-
children, and 8 great-grandchildren, she at-
tends as many of their events as possible, in-
cluding high school and military graduations, 
school performances and sporting events. Ms. 
Hartmann still lives at the Hartmann Home-
stead, which has been in her family for over 
170 years. 
Ms. Hartmann is very talented both artis-
tically and musically. She still sings in her 
church choir and plays the hand bells. At var-
ious times in her life, Ms. Hartmann played the 
violin, piano, flute, tap-danced, was involved in 
various singing groups, and participated in 
community theatre. Ms. Hartmann’s callig-
raphy work can be seen throughout Dansville 
and West Sparta, including on the wall of the 
Clara Barton Chapter 1 Museum, and at the 
Dansville Presbyterian Church in their Memo-
rial Book and on the inside front cover of 
every hymnal that is used today. In 2012, a 
flag-size banner that Ms. Hartmann hand-let-
tered, was taken up to the top of Mt. Kiliman-
jaro by a Dansville native. 
Ms. Hartmann has always remained in-
volved with her local community. Ms. Hart-
mann is the oldest and longest serving mem-
ber and choir member of the Dansville Pres-
byterian Church, and is a long-time member of 
the West Sparta Historical Society. In 2004, 
Ms. Hartmann and her husband Mush were 
chosen as Livingston County Senior Citizens 
of the Year. In 2014, Ms. Hartmann had the 
honor of participating in Rochester Honor 
Flight mission No. 35 and that same year, was 
chosen as the honorary Grand Marshal of 
West Sparta’s Old-Fashioned Day celebration. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Ms. Elsie Hartmann for her service to our 
country and in celebrating her 100th birthday.

PASSING 
THROUGH 
THE 
FIERY 
TRIALS 
OF 
DEMOCRACY 
TO 
SAVE AND RENEW OUR REPUB-
LIC 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary and on Homeland Security, as the de-
scendant of patriotic and heroic veterans who 
risked their lives to defend our nation and our 
freedoms, as a parent with the fervent hope 
and determination to pass on this great de-
mocracy to the next generation, and as a cit-
izen of the greatest republic in world history, 
I rise to reflect on the state of our democracy 
as it is about to open a new chapter in the re-
markable story of America. 
In 1776 the Framers declared the self-evi-
dent and later the universal truth that all per-
sons are created equal and endowed by their 
Creator with the inalienable rights of life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. As impor-
tant, the Framers declared that ‘‘to secure 
these 
rights, 
governments 
are 
instituted 
among men, deriving their just power from the 
consent of the governed.’’ This genius of self- 
government is the Framers’ gift to us and 
America’s gift to the world, and for nearly 250 
years the world has looked upon the United 
States with wonder, awe, and envy not just for 
its awesome powers and achievements, but 
for being the exemplar to which most freedom- 
loving nations aspire. 
But as President Lincoln reminded us at 
Gettysburg, the proposition that a people can 
govern themselves is not to be taken for 
granted; it is a proposition that will be tested 
time and again and it is for us, the living, to 
highly resolve to commit ourselves to the great 
task always before us, that government of the 
people, by the people, and for the people not 
perish from the Earth. 
As Thomas Paine said in his time, the past 
four years were times that tried one’s soul. 
The nation was tested, severely so, by what 
can only be described as the modern-day 
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: a deadly 
pandemic, economic devastation unseen since 
the Great Depression, social justice unrest, 
and the very real threat of authoritarianism. 
While the threat posed by these challenges 
are still with us to varying extent, we can all 
rejoice that the nation withstood the challenge, 
e pluribus unum, by standing together as ‘‘We 
The People.’’ President Lincoln reminded us 
that in times of testing and challenge that ‘‘the 
fiery trial through which we pass will mark us

down in honor or dishonor until the latest gen-
eration’’ but that so long as the people ‘‘retain 
their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by 
any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very 
seriously injure the government in the short 
space of four years.’’ 
And Lincoln was right, for on Election Day 
2020, Americans by a substantial majority, 
voted to withhold consent to govern from an 
incumbent administration and confer it upon 
another. That act of self-government and sov-
ereign expression was solemnized on January 
20, 2021, at noon when Joseph R. Biden and 
KAMALA D. HARRIS took the oath of office as 
the 46th President and 59th Vice-President of 
the United States. 
The Philadelphia Miracle of 1789 endures 
but only because we Americans resolve that it 
does and work to make it so. The President 
takes the oath of office pledging to preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution. As does 
every one of my congressional colleagues, I 
have sacredly pledged true faith and alle-
giance in defending the Constitution against all 
enemies, foreign and domestic and to well and 
faithfully execute the duties of the office I hold. 
I do this ever mindful that the purpose of our 
form of government is ‘‘to form a more perfect 
union, to establish justice, to insure domestic 
tranquility, to provide for the common defense, 
to promote the general welfare, and to secure 
the blessings of liberty for posterity.’’ 
But we all have a responsibility to preserve 
and strengthen this constitutional republic and 
pass it on to the next generation by engaging 
in robust, lawful, and peaceful civic activity to 
hold our government to account and to peace-
ably assemble when necessary to petition for 
a redress of grievances as shown by the Rev. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on 
Washington, following the example of Ma-
hatma Gandhi; by John Lewis and the Civil 
Rights foot soldiers at the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge in Selma, Alabama; by Elizabeth Cady 
Staton and Lucretia Mott at Seneca Falls; by 
Cesar Chavez leading the fight for human dig-
nity of farmworkers, and by Black Lives Matter 
demonstrators protesting inequalities in the 
criminal justice system. For the work of de-
mocracy is never complete, our union is al-
ways in the process of being made more per-
fect. 
Americans have suffered, endured, and sur-
vived much pain and heartbreak over the past 
five years. But Psalms 30:5 teaches that 
‘‘weeping lasteth for a night, but joy cometh in 
the morning’’ and our collective journey to-
wards the beloved community continues inex-
orably forward.

RECOGNIZING SENATOR DOUGLAS 
J. ERICKSEN 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, my heart is heavy as I rise today to 
honor the life of my dear friend, Senator 
Douglas Ericksen, who passed away on De-
cember 17, 2021 after a battle with COVID– 
19. My prayers are with Doug’s family as we 
mourn his passing. 
Doug dedicated his life to working on behalf 
of the people of Whatcom County, serving in 
both the Washington State House of Rep-
resentatives and Senate for more than two 
decades. Throughout his tenure, Doug was a 
champion for the rights of every individual, 
and he was a fierce defender of the Constitu-
tion. 
In Eastern Washington, Doug will always be 
remembered for being a strong advocate of 
the Snake River dams—which isn’t common 
for someone from the West side of Wash-
ington. His pragmatic approach towards find-
ing balanced solutions to our State’s biggest 
environmental problems made him a special 
partner of mine for many years, and I will miss 
his leadership—along with his quick-witted 
humor—dearly. 
Above all else, Doug was a remarkable hus-
band to his wife Tasha, father to his daughters 
Elsa and Addi, friend, and neighbor. His loss 
will be felt deeply across the entire state of 
Washington for many years to come, but I 
thank God for giving me the blessing of calling 
Doug my friend. 
Madam Speaker, Doug Ericksen lived an 
amazing life that deserves to be celebrated. In 
honor of his legacy, passion, and contributions 
that inspired so many, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing Washington State Sen-
ator Doug Ericksen. May God grant him eter-
nal peace in His kingdom.

MR. JAMES NEAL MCCOY OF 
DALLAS 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mr. James Neal McCoy of Dallas, 
Texas. A quick glance at James McCoy’s life 
is enough for anyone to tell that he was a man 
of extraordinary character. Throughout his en-
tire life, he has been a beacon of academic 
and professional excellence and has had a 
profound impact on those around him. 
As a true entrepreneur, Mr. McCoy, after 
graduating Pennsylvania State University with 
a Master of Science, purchased a company 
dedicated to supplying instruments, tech-
nology, and training for optimizing the perform-
ance of oil, water, and gas wells. This com-
pany, Echometer, blossomed under his leader-
ship and Mr. McCoy built an impressive record 
as a sound, reasonable and conscious busi-
ness owner lending his innovations to the pub-
lic for the benefit of all. Following his success, 
he established the James N. McCoy Founda-
tion. Which, since its inception, has provided 
support and financial assistance to a wide va-
riety of educational, healthcare, and crime pre-
vention organizations. 
James’ life was changed forever as he mar-
ried the love of his life, Vicki. Together the two 
began a family with their son, Mark, and 
daughter, Melinda. The tremendous impact 
that James and his family have had on their 
community cannot be understated and will not 
be forgotten. The fulfilling life that James led, 
and his legacy, will be remembered for gen-
erations by his grandchildren. James McCoy 
will live on as an inspiration for those that 
strive for excellence. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
James McCoy’s devotion to his community. 
Furthermore, Madam Speaker, I extend my 
personal commendations to James McCoy 
and his family for all they have done in service 
of the 4th Congressional District of Texas. 
May God rest the soul of this great American.

IN MEMORY OF DORIS TOPSY- 
ELVORD 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Doris Topsy-Elvord, an icon in the 
Long Beach community for more than a half 
century and the first African-American woman 
elected to the Long Beach City Council, who 
passed away on Wednesday, December 15. 
I was fortunate to not only work with her 
over her many years of public service, but to 
also count her as a dear personal friend who 
provided me with advice and support through-
out the decades we knew each other. 
As Doris told the Long Beach Historical So-
ciety in a 2015 retrospective on her life, she 
was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, on June 
17, 1931. She and her family moved to Long 
Beach in 1942, where she attended and grad-
uated from St. Anthony Elementary and High 
Schools. In 1956, Doris worked as a California 
Youth Authority counselor, followed by posi-
tions in the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s De-
partment and the City of Long Beach Depart-
ment of Parks, Recreation and Marine. For 
nineteen years she worked for the Los Ange-
les County Probation Department as a Deputy 
Probation Officer II. On June 22, 1988, after 
35 years of public service with the California 
Youth Authority, and the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff’s and Probation Departments, she 
proudly retired. Along the way she earned a 
Bachelor of Arts Degree from California State 
University, Long Beach and a Master of Arts 
in Criminal Justice Administration from Chap-
man College. 
In 1988, Doris became a member of the 
City of Long Beach Civil Service Commission 
and served one term as president. From No-
vember 1987 through November 1989 Doris 
served as Commissioner of the first Justice 
and Peace Commission of the Archdiocese of 
Los Angeles. 
In 1992, she became the first African-Amer-
ican female to be elected to the Long Beach 
City Council. In 1996, she was re-elected and 
holds the singular distinction of being selected 
as Vice Mayor of the City of Long Beach twice 
unanimously. During this time, she success-
fully organized the Jim Wilson Memorial BBQ 
Cook-Off Gospel and Blues Festival, the Herb 
Smith Annual Slowpitch Tournament, and the 
Annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Birthday Unity 
Parade and Celebration. 
Over her lengthy career, Doris received 
many deserving honors and accolades from 
numerous organizations and individuals, in-
cluding being inducted into the St. Anthony 
High School Hall of Fame in 1991. In 1993, 
she was named Woman of the Year by the 
Long Beach Junior Chamber of Commerce 
and the following year she was honored by 
the California State Senate as Woman of the 
Year. 
In 2003, she was nominated to join the Port 
of Long Beach Harbor Commission by then-

Mayor Beverly O’Neill. Doris became the first 
African American and only the third woman to 
serve on the five-member port commission in 
its nearly 80-year history. During her tenure at 
the port, which included a year as board presi-
dent in 2005, she was instrumental in the ex-
pansion of the port’s Small Business Enter-
prise Program. Doris also helped to develop 
the port’s Green Port Policy, which helped to 
reduce the negative environmental impacts of 
port operations. Doris later called her five 
years on the commission, ‘‘some of the most 
challenging and rewarding of my career.’’ 
Doris remained a tremendous force in the 
community throughout her life. She was a 
member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., 
Eta Phi Beta Business and Professional Soror-
ity, National Association of Civil Service Com-
missioners, National Council of Negro Women, 
and California Probation, Parole and Correc-
tions Association. She also served on the 
Board of Trustees of St. Mary Medical Center, 
the Executive Board of the Children’s Dental 
Foundation at Memorial Medical Center, and 
the Community Advisory Board of the Los An-
geles County Museum of Natural History. 
She co-founded the African American Herit-
age Society with Indira Hale Tucker and oth-
ers to raise money for educational materials 
on African Americans. In 2010, the Micro-En-
terprise Charter Academy was renamed the 
Doris Topsy-Elvord Academy (A Micro-Enter-
prise School) in her honor. 
In addition, she was featured in the 1997 
book ‘‘No Mountain High Enough: Secrets of 
Successful African American Women’’ by 
Dorothy Ehrhart Morrison. Doris was one of 
the Long Beach, California, pioneering dozen, 
chronicled in a 2015 collection of historical 
profiles, BREAKING THROUGH Lighting the 
Way, edited by Sunny Nash with foreword by 
Carolyn Smith Watts. ‘‘This project introduced 
our community to local women with a mission 
similar to that of Rosa Parks,’’ said Nash. 
‘‘Mother Doris,’’ as she was so often re-
ferred to by the community, paved the way for 
Long Beach’s diverse city council. She was 
the city’s first black woman councilmember, 
Vice Mayor, and remains an inspiring parental 
figure to many. 
Doris Topsy-Elvord’s inspiring life included 
travels and explorations to every continent ex-
cept Antarctica. She had a rich family life with 
husband, Ralph, three sons, grandchildren, 
and great grandchildren.

CONGRATULATING LIEUTENANT 
PATRICK SIANO 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Shelby County Sheriff’s Office 
Lieutenant Patrick Siano on his retirement 
after 34 years of service to our community. 
Lieutenant Siano’s uncle Ralph used to tell 
him that if you really love what you do, you’ll 
never work a day in your life. Lieutenant Siano 
loved his work and said he’s never had to 
work a day in his life. He also said that the de-
cision to retire was a tough one since he’d 
gone into law enforcement to help people. 
His desire to help people was the subject of 
a ‘‘Strolling with Eldon Roark’’ column in the 
Memphis Press-Scimitar in the 1970s, when 
the lieutenant was still a teenager and was 
singled out for helping a couple repair a blown 
radiator hose. 
December 30 was his last day with the 
Shelby County Sheriff’s Office in the Civil Divi-
sion. Over his more than 30-year career, Lieu-
tenant Siano was assigned to Courts, Metro 
DUI, Detectives (including homicide, child pro-
tective services and domestic violence), Re-
serve, Emergency Services, Uniform Patrol 
and Fugitive Divisions. He often interacted 
with new recruits as a field training officer and 
DUI instructor. 
Lieutenant Siano is the middle child of 
seven children of Jerry and Edna Aikens 
Siano. His late father was a native of Chicago 
who came to Memphis as an entrepreneur 
and founded Jerry Siano Foods. A native of 
Memphis, Lieutenant Siano attended St. Mi-
chael School, Christian Brothers High School 
and the then-Memphis State University before 
a driving work ethic led to his father’s Honda 
of Millington dealership, where he sold motor-
cycles. But he always wanted to be a sheriff’s 
deputy and began as a reserve officer in 
1984, working 100 hours a month for almost 
four years before attending the academy and 
becoming a deputy in 1988. 
Always known for his respect for the law 
and for his kindness, his service to Memphis 
and Shelby County will be valued and deeply 
missed. I am pleased that he can now spend 
a pleasant retirement with his wife of 12 years, 
Susan, his two children and six grandchildren, 
his fellow deputies, and his many friends. He 
truly made Memphis a better and safer place 
to live.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH 
‘‘JOE’’ EGGLESTON GARDNER, JR. 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of my friend, Joseph 
‘‘Joe’’ Eggleston Gardner, Jr., who passed 
away on Thursday, December 16, 2021, at the 
age of 72, in San Antonio, Texas. 
Joe was born in Washington, D.C., on 
March 26, 1949. However, he was raised in 
Corpus Christi, Texas. He graduated from 
Sewanee Military Academy and earned de-
grees at both the University of Texas and 
Texas A&M University. 
Joe contributed generously to civic organi-
zations by serving on the Texas Water Devel-
opment Board, the Nueces River Authority, 
and the Del Mar College Board of Directors. 
He also co-founded the Animal Rescue Foun-
dation in Seguin, Texas. Joe was a member of 
the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd 
in Corpus Christi and I was a board member 
of Saint Joseph’s Anglican Church in New 
Braunfels. 
Joe and I first met 40 years ago when we 
served on the Texas State Board of Dental 
Examiners together. Joe was the first public 
member ever appointed, and I was the young-
est dentist ever selected for the board. We 
were the new guys, but I knew dentistry, and 
Joe knew ‘‘Robert’s Rules of Order,’’ a guide 
of parliamentary procedure, and it was not 
long before we made our mark. 
We had much in common, and our friend-
ship endured long after our Dental Board ten-
ures. He was a student of history and an as-
tute political mind. Since his teenage years, 
Joe was an active member of the Republican 
Party. He was on the staff of Senator John 
Tower, the first Republican Senator elected 
from Texas since the Civil War. Joe also 
served on the Congressional Republican Cau-
cus, and he was, at one time, a candidate for 
U.S. Congress. He did not win, but he never 
gave up, and he never gave in on his strong 
conservative beliefs. 
Joe is preceded in death by his mother, 
Neely Laura Procter Gardner of Houston, 
Texas, and his father, Joseph Eggleston Gard-
ner, M.D., of Greenwood, Mississippi. He is 
survived by his daughter, Rebecca Sarah 
Gardner of Savannah, Georgia; his son, Jo-
seph Eggleston Peyton Gardner of Austin, 
Texas; and his brother, William Frank Gardner 
of Houston, Texas. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to honor 
my friend Joe Gardner today on the House 
floor. He was one-of-a-kind, always faithful, 
funny, and someone you could count on in 
good times and bad. I will be forever grateful 
for his friendship and will miss him dearly. My 
heartfelt prayers remain with his family and 
friends during this difficult time.

The Act provides the states and certain ter-
ritories with formula funding to support state- 
designated institutions’ cooperative forestry re-
search programs. The funding available under 
this Act assists the states and territories in 
carrying out forestry research programs at 
state forestry schools and colleges and devel-
oping a trained pool of forest scientists capa-
ble of conducting needed forestry research. 
District of Columbia residents pay full fed-
eral taxes, and with few exceptions, the Dis-
trict is treated as a state under federal pro-
grams. This Act defines ‘‘State’’ to include 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam, 
whose residents do not pay full federal taxes. 
The District’s absence from the Act makes it 
ineligible for federal funding that would support 
research at the District’s public university, the 
University of the District of Columbia (UDC). 
The College of Agriculture, Urban Sustain-
ability and Environmental Sciences at UDC, 
the nation’s only urban land-grant university, 
offers programs that complement D.C.’s ongo-
ing forestry efforts and serve individuals in my 
district and beyond. Rectifying the District’s 
exclusion from this Act would ensure its equi-
table treatment and provide UDC a fair share 
of resources. 
The District should be eligible under this Act 
just like the states and territories. This bill 
would allow students and researchers in the 
nation’s capital to benefit from this important 
forestry program. I urge support for this bill.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF MR. JOHN SCHOUTEN 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. John Schouten for his con-
tributions to the dairy industry and congratu-
late him on his retirement. 
John Schouten’s passion for the dairy indus-
try started over 35 years ago and led him to 
World Wide Sires, which started out in Han-
ford, California. He completed German lan-
guage school shortly after starting and quickly 
built relationships in the international dairy 
scene that would last decades. His enthu-
siasm and desire to put farmers first has cre-
ated numerous opportunities for U.S. genetics 
worldwide. 
While at World Wide Sires, Mr. Schouten 
became known for his remarkable work ethic 
and empathy for others. He started as an Area 
Director of Marketing and went on to become 
VP of Marketing from 1993 to 2001, eventually 
becoming CEO in 2001. Mr. Schouten’s lead-
ership allowed his team to grow as they trav-
eled to over 70 countries, sharing their knowl-
edge and helping farmers. 
Mr. Schouten became CEO at a time of 
rapid growth and change in the industry. 
Thanks to his vision, his team launched Global 
Dairy Solutions along with setting up six global 
subsidiaries. Mr. Schouten has set a great ex-
ample of what hard work and compassion can 
accomplish. His energy to keep innovating has 
led him to become one of the most recognized 
and respected members of the U.S. Al com-
munity. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing Mr. John 
Schouten for his contributions to the dairy in-
dustry and wishing him the best in retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBIN

HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-

Robin was a beloved wife and a Gold Star 
mother. 
She passed away on September 13, 2021, 
after an extended battle with bone marrow 
cancer at age 63. 
Robin was an active and compassionate 
member of her community. 
On August 1, 2003, Robin lost her son, 
Army Specialist Justin Hebert when his vehicle 
was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade in 
Kirkuk, Iraq. 
Robin fought her battle with cancer with the 
same honor and courage as Justin. 
Robin volunteered as a trial patient for an 
experimental bone marrow transplant. While 
she could not donate her organs, she proudly 
donated her information to researchers to 
save lives even after she passed. 
Robin will be remembered by friends and 
family for her resilience and tenacity. She will 
be missed greatly.

Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and commend the wonderful Mrs. 
Verna Elizabeth ‘‘Ritchie’’ Bertsche. Verna 
Elizabeth was born on December 28, 1921, in 
the era of the Great Depression, and during 
the presidency of Warren G. Harding. She 
grew up during the time of the roaring twenties 
and during prohibition. 
Ritchie excelled in her academic studies, 
graduating from the University of Cincinnati, 
where she was also chosen to serve as presi-
dent of her sorority, Zeta Tau Alpha. She mar-
ried a decorated officer, Carl I. Bertsche, who 
served in Europe during World War II, having 
known him since their kindergarten days. She 
enjoyed her time serving as a pre-school 
teacher, before her children came along, and 
then worked part-time in Carl’s business, 
PESCO, where she made a hugely valuable 
contribution in both an official and unofficial 
capacity. Well-known in her community as a 
dedicated volunteer, she has selflessly given 
20 years of service at the Good Samaritan 
Hospital. 
In addition to her service to her community, 
she has been a generous, loving, and sup-
portive mother to her two children, Patricia B. 
Deis-Gleeson (who shares Verna’s birthday), 
and Carl I. Bertsche Jr, both of whom are 
proud to call her Mom. Greater still are her 
five grandchildren and seven great-grand-
children, to whom she is always showing a 
genuine and proud interest in their lives and 
achievements. 
Verna’s wonderful memories of Jeeme 
Hipad, a club consisting of Doie and Bob 
Stacy, Betty and Nick Weisgarber, Helen and 
Bob Dhonau, Verna and Carl Bertsche, and 
Dottie and Phil Spiess. The club’s name de-
rives from the letters of their middle names 
and all the ladies in the club are also mem-
bers of Zeta Tau Alpha. The club began meet-
ing just for fun but ended up meeting right 
through the remainder of many of their lives. 
Jeeme Hipad activities encompassed World 
War II, the growth of their families, adapting to 
empty nest syndrome, right through to the 
passing of their spouses. A truly unique and 
special group. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
Verna Elizabeth ‘‘Ritchie’’ Bertsche’s devotion 
to all that is good and wholesome in this life. 
May God bless Verna on her 100th Birthday.

RECOGNIZING MR. SEAN MULLIN 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition and appreciation of Mr. 
Sean Mullin, upon his completion of the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion’s (NOAA) John A. Knauss Marine Policy 
Fellowship Program. Mr. Mullin served as a 
Knauss fellow in my Washington, D.C., office 
during the 2021 calendar year. 
As an integral member of my legislative 
staff, Mr. Mullin assisted my work on the 
House Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure, particularly my work on the Sub-
committee on Water Resources and Environ-
ment and the Subcommittee on Economic De-
velopment, Public Buildings, and Emergency 
Management pertaining to natural disasters. 
Over this past year, he worked closely with my 
personal office staff in developing several 
pieces of legislation. He revamped my ‘‘Wild-
life Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act’’ 
from previous Congresses into bipartisan leg-
islation (H.R. 6059) I reintroduced on Novem-
ber 19, 2021. He also developed the ‘‘End 
Palm Oil Deforestation Act’’ (H.R. 5863) from 
an outline into actual legislation and reworked 
the ‘‘Stop the Spread of Invasive Mussels Act 
of 2021’’ (H.R. 5692), of which I assumed 
sponsorship from former Congressman Ben 
McAdams (D–UT). 
Mr. 
Mullin 
received 
his 
doctorate 
in 
geobiology from the California Institute of 
Technology in 2020, and graduated from the 
University of California, Berkeley with a Bach-
elor of Science in microbial biology in 2011. 
While his fellowship with my office has ended, 
I am very pleased that Mr. Mullin’s public serv-
ice with California’s Congressional delegation 
will continue as he joins the office of U.S. 
Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D–CA). 
I have no doubt that Mr. Mullin’s innate curi-
osity and aptitude for navigating complex pol-
icy problems to develop actionable solutions 
will serve him well in this new role. Mr. Mullin 
will remain a deeply valued member of Team 
Garamendi, and we look forward to continuing 
to work with him.

IN MEMORY OF COURTNEY 
LYKINS, JR. 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a great American, Courtney Lykins, 
Jr. Mr. Lykins lived in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, 
and passed away on December 15, 2021. 
Mr. Lykins served our nation proudly in the 
United States Army Reserves from 1970 to 
1997. He served in the 100th Division, 2nd 
Battalion, 3rd Brigade as Sergeant First Class/ 
E7, Senior Drill Sergeant, and Senior Tank 
Commander. He trained soldiers heading to 
Vietnam in 1970 when he served at Fort Polk, 
Louisiana. Mr. Lykins was an active member 
of the American Legion, Post 22 in Mt. Ster-
ling. He was commissioned a Kentucky Colo-
nel by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in rec-
ognition of his service and accomplishments. 
Mr. Lykins worked at Hobart Manufacturing 
Company for ten years. He then worked for 
Kentucky Utilities, LGE in Mt. Sterling for 32 
years until his retirement. He is survived by 
his loving wife, Janet Wilson Lykins, two sons 
and daughters in law, Chuck and Nancy 
Lykins and Wesley and Allison Lykins, and six 
grandchildren. In addition, he leaves behind 
two brothers and two sisters. 
Courtney Lykins was a follower of Christ, a 
true patriot, and a loving family man. It is my 
honor to lift up the life of Courtney Lykins be-
fore the United States Congress.

RECOGNIZING MR. GREGORY 
RUSHIN ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and salute Mr. Gregory Rushin, a 
steadfast leader who has dedicated nearly 
forty years of distinguished public service at 
various levels of government. 
Mr. Rushin’s career began in 1979, where 
he served the town of Lewiston, lllinois, as a 
Deputy Sheriff. Prior to assuming this position, 
Greg completed his Bachelor’s Degree in Law 
Enforcement Administration at Western Illinois 
University and his Master of Science Degree 
in Human Relations and Business at Amber 
University. 
In an effort to further expand his knowledge, 
Mr. Rushin sought additional training and edu-
cational opportunities that allowed him to de-
velop skills essential to being an effective 
leader in law enforcement. In doing so, he 
graduated from the FBI Academy, the FBI Na-
tional Academy, the FBI Law Enforcement Ex-
ecutive Development Program, and Harvard’s 
Senior Management Institute for Police. Addi-
tionally, for three years he would reside in the 
Washington, D.C., area where he gained in-
valuable experience serving as a Special 
Agent with the FBI. 
In June of 1982, Greg began his nearly 34- 
year career with the Plano Police Department, 
the latter 18 years of which he assumed the 
position of Chief of Police. As a result of his 
leadership, Chief Rushin was selected to 
serve as Plano’s Deputy City Manager where 
he is responsible for overseeing the City’s 
Public 
Safety 
Departments 
encompassing 
services including Animal Services, Fire and 
Rescue, Police, and Emergency Management. 
Mr. Rushin’s commitment to our community 
has been evidenced by his membership and 
past leadership positions within several organi-
zations including as the President of the 
Texas Police Chief’s Association as well as on 
multiple boards of directors, including the 
International Association of Chiefs of Police, 
the Collin County Child Advocacy Board, the 
Plano Youth Leadership Board, the Medical 
City Plano Citizen Advisory Board, and the 
Brett Adkins Foundation Board. Due to his 
dedication and contributions to the Plano com-
munity, it is no surprise that Greg was recog-
nized as one of the 21 for the 21st Century by 
Inside Collin County Business. 
While Greg has created a tremendous leg-
acy of servant leadership, it is evident that re-
spect for his efforts run deep among all who 
have had the pleasure of working with him. 
Now, as Mr. Greg Rushin prepares to begin a 
new season of life, it is with a deep sense of 
gratitude I ask my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to join me in recognizing his 
exemplary contributions throughout his career 
in public service while wishing him and his 
family all the best in this next chapter.

RECOGNIZING JANUARY 6 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today on the anniversary of January 
6th to reflect on a horrific day for our institu-
tion and our democracy. 
One year ago today, violent terrorists at-
tacked our Capitol—the seat of our democ-
racy, and what I used to think was one of the 
safest places in the world. I don’t think that 
anymore. 
On that day, in the House gallery when the 
Capitol was breached, I sat alongside my col-
leagues in confusion and panic. I feared for 
my life. We heard the shot. We saw the tear 
gas coming in from under the door—but didn’t 
know what it was. I struggled to get my gas 
mask on, because I couldn’t hear the instruc-
tions over the chaos. I lost my glasses for a 
period of time. 
We were evacuated, running down the halls 
and stairs past a part of the mob that was 
being held down at gunpoint. We sheltered for 
hours in a room packed shoulder-to-shoulder 
with people. Then we went back to finish the 
job. Because that’s what we had been there to 
do in the first place—certify the results of a 
free and fair election. 
That day shows that we can’t take our de-
mocracy for granted. We still must fight to pro-
tect it every day, because there are still many 
people, including some of my Republican col-
leagues, who want to undermine it. 
I’m thankful to the Department of Justice, 
FBI, and law enforcement agencies across the 
country who are working to prosecute and 
bring to justice those who planned and partici-
pated in the violence. But there is still a long 
way to go—we won’t have true justice until 
those in positions of power who helped inspire 
and enable the mob are put on trial. To that 
end, I appreciate the work of my colleagues 
on the January 6 committee to bring to light all 
the details of that day, including the role of the 
Trump administration. I also want to again 
thank the journalists who were with us that 
day and who worked fearlessly through the at-
tack to make sure everyone saw what was 
really happening. 
Most importantly, I thank our Capitol Police 
Officers for selflessly protecting us that day. 
My thoughts are with the families and friends 
of the officers who lost their lives because of 
the attack. We will always remember and 
honor their sacrifice. 
Today, I no longer feel safe at work, and I 
still fear for our country because so many peo-
ple want to forget the events of that day, or 
flat out deny that they happened. We won’t 
forget, we won’t let the American people for-
get, and we won’t stop working every day to 
preserve our freedoms.

RECOGNIZING LESTER CASH ON 
HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 6, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate Lester 
Cash on his exemplary 37 years of service to 
the Federal Government, including 24 years at 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices. 
After growing up in North Carolina, Lester 
Cash began his federal career as a statistician 
planning for the 1990 Census, which was fol-
lowed by a decade as a senior examiner at 
the Office of Management and Budget. In 
1997, Mr. Cash moved to HHS and spent 
eight years overseeing budgets for some of 
the Federal Government’s most important 
agencies, including the NIH, CDC, and FDA. 
In 2005, he was appointed to the Senior Exec-
utive Service. 
Since 2007, Mr. Cash has served as HHS’s 
Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Budget, often managing the most difficult 
budgetary issues across a Department whose 
programs and services reach virtually every 
American at some point in their lives—from 
Head Start for early childhood education to 
Medicare for seniors. 
Throughout his 24 years of service at HHS’s 
Office of Budget, Mr. Cash frequently served 
as the Department’s liaison to the Committees 
on Appropriations. During that time, he be-
came an indispensable resource to the Sub-
committee on Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, and Education. Mr. Cash’s budgetary 
and programmatic expertise has helped the 
subcommittee to draft annual appropriations 
bills and emergency supplementals—for which 
I am deeply grateful. 
Most recently, Mr. Cash provided important 
technical assistance on emergency supple-
mental appropriations to respond to the 
COVID pandemic. He has been instrumental 
in HHS’s procurement of life-saving vaccines,

therapeutics, and antivirals, as well as the dis-
tribution 
of 
emergency relief funding to 
healthcare providers affected by the pan-
demic. 
In 2018, Mr. Cash earned the Presidential 
Rank Award, one of the most prestigious 
awards in the Federal career civil service, 
which recognizes members of the Senior Ex-
ecutive Service for ‘‘sustained extraordinary 
accomplishment.’’ It was aptly awarded and 
richly deserved. 
In addition to his professional achievements, 
Mr. Cash has earned three master’s degrees, 
including a master’s degree in public policy 
from Duke University, a master’s degree in 
philosophy from the University of North Caro-
lina at Chapel Hill, and a master’s degree in 
theology from Southeastern Baptist Theo-
logical Seminary. 
I thank Mr. Cash for his tireless public serv-
ice—which often included long days, evenings, 
and weekends—as he worked to ensure that 
critical health and human services programs 
had the necessary resources to serve millions 
of American families who relied on them. His 
talents and contributions will be sorely missed. 
I congratulate him on a distinguished career 
and wish him the best in his upcoming retire-
ment.
