PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of mercy, thank You for giving 
us another day. 
After a weekend of great spiritual 
significance for millions of Americans, 
we stand before You, O Lord, in need of 
Your healing presence in our Nation; in 
our world. 
Inspire the Members of this people’s 
House as they work from home, to 
bring comfort and assistance in their 
districts as they are able to do. As the 
habits and customs of the Nation 
change, may those who mourn the loss 
of loved ones, those who mourn the loss 
of lifelong businesses, look for the open 
window of futures we never needed to 
imagine before. 
It is difficult and daunting, and the 
unknown is unsettling still. Help us all 
to be of support and comfort for our 
neighbors and within our homes. Help 
us to put our trust in You. 
May everything done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FRANK J. 
QUEVEDO 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 14, 2020 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to celebrate the life of Frank J. 
Quevedo. Frank passed away on April 2, 
2020, but leaves behind a rich legacy of many 
accomplishments and was an extraordinary 
role model to many. 
Frank was born on August 14, 1944 and re-
ceived his Bachelor of Arts degree in political 
science from the University of California, Riv-
erside. 
Throughout his career, Frank served as the 
chairman on the board of the Mexican Amer-
ican Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He 
was also the chair of the Puente Project and 
co-chair of the Weingart East Los Angeles 
YMCA, and served on a number of other 
boards and advisory committees including the 
Congressional 
Hispanic 
Caucus 
Institute, 
Asian Pacific American Legal Center, Edmund 
G. ‘‘Pat’’ Brown Institute of Public Affairs, Or-
ange County Hispanic Education Endowment 
Fund, Latino Issues Forum, Cathedral High 
School Board of Trustees, White Memorial 
Medical Center Charitable Foundation, The 
Women’s Foundation of California, Asian 
American Justice Center, and the WATTS 
Health Foundation. Frank was recognized by 
Hispanic Business Magazine on its annual 
‘‘100 Influential’’ listing on four separate occa-
sions. 
Frank was appointed to positions by Presi-
dent Nixon and Governor Jerry Brown, and 
was Chief of Staff to Commissioner Tony 
Gallegos at the U.S. Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission in 1982 in the Reagan 
administration. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
the extraordinary life of Frank J. Quevedo. 
May he rest in peace and may his legacy con-
tinue.

HONORING PIMA COUNTY 
SUPERVISOR RICHARD ELIAS 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 14, 2020 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Pima County Super-
visor Richard Elias for his dedication to our 
community. Richard sadly passed away sud-
denly and unexpectedly on March 28, 2020. 
Richard was a fifth-generation Tucson na-
tive, with an unmatched love for Southern Ari-
zona; its people and its environment. His par-
ents, Albert M. Elias, a strong supporter of 
labor and a community leader, and Viola 
Blaine, instilled a set of values that guided 
Richard in his professional and personal life. 
Those values included compassion and a 
dedication to serving others. 
Richard represented Pima County District 
Five since his appointment to the seat in 
2002. Prior to that, he worked for Pima Coun-
ty, Chicanos por la Causa, and the City of 
South Tucson where he advocated for afford-
able housing and working families. 
He graduated from the University of Arizona 
with a degree in history. Richard always drew 
upon his heritage and storytelling to provide a 
more holistic perspective to issues. He was a 
proud steward of the Old Pueblo. 
During his public service career, Richard 
was never afraid to take a stand, even if it 
meant standing alone. Richard spoke his truth 
to power as a lifelong progressive Democrat. 
While he was principled in his beliefs, he 
never shied away from a difficult conversation. 
He earned the respect of his colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle. 
For over 18 years, Richard was a steady 
force on the Board of Supervisors where he 
left a large footprint. He continued the work to 
preserve one of our greatest assets, our envi-
ronment, through his advocacy of the Sonoran 
Desert Conservation Plan and of protecting 
our precious desert waterways. He was a 
staunch and effective proponent of affordable 
housing development and reinvesting in estab-
lished neighborhoods, of fighting for equitable 
access to healthcare, and of promoting the 
welfare of immigrants. He, like his Dad, was a 
union man at heart and he fought stridently for 
the rights and values of working families. 
Richard spent his last days working tire-
lessly to address the COVID–19 pandemic in 
Pima County. May it serve as a reminder that 
for Richard the well-being and safety of his 
constituents was always his priority. 
Our community has lost a kind, generous 
soul and a fighter for social justice, the envi-
ronment and working people. I submit this 
statement with great sorrow at the loss of a 
life-long friend and someone who understood 
the complexities of devoting a life to public 
service. 
My condolences are with his wife Emily and 
daughter Luz, the rest of his family, staff, 
friends, and extended community during this 
difficult time. May we all continue to be in-
spired by Richard’s tireless work and take his 
creed as our own, ‘‘Resist. Much Love.’’

CONGRATULATING 
PASTOR 
ROB-
ERT AND DEBBIE MORRIS FOR 
TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE AT 
GATEWAY CHURCH 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 14, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Pastor Robert Morris 
and his wife, Debbie, for twenty years of lead-
ership, service and worship at Gateway 
Church in my District. Their tireless efforts to 
spread the word of God and the teachings of 
Jesus Christ have reached countless believers 
over the past two decades. 
Since they founded Gateway Church in the 
year 2000, Pastor Robert and Debbie Morris 
have endeavored to create a spiritual impact 
on the Dallas/Fort Worth area and beyond. 
Twenty years ago, they began that journey by 
meeting with a small group of thirty individuals 
in their living room to pray for their upcoming 
ministry that would soon be headquartered in 
Southlake, Texas. What grew into a congrega-
tion of 180 people during their first Easter 
service now encompasses more than 71,000 
attendees across multiple campuses in North 
Texas. 
As head pastor, Robert Morris has proven 
to be an exceptional leader to the Gateway 
community, guided by a mission to truly care 
for others and trust God. That resonating mes-
sage has resulted in the production of a tele-
vision program that airs in over 190 countries 
and a radio show broadcast to more than 
1,800 stations across America. Gateway’s 
widespread following is a working testament of 
its vision to see people ‘‘saved, healed, set 
free, discipled, equipped, empowered, and 
serving.’’ 
Together, Pastor Robert and Debbie Morris 
have ensured the enduring growth and pros-
perity of Gateway’s congregation. With the 
support of their family and the spirit of service 
at heart, they have created lasting change that 
will continue to affect thousands in North 
Texas and around the world. 
Madam Speaker, on this twentieth anniver-
sary of Gateway’s first Easter service, I am 
proud to recognize their tremendous impact on 
our community. I ask all my distinguished col-
leagues to join me in congratulating their suc-
cess.

ment that can be attained with hard work and

cation and develop a work ethic which will

have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-

INSULAR AREA MEDICAID PARITY 
ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 14, 2020 
Mr. 
SABLAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
coronavirus pandemic is exposing the gaps in 
our national healthcare system like never be-
fore. One of those gaps is that our national 
Medicaid program does not reach all Ameri-
cans with full coverage. We have already ac-
knowledged that deficiency, in part, with provi-
sions in the Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act that created equity between the 
states and the territories with respect to the 
federal-local match for Medicaid. Families 
First, also, provided additional federal dollars 
for the territorial Medicaid programs. 
But the territorial programs still operate 
under an absolute cap for Medicaid assist-
ance. No matter how many fall ill, no matter 
how costly or prolonged their treatment, that 
cap will always limit care in the territories. 
Now, as never before, we have also come 
to understand that, while some areas of our 
nation are ill, no area of our nation can be 
well. So, the time has come to repeal the cap 
on territories’ Medicaid. The bill I am intro-
ducing does just that. 
By repealing the cap, we will be doing more 
than just ensuring there are sufficient re-
sources to face the coronavirus crisis. We will 
be setting up the healthcare systems in the 
territories to respond to the next public health 
challenge, whatever it may. Most important of 
all, we will ensure that day-after-day and year- 
by-year those with the smallest incomes and 
no access to other insurance receive the care 
that will keep them healthy and help ward off 
debilitating disease. 
We will, also, be providing a level of cer-
tainty to healthcare providers—in the public 
and private sector—that will encourage invest-
ment in the health industry in the territories, 
which by any measure lags the rest of the na-
tion. And by doing so we will create a virtuous 
cycle of rising quality of care powered by ris-
ing access that will benefit all at every income 
level. 
Today, we are confronted by a terrible 
health 
crisis. 
We 
can 
beat 
back 
the 
coronavirus, I am sure. But we can also do 
more. We can use this time to recognize that 
we are one nation, one people, who must 
work together not only to overcome the 
coronavirus, but also to create a system for to-
morrow that safeguards the health of all Amer-
icans. 
Full-fledged membership in the national 
Medicaid program was a goal of the territories 
long before I came to Congress. Now the time 
has come for action. Because nothing ex-
poses the gaps in our healthcare system more 
than a disease like coronavirus. 
I thank my colleagues who join in intro-
ducing this legislation—Chairman GRIJALVA, 
Chairwoman VELA´ZQUEZ, Mr. SAN NICOLAS, 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN, Ms. PLASKETT, Mr. GARCI´A, 
Mr. ESPAILLAT, and Mr. SERRANO.

velop a work ethic which will guide them for

INTRODUCTION OF THE SYSTEMIC 
RISK MITIGATION ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 14, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce the Systemic Risk Miti-
gation Act with my colleague, Representative 
KATIE PORTER of California. 
‘‘Shadow banks’’ are large, interconnected 
and complex firms—they include insurance 
companies, hedge funds, asset managers and 
others—that drive many of the risky practices 
that economists and regulators have warned 
about for years. The Trump Administration’s 
deregulatory approach only puts us at greater 
risk. And as the public health crisis brought on 
by COVID–19 drags our country into a reces-
sion and threatens to ignite underlying prob-
lems like corporate debt, it is up to Congress 
to ensure that regulators address the risks 
these firms pose to our financial system be-
fore it’s too late. 
Since Trump took office, AIG and Prudential 
Financial have been de-designated as system-
ically important and now no non-banks cur-
rently carry that designation. Shadow banks 
like these two are central to our financial sys-
tem, but by avoiding the designation of ‘‘sys-
temically important’’ they escape oversight re-
quirements such as strong capital and liquidity 
rules and annual stress tests. 
Our bill strengthens the Financial Stability 
Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E365 
April 14, 2020 
Financial Research (OFR), regulators created 
by Dodd-Frank, to identify and mitigate sys-
temic risks in the financial system. The Sys-
temic Risk Mitigation Act: 
Automatically designates shadow banks 
above a certain size and riskiness as ‘‘system-
ically important.’’ These large, complex, and 
interconnected shadow banks would be sub-
jected to strong capital and liquidity rules, an-
nual stress tests, living wills requirements, and 
other crucial safeguards; 
Provides a process for de-designation of 
firms that are found not to meet the standard 
of systemic importance; 
Strengthens the FSOC by giving the Council 
rule-making authority to address systemically 
risky activities across the financial system; 
Provides the FSOC and OFR with more re-
sources and increases their transparency; 
Creates a Climate Risk Subcommittee of the 
FSOC to assess the risk posed by climate fac-
tors to the stability of the U.S. financial sys-
tem. 
I urge this body to advance this legislation.
