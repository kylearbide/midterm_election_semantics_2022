PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O God, our help in ages past, we cast 
our eyes on the gravesites of our Amer-
ican heroes this weekend, painfully 
aware of how time flies forgotten, hav-
ing borne away our sons and daughters, 
parents, and friends. 
Call us to remember the ultimate 
sacrifice these brave warriors have 
made, having loved country more than 
self, and who were willing to give their 
lives to liberate our world from strife. 
Give rest to those whose names are 
carved in stone and engraved on griev-
ing hearts. Shed Your grace on those 
who mourn the loss of their loved one. 
We ask Your blessing on the patriot 
dream for which these our compatriots 
gave their all; a dream that ours would 
be a nation founded on freedom’s 
ideals. 
Then mend our every flaw; that what 
we call success would be nothing short 
of the nobleness of service; that the 
things we treasure would be defined 
and refined by Your abiding love. 
In You may we find our hope while 
life shall last, and our eternal home 
when life is ended. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, MAY 28, 2021 
No. 94 
Senate 
(Legislative day of Thursday, May 27, 2021) 
The Senate met at 9 a.m. and was

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, the fountain of wisdom, 
You said in John 8:31, ‘‘If you obey my 
teaching, you are really my disciples; 
you will know the truth, and the truth 
will set you free.’’ As our lawmakers 
strive to be guardians of freedom, may 
these words illuminate their path. 
Lord, remind our Senators that his-
tory is strewn with the wreckage of na-
tions that ignored liberating truth. 
We pray in the name of Him who said 
in John 14:6, ‘‘I am the truth.’’ Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ished business. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1260) to establish a new Direc-
torate for Technology and Innovation in the 
National Science Foundation, to establish a 
regional technology hub program, to require 
a strategy and report on economic security, 
science,

manufac-
turing, and job creation, to establish a crit-
ical supply chain resiliency program, and for 
other purposes. 
Pending: 
Schumer amendment No. 1502, in the na-
ture of a substitute. 
Cornyn/Cotton amendment No. 1858 (to 
amendment No. 1502), to modify the semicon-
ductor incentives program of the Depart-
ment of Commerce. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In a moment, the 
Senate will resume business. A few of 
our Republican colleagues may con-
tinue their speeches. 
The Senate spent 2 hard weeks work-
ing on this bill, and many months be-
fore that. We have every intention of 
sticking it out until the job is done, 
and that is what we are going to do. I 
look forward to passing this historic 
and extremely bipartisan bill later 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
QUORUM CALL 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we are cur-
rently $28 trillion in debt. Whose fault 
is it—Republicans? Democrats? The an-
swer is yes, yes on both fronts. Both 
parties are responsible for the debt, 
and one side is honest about it. One 
side will tell you they don’t give a fig 
about the debt: The debt be damned. 
We are for new monetary theories. 
Spend as much as you have got; borrow 
as much as you can; and somehow we 
are going to combat the influence of 
China by borrowing more money from 
China. It doesn’t really seem to make a 
lot of sense, but that is where we are. 
So we have before us a bill that will 
simply add to the debt. We will go fur-
ther in debt. You might make the argu-
ment that we are actually less strong 
as a nation the more in debt we are. 
Where is the opposition? Now, there 
is no opposition on one side of the

May 28, 2021 
aisle, and on the other side, there is 
feigned opposition. The Republicans 
will feign opposition to the debt. They 
will say: Well, yes, we care about the 
debt, and the other side spends too 
much and borrows too much. You will 
hear Republicans throughout the land 
campaigning against the debt, only to 
come to Washington and vote for most 
of the debt. So what we end up with is 
a $28 trillion debt. We actually borrow 
more in a month than we used to bor-
row in a year. In March of this year, we 
borrowed $660 billion in 1 month. 
The proposals for spending are alarm-
ing. We have spent and borrowed more 
in the last 2 years than we did during 
World War II. There are going to be re-
percussions of so much borrowing in 
such a short period of time. We are see-
ing a misallocation of capital through-
out the economy. We are seeing a 
grossly inflated stock market. We are 
starting to see inflation throughout 
the supply chain throughout the econ-
omy. There are going to be repercus-
sions. 
The question we have to ask our-
selves is, Are we willing to look at the 
example of countries like Venezuela or 
Zimbabwe that completely destroyed 
their currencies? 
People say that couldn’t happen in 
America. It largely hasn’t happened be-
cause we have been the reserve cur-
rency of the world. We have been fortu-
nate. People describe it as having the 
cleanest shirt in a closet full of dirty 
shirts. The dollar is weakened by such 
extravagant spending. Yet people still 
cling to the dollar because the other 
currencies are weaker. This bill simply 
adds more to the debt. 
We say we are going to combat China 
through this bill, but we are going to 
combat China by increasing a Depart-
ment 
of 
government—the 
National 
Science Foundation—that is actually, 
probably, one of the most wasteful 
Agencies in government. William Prox-
mire was a conservative Democrat 
from Wisconsin back in the sixties and 
seventies. He started an award called 
the Golden Fleece Award. 
One 
of 
the 
first 
Golden 
Fleece 
Awards William Proxmire gave was an 
award for a study about what makes 
people fall in love. You would think, 
with the lampooning through the years 
of the ridiculous lizards on treadmills 
and of Panamanian frogs, that, after a 
while, people would say: Instead of giv-
ing more money to this Agency that is 
so full of waste and ridiculous studies, 
we should give it less money. 
So, perhaps, if we wanted it to re-
form, we would say to the National 
Science Foundation: Instead of increas-
ing your budget 68 percent, why don’t 
we reduce your budget 10 percent and 
say behave better. What if we were to 
reform how they pick their commit-
tees? 
For example, if you want to study co-
caine and if you want to study Japa-
nese quail using cocaine and if you 
want to know if they are more sexually 
promiscuous, do you know how you 
would get approval for your funding? 
You would call up your other buddies 
who study cocaine in animals and say: 
Hey, I have got this great, new study. 
Would you guys like to join in it and be 
my peer-review committee? 
It is actually the ridiculous studies 
that we discover that are being voted 
on by people who are selected by the 
people who are doing the studies. What 
they do is they select other people with 
ridiculous studies, and they say: We 
will vote for yours if you will vote for 
mine. 
So how do we get $500,000 spent in 
studying 
Panamanian 
frogs? 
They 
want to know whether or not the mat-
ing call of the country frogs in Panama 
is different than the mating call of the 
city frogs. Well, in coming from a rural 
State, I can tell you that the mating 
call of the country folk is always dif-
ferent than the mating call of the city 
folk. We could have polled the audi-
ence. Are quail more sexually promis-
cuous on cocaine? I think we could 
have polled the audience. 
The thing is, there could be some re-
forms. For example, as much as I am 
opposed to government spending, there 
are some important diseases. Let’s say 
Alzheimer’s, cancer, diabetes, heart 
disease. Why wouldn’t we make the 
committees for the National Science 
Foundation have someone on there 
from one of the big five diseases? Why 
wouldn’t we put a taxpayer advocate 
on there? Why wouldn’t we have some 
sort of inspector general process so 
that this doesn’t happen? 
We have to review this. This isn’t an 
academic point. We have now discov-
ered that the NIH was funding the 
Wuhan lab. So we should have over-
sight on what happens, but after 50 
years of abuse at the National Science 
Foundation, we are still studying will 
people eat ants to combat climate 
change. Seriously, that was a study. 
How many ants will people eat, and 
how many ants do you have to eat to 
reduce the global warming by 1 degree? 
It is a lot of ants. 
The thing is, those are the kinds of 
studies that we are having coming out 
of here, and we don’t make it any bet-
ter by increasing their budgets. If you 
are a wasteful Agency and we give you 
more money, we will get more waste. If 
you want less waste—and this goes not 
only for this. It goes for the military. 
It goes for any other Agency of govern-
ment. If you give any Agency more 
government money, you will get more 
waste. You won’t get less. 
The cocaine was actually the NIH, 
not the NSF. The NIH has got some of 
the same problems. One of the ones 
from the NIH, in recent years, was $2 
million to see, if someone in the buffet 
line in front of you—when you are 
going through the buffet or Luby’s Caf-
eteria—sneezes on the food, are you 
more or less likely to eat the food? $2 
million. 
Now, look, if you want to come to me 
and say that we should study Alz-
heimer’s disease, I have open ears—and 
on heart disease, diabetes—but if you 
want to study whether if somebody 
sneezes on the food makes you more or 
less likely to eat the food, that is just 
ridiculous. The American people know 
it is ridiculous. If the American people 
could see what we are voting on, they 
would say: Oh, we are going to combat 
China by giving more money to the 
most wasteful Agency in the world. 
Where is the money coming from? Is 
it out of a surplus? Can we go over to 
the Federal Reserve and open this big 
safe? Is there a big case of money? Is 
there a rainy day fund? Is there a sav-
ings account that we can tap into to 
say we are going to have government- 
funded research to combat China? No. 
We have to borrow the money from 
China. 
Think of the irony. We borrow the 
money from China to put it into tech-
nology. We complain about Chinese so-
cialism, which is the government run-
ning everything and spending all of the 
money. So what are we going to do? 
The same thing. We are going to bor-
row the money from China. Then we 
are going to have government-directed 
research, to which we will all say: Oh, 
socialism isn’t good, but the govern-
ment directed this. 
Yet we are going to do the same 
thing, and we are going to be stronger 
than China. 
This is a good example—and this is 
sort of a technical detail—of how the 
committee process works and how 
grant funding works. There was $700,000 
allotted from the National Science 
Foundation for autism. Look, I know 
parents who have kids with autism, 
and I can be convinced that the Federal 
Government can be involved in some 
way, but the $700,000 that was allotted 
for autism was then taken and subcon-
tracted to a bunch of eggheads who 
wanted to listen to a tape of Neil Arm-
strong on the Moon. If you are as old as 
I, you can remember being in school 
and seeing the crackly black-and-white 
pictures coming back from the Moon 
and 
hearing 
Neil 
Armstrong 
say: 
‘‘[O]ne small step for man, one giant 
leap for mankind’’—or did he say: 
‘‘[O]ne small step for a man’’? 
A group of ‘‘researchers’’—and I use 
the term loosely—at the National 
Science Foundation got $700,000 of au-
tism money to study one word, the 
preposition ‘‘a.’’ Did Neil Armstrong 
use the letter ‘‘a’’ or the word ‘‘a’’ or 
did he not? So they studied, and they 
were diligent. They listened to this 20- 
second clip over and over again. I think 
it took them a year of listening to this. 
They wrote reports and had findings. 
Do you know what their conclusion 
was in the end? It was, We just don’t 
know. We just don’t know. Was it 
‘‘[O]ne small step for man’’ or ‘‘[O]ne 
small step for a man’’? 
This is something you could fix be-
fore throwing and heaping more bor-
rowed money on the National Science 
Foundation. Maybe we could say that 
you can’t subcontract money that was 
meant for Alzheimer’s to ridiculous re-
search.

S3917 
May 28, 2021 
How would you stop it? Maybe you 
would have a committee that reviews 
the grants and that has someone on the 
committee from one of the big five dis-
eases who actually says: Should we be 
spending the money on autism or 
should we spend the money on Neil 
Armstrong’s statement on the Moon? 
Should we be spending it on this versus 
diabetes? You see, everything is a 
tradeoff. 
Everybody comes to Washington. If 
you ask them—you know, the people 
who advocate for Alzheimer’s or diabe-
tes or cancer—‘‘Are you getting enough 
money?’’ and when I tell the autism 
parents that their money went to study 
Neil Armstrong, do you know what I 
get? I get dropped jaws and people 
going: You have got to be kidding me. 
My mother or father is dwindling away 
from 
Alzheimer’s, 
and 
they 
spent 
money studying Neil Armstrong? 
Did he say: ‘‘[O]ne small step for 
man’’ or ‘‘[O]ne small step for a man’’? 
This is lizards on the treadmill. 
Dr. Coburn was a Senator here for a 
long time, and he liked to talk about 
waste as I do. This was a decade ago— 
maybe more—that Senator Coburn was 
on the floor and would be talking about 
lizards on a treadmill. I think his was 
lizards underwater on a treadmill or— 
no. It was shrimp on a treadmill, I 
think. They have got lizards on tread-
mills, but they have got shrimp, and 
they have got crawfish on treadmills. 
Think about it, really. We are a big, 
proud country, but we are $1 trillion in 
debt. Before we get to all of the extra 
stuff—before we get to all of the COVID 
bailouts—we are $1 trillion in debt just 
from the institutional expenses of the 
country. We bring in about $3 trillion 
in revenue, and we spend about $4 tril-
lion. Of the money that we bring in, $3 
trillion is a lot. We could spend that on 
a lot of good things, but we can’t sim-
ply just say we are going to spend it on 
lizards on a treadmill and that some-
how we have enough money to do that. 
So of the expenses that we have, 
most of the money is consumed by 
Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, 
food stamps, and the military, and 
then a variety of the welfare programs. 
But that consumes $1 trillion more 
than comes in. So we have been meet-
ing over the last year, just spending 
extra money beyond the trillion-dollar 
deficit. So we have a trillion-dollar def-
icit just from our ordinary expenses, 
and then we add to that, you know, a 
couple trillion here for COVID last 
year, a couple trillion more. We are 
going to do a couple trillion more for 
free college, free daycare, free this, free 
that, but it is not free. There is no such 
thing as a free lunch. There is nothing 
in this world that you will get for free. 
You will either have the future paying 
for it—our kids and our grandkids pay-
ing for it—or you will pay for it 
through inflation or you will pay for it 
through default. 
And you can default in a dramatic 
way, through the destruction of a cur-
rency, or you can default in a gradual 
way through price inflation. 
As it is, we are starting to see the 
price inflation take off. There are peo-
ple concerned about inflation that is 
already in the stock market and where 
this goes from here. 
But I don’t think this bill makes us 
stronger. In fact, I think the Chinese 
sit back and, you know, hold their 
hand up and sort of titter and laugh at 
America thinking they are going to be 
stronger by borrowing more money 
from China. 
So I just don’t think it makes us any 
stronger at all. I think it makes us 
weaker, and it would be one thing if it 
weren’t being so horribly wasted. 
Lizards on a treadmill. So they get 
the lizard on a treadmill and then they 
have active x rays to look at its joints. 
They were curious as to why a lizard 
waddles. So if you have ever seen a liz-
ard or an iguana when they walk 
funny, they waddle. So why do they 
waddle? You know, what do their joints 
look like in x rays? 
And so we spent, you know, $1.5 mil-
lion studying lizards on a treadmill. 
One of the perennial problems in the 
Third World is the black market. We 
have it in our country. It is sort of a 
function of when taxes and regulation 
in the official economy become so on-
erous that you need to escape the offi-
cial economy. That is what the black 
market is. 
So a good example is New York City. 
The taxes on cigarettes are so high in 
New York City that you have a black 
market. In fact, the death of Eric Gar-
ner—the sad death of Eric Garner being 
choked to death in New York City had 
to do with taxes. 
And some people were offended by 
this. They go: It was police brutality. 
Of course, it was, but it was police bru-
tality based on exorbitant taxes that 
caused this man to be selling ciga-
rettes—loose cigarettes in order to try 
to make a living. But that is what hap-
pens when government becomes so big. 
So in parts of Africa, Uganda in par-
ticular, there is a big black market. 
And so God knows why or why in the 
world we are spending our money 
studying this, we decided to study 
gambling in Uganda. So we spent 
$30,000 studying gambling in Uganda. 
Well, it turns out the black market 
develops because they don’t have good 
title to their land, they don’t have 
good rule of law, they don’t have the 
things that have made our country 
great. 
But instead of sort of exporting think 
tank ideas on how great capitalism is, 
we waste it through government grants 
studying why Ugandans gamble. 
It kind of is reminiscent going back 
to the Wuhan lab. People say—this is 
what Dr. Fauci has been saying. Dr. 
Fauci says: Well, who wouldn’t want to 
study the SARS virus? 
Well, yeah, we should. But, then 
again, why would we pay the Chinese 
to do it? 
Well, there are all these viruses in 
China. 
Well, are the Chinese destitute? 
I think we are here because the Chi-
nese are kicking our butt in trade, and 
everybody is worried about China so we 
are going to do all this stuff to combat 
China, and yet we send money to a Chi-
nese lab. 
Now, we recently voted to change 
that, but it has been going on for dec-
ades. In fact, Dr. Fauci, in committee 
the other day, said he still trusts the 
Chinese, the Chinese scientists. 
He seems oblivious to the fact that 
perhaps there is a military influence in 
these labs and perhaps the scientists 
don’t do anything without permission 
of the Chinese military; perhaps if 
there was a militarization of the virus 
going on—oblivious to that. 
So there is a Space Camp in Ala-
bama. My kids went to it one year. It 
is a great camp, and I am all for it. I, 
you know, would like to see more 
Americans go. If some American kids, 
you know, don’t have the means, it 
would be nice if we could help Amer-
ican kids go to Space Camp. 
But I am not so sure, you know, why 
we borrow money from China to send 
kids in Pakistan to Space Camp in Ala-
bama or to Dollywood—you know, 
$250,000. 
We also spent over a million dollars 
in Afghanistan doing an anti-drug pro-
gram. Unfortunately, really, the drug 
problems in our country—they grow it. 
They grow it like corn. It is a crop for 
them. The problem is the demand 
comes from us, but we spent a million 
dollars on public relations television 
programming in Afghanistan, and it 
was to convince the Afghanis not to 
use drugs. It was in English. So the 
vast majority of them couldn’t under-
stand or—you know, most of them 
don’t have television sets anyway. 
But this is the kind of thing that 
runs rampant throughout our govern-
ment. So, you know, we talk about 
where would we find the resources to 
be a strong country again, to do the 
things that we could do to combat 
what happens in China. When we look 
at that, we say where could the money 
come from? 
Well, we spend $50 billion a year in 
Afghanistan on the war. It has been 
going on 20 years. The war is 18 years 
past having any useful mission at all. 
The mission was over probably once 
the Taliban was defeated. There was 
still some mission for bin Laden, but it 
didn’t really require necessarily troops 
on the ground and nation-building. 
But we have been doing nation-build-
ing in Afghanistan. So our Nation 
crumbles, and we worry about China— 
you know, the threat of the ascendance 
of China—and yet, what are we doing? 
We are borrowing money from China to 
build roads in Afghanistan. 
One of the things they did in Afghan-
istan years ago is they were going to 
build a natural gas gas station. This 
was to reduce the footprint of Afghani-
stan, the carbon footprint. 
So this is the absurdities we some-
times go to with climate change. This 
is a country that cooks their food on

open fires often. This is a country with 
an average income of about $800. Most 
people do not have a car. So what did 
we decide to do for Afghanistan to re-
duce their carbon footprint? We de-
cided to build a natural gas gas sta-
tion. 
So the natural gas gas station was 
built. It was supposed to cost $800,000, 
but, you know, sometimes government 
is not that efficient so they had a few 
cost overruns—83—and it ended up 
costing $45 million. 
So my question, as I heard about this 
natural gas gas station, was, How 
many Americans have a car that runs 
on natural gas? I think there are a 
handful of people who are really into it 
and have converted their cars into run-
ning on natural gas. There is a truck-
ing company I am aware of. You know, 
it is not a bad idea, but it is a bone-
headed, idiotic idea to build a gas sta-
tion for natural gas vehicles in Afghan-
istan. They don’t have cars, much less 
cars that run on natural gas, but we 
did it. We spent $45 million in Afghani-
stan on it. 
So my staff was over there looking at 
the waste, and they said to the mili-
tary: Can we go see the famous natural 
gas gas station? And as they—they 
wanted to go see it. The marine said: 
Well, it would take two helicopters full 
of 30 marines in each helicopter to take 
you to the gas station, so we were told 
it was too dangerous, and we didn’t 
want to insist on something that was 
that dangerous. 
So we spent $45 million on a gas sta-
tion that we can’t visit because it is 
too dangerous to serve up natural gas 
that nobody has a car that runs on nat-
ural gas. And my imagination goes to 
the gas station, and all I can imagine is 
sort of copper tubing sticking out of 
the ground, people running off with 
copper tubing. 
We built major highways over there, 
but one of the biggest problems is no 
cars, but the other problem they have 
in Afghanistan is people put their cam-
els in their tents, and so if you ever 
want a car to go up and down the road, 
you got to shoo the camels and the 
tents off the road. 
We decided to build luxury hotels. 
See, this is part of our national de-
fense. I think it was the Overseas In-
vestment Bank, or whatever. We spent 
$90 million on a hotel in Kabul. 
Well, we didn’t quite get it finished. 
The contractor built about half the 
hotel. He built the shell of the hotel 
with no walls. I think he completed one 
room so he could send pictures home to 
say he was making progress. The hotel 
was never built. The guy ran off with, 
like, 60 million of the 90 million. The 
hotel still sits there, and guess what. It 
is a shell of a building. Our people are 
worried about the Taliban crawling up 
in it and shooting down into our Em-
bassy. 
So the next thing is—I am surprised 
it is not in this bill. It may be. Who 
knows what is in this bill. They need 
another 250 grand to destroy what is 
left of the hotel. The guy ran off with 
the money, and we have a shell of a 
building. It is a danger to our Embassy 
so we need to tear it down. 
So, really, you know, we should have 
an amendment to put more money in 
this bill to tear down the hotel—the 
luxury hotel that we subsidized in Af-
ghanistan. 
The list goes on and on and on. The 
frustration of the American people is, 
Why does it never change? 
William Proxmire was talking about 
this in 1972, studying why people fall in 
love. Why do people date? The govern-
ment is doing dating apps studying 
why people are happy or unhappy, 
studying whether or not, if you take a 
selfie of yourself smiling and look at it 
later in the day, whether or not that 
will make you happy. Seriously. 
Half a million here, a million there. 
Is there anything in this bill that will 
stop that from happening? So it has 
been happening for 50 years. You know, 
we didn’t even authorize these things. 
They just go on and on. There is no 
oversight. You ask any questions, no-
body wants to give you any answers, 
and it goes on and on. 
Now, this isn’t just one party. Both 
parties do it. Both parties are going to 
vote for this bill, but I guarantee, if 
you put up the different waste things 
that are going on in our government 
and you said that this is the Agency 
that is studying the mating call of the 
Panamanian frog, these are the Agen-
cies studying whether someone sneezes 
on your food, you think the American 
people would be with you? 
They are only with you because they 
don’t know what you are doing today. 
They don’t know that you are wasting 
more money; that you are shoveling 
good money after bad. They don’t know 
that this is more of the same; that this 
has been going on for 50 years. And no-
body, Republican or Democrat, is fix-
ing the problem. We are just shoveling 
more money out the door. 
We are destroying our country. We 
are destroying our currency. Right 
now, it is a little bit at a time. It is 
coming through inflation, but inflation 
is out there. It is lurking. People are 
talking about it. 
But there is also another way you 
can destroy your country. If you look 
at the 20th century and you look at the 
decline in the stock market, most of it 
is in, like, 7 days. So those who think 
that we couldn’t have a precipitous 
correction; that there couldn’t be a 
precipitous correction, where all of a 
sudden everybody wakes up in the mar-
ketplace and says ‘‘Oh, my goodness. 
The emperor has no clothes’’—we are 
$28 trillion in debt, and we have compa-
nies that have, you know, 200-to-1 
price-to-earnings ratio. We have com-
panies that are worth hundreds and 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, and 
yet what is their profit? Some of them 
don’t make a profit. 
Is there going to be a day where peo-
ple wake up and say: ‘‘Oh, my good-
ness, the stock market. The emperor 
has no clothes,’’ and there is a massive 
selloff? I don’t know. 
But I do worry that the stock market 
is grossly inflated. I do worry, when we 
pass out $1,400 checks, which we did not 
have, we give them to everybody, and 
what do the young people do with their 
checks? Buy GameStop. So GameStop 
goes through the roof, makes no profit. 
It is a dying company, and it goes 
through the roof because everybody 
gets giddy on it because everybody has 
got all this free money. 
There is no free money. Ultimately, 
the $1,400 we gave to people will be lost 
as wages don’t keep up with inflation. 
It happens even as we speak. 
Inflation has been low, but over the 
last decade, the dollar lost 17 percent 
of its purchasing power. Do you think 
everybody in America got a 17-percent 
gain? 
See, this is sort of the difference be-
tween the seen and the unseen. Fred-
eric Bastiat was a philosopher, parlia-
mentarian in France in the 19th cen-
tury, and he talked a lot about this. He 
wrote a book called ‘‘The Law,’’ and he 
talked about the seen and the unseen. 
It is also the intended and the unin-
tended. 
People—I call it the big heart, small 
brain syndrome of Washington. Every-
body wants to help somebody. We have 
the same compassion. We want to help 
those out of work, but if you give peo-
ple too much not to work, then they 
won’t work. 
If people don’t work for a long period 
of time, they won’t be hired again. This 
was illustrated when we extended un-
employment to 99 weeks. It was done 
out of compassion, but as we extended 
unemployment to 99 weeks, what hap-
pened? 
Anybody who stayed out of work 99 
weeks and came in looking for a job, if 
there was another worker that had 
been out of work less, guess who got 
hired. Every study showed this. 
So if an employer is faced with two 
employees, one has been out of work 10 
weeks, one has been out of work 99 
weeks, guess who gets hired. The one 
who has been out of work 10 weeks. 
So when you institutionalize unem-
ployment, when you pay people more 
from the government not to work than 
to work, you get a permanent class of 
unemployed, and there comes a point 
when they are unemployable. What 
does that do to the people? What does 
that do to a person? 
I think our self-esteem is tied up in 
what we do for a living, and I think 
there is self-esteem in every job, from 
cleaning the floors, to designing a car-
pet, to creating the carpet, to laying 
bricks, to being a doctor or lawyer. 
Your self-esteem comes from being 
proud of your work. It comes from 
work. You cannot get self-esteem with-
out work, and you can’t be given self- 
esteem. 
We have some newfangled ideas in 
school that we just give it. You know, 
Johnny can’t spell, but we are going to 
pat him on the back and give him a

trophy because it will help his self-es-
teem. No. You have to earn self-es-
teem. But if we get a whole class of 
people who don’t work, it is a prob-
lem—the lack of self-esteem, the worry 
and concern that come from this. The 
lack of what it takes to be a robust 
person is part of the problem with the 
sinking into despair and addiction that 
we have as a problem in our country. 
This is another waste project that 
comes out of our State Department. We 
fund the State Department for diplo-
macy. I am for that. But we end up 
funding things in the State Depart-
ment, and you wonder if they are use-
ful for diplomacy or whether they are 
just pork barrel politics. 
This is $850,000 that was given to a 
for-profit Afghan television station to 
support the development of a national 
cricket league. Really? So our State 
Department, 
which—you 
know, 
we 
have to pay Ambassadors. We have to 
pay Assistant Ambassadors. We have 
got to pay all the different personnel, 
those protecting the Ambassadors and 
our Embassies. We have to pay for Em-
bassies, the electricity. All that stuff, 
we have to do. I am for that. 
Where do we get the money to pay 
for cricket? Why is this the business of 
the U.S. Government? But here is the 
point: Does it ever get better? Does 
someone say ‘‘My goodness. Someone 
stuck this little earmark in for the Na-
tional Cricket League’’? Does someone 
ever say ‘‘Oh my goodness. We did 
this?’’ and we reform the process and 
never do it again? No. We give them 
more money. Every year, every Agency 
in government gets more money. 
If you think there is a waste problem 
in government and you want to fix it, 
it won’t get better if you give people 
more money. You would have to give 
them less. 
So what I would do is I would give ev-
erybody 99 percent of what they had 
last year—if it is a terrible Agency like 
the National Science Foundation, I 
might give them 50 percent of what 
they had last year—and I would say to 
them: Prove to me that you are not 
going to do this again. They were 
studying dating back in 1972, and Prox-
mire lampooned them. Fifty years 
later, they are studying selfies. They 
haven’t learned their lesson. 
If you look at the process, they pick 
the people they want to approve their 
projects. You scratch my back; I will 
scratch yours. You do cocaine studies? 
Hey, me too. You approve my cocaine 
study; I will approve yours. That is 
what goes on at the National Science 
Foundation. 
This one is kind of close to home. 
You may have seen it. We call it ‘‘A 
Streetcar Named Waste.’’ It is about a 
couple blocks from the Capitol over on 
H Street. It is a streetcar they spent 
millions of dollars on. For years, there 
was nobody on it, and for years, it 
didn’t go anywhere. It was a streetcar 
to nowhere, basically. But we spent $1.6 
million on this, and basically you could 
see it as basically a trolley car with 
nobody in it. 
It was sort of this nostalgia. It is one 
thing to preserve something, but it is 
another thing to create some sort of 
thing that hasn’t existed for 50 years 
and nobody rides. And that cost us $1.6 
million, and often you will see it sit-
ting vacant and not in use at all. 
Now, we have decided that—I don’t 
even know why they even think they 
need this anymore because I think cli-
mate alarmism has really penetrated 
all of our education. But just in case 
there is a child in the country who is 
not afraid that the oceans will rise and 
cover the land and that we are all 
going to drown and that the polar bears 
are going to drown, we need to make 
sure they know it through a special 
video game. So we spent half a million 
dollars on a video app to try to con-
vince our kids that the polar bears are 
drowning sometime soon and that the 
end of the world is around the corner. 
Will the Chair inform me how much 
time I have remaining? 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Twenty-eight and a half minutes. 
Mr. PAUL. I think at this point, I 
would reserve the remainder of my 
time. 
Mr. President, I would reserve the re-
mainder of my time. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
today I would like to speak on some 
amendments I have for this bill. I 
think it is important that we are all 
heard on this bill, that everybody gets 
an opportunity to understand what we 
are doing here. I think the people back 
home in Alabama would really appre-
ciate that. I am getting a lot of emails 
and letters about things that are going 
on with this bill, and I just want the 
people back home to understand what 
we are laying out there to where we 
can—our people back in Alabama un-
derstand the direction that we are tak-
ing. 
You know, I spoke recently about 
how the President’s skinny budget is 
disappointing and dangerous and a dis-
service to our men and women in uni-
form. 
China actively seeks to outpace the 
U.S. military, and in some cases, they 
are succeeding. This isn’t a 5- or 10- 
year problem; the threat is right now. 
It is no secret that the Chinese Com-
munist Party, or the CCP, wants to re-
place the United States as the world’s 
top power. 
The American people need to be 
aware of how the Chinese Communist 
Party is coming after us—not just with 
missiles and military might but with 
plans to subdue the American spirit. 
A significant part of what has made 
the United States a global powerhouse 
is the strength and resilience of our 
private sector companies. Whether it is 
in the technology, healthcare, or en-
ergy sector, American innovation is 
unravelling. It is what made us the 
greatest economy in the history of the 
world. 
China’s leaders know this, but rather 
than go head-to-head in an honest com-
petition, they have settled for stealing 
our intellectual property. Chinese busi-
nesses, at the instruction of their gov-
ernment, lure American companies in. 
They offer cheap—very cheap—labor. 
They promise an exchange of ideas, but 
they really want to steal our valuable 
intellectual property. 
China’s strategy is to rob, replicate, 
and replace. China robs American com-
panies of their intellectual property. 
They replicate our technology. They 
will go after whatever they can to get 
their hands on wind turbines, airplane 
designs, underwater drones, chemicals, 
or artificial intelligence technology. 
According to the Department of Jus-
tice, between 2011 and 2018, more than 
90 percent of the Department’s foreign 
economic 
espionage 
cases 
involved 
China. Their goal is to surpass the U.S. 
economy and gain a monopoly control 
over every major industry. We cannot 
allow them to succeed. 
Even more alarming is what China is 
doing from within our own univer-
sities. Confucius Institutes currently 
operate at 55 American colleges and 
universities. They actually serve as a 
beachhead for the Chinese Government 
within America’s research institutions. 
Often, just the presence of a Confucius 
Institute on campus will enable Chi-
nese officials to stifle any criticism of 
the Chinese Government at that uni-
versity. 
The institutes also allow the Chinese 
Government to harvest valuable data 
from research being conducted at our 
country’s world-class institutions. I 
was also glad to see Alabama A&M, a 
public land-grant, historically Black 
university, make the decision to close 
their Confucius Institute just last 
month. 
The United States and the entire 
Western world have given China valu-
able concessions for decades. We gave 
China a seat at the table thinking they 
would change, but they have played 
their hand ruthlessly. It is past time 
we recognize that despite all the good 
intentions, this strategy has failed and 
failed miserably. The Chinese Com-
munist Party has continually spied on 
its citizens, violently suppressed dis-
sent, and systematically persecuted re-
ligious and ethnic minorities to the 
point of genocide. 
I sincerely hope President Biden will 
continue to build on the Trump admin-
istration’s momentum in pushing back 
against China’s aggressive rise. 
The TSP, or the Thrift Savings Plan, 
is the 401(k)-style investment plan that 
over 6 million Federal Government em-
ployees, both military and civilian, use 
for their retirement plan. The plan 
manages more than $700 billion in as-
sets. 
Back in 2017, the Board that governs 
the TSP decided to invest billions in 
companies with direct ties to the Chi-
nese Communist Party. Now, the peo-
ple who put money in this are all of our

military in this country, all our civil-
ian government officials, including ev-
erybody in this room, in Congress, any-
body who works for the Federal Gov-
ernment. This is their 401(k). Do we 
want to be investing in China? 
We need congressional action to 
make President Trump’s decision with 
the Thrift Savings Plan permanent. I 
bet if you ask folks who work at these 
buildings or who served the United 
States overseas if they want their re-
tirement savings going to Chinese com-
panies, you would hear a loud no. 
I will be offering a solution on this to 
protect our national security and safe-
guard the retirements of those who 
have served our country with honor 
and distinction. 
The problem with the companies that 
are being invested in in China—they 
don’t go by the same rules we go by. 
They 
commit 
corporate 
espionage. 
They don’t go by the same standards of 
unity or same standards in banking. 
They take money from the Federal 
Government and from our employees to 
support the military in China. 
In October 2019, Senators RUBIO and 
SHEEHAN sent a letter to the Federal 
Retirement Thrift Investment Board 
regarding the fact that the Board had 
reversed a previous decision to keep 
TSP investment out of China. The Sen-
ators urged the Board to maintain the 
previous decision, citing human rights 
and forced labor violations in China, 
among other issues. 
I will read that letter now and ask 
unanimous consent that it be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, October 22, 2019. 
Hon. MICHAEL KENNEDY, 
Chairman, Federal Retirement Thrift Invest-
ment Board, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN KENNEDY: We write in ad-
vance of the Federal Retirement Thrift In-
vestment Board’s upcoming October 28, 2019 
meeting to urge the reversal of the Board’s 
previous decision to track the MSCI All 
Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market 
Index (ACWI ex-US IMI) fund for invest-
ments made in the Thrift Savings Plan 
(TSP)’s International Stock Fund (I Fund). 
As noted in previous correspondence, this de-
cision would effectively invest the retire-
ment savings of America’s civil servants and 
military personnel in constituent companies 
of the ACWI ex-US IMI that assist in the 
Chinese government’s military activities, es-
pionage, and human rights abuses, as well as 
many other Chinese companies that lack 
basic financial transparency. 
The constituent firms of MSCI ACWI ex-US 
IMI include military contractors to the Peo-
ple’s Liberation Army, like the Aviation In-
dustry Corporation of China and China 
Unicom, which supply military aircraft and 
telecommunications support to militarized 
artificial islands in the South China Sea. It 
also includes firms like Hangzhou Hikvision 
Digital Technology, which was recently 
added to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s 
Entity List and produces surveillance equip-
ment the Chinese government currently uses 
to oppress and detain approximately one mil-
lion Uighur Muslims and other religious mi-
norities, as well as ZTE Corporation, which 
was fined last year for violating U.S. sanc-
tions law for business activity with Iran and 
North Korea and which Congress has enacted 
a law to prohibit the U.S. federal govern-
ment from procuring. 
Additionally, the basic financial hazards of 
investment in firms listed on Chinese ex-
changes are well documented. A recent ac-
counting scandal involving one of China’s 
biggest accounting firms, Ruihua Certified 
Public Accountants, highlights the extent of 
the irregularities in the financial markets to 
which federal employees may soon be ex-
posed. 
It is our responsibility to these public serv-
ants to ensure that the investment of their 
retirement savings does not undermine the 
American interests for which they serve. 
We look forward to the Board’s reversal of 
this decision. 
Sincerely, 
MARCO RUBIO, 
Senator. 
JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
Senator. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. To the Honorable 
Michael Kennedy, Chairman, Federal 
Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman KENNEDY: 
We write in advance of the Federal Retire-
ment Thrift Investment Board’s upcoming 
October 28, 2019 meeting to urge the reversal 
of the Board’s previous decision to track the 
MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable 
Market Index, (ACWI ex-US IMI) fund for in-
vestments made in the Thrift Savings Plan 
. . . International Stock Fund. . . . As noted 
in previous correspondence, this decision 
would effectively invest the retirement sav-
ings of America’s civil servants and military 
personnel in constituent companies of the 
ACWI ex-US IMI that assist in the Chinese 
government’s military activities, espionage, 
and human rights abuses, as well as many 
other Chinese companies that lack basic 
transparency.

ple’s Liberation Army, like the Aviation In-
dustry Corporation of China and China 
Unicom, which supply military aircraft and 
telecommunications support to militarized 
artificial islands in the South China Sea. It 
also includes firms like Hangzhou Hikvision 
Digital Technology, which was recently 
added to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s 
Entity List and produces surveillance equip-
ment the Chinese government currently uses 
to oppress and detain approximately one mil-
lion Uighur Muslims and other religious mi-
norities, as well as ZTE Corporation, which 
was fined last year for violating U.S. sanc-
tions law for business activity with Iran and 
North Korea and which Congress has enacted 
a law to prohibit the U.S. federal govern-
ment from procuring. 
Additionally, the basic financial hazards of 
investment in firms listed on Chinese ex-
changes are well documented. A recent ac-
counting scandal involving one of China’s 
biggest accounting firms . . . highlights the 
extent of the irregularities in the financial 
markets to which federal employees may 
soon be exposed. 
It is our responsibility to these public serv-
ants to ensure that the investment of their 
retirement savings does not undermine the 
American interests for which they serve. 
We look forward to the Board’s rever-
sal of this decision. 
It is signed by U.S. Senator MARCO 
RUBIO and U.S. Senator JEANNE SHA-
HEEN; U.S. Senator MITT ROMNEY, U.S. 
Senator KRISTEN GILLIBRAND, U.S. Sen-
ator JOSH HAWLEY, and U.S. Senator 
RICK SCOTT. 
I wrote an op-ed a few weeks ago 
about this very situation—a very un-
usual situation where we were uplifting 
the Chinese economy with Federal tax 
dollars. I would like to read that to 
you now. 
The Wall Street Journal, May 27, 
2021: 
If I walked into Byron’s Smokehouse in 
Auburn, Ala., and asked folks if they’d want 
their retirement savings invested in Chinese 
companies, I’d get laughed out of the res-
taurant. So why would we allow the federal 
Thrift Savings Plan, which serves approxi-
mately six million government employees 
and retirees, including [our] military. . . . to 
do just that? 
The board that governs the TSP wants to 
invest a considerable portion of its more 
than $700 billion in assets in companies with 
direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party. 
President Trump stopped that move from 
going into effect last year, but with a new 
president in office, the order blocking the 
board’s decision no longer carries weight. 
This amendment says that in the fu-
ture, no matter who the President is, 
we will not invest pension money from 
the Federal Government and our mili-
tary into Chinese businesses. 
Continuing: 
Congressional action is needed to provide a 
permanent solution, rather than relying on 
the whims of executive action. That’s why I 
am introducing the Prohibiting TSP Invest-
ment in China Act. This bill would bar TSP 
funds from being invested in any security of 
an entity based in China or in a subsidiary 
that is owned or operated by a Chinese com-
pany. 
Blocking investment of federal retirement 
savings in Chinese companies is good for U.S. 
national security and good for investors. We 
shouldn’t be funneling capital to firms that 
routinely violate U.S. sanctions laws and ac-
tively enable the Chinese Communist Party’s 
military expansion and persecution of reli-
gious minorities. Chinese companies have a 
long history of putting investors at serious 
risk by manipulating financial reporting 
statements and failing to comply with basic 
audit standards to artificially inflate their 
performance. 
The Luckin Coffee incident is a prime ex-
ample. The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission found that Luckin, the largest coffee 
chain in China, defrauded U.S. investors by 
lying about the firm’s performance and in-
flating retail sales by more than $300 mil-
lion. Luckin settled with the SEC by agree-
ing to pay a $180 million fine, but Americans 
who invested their retirement savings in 
funds exposed to Luckin’s deception lost 
[hundreds of] millions [of dollars]. 
China-based companies whose stock is 
traded on U.S. exchanges are prohibited by 
Beijing from complying with U.S. securities 
and financial-reporting standards. The Chi-
nese government also blocks U.S. regulators 
at the Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Board from conducting standard in-
spections of the Chinese offices of inter-
national audit firms. Congress put investor 
protections in place for a reason. If a com-
pany is not in compliance, investors are at 
risk. 
China’s refusal to allow its companies to 
comply with basic investor safeguards is 
cause enough to prohibit the investment of 
government-employee retirement funds in 
China firms, but there are additional reasons 
to take pause. 
Chinese contractors are supplying Beijing’s 
military buildup, enabling aggressive action 
in the South China Sea and toward land-

based neighbors like Vietnam and India. 
These firms also supply the Chinese govern-
ment with equipment used to spy on its citi-
zens and commit genocide against religious 
minorities, like the Uyghurs of Xinjiang 
province. Not a single U.S. dollar should be 
contributed to the Communist Party’s con-
tinuing human-rights abuses. 
The American people recognize the eco-
nomic and military threat China poses to the 
U.S. The Prohibiting TSP Investment in 
China Act would advance our national-secu-
rity interests and restrict funds from flowing 
to firms beholden to China’s communist re-
gime. 
I have got one more article I want to 
read on the TSP bill warning that U.S. 
investment props up the Chinese mili-
tary, supports political and religious 
persecution. This article comes from 
Breitbart. 
[Today in] an appearance on FBN’s ‘‘Morn-
ings with Maria,’’ Sen. TOMMY TUBERVILLE 
(R-AL) touted an effort to stop investment 
from the Thrift Savings Fund into securities 
linked to the Chinese economy. 
The so-called Prohibiting TSP Investment 
in China Act would stop halt that invest-
ment, which according to the Alabama Re-
publican lawmaker, could be used in a way 
to further China’s aggressive tactics on the 
world stage. 
‘‘[I] can remember back in 2017, you talked 
a lot about this,’’ he said. ‘‘And President 
Trump, you know, there’s a board of five 
people that control the pension fund, this 
pension fund is government workers, federal 
workers, such as Congress, myself, and all of 
[us on Capitol Hill, government workers, and 
includes] $700 billion. 
So what we want to do is make sure that 
we don’t prop up the military, of the Chinese 
nor their political and religious persecution. 
. . . We want to go with companies that are 
going to go by the rules, fight for democracy. 
And at the end of the day, this legislation 
pretty much says, this is a message that 
sends zero tolerance to the Chinese to block 
their aggression towards United States and 
the rest of the world. 
On defense spending, our job as elect-
ed officials is to make sure those who 
have stepped up to defend our country 
have the resources they need to do 
their job. The President’s recent budg-
et proposal for the Department of De-
fense does not—I repeat, does not—give 
our men and women in uniform the 
tools to do their job. 
It is clear that President Biden 
thinks we don’t need further invest-
ment in our military. If it is clear, he 
thinks it is OK to ask our men and 
women to do more with less, and that 
is impossible. 
The world has changed a lot in 50 
years. When President Biden first came 
to Washington in 1972, there were two 
superpowers, the United States of 
America and the Soviet Union. Back 
then, we spent 6.5 percent of our Fed-
eral budget on national defense—6.5 
percent. Today, we spend less than 3.5 
percent—a huge drop. 
Secretary Austin has said that China 
remains the top ‘‘pacing threat’’ for 
our military. 
Simply keeping pace with China is 
not enough. We have got to outpace all 
of our adversaries, but doing that re-
quires smart, substantial, and strategic 
investment 
in 
our 
military—much 
more investment than the President 
and many people here in Congress pub-
licly propose. 
President Biden says he wants his ad-
ministration to trust the experts on 
things like COVID, but this defense 
budget shows he doesn’t apply that 
same principle to the Pentagon. 
Here is what ADM Charles Richard, 
Commander of the U.S. Strategic Com-
mand, who is over our nuclear capabili-
ties, said in last week’s hearing to the 
Senate Armed Services Committee: 
I have what I need to deter today. . . . But 
I need it modernized. There’s no remaining 
margin of error. 
His warning is clear. We must mod-
ernize our greatest deterrent and keep 
peace among our adversaries with our 
nuclear arsenal. The free world, mean-
ing the United States, works and sleeps 
under a nuclear umbrella that hasn’t 
been updated to the digital age. 
We are also in a new space race, and 
it is a race we have no choice that we 
must win. In the next 20 years, the 
total cost of just arming space will be 
$2 trillion, and we have no choice but 
to win in space. 
The Chinese want to weaponize this 
new frontier of war, and we are falling 
behind. We are also falling behind Rus-
sia. We have got to make a change in 
attitude toward what we are doing in 
space, and it starts right here in this 
room. 
I heard about the growing gap be-
tween us and the Chinese when I vis-
ited the Army Materiel Command at 
Redstone Arsenal a few weeks ago in 
Huntsville, AL. These folks shared 
with me how desperately we need to 
modernize our space-based systems 
that contribute to our missile defense. 
The U.S. Army is the largest consumer 
of space products, and our military re-
lies on the Materiel Command to pro-
vide the resources to train our soldiers 
for 
research, 
development 
of 
new 
equipment, and defend our Nation. 
They should not have to beg us or the 
President of the United States for the 
money to invest in the capabilities 
that we need. At the end of the day, 
our generals’ main report to us is, ‘‘We 
can afford to survive.’’ Think about 
that quote: ‘‘We can afford to survive.’’ 
We also need to invest in the safety 
of our service men and women, espe-
cially in aviation. Currently, the aver-
age age of an airplane in our military 
is older than the pilots flying it. 
Alabama is home to Fort Rucker, to 
which every Army helicopter pilot 
comes to get their training. When I vis-
ited the folks at Fort Rucker, they told 
me about the very real need for in-
creased flight training hours for pilots, 
which requires more investment and 
prioritization in the defense budget. 
Alabama stands ready to continue to 
build our military so we can maintain 
our status as a preeminent fighting 
force in the world. We have hundreds of 
contractors and more than 200,000 em-
ployed in the defense sector across our 
State in Alabama. Those top-notch 
men and women support our world- 
class military installations, from the 
shipbuilders in Mobile to Redstone Ar-
senal in Huntsville, and many places in 
between. 
Telling our forces to fight a war with 
outdated tools is like giving a football 
team some leather helmets and decades 
old, poorly fitted pads and expecting 
them 
to 
compete 
against 
modern 
equipment. But that is exactly what 
this administration’s defense budget is 
requesting our military to do. Frankly, 
it is a huge disappointment coming 
from our Commander in Chief. We can-
not let our men and women down. 
In the coming weeks, I will be work-
ing with colleagues on the National De-
fense Authorization Act and budget 
that will enable our military to do the 
job better today and prepare for all the 
challenges tomorrow. I am willing to 
keep fighting for the United States by 
investing in the men and women who 
keep us safe. I urge my colleagues and 
President Biden to do the same. 
EMPOWERING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT 
Mr. President, on supporting our law 
enforcement, being a law enforcement 
officer is, if not the toughest, one of 
the toughest jobs that there is. Some-
times it is taken for granted. But it is 
also foundational to a functioning soci-
ety like the United States. We rely on 
these brave men and women to protect 
and serve our country every day. We 
are lucky to have many brave and hon-
orable officers in all of our States 
across the country. 
I 
think 
about 
Officer 
Jonathan 
Espino from the Decatur Police De-
partment in Alabama. Last year, he re-
sponded to a medical call, a man trying 
to bring his mom back to life, trying to 
perform CPR. This officer took over for 
the man after he arrived and began 
CPR. Just before medical personnel ar-
rived, the woman’s heart started beat-
ing again and she was gasping for air. 
This officer saved her life. It could 
have been you, your mom, or one of 
your family. 
And I think of Officer Wesley Har-
rison of the Abbeville Police Depart-
ment in Alabama. Officer Harrison re-
ceived a call that a woman was in a 
burning building. Officer Harrison ar-
rived on the scene and, minutes later, 
after going into the building, came out 
carrying an elderly woman out of the 
structure, putting his life in danger, 
with the help of another investigator. 
These police officers went above and 
beyond the call of duty, and they saved 
her life. 
That is what police officers do. So 
when you get up every day and you put 
that uniform on of a law enforcement 
officer across this country, no matter 
who you are, you put that badge on 
your chest, you put that gun on your 
side, it could be the last time that you 
walk out your front door. 
Not many jobs have those things that 
could happen to you. Most of us have 
jobs where you go, you work, and you 
know when you are expected to go 
home every day. But not police offi-
cers, especially in this day and time.

May 28, 2021 
Every day, we are having problems 
across this country where police offi-
cers are even set up. They are set up by 
the criminals, and they are shot and 
some are killed. That is what has hap-
pened to these law enforcement officers 
every day of their career, which is why 
I firmly believe we need not less but 
more support for law enforcement. 
They need more training so they can 
be better at handling difficult situa-
tions, and this is especially true as we 
see an uptick of mental health addic-
tion across this country. It is getting 
worse every day. They need targeted 
resources so they can recruit the best 
and the brightest for these important 
roles in the community and across our 
country. Let’s, as a group, invest in the 
resources that can assure all law en-
forcement officers are truly good for 
the people across every State and 
across our country. We owe that to 
them. They keep us safe. 
Right now, unless State and law en-
forcement agencies have an agreement 
with Immigration and Customs En-
forcement, if a rural law enforcement 
sheriff or city official encounters an il-
legal immigrant in the course of per-
forming their normal duties in their 
hometowns, they cannot arrest or de-
tain that individual for immigration 
purposes. 
I want you to think about that. This 
year we are going to have between 1 
million and 2 million illegal immi-
grants come across our border. We 
don’t know who they are. We don’t 
know where they have been. We don’t 
know if they have any skills. But they 
are coming across our border, and it is 
an amazing sight. 
I spent a day down there watching 
this, watching our Customs and Border 
Protection agents not be agents or law 
enforcement. They were doing custo-
dial work. They were doing things that 
they had to do just to process these 
men and women across our border. 
And I say ‘‘our border.’’ I say ‘‘com-
ing across our border.’’ I need to 
change that because, when I was at the 
border just a few weeks ago, that bor-
der does not belong to us anymore. It 
belongs to the cartel. 
It costs $3,000 to $10,000 to come 
across the Rio Grande, sometimes 
maybe more. They are coming from 
countries all over the world. Some peo-
ple think that they are just coming 
from countries south of our border— 
Mexico and in South America. That is 
totally false. They are coming from 
China. They are coming from the Mid-
dle East. They are coming from parts 
unknown, and we have no clue who 
these people are. 
Just a few years ago—I have a farm 
in Auburn, AL. I raise deer. I can show 
you how to lose money. I have a high 
fence. I get a call one day from the po-
lice department—the sheriff’s depart-
ment—saying: Coach, we need you to 
come down to the sheriff’s department. 
So I go down. There had been a sting 
operation going on with a group of peo-
ple who were not too far from my farm. 
They had a compound built. Unfortu-
nately for their group, they had gone 
to Atlanta, which is an hour and a half 
away, to purchase some AR–15s on the 
street. So they were looking for gun 
sellers. 
So, as they found out that they could 
buy these guns, they go back to their 
place just off my farm there in Auburn. 
Unfortunately for them, the FBI was 
undercover, and they followed them 
back and they busted them. 
I can’t remember the number—four, 
five, six—but they had a compound, 
and what they were doing? They were 
teaching people how to make bombs. 
Now, this is in Auburn, AL. This is not 
in New York City or Chicago, Orlando, 
or Miami. And they were building 
bombs and teaching people how to 
build bombs. Obviously, they were ar-
rested. They were all from the Middle 
East and had no papers. Our country 
had no record of why they were here, 
how they got here, but they were here. 
We have these cells all over the coun-
try. That is the reason we need a se-
cure border. 
So right now, after they come across 
the border, we have what we call immi-
gration police, better known as ICE. If 
you come across the border, the people 
who have authority over the people 
who come who are here illegally—ICE 
has the authority, not the local or 
State law enforcement. Now, they can 
work directly with them, but if State 
and local law enforcement come up on 
people who are illegal, they have no ju-
risdiction. That is what is wrong with 
our immigration laws. 
Last year—or this last 5 months—ICE 
apprehensions have gone down 70 per-
cent because of the rules and regula-
tions that have been put on by this ad-
ministration. We can’t allow that to 
happen. We are losing the sanctity, the 
security, and the sovereignty of our 
country, and it is a domino effect. 
When they come in, they are sent all 
over the country. 
When I left McAllen, TX, a few weeks 
ago to fly back, half the plane was full 
of people that were not Americans. 
They were people from other places, 
people who were here illegally. They 
were here with young kids. There were 
young mothers. And they were here 
without any family. 
I sat next to a young lady who was 
probably 19 years old. She couldn’t 
speak English. She had probably a 4- or 
5-month-old with her. She cried the en-
tire flight from McAllen, TX, to Hous-
ton. I helped her try to find her gate. 
She was going from Houston to Denver. 
I tried to get somebody there to ex-
plain to me and to her—to commu-
nicate—who is going to pick you up 
when you get there, trying to help her 
out. 
She had no clue. She was just going 
to Denver with a 4- or 5-month-old. She 
had no clue about our country, about 
who to meet, who was going to feed 
her, what kind of job she was going to 
have, or what roof was going to be over 
her head. And if that doesn’t shake you 
up, I don’t know what does. 
I love people. I have been in edu-
cation all my life. I love kids. And we 
are doing these people wrong at the 
border. And if we don’t wake up and 
smell the roses, we are going to have 
many, many thousands of deaths on 
our hands. 
We all live in great societies and 
great homes and have money in our 
pocket. We have food to put in our 
mouth, and we take care of our kids. 
You imagine if this country went to 
heck in a hand basket and we had to go 
to Mexico with no money, no ID, no 
clue about their environment or their 
language. How would you make it? 
How would you make a living? How 
would you get by? 
I promise you, the people down there 
could survive a lot better than us be-
cause they have had hard times. We are 
spoiled. We have everything given to us 
because we live in the greatest country 
on the face of the Earth. And I know 
some people are in poverty, but let me 
tell you something, the poorest people 
in our country have it a hundred times 
better than even the middle class in 
some of these other countries—the 
middle class. 
So the Federal Government will not 
enforce these laws, and our State law 
enforcement officers should be empow-
ered in any way possible that they can. 
So my Empowering Law Enforcement 
Act is about common sense. It is about 
giving the right to local and State law 
enforcement officers across this coun-
try to help out the illegals that have 
come in this country—not that we are 
against them. We love everybody in 
this country. 
My God, folks, we have got to help 
them. We have got to help them. And if 
we just turn them out there with no 
sense of security and nobody who can 
help them—law enforcement cannot 
help them, unless it is ICE—they are 
on their own. I can’t imagine. I cannot 
imagine. 
The border has been dominating the 
headlines, but if you talk to a lot of 
people, even in this room, you would 
think that it was a fairytale. We need 
to wake up and smell the roses. Every-
body in this room, whether you are a 
Democrat, Libertarian, Republican—if 
you are an American, we should care 
about this border. 
I am disappointed with our media in 
this country. They act like it is not 
even happening. They will have blood 
on their hands if this continues to hap-
pen. 
We want to help. We want legal im-
migration. We are for people coming. 
We were all, at one point in time, im-
migrants. My gosh, folks, we have to 
wake up. We have to wake up and un-
derstand that we need to help and not 
hurt. If they are coming in, give us an 
opportunity—give us an opportunity to 
help, not just put them on an airplane, 
send them somewhere, and forget about 
them. That is not the way the Amer-
ican people do it. 
There is a high school in Alabama.

that high school, and we were talking 
about certain things, curriculum, and 
finally the superintendent said: Coach, 
when you get to Washington, DC, I 
want you to understand this. We have a 
great school system here. We want to 
help people. We have gone from 20 per-
cent illegal immigrants in our school 
to almost 80 percent in a year and a 
half. Eighty percent. We can’t help 
them. We don’t have enough people 
who speak their language. If you can’t 
communicate, you can’t teach. 
If we are going to do this, if we are 
going to have immigrants in this coun-
try, my gosh, let’s put a plan together 
as a group of people who should care 
and help these people, help them get off 
to a life even half of what maybe we 
might have. That is our job. That is 
our responsibility. God put us on this 
green Earth to help people, not to help 
ourselves. We are all fortunate, but 
there are millions and millions of peo-
ple who are less fortunate than us. 
So as I say today, I want to help the 
people who are coming across the bor-
der. I want to help them. But if we 
don’t have dialogue and we don’t have 
media down there processing what is 
going on to where we can put pressure 
on our public officials all over this 
country, we will not be able to help 
them, and you are going to have people 
dying, and you are going to have people 
who are going to have blood on their 
hands. 
I am one to stand up and say that I 
am willing to do anything in this venue 
to help the people coming across that 
border because it will make us a better 
country, and that is what we need. We 
need a better country because we are a 
country of immigrants. But right now, 
we are a country of spoiled brats is 
what we are. So let’s help. The media 
needs to help. We all need to be on 
board with this. 
I yield my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, a group of 
us chose to filibuster this bill because 
we think it wastes money. We think it 
gives money to one of the most waste-
ful Agencies in government, the Na-
tional Science Foundation. 
Since the early 1970s and since Wil-
liam Proxmire began giving the Golden 
Fleece Award, for 50 years, there has 
been a recurrence of waste from the 
National Science Foundation, from 
NIH, and from even the State Depart-
ment. We discussed earlier some of 
these, and I have a handful more. I 
think the American people should 
know where their money is going to. 
The NIH spent $2 million in research 
to see if using a hot tub can lower 
stress. Really? I think we probably 
could have just agreed to that, but no, 
we had to spend $2 million to study, if 
you are soaking in a hot tub, whether 
that helps to relieve your stress. 
The NIH also spent about $1 million 
to see if they could help people over-
come their fear of dentists. Really? 
NIH spent almost $7 million of cancer 
research money to create an automati-
cally flushing smart toilet. That is 
right—$7 million for an automatically 
flushing toilet. And here is the bonus: 
The toilet will actually take pictures 
of your derriere from the inside of the 
toilet bowl should you wish to have 
those for posterity. Seven million dol-
lars for a smart toilet. How does this 
go on and nobody does anything? Do 
you know what we do? We flush more 
money down this smart toilet. We give 
them more money, and nobody bats an 
eye. 
This is the problem of government. 
Nobody denies the waste. Nobody de-
nies the ridiculous projects that are 
being funded. Yet, year in, year out, it 
continues. 
We need to reform the process. We 
need to have a taxpayer advocate on 
the committee who votes on the 
projects. We need to have somebody 
with a grain of salt who is voting on 
these projects, somebody who says that 
studying whether humans will eat ants 
to curb global warming—whether that 
is a useful expenditure of $3 million, 
studying whether or not humans will 
eat enough ants to keep the globe from 
warming. 
This goes on. The people at home are 
like: How could this happen? How could 
you spend money on this? But it hap-
pens year in, year out, because we 
never vote for less money. It is always 
more. So a group of Senators here 
today are filibustering this bill because 
somebody has to point out that the 
waste and abuse of money goes on. 
The National Science Foundation— 
the king of wasteful spending—spent 
$100,000 to teach social scientists how 
to apply for grants. So it is not bad 
enough that we are just, you know, 
handing out money like it grows on 
trees, but we have to teach people how 
to get more of the free money. 
There actually was another cache of 
money that went to Central American 
countries trying to teach them how to 
get more of our money. Really? We are 
actually teaching foreigners how to 
apply to get grant money from our gov-
ernment that is $28 trillion in the hole. 
We are annually $1 trillion in the 
hole, and the last couple of years, we 
are $3 to $4 trillion because of all these 
COVID bailouts and all of this crazy 
government run amok, and at the same 
time we are $2, $3 trillion in the hole a 
year, we are sending $100,000 to teach 
people how to get more grants. 
The USAID spent $48 million helping 
disconnected Tunisian youth to not 
feel like they are a problem to society, 
to help them cope with modern society. 
Well, look, coping is not easy for young 
people anywhere around the world, but 
I guarantee that $48 million that we 
don’t have, that we have to borrow 
from China to send to Tunisia, is not a 
good expenditure of money; probably 
helps no one; probably enriched some 
contractors 
somewhere; 
somebody 
steals some off the top. There is always 
a little skimming operation. It was 
once estimated that as much as half to 
70 percent of foreign aid was skimmed 
off the top either by corrupt dictators 
in the countries receiving the money or 
simply by graft throughout the govern-
ment that we send the money to. 
Often, the foreign aid money was going 
to countries with people who had dic-
tators for 20, 30, 40 years, and we were 
giving money to dictators. 
The National Science Foundation 
spent $4.6 million to study the connec-
tion between getting drunk and falling 
down. Now, you would think that 
would be obvious. You get drunk, you 
fall down. But, no, we had to go ahead 
and study whether getting drunk and 
falling down was something that hap-
pens. We spent $4 million on, if you get 
drunk, will you fall down? This is in-
sane. 
Not one person—a few of us but not a 
majority will stand up and say: Enough 
is enough. The NSF needs less money, 
not more. 
The NIH spent $36 million to research 
why stress makes hair turn gray. I am 
at the age I need to know that one. I 
mean, why does stress make your hair 
turn gray? Really? Nobody would pay 
for this. If we got 100 assembled Ameri-
cans and said ‘‘Vote on whether or not 
you should spend $36 million studying 
why your hair turns gray,’’ not one ra-
tional, commonsense American would 
vote for this. Yet this Congress is going 
to increase the budget of the National 
Science Foundation by 68 percent. 
The National Science Foundation 
spent $2.5 million to research the ef-
fects of daydreaming. I am not kidding. 
You can’t make this stuff up. So what 
are we going do? Increase their budget 
$29 billion in more money for the Na-
tional Science Foundation. They ought 
to be ashamed. 
One side of the aisle doesn’t give a fig 
how much we are spending, but the 
other side of the aisle—the aisle that I 
reside on on the right—pretends to care 
about the debt, but the majority of 
them will vote for this monstrous bill. 
The National Science Foundation 
used $1.5 million to study how to make 
tomatoes taste better. They spent a lot 
of money. They spent a lot of time. 
They wrote up their report. And this is 
shocking. This is groundbreaking re-
search. They found that if you add 
sugar to tomatoes, they taste better. 
You can’t make this stuff up. But it 
goes on and on and on. 
I am glad to be joined on the floor by 
the Senator from Utah. I will reserve 
the remainder of my time and pass the 
baton. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
S. 1260 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have sig-
nificant concerns with this legislation. 
I have made no ambiguity about that. 
I have been very clear from the outset 
that this bill concerns me, in part be-
cause it involves an attempt by the 
United States of America to compete 
with China but on terms that don’t 
favor us, on a playing field that isn’t

ours, and in areas that play to our 
weaknesses, not our strengths. We 
ought to be playing to our strengths 
and 
not 
our 
weaknesses. 
Unfortu-
nately, this bill does not get it right. 
But separate and apart from my con-
cerns regarding the merits of this legis-
lation, which we will get back to in a 
moment, I want to talk for a moment 
about the procedural concerns that I 
have had. There have been a number of 
people in the Senate arguing over the 
last few hours—some in the Senate 
Chamber, some in the media—that we 
have had a very thorough floor process; 
that this has been regular order at its 
best. 
I appreciate the fact that we have 
had 2 weeks of floor consideration 
time; 2 weeks, that is, on Senate time, 
which is just not 2 actual weeks. It is 
not 2 calendar weeks, not even 2 busi-
ness weeks. It is a shorter subset of 
that. But never mind, it is a good thing 
that we at least had 2 weeks set aside 
to do this on the Senate floor. So that 
is a good thing. 
It is not sufficient, however, to sug-
gest that because we have had hun-
dreds of amendments filed and because 
we have had a number of votes on 
amendments and because a few weeks 
have elapsed since this bill came out of 
committee, that that somehow means 
it is regular order and regular order of 
a sort that we ought to try to rep-
licate. 
You have to remember that regular 
order needs to be evaluated. It needs to 
be measured against several things. In 
other words, a simple resolution desig-
nating National Sofa Care Month prob-
ably need not receive a lot of floor 
time or a lot of opportunities for 
amendments, but the more substantive 
and the more costly, economically or 
otherwise, a particular bill might be, 
the more demanding regular order 
ought to be. 
Regular order is not satisfied, par-
ticularly in a bill like this one that is 
likely to cost $200 billion or more and 
that is 2,000-plus pages long and that 
deals with some very significant geo-
political and economic issues—it is not 
something that you can really call reg-
ular order, when you are addressing a 
bill like that, when you are constantly 
making changes to it. 
We talked last night about the fact 
that this legislation started out in 
committee a few weeks ago. It started 
out in committee where, I believe, it 
was somewhere in the range of 150 to 
200 pages. It came out of committee, 
and it was longer than that; it was a 
few hundred pages. Then, over time, it 
has gotten bigger. It grew to 14- or 1,500 
pages. By yesterday afternoon, it had 
grown an additional 900 pages, and then 
by 10:59 p.m. last night, it grew by a 
few hundred more pages. It is not just 
the addition of an additional page of 
text that triggers more concern. One 
has to understand how the entire piece 
of legislation interacts, how nefarious 
provisions, including the late-breaking 
amendments that we received for the 
first time at 10:59 p.m. last night—how 
those affect everything else. 
Just as importantly, one has to, 
ought to, certainly have the ability to 
communicate to one’s constituents 
what is in the legislation, seeking 
input from them so that any votes can 
be informed by having the voters in-
formed and having them aware of what 
is in the legislation. One cannot make 
very significantly drastic changes to 
legislation in the middle of the night 
and then claim that it is regular order 
and that regular order demands an im-
mediate vote on that measure. 
What I and a number of my col-
leagues have been focused on, as we de-
bated this through the night and start-
ing early this morning when we recon-
vened, has been simple. We just want 
more time before being asked to vote 
on this measure. 
It is not an unreasonable request, 
given that you are dealing with legisla-
tion that is over 2,000 pages long and 
that is likely to cost somewhere in the 
neighborhood of a quarter of a trillion 
dollars. That is a lot of money, and the 
way in which we spend it will undoubt-
edly have profound implications not 
just for years but for decades to come. 
We need to, we ought to, we really 
must endeavor to understand what ex-
actly this is going to do. In order to do 
that, we have to have text, and that 
does, in fact, matter. It is not some-
thing you can easily dismiss as an ar-
gument that says this has been regular 
order because it has been on the Senate 
floor for 2 weeks. When it changes as 
much as this one has, it expands as 
much as this one has, when it is as long 
as this one is and involves this amount 
of money and this many very signifi-
cant far-reaching ramifications, it is 
not unreasonable for us to want more 
time to vote on it, to consider it, to 
seek public input, and to allow the 
American people to know what is in it 
before we cast our votes. It is a simple 
common courtesy that we ought to 
have extended to ourselves automati-
cally, rather than trying to rush to a 
final vote in the dark of night. 
On the merits of the legislation 
itself, it is important to remember that 
we got here because we are at some-
thing of a crossroads with China. We 
have all kinds of potential threats— 
some of them economic in nature, 
some perhaps cultural, some perhaps 
military, and some maybe involve 
cyber security. 
But we have an awkward relationship 
with China, and it is one that we have 
to be focused on. That is why it is not 
a bad thing, in and of itself, that we 
consider legislation to try to deal with 
that. That doesn’t mean that every 
piece of legislation designed to deal 
with the problem is, itself, something 
that must be passed. 
You see, if we are going to try to pass 
something telling the American people 
that what we are passing will lead to a 
better outcome with China and our 
ability to compete with China—if we 
are going to make that argument, then 
we have to be able to back that up. In 
order to be able to back that up, we 
have to put ourselves in a position 
where we can be our best selves, where 
we know we are poised for success. We 
have to consider exactly what kind of 
strategy we are deploying, what kind 
of competitor we want to be. 
The legislation before us—the legis-
lation that has been renamed but start-
ed out and to this moment includes the 
Endless Frontier Act—is something 
that aims to counter China, primarily 
by boosting technology research and 
development. I think it is fair to say 
that is its primary aim. 
This is something that nobody dis-
likes. Nobody dislikes research and de-
velopment. To my knowledge, these are 
good things and, undoubtedly, our abil-
ity to compete with China will depend 
on the nature and extent of our invest-
ments in research and development. 
But that does beg the question, What 
is the best kind of research and devel-
opment? Is it best when it follows 
from, and is directed by, it could be 
modified along the way as a result of 
self-interest, rightly understood—en-
lightened self-interest—free markets, 
the decisions of individuals who have 
something at stake or is it best when 
government acts, when government di-
rects it, when it is done by Federal bu-
reaucrats instead of innovators, tech-
nology experts, and people who have 
something that belongs to them—an 
idea, an ability to make something— 
people who actually know how to see 
their ideas all the way through to the 
end and are willing to make the nec-
essary sacrifices along the way to see 
to its success? 
You see, when you start to confuse 
government research and development 
with actual research and develop-
ment—that is private nongovernmental 
research and development—you run 
into some problems. 
Some of this, I think, perhaps stems 
from a misapprehension, a misunder-
standing of the nature of government 
itself and the capabilities of govern-
ment in any system to do things. 
We have to remember that govern-
ment, ultimately, is best understood as 
the official use of coercive force. That 
is what government is. It is force— 
force with the perimeter of official au-
thority, force and taxation backed up 
by force. That is what government is. 
I don’t mean to say that in a 
dismissive way. We need government. 
Government 
can’t 
operate 
without 
force. It can’t collect taxes without 
force. It can’t enforce laws without 
force. We need government for that 
reason—to make sure, first and fore-
most, that we don’t hurt each other, 
that we aren’t harmed by outside ag-
gressors who would harm us, and that 
we don’t take that which doesn’t be-
long to us. We need governments to do 
that. Only governments can do that. 
That is why we have governments.

States of America, who influenced the 
documents, including the Declaration 
of Independence and the Constitution 
of the United States, those who influ-
enced the waging of America’s Revolu-
tionary War understood that, at a fun-
damental level, the purpose of govern-
ment is to protect life and liberty and 
property. 
You see, if we left individuals to do 
that on their own, they might be able 
to do that, but human flourishing real-
ly 
wouldn’t 
occur 
in 
that 
cir-
cumstance. If everyone had to be the 
law for him or herself, human nour-
ishing wouldn’t occur. When govern-
ment exists, it frees people. It frees 
them, not just because freedom sounds 
great in the abstract or because it is 
fun to yell at a rally or it looks good 
on a bumper sticker, but we like free-
dom because of the things that free 
people do when they are allowed to be 
free, when they are able to come to-
gether and form what I refer to as the 
‘‘twin 
pillars’’ 
of 
American 
exceptionalism. In fact, I would go so 
far as to call them the twin pillars of 
any thriving human civilization. Those 
twin pillars are free markets and vol-
untary institutions of civil society. 
When you have robust free markets 
and voluntary institutions of civil soci-
ety, human beings do better. They 
can’t, of course, function in a state of 
anarchy nor can they function in the 
absence of a government because that 
always involves anarchy necessarily. 
But when there is government and 
that government properly understands 
its role of protecting life, liberty, and 
property, it is freeing and liberating, 
and human beings in that setting can 
do amazing things. It is what has led to 
the development of the greatest civili-
zation of the strongest economy the 
world has ever known. It is what has 
led more people out of poverty than 
any government program ever can, 
ever could, ever has, or ever will. 
When we lose sight of what govern-
ment is, when we start to forget that 
government is just force and taxation 
backed up by the use of force, it can 
easily be manipulated for nefarious 
ends. It is not that government is bad. 
Government isn’t inherently good or 
evil. Government consists of that prin-
ciple of force backed up with the legit-
imacy of the imprimatur of the State 
or, in our case, a union of States. 
It is that force that is necessary. 
That same force that is necessary can 
become destructive of the very ends 
that it was created in order to uphold 
and protect and defend, so we can’t lose 
sight of it. We can’t lose sight of the 
fact that government is neither inher-
ently good nor inherently evil. Govern-
ment doesn’t have eyes to see you. It 
doesn’t have arms to embrace you. It 
doesn’t have a heart with which to love 
you. It is neither omnipotent nor omni-
scient, not all-knowing, not all-power-
ful. It just is force and taxation backed 
up by force. 
So the further afield you take gov-
ernment authority and you take it 
away from the protection of life, lib-
erty, and property, quite ironically and 
very tragically, it can become destruc-
tive of the very ends that it was cre-
ated to serve. 
One of the ways in which we see this 
manifest from time to time is when 
people will harness the immense power 
of government and the immense finan-
cial resources that can be accumulated 
by a government through the power of 
taxation backed up by force for their 
own political ends—even worse, for 
their own economic ends. When you see 
people’s political ends marrying up 
with the financial interests of those 
who want to capitalize off of govern-
ment itself, bad things can happen. 
Ultimately, the American people be-
come poorer as a result of government 
action; that is, every dollar that we 
spend is a dollar that won’t otherwise 
be spent—could otherwise be spent in 
the free market doing good, resulting 
in everything from charitable con-
tributions to job creation, and many, 
many other things that support our 
ability to be free and prosperous as a 
nation. 
China, importantly, doesn’t quite see 
it this way. They didn’t get the memo. 
They are not steeped in Hobbes, Locke, 
Montesquieu. They are not steeped in 
the stories that we know about our 
American Revolution. 
They weren’t raised understanding 
that their country became a country as 
a result of their conscious choice to de-
part from a mother country after that 
mother country had proven itself to be 
menacing, had proven itself to be a 
government that was taxing them too 
much, regulating them too aggres-
sively, sending them off to war, then 
making them pay for those wars, all 
without allowing them fair representa-
tion within that system of government. 
They weren’t steeped in that. 
They were steeped in different tradi-
tions, and they have chosen a very dif-
ferent set of paths. They have, essen-
tially, a command-and-control econ-
omy. That is what a country that is 
run by a Communist Party does; it 
commands and it controls. It is a very 
different mindset. 
It is a mindset that focuses not on 
free markets and civil society. In that 
kind of system, in a system run by a 
Communist Party, with a command- 
and-control economy, the state is ev-
erything. The government is imbued 
culturally with almost a sense of rev-
erence, entitled to deference. People 
assume—or they are at least asked to 
assume, and many are forced to play 
along with the assumption—that it has 
a degree of omniscience, omnipotence, 
and always the best interests of the 
people; the ability to foresee and pre-
pare for the future and use the im-
mense force of government to bring 
about their aims. In every single re-
spect, the Chinese regime grows and 
centralizes the power of government al-
ways at the expense of free markets 
and free citizens. This is an experiment 
that has expanded into dangerous and 
even deadly territory. 
Let’s just consider, for a moment, 
China’s record on human rights. China 
has gone so far as to enslave and sub-
ject the Tibetan and Uighur people into 
forced labor, reeducation, and torture. 
Under China’s infamous one-child 
policy, it has brutally and barbarically 
forced families to undergo IUD implan-
tation, sterilization, and abortion. 
China, of course, has a long, dark his-
tory of religious persecution and of si-
lencing 
dissidents 
of 
every 
stripe. 
Under President Xi Jinping, Chinese 
authorities have detained millions of 
Muslims and arrested thousands of 
Christians. They have seized control of 
Tibetan monasteries and closed or de-
molished dozens of Buddhist and Taoist 
temples. 
You see, the destruction of sacred 
places not built by the government, 
not designed by the government seems 
to be a hallmark characteristic of 
Communist systems because sacred 
places must be for the betterment of 
the government, and if they are not, 
Communist regimes don’t like them 
and often do everything they can to de-
stroy them and the communities that 
formed them. They have even practiced 
forced organ harvesting of members of 
the Falun Gong religion. 
Or consider China’s actions in the 
realm of foreign policy. In true impe-
rialist form, it is pushing its Belt and 
Road Initiative—a massive, predatory 
infrastructure project, stretching from 
East Asia to Europe, designed to mas-
sively expand its coercive economic 
and political influence. 
It has spread Confucius Institutes 
across American campuses, entangling 
American universities with Chinese 
state policies, and turning them into 
megaphones for Chinese propaganda. 
In multilateral organizations, China 
continuously undermines longstanding 
democratic norms, instituting policies 
that, instead, benefit the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s authoritarian values. It 
has also held a tight cronyist, com-
mand-and-control grip over its econ-
omy, heavily subsidizing industries 
with money that it has taken through 
its power of taxation, backed up by its 
use of force, ultimately picking win-
ners and losers, which tend to be more 
reflective of those close to leadership 
within the Chinese Communist Party 
than those who build a better product 
or work better to serve their fellow 
beings. 
While China has picked up some 
steam through these actions, we must 
not—we can’t ever—ignore that what-
ever momentum it may have acquired 
is of dubious success and doubtful sus-
tainability over the long run. China, 
under the control of the Chinese Com-
munist Party, has, in reality, one of 
the least efficient economies in the 
world. In terms of GDP per capita, it is 
not at the top of the heap. In fact, one 
could say that it is very close to the 
bottom of the heap, next to Cuba and 
Kazakhstan. 
It turns out that political corruption 
and state-owned enterprises come with

some financial dead weight too. Now, 
the financial costs alone of enslaving, 
sterilizing, and brainwashing 12.8 mil-
lion 
Uighurs 
and 
other 
oppressed 
groups is steep, even as the human cost 
of this indefensible moral depravity is 
far worse and infinitely steeper. 
Of course, killing future generations’ 
potential through abortion is also as 
foolish as it is inhumane. As a result of 
its decades-long abortion and one-child 
or two-child policy, China is on track 
to lose a third of its workforce—a 
third—and age out faster than any so-
ciety in modern history. The ratio of 
workers to retirees in China, which is 
currently 8 to 1, is projected to whittle 
down to just 2 to 1 in the coming dec-
ades, with only two employees for 
every retiree. China’s pension system, 
which is already showing very signifi-
cant signs of buckling, will inevitably 
crack under pressure. 
Now, it is true that China is aggres-
sive, and it is true that China is really 
big, but it is not ironclad in its posi-
tion of global strength. As its popu-
lation ages more and more and as more 
of its land falls into wasted, polluted 
squalor, it will have neither the inhab-
itants nor the resources to continue on 
its current course. 
There is nothing about China’s prin-
ciples or China’s trajectory that we 
should seek to emulate—no, not in the 
slightest. In nearly every single way, 
the Chinese regime consolidates power 
to trample over the rights of men and 
women and quash free expression, the 
free exercise of religion, and free enter-
prise. 
All of us in America who know of our 
own struggles know of the bad things 
that can happen when human beings 
and governments combine to take undo 
advantage of difficult circumstances of 
minorities, whether racial, ethnic, in 
language, religious, or otherwise. Bad 
things happen. China has not only al-
lowed bad things to happen; it has 
made them happen. It has directed that 
they happen. It has been the reason 
that they happen. 
Nothing could be more antithetical 
to the American system of government 
or to the American way of life or to our 
values. In fact, it is just the opposite 
formula that has made us the greatest 
civilization the world has ever known, 
with the strongest economy, with the 
greatest opportunities, with immense, 
upward economic mobility. This is 
uniquely a land in which someone can 
be born into poverty and, in most cir-
cumstances, carry the reasonable hope 
and expectation that, if one works 
hard, one day, one can retire com-
fortably. 
The Founders gave us a Constitution 
precisely to disperse and limit the 
power of the Federal Government and 
to keep the power in government as 
close and accountable to the people as 
possible. We focus on this, and we focus 
on principles of freedom and of liberty, 
not just because they sound nice. We 
do these things because it is how 
human beings thrive. We do these 
things because it is the best way to 
protect life and liberty and property. 
We do these things because it is the 
only way to allow for upward economic 
mobility and the thriving of the human 
condition. 
We should continue to double down 
on those things. We should continue to 
make sure that our markets are free 
and that our institutions of civil soci-
ety are voluntary and robust. We do 
that not by expanding government but 
by allowing human beings to do what 
they do best and by allowing them to 
be free.

upon the table and the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-

tion of Calendar No. 134, the Senate re-
sume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to use leader re-
marks and that Senators KLOBUCHAR 
and PETERS be permitted to speak for 
up to 2 minutes each before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
let me just tell the public and the 
Members what this does. It is some-
thing we proposed. It assures that 
there is a vote on the January 6 Com-
mission in the next hour. It assures 
that the vote occurs in the light of day, 
not at 3 in the morning. 
It also assures that votes on the U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act will 
occur and prevail as soon as we return 
in June. 
This is a good solution because we 
get to vote on the Commission. 
And let me just say this to my Re-
publican colleagues and to the country: 
This Commission is desperately need-
ed. What has been perpetrated by 
President Trump over the last several 
months is the Big Lie—the Big Lie that 
the elections were fixed, that he is 
rightfully President. 
Nothing is more corrosive to our de-
mocracy than a view that elections are 
not on the level. Yet that has been 
propagated by Donald Trump and many 
of his allies. 
A Commission can get to the bottom 
of this in a clear way. It is a bipartisan 
Commission. It is a down-the-middle 
Commission. There was significant Re-
publican input by the Republican lead-
er in the House and the Republican 
ranking member of the relevant com-
mittee. 
So this is right down the middle. If 
our Republican friends vote against 
this, I would ask them: What are you 
afraid of? The truth? Are you afraid 
that Donald Trump’s Big Lie will be 
dispelled? Are you afraid that all of the 
misinformation that has poured out 
will be rebutted by a bipartisan, down- 
the-middle Commission? 
This is about a democracy. It is 
about the future of our democracy. The 
Big Lie has eroded that democracy, and 
we must do everything we can to rebut 
it. This is not a Democratic or Repub-
lican obligation. This is an American 
obligation. 
Our democracy—our beautiful, more 
than-two-century-old democracy is at 
more risk because of the lies that have 
been perpetrated by President Trump 
and his allies than it has been in a very 
long time, and this Commission is a 
great antidote to that. 
So I hope we can get broad support 
and move forward. I will speak more 
after the vote on this issue. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as 
chair of the Rules Committee, I im-
plore my colleagues to vote for this 
Commission. 
On January 6, we all walked over 
that broken glass. We all saw the spray 
paint on the wall. We all stood huddled 
together in shelter, and most of us— 
most of us, the vast majority of us, 
Democrats and Republicans—voted to 
uphold our democracy that night late 
into the evening. 
But it doesn’t end there. I give to you 
the 
words 
of 
slain 
officer 
Brian 
Sicknick’s 
mother. 
An 
ordinary 
woman, who never has been involved in 
politics, she is now forced to do ex-
traordinary things and lobby Members 
of this body to simply get to the truth. 
She said this: ‘‘Not having a January 6 
Commission to look into exactly what 
occurred is a slap in the faces of all the 
officers who did their jobs that day.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3927 
May 28, 2021 
For months, national security ex-
perts have called for a bipartisan Com-
mission. Yesterday, the Department of 
Homeland Security former Secretaries 
from the Bush and Obama administra-
tions—Chertoff, 
Ridge, 
Napolitano, 
Johnson—all called for this Commis-
sion. 
This Commission is modeled exactly 
after the gold standard of investiga-
tions and recommendations—the 9/11 
Commission. It is modeled in the words 
of how the staff is chosen. It is modeled 
in the words of getting to the bottom 
of something and getting something 
done. 
But yet, so many of our colleagues, 
sadly, on the other side of the aisle are 
refusing to move on this. 
Colleagues, we owe it to the heroic 
Capitol Police, to the first responders, 
to the staff members who sat in closets 
for hours and hours and hours, to the 
police officer who was called the ‘‘n’’ 
word 15 times and then sat in the Ro-
tunda and looked at another officer 
and said: Is this America? We owe it to 
them that put themselves in harm’s 
way to protect the Capitol and the sa-
cred democratic process. Inaction is 
not an option. 
And, no, the report we are doing that 
I am so proud of, with Senator PETERS 
and Senator PORTMAN
and Senator 
BLUNT, which will come out shortly, is 
about an immediate response and bills 
we have to pass and things we have to 
do and mistakes that were made. It is 
an important report, and we are proud 
of our work, but it is no substitute for 
an 9/11-style Commission, and I implore 
our colleagues to vote with us to get 
this done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, the Jan-
uary 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol re-
mains a dark stain on our Nation’s his-
tory. Americans deserve to have all of 
the facts about that day, and a fair, 
balanced, and independent Commission 
will give us those answers. 
This Commission would complement 
the current investigations into this 
deadly attack, including my Homeland 
Security Committee’s own investiga-
tions in conjunction with the Rules 
Committee. 
After the devastating September 11 
terrorist attacks, Congress came to-
gether to create a bipartisan inde-
pendent Commission. January 6 marks 
a singular event in our Nation’s his-
tory, similar to what we experienced 
on 9/11, and there is simply no logical 
reason to oppose its creation. 
The brave law enforcement officers 
who stopped this attack and every 
American who watched in realtime as 
our free and fair democratic process 
was attacked deserve answers and ac-
countability for the actions that oc-
curred on January 6. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
Commission and get the American peo-
ple the answers that they deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion,

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to consider 
the following nomination, which the 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Anton George 
Hajjar, of Maryland, to be a Governor 
of the United States Postal Service for 
a term expiring December 8, 2023. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the cloture motion 
is withdrawn. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the nomination. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to support the nomination 
of Anton Hajjar to serve on the Board 
of Governors of the United States Post-
al Service. Mr. Hajjar is highly quali-
fied for this position, and his experi-
ence with postal unions and legal ex-
pertise provides him with the knowl-
edge and skills required of this role. If 
confirmed, I am confident that he will 
serve our country well as a member of 
the USPS Board. 
Mr. Hajjar was raised in a working 
class Brooklyn family and worked as a 
summer 
letter 
carrier, 
where 
he 
learned the ins and outs of mail deliv-
ery in his local community. He worked 
hard in school and became the first in 
his family to graduate from college, re-
ceiving his bachelor’s degree from 
Fordham University. Before attending 
Tulane Law School, he worked as a 
janitor, hospital attendant, U.S. Mer-
chant Marine seaman, taxi driver, and 
U.S. Custom inspector. 
These experiences, along with his up-
bringing, inspired him to use his law 
degree to stand up for workers, and he 
went on to serve as the general counsel 
for 
the 
American 
Postal 
Workers 
Union. His long history with APWU ex-
posed him to a wide array of postal reg-
ulatory and legal issues and provided 
him with important insight into the 
postal workforce.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3928 
May 28, 2021 
Throughout his career, Mr. Hajjar 
has also demonstrated an abiding com-
mitment to public service. He has 
worked pro-bono to represent Arab and 
Muslim Americans in discrimination 
cases. He volunteers regularly to serve 
his community in Chevy Chase, MD, in-
cluding as a member of his church and 
as an election judge. 
His skills and his leadership make 
him right for this role, but the chal-
lenges before him are great. Through-
out the tenure of the current Post-
master General, who was installed by 
the Board of Governors during the pre-
vious administration, I have heard 
from constituents about unacceptable 
delays and disruptions in mail service. 
Medication shipments have gone miss-
ing, some small businesses cannot get 
their products to customers, and many 
customers are getting hit with late fees 
for bill payments that didn’t arrive on 
time because of mail delivery delays. 
Despite 
unprecedented 
challenges, 
the men and women of the USPS have 
worked tirelessly to deliver the mail. 
We have seen an incredible outpouring 
of support for postal workers and the 
USPS from the American people. But 
the Board of Governors must restore 
the public’s trust and confidence in the 
Postal Service. Mr. Hajjar is the right 
person to help do just that, and I am 
confident he will be a key player in 
tackling the Postal Service’s current 
challenges and ensuring that Ameri-
cans can count on a reliable and sus-
tainable Postal Service for decades to 
come. I am proud to support his nomi-
nation and urge my colleagues to vote 
for his confirmation.

OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and

of Massachusetts, to be Director of the

icy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3929 
May 28, 2021 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
have a brief statement on the vote on 
the January 6 Commission. 
My colleagues, this was a case of 
good news and bad news about the Re-
publican Party in the Senate. 
The good news: Republicans worked 
with Democrats on comprehensive leg-
islation to strengthen our commitment 
to scientific research, which will pass 
the Senate when the Senate resumes 
session. 
The bad news: The Republican minor-
ity just mounted a partisan filibuster 
against an independent Commission to 
report on January 6. Both efforts 
should have moved forward solidly in a 
bipartisan way, but out of fear or fe-
alty to Donald Trump, the Republican 
minority just prevented the American 
people from getting the full truth 
about January 6. The Republican mi-
nority just prevented the Senate from 
even debating the bill—no opportunity 
for amendments, no opportunity for de-
bate. 
There was an attempt by the Repub-
lican minority to shunt this vote into 
the dark of night, but because of to-
day’s Senate time agreement, it was 
done in broad daylight. The American 
people will see how each Republican 
Senator voted. 
This should have been simple. The 
Commission 
was 
bipartisan, 
inde-
pendent, straight down the middle. 
House 
Democrats 
accepted 
every 
change 
that 
House 
leadership 
re-
quested. Speaker PELOSI
and I sup-
ported and still do support the changes 
Senator COLLINS proposed, and we told 
that to other Senators. 
Senate Republicans, for months, pub-
licly supported the idea of a Commis-
sion, but now, all of a sudden, the Sen-
ate minority and the Senate minority 
leader 
waged 
a 
partisan 
filibuster 
against the bill. 
This vote has made it official: Donald 
Trump’s Big Lie has now fully envel-
oped the Republican Party. Trump’s 
Big Lie is now the defining principle of 
what was once the party of Lincoln. 
House Republicans canned Congress-
woman CHENEY for the crime of telling 
the truth that Joe Biden is President. 
Republican State legislatures seizing 
on the Big Lie are conducting the 
greatest assault on voting rights since 
the beginning of Jim Crow. Repub-
licans in both Chambers are trying to 
rewrite history and claim that January 
6 was just a peaceful protest that got a 
little out of hand. And now this—a par-
tisan blockade of a simple, inde-
pendent, bipartisan Commission. 
I have heard all the excuses why Re-
publicans are opposing this bill: It is 
too early. It goes on too long. It is not 
needed. Almost all of these excuses are 
meritless and were invented in the past 
2 weeks. 
We all know what is going on here. 
Senate Republicans chose to defend the 
Big Lie because they believe anything 
that might upset Donald Trump could 
hurt them politically. 
We all lived through the horrors of 
January 6. I was no farther than 30 feet 
from those White Supremacist hooli-
gans. Do my Republican colleagues re-
member that day? Do my Republican 
colleagues remember the savage mob 
calling for the execution of Mike 
Pence, the makeshift gallows outside 
the Capitol, men with bulletproof vests 
and zip ties breaking into the Senate 
Gallery and rifling through your desks, 
and police officers crushed between 
doorways? Shame on the Republican 
Party for trying to sweep the horrors 
of that day under the rug because they 
are afraid of Donald Trump. 
Our democracy has long endured be-
cause leaders of good faith, even if they 
disagreed, 
even 
at 
political 
costs, 
shared a fidelity to the truth. That is 
not so today. 
I hope this is not the beginning of an 
effort by Senate Republicans to pre-
vent this Chamber from debating rea-
sonable, commonsense legislation. We 
will soon see. 
After the State work period, I will 
bring forward legislation that would

our Republican colleagues let the Sen-
ate debate the bill, or will they engage 
in another partisan filibuster of urgent 
legislation? We will soon see. 
Madam President, I have a lot of 
pages here, a lot of business to con-
duct.

to, and that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2108) to the pre-
amble was agreed to as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the preamble) 
In the preamble, strike the 18th whereas 
clause and insert ‘‘Whereas modernization of 
the MKARNS will empower future economic 
development, promote freight mobility, and 
expand agricultural exports and the move-
ment of iron and steel products, while reliev-
ing congestion on our roads and bridges;’’. 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The resolution (S. Res. 195), with its 
preamble, as amended, was agreed to as 
follows 
S. RES. 195 
Whereas June 5, 2021, marks the 50th anni-
versary of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas 
River Navigation System (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘MKARNS’’); 
Whereas, in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 
1946 (Public Law 79–525), Congress authorized 
the Army Corps of Engineers (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Corps’’) to undertake com-
prehensive improvements on the Arkansas 
and Verdigris Rivers, which served as the 
foundation of the MKARNS; 
Whereas the MKARNS opened for full use 
in December 1970, which, after over 20 years 
and $1,200,000,000, was the largest civil works 
project undertaken by the Corps at the time; 
Whereas President Richard M. Nixon offi-
cially dedicated the MKARNS on June 5, 
1971, at a ceremony at the Tulsa Port of 
Catoosa, Oklahoma; 
Whereas the MKARNS is named for United 
States Senator John L. McClellan of Arkan-
sas and former Oklahoma Governor and 
United States Senator Robert S. Kerr of 
Oklahoma, who advocated for the creation of 
an expansive, inland waterway system; 
Whereas the MKARNS is 445 river miles 
long, with 18 locks and dams, spans from 
Catoosa, Oklahoma, to the Mississippi River, 
and serves commerce from a 12-State region 
consisting of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, 
Texas, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Min-
nesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Mis-
souri, and Idaho; 
Whereas 
the 
MKARNS 
provides 
year- 
round, accessible inland waterway transpor-
tation to 5 public ports, 50 private port ter-
minals, and over 90 industries; 
Whereas, on an annual basis, the MKARNS 
provides for $8,500,000,000 in sales impacts, 
$1,600,000,000 in transportation cost savings, 
and $289,000,000 in business taxes; 
Whereas the MKARNS contributes to 56,000 
full- and part-time jobs, and 20 percent of all 
jobs in the United States are linked to wa-
terborne commerce supported by the inland 
waterway system; 
Whereas, on average, 11,000,000 tons of com-
modities 
with 
a 
value 
upwards 
of 
$4,000,000,000 travels on the MKARNS annu-
ally, with sand, gravel, rock, chemical fer-
tilizer, iron, and steel accounting for nearly 
60 percent of all waterborne commerce; 
Whereas there are 4 designated Foreign- 
Trade Zones along the navigation system at 
the public ports at Catoosa, Muskogee, Lit-
tle Rock, and Pine Bluff; 
Whereas the MKARNS allows for the low-
est-cost and most environmentally friendly 
method of moving goods, with 1 barge trans-
porting the equivalent of 15 jumbo railcars 
and 60 large semi-trailers; 
Whereas, in 2015, the Corps upgraded the 
classification of the MKARNS from ‘‘Con-
nector’’ to ‘‘Corridor’’ on the National Ma-
rine Highway, designated the MKARNS as a 
high-use waterway system, and labeled the 
MKARNS as Marine Highway 40; 
Whereas Congress authorized multiple uses 
for the MKARNS, including navigation, flood 
control, hydropower, recreation, water sup-
ply, and wildlife conservation; 
Whereas, through the end of 2020, Arkansas 
River 
Basin 
projects, 
including 
the 
MKARNS, are estimated to have cumula-
tively prevented nearly $16,000,000,000 in 
flood damages in the Arkansas River Basin 
region; 
Whereas there are 15 hydropower plants on 
the MKARNS which provide low-cost power 
to 7,000,000 people and produce 2,500,000 kilo- 
watt-hours per year; 
Whereas inland waterways provide many 
recreational opportunities, such as fishing, 
boating, and hiking, and over 4,000 rec-
reational vessels lock through the MKARNS 
and 5,400,000 people visit Corps-operated 
recreation areas along the MKARNS annu-
ally; 
Whereas modernization of the MKARNS 
will empower future economic development, 
promote freight mobility, and expand agri-
cultural exports and the movement of iron 
and steel products, while relieving conges-
tion on our roads and bridges; 
Whereas the increased backlog in critical 
maintenance causes the economic uncer-
tainty of complete navigation disruption on 
the MKARNS, which would cost beneficiaries 
up to $2,000,000 per day; 
Whereas Congress authorized the MKARNS 
to be deepened to 12 feet in 2003, and approxi-
mately 90 percent of the MKARNS is already 
12-feet deep; 
Whereas the capacity of each barge could 
be increased by 200 tons for each additional 
foot of draft, increasing the overall freight 
capacity of the MKARNS by 40 percent and 
resulting in over $250,000,000 in increased 
business sales annually; and 
Whereas Oklahoma, Arkansas, the sur-
rounding region, and the entire Nation have 
benefitted, and will continue to benefit, 
greatly from the MKARNS: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors 2021 as the 50th anniversary of 
the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Naviga-
tion System; 
(2) recognizes that investments in inland 
waterway navigation infrastructure are an 
investment in the long-term strength and se-
curity of the United States economy; and 
(3) commits to completing the deepening of 
the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Naviga-
tion System from 9 feet to 12 feet.

ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 61, S. 921. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 921) to amend title 18, United 
States Code, to further protect officers and 
employees of the United States, and for 
other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on the Judiciary, with an amendment 
to strike all after the enacting clause 
and insert the part printed in italic, as 
follows 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Jaime Zapata 
and Victor Avila Federal Officers and Employ-
ees Protection Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) since the founding of the Nation, officers 
and employees of the United States Government 
have dutifully and faithfully served the United 
States overseas, including in situations that 
place them at serious risk of death or bodily 
harm, in order to preserve, protect, and defend 
the interests of the United States; 
(2) securing the safety of such officers and 
employees while serving overseas is of para-
mount importance and is also in furtherance of 
preserving, protecting, and defending the inter-
ests of the United States; 
(3) Federal courts, including the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3931 
May 28, 2021 
Circuit, and the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Eleventh Circuit, have correctly inter-
preted section 1114 of title 18, United States 
Code, to apply extraterritorially to protect offi-
cers and employees of the United States while 
the officers and employees are serving abroad; 
(4) in a case involving a violent attack against 
Federal law enforcement officers Jaime Zapata 
and Victor Avila, a panel of a Federal court of 
appeals held that section 1114 of title 18, United 
States Code, does not apply extraterritorially, 
creating a split among the United States circuit 
courts of appeals; 
(5) in light of the opinion described in para-
graph (4), it has become necessary for Congress 
to clarify the original intent that section 1114 of 
title 
18, 
United 
States 
Code, 
applies 
extraterritorially; and 
(6) it is further appropriate to clarify the 
original intent that sections 111 and 115 of title 
18, United States Code, apply extraterritorially 
as well. 
SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOY-
EES OF THE UNITED STATES. 
Part I of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended— 
(1) in section 111, by adding at the end the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(c) EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION.—There 
is extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct 
prohibited by this section.’’; 
(2) in section 115, by adding at the end the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(e) There is extraterritorial jurisdiction over 
the conduct prohibited by this section.’’; and 
(3) in section 1114— 
(A) by inserting ‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—’’ before 
‘‘Whoever’’; and 
(B) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(b) EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION.—There 
is extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct 
prohibited by this section.’’. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
further ask that the committee-re-
ported substitute amendment be agreed

objection, it is so ordered.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH ‘‘IZZY’’ 
MCKINNEY 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
am proud to recognize Elizabeth ‘‘Izzy’’ 
McKinney of Londonderry as May’s 
Granite Stater of the Month. A nurse 
and mother of two young children, Lily 
and Bryant, Izzy is using poetry, illus-
trations, and her personal experiences 
to bring much # needed attention to 
neurodivergent conditions in children. 
When her daughter, Lily, was a tod-
dler, she would flap her arms when she 
got excited. Izzy and her husband 
thought nothing of it at first, since 
Izzy also used to flap her arms when 
she was a child. 
It was not until Lily started kinder-
garten that Izzy and her husband real-
ized 
that 
Lily’s 
arm-flapping 
was 
unique. Flapping is a type of self-stim-
ulatory behavior that is common in 
children with neurodivergence and can 
help them alleviate feelings of sensory 
overload. 
For a school project that encouraged 
students to highlight what makes them 
special, Izzy encouraged her daughter 
to find things about her that stood out 
from her peers. 
While thinking about her daughter’s 
project, Izzy decided to write her own 
poem about her daughter’s unique 
physical behavior to demonstrate to 
Lily that it is okay to be different from 
friends and classmates, that everyone 
has unique attributes. 
Eventually, Izzy expanded the poem 
into a children’s book called ‘‘What 
Makes Me Special.’’ All the proceeds 
for the book go toward the High Hopes 
Foundation of New Hampshire, a non-
profit that provides life-enhancing ex-
periences for children with chronic 
conditions. 
Later, after Izzy’s second child, Bry-
ant, was born, Izzy wrote another chil-
dren’s book, this time focused on her 
son’s neurodivergence, dyspraxia. This 
book is titled ‘‘My Buddy Bryant: A 
Story of Friendship and Dyspraxia’’ 
and encourages children to embrace 
each other’s differences. All the pro-
ceeds for this book go toward the 
Dyspraxia 
Foundation 
USA, 
which 
seeks to educate the public about 
dyspraxia and provide support and re-
sources to families. Izzy also runs her 
own blog, flappingoodtale.com, about 
her experience parenting two children 
who are neurodivergent. 
Izzy embodies the best of our State 
by destigmatizing neurdivergence and 
promoting acceptance and inclusion. 
Her books provide a fun avenue to help 
children and adults understand that in-
cluding people who experience physical 
or behavioral differences or disabilities 
can strengthen our families, our com-
mittees, our State, and our country. I 
wish Izzy all the best as she continues 
this important work.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 255—DESIG-
NATING 
MAY 
2021 
AS 
‘‘ALS 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. 
BRAUN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 255 
Whereas amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘ALS’’) is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disease that 
affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal 
cord; 
Whereas the life expectancy for an indi-
vidual with ALS is between 2 and 5 years 
after the date on which the individual re-
ceives an ALS diagnosis; 
Whereas ALS occurs throughout the world 
with no racial, ethnic, gender, or socio-
economic boundaries; 
Whereas ALS may affect any individual in 
any location; 
Whereas the cause of ALS is unknown in 
up to 90 percent of cases; 
Whereas approximately 10 percent of cases 
have a strong known genetic driver; 
Whereas, on average, the period between 
the date on which an individual first experi-
ences symptoms of ALS and the date on 
which the individual is diagnosed with ALS 
is more than 1 year; 
Whereas the onset of ALS often involves 
muscle weakness or stiffness, and the pro-
gression of ALS results in the further weak-
ening, wasting, and paralysis of— 
(1) the muscles of the limbs and trunk; and 
(2) the muscles that control vital func-
tions, such as speech, swallowing, and 
breathing;

May 28, 2021 
Whereas ALS can strike individuals of any 
age, but it predominantly strikes adults; 
Whereas it is estimated that tens of thou-
sands of individuals in the United States 
have ALS at any given time; 
Whereas, based on studies of the popu-
lation of the United States, slightly more 
than 5,600 individuals in the United States 
are diagnosed with ALS each year, and 15 in-
dividuals in the United States are diagnosed 
with ALS each day; 
Whereas, between 2015 and 2040, the number 
of ALS cases around the world is expected to 
increase by nearly 70 percent; 
Whereas the majority of individuals with 
ALS die of respiratory failure; 
Whereas, in the United States, military 
veterans may be up to twice as likely to be 
diagnosed with ALS than the general public; 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of 
this resolution, there is no cure for ALS; 
Whereas the spouses, children, and family 
members of individuals living with ALS pro-
vide support to those individuals with love, 
day-to-day care, and more; and 
Whereas an individual with ALS, and the 
caregivers of such an individual, can be re-
quired to bear significant costs for medical 
care, equipment, and home care services for 
the individual as the disease progresses: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 2021 as ‘‘ALS Awareness 
Month’’; 
(2) affirms the dedication of the Senate 
to— 
(A) ensuring individuals with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (referred to in this resolving 
clause as ‘‘ALS’’) have access to effective 
treatments as soon as possible; 
(B) identifying risk factors and causes of 
ALS to prevent new cases; 
(C) empowering individuals with ALS to 
engage with the world in the way they want; 
(D) reducing the physical, emotional, and 
financial burdens of living with ALS; and 
(E) ensuring all individuals with ALS and 
their caregivers receive high quality services 
and supports that benefit them; and 
(3) commends the dedication of the family 
members, friends, organizations, volunteers, 
researchers, and caregivers across the United 
States that are working to improve the qual-
ity and length of life of ALS patients and the 
development of treatments and cures that 
reach patients as soon as possible.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
256—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE REGARDING THE NEED 
TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE 
INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE 
THE ORIGINS OF COVID–19 
Mr. MARSHALL (for himself and 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 256 
Whereas COVID–19 has taken the lives of 
nearly 3,500,000 individuals around the world; 
Whereas understanding the origins of the 
COVID–19 pandemic is essential to address-
ing our vulnerabilities and preventing future 
crises; 
Whereas, in May 2020, the World Health As-
sembly did not authorize a comprehensive 
investigation into the origins of COVID–19, 
and instead passed a significantly limited 
compromise resolution, with Chinese govern-
ment support, which did not explicitly in-
clude in its scope the possibility of a re-
search-related accident; 
Whereas the 2020 World Health Assembly 
resolution and its terms of reference, which 
were negotiated privately between the World 
Health Organization (in this preamble re-
ferred to as ‘‘WHO’’) and Chinese authorities, 
handed the Chinese government control over 
the joint-study process by giving the Chinese 
government veto power over which inter-
national experts were allowed to participate 
in the joint study and by agreeing that most 
primary research would be carried out by 
Chinese teams without ensuring broad access 
to primary data by international experts; 
Whereas, as a result of these terms, the 
significant structural, procedural, and ana-
lytical shortcomings of the joint study, and 
the severe restrictions imposed by Chinese 
authorities, the WHO-convened joint study 
into the origins of COVID–19 was prevented 
from providing a balanced consideration of 
the multiple theories of the origin of COVID– 
19; 
Whereas only 4 of the 313 pages of the 
joint-study team report and its annexes ad-
dressed the possibility of a laboratory acci-
dent, and no thorough examination of the 
lab incident hypothesis was carried out by 
the joint-study team; 
Whereas some of the international experts 
on the joint-study team stated that they 
lacked the means and resources to properly 
investigate the research-related accident hy-
pothesis, and they were neither able nor 
meant to do such a full investigation but in-
stead were acting as a ‘‘study review group’’; 
Whereas WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros 
Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented on March 
30, 2021, the day the joint-study report was 
released, ‘‘I do not believe that [the joint- 
study team’s] assessment [of a possible lab 
incident] was extensive enough. Further data 
and studies will be needed to reach more ro-
bust conclusions . . . potentially with addi-
tional missions involving specialist experts, 
which I am ready to deploy.’’; 
Whereas the WHO Director-General further 
commented, ‘‘As far as WHO is concerned all 
hypotheses remain on the table . . . We have 
not yet found the source of the virus, and we 
must continue to follow the science and 
leave no stone unturned as we do . . . It is 
clear that we need more research across a 
range of areas, which will entail further field 
visits.’’; 
Whereas the March 30, 2021 Joint State-
ment on the WHO-convened COVID–19 Ori-
gins Study by the United States and 13 other 
countries 
recognized 
the 
severe 
short-
comings of the joint-study process and called 
for ‘‘a transparent and independent analysis 
and evaluation, free from interference and 
undue influence.’’; 
Whereas, in spite of the devastation the 
COVID–19 pandemic has caused in the United 
States and around the world, no process cur-
rently exists to ensure a comprehensive in-
vestigation into the source of COVID–19; 
Whereas such an investigation is essential 
for ensuring this type of crisis never happens 
again for the benefit of all people, all na-
tions, and future generations: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) a comprehensive investigation to deter-
mine the origins of COVID–19 must be con-
ducted by the World Health Organization im-
mediately, 
with 
access 
to 
all 
relevant 
records, samples, and personnel in China, 
and that such investigation must fully ex-
plore all possible sources of the COVID–19 
pandemic, including exclusively ‘‘natural’’ 
zoonosis in the wild, human contamination 
in an animal farm, and a research-related ac-
cident; 
(2) the United States delegation to the 
World Health Assembly should, in concert 
with allies and partners around the world, 
work to ensure that an international sci-
entific investigation into the origins of 
COVID–19, with full access to all relevant 
records, samples, and personnel in China, 
will be authorized by the World Health As-
sembly and implemented with extreme ur-
gency; and 
(3) should such a full investigation not be 
authorized by the 2021 World Health Assem-
bly, then the United States Government 
should immediately begin planning a com-
prehensive and data-driven investigation 
into the COVID–19 pandemic origins, in con-
cert with willing partner governments and 
experts around the world.

Fordham University, the number 1 seeded 
Clemson University, the number 8 seeded

Whereas Jamil Roberts scored his third

following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
Whereas John William Warner was born on 
February 18, 1927, to John and Martha War-
ner; 
Whereas John Warner began his service to 
the nation by enlisting in the Navy at the 
age of 17 to serve in World War II and was 
discharged as a Petty Officer 3rd class and 
was commissioned in the Marines during the 
Korean War, reaching the rank of Captain; 
Whereas John Warner, using benefits from 
the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 
(commonly known as the ‘‘G.I. Bill’’) (58 
Stat. 284, chapter 268), attended Washington 
& Lee University and the University of Vir-
ginia Law School and maintained a life-long 
love of the Lexington and Charlottesville 
communities, who encouraged and supported 
the completion of his educational pursuits; 
Whereas, in 1960, John Warner continued in 
public service when he went to work in the 
Eisenhower White House and later was 
tasked with serving as an advance-man for 
Vice President Nixon during his presidential 
campaign; 
Whereas, in 1969, John Warner was nomi-
nated by the President and confirmed by the 
Senate to serve as Under Secretary of the 
Navy and later Secretary of the Navy; 
Whereas, in 1976, John Warner served as 
the Director of the American Revolution Bi-
centennial; 
Whereas, in 1978, John Warner was elected 
to the Senate; 
Whereas John Warner retired from the 
Senate in 2009, having won 5 consecutive 
statewide elections and after having served 
as the second-longest serving Senator in the 
history of the Commonwealth of Virginia; 
Whereas, for 30 years, John Warner rep-
resented the Commonwealth of Virginia and 
the United States with honor and distinction 
in the Senate, building consensus and bridg-
ing divides on critical national security and 
domestic policy issues; 
Whereas John Warner spent his entire ca-
reer in the Senate as a member of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services, including serving 
for years as the Chairman and Ranking 
Member of that Committee; 
Whereas John Warner served as— 
(1) Vice Chairman of the Select Committee 
on Intelligence; 
(2) Chairman of the Committee on Rules 
and Administration; 
(3) a senior member of the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works; and 
(4) a member of the Committees on— 
(A) Homeland Security and Government 
Affairs; 
(B) Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions; and 
(C) Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; 
Whereas, throughout his career in the Sen-
ate, John Warner championed the needs of 
the men and women serving in the United 
States military and of veterans; 
Whereas, through pay increases, enhanced 
military health care benefits, support for the 
Department of Defense medical research pro-
grams, enacting the TRICARE for Life pro-
gram under section 1086(d) of title 10, United 
States Code and the Post-9/11 Veterans Edu-
cational Assistance Act of 2008 (38 U.S.C. 3301 
et seq.; Public Law 110–252), John Warner 
recognized that a first-class military de-
pended on the well-being of the remarkable 
men and women who stepped into service as 
well as their families; 
Whereas John Warner recognized the im-
portance of diversity and led by example, 
such as by— 
(1) having his Senate staff led by strong 
women for more than 20 years; 
(2) recommending for nomination and suc-
cessfully seeking the confirmation of the 
first woman to serve on the Federal bench in 
the history of Virginia; 
(3) recommending for nomination and suc-
cessfully securing the confirmation of the

eral district court in the history of Virginia; 
and 
(4) recommending for nomination and suc-
cessfully securing confirmation of the first 
African American to serve on the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-
cuit in the history of the court; 
Whereas John Warner had a personal pas-
sion and love of the outdoors that began as 
a young boy fishing on the Shenandoah 
River and some of his proudest achievements 
legislatively were ones to conserve sensitive 
and historic lands in Virginia by expanding 
and establishing new national parks, na-
tional wildlife refuges, wilderness areas, and 
completing the Appalachian National Scenic 
Trail in Virginia; 
Whereas John Warner was dedicated to im-
proving the quality of life for all Virginians 
and all people of the United States, recog-
nizing that our transportation systems were 
critical 
components 
fostering 
economic 
growth and personal safety; 
Whereas, by supporting transportation in-
frastructure such as highways, bridges, air-
ports, mass transit, bus systems, and, par-
ticularly, the extension of the Metro rail 
system, John Warner contributed to safe 
travel of the people of the United States, ex-
panded economic opportunities, and con-
nected rural and urban communities; 
Whereas, from leading the regional efforts 
to build a new Woodrow Wilson bridge and 
expand Metro Rail to Dulles Airport, to ad-
vocating for transportation research at the 
Virginia Tech Transportation Institute and 
safety measures such as the use of seat belts 
and air bags, John Warner was fully com-
mitted to improving the quality of life for 
all on the roadways of the United States; 
Whereas John Warner fully recognized the 
value of an education and supported signifi-
cantly increased funding for the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 
1400 et seq.) and funding under title I of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.), and he proudly 
played a lead role in writing the Teacher Tax 
Relief Act, which provided a deductible tax 
benefit for teachers in the United States; 
Whereas, while Senator Warner served 
proudly as a member of the Republican 
party, Senator Warner was committed to 
putting country before politics; and 
Whereas, on May 25, 2021, at the age of 94, 
Senator John Warner passed away, leaving 
behind his beloved wife, Jeanne, his 3 chil-
dren—Virginia, Mary, and John—and numer-
ous Warner Brother & Sister staffers who 
loved him dearly and served him loyally: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if 
there is no further business to come be-
fore the Senate, I ask that it stand ad-
journed under the provisions of S. Res. 
258 as a further mark of respect to the 
late John Warner, former Senator from 
Virginia, following the remarks of Sen-
ator CANTWELL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
wanted to come to the floor and talk 
about one aspect of the U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act that we haven’t 
had time to fully address out here on 
the floor, although we had some discus-
sion during the amendment process, 
and that is that the underlying bill in 
S. 1260 also reauthorizes NASA and 
puts support in for the Artemis Pro-
gram. 
On October 5, 1957, our Nation’s rela-
tionship with space changed forever 
with the launch of the Soviet satellite 
Sputnik 1. With a rival power’s sat-
ellite flying overhead, the geostrategic 
importance of outer space was undeni-
able, and within a year, the Nation had 
two new science agencies: the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency, or 
DARPA, and the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration, or NASA. 
That launch ignited the American 
competitive spirit and inspired the Na-
tion to rapidly develop its space capa-
bilities. 
Only 12 years later, from that mo-
ment, an American was the first man 
to set foot on the Moon, and the race 
to the Moon set the stage for the vi-
brant, commercial space economy we 
have today. We like the fact that Se-
attle and the region is now called the 
‘‘Silicon Valley of Space.’’ I know 
there are many aspects to our country 
where space is a key industry, whether 
that is in Florida, Alabama, Texas, or 
other Southern States we know, but in 
the innovation and in the next phases 
of innovation, a lot is happening in the 
nexus between software and space in 
the Pacific Northwest. 
So we are here again for a great com-
petition about the future of space. We 
must again make the strategic invest-
ments needed to win. Space is even 
more geostrategically important today 
than it was in 1957. There are more 
countries in the space race, and our 
competition is more advanced. New 
NASA Administrator, our former col-
league, Senator Bill Nelson, testified 
before the House Appropriations Com-
mittee last week about China’s ad-
vanced space missions. The United 
States landed the Perseverance rover 
on Mars earlier this year and, shortly 
after, China landed their own rover on 
Mars. 
As Administrator Nelson told the 
committee, ‘‘they’re going to be land-
ing humans on the Moon. That should 
tell us something about our need to get 
off our duff’’—spoken like our col-
league, as we knew him, blunt and to 
the point. 
I personally believe in the power of 
competition to spur innovation and to 
push our Nation to get more serious 
about making investments in space 
that 
will 
also 
catalyze 
economic 
growth. I do believe we should rise to 
the occasion. 
That is why we are trying to be very 
specific in an innovation and competi-
tion bill about what it is going to take 
to fund the Artemis Program. That 
means recommitting to the ambitious 
human space exploration goals like re-
turning Americans to the Moon and 
sending our astronauts to Mars in part-
nership with commercial and inter-
national partners. These are the can-
didates here for that Artemis mission. 
They are like our new colleague, Com-
mander Kelly, who are preparing—and 
it takes years to prepare—for this mis-
sion. I want to give them the certainty 
that we are going to make the right in-
vestments. 
That means taking a hard look at 
whether we are doing enough to pro-
tect the intellectual property essential 
to our leadership in space. We should 
make sure that where the entre-
preneurs for these are concerned, our 
IP and intellectual property won’t be 
stolen by other countries and, of 
course, it means providing NASA for 
the needs that they have to carry out 
the human exploration, science, and 
space technology missions. 
We can’t afford to lose momentum 
within the Artemis Program. The Chi-
nese, as I mentioned, are making rapid 
progress on a heavy-lift rocket with its 
ambitious exploration missions. We, 
too, I believe, should be doing all we 
can to understand and harness the 
power of this market and to make sure 
that Congress does its proper oversight 
role. 
I recognize that my colleagues and I 
may have a disagreement about the 
role of the commercial sector in space. 
It has been a long time since Congress 
made this decision, but I certainly re-
spect my colleagues’ ability and inter-
est in disputing here. 
Commercial programs can deliver 
lower prices and allow industry to 
bring about innovation and also help 
catalyze other ideas. That is why it has 
been NASA policy, since 1980, to en-
courage the fullest commercial use of 
space. That is when we really took off 
on this concept. 
I do understand that some probably 
have an idea that NASA should still 
control all of this IP and be in a posi-
tion of funding all of this ourselves, 
but I think our policy to move toward 
the commercialization of space has 
given us some benefits. 
A bill focused on competition and re-
search and development cannot leave 
NASA out of the conversation. That is 
why Ranking Member WICKER and I did 
bipartisan 
legislation 
to 
authorize 
NASA in the Endless Frontier Act as it 
came out of committee. 
The exploration and science work 
NASA carries out is important in and 
of itself, but their capacity to spin off 
additional inventions and other bene-
fits to us also return investment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3937 
May 28, 2021 
NASA has generated more than 2,000 
spinoff technologies since 1976 and, on 
average, these tech transfers from 
NASA generate generally $1 million per 
year for each spinoff enterprise. 
The gear that keeps our firefighters 
safe was originally developed as part of 
the space program as NASA developed 
astronaut clothing and gear. LASIK 
eye surgery, cochlear implants to im-
prove hearing, portable water filtra-
tion, cell phone cameras, and even 
memory foam all came out of NASA 
programs. 
So now let’s talk about this next 
project; that is, the Artemis project 
that is, obviously, an indication that 
we plan to send some women to the 
surface of the Moon. This time, under 
NASA’s Artemis Program, when we re-
turn to the Moon, it will be a woman 
who will take the first step. These are 
two candidates from this mission who, 
I am proud to say, are from the State 
of Washington and, hopefully, will be 
competing for one of those spots. 
Going to the Moon will allow us to 
develop the assets we need to go to 
Mars and the assets to reduce the risk 
of what a crewed Martian mission 
might look like. So this includes devel-
oping the most powerful rocket ever 
built, the Space Launch System with 
its Enhanced Upper Stage. That rocket 
will be able to carry 38 tons of crew and 
cargo, which NASA needs to enable a 
sustainable presence on or around the 
Moon. 
NASA will develop an orbiting out-
post, like the Gateway, which will be 
like an International Space Station for 
the Moon that can serve as a way sta-
tion for what we need to do to get our 
astronauts to and from and material to 
and from the way station, similar to 
what we would do with Mars. So nu-
clear power sources for surface oper-
ations and human landing systems—all 
of these things are part of the critical 
legislation. 
We will demonstrate the ability to 
build and live in a habitat on the sur-
face of another planet. That is what 
the Artemis project is all about. The 
Space Launch System and its capabili-
ties will be complemented by commer-
cial rocket launch science experiments 
essential to our understanding of how 
to operate on the Moon and compo-
nents of NASA that are building for 
things on and around the Moon. 
Getting to the Moon will also open 
up new opportunities for more commer-
cial space industry, and once we set up 
a camp on the Moon, our astronauts 
will demonstrate the technology need-
ed to extract resources like fuel, water, 
oxygen, and opening up new economic 
opportunities. 
The University of Washington has a 
lab devoted to technologies for extract-
ing water from the Martian atmos-
phere, and they are ready to do more. 
And in 2020, NASA challenged the com-
mercial sector to conduct a mission 
that would set the precedent for min-
ing lunar resources. 
Our commercial space industry is a 
critical partner to the Artemis Pro-
gram. The commercial sector brings 
their best ideas and the best tech-
nology to the table for NASA’s pro-
grams. Commercial capabilities enable 
the missions at lower cost with greater 
capabilities 
than 
could 
have 
been 
dreamed of during the Apollo era. 
However, NASA should be held ac-
countable for how it manages these 
commercial 
programs. 
President 
Trump, in his budget, requested $3.4 
billion for the lander system. In fact, I 
think the Vice President at the time, 
Mike Pence, was an enthusiastic sup-
porter of the Artemis Program and 
constantly evangelized our need for in-
vestment. 
The Agency has made it clear they 
need $10 billion for the human lander 
system over the next several years. 
This program investment, I believe, is 
critical to the mission, but it is also 
critical that it follows NASA’s best 
practices. 
One of the lessons learned from the 
assembly of the International Space 
Station is the importance of having 
multiple 
space 
transportation 
pro-
viders. NASA carried out that best 
practice in programs that developed 
the commercial space system that car-
ried cargo and crew to the Inter-
national Space Station. 
The American taxpayers invest too 
much in these space programs not to 
apply these lessons about the impor-
tance of resiliency and redundancy. 
The same lesson should be applied to 
the programs developed here as we ap-
proach this new project to land people 
back on the Moon. 
These are complex systems with mul-
tiple components that need to work to-
gether to get astronauts down to the 
lunar surface and back safely. Building 
in resiliency and redundancy increases 
NASA’s chances of successfully landing 
humans on the Moon and bringing 
them home safely. 
The Commercial Cargo Program is a 
perfect example where building in re-
siliency and redundancy through com-
petition paid off. The program was cre-
ated to transport cargo like supplies 
for astronauts and science missions to 
the International Space Station. Dur-
ing that program, one company’s rock-
et blew up on the way to the Inter-
national Space Station and had to be 
removed from service for a whole year. 
But because the program built in resil-
iency and redundancy, the Nation was 
able to continue to supply the station 
with the supplies that it needed. 
When the second commercial com-
pany suffered a launch failure months 
later, the first company stepped back 
in. The importance of maintaining 
competition within NASA programs to 
protect our investments and maximize 
our chances of mission success were 
clearly there, and we were able to keep 
going. 
As a former NASA official put it, 
‘‘Technical redundancy and market 
competition [are] central to the prin-
ciple of commercial space contracting. 
Any one system would just leave us 
with 
the 
vulnerabilities 
that 
had 
plagued the space shuttle program.’’ 
And we all know the complexities 
and challenges and the disaster that 
could and did happen there. 
This is our opportunity now to in-
vest, as we are making this big deci-
sion about America’s competition and 
our innovation. Nothing could be a 
greater symbol than our return to the 
Moon and our exploration of Mars and 
the competition we face than gal-
vanizing Americans in support of this, 
just as we did in the sixties. This is our 
opportunity to invest in American 
space capabilities and leadership for 
decades into the future. 
We are going to make sure we get 
this right. We are going to make sure 
we protect the taxpayer investment. 
We are going to make sure we have re-
dundancy now. I think this underlying 
bill helps us by clarifying to NASA 
what we expect out of the Artemis Pro-
gram and what we need to do to make 
sure that NASA follows best practices 
in its management program. 
Returning Americans to the Moon 
and landing people on Mars will do 
wonders, and certainly I am excited 
about the iconic nature of a woman 
being the first to return for us to the 
Moon and all the things that will help 
us in educating women in the areas of 
science, technology, engineering, and 
math. 
NASA does great work promoting 
these missions and getting young peo-
ple interested in the STEM field, and it 
can inspire a whole generation of 
women to take up the sciences and to 
be involved. We saw this during the 
Apollo era. Many scientific and tech-
nical professionals went into their 
fields because they got excited by 
watching the Apollo missions. 
So as we stare down the potential for 
millions and millions of unfilled STEM 
jobs for the future, I think this is the 
kind of inspiration that can be quite 
helpful to us. 
Also, from Earth science, to solar 
science, to astrophysics, the scientific 
work of NASA helps us understand our 
universe. NASA’s climate work is par-
ticularly impactful. Their data on sea 
level rise and carbon dioxide levels in 
the atmosphere are critical to under-
standing the ability to fight climate 
change, and that is why the Earth 
sciences open up so much data for us 
that we want to make sure we are mov-
ing forward with this NASA authoriza-
tion. 
It will require NASA to make its 
Earth science data as interactive, 
interoperable, and accessible as fea-
sible to academics and industry so that 
they can utilize this information more 
usefully. I actually think this is a very 
exciting element of the program and 
progress that NASA is making. It is a 
no-brainer that it would allow us to

supports over 10 million jobs. Keeping 
that industry competitive, especially 
as the Nation comes out of the COVID 
pandemic, and keeping us on track 
with meeting our international emis-
sions standards is critical. 
NASA’s experimental work devel-
oping X-planes, in partnership with in-
dustry, drives major innovations in 
aeronautics. Their current work is fo-
cused on reducing the noise and emis-
sions of aircraft, developing electronic 
propulsion, and demonstrating super-
sonic aircraft that could one day fly 
over land, among other projects. 
Each of these are not incremental 
changes; 
they 
are 
fundamental 
changes. I hope that we will move for-
ward on this legislation. 
This legislation also requires NASA 
to continue to collaborate with indus-
try to develop next-generation mate-
rials 
like 
composites. 
Composites, 
lightweight material, are so important, 
I guarantee you, in the race for avia-
tion, advanced composite manufac-
turing, and whoever conquers this field 
best will be the leaders in aviation 
manufacturing. 
The Agency’s Advanced Composites 
Project was a great success in seeking 
to reduce the time needed to develop 
and certify new composites. It would be 
a loss to the Nation if the Agency were 
to lose momentum on this important 
work. 
So, as the Presiding Officer can see, I 
believe this NASA provision that is in 
the underlying legislation is critical. 
The Senate passed this NASA author-
ization last Congress, only to have it 
fail to be taken up in the House. It is 
time that we get this legislation 
through the entire Congress, that we 
make this Artemis mission a true pri-
ority, with true committed resources, 
to help us be successful and to be proud 
sometime in the near future to see that 
woman standing on the face of the 
Moon. 
I thank the President. 
I yield the floor.

IN RECOGNITION OF DARLA 
HOOVER 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Darla 
Hoover for her commitment to performing and 
educating, on the occasion of her 60th birth-
day. Ms. Hoover was a member of New York 
City Ballet (NYCB) from 1980–1991. Following 
her retirement from NYCB, Ms. Hoover began 
a distinguished career as a ballet teacher and 
repetiteur for the George Balanchine Trust. 
For over 25 years, she has served as Artistic 
Director of Ballet Academy East (BAE) on the 
Upper East Side of Manhattan. In 2019 she 
was named Artistic Director of Central Penn-
sylvania Youth Ballet. Ms. Hoover celebrates 
her 60th birthday on May 31 of this year. 
Darla Hoover trained at the renowned Cen-
tral Pennsylvania Youth Ballet before moving 
to New York City to attend the School of 
American Ballet when she was 15 years old. 
In 1980, after choreographing a solo for her in 
the New York City Opera production of Le 
Bourgeois Gentilhomme, George Balanchine 
chose her to become a member of NYCB. 
As a repetiteur for the George Balanchine 
Trust, Ms. Hoover has traveled the globe faith-
fully teaching the legendary choreographer’s 
most celebrated works. She has done this 
work at some of the most prestigious ballet in-
stitutions in the world. Ms. Hoover has staged 
Balanchine ballets for The Royal Danish Bal-
let, American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet, 
New National Theatre Tokyo, Dance Theatre 
of Harlem and the Vaganova Ballet Academy 
in St. Petersburg Russia. This performance 
marked the first time the Vaganova Ballet 
Academy had ever performed a work by Mr. 
Balanchine. 
As Artistic Director of BAE, Ms. Hoover 
has—alongside 
Executive 
Director 
Julia 
Dubno—developed it into one of the most re-
nowned ballet schools in the country. Alumni 
have become professional dancers in ballet 
companies around the world, including NYCB, 
American Ballet Theater, and Dance Theatre 
of Harlem. The BAE faculty includes world-re-
nowned current and former dancers, and its 
performances have been praised by publica-
tions such as The New York Times. 
Ms. Hoover has been recognized as one of 
the best ballet teachers in the country. She di-
rects a nationally recognized Teachers Work-
shop, in which she teaches fellow dance edu-
cators on the syllabus and methodologies de-
veloped by the late Marcia Dale Weary, under 
whom she studied. Ms. Hoover has been in-
vited to share her successful techniques at 
some of the Nation’s premiere ballet pro-
grams, including Boston Ballet, Pacific North-
west Ballet and Miami City Ballet. 
Ms. Hoover has made a significant public 
contribution to American ballet as a teacher 
and mentor to young dancers. Her investment 
in the personal success and well-being of her 
students has positively impacted countless 
children and adolescents in ways that reach 
far beyond ballet. She regularly forms close 
relationships with her students, who remain 
her ‘‘kids’’ even after they move on to pursue 
professional careers. 
Ms. Hoovers dedication to her students and 
ballet is truly inspirational. The profound con-
nection and skillful instruction Ms. Hoover pro-
vides countless young dancers demonstrate 
both her brilliance and the importance of arts 
education. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the accomplishments of 
Darla Hoover and expressing appreciation for 
her dedication to the betterment of her stu-
dents, the arts, and community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LONG-
TIME SERVICE OF TREASURER 
ANDY MEISNER 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the longtime service of 
Oakland County Treasurer Andrew ‘‘Andy’’ 
Meisner. 
Andy has served the families of Oakland 
County at the Federal, State, and local levels. 
He served three terms as a member of the 
Michigan House of Representatives—eventu-
ally chairing the House Commerce Committee. 
Andy began serving as the Oakland County 
Treasurer in 2009, when our country was in 
the depth of the foreclosure crisis. He worked 
diligently with stakeholders to help them get 
back on their feet and stay in their homes, all 
while maintaining Oakland County’s AAA bond 
rating. 
Over the past 12 years, Andy has made it 
his priority to protect the financial well-being of 
Oakland County and its residents. He has cre-
atively educated students on the importance of 
financial literacy through his Financial Literacy 
Art Contest and created the Financial Em-
powerment Center, a program aimed at advis-
ing county residents, especially small business 
owners, through financial challenges. We in 
Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, and 
across the county, are so very grateful to him 
for his dedication to our community. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Oakland 
County delegation, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in thanking Andy Meisner for his service 
and many contributions as Oakland County 
Treasurer.

HONORING 
SABRINA JAVELLANA 
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Asian 
American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 
I am paying tribute to Floridians who have 
made outstanding contributions to our commu-
nity and our country. 
Today I rise to honor Sabrina Javellana. 
Sabrina, who is a proud lifelong resident of 
Hallandale Beach, graduated from Hallandale 
High School and Florida International Univer-
sity. On November 19, 2018, Sabrina made 
history as she became the first Asian-Amer-
ican, and the youngest person, ever elected 
as a Commissioner of Hallandale Beach. With-
in days, her colleagues selected her to serve 
as Vice Mayor. 
A dedicated public servant and community 
activist, Sabrina has championed environ-
mental policies to protect Florida’s coral reefs 
and waterways. She has advocated for the 
City of Hallandale Beach to recognize the dev-
astating effects of climate change and to pre-
pare 
for 
climate 
change-related 
extreme 
weather events and natural disasters. 
Sabrina is a champion for equity and justice 
in South Florida. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and 
celebrating 
Commissioner 
Sabrina 
Javellana.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF EVAN 
DWIGHT BASS 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Evan Dwight Bass, who 
tragically passed away on April 10, 2020, in 
Chester, South Carolina. Born in Rock Hill on 
March 4, 2003, Evan is the son of Bobby and 
Wendy Tinker Bass and the brother of Brady 
Coleman Bass. 
Evan was a well-rounded, deeply engaged, 
and hardworking young man. An honor stu-
dent at Chester High School, Evan was in-
volved in golf, wrestling, and Beta Club. A 
dual sport letterman for the Cyclones, Evan 
was also a goalie for the school’s Varsity Boys 
Soccer Team. Evan was described by the ath-
letic department as ‘‘a true teammate . . . 
who had genuine love for everyone he met. 
He taught us to always be kind, care for oth-
ers, to be selfless, to have fun, and to love.’’ 
An avid sports fan, Evan cheered for the 
Carolina Panthers and the South Carolina 
Gamecocks. He especially loved the Coastal

Carolina University baseball team, where he 
volunteered as a batboy throughout his child-
hood. 
A man of faith, Evan was also deeply in-
volved with the Chester ARP Church. He en-
joyed being part of the Senior High Youth, vol-
unteering at Bible School, and attending the 
annual church mission trip to Appalachia. 
In addition to his strong faith and athletic 
achievements, Evan was a civic-minded indi-
vidual. For example, Evan was a member of 
Chester ARP Pack 61, where he earned the 
highest rank in Cub Scouting, the Arrow of 
Light. Evan was also a member of Chester 
ARP Troop 61, where he achieved Life Rank. 
Evan was working diligently on his Eagle 
Scout project when he tragically passed away. 
His grandfather, Terry Tinker, is the Coroner 
in Chester County, so Evan decided to create 
a prayer building with an eternal flame and 
benches honoring the fallen first responders at 
the Coroner’s office. Evan never had a chance 
to finish his Eagle Project, so his scout broth-
ers completed it in his honor. 
Evan was a remarkable young man who 
humbly served his community well. There is 
no doubt in my mind that he has left an ever-
lasting mark on Chester County. Evan’s heart 
of gold is deeply missed by all who knew him, 
but his legacy will shine on for years to come.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT 
DAVID HERSHBERGER 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
honor 
Staff 
Sergeant 
David 
Hershberger as the 2021 recipient of the inau-
gural Memorial Day recognition program for 
the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia. 
Staff Sergeant Hershberger died on January 
10, 1968, in service of his country while as-
signed to the 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regi-
ment, 9th Infantry Division during the Vietnam 
war. Staff Sergeant Hershberger was involved 
in close combat with an armed hostile force 
and for his gallantry in action he was post-
humously awarded the Silver Star. 
Staff Sergeant Hershberger was born in 
Norfolk, Virginia, on June 10, 1947, the first 
child 
of 
Lloyd 
and 
Wilchester 
Woodley 
Hershberger (Chester). Along with his siblings 
Cindy, Patti, and Charles, David relished life in 
the country. With many aunts, uncles, and 
cousins nearby, he was rooted in family. The 
Hershberger family faithfully attended Laurel 
Avenue Church of Christ in Chesapeake, Vir-
ginia, where David attended youth group and 
was much loved by his church family. 
He attended Princess Anne High School in 
Virginia Beach where he was on the track 
team. He was particularly adept at running 
hurdles and was awarded a trophy for Athlete 
of the Year. He graduated with the class of 
1965. 
SSG Hershberger enlisted in the United 
States Army in 1966 and attended his training 
as an infantryman in Fort Jackson, South 
Carolina. Dr. James D. Johnson served with 
SSG Hershberger and said that, ‘‘David was a 
natural leader. Everyone, and I mean every-
one, in Company A, 360th Infantry knew him 
. . . When David spoke, everyone knew to lis-
ten and that whatever he said was straight. He 
was very energetic, enthusiastic, mature be-
yond his years and highly respected in every-
thing he did.’’ 
It is for these reasons and so many more 
that I am proud to recognize Staff Sergeant 
Hershberger as the 2021 recipient of the 
Fourth Congressional District of Virginia’s in-
augural Memorial Day recognition program for 
his selfless service to our Commonwealth and 
our country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Staff Sergeant Hershberger 
for his devotion to the United States of Amer-
ica and his selflessness while in defense of 
our country.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SERVICE 
OF COLONEL RANDY SOUTHARD 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, l rise 
today to honor Colonel Randy Southard. Serv-
ing in both the Reserves and Active Duty in 
the Army, and as a patrol deputy for the 
Outagamie County Sheriff’s Office, Colonel 
Southard is an asset to his community and to 
his Nation. 
During his nearly 30 years of military serv-
ice, Colonel Southard took on several leader-
ship positions as an infantry officer and com-
mander. He served as the primary staff officer 
of five large Army Reserve units, Deputy Bri-
gade Commander and Exercise Branch Chief 
for 1st Brigade, Great Lakes Training Division, 
75th Training Command, and Chief Observer 
Controller Trainer for 15 Battalion and higher 
echelon units. During Colonel Southard’s serv-
ice he completed tours overseas in Kabul, Af-
ghanistan as Deputy Chief, Afghanistan Na-
tional Army Development, providing crucial 
support to the United Nations Security Coun-
cil’s International Security Assistance Force 
Joint Command. 
Amidst his deployments and hard work in 
the Army, he continued serving Northeast Wis-
consin as a patrol deputy in the Outagamie 
County Sheriff’s Office. Beginning his career 
with the Outagamie County Sheriff’s Office on 
June 7, 1999 Colonel Southard has served as 
a Field Training Officer, as a member of the 
Emergency Response SWAT team, and as a 
K9 handler. Colonel Southard has clearly 
demonstrated his commitment to serving for 
the public good and making the world around 
him a safer place during his 22 year career. 
I am incredibly thankful for his dedication 
and continued service with the Sheriff’s Office. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of this 
body to join me in applauding Colonel 
Southard for his impressive career and service 
in the United States Army.

AS 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
KENNESAW 
STATE UNIVERSITY 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outgoing President of 
Kennesaw State University, Dr. Pamela Whit-
ten. After serving as the Senior Vice President 
for Academic Affairs and Provost at the Uni-
versity of Georgia from February to June 
2018, the Board of Regents of the University 
System of Georgia selected Dr. Whitten to 
lead one of Georgia’s top universities. 
During her tenure, Kennesaw State Univer-
sity has experienced record enrollment growth, 
stronger research capacity, and a more bene-
ficial student experience. In response to 
COVID–19, 
President 
Whitten 
challenged 
KSU’s faculty, staff, and administrators to 
prioritize student health and maintain aca-
demic excellence in innovative ways, even 
during a pandemic. Under her leadership, the 
university became a leading example of re-
mote learning and established a COVID test-
ing site on campus for the region. 
I thank President Whitten for her friendship, 
her leadership of Kennesaw State University, 
and am grateful for her dedication to all who 
call themselves KSU Owls. I wish her the best 
as she becomes the next President of Indiana 
University.

RECOGNIZING ACHIEVEMENTS OF 
BRAD HICKS 
HON. CLIFF BENTZ 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the achievements of Brad Hicks, 
who retires on June 30, 2021, after working 
nearly 28 years with The Chamber of Medford 
& Jackson County, serving as its President 
and Chief Executive Officer for 21 of those 
years. 
Brad was raised in Grants Pass, Oregon, 
and graduated from North Valley High School 
in 1983, where he served as Class President. 
Brad attended Southern Oregon University, 
graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Political 
Science in 1987, and then worked with mem-
bers in the Oregon State Legislature and the 
United States Congress for nearly five years. 
In 1993, Brad returned to the Rogue Valley, 
beginning his career in chamber management 
as the Membership Director for The Chamber 
of Medford & Jackson County. In 1999, Brad 
took leadership of The Chamber as its Presi-
dent and CEO. 
As leader of The Chamber, Brad’s experi-
ence in government helped him develop a 
unique strategy focused on encouraging com-
petition among small businesses, limiting their 
tax burden, and promoting highly qualified 
workers. Brad also raised serious questions 
about how businesses were expected to thrive 
while government was failing to capitalize on 
Oregon’s economic advantages. He also fo-
cused The Chamber’s attention on issues

ranging from Oregon’s convoluted tax struc-
ture, failing transportation strategy and a high-
er education system that failed to produce 
skilled workers. Brad’s efforts led to the cre-
ation of ChamberPAC, a business advocacy 
organization. 
The amazing level of support Brad was able 
to generate for businesses in Southern Or-
egon won him several well deserved and pres-
tigious honors. In 2009, Brad earned the inter-
nationally recognized Certified Chamber Exec-
utive designation from the Association of 
Chamber of Commerce Executives. Brad was 
the only sitting chamber CEO in Oregon to 
hold this certification, which helped earn him a 
seat on the United States Chamber of Com-
merce Committee of 100. Additionally, both 
the Oregon State Chamber of Commerce and 
the Western Association of Chamber Execu-
tives named Brad the Chamber Executive of 
the Year. In 2018, the Western Association 
elected Brad as its Chairman, the first Orego-
nian to lead the 94-year-old association, which 
consists of members from 19 Western States 
and three Canadian provinces. 
Brad is most recognized for nearly doubling 
the size of The Chamber on several occasions 
and achieving the title of the largest Chamber 
of Commerce in Oregon and on the West 
Coast. Brad took The Chamber to even great-
er heights garnering the respect of the local 
community, the State of Oregon, and across 
the Western United States. Brad’s focus and 
work has always been to benefit business 
owners and communities throughout Oregon 
and the Nation. In fact, Brad would help a 
struggling business owner in Jackson County 
whether they were a member of the Chamber 
or not because he knew that a thriving busi-
ness would always be a positive force to the 
community. Even in retirement, he plans to 
spend the first year in an advisory role with 
the Chamber while he builds up his own busi-
ness consultancy company. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the remarkable career of 
Brad Hicks. For a man of his ability, who dem-
onstrated superb leadership and dedication to 
Oregonians and Americans alike, we cannot 
thank him enough. Brad’s achievements and 
reputation speak for themselves, and as an 
Oregonian, he has brought great credit to him-
self, his community, the State of Oregon, and 
our great Nation as an industrious leader in 
commerce.

RECOGNIZING THE GILROY CITY 
COUNCIL DURING PRIDE MONTH 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I along 
with Representative LOFGREN, rise to recog-
nize the Gilroy City Council for its historic 
celebration of Pride Month: the Pride flag will 
fly for the first time at Gilroy City Hall. 
Everyone in our community deserves to feel 
seen, heard, and loved. By displaying the 
Pride flag, the City of Gilroy reminds everyone 
in our community that they have a safe and 
welcoming home here. 
Our country has made so much progress, 
but despite this, one in three LGBTQ+ Ameri-
cans have faced some kind of discrimination 
in the past year. Members of the LGBTQ+ 
community continue to face discrimination in 
their personal lives, in the workplace, and in 
their access to necessary healthcare. 
The significance behind the Pride flag’s dis-
play is not only to demonstrate acceptance of 
the LGBTQ+ community in Gilroy, it’s also to 
celebrate the contributions to progress made 
by so many LGBTQ+ individuals. 
Everyone should be able to live their truth 
without fear of discrimination or violence. 
Members of the LGBTQ+ community deserve 
equal rights under the law, to be treated as full 
and equal citizens, and to be celebrated for 
their impact on history locally, nationally, and 
internationally. 
Madam Speaker, it is our pleasure to recog-
nize the historic nature of this occasion, and 
we ask our distinguished colleagues to join us 
in recognizing this celebration of Pride Month. 
We extend our personal appreciation to the 
Gilroy City Council for their support of Gilroy’s 
LGBTQ+ community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF AMERICAN LE-
GION POST 337 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to congratulate the American Legion Post 
337 Mixtacki-Johnson on its 100th Anniver-
sary. 
Post 337 was formed on May 16, 1921 
when 15 founding members came together to 
sign the Legion constitution in Pulaski, Wis-
consin. For 100 years, the Pulaski American 
Legion Post 337 has upheld the vision of le-
gions across the country to the highest de-
gree. Post 337 proudly carried the name of 
Pulaski native and World War One veteran, 
Private Adam Mixtacki, who was killed in ac-
tion in France in 1918 at just 21 years old 
upon their founding. In 1950 they added the 
name of fellow Pulaski resident and Airforce 
Veteran, Sergeant Harvey Johnson. Sergeant 
Johnson was killed in action in Germany dur-
ing World War Two when his B–26 was shot 
down by enemy fire. 
The legion carries on the memory, service, 
and sacrifice of Private Mixtacki and Sergeant 
Johnson through their vision of strengthening 
America by improving the lives of veterans, 
the military, and their families. 
Post 337 has continued to grow from their 
beginnings of 15 founding members 100 years 
ago. Post 337 now has members from Brown, 
Oconto, Shawano, and Outagamie Counties, 
who work together to teach future generations 
about the importance of service. The members 
of the Post 337 are a true inspiration and ex-
ample for all Americans. The continued serv-
ice and dedication that the members of Post 
337 have shown to not only the Pulaski com-
munity, but to the United States of America is 
deserving of the highest degree of recognition. 
As we celebrate the 100th Anniversary of 
Post 337, we must recognize the outstanding 
services that they have and continue to pro-
vide to Pulaski and surrounding communities. 
In addition to providing the color guard and 
rifle squads for local ceremonies, Post 337 en-
joys supporting the Pulaski High School and 
other organizations in countless ways. Post 
337 sponsors sporting events, band trips, 
Badger Boys State, Youth Government day, 
offers scholarships and ceremonies, all of 
which have provided countless opportunities 
for members of the Pulaski community. 
Post 337 has been a voice for the men and 
women who have served our country. At Post 
337 every day they put country before self, 
just as they did the day they enlisted. Amer-
ican Legion Post 337 Mixtacki-Johnson is a 
true credit to Northeast Wisconsin. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the 
Pulaski 
American 
Legion 
Post 
337 
Mixtacki-Johnson as they come together to 
celebrate their 100th Anniversary.

SURFACE 
TRANSPORTATION 
RE-
SEARCH & DEVELOPMENT ACT 
OF 2021 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to be joined by my colleague on 
the Committee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology, Ranking Member LUCAS, Research 
and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman 
STEVENS and Ranking Member WALTZ, and 
numerous other colleagues in introducing the 
Surface Transportation Research & Develop-
ment Act of 2021. 
Every day, Americans depend on our out-
dated transportation infrastructure to access 
essential goods, to connect with friends and 
family, and to move their products across the 
country. I applaud President Biden for his am-
bitious plans to update the nation’s transpor-
tation systems. I am still hopeful that Con-
gress can come to bipartisan agreement on in-
frastructure. In any such agreement, we must 
not lose sight of the critical role of research 
and development in our transportation future. 
We must be dedicated to making significant 
investments in R&D, in partnership with local 
and state governments and the many non-
government stakeholders, to successfully de-
velop the technologies and systems that will 
make transportation safer, more equitable, 
more efficient, and more sustainable. 
The Surface Transportation Research & De-
velopment Act of 2021 authorizes the Depart-
ment of Transportation’s (DOT) surface trans-
portation research, development, and dem-
onstration programs through fiscal year 2027. 
The legislation supports long-term, high-risk 
research across all modes of surface transpor-
tation. It increases the funding available to all 
tiers of the University Transportation Centers 
program and updates the UTC program to bet-
ter tackle complex crosscutting transportation 
challenges, like cybersecurity and sustain-
ability. 
The bill also supports research to ensure 
our entire transportation infrastructure remains 
resilient to natural disasters, extreme weather, 
and climate change impacts. By creating resil-
ient transportation infrastructure centers of ex-
cellence, the bill would support the develop-
ment of new materials, maintenance stand-
ards, and workforce development to mitigate 
the impacts of climate change. The bill also 
reauthorizes the Road Weather Centers of Ex-
cellence, which were last funded in 2009.

The bill would enable DOT to better plan for 
the future of surface transportation research, 
through more regular and focused strategic 
planning and the establishment of a surface 
transportation research and development advi-
sory committee. It would fund research to in-
crease understanding of the role that autono-
mous trucking may play in the future move-
ment of freight as well as its social impact. It 
ensures that DOT supports research and tech-
nology development that meets the needs of 
smaller metro areas. 
These and other investments in transpor-
tation research, development, and demonstra-
tion in this legislation are necessary to support 
a safe, resilient, equitable and sustainable 
transportation future. As the Chairwoman of 
the Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee and a senior Member of the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee, I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to ad-
vance the priorities outlined in this bill for 
transportation innovation.

IN RECOGNITION OF DORA 
BAKOYANNIS, M.P. 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Dora 
Bakoyannis for her outstanding career pro-
moting 
peace 
and 
human 
rights. 
Ms. 
Bakoyannis is the Former Minister of Foreign 
Affairs of Greece and Former Mayor of Ath-
ens. Recently, Ms. Bakoyannis was elected 
Vice President of the Parliamentary Assembly 
of the Council of Europe (PACE). Ms. 
Bakoyannis was named Woman of the Year 
by the Euro-American Women’s Council. 
Dora Bakoyannis studied Political Science 
and Communication at the Ludwig Maximillian 
University of Munich and continued her stud-
ies in Political Science and Public Law at the 
University of Athens. 
Ms. Bakoyannis led the fight against ter-
rorism in Greece and abroad, participating in 
various legislative initiatives, international con-
ferences, and forums such as the United Na-
tions (UN) and the Council of Europe. Her 
work was inspired by tragedy, as Ms. 
Bakoyannis lost her husband Pavlas, a jour-
nalist and member of the Greek Parliament, to 
a terrorist assassination on September 26, 
1989. 
Ms. Bakoyannis is a member of the Greek 
Parliament and has been consecutively elect-
ed since 1989. From 1990 to 1992 she served 
as the Under-Secretary of State and from 
1992 to 1993 as Minister of Culture. 
Ms. Bakoyannis has been an inspiration to 
women all over the world. She was the first 
woman mayor of Athens, serving from 2002 to 
2006, and the first woman appointed Greek 
Foreign Minister, serving from 2006–2009. In 
2003, she was awarded the International 
Leadership Award by the International Centre 
for Women. She was also voted ‘‘World 
Mayor’’ in 2005, included on the Forbes list of 
the World’s Most Powerful Women from 2006 
to 2009, and elected as the first female For-
eign Associate of the French Academy in Hu-
manities and Political Sciences in 2009. 
Ms. Bakoyannis was also President of the 
U.N. Security Council in 2006 and Chair-
person in Office of the Organization for Secu-
rity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 
2009. In 2008, she was awarded the Emperor 
Maximillian Award by the State of Tyrol and 
the city of Innsbruck. In 2013, she became a 
Meritus Doctor of the European Polytechnic 
University of Bulgaria, for her work on south-
eastern European nations’ path towards mem-
bership in the European Union. In the same 
year she was awarded the OSCE Medal for 
her work on NATO-Russia relations between 
Russia and North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
member states at the 2009 Corfu Summit. 
In 2019, Dors Bakoyannis became the 
Chairperson of the Greek Parliamentary Dele-
gation to PACE, and, in January 2021, she 
was elected the council’s Vice President. She 
also served as the PACE Rapporteur for the 
functioning of democratic institutions in Poland 
and currently serves as Rapporteur for the 
Syrian crisis. Ms. Bakoyannis is also a mem-
ber of the Committee on Political Affairs and 
Democracy, the Committee on the Honoring of 
Obligations and Commitments by Member 
States of the Council of Europe, the Bureau of 
the Assembly, and the Sub-Committee on Ex-
ternal Relations. 
In addition to these accomplishments, Ms. 
Bakoyannis is Chairperson of the Cross-party 
Parliamentary Committee for the Development 
of Thrace, Chair of the American-Greek Par-
liamentary Friendship Committee, and mem-
ber of the Russian-Greek and Chinese-Greek 
Parliamentary Friendship Committees. She is 
Chairperson of the Greek Parliamentary Dele-
gation to the International Parliamentary As-
sembly of the Francophonie and is on the 
Board of Directors of the Brussels-based think 
tank, Centre for European Policy Studies. She 
lives in Athens and has two adult children. Ms. 
Bakoyannis is truly an inspirational example of 
the strength and competency of women at the 
highest levels of public service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the accomplishments of 
Dora Bakoyannis and expressing appreciation 
for her dedication to the betterment of all peo-
ple and especially for her diplomatic work on 
behalf of international amity.

RECOGNIZING STAFF SERGEANT 
JJ ARDIS 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Staff Sergeant JJ Ardis for his 
heroic actions and outstanding service. 
As a Deputy Sheriff in Sumter County, he is 
a former recipient of the Deputy of the Year 
Award and two Deputy of the Month Awards. 
Staff Sergeant Ardis received his most recent 
award after seizing cocaine, cash, and weap-
ons from a convicted felon who was assaulting 
his child’s mother. 
On a separate occasion, Staff Sergeant 
Ardis arrived on the scene of another deputy’s 
domestic violence call. The suspect, gun in 
hand, carelessly fired shots into the air while 
threatening to kill herself. As additional depu-
ties arrived, she struck her house while her 
children were inside. Staff Sergeant Ardis 
played a significant role in convincing the 
woman to drop her weapon. The children re-
mained safe, a potential suicide was averted, 
and the suspect was taken into custody. Mi-
raculously, none of the deputies had to dis-
charge their own weapons on that call. 
Law enforcement officers risk their lives 
each day to protect precious life and property. 
Men and women in uniform at the local, State, 
and Federal levels are essential in safe-
guarding our communities and deserve to be 
thanked for their great sacrifice. For years, 
Staff Sergeant Ardis has put his own life on 
the line to keep others safe. It is an honor to 
recognize his valiant efforts and know that his 
substantial contribution to law enforcement 
has not gone unnoticed. On behalf of the citi-
zens of the 5th Congressional District of South 
Carolina, I commend Staff Sergeant JJ Ardis 
for his brave and humble service.

TRIBUTE TO JORDAN 
EHRENKRANZ 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to Canyon Lake City 
Council Member Jordan Ehrenkranz, who 
passed away on Tuesday, May 4, 2021. Jor-
dan was a tireless and compassionate mem-
ber of our Riverside County community and he 
will be deeply missed. 
Jordan was born in Los Angeles, California, 
August 21, 1933. After attending local schools, 
Jordan began his career by becoming a sheet 
metal industry apprentice in a shop in Santa 
Monica. Just a few years later, at the age of 
24, Jordan took his first step on what would 
become a lifelong entrepreneurial path by 
starting his own business. In 1967, Jordan ac-
quired Ideal Heating and Air Conditioning and 
shortly thereafter became involved with the 
local chapter of the Sheet Metal and Air Con-
ditioning Contractors National Association. Jor-
dan would go on to serve in various leader-
ship roles within the association throughout his 
career and received its Career Legislative 
Service Award in 2011. 
Jordan continued to demonstrate his leader-
ship after moving to the City of Canyon Lake, 
where he would go on to serve on the Board 
of Directors for the Canyon Lake Property 
Owners Association for five years before being 
elected to the Canyon Lake City Council in 
2008. After serving 12 years on the city coun-
cil, including four years as mayor, Jordan be-
came the longest serving city council member 
in the city’s history. In addition to his commu-
nity service, Jordan enjoyed bowling, playing 
poker, and dedicating his time to clubs such 
as the Men’s Golf Club, Canyon Lake Asso-
ciation of Men, Fine Arts Guild, POA Facility 
Reviews Committee, and the Travel Club. In 
recognition of his significant involvement, Jor-
dan was fittingly honored as the Canyon Lake 
Citizen of the Year in 2019. 
Jordan is survived by his wife, Jennie 
Ehrenkranz, their five grown children, and 
seven grandchildren. I extend my heartfelt 
condolences to the Ehrenkranz family, his 
friends, and everyone fortunate enough to 
know Jordan. Although he may be gone, the 
many contributions Jordan made to his com-
munity and family will have a lasting impact.

HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Cayden Smith of Maumee, Ohio, has been of-
fered an appointment to the United States 
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. 
Cayden’s offer of appointment permits him 
to attend the United States Naval Academy 
this fall with the incoming Class of 2025. At-
tending one of our nation’s military academies 
not only offers the opportunity to serve our 
country, but also guarantees a world-class 
education while undertaking one of the most 
challenging and rewarding experiences of their 
lives. 
Cayden brings a tremendous amount of 
leadership, service, and dedication to the in-
coming Class of 2025. While attending An-
thony Wayne High School in Whitehouse, 
Ohio, Cayden participated in his student gov-
ernment, Environmental Awareness Club, Boy 
Scouts of America, and was a member of Na-
tional Honor Society. 
Throughout high school, Cayden was in-
volved with cross county and crew, achieving 
his varsity letter in crew. I am confident that 
Cayden will carry the lessons of his student 
and athletic leadership to the Naval Academy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Cayden Smith on his 
offer of appointment to the United States 
Naval Academy. Our service academies offer 
the finest military training and education avail-
able. I am positive that Cayden will excel dur-
ing his career at the Naval Academy, and I 
ask my colleagues to join me in extending 
their best wishes to him as he begins his serv-

HONORING SERVICE VETERANS OF 
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HONOR 
GUARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the Service Veterans of 
Northern California Honor Guard for its dedi-
cation to honoring and celebrating the lives of 
our veterans in the Sacramento Valley Na-
tional Cemetery and cemeteries in the neigh-
boring regions. 
Since the first national cemetery was estab-
lished in the United States following the end of 
the Civil War, there have been nearly 150 na-
tional cemeteries designated in forty states 
across the country. My home state of Cali-
fornia is home to nine of these cemeteries, in-
cluding the Sacramento Valley National Ceme-
tery. The constituents of California’s Third 
Congressional District and those who live in 
the Sacramento Valley region are grateful for 
the service of the cemetery’s volunteer Honor 
Guard and their work to gracefully bring re-
spect and dignity to our veterans’ funerals. 
This extraordinary group of volunteers pro-
vides funeral honors for military veterans and 
gives a final salute to those who have bravely 
served our country. Thanks to the National 
Defense Authorization Act of 2000, the United 
States Armed Forces ensure that any eligible 
veteran can receives full military honors during 
their funeral service at the request of their 
family. The Northern California Honor Guard 
performs up to 10 services each day for these 
fallen veterans, and all services are performed 
at no cost to the family of the deceased. 
I know that the families of our fallen vet-
erans join me in thanking and celebrating the 
important contributions of the Service Vet-
erans of Northern California Honor Guard as 
we remember and honor the incredible sac-
rifices of our veterans this Memorial Day.

HONORING GOVERNOR CARLOS 
ROMERO-BARCELO´  
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I rise con-
cerning the passing of my long-time friend and 
a great leader, Carlos Romero-Barcelo´, former 
governor of Puerto Rico. Carlos passed away 
on May 2, 2021 at the age of 88. I offer my 
deepest condolences to his family and loved 
ones, as well as those whose lives he im-
pacted during his tenure. 
Carlos Romero-Barcelo´ was a timeless cru-
sader for Puerto Rico. Throughout his life, he 
led the fight for equal recognition of Puerto 
Ricans, and I was especially proud to work 
with him while he served as the Resident 
Commissioner for the island in Congress. 
Carlos lived a life of public service for Puer-
to Rico. He served as Mayor of San Juan and 
then as Governor before being elected to be 
Resident Commissioner for Puerto Rico in 
1992. He dedicated his life to achieve equal 
rights for the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico. I 
was truly honored to know him and call him a 
friend. 
I was proud to serve with him on the House 
Natural Resources Committee. There we 
worked together advocating for Puerto Rico, 
and I was proud to support his efforts to 
achieve equality for the U.S. Citizens of Puer-
to Rico. His tireless work deepened Puerto 
Rico’s relationship with the United States, and 
I was proud to stand by him as a leader of the 
island. 
We honor his legacy and mourn his loss 
alongside his family—his wife Kathleen, and 
his children Carlos, Andres, Juan Carlos, and 
Melinda—and our friends, the people of Puer-
to Rico.

fourth President of Georgia Highlands in 2014 
and has faithfully led the College over the past

pand the accessibility of a college degree to 
more young people across Northwest Georgia

significant growth in Georgia Highlands’ eco-
nomic impact and student scholarship opportu-
nities, as well as the addition of a new aca-

I thank President Green for his friendship

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF GLC MINERALS 
LLC 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor GLC Minerals LLC as they cel-
ebrate their 150th anniversary. 
GLC Minerals is a Green Bay based, cus-
tom manufacturer of minerals and applications 
in its fifth generation of ownership and oper-
ation by the Hurlbut family. GLC Minerals 
services many of Wisconsin’s key industries, 
including dairy, poultry, glass, paper, construc-
tion, and agronomy. 
The company came from humble beginnings 
when entrepreneur Fred Hurlbut Sr. saw the 
potential for a business located in Green Bay. 
Fred saw the convenience in shipping and 
transportation that the Great Lakes offered 
businesses, and in 1871 Fred’s foresight came 
to fruition as the Hurlbut Calcium and Chem-
ical Company. In 1913, second-generation 
owner Fred Hurlbut Jr. grew the company to 
include major coal and bulk distribution 
throughout Northeast Wisconsin. 
In 1940 The F. Hurlbut Company relocated 
to the shores of the Fox River where it still re-
sides today, 81 years later. Throughout the 
mid–1900s the company expanded its equip-
ment and product line leading to a fitting name 
change of the ‘‘Great Lakes Calcium Corpora-
tion.’’ 
In 2015 Wesley Hurlbut Gamer I, fifth-gen-
eration family member to own the company, 
made the final name change to GLC Minerals, 
LLC. However, this was not simply a name 
change. Wes continued in his forefather’s foot-
steps and expanded the business again to 
serve our dairy industry with the cost-effective 
movement of product from rail to truck and 
farm. 
GLC Minerals continues to grow and sup-
port our local business community and the 
broader Green Bay community, helping to es-
tablish and support the Greater Green Bay 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in applauding GLC Minerals 
and the Hurlbut family for their 150 years of 
success.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
ANTHONY 
‘‘TONY’’ POLITO FOR HIS LIFE-
TIME 
OF 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
ARCHBALD 
COMMUNITY 
AND 
YOUTH SPORTS 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Anthony ‘‘Tony’’ Polito, a life-
long resident of Archbald, Pennsylvania and 
champion of youth athletics. Tony will be rec-
ognized for his decades of service to his com-
munity with the dedication of the new Tony 
Polito Field House at the Archbald Community 
Sports Complex on Saturday, May 29, 2021. 
Tony was born on May 27, 1932 to Theresa 
and James Vincent Polito, Italian immigrants 
who settled in Archbald. Tony went to 
Archbald High School where he stood out as 
a star athlete on both the baseball and football 
teams. He was an All-Star player on the base-
ball team from 1948 to 1950, and batting, left- 
handed, he was one of the league’s leading 
hitters. When not leading off at the plate, he 
was the starting centerfielder. In 1949, he 
helped lead the team to a championship in the 
Northern Division of the Lackawanna Baseball 
League. He was a starting player on many of 
the top teams in the region such as the Eynon 
Indians, 
the 
Dutch 
Hill 
AC, 
and 
the 
Carbondale South Side Clippers. He also 
played American Legion Baseball for the 
Eynon Legion. 
On the football field, he was a quarterback 
and halfback for the Archbald High School 
Rams. Prior to being sidelined with an injury, 
he was a top scorer in the conference, and as 
linebacker, he led the team in tackles. For his 
efforts on the field, he was named team cap-
tain and voted most athletic in his class. 
After graduating with the Class of 1950, 
Tony answered the call of duty and joined the 
United States Army. During the Korean War, 
he served as a demolition expert. Following 
his military service, Tony spent his profes-
sional career as a production control specialist 
at Lockheed Martin’s Archbald location before 
retiring after 40 years with the company. 
As a former standout high school athlete, 
Tony sought to encourage young athletic tal-
ent in his community. For nearly four decades, 
he has been actively involved in youth ath-
letics as a coach, mentor, and fan. He shared 
his extensive baseball knowledge and experi-
ence as the coach of a little league team, and 
he assisted with administrative tasks and field 
maintenance for the league. He has advised 
generations of players and coaches to help 
them reach their full potential in the sport. For 
his contributions, he has been recognized with 
a flagpole dedicated in his name at the Laurel 
Street complex and a banner on the fence of 
the Archbald Community Sports Complex field. 
In 2003, Tony was inducted into the Archbald 
Athletic Hall of Fame. 
Tony was supported in his community ef-
forts by his late wife, Lois Bishop Polito. To-
gether they had four children, ten grand-
children, and four great-grandchildren. 
I am honored to join Tony’s family and com-
munity in recognizing his steadfast dedication 
to youth sports and the Archbald community. 
May future generations of athletes, coaches, 
mentors, and community leaders be inspired

HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Ann Knollman 
(born Anna Veronica Materek) who passed 
away on April 15, 2021. 
Ann was born on July 14, 1941 in Hoboken, 
New Jersey. She was raised in Hoboken and 
graduated from the College of Saint Elizabeth 
in Convent Station, New Jersey (now known 
as Saint Elizabeth University). After gradua-
tion, Ann taught elementary school at Wallace 
Elementary School in Hoboken. During that 
time she met Dieter Knollman, and they later 
married in 1969. 
In 1971, Ann and Dieter moved to Arvada, 
Colorado, starting a whole new chapter of 
their lives. Once in Colorado, Ann quickly be-
came entrenched in the community, starting to 
work for local causes and local Democrats. 
This work became more of a passion and she 
dedicated much of her life to advancing 
Democratic causes and electing Democrats at 
all levels of government. 
In 1989, Ann became a Legislative Aide to 
former Representative and then later Senator 
Bill Theibaut. Her dedication and passion for 
Democratic politics only grew deeper. 
At one point or another Ann held just about 
every Democratic party office in Jefferson 
County. This included Captain-at-large, Finan-
cial Chair of Congressional District 7, Chair of 
Jefferson County Democrats, Chair of State 
House District 29, Chair of Senate District 19, 
Chair of Jefferson County Rules Committee, 
Chair and Cofounder of the Dem Fems, and 
her longest role, CD7 Chair. Ann worked 
around the clock and was known for her tire-
less efforts knocking on doors to remind peo-
ple to vote and played a critical role in helping 
elect candidates for the districts she chaired. 
One of Ann’s proudest achievements, and 
that of her family, was in 2006 when she re-
ceived the prestigious ‘‘Eleanor Award.’’ This 
award is presented to an individual who exhib-
ited distinguished and honorable service to the 
community. The award is given in honor of El-
eanor Roosevelt who believed that all people 
deserve fair and equitable treatment. She also 
believed it appropriate to challenge injustice 
and often, to do so, to stand up, speak out 
and create change. These may have been El-
eanor Roosevelt’s thoughts, but they also very 
much described Ann. Ann was also very hon-
ored and proud to be chosen as one of Colo-
rado’s Presidential Electors for three elections. 
I would like to express my appreciation to 
Ann for her kindness, friendship, and support 
over the many years we worked together. To 
her family, she was and always will be our 
Auntie Anna. 
Ann was predeceased by her husband, Di-
eter Knollman, her parents, Mary and Vincent 
Materek, her four brothers, Joseph, Vincent, 
Adam and Theodore Materek, her sister Helen 
Monaco, and her pups, Plato, Brandy, Daisy, 
and Shadow. 
While our state has been blessed with capa-
ble leadership throughout its history, few rise 
to the caliber and reputation of Ann Knollman. 
I am deeply grateful for her lifetime of service 
to our community and send gratitude for her 
service to the Jefferson County community,

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. NEL-
SON ‘‘RED’’ BERKELEY NOLAND 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mr. Nelson ‘‘Red’’ 
Berkeley Noland, beloved husband, father, 
grandfather, veteran, and philanthropist. 
Red was born February 3rd, 1927, in Rich-
mond, Virginia, to the late William Churchill 
and Mary Bleeker Noland. He was the last of 
three children, and at an early age, developed 
a love for adventure. 
Red was a man of faith and a lifelong mem-
ber of the Episcopal Church. He attended St. 
Christopher School in Richmond, VA. Red at-
tained the rank of Eagle Scout at 14 years old 
and attended President Roosevelt’s 1941 in-
auguration as part of the Eagle Scouts Honor 
Guard. 
During World War II, Red joined the U.S. 
Navy, reporting for duty on his 18th birthday. 
Following an Honorable Discharge after the 
war, Red studied at Princeton University, earn-
ing a degree in International Relations. 
Automobiles were a life-long passion for 
Red, moving him to ‘‘Motor City’’ Detroit, 
Michigan after graduation. Red began working 
as a lathe operator in a production line, build-
ing Cadillac transmissions. Because of Red’s 
work ethic and interest, it did not take long be-
fore he was moved up to work in sales. He 
became the youngest new car salesman in the 
Cadillac factory’s store in Detroit. 
In Detroit, he met the love of his life, Eloise 
‘‘Bunny’’ Day. Red and Bunny were married in 
1953 and had three children: Tom (1959), 
Betsy (1961), and William (1964). Earlier this 
year, the couple celebrated 67 years of wed-
ded bliss. 
In 1974, the Noland family moved to Colo-
rado Springs, Colorado, and purchased the 
Silver State Cadillac store. Soon after, Red’s 
appreciation for cars grew exponentially, and 
he acquired multiple franchise rights and ex-
panded to numerous stores and a state-of-the- 
art collision center. 
Over the years, Red grew the Red Noland 
Auto Group dealerships from less than 20 em-
ployees to over 150. 
Red appreciated every one of the employ-
ees, keeping up with each birthday and family 
event. He was a true family man and consid-
ered his employees to be part of his family. 
Living and raising a family in Colorado was 
an ideal situation for Red. Not only was he 
able to work in the industry he loved, but he 
also found a place that let his hobbies thrive. 
Red owned and flew planes and gliders in 
Colorado and came close to breaking distance 
records with his gliders. He was an outdoors-
man hiking many Colorado 14-ers and trails. 
Skiing was his favorite winter sport. Often he 
was found on the slopes of Vail up to his 90th 
birthday. 
Red had many joys in his life, but none 
more than his family and faith. Red is survived 
by his cherished wife, Bunny; loving children, 
Tom (Yingnan) Noland of Boulder, Colorado; 
Betsy (Stan) VanderWerf of Colorado Springs; 
and William of Leadville, Colorado; his adored 
grandchildren Erik, Carolyn, Katie, James, and 
Matthew; and his wonderful nieces, nephews, 
and friends. 
Red leaves behind a legacy of generosity, 
friendship, adventure, and faith. He lived his 
life with enthusiasm and purpose, and his 
deep commitment to his community and pas-
sions will transcend generations to come.

IN 
SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
JACKSON GREFE ON HIS OFFER 
OF APPOINTMENT TO ATTEND 
THE UNITED STATES MILITARY 
ACADEMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Jackson Grefe of Sylvania, Ohio, has been of-
fered an appointment to the United States Mili-
tary Academy in West Point, New York. 
Jackson’s offer of appointment permits him 
to attend the United States Military Academy 
this fall with the incoming Class of 2025. At-
tending one of our nation’s military academies 
not only offers the opportunity to serve our 
country, but also guarantees a world-class 
education while undertaking one of the most 
challenging and rewarding experiences of their 
lives. 
Jackson brings a tremendous amount of 
leadership, service, and dedication to the in-
coming Class of 2025. While attending 
Whitmer High School in Toledo, Ohio, Jackson 
participated in student government, Speech 
and Debate, German Club, and was a mem-
ber of National Honor Society. 
Throughout high school, Jackson was in-
volved with cross country and track and field, 
achieving his varsity letter in both. I am con-
fident that Jackson will carry the lessons of his 
student and athletic leadership to the Military 
Academy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Jackson Grefe on his 
offer of appointment to the United States Mili-
tary Academy. Our service academies offer 
the finest military training and education avail-
able. I am positive that Jackson will excel dur-
ing his career at the Military Academy, and I 
ask my colleagues to join me in extending 
their best wishes to him as he begins his serv-
ice to our nation.

MEMORIAL DAY TRIBUTE REMEM-
BERING THOSE WHO GAVE THE 
LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVO-
TION 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in remembrance of every man and woman of 
the Armed Forces who gave the last full 
measure of devotion in defense of our country. 
Memorial Day is a reminder to all of us who 
live in freedom that as President Kennedy 
said, ‘‘The price of freedom is high, but Ameri-
cans have always paid it.’’ 
Each May, veteran and service organiza-
tions come together to hold events around the 
country to demonstrate their gratitude to cur-
rent and former men and women in uniform 
and their families for their service to our coun-
try. 
This year marks the 46th anniversary of the 
end of the Vietnam War, the conflict that 
deeply involved and affected every member of 
my generation, but none more so than the 
families and loved ones of the 58,148 men 
and women who never returned home but 
whose valor and sacrifice is forever enshrined 
on the sacred Wall of the Vietnam Memorial in 
Washington, D.C. 
357 of those names remind us of the sac-
rifice on the altar of freedom made by the fam-
ilies of Houston. 
Among those who served are: 
1. Sgt. Major James Williams of the U.S. 
Army, who was able to join the Army at the 
age of 15 because his mother agreed to say 
that he was 17 (the required age) and was sta-
tioned in Vietnam from 1960 to 1962 as Advi-
sor to the Vietnam Regular Army and then 
served 3-combat tours of duty from 1965 to 
1967 before retiring in 1971 with the rank of 
Sgt. Major after 21 years of service. Sgt. 
Major Williams says today that ‘‘If I could 
go back in combat and do what I did, in my 
physical condition, I would do it all over 
again.’’ 
2. Major General John H. Bailey II (Ret) 
TXSG, who was commissioned a Second 
Lieutenant in the U.S. Army in May 1967 and 
served two tours of duty in Vietnam, 1967 to 
68 and 1971 to 72, first as platoon leader and 
company commander with the 101st Airborne 
Division, and second as an Army Fixed Wing 
Aviator where he flew Reconnaissance, Sur-
veillance, and Search and Destroy Missions 
over South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. 
3. Felix Lugo of the United States Army, a 
native Houstonian and has been a resident of 
the Heights for the past 45 years, who was 18 
years old when he joined the Army in Janu-
ary 1975 and served 6 years with the 4th Bat-
talion, 31st Infantry Division (Mechanized), 
Ft. Sill, Oklahoma and as a paratrooper with 
the 82nd Airborne, and is still so proud to be 
a Vietnam Era Veteran. 
Of the 2.7 million Americans who served in 
uniform in Vietnam, more than 10 percent 
(362,000) were killed or wounded, including 5 
Americans soldiers who were just 16 years 
old. 
The average age of the soldiers who fought 
in Vietnam was just 22 years old and 61 per-
cent of those killed were younger than 21. 
Three in every five (61 percent) of those 
killed were younger than 21 and 17,539 
among those killed would never again see 
their wives and children. 
So it is fitting and proper that during this 
month of May a grateful nation acknowledges 
and affirms the debt owed to those brave men 
and women who risked their lives to preserve 
the freedoms we too often take for granted. 
Texas is home to more than 130,000 active 
military personnel and more than 1,600,000 
veterans, 30,000 of which are from the 18th 
Congressional District of Texas. 
It has been an honor to represent these 
constituents and I am extremely proud of their 
service. 
As we acknowledge our veterans, current 
and future military men and women, it is es-
sential that we provide them with the re-
sources necessary to help, in President Lin-
coln’s words, ‘‘him who has borne the battle, 
and his widow and orphan.’’

That is why I was proud to cosponsor and 
help shepherd to passage H.R. 1344, the 
Helping Heroes Fly Act, that was signed into 
law in 2013 and which facilitates expedited 
passenger screening at airports for service 
members who are severely injured or dis-
abled, along with their families. 
It is why I also authored the ‘‘Helping to En-

Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace 
Act of 2015,’’ or HEROS Act, legislation which 
provides strong incentives for employers to 
hire, retain, and employ veterans in positions 
that take maximum advantage of their skills 
and experience. 
Madam Speaker, let us remember and keep 
in our hearts the brave men and women who 
gave the last full measure of devotion to their 
country while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan 
or some other foreign theater of conflict. 
God bless them and all who served. 
And may God bless the United States.

LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
TRAINING 
FOR 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
CRISIS 
RESPONSE ACT OF 2021 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, l rise to in-
troduce the ‘‘Law Enforcement Training for 
Mental Health Crisis Response Act of 2021.’’ 
This bipartisan and bicameral legislation has 
broad support from a cross section of mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle. The bill would 
authorize a grant program to law enforcement 
departments and corrections officers at the 
state, local territorial and tribal level to obtain 
vital behavioral health crisis response training 
to more safely and effectively resolve behav-
ioral health crisis situations. Funding for this 
training would be authorized under the Byrne 
JAG program funding. 
I would like to thank Congressman ANTHONY 
GONZALEZ for his partnership and collaboration 
on today’s legislation. I would also like to 
thank both Senator SHERROD BROWN and Sen-
ator JAMES INHOFE who introduced this bill as 
companion legislation in the Senate earlier this 
week. 
The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assist-
ance Grant (Byrne JAG) program, adminis-
tered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, 
supplies grants to local law enforcement enti-
ties for public safety initiatives. Grants author-
ized under this bill will be managed through 
Byrne JAG Prevention and Education pro-
gramming. 
Law enforcement officers are often the fist 
responders to behavioral health crises. And 
correctional officers must deal with difficult and 
fast changing mental health situations, which if 
not handled appropriately, put the life and 
safety of inmates and officers at risk. 
One in every 10 calls for police response in-
volve a person suffering from a mental illness; 
1 in every 4 people killed by police suffer from 
a mental health problem; 1 in 3 people trans-
ported to a hospital emergency room for psy-
chiatric reasons are taken by the police. When 
responding to calls, law enforcement officers 
need to be prepared to respond to all possible 
scenarios and, with increasing frequency, 
we’re seeing that involve behavioral health cri-
ses. By improving training for these types of 
responses, we can better keep our officers 
safe, ensure individuals in crisis are treated 
with dignity, and improve trust amongst af-
fected communities. 
Our nation owes a deep debt of gratitude to 
the men and women managing these situa-
tions, and this bill takes an important step to 
provide resources to help better manage men-
tal health crisis situations involving police and 
corrections officers. Today’s legislation is sup-
ported by both the Fraternal Order of Police 
and the National Tactical Officers Association.

GWEN EFRRMEYER (INGLIS) 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Gwen Efrrmeyer (Inglis) of 
Colorado who was tragically killed while riding 
her bike on May 16, 2021. 
Gwen was born on October 12, 1974. In 
high school, she was very active in sports and 
went on to play basketball and was an All- 
American high jumper at Calvin College in 
Grand Rapids, Michigan. There she also re-
ceived her degree in accounting. Gwen 
worked as Manager of Government Account 
Compliance at Brown and Caldwell for 14 
years. 
In 2004, she discovered her love of cycling 
and began racing. This love of bikes led her 
to meet her husband, Mike. They were mar-
ried in 2008. Gwen held numerous national 
and state champion titles. 
Gwen was a devoted wife and loving aunt 
and sister. She will be remembered for her 
contribution and impact on the local cycling 
community and as a great Coloradan.

INTRODUCTION OF THE VISION 
ZERO ACT OF 2021 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Vision Zero Act of 2021. This 
legislation passed the House last session in 
Section 1601 of the Moving Forward Act (H.R. 
2, 116th Cong.) and would make the develop-
ment and implementation of Vision Zero plans 
eligible for federal funding through the Surface 
Transportation Block Grant program and the 
Highway Safety Improvement Program. 
Traffic fatalities in the United States claimed 
more than 36,000 lives in 2019, equivalent to 
one death every 14 minutes. Traffic fatalities 
are especially common for the most vulnerable 
road users: pedestrians, cyclists, older Ameri-
cans, and children. Pedestrian and cyclist 
deaths also make up a disproportionate and 
growing share of traffic fatalities. In the past 
decade, annual fatalities for motor vehicles 
have stayed largely stagnant while pedestrian 
and cyclist deaths have increased by 52 per-
cent and 36 percent, respectively. We need a 
new approach. These are our friends, family, 
neighbors, and colleagues. The only accept-
able number of traffic fatalities is zero. 
The goal of Vision Zero is the elimination of 
all transportation-related fatalities and serious 
injuries. In more than 40 urban, rural, and sub-
urban communities across the country, resi-
dents, activists, and elected officials have 
come together to adopt and implement Vision 
Zero plans. These plans improve safety for 
pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, motorists, 
and vehicle passengers. Vision Zero is an in-
novative, multifaceted approach to improve 
transportation safety by using data, new part-
nerships, safe planning, and community-fo-
cused solutions to achieve zero traffic fatali-
ties. 
While communities are integrating their Vi-
sion Zero plans into transportation policy, the 
federal government has not supported the de-
sign or implementation of Vision Zero plans. 
The Vision Zero Act of 2021 integrates Vision 
Zero into federal transportation policy to 
prioritize safety, equity, and proper planning. 
Enacting the Vision Zero Act of 2021 will 
help communities of all sizes develop and im-
plement innovative, effective methods to make 
our streets safer for everyone. I look forward 
to working with my colleagues in the House 
and Senate to enact this legislation into law as 
part of a surface transportation reauthorization 
bill.

HIS SERVICE ON THE UNITED

LEGISLATIVE 
COM-
MITTEE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and thank Doug 
Mattson for his work on the United Airlines 
Master Executive Council Legislative Com-
mittee. 
A Washington native, Doug went on to 
serve honorably in the United States Air 
Force. During his time in service, Doug 
Mattson flew T–37s, T–43s, and C–40Bs and 
went on to finish his time in the military as a 
Captain. 
After his service to our country, Doug 
couldn’t keep his feet on the ground and be-
came a pilot for United Airlines flying Boeing 
787s. For the last eight years, he served on 
the Executive Council Legislative Committee 
where he worked to protect and promote the 
careers of pilots, concentrating on safety, pay, 
working conditions, benefits, and job security. 
He played a key role in preparing the next 
generation of pilot advocates to lead on these 
key issues. 
Doug provided a steady hand over his eight 
years and is an Air Line Pilots Association 
member his colleagues came to depend on. 
His ability to mentor pilots of varying political 
persuasions is a testament to his commitment 
to ensuring that the Executive Council Legisla-
tive Committee fulfilled its duty to ensure that 
pilots voices are heard on Capitol Hill. No mat-
ter the day or flight, he always had a smile on 
his face. 
Even though Doug has been busy dividing 
time between flying and advocating for pilots 
nationwide, he is a family man and enjoys 
spending time with his lovely wife Sharon, and 
their two sons Eric and Cameron. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to thank 
Doug Mattson for the time he spent advo-
cating for his fellow pilots on the United Air-
lines Master Executive Council Legislative 
Committee.

HONORING AZERBAIJAN ON ITS 
103RD REPUBLIC DAY 
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, as Co-Chair 
of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, I rise 
today to recognize Azerbaijan on the occasion 
of its 103rd Republic Day. 
Azerbaijan has a proud history as an inde-
pendent country, beginning in 1918. With its 
independence, Azerbaijan became the very 
first secular parliamentary democracy in the 
Muslim world. Azerbaijan was also among the 
first states to grant women the right to vote. 
Azerbaijan’s commitment to these values 
shows the world that they are truly universal, 
and that self-government and the respect for 
individual rights is not inimical to Islamic tradi-
tions. Unfortunately, Azerbaijan’s independ-
ence was soon snuffed out by the totalitarian 
USSR, which sought to spread values much 
different to those espoused by the fledgling 
Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. 
After the fall of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan 
regained its independence. 2021 is particularly 
notable in this regard as it marks the thirtieth 
anniversary of this event. 
Today, Azerbaijan remains a close partner 
to the United States and our allies. Through-
out the United States’ and NATO’s long de-
ployment to Afghanistan, Azerbaijan has been 
integral in ensuring stable lines of communica-
tion to the country and has partnered with us 
in the wider war on terror. Additionally, I find 
it significant and praiseworthy that as a Mus-
lim country, Azerbaijan maintains strong rela-
tions with the Jewish community and with our 
ally Israel, and has done so for some time. Fi-
nally, Azerbaijan is a key energy provider for 
Europe, helping our allies there diversify their 
energy supply away from Vladimir Putin’s Rus-
sia. And Azerbaijan’s importance as an energy 
provider will only grow as a result of the open-
ing of the Southern Gas Corridor last Decem-
ber. 
Keeping in mind our relationship with Azer-
baijan and its commitment to this partnership, 
I would encourage my colleagues to join me 
today in honoring Azerbaijan on its Republic 
Day.

STEVEN CHOTIN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Steven Chotin of Denver, 
Colorado who passed away on May 15, 2021. 
Steven was born in St. Louis, Missouri to 
Miriam and Alfred Chotin. He was the only son 
and middle child of two sisters. He graduated 
from Ladue High School and attended the Uni-
versity of Oklahoma for a brief time. He 
moved to Denver, Colorado in 1973 to reorga-
nize a company that was owned by a family 
friend. Shortly after he moved, he met his 
wife, Robin Cohen, and they were married at 
Beth Joseph Congregation in 1974. Prior to 
founding his own company, Steven worked for 
MDC Holdings where he played a primary role 
in developing their mortgage banking busi-
ness. 
In 1984, Steven founded The Chotin Group 
Corporation. Since inception, the firm success-
fully invested in structured financial products 
and real estate opportunities where he was in-
strumental in creating mortgage-backed secu-
rities. Throughout his career, Steven was a 
strong supporter of social and political causes 
in the Denver Jewish community, throughout 
the country, and Israel and the diaspora. 
In addition to his family office, most recently, 
Steven and Robin established The Chotin 
Foundation which is dedicated to improving 
and enriching the lives of individuals, children, 
and families with particular interest in Jewish 
causes as well as secular charitable initiatives 
in the areas of arts and culture, education, 
and health and wellness. In addition, he had 
a genuine interest in local, state, and national 
politics. 
Steven was a devoted husband and loving 
father and grandfather. Steven and Robin 
raised five children and enjoyed time with their 
grandchildren—Jaxon, Caden, Coco, Harper, 
Crew, Cole and Parker. I am deeply grateful 
for his lifetime of service to our community.

IN 
SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
JOHN SHAFFER ON HIS OFFER 
OF APPOINTMENT TO 
ATTEND 
THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE 
ACADEMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
John Shaffer of Maumee, Ohio, has been of-
fered an appointment to the United States Air 
Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo-
rado. 
John’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Air Force Academy 
this fall with the incoming Class of 2025, At-
tending one of our nation’s military academies 
not only offers the opportunity to serve our 
country, but also guarantees a world-class 
education while undertaking one of the most 
challenging and rewarding experiences of their 
lives. 
John brings a tremendous amount of leader-
ship, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2025. While attending Perrysburg 
High School in Perrysburg, Ohio, John partici-
pated in lacrosse, for which he earned his var-
sity letter. He also coached and refereed 
youth lacrosse. 
After graduating Perrysburg High School in 
2017, John attended Embry Riddle Aero-
nautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida 
and majored in aeronautical engineering. He 
then went on to attend the United States Air 
Force Academy Preparatory School in Colo-
rado. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating John Shaffer on his offer 
of appointment to the United States Air Force 
Academy. Our service academies offer the fin-
est military training and education available. I 
am positive that John will excel during his ca-
reer at the Air Force Academy, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in extending their best 
wishes to him as he begins his service to our 
nation.

degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling 
which thinks that nothing is worth war is much 
worse. The person who has nothing for which 
he is willing to fight, nothing which is more im-
portant than his own personal safety, is a mis-
erable creature and has no chance of being 
free unless made and kept so by the exertions 
of better men than himself.’’ 
Today, we honor the memory of those bet-
ter men and women. These heroes paid the 
ultimate price so we can enjoy the freedoms 
enshrined in our Constitution. They fought and 
died for this more perfect union. I am re-
minded of Winston Churchill’s comment about 
democracy following the fall of Nazi Germany. 
He said, ‘‘Many forms of government have 
been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin 
and woe. No one pretends that democracy is 
perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said 
that democracy is the worst form of govern-
ment, except for all those other forms that 
have been tried from time to time.’’ 
Since the founding of our nation, countless 
brave men and women stood in the face of 
imminent danger that we might continue their 
pursuit of a more equal, free, and prosperous 
society. And we are eternally indebted to and 
grateful for these champions of our experiment 
in democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I am privileged and hum-
bled by the opportunity to recognize these 
brave individuals.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
MARI-
JUANA OPPORTUNITY REINVEST-
MENT AND EXPUNGEMENT ACT 
OF 2021 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, today I am 
proud to have introduced the ‘‘Marijuana Op-
portunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act 
of 2021,’’ or the ‘‘MORE Act of 2021.’’ This 
long overdue legislation would reverse the 
failed policy of criminalizing marijuana on the 
federal level and would take steps to address 
the heavy toll this policy has taken across the 
country, particularly on communities of color. 
The MORE Act would make three important 
changes to federal law: 
(1) remove marijuana, or cannabis, from the 
list of federally controlled substances; 
(2) authorize the provision of resources, 
funded by an excise tax on marijuana, to ad-
dress the needs of communities that have 
been seriously impacted by the War on Drugs, 
including increasing the participation of com-
munities of color in the burgeoning cannabis 
market; and 
(3) provide for the expungement of Federal 
marijuana convictions and arrests. 
For far too long, we have treated marijuana 
as a criminal justice problem instead of as a 
matter of personal choice and public health. 
Whatever one’s views are on the use of mari-
juana for recreational or medicinal use, the 
policy of arrests, prosecution, and incarcer-
ation at the Federal level has proven unwise 
and unjust. 
This issue is not new to Congress. There 
have been many Members who have intro-
duced bills upon which provisions in this bill 
are based. For instance, Representative BAR-
BARA LEE has sponsored bills that are the 
foundation of key provisions of the MORE Act, 
and I thank her for her longstanding leader-
ship on this issue. Representative EARL BLU-
MENAUER has also been an indefatigable advo-
cate and has supported everything we have 
done to get to where we are today. I thank 
him, as well as my other colleagues who have 
joined me as original cosponsors on the bill. 
Federal action on this issue would follow the 
growing recognition in the states that the sta-
tus quo is unacceptable. Despite the federal 
government’s 
continuing 
criminalization 
of 
marijuana, 36 states and the District of Colum-
bia have legalized medical cannabis. Fifteen 
states and the District of Columbia have legal-
ized cannabis for adult recreational use. 
I have long believed that the criminalization 
of marijuana has been a mistake, and the ra-
cially disparate enforcement of marijuana laws 
has only compounded this mistake, with seri-
ous consequences, particularly for commu-
nities of color. 
It was only in the early part of the 20th cen-
tury that marijuana began to be criminalized in 
the United States—mainly because of misin-
formation and hysteria, based at least in part 
on 
racially-biased 
stereotypes 
connecting 
marijuana use and people of color, particularly 
African-Americans arid Latinos. In 1970, when 
President Nixon announced the War on Drugs 
and signed the Controlled Substances Act into 
law, the federal government placed marijuana 
on Schedule I, the most restrictive schedule 
that is attached to the most serious criminal 
penalties, where—unfairly and unjustifiably—it 
has remained ever since. 
As a consequence of this decision, thou-
sands of individuals—overwhelmingly people 
of color—have been subjected, by the federal 
government, to unjust prison sentences for 
marijuana offenses. It is time for this manifest 
injustice to end. The MORE Act would remove 
marijuana from Schedule I and the Controlled 
Substances Act altogether, thereby decrimi-
nalizing it at the Federal level. 
This is only fair, particularly because the 
same racial animus motivating the enactment 
of marijuana laws also led to racially dis-
proportionate enforcement of such laws, which 
has had a substantial, negative impact on 
communities of color. In fact, nationwide, the 
communities that have been most harmed by 
marijuana enforcement are benefitting the 
least from the legal marijuana marketplace. 
The MORE Act would address some of 
these negative impacts, by establishing an 
Opportunity Trust Fund within the Department 
of Treasury to fund programs within the De-
partment of Justice and the Small Business 
Administration to empower communities of 
color and those adversely impacted by the 
War on Drugs. These programs would provide 
services to individuals, including job training, 
reentry services and substance use disorder 
services; provide funds for loans to assist 
small businesses that are owned and con-
trolled by socially and economically disadvan-
taged individuals; and provide resources for 
programs that minimize barriers to marijuana 
licensing and employment for individuals ad-
versely impacted by the War on Drugs. 
The collateral consequences of a conviction 
for marijuana possession—and even some-
times for a mere arrest—can be devastating. 
For those saddled with a criminal conviction, it 
can be difficult or impossible to vote, to obtain 
educational loans, to get a job, to maintain a 
professional license, to secure housing, to re-
ceive government assistance, or even to adopt 
a child. 
These exclusions create an often-permanent 
second-class status for millions of Americans. 
This is unacceptable and counterproductive, 
especially given the disproportionate impact 
that enforcement of marijuana laws has had 
on communities of color. The MORE Act rec-
ognizes this injustice and addresses these 
harmful effects by expunging and sealing fed-
eral convictions and arrests for marijuana of-
fenses. Indeed, the states have led the way— 
and continue to lead the way—on marijuana, 
but our federal laws have not kept pace with 
the obvious need for change. We need to 
catch up because the public supports reform 
and because it is the right thing to do. 
In my view, applying criminal penalties, with 
their attendant collateral consequences for 
marijuana offenses is unjust and harmful to 
our society. The MORE Act comprehensively 
addresses this injustice, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to support this legislation.

EDWARD FLAHERTY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
and 
honor 
Edward 
Flaherty, Veteran of the United States Army, 
for his service to our country. 
Edward served in the U.S. Army from 1941– 
1945, serving two years, eleven months, and 
two days throughout the Pacific theater of 
World War II, including time in New Caledonia, 
the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea. 
While serving in the Army, Edward was a 
Medical Technician with the 131st Engineer 
Regiment Medical Detachment, in which he 
played an essential role in treating his fellow 
soldiers’ wounds and injuries while also assist-
ing with evacuations for casualties. 
During his time in the Army, Edward was 
awarded the American Defense Service Rib-
bon, the Good Conduct Medal, and the Phil-
ippine Liberation Ribbon with one star. Edward 
Flaherty’s courageous service helped to de-
fend our nation’s democracy and ideals 
abroad at a crucial moment in world history, 
His heroism has charted the path for future 
generations of men and women who serve in 
the military. We are proud to have Edward call 
Colorado home, and forever indebted to him 
for his bravery and sacrifice on behalf of our 
country. 
I extend my deepest appreciation to Edward 
for his dedication, integrity and outstanding 
service to the United States of America.

HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Nolan Barber of Monclova, Ohio, has been of-
fered an appointment to the United States 
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. 
Nolan’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Naval Academy this

one of our nation’s military academies not only 
offers the opportunity to serve our country, but 
also guarantees a world-class education while 
undertaking one of the most challenging and 
rewarding experiences of their lives. 
Nolan brings a tremendous amount of lead-
ership, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2025. While attending Anthony 
Wayne High School in Whitehouse, Ohio, 
Nolan participated in football, wrestling, and 
track and field, earning his varsity letter in all 
three. After graduating from Anthony Wayne 
High School in 2020, Nolan attended the 
United States Naval Academy Preparatory 
School in Newport, Rhode Island. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Nolan Barber on his offer

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
TELACU 
EDUCATION 
FOUNDATION 
ON 
THEIR 37TH ANNUAL BUILDING 
THE DREAM GALA 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the TELACU Edu-
cation Foundation (the Foundation), a non- 
profit organization that significantly impacts 
thousands of talented students from low-in-
come families, the majority of whom are Cali-
fornians and many are from my 40th Congres-
sional District. 
For nearly four decades, the Foundation has 
annually empowered approximately 2,000 first- 
generation high school, college, and graduate 
school students—including brave veterans of 
our nation’s military—to achieve academic and 
professional success, and to become the lead-
ers who inspire future generations. The 37th 
Annual Building the Dream Gala celebrates 
this year’s graduates who will join an army of 
TELACU Scholar Alumni who are changing 
our world by innovating solutions as research-
ers and engineers in cutting-edge laboratories 
such as NASA/JPL, CalTech, Harvard and 
MIT; serving on the frontlines of COVID–19 as 
nurses, doctors, vaccinators, and other health 
care professionals; and crusading for equality 
and justice across our nation—from the board-
room to the courtroom! 
TELACU’s ‘‘CREO’’ Award, the ‘‘I Believe’’ 
Award, recognizes individuals who exemplify 
the highest ideals and commitment to improv-
ing society through personal and public serv-
ice. This year it will be presented to the first 
Latina Los Angeles City Council President in 
the City Council’s 170-year history, the Honor-
able Nury Martinez. President Martinez is an 
outstanding role model who embodies the 
hopes and dreams of all TELACU Scholars— 
the children of Latino immigrant families, the 
first (but not the last) in their family to grad-
uate from college, the dreamers who consist-
ently shatter historical barriers to achievement. 
This year’s gala will also include a Special 
80th Birthday Tribute to Chairman and Found-
er of the TELACU Education Foundation, Dr. 
David C. Liza´rraga. With a dedicated career of 
service spanning six decades, Dr. Liza´rraga’s 
impact is immeasurable. Beginning as a social 
worker and community organizer, he quickly 
gained a reputation for equipping people with 
the tools they need to achieve self-sufficiency 
and the American Dream. As President and 
CEO of TELACU in the early 1960s, he devel-
oped a unique business model for community 
development based on one simple but pro-
found principle—profitability is inseparable 
from positive, tangible social impact. Under his 
leadership for more than 35 years, TELACU 
flourished and grew into the largest Commu-
nity Development Corporation in America. 
In response to staggering college dropout 
rates among young Latinx, in 1983 Dr. 
Liza´rraga created what is without a doubt his 
most impactful and legacy in service to our 
community and to our nation—the TELACU 
Education 
Foundation. 
TELACU 
Scholars 
have built a stellar legacy individually and col-
lectively. Historically, over 98 percent of high 
school scholars graduate and almost without 
exception pursue higher education; more than 
99 percent of college Scholars earn at min-
imum a Bachelor’s, with an increasing number 
going on to attain advanced degrees. Their 
achievement of higher education, increased 
earning power and dedication to service lead 
to the socioeconomic empowerment not only 
of their local community, but also of our nation 
and beyond! 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
please join me in congratulating The Honor-
able Nury Martinez in recognition of her in-
valuable contributions to the City of Los Ange-
les. And on behalf of the tens of thousands of 
students, veterans, families and communities 
they have served, empowered, and advanced 
to achieve self-sufficiency, I also ask my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the TELACU 
Education Foundation and its Founder Dr. 
David C. Liza´rraga—whose tireless work to 
expand educational opportunities has opened 
the door to vast new possibilities for thou-
sands of young professionals and veterans.

HONORING SHADAWN REDDICK- 
SMITH 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
thank and honor Shadawn Reddick-Smith for 
her years of distinguished service to the 
House Judiciary Committee and to the United 
States Congress. Through her strategic insight 
and tireless dedication to advancing the Com-
mittee’s priorities, Shadawn played a vital role 
in ensuring the work of the House Judiciary 
Committee was accessible and tangible to the 
American people. 
As we toiled together to reject then-Presi-
dent Trump’s disgraceful efforts to undermine 
our democracy and erode key Judiciary prior-
ities—namely reforming our immigration sys-
tem, preventing gun violence, and protecting 
access to the ballot box—I saw firsthand her 
passion and her skillful capacity to render our 
often-complex work understandable to the 
public. 
When Democrats took control of the House 
in January of 2019, the eyes of the country 
were fixed upon the Judiciary Committee I 
now chaired. I was deeply grateful that 
Shadawn stayed on my staff as my commu-
nications director as we entered this unprece-
dented time in American history. Before us lay 
problems existential in nature and scope: a 
lawless President intent on destroying demo-
cratic norms, an executive branch stubbornly 
fixed on stonewalling accountability, and a 
structure of government thrown into disarray 
by the Administration’s ineptitude and cruelty.

Despite the daunting task at hand, Shadawn’s 
composure was unflagging and her capacity to 
maintain and nurture relations with members 
of the press—and the Democratic caucus— 
were invaluable. 
It would be easy to recognize Shadawn first 
and foremost for her work on the Judiciary 
Committee’s oversight efforts, which included 
two presidential impeachments during her ten-
ure. And, to be sure, Shadawn handled these 
incredibly demanding environments with poise, 
marshalling stakeholders, communicating ef-
fectively with the media, and shaping the pub-
lic narrative to ensure our message of ac-
countability under the law was heard loudly 
and clearly by the American people. But to 
focus only on these high-profile events would 
be to omit Shadawn’s commitment to all the 
work of the Judiciary Committee. 
Shadawn sacrificed much of herself, without 
complaint, to provide access to the press and 
ensure the public understood what was tran-
spiring in the Halls of Congress. She would 
regularly wake early, arriving at the Rayburn 
House Office Building often before the sun 
rose to ensure that television cameras and re-
porters were met with unlocked doors. She 
was also a kind presence to the junior staffers 
and interns who perform much of the unsung 
work of the Committee, offering guidance on 
how to communicate effectively and how to 
navigate a career on Capitol Hill. And 
Shadawn expanded and transformed the Judi-
ciary Committee’s digital program, ensuring 
that the work of the Committee could meet 
Americans where they are today: online and 
on social media. Her legacy is a Judiciary 
Committee with a social media reach unparal-
leled among other House Committees. 
In bringing the Judiciary Committee into the 
21st century, Shadawn worked to ensure that 
the Committee was actively addressing issues 
that were top of mind to the American people. 
She was deeply passionate about overhauling 
America’s broken, often brutal system of polic-
ing and helped shepherd the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act—bold legislation that 
reimagines policing in our communities— 
through the Judiciary Committee and the full 
House of Representatives. In doing so, 
Shadawn showcased her wide array of skills, 
demonstrating her ability to build consensus, 
deftly manage a surge of press requests, and 
craft a message that helped facilitate the bill’s 
passage while rendering it visible to the public 
at large. 
Shadawn is moving on to tackle new chal-
lenges at the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, where she will serve as Director of Stra-
tegic Communications. She is one of a select 
few who stood tall and demonstrated exem-
plary grit during a most turbulent moment for 
our nation. I always felt proud to have her by 
my side. 
I wish Shadawn all the best in her future en-
deavors, and I thank her for her service to the 
Committee, to the Congress, and to the coun-
try.

Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as part of our national celebration of Asian

I am paying tribute to Floridians who have 
made outstanding contributions to our commu-

Today I rise to honor Alex Sink. 
Adelaide ‘‘Alex’’ Sink, who is originally from 
North Carolina, graduated from Wake Forest 
University with a degree in mathematics. Alex 
taught at girls’ schools in Liberia and Sierra 
Leone before launching her career in banking 
and in politics. 
Former Governor Lawton Chiles appointed 
Alex to the Commission on Government Ac-
countability to the People, and later to the 
Commission on Education. In 2006, she was 
elected as Florida’s Chief Financial Officer, 
becoming the first—and, to date, the only— 
woman to hold this cabinet-level position. On 
August 24, 2010, Alex won the Democratic pri-
mary for governor and launched an historic 
campaign. Throughout her career in public 
service, Alex has proven herself to be a com-
pelling advocate for affordable health care, 
non-discriminatory adoption placement prac-
tices, and reproductive justice. 
Alex has continued to positively impact Flor-
ida as a mentor and community activist. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring

HONORING THE CAREER OF MIKE 
DANVERS 
HON. PETE STAUBER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to honor the career of Wadena broadcast leg-
end, Mike Danvers, who is retiring after forty 
years in the radio industry. His last show was 
today, May 28, 2021. 
Mike moved to Wadena, Minnesota in the 
Fall of 1984 and has been with KWAD–AM, 
KNSP–AM and the Superstation K106 ever 
since. Most recently, Mike was the morning 
show host for the Superstation and grew a 
strong base of listeners and fans along the 
way. He is beloved in Wadena and the sur-
rounding communities that make up the 
Superstation K106 listening area. 
However, he is not just known as the man 
on the morning radio. Mike is especially pas-
sionate about high school wrestling and 
coached wrestling in the Wadena area for 22 
years. He has broadcasted live from 23 Min-
nesota State High School League Wrestling 
Tournaments and called play-by-play for hun-
dreds of high schools sporting events. 
Mike has been a friend and mentor to doz-
ens of young broadcasters, and his legacy will 
continue through the lives of everyone he has 
touched throughout his time in the Wadena 
community. 
Mike is the epitome of a true broadcaster. 
While we will miss him on the airwaves every 
morning, we wish him nothing but the best in 
his retirement.

ISLANDER HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 28, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, each year we 
come together to recognize May as Asian 
American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 
Month, in celebration of the critical participa-
tion of our Asian American, Native Hawaiian 
and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) communities in 
our national story. 
Over the past year, the pandemic has high-
lighted the harsh disparities that too many in 
the AANHPI community face across several 
issues, including access to health care, edu-
cation and more. Our nation has also seen an 
unprecedented rise in hate-driven violence 
against Asian Americans. As Congressman 
from Hawai’i, the state with the highest per-
centage of Asian Americans in our country, I 
stand in full solidarity with all in the AANHPI 
community in confronting, condemning and 
overcoming this desecration of that story. 
My own mentor, U.S. Congressman and 
Senator Spark Matsunaga, understood that 
the way forward amongst all peoples was not 
through violence or discrimination, but through 
peace, education and understanding. He and 
his generation of Asian Americans in the 
World War II era prevailed through extreme 
hardship to live the belief that peace and 
equality are not just ideas and aspirations but 
achievable reality. 
In my home state of Hawai’i, we have been 
blessed with so many AANHPI leaders whose 
actions continue to guide us. Senator Matsu-
naga’s legacy lives on in the U.S. Institute of 
Peace, which he created through an act of 
Congress in 1984. Congresswoman Patsy 
Mink’s Title IX legislation is the foundation of 
equal opportunity in our schools. The songs 
Queen Lili’uokalani wrote are beloved memo-
rials to the perseverance of Hawaiian culture. 
This July, we will celebrate the 100th anniver-
sary of the enactment of Prince Jonah Ku¯hio¯ 
Kalaniana‘ole’s Hawaiian Homes Commission 
Act, which helped return the Native Hawaiian 
people to the land that holds such deep an-
cestral, cultural and spiritual significance. 
Through these leaders and their successors, 
we see that despite generations of hardship 
and trial, AANHPI communities are standing 
strong and have led the charge to make our 
country better. 
To AANHPIs everywhere and especially the 
close to 80 percent of my own constituents 
whose heritage lies in Asia and the Pacific, I 
am truly honored to elevate your voices in the 
halls of Congress and understand that a single 
month of remembrance is not enough. There 
is far more to be done, as a community, as a 
state and as a nation. 
This May, in our 29th year of observing 
AANHPI month, I urge all of my fellow Ameri-
cans to listen to the lessons of our past so we 
may act in the present to pave the way for our 
future.
