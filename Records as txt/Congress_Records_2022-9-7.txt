sion and resume consideration of the 
following nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of John Z. Lee, of 
Illinois, to be United States Circuit 
Judge for the Seventh Circuit. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, our 
democracy cannot hope to hang to-
gether for very long without a trusted, 
balanced, and fairminded Judiciary. As 
we have seen in stark and frightful 
ways in recent months, the men and 
women who preside from the bench 
hold immense power over our Nation’s 
destiny and over our people’s liberties. 
When it comes to nominating people 
to the bench, it is imperative that we 
get it right. So, today, the Senate will 
continue its duty to advance President 
Biden’s highly qualified, highly di-
verse, and highly accomplished judicial 
nominees. 
We will begin this afternoon by vot-
ing on the confirmation of Judge John 
Lee to serve as circuit judge for the 
Seventh Circuit. If confirmed, Judge 
Lee will make history as the first 
Asian American ever to preside on the 
Seventh Circuit, joining the proud 
company of other Biden nominees who 
are making our courts more reflective 
of our country. 
I expect Judge Lee to receive bipar-
tisan support and his record certainly 
merits it. He has already been con-
firmed by this Chamber when ap-
pointed to serve as district judge 
roughly a decade ago. Over the course 
of his tenure, Judge Lee has authored 
over 800 opinions, while being reversed 
only 11 times.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4452 
September 7, 2022 
Later today, the Senate will vote to 
advance the nomination of another 
outstanding individual, Andre Mathis, 
to serve as circuit judge for the Sixth 
Circuit. Mr. Mathis would be the first 
Black man confirmed to the Sixth Cir-
cuit in nearly a quarter of a century 
and the first to hail from Tennessee. 
Growing up, Mr. Mathis knew what it 
was like to go days without food, 
water, or heating, and yet, despite im-
mense adversity, he was the first in his 
family to attend college and graduate 
from law school with honors. He spent 
over 15 years in private practice and 
has an extensive pro bono record. If 
confirmed, I am confident Mr. Mathis 
would make an excellent circuit court 
judge. 
Confirming judges will continue to be 
a very top priority for the Senate in 
the days and weeks and months to 
come. Last night, I filed cloture on two 
additional 
circuit 
nominees 
which 
Members can expect to begin voting on 
as soon as Thursday. 
Now, I want to take a moment—a 
moment—to emphasize how far Senate 
Democrats have come in keeping our 
promise to bring balance back to the 
Federal bench, which under President 
Trump skewed dramatically to the 
hard right. To date, Senate Democrats 
have confirmed 76 Federal judges, far 
more than the number confirmed at 
this point in President Trump’s Presi-
dency. In fact, we have confirmed more 
judges than either President Trump or 
President Obama did this far into their 
administrations. 
In a dramatic break from the past, 75 
percent of these nominees have been 
women, half of them women of color. 
That is a figure, I dare say, that has 
never been seen before when it comes 
to judicial nominees. 
We are going to continue prioritizing 
judges moving forward. We cannot let 
the judiciary succumb to the hard 
right because, as we have seen, the con-
sequences are devastating to the Amer-
ican people. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. President, on Democratic results, 
the Inflation Reduction Act was signed 
into law less than a month ago and al-
ready the verdict is in. Our bill is al-
ready creating new investments, new 
jobs, new opportunities for American 
families—jobs here in America, not 
overseas. 
Let me repeat the good news. The In-
flation Reduction Act that every Re-
publican voted against is already deliv-
ering for our country. 
This morning, the New York Times 
reported that in the wake of the Infla-
tion Reduction Act, a whole host of 
companies ‘‘have announced a series of 
big-ticket projects to produce the kind 
of technology the legislation aims to 
promote.’’ 
For example, companies like Toyota 
have announced billions in new invest-
ments to start manufacturing batteries 
for electric and hybrid vehicles right 
here in America. Elsewhere, the com-
pany First Solar announced a $1 billion 
investment to build new solar manu-
facturing facilities in the Southeast. 
Their CEO is explicit that their deci-
sion hinged in large part on our legisla-
tion, saying it provided ‘‘a level of clar-
ity’’ that made investment in the 
United States the right move. 
The examples go on. Honda and LG 
Energy also recently announced over $4 
billion for EV battery production in 
the United States. Panasonic, which 
supplies parts to Tesla’s EV produc-
tion, said they are also considering $4 
billion to build another EV battery 
plant. And thanks to tax incentives we 
passed recently that specifically re-
ward 
domestic 
battery 
production, 
Samsung has decided to accelerate 
plans to break ground on their own EV 
battery plant in the next few months 
in the United States. 
These are just a few examples of how 
the Inflation Reduction Act is already 
delivering on its promise to create 
countless new jobs and ignite billions 
in private sector investment and pave 
the way for America to lead the future 
with cheap and reliable clean energy. 
Had we not done this, these plants 
probably would have been built, most 
of them overseas. As electric vehicles 
become predominant throughout our 
country and the world, America would 
have lost out. We led the world in auto 
production in the 20th century, and be-
cause of this act and what Democrats, 
without a single Republican vote, have 
done, we are going to lead in the 21st 
century as well. 
It is exciting and gratifying to know 
that millions of Americans will be em-
ployed in good-paying jobs, in jobs that 
have a real future. 
All of this is the result of Democratic 
leadership keeping its promise to the 
American people. Again, I have to say, 
this kind of thing used to happen when 
Democrats and Republicans came to-
gether. It is shameful that not a single 
Republican voted with us to pass these 
investments—not one. 
And, of course, I would also be remiss 
not to highlight all the ways that the 
CHIPS and Science Act is sparking a 
new wave of investment as well. Just 
recently, the CEO of Micron announced 
a $15 billion investment in manufac-
turing last week, saying that the 
CHIPS and Science Act ‘‘made this in-
vestment decision possible.’’ 
And Micron has committed to signifi-
cantly more and even larger invest-
ments to come, I am happy to say. 
When you pass good legislation, you 
get good results. 
It has been a long time, sadly, since 
the American people have felt that 
Washington is capable of doing big 
things to meet big challenges. After 4 
years where President Trump spent all 
of his time, it seems, just being nasty 
and negative and calling people names 
but never making promises and never 
getting anything concrete done, Demo-
crats are actually delivering with real 
results. 
Senate Democrats have shown that 
with the right people in office, govern-
ment can work to promote, not hinder, 
the well-being and security of the 
American people. It is why we took on 
Big Pharma and won. It is why we took 
on entrenched oil interests and won. It 
is why we took on the NRA and beat 
them by passing the first gun safety 
law in decades. And all of this is the re-
sult of Democrats following through on 
our promise. 
While the junior Senator from Flor-
ida continues to promote tax hikes for 
working families and putting Medicare 
on the chopping block, Democrats want 
to cut costs for families, increase pros-
perity, continue to strengthen ladders 
for people to get into the middle class 
and give them the stability to say that, 
once they are there, they are going to 
stay there. 
Democrats have given America hope 
in the future, that in the new indus-
tries and new ways of thinking and new 
sciences, we are going to lead, not fol-
low, not lag behind, not spend time, as 
President Trump did most of his time, 
playing petty political games and 
never getting anything done. We are 
getting stuff done—big stuff, important 
stuff, stuff that gives us a brighter fu-
ture. That is why we work so hard to 
pass our agenda and, already, it is clear 
the American people are feeling the 
benefits. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
Washington 
Democrats 
have 
spent 
nearly 2 years—2 years—borrowing, 
printing, and spending our economy 
into turmoil. Families and businesses 
across Middle America are paying the 
price. I met with many of them in my 
home State of Kentucky over the past 
few weeks. 
Since President Biden took office, 
prices in the Commonwealth have 
spiked by 13 percent. At the same time, 
we still have 19,000 fewer workers than 
before the pandemic. 
During a meeting with the Kentucky 
Association of Manufacturers in Louis-
ville, I heard directly from employers 
who 
would, 
under 
different 
cir-
cumstances, be powering our recovery. 
Instead, many are struggling to find 
enough workers to meet consumer de-
mand. 
In Hopkinsville, I spoke to farmers 
who have watched the price of energy 
skyrocket, raising the cost of every-
thing from fuel to fertilizer. As a re-
sult, all Americans are paying higher 
prices at the grocery store. 
While Eastern Kentucky struggles to 
recover from devastating floods, supply

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4453 
September 7, 2022 
chain issues and the increased cost of 
building materials are hamstringing 
the repair process and making it even 
harder to rebuild. 
I am sure my Democratic colleagues 
heard similar stories during their own 
August travel. Kentuckians aren’t the 
only Americans feeling pinched. 
The official inflation numbers con-
firmed that yet again just after the 
Senate adjourned last month—a fifth 
straight month of inflation above 8 per-
cent. Inflated gas prices, inflated util-
ity bills, the worst explosion in grocery 
costs since 1979—these are the painful 
effects of Democrats’ reckless spend-
ing. 
Americans keep communicating over 
and over and over that runaway costs 
are their top concern, and they didn’t 
like what President Biden and his 
party are doing about it. 
Ah, but amazingly, just a few days 
before 
the 
latest 
inflation 
report, 
Democrats had just pushed through 
hundreds of billions of dollars more in 
liberal waste on a party-line basis. 
Democrats packed their bill with an 
environmentalist wish list that won’t 
even affect climate. They sold it—lis-
ten to this—as an Inflation Reduction 
Act even though experts found it would 
do absolutely nothing meaningful to 
reduce inflation. They did find room 
for massive, job-killing tax hikes that 
will hit manufacturing especially hard 
and kill jobs on the brink of a possible 
recession. 
It is not getting any easier to put 
food on the table, pay rent, or even 
keep the lights on, but here we are 
again, starting another Senate work 
period with not one word from the 
Democratic leader about plans to bring 
bills to the floor to cut inflation, fight 
the crimewave, or secure the border. 
The American people have commu-
nicated loud and clear what their prior-
ities are, and Democrats keep commu-
nicating loud and clear they simply do 
not care. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
Mr. President, now on another mat-
ter, inflation is not the only way the 
last 2 years have shown that bad poli-
cies and bad ideas have real con-
sequences. One especially damaging 
myth is the liberal notion that making 
our 
country 
kinder 
means 
having 
weaker public safety, weaker justice 
for criminals, and weaker borders. This 
misunderstanding dominates today’s 
Democratic Party. 
Across our country, Democrats have 
spent years—years—trying to defund 
law enforcement. Studies have proven 
that anti-police hostility changes how 
officers do their jobs, leading directly 
to more crime, including more mur-
ders. So liberals’ nationwide anti-po-
lice PR campaign has literally cost 
people their lives. 
When liberals do let police arrest 
criminals, a growing cadre of far-left 
prosecutors often simply declines to 
charge them. One liberal millionaire 
has donated more than a million dol-
lars each to the campaigns of soft-on- 
crime district attorneys in New York, 
Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Chi-
cago. 
The Los Angeles DA has presided 
over a 69-percent increase in shootings 
and a 40-percent spike in car thefts. 
Chicago’s liberal DA ‘‘appeared to be 
simply dropping nearly 30 percent of all 
felony 
cases, 
including’’—listen 
to 
this—‘‘alleged 
murders.’’ 
Philadel-
phia’s liberal DA has presided over an 
85-percent spike in shootings and a 
huge increase in murders since he took 
over. 
In the name of equity or compassion, 
these people are announcing they will 
not prosecute entire categories of 
crimes. No wonder American cities are 
becoming more dangerous by the day. 
A couple years back, a former DA 
from outside Boston published a list of 
crimes she would not prosecute: shop-
lifting, breaking and entering, resist-
ing arrest, and, even in the middle of 
the opioid crisis, possession with intent 
to distribute. As a reward, Washington 
Democrats made Rachel Rollins the 
U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. She 
got a promotion. 
Just last month, Senator RUBIO put 
forward an amendment to increase 
funding for cops and keeping violent 
criminals 
behind 
bars. 
Democrats 
blocked it. 
Every Senate Democrat has also 
voted multiple times to strip Customs 
and Border Protection of the only re-
maining emergency authorities to con-
tend with the historic surge in illegal 
immigration unfolding on their watch. 
Of course, the open-door policies our 
colleagues support in office are rooted 
in open-border rhetoric that they have 
embraced literally for years. 
On the campaign trail, then-Can-
didate Biden himself said, ‘‘You want 
to flee . . . you should come.’’ So on 
President Biden’s watch, illegal immi-
grants 
flocked—literally 
flocked—to 
the border, some carrying his cam-
paign’s flags and T-shirts. 
There is an outright security crisis 
at our southern border. We are in the 
middle of the most illegal immigration 
arrests in more than two decades. This 
year, just January to August, Border 
Patrol says they have already run into 
nearly double the number of known 
criminals this fiscal year as they saw 
in the entire year—entire year—before 
President Biden took office and huge, 
huge upticks of deadly drugs like 
fentanyl. 
But Democrats aren’t just ignoring a 
security crisis; it is a humanitarian 
crisis as well. Waves of unaccompanied 
children have stretched Border Patrol’s 
facilities to the limit. Under incom-
petent leadership, the Department of 
Health and Human Services has had to 
scramble to help ensure the safety of 
children in its custody. 
There is nothing—nothing—compas-
sionate about tolerating or even en-
couraging anarchy down at the border, 
violence in our streets, and a steady 
erosion of public safety. It is neither 
fair, nor is it compassionate, not to 
any Americans, least of all to the vul-
nerable people Democrats say—say— 
they are helping. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, some-
times around here, in what a lot of peo-
ple refer to as the ‘‘ivory tower,’’ we 
talk about issues like they are abstract 
issues, like they don’t have any real 
world effect. And I just wanted to 
touch on something, before I begin on 
my other subject here today, which is 
related to recent information that has 
been put out by the Department of Ag-
riculture, the USDA’s Economic Re-
search Service, which is the arm that 
does projections on the economy and 
the farm economy, generally. What 
they are now concluding is that in 2022, 
there are going to be record cash re-
ceipts—record cash receipts—crop pro-
duction, livestock production—record 
levels, 14-percent higher year over 
year. But what they go on to say is 
that even with record cash receipts up 
by 14 percent, net cash farm income is 
going to be down. Net cash farm in-
come is going to be down by 1 percent. 
Why is that? Well, because if you 
look at what has increased, increased 
costs on farmers in this country, they 
have reached some record levels. If you 
look at, for example, fertilizer. Farm-
ers will spend 84 percent more, or $21 
billion more, on fertilizers than they 
did in 2020; 65 percent, or nearly $8 bil-
lion, more on fuel and oil; and more 
than $18 billion more on feed for live-
stock. Then you add in, on top of that, 
debt, which, for a farm operation, obvi-
ously, they are a very debt-intensive 
operation. So with higher interest 
rates and record farm debt of $496 bil-
lion, that is expected to increase inter-
est payments by 37 percent, or more 
than $7 billion, from 2020, or 2 years 
ago. 
So my point, simply, is that, at least 
in my part of the country, with corn, 
soybeans, wheat, livestock, and cattle 
prices expected to go up in record num-
bers in terms of overall gross farm in-
come—gross cash receipts—that you 
would think would lead to good times 
in American agriculture, because of in-
flation, a 14-percent increase in gross 
cash receipts is going to result in an 
actual loss, a reduction year over year 
from 2021, when it comes to inflation- 
adjusted net farm income. 
So I make that point simply to illus-
trate how critical it is that, as policy-
makers, we acknowledge what is hap-
pening in the real world, because I 
think around here the Biden adminis-
tration tries to downplay this inflation 
issue like it is a nonissue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4454 
September 7, 2022 
It is a real issue. It is hitting the 
pocketbooks of every American in this 
country to the tune 81⁄2 to 9 percent for 
a family. I said this before, but the 
analysis is out there. For an average 
family in this country, you are talking 
about, year over year to buy the same 
basket of goods you bought last year, 
an additional $9,000 over last year—$700 
and some per month, year-over-year, 
month-over-month increases in costs 
for average families in this country. 
That is a $9,000 tax increase on every 
family in this country. 
Now, it is borne arguably more easily 
by people in high-income categories, 
but if you are a working family who is 
trying to make ends meet and is put-
ting more and more on your credit card 
or dipping into savings—and there are 
more and more people in this country. 
I just saw this number yesterday where 
one out of every six Americans now is 
behind in their utility payments. There 
are people living paycheck to pay-
check, and inflation is killing them. 
And it is like this administration has a 
blind eye to that and wants to talk 
about a lot of other issues. And I can 
see why, because this is an issue I 
would not want to have to take respon-
sibility for. 
In many respects, all the spending— 
all the spending pushed through here, 
advocated by the President—the $2 tril-
lion last year, the American Rescue 
Plan, and just in the last month, an-
other $750 billion in spending and 
taxes, and the heavy-handed regula-
tion, the shutdown of oil and gas pro-
duction in this country, which drives 
up the cost of energy and which is re-
flected, as I pointed out, in a lot of 
these numbers—if you look at the fuel 
costs year over year, you actually have 
a situation in American agriculture 
today where you have record gross cash 
receipts and a reduction in inflation- 
adjusted net income. That is the im-
pact of inflation. 
STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF PLAN 
Mr. President, 8 days—8 days—that is 
how long it took President Biden to 
completely erase any of the supposed 
deficit reduction included in the Demo-
crats’ so-called Inflation Reduction 
Act. 
On August 24, 8 days after signing the 
Inflation 
Reduction 
Act 
into 
law, 
President Biden announced that, with 
the stroke of his pen, he would be for-
giving $10,000 in student loan debt, 
$20,000 for Pell grant recipients, and 
taking other costly measures on stu-
dent loans. 
The Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget, which, incidentally, is 
where Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen 
served prior to joining the Biden ad-
ministration, estimates that, all to-
gether, the President’s student loan 
changes will cost anywhere from $440 
billion to $600 billion over the next dec-
ade. The Penn Wharton Budget Model 
suggests it could be even worse than 
that, with the total cost over 10 years 
exceeding $1 trillion. 
Now, even using the most optimistic 
assumptions, the Inflation Reduction 
Act would have only reduced the def-
icit by about $300 billion. President 
Biden’s student loan plan will wipe out 
every single dime of that reduction and 
then add hundreds of billions of dollars 
to the debt on top of it—so much for 
the Democrats’ commitment to reduc-
ing the deficit, which, I think, was a 
hoax in the first place. 
There wasn’t any serious commit-
ment to it, but it only took them 8 
days—8 days—to wipe it out after they 
crowed about it and talked about how 
they got JOE MANCHIN on board because 
he made a commitment to deficit re-
duction, which was something he sup-
posedly insisted on in these discus-
sions. And yet here we are. Eight 
days—in 8 days it is gone. 
Now, I have already noted that the 
Committee for a Responsible Federal 
Budget estimates that the President’s 
student loan measures will cost a stag-
gering half a trillion dollars over the 
next decade. Here is what else the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et had to say: 
The student debt cancellation and relief 
measures announced . . . by the Biden ad-
ministration . . . would meaningfully boost 
inflation. 
‘‘Would meaningfully boost infla-
tion’’—that is right. Americans have 
spent the majority of the Biden admin-
istration struggling with huge in-
creases in the price of everything from 
gas to groceries, and the President just 
imposed by fiat a new policy that is 
likely to ‘‘meaningfully boost infla-
tion.’’ 
I guess it isn’t surprising. After all, 
it is thanks in large part to the Demo-
crats and the President that we ended 
up with this inflation crisis in the first 
place. 
As I mentioned earlier, their reckless 
American Rescue Plan spending spree 
flooded the country with unnecessary 
money and the economy overheated as 
a result. But the President’s latest 
reckless action underscores just how 
committed Democrats are to big-spend-
ing and big-government agenda. 
Now, Democrats tried to suggest that 
they had gotten serious about the 
economy with their so-called Inflation 
Reduction Act, even though the bill 
was only serious about spending tax-
payer dollars on ill-considered prior-
ities like their Green New Deal agenda. 
But the fact—the fact—that it took the 
President exactly 8 days to wipe out 
any deficit reduction from the Demo-
crats’ bill tells you all you need to 
know about exactly how serious Demo-
crats are about handling taxpayer dol-
lars responsibly. 
Now, I have talked for a while about 
why the President’s student loan plans 
are such bad economic policy, but you 
don’t have to take my word for it. Here 
is what former Obama economic ad-
viser Jason Furman had to say about 
President Biden’s student loan plans: 
Pouring roughly half [a] trillion dollars of 
gasoline on the inflationary fire that already 
is burning is reckless. Doing it while going 
well beyond one campaign promise, [which is 
$10,000] of student loan relief, and breaking 
another, [which is that] all proposals [have 
to be] paid for, is even worse. 
That is from Obama economic ad-
viser Jason Furman. 
Another former Obama economic ad-
viser noted: 
Student loan debt relief is spending that 
raises demand and increases inflation. . . . It 
will also tend to be inflationary by raising 
tuitions. 
Well, there are even some current 
Democrat Members of Congress that 
have expressed their concerns about 
the President’s reckless student loan 
decision. And the president of the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et, which, I mentioned, is where Presi-
dent Biden’s very own Treasury Sec-
retary once served on the board, issued 
a scathing statement in which she said: 
This announcement is gallingly reckless— 
with the national debt approaching record 
levels and inflation surging, it will make 
both worse. . . . It would do nothing to actu-
ally make education more affordable, and if 
anything, this policy will drive up tuition 
costs while raising prices on a variety of 
other goods and services for ordinary Ameri-
cans. 
This is from the Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget, which is 
where the President’s own Treasury 
Secretary used to serve. 
Let me repeat that: ‘‘while raising 
prices on a variety of other goods and 
services for ordinary Americans.’’ 
Well, as the Washington Post edi-
torial board noted, American taxpayers 
will be footing the bill for the Presi-
dent’s student loan decision. Ordinary 
Americans will pay in the form of high-
er prices. They will pay in the form of 
higher rates on loans and mortgages, 
and they will pay in the form of higher 
tuition costs. 
The majority of Americans do not 
have student loan debt, either because 
they paid off their loans, never went to 
college, got a scholarship, or worked 
their way through college or were able 
to go thanks to their or their parents’ 
savings. Now these Americans are 
going to be footing the bill for the 13 
percent of Americans who do have stu-
dent loan debt. Everyone is going to 
have to suffer economically to provide 
loan forgiveness for the few. 
This is deeply, deeply unfair. It is un-
fair to expect Americans who either 
never went to college, paid off their 
loans, or paid their way through to 
shoulder the cost of other Americans’ 
loans. 
The President’s decision is unfair to 
parents who scrimped and saved to 
send their children to college, rep-
resenting a lot of American families; to 
the students who chose a lower cost 
college or worked to put themselves 
through; to the men and women in uni-
form in the military who fought for 
this country to earn money for their 
college education; and to the families 
struggling with high grocery bills and 
high energy bills and high rent prices 
who are likely to end up facing even 
more price increases, thanks to the 
President’s student loan decisions.

S4455 
September 7, 2022 
And let’s remember that taxpayers 
are going to be facing economic hard-
ship to pay off student loans for Ameri-
cans who, if they graduated from col-
lege, enjoy greater long-term earning 
potential than many of the Americans 
who will be helping to shoulder the 
burden for their debts. 
The President’s plan isn’t even tar-
geted to the most needy, with families 
making $250,000 a year—nearly 10 times 
the poverty line for a family of 4—now 
eligible to have their loans forgiven. 
There is no doubt that the cost of a 
college 
education 
has 
risen 
out-
rageously and that, in some cases, stu-
dents have been encouraged to take on 
unrealistic levels of debt to pay for it, 
but the President’s student loan plan 
does absolutely nothing to fix these 
problems. 
The President’s plan will not only do 
nothing to control the cost of a college 
education, it will almost undoubtedly 
make our current situation worse. 
What college is going to spend time 
worrying about lowering tuition fees if 
it can expect the Federal Government 
to pick up part of the bill for its stu-
dents’ educations? 
The President’s plan will also do 
nothing to discourage students from 
taking on unrealistic levels of debt. In 
fact, it is likely to encourage students 
to incur even more debt since the 
President has now set up an expecta-
tion that the government will step in 
to help pay down students’ loan bur-
dens. 
Given the fact that student loan debt 
is expected to be back to its current 
level in 6 years, I imagine we will be 
hearing more Democratic calls for stu-
dent loan forgiveness in the very near 
future. In fact, some Members of the 
Democratic Party already think the 
President didn’t go far enough. More 
than one Democrat wanted the Presi-
dent to forgive $50,000 in debt. Now, ap-
parently, these Democrats won’t be 
satisfied until our economy drowns en-
tirely under the weight of reckless gov-
ernment spending. 
The defining achievement of the 
Biden administration so far has been 
an economy that has left millions of 
Americans struggling to make ends 
meet. Apparently, the President wants 
that to be his legacy because, for the 
sake of a few possible votes in Novem-
ber, he has decided to pursue yet an-
other economic policy that will almost 
undoubtedly result in further economic 
pain for the American people. 
Now he will just have to hope that 
his strategy doesn’t backfire because, 
while his reckless student loan plan 
may buy him a vote or two, a lot of 
other Americans may decide that they 
have had their fill of inflationary 
spending and far-left appeasement. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, since 
President Biden took office on January 
20, 2021, he has willfully ignored what 
has been happening at our southern 
border. The President and leaders of 
his administration try to convince peo-
ple that what they were seeing with 
their eyes was not a crisis but was 
merely a challenge. When that flopped, 
they attempted to blame the previous 
administration for the flood of human-
ity coming across the southern border, 
even though the immigration surge has 
now reached epic proportions since 
President Biden took office. 
Now, once again, they appear to be 
ignoring the problem altogether. We 
have had 17 months with more than 
150,000 illegal border crossings each 
month—17 months, 150,000 migrants 
each month—and the Biden adminis-
tration seems to be saying: What is the 
problem? Their decision, apparently, is 
to stay the course. 
What little attention there has been 
to the impact on the border crisis tends 
to focus, though, solely on the mi-
grants, and, of course, that is part of 
the concern. No one is suggesting that 
we treat them with disrespect or in an 
inhumane manner. In fact, just the 
contrary is true. We know that people 
coming into the country outside of the 
legal immigration system endure a 
brutal journey just to get here. They 
pay thousands of dollars to cartels and 
coyotes—or 
human 
smugglers—and 
often the women and girls are raped 
and abused. Migrants who slow down 
the coyotes will be abandoned and fre-
quently left to die. We see that particu-
larly 
in 
South 
Texas 
around 
the 
Falfurrias checkpoint, where we see 
the migrants coming across the river. 
Then they are put in stash houses in 
inhumane conditions and then driven 
north 
through 
the 
Border 
Patrol 
checkpoints. But because of their fear 
of being discovered, the coyotes tell 
them: Get out of the vehicle and walk 
around the checkpoint and meet us on 
the north side to continue our journey. 
The problem is, this time of year, the 
weather and temperatures are brutal. 
Frequently, ranchers in Brooks Coun-
ty, which is the county where the 
Falfurrias checkpoint is located, find 
the bones of migrants who did not 
make it or otherwise dead bodies. 
Migrants are certainly the face of the 
Biden border crisis, but they are not 
the only ones being hurt by the failure 
of the administration to deal with this 
crisis. When thousands of people a day 
illegally cross our border, it impacts 
our entire border security apparatus. 
We are seeing unprecedented numbers 
of people showing up at the border, and 
unfortunately it is part of a plan to 
overwhelm the capacity of law enforce-
ment to deal with these numbers. This 
is part of a business model of the drug 
cartels. Flood the border with mi-
grants. Distract the Border Patrol, who 
have to leave the frontlines to trans-
port, process, and care for the mi-
grants, creating huge security gaps. 
There is no question that the cartels 
and criminal organizations are exploit-
ing those gaps to traffic dangerous 
drugs. They are bringing across heroin, 
methamphetamine, 
cocaine, 
mari-
juana—name your poison. 
The truth is, these transnational 
criminal 
organizations—sometimes 
called cartels—are commodity-agnos-
tic. They are in it for the money, and 
they will sell anything or anybody to 
make money. 
But without a doubt, the most alarm-
ing drug that is crossing the border 
today is fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. 
Last year, the Biden administration 
may have not noticed, but 108,000 
Americans died of drug overdoses last 
year alone, and the vast majority of 
those drugs came across the southern 
border because of the business model I 
just described. The majority of those 
deaths involve synthetic opioids like 
fentanyl. Fentanyl is especially dan-
gerous because as little as 2 milligrams 
can be deadly. That is a lethal dose 
that fits on the tip of a sharpened pen-
cil. 
Customs 
and 
Border 
Protection 
doesn’t track fentanyl seizures by mil-
ligrams, although it logs them in 
pounds. Since October last year, Cus-
toms and Border Protection has seized 
more than 10,600 pounds of fentanyl. 
And, no, they didn’t get it all; that is 
just what they were able to interdict 
and seize. But that 10,600 pounds of 
fentanyl is more than 2.4 billion lethal 
doses—enough to wipe out the entire 
U.S. population more than 7 times 
over. 
You would think this would be a 
matter of serious concern for the ad-
ministration, an operation which uses 
migrants to distract law enforcement 
from being able to interdict a dan-
gerous drug coming into the United 
States and taking tens of thousands of 
Americans’ 
lives, 
but, 
frankly, 
it 
hasn’t even registered any kind of reac-
tion by the administration. 
The good news is, thanks to the hard- 
working Customs and Border Protec-
tion officers, those 10,600 pounds of 
fentanyl never ended up on our streets 
or in our local communities, but the 
bad news is, there is a whole lot more 
where that came from. 
Cartels exploit the security gaps 
across the border to smuggle drugs into 
our country. While the first stop may 
be Texas or another State along the 
southern border, these products don’t 
stop there; they are quickly distributed 
by networks of criminal gangs across 
America to every community—not just 
cities but rural communities as well. 
Fentanyl poses a unique danger be-
cause not only is it incredibly potent, 
but it is also a lot cheaper than these 
other drugs. Illicit drug makers will 
lace substances with fentanyl to cut 
expenses and to hook the user, and 
buyers often have no idea what they 
are actually getting.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4456 
September 7, 2022 
This is a big problem in Texas but 
not just in my State but across the 
country. But we have seen a surge of 
fentanyl-related deaths in my State. 
Last year, more than 1,700 Texans died 
from fentanyl overdoses, and we con-
tinue to see the heartbreaking toll this 
drug is having on communities of every 
size. Cities across the State have expe-
rienced strings of overdose deaths like-
ly tied to batches of drugs laced with 
fentanyl. 
There is no single profile to describe 
the victims of these fentanyl deaths 
that cover every age, every demo-
graphic, and every walk of life, but one 
of the most concerning trends we have 
seen is a spike in teenage overdose 
deaths. 
Nationwide, 77 percent—77 percent— 
of all teen overdose deaths last year in-
volved fentanyl. Fentanyl is, believe it 
or not, the leading cause of death of 
Americans between the ages of 18 and 
45—a 
shocking 
statistic. 
Teenagers 
may think they are buying prescrip-
tion opioids—things like OxyContin or 
some other drug—but they may be un-
knowingly taking drugs that contain a 
deadly dose of fentanyl in addition. 
One Texas community is feeling the 
devastation of this situation at an al-
most unimaginable degree. In Hays 
County, situated just southwest of Aus-
tin, 21⁄2 weeks ago, only days into the 
new school year, a 15-year-old high 
school sophomore died from a sus-
pected fentanyl overdose. Sadly, this 
wasn’t the first death in the Hays Con-
solidated Independent School District. 
It wasn’t even the second. In 1 month’s 
time, this school district lost three 
students to fentanyl-related overdoses. 
The other two students were both sen-
iors. We are talking about young peo-
ple who are at the starting point in 
their lives. They have endless potential 
and an army of people who want to see 
them succeed and live happy, produc-
tive, and successful lives, but that 
human potential is lost because this 
deadly drug has made its way into our 
country, into our communities, and 
into our schools. 
But Texas isn’t the only State con-
fronting a wave of fentanyl overdoses. 
A few weeks ago, a woman in Colorado 
found her 13-year-old grandson, Jose, 
leaning over the bathroom sink, unre-
sponsive. Jose’s family said he had no 
history of illicit drug use, and they be-
lieve he received a pill from someone 
on his way home from school. That pill 
contained enough fentanyl to kill this 
energetic eighth grader who had his en-
tire life ahead of him. 
Sadly, this is an all-too-familiar 
story. Earlier this summer, a 15- 
month-old toddler in Georgia died after 
being exposed to fentanyl. The same 
thing happened recently in California, 
also to a 15-month-old infant. 
Law enforcement in big cities and 
small towns alike have seen a spike in 
arrests and overdoses connected to 
fentanyl. The problem has gotten so 
bad that a number of major cities, in-
cluding Las Vegas, San Diego, and New 
York, have installed vending machines 
to 
distribute 
lifesaving 
shots 
of 
Narcan, 
which 
is 
an 
antidote 
to 
fentanyl overdoses—vending machines 
on the city streets of an antidote for 
fentanyl because the problem has be-
come so pervasive. This is a crisis fac-
ing everyone from toddlers to teens to 
adults of all ages. 
Last year, more than 71,000 Ameri-
cans died from a fentanyl overdose. 
That is 71,000 out of the 108,000 drug 
overdose deaths that I mentioned a mo-
ment ago. Given the rate at which 
fentanyl is coming into the United 
States, I fear the worst is still to come. 
Drug cartels are taking advantage of 
the security gaps at the border and 
going to extreme lengths to boost their 
sales. For example, last month, the 
Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration 
seized brightly-colored fentanyl tablets 
in 18 States. Children appear to be the 
target demographic for what the DEA 
is calling rainbow fentanyl. They are 
small, colorful pills that look like 
candy, as well as pressed blocks of pow-
der that look like sidewalk chalk. 
Mexican drug cartels and others have 
turned a dangerous and deadly drug 
into something that any child would be 
quick to pick up. 
No, there is no question there is a 
crisis at the border notwithstanding 
the fact that President Biden and his 
administration have been ignoring it 
for the entire time he has been in of-
fice. It is certainly hurting the mi-
grants, but it is also having a deadly 
impact on the American people. 
Coming from a border State, I have 
visited the border many times, and I 
have spoken often to the officers and 
the agents who are on the frontlines of 
this fight. They know well about how 
the cartels are gaming the system, 
using the migrants to divert and dis-
tract while moving deadly drugs into 
the country. But, frankly, they cannot 
stop this humanitarian crisis on their 
own. They need a change in policy that 
can only come from Congress working 
with the administration. But so far, 
the administration has refused to take 
any steps—any steps at all—to address 
the migrant surge, and so the problem 
continues day after day after day. 
I know the mayors of New York and 
Chicago and Washington, DC, have ex-
pressed concern that migrants are 
being bused to their cities, even though 
they advertise themselves as sanctuary 
cities, but, frankly, I think if that is 
what it takes to get the attention of 
the mayors of those cities, who can 
then hopefully get the attention of 
President Biden and his administra-
tion, that it is worth it. 
Unless something changes, though, 
the 108,000 Americans who lost their 
lives to drug overdoses, including the 
71,000 who lost their lives to fentanyl 
last year, will only go up. More 
fentanyl will come across the border 
and find its way into our communities. 
More cartels and criminal organiza-
tions and street gangs will get rich off 
of our suffering. And more of our chil-
dren, our neighbors, our friends, and 
loved ones will die. 
We often talk about the need for a 
humane response to the border crisis. 
And these conversations largely focus 
on migrant care, and there is no ques-
tion these individuals should be treated 
humanely. But a humane response also 
involves consideration for the impact 
this drug infestation is having on the 
American people. 
By allowing our border to descend 
into chaos, the President may think he 
has taken a humane route, but he is 
sorely mistaken. Families are burying 
their loved ones, children are losing 
their schoolmates, and our country is 
suffering while the cartels get richer 
and richer and richer. 
Until we can get this crisis under 
control, the cartels will continue to 
move drugs across the border and poi-
son our communities. No, an open bor-
der policy is not humane; it is not sus-
tainable; and despite what President 
Biden may think, it is not benefiting 
anyone. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today to report back from a trip 
that Senator PORTMAN and I took to 
Ukraine last week. And the No. 1 thing 
I would like to report is that President 
Zelenskyy personally asked us—and I 
know that Senator PORTMAN addressed 
the Senate last night and reported 
this—but he personally asked us to 
thank the U.S. Senate, to thank the 
people of this country for the generous 
and unending continuing help that the 
Senate has given to Ukraine in their 
fight for democracy. 
This is a country that has given it 
all. Sometimes we wonder, in our own 
country, what are we going to put on 
the line for our democracy? Are we 
going to go over and vote today? How 
much do we care? There, the people of 
Ukraine are putting their lives on the 
line every single day. 
The ballerina who puts on camo and 
goes to the front lines, the exhausted 
workers at the nuclear plant trying to 
protect 
not 
just 
the 
country 
of 
Ukraine, but surrounding countries be-
cause it is the biggest nuclear plant in 
all of Europe, supplying 20 percent of 
the 
electricity 
to 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine. 
They go to work every day, under in-
credible stress and pressure that we 
can’t imagine, trying to keep their 
country safe while surrounded by 500 
Russian troops. We think of the cellist 
playing beautiful melodies on the front 
steps of bombed-out remnants of a

town square to remind people that cul-
ture and love still exist in this coun-
try. 
I think of the mass grave that we vis-
ited in Bucha, in Irpin, the apartment 
buildings after apartment buildings 
burned out, but Ukraine goes on. We 
saw firsthand the strength of the 
Ukrainian people in the face of Vladi-
mir Putin’s inhuman barbarism. But 
just as Putin has shown his true colors, 
so have the people of Ukraine in bril-
liant blue and yellow. Over the past 6 
months since the invasion, their brav-
ery and humanity has consistently 
shone through. 
When Senator PORTMAN and I went to 
Ukraine last January as part of a group 
of Senators—we were the last group 
which went in before the war started, 
with Senators SHAHEEN and MURPHY 
and Senator BLUMENTHAL and Senator 
WICKER and Senator CRAMER—we wit-
nessed the incredible resolve of the 
Ukrainian people. Last week, we saw 
up close a nation defending its home-
land in a way that few expected would 
even be possible. 
We had an excellent hour-long meet-
ing with President Zelenskyy and De-
fense Minister Reznikov and the Presi-
dent’s chief of staff. 
Our country has helped them so 
much. We heard the story of how our 
employees at the Embassy—we now 
have people located in Kyiv—went to 
get some takeout food from a Ukrain-
ian restaurant, and when they got the 
food back, got the bag back, someone, 
not even knowing who they were or 
where they worked but thinking they 
were American, had written on it: 
‘‘Thanks for the HIMARS.’’ 
Along with at least 42 other nations, 
from Japan to South Korea, to Poland, 
we have stood with democracy. We 
have stood with Ukraine. 
We also discussed with President 
Zelenskyy 
the 
counteroffensive 
Ukraine is making to reclaim its terri-
tory in the Kherson region. This was 
one of the first cities Ukraine lost 
when the war began, but we have seen 
some initial signs of success. 
Ukrainians have also announced that 
they have recaptured some villages and 
knocked out weapons and radar sta-
tions and a pontoon bridge the Rus-
sians had built. 
We are working closely with the 
Ukrainians to tailor our security as-
sistance to meet their immediate needs 
on the frontlines of the conflict, some-
thing that was more difficult to do at 
the beginning. Now we actually have 
people back in Kyiv, and we also have 
clear lines of communication with the 
Ukrainian leadership. 
Of course, as I mentioned earlier, the 
situation on the ground remains in-
credibly dangerous, especially in the 
Zaporizhzhia region, home to the larg-
est nuclear plant in Europe, which was 
a central issue that we raised in our 
discussions with Ukrainian leadership. 
The plant, which, as I noted, pre-
viously provided Ukraine with 20 per-
cent of its power, is at significant risk 
because of Russian shelling. 
Just today, Ukraine announced that 
they may have to shut the plant down 
for fear of a nuclear disaster, as this 
skeleton crew constantly has to recon-
nect the lines that have been shelled to 
not only get the power out to Ukrain-
ians, which Russians are trying to di-
vert to their territories—to Russian- 
held territories—to making sure they 
have the power to keep the reactor 
going and safe. 
We called on Russia to establish a de-
militarized zone around the plant and 
to allow the team from the IAEA to in-
spect the plant. We were glad when the 
team of 14 inspectors visited the plant. 
Two inspectors will remain there in-
definitely. This is all happening as we 
speak. 
The IAEA released its report yester-
day and said: 
While the ongoing shelling has not yet 
triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues 
to represent a constant threat of nuclear 
safety and security. 
The agency, which is full of nuclear 
safety experts from around the world, 
noted extensive safety concerns. They 
urged an immediate stop to fighting on 
site and in the vicinity. 
I continue to call for that demili-
tarized zone around the plant. We know 
that this nuclear incident wouldn’t be 
just an incident; it would be a catas-
trophe. 
We all know this is a hard fight, but 
America must continue to stand with 
Ukraine. 
If Vladimir Putin had been allowed 
just to enter their country, take over 
an entire democracy, he would never 
have stopped there. 
We also held a meeting with U.S. 
military leaders at the 101st Airborne 
Division in Poland, who are there to 
underscore our commitment to our 
NATO allies and the defense of Europe. 
They affirmed that the Ukrainians are 
making great use of the weapons we 
have supplied in their fight against 
Russia. 
In addition to the direct support we 
are providing to Ukraine, we are also 
seeing that sanctions are working in 
Russia, as just yesterday, the adminis-
tration reported—our administration— 
that Moscow is in the process of pur-
chasing rockets and artillery shells 
from North Korea. It shows how much 
trouble Russia is in when they are pur-
chasing military equipment from the 
country of North Korea. This type of 
desperate purchase says a lot about the 
state of Russia’s supply chain. 
In fact, we have seen that as Russia 
has attacked Ukraine, its actions have 
been met with almost universal con-
demnation. It was a key factor in Fin-
land and Sweden’s decision to pursue 
NATO membership, a measure we here 
in the Senate supported on the floor 
with a resounding 95-to-1 vote. 
The United States has provided eco-
nomic, military, and humanitarian aid 
since the invasion. Our leadership has 
brought and continues to bring other 
nations to the table and has allowed 
Ukraine to continue to fight for its 
freedom. 
We remember that moment after the 
invasion 
began 
when 
President 
Zelenskyy stood in Kyiv and said the 
simple words: ‘‘We are here.’’ ‘‘We are 
here.’’ That video went viral. ‘‘We are 
here.’’ 
From that moment on, he and his 
people inspired the world—a living 
symbol of courage. So now it is our 
time to assure the Ukrainians, know-
ing that they are up against the evil of 
Vladimir Putin, with the simple words: 
‘‘We are here.’’ 
I yield the floor.

STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF PLAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Oc-
tober 4, 1957. Many in the Chamber 
were not alive at that date. I was. I was 
a teenager, maybe in high school, just 
starting, or at the end of grade school. 
But it was a big day in the history of 
the world, October 4, 1957, because at 
7:28 
p.m. 
at 
night, 
the 
Russians 
launched Sputnik. 
Sputnik was a basketball-size sat-
ellite, and we were concerned because 
we believed the Russians—then the So-
viet Union—had the capacity to drop 
an atomic or nuclear bomb on the 
United States, and if they could do it 
from space, for goodness’ sake, how 
would we defend ourselves? 
So a mild panic hit America, particu-
larly in this town of Washington, and 
out of that panic came a pretty good 
idea, as far as I was concerned. They 
decided that for the first time in the 
history of the United States, we would 
start loaning money to college-age stu-
dents so they could go to college. The 
notion was, if we had to fight the Rus-
sians or the Soviets in technology, we 
better have people educated and pre-
pared to do it. 
So someone who in those days sat 
down and wrote up the names of these 
wonderful ideas came up with a great 
one. It was called the National Defense 
Education Act. The National Defense 
Education Act said that those who ap-
plied for Federal college loans could 
borrow money and pay it back at 3 per-
cent interest but not have to pay until 
1 year out of college, and then they had 
10 years to pay it off. 
I didn’t know at the time, but that 
turned out to be my ticket to college. 
There was no way that my family 
could afford to send me, nor could I af-
ford to go to school at good schools 
from any money that I had saved or 
could earn during the summer. It was 
the government loans that got me 
through it. And I wasn’t alone. By the 
tens of thousands, students all over the 
United States took out these National 
Defense Education Act loans. 
Well, what happened as a result of 
that idea that we could educate our-
selves out of this problem? It worked. 
It worked dramatically. In the early 
1960s, there was this explosive expan-
sion of our economy, of technology and 
research and scientific endeavors that 
we took advantage of for decades and 
still do to this day. 
I think about the race to the Moon 
and all the other things that we set our 
sights on, and they were all based on 
enough well-educated people at every 
level who could compete with countries 
around the world and do it success-
fully. So the concept is sound, and I 
think it was executed—not flawlessly, 
but very well—for myself and for many 
others, and I ended up borrowing that 
money to get through college and law 
school. 
The amount of debt if I even said it 
on the floor maybe would draw a laugh 
by the pages and everyone else because 
it was so small, but it was enough debt 
that it just scared me to death. It was 
the equivalent of 50 percent of my 
gross pay coming out of law school in 
1 year. But most students today would 
accept that in a second: 50 percent of 
their gross wages in their first year as 
their student loan debt. 
The average is higher. The average is 
over $25,000, and for some students, it is 
almost astronomical what they end up 
borrowing. I can’t even imagine the 
cost of colleges and law schools today 
and medical schools and dental schools 
and the debt that is involved—which 
leads me to the second point in history 
and I think it was sometime in the 
1960s. 
Somebody wrote a story about stu-
dent loan borrowers who went to med-
ical school, finished medical school, 
then got their licenses to practice med-
icine with a pretty good opportunity to 
make some real money in life, but they 
had one more stop. They stopped at the 
bankruptcy court and they discharged 
their student loans in bankruptcy 
court and then went on to practice 
medicine. 
Well, that sounded like a pretty bad 
deal for the government who trusted 
them to get a degree and earn enough 
money to pay back the loan and in the

September 7, 2022 
fairness of this, that they wouldn’t ac-
cept their responsibility. So someone 
dreamed up the idea that, well, let’s 
make sure you cannot discharge your 
student loan in bankruptcy court. 
There are a handful of debts that you 
can incur that cannot be discharged in 
bankruptcy court—but just a handful. 
Taxes that you owe the government, 
for example, I believe, are not dis-
chargeable; money that you owe in di-
vorce settlements and child support are 
not dischargeable; and a handful of 
other things. But otherwise, anything 
you can borrow money for, you can go 
to bankruptcy court and say, ‘‘I want 
to walk away from all my debts,’’ and 
achieve that goal. 
For example, if you had a mortgage 
on your home and you want to be dis-
charged from paying off that mortgage, 
you can do it in bankruptcy court. You 
may or may not have any home left 
after it is discharged in bankruptcy, 
but it is a fact. If you borrow money to 
buy a boat, you can discharge that loan 
in bankruptcy. If you buy a car, you 
can discharge it in bankruptcy. A sec-
ond home? Discharge it in bankruptcy. 
But when it came to student loans, we 
said because some of these people took 
advantage and didn’t pay back their 
loans, we are not going to allow you to 
discharge it in bankruptcy. 
That ultimately meant that those 
who borrowed money to go to school or 
college when they were 19 or 20 years 
old, they would have a debt that they 
will have to pay back or carry it to the 
grave—literally, carry it to the grave. 
There was no way to get rid of it. 
So what happened? We know. A lot of 
people got too deeply in debt. It turned 
out that even the promise of a college 
diploma was not enough to meet their 
obligations, so they are deeply in debt. 
(Mr. HICKENLOOPER assumed the 
Chair.) 
Now, Mr. President, let me mention a 
third category of things that started 
before the Presiding Officer arrived. 
There was Sputnik which changed the 
world and the National Defense Edu-
cation Act; we went and changed the 
bankruptcy law and said that you can’t 
discharge a student loan in bank-
ruptcy. 
Now, let me introduce a third phe-
nomenon. And I have done so before, 
but I want to give you two numbers, 
and I want you to get out your pens 
and pencils, and I want you to write 
them down because they are going to 
be on the final. OK? There are two 
numbers: 8 and 33—8 and 33. So when 
you see the question on the final of 
what percentage of college students go 
to for-profit colleges and universities, 
hold up your hand. It is 8 percent. 
Eight percent of college students go to 
for-profit colleges and universities. 
Those are the ones that are heavily ad-
vertised. You see them everywhere. 
Thirty-three. What percentage of all 
student loan defaults are students who 
went to for-profit colleges and univer-
sities? Thirty-three percent. Eight per-
cent of the students have 33 percent of 
the student loan defaults. 
What is going on here? Why are those 
students so disproportionately default-
ing on their student loan debt? They 
were misled into going into these 
schools that were worthless—worth-
less. 
You see ads on TV that show this 
lovely young lady. She was in her bed-
room in her pajamas with a laptop 
computer saying, ‘‘I am going to col-
lege.’’ 
And you think to yourself: Get real. 
This isn’t real college. This is a way to 
get you to pay too much in tuition for 
something that is basically worthless. 
And students do. Eight percent of col-
lege students do it. 
So the point I am making is, many of 
these students are deceived and duped 
into going to these colleges because of 
the promises they make about what 
these degrees are worth and how easy 
it is to acquire an associate’s or bach-
elor’s degree. So they are deeply in 
debt, and they can’t find a job and take 
care of them. I will tell you the story 
of one of them in just a moment. 
But put those together, and that is 
why we need to do something about 
student loans in America. Yes, we need 
student loans in America. They are 
good for America and its economy. 
Should they be dischargeable in bank-
ruptcy? 
I 
think, 
under 
some 
cir-
cumstances, they should be. 
If 10 years have passed and you still 
had a balance on your student loans 
and you were literally head over heels 
in debt, you ought to be able to dis-
charge that in bankruptcy. You tried 
your best. Ten years is enough. That is 
one approach. But the other approach, 
President Biden has just suggested. 
That is why he issued a one-time stu-
dent loan debt relief program to ease 
the college debt burden on middle- and 
lower-income families. 
Under the President’s plan, the gov-
ernment will erase $10,000 in Federal 
student loan debt for some borrowers 
who make less than $125,000 a year. If 
you are married and file taxes jointly 
or head of household, you qualify if 
your income is $250,000 or less. If you 
received a Pell Grant while you were 
going to college—and those are for 
lower-income families—you could qual-
ify for an extra $10,000 of student loan 
cancellation. 
Under the President’s plan, 43 million 
Americans will receive some amount of 
debt 
cancellation. 
A 
majority 
of 
them—about 27 million borrowers—will 
see up to $20,000 knocked off their stu-
dent loan balance. For 20 million bor-
rowers, that is enough to totally wipe 
out their entire student loan balance. 
They literally can start again. They 
can consider going back to school— 
maybe even a good school that gives 
them the kind of training, education, 
or degree that really can lead to a bet-
ter life. Or they can try to take an-
other course of action. 
There are other approaches. I have 
got labor unions all over my State beg-
ging for apprentices—good-paying jobs 
for skilled craftsmen and the like. 
They don’t need a college degree to 
achieve that. Some of them may con-
sider that. 
Everyone who qualifies for relief will 
get a lower monthly payment at least, 
and that means real help now. Of 
course, it isn’t a real complete solution 
to the challenge. Too many colleges 
are charging too much money. 
When I ask of a nice college: What 
does that nice college ask for tuition? 
I visited one just over the August 
break. And someone said: It is $72,000 a 
year. I said, For tuition? How in the 
world can it be? 
Well, they give a lot of student 
grants and scholarships and fellowships 
and this, that, and the other thing. But 
the cost of higher education is getting 
beyond the reach of average people, 
and that is a big problem. We need to 
have affordable education and edu-
cation that helps you meet your goals. 
I might also say that some of the 
people who have been involved in bor-
rowing money have some sad stories to 
tell. 
Vickie Vences is one of thousands of 
Illinois students who were deceived by 
one of these for-profit colleges called 
Westwood. Vickie grew up on the 
South Side of Chicago. She is the first 
person in her family to attend college. 
She decided that she wanted to go 
into law enforcement. She enrolled in a 
criminal justice program in Westwood 
College in 2004 in Chicago. She believed 
the recruiters. They said: A degree 
from Westwood is going to open the 
door for you, young lady, right into the 
field of law enforcement. 
She found the opposite was true. 
They laughed at her when she showed 
her resume from Westwood College. 
They said: That is not a real college. 
That is not a real degree, and that 
doesn’t 
help 
you 
a 
bit—because 
Westwood hid the truth about the fact 
that they were not accredited in Illi-
nois. A lot of young people were duped 
into believing it was a ticket to a good 
law enforcement job. 
By the time Vickie found out how 
badly she was into it, she had $50,000 in 
student loan debt, and she didn’t have 
even a Westwood degree to point to. 
That is unfortunate. She could have 
done a lot more with her life, were it 
not for the student debt and the decep-
tion of these for-profit schools. She is 
working mostly for nonprofit organiza-
tions. She finds it hard to make any of 
her loan payments. The good news is 
that the Department of Education can-
celed the student loan debts of all 
former Westwood College students fol-
lowing investigations into Westwood’s 
widespread misconduct. Vickie is going 
to get a break. 
That is why, I have to tell you, I was 
a little upset with one of our col-
leagues—and I won’t name names. We 
are not supposed to do that on the Sen-
ate floor. But he started mocking the 
students who are heavily in debt. I 
think he referred to them as ‘‘slat-
ternly baristas.’’ I think that means 
they are lazy and work at Starbucks—

September 7, 2022 
and here, they have too much debt, and 
it is their own damn fault. 
I couldn’t disagree more. Students, 
when you are 19 or 20 years old, don’t 
know what is a reasonable debt and 
what isn’t. They just don’t have life ex-
perience. Many of them are first-gen-
eration college students in their fam-
ily. Mom and dad are not much help. 
They want to see their kids get a col-
lege degree. That is supposed to be the 
ticket to success. So young people sign 
up for loans, and they sign up in 
schools that can’t produce a diploma 
that leads to a job, and they get stuck 
with it. 
Vickie, I mentioned earlier, tried her 
best to pay off these loans and doesn’t 
have much luck. She says that being 
freed of some of this debt is going to be 
at least lifting part of the burden. Let’s 
be honest about it. I don’t know that 
she is lazy or if ‘‘barista’’ is now a neg-
ative term. I don’t think it is. Those 
folks are working, and I respect the 
fact that they are. 
She said, ‘‘I’m not asking for any-
thing for free. I just think things 
should be fair. Education should be af-
fordable. And we ought to be able to 
earn enough to pay back what we owe.’’ 
These Republican colleagues of mine 
are setting out to stop this plan by Joe 
Biden. I guess it will be a great source 
of pride if they do it. They can say: We 
stopped this relief for all of these 
young people who are in debt. We sunk 
them deeper into despair. And we did it 
because it is an election year. 
I think it is unfortunate. The Presi-
dent’s student loan forgiveness plan is 
not a giveaway to rich doctors and law-
yers who racked up big debt at Ivy 
League schools. Ninety-eight percent 
of the student loan borrowers did not 
attend those schools. The majority of 
these debts are held by families who 
have zero net worth—zero. What will 
their life be like without help? Nearly 
90 percent of the relief dollars in the 
President’s plan will go to borrowers 
who earn less than $75,000 a year. 
And let’s reflect for a moment on 
what has happened over the last few 
years in the United States of America 
under the previous President who will 
go unnamed and what we have seen as 
a result of this pandemic. 
Remember when we came up and 
were unable to articulate the number 
‘‘trillion dollars’’ without shaking? We 
started talking about trillion-dollar re-
lief packages in the pandemic. And we 
said to people: We are going to have 
loans through the Small Business Ad-
ministration for people who have a job 
or a business and need a helping hand 
in terms of borrowing money to get by. 
And if you can prove that you spent 
the money on payroll and utilities and 
rent, it is forgiven. 
So take a look at that mechanism. 
Through no fault of their own, they 
were stuck with debt because of the 
pandemic. They borrowed money from 
the Federal Government—taxpayers’ 
money—and if they could spend it for 
the right things, it was forgiven, a 
walkaway. I didn’t hear a lot of speech-
es about ‘‘slatternly baristas’’ at that 
point in time. And we have also seen it 
happen before. In fact, we have had a 
number of Members of Congress who 
applied for some of those PPP loans. 
The same people who are criticizing 
forgiving student loan debts literally 
personally borrowed money that they 
didn’t pay back to the Federal Govern-
ment, and they don’t think there is 
anything wrong with that. I can go 
into a long list of people who have ben-
efited by loans that were forgiven or 
grants given by the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Better than going through that list, 
let me say the bottom line is this: If we 
can help these young student bor-
rowers with an opportunity to reduce 
the debt they owe and get their lives 
back online, that is a great outcome 
for them and a great one for this Na-
tion. 
The same type of idealism that drove 
us to the National Defense Education 
Act after Sputnik applies as well 
today. We should have a well-trained, 
well-educated 
American 
workforce 
ready to compete with the world. I 
think we can do it. Joe Biden’s step is 
a reasonable, humane step in the right 
direction. It should have bipartisan 
support. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4798 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
last month, in a completely partisan 
process, 
Senate 
Democrats 
pushed 
through their progressive and deceiv-
ingly named Inflation Reduction Act. 
That bill was a disaster, as it was full 
of reckless tax increases and spending. 
Perhaps the worst part of it was that 
it authorized $80 billion in new funding 
to the IRS—$80 billion. For reference, 
that is about the same as what we allo-
cated for Florida’s entire State budget 
when I was Governor, and Florida is 
the third largest State in the Nation. 
Even though the IRS does a poor job 
with the resources it currently has, the 
Democrats opted to supersize the IRS 
so they could fund 87,000 new IRS 
agents, some of whom will be armed 
and willing to use deadly force to carry 
out their duties. 
So, while the Democrats are calling 
to defund the police and are leaving 
our Border Patrol agents without the 
tools they need to secure the southern 
border, they are happy to enlarge the 
IRS. We don’t even have 20,000 Border 
Patrol agents—a quarter of the number 
of new IRS agents the Democrats want; 
yet they have now approved 87,000 addi-
tional IRS agents. That is insane. 
That many agents under the direc-
tion of President Biden should concern 
every American. We all remember that 
when Joe Biden was Vice President, 
the IRS went after conservative groups 
and Tea Party organizations. Now, 
armed with tens of billions in new 
funding and tens of thousands of new 
agents, what is stopping Joe Biden 
from directing the IRS to go after 
groups he doesn’t like? What about 
pregnancy resource centers or Second 
Amendment groups? 
Here is what the Democrats are 
doing: They are turning the IRS into a 
super Agency to audit more Americans 
so they can fund even more of their 
reckless tax-and-spend agenda. Let’s 
not forget that last year, the Demo-
crats wanted the IRS to spy on nearly 
every American’s bank account and 
track 
one’s 
everyday 
transactions. 
American families can see straight 
through Biden’s plans, and they are fu-
rious. We all should be furious. 
Without a single Republican vote, 
the Democrats authorized 87,000 more 
IRS agents—doubling the size of the 
Agency—all to pull as many dollars as 
they can away from hard-working fam-
ilies and small businesses so they can 
fund liberal projects and appease their 
radical base with more government 
bailouts. 
Case in point: Biden’s illegal order to 
transfer student loan debt from bor-
rowers to taxpayers. Someone has to 
pay for the hundreds of billions of dol-
lars of debt that these borrowers volun-
tarily took on. Now, instead of the bor-
rowers paying for their own edu-
cations, that burden is now borne by 
every American taxpayer. You didn’t 
go to college? The Democrats don’t 
care. You will pay the debt of lawyers 
and doctors. Have you already paid off 
your loans? Biden doesn’t want to hear 
it. Tough luck. Your taxes are the 
money pot for other people’s student 
debts, and if Democrats are going to 
keep declaring everything to be free, 
Biden is going to need a lot more tax-
payer money. 
That, my fellow Americans, is how 
we get full circle back to the supersized 
IRS. It is a vicious cycle to fund a rad-
ical, socialist agenda. We have to stop 
it now. 
I am here to do what countless Flo-
ridians have asked me to do—strike 
this terrible policy from law. It is time 
to rein in the Federal Government, and 
that work begins with putting a stop to 
Biden’s IRS army. My bill would sim-
ply repeal this disastrous IRS expan-
sion, and I ask all of my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 4798. I further ask that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, it is time 
for a reality check here in the Senate. 
The far right has had an awful lot to 
say about the IRS in these last few 
days. Even Senators who should sup-
posedly know better are spinning wild 
fantasy stories about 87,000 agents who 
are armed to the teeth and coming to

S4461 
September 7, 2022 
the doors of innocent small business 
people. All this talk is unscathed by 
the truth. 
Here is what is true: Every year, 
wealthy tax cheats and scofflaw cor-
porations skip out on paying what they 
owe and rip off the American people for 
billions and billions of dollars. Let me 
say that again. Wealthy tax cheats are 
ripping off innocent taxpayers, every 
year, of billions and billions of dollars. 
They 
are 
sophisticated. 
They 
are 
wealthy. They want to protect the sta-
tus quo. By attacking the IRS, the Re-
publicans are helping high-flying tax 
cheats get away with breaking the law. 
The IRS has had its resources gutted 
by the Republicans over the last dec-
ade. It is badly outmatched now by the 
wealthy tax cheats, who have armies of 
lawyers and accountants who are pry-
ing open loopholes and hiding income 
in the shadows. Let me give the Senate 
an example. 
A few weeks ago, I put out the find-
ings of a yearlong Finance Committee 
investigation into the largest alleged 
tax evasion scheme by one individual 
in American history. With the right fi-
nancial wizardry and a complicated 
network of offshore accounts and part-
nerships, 
this 
individual, 
Robert 
Brockman, was able to evade taxes on 
over $2 billion in income. To hide his 
money, he set up offshore entities that 
we call shell banks. They were offshore 
entities dressed up like financial insti-
tutions that Mr. Brockman set up to 
hide his money from the IRS, betting 
correctly that the IRS wouldn’t have 
the resources to uncover his scheme. 
There may be hundreds of thousands 
more of these shell banks that the IRS 
has never examined. 
The Finance Committee is also in the 
midst of an investigation into the tax 
practices of some of the biggest mem-
bers of Big Pharma. One of the compa-
nies whose tax data we examined was 
AbbVie. In 2020, 75 percent of AbbVie’s 
sales were made in the United States, 
but AbbVie reported only 1 percent of 
its income to the United States for tax 
purposes. Earlier this year, we re-
quested financial information from 
Merck, which makes nearly half of its 
sales in the United States, but it re-
ported only 14 percent of its income 
here. We also requested information 
from Bristol Myers Squibb, which re-
portedly used a thicket of foreign sub-
sidiaries and partnerships to take its 
effective tax rate from 24.7 percent all 
the way down to a negative 7 percent 
in a single year. 
The IRS struggles to do anything 
about many of these cases even when 
they get reported in the press. Crimi-
nal tax evasion cases have fallen nearly 
by half. The number of highly trained 
experts who know how to break down 
these complex tax evasion cases has 
fallen by a third. It takes hundreds and 
hundreds of hours to review the tax fil-
ings of corporations and the rich, and 
the IRS just doesn’t have the resources 
to go after these wealthy tax cheats 
and scofflaw corporations. So there is a 
reason the Democrats believe you have 
to invest more resources to enforce the 
laws on the books. 
Here is the most important point: It 
doesn’t have anything to do with mid-
dle-class taxpayers, because their taxes 
are taken out automatically of every 
single paycheck. That is really dif-
ferent than the way the big guys go 
about their activities in ripping off the 
little guys with complex tax evasion 
schemes. What so many Republicans 
want to do is preserve the status quo so 
that only the little guys get audited 
while billionaire friends like Robert 
Brockman get off scot-free. 
Funding for the IRS is also about 
providing a basic level of customer 
service to taxpayers who are in Colo-
rado, in Oregon, and in every part of 
the country. At one point during the 
filing season this year, the IRS told the 
Finance Committee that it was able to 
answer only 11 percent of the service 
phone calls it was receiving. Taxpayers 
in America deserve better service from 
their government, and that means 
making sure the IRS has the resources 
to provide it. 
The far right and the tax cheats—the 
wealthy tax cheats—want the IRS, ap-
parently, to continue to struggle be-
cause it makes it easier to attack and 
vilify. That is why we have heard so 
many falsehoods about the thousands 
of new IRS agents. I don’t know where 
this number came from. It is absolute 
nonsense that has been conjured out of 
nothing. 
Even worse are the falsehoods about 
IRS agents and firearms. Alongside the 
DEA, the FBI, and other law enforce-
ment Agencies, the IRS often plays a 
part in going after drug cartels, money 
launderers, and other serious, hardened 
criminals. So the question is, How do 
my Republican colleagues expect IRS 
criminal investigation officers to de-
fend themselves during drug busts 
against violent cartels? Should they 
bring a set of sharpened No. 2 pencils? 
We are talking about living in the 
real world. The IRS funding that the 
Democrats passed last month is about 
making sure that the IRS can do its 
job and meet the expectations of the 
American people. 
I can tell you, as a Senator who has 
townhall meetings in every county of 
my State every year, the people of my 
State say: Look, we are law-abiding. 
We pay our taxes. There is something 
way out of whack when these wealthy 
tax cheats and scofflaw corporations 
can pay little or nothing. 
It is time for Members of Congress to 
stop going to bat for these wealthy tax 
cheats who break the law. The IRS 
needs to be able to crack down on these 
rip-offs. The IRS needs to be able to 
provide adequate and timely service. 
The taxpayers need help, and that is 
what the IRS funding does. 
What we have heard so much about 
from my colleagues on the far right in 
raising this specter of agents—thou-
sands of them, armed to the teeth, 
coming to the doors of small busi-
nesses—is simply unscathed by the 
truth. 
For that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I agree with my colleague that if you 
owe taxes, you should pay your taxes, 
but what is inconsistent with what my 
colleague just said is that we had an 
amendment vote that would say that 
none of these agents could go after 
anybody making less than $400,000 a 
year. Every Democrat, I believe, in the 
Senate voted against that. So the goal 
is, absolutely, we should make sure 
that wealthy taxpayers pay everything 
they owe, but we had an amendment 
that would make sure this was focused 
on wealthy taxpayers—this was during 
a vote just before we left on recess— 
and every Democrat voted against 
that. 
For all of those who are watching, 
here is what you are going to see: The 
Democratic Party has created a plat-
form to audit more Americans—not 
just wealthy Americans but all Ameri-
cans. This isn’t about fairness; this is 
about power. The Democrats want to 
spy on your bank transactions, and 
they want to send 87,000 more IRS 
agents on the streets to collect the bill 
for their reckless spending. 
Joe Biden has pitched his provision 
in the image of Robin Hood taking 
from the rich, but in reality, this ex-
pansion is in the image of the Sheriff of 
Nottingham stealing from the poor and 
the working class. 
None of us should be surprised the 
Democrats are doubling down on the 
radical IRS expansion policies. We all 
should be pretty mad. When the Repub-
licans take control of Congress in Jan-
uary, you can expect that we will do 
everything in our power to repeal this 
terrible policy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would 
just like to briefly discuss the amend-
ment that came up during the budget 
discussion. 
Senate Democrats made it very, very 
clear that we were strongly against 
taxing those in our country with in-
comes under $400,000. The problem with 
the amendment that the Republicans 
offered is they used the word ‘‘taxable’’ 
income. So, while we strongly opposed 
raising taxes on middle-class people 
and others making under $400,000, the 
wording of the Republicans’ amend-
ment, which talked about taxable in-
come, could have immunized billion-
aires from being subject to an audit. 
That is because, as the Presiding Offi-
cer and I have talked about, billion-
aires often live by this ‘‘buy, borrow, 
and die’’ philosophy, and they have lit-
tle or no taxable income for years on 
end. My colleagues probably saw some 
of the stories, for example, about bil-
lionaires who are claiming the child 
tax credit because their taxable income

is actually low under the way it is de-
fined. 
Just to make sure the record is clear, 
we are all in on this effort of not tax-
ing middle-income folks. We subscribe 
completely. In fact, it is what we had 
in the bill, and our enforcement section 
made that clear as well. But we are not 
for creating new paths to tax evasion 
for billionaires. Regrettably, that is 
what the language in the Republicans’ 
amendment would have done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. The easiest 
way to solve my colleague’s issue 
would have been to propose an amend-
ment to make sure that we didn’t go 
after 
taxpayers 
making 
less 
than 
$400,000 a year, but not one Democrat 
did that. All they did was just vote 
against this and then after the fact 
say: Well, it was a language issue. If it 
were simply a language issue, we could 
have solved it that night. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
INFLATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss the 
crisis that is hitting all Americans. It 
is a crisis caused by the Democrats. It 
is a crisis of inflation and a crisis of 
the recession which we are living. 
Right now, it looks like Democrats 
want to take a victory lap. I have 
heard the President give his speeches. 
He seems to want to do this because 
the Democrats have passed one of the 
largest tax-and-spend bills in the his-
tory of the country. They crammed it 
through Congress in just a matter of 
days. It was partisan. It is a liberal 
wish list. And for some, it seemed like 
it was a green-haired liberal’s dream 
come true. 
The bill includes hundreds of billions 
of dollars for the radical climate agen-
da that so many of the Democrats have 
been talking about. They are going to 
double the size of the Internal Revenue 
Service. Audits will be up. It is going 
to raise taxes on the middle class by 
tens and tens of billions of dollars. 
Democrats, of course, passed this bill 
on a party-line vote—not a single Re-
publican voted for it in the House or 
the Senate—and Joe Biden signed it 
into law. Ever since then, the liberals 
and the press have been singing Joe 
Biden’s praises. 
Yet here is a recent headline that I 
saw from NBC News. It said: 
Democrats reluctant to campaign with 
Biden— 
Reluctant to campaign with Biden. 
And then the headline goes on— 
despite the recent winning streak. 
Winning streak? There is nothing 
winning about this. This is a losing 
streak hitting the American people. 
All of this Democratic celebration 
just shows how out of touch today’s 
Democratic Party really is. Working 
families aren’t celebrating right now. 
No. They are struggling—struggling— 
in this age of inflation and economic 
crisis. 
Here is the reality: We are in a reces-
sion. Just last week, the government 
confirmed 
the 
economy 
has 
now 
shrunk for 6 months in a row. It has 
been the definition of a recession for 
decade upon decade, no matter what 
the White House wants to say about 
how they want to redefine ‘‘recession.’’ 
Inflation remains at a 40-year high. 
People can’t keep up. They are falling 
behind. Just this morning, a new Gal-
lup poll came out, and what did it 
show? Today’s Gallup poll showed a 
majority of Americans saying inflation 
is causing them personally—them—‘‘fi-
nancial hardship.’’ That is who is 
struggling. That is who is hurting 
most, American families trying to 
make ends meet. 
For low-income Americans, accord-
ing to this poll by Gallup out today, 
three out of four are facing financial 
hardship from the inflation that has 
been brought on to this country by the 
Democrats’ reckless spending. For the 
middle class, it is two-thirds, two out 
of three members of the middle class. 
The American people aren’t cele-
brating now. They are having to cut 
back on their spending because they 
can’t afford to keep up, and they are 
falling further and further behind. So 
it is astonishing Democrats think they 
are on a winning streak. 
It is fascinating to watch Joe Biden 
and Democrats pat themselves on the 
back because gas prices are now a dol-
lar and a half more a gallon than they 
were the day Joe Biden took office. In 
some places, they are less than $4 a 
gallon but not in Nevada and Wash-
ington State, just to name a few. There 
is no celebrating, in my opinion, when 
gas prices are $1.50 a gallon more today 
than they were the day Joe Biden took 
office and then a day after Saudi Ara-
bia announces that they are going to 
cut back on the production of oil, even 
though Joe Biden went hat in hand, on 
bended knee, and said: Please, Saudi 
Arabia, produce more oil and sell it to 
the United States because even though 
we have it here, we are not going to let 
the American people get it out of the 
ground. 
Democrats haven’t lifted a finger to 
produce one more drop of American oil 
or American energy. Supply is down 
from the prepandemic peak. Prices are 
down right now a little because de-
mand is down because people can’t af-
ford to drive at the high prices that 
gasoline went up to because of Joe 
Biden’s policies and the Democrats’ 
commitment to keeping the oil in the 
ground. 
The American people are driving less 
in the summer of 2022 than they were 
in the summer of 2020, and that was the 
year of the pandemic, when the coun-
try was in a shutdown. That is what 
really high prices of energy will do in 
terms of demand for using oil. 
Increasingly, people not only can’t 
leave home because of the cost of gas, 
they can’t afford to stay home either. 
They can’t afford to heat their home or 
cool their home. Half of American 
homes are powered by natural gas, but 
Biden’s position is, keep that gas in the 
ground. 
Right now, 20 million Americans 
have fallen behind on paying their elec-
tric bills. That is a record. In total, the 
American people owe more than $16 bil-
lion in unpaid electric bills. It is dou-
ble the amount owed before the pan-
demic. And 20 million people may be 
facing what is called as ‘‘a tsunami of 
shutoffs.’’ It is all because of Demo-
crats’ out-of-touch policies. 
At the grocery store, prices are up 13 
cents on the dollar in the last 12 
months. That means a $100 grocery bill 
last year would be $113 this year. I was 
at the grocery store. A woman had two 
bags, and she said: Does this look like 
$100 worth of groceries? Week after 
week, this adds up. 
This is the fastest increase in grocery 
prices in 43 years. We are talking about 
meat and milk and eggs and vegeta-
bles. We are talking about fruit— 
things people buy when they go to the 
grocery store. Higher costs for gas and 
groceries are steadily eating away at 
the finances of the American people. 
In total, prices have gone up more 
than 12 percent since Joe Biden took 
office. Last week, we learned that 
prices 
have 
increased 
faster 
than 
wages. What people have to pay is 
going up faster than what people are 
earning for 16 months in a row. As a re-
sult, the American family today can af-
ford a lot less than they could the day 
Joe Biden took office. 
Wages can’t keep up so people are 
turning to their savings and to debt. 
One out of three Americans has taken 
an average of $600 out of their savings 
this year just to pay the bills to keep 
up just so they don’t fall further be-
hind. 
Household debt has never been higher 
than it is right now, and it is only 
going up. Half of American families say 
they expect to add even more to their 
debt by the end of the year. 
So what are Democrats offering 
working families, people who are out 
there struggling, trying to get by? The 
Secretary of Energy has this to offer. 
She says: Hey, a 30-percent discount on 
solar panels. 
Under the new spending bill, the tax-
payer will pay for 30 percent of the cost 
of those new solar panels—that is tax-
payers across the country for people 
who want to get the 30-percent dis-
count. People can’t afford basic gro-
ceries like milk and eggs right now, let 
alone solar panels. Does Secretary 
Granholm really think middle-class 
families are running out to buy solar 
panels? Not a chance. They are not. 
The American people are saying to the 
climate extremists: Thanks, but no 
thanks. 
Democrats’ inflation is not going 
away any time soon. The effects are 
going to be with us for a long, long 
time. The American people know it.

That is why they think the country is 
heading in the wrong direction. 
We may actually even see inflation 
getting worse. That is because Demo-
crats have now poured jet fuel on the 
fire of inflation. They did it twice this 
past month. First, they passed this in-
credibly expensive spending bill. Then 
a few days later, Joe Biden announced 
a very unfair $500 billion taxpayer- 
funded handout to people with college 
loans. It is a one-two punch to families 
who work, pay their taxes, and pay 
their bills; who, when they sign their 
name to a loan, expect to pay it back. 
That is not what we are getting with 
Joe Biden. Nope. What we are getting 
are actions that are going to cause 
more inflation. 
According to Wharton School of 
Business in their budget model, Demo-
crats’ spending bill is going to increase 
inflation not just for a week, not just 
for a month, not just for a year but for 
at least 2 years. And that is something, 
apparently, Joe Biden is proud of. Even 
Democratic economists admit the stu-
dent loan giveaway is going to increase 
inflation. 
So let’s name names. Former Obama 
economic 
adviser, 
Jason 
Furman, 
called this ‘‘gasoline on the infla-
tionary fire that is already burning.’’ 
This is Obama’s economic adviser. He 
called it ‘‘reckless.’’ 
Former Obama and Clinton economic 
advisor, Larry Summers, said: 
Student loan debt relief . . . increases in-
flation. . . . It will also tend to . . . rais[e] 
tuitions. 
Raise tuition; is that what the Demo-
crats are for? Hey, let’s raise tuition. 
We are for that. That is what Larry 
Summers says is going to happen as a 
result of these positions by the Demo-
crats in this Chamber and in the White 
House. 
Joe Biden continues to make life 
more expensive, more unaffordable, 
and more painful for American fami-
lies. To bring down costs, Republicans 
propose doing the exact opposite of 
what the Democrats are doing today. 
We need to produce more and spend 
less. We need to produce more of lots of 
things. Energy is part of it. We need to 
unleash American energy. We need to 
lower costs all across the country by 
producing more American energy right 
here in the United States, not going 
hat in hand to Saudi Arabia, not going 
hat in hand, as Joe Biden did just a 
year 
ago, 
to 
Russia—to 
Vladimir 
Putin’s Russia. Just a year ago, Joe 
Biden was saying: Please send us more 
oil. Oh, and he wants the same from 
Iran and Venezuela. We have it here in 
the United States. We need to unleash 
it. 
For the last 20 months, Democrats 
have waged an all-out war against 
American energy. We need more en-
ergy, not less. What we need less of is 
less Washington redtape. So far Joe 
Biden has issued more than $200 billion 
in punishing regulations in just 20 
months. It makes it more expensive to 
create jobs here at home. 
Finally, we need to stop this reckless 
Washington spending. The Biden infla-
tion crisis started the month after 
Democrats passed their first spending 
bill. The first spending bill added $2 
trillion to the debt; the college loan 
giveaway, another half trillion. It is all 
going to make inflation worse. And 
people at home are furious. 
So despite what the liberal pundits 
may say, Democrats have nothing to 
celebrate. A poll from writers last 
week showed Joe Biden still has an ap-
proval rating below 40 percent. Three 
out of four Americans say this country 
is on the wrong track under Joe Biden 
and the Democrats. 
According to one poll, a full majority 
of Americans say America’s best days 
are behind us. It is a record, a record 
high that people think the best days 
are behind us. 
America is in a crisis right now. 
From our economy, to our border, to 
crime in our communities, Joe Biden’s 
liberal policies have failed working 
families across America. 
So I disagree with those who say our 
best days are behind us. I believe the 
best days for America are always ahead 
of us. It is the control of Washington 
that needs to be put behind us. 
You know, Joe Biden gave a political 
speech the other day, flanked by ma-
rines, in Philadelphia. He told the 
American public it was a policy speech. 
It was not. He intentionally misled the 
American people and tried to lie to the 
American people because, if it had been 
a policy speech, he would have actually 
addressed the issues that are keeping 
Americans awake at night—the issues 
that they care about, the pain that 
they are suffering. 
He never mentioned once the words: 
prices, inflation, gas, the border, crime, 
cartel, fentanyl, or debt. He never men-
tioned those. No. The President closed 
his eyes to all of those things that he 
has done that are causing massive pain 
to the American people. But he looked 
down his nose at tens and tens of mil-
lions of Americans who are struggling 
to get by and the American economy 
that this President and the Democrats 
have intentionally undermined. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
TENNESSEE 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
think we all enjoyed being in our 
States during August. And during the 
time I was there, I wrapped up what I 
do each year, which is to visit with 
each of our 95 counties. And this is 
truly a listening tour for me, being 
able to talk with our citizens, to talk 
with our elected leaders. And I would 
leave those meetings so encouraged 
and think, I could not be more im-
pressed with the things that are being 
done in these communities. 
I would go to the next community 
and again would be just as impressed. 
Tennesseans are working hard. And 
this year has been a difficult year for 
everyone. But I want to focus on our 
local leaders today because they are 
the ones who are keeping these com-
munities afloat. And they have done it 
in spite of everything that Washington, 
DC, and the Democrats are doing to 
them. 
I thought it was interesting that yes-
terday the majority leader opened the 
Senate by reciting a laundry list of the 
Democratic Party’s accomplishments. 
Now, he put quite a spin on this. 
Back home in Tennessee, the people 
that I work with every single day are 
seeing this laundry list for what it is 
and how it affects them. There is hun-
dreds of billions of dollars for the 
Green New Deal giveaways, and there 
are Big Government power grabs; there 
is crippling regulatory overreach; bil-
lions more have been spent on this stu-
dent loan forgiveness program. Indeed, 
it could end up being a trillion dollars. 
And there are attacks on our funda-
mental constitutional rights. 
Yes, indeed, the way Tennesseans see 
it is that Joe Biden and the Democrats 
are putting together the pieces for 
what they call their transformation, 
their great socialist experiment. But in 
Tennessee, local leaders are really 
working around the clock to keep that 
vision from coming to be and to keep 
their communities from falling apart. 
And as I visited with these 95 coun-
ties, they gave to me one message that 
came through time and again, repeat-
edly. They don’t like what they are 
seeing from this socialist agenda that 
is being pushed forward here in DC. In-
deed, they would talk about their wor-
ries and their fears. They would talk 
about the impact of 9 percent inflation 
and $5-a-gallon gas. 
Now, that may be CHUCK SCHUMER’s 
version of success, which he really 
helpfully laid out yesterday as to what 
he thinks are successes and achieve-
ments, and that depends entirely upon 
his ability to spend somebody else’s 
money on things that the American 
people have repeatedly said they do not 
want and they do not need. That mes-
sage came through every one of our 95 
counties. 
Now, in Tennessee, when we talk 
about success, you hear about some-
thing different. You hear about growth. 
You hear about investments that com-
panies are making in our State. And we 
have earned this the hard way. And, in-
deed, the rest of the country is notic-
ing. Tennessee is one of the most well- 
managed States. It has no State in-
come tax. And you have got Ford 
Motor Company and SK Innovation 
that have seen the potential in our 
State, specifically in Haywood County. 
And they have invested billions of dol-
lars. 
When I was in West Tennessee last 
month, I visited their Blue Oval City 
project site where, in just a few years, 
they will have a brandnew manufac-
turing hub that will create thousands 
of jobs and grow the local economy by 
millions and millions of dollars. 
The people at Lone Oaks Farms in 
Hardeman County are working to make

certain that there is a great workforce. 
And they are developing STEM edu-
cation programs. When I visited them, 
they were hard at work planning for 
the 
new 
4–H 
Development 
Center, 
where students will learn how to be 
good stewards of Tennessee’s natural 
resources. 
Across the State in Blount County, I 
was so happy to officially welcome 
Smith & Wesson to Tennessee. Now, 
see, they have moved their head-
quarters and their manufacturing facil-
ity down from their old home in Massa-
chusetts. 
And 
they 
are 
certainly 
pleased with the Southern hospitality 
and the good business working environ-
ment that they are seeing in Ten-
nessee. 
The largest Buc-ee’s in the Nation is 
coming to Kodak, TN. Also, over on the 
east end of the State, the Techstars 
Accelerator Program is thriving in 
Knoxville. Red Stag set up a new logis-
tics hub in Sweetwater. And we have a 
brandnew emergency clinic in the 
Upper Cumberland. 
This is the sort of laundry list that I 
would hope and wish that my Demo-
cratic colleagues would be proud of. 
From one end of the State to the other, 
Tennessee is drawing investment, no 
thanks to this White House, to Presi-
dent Biden, and the Democrats that 
run the House and the Senate. It is our 
local leaders that are doing the heavy 
lift, in spite of what Washington, DC, is 
throwing at them every day. 
But with that said, these local lead-
ers deserve the respect and support 
from the Democratic Party. Even a 
bare minimum promise to not sabotage 
their hard work would be welcomed by 
them. But across all 95 counties, the 
message I received, as I said, was pret-
ty much the same: They are worried. 
They are very worried. They are fear-
ful. But they are not letting them-
selves get caught up in what the Demo-
crats are doing. 
Yes, they know the Democrats have a 
socialist-style agenda that they are 
pushing. That is the Democrats’ vision 
for the future. In Tennessee, our coun-
ties are not going to let the Democrats 
destroy their hope for a better future. 
They know that since the day the 
Democrats took power, Joe Biden and 
the Democrats have done everything 
they could do to seize control and re-
make a vision for this country into 
their image, where the elites, the se-
lect few—the Democrats—control the 
power on all the levers, and they can 
dictate to the States how they are 
going to live, what they are going to 
accomplish, what they are going to do. 
Tennesseans are suffering the con-
sequences of these policies in the form 
of record-breaking inflation, obscene 
fuel and energy costs, rising crime and 
drug use, and the overall sense that 
they have been abandoned by the Fed-
eral Government. That is how they see 
it. 
The overwhelming issue right now is 
inflation, inflation, inflation. It is the 
top concern in all 95 counties. It affects 
every county budget, and it affects 
small business. 
In Fayette County, I got to speak to 
Joey Hays of Dyer Foods and some of 
the truly resilient workers at one of 
his local grocery stores. We should all 
be grateful for people like the workers 
at Dyer Foods. They didn’t have it easy 
during the pandemic, and it hasn’t got-
ten any easier now than it was during 
the pandemic because more of their 
paychecks are being eaten up by infla-
tion. Interesting, isn’t it? Inflation is 
outpacing any wage growth. 
Many Tennessee counties that have 
managed to pull themselves out of dis-
tress status lost all traction when in-
flation skyrocketed. And now, guess 
what? They feel like they are back at 
square one because of decisions that 
had been made in Washington, DC. No 
fault of their own, mind you, decisions 
that are made here. 
Dayton City Manager Tommy Sol-
omon told me he saw the price of pipe 
go up 200 percent. They had to stop 
some of their water projects because 
they couldn’t afford to buy the sup-
plies. That is right. The pipe was up 200 
percent. 
Hamilton County Mayor Coppinger 
told me the worker shortage has made 
the 
inflation-driven 
problems 
even 
worse. They have raised salaries, and 
they still can’t fill critical roles, espe-
cially in public health. 
In Rhea, Bledsoe, McMinn, Marion, 
and Grundy Counties, inflation and 
supply chain issues are wiping out 
farmers. Most small farms in these 
counties only planted about half their 
normal crop due to fuel and fertilizer 
prices. Their businesses—these small 
businesses—are drying up. 
Many 
other 
businesses, 
including 
large 
manufacturers, 
are 
being 
stonewalled by regulators from the 
EPA with no explanation as to why 
they are making the decisions that 
they make. 
Do you know what? Unfortunately 
for 
small 
business 
manufacturers, 
there is no end in sight to what these 
regulators in this administration will 
do. 
Meanwhile, while all of this is hap-
pening, the border is open by order of 
the White House. The drug mules are 
streaming in, and drug use is spiking. 
Every 
single 
sheriff—every 
one 
of 
them—that I spoke to in Southeast 
Tennessee, told me that fentanyl is 
their No. 1 issue, and I can tell you 
that it is an issue in other areas of the 
State as well. 
In Grundy County, Sheriff Shrum 
told me about what happened to one of 
his deputies who accidentally came 
into contact with a dangerous amount 
of fentanyl. He started the day trying 
to save a life, but by the end of that 
day, it was his colleagues from the 
sheriff’s department who were saving 
his life and giving him a dose of 
Narcan. 
This is what our first responders and 
our local law enforcement are facing 
because Joe Biden and the Democrats 
and this DHS are refusing to secure the 
southern border. Two million plus and 
counting, about three quarters of a 
million known got-aways, but they will 
stand up there and tell you: Oh, the 
border is closed. 
Law enforcement in our State does 
not believe that, and I don’t either. 
This is a shame. 
Crime is on the rise, but rather than 
supporting police officers, Joe Biden 
and the Democrats are obsessed with 
undermining, 
defunding, 
and 
dis-
banding police departments. 
In Tipton County, I was truly blessed 
to meet Deputy Gene Molder and his 
family. Deputy Molder was shot in the 
line of duty last March while he was 
trying to help a group of people escape 
a violent hostage situation. Thank 
God, he is all right now, but people are 
outraged at the leftist rhetoric that is 
clearly designed to increase violence 
against law enforcement. 
Tennesseans aren’t asking for much. 
They don’t want a Federal Government 
to make their decisions for them. They 
don’t want a handout. They don’t want 
centralized 
control. 
Honestly, 
they 
wish that they could just be left alone 
when it comes to Washington, DC, and 
what they are doling out. They want 
you, the Federal Government, to get 
out of the way so that they can fulfill 
their vision for the future—prosperous, 
safe, secure. 
This 
President’s 
socialist 
agenda 
won’t help them do that because pros-
perity, freedom, independence, liberty, 
equal treatment under the law, equal 
justice for all is not what is at the top 
of their to-do list. It won’t help Ham-
ilton County hire workers or the Day-
ton Public Works Department buy 
pipe. It certainly won’t help farmers in 
Rhea County grow the food you eat, 
and it won’t help police officers keep 
their communities safe and secure. 
These local leaders in the great state 
of Tennessee know better than anyone 
here in Washington what they need us 
to do in order to help them get things 
done, and that message came through 
clear as a bell in 95 counties. What did 
they tell me—that message I heard all 
across 95 counties? Please secure the 
border and support law enforcement, 
repair and secure our supply chains, 
keep taxes low, and develop a business- 
friendly attitude, and, above all else, 
stop the out-of-control Federal spend-
ing. 
I know this administration has made 
a name for itself telling people what 
they can and cannot do. But I will tell 
you that this is a power struggle that 
you are not going to win, at least 
where Tennesseans are concerned. 
The Democrats have an agenda, but 
in Tennessee I have met with some of 
the most wonderful people in this coun-
try. They have a vision for what they 
want the future to be. They want it to 
be focused on hope, on opportunity for 
all, and I want to thank every single 
Tennessee leader, law enforcement offi-
cer, business owner, and citizens who 
gave me their time, who talked with

me and who offered their advice this 
past year. Their wisdom is what guides 
my decisions here in Washington. I 
only wish that my Democratic col-
leagues would take their words to 
heart as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
will proceed with my trusty, battered 
‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ chart and my—I 
don’t know—280-something speech. 
For once, I can start with some good 
news, which is that the Democrats, at 
last, passed a climate-focused rec-
onciliation bill this year. This is a 
huge step and essential, given the cas-
cade of harms climate change is al-
ready inflicting: wildfire in Yosemite 
National Park, billions of dollars in 
flood damage; Europe broils in heat 
wave; extreme heat led to ‘‘brutal’’ rise 
in sea temperatures; dangerous heat 
hits United States; emissions rising of 
methane, glacier tragedies; Houston 
slogs through brutal heat; climate 
change is forcing massive wildlife mi-
gration. Wherever you look, you see 
the news of what is happening—heat 
waves, droughts, wildfires, collapsing 
glaciers, rising seas, record carbon di-
oxide and methane concentrations in 
the atmosphere. 
It is a bombardment of hard evidence 
that the Earth is fast becoming less 
hospitable for human life. The costs of 
our political negligence are high and 
rising. 
My friends across the aisle like to 
fixate on the price of gasoline, which 
undeniably affects family budgets. But 
climate change imposes costs on Amer-
ican families much worse than gasoline 
prices. Climate change causes effects 
that raise insurance premiums, snarl 
supply chains, reduce crop yields, sick-
en people, and damage cars, homes, and 
businesses. 
A lot of thoughtful groups have quan-
tified this damage. The International 
Monetary Fund estimates this ‘‘cli-
mate tax’’ on American families at 
over $5,000 per year based on their cal-
culation that we subsidize fossil fuel by 
allowing them to get away with doing 
all this pollution and harm for free to 
the tune of $660 billion every year. 
That is the International Monetary 
Fund—5,000 bucks per family from cli-
mate change harms. 
They are not alone, of course. Re-
sources for the Future, which is a well- 
regarded, 
well-trusted 
calculation 
shop, has just looked at what the social 
cost of carbon should be, and they 
pegged it at $185 per ton of carbon 
emissions. Right now, the nominal so-
cial cost of carbon left over from the 
Obama administration is $51 per ton. 
Resources for the Future has done a 
more rigorous calculation and puts it 
at $185 in harm per ton of carbon emit-
ted. 
What does this all add up to? Well, 
you can go to corporate consulting 
firm Deloitte, which is a corporate con-
sulting firm. We are not talking about, 
you know, Green New Deal folks here. 
This is a corporate consultancy. They 
say that inaction on climate change 
could cost the world’s economy $178 
trillion over the next 50 years. 
Now, the bad news is climate change 
harms could cost $178 trillion. The good 
news is if we got after this and behaved 
responsibly, you could gain $43 trillion 
in economic development in that same 
time period. So if you put the two to-
gether, that is a $220 trillion swing de-
pending on decisions that we make 
today. So it kind of matters to getting 
this right, and we are not yet getting 
this right. 
The reconciliation bill, good as it is, 
won’t decarbonize our economy in time 
without a lot more action. The bill 
likely takes expected emissions reduc-
tion from around 25 percent, which we 
are assuming right there—that is our 
baked-in number—and it raises it to 
about 40 percent. So it is a 15-percent 
increase in emissions reduction, from 
25 percent to 40 percent. So that is 
good. That is good, but it still leaves 
much to do, because, remember, net 
zero is the target, and if you have re-
duced by 40 percent, that still leaves 60 
percent that is work to be done. 
So soon we are going to need another 
bill, and the contours of such a bill, if 
it is going to be effective, are pretty 
clear. 
There is bipartisan interest in a car-
bon border adjustment, which would 
make American manufacturing more 
competitive and reduce carbon pollu-
tion worldwide. We export pressure 
against carbon pollution with a carbon 
border tariff. 
There is also bipartisan interest in 
commonsense permitting reform to 
safely and quickly build out the clean 
energy infrastructure of the future. My 
coastal State needs it for offshore 
wind. The Presiding Officer’s Mountain 
State needs it for transmission lines to 
connect to the grid the capacity we 
have for solar and wind. 
And the fossil fuel industry at least 
pretends to be interested in a price on 
carbon emissions. Now, that is just pre-
tense. They put their whole political 
operation into effect to make sure none 
of that happens, but it is a good sign. It 
is a step on the path when they have to 
pretend to support a price on emis-
sions. That is a step on the way to ac-
tually supporting a price on carbon 
emissions. 
I will do everything in my power to 
do all of those things. But let’s be 
clear. It would be much easier if cor-
porate America were not a wall of op-
position to serious climate bills. 
And it is not just the fossil fuel in-
dustry. 
Banking, 
insurance, 
retail, 
tech—pick your industrial sector. You 
name it—in this building, useless on 
climate. Or worse, there is a huge 
spread between what they tell their 
shareholders and their customers and 
the public and what they send their 
emissaries into Congress to tell us. 
And until that is solved, until cor-
porate America aligns what it is telling 
the public with what it is doing in Con-
gress, legislation is going to be tough 
to do. 
So that leaves the executive branch, 
and that is what brings me to the floor 
today, because there is a lot that the 
executive branch can do under existing 
executive authorities. And in this re-
cent article, the White House said they 
were going to get started: 
Biden Prepares More Actions to Cut Emis-
sions. 
Regulations from the E.P.A. and elsewhere 
will help the president meet his aggressive 
climate goals. 
‘‘The president has not chosen to just look 
at Congress, he’s chosen to recognize that he 
has presidential authorities and responsibil-
ities under the law to keep moving this for-
ward.’’ 
Well, he sure does, and there is plen-
ty of room to do different things and 
new things. 
So what can be done by executive ac-
tion? 
Let’s go through the largest sources 
of greenhouse gas emissions since that 
is our target. The No. 1 source—by the 
way, these 11 sources of carbon pollu-
tion amount to almost 70 percent of 
our carbon emissions. So if we can 
tackle these, we are making a big dent 
in that remaining 60 percent left un-
done. 
So cars and light trucks is the larg-
est category. It generates almost a 
fifth of total U.S. carbon pollution. 
The EPA and DOT restored Obama- 
era greenhouse gas emission standards. 
So now go further, as California has. 
Start with model year 2027 and begin a 
ramp-up to 100 percent zero-emission 
vehicles by 2035. 
There is authority for this under the 
Clean Air Act and the 2007 Energy 
Independence and Security Act. And, 
by the way, when you double your car’s 
energy efficiency, doubling your fuel 
economy is exactly the same thing as 
cutting oil prices and gasoline prices in 
half. So push in that direction. 
And, by the way, getting off of fossil 
fuel for cars and light trucks will help 
us get off the Big Oil treadmill of car-
tel prices that are set with the help of 
foreign despots in Russia, in Saudi Ara-
bia, in Venezuela, outside the rule of 
American law. But Americans have to 
pay because our oil industry goes along 
with the international cartel instead of 
charging market-based prices. We just 
saw them do that and reap record prof-
its. So there is a lot to be done on cars 
and light trucks. 
Coal-fired powerplants is the next 
biggest one. Coal-fired powerplants 
belch carbon pollution, but also a lot of 
other pollutants. So if you regulate for 
health against those other pollutants, 
you get a lot of cobenefits with carbon 
pollution. 
Among the worst is fine particulate 
matter, which is also known as soot or, 
more technically, PM 2.5. It is the lead-
ing cause of the estimated 100,000 to 
200,000 air pollution-related premature 
deaths each year. So it is causing real 
harm. 
And then you add in coal ash, which 
is the toxic sludge left after you burn

coal, loaded with arsenic, mercury, 
lead, and uranium, and often stored in 
lagoons which sometimes burst, just as 
you see in this picture, not only 
swamping this farmhouse but also poi-
soning rivers and ground water. 
This should be a ‘‘never event.’’ This 
should be a ‘‘never event,’’ but it is 
not. It is all too frequent, and poor 
communities often take the hit. EPA 
regulations can eliminate these threats 
and produce carbon reduction cobene-
fits. 
Nothing in the recent West Virginia 
v. EPA decision prevents EPA from re-
quiring that coal-fired powerplants in-
stall carbon capture technology. And 
carbon capture technology can elimi-
nate up to 95 percent of the carbon pol-
lution. Add EPA’s authority under the 
Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act 
to regulate fine particulate matter and 
coal ash, and you can make real 
progress. 
That brings us, then, to gas-fired 
powerplants, the next category. They 
are big carbon polluters, and they are 
still being built. EPA regulations for 
new and existing gas-fired plants can 
limit their carbon pollution the same 
way. Carbon capture can be one option. 
Co-firing with zero carbon hydrogen 
could be another option. 
Next on the list is heavy-duty vehi-
cles, trucks, and buses. Now EPA has a 
proposed rule, and that proposed rule 
on trucks and buses does nothing to re-
duce carbon pollution. EPA and DOT 
have ample authority here, and they 
should use it. California has its own 
‘‘advanced clean trucks rule’’ requiring 
increased zero emission heavy-duty ve-
hicles. If EPA can’t do any better, then 
follow California’s lead. 
Next comes methane, spewing from 
oil and gas facilities as leaks, vents, or 
flares. EPA has a proposed rule—no ac-
tual rule yet—but even the proposed 
rule has flaws. First, it doesn’t cover 
low-producing wells. A low-producing 
well can be a very high-leaking well. 
So whether it is high or low pro-
ducing should matter less than wheth-
er it is a big leaker. 
Second, the rule does little for vent-
ing and flaring, which are major pollu-
tion sources. Now one development is 
that satellites can now very precisely 
locate methane leaks. So we can ag-
gressively pursue and punish big meth-
ane polluters, and we should do that. 
Set up a task force. Have people go 
hunting for the big methane leaks. 
Find who is responsible and get after 
them. 
If you do all that, it would cover 
more than half of gross carbon emis-
sions in the United States. So let’s do 
it. No more complaining about not 
enough staff. EPA has more employees 
than all of Congress combined. If you 
don’t have enough staff, then detail 
folks in from the regional offices, bor-
row from your State counterparts. Do 
what it takes to get after this like you 
mean it, because we need to. 
There is a list that I tweeted out of 
things that the administration could 
be doing within its existing executive 
authorities. Within the White House, 
OMB, or the Office of Management and 
Budget, 18 months in, needs to finalize 
its social cost of carbon, the costs and 
the harms from each ton of carbon pol-
lution emitted. That is the number 
that I mentioned earlier that Re-
sources for the Future just calculated 
at $185 per ton. 
OMB needs to finalize the social cost 
of carbon, set the number, and require 
its use throughout government deci-
sion making. All the regulatory agen-
cies should use it, even the quasi-inde-
pendents. 
And you can add in procurement de-
cisions. The Federal Government con-
tracts for over $600 billion in goods and 
services every year. We buy buildings, 
vehicles, planes, cement, steel, appli-
ances. You name it, the government 
buys it. Plug the social cost of carbon 
into procurement, as many private 
companies do, and you engage the 
power 
of 
government 
contracting 
against the climate threat. 
And when you do that, that then 
drives economies of scale that make 
those low-carbon projects and products 
cheaper for everyone else, not just the 
government buyer. 
The social cost of carbon should drive 
Department of Interior fossil fuel roy-
alty rates for oil, gas, and coal pro-
duced on Federal lands and waters. 
Those rates right now are so low that 
we lose money on royalties compared 
to the costs that those fossil fuels im-
pose on all of us. That is just dumb and 
also unfair. So let’s fix that flagrant 
imbalance by putting the social cost of 
carbon into the fees and royalties. 
I would add that the Department of 
Justice has a role to play here. Years 
ago, under the Clinton administration, 
the Department of Justice sued Big To-
bacco for decades of misrepresenta-
tions about the harms of its product. 
Well, DOJ won that lawsuit, and they 
won big, and they got a court order re-
quiring Big Tobacco to quit lying. 
Well, like Big Tobacco, Big Oil has 
spent decades misrepresenting the dan-
gers associated with its product. The 
Department of Justice is way overdue 
to take a serious look at fossil fuel lies. 
As they look around the country, 
they see States and municipalities and 
counties bringing lawsuits against the 
fossil fuel industry. It is happening out 
there. It is incumbent on the Depart-
ment of Justice to advise the President 
on what the Department of Justice 
should be doing. To turn a blind eye to 
all that litigation, to ignore its own 
victory in the tobacco case, to refuse 
to recommend to the President any 
course of action or to take any course 
of action is just not an acceptable way 
of going forward. If the DOJ took an 
honest look, I bet they would find the 
case against Big Oil every bit as solid 
as the case they won against Big To-
bacco. 
And while we are at it, there is the 
bully 
pulpit. 
The 
administration 
should use the bully pulpit to call out 
the dark money, the lies, the fake 
science, the phony front groups, the 
spin 
doctors, 
the 
co-opted 
lobby 
groups, the dirty political spending, 
the whole apparatus, the whole ma-
chinery that the fossil fuel industry 
has used to corrupt Congress and ob-
struct progress. 
Calling out crooks is the right thing 
to do, and the public deserves to know 
that there is a villain here who has 
blocked progress on purpose and what 
that villain is up to. 
There is a lot that the Biden admin-
istration can and should be doing. Yes, 
it is good to declare a climate emer-
gency. It is better to act like it is a cli-
mate emergency and deploy your Exec-
utive authorities accordingly. That 
means the sort of regulatory surge I 
have just outlined—no waffling, no ex-
cuses. 
A winning strategy ultimately in-
cludes regulation, litigation, legisla-
tion, acquisition, and communication. 
Across those five fronts, the Biden ad-
ministration should have a plan to 
move forward in each and every one. It 
needs the kind of leadership that Ei-
senhower gave to the Normandy land-
ing and the invasion that followed. 
By the way, while you are organizing 
it that way, do it with gusto. This is a 
fight that is worth having. It is not 
just that the planet depends on it; it is 
not just that our international credi-
bility depends on it; it is not just 
cleaning out this place from rotten fos-
sil fuel industry depends on it; it is the 
right thing to do. The American public 
will stand behind a President who 
stands up against lies and dark money 
and the schemes to blockade climate 
safety. 
So I will close by saying that wheth-
er there was ever a time for half-heart-
ed, half-baked, and halfway measures, 
it is done. We need to build on the suc-
cess of the Inflation Reduction Act. We 
need to take that as a launchpad, a 
first chapter, not a last chapter. And 
on this fight, it is all in or lose because 
our adversaries are determined. They 
are just wrong, but they are deter-
mined. So it is all in or lose. 
By the way, if we lose this race, the 
laws of chemistry and physics are 
going to be unforgiving. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
LABOR DAY 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, ear-
lier this week, we celebrated Labor 
Day, a day when Americans come to-
gether to honor the people who make 
this country work.

aging parent, all labor has dignity. 
When work has dignity, hard work pays 
off for everyone, no matter who you 
are, where you live, what kind of work 
you do. Yet we know that for so many 
Americans, their work simply doesn’t 
pay off like it should. 
Look at what has happened in Min-
nesota, Ohio, and Rhode Island—and I 
know Senator GRASSLEY
is coming 
out—and in Iowa. Look what has hap-
pened over the last 30, 40 years. Execu-
tive salaries have soared. CEO pay is 
up 1,300 percent since 1978—1,300 per-
cent. Corporate profits have risen. 
Stock prices are up. Workers are more 
productive than ever before. But for 
decades—for 
decades—wages 
barely 
budged for most Americans. Their pur-
chasing power has largely been flat for 
some five decades because Wall Street 
rewards corporations that raise prices 
without raising paychecks. Wall Street 
rewards stock buybacks. Wall Street 
rewards union busting. Wall Street 
really rewards shipping jobs overseas. 
Wall Street rewards automating jobs. 
Wall Street rewards outsourcing full- 
time, in-house work to contractors. 
Wall Street analysts actually down-
grade stock prices when American 
companies invest in American workers, 
in American production. If a company 
owns a new factory in Ohio, Wall 
Street 
might 
often 
downgrade 
its 
stock. If that same company instead 
buys back its own stock, sending 40 
percent of the returns to foreign inves-
tors, Wall Street rewards it. 
We work to change that. For the first 
time in far too long, we have a govern-
ment on the side of workers. We have a 
dues-paying union member as Labor 
Secretary. 
Contrast this Labor Secretary—a la-
borers’ union activist who carried a 
union card before he came; I think he 
still does as Secretary of Labor—con-
trast that with the Trump Secretary of 
Labor, who worked for one of the major 
world leaders in union busting and who 
made millions of dollars a year by 
busting unions. 
We took on Big Oil—I am sorry. We 
have a National Labor Relations Board 
actually looking out for workers and 
willing to go after union busting. We 
passed the most pro-worker infrastruc-
ture bill ever, the strongest ‘‘buy 
American’’ provisions ever in a piece of 
legislation. We have taken historic 
steps to put workers first, to invest in 
American workers, to make our econ-
omy work for every American, not just 
CEOs and not just Wall Street. 
That is what you came to the Senate 
from Minnesota for, and that is what 
Senator WHITEHOUSE came from Rhode 
Island for—to make these fights. 
We passed the CHIPS Act to bring 
our supply chains home, to bring down 
prices for American families, and to 
create thousands—tens of thousands of 
good-paying union jobs in Ohio and 
across the country. 
This groundbreaking that President 
Biden and I and Congressman RYAN and 
others are going to do this Friday in 
Licking County, OH, will mean, at a 
minimum, 5,000 good-paid, union, build-
ing 
trades 
jobs—carpenters, 
elec-
tricians, 
pipefitters, 
laborers, 
ulti-
mately millwrights, so many others— 
at least 5,000 over the next 2 or 3 years 
that will last at least for 10 years. 
Passing the CHIPS Act brings our 
supply chains home to bring down 
prices 
for 
American 
families. 
We 
passed the Inflation Reduction Act, 
taking on three of the most powerful 
special interests in Washington. We 
took on the big drug companies, Big 
Pharma, to bring down drug prices. We 
took on Big Oil to lower energy prices 
and create jobs, union jobs, in the in-
dustries of the future. We took on Wall 
Street, finally taxing stock buybacks 
that reward CEOs and executives at the 
expense—always at the expense—of 
workers and jobs. 
These are big wins for workers—to-
gether, the biggest steps we have taken 
in decades to create an industrial pol-
icy that puts our most valuable re-
source—American 
workers—first. 
It 
counters the business model where cor-
porations hopscotch the globe in search 
of lower wages and lower wages and 
lower wages. 
From the infrastructure bill, the 
CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction 
Act, we have laid down a new marker. 
The technology of the future, from 
semiconductors to batteries, to electric 
vehicles, will be developed in America, 
made in America by American workers. 
It hasn’t been easy. Our work is far 
from finished, but I am optimistic. I 
see more momentum behind the labor 
movement than at any time in my ca-
reer. All over the country, more and 
more workers are seeing that unions 
are the best way to have a voice, from 
Starbucks to Amazon. Seventy percent 
of Americans—I don’t ever remember it 
being that high—70 percent of Ameri-
cans approve of unions; for sure, the 
highest level of support in 50 years. 
More people than ever want to join a 
union. They know that carrying a 
union card means higher wages. It 
means better benefits. It means better 
working conditions. It means more 
control—particularly for young fami-
lies or families taking care of an aging 
parent—more control over your sched-
ule. 
We 
know 
what 
workers 
are 
up 
against when they organize. Corpora-
tions unleash all their power to fight 
their own workers—too often, illegally. 
It is why I will never stop fighting to 
pass the PRO Act to finally level the 
playing field between workers and cor-
porations in union organizing. 
This week, we honor the workers who 
built this country. We recommit our-
selves to the fights ahead because when 
work has dignity, every American is 
paid the living wage they have earned. 
When workers have dignity, all work-
ers can afford childcare and healthcare 
and housing. When workers have dig-
nity, American workers have retire-
ment security and paid leave and power 
over their schedules and their lives— 
because when you love this country, 
you fight every day for the people who 
make it work. That is what the labor 
movement has done for a century; it is 
what I will continue to do. 
REMEMBERING DAVID KISKA 
Madam President, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in honoring Ohioan 
David Kiska, a Korean war vet, a tank 
commander, and a decorated war hero. 
Mr. Kiska served our country by en-
listing in the Army and fighting in 
Korea. He fought bravely in the Battle 
of Outpost Harry and many other bat-
tles—that battle, one of the most dev-
astating of the war. After 8 days, he 
and his fellow soldiers prevailed, secur-
ing a strategic military route despite 
being significantly outnumbered. The 
Battle of Outpost Harry is remembered 
as an outstanding military feat of the 
Korean war. 
When David returned home to Ohio, 
he worked at the Thew Shovel Com-
pany in Lorain and raised a family. His 
service to our State and to fellow vet-
erans never ended. He became a direc-
tor of the Lorain County Veterans 
Services, where he worked for 20 years 
as head service officer. 
Ohio is blessed in our 88 counties 
that each of our 88 counties has a vet-
erans service officer. Cuyahoga and 
Franklin have dozens of people serving. 
In small counties like Vinton and 
Noble, there is maybe only one vet-
erans service officer, but they are al-
ways there every day to serve veterans. 
David wanted to make sure in that 
job that every veteran received his or 
her full benefits, regardless of when 
and where they served their country. 
He helped with paperwork. He sup-
ported veterans through career transi-
tions. 
For David, the job never ended there. 
He took veterans out to lunch, paying 
out of his own pocket often. He visited 
sick and injured vets just to keep them 
company—a 
friendly 
face 
to 
help 
through hard times. Every Memorial 
Day, he volunteered to put American 
flags on the graves of veterans. 
That was how David Kiska lived his 
life. He fought with bravery; he gave 
back selflessly. He fought with brav-
ery; he gave back selflessly. 
Our thoughts are with his family. We 
recommit ourselves, as we did with the 
Heath Robinson PACT Act, to fol-
lowing his example of serving those 
who have sacrificed so much for our 
country. 
Madam President, I know that Sen-
ator GRASSLEY will speak in a moment.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CONTINUED 
SUCCESS OF ANIMAL FARM BUT-
TER 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in my 
home State of Vermont, where there 
are more cows then people, the local 
dairy industry is the bedrock of our 
communities. From Derby to Pownal, 
small dairy farms provide honest jobs 
and produce fine dairy products sought 
after by Michelin Star restaurants 
across the country. These farms also 
provide the beautiful backdrop of green 
pastures, grazing livestock, and the 
iconic bright red barns that attract 
hundreds of thousands of visitors to 
our picture perfect little State every 
year. 
Unfortunately, due to the COVID–19 
pandemic, consolidation within the ag-
riculture industry, falling milk prices, 
supply chain delays, and the rising 
costs of equipment and other goods, 
small dairy farms have been hit hard. 
These difficulties, both longstanding 
and recent, continue to lead some life-
long Vermont dairy farmers to move 
on to other careers or to retirement, 
where they are often faced with the dif-
ficult decision to either sell their busi-
ness and livestock to large, industrial 
factory farms, or undertake the dif-
ficult journey to find a local farmer 
who can take on their business and be-
loved cows. 
Today, I would like to highlight a 
piece of good news from the Vermont 
small dairy industry, a story of how 
the 
retiring 
founder 
of 
the 
most 
sought-after small-batch cultured but-
ter operation in the country found a 
graduate 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Vermont’s animal science program to 
continue a famous Vermont tradition. 
Together, Vermonters Hilary and Ben 
Haigh, learning from Shoreham’s own 
Diane St. Clair, have continued a bou-
tique butter business—yet another ex-
ample of Vermont perseverance, and 
the 
high-quality 
products 
coming 
Vermont’s small family farms, like the 
Animal Farm Creamery. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
June 10, 2022, New York Times article 
titled ‘‘America’s Most Luxurious But-
ter Lives to Churn Another Day’’ be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, June 10, 2022] 
AMERICA’S MOST LUXURIOUS BUTTER LIVES 
TO CHURN ANOTHER DAY 
(By Melissa Clark) 
SHOREHAM, VT.—In a wooden barn perched 
on a grassy hill, some of the most celebrated 
cows in the dairy business—the bovine royal 
family of American fancy butter—sampled 
hay in their new abode. 
Diva, the bossiest of the group, hovered re-
gally over the shy, gentle Cinnamon. Lying 
down were Ruby and Lacy, who were chewing 
cud over their folded forelegs. Rutabaga, 
May and Patch ruminated impassively as 
Dell peed, effusively, in greeting. 
A few months earlier, in February, the 
herd’s former owner, Diane St. Clair, loaded 
them onto a trailer and drove them seven 
miles down the road from her Animal Farm 
Creamery in Orwell, Vt., to Rolling Bale 
Farm in Shoreham, a 100-acre organic prop-
erty nestled into a clearing about an hour 
south of Burlington. 
‘‘That was a hard day,’’ Ms. St. Clair said. 
‘‘But there was no way for me to continue.’’ 
Ms. St. Clair had spent the previous 22 
years making the most sought-after small- 
batch cultured butter in the United States. 
It’s the same butter that the chef Thomas 
Keller serves at the French Laundry and Per 
Se—and that retails for an eye-popping $60 
per pound. 
But at 65, she was ready to retire. Decades 
of twice-daily milking, barn mucking and 
hoisting 70-pound jugs of fresh milk into the 
butter churn had taken a toll on her back. 
Her husband, Al Clarisse, a large-animal vet-
erinarian who was her only helper, had de-
veloped knee problems. And although her 
heart still clung to her cherished Jersey 
cows (her ‘‘other family,’’ as she called 
them), her creative urges had shifted from 
butter to a new, more sedentary, but just as 
aromatic, passion: blending exclusive per-
fumes. 
The question was, would she be able to find 
the right people to take on her treasured 
herd and her churn? Or would her extraor-
dinary butter, with its subtle nutty, grassy 
flavors that changed with the seasons, sim-
ply disappear? 
For many small dairies in Vermont, retire-
ment can be a heartbreaking matter of sell-
ing off cows and equipment to large agri-
businesses and calling it quits. In 1969, 
Vermont had 4,017 dairy farms, most of them 
small, family-run operations. By 2020, that 
number had dropped by 84 percent to 636, 
with many having consolidated to benefit 
from economies of scale. 
Even at farms where the next generation 
wants to step up, dairy farmers are finding it 
increasingly difficult to make a living. A na-
tional oversupply of milk, made worse dur-
ing the pandemic, brought down prices to the 
point where it may no longer make financial 
sense to keep going. 
All of this has caused the demise of many 
beloved farms and dairy products, including 
the prizewinning cheeses from Orb Weaver 
Creamery, whose owners spent years trying 
to 
pass 
on 
their 
dairy 
to 
young 
cheesemakers before finally having to sell 
off their last cow and close down. This was 
something Ms. St. Clair intended to prevent: 
Keeping her business intact and her bovine 
‘‘other family’’ together—and far from any 
industrial mega-farms—was her top priority. 
‘‘I wanted my cows to go to a farm that 
would treat them like I did, with people who 
would know their names, and who would 
name their calves,’’ she said. 
Happily, Ms. St. Clair’s story is a rare 
piece of good news in the world of small 
dairies. It’s an example of how one single- 
minded, cow-loving farmer was able to cre-
ate a market for the kind of handmade cul-
tured butter that had nearly gone extinct in 
the United States. Then, through a combina-
tion of resolve and serendipity, she was able 
to pass that business to a young family with 
exactly the right kind of grit, experience and 
disposition to carry it on. And they hap-
pened to live just down the road. 
Building a Better Butter 
‘‘I wanted my cows to go to a farm that 
would treat them like I did, with people who 
would know their names, and who would 
name their calves,’’ she said. 
Happily, Ms. St. Clair’s story is a rare 
piece of good news in the world of small 
dairies. It’s an example of how one single- 
minded, cow-loving farmer was able to cre-
ate a market for the kind of handmade cul-

tion of resolve and serendipity, she was able 
to pass that business to a young family with 
exactly the right kind of grit, experience and 
disposition to carry it on. And they hap-
pened to live just down the road. 
When Ms. St. Clair started Animal Farm in 
1999, she knew she wanted to raise Jersey 
cows. With them came a seemingly endless 
river of milk that needed a purpose. 
‘‘Everyone else in Vermont was doing 
cheese,’’ Ms. St. Clair said, ‘‘I saw a niche 
with butter.’’ Specifically, the kind of tangy, 
high-fat, marigold-colored butter she’d eaten 
in Europe, for which the ultra-creamy milk 
her Jersey cows produced was perfectly suit-
ed. (Most dairy cows in the United States are 
Holsteins, which yield a larger quantity of 
milk with a lower fat content.) Back then, 
no one she knew in the United States was 
making small batches of European-style but-
ter from their own cows, and there were no 
guidelines for how to do it. The nearby 
Vermont Creamery had started making Eu-
ropean-style butter a year earlier, in 1998, 
but from purchased milk, which, like mak-
ing wine from purchased grapes, puts the ag-
ricultural part of the equation out of the 
producer’s control. 
Besides, Ms. St. Clair said, ‘‘I was in it for 
the cows.’’ 
Relying on out-of-print dairy manuals 
from the 19th century, she eventually figured 
out that culturing the cream before churning 
it, a process also called clabbering, vastly 
improved both the taste and the texture, 
making the end result thicker and more pli-
ant, and adding a pleasing nuttiness. 
Culturing is a standard practice for pre-
mium butter in Europe, and it was in the 
United States as well before the widespread 
industrialization of the dairy industry shift-
ed to uncultured ‘‘sweet’’ butter, those pale, 
bland sticks in the supermarket, because it 
was faster and cheaper to produce at scale. 
(The intense labor involved in producing 
small quantities of handmade butter from 
Ms. St. Clair’s own Jersey cows, along with 
high demand from luxury restaurants, ac-
counts for the extravagant price tag.) 
Once Ms. St. Clair was satisfied with her 
experiments, she overnighted a sampler 3,000 
miles away to a famous chef she’d never met, 
along with a handwritten letter requesting 
his feedback. Thomas Keller remembered the 
moment well. 
‘‘Diane sent me five little knobs of mis-
shapen butter in a Ziploc bag,’’ he said. ‘‘I 
called her immediately and said, ‘How much 
do you make? We’ll buy it all.’ ’’ 
Eventually, she built a small dairy near 
the barn, brought in a few more Jersey cows 
and, still working mostly by herself and by 
hand, increased production to 100 pounds of 
butter per week and the plush, lightly sour 
buttermilk that was its byproduct. 
This was the business she had needed to 
sell. Ben and Hilary Haigh, both 33, of Roll-
ing Bale Farm turned out to be the ideal 
buyers. 
GREENER PASTURES FOR A CHERISHED HERD 
Hilary Haigh has always been ‘‘a little ob-
sessed with butter,’’ she said. 
When she was studying animal science at 
the University of Vermont, her brother gave 
her a countertop butter churn, which she 
used for years before switching to a food 
processor when she and Ben married. 
The couple met, coincidentally, at Animal 
Farm when they were both in college. Ms. 
Haigh, who grew up on a nearby farm, was 
cow- and house-sitting for Ms. St. Clair. Mr. 
Haigh was helping his uncle build the dairy’s 
roof. 
The two started Rolling Bale Farm in 2014, 
raising pastured beef, chicken and lamb to 
sell at the local farmers’ market. They also 
kept a family cow to provide plenty of milk 
to drink and to feed Ms. Haigh’s churn.

Having a microdairy like Ms. St. Clair’s 
was a dream, Ms. Haigh said, ‘‘it just hap-
pened sooner than we anticipated.’’ 
When she and Mr. Haigh heard that Ms. St. 
Clair was looking for buyers, they sent her a 
handwritten letter expressing their interest. 
It reminded Ms. St. Clair of the letter she’d 
sent Mr. Keller all those years ago. ‘‘Who 
sends letters anymore?’’ Ms. St. Clair said. 
‘‘It’s like it’s all come full circle.’’ 
After piecing together two loans and a 
grant to come up with the $281,000 necessary 
to buy the business and install a dairy at 
Rolling Bale Farm, the Haighs took over 
Animal Farm Creamery in January. (Ms. St. 
Clair wanted to retire on her farm, so the 
business and cows were sold, but not her 
property.) 
Now, several times every week, Ms. Haigh 
makes butter and buttermilk exactly as Ms. 
St. Clair taught her: by hand, by herself, in 
a dairy built on the same pasture where the 
Haighs’ herd grazes, but with the addition of 
her two young sons tumbling underfoot, eat-
ing as much butter and cream as they can 
get their small hands on. 
Then, once a week, she ships the butter to 
the same six accounts that Ms. St. Clair had 
long supplied: Thomas Keller, the Inn at Lit-
tle Washington in Virginia, Menton in Bos-
ton, Ocean House in Rhode Island, Dedalus 
Wine Shop and Market in Vermont, and 
Saxelby Cheesemongers in New York. 
So far, Ms. Haigh said, none of the ac-
counts seemed to notice the change of hands. 
Benoit 
Breal, 
an 
owner 
of 
Saxelby 
Cheesemongers, said the transition had been 
‘‘100 percent seamless.’’ 
‘‘The quality is the same,’’ he said, ‘‘it’s 
still the quintessential artisanal butter. 
There’s no one else doing it like that.’’ 
For her part, Ms. St. Clair misses her cows. 
But she’s happy to have the time to immerse 
herself in orris root, ylang-ylang and the 
other heady tools of perfumery needed for 
St. Clair Scents. 
And Diva, Cinnamon, Dell and the rest of 
the herd seem to have fully adapted to their 
new home. ‘‘Ben and Hilary love their ani-
mals; they’re good farmers,’’ Ms. St. Clair 
said. ‘‘Now when I go to visit the cows, 
they’re like, ‘Oh, hi, Diane.’ ’’ 
She paused and added, a little wistfully, 
‘‘They’re doing fine without me.’’

RECOGNIZING THE GRANITE 
INDUSTRY IN BARRE, VERMONT 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
have been honored that Vermonters 
have sent me here to the U.S. Senate 
to represent them for many years. In 
turn, I always welcome the oppor-
tunity to recognize the commitments, 
achievements, 
and 
successes 
of 
Vermonters and the industries found in 
the Green Mountain State. Today, I 
want to highlight the granite center of 
the world—not Italy, China, or Brazil— 
but Barre, a small town of just over 
8,500 
year-round 
residents 
nestled 
among the Green Mountains in central 
Vermont. 
It was 350 million years ago when 
geologic processes created a unique 
granite formation 10 miles deep, 4 
miles long, and 2 miles wide in the 
heart of present-day Barre. This ex-
traordinary formation is now home to 
the world’s largest deep-hole granite 
quarry that produces a form of granite 
called ‘‘Barre Gray.’’ Known around 
the world as the finest quality gray 
granite on the market, Barre Gray has 
been an economic engine and tourist 
attraction in central Vermont since 
the first quarry opened in the 19th cen-
tury. Barre Gray is renowned by fine 
architects, builders, and sculpture art-
ists in every corner of the world and is 
just another example of the exports 
coming from Vermont and extracted by 
Vermonters. 
The granite industry in Barre has 
brought jobs and economic opportunity 
to thousands of Vermonters over the 
years, including many immigrants. 
Like my grandparents, many people 
came to Vermont from Europe in the 
19th and 20th centuries in search of a 
better life. Through a combination of 
hard work, skill, luck, and the geologic 
processes that created Barre Gray 350 
million years ago, many Scottish, 
Irish, and Italian immigrants were able 
to build better lives for themselves in 
Vermont working in the granite indus-
try. Unfortunately, many of the immi-
grants working in the Barre granite in-
dustry also died in high numbers dur-
ing the 1918 influenza pandemic. As 
many of the Vermonters we tragically 
lost to COVID–19 are now laid to rest 
under Barre Gray granite headstones, 
so too are many of those who worked 
the Barre granite quarry over 100 years 
ago. 
Today, the granite quarry and sur-
rounding manufacturing facilities em-
ploy more than 1,000 Vermonters who 
create the vast majority of the granite 
used in headstones and memorials in 
the United States. The Rock of Ages 
visitor center offers tours of the quarry 
and their 160,000-square-foot manufac-
turing facility, which in addition to 
the nearby Vermont Granite Museum, 
attract more than 100,000 visitors per 
year. These institutions also serve as 
important educational experiences for 
classes of local school children who fre-
quently take field trips to see the geol-
ogy taught in their textbooks take 
place in real life. 
The granite industry and its history 
in Barre were profiled in a June 16, 
2022, article published in the Wash-
ington Post. I ask unanimous consent 
that the article titled, ‘‘In Barre, Vt., 
granite is a way of life—and beyond,’’ 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, June 16, 2022] 
IN BARRE, VT., GRANITE IS A WAY OF LIFE— 
AND BEYOND 
(By Walter Nicklin) 
If one’s final earthly travel destination is a 
graveyard, then the penultimate stop might 
well be Barre, Vt., the self-proclaimed ‘‘gran-
ite center of the world.’’ Here, in the scenic 
foothills of the Green Mountains, are the 
quarries that produce many of America’s 
most sought-after tombstones. 
Business is booming. The pandemic’s ‘‘ex-
cess mortality’’ has meant increased demand 
for quality granite to be quarried, then craft-
ed into memorials. Moreover, as aging baby 
boomers realize they won’t live forever, they 
often embrace their own mortality by pur-
chasing ‘‘pre-need memorials.’’ 
Even if you don’t like the idea of picking 
your own tombstone, Barre (pronounced 
‘‘Barry’’) is worth a visit. You’ll gain an ap-
preciation for what you may have previously 
taken for granted, or simply preferred not to 
contemplate—namely, 
gravestones. 
You’ll 
learn about their fascinating history, along 
with the remarkable industry and craft re-
quired in creating them. Most fundamen-
tally, you’ll be exposed to the geological 
story behind the sturdy stone that carvers 
use to immortalize human transience. 
Although 
small 
(population 
less 
than 
10,000), Barre is easy to find, just seven miles 
from the state capital of Montpelier. Signage 
for Exit 6 on Interstate 89 lets you know this 
is where the ‘‘Granite Quarries’’ are. You 
then might drive along Quarry Street or 
Stone Road on your way to a place called 
Graniteville. Along the way, you may pass 
the Cornerstone Pub & Kitchen, spot fence 
posts made out of granite and catch sight of 
what otherwise would be unremarkable com-
mercial signs, such as for lawyers’ offices, 
engraved in granite. 
Granite, granite, everywhere—highlighting 
the town’s economic raison d’etre and the 
stone artistry of its residents. In front of the 
public library stands a stone statue of 
Charles Dickens’s Mr. Pickwick. Another 
statue—of the poet Robert Bums, next to the 
Vermont History Center—was erected by the 
19th-century Scottish masons who brought 
their stonecutting skills to Barre. On the 
other side of town is another, equally impos-
ing 
statue 
personifying 
the 
Italian 
stonemasons who also brought their skills to 
Barre. 
The European immigrants brought with 
them a tradition of organized labor, and 
Barre became the headquarters for the Quar-
ry Workers’ International Union of North 
America. Still standing on Granite Street is 
the old Socialist Labor Party Hall, listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places in 
2000. 
Rock of Ages—not the hymn but a quarry 
company with a visitor center of the same 
name—is perhaps Barre’s single biggest tour-
ist draw, typically attracting more than 
100,000 visitors annually. In the fall, when 
the leaves turn colorful, attendance peaks. 
But in mid-May, on the very first day it 
opened for the summer season, my wife, Pat, 
and I were pleased to find not much of a 
crowd. In fact, ours was one of only three 
cars in the caravan that Roger, the tour 
guide, led from the visitor center to the huge 
Rock of Ages excavation site called the E.L. 
Smith Quarry. Still, Roger jotted on an 
index card the number of cars and the num-
ber of occupants in each car, so he could be 
sure that he could account for everyone at 
tour’s end—that no one had fallen and van-
ished into the massive hole in the ground. 
Covering about 50 acres and almost 600 feet 
deep, it lays claim to being the world’s larg-
est operating deep-hole quarry for dimension 
stone. (Crushed stone—gravel—is the product 
of other quarries.) 
Now retired after having worked most of 
his life in the quarry, Roger knew whereof he 
spoke. He explained that the granite quar-
ried here—known as ‘‘Barre Gray’’—is known 
worldwide for its fine grain, even texture and 
superior weather resistance. Its unique pro-
portions of quartz and feldspar (granite’s 
main ingredients) make it especially hard 
while also exceptionally receptive to intri-
cate carving and sculpting. 
The granite was formed as intrusive igne-
ous rock approximately 350 million years 
ago. Called a pluton by geologists, the Barre 
granite formation is calculated to be four 
miles long, two miles wide and 10 miles deep. 
Based on what had been extracted since the 
Barre quarries began operation in the 19th 
century, Roger estimated that ‘‘it would 
take 4,500 years to extract all the granite.’’ 
Perched on the quarry’s edge was a chain- 
link fence to prevent visitors like us from

falling in. I had seen many quarries over the 
years, but nothing like this. As if guarding a 
precious artwork, the fence barrier seemed 
to make the scene that much more spectac-
ular, even otherworldly. The quarry’s sheer 
sides, where blocks and slabs had been cut 
away, looked like a huge canvas of abstract 
art, with oxidized water stains dripping like 
paint. At the very bottom was a turquoise 
pool, this seemingly out-of-place color cre-
ated by granite sediments and crystals in the 
water when slabs of rock are cut. Framing 
the scene in the far distance, the distinctive 
outline of Camel’s Hump, Vermont’s third- 
highest peak, punctuates the horizon. 
About five miles away is the Vermont 
Granite Museum, housed in a renovated 
manufacturing shed that dates from the tum 
of the last century. Although massive (about 
30,000 square feet), it was called a ‘‘shed’’ for 
its open layout and cathedral-like ceiling. 
Machinery to cut and move the granite 
blocks was powered by a dam and turbines 
on the nearby Stevens Branch of the 
Winooski River. A railroad spur, leading di-
rectly to the shed, could then transport the 
finished stonework. Today’s visitors are 
transported back in time through hands-on 
exhibits and collections of rock specimens 
and old tools, even industrial rollers made of 
granite. 
Nearby Hope Cemetery showcases local 
granite and the artistry it spawned. Estab-
lished in 1895, the 65-acre, parklike setting is 
a splendid example of the 19th-century gar-
den cemetery movement, which favored bur-
ials in rural, nonsectarian settings. The co-
incident, ever-more-popular use of granite 
for tombstones and memorials created an 
outdoor museum of sculpture. The once-prev-
alent 
sandstone 
slates 
and 
marble 
headstones proved much less enduring than 
granite. 
I’ve been called a tombstone tourist for 
past pilgrimages to the dead-celebrity-popu-
lated burial ground Pe`re Lachaise in Paris 
and Cimitero Acattolico, the Roman ceme-
tery where the poet John Keats’s gravestone 
famously reads, ‘‘Here lies One Whose Name 
was writ in Water.’’ But you don’t have to be 
a melancholic taphophile to appreciate the 
artistry on display in Hope Cemetery, such 
as a Pieta`-like statue and realistic represen-
tations of violins and airplanes. It’s the 
‘‘Uffizi of Necropolises,’’ in the words of 
Vermont folklorist Joseph A. Citro. All of 
the monuments are made of Barre Gray, and 
virtually all have been sculpted by Barre 
stonemasons—some for their own graves be-
fore they died. 
For Pat and me, who had lost one old 
friend to covid–19, a lone granite memorial 
in Hope Cemetery seemed especially poign-
ant. Erected on the centenary of the 1918 
pandemic, it commemorated the many Barre 
residents who had died of the flu. They had 
suffered disproportionately because of their 
existing silicosis (called stonecutters’ dis-
ease) from inhaling granite dust while work-
ing in unventilated sheds. 
Our visit to Barre was not all about death 
and granite, however. The trip easily in-
cluded the Vermont fare of covered bridges, 
village greens, white church spires and 
maple syrup. Indeed, Pat insisted that we ex-
perience that quintessential summertime 
taste of the Green Mountain State: a frosty 
creemee. ‘‘What’s that?’’ I asked. The deli-
cious answer came at the Morse Farm Maple 
Sugarworks: towering swirls of soft ice 
cream, especially creamy, served in a cup or 
cone, accented with a generous portion of 
maple syrup or straight maple sugar. 
As granite is hard and enduring, a creemee 
is soft and ephemeral—a most harmonious 
balance. 
RECOGNIZING STAFF 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to enter into 
the RECORD the names of my staff who 
worked tirelessly to serve the constitu-
ents of Massachusetts and to pass the 
Inflation Reduction Act. Many of these 
staffers stayed up late into the night 
on Saturday, August 5, 2022, and into 
the next day on Sunday, August 6, 2022, 
in order to secure the passage of this 
transformative piece of legislation. 
As I told my team in the hours after 
the bill passed the Senate, we made 
history today. There are tremendous 
policy achievements in this legislation: 
a plan to cut carbon emissions by 40 
percent over the next 8 years, capped 
spending on prescription drugs for sen-
iors and finally—finally—authorizing 
Medicare 
to 
negotiate 
some 
drug 
prices. For the first time in 30 years, 
we have raised corporate taxes for be-
hemoth corporations. Policy is my love 
language, but that is because all this 
wonkiness is ultimately about people— 
little kids who have fewer asthma at-
tacks and older people who don’t have 
to choose between filling a prescription 
and having a meal and maybe a break-
through that means both our democ-
racy and our earth will survive. Mak-
ing these kinds of changes is exactly 
why I am here. 
To all of you, I offer my deepest 
thanks. Without you, I couldn’t fight 
the righteous fights. But with you, we 
have already made big, structural 
change—and I am convinced there is 
more to come.

HONORING PRIVATE JOHN 
SHAUGHNESSY 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
would like to share a few words today 
to honor the life and service of Private 
John Shaughnessy, a first-class Mon-
tanan and World War I veteran. 
A native son of the Treasure State, 
John was born and raised in Missoula. 
His father, John A. Shaughnessy, was 
one of Missoula’s pioneer builders who 
constructed a portion of the original 
buildings at Fort Missoula. 
Never one to shy away from service 
or sacrifice, John answered the call to 
duty at the outbreak of World War I by 
enlisting in the U.S. Army. He was a 
member of the 339th Infantry and 
served in the American North Russia 
Expeditionary force, more commonly 
known as the Polar Bear Expedition. 
During 
that 
expedition, 
Private 
Shaughnessy sadly contracted and died

of pneumonia in Archangel, Russia, on 
September 15, 1918. He was buried in 
the American cemetery in the town 
until his body was able to be removed 
and returned to Missoula in 1929. 
While Private Shaughnessy was fi-
nally laid to rest in his native land, he 
never received the proper military 
headstone he deserved and earned. 
It is my honor to say today, 104 years 
after his passing, Private Shaughnessy 
will at last receive his long-overdue 
military headstone in Missoula. 
While our debt of gratitude to him 
can never be fully repaid, this military 
honor rightly ensures his sacrifices in 
service to our Nation will never be for-
gotten. 
He is an American hero who has 
made Montana proud, and our country 
would not be what it is today without 
him and others in uniform who put 
their life on the line in return for our 
freedoms. 
On behalf of myself and a grateful na-
tion, I extend our deepest appreciation 
to him and his family.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING BURTON ‘‘BURT’’ 
ALBERT 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to recognize Mr. Bur-
ton ‘‘Burt’’ Albert, a Connecticut na-
tive and remarkable man. Sadly, Mr. 
Albert passed away in 2019, at the age 
of 86. He will be remembered for his 
tireless commitment to community 
service and his deep devotion to his 
wonderful family. 
Born in Waterbury, Burt spent much 
of his life in Connecticut, attending 
Cheshire Academy and Amherst Col-
lege, where he graduated with a bach-
elor of arts in 1954. A member of the 
ROTC program, Mr. Albert went on to 
serve for 2 years as an intelligence offi-
cer in the U.S. Air Force. Burt re-
mained proud of his time in the mili-
tary, and I applaud his strong sense of 
patriotism and record of military serv-
ice. 
It was also in the Air Force where 
Mr. Albert met the love of his life, Syl-
via Meisel, who would become his wife 
of 61 years. They would go on to build 
a wonderful family together, having 
three children—Eric, Jonathan, and 
Debbie—and many grandchildren they 
adored. Mr. Albert was a remarkable 
family man and cherished time with 
his loved ones above all else. 
Mr. Albert returned to Connecticut 
to work in his family’s scrap metal re-
cycling business. Burt became the 
third generation of Alberts to lead Al-
bert Bros. Inc., a company that re-
cently celebrated 125 years of out-
standing industry in the State of Con-
necticut. I have visited Albert Bros. 
and seen firsthand the amazing new 
methods for turning waste material 
into a useful new resource. The com-
pany is an integral part of Waterbury 
commerce. 
Under Mr. Albert’s leadership, Albert 
Bros. grew substantially, and he was 
respected by employees and customers 
alike. Amid all his success, working 
with his sons and grandson in the fam-
ily business was one of the highlights 
of Mr. Albert’s professional career. 
Mr. Albert devoted much of his time 
to serving the Waterbury community, 
bringing his tremendous leadership 
skills to many organizations including 
St. Mary’s Hospital, the Jewish Fed-
eration of Western Connecticut, the 
Harold Leever Cancer Center, and the 
Connecticut Community Foundation. 
Mr. Albert was also very active in the 
United Way of Greater Waterbury and 
B’nai Israel Synagogue. In these en-
deavors, Burt generously gave so much 
of his time and resources to helping 
others. 
Burton Albert leaves behind a re-
markable legacy of service—to our 
country, the State of Connecticut, and 
his community. But he will be remem-
bered most by his loving family as an 
extraordinary 
husband, 
father, 
and 
grandfather. Burt’s sense of humor, 
passion for learning, and conviction in 
his beliefs are models for all of us. I 
hope my colleagues will join me in 
celebrating the life of Mr. Burton Al-
bert.∑

REMEMBERING JUDGE GREG RAY 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Sevier County Judge Greg Ray, who 
passed away on August 30, 2022, at the 
age of 61. 
Judge Ray was a beloved member of 
his community and a fearless advocate 
for his constituents about whom he 
cared deeply. Those who had the 
chance to work with him remember his 
sense of humor, determination, and 
kindness. 
Since 2010, Judge Ray served as a 
county leader and was intimately in-
volved in a number of county and State 
organizations, including the County 
Judges 
Association 
of 
Arkansas— 
CJAA—where he served as first vice 
president and developed close relation-
ships with county judges across the 
State. CJAA Chief Legal Counsel Mark 
Whitmore reflected that Judge Ray 
‘‘was a dear friend, full of life and al-
ways had a big smile and happy dis-
position. He was a pillar of the CJAA 
and a leader in his community.’’ 
Judge Ray was an instrumental fig-
ure in establishing the new Sevier 
County Medical Center, which is set to 
open at the end of this year. At the 
ground-breaking ceremony, he praised 
the residents of Sevier County for the 
high voter turnout in support of the 
new medical facility. ‘‘The citizens 
didn’t just show up. They showed out,’’ 
he said. 
Thanks to his leadership and advo-
cacy, the new hospital will bring much 
needed assistance to the people of rural 
southwest Arkansas, a legacy his loved 
ones and the citizens he served will be 
proud to reflect and carry on for years 
to come. 
Outside of his role as county judge, 
he enjoyed fishing and served as a key 
organizer for the Sevier County Cham-
ber of Commerce’s annual Tri-Lakes 
Big Bass Festival. He also hosted the 
annual Senior Citizens Day celebration 
on 
the 
Sevier 
County 
Courthouse 
Square. 
I join Judge Greg Ray’s family, 
friends, and all Arkansans in mourning 
his passing. He set a worthy example 
for his hard-working staff and county 
judges across the State to emulate, and 
the people of Arkansas are grateful for 
his dedication to better our lives and 
communities.∑

TRIBUTE TO J. DAVID BAILEY 
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
rise today to celebrate the achieve-
ments of a West Virginian who trium-
phantly fought for our country during 
World War II. J. David Bailey, who was 
recently awarded the highest French 
recognition—the Legion of Honor—is 
one of the oldest surviving veterans of 
the Battle of the Bulge. His story is an 
extraordinary example of the American 
philosophy to fight for freedom around 
the world. 
David was born in Bluefield, WV, on 
January 3, 1922. At the age of 21, he, 
like 16 million other Americans, an-
swered the call to fight against tyr-
anny. He became a dedicated member 
of the battalion of the U.S. Army’s 
422nd Regiment, 106th Infantry Divi-
sion. 
On December 16, 1944, at the begin-
ning of the Battle of the Bulge, the 
bloodiest and largest battle of World 
War II, David and his entire battalion 
were imprisoned by German troops east 
of St. Vith, Belgium. Ultimately, he es-
caped imprisonment to rejoin his fel-
low soldiers and went on to serve in 
other campaigns, including northern 
France and the Army of Occupation. 
He was honorably discharged from the 
U.S. Army on November 24, 1945. 
In recognition of his honorable serv-
ice to our country, David has received 
the 
Combat 
Infantry 
Badge, 
two 
Bronze Stars, four Battle Stars, and 
four service ribbons, as well as the 
Order of St. Maurice Medallion from 
the National Infantry Association. He 
also appeared on the cover of a victory 
edition of the military publication 
‘‘Stars and Stripes.’’ 
David has also been a key figure in 
preserving the history of World War II 
throughout the years. At one point, he 
served as the national president of the 
Battle of the Bulge Association. On 
January 25, 2022, at the age of 100, 
David was one of several veterans to 
lay the wreath at the Tomb of the Un-
known Soldier at the Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery to commemorate the 
end of the Battle of the Bulge. He also 
attended the opening ceremonies of the 
World War II Memorial, the 70th anni-
versary of V-E Day in 2015, and he was 
also the personal guest of President 
Barack Obama at the White House for 
the Veterans Day ceremony in 2011.

TRIBUTE TO BENJAMIN PORTARO 
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor decorated West Vir-
ginian Benjamin Portaro. Mr. Portaro 
recently received the French Legion of 
Honor for his service in France during 
World War II. 
Born in a small village in Italy, Mr. 
Portaro’s family immigrated to the 
United States searching for the Amer-
ican dream. Mr. Portaro’s father, Pete, 
found work in the coal mines in 
Anmoore, WV, where the family would 
settle down. The Portaros prospered in 
Anmoore, where young Ben began 
school and helped his parents learn 
English. 
As a young man, Benjamin Portaro 
began work as a construction con-
tractor, working for a local carbon 
plant in Anmoore. In 1943 Mr. Portaro 
entered the Army and was sent to Eu-
rope where he would fight on the 
frontlines in France. Promoted to staff 
sergeant under General George Patton, 
Mr. Portaro was sent to the Battle of 
the Bulge. 
It was during the Germans’ last 
major offensive that Mr. Portaro was 
wounded and captured by the Nazis. 
Taken as a prisoner of war, Mr. 
Portaro was forced to march for miles 
in the dead of the winter, as many of 
his fellow prisoners starved to death. 
Months later, Mr. Portaro and another 
prisoner decided their best chance at 
survival would be trying to escape. 
After dark, they hid in ditches until 
they could run away from their cap-
tors. After 3 days, Portaro and his 
friend were rescued by the American 
Army. At this point, Mr. Portaro 
weighed a mere 100 pounds. After being 
rescued, Benjamin was transported to a 
hospital for treatment and eventually 
made it back home to Anmoore, where 
he would spend his life working for and 
with veterans and prisoners of war. 
Mr. Portaro has received many med-
als for his service, including the Bronze 
Star, the Purple Heart, the Prisoners 
of War medal, WWII Honorable Dis-
charge, American Campaign, Yankee 
Division badge, WWII Victory Medal, 
European Campaign, Army Good Con-
duct Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, 
and Staff Sergeant Badge. 
Mr. Portaro and his wife Claire had 7 
children, 
14 
grandchildren, 
and 
14 
great-grandchildren. After 69 happy 
years, Claire passed away in 2011. Ben 
continues to live in West Virginia and 
is an inspiring voice and story to all. 
Mr. Portaro’s story is one of sac-
rifice, hope, and courage. He is a proud 
West Virginian and a great representa-
tive of our State. I am proud to rep-
resent Mr. Portaro and thrilled that, 
after so many years, he still calls West 
Virginia home.∑ 
RECOGNIZING THE IDAHO 
HOMETOWN HERO AWARDS

POM–188. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of Illi-
nois urging the United States Congress to 
protect, strengthen, and improve the child 
nutrition programs through a Child Nutri-
tion and WIC Reauthorization Act that 
builds on the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act 
of 2010 to ensure that low-income children 
continue to have access to nutritious meals 
through the year; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 615 
Whereas, Regular access to healthy and af-
fordable meals has been proven to be one of 
the strongest means of improved school per-
formance, improved health, and sound child-
hood development; and 
Whereas, According to 2020 census data, 
Black households reported food insecurity 
rates that were more than twice as high as 
white households; and 
Whereas, Research shows that childhood 
hunger and food insecurity have a range of 
negative impacts on the health, academic 
performance, and overall well-being of chil-
dren; and 
Whereas, Research suggests that older 
Black students may be more likely to skip 
meals during the week than white students; 
and 
Whereas, School nutrition programs offer 
the opportunity to provide healthy food and 
improve dietary quality for students who 
may otherwise not eat; and 
Whereas, School meals can also have a 
positive impact on grades, absences, and tar-
diness among students; and 
Whereas, Students from Black families are 
more likely to receive free or reduced-price

lunches during the school year, and research 
shows students who receive these meals dur-
ing the school year are more likely to face 
food insufficiency in the summer; and 
Whereas, The COVID–19 pandemic led to a 
dramatic spike in the rate of children experi-
encing hunger and food insecurity, peaking 
at 18% of families with children reporting 
their household did not have enough to eat 
in December 2020 according to the Center on 
Budget and Policy Priorities, and also cre-
ated challenges to safely accessing child nu-
trition programs; and 
Whereas, Substantial racial and ethnic dis-
parities in food insecurity exist among par-
ents of school-age children, and Black fami-
lies experienced significant hardship as a re-
sult of the pandemic; and 
Whereas, Approximately four in 10 families 
with parents who are Black (40.8%) reported 
food insecurity in the prior 30 days, almost 
triple the rate of families with white parents 
(15.1%); and 
Whereas, The COVID–19 pandemic has 
caused an ongoing increase in the scope and 
scale of children experiencing hunger and 
food insecurity, with the most recent esti-
mates from Feeding America showing that 13 
million may face hunger in 2021 compared 
with the all-time low of 11 million in 2019, 
according to USDA; and 
Whereas, Non-congregate meal delivery op-
tions were especially critical in distributing 
meals to children in rural and hard to reach 
communities or where transportation chal-
lenges make it difficult for programs to dis-
tribute meals at a localized site; and 
Whereas, Child nutrition programs are the 
front line of defense against childhood hun-
ger and food insecurity, promoting healthy 
eating and providing healthy, nutritious food 
for the nation’s children through the Na-
tional 
School 
Lunch 
Program 
(NSLP), 
School Breakfast Program (SBP), Summer 
EBT for Children (SEBTC), Pandemic-EBT, 
the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), 
and Special Supplemental Nutrition Pro-
gram for Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC); and 
Whereas, The SEBTC Program reaches 
children who most need additional food sup-
port over summer and school breaks and is 
proven to reduce food insecurity among chil-
dren; and 
Whereas, P-EBT, a temporary program 
providing a grocery benefit to children who 
have lost access to free and reduced priced 
meals at school due to COVID–19, has been 
highly effective at reducing food insecurity; 
and 
Whereas, The CEP program promotes eq-
uity and reduces stigma for families and has 
been proven to reduce hunger and improve 
student outcomes; and 
Whereas, A proven barrier to continued 
participation in the WIC Program is unavail-
ability of remote appointments, short cer-
tification periods, and lack of flexibility in 
food purchasing, ordering, and delivery; and 
Whereas, Millions of children benefit from 
these programs, including the 21.5 million 
low-income children who participated in the 
school lunch program and the 12.4 million 
who participated in the school breakfast pro-
gram in the 2018–2019 school year, as well as 
the 6.3 million mothers and children who re-
ceived food and nutrition education through 
WIC and 2.8 million children who ate summer 
meals in 2019; and 
Whereas, The Healthy, Hunger Free Kids 
Act of 2010 has improved the nutritional 
standards for school nutrition programs, and 
as a result, kids have access to increased 
fruits, vegetables, and whole grains but less 
sugars, fats, and sodium; Congress has the 
opportunity to ensure that children continue 
to have access to nutritious and quality 
meals to help prevent childhood hunger and 
obesity; and 
Whereas, Congress has an opportunity to 
improve and strengthen access to nutrition 
through the 2021 Child Nutrition Reauthor-
ization (CNR) bill by making permanent the 
COVID–19 waiver flexibilities that help to 
better reach children and by including provi-
sions that would increase access and reach 
more kids through streamlining, reducing 
administrative burdens, and providing pro-
gram flexibility, giving them the access to 
quality meals that they have during the 
school year; and 
Whereas, An adequately funded and evi-
dence-based reauthorization bill can reduce 
childhood hunger and food insecurity in 
America, help reduce childhood obesity, im-
prove child nutrition and health, and en-
hance healthy child development and school 
readiness, allowing children to reach their 
full potential; and 
Whereas, Congress has a unique oppor-
tunity in the upcoming reauthorization of 
the Child Nutrition Act to improve and pro-
mote equitable access and nutrition for mil-
lions of children, particularly low-income 
children; Therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the House of Representatives of 
the One Hundred Second General Assembly of 
the State of Illinois, That we urge Congress to 
protect, strengthen, and improve the child 
nutrition programs through a Child Nutri-
tion and WIC Reauthorization Act that 
builds on the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act 
of 2010 to ensure that low-income children 
continue to have access to nutritious meals 
throughout the year; and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge Congress to stream-
line and simplify provisions governing the 
summer meals program in order to reduce 
administrative burdens, bureaucracies, and 
duplications in program administration and 
operation during the reauthorization of the 
Child Nutrition Act; and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge Congress to allow 
for more flexibility around where children 
are able to access and eat summer meals, by 
allowing for non-congregate models in com-
munities where summer meals sites are not 
available and by lowering the threshold re-
quired to operate sites open to all children; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge Congress to perma-
nently authorize the operation of the SEBTC 
program, make program funding mandatory, 
and expand the reach of the program to kids 
eligible for free or reduced-price school 
meals in all states, tribal nations, and local-
ities in order to close the summer meals gap; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge Congress to perma-
nently authorize the PEBT system beyond 
the COVID–19 pandemic, allowing authorities 
to quickly deliver increased nutritional aid 
during times of crisis; and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge Congress to expand 
the well-documented benefits of CEP, which 
allows schools to serve meals at no charge to 
all students if enough are identified as quali-
fying for other assistance programs, by low-
ering the minimum identified student per-
centage (ISP), by increasing the ISP multi-
plier, by expanding direct certification with 
Medicaid data nationwide, and by supporting 
the improvement of direct certification sys-
tems; and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge Congress to in-
crease the flexibility of WIC appointments 
through increased access to remote appoint-
ments and extended certification periods as 
well as to support equitable access to the 
WIC food package through modernization ef-
forts that increase access to online ordering, 
online purchasing, and delivery: and be it 
further 
Resolved, That we support the enactment of 
a Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization 
Act that ensures low-income children’s im-
proved and equitable access to and participa-
tion in the child nutrition programs and in-
cludes the policy goals stated above; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution be delivered to the President of the 
United States, the Vice President of the 
United States, and other federal and state 
government officials and agencies as appro-
priate. 
POM–189. A resolution from the House of 
Representatives of the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico requesting the government of 
the United States to grant a partial exemp-
tion from the application of the Coastwise 
Laws to the maritime transportation of 
crude oil and petroleum products between 
the United States and Puerto Rico for the 
duration of the armed conflict between 
Ukraine and Russia and the collateral effects 
thereof; to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 718 
The implementation of the so-called Coast-
wise Laws in Puerto Rico began with the ap-
proval of the Organic Act of 1900, known as 
the Foraker Act. The Jones Act was subse-
quently approved in 1917 which, among other 
things, maintained the effectiveness of the 
coastwise laws until the present day. The 
Jones Act was enacted at a historical junc-
ture which posed certain challenges to the 
United States of America that are no longer 
a concern. As a result, maritime transpor-
tation from U.S. ports to the Island may 
only be provided by U.S.-built, -owned and 
-crewed vessels. Thus, the U.S. Congress en-
acted legislation providing that, in order to 
move goods between the United States of 
America and Puerto Rico, vessels should not 
only be built in the United States but must 
also be owned and operated by U.S. citizens. 
This federal legislation also applies to Guam 
and the states of Alaska and Hawaii. The 
territory of American Samoa, the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, however, are exempt 
from the Jones Act. 
With regard to maritime transportation, 
on March 14, 2013, the U.S. Government Ac-
countability Office, commonly known as 
GAO, issued a report stating that the Jones 
Act may result in higher freight rates, par-
ticularly for certain goods, than would be 
the case if service by foreign carriers were 
allowed. Likewise, the conclusions of the re-
port state that the original goal of the Act 
remains important to military preparedness 
and to the shipbuilding and maritime indus-
tries, but understanding the full extent and 
distribution of the costs that underlie these 
benefits is elusive. 
It is a well-known fact that Puerto Rico is 
facing difficult economic challenges that 
have worsened with the passage of hurri-
canes Irma and Maria, the earthquakes of 
January 2020, inflation, the ongoing COVID– 
19 emergency, and more recently, the cost of 
fuel, factors that are out of the government 
and the consumer’s control. That is, the ris-
ing oil prices coupled with the effects of in-
flation and the emergencies have steadily in-
creased the prices of food, transportation, 
and electricity, thus adversely affecting con-
sumer and business spending. 
In addition to global security concerns, the 
war between Russia and Ukraine has re-
sulted in a shortage of consumer goods and 
pushed oil prices above $125 per barrel, after 
having remained steady between $80.00 and 
$90.00 for a considerable time. Should this 
war continue and no agreement be reached, 
it might lead to a crude oil shortage in Eu-
rope, which would have repercussions on the 
global market, such as even higher prices. 
There is concern due to the fact that there is 
no indication as to whether the price of

September 7, 2022 
crude oil, goods, and transportation shall 
stabilize any time soon. On the contrary, 
projections show that rising costs and insta-
bility shall persist. 
In spite of our efforts to transform electric 
power generation in Puerto Rico, our system 
still relies primarily on crude oil and petro-
leum products. Likewise, most individual, 
mass transit, and freight motor vehicles on 
the Island run on gasoline or diesel. There-
fore, granting Puerto Rico a partial exemp-
tion from the Jones Act is necessary to pre-
vent future electricity rate increases, miti-
gate the rising costs of gasoline, diesel, 
transportation, as well as the potential 
shortage of crude oil in Europe. 
For all of the foregoing, the House of Rep-
resentatives of the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico deems it necessary to take action in 
order to mitigate the multiplier effect that 
crude oil price fluctuations are having on the 
economy, by requesting the President of the 
United States of America and his govern-
ment to approve a partial exemption from 
the application of the Coastwise Laws to the 
maritime transportation of crude oil and pe-
troleum products between the United States 
of America and Puerto Rico for the duration 
of the armed conflict between Ukraine and 
Russia as well as the collateral thereof. 
Be if resolved by the House of Representatives 
of Puerto Rico: 
Section 1.—The President of the United 
States of America is hereby requested to 
grant a partial exemption from the applica-
tion of Coastwise Laws to the maritime 
transportation of crude oil and petroleum 
products between the United States of Amer-
ica and Puerto Rico for the duration of the 
armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia 
and the collateral effects thereof. The fore-
going for the purpose of addressing the de-
mand for land transportation and energy 
generation on the Island, as well as to miti-
gate what would otherwise be higher crude 
oil prices given the volatility of the inter-
national market. 
Section 2.—A copy of this Resolution, 
translated into the English language, shall 
be delivered to the President of the United 
States of America; the Department of Home-
land Security; the leadership of the United 
States Congress; and the Resident Commis-
sioner of Puerto Rico in Washington, D.C. 
Section 3.—This Resolution shall take ef-
fect upon its approval. 
POM–190. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan opposing the 
designation of additional national wilderness 
areas in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 150 
Whereas, the National Wilderness Preser-
vation System (NWPS), established under 
the Wilderness Act of 1964, is made up of 
more than 800 national wilderness areas, 
which are defined as ‘‘areas of undeveloped 
Federal land retaining their primeval char-
acter and influence, without permanent im-
provements or human habitation.’’ National 
wilderness areas must be formally des-
ignated by Congress, and are subject to spe-
cific management restrictions which gen-
erally aim to preserve them in their natural 
condition; and 
Whereas, Sixteen national wilderness areas 
have already been designated in Michigan, 
including the Beaver Basin; Big Island Lake; 
Delirium, Horeseshoe Bay; Huron Islands; 
Isle Royale; Mackinac; McCormick; Michi-
gan Islands; Nordhouse Dunes, Rock River 
Canyon; Round Island; Seney; Sleeping Bear 
Dunes; Sturgeon River Gorge; and Sylvania 
wildernesses. These areas cover more than 
294,000 acres of land throughout the state; 
and 
Whereas, There is an effort underway to 
ask Congress to designate four more national 
wilderness areas in the Ottawa National For-
est in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula (UP), in-
cluding the Ehlco area; Trap Hills; Norwich 
Plains; and the Sturgeon River Gorge Wil-
derness Addition. Together, these areas 
would add over 65,000 acres to the NWPS in 
Michigan; and 
Whereas, In the Record of Decision for the 
2006 Ottawa National Forest Management 
Plan, the areas proposed for wilderness des-
ignation were determined by the National 
Forest Service to lack wilderness character-
istics. In their decision, the Regional For-
ester reported that the area had ‘‘no features 
or conditions that warrant a recommenda-
tion for wilderness study’’ and has ‘‘low to 
moderate wilderness potential’’; and 
Whereas, There is little evidence that des-
ignating additional wilderness areas would 
result in improving the ecological health of 
the Ottawa National Forest. Once wilderness 
restrictions go into effect, opportunities to 
practice scientifically proven silvicultural 
treatments, such as selective thinning, har-
vesting, and planting; prescribed burning; 
and invasive species management, are lim-
ited. These practices have been crucial in 
helping to restore these areas to the quality 
they are today; and 
Whereas, Potential economic development 
would be limited by wilderness designation. 
Local communities currently benefit from 
economic returns related to timber harvests 
and tourism in the Ottawa National Forest. 
In 2016, the National Forest Service reported 
that the Ottawa National Forest supported 
an estimated 960 jobs, which resulted in more 
than $39.3 million of direct income to local 
communities; and 
Whereas, 
Recreational 
users 
currently 
enjoy a wide range of activities in the Ot-
tawa National Forest, such as hiking, wild-
life viewing, hunting and fishing, camping, 
motorized trail activities, and boating. Wil-
derness designation would significantly limit 
recreational access to these areas by prohib-
iting motorized equipment and mechanical 
transport. Addtionally, enforcing such re-
strictions would increase the burden on enti-
ties charged with managing those lands; 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we oppose the 
designation of additional national wilderness 
areas in Michigian’s Upper Peninsula; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Preseident of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–191. A resolution adopted by the Leg-
islature of Guam expressing support for the 
passage of H.R. 6504, the ‘‘Native Pacific Is-
landers of America Equity Act,’’ because it 
seeks to allow eligible Native CHamoru and 
Native Northern Marianas organizations to 
qualify for federal contracting opportunities 
through their participation in certain small 
business programs that are administered by 
the Small Business Administration; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
RESOLUTION NO. 260–36 
Whereas, I Liheslaturan Gua˚han finds that 
the U.S. Congress stated in the Small Busi-
ness Act at 15 U.S.C. § 63l(f) that ‘‘the oppor-
tunity for full participation in our free en-
terprise system by socially and economically 
disadvantaged persons is essential if we are 
to obtain social and economic equality for 
such persons and improve the functioning of 
our national economy; that many such per-
sons are socially disadvantaged because of 
their identification as members of certain 
groups that have suffered the effects of dis-
criminatory practices or similar invidious 
circumstances over which they have no con-
trol; that such groups include, but are not 
limited to, Black Americans, Hispanic Amer-
icans, 
Native 
Americans, 
Indian 
tribes, 
Asian Pacific Americans, Native Hawaiian 
Organizations, and other minorities; that it 
is in the national interest to expeditiously 
ameliorate the conditions of socially and 
economically disadvantaged groups; that 
such conditions can be improved by pro-
viding the maximum practicable opportunity 
for the development of small business con-
cerns owned by 1 members of socially and 
economically disadvantaged groups; that 
such development can be materially ad-
vanced through the procurement by the 
United States of articles, equipment, sup-
plies, services, materials, and construction 
work from such concerns; and that such pro-
curements also benefit the United States by 
encouraging the expansion of suppliers for 
such 
procurements, 
thereby 
encouraging 
competition among such suppliers and pro-
moting economy in such procurements’’; and 
Whereas, the Small Business Act also 
states in 15 U.S.C. § 637 that ‘‘socially dis-
advantaged individuals are those who have 
been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice 
or cultural bias because of their identity as 
a member of a group without regard to their 
individual qualities’’; and ‘‘economically dis-
advantaged individuals are those socially 
disadvantaged individuals whose ability to 
compete in the free enterprise system has 
been impaired due to diminished capital and 
credit opportunities as compared to others in 
the same business area who are not socially 
disadvantaged’’; and 
Whereas, the 8(a) Business Development 
Program administered by the Small Business 
Administration, commonly known as the 8(a) 
Program, is designed to assist small minor-
ity-owned businesses compete in the wider 
American economy. The 8(a) Program pro-
vides training, technical assistance, and con-
tracting opportunities. One of the program’s 
major benefits is that 8(a) firms can receive 
federal contracting preferences in the form 
of set-aside and sole-source awards. A set- 
aside award is a contract in which only cer-
tain contractors may compete, whereas a 
sole-source award is a contract awarded, or 
proposed for award, without competition. 
The 8(a) Program is limited to eligible busi-
nesses unconditionally owned and controlled 
by one or more socially and economically 
disadvantaged groups; and 
Whereas, the 8(a) Program was originally 
established for the benefit of disadvantaged 
individuals; however, in the 1980s, Congress 
expanded the program to include small busi-
nesses owned by four (4) disadvantaged 
groups, specifically Alaska Native Corpora-
tions (ANCs), Community Development Cor-
porations (CDCs), Indian tribes, and Native 
Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs), also known 
as group-owned 8(a) firms; and 
Whereas, on January 25, 2022, the Native 
Pacific Islanders of America Equity Act was 
introduced in the 117th U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives by Guam Congressman Michael 
San Nicolas and co-sponsored by Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Con-

direct ancestors resided on Guam before Au-
gust 1, 1950. No residency or blood quantum 
amount shall be required for an individual to 
qualify as a ‘Native CHamoru’ under para-
graph (1) of the bill; and 
Whereas, I Liheslaturan Gua˚han finds the 
definition of Native CHamoru in H.R. 6504 is 
tied to 1950 and does not describe the native 
inhabitants of Guam prior to the 1521 con-
tact with outsiders, prior to the over three 
hundred (300)-year occupation by the Span-
ish, prior to the Treaty of Paris, prior to the 
U.S. Naval rule, prior to the World War II oc-
cupation of Guam by the Japanese, or prior 
to the 1950 conveyance by the United States 
Congress of citizenship on the residents of 
Guam; but I Liheslatura further finds for 
purposes of this particular small business 
program that this definition will adequately 
address the disparity and significantly help 
to remedy the needs of Native CHamoru 
businesses of Guam as was the goal of the 
Section 8(a) programs; and 
Whereas, the Native Pacific Islanders of 
America Equity Act would establish under 
the Office of the Governor a ‘‘CHamoru Reg-
istry Program, which shall keep a database 
to serve as a genealogy bank to verify Native 
CHamoru ancestry requirements. The Gov-
ernor of Guam shall include in the database 
the name of any individual who submits to 
the Governor of Guam a request to be in-
cluded and a copy of the birth certificate of 
that individual and birth certificates of di-
rect ancestors that demonstrate that one or 
more of the individual’s direct ancestors re-
sided on Guam before August 1, 1950.’’; and 
Whereas, I Maga’ha˚gan Guahan may re-
quest for an appropriation if necessary from 
I Liheslaturan Gua˚han to cover any imple-
mentation and operating costs; and 
Whereas, H.R. 6504 would also amend the 
Small 
Business 
Act 
to 
include 
Native 
CHamoru organizations and Native Northern 
Marianas organizations as eligible disadvan-
taged groups under the 8(a) Program. In H.R. 
6504, the term ‘Native CHamoru Organiza-
tion’ is defined to mean any organization 
that is a nonprofit corporation that has filed 
articles of incorporation with the director 
(or the designee thereof) of the Guam De-
partment of Revenue and Taxation, or any 
successor agency; that is controlled by Na-
tive CHamorus (as defined in section 4 of the 
Organic Act of Guam); and whose business 
activities will principally benefit Native 
CHamorus. The term ‘Native Northern Mari-
anas Organization’ in H.R. 6504 means any 
organization that is a nonprofit corporation 
that has filed articles of incorporation with 
the secretary (or the designee thereof) of the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands Department of Commerce, or any suc-
cessor agency; that is controlled by persons 
of Northern Marianas descent (as defined in 
Section 4 of Article 12 of the Constitution of 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands); and whose business activities will 
principally benefit persons of Northern Mari-
anas descent; and 
Whereas, I Liheslaturan Gua˚han finds that 
passage of H.R. 6504 would benefit eligible 
Native CHamoru-owned businesses who com-
pete for billions of dollars in federal con-
tracts by providing training, technical as-
sistance and contracting opportunities. In 
FY 2020, 8(a) firms were awarded $34 Billion 
Dollars in federal contracts, including $9.3 
Billion Dollars in 8(a) set-aside awards, $11.1 
Billion Dollars in 8(a) sole-source awards, 
$2.2 Billion Dollars to an 8(a) firm in open 
competition with other firms, and $11.3 Bil-
lion Dollars with another small business 
preference (e.g., set asides and sole-source 
awards for small businesses generally and for 
HUBZone firms, women-owned small busi-
nesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned 
small businesses); and 
Whereas, I Liheslaturan Gua˚han further 
finds that the passage of H.R. 6504, the Na-
tive Pacific Islanders of America Equity Act, 
shall not absolve or relieve the United States 
of any liability for land takings or waive the 
historic demand of the people of Guam for 
return or restoration of the land, nor does it 
negate the rights of the people of Guam to 
self-determination; Now therefore, be it 
Resolved, That I Mina’trentai Sais Na 
Liheslaturan Gua˚han does hereby, on behalf 
of I Liheslaturan Gua˚han and the people of 
Guam, respectfully request that the Con-
gress of the United States include Native 
CHamoru-owned businesses in its small busi-
ness programs targeting socially and eco-
nomically disadvantaged groups; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That I Mina’trentai Sais Na 
Liheslaturan Gua˚han does hereby, on behalf 
of I Liheslaturan Gua˚han and the people of 
Guam, express its support for the passage of 
H.R. 6504, the ‘‘Native Pacific Islanders of 
America Equity Act,’’ because it seeks to 
allow eligible Native CHamoru and Native 
Northern Marianas organizations to qualify 
for 
federal 
contracting 
opportunities 
through their participation in certain small 
business programs that are administered by 
the Small Business Administration; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That the Speaker certify, and the 
Legislative Secretary attest to, the adoption 
hereof, and that copies of the same be there-
after transmitted to the Honorable Joseph R. 
Biden, President of the United States of 
America; to the Honorable Kamala Harris, 
Vice President of the United States; to the 
Honorable 
Nancy

POM–192. A joint memorial adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Idaho opposing 
the removal or breaching of the dams on the 
Columbia-Snake River System and its tribu-
taries; to the Committee on Environment 
and Public Works. 
SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 103 
Whereas, the Idaho Legislature recognizes 
the Colubmia-Snake River System as part of 
the United States Marine Highway network; 
and 
Whereas, the Columbia-Snake River Sys-
tem and its tributaries, collectively and in 
its entirety, are a multiuse system providing 
navigation, transportation, fish and wildlife 
habitat, recreation, hydropower generation, 
flood control, and irrigation to the citizens 
and industry of the Pacific Northwest; and 
Whereas, the Columbia-Snake River Sys-
tem and its tributaries provide a vital con-
tribution to the well-being of the State of 
Idaho and to the quality of life of its citi-
zens, being among the most operationally 
important and cost-effective projects in the 
Federal Columbia River Power System; and 
Whereas, a balanced river system produces 
economic benefits like jobs, trade, and re-
newable electricity while caring for environ-
mental values through good management 
practices and reinvestment in our natural re-
sources; and 
Whereas, no amount of money can replace 
the lifestyle and economies of the commu-
nities that depend upon the Columbia-Snake 
River System’s hydropower, navigation, irri-
gation, flood risk management, recreation, 
and municipal and industrial water supply 
benefits; and 
Whereas, the State of Idaho reasserts and 
confirms sovereign control over all water re-
sources within the state; and 
Whereas, the decline of anadromous fish is 
due to many factors, including increased pre-
dation, unfavorable ocean conditions, and 
harvest levels; and 
Whereas, breaching the four lower Snake 
River dams is an idealistic, single variable 
model to Pacific salmon recovery that flies 
in the face of reality for salmon, is illogical 
from an environmental perspective, hurts in-
dustry and communities, puts politics over 
science and local jobs, and may neither re-
store Idaho salmon nor prevent their extinc-
tion; and 
Whereas, only four of the thirteen Endan-
gered Species Act-listed salmon runs swim 
past the lower Snake River dams, and they 
do so with over 95% survival at each of the 
dams; and 
Whereas, breaching the four lower Snake 
River dams would be a drastic measure that 
would forever alter our way of life in the Pa-
cific Northwest; and 
Whereas, breaching the lower Snake River 
dams is an outdated argument that is not 
supported by current dam passage survival 
studies of juvenile Pacific salmon; and 
Whereas, in 2008, 2014, and 2020 the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion produced biological opinions that stated 
breaching the four lower Snake River dams 
was not necessary action for salmon recov-
ery; and 
Whereas, the governor of Idaho commis-
sioned the Governor’s Salmon Workgroup, a 
diverse group of stakeholders that worked 
for 18 months to study the issue of salmon 
recovery, representing for the first time 
broad interests working collaboratively to 
help shape the state’s salmon and steelhead 
policy; and 
Whereas, that workgroup developed many 
practical recommendations to address the 
issue of improved river systems and habitat 
conditions for healthy salmon populations, 
specifically excluding any recommendations 
for removing dams; and 
Whereas, due to the efforts of the state, 
the Nez Perce Tribe, and Idaho water users 
in entering into the 2004 Snake River Water 
Rights Agreement, up to 487,000 acre-feet of 
Idaho’s water is used for flow augmentation 
for salmon and steelhead in the lower Snake 
and Columbia rivers, with water being re-
leased through willing-buyer, willing-seller 
arrangements. In return for flow augmenta-
tion, the 2004 agreement provides protections 
to Idaho water users in the form of a 30-year 
biological opinion; and 
Whereas, agricultural and industrial appli-
cations of water have a legal priority within 
the state; and 
Whereas, the Port of Lewiston, Idaho’s 
only seaport, is part of the collective Colum-
bia-Snake River System and is an asset to 
the State of Idaho and an asset to the Inland 
Northwest region, providing global competi-
tiveness and connectivity for regional prod-
ucts, economic development investment, and 
multimodal transportation; and 
Whereas, the State of Idaho supports the 
Port of Lewiston activities and believes that 
reservoir drawdowns or removal of the dams 
on the lower Snake and Columbia rivers 
would inflict on the citizenry a loss of recre-
ation, an increase in electric rates, a loss of 
navigation, a risk of floods, economic hard-
ship, and an impaired quality of life; and 
Whereas, cruise boat traffic to the Port of 
Lewiston has steadily increased over the last 
10 years and is projected to increase from

19,000 passengers in 2019 to over 33,000 pas-
sengers in 2022, a growth of 76%, bringing 
much financial growth to the entire Snake 
River area; and 
Whereas, the Columbia-Snake River Sys-
tem acts as a top wheat export gateway in 
the United States, with approximately 10% 
of all United States wheat exports barged 
through the four dams on the Snake River 
and about 50% of all Idaho-grown wheat 
barged from Lewiston to Portland and then 
onto export markets around the world; and 
Whereas, barging on the Columbia and 
Snake rivers is the safest, most fuel-efficient 
means of transporting cargoes in the North-
west, being 40% more fuel-efficient than 
freight trains and 270% more fuel-efficient 
than semitrucks; and 
Whereas, without the ability to barge 
goods down the river, diesel fuel consump-
tion would increase by nearly 5 million gal-
lons per year as barges would be replaced by 
less efficient truck-to-rail shipments, result-
ing in increases in carbon dioxide and other 
harmful emissions by over 1.2 million tons 
per year; and 
Whereas, the Columbia-Snake River Sys-
tem is also highly valued on the west coast 
for forest product exports and mineral ex-
ports, is second in the nation for soy exports, 
and is a major gateway for auto imports and 
exports. Each year, around 250,000 tons of 
wood chips are barged from the Lower Gran-
ite Pool to be turned into pulp for paper pro-
duction at mills on the lower Columbia 
River; and 
Whereas, hydroelectric power is one of the 
best energy sources we have, with clean, reli-
able, renewable baseload generation that is 
more valuable than ever as the four lower 
Snake River dams produce thousands of 
megawatts 
of 
low-cost, 
affordable 
elec-
tricity, which is renewable energy that pro-
vides power to 22 rural Idaho utilities serv-
ing tens of thousands of Idahoans, numerous 
Idaho cities, farmers, and industries, while 
acting as a battery to integrate other inter-
mittent renewable energy resources on the 
system; and 
Whereas, the Idaho Legislature believes 
that 
any 
actions 
to 
degrade 
the 
functionality, in whole or in part, or to re-
move or breach dams on the Columbia-Snake 
River System or its tributaries, or to take 
water from the state for anadromous fish en-
hancement efforts would inflict on the citi-
zenry of the state a loss in economic and 
trade opportunities, a loss of recharge waters 
for the state’s aquifers, a loss of navigation 
and transportation, an increased risk of 
floods, an increase in electrical rates, a 
shortfall in power generation, a loss of rec-
reational opportunities, and a threatened 
quality of life for Idaho citizens; Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, by the members of the First Reg-
ular Session of the Sixty-sixth Idaho Legis-
lature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring therein, that Idaho 
opposes the removal or breaching of the 
dams on the Columbia-Snake River System 
and its tributaries, has sovereignty of its 
water resources, prohibits contributions of 
water from Idaho’s reservoirs for flow aug-
mentation except those expressly authorized 
by state law, contends that efforts for fur-
ther recovery of anadromous fish must be 
based on sound science, and supports mainte-
nance and multiple-use benefits of the Co-
lumbia-Snake River System. Additionally, 
the Idaho Legislature recognizes and sup-
ports 
the 
international 
competitiveness, 
multimodal transportation, and economic 
development benefits provided by the Port of 
Lewiston; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate 
be, and she is hereby authorized and directed 
to forward a copy of this Memorial to the 
President of the Senate and the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives of Congress and 
to 
the 
congressional 
delegations 
rep-
resenting the states of Idaho, Montana, 
Washington, and Oregon in the Congress of 
the United States. 
POM–193. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona 
urging the United States Congress to oppose 
the reporting requirements in the Biden Ad-
ministration’s tax increase proposal for fis-
cal year 2022; to the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2004 
Whereas, the Biden administration’s tax 
increase proposal for fiscal year 2022 includes 
a number of provisions that would place 
undue burdens on banks, small businesses 
and law-abiding American citizens; and 
Whereas, the proposal seeks to increase tax 
enforcement measures by requiring peer-to- 
peer payment transaction apps as well as 
banks and other financial institutions to an-
nually report aggregated data on all account 
inflows and outflows of $600 or more to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the re-
ports would also disclose whether trans-
actions involved physical cash, foreign ac-
counts or transfers between accounts with 
the same owner. These requirements would 
result in serious issues regarding privacy, 
compliance costs and negative impacts on 
low-income communities; and 
Whereas, the proposal’s low $600 threshold 
for reporting would ensnare most active 
bank accounts, including those owned by in-
dividuals and small businesses. As a result, 
the financial data of the majority of bank 
accounts would be sent to the IRS, which ex-
periences more than one bill on cyberattacks 
each 
year. 
In 
addition, 
a 
June 
202l 
ProPublica article revealed a massive leak of 
tax return data from the IRS, demonstrating 
that the agency is unable or unwilling to 
protect taxpayer information. Considering 
its many vulnerabilities in cybersecurity, 
the IRS should not be trusted with more pri-
vate information; and 
Whereas, by holding financial institutions 
responsible for data collection and reporting. 
the proposal would force banks to increase 
spending on additional staffing, technology 
and other resources. These costs could then 
be passed on to the depositors, thereby bur-
dening tax-compliant citizens and busi-
nesses; and 
Whereas, people from both political parties 
have expressed concern about the Biden ad-
ministration’s tax increase proposal. A group 
of 141 House Republicans explained their po-
sition in a letter to their Democratic col-
leagues, and House Democrats omitted the 
bank reporting requirements in their Sep-
tember 2021 list of tax policy changes due to 
the potential harm it may cause to low-in-
come communities; and 
Whereas, the Biden administration’s tax 
increase proposal fails to consider cybersecu-
rity risks and unjust burdens on lawful indi-
viduals, and the United States Congress 
should oppose this unprecedented intrusion 
into the privacy of Americans. 
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of 
Representatives of the State of Arizona, the 
Senate concurring, prays: 
1. That the United States Congress oppose 
the burdensome reporting requirements in-
cluded in the Biden administration’s tax in-
crease proposal for fiscal year 2022. 
2. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial 
to the President of the United States, the 
President of the United States Senate, the 
Speaker of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and each Member of Congress 
from the State of Arizona. 
POM–194. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the 
United States Congress to permanently ex-
tend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 with 
commensurate spending cuts to avoid in-
creasing the federal tax burden; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 154 
Whereas, Prior to government-mandated 
economic shutdowns during the COVID–19 
Pandemic, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 
(TCJA) spurred steady economic expansion 
and allowed the spirit of entrepreneurship to 
flourish, while creating new jobs and oppor-
tunities for tens of millions of Americans. 
The act resulted in a $1.5 trillion net tax cut, 
and was followed by historically low unem-
ployment rates, an increase in business in-
vestment, and a $6,000 increase in real me-
dian household income over the next two 
years. This includes scores of raises and bo-
nuses for workers immediately after the law 
was adopted; and 
Whereas, the TCJA reduced federal tax 
rates for households across every income 
level, and this relief resulted in a tax cut of 
more than $1,500 for the average middle-in-
come earner. The act had many provisions to 
reduce the individual income taxes including 
reductions in personal income tax rates, 
nearly doubling the standard deduction, and 
substantially reducing the hated Alternative 
Minimum Tax (AMT); and 
Whereas, the TCJA set an annual cap of 
$10,000 on the state and local tax (SALT) de-
duction, broadening the tax base at the fed-
eral level and in many states. This caused 
state level budget surpluses and lead to 
many states offering substantial tax relief; 
and 
Whereas, Prior to the TCJA, the top cor-
porate income tax rate in the United States 
was thirty-five percent, the highest among 
all nations in the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD). The 
act reduced the tax rate to twenty-one per-
cent, bringing the United States back to av-
erage among OECD member nations, and 
dramatically enhancing American competi-
tiveness; and 
Whereas, Many significant provisions of 
the TCJA are set to expire after December 
31, 2025. Allowing these provisions to expire 
would result in a massive federal tax in-
crease on hardworking American taxpayers, 
a significant decline in American competi-
tiveness, fewer jobs, reduced wage income for 
workers, and higher prices. In addition, the 
expiration 
of 
these 
provisions 
would 
incentivize many states to return to a period 
of higher taxes and inflated spending; and 
Whereas, More than 100 million American 
taxpayers from all income groups, but espe-
cially those in the middle and working class-
es, have enjoyed real tax relief due to the 
TCJA. The majority of Americans support 
making these tax cuts permanent; Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the 
Congress of the United States to perma-
nently extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 
2017 with commensurate spending cuts to 
avoid increasing the federal tax burden; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent of the United States Senate, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation.

changes to tax information reporting that 
would require banking and financial institu-
tions to report to the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice on the incoming and outgoing trans-
actions from every customer’s financial ac-
count with gross inflows and outflows that 
range from $600 to $10,000 during the taxable 
year; and 
Whereas, these proposals would require fi-
nancial institutions to report, for both per-
sonal and business accounts, the account’s 
physical cash amount, transactions with for-
eign accounts and transfers to and from the 
owner and the owner’s other accounts; and 
Whereas, savings, transactional, loan and 
investment accounts in these financial insti-
tutions would be subject to these proposed 
requirements; and 
Whereas, there are serious concerns over 
data privacy and security if these new re-
quirements are put in place. Keeping mem-
ber and customer account information pri-
vate and secure is among the primary goals 
of all financial institutions in this state, and 
these new requirements, at any threshold 
dollar amount, could jeopardize the security 
of accounts and personal information; and 
Whereas, privacy is cited as one of the pri-
mary reasons individual’s choose not to open 
bank accounts, and this proposal lays a foun-
dation for new and future barriers for the 
unbanked and underbanked; and 
Whereas, financial institutions in this 
state and nation are already subject to many 
burdensome regulations. Including these new 
and extensive reporting requirements would 
deepen that burden in an untenable and de-
structive fashion for many community-based 
financial institutions. 
1. That the United States Congress act to 
protect consumers from harmful and intru-
sive Internal Revenue Service rules and fi-
nancial institutions from burdensome re-
porting requirements. 
2. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial 
to the President of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives and each Member of Con-
gress from the State of Arizona. 
POM–196. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the fed-
eral government to extend Title 42 to avoid 
a crisis at the border; to the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Af-
fairs. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 130 
Whereas, 
Former 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s administration implemented Title 
42 to prevent certain migrants without docu-
mentation from entering the United States 
during a public health emergency such as 
COVID–19. This law allowed for some vulner-
able populations, such as unaccompanied 
children, to continue seeking refuge in the 
United States; and 
Whereas, the President Joe Biden’s admin-
istration plans to end Title 42 restrictions on 
May 23, 2022. The United States Department 
of Homeland Security has reported that it 
expects an estimated 18,000 people to cross 
the southern border each day once these re-
strictions are lifted. This estimate is an 
overwhelming increase from March 2022, 
when an average of 7,000 migrants entered 
the country every day. Despite unprece-
dented migration, neither President Biden 
nor the administration has announced a con-
crete plan on how to handle a possible surge; 
and 
Whereas, Extending Title 42 will delay a 
possible border crisis until the administra-
tion can produce an immigration plan. The 
extension has bipartisan support in Con-
gress, and recent polling showed that the 
majority of Americans oppose the lifting of 
Title 42 restrictions; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the 
federal government to extend Title 42 to 
avoid a crisis at the border; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the President of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, the Director of the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
the Secretary of the United States Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, and the mem-
bers of the Michigan congressional delega-
tion.

Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the 
United States Congress to hold a state fu-

World War II Medal of Honor recipient to 
honor those who served in World War II; to 
the Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. 
SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 101 
Whereas, the Medal of Honor is the United 
States of America’s highest and most-pres-
tigious personal military decoration that 
may be awarded to recognize United States 
military service members who have distin-
guished themselves by acts of valor. The 
Medal of Honor represents the indomitable 
spirit, determination, selflessness, and gal-
lantry of those who, in the face of over-
whelming odds, performed far beyond the 
call of duty; and 
Whereas, as members of the ‘‘Greatest 
Generation,’’ which represented the char-
acter and strength of the State of Idaho and 
the United States, Captain Arthur Junior 
Jackson, United States Marine Corps, who 
served with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine 
Regiment, and Robert Dale Maxwell, United 
States Army, who served with the 7th Infan-
try Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, were 
both awarded the Medal of Honor during 
World War II for gallantry, risking their 
lives, and acting with valor. Both Captain 
Arthur Junior Jackson and Robert Dale 
Maxwell, along with Idaho’s other Medal of 
Honor recipients, are now deceased, leaving 
only memories of their heroic acts. The sto-
ries of these patriots’ courage and valor dur-
ing the war should never be forgotten; and 
Whereas, the President of the United 
States holds the authority to designate a 
state funeral. A number of state funerals to 
honor our war heroes have been held in the 
past, including the 1921 state funeral for the 
Unknown Soldier of World War I and the 1964 
state funeral honoring General Douglas Mac-
Arthur. These state funerals have offered our 
nation the opportunity to pause, reflect, and 
honor the service of those individuals and 
those who served alongside them; and 
Whereas, the last surviving Medal of Honor 
recipients from World War II are 96-year-old 
Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams, a retired United 
States Marine Corps warrant officer and 
United States Department of Veterans Af-
fairs veterans service representative, and 99- 
year-old Charles H. Coolidge, who served as a 
United States Army technical sergeant; Now 
therefore be it 
Resolved, by the members of the First Reg-
ular Session of the Sixty-sixth Idaho Legis-
lature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring therein, that a state 
funeral be held at such time of the passing of 
the last World War II Medal of Honor recipi-
ent, to honor the last surviving Medal of 
Honor recipient from World War II, and to 
honor those who served in World War II, such 
distinction giving our nation the oppor-
tunity to thank those who saved the world 
from Nazism, fascism, and militaristic impe-
rialism. This national recognition would also 
serve to honor the 473 service members who 
were awarded the Medal of Honor for service 
during World War II, along with the 16 mil-
lion American men and women who faith-
fully served our nation, including many Ida-
hoans, during that war, paying a final salute 
to the millions of men and women of the 
‘‘Greatest Generation’’ who served our coun-
try from 1941 to 1945; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate 
be, and she is hereby authorized and directed 
to forward a copy of this Memorial to the 
President of the United States, to the Presi-
dent of the Senate and the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives of Congress, and to 
the congressional delegation representing 
the State of Idaho in the Congress of the 
United States. 
POM–198. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona 
supporting the enactment of the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act and the 
Ensuring Accurate and Complete Abortion 
Data Reporting Act of 2019; to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 1009 
Whereas, Congress and the State of Ari-
zona have compelling interests in protecting 
all human life; and 
Whereas, Congress passed by unanimous 
consent the Born-Alive Infants Protection 
Act ‘‘to repudiate the flawed notion that a 
child’s entitlement to the protections of the 
law is dependent upon whether that child’s 
mother or others want him or her’’ and ‘‘to 
repudiate the flawed notion that the right to 
an abortion means the right to a dead baby, 
regardless of where the killing takes place’’; 
and 
Whereas, to achieve these important objec-
tives, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act 
affirmatively recognizes that all infants 
born at any stage of development, regardless 
of 
the 
circumstances 
surrounding 
their 
births, are ‘‘persons’’ for purposes of federal 
law; and 
Whereas, the Born-Alive Infants Protec-
tion Act became law in August 2002; and 
Whereas, the legal recognition provided by 
the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act has 
proved to be inadequate for providing nec-
essary legal protections for Infants born 
alive following attempted abortions and en-
suring that they receive medically appro-
priate care and treatment; and 
Whereas, to remedy this deficiency, Con-
gress introduced the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act, which would af-
firmatively require that medically appro-
priate care be given to any infant born alive 
following an abortion procedure; and 
Whereas, the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act supplements existing 
federal law to require that health care pro-
viders ‘‘exercise the same degree of profes-
sional skill, care and diligence to preserve 
the life and health of a child’’ born alive fol-
lowing an attempted abortion as the pro-
vider ‘‘would render to any other child born 
alive’’; and 
Whereas, a February 2017 poll by the Susan 
B. Anthony List found that 77% of Ameri-
cans support legislation ‘‘that would ensure 
that a baby who survives a failed abortion 
would be given the same medical treatment 
as any other baby born prematurely at the 
same age’’; and 
Whereas, the citizens of this state strongly 
support laws providing legal recognition and 
protection for born-alive infants, including 
those who survive attempted abortions, as 
evidenced by Arizona’s enactment of section 
36–2301, Arizona Revised Statutes, which re-
quires a physician performing an abortion 
and any other physician in attendance to use 
‘‘all available means and medical skills’’ to 
‘‘promote, preserve and maintain the life’’ of 
a fetus or embryo who is delivered alive; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4478 
September 7, 2022 
Whereas, the problem of born-alive infants 
being denied medically appropriate care fol-
lowing attempted abortions is a matter of of-
ficial public record but still underreported; 
and 
Whereas, to remedy the problem of under 
reporting of cases of infants born alive fol-
lowing attempted abortions, Congress intro-
duced the Ensuring Accurate and Complete 
Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2019, which 
would make certain Medicaid family plan-
ning monies conditional on a state gathering 
and reporting to the United States Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention com-
prehensive abortion data, and affirmatively 
requires that states report instances of un-
born children surviving abortion attempts; 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved, By the Senate of the State of Ari-
zona, the House of Representatives concur-
ring: 
1. That the Legislature strongly supports 
the enactment of the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act. 
2. That the Legislature strongly supports 
the enactment of the Ensuring Accurate and 
Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 
2019. 
3. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Resolution 
to the Governor of the State of Arizona, the 
President of the United States, the President 
of the United States Senate, the Speaker of 
the United States House of Representatives 
and each Member of Congress from the State 
of Arizona. 
POM–99. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the 
President of the United States and the 
United States Congress to facilitate the re-
settlement of Ukrainian refugees; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 113 
Whereas, On February 24, 2022, the Russian 
military launched a full-scale military as-
sault on Ukraine. As troops invaded the 
country, Russia launched other military at-
tacks, including bombing major Ukrainian 
cities; and 
Whereas, As the Ukrainian military has 
valiantly defended their homeland, the fight-
ing has created a humanitarian crisis among 
the country’s civilians. Less than a week 
into the conflict, hundreds of thousands of 
Ukrainian refuges have fled to other coun-
tries. It has been estimated that this figure 
may climb to several million; and 
Whereas, These Ukrainian refugees have 
numerous needs that must be met. Fleeing 
their homes, they need access to housing, 
education, healthcare, and other basic needs. 
Taking in and supporting the refugees is 
paramount to limiting the damage done by 
Russia’s violence; and 
Whereas, As a world leader in standing up 
against oppression, the United States has an 
obligation to commit itself to supporting 
Ukrainian refugees, including facilitating 
their resettlement. As Ukraine’s neighbors 
may be overwhelmed by the scale of the cri-
sis, the federal government should take ac-
tion to ensure the refugees are able to be re-
settle in the United States; and 
Whereas, Michigan must also do its part in 
addressing this global crisis. Our state must 
stand ready to do its part in supporting refu-
gees fleeing wars of aggression; Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge Presi-
dent Joe Biden and the Congress of the 
United States to facilitate the resettlement 
of Ukrainian refugees; and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge Governor Gretchen 
Whitmer to assist in resettling some Ukrain-
ian refugees in Michigan; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, the President of 
the United States Senate, the members of 
the Michigan congressional delegation, and 
the Governor. 
POM–200. A resolution adopted by the Leg-
islature of the State of Nebraska applying to 
the United States Congress, pursuant to Ar-

Constitution that impose fiscal restraints on 
the federal government, limit the power and 
jurisdiction of the federal government, and 
limit the terms of office for its officials and 
for members of Congress; to the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION NO. 14 
Now, Therefore, be it Resolved by the Mem-
bers of the One Hundred Seventh Legislature of 
Nebraska, Second Session: 
1. The Legislature of the State of Nebraska 
hereby applies to Congress, under the provi-
sions of Article V of the Constitution of the 
United States, for the calling of a convention 
of the states limited to proposing amend-
ments to the constitution of the United 
States that impose fiscal restraints on the 
federal government, limit the power and ju-
risdiction of the federal government, and 
limit the terms of office for its officials and 
for members of Congress. 
2. The Clerk of the Legislature shall trans-
mit copies of this application to the Presi-
dent and Secretary of the United States Sen-
ate, to the Speaker and Clerk of the United 
States House of Representatives, to the 
members of the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives from this state, and to the pre-
siding officers of each of the legislative 
houses in the several states, requesting their 
cooperation. 
3. This application constitutes a con-
tinuing application in accordance with Arti-
cle V of the Constitution of the United 
States until the legislatures of at least two- 
thirds of the several states have made appli-
cations on the same subject. 
4. This application will be rescinded as of 
February 1, 2027.

United 
States 
and 
Taiwan 
to 
further 
strengthen bilateral trade between our coun-

trade partnership; to the Committee on For-
eign Relations. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 115 
Whereas, Michigan and Taiwan have en-
joyed strong bilateral trade, educational and 
cultural exchanges, and tourism; and 
Whereas, Taiwan shares the same values of 
freedom, democracy, human rights, the rule 
of law, peace, and prosperity with the United 
States and the State of Michigan; and 
Whereas, The United States ranks as Tai-
wan’s second-largest trading partners and 
Taiwan is the eighth-largest trading partner 
of the United States. Bilaterial trade be-
tween the two countries exceeded $856 billion 
in 2021; and 
Whereas, Taiwan and the State of Michi-
gan have enjoyed a long and mutually bene-
ficial relationship with the prospect of fu-
ture growth. Taiwan was Michigan’s sev-
enth-largest export market in Asia in 2020, 
with $225 million worth of Michigan goods 
exported to Taiwan; and 
Whereas, To strengthen the Taiwan-Michi-
gan bilateral economic relationship, it is es-
sential that Michigan businesses enhance 
their economic engagement with Taiwan 
based on the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act 
(TRA, Public Law 96–8, 22 USC § 3301). Article 
4, Section b of the TRA stipulates that 
‘‘wherever the laws of the United States 
refer to relate to foreign countries, nations, 
states, governments, or similar entities, 
such terms shall include and such laws shall 
apply with respect to Taiwan’’; and 
Whereas, Taiwan and the United States 
should further strengthen bilateral trade be-
tween our countries, thereby increasing 
Michigan’s exports to Taiwan and creating 
bilateral investment; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we encourage 
the United States and Taiwan to further 
strengthen bilateral trade between our coun-
tries and continue our strong economic and 
trade partnership; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Presdient of the United 
States, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, the President of 
the United States Senate, and the members 
of the Michigan congressional delegation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4481 
September 7, 2022 
S. 4792. A bill to amend the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 to establish fair 
and consistent eligibility requirements 
for graduate medical schools operating 
outside the United States and Canada; 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4792 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Foreign 
Medical School Accountability Fairness Act 
of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
To establish consistent eligibility require-
ments for graduate medical schools oper-
ating outside of the United States and Can-
ada in order to increase accountability and 
protect American students and taxpayer dol-
lars. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Three for-profit schools in the Carib-
bean have historically received nearly 3⁄4 of 
all Federal funding under title IV of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 
et seq.) that goes to students enrolled at for-
eign graduate medical schools, despite those 
three schools being exempt from meeting the 
same eligibility requirements as the major-
ity of graduate medical schools located out-
side of the United States and Canada. 
(2) The National Committee on Foreign 
Medical Education and Accreditation and 
the Department of Education recommend 
that all foreign graduate medical schools 
should be required to meet the same eligi-
bility requirements to participate in Federal 
funding under title IV of the Higher Edu-
cation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.). 
(3) The attrition rate at United States 
medical schools averaged 3.3 percent between 
1993 and 2013, while rates at for-profit Carib-
bean medical schools have been known to 
reach 30 percent. 
(4) In 2022, residency match rates for for-
eign trained graduates averaged 61.4 percent 
compared to 92.9 percent for graduates of 
allopathic medical schools in the United 
States and 91.3 percent for graduates of os-
teopathic medical schools in the United 
States. 
(5) On average, students at for-profit med-
ical schools operating outside of the United 
States and Canada amass more student debt 
than those at medical schools in the United 
States. 
SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. 
Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002(a)(2)) is amended— 
(1) in subparagraph (A), by striking clause 
(i) and inserting the following: 
‘‘(i) in the case of a graduate medical 
school located outside the United States— 
‘‘(I) at least 60 percent of those enrolled in, 
and at least 60 percent of the graduates of, 
the graduate medical school outside the 
United States were not persons described in 
section 484(a)(5) in the year preceding the 
year for which a student is seeking a loan 
under part D of title IV; and 
‘‘(II) at least 75 percent of the individuals 
who were students or graduates of the grad-
uate medical school outside the United 
States or Canada (both nationals of the 
United States and others) taking the exami-
nations administered by the Educational 
Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates 
received a passing score in the year pre-
ceding the year for which a student is seek-
ing a loan under part D of title IV;’’; and 
(2) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(V) EXPIRATION
OF
AUTHORITY.—The au-
thority of a graduate medical school de-
scribed in subclause (I) to qualify for partici-
pation in the loan programs under part D of 
title IV pursuant to this clause shall expire 
beginning on the first July 1 following the 
date of enactment of the Foreign Medical 
School Accountability Fairness Act of 2022.’’. 
SEC. 5. LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY. 
If a graduate medical school loses eligi-
bility to participate in the loan programs 
under part D of title IV of the Higher Edu-
cation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) due 
to the enactment of the amendments made 
by section 4, then a student enrolled at such 
graduate medical school on or before the 
date of enactment of this Act may, notwith-
standing such loss of eligibility, continue to 
be eligible to receive a loan under such part 
D while attending such graduate medical 
school in which the student was enrolled 
upon the date of enactment of this Act, sub-
ject to the student continuing to meet all 
applicable requirements for satisfactory aca-
demic progress, until the earliest of— 
(1) withdrawal by the student from the 
graduate medical school; 
(2) completion of the program of study by 
the student at the graduate medical school; 
or 
(3) the fourth June 30 after such loss of eli-
gibility.

TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP MODEL 
FOR PROCUREMENT OF NONTAC-

(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing:

ment of Defense to procure cost-effective 
zero-emission vehicles by considering the 
total cost of ownership (referred to in this 
section as ‘‘TCO’’) of such vehicles.

count for operating costs of vehicles, includ-
ing fuel, maintenance, and public health sav-
ings.

Department of Defense in the procurement of 
nontactical vehicles would maximize cost 
savings and bolster energy and national se-
curity. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) the Department of Defense should cal-
culate and consider the TCO when procuring 
a nontactical vehicle; and

ducting any action with the Government 
Services Administration relating to the pro-
curement or requisition of a nontactical ve-
hicle, should— 
(A) work with the Department of Energy to 
develop a TCO procurement model that uses 
State-wide, regional, and inventory variables 
to estimate the cost of converting the non-
tactical vehicle fleet of the Department of 
Defense to zero-emission vehicles; 
(B) submit to Congress a report summa-
rizing such procurement or requisition that, 
at a minimum, identifies— 
(i) types of vehicles by— 
(I) size; and 
(II) fuel source; and 
(ii) the total estimated cost savings and 
avoided emissions that result or would have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4489 
September 7, 2022 
in Washington, DC, about Assistant 
Special 
Agent 
in 
Charge 
Tim 
Thibault’s retirement. 
Since May 31 of this year, I have 
highlighted Tim Thibault’s partisan 
bias and how it infected major FBI in-
vestigations. That included a July 18 
letter of this year that highlighted his 
role in opening a criminal investiga-
tion into Trump’s campaign and advis-
ers. That investigation is the electoral 
investigation that has been in the 
news. 
For example, on July 26 of this year, 
the Washington Post reported on that 
very same Trump investigation. Now, 
however, the Post failed to note that 
Thibault was the prime mover in open-
ing it. 
Now get this: The Post failed to note 
that Tim Thibault predicated the in-
vestigation, in a substantial part, on 
liberal news articles, as well as infor-
mation derived from a liberal non-
profit. Attorney General Garland and 
Director Wray approved a full inves-
tigation anyway, which, as we all 
know, was contrary to standard proce-
dure for moving ahead on an investiga-
tion. 
That Washington Post article oc-
curred 1 day after I made the Trump 
investigation letter public and 1 day 
after I made the July 25 Hunter Biden 
investigation letter public. 
Since Tim Thibault’s exit from the 
FBI, I have noticed more news articles 
and reporting that haven’t been accu-
rate with respect to the allegations 
that I have made public. Let me take 
this opportunity, then, to correct the 
record with respect to that inaccurate 
reporting. 
Some reports have noted that the 
Hunter Biden criminal probe is ongo-
ing; therefore, how can the allegations 
of Thibault shutting down investiga-
tion activity relating to Hunter Biden 
be credible? 
Well, this is the difference: The whis-
tleblower disclosures to me relate to 
investigative activity and avenues of 
information that originated entirely 
separate from the ongoing Hunter 
Biden criminal probe. That is why the 
allegations that I made—that I brought 
forward—are so very, very important, 
because we are dealing with a separate 
category of potentially criminal infor-
mation relating to Hunter Biden that 
the FBI has within its possession and 
the information received by the FBI 
was either verified or verifiable. Even 
so, based on allegations, the investiga-
tive activity was shut down by Special 
Agent Thibault and, of course, by oth-
ers based on the false assertion that it 
was disinformation. 
How many times do we have this 
‘‘disinformation’’ coming up as an ex-
cuse all the time with GRASSLEY’s in-
vestigations? 
Now, to be precise, FBI officials want 
to take action with respect to this sep-
arate investigative information that 
the FBI had in its possession related to 
Hunter 
Biden. 
However, 
Thibault 
blocked the FBI from doing what would 
normally be done. Accordingly, the in-
vestigative activity and the informa-
tion cannot be advanced as it should 
have been, which means the FBI could 
have gathered more evidence with re-
spect to Hunter Biden but cut bait in-
stead. And the FBI and Thibault cut 
bait right before the 2020 Presidential 
election. 
Since the information and activity 
was shut down, it wouldn’t have been 
initially 
shared 
with 
any 
ongoing 
criminal probe. That calls into ques-
tion, then, what U.S. Attorney Weiss is 
actually investigating. It also calls 
into question what the FBI’s Baltimore 
field office is reviewing and whether it 
is the full scope of evidence. 
Now, I have asked Director Wray 
about that whole issue. I asked him: 
How can verified and verifiable informa-
tion relating to the Hunter Biden’s potential 
criminality be shared with U.S. Attorney 
Weiss if it is shut down? 
We have no answer from Director 
Wray. 
At the Judiciary Committee’s August 
4 oversight hearing, Director Wray said 
that it is his expectation that such in-
formation would be shared with rel-
evant offices. 
So, Director Wray, I have this ques-
tion: What have you done to ensure 
that your expectation has been met? 
Because of Director Wray’s failure to 
answer, Congress is unaware of wheth-
er or not the FBI has finally shared full 
and complete information and inves-
tigative activity with any ongoing 
criminal probe. 
Therefore, without additional trans-
parency from the government, there is 
a very real chance the Hunter Biden 
criminal probe doesn’t include the full 
evidentiary picture. 
Now, how can the American people 
trust the results? Some have also ques-
tioned how an assistant special agent 
in charge like Thibault can have so 
much power—power to open and close 
investigative activities. 
Well, that is exactly what he did. 
And that power is often abused within 
the FBI. For example, on March 28 of 
this year, Chairman DURBIN
and I 
wrote a letter to the FBI about an 
audit. That audit showed widespread 
violations of internal policies designed 
to ensure proper handling of the FBI’s 
most sensitive investigations. 
To read from my letter with Chair-
man DURBIN: 
The FBI reviewed 353 Sensitive Investiga-
tive Matters—just under half of all such 
matters that were pending during this 18- 
month review period—and identified 747 vio-
lations. 
In 45 investigations, the FBI didn’t 
conduct or document a legal review 
prior to opening it. In 40 investiga-
tions, the FBI officials who opened a 
sensitive investigative matter didn’t 
obtain approval from the relevant spe-
cial agent in charge or even the assist-
ant special agent in charge. 
Now, with those statistics, I fear that 
is just the tip of the iceberg. 
In conclusion, let’s look at Thibault’s 
recent statement and the allegations 
he didn’t address. I think we have five 
or six. 
First, he didn’t address his role in 
opening a Trump investigation based 
on liberal news articles and informa-
tion derived from a liberal nonprofit. 
Secondly, he didn’t address his collabo-
ration with Richard Pilger with respect 
to that investigation. Third, he didn’t 
address efforts to water down the 
Trump investigation memo sent to At-
torney General Garland and Director 
Wray which they ultimately approved. 
Fourth, he didn’t address the shutting 
down of the investigative activity and 
avenues of information relating to 
Hunter Biden. Fifth, he didn’t address 
the alleged criminality within the in-
formation provided to the FBI about 
Hunter Biden. Sixth, he didn’t address 
the August 2020 assessment opened by 
Brian Auten that was used to falsely 
label Hunter Biden’s information as 
‘‘disinformation.’’ Seventh, he didn’t 
address his actions to try and improp-
erly mark investigative closings so 
that they couldn’t be opened in the fu-
ture. Lastly, Thibault said that he 
‘‘welcomes any investigation’’ into al-
legations against him. 
Well, Mr. Thibault, come on in. Sit 
for a transcribed interview with me 
and my colleagues. 
I yield the floor.
