The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, on 
Thursday, yesterday, the Rules Com-
mittee met and reported a rule, House 
Resolution 967, providing for consider-
ation of H. Res. 965, authorizing remote 
voting by proxy in the House of Rep-
resentatives and providing for official 
remote committee proceedings during 
a public health emergency due to a 
novel coronavirus resolution; and H.R. 
6800, the HEROES Act. 
Madam Speaker, the Rules Com-
mittee met for over 9 hours. While 
there are strong disagreements be-
tween Democrats and Republicans on 
these matters, I want to say that the 
proceedings were civil, and I appreciate 
that very much. 
I want to thank the ranking member, 
Mr. COLE, for the tone that he set, not 
only yesterday, but in all of our hear-
ings on issues where we have common 
ground and on issues where we dis-
agree. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H. Res. 965 under a closed rule. It pro-
vides 1 hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on Rules and provides that upon adop-
tion of the rule it shall be in order 
without intervention of any point of 
order to consider the resolution. 
The rule further provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 6800 under a closed rule, 
self-executes a manager’s amendment 
from Chairwoman LOWEY, provides 2 
hours of debate equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations, and one motion to re-
commit with or without instructions. 
The rule also provides that upon adop-
tion of the rule, it shall be in order to 
consider the bill in the House without 
intervention of any question of consid-
eration. 
Finally, the rule provides suspension 
authority through July 19, 2020, and 
same-day authority and recess instruc-
tions both through July 21, 2020. 
Madam Speaker, let me begin with a 
snapshot of what we are seeing in 
America today: a novel coronavirus 
that has infected more than 1.4 million 
people in this country and has taken 
the lives of close to 90,000 Americans 
already; more than 20 million jobs lost 
in the last month; communities asked 
to stay home; businesses closed; an un-
employment rate that stands at 14 per-
cent and growing; lines for food banks 
that stretch for miles; and first re-
sponders working to the bone to save 
lives. 
People are struggling, Madam Speak-
er. We haven’t seen numbers like this 
since the Great Depression. This situa-
tion demands a whole-of-government 
response that matches the challenges 
that we face. 
I am proud that this Congress has 
come together on multiple bills that 
provide trillions of dollars in emer-
gency aid. We knew then that although 
those bills were a large investment, 
they were just the first step in our re-
sponse. 
This rule will allow for consideration 
of the HEROES Act, a comprehensive 
response to further help the American 
people. This bill is named after the 
teachers, healthcare workers, and first 
responders who keep us all safe. It puts 
these heroes front and center by pro-
viding more than $1 trillion for States 
and localities to give them the pay 
that they have earned. 
The bill also establishes a Heroes 
Fund totaling $200 billion so that the 
essential workers who have risked 
their lives during this pandemic get 
the hazard pay that they deserve. 
There is another $75 billion for 
coronavirus testing, treatment, and 
tracing. 
There is support here for workers, 
renters, homeowners, and small busi-
nesses. 
This legislation also protects our de-
mocracy by providing resources to en-
sure safe Federal elections, an accurate 
Census count, and a Postal Service 
that can continue its vital work. 
I am especially proud to see provi-
sions here to fight the growing hunger 
crisis in America. That includes many 
of the ideas behind the bipartisan, bi-
cameral FEED Act, and a separate 15 
percent increase in the maximum ben-
efit under SNAP, our Nation’s premier 
antihunger program. More than 40 mil-
lion people relied on this program even 
before this pandemic hit. So when peo-
ple say they want to get back to nor-
mal, I want to get back to better than 
normal because having 40 million peo-
ple in this country hungry even before 
this pandemic is unconscionable. We 
need to do better. 
Today, we see lines for food banks 
across the country that go for miles 
and miles. Parking lots are so full at 
some of these places that they look 
like some kind of gathering for a major 
sporting event. Instead, it is people 
just trying to secure their next meal. 
This is happening in the richest coun-
try on the face of the Earth, a country

whose President, by the way, was try-
ing to weaken SNAP and slash its ben-
efits before COVID–19 hit. If he suc-
ceeded, that would have thrown mil-
lions and millions of poor people off 
the program. 
People are suffering, Madam Speak-
er. But just this week, Senate Majority 
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL called this 
bill a messaging exercise. I don’t give a 
damn about sending a message, Madam 
Speaker. I want to send help to those 
in desperate need. 
As we act on this bill today, we are 
also moving forward as part of this rule 
with temporary changes to ensure that 
Congress 
can 
continue 
legislating 
throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. 
That includes enabling virtual com-
mittee proceedings and remote voting 
on the House floor during this emer-
gency. 
I don’t suggest these changes lightly. 
I still believe that we do our best work 
in person and side by side. But we must 
temporarily embrace technology dur-
ing this unprecedented time, the same 
way local governments and countries 
around the world have, so we can con-
tinue legislating as safely as possible. 
b 0915 
Madam Speaker, the status quo has 
become dangerous and unacceptable. 
We must act. Let’s meet this moment. 
Let’s honor our heroes, and let’s make 
sure that we can act throughout this 
pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all my 
colleagues to support this rule and the 
underlying measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN), my good friend, for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today to 
consider a rule that provides for con-
sideration of two items. 
Today’s rule establishes a process for 
consideration of H.R. 6800, what the 
majority is calling the HEROES Act, 
but what is better described as an 1800- 
page, $3 trillion Democratic list of pol-
icy priorities. 
The rule proposes the most con-
sequential change in the rules of the 
House of Representatives during my 
time in Congress. The change to the 
House rules covers two key areas: 
First, it would impose, for the first 
time in our history as an institution, a 
system of proxy voting on the floor of 
the House of Representatives. That 
change also allows for the adoption of 
totally remote voting upon the certifi-
cation of a single Member of Congress, 
Chairman LOFGREN, of a technology for 
that use. 
Second, it would also allow commit-
tees to operate remotely and approve 
legislation remotely. 
Madam Speaker, I said quite a bit 
about these rules changes at our com-
mittee meeting yesterday, and I con-
tinue to stand by those comments. I 
believe these changes will fundamen-
tally alter the nature of the institu-
tion, and not for the better. We must 
never forget that the House is part of a 
Congress—literally, a physical meeting 
between delegates. 
When we move to acting remotely, 
we lose that fundamental aspect of our 
character. We lose the opportunity to 
meet together, discuss ideas, discuss 
legislation, and move forward together 
on bills that shape our Nation. And we 
do so in a way that does not, in my 
view, pass constitutional muster. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject these rules changes 
today and return to the drawing board 
so that we can act together in a bipar-
tisan manner to ensure that Congress 
can continue to operate during this cri-
sis. 
Not to be outdone with attempting to 
change the fundamental nature of the 
House of Representatives, in today’s 
rule, the majority is proposing an enor-
mous bill that will fundamentally 
change the nature of our country. 
H.R. 6800, which we saw for the first 
time on Tuesday afternoon, is 1800 
pages long. While we do not yet have a 
CBO score, the majority is purporting 
that the bill includes spending in ex-
cess of $3 trillion. And to make matters 
worse, the bill was assembled with only 
Democratic input. It is not a stretch to 
say that this bill is nothing more than 
Democratic 
policy 
agenda 
masquerading as a response to the 
coronavirus crisis. 
Madam Speaker, it goes without say-
ing that this bill is going nowhere, and 
it is going nowhere fast. The Senate 
will not consider this bill. The Presi-
dent will not sign it into law. 
Why we are wasting what precious 
little time that the Speaker is allowing 
us to be assembled here at the Capitol 
on partisan policy priorities of one 
party instead of working together in a 
bipartisan manner is beyond my under-
standing. 
What is even more surprising is how 
quickly the majority wants to move on 
a bill of this magnitude. Just 6 weeks 
ago, Congress passed, and the President 
signed into law, the CARES Act, a bill 
that provided over $2.3 billion for 
coronavirus relief efforts. And just 2 
weeks ago, we passed another bipar-
tisan bill that provided an additional 
$500 billion in relief. Some of the 
money from these two bills hasn’t even 
been spent yet. But now, Democrats 
are falling all over themselves to spend 
another $3 trillion on their own prior-
ities. It is simply astonishing. 
Let me be clear of one thing, Madam 
Speaker: Republicans in the House, in 
the Senate, and in the White House 
stand ready to work with Democrats to 
pass another bipartisan coronavirus re-
lief bill at the appropriate time and 
after the normal give-and-take of seri-
ous negotiation. That bill, when it 
comes, will be very different in scope 
and detail from what we are consid-
ering here today. 
Consider just a few of the provisions 
in H.R. 6800: 
$3 trillion in spending; 
Nearly $10,000 for every American; 
A controversial bailout of multiem-
ployer pension plans; 
Forgiving $10,000 of student loan debt 
per person; 
Federalizing the national election 
system; 
Changing credit scoring models and 
banning debt collection; 
Requiring nationwide vote by mail 
and same-day registration. 
I could go on and on and on, but I 
think everyone gets the picture. So 
much of what is in this bill simply has 
nothing at all to do with the current 
crisis. It is more like a liberal Christ-
mas card wish list. 
Madam Speaker, it would make more 
sense, in my view, to just send it 
straight to Santa Clause than to send 
it to the United States Senate. It 
would have a better chance of becom-
ing law that way. 
Madam Speaker, this doesn’t make 
sense. If the majority actually wants 
to help Americans, there are plenty of 
bipartisan ways to do so. We could be 
focusing our efforts on legislation to 
combat the pandemic, to get people 
back to work, and to restore the econ-
omy, but instead we have been handed 
1800 pages and over $3 trillion in Demo-
cratic priorities that they would be 
pursuing regardless of the pandemic. 
We can do better than that; and, frank-
ly, Madam Speaker, recently, we have 
done better than that. 
I remind my friends that we actually 
considered and passed, on a bipartisan 
basis, four relief bills with almost no 
partisan dissent. Those bills were nego-
tiated before they ever arrived on the 
floor of this body. We should return to 
that method and that system. It yield-
ed real results for the American people. 
What we have got today will not. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, H. 
Res. 965 was mentioned, and some ques-
tions were raised about constitutional 
issues. 
Madam Speaker, we have consulted 
with several constitutional scholars: 
Erwin Chemerinsky, the renowned con-
stitutional expert and dean of the 
Berkeley 
School 
of 
Law; 
Deborah 
Pearlstein, 
constitutional 
law 
pro-
fessor from Cardozo School of Law and 
former clerk to Supreme Court Justice 
John Paul Stevens; Sai Prakkash, a 
constitutional law professor from the 
University of Virginia and former clerk 
to the late Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia—all of whom have 
found that the House has the constitu-
tional authority to institute remote 
voting by proxy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. MATSUI), and also a 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the rule. 
The public health challenge this 
country faces is unprecedented in mod-
ern American life, and we have an obli-
gation to respond in kind.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2010 
May 15, 2020 
The administration’s response to this 
pandemic and the implementation of 
bipartisan legislation providing tril-
lions of dollars in support require 
meaningful oversight. As our public 
health experts continue to recommend 
social distancing, this rule will allow 
the House to execute its constitutional 
obligations in a way that respects their 
advice and limits the spread of COVID– 
19. 
I also am here to support the HE-
ROES Act. The additional funding in-
cluded in this bill is needed imme-
diately. 
The HEROES Act builds upon the 
progress of our previous bills by pro-
viding nearly $1 trillion for State and 
local governments to pay healthcare 
workers, police, fire, teachers, transit 
workers, and other essential personnel. 
It also increases flexibility in the 
PPP to help small businesses use 
money in a way that makes sense for 
them. I have heard from restaurants 
and 
small 
businesses 
across 
Sac-
ramento that these changes are needed, 
and I am glad that this bill responds di-
rectly to their concerns. 
And to contain the virus, the HE-
ROES 
Act 
provides 
additional 
re-
sources for testing, tracing, and isola-
tion, and ensures every American has 
access to free coronavirus treatment, 
covers the cost of COBRA premiums for 
9 months, and opens up special enroll-
ment periods for ACA exchanges and 
Medicare. 
As we come to fully appreciate the 
scale and severity of this pandemic, it 
is clear that additional support is nec-
essary to prevent more deaths and job 
losses. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
supporting this bill and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD two articles from distin-
guished constitutional scholars at the 
Congressional Institute that do raise 
questions about the constitutionality 
of the proposed rules changes. 
[From congressionalinstitute.org, May 13, 
2020] 
THE QUORUM, THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVEN-
TION, AND
THE CORONAVIRUS: SOME QUES-
TIONS 
The coronavirus pandemic has led some to 
call on Congress to continue its operations 
while Members are dispersed throughout the 
country. H. Res. 965 authorizes the Speaker 
to allow Members to vote by proxy when the 
Sergeant-at-Arms notifies her that there is a 
public 
health 
emergency 
due 
to 
the 
coronavirus. Conceivably, this means that a 
only minority of the Members will be present 
in the Chamber when conducting business. 
On the face of it, that would violate Article 
I, Section 5, of the Constitution, which re-
quires a majority of Members to do business. 
To get insulate the votes against constitu-
tional challenges, H. Res. 965 stipulates that 
proxy votes would count towards a quorum. 
This, however, would still seem to violate 
the intent of the Framers of the U.S. Con-
stitution. 
WHAT DOES THE CONSTITUTION SAY ABOUT 
QUORUMS IN CONGRESS? 
Article I, Section 5, of the U.S. Constitu-
tion sets forth a requirement that a majority 
of the Members of either House of Congress 
must be present for it to conduct business: 
Each House shall be the Judge of the Elec-
tions, Returns and Qualifications of its own 
Members, and a Majority of each shall con-
stitute a Quorum to do Business; but a 
smaller Number may adjourn from day to 
day, and may be authorized to compel the 
Attendance of absent Members, in such Man-
ner, and under such Penalties as each House 
may provide. 
WHAT DID THE DELEGATES TO THE CONSTITU-
TIONAL CONVENTION SAY ABOUT THE QUORUM? 
The current form of the quorum clause was 
the subject of debate at the Constitutional 
Convention of 1787. 
The Committee of Detail was a group of 
delegates entrusted with devising a draft 
constitution that reflected the delegates’ 
agreements. On August 6, 1787, it reported a 
draft that said ‘‘a majority of members’’ 
would ‘‘constitute a quorum to do business,’’ 
though ‘‘a smaller number may adjourn from 
day to day.’’ Unlike the Constitution that 
was ratified, the Committee of Detail did not 
include a provision allowing for the ‘‘smaller 
Number’’ to ‘‘compel the Attendance of ab-
sent Members’’ or penalize those who were 
missing. 
On August 10, the delegates debated the 
Committee of Detail’s quorum requirement. 
Two important concerns emerged. If the 
quorum were too high, it could prevent the 
majority from being able to transact busi-
ness. If it were too low—or could be manipu-
lated to be lowered—it would allow a small 
group of people to impose their will upon 
others. 
According to James Madison’s Notes of De-
bates in the Federal Convention of 1787, some 
delegates advocated granting the Legislature 
complete or partial discretion in setting a 
quorum: 
John Francis Mercer of Maryland proposed 
following the example of Great Britain, 
where Parliament could determine its own 
quorum. There, he said, ‘‘the requisite num-
ber is small & no inconveniency has been ex-
perienced.’’ 
Gouverneur Morris of New York proposed 
setting the quorum at 33 Representatives 
and 14 Senators. This would initially be a 
majority for each Chamber, though it would 
be less than a majority as Members were 
added. Congress, he thought, should have a 
relatively low quorum since it would prevent 
a small group of people from withholding a 
quorum, which would be a particular risk 
when ‘‘a particular part of the Continent 
may be in need of immediate aid.’’ 
Rufus King of Massachusetts proposed ini-
tially setting the quorum at 33 Representa-
tives and 14 Senators, but allowing Congress 
to increase the numbers as it saw fit. As the 
number of Members increased, a majority 
quorum would be ‘‘cumbersome.’’ 
Other delegates feared that a low quorum 
would allow small groups to make laws for 
the rest of the country: 
Elbridge Gerry, also of Massachusetts, pro-
posed that for the House the quorum should 
be no less than 33 and no more than 50, with 
the Legislature free to select a number with-
in these bounds. A quorum of 33 in the 
House, Gerry said, would allow as few as two 
states to make laws for the rest. 
George Mason of Virginia said the major-
ity quorum provision was a ‘‘valuable & nec-
essary part of the plan.’’ In fact, he was con-
cerned that a mere majority would allow 
people to object to the plan as a whole. He 
reasoned that with a lower quorum, states 
closer to the seat of government could make 
laws favorable to themselves in the absence 
of more distant states. ‘‘If the Legislature 
should be able to reduce the number at all, it 
might reduce it as low as it pleased & the U. 
States might be governed by a Juncto,’’ he 
said. 
The delegates considered and overwhelm-
ingly rejected King’s motion that the Con-
stitution set a minimum of 33 Representa-
tives and 14 Senators while the number to be 
increased by law. Only the Massachusetts 
and Delaware delegations favored King’s 
plan. 
James Madison and Edmund Randolph, 
both of Virginia, moved to amend the draft 
by inserting a provision allowing for each 
House to summon and penalize absent Mem-
bers. All the state delegations except for 
Pennsylvania supported this amendment. In 
fact, the Pennsylvania delegation was di-
vided on the question. Then the delegations 
unanimously approved the majority quorum 
provision, as amended, and it is this version 
that made its way into the U.S. Constitu-
tion. 
WOULD PROXY VOTES SATISFY THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR A QUORUM? 
It is clear that the delegates considered 
the possibility of quorums of consisting of a 
minority of the Members and rejected this 
option in favor of a majority quorum. That 
is beyond dispute. What is disputed is wheth-
er proxy votes counting towards a quorum 
would pass constitutional muster. Even 
though the Constitution allows each House 
to determine its rules of procedure (Article I, 
section 5), proxy votes counting towards 
quorum seem to run contrary to the intent 
of the delegates at the Constitutional Con-
vention. 
Proxy voting was certainly possible in the 
time of the Constitutional Convention. For 
instance, absentee or proxy voting was not 
unknown in the colonies. Yet, apparently, 
the suggestion was not raised at the Conven-
tion. One should be careful not to infer too 
much from silence, but one possibility is 
that the delegates did not consider that the 
Congress would ever ‘‘meet’’ by proxy. In 
fact, proxy voting would have settled some 
of the problems delegates on both sides of 
the issues raised. If proxy voting were per-
missible, then the distant states could have 
more easily defended themselves by sta-
tioning a member at the capital, armed with 
proxies of their absent colleagues. By the 
same token, those who feared that a small 
number could obstruct business by collecting 
proxy votes from others who shared their 
concerns. No one, apparently, raised proxy 
voting as a solution for issues with the 
quorum; rather, both sides seemingly oper-
ated under the assumption that a physical 
presence was necessary for participation in 
Congress. 
If proxy votes were to count towards a 
quorum, the Randolph-Madison amendment 
would be a redundancy. Since the amend-
ment allows each House to ‘‘compel the At-
tendance of absent Members,’’ it is predi-
cated on the notion that a physical presence 
is necessary for Congress to conduct its busi-
ness. If a physical presence were not nec-
essary, it would be unnecessary to ‘‘compel 
the Attendance of absent Members.’’ Nor 
would there be any reason to penalize them 
for failing to show. However, the states near-
ly unanimously voted to include this provi-
sion in the Constitution, highlighting the 
importance of a physical presence at the 
Constitutional Convention. 
The Framers’ concern over the dangers of 
small numbers of Members of Congress 
transacting business in the absence of the 
majority of their colleagues is as valid today 
as it was in 1787. It is true that the 
coronavirus pandemic presents great dif-
ficulties to Congress, and both Chambers 
have shown that they can still conduct busi-
ness without violating constitutional safe-
guards. As much as Congress needs to look to

the here-and-now, it also must look to the 
future. In the long-run, the inperson pres-
ence of Members of Congress is absolutely 
vital to the strength of the Legislature, and 
no amount of proxy votes may substitute for 
it. 
VOTING PRESENT BY PROXY IS AN 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL OXYMORON 
The Constitution leaves a great deal of lee-
way to the House and Senate for establishing 
their own rules of procedure. But one provi-
sion is absolutely clear: in both chambers, a 
quorum is required to do business. And a 
quorum is defined as a majoritiy of its mem-
bers. 
Article 1, section 5, of the U.S. Constitu-
tion states: 
a Majority of each shall constitute a 
Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Num-
ber may adjourn from day to day, and may 
be authorized to compel the Attendance of 
absent Members, in such Manner, and under 
such Penalties as each House may provide. 
If a physical presence were not necessary, 
it would be unnecessary to ‘‘compel the At-
tendance of absent Members.’’ Although 
proxy voting was possible at the time of the 
Constitutional Convention, the participants 
spent long days waiting for their colleagues 
to arrive to conduct business in person. 
Being physically present does make for an 
inefficient system, but that’s what the 
Founders intended—they did not intend to 
make it easy to reach consensus and govern. 
The constitutional provision for the quorum 
was designed to protect the public. 
Quorums are not self-enforcing. So a 
quorum is assumed unless it questioned by a 
Member. That is why the House carries on 
non-controversial business even when it is 
evident that only a few Members are on the 
Floor. To conduct business such as voting, 
however, a quorum can be demanded by any 
Member through a point of order. Once de-
manded, the House cannot conduct any busi-
ness—even a request to withdraw the call to 
quorum—until a quorum is attained. This 
protects the minority party. Once a party 
tries to take action beyond what has been 
agreed to by consensus, the other side can 
quickly shut that down by raising an objec-
tion to the lack of quorum. If a quorum can-
not be achieved, under the Constitution, the 
only business allowed is a motion to adjourn. 
This raises a question of whether the 
House can change its rules of procedures to 
allow proxy votes to count towards a 
quorum. Besides the oxymoronic notion that 
a member could vote ‘‘present by proxy,’’ the 
House’s precedents argue against it. 
Proxy voting has never been allowed or 
even considered on the House Floor. But 
proxy voting has, from time to time, been al-
lowed in Committees. Even though it has 
been banned since 1995, the House has estab-
lished precedents for how proxy voting was 
treated in prior Congresses. 
While Members who were absent could give 
their proxy to another Member on the Com-
mittee, allowing their votes to be counted, 
Deschler’s Precedents shows that the ‘‘no 
measure is to be reported from any com-
mittee unless a majority of the committee 
was actually present when the measure was 
ordered reported.’’ This echoes Cannon’s 
Precedents, a previous compilation of the 
precedents, which states: 
Recognition of voting proxies by standing 
committees is a matter to be respectively 
determined by each committee for itself, but 
proxies may not be counted to make a 
quorum. 
In other words, when allowed, Committees 
could count proxy votes, but they first had 
to have a majority of actual people attend-
ing or none of the votes would count. 
It might be possible for the House to 
change the rules to allow proxy voting, but 
only after attaining a physical quorum. The 
one thing it cannot do under the Constitu-
tion and under the House’s own precedents is 
to allow those proxies to count toward a 
physical quorum. So it might be possible 
that, consistent with the Constitution, some 
proxy voting might be allowed if there is a 
physical majority present for a vote. 
House Rules Committee Chairman McGov-
ern has stated his view that Members who 
vote by proxy must give specific instructions 
on how their votes would be recorded, and 
those instructions should be printed in the 
Congressional Record. If done this way, 
where most Members were present, and only 
a few were unable to make it to Washington, 
it would be similar to a traditional courtesy 
of ‘‘pairing votes.’’ In the not-so-distant 
past, ‘‘vote pairing’’ would occur when a 
Member who was voting opposite of the ab-
sent Member withheld their vote and an-
nounced a pair with the absent member, thus 
offsetting each other’s vote. In today’s high-
ly polarized Congress, such courtesies are 
rare, which might indicate the need for an 
updated system. 
The one thing that Congress cannot allow 
is the idea of conducting controversial busi-
ness with only a small number of Members 
present. It is understandable why the House 
Democratic leadership wants to put this rule 
in place since we are in the midst of a pan-
demic. At the same time, political leaders 
cannot simply ignore constitutional require-
ments or proper parliamentary forms to re-
solve the issues. Congress is, by definition, 
the gathering of people together to solve 
issues. This cannot—and should not—be done 
remotely. 
Observers of Congress agree that one of the 
primary causes of divisive partisan polariza-
tion is that Members no longer form rela-
tionships and friendships. Back when Mem-
bers met five days a week instead of three, 
they moved their families to Washington DC. 
Their kids went to school together, and their 
spouses 
formed 
friendships 
with 
other 
spouses. It’s human nature to be much more 
civil to someone whose spouse is friends with 
yours or whose kid is on your kid’s soccer 
team. 
Most importantly, legislators need to leg-
islate. There is a give and take created by 
amendments and debates that require direct 
human interaction. Too little of that goes on 
now—how much worse will it be if members 
are just ‘‘emailing it in?’’ Today, leaders 
from the House and Senate negotiate with 
the President, and the other 533 legislators 
vote on their agreement. That’s not legis-
lating. 
Proxy voting might be more efficient than 
waiting for everyone to physically get to 
Washington DC. But efficiency was not a 
goal of the founding fathers. They wanted 
the people’s representatives to get together 
and work out compromise and consensus. 
Isolated Members voting from remote loca-
tions will further harm civility and under-
mine Congress’ already weakening place in 
the Constitution’s balance of power. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), my 
good friend, a member of both the 
Rules Committee and the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding me 
the time. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule con-
tains a resolution that will really fun-
damentally change the proceedings of 
this House of Representatives. Once 
that passes—and it will, because this 
House is ruled by the majority—we will 
then take up a $3 trillion assistance 
bill. 
It is not the first time this week that 
the majority Democrats have trampled 
on the rights of the Republican minor-
ity. Allowing multiple Members to 
vote by proxy does not seem like rep-
resentative government. I, for one, will 
not give away the vote of the people of 
the 26th District to someone they did 
not elect. Governing is difficult, but we 
sought the jobs and we need to get 
back to work. 
Far too many American lives have 
been lost to the pandemic. This novel 
coronavirus continues to wreak havoc 
on our healthcare, as well as our econ-
omy. There are plenty of things we 
could have done in the House on the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce 
during the last several months which 
were undone. 
We passed a bill called the Pandemic 
All-Hazards Preparedness Act. This 
was a good bill, and it was signed into 
law in June of 2019, 6 months before the 
pandemic started. 
We could have had a realtime over-
sight of this bill that we had just 
passed in the month of February ask 
the questions: Is it doing what we 
thought? Are we achieving what we at-
tempted to achieve with that bill? 
Here is a realtime test, a stress test, 
but we chose not to do it. We had hear-
ings on flavored tobacco and horse rac-
ing instead. 
In an effort to show what we should 
be working on, I wrote a series of hear-
ing request letters this week to the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce 
Health Subcommittee chair, including 
work on the Strategic National Stock-
pile, mental health, racial disparities, 
provider relief, and testing. We should 
be working through authorizing com-
mittees to improve our Nation’s public 
health response to this pandemic. 
State testing capacity has gotten 
substantially better, but we must re-
flect on what went wrong so we make 
sure that it does not happen again in 
the future. 
I, frankly, do not understand what 
happened at the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention in the month 
of February of this year. We have never 
really asked the question at the com-
mittee level. We should have. 
If we don’t understand what went 
wrong, how do we prevent it from hap-
pening again if the virus makes a re-
surgence, if some other virus makes an 
appearance? 
Congress, recognizing the importance 
of widespread diagnostic testing, did 
take action to encourage the develop-
ment of testing strategies, and billions 
of dollars have been directed towards 
testing in our four previous response 
bills. But now we are poised to push $3 
trillion of taxpayer money out the 
door, and we should evaluate, we 
should have the evaluation of what is 
the current state of our response and 
our recovery, including our testing 
strategy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2012 
May 15, 2020 
Madam Speaker, we have to get this 
right for the American people. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me just say, it is absolutely ridiculous 
for anybody to suggest that, under the 
process that we are advocating, some-
how you are ‘‘giving away’’ your vote. 
There is no discretion at all involved in 
the process that we are putting for-
ward. My colleague sat through hours 
of hearings yesterday. I would maybe 
suggest that he reread the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I also include in the 
RECORD
a letter from law professor 
Debra Pearlstein in response to Mr. 
Mark Strand’s article, which my rank-
ing member just submitted for the 
RECORD. 
CARDOZOLAW, 
May 15, 2020. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN: I read with in-
terest an article by Mssrs. Mark Strand and 
Tim Lang introduced into the record during 
yesterday’s hearing of the House Rules Com-
mittee on H. Res. 965—Authorizing remote 
voting by proxy in the House of Representa-
tives. Having written elsewhere in detail 
about my conviction that the rules change 
under consideration readily passes constitu-
tional muster, I am grateful for the oppor-
tunity to explain why the Strand and Lang 
position fails to persuade. 
Mssrs. Strand and Lang offer no objection 
to the proxy voting process as such, but 
rather argue that the Constitution would 
permit votes by designated proxy only if a 
quorum of Members is already physically 
present in the House chamber as provided for 
under existing House rules. Their objection 
is to the rule change proposed as part of H. 
Res. 965 that would allow Members voting by 
proxy to count toward the establishment of 
a quorum ‘‘to do business’’ required by Arti-
cle I, Section 5 of the Constitution. The au-
thors cite no case law to support their view 
that the Constitution’s Quorum Clause re-
quires Members’ physical presence, relying 
instead on two lines of argument: (1) the 
bare text of the Quorum Clause, and (2) the 
interpretive claim that, because other provi-
sions of the Constitution refer to Members’ 
‘‘presence’’ or ‘‘absence,’’ it must be that the 
Quorum Clause itself must be read to man-
date physical presence. Neither argument is 
persuasive. 
In defining the scope of the quorum re-
quirement, the Quorum Clause itself says 
solely: ‘‘a Majority of each shall constitute a 
Quorum to do Business.’’ The Clause does not 
provide any method or test for determining 
the existence of a majority. Neither does it 
define what measure each House must use to 
establish the existence of a majority. The 
Clause itself thus provides no basis for deter-
mining whether the ‘‘majority’’ must be, for 
example, ‘‘a majority of Members present,’’ 
or ‘‘a majority of Members elected,’’ or ‘‘a 
majority of Members able to vote,’’ or some 
other metric altogether. 
The authors must instead rely heavily on 
their interpretive claim that, because other 
provisions of the Constitution refer to Mem-
bers’ ‘‘presence’’ or ‘‘absence,’’ the Quorum 
Clause itself must be read to include an im-
plied requirement of physical presence, as if 
the Clause had been written to mandate ‘‘a 
Majority of members present shall con-
stitute a Quorum.’’ That is, of course, not 
what the Constitution says. On the contrary, 
the absence of the word ‘‘presence’’ in the 
Quorum Clause cuts as much against the au-
thors’ argument as in its favor. The framers 
of the Constitution knew exactly how to re-
quire ‘‘presence’’ when they wanted to; they 
do so, for example, just a few lines earlier in 
the text, in Article I, Section 3, providing: 
‘‘The Senate shall have the sole power to try 
all impeachments . . . . [N]o person shall be 
convicted without the concurrence of two 
thirds of the members present.’’ The failure 
to include such a requirement in in the 
Quorum Clause, or indeed to modify or define 
the Quorum Clause majority requirement in 
any way, suggests the framers did not intend 
to include presence as such as part of the 
quorum determination. 
Particularly when coupled with the Clause 
immediately following the Quorum Clause— 
according each House broad discretion to 
‘‘determine the rules of its proceedings’’—it 
makes no sense to imagine the framers 
meant here to tie the hands of future con-
gresses 
from 
using 
what 
reasonable, 
verifiable means might be available to adjust 
its procedures to accommodate a crisis. On 
the contrary, as both judicial opinion and 
the historical record referenced in my earlier 
letter make clear, the House’s discretion to 
adopt rules reasonably adapted to suit 
changing circumstances is precisely as broad 
as the Constitution’s text suggests. 
As ever, I thank you for your efforts, and 
for the opportunity to share my views. 
Sincerely, 
DEBORAH N. PEARLSTEIN, 
Professor of Law. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
will go into this later in much more de-
tail when we take up the resolution, 
but I would urge my colleagues to read 
the response. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
SHALALA). 
b 0930 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the rule and 
the underlying bills. 
Madam Speaker, my office in Miami 
is not getting calls; we are getting 
cries for help. My neighbors are scared 
of both a virus that could kill them or 
their loved ones and worried about how 
they will make their next rent or mort-
gage payment or buy groceries or when 
their children will go back to school. 
Today we vote on two bills. The first 
will allow Members of Congress to do 
our jobs, as described by our chair, Mr. 
MCGOVERN. The second will provide 
desperately needed relief. 
We have already passed four pieces of 
legislation to respond to the pandemic 
which has killed more than 83,000 
Americans. My friends and neighbors 
in south Florida are suffering. The HE-
ROES Act gives money to my State, 
cities, and county that are shouldering 
both the economic and health burdens 
of COVID–19. 
Unless we do this, my county and cit-
ies and school board will not be able to 
pay teachers or firefighters or police 
officers or transit workers or even hire 
contact tracers to help get this virus 
under control. This bill provides that 
and includes more money for SNAP 
and additional economic impact pay-
ments of up to $6,000 per family. 
The HEROES Act also provides need-
ed funds for the Postal Service. The 
Postal Service was founded in 1792. It is 
more critical than ever in helping peo-
ple safely access medications and food 
and cleaning supplies and vote-by-mail 
ballots and more. 
While the Senate may be here in D.C. 
whistling past the graveyard as they 
confirm judicial nominees, we are 
working to get the American people 
the help they desperately need. I urge 
all of my colleagues to support these 
bills. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO), my good friend and 
member of both the Rules Committee 
and the Judiciary Committee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, both 
bills under this rule are absolutely ter-
rible and should be rejected. 
First of all, you have the proxy vot-
ing and remote voting. This has never 
been done in the history of the United 
States—not during the Civil War, not 
during previous pandemics, and we 
shouldn’t do it now. When you have 
nurses going to work, when you have 
grocery store workers going to work, 
when you have everybody else going 
back to work, we are setting a terrible 
example by saying: ‘‘You don’t have to 
show up to work. Just give your voting 
card over to somebody else.’’ It is ter-
rible. 
And then when I offered an amend-
ment in the Rules Committee yester-
day saying, ‘‘Okay, if you don’t show 
up to work, you don’t get the travel al-
lowance in your MRA,’’ that was re-
jected by every single Democrat Mem-
ber on the Rules Committee. 
And then Speaker PELOSI’s bill, I call 
it the Keep People Unemployed Act, 
because that is what it is. It will 
incentivize people to stay unemployed. 
It extends the $600-per-week unemploy-
ment payment through January 31 of 
next year. It mandates all businesses 
continue the Family Medical Paid 
Leave Act for another year, and it says 
that when you apply for SNAP, food 
stamps, that the $600 per week that you 
are getting doesn’t count towards in-
come. So now you are going to have 
people that are sitting at home getting 
paid more than they did when they 
worked and getting food stamps. 
I already have businesses in my dis-
trict that say we need to hire back 
these people because Arizona is back 
open. They can’t hire the people be-
cause the people are getting paid more 
to sit at home. 
In addition, it gives $1,200 to people 
that are here illegally. Why are we not 
prioritizing U.S. citizens? It lets crimi-
nals who are convicted of murder and 
rape, just because they are 50 years old 
or older, out of prison. And it federal-
izes elections, mandating that there is 
same-day voter registration and that 
everyone is mailed a ballot. 
This is a ridiculous bill in this com-
bined rule, and I ask my Members to 
vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
there is a lot that I could say, but let 
me just say this: In the time of this in-
credible tragic health pandemic and 
economic crisis, I don’t think now is 
the time to kick poor people, to beat 
up on people who are hungry in this 
country.

We ought to step forward, as the 
United States of America, the richest 
country in the history of the world, 
and make sure that nobody in our 
country goes hungry. It is shameful the 
way my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle demagogue this issue. It is 
shameful. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the underlying rule and 
the HEROES Act to provide stimulus 
checks to all taxpayers. 
In April, I introduced H.R. 6438, the 
Leave No Taxpayer Behind Act, so that 
hardworking, taxpaying immigrants, 
immigrants who work in our fields to 
feed us on an everyday basis, also re-
ceive stimulus checks. 
Thank you for including this meas-
ure in the HEROES Act, and I urge pas-
sage of the HEROES Act. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), my good friend 
and the distinguished ranking member 
of the House Administration Com-
mittee. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak 
in opposition to the underlying legisla-
tion, H. Res. 965. 
The process that led to this debate is 
unacceptable. After a previous failed 
attempt to bring a similar rules-change 
package to the floor last month, I was 
hopeful that the work of the bipartisan 
task force to reopen the House would 
result in a genuine willingness toward 
bipartisan solutions. I was optimistic 
that our Democratic majority would 
partner with us to help this body adapt 
to the coronavirus pandemic. 
We Republicans on that task force of-
fered a realistic framework to make re-
sponsible, measured, and thorough re-
forms to get the whole House working 
again. That plan was dismissed out of 
hand by the Democratic majority, with 
no alternative. 
It was not until Wednesday morning, 
just two days ago, with the release of 
H. Res. 965, that we saw any semblance 
of a plan, and in no way was it a prod-
uct of bipartisanship or greater Mem-
ber input. 
The majority’s unwillingness to work 
in a collaborative way was reinforced 
yesterday at the Rules Committee 
hearing when not one commonsense 
amendment offered by the minority 
was accepted. 
Commonsense amendments like: Re-
quiring the technology used by the 
House to be certified by the CAO; re-
jected. 
Requiring technical support during 
virtual committee activity; rejected. 
Allowing the entire House of Rep-
resentatives to weigh in on the type of 
remote voting this body follows; re-
jected. 
Not only is this resolution com-
pletely partisan, it is being rushed to 
the floor while there is still an unac-
ceptable amount of unanswered ques-
tions, both on the specifics of the proc-
esses authorized in the rules changes 
and the technology to support it. 
I know that this morning, at 6 a.m., 
we were provided a copy of the regula-
tions that the Rules Committee plans 
on issuing. Is that the same type of 
consultation that we can expect for the 
remote hearing changes that are left to 
one Member of the majority to decide? 
The House is on the receiving end of 
1.6 billion unauthorized scans on our 
network per month. After broadcasting 
to the world that Members are going to 
now be able to cast their vote or oper-
ate in this institution remotely, I don’t 
know about you, Madam Speaker, but I 
expect those to increase. 
What further reduces my confidence 
in these sweeping changes that will not 
have their stated effect is the feedback 
from virtual committee roundtables 
that have already been attempted by 
every committee. There have been in-
stances of the majority staff kicking 
participants off video conferences be-
cause they had not RSVP’d. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a list of the concerns that our 
ranking members have provided me on 
the House Administration Committee. 
[From Committee on House Administration 
Ranking Member Rodney Davis] 
REPUBLICAN RANKING MEMBERS EXPRESS SIG-
NIFICANT CONCERNS WITH DEMOCRATS PRO-
POSAL TO ALLOW FOR VIRTUAL COMMITTEE 
PROCEEDINGS 
VIRTUAL COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS INHIBIT THE 
ABILITY OF MEMBERS TO FULLY PARTICIPATE 
Remote platforms give the majority, typi-
cally in the hands of a junior technical staff-
er not even co-located with the Chairman, 
the ability to control who can speak or even 
be heard by other participants. 
Other potential inhibitors could include a 
member’s lack of familiarity with the plat-
form, lack of training, inadequate resources 
(i.e., 
hardware, 
software, 
reception 
and 
connectivity especially in rural areas), and 
user errors like inadvertently pressing the 
mute button. 
Virtual proceedings create an inability of 
Members to be able to effectively interact 
and have conversations in person with each 
other and with staff. Members won’t have 
the same opportunity to interact with each 
other in real-time that they do with in per-
son hearings. This puts the minority at a dis-
tinct disadvantage because the majority con-
trols the content and the schedule. Minority 
strategy is always a last-minute engagement 
and often is still forming as the hearing be-
gins. 
Remote proceedings depend on the reli-
ability various technology elements. If any-
one fails, members can’t fully participate. 
Pre and post hearing engagement with wit-
nesses, other members, staff, and press will 
be lost. A lot of work is done immediately 
before or after hearings in terms of con-
necting with people. All of that time, con-
nection, relationship building will be gone. 
Every Ranking Member who responded to a 
recent survey expressed some level of con-
cern over their members ability to fully par-
ticipate. 
VIRTUAL COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS RAISE MANY 
PARLIAMENTARY ISSUES 
Many 
rules 
aren’t 
self-executing, 
and 
members may have limited time to raise ob-
jections. Once the time has passed, the op-
portunity is lost. 
For example, a point of order regarding the 
germaneness of an amendment must be made 
when the amendment is offered. After read-
ing the amendment is dispensed with, the op-
portunity to object is lost. 
The Majority already has demonstrated a 
great capacity to ignore points of order, par-
liamentary inquiries, and privileged mo-
tions. Since they will be controlling the 
technology, how will Minority members ever 
get a chance to even raise these procedural 
points? 
It is unclear if current technologies have 
the capability to have a clearly visible timer 
which will create challenges enforcing time 
limits in a clear and transparent way. 
Issues will arise without parliamentarians 
and counsels in the room to advise on 
amendments, motions, objections, and points 
of order. 
VIRTUAL
COMMITTEE
PROCEEDINGS
INCREASE 
THE RISK OF THE POLITICIZATION OF OFFICIAL 
COMMITTEE BUSINESS 
Traditionally, there is a clear separation 
between 
official 
business 
and campaign 
work. This is particularly the case imme-
diately before the general election, when the 
House generally takes about a month off to 
go campaign. This creates an important 
break between official hearings and legisla-
tive activity. With remote proceedings, 
there’s less reasons the majority couldn’t re-
spond to some less than positive polling re-
sults by marking up newly introduced legis-
lation that could make an impact in key dis-
tricts leading up to an election. 
VIRTUAL COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS JEOPARDIZE 
THE INTEGRITY OF PROCEEDINGS AND RAISE 
MAJOR CYBERSECURITY CONCERNS 
Requiring Members to be present to vote 
ensure Members are fully and transparently 
voting on their own volition. There is no 
question of technological/cybersecurity prob-
lems interfering with Members votes and 
there is no question as to whether the vote 
was cast by the Member or by a third party. 
Remote proceedings do not guarantee the 
same level of transparency and account-
ability. 
EXPERIENCES OF COMMITTEES WITH UNOFFICIAL 
VIRTUAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS SO FAR LEND 
CREDENCE TO THESE CONCERNS. 
Over 80 percent of Committees who re-
sponded to a survey responded that their 
committee had held unofficial committee 
meetings virtually over the past couple of 
months. Those meetings experienced numer-
ous issues including: 
People 
getting 
dropped 
or 
unable 
to 
unmute themselves in a timely manner. 
Majority staff kicking people off if their 
numbers were not RSVP’d. This could be a 
concern in the future if Members or staff call 
in from an unrecognizable or un-RSVP’d 
phone number. 
Members personal information almost re-
leased publicly due to platforms displaying 
the phone numbers of people on the call. 
A Member who couldn’t participate be-
cause of inadequate internet connection. 
Unauthorized individuals accessing a meet-
ing. 
One committee attempted to hold a round-
table and experienced such significant tech-
nical glitches that called into question 
whether the bipartisan roundtable could 
even occur. It took some participants up to 
30 minutes to join the Cisco Webex video 
chat while others could join with only with 
audio or never participate at all. Once con-
nected, many participants could not tell who 
was speaking or even controlling the video 
or microphone settings. A third-party mod-
erator was unaware until the end of the call 
that typed questions were being submitted 
by users throughout the conference for 
speakers to answer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2014 
May 15, 2020 
For another committee, the technical 
issues have been so bad that Member partici-
pation in recent calls has steadily declined 
with less than 30 percent of the Committee’s 
members participating in the most recent 
virtual meeting. 
SAFEGUARDS MUST BE ADOPTED TO ENSURE MI-
NORITY RIGHTS AND SECURITY OF ANY OFFI-
CIAL
COMMITTEE
PROCEEDING
HELD
VIR-
TUALLY 
There needs to be a backup method of com-
munication, independent of the primary 
platform, so that members can contact the 
Chair directly in the event the platform 
fails. 
There must be clear rules and conditions 
developed in a bi-partisan way on control of 
audio/visual with respect to rights of minor-
ity. An independent IT operator should be 
mandatory for any remote proceedings. 
Video feeds should be equally accessible by 
both parties to ensure that no one can censor 
or edit official proceedings after the fact. 
Members should not be forced to partici-
pate in committee activity over a tech-
nology platform when they are capable and 
willing to attend in person. Committees 
should always allow Members to participate 
by simply showing up to a hearing room in 
one of the House Office buildings. 
All other House Rules should remain in ef-
fect. If committees are unable to guarantee 
procedural safeguards in the rules, they 
should not be permitted to use technology to 
deny Members procedural protections. 
Technology should permit staff work. Com-
mittee staff engage in a lot of real-time 
work during hearings and markups. The 
technology should facilitate some ability for 
committee staff to continue to assist Mem-
bers in ‘‘real-time.’’ 
There needs to be additional information 
on the security of the platform to be used 
and assurances that each Member has the 
connectivity needed to support the meetings. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, Members’ personal in-
formation on these roundtables has al-
ready been viewed publicly; Members 
being dropped from platforms because 
of poor connections; Members being un-
able to participate in web-based events 
due to poor internet connections in 
rural areas. And the list goes on. 
I mention these examples not to say 
that all virtual proceedings cannot or 
should not be authorized, but I share 
these issues as further proof that the 
‘‘crawl, walk, run’’ approach is nec-
essary to make sure that virtual pro-
ceedings are done successfully. 
In closing, I would like to reiterate 
what I shared at the Rules Committee 
hearing yesterday. I want to encourage 
all of us to take a step back. I want to 
make sure that we don’t have a prece-
dent set that will create a brand-new 
process. 
We are not here simply debating an 
outdated rule, Madam Speaker. We are 
here debating what kind of institution 
we want the people’s House to be and 
the example that we want to set for the 
American people and the rest of the 
world. 
If we vote to adopt H. Res. 965, we are 
setting a new precedent that will for-
ever change the processes that are used 
in the House of Representatives. It 
opens a Pandora’s box, and it provides 
constitutional risks. And in times of 
crisis, Americans should trust their 
leaders. Vote ‘‘no’’ on H. Res. 965. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I am disappointed with the gentle-
man’s statement. He referred to a 
failed attempt three weeks ago to deal 
with the issue of remote voting. There 
was no failed amendment. We pulled 
the bill to have discussions with Re-
publicans about how we can move for-
ward. That is why we did that. 
And then the gentleman refers to all 
of 
these 
amendments 
that 
were 
brought up in the Rules Committee, 
commonsense 
amendments. 
Yeah, 
amendments on everything, including 
abortion, immigration, airline travel. 
But the gentleman knows full well that 
many of the suggestions that the Re-
publicans offered during our negotia-
tions we took into account and are 
part of this proposal. 
So I don’t know what the gentleman 
is talking about, but I will tell you 
this: That kind of attitude, that com-
mentary, doesn’t bode well for future 
negotiations. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SHERMAN). 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, in 
all of our bills, virtually all the money 
goes to bandage the economic wounds. 
We need a greater focus on beating the 
disease. Workers need paid sick days so 
they will stay home if they are sick, 
even if they work for an employer with 
under 50 or over 500 employees. 
The Defense Production Act needs to 
be amended so it can provide for the li-
censing of new technology, and inven-
tors need to be well compensated if 
they invent something useful to attack 
the COVID virus. 
We have provided money for testing, 
but only one-quarter of 1 percent of the 
money we provide in this bill or prior 
bills has gone for therapeutics, prophy-
laxes, and vaccines. 
The clinical medical researchers of 
this country are sitting at home, be-
cause virtually all non-COVID medical 
research has been suspended. Let’s put 
them to work. Let’s learn more of the 
basic facts of COVID, and let’s test 
every reasonable combination of ge-
neric compounds at every stage of the 
disease. 
Yes, for a while, we can bind our eco-
nomic wounds, but ultimately, we need 
to beat the disease. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN), my good friend and rank-
ing member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, three 
weeks ago, the Attorney General of the 
United States said this: ‘‘The Constitu-
tion is not suspended during a crisis.’’ 
Amen to that. 
And guess who agreed with him, or at 
least used to agree with him? Last 
month, April 9, the Speaker of the 
House said: ‘‘There is a constitutional 
requirement that we vote in person.’’ 
But, oh, how that has changed. 
Today we are, in fact, suspending the 
Constitution. We are allowing proxies 
to establish a quorum and do the busi-
ness of the American people. The Su-
preme Court has been very clear on 
this. In the Ballin decision, the Court 
said Members have to be present by 
stating: ‘‘All that the Constitution re-
quires is the presence of a majority, 
and when that majority are present the 
power of the House arises.’’ 
You have got to be there. Actually, 
you have got to be here. You have got 
to be here to do the business of the peo-
ple. You can’t phone it in. You can’t 
mail it in. This bill would allow one 
Member to have 10 proxies in their 
back pocket. Think about that. 22 
Members with 10 proxies in their back 
pocket could do the business of 330 mil-
lion people in this great country. 
We all take an oath to the Constitu-
tion. Article I, Section 4 of the Con-
stitution mandates that Congress must 
‘‘assemble at least once in every year.’’ 
That is when we start the session. 
Article I, Section 5 requires Congress 
to physically congregate and vote to 
change where it is going to sit; frankly, 
what is happening today. 
Section 5 also requires a recorded 
vote on any question at the desire of 
one-fifth present. 
Article I, Section 6 mandates and 
protects Members from arrest during 
travel to and from their attendance at 
a session of their respective House. 
You would think if you could mail in 
your vote, the Constitution wouldn’t 
protect you on traveling to the vote. 
All of these provisions envision Mem-
bers physically traveling and being 
present at the seat of the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
As Mrs. LESKO said earlier, farmers 
are planting crops, truckers are mov-
ing goods, grocers are stocking shelves, 
frontline healthcare workers haven’t 
missed a day. They can’t phone it in. 
They can’t mail it in. They can’t proxy 
their work in. They have to be there 
and do it, and we should do the same. 
The example this sends, the prece-
dent this sets, is so darn wrong. And I 
encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote on H. Res. 965. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS). 
b 0945 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the HEROES Act today 
because our frontline workers, first re-
sponders, and community members are 
rising to the occasion, and so must 
Congress. 
We know we are living through an 
unprecedented crisis. If we fail to re-
double our efforts, the public health 
threat will grow, more jobs will be per-
manently lost, additional small busi-
nesses will throw in the towel, and cit-
ies and towns will go bust. 
The conversations I have every day 
with mayors, hospital officials, small 
business owners, and essential workers 
underscore why bold action is imme-
diately needed. I fought for a number 
of provisions in this bill that are im-
portant to my constituents, including

aid to local government to sustain es-
sential services; free coronavirus test-
ing, treatment, and vaccines for low-in-
come individuals; expanded tax credits 
for small businesses to keep workers on 
the job; and giving our veterans a re-
prieve from VA debt collection. 
No bill is perfect, but with bipartisan 
cooperation in the coming days, we can 
deliver meaningful results. We can 
meet this moment responsibly, ensure 
our communities are equipped to over-
come this virus, and allow our econ-
omy to safely get back on its feet. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to change to two- 
thirds the threshold required to pass H. 
Res. 965, the resolution changing the 
rules of the House to adopt a proxy 
voting procedure on the floor and to 
allow remote proceedings. 
Madam Speaker, changing the rule 
does require a two-thirds vote, and 
that is what we are doing in this rule. 
Madam Speaker, the rules change 
that H. Res. 965 contemplates has sim-
ply never been utilized in the House of 
Representatives. We are quite literally 
setting a new precedent that will guide 
us into the future. Any change of this 
magnitude should only pass the House 
with bipartisan consensus, and a two- 
thirds threshold is appropriate to dem-
onstrate whether or not such a drastic 
change and new precedent actually 
meets this test. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
the extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me clarify for the Record that it only 
takes a majority to change the rules. 
Democrats have changed the rules with 
a majority. The Republicans have 
changed the rules with a simple major-
ity, not two-thirds. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the distinguished gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. HASTINGS), an effective and 
distinguished Member of this House 
and the Rules Committee. 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, we 
convene today to pass a desperately 
needed relief package that will provide 
nearly $3 trillion in economic relief to 
frontline workers and families. I am 
proud to speak in favor of the rule and 
in strong support of the underlying leg-
islation, the HEROES Act. 
Like many of you, I continue to re-
ceive emails, letters, and phone calls 
from constituents bearing the brunt of 
this administration’s disorganized re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
My constituents write: ‘‘I have been 
denied unemployment even though I 
have met every criterion. I am about to 
lose everything. Please help me.’’ 
They write: ‘‘I am homeless. I was 
just laid off because the schools are 
closing. I have my granddaughter with 
me. I need help.’’ 
And they write: ‘‘I am literally on 
my last $100 for food and have already 
maxed out my credit cards. Please 
help. Please help. Please help.’’ 
Americans are afraid not just of how 
they are going to make ends meet but 
whether they are going to make it 
through this pandemic at all. 
Yet, this White House remains ut-
terly disconnected from reality, mov-
ing at every opportunity to reject 
science, sideline medical experts, and 
pat themselves on the back for a job 
well done, even as the COVID–19 pan-
demic tears our communities apart. 
This week, President Trump said 
that ‘‘we have prevailed,’’ that ‘‘we are 
going to have one of the best years we 
have ever had,’’ that we are beginning 
to 
‘‘transition 
to 
greatness.’’ 
The 
President of the United States refers to 
over 80,000 dead Americans as a ‘‘tran-
sition to greatness’’? I wish I could say 
that I was shocked, but I am not. 
What we continue to witness is a ca-
tastrophe. Calling it anything less does 
a great disservice to the millions of 
Americans who are affected by this ill-
ness. 
If there is to be any silver lining in 
these trying days, at this exact mo-
ment, these public servants are work-
ing around the clock to protect us. 
Madam Speaker, I say to my con-
stituents: We see you. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Just briefly, I want to thank my good 
friend, the distinguished gentleman 
from Florida, for being here. We all 
know he is fighting bravely a very 
deadly disease, and it says a lot about 
his personal courage and his commit-
ment to service that he is here today. 
Madam Speaker, it is good to have him 
on the floor of the House. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), the 
ranking member of the Education and 
Labor Committee. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Oklahoma for yielding. 
Today is a dark day in the history of 
our country, and for that, I rise in op-
position to H. Res. 965, partisan legisla-
tion that would upend more than 200 
years of precedent and jeopardize the 
deliberative process of the House of 
Representatives. 
States have started reopening busi-
nesses, schools, and local economies. 
Congress should be following suit. Yet, 
this is the first time the House has 
come to semiregular order in over 2 
weeks. 
Speaker PELOSI and House Democrats 
are holding the people’s House hostage. 
They would rather erect and prolong a 
partisan blockade instead of doing the 
people’s business in the open. 
Members of Congress should not be 
on the sidelines. We can and should get 
back to official business, especially 
committee work. Hearings and mark-
ups are a critical function of the peo-
ple’s House. 
Without passing ill-conceived legisla-
tion that jeopardizes our democratic 
institution, the House proved 2 weeks 
ago, and again today, that we can con-
duct business while following health 
guidelines. There is no reason congres-
sional committees can’t do the same. 
Sadly, the Democrats are using this 
pandemic to justify gutting the Con-
stitution and our practices, and it is 
disgraceful. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER), a distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
it is good to see a Coloradan in the 
chair. I rise today in support of the 
rule, the HEROES Act, and H. Res. 965. 
Madam Speaker, I want to start by 
thanking Chairman MCGOVERN for his 
leadership and his vision through this 
Congress and especially these last dif-
ficult months. 
COVID–19 has affected every corner 
of our country and the world. The im-
pact of the virus and the blow to our 
economy is massive, and Congress 
must act with force and speed. 
While some of my colleagues may 
argue that we are spending too much 
money, these packages are a fraction of 
the losses we have suffered in this 
country and around the world. I am 
proud the HEROES Act includes a pro-
vision I introduced with Representa-
tive JOE MORELLE to provide $500 bil-
lion for States to help them to respond 
to the crisis and to avoid harmful cuts 
to law enforcement, firefighters, teach-
ers, healthcare, and others at a time 
when we can least afford it. 
The HEROES Act also includes a $375 
billion provision from fellow Coloradan 
JOE NEGUSE for local, county, and mu-
nicipal governments so they can main-
tain critical services. 
Another provision that I worked on is 
the inclusion of the bipartisan SAFE 
Banking Act to provide legitimate can-
nabis businesses that are legal under 
State laws access to the banking sys-
tem. The bill passed this body last fall 
with 321 votes, including 91 Repub-
licans. Cannabis businesses across the 
country have been deemed as essential 
during this pandemic, and these busi-
nesses and their estimated 243,000 em-
ployees deserve equity with other legal 
businesses. 
The SAFE Banking Act would also 
address the increased health risk of 
spreading COVID–19 on banknotes and 
coins, as well as the increased public 
safety risk associated with this cash- 
only industry. At a critical time, SAFE 
Banking will help protect jobs and en-
courage lending in our communities. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the HEROES Act, 
and I also encourage them to vote for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2016 
May 15, 2020 
H. Res. 965. We had a spirited debate on 
this yesterday in the Rules Committee, 
and the fact is that we cannot let Con-
gress come to a grinding halt, which is 
what I think some of my Republican 
colleagues would like to have us do. I 
believe it is legislative malpractice if 
we don’t allow for remote voting dur-
ing this pandemic. 
Mr. MCGOVERN
has acknowledged 
this is a first step, and I hope we con-
tinue discussions and eventually work 
on a permanent change to the House 
rules to ensure Congress operates with 
speed through future emergencies. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), a 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE) for yielding. 
These are strange times. I saw my 
friend ALCEE HASTINGS on the floor. I 
wanted to sit down beside him and 
whisper in his ear like we would have 
done when we gathered last year. I 
wanted to grab his hand and tell him I 
have been praying for him. Now, he is 
gone, back off the House floor and back 
into social distancing. 
No one denies that these are unusual 
times, even dire times, that require a 
substantial response. In many ways, 
what we are doing here today isn’t un-
usual. We have a majority in the U.S. 
House of Representatives that will, in 
fact, jam through, on an almost party- 
line vote, its agenda. That is not un-
usual. 
We have a majority in the House that 
is going to implement its ideas for 
rules changes in the House, even with-
out a minority amendment. That is not 
altogether unusual. But I have listened 
to colleague after colleague come to 
the House floor and talk about the un-
usual times that, I would argue, re-
quire an unusual response. 
I feel a little empty today in what I 
usually enjoy as a Rules Committee de-
bate. I know how the Rules Committee 
goes, Madam Speaker. There are nine 
members of the majority and four 
members of the minority. The majority 
wins every vote, and not by a little, by 
a lot. 
Your job, as a minority member on 
the Rules Committee, is to lose. You go 
up there, and you lose every day. That 
is often the way the House is when we 
are trying to put together a House po-
sition that is going to go into negotia-
tion. 
But I have heard the sense of urgency 
that I know each of my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle believes, and our 
sense of urgency today doesn’t allow us 
time to push a messaging bill across 
the floor. 
Madam Speaker, this is the single 
largest borrow-and-spend bill the coun-
try has ever seen, and it included not 
one Republican amendment—not one. 
The single largest rules change the 
House of Representatives has seen in 
any of our lifetimes, and the under-
lying rules change includes not one Re-
publican amendment—not one. 
I listened to my chairman, for whom 
I have great respect. Candidly, with the 
small nature of the Rules Committee, 
we are able to develop relationships 
that the entire institution is not able 
to develop. I wish everybody on the 
House floor knew the gentleman from 
Massachusetts as I believe I know the 
gentleman from Massachusetts. When 
he talks about fighting hunger, when 
he talks about us doing better, he is 
absolutely right and absolutely sin-
cere. When he talks about people suf-
fering, when he talks about people in 
desperate need, he is absolutely right 
and absolutely sincere. 
When my friend from Florida, Ms. 
SHALALA, said that she doesn’t get 
calls in her office but that she gets 
cries from desperate people for help, I 
know that feeling because my office 
gets the same ones. 
But that is not everything that is in 
this bill. This bill isn’t all testing. This 
bill isn’t all hunger. 
I offered an amendment yesterday in 
the Rules Committee that said: You 
know what? We are going to perpetuate 
the myth that we disagree on every-
thing in this institution. In a partisan 
way, let’s divide this 1,800-page bill up. 
Let’s divide it up into sections, and 
let’s support those things that we can 
support and oppose those things that 
we oppose. Let’s support hunger pre-
vention and remediation. Let’s support 
food for children. Let’s support testing 
for first responders. Let’s do those 
things. 
Madam Speaker, this bill also repeals 
the SALT tax. It reinstitutes the SALT 
tax deduction. This is not an idea that 
has come about in an emergency. This 
is something we have been arguing 
about since 2017. This is something the 
Ways and Means Committee acted on 
in an almost purely partisan way in 
December. This is something the House 
acted on in a purely partisan way in 
December, long before we were talking 
about COVID. 
This is a provision where 80 percent 
of Americans, the bottom 80 percent of 
all income-earning households, receive 
4 cents out of every dollar of this provi-
sion, 4 cents to the bottom 80 percent 
of Americans. The top 5 percent of 
Americans, the top 5 percent of income 
earners, receive 80 cents out of every 
dollar. 
It is not an emergency. It is not 
COVID-related. It is not going to the 
neediest of these. It is not a million- 
dollar provision. It is not a billion-dol-
lar provision. It is not a $10 billion pro-
vision. It is a $200 billion provision 
tucked into this borrow-and-spend bill. 
Madam Speaker, we don’t disagree on 
serving those who need to be served. 
We don’t disagree on medical research. 
We don’t disagree on education. But we 
do have disagreements. 
An 1,800-page bill, and I offered an 
amendment to say let’s divide it up 
into sections so we can support what 
we can support in a bipartisan way and 
push through in a partisan way the 
things that we can’t support. It was de-
nied. 
There are times and places to have 
partisan 
debates, 
Madam 
Speaker. 
Today is not one of them, and I reject 
the path that we are on. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
b 1000 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 1 minute. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, we 
have an opportunity, and not an oppor-
tunity that is an untread path as the 
path we are on today. We have a well- 
tread path. 
I will remind my colleagues, as we 
fight amongst ourselves on this legisla-
tion, we have been to this floor already 
on COVID-related measures in a bipar-
tisan, partnership-negotiated way. Not 
once, not twice, three times we have 
gone down that path. 
For folks who are watching the de-
bate today, Madam Speaker, I hope 
they don’t take away that we are di-
vided when it comes to supporting our 
constituency. I hope they don’t take 
away that we are divided when it 
comes to standing united on behalf of 
those families that cannot stand for 
themselves in this tough time. And I 
hope, for my colleagues who feel like 
they need to push a messaging bill 
through no matter what, that they re-
member those times just a few short 
weeks ago where we came together, 
where 
we 
stood 
together, 
largest 
change in American history, largest 
bill, not one Republican amendment. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Vermont (Mr. WELCH). 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, on 
March 1, Vermont had the lowest un-
employment rate in its history. Today, 
it has the highest unemployment rate 
in its history. About one-third of 
Vermonters who would like a job can’t 
find a job. 
The Federal Government is the only 
entity that has the fiscal flexibility 
and the fiscal capacity to meet that 
need. We have to act. This legislation 
would provide Vermont with over $2 
billion for State and local budgets. Ab-
sent that, the pain is going to be 
pressed, pressed, pressed down into our 
firefighters, our teachers, and our kids. 
It has reforms to the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program so our restaurants 
and our small businesses have a chance 
to make use of that, something both 
sides want to happen. 
It has $75 billion for testing, which is 
the path to getting on top of this virus. 
It provides funds to try to stabilize 
our institutions of higher education 
that we must have on the other side of 
this virus. 
There are differences, and we don’t 
have the luxury of time for the full de-
bate all of us would prefer, but we must 
act, and we must act now. If we make 
a mistake in how we proceed—and mis-
takes will be made—it should be on the 
side of erring to do too much, not too 
little. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time is remain-
ing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2017 
May 15, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oklahoma has 3 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 9 minutes remaining. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD). 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in support of the HEROES Act, 
which meets urgent needs we are facing 
in northern Illinois. This legislation in-
vests in the testing, tracing, and treat-
ment we need to safely reopen our com-
munities. It supports the essential 
workers whose sacrifices and dedica-
tion are keeping us safe and provides 
direct funding that will make a critical 
difference for smaller communities. I 
am so proud it also includes my bill to 
eliminate out-of-pocket costs for vet-
erans and to help survivors of domestic 
violence. 
This bill is not perfect. We have more 
work to do, such as ensuring affordable 
healthcare coverage for the tens of mil-
lions of Americans who find it too ex-
pensive. But the HEROES Act will pro-
vide relief to all of our communities, 
and we must pass it today. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN), a distinguished 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I want to start by saluting Chairman 
MCGOVERN, who has done such a sensa-
tional job under adverse circumstances 
bringing us a new rule so that we can 
maintain the continuity of the U.S. 
Congress. 
We are bringing a rule forward today 
to allow for a very narrow exception to 
allow 
for 
proxy 
voting 
in 
the 
coronavirus emergency, when Members 
cannot get back to Washington, so we 
can continue the absolutely vital and 
central work of Congress. 
That work continues today with the 
HEROES Act, which will put trillions 
of dollars into the heroes of America: 
the firefighters and the cops, the teach-
ers, the frontline health workers, the 
emergency responders, the people who 
actually make America run. That is 
what the HEROES Act is all about. 
We hear a lot in Congress about how 
much people love the States and the 
cities and the towns. Now is the chance 
to show it. Let’s put our money where 
our mouth is and support Americans 
who are struggling with this crisis 
brought by the coronavirus and the 
mismanagement of the disease from 
the very beginning, the mismanage-
ment of our efforts to fight it. 
America, as Dr. Bright said yester-
day, does not have a plan. We need 
massive testing. We need vigilant con-
tact tracing. We need coordination of 
logistics rather than pitting the States 
against each other in a ruthless com-
petition for PPEs and for ventilators. 
The U.S. Government, under our Con-
stitution, should be coordinating the 
national effort, not pilfering supplies 
from the States, much less pitting the 
States against each other in a brutal 
competition. 
The HEROES Act takes us in the 
right direction by putting billions of 
dollars into the testing the population 
needs. A majority of the cases of infec-
tious transmission comes now from 
people who are asymptomatic or pre-
symptomatic. 
The only way to deal with the disease 
and to put the coronavirus on the run 
is to do mass testing, diligent contact 
tracing; and we have got lots of people 
who can do it, because more than 35 
million Americans have been thrown 
out of work in this process. 
Let’s put millions of people to work 
being contact tracers. Let’s unify as a 
country. Let’s show that America has 
the capacity and the strength to oper-
ate under our system of federalism to 
put money into the States and the 
counties and the cities to work to-
gether to stop the disease and to win 
this major public health battle. 
The HEROES Act is the way to go. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise for this big and bold For the 
People legislation. 
We have been called back again into 
this great Chamber because we can’t 
quit living, because the world placed us 
here in unprecedented times, not in 
control of this virus and events hap-
pening to us, but to bring bold and big 
legislation for the people to speak to 
the human conditions by creating a he-
roes fund to give frontline workers the 
hazard pay they deserve, to make sig-
nificant investments in State and local 
governments, direct payments to fami-
lies, fair elections, housing, testing, 
contact tracing, and other priorities I 
proudly support. 
The bill also includes language that I 
have championed to put a moratorium 
on consumer debt collection, to open 
up forgivable loans to more nonprofits, 
ban the box for small business loans, 
and to make sure that the smallest 
businesses can get a PPP loan, only to 
name a few. 
I challenge my colleagues to join us 
and vote for this big and bold bill. 
Americans deserve every penny of it. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am waiting for one other speaker, but 
I don’t think he has arrived, so I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank my good friend from Massa-
chusetts for a spirited debate. We cer-
tainly had one yesterday, and we had 
one again today, and I know we will 
have one in a few minutes. 
In closing, Madam Speaker, I urge 
opposition to the rule. I oppose both 
the change in House rules that is being 
proposed today, and I oppose the mas-
sive and unwarranted 1,800-page, $3 
trillion Democratic wish list that the 
majority is proposing as well. 
The rules changes that this resolu-
tion 
proposes 
will 
fundamentally 
change the nature of the institution. I 
know that is not the intent of my 
friends, but I think that is the impact 
of the rule. 
I am deeply concerned with how 
these changes will actually work in 
place, and I am concerned that we are 
doing so without regard to the fact 
that a change like this is likely to lead 
to litigation and may place in jeopardy 
legislation that we pass in a bipartisan 
manner. 
After reaching a bipartisan agree-
ment on $2.5 trillion in spending over 
the last 6 weeks, the majority is now 
seeking to spend $3 trillion more, re-
gardless of the actual needs of the Na-
tion and, frankly, without any input 
from the Republican side of the aisle. 
My friends talk about the urgency of 
the moment. I agree. This is an urgent 
moment. But I also agree that we are 
going to have to work in a bipartisan 
fashion to actually pass something. So 
if this makes my friends feel better, 
that is fine; and if the intent is to set 
out a negotiating position, I guess that 
is legitimate; but if you think this is 
going to end up as law, you are sadly 
mistaken. The Senate has already said 
it will not take up the bill. The Presi-
dent has already said that, if it reaches 
his desk, he would veto it. 
So let’s do what we have done four 
times in a row: Sit down; work to-
gether; craft a bipartisan bill. We have 
proven we can do it, and we can do it 
again. 
I am just mystified why my friends 
have felt the need to inject a clearly 
partisan bill and think this is going to 
move us down the road in the right di-
rection. It is not. They are going to ce-
ment a lot of Members in on both sides 
of the aisle to positions that will make 
it more difficult to reach a common 
agreement when that is the appro-
priate thing to do. 
This really is an exercise in legisla-
tive futility. H.R. 6800 will never be-
come law. Democrats know that, and 
they are not going to be able to jam it 
through. 
So they can come down here and talk 
about it as much as they want, and 
there are certainly some parts of it I 
could support, but as a package, it is 
going nowhere, and it is not moving us 
toward a solution. 
I implore my colleagues to return to 
what they have done in the previous 
four bills where we worked together, 
brought a product that was bipartisan 
to the floor, and passed it overwhelm-
ingly with almost no dissent. That was 
the formula for success. The formula 
they are pursuing now will not succeed. 
They know it will not succeed. 
I have never been convinced as to 
why deliberately launching out some-
thing you know won’t pass is useful.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2018 
May 15, 2020 
Both sides do it, by the way, from time 
to time. We have certainly done it, so 
I don’t want to suggest this is strictly 
a partisan exercise. 
This bill will not succeed. I urge re-
jection of the rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, let me begin by 
again thanking my colleague from 
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) for the tone he 
set in the Rules Committee debate yes-
terday and for his friendship and for al-
ways trying to be constructive. 
Madam Speaker, I began this debate 
by speaking about the challenge we 
face today. And make no mistake, the 
list is long, but I have no doubt the 
American people can rise to these chal-
lenges. They are resilient and have 
shown again and again a perseverance 
that is no match for even a global pan-
demic. 
The 
question, 
quite 
frankly, 
is 
whether our elected officials are up to 
these challenges; whether we are will-
ing to rise above knee-jerk partisan-
ship of the moment and put what is 
best for our country and this institu-
tion first ahead of the next great sound 
bite and before the next election. 
In all my time here, I have seen us do 
that again and again, whether we face 
war or terrorism or natural disaster. I 
was proud of the way we came together 
on prior coronavirus bills, too. 
But I worry that something is chang-
ing on the other side. It is deeply con-
cerning to see the President throw up 
his 
hands 
and 
essentially 
say, 
‘‘Enough.’’ He has declared victory on 
testing, despite it being out of reach 
for most Americans. 
The Senate majority leader has es-
sentially said he is hitting pause on 
doing anything else related to this pan-
demic for the time being. 
And there are some on the other side 
of this Chamber who want to conduct 
business as usual around here as if 
nothing has changed. We hear it today 
on the floor. Some Members get up and 
downplay this pandemic like it is no 
big deal. It is like we are living in ‘‘The 
Twilight Zone.’’ 
We are at the start of this pandemic, 
Madam Speaker, not the end, and if we 
run into our respective partisan cor-
ners now, what example are we setting? 
Things could get worse in the fall, and 
what then? 
Madam Speaker, we need to act, and 
we need to act boldly and immediately, 
and that includes passing this rule. It 
means passing the HEROES Act, and it 
means 
making 
these 
temporary 
changes to allow for virtual committee 
proceedings and remote floor voting 
during this pandemic. This is what the 
moment requires. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 967 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
Sec. 13. Notwithstanding any other section 
of this resolution, an affirmative vote of 
two-thirds of the Members present and vot-
ing, a quorum being present, shall be re-
quired on adoption of House Resolution 965. 
b 1015 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays

H2021 
May 15, 2020

SEC. 6. REGULATIONS. 
To the greatest extent practicable, sec-
tions 1, 2, and 3 of this resolution shall be 
carried out in accordance with regulations 
submitted for printing in the Congressional 
Record by the chair of the Committee on 
Rules. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for 1 hour, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Rules. 
The gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN) and the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we are 
in the midst of a pandemic, the likes of 
which the world hasn’t seen in more 
than 100 years. 
The question before us today is a 
simple one: Will this institution, which 
has adapted to challenges and tech-
nology time and time again throughout 
its history, adapt so that we can con-
tinue legislating during this public 
health emergency. 
Medical experts have told us that 
COVID–19 is up to three times more 
contagious than the flu. That means, 
in a normal cycle of this virus, just one 
person with coronavirus could kick off 
a snowball effect that leads to up to 
59,000 new infections. 
Now think about that. 
And then think about the way we 
normally operate here. Members travel 
frequently from their home States, 
some of which are coronavirus hot 
spots, to convene together here in the 
Capitol complex. Then we travel back 
home at the end of the week. And we 
repeat this process month after month 
after month. 
Along the way, we come in contact 
with fellow travelers, colleagues, the 
general public, press, and the hundreds 
and hundreds of people who help make 
this House operate. There is no telling 
who among them could have com-
promised immune systems, preexisting 
conditions, or other heightened risks 
for illness. But we know just how easy 
this virus spreads among those with 
strong immune systems. 
That is why the choices that each 
one of us makes are especially impor-
tant—not just about protecting Mem-
bers of Congress. This is about pro-
tecting all of those who come in con-
tact with us. 
Now, any of us could have the virus 
and not even know it. We could be 
asymptomatic but be carriers nonethe-
less. Convening Congress must not turn 
into a superspreader event. 
Technology has changed considerably 
over the last 231 years. There are now 
tools available that make temporary 
committee 
proceedings 
and 
remote 
voting on the House floor possible—not 
forever, just temporarily during this 
emergency. 
Now, some on the other side seem to 
think 
that 
temporarily 
embracing 
technology during this pandemic is a 
radical idea. 
Well, let me say this loud and clear 
to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker: If any-
one tells you you would be giving away 
your vote with remote voting by proxy, 
this is just a lie. Plain and simple, it is 
just not true. 
What would be radical is if this 
House did nothing, if we made Members 
decide between spreading a deadly 
virus or legislating for the American 
people. That is a false choice. We can 
and we should do both. 
At least 16 States, 10 countries, and 
the European Parliament have all im-
plemented some form of remote proce-
dures to safely conduct official pro-
ceedings during this pandemic. With 
this resolution, this House can finally 
join them. 
Now, let me repeat: We are not sug-
gesting permanent changes. No one be-
lieves we do our best work in person 
and side by side more than me, Mr. 
Speaker. Remote legislating will only 
be utilized so long as this pandemic 
continues. 
Mr. Speaker, this is the type of 
adapting that this House has always 
done. Our Founders did not vote by 
electronic device, but we do. Constitu-
ents, decades ago, couldn’t watch floor 
proceedings live on C–SPAN or listen 
to them on the radio, but ours can. 
Changes were made to our quorum re-
quirement time and time again, includ-
ing most recently after the September 
11 attacks. And I could go on and on 
and on and on. 
Believe it or not, adapting is action 
in this institution’s DNA. There are al-
ways those quick to proclaim that any 
change means ending the House as we 
know it. But you know what, Mr. 
Speaker? The sky did not fall, and the 
House continues its work. 
So I don’t say this to make light of 
what we are doing here today. What we 
are doing is serious. It is a big deal. My 
State of Massachusetts has one of the 
oldest legislatures in the country, but 
even they changed their rules to allow 
for remote voting. 
You can respect tradition without 
blinding yourself of the need to make 
temporary changes when necessary, 
and today is one of those times. This 
resolution comes after careful study, 
months of talks, feedback from con-
stitutional experts, and conversations 
among a bipartisan task force. This 
resolution has been strengthened by 
this deliberative process, and it con-
tains many provisions suggested by my 
Republican friends. It is now time to 
act. 
Now, some communities have turned 
the corner with this virus, and I hope 
that continues. Medical experts tell us, 
however, that a second wave this fall 
could be even more damaging than 
what we are seeing now. So as we hope 
for the best, we must prepare for the 
worst. Anything less would be a dere-
liction of our responsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join with us in supporting 
this resolution. Let’s adapt the way 
this institution has always done. And 
let’s make sure that we can continue 
legislating during this pandemic, no 
matter what the future may bring. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we have worked long 
and hard together and tried to do so co-
operatively. As my friend said, there 
are a number of things in here we have 
worked on together but, in the end, we 
were unable to reach an agreement. 
Mr. Speaker, we are back here to 
consider the resolution representing 
the most consequential change to the 
rules of the House of Representatives 
in my time in Congress, and possibly 
the most consequential rules change 
since the establishment of the modern 
committee system in the Legislative 
Reorganization Act of 1946. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, the majority is 
proposing, for the first time in our his-
tory, a system of proxy voting on the 
floor of the House of Representatives. 
That change also allows for the adop-
tion of a totally remote voting proce-
dure upon the certification of a single 
Member of Congress. Second, it would 
allow for committees to perform re-
mote proceedings, including markups. 
Above all else, Mr. Speaker, Repub-
licans believe that any change to cen-
turies-old rules of the House should 
only be done in a bipartisan way that 
achieves 
consensus. 
Unfortunately, 
these proposed rules changes do not 
meet that goal. 
While I have no doubt of the chair-
man’s good intentions, I believe these 
changes will fundamentally alter the 
nature of the institution, and not for 
the better. As such, I simply cannot 
support them. 
Mr. Speaker, though this resolution 
is intended only to deal with the 
present public health emergency, we 
must never forget that the temporary 
changes that we make today become 
the precedent that we follow tomorrow. 
I am deeply concerned that shifting to 
remote activity, both in the form of 
proxy voting and the form of remote 
committee work, will fundamentally 
change the way the House operates and 
will remove the collegial environment 
we enjoy when we meet in person, get

to know one another, and use our 
knowledge of each legislator as a per-
son to move toward bipartisan con-
sensus. I fear that that would be lost in 
remote activity. 
I am also deeply concerned that these 
changes will not pass constitutional 
muster. Why we would risk exposing 
important legislation to obvious con-
stitutional flaws does not make sense 
to me. 
Most of all, I am concerned that we 
are moving forward with these changes 
on a partisan basis. Any change that is 
this consequential should only be done 
after we reach bipartisan agreement— 
no matter how difficult it may be to 
achieve. 
Mr. Speaker, I think a bipartisan 
agreement was possible on much of 
what my friends are trying to accom-
plish, but today’s resolution is simply 
not it. 
I have a modest suggestion to my 
friends: Let’s take appropriate cau-
tions and go back to work. That is 
what the executive branch is doing. 
That is what the United States Senate 
is doing. That is what millions of 
Americans do each and every day. We 
should be no different. The House 
should do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject these rules changes today and 
return to the drawing board so that we 
can act together in a bipartisan man-
ner to ensure that Congress can con-
tinue to operate during this crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
resolution, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD
a letter from 
Erwin Chemerinsky, the renowned con-
stitutional scholar and dean of Berke-
ley School of Law, who actually wrote 
the book on constitutional law, dis-
cussing his view that the remote vot-
ing process we are considering today 
would be constitutional. 
BERKELEYLAW, 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, 
May 13, 2020. 
Chairman MCGOVERN and Ranking Member 
COLE, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN
AND RANKING 
MEMBER COLE: I have been asked for my view 
as to whether the House of Representatives 
could constitutionally adopt a rule to permit 
remote voting by proxy. As explained below, 
I believe that this would be constitutional 
and it is very unlikely that any court would 
invalidate such a rule, especially in light of 
the current public health emergency. 
My understanding is that the system of re-
mote voting by proxy that is being consid-
ered would have some key features: 
Low-tech remote voting process through 
proxy voting 
Some number of Members would be present 
on the Floor for debate and in-Chamber vot-
ing 
Proxy would be used to establish a quorum 
and to register the yeas/nays 
The proxy holder would be another Mem-
ber of the House 
The proxy holder would have NO discretion 
on the vote. Instead, the proxy holder would 
be required (through the rule and accom-
panying regulations) to cast the vote in ac-
cordance with the specific and exact instruc-
tion from the Member. 
The Constitution bestows on each House of 
Congress broad discretion to determine the 
rules for its own proceedings. Article I, sec-
tion 5 of the Constitution says: ‘‘Each House 
may determine the Rules of its proceedings.’’ 
This authority is expansive and would in-
clude the ability to adopt a rule to permit 
proxy voting. Nothing in the Constitution 
specifies otherwise. 
Moreover, if this were challenged in court, 
it is very likely that the case would be dis-
missed as a political question. The Supreme 
Court has ruled that challenges to the inter-
nal operation of Congress are not justiciable 
in the federal courts. See Field v. Clark, 143 
U.S. 649 (1892). Indeed, I have written, the 
Court often ‘‘has held that congressional 
judgments pertaining to its internal govern-
ance should not be reviewed by the federal 
judiciary.’’ Erwin Chemerinsky, Constitu-
tional Law: Principles and Policies § 2.8.5 (6th 
ed. 2019). 
Especially in the context of the current 
public health emergency, it is highly un-
likely that any court would review and in-
validate the procedures adopted by the 
House of Representatives that would allow it 
to conduct its business without endangering 
the health of its members and its staff. 
Every branch of government is devising new 
procedures to accomplish this. The Supreme 
Court, for example, will conduct oral argu-
ments by telephone for the first time in its 
history. I am sure that the rules will ensure 
that the votes cast by proxy are accurate 
and carefully recorded. 
I hope that this is helpful. Please do not 
hesitate to let me know if I can be of further 
assistance. 
Sincerely, 
ERWIN CHEMERINSKY. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, in the 
letter, the dean states: ‘‘The Constitu-
tion bestows on each House of Congress 
broad discretion to determine the rules 
for its own proceedings. . . . This au-
thority is expansive and would include 
the ability to adopt a rule to permit 
proxy voting. Nothing in the Constitu-
tion specifies otherwise.’’ 
I also just say to my friend that the 
White House isn’t operating as business 
as usual. My understanding is that the 
Vice President has been sequestered 
from the President. In addition to that, 
everybody in the White House is being 
tested multiple times before they can 
even get near the President. A lot of 
the work is being done by video con-
ference. So even they are doing things 
differently. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
PETERS). 
b 1300 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H. Res. 965 to au-
thorize remote voting and to continue 
committee proceedings remotely dur-
ing the public health emergency of 
COVID–19. 
Governors and mayors across the Na-
tion have ordered Americans to stay 
home, to work from home, and avoid 
travel. Until we have adequate testing 
or a vaccine to protect ourselves and 
prevent our healthcare system from 
being overwhelmed, the best we can do 
here is to follow that advice. 
We in Congress must do what we 
have asked of our constituents and 
what others have ordered of them. 
Some argue—and we have heard this 
just recently—that because we are ask-
ing our frontline heroes to show up at 
work, we lawmakers should be required 
to convene here in D.C. But that argu-
ment misses the point and dishonors 
our 
frontline 
workers, 
particularly 
those healthcare workers who are beg-
ging people to stay home, to avoid non-
essential travel in order to slow the 
spread of this deadly disease. They ask 
others to stay home so that some day 
they can go home. 
We in Congress are not first respond-
ers or frontline healthcare workers, al-
though our frontline responders are 
certainly counting on us to provide 
them the resources they need. But we 
can hold our meetings and conduct our 
communications 
electronically. 
And 
because of the space limitations cre-
ated 
by 
the 
need 
for 
physical 
distancing, working remotely is prob-
ably the only way that all of our com-
mittees can function at the same time. 
Like everyone else, I don’t want to 
give up the opportunity to work with 
my colleagues in person. Our inter-
actions are too productive, and our re-
lationships are too valuable. But in the 
face of this once-in-a-lifetime global 
pandemic, we need to overcome our de-
fault position. 
Remote voting is not cowardice. It is 
leadership. Let’s live by the same rules 
we impose on our fellow citizens. Let’s 
show by our actions that we ourselves 
take this threat seriously. 
I want to thank the leadership of Mr. 
MCGOVERN and Ms. LOFGREN and all of 
the other folks who have worked on 
this, including my friend, Mr. COLE, 
and I urge support of this resolution. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. THORNBERRY), my good friend and 
the distinguished ranking member of 
the House Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, 
those of us on the Armed Services 
Committee are privileged to work 
around, with, and for the men and 
women who serve in the military. 
Every one of them is a volunteer. 
Every one of them expects reasonable 
precautions with their health and safe-
ty and well-being. But every one of 
them knows that in carrying out their 
duties, there is some risk that goes 
with it, and they carry out their duties 
admirably. 
What a contrast to what we are see-
ing with this resolution. I think one of 
the proudest times I have had in this 
House over the last 25 years has been 
on 9/11 and the days thereafter. That 
very evening, Members gathered on the 
steps of the Capitol, and in the days 
thereafter we went right back to work 
and passed the legislation that was 
needed to deal with the terrorist 
threat. 
We were not even intimidated when 
many of our offices were attacked by 
anthrax in the days thereafter. It was 
not just about showing resolution to 
the terrorists; it was about showing the

country that we can come together and 
get our work done. What a contrast to 
what we are seeing with this resolu-
tion. 
Through the Civil War, 1918 flu, 
World War II, 9/11, throughout our his-
tory, there has never been proxy voting 
on this floor. Members accepted the 
risk and carried out their duties to the 
best of their ability. It was not about 
technology; it was about trust and in-
tegrity. 
Were our predecessors so much brav-
er than we are? Were they more igno-
rant about the risk or more careless 
with their own safety? Was their sense 
of their responsibility to the American 
people greater than ours? None of this 
makes sense. 
But what makes the least sense of 
all, Mr. Speaker, is that any Member of 
either party would support a resolution 
that allows any of us to vacate, even 
temporarily, the trust placed in us by 
voters and undermine the very founda-
tion of this representative democracy. 
Our history is better than that. The 
voters deserve better than that. To me, 
Mr. Speaker, it is sad, rather des-
picable, and one of the darkest days in 
this institution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me just say to the gentleman 
who just spoke, I am not intimidated, 
and I am not afraid; none of us are 
here. This isn’t about any of that. This 
is about doing what is sensible, what is 
in the public health interest. This is 
not about us. It is about the people you 
all come in contact with. 
Those who walk around and don’t 
wear masks, somehow as a display of 
how unafraid they may be, may be car-
riers who are asymptomatic spreading 
this disease. 
This is a public health crisis. This is 
different than what happened on 9/11. 
This is a public health crisis; that is, 
somebody who is carrying this disease 
can spread it in a very aggressive way. 
So please spare me the self-righteous 
kind of indignation over this. We are 
supposed to follow the medical advice. 
We are supposed to practice social 
distancing. 
And yet, the Rules Committee, which 
is the smallest committee in the Con-
gress, had to meet in the Ways and 
Means Committee room, and we took 
up the whole room. We have 21 stand-
ing committees; I don’t know how 
many subcommittees. Where does the 
Armed 
Services 
Committee 
meet? 
Where does the Transportation Com-
mittee meet? Maybe we can meet on 
the House floor, maybe one committee 
at a time. 
I mean, the bottom line is, if we are 
going to follow the medical advice, we 
should not paralyze this institution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER), a distinguished member 
of this Chamber and a co-chair of the 
Problem Solvers. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today as Congress adapts for this 
pandemic so that we can represent our 
constituents and shape legislation dur-
ing this crisis and do so safely in line 
with CDC guidelines. 
This resolution includes remote com-
mittee participation and proxy voting, 
which are essential reforms during this 
pandemic and key to giving the Amer-
ican public the accountability and 
transparency they deserve. I am hoping 
remote floor debate and voting are 
next, and this paves the way. The Su-
preme Court is doing it, and so can we. 
State legislators, including Okla-
homa, and in my State of New Jersey, 
and legislators around the world are 
doing it. We are behind here, and it is 
time we step up. There is nothing ex-
treme about working this way and 
adapting during an emergency, just 
like all Americans have. 
I am very grateful to Chairman 
MCGOVERN, my good friend, a true 
statesman and institutionalist, and 
Representative LOFGREN, who has done 
an incredible job, for working with us 
in the Problem Solvers Caucus, with 
Democrats and Republicans, as we have 
continued making strides towards a 
truly remote system. 
This debate and work are key for my 
district in north Jersey, which is at the 
epicenter of this crisis. Today’s bill 
also includes full reinstatement of the 
SALT deduction, giving New Jersey a 
long-needed tax cut, something I have 
been fighting for for years. It also helps 
small businesses make ends meet, for 
workers who aren’t sure they will get 
another paycheck, and for every other 
single county and community so they 
can support teachers, cops, EMS, and 
firefighters. 
But it starts with making sure our 
system is built so we can do it, and to-
day’s proposal does just that. We 
should all support this legislation to 
defend this institution, to protect it, 
and to ensure that accountability and 
transparency in this institution lives 
on forever in the greatest country in 
the world. 
I know we will get through this to-
gether if we put country ahead of 
party. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. HAGEDORN), my good friend 
and a distinguished Member of this 
body. 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, I be-
lieve this is a bad idea for this institu-
tion and a terrible example for the Na-
tion. I recommend a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
You know, it is ironic that as our Na-
tion opens up and people go back to 
work safely and responsibly into their 
jobs, the House is making a move to 
shut down, for all intents and purposes. 
You know, tens of millions of Ameri-
cans throughout this outbreak, this 
pandemic, have been out delivering and 
producing our energy, our food, helping 
with people in hospitals, policing our 
neighborhoods. They have been doing 
their jobs, and we should be doing our 
jobs in person moving forward. 
You know, some might question why 
a Member of Congress like myself, who 
is dealing with stage 4 cancer, getting 
treatment the last year at the Mayo 
Clinic, why I would be the one passion-
ately wanting everyone to travel and 
work in this Chamber, work in our 
committees. And it is because it is a 
bad idea for this House. It is a bad idea 
that we don’t do our jobs in person. We 
are setting a terrible example. 
Personally, though, I can tell you 
this: This is the job that I signed up 
for. This is the job that I asked the 
people of southern Minnesota for. And 
this is the job that I want to do. It is 
an honor to serve them. I think we 
should do it in person, work in com-
mittee in person, and do our jobs. And 
we can do it safely and responsibly. 
I recommend a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the 
gentleman should be happy to know 
under the proposal we have, he can 
come here anytime he wants. He can be 
in his committee. He can be on this 
floor and debate. But this is for those 
who are in circumstances where that is 
impossible. It provides an opportunity 
for them to participate as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the activity of the 
House Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee, as we work through ex-
traordinary circumstances to deliver 
for the American people. 
The Science Committee, under the 
leadership of Chairwoman JOHNSON and 
Ranking Member LUCAS, has been hold-
ing briefings on topics such as infra-
structure, energy jobs, vaccine devel-
opments, 
through 
the 
great 
tech-
nologies available to us over the world-
wide web. Each has been bipartisan. 
One important focus has been our do-
mestic manufacturing role, retooling 
production lines to make the medical 
supplies needed to respond to the ongo-
ing health crisis. This has been of par-
ticular 
importance 
for 
the 
Sub-
committee on Research and Tech-
nology, which I chair, along with 
Ranking Member BAIRD. 
How do we open platforms and utilize 
digital technologies for industrial col-
laboration to solve big problems and 
streamline our supply chain to get the 
medical supplies to those who need 
them now? 
The Science Committee will continue 
to do the work it has always done to 
meet the needs of the American people, 
to propel American manufacturing in-
novation forward. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
fabulous resolution that will enable us 
to continue to do our work under great 
and trying circumstances. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WOMACK), my very good friend, 
and the distinguished Republican rank-
ing member of the Budget Committee, 
and a fellow member of the Appropria-
tions Committee. 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, born 
from the people, the work of Congress

is an integral part of our Nation. Or is 
it? Judging from the legislation that is 
before us right now, I am not so sure. 
But tracing back to the Civil War, 
the Great Depression, World War II, 9/ 
11, and many others, the House’s busi-
ness has never ceased, even in the 
toughest times in our country, and it 
should not cease today. 
But instead of working safely, bring-
ing back Members to the House, Speak-
er PELOSI has decided to pursue proxy 
voting. 
Senators are back at work. Our mili-
tary is on point right now defending 
our country in all corners of the world. 
Doctors, 
nurses, 
grocery 
workers, 
truck drivers, delivery personnel, they 
are showing up every day. They are not 
shirking from their duty. Shouldn’t the 
House lead by example? 
New House procedures might very 
well be necessary, but any change to 
the centuries-old rules that could fun-
damentally 
alter 
this 
institution 
should never be done without bipar-
tisan support. And we are not seeing 
that. 
This proposal runs counter to the 
Constitution, and it marginalizes, in 
my strong opinion, Mr. Speaker, the 
lawmaking process. 
We 
need 
transparency, 
account-
ability, not procedures that further 
centralize the decision-making of our 
country into the hands of a select few. 
We must get back to regular order, and 
this is not the path back to regular 
order. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I am happy to provide the gentleman 
who just spoke with the history of the 
House of Representatives as to how 
voting rules have changed repeatedly. 
But this radical idea that we are 
talking about here today, just look to 
the United States Senate. I mean, they 
just held a hearing in their Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions where some people were present, 
and some were remote. The chair and 
ranking member were remote, and ad-
ministration witnesses were brought in 
through video conferencing. 
I mean, the Senate can do it. Maybe 
my friends are afraid of technology. We 
will get you the help. We will get you 
the help to make it comfortable for 
you. But the bottom line is, if the Sen-
ate can do it, if it is okay for the 
United States Senate, why is it not 
okay for the House of Representatives? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H. Res. 965. Today, there 
are more than 1.45 million confirmed 
COVID–19 cases and more than 86,000 
related deaths in the United States, 
and these numbers continue to in-
crease. 
Our job in Congress is to provide help 
and leadership in this crisis. It is crit-
ical that we continue serving our con-
stituents. But requiring Members of 
Congress to travel back and forth to 
Washington to vote and participate in 
official business in person during this 
pandemic puts the health of our con-
stituents and ourselves at greater risk. 
All this traveling by so many Mem-
bers of Congress will worsen the crisis 
we are working to mitigate. If you 
don’t agree with the rule changes, I 
urge you to reconsider. If you care 
about the health of your constituents, 
if you care about the health of your-
self, your colleagues, and your staff, 
and if you really want to mitigate this 
crisis, then support the temporary rule 
and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H. Res. 965. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), my very good 
friend. 
b 1315 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the 
word ‘‘congress’’ literally means the 
act of coming together and meeting. 
The Constitution calls for representa-
tives to attend, to assemble, and to 
meet. Congress is a deliberative body, 
and by its very nature, that requires 
the people’s representatives to interact 
with each other, both through formal 
proceedings as well as through the 
countless informal conversations that 
are the unique product of coming to-
gether and meeting. 
Fulfilling that duty, Congress has 
met throughout every war and pan-
demic that has come before us. We ex-
pect grocery clerks to show up at 4:00 
in the morning to restock the shelves, 
but the House of Representatives is 
going to phone it in? 
Each of us is the proxy for our con-
stituents. They expect us to speak and 
vote for them, and answer to them, not 
hand off that trust to someone entirely 
unaccountable because we are too lazy 
or too scared to show up for work. 
Good God, what are we doing to our 
country? 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
It is obvious that the gentleman who 
just spoke didn’t read the bill. Nobody 
is asking anybody to hand off their 
ability to cast a vote here. There is no 
discretion involved. If he reads the bill, 
he will figure that out. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a May 5 opinion piece published in The 
Hill from Saikrishna Prakash, a con-
stitutional law professor from the Uni-
versity of Virginia and former clerk to 
the 
late 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Antonin Scalia. 
[From the Hill, May 5, 2020] 
ONE VIRTUE OF A VIRTUAL CONGRESS 
(By Saikrishna Prakash) 
The need for social distancing has led to 
new demands for distant voting. With the 
coronavirus in the air, Congress is awash 
with proposals to allow senators and rep-
resentatives to cast votes away from the 
chamber floors on Capitol Hill. It is true 
that desperate times call for desperate meas-
ures, but however extreme this reform may 
seem, remote voting would indeed be allowed 
under the Constitution. This new practice 
could also lead to the reform of one regret-
table habit of the legislative branch. 
The Framers likely assumed that members 
of the chambers would gather in a single 
room in order to conduct business. Ref-
erences to ‘‘assemble’’ and ‘‘attendance’’ in 
the Constitution suggest as much. Congress 
could easily satisfy this narrow reading of 
these terms if each chamber met in cav-
ernous spaces. For instance, the Senate 
could meet in the baseball stadium where 
the Washington Nationals play, while the 
House could gather on the football field 
where the Washington Redskins play. Then 
legislators could easily sit several feet apart 
as they work. 
But the chambers need not be so con-
strained. Laws can have meaning and serve 
purposes without being tied to the tech-
nology of a particular era. For instance, 
modem presidents have signed legislation by 
autopen, even though this technology is 
somewhat new. The justification for this is 
that so long as the president makes a deci-
sion about whether to approve a bill, the me-
chanics of putting pen to parchment are ir-
relevant. The same holds true for the Su-
preme Court. The justices have reached deci-
sions by phone, sometimes hundreds of miles 
away from Washington. Six justices are nec-
essary to conduct business, and they have 
concluded that voting by phone on impor-
tant matters satisfies that requirement. 
Congress could do something similar. The 
Framers perhaps demanded no more than for 
legislators to debate and collectively reach 
decisions in real time. The internet permits 
that live discussion and passing laws, either 
by voice vote or by roll call. With the advent 
of technology, one chamber can ‘‘assemble’’ 
virtually on Zoom, while legislators can also 
attend meetings in Google. A chamber can 
sit to conduct business online. 
The more general point is that if legisla-
tors are monitoring proceedings in Congress 
online and can vote remotely, they are in 
‘‘attendance’’ 
and 
can 
be 
present 
for 
quorums. What is good for the president and 
the Supreme Court must be good for Con-
gress. There are positives and negatives of 
remote voting, so here are two potential dis-
advantages. 
First, Congress will no longer have the ex-
cuse of being unable to conduct business 
when members go back to their constitu-
encies. What was once a part time assembly 
may become a full time legislature, where 
leaders call votes during such inconvenient 
times for members. Many people do wish 
that Congress would return to its roots as a 
part time institution. To quote Will Rogers, 
‘‘This country has come to feel the same 
when Congress is in session as when the baby 
gets hold of a hammer.’’ 
Second, though legislators do not have to 
pay attention to floor debates even when 
they are physically present, one might sup-
pose that they will get more distracted if 
they have two browsers open, one trained on 
the proceedings in Congress and one centered 
on Sunday Night Football. A debate on a mo-
tion to recommit would suffer compared to a 
drive down the field in the final minute of 
the fourth quarter. 
But there would be one positive that over-
whelms these drawbacks. Last week, six 
members exercised the collective authority 
of the Senate and passed the $484 billion ap-
propriation. Though the Constitution de-
clares that a majority of each chamber 
would be a quorum to do business, the Sen-
ate had nothing like a quorum for this vote. 
Under 
current 
practices, 
however, 
both 
chambers assume a quorum, an assumption 
that can be overcome only if some legisla-
tors will call for it. 
That assumption is almost as mistaken as 
supposing that lobbyists exist to further the 
public good. The Constitution decrees that 
the chambers can pass a bill only if there is

a quorum. Members cannot just avert their 
gaze from this violation of the Constitution. 
The minimum mandate for passing legisla-
tion is not waivable. To pass legislation in a 
chamber, the presence of at least a majority 
of the voting members is required. 
With a move to virtual sessions, Congress 
could cut the embarrassment of a handful of 
legislators passing legislation. If bills are 
uncontroversial, the chambers can meet on-
line, and the majority in each can pass them. 
All in all, the move to remote voting could 
generate a salutary reform and also elimi-
nate at least one excrescence of the Con-
stitution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. In his piece, the 
professor says: The more general point 
is that if legislators are monitoring 
proceedings in Congress online and can 
vote remotely, they are in ‘attendance’ 
and can be present for quorums. What 
is good for the President and the Su-
preme Court must be good for Con-
gress.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening to the debate, and I have been 
really amazed at what I have heard 
from the other side. They said the mili-
tary goes into battle, or is ready to go, 
and they don’t let these things bother 
them. 
The military doesn’t have a great 
majority of their members who are 65 
years of age and older. And when they 
do have members that are 65 years of 
age and older, and they have morbidity 
systems or past incidents that make 
them more likely to get a disease, they 
don’t send them into battle. They take 
care of them. They don’t put them out 
there in harm’s way. 
Some people talked about the Sen-
ate. LAMAR ALEXANDER came up, and 
he got exposed to coronavirus from a 
staff member, so he had to go back to 
Maryville. RAND PAUL came up. He got 
exposed, took a test, still swam in the 
Senate pool, exposed everybody over 
there to COVID, and came back posi-
tive. 
So, it is not about the Senate. This 
makes good sense. 
One of our best epidemiologists said 
that the best place you could find to 
get the coronavirus is indoors in an en-
closed room with a lot of people and a 
lot of talk. That is the definition of 
Congress. Washington is a hot spot; it 
is under a stay-at-home order; and you 
are not supposed to meet in groups of 
more than 10 people. We are more than 
10. And if they expand it, we will be up 
to the level of 50, which is maybe the 
next level. 
We are just protecting our Members 
and protecting their loved ones and 
protecting their constituents. 
This is a good law. It gives people a 
chance to vote. We have Members who 
are going through chemotherapy now. 
The great JOHN LEWIS is going through 
chemotherapy. That means he cannot 
come up here and vote. That should not 
be the facts. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this rule change. 
Rather than taking time to imple-
ment a bipartisan plan to safely open 
this House and our work on the Hill, as 
suggested by the Republican leader, 
the House majority is taking the lazy 
way out. 
The U.S. Constitution and 200 years 
of precedent require a physical pres-
ence to establish a quorum to protect 
all Members’ rights and the rights of 
the Americans who vote for these 
Members. 
If we pass this rule change today and 
make attendance optional, we are tak-
ing away the fundamental nature of 
our government of elected Members of 
the House representing our citizens. 
Since the first Congress, through it 
all—bad roads, bad weather, invasion, 
and the burning of this very Capitol, 
Civil War, and depression—Members 
have assembled to do the people’s busi-
ness. 
Our Founders intended that legis-
lating be hard but fair. Our Founders 
compelled the people’s representatives 
to assemble, to collaborate, to find a 
way forward. This rule will only make 
it harder to find that consensus during 
these times. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to reject this unnecessary 
change to the House rules. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
remind my colleagues what the minor-
ity leader did suggest, and that is that 
all of us get preferential treatment, in 
terms of testing, that we all be tested 
regularly when we come back here, like 
they do in the White House; that even 
though our constituents can’t get test-
ed, even though our hospital workers 
and those who work in homeless shel-
ters and in food pantries can’t get test-
ed, and our first responders can’t all 
get tested, the minority leader sug-
gested that: You know, you are all so 
special here that you should move to 
the front of the line. 
Well, I don’t know what people in 
your districts think, but my constitu-
ents think that is tone-deaf, that, quite 
frankly, we don’t deserve preferential 
treatment. But that is what he sug-
gested. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
RASKIN), a distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I salute 
the chairman for his determination to 
keep the American Government going 
through this period, and that is what 
this resolution is about, the continuity 
of Congress and the continuity of gov-
ernment. We are here to keep the great 
American experiment in democratic 
self-government alive through the pan-
demic, through the crisis. 
The first sentence of the Constitu-
tion, the Preamble, says: 
We the people, in order to form a more per-
fect union, establish justice, ensure domestic 
tranquility, provide for the common defense, 
promote the general welfare, and preserve to 
ourselves and our posterity the blessings of 
liberty, do hereby ordain and establish the 
Constitution of the United States. 
The very next sentence vests all leg-
islative power to us, in Article I, in the 
Congress, and gives us the right to de-
termine the rules of our own pro-
ceedings. 
That is what the Supreme Court calls 
a political question. It cannot be sec-
ond-guessed by the Senate. It cannot 
be second-guessed by the President. It 
cannot be second-guessed even by the 
Supreme Court. It is up to us what our 
rules of proceeding are going to be. 
Mr. Speaker, I have watched the de-
bate, and one can only regard with 
amazement the full outrage summed up 
by our colleagues who display great 
reservoirs of self-righteousness. And it 
is amazing to me because the same 
Members have been operating for many 
years, for term after term, under the 
current rule, first adopted by a Repub-
lican-majority House, which allows two 
Members to form a working quorum. 
I repeat: The current rule, which this 
body 
has 
ratified 
repeatedly, 
was 
adopted by a Republican majority, al-
lowing two Members to constitute a 
working quorum. 
So, how can anyone who has blithely 
accepted that state of affairs, when it 
would have been very easy to do some-
thing about it—there was no pandemic 
and no plague let loose on the land, 
with 86,000 people dead and tens of mil-
lions of unemployed. They did nothing 
about it, but now they want to sud-
denly turn on the proposal necessary to 
guarantee the continuity of the U.S. 
Government in which the numerical 
quorum majority rule is scrupulously 
observed through the well-known and 
well-accepted proxy system. This rule 
preserves the vote and the voice of 
each and every Member of the House. 
Unlike the two-Member quorum rule, 
which was put into place by a Repub-
lican majority, our rule is based on ef-
fectuating the will and the vote of 
every Member. The proxies must be 
cast in strict accordance with the will 
of the Member, with no discretion, and 
no room for judgment. 
Mr. Speaker, I expect to be a proxy 
because I live about a half hour away 
from here. I will cast the proxy vote 
exactly as given to me. And if I were to 
decide I know better than the person I 
am voting for, that should be the sub-
ject of ethical proceedings. I am noth-
ing more than a letter carrier. 
This is what the Congress needs to 
do. The American people expect noth-
ing less from us. Let’s keep the Gov-
ernment of the United States in busi-
ness. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT), my great friend and 
distinguished Member. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, let me 
just read from the Constitution. 
Article I, Section 5: ‘‘Each House 
shall be the judge of the elections, re-
turns and qualifications of its own 
Members, and a majority of each shall 
constitute a quorum.’’

You can’t pass a bill on this floor 
with proxies and have it upheld unless 
you change the Constitution, and this 
doesn’t do it. 
Now, some here say: But if it saves 
one life, it is worth it. How about the 
million Americans who laid down their 
lives not for a wishy-washy, ‘‘Oh, 
maybe we should be afraid. We might 
get something and die.’’ They didn’t do 
that in the Spanish flu days. They 
didn’t do it in the Civil War. But now 
we are going to do it. Come on. 
There were people that died, saying 
things like: ‘‘Live free or die.’’ And 
now, we are going to amend the Con-
stitution with a House rule. That is ri-
diculous. 
If you are going to destroy 40 million 
lives and livelihoods, at least have the 
courage to come here and do it in per-
son. 
You didn’t let the Member from 
Georgia do it years ago. You denied 
that, and I felt like you were right. We 
have to preserve the Constitution, not 
abuse it with a House rule. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
Deborah Pearlstein, a constitutional 
law professor from Cardozo School of 
Law. 
CARDOZO LAW, 
April 16, 2020. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN: Thank you for 
your statement today recommending the im-
plementation of temporary remote voting 
procedures in Congress during this tragic 
pandemic. As a professor of constitutional 
law, and a scholar who has written exten-
sively on separation of powers issues in U.S. 
Government, I believe adopting procedures 
to allow for remote voting under these ex-
traordinary circumstances is not only law-
ful, but essential to the maintenance of our 
constitutional democracy. Recognizing that 
specific procedures for remote voting may 
still be in development, the analysis offered 
here focuses foremost on the broad scope of 
Congress’ constitutional authority to regu-
late its voting procedures. 
As with much else in the Constitution, the 
description the text provides of how Con-
gress is to fulfill its legislative ‘‘duties’’ once 
members have been elected is relatively 
brief. Article I, Section 5 provides that there 
must be ‘‘a Quorum to do business,’’ which 
the Constitution defines as constituting sim-
ply ‘‘a Majority’’ of each House. The same 
Section likewise specifies that each House 
must keep a ‘‘Journal of its Proceedings,’’ 
which must be published ‘‘from time to 
time,’’ and which may, if a sufficient number 
of members desire, reflect how every member 
voted ‘‘on any question.’’ The Constitution 
adds that neither House can adjourn for 
more than three days, or move the session to 
some other place, without the consent of the 
other House—a provision designed to prevent 
a single House from thwarting all congres-
sional action by simply absenting them-
selves indefinitely. 
There can be little question that the Fram-
ers imagined the legislature would do its 
work while assembled in some physical loca-
tion. In 1787 when the Constitution was 
drafted, they could scarcely have imagined 
any other functional way of proceeding. Var-
ious other constitutional provisions thus 
refer to Congress as ‘‘meeting’’ (Art. I, Sec. 
4) or ‘‘assembling’’ (Art. I, Sec. 3), and one 
even provides a mechanism by which mem-
bers can compel ‘‘the Attendance of absent 
Members,’’ (Art. I, Sec. 5) meaning presum-
ably those members not otherwise present 
where Congress is meeting. Of course, none 
of the clauses in which those terms appear 
address how Congress casts or counts its 
votes. Indeed, neither the document itself 
nor any Supreme Court decision defines what 
counts as ‘‘attendance’’ or ‘‘assembling,’’ 
much less how such ‘‘attendance’’ may be 
taken, or such ‘‘assemblage’’ may be accom-
plished. The Constitution equally contains 
no specific requirement of physical presence 
for Members to vote. What the Constitution 
does instead—as the courts have repeatedly 
recognized—is leave it up to each House of 
Congress to ‘‘determine the Rules of its Pro-
ceedings.’’ (Art. I, Sec. 5) As the Supreme 
Court explained in United States v. Ballin, 144 
U.S. 1 (1892), so long as there is a ‘‘reasonable 
relation between the mode or method of pro-
ceeding established by the rule and the re-
sult which is sought to be attained,’’ the 
content of those rules are ‘‘beyond the chal-
lenge of any other body or tribunal.’’ 
Indeed, it is just such constitutional flexi-
bility that has enabled Congress to embrace 
the various informal solutions it has adopted 
over the years to ‘‘do business,’’ including 
relying on members to give ‘‘unanimous con-
sent’’ to a vote even if something less than 
an actual majority of members is physically 
present on the House floor. But while such 
well settled procedures are surely constitu-
tional, they may not always function to ad-
vance the system of majority rule the Con-
stitution so plainly contemplates. As we re-
cently saw when Congress enacted a substan-
tial stimulus bill just last month, it is pos-
sible for one House member, acting alone, to 
single-handedly defeat the manifest pref-
erence of the bipartisan majority by insist-
ing upon an actual demonstration that a ma-
jority of members were ‘‘present’’ (a term 
contained in House Rules, not in the Con-
stitution itself). This forced House leaders to 
make a choice the Constitution cannot be 
understood to compel—between surrendering 
the will of the majority to the demands of a 
single man, or insisting, as they did, that 
Members jeopardize their safety (and thus 
their ability to effectively represent their 
constituents going forward) by defying law-
ful public health restrictions to travel and 
meet in Washington, D.C. 
It is precisely in order to avoid such absurd 
results that Congress has embraced a variety 
of measures throughout its history to adjust 
to developing technologies and changing de-
mands. Thus, for example, current House 
Rules provide that in the event the existing 
electronic voting system is ‘‘inoperable,’’ the 
Speaker may direct the vote to be conducted 
through 
alternative 
methods, 
including 
through the use of ‘‘tellers’’ designated by 
the Speaker to ‘‘record the names of the 
Members voting on each side of the ques-
tion.’’ The teller system was an innovation 
put in place before the current electronic 
system was available, one among key re-
forms designed to strengthen Congress’ abil-
ity to maintain a public record of Members’ 
votes. The particular challenge of ensuring 
that Congress could continue to operate dur-
ing the outbreak of infectious disease was in-
deed the subject of one of Congress’s first ef-
forts to provide for alternative rules of oper-
ation. Following Congress’ return after the 
yellow fever epidemic that devastated the 
then-capital of Philadelphia in the summer 
of 1793, Congress adopted a law providing 
that in circumstances when ‘‘the prevalence 
of contagious sickness’’ made it ‘‘be haz-
ardous to the lives or health of the members 
to meet at the seat of Government,’’ the 
President could ‘‘convene Congress at such 
other place as he may judge proper.’’ If Con-
gress can delegate to the President the 
power to move congressional operations en-
tirely, surely it can reserve for itself the 
lesser power to make whatever far more 
modest amendment to process is required to 
ensure Congress is able to vote in the same, 
extraordinary circumstances. 
Finally, the temporary remote voting pro-
cedures as you have sketched them thus far 
appear to bear an entirely ‘‘reasonable rela-
tion’’ to the goal you aim to achieve, name-
ly, ensuring that Congress preserves the abil-
ity to vote in a way that maintains the insti-
tution’s representative character, protects 
the transparency of its operations, and fairly 
and accurately reflects the will of the Amer-
ican people. By keeping remote voting proce-
dures tied as closely as possible to the exist-
ing system, the proposed approach protects 
Members’ ability to participate in votes re-
gardless of geographic location, technical 
knowledge or means; minimizes the risk of 
foreign or other unlawful interference in the 
vote; and maximizes Congress’s ability to 
fairly reflect the will of the majority of the 
people even during the present crisis. The 
proposed approach contains essential safe-
guards to ensure that Members’ preferences 
are fully and accurately recorded; as you em-
phasized in your recent statement, Members 
designated to submit voting cards on behalf 
of other elected Representatives may only 
act pursuant to the direct, express instruc-
tion of the elected Representative, retaining 
no discretion in carrying out the ministerial 
function they play in the modified voting 
process. As ever, Members remain subject to 
all the disciplinary powers the House pos-
sesses to ensure the appropriate exercise of 
their duties. 
In short, with limited reforms that maxi-
mize Members’ ability to represent the wish-
es of their constituents, while minimizing 
disruption and confusion in House oper-
ations, Congress can succeed in preserving 
the essential constitutional function of the 
legislative branch even amidst an unprece-
dented pandemic. It is a critically important 
initiative in these extraordinary times. 
As ever, I thank you for your efforts, and 
for the opportunity to share my views. 
Sincerely, 
DEBORAH N. PEARLSTEIN, 
Professor of Law. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. In her letter, which 
I strongly recommend all of my col-
leagues should read in full, she says: ‘‘I 
believe adopting procedures to allow 
for remote voting under these extraor-
dinary circumstances is not only law-
ful, but essential to the maintenance of 
our constitutional democracy.’’ 
The Constitution contains no specific 
requirements of physical presence for 
Members to vote. What the Constitu-
tion does instead, as the courts have 
repeatedly recognized, is leave it up to 
each House of Congress to ‘‘determine 
the rules of its proceedings.’’ 
The gentleman refers to the Spanish 
flu. Let me just say that that is not an 
example of something we want to as-
pire to. The Congress was basically 
paralyzed. They couldn’t even get to-
gether to pass a bill to provide more 
doctors to rural areas where people 
were dying. They couldn’t even do 
that. And as a result of Congress’ inac-
tion, more people died in that pan-
demic. So, please, I mean, let’s get real 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
LANGEVIN).

May 15, 2020 
Mr. 
LANGEVIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of this resolu-
tion and commend Chairman MCGOV-
ERN
for overseeing this deliberative 
and well thought-out process. 
The proposed changes to the House 
rules are absolutely necessary to en-
sure that Members of Congress can 
continue our vital legislative and over-
sight functions while protecting public 
health. 
Now, I strongly believe that we need 
a more comprehensive, full e-Congress 
capability to be developed for con-
ducting congressional business in the 
future only in times of emergency if we 
are unable to meet in Washington, D.C. 
However, I also believe that there are 
very real cybersecurity concerns that 
must be addressed before such a system 
will go live. 
In the meantime, this resolution ap-
propriately allows for in-person proxy 
voting during the duration of this pub-
lic health emergency, and it holds open 
the possibility of remote voting if a se-
cure system can be developed and 
verified 
for 
full 
House 
floor 
pro-
ceedings. 
In the meantime, this step, of course, 
cannot be the end of our conversations 
on continuity of Congress. We do need 
a permanent framework that will ac-
count for remote congressional oper-
ations in the event or possibility of 
death or incapacitation of a significant 
number of representatives. 
This is the 21st century. We should be 
able to do this in the future. I look for-
ward to continuing to work with Chair-
man MCGOVERN to address this issue 
going forward. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. JOHN W. ROSE). 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, today, I am standing up for 
those who have stood up for this Na-
tion throughout the current crisis: 
nurses, doctors, farmers, truck drivers, 
food service workers, distribution and 
supply chain workers, the millions of 
Americans who can’t stay home and 
expect our country to survive. 
Haven’t we learned our lesson about 
outsourcing? 
Apparently 
not. 
Now, 
some of the Members of this House 
want to outsource their votes as well. 
I will be voting ‘‘no’’ on this resolu-
tion, and I would encourage those 
ready to hand over their votes to some-
one else to just go ahead and hand over 
their seats to someone else. 
With unemployment the way it is, I 
would bet that there are more than a 
few people back home in your district 
who would gladly accept your $174,000- 
a-year job and find a way to get to 
Washington and push a button. 
I will vote ‘‘no.’’

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I insert in the RECORD letters and 
statements of support for H. Res. 965 
from Chairman PALLONE, Representa-

PETERS. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, May 14, 2020. 
Re H. Res. 965. 
Hon. JAMES P. MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, Committee on Rules, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN: I write to you 
in support of H. Resolution 965, which would 
authorize voting by proxy in the House of 
Representatives and provide for official re-
mote committee proceedings. By tempo-
rarily enabling committees to convene offi-
cial proceedings remotely, this measure en-
sures that the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce can continue to conduct its im-
portant legislative, oversight, and fact-find-
ing work during these extraordinary times. 
I greatly appreciate the work of the House 
Rules Committee under your leadership in 
drafting and putting forward this very im-
portant measure. Our Committee will work 
diligently to ensure that each of our Mem-
bers can participate remotely, to the great-
est extent practicable, from different loca-
tions, at our noticed committee and sub-
committee hearings, markups, depositions 
and other business meetings—some or all of 
which may be virtual in nature. 
Thank you in advance for any further sup-
port you can provide us in the way of Com-
mittee-specific regulations or in addressing 
any questions that surface as we implement 
and put these temporary rules and regula-
tions into practice. 
Respectfully submitted, 
FRANK PALLONE, Jr., 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, May 13, 2020. 
Hon. JIM MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, House Committee on Rules, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN: I write to ex-
press my strong support for proxy voting and 
allowing for flexibility, during these unprec-
edented times. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has created never 
before seen challenges to the operation of 
government and the ability of the House to 
conduct business. Not only are Member’s 
health and safety at risk but the security 
and integrity of the House of Representa-
tives, is as well. I commend you and your 
committee for diligently addressing these 
challenges with integrity and the dedicated 
intent to ensure the House can conduct the 
People’s business in a safe and secure man-
ner. 
This pandemic has drastically changed how 
our communities operate. Many local gov-
ernments and small business have adjusted 
their operations and the House of Represent-
atives must do the same. Again, I commend 
you and your Committee for your work and 
I wholeheartedly support proxy voting and 
allowing for flexibility, during these extreme 
times. 
Sincerely, 
MIKE THOMPSON, 
Member of Congress.

Hon. TOM COLE, 
Ranking Member, House Rules Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
CHAIRMAN
MCGOVERN, RANKING
MEMBER 
COLE, AND
MEMBERS
OF
THE
RULES
COM-
MITTEE: Thank you for this opportunity to 
comment on the very important proposals 
for remote voting. 
Today we face a health crisis unknown in 
our lifetimes—a virus that spreads easily 
among us, that can hide itself as asymp-
tomatic for a time can suddenly turn deadly. 
We have no vaccine to create herd immunity, 
nor a treatment nor cure, nor even enough 
tests to tell us who’s got it and who doesn’t. 
So all we can do to protect ourselves now 
and for the foreseeable future, and to keep 
our health care system from being over-
whelmed, is to separate ourselves. That’s 
how we lower the chance that the virus 
spreads. That’s why governors and mayors 
across the country have ordered us to stay at 
home, to work from home, and to avoid trav-
el if we can. 
That’s exactly what Congress did when we 
passed the CARES Act on March 27th. Our 
leadership from both parties worked to pass 
the bill on unanimous consent, and when one 
member objected, we achieved a quorum 
with members who could travel safely, often 
by driving alone in their cars. We encouraged 
other members to stay away from planes and 
airports and each other. By the way, that 
conveyed to the public that we in Congress 
understood the health challenge—we were 
aware that every time Members of Congress 
travel from across the country to Wash-
ington, DC, we put each other, our staff, Cap-
itol Police and other workers, our families 
and ultimately our constituents at risk of 
infection. 
Since then, conditions in Washington DC 
have become more dangerous—it’s one of our 
nation’s COVID hot spots. It’s high time for 
us to do what we’ve asked—and others have 
ordered—our constituents to do. Figure out 
how to work from home. 
I’ve heard the argument from Senate Lead-
er McConnell and from some Democrats that 
because we ask people on the front lines to 
go to work, that we lawmakers have to show 
up in DC to work. But that argument misses 
the point. Some people—essential workers— 
can’t stay home. If you are a doctor or a 
nurse, or someone who cleans hospital 
rooms, you have to go to the hospital to do 
your job. If you are a grocery clerk or check-
er, you have to go to the grocery store to do 
your job. If you are a fire fighter, or a police 
officer or an EMT, you have to go where peo-
ple are in harm’s way to do your job. 
But if you’re an accountant, or a lawyer, 
or a billing clerk or any other office work-
er—your job is still very important—but 
we’ve ordered you to stay home, because the 
technology available today makes it possible 
for you to do your job from your home. It’s 
not great, but it’s a way Americans have 
stepped up to make it work, and not to be-
come vectors for the spread of this disease. 
We in Congress are not first responders. 
Fundamentally, we have office jobs—very 
important office jobs that a lot of people de-
pend on—but office jobs, consisting of phone 
calls, meetings, and more meetings. Like the 
rest of America, we can have our meetings 
electronically. We should live by the same 
rules we impose on other American office 
workers. 
We are public servants, a concept reflected 
in the joint statement by Speaker Pelosi and 
Leader McConnell to reject the President’s 
offer to supply Congress with test kits. Of 
course, Congress should not take test kits 
from hospital workers, first responders or 
grocery workers. Nor should we continue to 
travel and meet in a way that heightens the 
risk for those same people. We should follow 
the lead of American businesses, nonprofits, 
religious institutions and families who have 
found ways to communicate effectively and 
to make decisions over the phone, or in a va-
riety of computer forums. 
Tradition can be honorable, as it is in Con-
gress. But tradition can be a dinosaur and 
can hurt and slow progress. Some traditions

should never be abandoned. I would never 
give up the opportunity in the ordinary 
course of our business to see you all face to 
face, to work with you in committees, to see 
you twice a day on the House floor, and even 
to grab dinner after work. But in the face of 
this once in a lifetime global pandemic, we 
need to overcome the default position—that 
the way we’ve always done it is the only way 
it can be done. Congress has adapted to jet 
travel, to electronic voting and to making 
our work public on CSPAN. We can adapt to 
remote work. 
It will be difficult, but not as difficult as 
we might imagine. Just look at how the re-
mote skeptics propose we conduct our busi-
ness. We would fly from across the country, 
making connections and taking transpor-
tation from Dulles Airport or Baltimore 
Washington International. Then we would 
isolate ourselves in our DC residences. Then, 
if we live too far to walk or don’t have a car 
in DC, we would take transit or be driven to 
our offices, and we would isolate there. And 
to participate in our committees, we would 
make a phone call from our office in Ray-
burn or Longworth or Cannon to the com-
mittee room. Yet all of us have phones in our 
homes in our districts, and any of us could 
call the committees from there. 
We’ve also heard that in person committee 
meetings will take up a tremendous amount 
of physical space. For our larger committees, 
like Transportation and Infrastructure or 
Armed Services, only the House chamber is 
big enough. If all of our committees were to 
meet in person, it would be impossible for 
them to meet at the same times. Remote 
participation is probably the only practical 
way to allow all committees to function at 
the same time, and thereby for all members 
to participate in the legislative process on 
behalf or their millions of constituents. 
Remote voting is not cowardice. It’s lead-
ership. In the face of this pandemic, getting 
Congress to work remotely is an example for 
the rest of the country that meets this mo-
ment. Let us live by the same rules we im-
pose on our fellow citizens. Let’s find a way 
that allows all of our constituents to have a 
voice. Let’s show by our action that we our-
selves take this threat seriously. 
I thank you for your leadership in this dif-
ficult moment. 
Sincerely, 
SCOTT H. PETERS, 
Member of Congress. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad that the gentleman who pre-
viously spoke says he wants to extend 
it for nurses, doctors, and teachers. He 
has a chance to do that in the next bill 
we are going talk about because there 
is money in there to provide them 
more assistance in terms of testing and 
treatment and tracing and more money 
there for PPE. But my guess is the gen-
tleman is going to vote ‘‘no’’ on that. 
The same people who are out here 
talking about being brave and standing 
up with our first responders are the 
same people whose leader has said that 
his proposal is to prioritize Members of 
Congress ahead of all of our constitu-
ents in terms of testing so we can oper-
ate here. I don’t want to have anything 
to do with that. My constituents who 
are on the front lines, the doctors, the 
nurses, the first responders deserve to 
be tested before anybody in this House. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs. 
TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, this 
public health crisis has been dev-
astating. Nearly 1.5 million Americans 
have contracted COVID–19 and, trag-
ically, more than 85,000 people have 
died. 
We have asked small business owners 
and workers in our districts to close up 
shop and stay home for months to do 
their part to slow the spread of this 
virus. 
Across the country, workplaces are 
innovating and figuring out how to op-
erate while keeping pace with com-
monsense public health guidelines. 
Like them, Congress has an obliga-
tion to do the same. This moment re-
quires us to lead by example, to show 
that in the face of a highly infectious 
disease we can change how we do busi-
ness and still get our constituents the 
much-needed relief they desperately 
need, while also conducting proper 
oversight. 
I support this rule change to tempo-
rarily allow committees to conduct 
meetings remotely and to provide my 
colleagues with the opportunity to 
make their constituents’ voices heard. 
This is the 21st century. We have an 
opportunity to show that we can use 
the tools at our disposal to continue 
congressional operations at full capac-
ity while also practicing what we 
preach. 
This is common sense, and I would 
urge my colleagues to support this 
change as well. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY), my very good friend. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Oklahoma for yielding. 
I just ask my colleagues here: What 
are we doing? We have 40 million Amer-
icans out of work. We have serious 
problems we have got to address, and 
we are going to pass a bill tonight that 
is a clear political bill filled with polit-
ical promises from my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle that has no 
chance of being passed in its current 
form. And why aren’t we debating and 
doing the job of this body? We have no 
debate. 
My friend from Maryland, Chairman 
RASKIN, we served together working to 
try to protect the Constitution, and he 
says that we have this rule in here for 
a quorum can be two people. I agree, 
that is a problem. 
I don’t care who is in charge of this 
body. We shouldn’t operate that way. 
The American people want us to do our 
job and debate and work. 
The Constitution is pretty clear 
about what constitutes a quorum. You 
can trot out various words from some 
professors around the country that say 
otherwise, but a quorum means pres-
ence. We should be here debating. It 
matters. It matters that we look each 
other in the eye. It matters that we are 
here talking to each other when there 
are 40 million Americans without jobs 
while we sit here in Congress and don’t 
do ours? 
We are not doing our job. While 
truckers carry food products, while 
people go to grocery stores, while first 
responders do their job, why aren’t we 
doing ours? I would posit that the Con-
stitution contemplates our physically 
being here looking each other in the 
eye to do our job. 
If we want to have debates about 
committee work being remote or vir-
tual, okay, but the actual act of vot-
ing, our solemn duty to represent hun-
dreds of thousands of people who put 
their trust in us to do our job, we are 
supposed to be here. We are supposed to 
work with each other. 
I have got a bipartisan bill right now 
that would help solve the problems, the 
PPP Flexibility Act, with my friend 
DEAN PHILLIPS from Minnesota. Let’s 
debate and vote on it. Let’s offer 
amendments. Let’s actually have a de-
bate in this body. 
It is supposed to be the people’s 
House—the people’s House. It is our 
job, Mr. Speaker. This is not constitu-
tional. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The gentleman will be happy to know 
he will have 2 hours of debate on how 
to help our constituents. I have a feel-
ing he is going to vote ‘‘no.’’ He is 
going to vote ‘‘no’’ to help our teach-
ers, our first responders. He is going to 
vote ‘‘no’’ to help States, cities, and 
towns. That is unfortunate, but we are 
going to move it forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I insert in the RECORD 
letters and statements of support for 
H. Res. 965 from Representative KIL-
DEE, Representative JEFFRIES, and Rep-
resentative POCAN. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, May 13, 2020. 
Hon. JIM MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, Committee on Rules, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. TOM COLE, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Rules, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN
AND RANKING 
MEMBER COLE: We write today in strong sup-
port of the H. Res. 965, which temporarily 
implements remote voting in the full U.S. 
House of Representatives and remote com-
mittee proceedings during this public health 
emergency due to the coronavirus. 
Members of Congress must continue to 
faithfully and safely execute the duties of 
our office while acting in accordance with 
the social distancing guidelines outlined by 
medical experts. The suggested temporary 
rules would allow for Members to proxy vote 
on behalf of those Members who cannot safe-
ly travel to Washington, D.C. This proposed 
proxy voting system strictly governs the 
rules where a remote Member would send a 
letter to the Clerk designating a proxy. 
Members may serve as a designated proxy for 
up to ten Members and must receive exact 
written instruction on each vote. While 
there is no precedent on the House Floor for 
proxy voting, there is precedent in House 
Committees, where it was in place until the 
104th Congress. 
The implementation of H. Res. 965 would 
allow committees to hold virtual hearings, 
markups, and depositions enabling Members 
to perform vital oversight, conduct fact find-
ing and bring legislation to the Floor. Espe-
cially during this national emergency, Con-
gress must continue to do the work of Amer-
ican people, especially overseeing the tril-
lions of dollars allocated by the federal gov-
ernment so far to combat the pandemic.

Members also have the responsibility to 
model compliance with the guidelines rec-
ommended by the leading science and health 
experts without dereliction of our duties. 
Proxy voting allows for Members to be en-
gaged in work at the Capitol while ensuring 
their safety and those in their communities. 
As the Congress continues to find innovate 
ways to remain in service of the American 
people, I am supportive of the provision in H. 
Res. 965 that will direct the Committee on 
House Administration to study the use of 
technology to allow Members to vote re-
motely in the House. After certification has 
been completed determining secure and oper-
able technology for remote voting, the Rules 
Committee would issue guidance and regula-
tions for implementation that can be author-
ized by the Speaker to allow Members to 
cast their votes remotely during the time pe-
riod covered by the resolution. 
We appreciate your hard work on this and 
the solicitation of advice and ideas from 
Members for many weeks, including mem-
bers of both parties. It is our hope that these 
rules are only necessary for a short period of 
time and the House of Representatives can 
return to their normal functions in a safe 
manner to help families and workers im-
pacted by this terrible health crisis.

Hon. JAMES P. MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, Committee on Rules, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN: Thank you for 
your ongoing leadership during this time of 
crisis. Please see my statement below in sup-
port of remote voting by proxy: 
As the House continues its work during 
this trying time, we must have a safe, secure 
and reliable way of conducting our most es-
sential duty—passing legislation on behalf of 
the American people. Remote voting by 
proxy offers a temporary, commonsense solu-
tion that will allow the House to operate 
safely and effectively during this crisis. The 
proposal crafted by Chairman McGovern al-
lows committees to continue their important 
work remotely, while also providing Mem-
bers with the ability to vote on legislation 
without the threat of hacking or undue in-
fluence from bad actors. I stand in strong 
support of the proposal and believe it is the 
best path forward as we continue to confront 
this pandemic. 
Best, 
CONGRESSMAN HAKEEM JEFFRIES, 
Chairman, House Democratic Caucus. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, May 14, 2020. 
Hon. JIM MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, House Rules Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN: I write in sup-
port of efforts to ensure Members of Con-
gress are able to vote on essential legislation 
while not physically present in Washington, 
D.C. during the coronavirus pandemic. Nu-
merous states, including the Wisconsin Leg-
islature, and other nations, including the 
British Parliament, have already instituted 
successful virtual legislative meeting proce-
dures. 
While I intend to be physically present and 
voting this week, I know several of our col-
leagues will be unable to vote in person due 
to health or travel difficulties. Foreseeing 
this eventuality, the Congressional Progres-
sive Caucus issued a Whip Question to its 
Members several weeks ago to measure sup-
port for instituting virtual voting in the 
House of Representatives. Responses from 
the Caucus were overwhelmingly in support. 
I support remote voting efforts in Congress 
in whatever form they may take, and plan to 
vote in favor of implementing legislation 
when it is presented to the full U.S. House of 
Representatives. I thank you for your friend-
ship and look forward to continuing to work 
together on this and other matters. 
Sincerely, 
MARK POCAN, 
Member of Congress, 
Co-Chair, Progressive Caucus. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
We cannot do and cannot do—and 
how many times can I say it?—we can-
not stand here and do nothing. 
The Constitution has no provision 
that prohibits this body from doing 
something to avoid a catastrophe of 
not being able to govern this Nation. 
My friends who were here during the 
heinous tragedy of 9/11 remember that 
we had a continuity committee and put 
in a provision of the rules under Repub-
lican leadership of what would con-
stitute a quorum. 
But let me say this, my friends. No 
one is telling you not to be present, but 
what it does say is that we are pre-
pared, we will not panic. We are pre-
pared in case a catastrophic resurgence 
of COVID–19 comes in the fall as the 
scientists have said. 
And, no, no proxy is going to domi-
nate this floor. A proxy is directed by 
the Member, and they must specifi-
cally, on each vote, tell you what to 
do. Those directions are specific. 
At the same time, no Member is pro-
hibited, as I said, from coming to this 
floor. Eleanor Roosevelt said: ‘‘One 
thing I believe profoundly: We make 
our own history.’’ That is what we are 
doing. We are making our history so 
that we can serve the American public. 
Do you think truck drivers and first 
responders want us to collapse and not 
pass a bill that provides for them so 
they will not be furloughed and fired? 
They want us to do our job. 
Thomas Paine said, ‘‘times that try 
men’s souls.’’ This is a constitutional 
process. It allows for us to proceed and 
govern this Nation without an inter-
ruption. 
We have seen Members who are 
COVID–19 positive. It can happen to a 
predominant number of Members. How, 
then, will we respond? We need to re-
spond with the exact idea that has been 
promoted and put forward in this reso-
lution. 
Let me also acknowledge the fact 
that 36 million have filed for unem-
ployment; 85,000 have died. It is pro-
jected 134,000 will die. That is why we 
have done prison dollars. That is why 
we put the heroes money in so that we 
don’t have people seeking to eat. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article entitled ‘‘City Staring Down 
$169 Million Budget Gap’’ and an arti-
cle from the Houston Chronicle enti-
tled ‘‘Universal testing for coronavirus 
is a national security issue. 
[From houstonchronicle.com, May 13, 2020] 
CITY STARING DOWN $169M BUDGET GAP 
(By Jasper Scherer and Dylan McGuinness) 
Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, facing 
an economy hammered by the coronavirus 
pandemic and collapsing oil prices, on Tues-
day proposed to close an upcoming budget 
gap by furloughing about 3,000 municipal 
workers, deferring all police cadet classes 
and exhausting the city’s entire $20 million 
‘‘rainy day’’ fund. 
The proposals are in response to an esti-
mated $169 million revenue shortfall for the 
fiscal year that begins July 1. 
Emptying the rainy day fund ‘‘leaves the 
city in a precarious state for the upcoming 
hurricane season,’’ the mayor acknowledged 
in a message to city council members that 
accompanied his budget plan. The account 
hold money in reserve for emergency situa-
tions, such as cash flow shortages and major 
disasters. 
The city had just recently replenished the 
fund after using all $20 million in the wake 
of Hurricane Harvey. It will not have that 
option if a storm hits Houston this year. 
‘‘The dollars from the economic stabiliza-
tion fund are gone,’’ Turner said. ‘‘There is 
no rainy day fund.’’ 
Under Turner’s plan, the city also would 
draw $83 million from its cash reserves to 
balance the budget. 
The city’s tax- and fee-supported general 
fund, which covers most basic city oper-
ations, would spend $2.53 billion under Turn-
er’s plan, a decrease of about 1 percent from 
the current budget. Despite the narrow 
spending cut, the city would be left with a 
general fund balance that dips below the 
amount required by city ordinance. 
Turner said the rule makes an exception 
‘‘in the event of economic instability beyond 
the city’s control.’’ 
Houston is expected to lose nearly $100 mil-
lion in sales tax revenue during current fis-
cal year and the one beginning in July, due 
in part to a precipitous drop in oil prices, 
along with the closure of bars, restaurants 
and other businesses during the pandemic. 
The overall city budget, including services 
that are funded by dedicated fees and utility 
charges, is $5.1 billion, a slight increase from 
the current budget. 
The proposed spending plan, which is sub-
ject to approval by city council, only says 
that the city would furlough ‘‘thousands of 
municipal employees.’’ At a news conference 
Tuesday, Turner said the number would be 
around 3,000 of the city’s nearly 21,000 em-
ployees. The workers would forego 10 days of 
paying the city roughly $7 million. 
Turner did not specify which departments 
would be required to send workers home 
without pay, though he said the city would 
not place anyone on furlough from the po-
lice, fire and solid waste management de-
partments. 
The city will implement any cuts until the 
new fiscal year begins July 1, Turner said. 
The bulk of the city’s operating budget is 
devoted to paying roughly 5,200 police offi-
cers and nearly 3,800 firefighters. Public safe-
ty would account for 59 percent of the gen-

about 90 percent of the police and fire de-

Both departments would see modest in-
creases of about 2 percent in spending under 
Turner’s plan, with police climbing to $930.6 
million and the fire department to $516.9 mil-
lion.

Works ($4.5 million, or 14.3 percent of its 
budget); Parks and Recreation ($10.4 million, 
13 percent); and Solid Waste ($4.5 million, 4.8 
percent). 
Turner’s budget plan could undergo signifi-
cant changes, the mayor said Tuesday, if 
Congress allows local governments to spend 
COVID–19 stimulus funds to make up for lost 
tax revenue. Houston received $404 million 
from the roughly $2 trillion coronavirus 
stimulus package and for now is barred from 
spending it on previously budgeted expenses, 
though city officials may identify some pub-
lic safety expenses related to the pandemic 
that can be covered with federal aid, Turner 
said. 
‘‘More than likely you will see additional 
dollars flowing into this budget in the next 
couple of weeks,’’ Turner said. 
The mayor already is proposing to use fed-
eral COVID–19 funds to cover the city’s 
roughly $10 million annual contract with the 
Houston Zoo, which is paid out of the gen-
eral fund. Turner said he also has directed 
the fire and police chiefs to determine which 
of their recent operations were devoted to 
COVID–19—spending that could be eligible 
for federal aid. 
Democratic 
lawmakers 
in 
Washington, 
D.C., also have sought more money for state 
and local governments in Congress’ next 
stimulus package, though such plans have 
met skepticism in GPO ranks. 
Even if Congress gives Houston officials 
more flexibility to spend the funds, Turner 
said the $404 million will not cover all the 
city’s COVID–19 expenses and lost revenue. 
The city already is projected to spend about 
$200 million on testing, contact tracing and 
other health expenses, Turner said, while 
putting additional funds toward rental as-
sistance and programs to help homeless 
Houstonians. 
‘‘The $404 (million), though it seems like a 
big number, it’s not big at all considering 
the needs that exist,’’ Turner said. ‘‘Just be-
cause we may be able to pull dollars from 
what we have received, it doesn’t mean that 
there will be sufficient dollars to do it.’’ 
If the federal government does provide 
more money, Turner said his first priority 
would be to reinstate the police cadet class-
es, which would cost $14 million. Next on the 
list would be eliminating furloughs and re-
filling the city’s reserves. 
Cities across the country already have 
slashed large chunks of their payrolls, plac-
ing workers on furlough, laying off employ-
ees and implementing hiring freezes. As 
many as 1 million municipal workers may be 
laid off or placed on furlough, according to 
the National League of Cities.

UNIVERSAL TESTING FOR CORONAVIRUS IS A 
NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE 
(By Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee) 
Most Americans are not fully aware how 
up to now the United States has been so ef-
fective at preventing, combating, and miti-
gating outbreaks of infectious disease. We 
have been able to do this because of the ex-
pertise and responsiveness of superb institu-
tions, 
independent 
agencies 
and 
offices 
throughout the federal government that ef-
fectively dealt with Ebola, H1N1, Zika, SARS 
and MERS. 
I was alarmed by news reports in late De-
cember 2019 of a new or novel coronavirus. 
By January, the machinery of government 
with its unparalleled ability to project power 
globally, galvanize our allies, and coordinate 
peer competitors in the field of science and 
technology should have activated to provide 
all needed resources and assistance to China 
to contain the disease. This was not a China 
problem; it was a global threat requiring a 
global response. 
So early the next month, on Feb. 10, I held 
a press conference to raise public awareness 
on the emerging threat posed. Two weeks 
later, on Feb. 24, I called another press con-
ference to urge that testing be given the 
highest priority in battling the spread of the 
new coronavirus and the sickness it causes 
called COVID–19. And I continue to cham-
pion testing as the tool that federal, state, 
tribal and territorial governments must em-
brace to support our COVID–19 economic re-
covery. 
We are at the beginning of May and testing 
is still urgently needed. There cannot be fur-
ther delay in acting. If we cannot see 
COVID–19 there is no way to stop it. If we do 
not dramatically increase testing, we will re-
main prisoners of COVID–19 until we have a 
vaccine widely available, which is not ex-
pected to occur until early 2021. 
As the nation does battle with COVID–19 it 
is not the role of public policy makers to de-
termine acceptable losses of civilian lives. 
Although in military battles commanders 
must calculate acceptable losses as part of 
battle plans, none of these calculations are 
based on the intentional sacrifice of lives. 
Any commander thought to have unneces-
sarily cost the lives of soldiers or civilians 
through their actions or decisions would face 
severe consequences. If the decisions are not 
driven by public health, but by economic in-
terest, this is the wrong calculation. The 
economic injury caused by COVID–19 is be-
cause there has been and continues to be in-
sufficient testing to check its spread. 
Decisions to open state economies seem to 
want to place responsibility upon small busi-
ness owners who decide to reopen without 
making clear what the consequences may be 
to them if even one case of COVID–19 occurs 
among their employees or customers. 
For this reason, I have partnered with 
Houston hospitals, local public health agen-
cies, local businesses and international cor-
porations to promote the provision of com-
munity-based COVID–19 testing sites to as-
sist in this critical first step in stopping 
COVID–19’s unchecked spread in local com-
munities. 
The economic and health security of the 
nation hinges on getting testing in every 
community so that we can shine a light on 
where COVID–19 is and where it is not 
present. The lack of testing early on and the 
continued lack of testing is costing trillions 
in lost economic output and it will continue 
to cost much more as we struggle to save 
lives through social distancing and providing 
adequate universal access to COVID–19 med-
ical treatment, equipment and PPE to pro-
tect medical personnel as well as essential 
workers. 
The United States needs to meet or exceed 
the recovery rate of other nations around 
the globe so that our national economy can 
benefit as the global economy recovers. This 
will happen once we demonstrate that our 
nation can do the hard work of imple-
menting successful testing, contact tracing 
and social distance programs. Other nations 
including our own will not tolerate reinfec-
tions once they are under control because a 
COVID–19 infection anywhere is a threat to 
people living everywhere. 
The virus that causes COVID–19 is less 
than five months old and it has rocked the 
world 
with 
its 
arrival. 
If 
this 
new 
coronavirus is under active transmission in 
communities, it could continue to evolve. 
This is the reason we must do the hard job of 
stopping this virus and do it sooner than 
later. 
There are six actions that can be taken be-
fore the end of the summer to make it pos-
sible for children to return to school in the 
fall: 
1. The president should use the Defense 
Production Act to produce enough of the 
COVID–19 15-minute test recently approved 
by the FDA for use in high risk areas like 
urban, rural, and Native American commu-
nities and environment such as food proc-
essing, warehouses, production lines or fac-
tories; 
2. Target COVID–19 pandemic aid to com-
munities based upon mortality not just 
known infections; 
3. Equip health care professionals with 
enough PPE to provide home health visits to 
the elderly who will need more engagement 
than telemedicine can provide to ensure 
their health and welfare; 
4. Provide 100 percent paid medical leave 
for persons who themselves or someone in 
their household have one or more of the 
known risk factors that make COVID–19 a 
deadly threat; 
5. Implement robust contact tracing efforts 
to ensure that every infection is tracked and 
those who may have been infected are identi-
fied; and 
6. Prepare contingencies to address public 
emergencies such as hurricanes, tornadoes 
and wildfires in conjunction with COVID–19 
for known seasonal high-risk disaster areas 
of the nation, such as along the Gulf Coast, 
the Mid-Atlantic, Tornado Alley and fire- 
prone California and the Caribbean. 
A greater commitment to universal testing 
will save the lives of hundreds of thousands 
of people and cost far less than the economic 
stimulus that is very necessary as the econ-
omy stagnates under the weight of COVID–19 
stay at home orders and quarantines. A 
misstep at this point can have dire con-
sequences for the lives of families, their chil-
dren and the elderly; and result in an even 
deeper impact on the local, state and na-
tional economy. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we 
need rural, city, local, and State fund-
ing and $15 million in rental assistance. 
We need to do this resolution and pass 
the HEROES legislation now. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, and on Home-
land Security, and the Budget, I rise in strong 
support of H. Res. 965, which authorizes the 
Speaker, in consultation with the Minority 
Leader, to temporarily implement remote com-
mittee proceedings and remote voting in the 
House when she has been notified by the Ser-
geant-at-Arms, in consultation with the Attend-
ing Physician, of a public health emergency 
due to the coronavirus. 
When exercised, that authority lasts for 45 
days but can be extended if the public health 
emergency persists or there is a resurgence. 
Mr. Speaker, in the 231 years since the first 
Congress met in New York City on March 4, 
1789, our nation has undergone and over-
come many crises and challenges, from the 
presence of British troops in the capital city 
during the War of 1812, to the Civil War, 
World Wars I and II, the Spanish Flu of 1918, 
the Great Depression, and the Great Reces-
sion of 2008. 
Through it all, Americans have persevered 
and America has flourished because Ameri-
cans do not give up hope or give in to despair. 
Instead of cursing the darkness, we light 
candles. 
Our national history is one of pride in our 
democracy, in a government of, for, and by 
the people, and our willingness to sacrifice to 
keep it and our ability to adapt to changing 
times to sustain it. 
Mr. Speaker, we are now in the midst of 
one of those ‘times that try men’s souls,’ as 
Thomas Paine put it two centuries ago. 
As of yesterday, there were at minimum 
4,405,688 cases of COVID–19 across the

globe and 1,400,500 in the United States, re-
sulting in more than 300,000 deaths worldwide 
and more than 84,985 in the United States. 
With just 4 percent of the world’s population, 
the United States has one-third of the total 
COVID–19 cases and nearly 30 percent of 
deaths from COVID–19 globally. 
Mr. Speaker, the necessary measures taken 
to slow the pandemic and ’flatten the curve’ so 
as not to overwhelm the nation’s health care 
system has also delivered a severe shock to 
economic activity in the United States. 
Yesterday, the Department of Labor re-
ported that the number of first-time unemploy-
ment insurance claims exceeded 2.85 million, 
bring the total number of unemployed to 36 
million, shattering by orders of magnitude all 
previous marks. 
So, Mr Speaker, it is essential that this Con-
gress act and act now to put in place measure 
that will address the public health crisis, stem 
the economic onslaught, and ameliorate the 
suffering and deprivation of individuals and 
communities. 
But requires that we first ensure that the 
Congress discharge the duties delegated it 
under the Constitution in a way that does not 
needlessly endanger Members, their staff, or 
any of the thousands of Capitol Hill personnel. 
That is the purpose and intent of H. Res. 
965; to allow Members from across the coun-
try to continue legislating on behalf of the 
American people while adhering to the advice 
of medical experts and protecting public 
health. 
First, the resolution authorizes remote com-
mittee proceedings during the pandemic. 
During the public health emergency period, 
committees are authorized to hold virtual hear-
ings, markups, and depositions so Members 
can perform oversight, conduct fact-finding, 
and prepare legislation for the House floor. 
Committee chairs can choose to hold en-
tirely virtual proceedings, with Members par-
ticipating from any location, or they can hold 
proceedings in the hearing room with some 
Members participating remotely. 
Members participating remotely will count 
towards a quorum and be able to vote. 
Committees are required to use software 
platforms approved by the Chief Administrative 
Officer (CAO) for remote participation. 
Second, H. Res. 965 authorizes and imple-
ments procedures for remote voting on the 
House floor during the pandemic. 
Specifically, the resolution allows for remote 
voting by proxy on the House Floor during the 
public health emergency period. 
All Members voting remotely will be counted 
toward a quorum. 
After sending a letter to the Clerk desig-
nating a proxy, Members are permitted to vote 
remotely on any vote. 
Members voting remotely will be given 24- 
hours’ notice before any final passage vote to 
ensure they can secure a proxy if they have 
not yet designated one. 
Mr. Speaker, it is important to emphasize 
that this is not a general proxy, rather proxies 
must receive exact written instruction from the 
Member voting by proxy on each vote and are 
required to follow that instruction precisely. 
To ensure transparency, a list of designated 
proxies will be posted on the Clerk’s website 
and a list of Members voting remotely will be 
printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD fol-
lowing each vote. 
In addition, Members’ votes will be read 
aloud during the vote. 
Additionally, no Member can serve as a 
designated proxy for more than ten Members. 
Finally, the resolution provides for remote 
voting through technology during the pan-
demic, after a system is developed and cer-
tified. 
The resolution directs the chair of the House 
Administration Committee to study the feasi-
bility of using technology to vote remotely in 
the House, and to provide certification upon a 
determination that there is operable and se-
cure technology for remote voting. 
After the certification, the chair of the Rules 
Committee is directed to issue regulations on 
the implementation of remote voting and the 
Speaker is then authorized to notify the House 
that Members may cast their votes remotely 
during the public health emergency period 
covered by the resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, in this moment of national cri-
sis Americans are looking to their government 
to be there for them and enact policies and 
take action that will see us through this pan-
demic as safely and as quickly as possible. 
To ensure that the House, the first branch of 
the co-equal but preeminent body vested by 
Article I with the power to investigate, legis-
late, and appropriate in further of the general 
welfare and national defense, remains able to 
discharge its constitutional duty, I urge all 
Members to join me in voting to pass H. Res. 
965. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE), my good friend 
and former Rules Committee member. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Article I, section 5 of the United 
States Constitution states that only a 
majority can constitute a quorum in 
order to do the business of the people’s 
House. As a former member of the 
House Rules Committee, I have a deep 
appreciation and a commitment to the 
precedence and procedures of this hal-
lowed body. 
But under this democratic proxy vot-
ing scheme before us today, only 22 
House Democrats would need to be 
present in this Chamber to pass any 
and every single bill moving forward. 
This is a forced consolidation of power 
to a select few insiders, and it simply 
does not reflect the values of our con-
stitution, our history, and our Nation. 
The constituents of my Washington’s 
Fourth Congressional District did not 
vote for their Representative to simply 
defer to a proxy and shirk the duties of 
serving as a U.S. Representative. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people de-
serve more, and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this terribly ill-advised and unconsti-
tutional resolution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I insert in the RECORD an April 14 AP 
news article entitled, ‘‘Wisconsin As-
sembly OKs Virus Bill in First Virtual 
Session.’’ 
[From the Associated Press, April 14, 2020] 
WISCONSIN ASSEMBLY OKS VIRUS BILL IN 
FIRST VIRTUAL SESSION 
(By Todd Richmond) 
MADISON, WIS. (AP).—The Wisconsin As-
sembly overwhelmingly approved a sweeping 
coronavirus relief bill Tuesday during a vir-
tual session, the first time state lawmakers 
have gathered since the pandemic began in 
the United States. 
The session took place in the Assembly 
chamber as usual, but due to concerns about 
spreading the virus nearly two-thirds of the 
body’s 99 members attended via video-
conference. The Senate was to hold a similar 
session on Wednesday to send the bill on to 
Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. 
It marked the first time in Wisconsin’s 172– 
year history that lawmakers convened a ses-
sion with members participating remotely. 
Legislative rules require lawmakers to be 
present to debate and vote on bills but a 2009 
law allows for virtual sessions during disas-
ters. 
One section of the Assembly gallery was 
open to the public, with only 14 seats avail-
able and each spread out 6 feet apart. Public 
seating, also 6 feet apart, was available in 
the Capitol rotunda with speakers and TVs 
tuned to WisEye, the Legislature’s version of 
C-SPAN. Two large TV screens, tuned to 
Skype, were set up on the Assembly chamber 
floor. About 35 members sat in the chamber, 
all spaced several seats apart. Many rows 
were empty. Several pages wore face masks, 
as did Assembly Minority Leader GORDON 
HINTZ. He was the only Democrat on the 
floor. 
The session got off to a slow start as Chief 
Clerk Pat Fuller tried to call the roll. Law-
makers joined from their kitchens, Capitol 
offices and home offices and struggled to 
unmute themselves and register their at-
tendance before Fuller moved on to the next 
legislator. Some seemed amused at the 
setup, smiling and waving to the camera. 
Others initially appeared befuddled, appar-
ently unable to hear or to figure out how to 
be heard. Roll call votes took minutes as 
Fuller asked each lawmaker individually for 
his or her vote. In a normal world voting is 
almost instantaneous as lawmakers signal 
their votes from their seats with the touch 
of a button. 
Moments before adjourning for a 10–minute 
receess, Speaker Pro Tempore Tyler August 
warned lawmakers not to touch their laptops 
during the break because if they discon-
nected themselves they wouldn’t be able to 
log back in. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, 
one of the few legislators on the floor, said 
setting up the virtual session was ‘‘ex-
tremely challenging’’ and he hoped the As-
sembly would never have to meet that way 
again. 
The process smoothed out as the session 
progressed. The chamber ended up approving 
the bill 97–2. 
The legislation largely ensures that Wis-
consin can capture the $2.3 billion coming to 
the state under the federal stimulus bill, in-
cluding higher Medicaid payments and un-
employment 
benefits. 
The 
Legislature’s 
budget committee would be allowed to allo-
cate up to $75 million in funding during the 
public health emergency and up to 90 days 
after it ends. 
The measure also would waive the state’s 
one-week waiting period to receive unem-
ployment for anyone who applies between 
March and Feb. 7, 2021; ban certain insurers 
from 
prohibiting 
coverage 
based 
on 
a 
COVID–19 
diagnosis; 
ease 
licensing 
and 
credentialing for health care workers; reduce 
nurse 
training 
hour 
requirements; 
and 
render health providers immune from civil 
liability for services provided during the 
pandemic. Local municipalities also could 
choose to defer their residents’ property tax 
payments. 
Evers’ administration has been working 
closely with Vos and Senate Majority Leader 
Scott Fitzgerald on the bill. The governor 
did not say Monday whether he supported 
the bill, saying he had not reviewed it, but

he hoped it wouldn’t be the last action taken 
by the Legislature to offer aid during the 
pandemic. 
Nineteen states had allocated more than $3 
billion to respond to the pandemic as of Fri-
day, according to the National Conference of 
State Legislatures and the Wisconsin Policy 
Forum. 
As of Tuesday, COVID–19 had killed 170 
people in Wisconsin and infected more than 
3,500. Among those who contracted the virus 
and recovered is Democratic state Rep. 
David Bowen, of Milwaukee. 
Vos and Hintz were the only lawmakers 
who spoke about the bill prior to the vote. 
Hintz said the Legislature should be pre-
pared to return to work on further legisla-
tion that helps Evers deal with the pan-
demic. 
‘‘We should make sure we are listening, en-
abling and supporting and giving (the Evers 
administration) the flexibility to manage 
this crisis,’’ he said. ‘‘I refuse to admit this 
is all we can do as a state.’’ 
But Vos cautioned against giving Evers 
‘‘blank checks’’ as the virus wreaks ‘‘eco-
nomic carnage’’ on the state’s finances. He 
said he was disappointed the bill didn’t 
freeze state spending in fiscal year 2020–21 
and lamented that state workers will still 
get an automatic 2% raise. 
‘‘We have to be just like a family were the 
credit card use is limited,’’ Vos said. ‘‘Think 
before we spend. Make investments that are 
wise but not wanting.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
sert in the RECORD a May 6 Boston 
Globe article entitled, ‘‘For the First 
Time in 400 Years, Mass. Lawmakers 
Vote Remotely.’’ 
[From the Boston Globe, May 6, 2020] 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 400 YEARS, MASS. 
LAWMAKERS VOTE REMOTELY 
(By Matt Stout) 
With lawmakers dialing in from across the 
state, the Massachusetts House of Represent-
atives on Wednesday voted remotely for the 
first time in the body’s near 400-year history, 
and officially relaunched formal lawmaking 
amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
The historic session, which lasted roughly 
an hour, included one substantive vote: a 
157–0 roll call approving a bill that would 
allow the state to borrow billions of dollars 
over the next eight weeks to help pay its 
bills. 
It came amid a surreal scene. As a smat-
tering of people, including House Speaker 
Robert A. DeLeo, held court in a mostly 
empty chamber, dozens of representatives 
called in to a network of conference call 
lines, where other lawmakers gathered and 
recorded their votes. 
A livestream offered a view inside, showing 
a half-circle of stanchions surrounding the 
rostrum to separate DeLeo, House clerk 
Steve T. James, a court officer, and others— 
all of whom were wearing masks—from the 
rows of seats where representatives would 
otherwise be stationed. 
Where they actually were ran the gamut. 
Representative William Driscoll Jr., a Mil-
ton Democrat, tweeted a photo from his car 
parked in the Blue Hills Reservation, the 
livestream playing from a phone propped up 
on his dashboard. Representative Tram T. 
Nguyen shared a picture of her logged in 
from a kitchen countertop. Representative 
Susannah Whipps showed off a plate of vege-
tables on her Twitter feed. 
House leaders discussed for weeks how to 
relaunch formal legislative sessions amid the 
spread of COVID–19, after spending the bet-
ter part of two months moving bills through 
informal gatherings with no debate and 
where a single ‘‘no’’ vote could stall legisla-
tion. 
The set of emergency rules was approved 
Monday, but only after a heated, partisan 
dispute that started when House minority 
leader Bradley H. Jones blocked the rules 
package, arguing that it effectively limited 
how often most representatives would be al-
lowed to speak. 
He had accused DeLeo of using the crisis to 
‘‘achieve more power,’’ while the Winthrop 
Democrat lashed out at what he called the 
Republicans’ ‘‘recklessness and fiscal irre-
sponsibility.’’ (The House couldn’t pass the 
borrowing bill unless the House held a for-
mal vote.) 
Jones and DeLeo ultimately agreed to a re-
vision this week that allows some Repub-
licans, including Jones, more chances to 
speak during legislative debates under the 
new rules, which could remain in effect until 
as late as January. 
Such back-and-forth was largely absent 
from Wednesday’s otherwise smooth session, 
though it included some awkward but harm-
less hiccups as lawmakers adjusted to their 
new remote reality. 
Shortly before DeLeo opened the session, a 
voice fluttered through on the livestream. 
‘‘Hello?’’ a lawmaker asked. 
Another voice quickly cut in, informing 
him he had accidentally called a number 
connected to a microphone within the cham-
ber. ‘‘You’re actually dialed into the rostrum 
line,’’ he was told. 
Later, when Representative Denise Garlick 
called in to speak on the borrowing bill, a de-
layed feedback from the session was audible 
over the livestream—trailing the chamber by 
several moments and causing Garlick to 
pause for several moments after DeLeo rec-
ognized her. 
When she wrapped her testimony, a long 
pause again settled over the line, and the 
phrase ‘‘[Audio difficulties]’’ popped up on 
the livestream feed. 
‘‘Is the representative finished with her re-
marks?’’ DeLeo eventually asked. 
‘‘Yes,’’ Garlick said. 
Representative Harold P. Naughton was 
the only lawmaker not to cast a vote, but 
the Clinton Democrat had a good excuse: A 
lieutenant colonel in the Massachusetts 
Army National Guard, he was activated 
roughly a month ago and is reporting to 
Hanscom Air Force Base through May 31, he 
said Wednesday. 
‘‘I’ve been pushing back information that I 
feel my colleagues need from the vantage 
point of the National Guard,’’ he said in a 
phone call, adding he did listen to the ses-
sion. ‘‘It was pretty historic.’’ 
The Legislature owes its roots to Colonial 
times, when the ‘‘General Court’’ gathered 
for the first time in 1629 in London and later 
became the government of the Massachu-
setts 
Bay 
Colony. 
Amid 
its 
various 
iterations, members have met in person to 
cast votes, and House leaders initially ques-
tioned whether the state’s constitution even 
allowed it to conduct remote voting. 
The House’s emergency rules try to limit 
who could be in the chamber to DeLeo and 
Jones; Aaron Michlewitz, DeLeo’s budget 
chairman; eight ‘‘monitors’’ who would tally 
votes from members on conference call lines; 
and a few other Republicans, Democrats, and 
staff. 
The bill the chamber passed Wednesday al-
lows the state treasurer to borrow any ‘‘nec-
essary’’ amount this fiscal year and pay it 
back by June 2021. Donning a gray mask, 
Michlewitz said from the House floor that 
the amount could be ‘‘in the range of $3 bil-
lion,’’ though it will depend on how the 
state’s finances weather the pandemic. 
The legislation was first filed by Governor 
Charlie Baker amid fears the state could face 
a budget gap after pushing its April 15 tax 
filing deadline into July, potentially divert-
ing huge chunks of money it would otherwise 
collect now into next fiscal year. 
That appeared to already be happening. 
Massachusetts tax revenues plummeted last 
month, dropping more than 50 percent below 
what the state collected at this time a year 
ago. The $1.98 billion in taxes the state col-
lected in April—typically the biggest tax 
month—was more than $2 billion below state 
projections. 
‘‘A staggering number to say the least,’’ 
Michlewitz said. 
So, after Garlick and Representative Todd 
Smola, a Warren Republican, spoke in sup-
port of the bill, DeLeo teed up a roll call. 
Minutes later, he documented the 157–0 tally 
to officially move the bill to the Senate, 
where leaders are weighing their own rules 
to hold a remote session. 
‘‘Congratulations,’’ DeLeo said to rep-
resentatives watching and listening in. And 
he rapped the gavel to close the session. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
sert in the RECORD an April 1 Courier 
Journal article entitled, ‘‘Kentucky 
House Dramatically Limits In-Person 
Voting on Bills Due to Coronavirus 
Concerns.’’ 
[From the Louisville Courier Journal, Apr. 1, 
2020] 
KENTUCKY HOUSE DRAMATICALLY LIMITS IN- 
PERSON
VOTING
ON
BILLS
DUE
TO 
CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS 
(By Joe Sonka) 
FRANKFORT, KY.—For the first time in the 
history of the Kentucky General Assembly, a 
large majority of House members voted on 
bills remotely by texting photos of their 
paper ballot via phone. 
The move is part of rule changes adopted 
Wednesday 
out 
of 
concern 
about 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
The change was agreed on by leadership of 
the Republican majority and Democratic mi-
nority of the House in order to keep mem-
bers from being in close proximity on the 
floor of the chamber, as the number of con-
firmed cases of COVID–19 in Kentucky con-
tinued to increase. 
On Monday, lawmakers learned that a leg-
islative staffer had tested positive for the 
coronavirus, though no legislators had an-
nounced testing positive as of Wednesday. 
In a press release announcing the rules 
change shortly before the House gaveled in 
on 
Wednesday, 
House 
Speaker 
David 
Osborne, R–Prospect, said the pandemic is a 
historic challenge to the state, and his 
chamber ‘‘is willing to take equally historic 
steps to meet our Constitutional obligations 
to the people of Kentucky.’’ 
‘‘I appreciate the support of our Caucus 
members, House Minority Leadership, and 
our staff in making it possible to use every 
tool available to us in order to finish our 
work’’ Osborne stated. 
In order to adopt the rules change to allow 
remote voting, House leadership allowed 
members to enter in groups of 25 to cast 
their vote as present and in favor of amend-
ing the rules. 
Under the rules change, members could 
text a photo of their paper ballot vote to des-
ignated members of their party who re-
mained on the House floor and cast their 
votes. 
Following the approval of the rules change, 
members voted 89–1 to adopt Senate Bill 
249—freezing the pension contribution rate of 
local government employers—in a nearly 
empty chamber. 
The three Democratic leadership members 
remained on the floor as vote designates, 
while three Republicans remained as vote 
designates along with Osborne and two other 
GOP members of leadership.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2033 
May 15, 2020 
Two Democratic House members—Reps. 
Terri Branham Clark and Nima Kulkarni— 
were seen casting their votes on the bill from 
their cars in the parking lot outside the Cap-
itol Building. 
Part of the reason Democratic leadership 
agreed to the change was a pledge they re-
ceived from Republicans that the House 
would take up only vital budget and revenue 
bills on the floor Wednesday, and not unre-
lated bills. 
After the passage of SB 249, Rep. Chris Har-
ris, D–Pikeville, entered the chamber and 
spoke in praise of Osborne’s move to change 
the voting rules—noting that two weeks ear-
lier he spoke on the floor denouncing House 
Republicans’ decision to remain in session 
and vote on bills that were not related to a 
state 
budget 
or 
responding 
to 
the 
coronavirus crisis. 
‘‘I thank you for taking these historic and 
unprecedented measures to protect not only 
our members, but our families and commu-
nities,’’ Harris said. ‘‘I was critical when I 
felt you weren’t getting it right, so I want to 
be just as vocal in complimenting you 
today.’’ 
The House later used the same voting 
method to approve a one-year state budget 
for the executive branch and other appro-
priations and revenue bills that passed the 
Senate earlier in the day. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN), my very good 
friend. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
bring up three things that are very 
wrong with proxy voting that I don’t 
think have been brought up today. 
First of all, one of the problems we 
have in this building is, even though 
we all represent 700,000 people, there 
are some Congressmen who are a great 
deal more powerful than others, and 
this bill will greatly increase the power 
of leadership. 
Right now, people run into each 
other in the halls, talk to each other in 
the Cloakroom, question parts of the 
bill, and sometimes question leader-
ship’s narrative. This bill says every-
body is going to be back at home, 
which greatly strengthens the power of 
leadership 
because 
people 
aren’t 
around to question the bill. 
Secondly, it lessens bipartisanship. 
When we are gone, we do have con-
ference calls with other Republicans, 
but I find I talk to Democrats much 
more when we are in this building; and 
by taking people out of this building, 
you will decrease bipartisanship as you 
make proxy voting the norm. 
Finally, you are penalizing the press. 
We should all be available to the press 
after these votes so they get a variety 
of perspectives. We are going to work 
our way down to the point where it is 
the Speaker and a few other Democrats 
around, and the press are not going to 
be able to talk to us all. It is an insult 
to the press. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I insert in the RECORD an April 22 
Washington 
Post 
article 
entitled, 
‘‘U.K.’s Zoom Parliament Launches 
With a Few Glitches But Shows Virtual 
Democracy May Work for a While.’’ 
[From the Washington Post, Apr. 22, 2020] 
U.K.’S ZOOM PARLIAMENT LAUNCHES WITH A 
FEW GLITCHES BUT SHOWS VIRTUAL DEMOC-
RACY MAY WORK FOR A WHILE 
(By William Booth) 
LONDON.—Britain’s 
extraordinary 
first 
‘‘Parliament via Zoom’’ proceeded Wednes-
day in rather ordinary fashion, with the 
usual barbed questions and artful evasion by 
politicians, plus the addition of awkward 
views of oversize chins and bookshelves 
staged as backdrops. 
Everything was the same, and everything 
was a little odd. 
Breaking 700 years of tradition, the British 
Parliament has agreed to serve as a cradle of 
virtual democracy—to allow members to 
continue to debate, vote and legislate, but 
via video conferencing app, from the safety 
of their own homes, for the duration of Brit-
ain’s coronavirus lockdown. 
On Wednesday, there were a few minor 
technical hiccups. Some lawmakers’ heads 
were cropped at the eyebrows by the bad 
framing. Their mics were sometimes too 
close or too far away, or the Internet connec-
tion bad, and so voices sounded tinny or muf-
fled or like Darth Vader. 
But all in all, for no rehearsals? Not a bad 
opening matinee. 
For centuries, it has been essential for 
members of Parliament to be present in the 
Houses of Commons or Lords to vote. That’s 
why special ‘‘division bells’’ ring out in 
Westminster’s 
offices 
and 
committee 
rooms—and many bars—alerting lawmakers 
they have eight minutes to enter their lob-
bies, before doors are bolted shut. 
Now, instead, they will get a ping on their 
mobile phones. 
Britain is trying out ‘‘hybrid proceedings,’’ 
where up to 50 lawmakers can be in the 
House of Commons—spaced six feet apart on 
the green leather benches—while another 150 
of the 650 members can join by Zoom. 
Wednesday’s premiere featured the weekly 
thrust-and-parry session known as ‘‘Prime 
Minister’s Questions,’’ or PMQs. 
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab stood at 
the despatch box in place of Prime Minister 
Boris Johnson, who is recovering from the 
bout of covid–19 that put him in the hospital 
for a week. 
In the sparsely populated House of Com-
mons, Raab was quizzed by the new leader of 
the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, 
who was prosecutorial in his questioning, in-
sisting the government was slow to order a 
lockdown, slow to do widespread testing for 
the virus and slow to get vital protective 
gowns, masks and visors into the hands of 
front-line medical workers. 
Speaker Lindsay Hoyle called on law-
makers by swiveling his head toward what 
appeared to be a TV monitor and shouting a 
version of: ‘‘We are now going over to Ste-
phen Kinnock. STEPHEN KINNOCK!’’ 
Shouting at a television being a time-hon-
ored tradition everywhere. 
And then Kinnock, a Labour lawmaker 
from Wales, popped on the screen for those 
watching 
on 
Parliament 
TV—including 
Washington 
Post 
reporters—from 
their 
homes. 
At one point, Hoyle shouted for David 
Mundell, a Scottish Conservative, who didn’t 
answer. 
‘‘Unable to connect,’’ the speaker said, per-
haps creating a new meme, like the famous 
‘‘orrrrrder, orrrrder!’’ from past days. So 
they moved on. 
In another exchange, Peter Bone, a Con-
servative from Wellingborough, was com-
plaining about his constituents having to 
live off their overdraft accounts. ‘‘What on 
earth is going on?’’ Bone demanded. ‘‘When 
are the banks going to work in the nation in-
terest and . . .’’ 
Then his Zoom link went dead. 
Raab said, ‘‘I got the gist,’’ and answered 
anyway. 
Legislatures around the world are sorting 
out how to proceed during the pandemic. 
Some—such as the German Bundestag and 
Irish Dail—are continuing to meet in person 
but with social distancing measures. Can-
ada’s Parliament is trying a mix of in-person 
and virtual, while the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives is fighting over a proxy voting 
proposal. 
The Brits showed that it was possible to 
carry on. 
The Guardian newspaper’s Andrew Sparrow 
observed: ‘‘PMQs without 400-odd MPs in the 
chamber makes everything quieter, calmer, 
more intelligible and more grown-up. . . . 
Without the jeering and the aggro, it lacked 
gladiatorial edge, and frankly it was prob-
ably a bit more boring than the old PMQs. 
But boring is a much underrated virtue in 
governance.’’ 
Raab was questioned pointedly about the 
government’s performance during the out-
break. 
Labour lawmaker Barry Gardiner stated 
that the government’s scientific advisory 
group 
on 
emergencies 
recommended 
a 
lockdown at the end of February. ‘‘The gov-
ernment claims it has followed scientific ad-
vice,’’ he said. ‘‘But it hasn’t, has it?’’ 
Starmer asked Raab how it will be possible 
to go from the current 18,000 coronavirus 
tests a day to the 100,000 promised by the 
government by the end of the month. 
Raab sought to correct Starmer, pointing 
out that the ‘‘capacity’’ stands at 40,000. 
Starmer wasn’t having it. ‘‘I didn’t need 
correcting because I gave the figure for ac-
tual tests being carried out, which is 18,000,’’ 
he said. 
At the end of the session, Raab was asked 
by a Labour lawmaker if Britain would be 
‘‘drawn into the U.S. president’s disgraceful 
vendetta against the World Health Organiza-
tion.’’ 
President Trump has cut off funding to the 
WHO because he says the international body 
sides too closely with China, where the virus 
first exploded onto the scene. 
Raab said Britain supported international 
efforts and was a ‘‘leading player, whether 
it’s on vaccines or supporting vulnerable 
countries, in helping to get through what is 
a global crisis.’’ 
He said the WHO has ‘‘has a role to play. 
It’s not perfect, no international institution 
is—we do need to work to reform it. But we 
made clear we consider it an important part 
of the international response.’’

ing 700 years of tradition, I also insert

CORONA-ERA EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: EMPTY

Welcome to the European Parliament in

Continent, following via video-link and vot-
ing by email from their home countries. 
When European Commission President Ur-
sula von der Leyen delivered a speech chas-
tising EU member countries for thinking 
only of themselves at the start of the crisis, 
she stood meters apart from any aides and 
MEPs. 
Parliament President David Sassoli, back 
in the building following a fortnight working 
from home after a visit to his home country 
of Italy, called the session ‘‘special and 
atypical.’’ 
‘‘It is the first time that a democratic par-
liament uses remote participation, this has 
never happened before,’’ Sassoli told MEPs 
after a first round of emailed votes. ‘‘The Eu-
ropean Parliament is called on to experi-
ment with things in this way at a moment 
for great danger for our citizens.’’ 
As experiments go, this one was quite rad-
ical. 
The Parliament’s regular plenary venue of 
Strasbourg has been abandoned for the next 
few months, at least. As much as the Par-
liament has a physical home at all right 
now, it’s Brussels. 
Plenary sessions are normally four days 
long. But on Thursday everything was 
crammed into a one-day marathon to push 
through three coronavirus-related measures, 
including freeing up 37 billion in EU funding 
for member governments and temporarily al-
lowing airlines not to use their slots at air-
ports. 
Some of the Parliament’s usual quirks 
were suspended—such as the ‘‘catch the eye’’ 
procedure whereby MEPs signal to the presi-
dent that they wish to speak, and the blue 
cards raised to indicate a wish to question a 
fellow member. 
Fewer ushers than usual roamed the cham-
ber and they kept their distance from one 
another. Interpreters sat alone in their 
booths, rather than being crammed in with 
colleagues. Journalists were advised to stay 
away and watched via video stream. 
Among the few MEPs who attended in per-
son, Fulvio Martusciello of Italy wore a 
large white face mask. A Spanish MEP sport-
ed a new beard, perhaps a result of personal 
confinement. 
In the Parliament, MEPs usually vote by 
raising their hands or by pushing a button on 
their desks to give their verdict on dozens or 
more amendments before adopting a final 
legislative proposal. 
But on Thursday they considered only a 
few amendments as legislation was rushed 
through under an emergency procedure. And 
they voted from all across Europe by print-
ing out a form, then signing, scanning and 
emailing it to the Parliament. 
For some, such technological advances 
were long overdue.

‘‘Corona drags the European Parliament 
into the 21st century,’’ tweeted Dutch cen-
ter-left MEP Lara Wolters, above a picture 
of her smiling as she signed a ballot paper. 
Bulgarian center-right MEP Eva Maydell 
also endorsed the innovation. But, she added, 
‘‘this way of voting is only feasible for single 
votes. We need another solution for longer 
votes.’’ 
Some MEPs apparently doubted their col-
leagues were up to the challenge of the new 
system. 
German 
Green 
MEP 
Rasmus 
Andresen asked his fellow lawmakers on 
Twitter not to ‘‘send your votes to all col-
leagues (dont push the ‘‘reply all’’ Button). 
It’s good to be transparent, but i dont want 
to receive about 2000 emails with your votes 
in my inbox today.’’ (No older MEPs shot 
back by criticizing his lack of apostrophes or 
use of upper and lower case letters.) 
Other MEPs complained about formatting 
issues with the first ballots that were sent to 
them, including trouble converting the docu-
ments into a PDF if they were using Apple 
devices. 
Dita Charanzova from the centrist Renew 
Europe group told POLITICO the Parliament 
should have gone entirely digital and regret-
ted that staff such as ushers had to attend, 
given that people are meant to be staying at 
home for health reasons. 
‘‘We are now a digital Parliament, no one 
should have to take a risk just for a few 
members in an empty room,’’ Charanzova 
said. ‘‘It’s ridiculous to see the Commission 
there, and some MEPs. We should have gone 
completely digital for this plenary and for 
all future plenaries until the crisis is over. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. WALDEN), my good friend and the 
distinguished 
ranking 
member 
and 
former chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Oklahoma, the current 
Republican leader of the Rules Com-
mittee, for yielding. 
We are in unprecedented times, and 
unprecedented times do call for unprec-
edented actions. But using these times 
to smash a wrecking ball into the foun-
dation of democratic lawmaking by 
making 
government 
more 
remote, 
more isolated from the people by dra-
matically 
centralizing 
even 
more 
power with those few at the top in the 
majority while giving the range of the 
House to fewer than 25 Members who 
show up with votes, with proxies, 
seems like a return to boss politics. 
This is not to say there is never room 
for improvement in the way the House 
conducts its business. 
Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, I led the 
transition effort for House Repub-
licans, and we looked at ways that we 
could modernize Congress and improve 
its operations. 
But I knew these were matters not to 
be taken lightly and we needed an in-
clusive, bipartisan approach, and I 
took great care to solicit input from 
Democrats and Republicans alike. We 
even put up a suggestion box. 
What we did was good work. The 
changes were relatively small, but the 
process was robust. Unfortunately, the 
reverse is true of this proposal. 
‘‘Regular order,’’ ‘‘accountability,’’ 
‘‘transparency’’—for the most part— 
‘‘bipartisanship,’’ these are words that 
govern the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, the Republicans and Demo-
crats. As the Republican leader of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, I 
am 
concerned 
what 
this 
proposal 
means for the committees. 
How do we preserve the rights of all 
Members on both sides of the dais from 
top to bottom as we Zoom through 
hearings and markups? 
How do we preserve the integrity of 
the proceedings? 
What if there is a technology failure? 
What if somebody makes a mistake 
using the technology, like accidentally 
muting another Member or them-
selves? Haven’t we all, by now, experi-
enced the inadequacies of video confer-
encing? 
No serious legislator can believe that 
remote hearings, remote meetings, and 
remote markups are improved by these 
changes. 
Moreover, this rules change further 
dehumanizes our processes. We all 
know social media has become a cancer 
on civility. Further distancing Mem-
bers will not improve our relationships.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2035 
May 15, 2020 
Think of what gets worked out between 
Members here on the floor or in the 
committees. 
We need more bipartisan dialogue in 
this country, not less, so I urge my 
Democratic colleagues to withdraw 
this proposal and work with us to pre-
serve the great democratic traditions 
of the U.S. House that will work in this 
challenging time. 
b 1345 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been inserting 
various articles into the RECORD show-
ing other States and other parliaments 
and congresses across the world oper-
ating remotely to prove a point that it 
can be done. 
I don’t know whether my Republican 
friends are just intimidated by tech-
nology. I mean, listening to some of 
them, I think they think bifocals are a 
radical idea. But the bottom line is: We 
can do this. 
The United States Senate had a re-
mote hearing, and it worked out just 
fine. 
The bottom line is that we are in the 
middle of a health crisis, a pandemic, 
and we need to make sure that we can 
continue to do our work in a safe and 
orderly way. 
I mean, if I were cynical, I would 
think 
the 
reason 
my 
Republican 
friends are against this is to make sure 
we don’t do anything. And I get it. 
They may not like the fact that we are 
trying to address the needs and the 
concerns of the American people, but 
we are going to do this, and I hope we 
get a bipartisan vote on this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
our distinguished majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to remind us 
today of President Lincoln’s words to 
Congress. He said this: ‘‘The dogmas of 
the quiet past are inadequate to the 
stormy present. The occasion is piled 
high with difficulty, and we must rise 
with the occasion. As our case is new, 
so we must think anew and act anew.’’ 
So said President Abraham Lincoln. 
So it is today. 
This occasion is piled high with dif-
ficulty, but we must rise to the occa-
sion. Our challenges are piled high, and 
this House must rise to meet them. 
We find ourselves in new and unprec-
edented circumstances, so, Mr. Speak-
er, we must think anew and act anew. 
The House has a duty to the Amer-
ican people to do its job, even in a cri-
sis like this one that nobody on this 
floor has ever experienced. The House 
has a duty to the American people to 
do its job, especially in a crisis like 
this. 
Let me say at the outset, Mr. Speak-
er—I want my colleagues to hear me on 
this—that there is no substitute for 
personal interaction of Members in a 
committee room or on the House floor. 
I share that view, Mr. MCCARTHY 
shares that view, Ms. PELOSI shares 
that view, Mr. MCCONNELL shares that 
view. 
But when that is not possible because 
it poses a mortal danger—86,000 plus of 
our fellow citizens have died because 
they contracted COVID–19. It poses a 
mortal danger to the health of Mem-
bers, staff, press, and the public, and 
therefore, we must provide an alter-
native way to do the people’s business. 
Now, let me say that we had a bipar-
tisan task force. At the first task force 
meeting, RODNEY
DAVIS, Republican 
from Illinois, said, ‘‘We want the Con-
gress to be able to work.’’ 
My colleague said that, cynically, we 
could observe that perhaps for those 
who may not be able to garner a major-
ity for what we pass, perhaps they 
don’t want us to work. 
I hope that is not the case. 
I know the administration does not 
want us to do oversight, but that is our 
responsibility. 
This resolution will enable the House 
to conduct its work in full without 
risking the health and safety of Ameri-
cans and communities across the coun-
try from which Members come and to 
which they will return. 
It allows committees to use remote 
technology to conduct hearings and 
mark up legislation, technology al-
ready in use safely and effectively by 
millions of Americans, including the 
Supreme Court, nine people who have 
decided they ought to be separated and 
are therefore doing what has never 
been done in history. It is not a revolu-
tion. They are using technology to do 
the same thing they could do in the 
hearing chamber of the United States 
Supreme Court, period. 
The United States Senate, as so 
many of my colleagues have observed, 
held a virtual hearing. The chairman 
was not there. He was quarantined. The 
witnesses were not there. They were 
quarantined. 
Now, there were, as Mr. MCCARTHY 
has suggested, Members in the hearing 
room. So it is what Mr. MCCARTHY re-
fers to as a hybrid hearing. This rule 
provides for that. 
It will also permit the use of proxy 
voting on the House floor and takes 
steps toward adopting remote voting 
once a platform has been deemed se-
cure. 
I had hoped that Democrats and Re-
publicans could move forward with 
such changes on a bipartisan basis. 
I absolutely reject any theory that 
the character of the House is being 
changed by this rule, absolutely reject 
it. My friend is shaking his head, ‘‘No, 
it is.’’ 
Nothing changes. The same people 
vote, the same issues will be consid-
ered, the same witnesses will be heard, 
the same committee rules will be fol-
lowed. The only thing that changes is 
the technology that is available to us. 
By the way, when that board was lit 
up, 
there 
were 
some 
who 
people 
thought that was a radical change: ‘‘I 
ought to be able to stand on the floor 
and say ‘aye’ or ‘nay.’ ’’ And when C– 
SPAN was introduced: Oh, my. How 
radically that would change the House. 
I reject, I say again, that this is any 
kind of radical change. What it is is the 
use of technology to accommodate the 
crisis we confront. 
We had many productive discussions 
through our bipartisan task force, and, 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. COLE, I thank 
Mr. DAVIS, I thank Minority Leader 
MCCARTHY. I congratulate JIM MCGOV-
ERN, the chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee, for his fairness and for his at-
tentiveness to everybody’s position. 
We didn’t reach agreement. I am 
sorry that we didn’t reach agreement. 
But we took a lot of the ideas that our 
friends on the Republican side of the 
aisle suggested. They were good sug-
gestions, and we incorporated them in 
what we are doing. 
We are including in this resolution 
the requirement that any software 
platforms are to be approved by the 
chief administrative officer, so some 
technology that is not accepted or 
proved to work would not be used, and 
allowing committees to hold hybrid 
hearings, which I just referred to, with 
both remote and in-person participa-
tion simultaneously. 
However, Mr. Speaker, we were un-
able to reach a consensus on adopting 
21st century tools that would allow the 
House to meet its constitutional re-
sponsibilities during this emergency, 
which is why Democrats are bringing 
this resolution to the floor today. 
I hope, however, with this resolution 
now on the floor, that Republicans will 
join us in voting for it, and I urge them 
to do so. 
If, in fact, you want the Congress to 
be able to act and exercise our respon-
sibilities, you will vote for this rule, 
because it simply enables us to do what 
we have historically done: held hear-
ings, voted on bills, brought them to 
the floor, had amendments, and passed 
them, the only difference being that 
there will be some people, maybe many 
people, who will be doing so, as tech-
nology enables us to do, virtually. 
We know that remote technologies 
work, because the committees have al-
ready been using them to hold meet-
ings, host forums, and engage in dis-
cussions about legislation. 
Many State legislatures, Mr. Speak-
er, and foreign parliaments have al-
ready adopted these technologies suc-
cessfully. By the way, one of them is 
Kentucky, for what it is worth. 
The Washington metro area is still 
experiencing a high rate of infections, 
which has not yet peaked. 
So our doctor, on whom we have re-
lied for some of our health needs, says 
the best practice would be not to come 
together in one room, whether it be a 
committee room or the floor of the 
House, but would be to have people 
have the opportunity to vote remotely. 
That is why the Capitol physician 
has cautioned us against bringing 
Members to Washington. 
At the same time, more than half of 
those employed here as staff or support

workers commute to the Capitol com-
plex on public transit, and they are 
concerned. We have an obligation to 
protect them and their families as well. 
This change is not permanent. This is 
to meet a temporary catastrophe that 
confronts our country which we have 
not seen the likes of for over a century. 
It will not advantage or disadvantage 
either party. There is no partisan ad-
vantage in this rule; none, zero, zip. 
It does not fundamentally alter the 
nature of the House or how it operates. 
Let me repeat that. It does not fun-
damentally alter the nature of the 
House or how it operates. 
There is no dangerous precedent 
here, only a commonsense solution to 
an unprecedented crisis that demands 
our ingenuity and adaptability as an 
institution. 
Now, I said it hasn’t happened for 
more than a century. 1918, during the 
Spanish flu, they passed many, many 
pieces of legislation with two or three 
people on this floor. 
Perhaps my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle think that is better 
than the 432 others by technology say-
ing, ‘‘I vote aye,’’ ‘‘I vote nay,’’ wheth-
er it is in committee or, frankly, on 
this floor. 
Indeed, to paraphrase Lincoln: This 
is how to think anew and act anew. 
That is all we are doing. 
We need to have a system in place 
not only to deal with the current cri-
sis, but future emergencies, including 
the possibility that another surge of 
COVID–19 is going to happen this fall. 
If we fail to act now, as we failed to 
act after 9/11, we may be in a lot of 
trouble come September, without the 
capacity to join us all together in this 
Chamber, but still with the capacity to 
join us all together and participate 
pursuant to the rules of this House, 
even though we do so virtually. 
This 
resolution 
isn’t 
just 
about 
adopting remote working tools for the 
House. It is about ensuring that the 
House of Representatives, the people’s 
House, conducts its constitutional du-
ties of policymaking and oversight ef-
fectively and safely. 
I am not sure the executive depart-
ment is shedding any tears that we are 
not here. 
Hear me: It is about making sure 
that our system of checks and balances 
remains fully in place by keeping the 
House functioning to the full extent of 
its abilities even, as I said, it does so 
virtually. 
Frankly, when I say something to 
people on some of this technology, 
whether it is Zoom, FaceTime, Teams, 
WebEx, or any other technology of that 
type, very frankly, when I am looking 
at TOM COLE on that, as we did a couple 
of times, I see him on the screen, I 
know it is TOM COLE, and when TOM 
COLE says something, I know that that 
is what TOM COLE is saying. 
There is no secrecy here. There are 
no smoke and mirrors. There is no ad-
vantage to either party by this. That is 
why I do not understand why this isn’t 
a bipartisan piece of legislation ena-
bling this body to work in an effective 
way, albeit virtually. 
b 1400 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
woman LOFGREN from the House Ad-
ministration Committee and Chairman 
MCGOVERN from the Rules Committee 
for their tireless efforts on this resolu-
tion, and I want to thank all of the 
Members who have been patient while 
we 
negotiated 
with 
Republicans 
through the bipartisan task force, hop-
ing to produce a resolution that was bi-
partisan in its authorship. 
Having said that, there is a very fun-
damental difference. I understand that. 
Mr. COLE, at the hearing, offered a 
scholar’s opinion that it would be un-
constitutional to do this. Mr. MCGOV-
ERN offered another scholar’s opinion 
that it was fully constitutional to do 
this. 
If that is the fundamental difference, 
I understand. But it is not because it 
radically changes the way this House 
works or radically changes the votes of 
the majority or the minority, or radi-
cally in any other way changes this 
House of Representatives to a body 
that is not represented. This resolution 
remains bipartisan in its ideas, and I 
hope it will be bipartisan in its adop-
tion. 
Once it has passed, I would ask my 
colleagues to familiarize themselves 
with its new proxy voting requirements 
and to adhere strictly to them. That 
will allow the Clerk’s office to more ef-
fectively fulfill its role of recording 
and counting Members’ votes with ut-
most accuracy. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my 
colleagues to join me and many others 
in supporting this resolution and per-
mitting the House to do its work safely 
and in compliance with social and 
physical distancing practices urged by 
all of our medical personnel. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been extraor-
dinarily restrained in this debate be-
cause I have a lot of speakers that need 
to have time on the floor to express 
their feelings. Sometimes when the 
other side repeatedly says things that 
are either out of context or deserve a 
rebuttal, you have got to respond. To 
my good friends on the other side who 
have cited the Senate committee, they 
know in negotiations we said we would 
be happy to do exactly that. We just 
want markups to be in person. So 
please don’t use the Senate committee 
as if we somehow were opposed to that. 
Second, my friend said we are intimi-
dated by technology. We are not in-
timidated by technology. Heavens. 
We respect tradition and we think 
there is a better way to do this. As my 
friends know, we moved toward them 
in the course of that discussion. 
Finally, my very good friend, the 
chairman, said this was a plot maybe 
to do nothing. We have passed four bi-
partisan pieces of legislation working 
together. We have done a lot in the last 
few weeks, and to suggest that we 
would deliberately sabotage the oper-
ation of the House simply because we 
disagree with you is wrong. 
Quite frankly, doing nothing is bring-
ing a bill to this floor—which you are 
getting ready to do in H.R. 6800—that 
you know the Senate won’t pick up and 
you know the President won’t sign. 
That is doing nothing. 
We have proven that working to-
gether we can do a lot. All we ask is, 
let’s return to that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROG-
ERS), the distinguished ranking Repub-
lican Member on the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my good friend from Okla-
homa for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to H. Res. 965. This blatant, par-
tisan move to fundamentally alter the 
way the House and committees operate 
completely undermines the rights of 
the minority and over 200 years of 
precedent. 
As ranking member of the Homeland 
Security Committee, I am particularly 
concerned how this resolution over-
rides the rules of our committee. At 
the beginning of the Congress our com-
mittee negotiated with the majority a 
set of rules that protected minority 
rights. Now those rules are being 
thrown out and replaced by regulations 
written by the chairman of the Rules 
Committee, regulations that the mi-
nority first saw only hours ago. 
I don’t understand why Speaker 
PELOSI doesn’t trust her chairmen and 
chairwomen to negotiate with their 
ranking members on ways to accommo-
date committee business during this 
pandemic. But, apparently, she just 
doesn’t trust them. 
One of the things that concerns me 
most about this resolution is that 
nothing guarantees that Republican 
Members are going to properly be noti-
fied and able to fully participate in vir-
tual committee hearings. That may 
sound petty to you, but, unfortunately, 
on my committee, it is already the re-
ality. For the last 2 weeks, Homeland 
Security Democrats have been holding 
virtual hearings without notifying Re-
publican Members. To make matters 
worse, they restricted participation to 
only a handful of their Members. I fear 
this resolution will only further em-
power the misconduct on my com-
mittee and cause it to spread to others. 
Worst of all, this is being done for 
the short-term benefit of the majority, 
and not the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from all ranking members op-
posing this resolution. 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
May 14, 2020. 
Hon. STENY H. HOYER, 
Majority Leader of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER HOYER: We write 
in regards to H. Res. 965, which proposes par-
tisan changes that facilitate remote and vir-
tual committee operations while the House 
remains in recess.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2037 
May 15, 2020 
When the Majority first released proposed 
rule changes a few weeks ago, we couldn’t 
possibly imagine it could get any worse for 
the House as an institution. Yet, somehow, 
the Majority managed to write an even more 
egregious package of rules changes and 
seems hellbent on pushing these changes 
through without bipartisan consensus. 
Upending more than 200 years of precedent 
through partisan fiat will jeopardize the de-
liberative process of the House of Represent-
atives and our ability to represent our con-
stituents. The House will be in session this 
week with debate being held and votes being 
cast. If the whole House can conduct busi-
ness while adhering to health guidelines, 
then so too can our Committees. 
The 
work 
of 
committees 
should 
be 
prioritized to ensure that we are producing 
thoughtful legislation to support the con-
tinuing response to COVID–19 and to foster a 
robust economic recovery for the American 
people. Properly prioritizing this work will 
ensure greater flexibility in scheduling and 
increase our ability to follow all applicable 
health guidelines. 
Congress has already demonstrated that 
we can come together during this crisis to 
address the needs of the American people. 
Unfortunately, 
many 
of 
the 
proposed 
changes in H. Res. 965 are only necessary if 
you seek to move partisan measures or legis-
lation un-related to the COVID–19 response. 
The proposed resolution gives unilateral 
authority to Chairman McGovern to deter-
mine how committees manage their busi-
ness. Currently, committees are required to 
vote to ratify proposed committee rules, but 
this new superpower will allow a single Mem-
ber of the House to determine the rules of 
the road for all without amendments and 
without a vote. 
The issuance of a subpoena and conducting 
a deposition are serious matters. To allow 
remote 
depositions 
underscores 
how 
unserious H. Res. 965 truly is. A deposition is 
an important tool for committees to use and 
it should not be subject to the uncontrolled 
environment of an untested virtual setting. 
The rights of the Minority in the House 
must be protected. Without the ability to en-
sure the rights of our Members are secured, 
we cannot support your efforts and will op-
pose any attempt to alter the rules. 
As Ranking Members of all standing and 
select committees, we oppose this partisan 
assault on the rights of the House Minority 
and our ability to effectively represent the 
American people.

Michael 
Conaway,

Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, many of my constituents are show-
ing up to work every day; from grocery 
store clerks, to nurses, doctors, police-
men, and first responders. If the House 
had the resolve and the courage to do 
the same, we wouldn’t need this par-
tisan resolution. This is disgraceful. I 
urge all Members to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a May 13 letter from Norman Ornstein, 
a current resident scholar at the Amer-
ican Enterprise Institute in support of 
our plan here. 
MAY 13, 2020. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN: I want to com-
mend you for the careful and thoughtful re-
port you have issued and on which the House 
will soon act to provide the first important 
and meaningful steps to allow the House to 
operate during a dire emergency that may 
leave large numbers of members unable to 
work and be present in the Capitol to meet, 
vote and do other important business, in-
cluding crafting and marking up legislation 
and doing important oversight. 
As you know, I have been focused since 9/ 
11 on making sure we have a functioning 
Congress at times of emergency; Congress is 
the first article in the Constitution, the first 
branch, for a reason, and it is essential for 
our freedom and our system of democracy 
that it be working and acting at all times, 
but especially during crises. The alternative 
is government by executive fiat, or no gov-
ernment at all. That spurred the creation of 
the Continuity of Government Commission, 
co-chaired by the late Lloyd Cutler and 
former Senator Alan Simpson, and which I 
have served as senior counselor. 
My first interests, of course, stemmed from 
the terrorist attacks in 2001, but they were 
broadened by the anthrax scare that followed 
shortly thereafter. If it had been more di-
rected and concerted, it could have resulted 
in widespread deaths and incapacitations of 
lawmakers in the House and Senate, mean-
ing no quorum to meet the express Constitu-
tional requirement and therefore no Con-
gress for months or longer. That set of 
events also meant that in our Continuity of 
Government Commission, we had to consider 
the possibility of a crisis that could include 
a bio-attack, a pandemic, or a natural dis-
aster. One of the things we discussed and 
considered, especially reflecting the interest 
of your colleague Jim Langevin, was the 
need to have a capability for Congress to de-
bate and vote remotely if members were 
scattered across the country and could not 
meet together face to face in the Capitol or 
another designated forum. 
Unfortunately, Congress, in the nearly 20 
years since 9/11, took no significant steps to 
deal with these issues. Now they are back in 
a very serious way. COVID–19 is deadly, espe-
cially for older Americans and especially so 
when large numbers of people congregate 
closely together physically, which is a char-
acteristic of Congress. As the congressional 
physician noted, meeting together in the tra-
ditional way is currently dangerous for law-
makers, their staffs, all those working in the 
Capitol complex, and all those they come 
into contact with. Travel on common car-
riers like airlines or trains is also dangerous, 
and it is possible that airlines will be shut 
down or curtailed enough that lawmakers 
back home would not be able to get back to 
the Capitol if there were an urgent need to 
meet to act for the benefit of the American 
people. 
So the steps you have proposed, along with 
Majority Leader Hoyer and House Adminis-
tration Chair Lofgren are thoughtful, bal-
anced and sensitive to the need to create a 
plan to meet and vote remotely, while also 
understanding that this is a big step, given 
both the traditions of the House and the im-
peratives built into the Constitution. You 
commendably recognize that this first set of 
steps should be temporary, triggered only 
when absolutely necessary, and can and 
should be followed by additional action when 
we are confident that there are secure and 
usable technologies to allow remote voting, 
remote debate and deliberation, remote 
markups in committees, and so on. And you 
have pledged that you will write regulations 
that will balance the needs of majority and 
minority, be transparent, and avoid the 
kinds of manipulation that can occur with 
unlimited proxy voting. 
I hope the House, in a bipartisan fashion, 
will endorse your plan and make sure we 
have a functioning House throughout this 
terrible crisis, to do what the Framers ex-
pected from the people’s house, and to pro-
tect the interests and liberties of all of us. 
Sincerely, 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN, 
Resident Scholar, 
The American Enterprise Institute. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, in re-
sponse to the gentleman who just 
spoke, I don’t know what he is talking 
about, but there is nothing in this 
package that we are presenting that 
would undermine minority rights. I am 
happy to urge him to have his staff 
contact ours, but what he is talking 
about has nothing to do with what we 
are discussing here today. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. BOST), my very good 
friend. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Oklahoma for yielding to 
me. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people 
are sacrificing on the front lines. It has 
already been discussed about the truck 
drivers, the nurses, and all of that. 
I was going to go on to that, but then 
when I sat on this floor and listened to 
things that were being said—remem-
ber, I come from the State of Illinois 
where over a long period of time, about 
35 years, we have seen small moves 
that sounded so good at the time, giv-
ing all of their power to the Speaker— 
all of their power given away, which is 
not what our Founding Fathers said. 
Mr. Speaker, the sponsor of this bill 
has said on several occasions that he 
would like to insert this statement 
into the RECORD and this article into

the RECORD. Well, they do not change 
the facts of Article I, Section 5 that are 
so clear, that this is unconstitutional. 
I hope for the sake of the people who 
I represent or the people who each one 
of us represent that the Members will 
stand against this proposed rule, a rule 
that gives more power to one person in-
stead of the individuals that we have 
here the way it was originally set up. 
Mr. Speaker, as I direct my com-
ments toward you and the Chair, I 
would like to say this: If you believe 
that I, as a Member, am going to give 
up by proxy the ability to represent my 
720,000 people, it will not happen. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the 
good news is that the gentleman 
doesn’t have to give anything up. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time re-
mains? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has 11⁄2 
minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from Oklahoma has 81⁄2
minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. LATTA), my very good 
friend. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H. Res. 965, which is a flagrant dis-
regard to the Constitution and House 
traditions. 
Proxy voting has previously been de-
liberated in this body. In 1970, an 
amendment was offered to ban all 
forms of proxy voting in committees. It 
argued committee members should be 
present in person to listen to debate, 
discuss, and vote. Proxy voting tends 
to add to the cloud of suspicion hang-
ing over Congress. 
The use of proxy voting on important 
bills gives up a Member’s voice and 
adds to the appearance of secrecy. In 
1974, an amendment was offered to en-
tirely ban proxy voting. It was adopted 
by this House but later overturned by 
the Democratic Caucus. A CRS report 
gave the opponents’ views to proxy vot-
ing by stating that it contributes to 
the domination of committee chairs, 
contributes to absenteeism, and de-
tracts from the care necessary to for-
mulate sound legislation. 
A history maxim states that he who 
forgets the past is condemned to repeat 
it. Learn from our past and vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished Member 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA), my 
good friend. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Oklahoma for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, our Founders used to 
ride days on horseback, on wagons, and 
through unkind conditions to get to 
D.C. to do their jobs for all of us at the 
time. We only have to brave TSA lines 
and occasionally delayed flights. 
The Constitution here did not catch 
the virus. Why are we voting on a 
measure here to basically suspend it? 
These rules have been in place since ba-
sically 1789. 
Mr. Speaker, our constituents elected 
us to come to Congress and do our job 
and be their voice in Washington, D.C. 
This would only mute their voice. 
Just as ballot harvesting in my State 
has led to some shady and even fraudu-
lent outcomes, Members of Congress 
should not have to be here to be pos-
sibly coerced by certain other Members 
to how their votes should be shaped. 
We need to be able to show up. It is not 
that hard, really, at the end of the day. 
We have a higher calling to come 
here and do our job and be present to 
have these interactions, to have these 
conversations, especially when we are 
talking about possibly $3 trillion of 
new spending that is going to be debt 
for the grandkids that we are still try-
ing to be helpful to in our future gen-
erations. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this and we 
need to stop and think of what we are 
doing here. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN), my 
very good friend. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, why 
is it not too big of a health concern to 
call us back from all across the coun-
try to vote on a useless messaging bill 
that will wither on the vine outside 
this Chamber, but it is too much to ask 
us to come back and hold committee 
hearings? 
Proxy voting shouldn’t happen; not 
now, not ever. If Members of Congress 
are unwilling to do their job, they 
should step down and let someone else 
do it. If politicizing a process weren’t 
enough, the Speaker is now weakening 
the core foundations of Congress. 
Already, House Democrats have dem-
onstrated their expertise at crafting 
partisan bills behind closed doors. And 
on the Natural Resources Committee, 
they have been holding partisan virtual 
hearings disguised as roundtables with 
no Republican input. 
I will concede to my colleagues 
across the aisle that proxy voting will 
keep the process moving: the wrong 
process, the wrong direction, and for 
all the wrong reasons. I am not only 
concerned about how we will be voting; 
I am also concerned about what we will 
be voting on. 
Is the plan now for a handful of Mem-
bers to come back to D.C. every other 
week to vote on yet another messaging 
bill from the Speaker? This is wrong 
and none of us should stand for it. Re-
publicans are ready to get back to real 
work. I ask Speaker PELOSI to please 
quit playing games with the rules and 
let us do our jobs. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE). 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I was lis-
tening to the majority leader talk 
about a statement that Abraham Lin-
coln made. He made it in his annual re-
port to the Congress on December 1, 
1862. In that message, he proposed one 
of the dumbest ideas that has ever been 
put forth in this Congress and that 
was: instead of freeing the enslaved 
people in this country, we would round 
them up and put them on boats and 
take them back to Africa. That is what 
was in his message. 
He talks about the tired dogmas of 
the past. The Constitution is not 
dogma. It is the fundamental law of 
this country. 
b 1415 
Remember, on December 1, 1862, this 
Congress was in this room. Fifty miles 
away, 10 days later, a fierce and awful 
battle took place in Fredericksburg, 
with 18,000 casualties. If it hadn’t been 
winter, the Confederate Army could 
have come here and taken this build-
ing. Yet, they continued to meet here, 
through pandemics of yellow fever and 
malaria. This was the hottest spot in 
the country for typhoid fever for over 
15 years, and the Congress still met in 
this room. 
Millions of Americans go to work 
every day, doing their jobs, and they 
expect us to do the same. Instead of 
adopting this very ill-considered rule, 
we should all get to Washington, do our 
jobs, and take care of the American 
people. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from the 
great 
State 
of 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, this isn’t 
about changing the rules to get things 
done. This is about changing the rules 
to hide what is done and who has done 
it. 
This rule would change what is going 
to happen shortly here, which is a bill 
that provides another $1 trillion to 
State and local governments in addi-
tion to the funds provided under the 
CARES Act. Now, much of the $1 tril-
lion already sent to the States has yet 
to be spent. 
Take my home State of Pennsyl-
vania, Mr. Speaker, where the Gov-
ernor there has withheld CARES Act 
funding and extorted the counties to go 
along with his indefinite shutdown, the 
untimely deaths of hundreds and thou-
sands in nursing homes, and the bank-
ruptcy of many of our citizens. 
This unnecessary and unconstitu-
tional mandate has resulted in 1.8 mil-
lion Pennsylvanians losing their jobs. 
We are fifth in population, number one 
in unemployment, and one or two in 
untimely deaths in nursing homes. 
Despite all the CARES Act funds 
that we have already given, 41 days is 
what it takes, on the average, for 
somebody to receive unemployment 
benefits run by the State. 
More money isn’t going to help any-
thing here, Mr. Speaker, not one more 
cent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2039 
May 15, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from the 
great 
State 
of 
Michigan 
(Mr. 
WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I had 
an experience just last week, in a vir-
tual hearing, when it came my turn to 
push the ‘‘mute off’’ button on the 
microphone, it didn’t work. I was 
passed over. Then, when I texted in to 
find out why, I was told, basically: 
That is too bad. We will catch you at 
the end. 
The only place for us to be in this 
Congress is where we are supposed to 
be, and that is here. We ought to be 
doing our work together. 
Let me read you a quote from Gen-
eral Omar Bradley, a famous general 
who understood the cost of leadership. 
He said, of the Athenians: 
In the end, more than they wanted free-
dom, they wanted security. They wanted a 
comfortable life, and they lost it all—secu-
rity, comfort, and freedom. When the free-
dom they wanted most was freedom from re-
sponsibility, then Athens ceased to be free. 
Mr. Speaker, together, we work for 
the freedom of this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I would submit to you 
that if I am not willing to do what is 
necessary to be here, then it is time for 
me to consider turning over to some-
body else. I would suggest that that 
ought to be for all of us who are privi-
leged to represent people in this august 
body, which is not like any other par-
liamentary body in the world, not like 
a State legislature. This is the U.S. 
Congress. Let’s act like it. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
a parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts will state 
his parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the 
gentleman just said that we had an of-
ficial virtual hearing in this House. 
I want to know whether or not, under 
the rules that currently exist, is it al-
lowed for there to be official hearings 
virtually or remotely? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair doesn’t advise on committee pro-
ceedings. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
take it as there was not a hearing. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, may I 
respond. Education and Labor Com-
mittee last week. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Not a hearing. 
Mr. WALBERG. Witnesses. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, we have 
heard a lot today that the Republican 
plan was simply to prioritize testing 
for Members of Congress. Actually, it 
is a great deal more than that, as my 
friends know. It is much more expan-
sive and much more complete. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the Republican plan authored by the 
distinguished Republican leader, Mr. 
DAVIS of Illinois, and myself. 
A PLAN FOR THE PEOPLE’S HOUSE 
FOUR STRATEGIES TO REOPEN CONGRESS AND 
RESTORE AMERICA’S VOICE 
(By Kevin McCarthy) 
Benjamin Franklin once said, ‘‘If you fail 
to plan, you are planning to fail.’’ 
Recently, we called on Speaker Pelosi to 
establish a clear, safe, and effective plan for 
reopening the House of Representatives. This 
follows the White House and America’s gov-
ernors releasing their own detailed plans for 
a phased reopening of society, and now, both 
the United States Senate and Democratic 
Speaker of the California State Assembly 
calling their members back into session. 
In the interim, a bipartisan taskforce has 
been convened—on which we are all serving— 
to further explore ways in which Congress 
can operate during this challenging time. 
While differences remain, it has become 
clear through our initial meetings that all 
members of our taskforce share several fun-
damental beliefs. 
First, the business of the People’s House is 
‘‘essential work’’ that must not be sidelined 
or ground to a halt. 
Second, there is intrinsic value in a Con-
gress—a physical meeting of people and 
ideas—that should be dutifully guarded. 
And third, any changes to centuries-old 
rules and precedents of the House should be 
done in a deliberate and bipartisan way. 
As we enter this indeterminate period be-
tween outright mitigation and a return to 
normalcy, everyone recognizes that our typ-
ical ways of doing business will need to ad-
just. Simply put, Congress will look and feel 
different. 
However, we believe there is a pathway for-
ward that enables the House to fully perform 
its key functions without compromising our 
shared values or sacrificing bedrock norms. 
To that end, we offer four strategies that 
should form the basis of any plan to reopen 
Congress and restore America’s voice. These 
strategies are based on the advice of public 
health professionals, as well as guidance 
from parliamentary experts with decades of 
combined House experience. 
We believe embracing this approach would 
achieve 
the 
necessary 
balance 
between 
health and institutional concerns—and hope-
fully build a more resilient and productive 
legislative branch in the process. 
STRATEGY 1: MODIFY EXISTING PRACTICES AND 
STRUCTURES 
The Rules Committee majority staff report 
on voting options during the pandemic 
states: ‘‘By far the best option is to use the 
existing House rules and current practices’’ ( 
emphasis original). 
Already, Congress has demonstrated its 
ability to adapt and to do so responsibly. 
Earlier this month, the Rules Committee 
successfully convened an in-person business 
meeting in accordance with health guide-
lines developed by the Attending Physician 
and Sergeant at Arms. Likewise, over 50 
members 
participated 
in 
a 
hearing 
on 
COVID–19 response efforts hosted by the 
Committee on Small Business. And this 
week, the Labor-HHS Appropriations Sub-
committee will hold an in-person hearing on 
the coronavirus pandemic. 
Beyond committee business, nearly 400 
members came to the House Floor on April 
23 in an orderly and physically distant fash-
ion to record their votes on two consecutive 
measures, a process that Speaker Pelosi 
characterized as having been executed ‘‘fabu-
lously.’’ 
Moving forward, we should expand these 
protocols to reduce density and congestion 
in every facet of our work. 
House office buildings and individual office 
floor plans should be assessed to provide new 
provisional occupancy levels—with an eye 
towards possible reconfigurations to accom-
modate physical distance. 
Additionally, measures should be explored 
to engineer temporary controls or barriers in 
locations where physical distance is difficult 
to achieve, as is currently happening in gro-
cery stores and other places of public accom-
modation across America. For example, 
plexiglass dividers could be installed in high 
trafficked areas, like security checkpoints, 
or possibly in committee hearing rooms 
along the dais to provide further separation 
between members. 
STRATEGY 2: EMPLOY A PHASED RETURN WITH 
COMMITTEES 
Just as our states are employing a phased 
reopening approach, Congress should do so as 
well—beginning with committees and sub-
committees as the engines of regular order. 
Currently, the average total membership 
of a standing House Committee is approxi-
mately 40 members, with average sub-
committee membership in the teens. 
Each committee should present an outline 
to the Majority Leader detailing their pro-
jected business meetings for the month 
ahead, along with estimated attendance lev-
els. 
Working 
backwards, 
this 
information 
could be used to generate a staggered busi-
ness calendar, with rotating use of larger 
committee hearing rooms where necessary. 
Precedence should be given to bipartisan 
COVID–19 response measures and other high- 
priority legislative items, such as the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, Water Re-
sources Development Act, and FY21 appro-
priations measures. 
By directing committees to focus on legis-
lation that has bipartisan and bicameral ap-
peal, we can make the most of each mem-
ber’s time and effort, thereby making the 
House more productive. 
This system would also ensure greater 
transparency and regular order for all mem-
bers—as opposed to centralized decision- 
making by a select group of leadership and 
staff that reduces the role of representative 
to merely voting ‘‘yea’’ or ‘‘nay’’ on pre- 
drafted proposals. 
At the start, we do not envision routine re-
corded votes occurring in the House every 
day or perhaps even every session week. In-
stead, our voting schedule should be reimag-
ined in the near-term, with postponement 
authority providing a structure to queue up 
bills at the end of a week or work period. 
Lastly, regular morning hour time should 
be restored so all members have the oppor-
tunity give one- and five-minute speeches 
from the House Floor, an essential forum 
that has not been available now for over a 
month. 
STRATEGY 3: DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY IN A 
‘‘CRAWL, WALK, RUN’’ PROGRESSION 
The rules change proposal introduced by 
Chairman McGovern would enable sweeping 
use of technology for every element of com-
mittee business. 
This is concerning for a variety of rea-
sons—many of which are catalogued in the 
Rules Committee majority staff report—in-
cluding untested assumptions that members 
have ‘‘reliable, connected technology, knowl-
edge of how to use that technology, access to 
round-the-clock technical support, . . . [and] 
secure connectivity with the capacity to 
transmit potentially large amounts of data,’’ 
just to name a few. 
From a security standpoint, the House 
averages 1.6 billion unauthorized scans, 
probes, and malicious attempted network 
cyber-connections per month. Earlier this 
month, our colleagues experienced this kind 
of incident firsthand with hackers inter-
rupting a House Oversight Committee video 
event multiple times.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2040 
May 15, 2020 
In our view, technology should only be de-
ployed in a ‘‘crawl, walk, run’’ progression. 
Before we rush to discard over 200 years of 
precedent, we should require that rigorous 
testing standards be met, ample feedback be 
provided, and bipartisan rules of the road be 
agreed upon and made public to truly safe-
guard minority rights. 
We believe ‘‘hybrid’’ hearings—an idea ini-
tially 
proposed 
by 
Democrats 
on 
the 
taskforce—could serve as a useful proof-of- 
concept to consider, similar to the model 
currently being used in the United Kingdom 
to facilitate virtual question time in the 
House of Commons. 
For the purposes of these hybrid hearings, 
in-person quorum requirements should re-
main in place (most committee rules require 
only two members be present to hear testi-
mony), with allowances for committee and 
non-partisan support staff to guide the pro-
ceedings and troubleshoot any technical 
problems. For the reasons outlined above, 
virtual participation should not become the 
default—but should instead be reserved for 
members in at-risk categories or who are 
otherwise unable to travel to D.C. 
Under this proposal, committees that regu-
larly handle sensitive and classified mate-
rials, including Intelligence and Ethics, 
would still be required to meet in-person. 
We cannot recommend using virtual plat-
forms for committee markups, given the 
mountain of unanswered questions regarding 
how more complex and involved procedural 
maneuvers would work in a remote setting. 
STRATEGY 4: ACCELERATE ACTIVE RISK 
MITIGATION PRACTICES 
Thanks to the efforts of the Attending 
Physician, in coordination with the House 
Administration Committee, the fourth strat-
egy has already been set in motion. 
Personal 
Protective 
Equipment 
(PPE) 
kits—including gloves, facemasks, and alco-
hol-based hand sanitizers—have been pro-
vided to each member office and committee, 
with additional supplies available on-de-
mand. 
Hand sanitizing stations are now ubiq-
uitous around the Capitol campus—including 
on the House Floor—while enhanced cleaning 
procedures have become the new standard, 
with areas ripe for surface contamination 
having been limited or removed. 
Staffing has been kept to a minimum 
through continued use of teleworking proce-
dures, while the Capitol remains open to 
only 
members, 
required 
staff, 
and 
credentialed press. 
Even so, these mitigation practices can be 
accelerated in several key ways. 
Measured screening procedures should be 
considered, consisting of either selfreported 
medical diagnostic assessments, at-home 
temperature monitoring, touchless thermal 
temperature checks at office entry points, or 
any combination thereof. 
A uniform ‘‘return-to-work’’ policy—in ac-
cordance with existing CDC guidelines— 
should be adopted for any staffer experi-
encing signs of illness. 
Finally, our ongoing and iterative testing 
regime should be scaled as test availability 
increases 
nationwide. 
This 
plan 
should 
progress to incorporate asymptomatic ran-
domized testing, and eventually, FDA au-
thorized rapid antigen tests. 
CONCLUSION 
We fully appreciate the extraordinary na-
ture of the challenge before us. However, 
when it comes to fundamentally altering 
how the House operates—in this case, poten-
tially abandoning the Capitol for the re-
mainder of the 116th Congress under the in-
troduced Democratic proposal—every avenue 
should first be explored that preserves endur-
ing institutional rules while prioritizing 
member health. 
As Chairman McGovern recently wrote, 
‘‘decisions we make today will influence the 
choices made in this chamber 100 years from 
now.’’ 
We agree—and firmly believe it is our job 
as leaders of our respective parties to ensure 
the most reasoned voices prevail on this crit-
ical matter, not simply the loudest ones. 
This pandemic has claimed too many lives 
and livelihoods already. We must not allow 
the institution we are tasked with safe-
guarding to be the next. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCARTHY), who 
is the Republican leader of the House 
of Representatives. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him for his work, and RODNEY 
DAVIS’ as well. Unfortunately, it did 
not come to the place where we could 
have a bipartisan agreement. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, today isn’t just a 
day for debate. It is also a day for re-
membrance. It is Peace Officers Memo-
rial Day and the second-to-last day of 
Police Week. So, before I begin, I want 
to say thank you to everyone who 
serves as a police officer or is a family 
member of a police officer, including 
our wonderful Capitol Police and their 
families who do an incredible job pro-
tecting this campus, its employees, and 
its visitors. As the guardians of peace, 
they are on the front lines every day. 
Despite 
the 
danger, 
they 
are 
undeterred from performing their duty. 
As the son of a firefighter, I know 
that they do not do their job for rec-
ognition or praise, but they truly de-
serve our gratitude, especially now. So, 
I thank them for everything they do, 
from a very grateful Congress. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, the work of our 
frontline heroes is the definition of 
‘‘essential.’’ It cannot be done re-
motely or by proxy. 
Why should Congress be any dif-
ferent? We are supposed to represent 
the people. We should strive to show a 
level of determination in our impor-
tant work that is worthy of the police 
officers we honor today. The American 
people expect us to do our part to de-
feat this virus just like they are doing 
on a daily basis. 
Mr. Speaker, Speaker PELOSI said in 
this exact Chamber just a few weeks 
ago: ‘‘We are captains of the ship. We 
are the last to leave.’’ 
But proxy voting calls on Congress to 
abandon the ship and be the first to 
leave for months or possibly for the 
rest of the session. The Speaker is on 
the brink of launching the most signifi-
cant power grab in the history of Con-
gress. It runs counter to 230 years of 
House rules and even the Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, our Founders would be 
ashamed that we aren’t assembling. I 
want every American to understand 
what it means for their Member of Con-
gress to whom they lend their voice in 
Washington. It means that you can 
stay home for the rest of the year but 
still get paid for the rest of the year. 
Many Americans will not be paid. 
It means that they can let someone 
else—Speaker 
PELOSI—consolidate 
power and do their job for them when 
they could do it for themselves. It 
means that they will participate only 
in legislative theater while shutting 
your voice out for the real lawmaking 
process. 
A virtual Congress would be a Con-
gress that is connected to the internet 
but disconnected from the American 
people. That isn’t fair to our constitu-
ents, our colleagues, or our country. It 
undermines the very purpose of rep-
resentative democracy as our Founders 
designed it. 
Roger Sherman, the only Founder to 
sign all four great state documents, 
said, in 1789: ‘‘When the people have 
chosen a representative, it is his duty 
to meet others from the different parts 
of the Union and consult and agree 
with them to such acts as are for the 
general benefit of the whole commu-
nity.’’ 
Sherman was right. Especially in a 
pandemic, our presence here, our Con-
gress together, matters. It matters to 
our constituents; it matters to our in-
stitution; and it matters to all those 
who will come after us. 
This pandemic has claimed too many 
lives and livelihoods already. We must 
not allow this great body that we are 
charged with safeguarding to be the 
next casualty if you pass this bill. 
In fact, aren’t we proving today that 
we don’t need a virtual Congress? 
In the middle of this virus, the House 
is conducting its business while fol-
lowing the health guidelines. We can do 
that at a committee level, too. 
Our Republican colleagues, Mr. COLE 
and Mr. DAVIS, had submitted that 
‘‘Plan for the People’s House’’ for the 
committees to work in a safe manner. 
It is the only side that has produced a 
plan, and it was a bipartisan plan to 
move forward. It is about more than re-
opening a campus. It is about restoring 
America’s voice. 
We don’t have to choose between the 
health of our Capitol community and 
the health of this institution. We can 
continue to work in a safe and effective 
manner without overturning 230 years 
of constitutional and legislative tradi-
tion. Remote voting should be the final 
and last option, not the first and only. 
Unfortunately, rather than allowing 
the most reasoned voices to prevail on 
this crucial matter, my friends across 
the aisle have surrendered to the loud-
est voice. 
Mr. Speaker, as I look at this reck-
less proposal, I am reminded of what 
the great American author James 
Fenimore Cooper said in 1838. He said 
that the most dangerous attacks on 
freedom are made by ‘‘the largest 
trustees of authority, in their efforts 
to increase their power.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I believe that is worth 
hearing again. It was said in 1838 that 
the most dangerous attacks on freedom 
are made by ‘‘the largest trustees of 
authority, in their efforts to increase 
their power.’’ 
Cooper was correct, and that should 
concern each and every one of us

today. By changing the rules to in-
crease the power of a select few, Demo-
crats will forever alter our institution 
for the worse. 
That will be the legacy that is left 
this Congress, a Congress that is a 
voice of people who have lent their 
voice throughout this Nation to 435 
Members that will now shrink to 20. We 
were warned that the dangers of free-
dom will come from those who are the 
trustees of authority. We were warned 
so maybe today would never happen, 
but now we are witnesses of it. In a few 
minutes, we will be given the oppor-
tunity to make that choice. 
Mr. Speaker, will your legacy be 
what Cooper had warned the Nation 
about? I hope it will not. 
Mr. Speaker, if you are okay with 
overturning 230 years of tradition and 
allowing 20 Members to control Con-
gress, then vote for this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, if you enjoy being cut 
out of the lawmaking process, then 
vote for this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, if you ran to get a title 
but are willing to give your vote in re-
turn, then vote for this resolution. But 
if you think our Congress still matters, 
and if you think the people’s voice still 
matters, then I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I know each and every 
one of you will honor the police for 
doing their job. Each and every one of 
you will honor all those in the medical 
community for doing their job. I know 
Members will honor the delivery driv-
er, will honor the cashier, and will 
honor those who are behind the check 
stands at Home Depot or in the grocery 
store because Members think what 
they are doing is essential. 
I hope that Members look deep in 
their hearts because when they asked 
their constituents to vote for them be-
cause they believed the job they were 
running for was essential for the Na-
tion—because I think it is—I want 
them to look at their vote. 
Because, Mr. Speaker, if you believe 
20 should have the power, if you believe 
you should have the title and not do 
the job, and if you believe you should 
be paid while you stay home, I think 
we have a difference of opinion. 
I believe our work is essential, and I 
believe we are proving we can do it. I 
believed the Speaker when she said just 
a few weeks ago that we are captains of 
the ship and that we will be the last to 
leave, not the first to abandon it like 
you will today. 
A vote for this resolution is a vote to 
abandon this House, to abandon the 
Constitution, to abandon 230 years of 
tradition. You will still have your 
title. You will have no power. And 
worst of all, your constituents will 
have no voice. 
b 1430 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
The distinguished minority leader 
asked the question: Why should we be 
treated differently from anyone else in 
this country? That is actually a very 
good question, and that is why we re-
jected his proposal and his idea that 
Members of Congress get preferential 
treatment, that we move to the front 
of the line with regard to tests at a 
time when our doctors and our nurses 
and our teachers and volunteers in 
homeless shelters and in food banks 
can’t get a test, but somehow we are so 
special that we should move to the 
front of the line. 
We rejected that. And quite frankly, 
it is one of the reasons why people have 
a bad feeling sometimes about Con-
gress because of when they hear those 
kinds of suggestions. 
Quite frankly, I am ashamed that 
even that idea was brought forward in 
a serious way. I know they do this at 
the White House, but the idea that we 
would step ahead of everybody else 
doesn’t make any sense. 
Mr. Speaker, to hear some of my Re-
publican friends, you would think this 
House conducts its business today, in 
2020, just as it did in 1798. But that is 
just not true. A lot has changed these 
last 230 years, from the way we vote to 
the way we count a quorum. Americans 
are watching and they are listening to 
this debate live right now because of 
actions Congress took decades ago to 
adapt to new technology. 
The changes that we are talking 
about here aren’t permanent ones like 
that. These are temporary, to be used 
only during this pandemic. Once it is 
over, we go back to working side by 
side and in person. 
State legislatures and governments 
around the world have already acted to 
make remote voting possible. I really 
don’t know why some people here be-
lieve that this House is somehow dif-
ferent. We can’t afford to let this pan-
demic stop our legislative work in its 
tracks. 
And I would say to the minority lead-
er: We want to do our work, and we 
want to do the oversight to make sure 
that the administration appropriates 
the money that we fought to get to the 
American people the right way. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H. Res. 965, a measure to ensure 
that the House can continue to govern during 
the coronavirus pandemic. The proposals be-
fore us offer new ways to conduct our legisla-
tive business. In some respects, they present 
new tools for governing—but they are within 
our authority to implement and they are not in-
tended to replace our regular order. To the 
contrary, they present a fallback option to en-
sure that the House can continue to lead dur-
ing this crisis, and as the resolution makes 
clear, they are intended to be used only during 
extraordinary circumstances. 
And there can be no doubt that these are 
extraordinary times. We know that to date, 
about 1.4 million Americans have already con-
tracted this deadly virus. To put this in per-
spective, that’s more than the entire popu-
lation of my hometown, San Jose, California, 
which is the tenth largest city in the country. 
In just three months, more Americans have 
died from the coronavirus than were killed in 
all the wars we have fought in more than a 
half century combined—including in Vietnam, 
Iraq, and Afghanistan. 
According to one model, which the White 
House has relied on, by August of this year 
the toll could be as high as 147,000 deaths. 
That’s nearly twice as many as the same 
model forecast only two weeks ago. 
At the same time, we face dire economic 
conditions. In the past eight weeks, more than 
36.5 million unemployment claims have been 
filed, and the unemployment rate has quad-
rupled, soaring to 14.7 percent. It has pre-
viously been estimated that the nation’s high-
est ever unemployment rate was 24.9 percent, 
during the Great Depression in 1933. Yester-
day, California’s Employment Development 
Department released new data which show 
that the unemployment rate in my state may 
already be 24.4 percent. 
The coronavirus pandemic has affected 
nearly every aspect of our daily lives, upend-
ing businesses and grinding our economy to a 
halt. This crisis demands legislative action and 
oversight. 
However, the health guidelines issued by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion and the advice of the Attending Physician 
show that there are significant challenges to 
the House operating as if nothing has 
changed, 
including 
the 
need 
for 
social 
distancing, use of masks or facial coverings, 
cancelling any gatherings of more than 250 in-
dividuals or more than 10 individuals in a high- 
risk category, and others. 
Moreover, we are still learning about how 
this highly contagious deadly virus is spread 
and what steps can be taken to mitigate its 
further spread. I represent Santa Clara Coun-
ty, which experts now believe suffered the first 
death from the coronavirus in the United 
States. But experts did not know until mid- 
April that a death which occurred on February 
6 was actually a result of the coronavirus. 
I am mindful that many people are putting 
themselves at risk by working on the frontlines 
every day: from doctors and nurses, to police 
officers, firefighters, and paramedics, to transit 
workers and truck drivers, among others. As 
the daughter of a truck driver and a cafeteria 
cook, I deeply appreciate everything all of 
these people are doing to support their com-
munities and the country, even at risk to their 
own health. 
However, we in Congress have an option 
that most of these vital frontline workers do 
not: we can do our work remotely in a safe, 
secure, online format. It is clear that we need 
rules that allow the House to conduct over-
sight of the coronavirus response, mark up 
legislation, and take votes on the House Floor 
without needlessly putting Members, Capitol 
Police, staff, press, and non-partisan institu-
tional staff at risk. 
The resolution before us would provide 
mechanisms to do just that, both at the com-
mittee level and on the House floor. 
A series of events this week prove that the 
highest levels of our government recognize 
the need to adapt our work to the 21st cen-
tury—and that we can do so in a safe, secure, 
and transparent way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2042 
May 15, 2020 
The Supreme Court—which has long re-
sisted modest attempts to increase trans-
parency and public access to its pro-
ceedings—heard oral arguments by con-
ference call, as it has done during the pan-
demic. Those important cases involve critical 
congressional oversight prerogatives. 
The Senate held a hearing that included re-
mote participation, as it has done during the 
pandemic. This time, it included an entire 
panel of witnesses testifying remotely, as well 
as a Chairman and Ranking Member who led 
the hearing remotely, in addition to other Sen-
ators. 
For its part, the executive branch recog-
nized the legitimacy and need for these virtual 
proceedings by participating in the pro-
ceedings of both the legislative and judicial 
branches—including by having high ranking 
members of the White House Task Force tes-
tify remotely in a Senate hearing about the 
Administration’s response. 
Expanding congressional activity online en-
sures that we can continue to act, while re-
serving precious testing equipment and sup-
plies for frontline workers who don’t have jobs 
that can be performed remotely. 
The House has not always been quick to 
adopt technology to its legislative procedures. 
It is not unusual for any institution steeped in 
history and precedent to resist technological 
change. That was the case for the House 
when it came to advances like electronic vot-
ing and televising our proceedings—both of 
which we take for granted today. The first bill 
to permit a form of electrical and mechanical 
voting was introduced in 1886, but the House 
did not take its first electronic vote until 1973, 
nearly 90 years later. Similarly, it took more 
than 40 years from the time Members of the 
House first appeared on live television to the 
time that cameras were allowed to broadcast 
live proceedings on the House floor. 
Resistance to technological change for gov-
erning has not been unique to the House. The 
Senate took another seven years after the 
House to permit television coverage of its pro-
ceedings, and it still does not permit electronic 
voting. Even today, the Supreme Court does 
not televise its proceedings. 
Yet, as we have seen this week, both of 
those institutions have recognized that we are 
living in extraordinary times, and that it is es-
sential to change the way they operate. 
We can—and we must—act swiftly to en-
sure that Congress can continue its legislative 
and oversight work online during these unique 
and extraordinary times. Working with Leader 
Hoyer, Chairman McGovern, and the staffs of 
the Rules and House Administration commit-
tees, together we have prepared a proposal 
that encompasses two distinct components: 
remote, directed voting on the House floor, 
and remote committee hearings and markups 
to ensure that we can continue to develop ad-
ditional legislative solutions and carry out 
oversight of the Administration’s response. 
For committee operations, the resolution 
provides for the use of suitable, secure online 
platforms for committee proceedings. The in-
tent of the resolution is not to provide an ad-
vantage to either the majority or the minority, 
but to permit committees’ proceedings to have 
the same status and significance as if they 
were held entirely in-person. 
For voting on the floor, we will rely on a se-
cure email system, coupled with Member-driv-
en, remotely-directed authorizations. This sys-
tem would use secure email for proxy votes: 
a solid, well known, resilient technology with 
very low bandwidth requirements that we un-
derstand very well from a cybersecurity stand-
point. 
These new provisions build on steps we 
have already taken to expand the use of tech-
nology during the pandemic to promote social 
distancing and other safeguards consistent 
with the advice of the Attending Physician and 
the CDC. 
For example, last month the Speaker di-
rected the creation of an electronic hopper to 
permit the virtual submission of all Floor docu-
ments—including bills, resolutions, co-spon-
sors and extensions of remarks—via a dedi-
cated and secure email system. Since the pol-
icy took effect, 489 measures have been filed, 
and of those, 482 measures were filed elec-
tronically and just 7 were filed using the old 
process. 
And in my capacity as Chairperson of the 
Joint Committee on Printing, I directed the 
GPO to accept for publication in the Congres-
sional Record extensions of remarks sub-
mitted with a Member’s electronic signature. 
Under this new, more convenient system 
Members have filed 356 extensions of re-
marks by email. 
I represent Silicon Valley, which has be-
come synonymous around the world for tech-
nology and the spirit of innovation. We in Con-
gress must adopt the entrepreneurial spirit and 
openness to new technology that made that 
community a global leader and apply it to the 
procedural and logistical challenges we face in 
our legislative operations—as well as to a 
strategy to respond to and overcome the 
coronavirus. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, the American 
people, our constituents, are keeping this 
country afloat during this emergency. 
They are looking at the representatives to 
lead—not only through the legislation we de-
bate and pass, but through the example we 
set. 
I support H. Res. 965 because it will allow 
the House to do the People’s business in a 
thoughtful and safe way. 
We are in the midst of the unprecedented 
crisis—we cannot operate as if things are 
business as usual when all the science tells 
us that ‘‘business as usual’’ could mean hun-
dreds of Members, staff, and employees of the 
Capitol get sick. 
We need to change how the People’s 
House operates until we ensure that America’s 
frontline workers have access to adequate 
testing and PPE—and then can provide that 
same access to Members, staff, and Capitol 
employees. 
Because as we all know—that is the only 
way to dig our way out of this health crisis. 
H. Res. 965 would allow Members to des-
ignate a proxy to cast floor votes if it’s consid-
ered too dangerous to travel to Washington 
and would allow for our Committees to con-
tinue their work in holding hearings and mark-
ing up legislation. 
Over the past two months, Congress has 
passed 4 bills to provide much-needed relief 
to the close to 40 million of newly unemployed 
Americans, and the 1.45 million Americans 
that have tested positive for COVID–19. 
Despite what my friends on the other side of 
the aisle say, Congress is working and will 
continue to work to meet the health and eco-
nomic challenge in front of us. 
H. Res. 965 gives us the ability to do that 
as we fervently do what is necessary to en-
sure this health emergency passes. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposi-
tion to this usurpation of the rights and re-
sponsibilities of the members of Congress. 
And I emphasize the responsibilities of every 
member of Congress to do the job they were 
elected to do. I agree with my colleague from 
Arkansas Mr. Westerman. If you are not able 
to do the job you should consider stepping 
aside and letting someone else do the job. No 
one in this House is indispensable . . . no 
one. 
One of my Democrat colleagues referred to 
this resolution as our rule, there is not one Re-
publican in support of this resolution . . . it is 
your rule, not our rule. 
I have heard multiple citations of history. 
Here is one I would like to cite. Caesar Rod-
ney was one of the three delegates from Dela-
ware to the Continental Congress. Despite 
suffering from facial cancer and asthma, Rod-
ney rode 80 miles through a severe storm to 
cast his vote for Independence. He did not ask 
one of his Delaware colleagues to be his 
proxy. Despite his condition, he rode all night 
to cast his vote. 
I stand in the spirit of Rodney Caesar and 
all others before us who valued upholding 
their responsibilities above their own self-inter-
est and well-being, to call on all members of 
good faith who value this institution to vote 
‘No’ on this resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 967, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
resolution. 
The question is on the adoption of 
the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.

plement such changes.

may request, and the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services may approve, modifications to a

revenues of an eligible health care provider,

(4) MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE REFORMS.—Sec-
tion 4022 of the CARES Act (15 U.S.C. 9056) is 
amended—

(1), (2), and (3) and inserting the following: 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—During the covered period, 
a borrower with a covered mortgage loan who 
has not obtained automatic forbearance pursu-
ant to this section and who is experiencing a fi-
nancial hardship that prevents the borrower 
from making timely payments on the covered 
mortgage loan due, directly or indirectly, to the 
COVID–19 emergency may request forbearance 
on the loan, regardless of delinquency status, 
by— 
‘‘(A) submitting a request, orally or in writ-
ing, to the servicer of the loan; and 
‘‘(B) affirming that the borrower is experi-
encing a financial hardship that prevents the 
borrower from making timely payments on the 
covered mortgage loan due, directly or indi-
rectly, to the COVID–19 emergency. 
‘‘(2) DURATION OF FORBEARANCE.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Upon a request by a bor-
rower to a servicer for forbearance under para-
graph (1), such forbearance shall be granted by 
the servicer for the period requested by the bor-
rower, up to an initial length of 180 days, the 
length of which shall be extended by the 
servicer, at the request of the borrower for the 
period or periods requested, for a total forbear-
ance period of up to 12-months. 
‘‘(B) MINIMUM FORBEARANCE AMOUNTS.—For 
purposes of granting a forbearance under this 
paragraph, a servicer may grant an initial for-
bearance with a term of not less than 90 days, 
provided that it is automatically extended for an 
additional 90 days unless the servicer confirms 
the borrower does not want to renew the for-
bearance or that the borrower is no longer expe-
riencing a financial hardship that prevents the 
borrower from making timely mortgage pay-
ments due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID– 
19 emergency. 
‘‘(C) RIGHT TO SHORTEN FORBEARANCE.—At a 
borrower’s request, any period of forbearance 
described under this paragraph may be short-
ened. A borrower who makes such a request 
shall be offered a loss mitigation option pursu-
ant to subsection (d) within 30 days of resuming 
regular payments to address any payment defi-
ciency during the forbearance. 
‘‘(3) ACCRUAL
OF
INTEREST
OR
FEES.—A 
servicer shall not charge a borrower any fees, 
penalties, or interest (beyond the amounts 
scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made 
all contractual payments on time and in full 
under the terms of the mortgage contract) in 
connection with a forbearance, provided that a 
servicer may offer the borrower a modification 
option at the end of a forbearance period grant-
ed hereunder that includes the capitalization of 
past due principal and interest and escrow pay-
ments as long as the borrower’s principal and 
interest payment under such modification re-
mains at or below the contractual principal and 
interest payments owed under the terms of the 
mortgage contract before such forbearance pe-
riod except as the result of a change in the 
index of an adjustable rate mortgage. 
‘‘(4) COMMUNICATION
WITH
SERVICERS.—Any 
communication between a borrower and a 
servicer described under this section may be 
made in writing or orally, at the borrower’s 
choice. 
‘‘(5) COMMUNICATION WITH BORROWERS WITH A 
DISABILITY.—Upon request from a borrower, 
servicers shall communicate with borrowers who 
have a disability in the borrower’s preferred 
method of communication. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term ‘disability’ has the meaning 
given that term in the Fair Housing Act, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.’’; and 
(B) in subsection (c), by amending paragraph 
(1) to read as follows: 
‘‘(1) 
NO
DOCUMENTATION
REQUIRED.—A 
servicer of a covered mortgage loan shall not re-
quire any documentation with respect to a for-
bearance under this section other than the bor-
rower’s affirmation (oral or written) to a finan-
cial hardship that prevents the borrower from 
making timely payments on the covered mort-
gage loan due, directly or indirectly, to the 
COVID–19 emergency. An oral request for for-
bearance and oral affirmation of hardship by 
the borrower shall be sufficient for the borrower 
to obtain or extend a forbearance.’’.

days, but only where the forbearance was pro-
vided in response to a borrower’s request for for-
bearance or when an automatic forbearance was 
initially provided under paragraph (9) or (10), 
and not when an existing forbearance is auto-
matically extended, the servicer shall provide 
the borrower with a notice in accordance with 
the terms in paragraph (5).

extended, including by automatic extension, a 
servicer shall, no later than 30 days before the

subsection (c)(2), including incurring or charg-
ing to a borrower any fees or corporate ad-
vances related to a foreclosure, the servicer 
shall, in writing— 
‘‘(A) offer the borrower a loss mitigation op-
tion, without the charging of any fees or pen-
alties other than interest, such that the bor-
rower’s principal and interest payment remains 
the same as it was prior to the forbearance, sub-
ject to any adjustment of the index pursuant to 
the terms of an adjustable rate mortgage, and

‘‘(i) defers the payment of total arrearages, in-
cluding any escrow advances, to the end of the

or collection of any additional interest on the 
deferred amounts; or 
‘‘(ii) extends the term of the mortgage loan, 
and capitalizes, defers, or forgives all escrow ad-
vances and other arrearages; 
provided, however, that the servicer may offer 
the borrower a loss mitigation option that re-
duces the principal and interest payment on the 
loan and capitalizes, defers, or forgives all es-
crow advances or arrearages if the servicer has 
information indicating that the borrower cannot 
resume the pre-forbearance mortgage payments; 
and 
‘‘(B) concurrent with the loss mitigation offer 
in subparagraph (A), notify the borrower that 
the borrower has the right to be evaluated for 
other loss mitigation options if the borrower is 
not able to make the payment under the option 
offered in subparagraph (A). 
‘‘(3) EVALUATION FOR LOSS MITIGATION PRIOR 
TO FORECLOSURE INITIATION.—Before a servicer 
may initiate or engage in any foreclosure activ-
ity listed in subsection (c)(2), including incur-
ring or charging to a borrower any fees or cor-
porate advances related to a foreclosure on the 
basis that the borrower has failed to perform 
under the loss mitigation offer in paragraph

offered, including a failure to accept the loss 
mitigation 
offer

mitted a complete application that the servicer is 
reviewing—

uments and information, if any, needed by the

borrower for all available loss mitigation op-
tions;

the documents and information needed to com-
plete the borrower’s loss mitigation application;

if, despite the servicer’s exercise of reasonable 
diligence, the loss mitigation application re-
mains incomplete sixty days after the notice in 
paragraph (2)(A) is sent, conduct an evaluation 
of the complete or incomplete loss mitigation ap-
plication without reference to whether the bor-
rower has previously submitted a complete loss 
mitigation application and offer the borrower all 
available loss mitigation options for which the 
borrower qualifies under applicable investor 
guidelines, including guidelines regarding re-
quired documentation. 
‘‘(4) EFFECT ON FUTURE REQUESTS FOR LOSS 
MITIGATION REVIEW.—An application, offer, or 
evaluation for loss mitigation under this section 
shall not be the basis for the denial of a bor-
rower’s application as duplicative or for a re-
duction in the borrower’s appeal rights under 
Regulation X (12 C.F.R. 1024) in regard to any 
loss mitigation application submitted after the 
servicer has complied with the requirements of 
paragraphs (2) and (3). 
‘‘(5) SAFE HARBOR.—Any loss mitigation op-
tion authorized by the Federal National Mort-
gage Association, the Federal Home Loan Cor-
poration, or the Federal Housing Administration

ing or collection of any additional interest on 
the deferred amounts, or

GENERAL.—For a covered mortgage 
loan which is also a federally-insured reverse 
mortgage loan, a servicer’s conduct shall be

payable due to a property charge default, the 
mortgagee shall, as a precondition to sending a 
due and payable request to the Secretary or ini-
tiating or continuing a foreclosure process— 
‘‘(i) make a good faith effort to communicate 
with the borrower regarding available home re-
tention options to cure the property charge de-
fault, including encouraging the borrower to 
apply for home retention options; and

home retention options as allowed by the Sec-
retary.

PLANS.—The 
Secretary shall amend its allowable home reten-
tion options to permit a repayment plan of up to

ment plans.

The Secretary may not curtail interest paid to 
mortgagees who engage in loss mitigation or 
home retention actions through interest curtail-
ment during such loss mitigation or home reten-
tion review or during the period when a loss 
mitigation or home retention plan is in effect 
and ending 90 days after any such plan termi-

encing homelessness, and individuals at risk of 
homelessness have the resources they need to

income because of the pandemic and who face 
serious delinquency or home loan default, or are 
in foreclosing proceedings during this period; 
and

Mitigation Counseling program revealed that 
homeowners at risk of or facing foreclosure are 
better served when they have access to a hous-
ing counselor and a range of tools and resources 
to help them avoid losing their home and have 
the support they need to tailor the best possible 
response to their situation.

TITLE VII—COVID–19 COMPASSION AND 
MARTHA WRIGHT PRISON PHONE JUSTICE 
SEC. 130701. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Prison, jails, and other confinement facili-
ties in the United States have unique tele-
communications needs due to safety and secu-
rity concerns. 
(2) Unjust and unreasonable charges for tele-
phone and advanced communications services in 
confinement facilities negatively impact the 
safety and security of communities in the 
United States by damaging relationships be-
tween incarcerated persons and their support 
systems, thereby exacerbating recidivism. 
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has greatly in-
tensified these concerns. Jails and prisons have 
become epicenters for the spread of the virus, 
with incarcerated persons concentrated in small, 
confined spaces and often without access to 
adequate health care. At Cook County jail 
alone, hundreds of incarcerated persons and jail 
staff have tested positive for the virus since its 
outbreak. 
(4) To prevent the spread of the virus, many 
jails and prisons across the country suspended 
public visitation, leaving confinement facility 
communications services as the only way that 
incarcerated persons can stay in touch with 
their families. 
(5) All people in the United States, including 
anyone who pays for confinement facility com-
munications services, should have access to com-
munications services at charges that are just 
and reasonable. 
(6) Unemployment has risen sharply as a re-
sult of the COVID–19 pandemic, straining the 
incomes of millions of Americans and making it 
even more difficult for families of incarcerated 
persons to pay the high costs of confinement fa-
cility communications services. 
(7) Certain markets for confinement facility 
communications services are distorted due to re-
verse competition, in which the financial inter-
ests of the entity making the buying decision 
(the confinement facility) are aligned with the 
seller (the provider of confinement facility com-
munications services) and not the consumer (the 
incarcerated person or a member of his or her 
family). This reverse competition occurs because 
site commission payments to the confinement fa-
cility from the provider of confinement facility 
communications services are the chief criterion 
many facilities use to select their provider of 
confinement facility communications services. 
(8) Charges for confinement facility commu-
nications services that have been shown to be

unjust and unreasonable are often a result of 
site commission payments that far exceed the 
costs incurred by the confinement facility in ac-
commodating these services. 
(9) Unjust and unreasonable charges have 
been assessed for both audio and video services 
and for both intrastate and interstate commu-
nications from confinement facilities. 
(10) Though Congress enacted emergency leg-
islation to allow free communications in Federal 
prisons during the pandemic, it does not cover 
communications to or from anyone incarcerated 
in State and local prisons or jails. 
(11) Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed led a campaign 
for just communications rates for incarcerated 
people for over a decade. 
(12) Mrs. Wright-Reed was the lead plaintiff 
in Wright v. Corrections Corporation of Amer-
ica, CA No. 00–293 (GK) (D.D.C. 2001). 
(13) That case ultimately led to the Wright Pe-
tition at the Federal Communications Commis-
sion, CC Docket No. 96–128 (November 3, 2003). 
(14) As a grandmother, Mrs. Wright-Reed was 
forced to choose between purchasing medication 
and 
communicating 
with 
her 
incarcerated 
grandson. 
(15) Mrs. Wright-Reed passed away on Janu-
ary 18, 2015, before fully realizing her dream of 
just communications rates for all people.

(a) AMENDMENT
TO
THE EMPLOYEE RETIRE-
MENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Title I of the Employee Re-

the following: 
‘‘PART 8—COMPOSITE PLANS AND LEGACY 
PLANS 
‘‘SEC. 801. COMPOSITE PLAN DEFINED. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this Act, 
the term ‘composite plan’ means a pension 
plan— 
‘‘(1) which is a multiemployer plan that is nei-
ther a defined benefit plan nor a defined con-
tribution plan; 
‘‘(2) the terms of which provide that the plan 
is a composite plan for purposes of this title 
with respect to which not more than one multi-
employer defined benefit plan is treated as a leg-
acy plan within the meaning of section 805, un-
less there is more than one legacy plan following 
a merger of composite plans under section 806; 
‘‘(3) which provides systematically for the 
payment of benefits— 
‘‘(A) objectively calculated pursuant to a for-
mula enumerated in the plan document with re-
spect to plan participants after retirement, for

mediately distributed without the consent of the 
participant; 
‘‘(4) for which the plan contributions for the 
first plan year are at least 120 percent of the 
normal cost for the plan year; 
‘‘(5) which requires— 
‘‘(A) an annual valuation of the liability of 
the plan as of a date within the plan year to

‘‘(B) an annual actuarial determination of the 
plan’s current funded ratio and projected fund-
ed ratio under section 802(a); 
‘‘(C) corrective action through a realignment

pant describing the participant’s benefits under 
the plan and explaining that such benefits may 
be subject to reduction under a realignment pro-
gram pursuant to section 803 based on the 
plan’s funded status in future plan years; and 
‘‘(6) the board of trustees of which includes at 
least one retiree or beneficiary in pay status 
during each plan year following the first plan 
year in which at least 5 percent of the partici-
pants in the plan are retirees or beneficiaries in 
pay status. 
‘‘(b) TRANSITION FROM A MULTIEMPLOYER DE-
FINED BENEFIT PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a de-
fined benefit plan that is a multiemployer plan 
may, subject to paragraph (2), amend the plan 
to incorporate the features of a composite plan 
as a component of the multiemployer plan sepa-
rate from the defined benefit plan component, 
except in the case of a defined benefit plan for 
which the plan actuary has certified under sec-
tion 305(b)(3) that the plan is or will be in crit-
ical status for the plan year in which such 
amendment would become effective or for any of 
the succeeding 5 plan years. 
‘‘(2) REQUIREMENTS.—Any amendment pursu-
ant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the features 
of a composite plan as a component of a multi-
employer plan shall— 
‘‘(A) apply with respect to all collective bar-
gaining agreements providing for contributions 
to the multiemployer plan on or after the effec-
tive date of the amendment; 
‘‘(B) apply with respect to all participants in 
the multiemployer plan for whom contributions 
are made to the multiemployer plan on or after 
the effective date of the amendment; 
‘‘(C) specify that the effective date of the 
amendment is— 
‘‘(i) the first day of a specified plan year fol-
lowing the date of the adoption of the amend-
ment, except that the plan sponsor may alter-
natively provide for a separate effective date 
with respect to each collective bargaining agree-
ment under which contributions to the multiem-
ployer plan are required, which shall occur on 
the first day of the first plan year beginning 
after the termination, or if earlier, the re-open-
ing, of each such agreement, or such earlier date 
as the parties to the agreement and the plan 
sponsor of the multiemployer plan shall agree 
to; and 
‘‘(ii) not later than the first day of the fifth 
plan year beginning on or after the date of the 
adoption of the amendment; 
‘‘(D) specify that, as of the amendment’s ef-
fective date, no further benefits shall accrue 
under the defined benefit component of the mul-
tiemployer plan; and 
‘‘(E) specify that, as of the amendment’s effec-
tive date, the plan sponsor of the multiemployer 
plan shall be the plan sponsor of both the com-
posite plan component and the defined benefit 
plan component of the plan. 
‘‘(3) SPECIAL RULES.—If a multiemployer plan 
is amended pursuant to paragraph (1)— 
‘‘(A) the requirements of this title and title IV 
shall be applied to the composite plan compo-
nent and the defined benefit plan component of 
the multiemployer plan as if each such compo-
nent were maintained as a separate plan; and 
‘‘(B) the assets of the composite plan compo-
nent and the defined benefit plan component of 
the plan shall be held in a single trust forming 
part of the plan under which the trust instru-
ment expressly provides— 
‘‘(i) for separate accounts (and appropriate 
records) to be maintained to reflect the interest 
which each of the plan components has in the 
trust, including separate accounting for addi-
tions to the trust for the benefit of each plan 
component, disbursements made from each plan 
component’s account in the trust, investment ex-
perience of the trust allocable to that account, 
and administrative expenses (whether direct ex-
penses or shared expenses allocated proportion-
ally), and permits, but does not require, the 
pooling of some or all of the assets of the two 
plan components for investment purposes; and 
‘‘(ii) that the assets of each of the two plan 
components shall be held, invested, reinvested, 
managed, administered and distributed for the 
exclusive benefit of the participants and bene-
ficiaries of each such plan component, and in 
no event shall the assets of one of the plan com-
ponents be available to pay benefits due under 
the other plan component. 
‘‘(4) NOT
A
TERMINATION
EVENT.—Notwith-
standing section 4041A, an amendment pursuant 
to paragraph (1) to incorporate the features of 
a composite plan as a component of a multiem-
ployer plan does not constitute termination of 
the multiemployer plan. 
‘‘(5) NOTICE TO THE SECRETARY.— 
‘‘(A) NOTICE.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall provide notice to the Secretary 
of the intent to establish the composite plan (or, 
in the case of a composite plan incorporated as 
a component of a multiemployer plan as de-
scribed in paragraph (1), the intent to amend 
the multiemployer plan to incorporate such com-
posite plan) at least 30 days prior to the effec-
tive date of such establishment or amendment. 
‘‘(B) CERTIFICATION.—In the case of a com-
posite plan incorporated as a component of a 
multiemployer plan as described in paragraph 
(1), such notice shall include a certification by 
the plan actuary under section 305(b)(3) that 
the effective date of the amendment occurs in a 
plan year for which the multiemployer plan is 
not in critical status for that plan year and any 
of the succeeding 5 plan years. 
‘‘(6) REFERENCES TO COMPOSITE PLAN COMPO-
NENT.—As used in this part, the term ‘composite 
plan’ includes a composite plan component 
added to a defined benefit plan pursuant to 
paragraph (1). 
‘‘(7) 
RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph 
(2)(A) shall not be construed as preventing the

(1) because some collective bargaining agree-
ments are amended to cease any covered em-
ployer’s obligation to contribute to the multiem-
ployer plan before or after the plan amendment 
is effective. Paragraph (2)(B) shall not be con-
strued as preventing the plan sponsor of a mul-
tiemployer plan from adopting an amendment 
pursuant to paragraph (1) because some partici-
pants cease to have contributions made to the 
multiemployer plan on their behalf before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. 
‘‘(c) COORDINATION WITH FUNDING RULES.— 
Except as otherwise provided in this title, sec-
tions 302, 304, and 305 shall not apply to a com-
posite plan. 
‘‘(d) TREATMENT OF A COMPOSITE PLAN.—For 
purposes of this Act (other than sections 302 and 
4245), a composite plan shall be treated as if it 
were a defined benefit plan unless a different 
treatment is provided for under applicable law. 
‘‘SEC. 802. FUNDED RATIOS; ACTUARIAL ASSUMP-
TIONS. 
‘‘(a) CERTIFICATION OF FUNDED RATIOS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than the one- 
hundred twentieth day of each plan year of a 
composite plan, the plan actuary of the com-
posite plan shall certify to the Secretary, the 
Secretary of the Treasury, and the plan sponsor 
the plan’s current funded ratio and projected 
funded ratio for the plan year. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
CURRENT
FUNDED 
RATIO AND PROJECTED FUNDED RATIO.—For pur-
poses of this section: 
‘‘(A) CURRENT
FUNDED
RATIO.—The current 
funded ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percent-
age) of— 
‘‘(i) the value of the plan’s assets as of the 
first day of the plan year; to 
‘‘(ii) the plan actuary’s best estimate of the 
present value of the plan liabilities as of the 
first day of the plan year. 
‘‘(B) PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—The pro-
jected funded ratio is the current funded ratio 
projected to the first day of the fifteenth plan 
year following the plan year for which the de-
termination is being made. 
‘‘(3) CONSIDERATION
OF
CONTRIBUTION
RATE 
INCREASES.—For purposes of projections under 
this subsection, the plan sponsor may anticipate 
contribution rate increases beyond the term of 
the current collective bargaining agreement and 
any agreed-to supplements, up to a maximum of 
2.5 percent per year, compounded annually, un-
less it would be unreasonable under the cir-
cumstances to assume that contributions would 
increase by that amount. 
‘‘(b) ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND
METH-
ODS.—For purposes of this part: 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—All costs, liabilities, rates of 
interest and other factors under the plan shall 
be determined for a plan year on the basis of ac-
tuarial assumptions and methods— 
‘‘(A) each of which is reasonable (taking into 
account the experience of the plan and reason-
able expectations); 
‘‘(B) which, in combination, offer the actu-
ary’s best estimate of anticipated experience 
under the plan; and 
‘‘(C) with respect to which any change from 
the actuarial assumptions and methods used in 
the previous plan year shall be certified by the 
plan actuary and the actuarial rationale for 
such change provided in the annual report re-
quired by section 103. 
‘‘(2) FAIR
MARKET
VALUE
OF
ASSETS.—The 
value of the plan’s assets shall be taken into ac-
count on the basis of their fair market value. 
‘‘(3) DETERMINATION
OF
NORMAL
COST
AND 
PLAN LIABILITIES.—A plan’s normal cost and li-
abilities shall be based on the most recent actu-
arial 
valuation 
required 
under 
section 
801(a)(5)(A) and the unit credit funding method. 
‘‘(4) TIME
WHEN
CERTAIN
CONTRIBUTIONS 
DEEMED MADE.—Any contributions for a plan 
year made by an employer after the last day of 
such plan year, but not later than two and one- 
half months after such day, shall be deemed to 
have been made on such last day. For purposes 
of this paragraph, such two and one-half month 
period may be extended for not more than six 
months under regulations prescribed by the Sec-
retary of the Treasury. 
‘‘(5) ADDITIONAL
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS.— 
Except where otherwise provided in this part, 
the provisions of section 305(b)(3)(B) shall apply 
to any determination or projection under this 
part. 
‘‘SEC. 803. REALIGNMENT PROGRAM. 
‘‘(a) REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(1) ADOPTION.—In any case in which the 
plan actuary certifies under section 802(a) that 
the plan’s projected funded ratio is below 120 
percent for the plan year, the plan sponsor shall 
adopt a realignment program under paragraph 
(2) not later than 210 days after the due date of 
the certification required under such section 
802(a). The plan sponsor shall adopt an updated 
realignment program for each succeeding plan 
year for which a certification described in the 
preceding sentence is made. 
‘‘(2) CONTENT OF REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A realignment program 
adopted under this paragraph is a written pro-
gram which consists of all reasonable measures, 
including options or a range of options to be un-
dertaken by the plan sponsor or proposed to the 
bargaining parties, formulated, based on reason-
ably anticipated experience and reasonable ac-
tuarial assumptions, to enable the plan to 
achieve a projected funded ratio of at least 120 
percent for the following plan year. 
‘‘(B) INITIAL
PROGRAM
ELEMENTS.—Reason-
able measures under a realignment program de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) may include any of 
the following: 
‘‘(i) Proposed contribution increases. 
‘‘(ii) A reduction in the rate of future benefit 
accruals, so long as the resulting rate is not less 
than 1 percent of the contributions on which 
benefits are based as of the start of the plan 
year (or the equivalent standard accrual rate as 
described in section 305(e)(6)). 
‘‘(iii) A modification or elimination of adjust-
able benefits of participants that are not in pay 
status before the date of the notice required 
under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(iv) Any other lawfully available measures 
not specifically described in this subparagraph 
or subparagraph (C) or (D) that the plan spon-
sor determines are reasonable. 
‘‘(C) ADDITIONAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—If the 
plan sponsor has determined that all reasonable 
measures available under subparagraph (B) will 
not enable the plan to achieve a projected fund-
ed ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year, such reasonable measures may also 
include— 
‘‘(i) a reduction of accrued benefits that are 
not in pay status by the date of the notice re-
quired under subsection (b)(1); or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of any benefits of partici-
pants that are in pay status before the date of 
the notice required under subsection (b)(1) other 
than core benefits as defined in paragraph (4). 
‘‘(D) ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS.—In the case of 
a composite plan for which the plan sponsor has 
determined that all reasonable measures avail-
able under subparagraphs (B) and (C) will not 
enable the plan to achieve a projected funded 
ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year, such reasonable measures may also 
include— 
‘‘(i) a further reduction in the rate of future 
benefit accruals without regard to the limitation 
applicable under subparagraph (B)(ii); or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of core benefits; 
provided that such reductions shall be equitably 
distributed across the participant and bene-
ficiary population, taking into account factors, 
with respect to participants and beneficiaries 
and their benefits, that may include one or more 
of the factors listed in subclauses (I) through 
(X) of section 305(e)(9)(D)(vi), to the extent nec-
essary to enable the plan to achieve a projected 
funded ratio of at least 120 percent for the fol-
lowing plan year, or at the election of the plan 
sponsor, a projected funded ratio of at least 100 
percent for the following plan year and a cur-
rent funded ratio of at least 90 percent. 
‘‘(3) ADJUSTABLE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For pur-
poses of this part, the term ‘adjustable benefit’ 
means— 
‘‘(A) benefits, rights, and features under the 
plan, including post-retirement death benefits, 
60-month guarantees, disability benefits not yet 
in pay status, and similar benefits; 
‘‘(B) any early retirement benefit or retire-
ment-type subsidy (within the meaning of sec-
tion 204(g)(2)(A)) and any benefit payment op-
tion (other than the qualified joint and survivor 
annuity); and 
‘‘(C) benefit increases that were adopted (or, 
if later, took effect) less than 60 months before 
the first day such realignment program took ef-
fect. 
‘‘(4) CORE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For purposes of 
this part, the term ‘core benefit’ means a partici-
pant’s accrued benefit payable in the normal 
form of an annuity commencing at normal re-
tirement age, determined without regard to— 
‘‘(A) any early retirement benefits, retirement- 
type subsidies, or other benefits, rights, or fea-
tures that may be associated with that benefit; 
and 
‘‘(B) any cost-of-living adjustments or benefit 
increases effective after the date of retirement. 
‘‘(5) COORDINATION
WITH
CONTRIBUTION
IN-
CREASES.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A realignment program 
may provide that some or all of the benefit modi-
fications described in the program will only take 
effect if the bargaining parties fail to agree to 
specified levels of increases in contributions to 
the plan, effective as of specified dates. 
‘‘(B) INDEPENDENT BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes to 
the benefit formula that are independent of po-
tential contribution increases, such changes 
shall take effect not later than 180 days after 
the first day of the first plan year that begins 
following the adoption of the realignment pro-
gram. 
‘‘(C) CONDITIONAL BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes to 
the benefit formula that take effect only if the 
bargaining parties fail to agree to contribution 
increases, such changes shall take effect not 
later than the first day of the first plan year be-
ginning after the third anniversary of the date 
of adoption of the realignment program. 
‘‘(D) REVOCATION OF CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Benefit modifications described in 
subparagraph (C) may be revoked, in whole or 
in part, and retroactively or prospectively, when 
contributions to the plan are increased, as speci-
fied in the realignment program, including any 
amendments thereto. The preceding sentence 
shall not apply unless the contribution increases 
are to be effective not later than the fifth anni-
versary of the first day of the first plan year 
that begins after the adoption of the realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(b) NOTICE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which it is 
certified under section 802(a) that the projected 
funded ratio is less than 120 percent, the plan 
sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the 
date of the certification, provide notification of 
the current and projected funded ratios to the 
participants and beneficiaries, the bargaining 
parties, and the Secretary. Such notice shall in-
clude— 
‘‘(A) an explanation that contribution rate in-
creases or benefit reductions may be necessary; 
‘‘(B) a description of the types of benefits that 
might be reduced; and 
‘‘(C) an estimate of the contribution increases 
and benefit reductions that may be necessary to 
achieve a projected funded ratio of 120 percent. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—No modifications may be 
made that reduce the rate of future benefit ac-
crual or that reduce core benefits or adjustable

‘‘SEC. 804. LIMITATION ON INCREASING BENE-
FITS. 
‘‘(a) LEVEL OF CURRENT FUNDED RATIOS.—Ex-
cept as provided in subsections (c), (d), and (e), 
no plan amendment increasing benefits or estab-
lishing new benefits under a composite plan may 
be adopted for a plan year unless— 
‘‘(1) the plan’s current funded ratio is at least 
110 percent (without regard to the benefit in-
crease or new benefits); 
‘‘(2) taking the benefit increase or new bene-
fits into account, the current funded ratio is at 
least 100 percent and the projected funded ratio 
for the current plan year is at least 120 percent; 
‘‘(3) in any case in which, after taking the 
benefit increase or new benefits into account, 
the current funded ratio is less than 140 percent 
and the projected funded ratio is less than 140 
percent, the benefit increase or new benefits are 
projected by the plan actuary to increase the 
present value of the plan’s liabilities for the 
plan year by not more than 3 percent; and 
‘‘(4) expected contributions for the current 
plan year are at least 120 percent of normal cost 
for the plan year, determined using the unit 
credit funding method and treating the benefit 
increase or new benefits as in effect for the en-
tire plan year. 
‘‘(b) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WHERE CORE 
BENEFITS REDUCED.—If a plan has been amend-
ed to reduce core benefits pursuant to a realign-
ment program under section 803(a)(2)(D), such 
plan may not be subsequently amended to in-
crease core benefits unless the amendment— 
‘‘(1) increases the level of future benefit pay-
ments only; and 
‘‘(2) provides for an equitable distribution of 
benefit increases across the participant and ben-
eficiary population, taking into account the ex-
tent to which the benefits of participants were 
previously reduced pursuant to such realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(c) EXCEPTION TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE 
LAW.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in connec-
tion with a plan amendment if the amendment 
is required as a condition of qualification under 
part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of the Inter-
nal Revenue Code of 1986 or to comply with 
other applicable law. 
‘‘(d) EXCEPTION WHERE MAXIMUM DEDUCT-
IBLE LIMIT APPLIES.—Subsection (a) shall not 
apply in connection with a plan amendment if 
and to the extent that contributions to the com-
posite plan would not be deductible for the plan 
year under section 404(a)(1)(E) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 if the plan amendment is 
not adopted. 
‘‘(e) EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in 
connection with a plan amendment under sec-
tion 803(a)(5)(C), regarding conditional benefit 
modifications. 
‘‘(f) TREATMENT OF PLAN AMENDMENTS.—For 
purposes of this section— 
‘‘(1) if two or more plan amendments increas-
ing benefits or establishing new benefits are 
adopted in a plan year, such amendments shall 
be treated as a single amendment adopted on 
the last day of the plan year; 
‘‘(2) all benefit increases and new benefits 
adopted in a single amendment are treated as a 
single benefit increase, irrespective of whether 
the increases and new benefits take effect in 
more than one plan year; and 
‘‘(3) increases in contributions or decreases in 
plan liabilities which are scheduled to take ef-
fect in future plan years may be taken into ac-
count in connection with a plan amendment if 
they have been agreed to in writing or otherwise 
formalized by the date the plan amendment is 
adopted. 
‘‘SEC. 805. COMPOSITE PLAN RESTRICTIONS TO 
PRESERVE LEGACY PLAN FUNDING. 
‘‘(a) TREATMENT AS A LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this part 
and parts 2 and 3, a defined benefit plan shall 
be treated as a legacy plan with respect to the 
composite plan under which the employees who 
were eligible to accrue a benefit under the de-
fined benefit plan become eligible to accrue a 
benefit under such composite plan. 
‘‘(2) COMPONENT
PLANS.—In any case in 
which a defined benefit plan is amended to add 
a composite plan component pursuant to section 
801(b), paragraph (1) shall be applied by sub-
stituting ‘defined benefit component’ for ‘de-
fined benefit plan’ and ‘composite plan compo-
nent’ for ‘composite plan’. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE
TO
ACCRUE
A
BENEFIT.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is con-
sidered eligible to accrue a benefit under a com-
posite plan as of the first day in which the em-
ployee completes an hour of service under a col-
lective bargaining agreement that provides for 
contributions to and accruals under the com-
posite plan in lieu of accruals under the legacy 
plan. 
‘‘(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.—As 
used in this part, the term ‘collective bargaining 
agreement’ includes any agreement under which 
an employer has an obligation to contribute to 
a plan. 
‘‘(5) OTHER
TERMS.—Any term used in this 
part which is not defined in this part and which 
is also used in section 305 shall have the same 
meaning provided such term in such section. 
‘‘(b) RESTRICTIONS ON ACCEPTANCE BY COM-
POSITE PLAN
OF AGREEMENTS
AND CONTRIBU-
TIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall not accept or recognize a col-
lective bargaining agreement (or any modifica-
tion to such agreement), and no contributions 
may be accepted and no benefits may be accrued 
or otherwise earned under the agreement— 
‘‘(A) in any case in which the plan actuary of 
any defined benefit plan that would be treated 
as a legacy plan with respect to such composite 
plan has certified under section 305(b)(3) that 
such defined benefit plan is or will be in critical 
status for the plan year in which such agree-
ment would take effect or for any of the suc-
ceeding 5 plan years; and 
‘‘(B) unless the agreement requires each em-
ployer who is a party to such agreement, includ-
ing employers whose employees are not partici-
pants in the legacy plan, to provide contribu-
tions to the legacy plan with respect to such 
composite plan in a manner that satisfies the 
transition contribution requirements of sub-
section (d). 
‘‘(2) NOTICE.—Not later than 30 days after a 
determination by a plan sponsor of a composite 
plan that an agreement fails to satisfy the re-
quirements described in paragraph (1), the plan 
sponsor shall provide notification of such fail-
ure and the reasons for such determination— 
‘‘(A) to the parties to the agreement;

employer, under a collective bargaining agree-
ment entered into after the date of enactment of 
the Giving Retirement Options to Workers Act of 
2020, ceases to have an obligation to contribute 
to a multiemployer defined benefit plan, no em-
ployees employed by the employer may accrue or 
otherwise earn benefits under any composite 
plan, with respect to service with that employer, 
for a 60-month period beginning on the date on 
which the employer entered into such collective 
bargaining agreement. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.— 
Within 30 days of determining that an employer 
has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to 
a legacy plan with respect to employees em-
ployed by an employer that is or will be contrib-
uting to a composite plan with respect to service 
of such employees, the plan sponsor of the leg-
acy plan shall notify the plan sponsor of the 
composite plan of that cessation. 
‘‘(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.—Not 
later than 30 days after determining that an em-
ployer has ceased to have an obligation to con-
tribute to a legacy plan, the plan sponsor of the

ties, the active participants affected by the ces-
sation of accruals, the Secretary, the Secretary 
of the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guar-
anty Corporation of the cessation of accruals,

TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION
REQUIRE-
MENTS.—

GENERAL.—A collective bargaining 
agreement satisfies the transition contribution 
requirements of this subsection if the agree-
ment— 
‘‘(A) authorizes payment of contributions to a 
legacy plan at a rate or rates equal to or greater

by the legacy plan under paragraph (2); and 
‘‘(B) does not provide for— 
‘‘(i) a suspension of contributions to the leg-
acy plan with respect to any period of service; 
or 
‘‘(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of 
younger or newly hired employees of the em-
ployer from being taken into account in deter-
mining contributions owed to the legacy plan.

‘‘(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan year; 
‘‘(ii) to amortize the plan’s unfunded liabil-
ities in level annual installments over 25 years, 
beginning with the plan year in which the tran-
sition contribution rate is first established; and 
‘‘(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes in 
the legacy plan’s unfunded liability due to expe-
rience gains or losses (including investment 
gains or losses, gains or losses due to contribu-
tions greater or less than the contributions made 
under the prior transition contribution rate, and 
other actuarial gains or losses), changes in ac-
tuarial assumptions, changes to the legacy 
plan’s benefits, or changes in funding method 
over a period of 15 plan years beginning with 
the plan year in which such change in un-
funded liability is incurred. 
The transition contribution rate for any plan 
year may not be less than the transition con-
tribution rate for the plan year in which such 
rate is first established. 
‘‘(B) MULTIPLE RATES.—If different rates of 
contribution are payable to the legacy plan by 
different employers or for different classes of 
employees, the certification shall specify a tran-
sition contribution rate for each such employer. 
‘‘(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided by 
clause (ii), the transition contribution rate ap-
plicable to an employer for a plan year is the 
rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy 
plan that commences on or after 180 days before 
the earlier of— 
‘‘(I) the effective date of the collective bar-
gaining agreement pursuant to which the em-
ployer contributes to the legacy plan; or 
‘‘(II) 5 years after the last plan year for which 
the transition contribution rate applicable to the 
employer was established or updated. 
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—The transition contribution 
rate applicable to an employer for the first plan 
year beginning on or after the commencement of 
the employer’s obligation to contribute to the 
composite plan is the rate in effect for the plan 
year of the legacy plan that commences on or 
after 180 days before such first plan year. 
‘‘(D) EFFECT OF LEGACY PLAN FINANCIAL CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—If the plan actuary of the legacy 
plan has certified under section 305 that the 
plan is in endangered or critical status for a 
plan year, the transition contribution rate for 
the following plan year is the rate determined 
with respect to the employer under the legacy 
plan’s funding improvement or rehabilitation 
plan under section 305, if greater than the rate 
otherwise determined, but in no event greater 
than 75 percent of the sum of the contribution 
rates applicable to the legacy plan and the com-
posite plan for the plan year. 
‘‘(E) OTHER
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND 
METHODS.—Except as provided in subparagraph 
(A), the determination of the transition con-
tribution rate for a plan year shall be based on 
actuarial assumptions and methods consistent 
with the minimum funding determinations made 
under section 304 (or, if applicable, section 305) 
with respect to the legacy plan for the plan 
year. 
‘‘(F) ADJUSTMENTS IN RATE.—The plan spon-
sor of a legacy plan from time to time may ad-
just the transition contribution rate or rates ap-
plicable to an employer under this paragraph by 
increasing some rates and decreasing others if 
the actuary certifies that such adjusted rates in 
combination will produce projected contribution 
income for the plan year beginning on or after 
the date of certification that is not less than 
would be produced by the transition contribu-
tion rates in effect at the time of the certifi-
cation. 
‘‘(G) NOTICE
OF
TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION 
RATE.—The plan sponsor of a legacy plan shall 
provide notice to the parties to collective bar-
gaining agreements pursuant to which contribu-
tions are made to the legacy plan of changes to 
the transition contribution rate requirements at 
least 30 days before the beginning of the plan 
year for which the rate is effective. 
‘‘(H) NOTICE TO COMPOSITE PLAN SPONSOR.— 
Not later than 30 days after a determination by 
the plan sponsor of a legacy plan that a collec-
tive bargaining agreement provides for a rate of 
contributions that is below the transition con-
tribution rate applicable to one or more employ-
ers that are parties to the collective bargaining 
agreement, the plan sponsor of the legacy plan 
shall notify the plan sponsor of any composite 
plan under which employees of such employer 
would otherwise be eligible to accrue a benefit. 
‘‘(3) CORRECTION
PROCEDURES.—Pursuant to 
standards prescribed by the Secretary, the plan 
sponsor of a composite plan shall adopt rules 
and procedures that give the parties to the col-
lective bargaining agreement notice of the fail-
ure of such agreement to satisfy the transition 
contribution requirements of this subsection, 
and a reasonable opportunity to correct such 
failure, not to exceed 180 days from the date of 
notice given under subsection (b)(2). 
‘‘(4) SUPPLEMENTAL
CONTRIBUTIONS.—A col-
lective bargaining agreement may provide for 
supplemental contributions to the legacy plan 
for a plan year in excess of the transition con-
tribution rate determined under paragraph (2), 
regardless of whether the legacy plan is in en-
dangered or critical status for such plan year. 
‘‘(e) NONAPPLICATION OF COMPOSITE PLAN RE-
STRICTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The provisions of sub-
sections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply with re-
spect to a collective bargaining agreement, to 
the extent the agreement, or a predecessor 
agreement, provides or provided for contribu-
tions to a defined benefit plan that is a legacy 
plan, as of the first day of the first plan year 
following a plan year for which the plan actu-
ary certifies that the plan is fully funded, has 
been fully funded for at least three out of the 
immediately preceding 5 plan years, and is pro-
jected to remain fully funded for at least the fol-
lowing 4 plan years. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
FULLY
FUNDED.—A 
plan is fully funded for purposes of paragraph 
(1) if, as of the valuation date of the plan for a 
plan year, the value of the plan’s assets equals 
or exceeds the present value of the plan’s liabil-
ities, determined in accordance with the rules 
prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation under sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 
4281 for multiemployer plans terminating by 
mass withdrawal, as in effect for the date of the 
determination, except the plan’s reasonable as-
sumption regarding the starting date of benefits 
may be used. 
‘‘(3) OTHER
APPLICABLE
RULES.—Except as 
provided in paragraph (2), actuarial determina-
tions and projections under this section shall be 
based on the rules in section 305(b)(3) and sec-
tion 802(b). 
‘‘SEC. 806. MERGERS AND ASSET TRANSFERS OF 
COMPOSITE PLANS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Assets and liabilities of a 
composite plan may only be merged with, or 
transferred to, another plan if— 
‘‘(1) the other plan is a composite plan; 
‘‘(2) the plan or plans resulting from the merg-
er or transfer is a composite plan; 
‘‘(3) no participant’s accrued benefit or ad-
justable benefit is lower immediately after the 
transaction than it was immediately before the 
transaction; and 
‘‘(4) the value of the assets transferred in the 
case of a transfer reasonably reflects the value 
of the amounts contributed with respect to the 
participants whose benefits are being trans-
ferred, adjusted for allocable distributions, in-
vestment gains and losses, and administrative 
expenses. 
‘‘(b) LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—After a merger or transfer 
involving a composite plan, the legacy plan with 
respect to an employer that is obligated to con-
tribute to the resulting composite plan is the leg-
acy plan that applied to that employer imme-
diately before the merger or transfer. 
‘‘(2) MULTIPLE LEGACY PLANS.—If an employer 
is obligated to contribute to more than one leg-
acy plan with respect to employees eligible to 
accrue benefits under more than one composite 
plan and there is a merger or transfer of such 
legacy plans, the transition contribution rate 
applicable to the legacy plan resulting from the 
merger or transfer with respect to that employer 
shall be determined in accordance with the pro-
visions of section 805(d)(2)(B).’’. 
(2) PENALTIES.— 
(A) CIVIL ENFORCEMENT OF FAILURE TO COM-
PLY
WITH
REALIGNMENT
PROGRAM.—Section

803, if the plan sponsor— 
‘‘(A) has not adopted a realignment program 
under that section by the deadline established 
in such section; or 
‘‘(B) fails to update or comply with the terms 
of the realignment program in accordance with 
the requirements of such section, 
by the Secretary, by an employer that has an 
obligation to contribute with respect to the com-
posite plan, or by an employee organization that 
represents active participants in the composite 
plan, for an order compelling the plan sponsor 
to adopt a realignment program, or to update or 
comply with the terms of the realignment pro-
gram, in accordance with the requirements of 
such section and the realignment program.’’. 
(B) CIVIL PENALTIES.—Section 502(c) of such 
Act (29 U.S.C. 1132(c)) is amended— 
(i) by moving paragraphs (8), (10), and (12) 
each 2 ems to the left; 
(ii) by redesignating paragraphs (9) through 
(12) as paragraphs (12) through (15), respec-

penalty of not more than $100 per day for each 
violation by such sponsor of the requirement 
under section 803(b) to provide notice as de-
scribed in such section, except that no penalty 
may be assessed in any case in which the plan 
sponsor exercised reasonable diligence to meet 
the requirements of such section and— 
‘‘(i) the plan sponsor did not know that the 
violation existed; or 
‘‘(ii) the plan sponsor provided such notice 
during the 30-day period beginning on the first 
date on which the plan sponsor knew, or in ex-
ercising reasonable due diligence should have 
known, that such violation existed. 
‘‘(B) In any case in which the plan sponsor 
exercised reasonable diligence to meet the re-
quirements of section 803(b)— 
‘‘(i) the total penalty assessed under this 
paragraph against such sponsor for a plan year 
may not exceed $500,000; and 
‘‘(ii) the Secretary may waive part or all of 
such penalty to the extent that the payment of 
such penalty would be excessive or otherwise in-
equitable relative to the violation involved.

of not more than $100 per day for each violation 
by such sponsor of the notice requirements

posite plan component and the defined benefit 
plan component of the plan. 
‘‘(3) SPECIAL RULES.—If a multiemployer plan 
is amended pursuant to paragraph (1)— 
‘‘(A) the requirements of this title shall be ap-
plied to the composite plan component and the 
defined benefit plan component of the multiem-
ployer plan as if each such component were 
maintained as a separate plan, and 
‘‘(B) the assets of the composite plan compo-
nent and the defined benefit plan component of 
the plan shall be held in a single trust forming 
part of the plan under which the trust instru-
ment expressly provides— 
‘‘(i) for separate accounts (and appropriate 
records) to be maintained to reflect the interest 
which each of the plan components has in the 
trust, including separate accounting for addi-
tions to the trust for the benefit of each plan 
component, disbursements made from each plan 
component’s account in the trust, investment ex-
perience of the trust allocable to that account, 
and administrative expenses (whether direct ex-
penses or shared expenses allocated proportion-
ally), and permits, but does not require, the 
pooling of some or all of the assets of the two 
plan components for investment purposes, and 
‘‘(ii) that the assets of each of the two plan 
components shall be held, invested, reinvested, 
managed, administered and distributed for the 
exclusive benefit of the participants and bene-
ficiaries of each such plan component, and in 
no event shall the assets of one of the plan com-
ponents be available to pay benefits due under 
the other plan component. 
‘‘(4) NOT
A
TERMINATION
EVENT.—Notwith-
standing section 4041A of the Employee Retire-
ment Income Security Act of 1974, an amend-
ment pursuant to paragraph (1) to incorporate 
the features of a composite plan as a component 
of a multiemployer plan does not constitute ter-
mination of the multiemployer plan. 
‘‘(5) NOTICE TO THE SECRETARY.— 
‘‘(A) NOTICE.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall provide notice to the Secretary 
of the intent to establish the composite plan (or, 
in the case of a composite plan incorporated as 
a component of a multiemployer plan as de-
scribed in paragraph (1), the intent to amend 
the multiemployer plan to incorporate such com-
posite plan) at least 30 days prior to the effec-
tive date of such establishment or amendment. 
‘‘(B) CERTIFICATION.—In the case of a com-
posite plan incorporated as a component of a 
multiemployer plan as described in paragraph 
(1), such notice shall include a certification by 
the plan actuary under section 432(b)(3) that 
the effective date of the amendment occurs in a 
plan year for which the multiemployer plan is 
not in critical status for that plan year and any 
of the succeeding 5 plan years. 
‘‘(6) REFERENCES TO COMPOSITE PLAN COMPO-
NENT.—As used in this subpart, the term ‘com-
posite plan’ includes a composite plan compo-
nent added to a defined benefit plan pursuant 
to paragraph (1). 
‘‘(7) 
RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph 
(2)(A) shall not be construed as preventing the 
plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan from 
adopting an amendment pursuant to paragraph 
(1) because some collective bargaining agree-
ments are amended to cease any covered em-
ployer’s obligation to contribute to the multiem-
ployer plan before or after the plan amendment 
is effective. Paragraph (2)(B) shall not be con-
strued as preventing the plan sponsor of a mul-
tiemployer plan from adopting an amendment 
pursuant to paragraph (1) because some partici-
pants cease to have contributions made to the 
multiemployer plan on their behalf before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. 
‘‘(c) COORDINATION WITH FUNDING RULES.— 
Except as otherwise provided in this title, sec-
tions 412, 431, and 432 shall not apply to a com-
posite plan. 
‘‘(d) TREATMENT OF A COMPOSITE PLAN.—For 
purposes of this title (other than sections 412 
and 418E), a composite plan shall be treated as 
if it were a defined benefit plan unless a dif-
ferent treatment is provided for under applicable 
law. 
‘‘SEC. 438. FUNDED RATIOS; ACTUARIAL ASSUMP-
TIONS. 
‘‘(a) CERTIFICATION OF FUNDED RATIOS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than the one- 
hundred twentieth day of each plan year of a 
composite plan, the plan actuary of the com-
posite plan shall certify to the Secretary, the 
Secretary of Labor, and the plan sponsor the 
plan’s current funded ratio and projected fund-
ed ratio for the plan year. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
CURRENT
FUNDED 
RATIO AND PROJECTED FUNDED RATIO.—For pur-
poses of this section— 
‘‘(A) CURRENT
FUNDED
RATIO.—The current 
funded ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percent-
age) of— 
‘‘(i) the value of the plan’s assets as of the 
first day of the plan year, to 
‘‘(ii) the plan actuary’s best estimate of the 
present value of the plan liabilities as of the 
first day of the plan year. 
‘‘(B) PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—The pro-
jected funded ratio is the current funded ratio 
projected to the first day of the fifteenth plan 
year following the plan year for which the de-
termination is being made. 
‘‘(3) CONSIDERATION
OF
CONTRIBUTION
RATE 
INCREASES.—For purposes of projections under 
this subsection, the plan sponsor may anticipate 
contribution rate increases beyond the term of 
the current collective bargaining agreement and 
any agreed-to supplements, up to a maximum of 
2.5 percent per year, compounded annually, un-
less it would be unreasonable under the cir-
cumstances to assume that contributions would 
increase by that amount. 
‘‘(b) ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND
METH-
ODS.—For purposes of this part— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—All costs, liabilities, rates of 
interest, and other factors under the plan shall

be determined for a plan year on the basis of ac-
tuarial assumptions and methods— 
‘‘(A) each of which is reasonable (taking into 
account the experience of the plan and reason-
able expectations), 
‘‘(B) which, in combination, offer the actu-
ary’s best estimate of anticipated experience 
under the plan, and 
‘‘(C) with respect to which any change from 
the actuarial assumptions and methods used in 
the previous plan year shall be certified by the 
plan actuary and the actuarial rationale for 
such change provided in the annual report re-
quired by section 6058. 
‘‘(2) FAIR
MARKET
VALUE
OF
ASSETS.—The 
value of the plan’s assets shall be taken into ac-
count on the basis of their fair market value. 
‘‘(3) DETERMINATION
OF
NORMAL
COST
AND 
PLAN LIABILITIES.—A plan’s normal cost and li-
abilities shall be based on the most recent actu-
arial 
valuation 
required 
under 
section 
437(a)(5)(A) and the unit credit funding method. 
‘‘(4) TIME
WHEN
CERTAIN
CONTRIBUTIONS 
DEEMED MADE.—Any contributions for a plan 
year made by an employer after the last day of 
such plan year, but not later than two and one- 
half months after such day, shall be deemed to 
have been made on such last day. For purposes 
of this paragraph, such two and one-half month 
period may be extended for not more than six 
months under regulations prescribed by the Sec-
retary. 
‘‘(5) ADDITIONAL
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS.— 
Except where otherwise provided in this sub-
part, the provisions of section 432(b)(3)(B) shall 
apply to any determination or projection under 
this subpart. 
‘‘SEC. 439. REALIGNMENT PROGRAM. 
‘‘(a) REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(1) ADOPTION.—In any case in which the 
plan actuary certifies under section 438(a) that 
the plan’s projected funded ratio is below 120 
percent for the plan year, the plan sponsor shall 
adopt a realignment program under paragraph 
(2) not later than 210 days after the due date of 
the certification required under section 438(a). 
The plan sponsor shall adopt an updated re-
alignment program for each succeeding plan 
year for which a certification described in the 
preceding sentence is made. 
‘‘(2) CONTENT OF REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A realignment program 
adopted under this paragraph is a written pro-
gram which consists of all reasonable measures, 
including options or a range of options to be un-
dertaken by the plan sponsor or proposed to the 
bargaining parties, formulated, based on reason-
ably anticipated experience and reasonable ac-
tuarial assumptions, to enable the plan to 
achieve a projected funded ratio of at least 120 
percent for the following plan year. 
‘‘(B) INITIAL
PROGRAM
ELEMENTS.—Reason-
able measures under a realignment program de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) may include any of 
the following: 
‘‘(i) Proposed contribution increases. 
‘‘(ii) A reduction in the rate of future benefit 
accruals, so long as the resulting rate shall not 
be less than 1 percent of the contributions on 
which benefits are based as of the start of the 
plan year (or the equivalent standard accrual 
rate as described in section 432(e)(6)). 
‘‘(iii) A modification or elimination of adjust-
able benefits of participants that are not in pay 
status before the date of the notice required 
under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(iv) Any other legally available measures not 
specifically described in this subparagraph or 
subparagraph (C) or (D) that the plan sponsor 
determines are reasonable. 
‘‘(C) ADDITIONAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—If the 
plan sponsor has determined that all reasonable 
measures available under subparagraph (B) will 
not enable the plan to achieve a projected fund-
ed ratio of at least 120 percent the following 
plan year, such reasonable measures may also 
include— 
‘‘(i) a reduction of accrued benefits that are 
not in pay status by the date of the notice re-
quired under subsection (b)(1), or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of any benefits of partici-
pants that are in pay status before the date of 
the notice required under subsection (b)(1) other 
than core benefits as defined in paragraph (4). 
‘‘(D) ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS.—In the case of 
a composite plan for which the plan sponsor has 
determined that all reasonable measures avail-
able under subparagraphs (B) and (C) will not 
enable the plan to achieve a projected funded 
ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year, such reasonable measures may also 
include— 
‘‘(i) a further reduction in the rate of future 
benefit accruals without regard to the limitation 
applicable under subparagraph (B)(ii), or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of core benefits, 
provided that such reductions shall be equitably 
distributed across the participant and bene-
ficiary population, taking into account factors, 
with respect to participants and beneficiaries 
and their benefits, that may include one or more 
of the factors listed in subclauses (I) through 
(X) of section 432(e)(9)(D)(vi), to the extent nec-
essary to enable the plan to achieve a projected 
funded ratio of at least 120 percent for the fol-
lowing plan year, or at the election of the plan 
sponsor, a projected funded ratio of at least 100 
percent for the following plan year and a cur-
rent funded ratio of at least 90 percent. 
‘‘(3) ADJUSTABLE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For pur-
poses of this subpart, the term ‘adjustable ben-
efit’ means— 
‘‘(A) benefits, rights, and features under the 
plan, including post-retirement death benefits, 
60-month guarantees, disability benefits not yet 
in pay status, and similar benefits, 
‘‘(B) any early retirement benefit or retire-
ment-type subsidy (within the meaning of sec-
tion 411(d)(6)(B)(i)) and any benefit payment 
option (other than the qualified joint and sur-
vivor annuity), and 
‘‘(C) benefit increases that were adopted (or, 
if later, took effect) less than 60 months before 
the first day such realignment program took ef-
fect. 
‘‘(4) CORE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For purposes of 
this subpart, the term ‘core benefit’ means a 
participant’s accrued benefit payable in the nor-
mal form of an annuity commencing at normal 
retirement age, determined without regard to— 
‘‘(A) any early retirement benefits, retirement- 
type subsidies, or other benefits, rights, or fea-
tures that may be associated with that benefit, 
and 
‘‘(B) any cost-of-living adjustments or benefit 
increases effective after the date of retirement. 
‘‘(5) COORDINATION
WITH
CONTRIBUTION
IN-
CREASES.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A realignment program 
may provide that some or all of the benefit modi-
fications described in the program will only take 
effect if the bargaining parties fail to agree to 
specified levels of increases in contributions to 
the plan, effective as of specified dates. 
‘‘(B) INDEPENDENT BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes to 
the benefit formula that are independent of po-
tential contribution increases, such changes 
shall take effect not later than 180 days fol-
lowing the first day of the first plan year that 
begins following the adoption of the realignment 
program. 
‘‘(C) CONDITIONAL BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes to 
the benefit formula that take effect only if the 
bargaining parties fail to agree to contribution 
increases, such changes shall take effect not 
later than the first day of the first plan year be-
ginning after the third anniversary of the date 
of adoption of the realignment program. 
‘‘(D) REVOCATION OF CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Benefit modifications described in 
paragraph (3) may be revoked, in whole or in 
part, and retroactively or prospectively, when 
contributions to the plan are increased, as speci-
fied in the realignment program, including any 
amendments thereto. The preceding sentence 
shall not apply unless the contribution increases 
are to be effective not later than the fifth anni-
versary of the first day of the first plan year 
that begins after the adoption of the realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(b) NOTICE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which it is 
certified under section 438(a) that the projected 
funded ratio is less than 120 percent, the plan 
sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the 
date of the certification, provide notification of 
the current and projected funded ratios to the 
participants and beneficiaries, the bargaining 
parties, and the Secretary. Such notice shall in-
clude— 
‘‘(A) an explanation that contribution rate in-
creases or benefit reductions may be necessary, 
‘‘(B) a description of the types of benefits that 
might be reduced, and 
‘‘(C) an estimate of the contribution increases 
and benefit reductions that may be necessary to 
achieve a projected funded ratio of 120 percent. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—No modifications may be 
made that reduce the rate of future benefit ac-
crual or that reduce core benefits or adjustable 
benefits unless notice of such reduction has 
been given at least 180 days before the general 
effective date of such reduction for all partici-
pants and beneficiaries to— 
‘‘(i) plan participants and beneficiaries, 
‘‘(ii) each employer who has an obligation to 
contribute to the composite plan, and 
‘‘(iii) each employee organization which, for 
purposes of collective bargaining, represents 
plan participants employed by such employers. 
‘‘(B) CONTENT OF NOTICE.—The notice under 
subparagraph (A) shall contain— 
‘‘(i) sufficient information to enable partici-
pants and beneficiaries to understand the effect 
of any reduction on their benefits, including an 
illustration of any affected benefit or subsidy, 
on an annual or monthly basis that a partici-
pant or beneficiary would otherwise have been 
eligible for as of the general effective date de-
scribed in subparagraph (A), and 
‘‘(ii) information as to the rights and remedies 
of plan participants and beneficiaries as well as 
how to contact the Department of Labor for fur-
ther information and assistance, where appro-
priate.

subparagraph (A)— 
‘‘(i) shall be provided in a form and manner 
prescribed in regulations of the Secretary of 
Labor, 
‘‘(ii) shall be written in a manner so as to be 
understood by the average plan participant. 
‘‘(3) MODEL NOTICES.—The Secretary shall— 
‘‘(A) prescribe model notices that the plan 
sponsor of a composite plan may use to satisfy 
the notice requirements under this subsection, 
and 
‘‘(B) by regulation enumerate any details re-
lated to the elements listed in paragraph (1) that 
any notice under this subsection must include. 
‘‘(4) DELIVERY
METHOD.—Any notice under 
this part shall be provided in writing and may 
also be provided in electronic form to the extent 
that the form is reasonably accessible to persons 
to whom the notice is provided. 
‘‘SEC. 440. LIMITATION ON INCREASING BENE-
FITS. 
‘‘(a) LEVEL OF CURRENT FUNDED RATIOS.—Ex-
cept as provided in subsections (c), (d), and (e), 
no plan amendment increasing benefits or estab-
lishing new benefits under a composite plan may 
be adopted for a plan year unless— 
‘‘(1) the plan’s current funded ratio is at least 
110 percent (without regard to the benefit in-
crease or new benefits), 
‘‘(2) taking the benefit increase or new bene-
fits into account, the current funded ratio is at 
least 100 percent and the projected funded ratio 
for the current plan year is at least 120 percent,

or the projected funded ratio is less than 140 
percent, the benefit increase or new benefits are 
projected by the plan actuary to increase the 
present value of the plan’s liabilities for the 
plan year by not more than 3 percent, and 
‘‘(4) expected contributions for the current 
plan year are at least 120 percent of normal cost 
for the plan year, determined using the unit 
credit funding method and treating the benefit 
increase or new benefits as in effect for the en-
tire plan year. 
‘‘(b) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WHERE CORE 
BENEFITS REDUCED.—If a plan has been amend-
ed to reduce core benefits pursuant to a realign-
ment program under section 439(a)(2)(D), such 
plan may not be subsequently amended to in-
crease core benefits unless the amendment— 
‘‘(1) increases the level of future benefit pay-
ments only, and 
‘‘(2) provides for an equitable distribution of 
benefit increases across the participant and ben-
eficiary population, taking into account the ex-
tent to which the benefits of participants were 
previously reduced pursuant to such realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(c) EXCEPTION TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE 
LAW.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in connec-
tion with a plan amendment if the amendment 
is required as a condition of qualification under 
part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 or to comply 
with other applicable law. 
‘‘(d) EXCEPTION WHERE MAXIMUM DEDUCT-
IBLE LIMIT APPLIES.—Subsection (a) shall not 
apply in connection with a plan amendment if 
and to the extent that contributions to the com-
posite plan would not be deductible for the plan 
year under section 404(a)(1)(E) if the plan 
amendment is not adopted. The Secretary of the 
Treasury shall issue regulations to implement 
this paragraph. 
‘‘(e) EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in 
connection with a plan amendment under sec-
tion 439(a)(5)(C), regarding conditional benefit 
modifications. 
‘‘(f) TREATMENT OF PLAN AMENDMENTS.—For 
purposes of this section— 
‘‘(1) if two or more plan amendments increas-
ing benefits or establishing new benefits are 
adopted in a plan year, such amendments shall 
be treated as a single amendment adopted on 
the last day of the plan year, 
‘‘(2) all benefit increases and new benefits 
adopted in a single amendment are treated as a 
single benefit increase, irrespective of whether 
the increases and new benefits take effect in 
more than one plan year, and 
‘‘(3) increases in contributions or decreases in 
plan liabilities which are scheduled to take ef-
fect in future plan years may be taken into ac-
count in connection with a plan amendment if 
they have been agreed to in writing or otherwise 
formalized by the date the plan amendment is 
adopted. 
‘‘SEC. 440A. COMPOSITE PLAN RESTRICTIONS TO 
PRESERVE LEGACY PLAN FUNDING. 
‘‘(a) TREATMENT AS A LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sub-
chapter, a defined benefit plan shall be treated 
as a legacy plan with respect to the composite 
plan under which the employees who were eligi-
ble to accrue a benefit under the defined benefit 
plan become eligible to accrue a benefit under 
such composite plan. 
‘‘(2) COMPONENT
PLANS.—In any case in 
which a defined benefit plan is amended to add 
a composite plan component pursuant to section 
437(b), paragraph (1) shall be applied by sub-
stituting ‘defined benefit component’ for ‘de-
fined benefit plan’ and ‘composite plan compo-
nent’ for ‘composite plan’. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE
TO
ACCRUE
A
BENEFIT.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is con-
sidered eligible to accrue a benefit under a com-
posite plan as of the first day in which the em-
ployee completes an hour of service under a col-
lective bargaining agreement that provides for 
contributions to and accruals under the com-
posite plan in lieu of accruals under the legacy 
plan. 
‘‘(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.—As 
used in this subpart, the term ‘collective bar-
gaining agreement’ includes any agreement 
under which an employer has an obligation to 
contribute to a plan. 
‘‘(5) OTHER
TERMS.—Any term used in this 
subpart which is not defined in this part and 
which is also used in section 432 shall have the 
same meaning provided such term in such sec-
tion. 
‘‘(b) RESTRICTIONS ON ACCEPTANCE BY COM-
POSITE PLAN
OF AGREEMENTS
AND CONTRIBU-
TIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall not accept or recognize a col-
lective bargaining agreement (or any modifica-
tion to such agreement), and no contributions 
may be accepted and no benefits may be accrued 
or otherwise earned under the agreement— 
‘‘(A) in any case in which the plan actuary of 
any defined benefit plan that would be treated 
as a legacy plan with respect to such composite 
plan has certified under section 432(b)(3) that 
such defined benefit plan is or will be in critical 
status for the plan year in which such agree-
ment would take effect or for any of the suc-
ceeding 5 plan years, and 
‘‘(B) unless the agreement requires each em-
ployer who is a party to such agreement, includ-
ing employers whose employees are not partici-
pants in the legacy plan, to provide contribu-
tions to the legacy plan with respect to such 
composite plan in a manner that satisfies the 
transition contribution requirements of sub-
section (d). 
‘‘(2) NOTICE.—Not later than 30 days after a 
determination by a plan sponsor of a composite 
plan that an agreement fails to satisfy the re-
quirements described in paragraph (1), the plan 
sponsor shall provide notification of such fail-
ure and the reasons for such determination to— 
‘‘(A) the parties to the agreement, 
‘‘(B) active participants of the composite plan 
who have ceased to accrue or otherwise earn 
benefits with respect to service with an employer 
pursuant to paragraph (1), and 
‘‘(C) the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of 
the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guar-
anty Corporation. 
‘‘(3) LIMITATION
ON
RETROACTIVE
EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits ac-
crued before the date on which notice is pro-
vided under paragraph (2). 
‘‘(c) RESTRICTION ON ACCRUAL OF BENEFITS 
UNDER A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which an 
employer, under a collective bargaining agree-
ment entered into after the date of enactment of 
the Giving Retirement Options to Workers Act of 
2020, ceases to have an obligation to contribute 
to a multiemployer defined benefit plan, no em-
ployees employed by the employer may accrue or 
otherwise earn benefits under any composite 
plan, with respect to service with that employer, 
for a 60-month period beginning on the date on 
which the employer entered into such collective 
bargaining agreement. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.— 
Within 30 days of determining that an employer 
has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to 
a legacy plan with respect to employees em-
ployed by an employer that is or will be contrib-
uting to a composite plan with respect to service 
of such employees, the plan sponsor of the leg-
acy plan shall notify the plan sponsor of the 
composite plan of that cessation. 
‘‘(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.—Not 
later than 30 days after determining that an em-
ployer has ceased to have an obligation to con-
tribute to a legacy plan, the plan sponsor of the 
composite plan shall notify the bargaining par-
ties, the active participants affected by the ces-
sation of accruals, the Secretary, the Secretary 
of Labor, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation of the cessation of accruals, the pe-
riod during which such cessation is in effect, 
and the reasons therefor. 
‘‘(4) LIMITATION
ON
RETROACTIVE
EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits ac-
crued before the date on which notice is pro-
vided under paragraph (3). 
‘‘(d) 
TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION
REQUIRE-
MENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—A collective bargaining 
agreement satisfies the transition contribution 
requirements of this subsection if the agree-
ment— 
‘‘(A) authorizes for payment of contributions 
to a legacy plan at a rate or rates equal to or 
greater than the transition contribution rate es-
tablished under paragraph (2), and 
‘‘(B) does not provide for— 
‘‘(i) a suspension of contributions to the leg-
acy plan with respect to any period of service, 
or 
‘‘(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of 
younger or newly hired employees of the em-
ployer from being taken into account in deter-
mining contributions owed to the legacy plan. 
‘‘(2) TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The transition contribu-
tion rate for a plan year is the contribution rate 
that, as certified by the actuary of the legacy 
plan in accordance with the principles in sec-
tion 432(b)(3)(B), is reasonably expected to be 
adequate— 
‘‘(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan year, 
‘‘(ii) to amortize the plan’s unfunded liabil-
ities in level annual installments over 25 years, 
beginning with the plan year in which the tran-
sition contribution rate is first established, and 
‘‘(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes in 
the legacy plan’s unfunded liability due to expe-
rience gains or losses (including investment 
gains or losses, gains or losses due to contribu-
tions greater or less than the contributions made 
under the prior transition contribution rate, and 
other actuarial gains or losses), changes in ac-
tuarial assumptions, changes to the legacy 
plan’s benefits, or changes in funding method 
over a period of 15 plan years beginning with 
the plan year in which such change in un-
funded liability is incurred. 
The transition contribution rate for any plan 
year may not be less than the transition con-
tribution rate for the plan year in which such 
rate is first established. 
‘‘(B) MULTIPLE RATES.—If different rates of 
contribution are payable to the legacy plan by 
different employers or for different classes of 
employees, the certification shall specify a tran-
sition contribution rate for each such employer. 
‘‘(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.—

CONTRIBUTIONS.—A col-

ferred, adjusted for allocable distributions, in-
vestment gains and losses, and administrative 
expenses.

is obligated to contribute to more than one leg-
acy plan with respect to employees eligible to 
accrue benefits under more than one composite 
plan and there is a merger or transfer of such 
legacy plans, the transition contribution rate 
applicable to the legacy plan resulting from the

the regularly scheduled general election for Fed-
eral office held in November 2020 and each suc-
ceeding election for Federal office. 
SEC. 160008. ACCOMMODATIONS FOR VOTERS RE-
SIDING IN INDIAN LANDS. 
(a) ACCOMMODATIONS DESCRIBED.— 
(1) DESIGNATION OF BALLOT PICKUP AND COL-
LECTION LOCATIONS.—Given the widespread lack 
of residential mail delivery in Indian Country, 
an Indian Tribe may designate buildings as bal-
lot pickup and collection locations with respect 
to an election for Federal office at no cost to the 
Indian Tribe. An Indian Tribe may designate 
one building per precinct located within Indian 
lands. The applicable State or political subdivi-
sion shall collect ballots from those locations. 
The applicable State or political subdivision 
shall provide the Indian Tribe with accurate 
precinct maps for all precincts located within 
Indian lands 60 days before the election. 
(2) PROVISION OF MAIL-IN AND ABSENTEE BAL-
LOTS.—The State or political subdivision shall 
provide mail-in and absentee ballots with re-
spect to an election for Federal office to each in-
dividual who is registered to vote in the election 
who resides on Indian lands in the State or po-
litical subdivision involved without requiring a 
residential address or a mail-in or absentee bal-
lot request. 
(3) USE OF DESIGNATED BUILDING AS RESIDEN-
TIAL AND MAILING ADDRESS.—The address of a 
designated building that is a ballot pickup and 
collection location with respect to an election 
for Federal office may serve as the residential 
address and mailing address for voters living on 
Indian lands if the tribally designated building 
is in the same precinct as that voter. If there is 
no tribally designated building within a voter’s 
precinct, the voter may use another tribally des-
ignated building within the Indian lands where 
the voter is located. Voters using a tribally des-
ignated building outside of the voter’s precinct 
may use the tribally designated building as a 
mailing address and may separately designate 
the voter’s appropriate precinct through a de-
scription of the voter’s address, as specified in 
section 9428.4(a)(2) of title 11, Code of Federal 
Regulations. 
(4) LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY.—In the case of a

TITLE X—JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT 
SEC. 191001. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Jabara-Heyer 
National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and 
Threats to Equality Act of 2020’’ or the ‘‘Jabara- 
Heyer NO HATE Act’’. 
SEC. 191002. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
crimes or crimes motivated by bias poses a seri-
ous national problem. 
(2) According to data obtained by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of such 
violence increased in 2017, the most recent year 
for which data is available. 
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crime 
Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 U.S.C. 534 
note) to provide the Federal Government, law 
enforcement agencies, and the public with data 
regarding the incidence of hate crime. The Hate 
Crimes Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard 
and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act 
(division E of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) 
have enabled Federal authorities to understand 
and, where appropriate, investigate and pros-
ecute hate crimes. 
(4) A more complete understanding of the na-
tional problem posed by hate crime is in the 
public interest and supports the Federal interest 
in 
eradicating 
bias-motivated 
violence 
ref-
erenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of title 18, United 
States Code. 
(5) However, a complete understanding of the 
national problem posed by hate crimes is hin-
dered by incomplete data from Federal, State, 
and local jurisdictions through the Uniform 
Crime Reports program authorized under section 
534 of title 28, United States Code, and adminis-
tered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the provision 
of inaccurate and incomplete data regarding the 
incidence of hate crime through the Uniform 
Crime Reports program. A significant contrib-
uting factor is the quality and quantity of train-
ing that State and local law enforcement agen-
cies receive on the identification and reporting 
of suspected bias-motivated crimes. 
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is 
sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate 
in nature as to warrant Federal financial assist-
ance to States and local jurisdictions. 
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard to 
certain violent crimes motivated by bias enables 
Federal, State, and local authorities to work to-
gether as partners in the investigation and pros-
ecution of such crimes. 
SEC. 191003. DEFINITIONS. 
In this title: 
(1) HATE
CRIME.—The term ‘‘hate crime’’ 
means an act described in section 245, 247, or 249

agency’’ means— 
(A) a law enforcement agency of a unit of

less than 100,000, as computed by the Federal

Section 249 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(e) SUPERVISED
RELEASE.—If a court in-
cludes, as a part of a sentence of imprisonment 
imposed for a violation of subsection (a), a re-
quirement that the defendant be placed on a 
term of supervised release after imprisonment

TITLE XI—PRISONS AND JAILS 
SEC. 191101. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Pandemic Jus-
tice Response Act’’. 
SEC. 191102. EMERGENCY COMMUNITY SUPER-
VISION ACT. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) As of the date of introduction of this Act, 
the novel coronavirus has spread to all 50 
States, the District of Columbia, and 3 terri-
tories. 
(2) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention have projected that between 160,000,000 
and 214,000,000 people could be infected by the 
novel coronavirus in the United States over the 
course of the pandemic. 
(3) Although the United States has less than 
5 percent of the world’s population, the United 
States holds approximately 21 percent of the 
world’s prisoners and leads the world in the 
number of individuals incarcerated, with nearly 
2,200,000 people incarcerated in State and Fed-
eral prisons and local jails. 
(4) Studies have shown that individuals age 
out of crime starting around 25 years of age, 
and released individuals over the age of 50 have 
a very low recidivism rate. 
(5) According to public health experts, incar-
cerated individuals are particularly vulnerable 
to being gravely impacted by the novel corona 
virus pandemic because— 
(A) they have higher rates of underlying 
health issues than members of the general pub-
lic, including higher rates of respiratory disease, 
heart disease, diabetes, obesity, HIV/AIDS, sub-
stance abuse, hepatitis, and other conditions 
that suppress immune response; and 
(B) the close conditions and lack of access to 
hygiene products in prisons make these institu-
tions unusually susceptible to viral pandemics. 
(6) The spread of communicable disease in the 
United States generally constitutes a serious, 
heightened threat to the safety of incarcerated 
individuals, and there is a serious threat to the 
general public that prisons may become incuba-
tors of community spread of communicable viral 
disease.

(ii) may not place in community supervision 
any individual if the court determines, after a

shows by clear and convincing evidence based 
on individualized facts, that detention is nec-

a specific and substantial risk that the indi-
vidual will cause bodily injury or use violent

conditions of release will reasonably mitigate 
that risk; 
(iii) in carrying out clauses (i) and (ii), may—

of any individual, the judicial officer shall order 
the pretrial release of the individual on personal 
recognizance or on a condition or combination 
of conditions under section 3142(c) of title 18, 
United States Code, unless the attorney for the 
Government shows by clear and convincing evi-
dence based on individualized facts that deten-
tion is necessary because the individual’s release

(i) whether the individual’s age or medical 
condition renders them especially vulnerable;

(i) IN
GENERAL.—Beginning on the date on

municable disease is declared and ending on the

(ii) EXCEPTION.—A juvenile alleged to have 
committed an act of juvenile delinquency may be 
detained pending trial only if, at a hearing at 
which the juvenile is represented by counsel, the 
attorney for the Government shows by clear and 
convincing evidence based on individualized 
facts that detention is necessary because the ju-
venile’s release will pose a specific and substan-
tial risk that the juvenile will use violent force 
against a reasonably identifiable person and 
that no conditions of release will reasonably 
mitigate that risk, except that in no case may a 
judicial officer order the detention of a juvenile 
if it will compromise the juvenile’s access to ade-
quate medical treatment, access to medications, 
or ability to privately consult with counsel and 
meaningfully prepare a defense. 
(iii) LEAST
RESTRICTIVE
DETENTION.—In the 
case that the judicial officer orders the deten-

(III) a description of the risk identified under 
clause (ii); 
(IV) an explanation of why no conditions will 
reasonably mitigate the risk identified under 
clause (ii); 
(V) a statement that detention will not com-
promise the juvenile’s access to adequate med-
ical treatment, access to medications, or ability 
to privately consult with counsel and meaning-
fully prepare a defense; and 
(VI) a statement establishing that the deten-
tion environment is the least restrictive and

to be appropriate by the supervising probation 
officer, report in person to their probation or pa-
role officer;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2216 
May 15, 2020 
(1) In December 2009, President Obama re-
leased the National Strategy for Countering Bio-
logical Threats, which listed as one of seven ob-
jectives ‘‘Promote global health security: In-
crease the availability of and access to knowl-
edge and products of the life sciences that can 
help reduce the impact from outbreaks of infec-
tious disease whether of natural, accidental, or 
deliberate origin’’. 
(2) In February 2014, the United States and 
nearly 30 other nations launched the Global 
Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to address sev-
eral high-priority, global infectious disease 
threats. The GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi- 
country initiative intended to accelerate partner 
countries’ measurable capabilities to achieve 
specific targets to prevent, detect, and respond 
to infectious disease threats, whether naturally 
occurring, deliberate, or accidental. 
(3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which 
include specific reference to the importance of 
global health security as part of SDG 3 ‘‘ensure 
healthy lives and promote well-being for all at 
all ages’’ as follows: ‘‘strengthen the capacity of 
all countries, in particular developing countries, 
for early warning, risk reduction and manage-
ment of national and global health risks’’. 
(4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama 
signed Executive Order 13747, ‘‘Advancing the 
Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a 
World Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease 
Threats’’. 
(5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial 
Meeting in Uganda, the United States and more 
than 40 GHSA member countries supported the 
‘‘Kampala Declaration’’ to extend the GHSA for 
an additional 5 years to 2024. 
(6) In December 2017, President Trump re-
leased the National Security Strategy, which in-
cludes the priority action: ‘‘Detect and contain 
biothreats at their source: We will work with 
other countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks 
early to prevent the spread of disease. We will 
encourage other countries to invest in basic 
health care systems and to strengthen global 
health security across the intersection of human 
and animal health to prevent infectious disease 
outbreaks’’. 
(7) In September 2018, President Trump re-
leased the National Biodefense Strategy, which 
includes objectives to ‘‘strengthen global health 
security capacities to prevent local bioincidents 
from becoming epidemics’’, and ‘‘strengthen 
international preparedness to support inter-
national response and recovery capabilities’’. 
SEC. 191505. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

cease to be effective on December 31, 2024. 
Subtitle C—Securing America From 
Epidemics Act 
SEC. 191513. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Due to increasing population and popu-
lation density, human mobility, and ecological 
change, emerging infectious diseases pose a real 
and growing threat to global health security. 
(2) While vaccines can be the most effective 
tools to protect against infectious disease, the 
absence of vaccines for a new or emerging infec-
tious disease with epidemic potential is a major 
health security threat globally, posing cata-
strophic potential human and economic costs. 
(3) The 1918 influenza pandemic infected 
500,000,000 people, or about one-third of the 
world’s population at the time, and killed 
50,000,000 people—more than died in the First 
World War. 
(4) The economic cost of an outbreak can be 
devastating. The estimated global cost today, 
should an outbreak of the scale of the 1918 in-
fluenza pandemic strike, is 5 percent of global 
gross domestic product. 
(5) Even regional outbreaks can have enor-
mous human costs and substantially disrupt the 
global economy and cripple regional economies. 
The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed 
more than 11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses 
in the affected countries alone. 
(6) The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak 
reflects the pressing need for quick and effective 
vaccine and countermeasure development. 
(7) While the need for vaccines to address 
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets to 
drive the necessary development of vaccines to 
address them—a complex and expensive under-
taking—are very often critically absent. Also ab-
sent are mechanisms to ensure access to those 
vaccines by those who need them when they 
need them. 
(8) To address this global vulnerability and 
the deficit of political commitment, institutional 
capacity, and funding, in 2017, several countries 
and private partners launched the Coalition for 
Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). 
CEPI’s mission is to stimulate, finance, and co-
ordinate development of vaccines for high-pri-
ority, epidemic-potential threats in cases where 
traditional markets do not exist or cannot create 
sufficient demand. 
(9) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates 
through the end of phase II clinical trials, as 
well as support vaccine platforms that can be 
rapidly deployed against emerging pathogens. 
(10) CEPI has funded multiple partners to de-
velop vaccine candidates against the novel 
coronavirus, responding to this urgent, global 
requirement. 
(11) Support for and participation in CEPI is 
an important part of the United States own 
health security and biodefense and is in the na-
tional interest, complementing the work of many 
Federal agencies and providing significant 
value through global partnership and burden- 
sharing.

SEC. 191602. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) science and the scientific process should 
help inform and guide public policy decisions on 
a wide range of issues, including improvement of 
public health, protection of the environment, 
and protection of national security; 
(2) the public must be able to trust the science 
and scientific process informing public policy 
decisions; 
(3) science, the scientific process, and the com-
munication of science should be free from poli-
tics, ideology, and financial conflicts of interest; 
(4) policies and procedures that ensure the in-
tegrity of the conduct and communication of 
publicly funded science are critical to ensuring 
public trust; 
(5) a Federal agency that funds, conducts, or 
oversees research should not suppress, alter, 
interfere with, or otherwise impede the timely 
communication and open exchange of data and 
findings to other agencies, policymakers, and 
the public of research conducted by a scientist 
or engineer employed or contracted by a Federal 
agency that funds, conducts, or oversees sci-
entific research; 
(6) Federal agencies that fund, conduct, or 
oversee research should work to prevent the 
suppression or distortion of the data and find-
ings; 
(7) under the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution, citizens of the United States have the 
right to ‘‘petition the government for a redress 
of grievances’’; and 
(8) Congress has further protected those rights 
under section 7211 of title 5, United States Code, 
which states, ‘‘the right of employees, individ-
ually or collectively, to petition Congress or a 
member of Congress . . . may not be interfered 
with or denied’’.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2221 
May 15, 2020 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 41⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, nearly 86,000 Americans 
have died, more than 1.4 million have 
become sick, and more than 36 million 
have 
lost 
their 
jobs 
because 
of 
coronavirus. 
While Congress has taken significant 
action, we must do more. 
On 
Wednesday, 
Federal 
Reserve 
Chairman Jay Powell urged Congress 
to think big to address this crisis. The 
HEROES Act is a bold step to provide 
that support and ensure our Nation 
meets the challenge of the pandemic 
and the ensuing economic recession. 
Within the Appropriations division, 
this bill deploys more than $1.5 trillion 
in Federal funds to address this health 
and economic crisis. 
First, the bill delivers nearly $1 tril-
lion to States and local governments so 
that they can keep our heroes—first re-
sponders, health workers, teachers, and 
other public servants—paid and work-
ing for the American people. 
I am proud that this bill will provide 
$67 billion to my home State of New 
York, which has been hit so hard by 
this crisis. 
Second, we will only beat this disease 
with a robust national strategy for 
testing, tracing, and treatment. 
Yesterday, Dr. Rick Bright, one of 
the Federal Government’s top sci-
entists, warned us: ‘‘If we fail to de-
velop a national coordinated response, 
based in science, I fear the pandemic 
will get far worse and be prolonged, 
causing unprecedented illness and fa-
talities.’’ 
To that end, the bill builds on the 
CARES Act, with $75 billion for a na-
tionwide testing and contact tracing 
strategy, and an additional $100 billion 
for the Health Provider Relief Fund. 
Third, we must meet the challenge 
that the economic effects of lockdowns 
and stay-at-home orders are having on 
families. 
As a mother and a grandmother, I am 
deeply concerned about the effects of 
coronavirus on children and their edu-
cation. We are including $100 billion to 
support K–12 and higher education sys-
tems as they respond to this crisis. 
To address rising hunger, this bill 
funds an expansion of SNAP benefits 
and other nutrition programs so that 
children and families have enough to 
eat. 
To prevent a housing crisis, we are 
deploying new funds worth nearly $200 
billion to help struggling families 
make rent or pay their mortgages. 
Finally, to stop this crisis from 
weakening our democracy, we have in-
cluded funding to hold safe elections, 
to carry out a fair and accurate Cen-
sus, and to ensure that the Postal Serv-
ice can continue safely delivering mail 
to American households. 
I am so proud of the hard work of so 
many to ensure this bill provides the 
help that families, businesses, and 
communities need. 
Mr. Speaker, the HEROES Act will 
meet the challenges this pandemic 
poses to our Nation. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1445 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 6800. Not only is the bill 
premature; it was crafted behind closed 
doors and without any Republican 
input at all. 
The pandemic we currently face is 
unlike anything we have experienced in 
modern history, and so, too, has been 
our response. I am pleased with how 
the Congress has worked together and 
quickly to provide urgent aid to those 
on the front lines and those struggling 
with the economic impacts of this dis-
astrous scourge. 
Every bill that has been enacted up 
to this point was ultimately the prod-
uct of cooperation and bipartisan sup-
port. Each of those bills passed this 
floor with essentially no partisan divi-
sion at all. 
So it is very disappointing to come 
before you today, Mr. Speaker, on this 
one-sided bill that is loaded with provi-
sions unrelated to the crisis that we 
face. This is not in the spirit of co-
operation that the American people ex-
pect from their leaders during difficult 
times. 
Indeed, the bill before us today has $3 
trillion in spending, we think. We don’t 
know. We don’t have a CBO score yet. 
It provides nearly $10,000 for every per-
son in the United States. And the $1.5 
trillion of discretionary funding pro-
vided in this bill is more than typically 
appropriated in an entire fiscal year. 
This includes almost a trillion dol-
lars in new funding for States, cities, 
and counties, on top of roughly a tril-
lion dollars we have already provided 
over the last two months. These new 
dollars are made available without any 
safeguards against funds going to juris-
dictions that had financial problems 
long before the crisis and are unrelated 
to the crisis. 
The bill gives the U.S. Postal Service 
a $25 billion windfall without requiring 
any reforms to their operations, and it 
bails out multiemployer pension plans. 
There are also sweeping changes to 
our election system, requiring same- 
day voter registration and nationwide 
vote by mail. This is an incredible Fed-
eral intrusion into the election system 
that is operated not by the Federal 
Government, but by the States. 
I am concerned with this path, Mr. 
Speaker. It leads us in the wrong direc-
tion. There is no reason for us to be 
here on the floor in this House debat-
ing this partisan wish list. 
I know what can come from Members 
working across the aisle together. I 
have done it on many occasions with 
my 
good 
friend, 
the 
distinguished 
chairwoman 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee. It is what led to the cre-
ation of the Infectious Disease Rapid 
Response Reserve Fund that allowed 
the administration to respond imme-
diately to the emerging threat from 
the new coronavirus as we worked to 
understand where resources were need-
ed. 
I was proud to work with my coun-
terpart in the Labor, Health, and 
Human Services Committee, Chair-
woman DELAURO, on that fund, and 
even more proud to see it used effec-
tively. That is an example of the two 
parties coming together, working to-
gether to pass a really good idea that 
benefitted this country at a critical 
time. 
That is the cooperative nature that 
has been the hallmark of our govern-
ment’s response to the pandemic up till 
now. The American people expect and 
deserve nothing less. For that reason, I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this bill, so that we can work together 
and on a better product that will be a 
responsible use of taxpayer dollars and 
truly help those in need. 
Mr. Speaker, I have full faith that 
the leaders of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, Chairwoman LOWEY and Repub-
lican Ranking Member GRANGER, will 
work together to come up with a bill 
that we all support. That confidence is 
based on experience. I have seen them 
do it over and over again during my 
time in Congress, and particularly in 
dealing with the last four bills where 
we did work together and manage to 
craft a bill that not only passed here, 
but passed the United States Senate as 
well, essentially without dissent. 
Mr. Speaker, if we continue down the 
path with this bill, we know that the 
Senate will not pick it up, and we 
know the President will not sign it. It 
is much more about political mes-
saging than effective legislating. 
I would just urge my colleagues, let’s 
return to the path that we walked 
down together in these recent weeks. 
We bargained, we debated, but we 
brought products to the floor that we 
knew could pass the other chamber and 
that we knew the President would sign, 
and that we knew would immediately 
go forward to help the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the outstanding 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair for yielding and 
thank her for her tremendous leader-
ship. 
My colleagues, a horrible virus has 
made a vicious attack on the lives and 
the livelihood of the American people 
and, indeed, on the life of our democ-
racy. We have been given a momentous 
opportunity and, therefore, a great op-
portunity to defeat the virus and to do 
so in a way that brings us together and 
takes us forward to a stronger Amer-
ica. 
Today, the House will consider the 
HEROES Act, to honor those who are 
on the front lines, our healthcare 
workers, our first responders, teachers,

sanitation 
workers, 
food 
providers, 
transit workers, and other essential 
workers. 
Many of them have risked their lives 
to save lives, and now they may lose 
their jobs. For many of them, this is 
just what is happening right now as 
governors across the country are plan-
ning their budgets. 
As the coronavirus takes its vicious 
toll on the lives and livelihoods in our 
country, it has also taken a toll on the 
States to deliver services to the people. 
Governors are forced to either cut serv-
ices or increase taxes or both. 
Congress must honor its responsi-
bility to the American people, to lessen 
the blow of the coronavirus, by making 
the same serious investment of the HE-
ROES Act to our State, local, Tribal, 
and territorial governments. 
The plan that we are voting on today 
will make a tremendous difference, not 
only in the budgets of the States, but 
in the lives of the American people: 
their public health, the education of 
our children, the sanitation that is so 
important in defeating the virus, with 
the support of so many essential work-
ers. 
The distinguished gentleman on the 
other side of the aisle talked about the 
cost of the bill. The cost to the States, 
localities, territories, and Tribal gov-
ernments is less than the cost of the 
Republican tax break, which gave 83 
percent of the benefits to the top 1 per-
cent. We think this is a major invest-
ment in the lives of the American peo-
ple and in the budgets of our States 
and localities. 
Setting aside how we got here, we 
must approach this tragedy with the 
deepest humanity, Mr. Speaker. All of 
our hearts are broken by the 87,000 
Americans who have lost their lives 
and nearly 1.5 million who have been 
infected by the coronavirus. 
The number of 36-or-more-million 
Americans who have filed for unem-
ployment insurance is almost unimagi-
nable. This is a moment when our fel-
low Americans are in deep suffering. 
We must have empathy for our heroes, 
the healthcare workers, for how ex-
hausted they must be and how stressed 
they are in doing their jobs. And, 
again, they are at risk of losing their 
jobs in this economy. 
We must also emphasize the pain of 
families who do not know where their 
next meal is coming from or how they 
are going to pay next month’s rent. It 
is imperative that we address the needs 
of the American people with clarity as 
we proceed. 
It is always interesting to me, Mr. 
Speaker, to see how much patience 
some people have with the pain and 
suffering of other people, a tolerance 
level that is not acceptable in a great 
country like America, with a sense of 
community and concern for each other. 
We can all agree that we must open 
the economy, for sure, as quickly as we 
can. But we must do so based on 
science and data. The key to opening 
this door is testing, tracing, treating, 
and social distancing. Overwhelmingly, 
the scientific community agrees. 
The HEROES Act has a strategic 
plan, something that has been lacking 
thus far, a strategic plan with a vision 
to end this plague, a strategic vision, a 
goal, a timetable, milestones, bench-
marks, put forth by the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. That is really 
important. I thank the gentleman from 
New Jersey. You have to have a plan to 
succeed. 
As families are devastated by the loss 
of life, this legislation of putting 
money in the pockets of the American 
people, which is also a stimulus for the 
economy, is essential. They are suf-
fering so much in so many ways. We 
want to lessen the pain for them. 
As Federal Reserve Chairman Powell 
said—this is very important, because it 
isn’t one of us saying it to each other. 
The authority of the Chairman of the 
Federal Reserve Board said: ‘‘Addi-
tional fiscal support could be costly, 
but worth it if it helps avoid long-term 
economic damage and leaves us with a 
stronger recovery. This tradeoff is one 
for our elected representatives, who 
wield powers of taxation and spend-
ing.’’ 
As elected officials, we have the re-
sponsibility and the opportunity to 
think big, as he advised, and act now 
for the people. 
The distinguished gentleman said, 
oh, my goodness, we put this bill on 
the floor. Well, let me just do a little 
history of the last few months. 
I, too, am very proud of the fact that 
we were able to bring four bills to con-
clusion in a strong bipartisan way. 
The first one on March 4: Testing, 
testing, testing. Not really fulfilled, 
but nonetheless intended. 
Ten days later, on March 14: Mask, 
mask, mask, mask. Again, PPE, not 
fully 
realized, 
but 
nonetheless 
in-
tended. 
March 28, the President of the United 
States signed the CARES Act, the first 
CARES Act. And that was a bill that 
was developed by the Republican lead-
ership in the Senate. They put forth 
their proposal. We responded, acted 
upon it, and came forth with a bipar-
tisan agreement. 
The next bill, the interim PPP bill, 
was also developed by the Republican 
leader in the Senate. He put forth their 
proposal; we put forth our suggestions; 
we negotiated; we came forth with a bi-
partisan bill. 
Don’t you take pride in the House of 
Representatives having the same op-
portunity and privilege as the Repub-
lican leadership in the Senate for us to 
put forth legislation in this terrible 
fight? 
More than 80 percent of what is in 
this legislation has already been sup-
ported in a bipartisan way. We have 
agreed on State and local and other 
bills. We have agreed on testing in at 
least two other bills. We have agreed 
on 
supporting 
hospitals. 
We 
have 
agreed on unemployment insurance. 
We have agreed on direct payments. So 
much that is in this legislation has ap-
peared in previous bipartisan legisla-
tion. So we are not asking people to do 
something they haven’t done before. 
But there are some things that we 
want to add, the postal system, more 
for voting—but they did vote for the 
vote-by-mail legislation before—a very 
strong OSHA regulation that mandates 
certain conditions so that our workers 
will be protected and that our employ-
ers will know what the standards are 
clearly that they must honor and, 
therefore, they are protected as well. 
b 1500 
Now, some of the Members say: Let’s 
take a pause. 
Let’s take a pause? Do you think this 
virus is taking a pause? Do you think 
that the rent takes a pause? Do you 
think that putting food on the table, or 
the hunger that comes if you can’t, 
takes a pause? The hardship of losing a 
job doesn’t take a pause. Or tragically 
losing a loved one, it doesn’t take a 
pause. 
So many lives may have been saved if 
we had testing, tracing, and treatment 
earlier on. Now, that is a lesson to us 
that that is what we must do so that 
we can end this. But we don’t end it by 
pausing in the fight. 
This virus is relentless. It is possibly 
mutating, changing its nature. This is 
a very difficult fight. 
It gives us a moment that we must 
admit that the American people are 
suffering deeply. We must have empa-
thy for the healthcare workers who, 
again and again, risk their lives to save 
lives and, again, are now at risk of los-
ing jobs of their own, as I said before. 
We must have empathy for the fami-
lies who are sick and the parents who 
are struggling to pay the rent and put 
food on the table. 
We must have empathy for families 
who have lost their loved ones. Can you 
just imagine losing a loved one so mys-
teriously, so out of the blue? Many peo-
ple can’t even embrace them or say 
good-bye because of the way the virus 
is communicated. 
We cannot abandon them in this time 
of need. To protect lives and livelihood, 
Members of Congress, House and Sen-
ate, must come together, as we have 
done, responding to the Republicans’ 
bills that they constructed on their 
own in the Senate, and now we offer 
back something that contains much of 
what they offered, a little more, be-
cause the needs are greater. 
We must pass this bill to give the 
families the relief they need. These are 
the American people. This is our fam-
ily. They are suffering. They need help. 
We have the resources and the oppor-
tunity to do so. 
It is interesting to me, and so sad for 
me, as a mother and grandmother of 
children who are younger and college 
age, that this is the time that they 
would have been enjoying graduation. I 
have spoken at many, many, many 
graduations, 
watching 
hundreds 
of 
thousands of students walk across that

stage, to see the pride in their families, 
many of them the first in their families 
to graduate from college, to see the 
symbol of success, love, and joy that it 
is for those families. They will be miss-
ing that ritual, sadly, whether it is col-
lege, high school, or, in my case, grade 
school, and even going into middle 
school. 
President Kennedy said that children 
are our ‘‘greatest resource’’ and our 
‘‘best hope for the future.’’ They are 
our hope, but we must also give them 
hope as they go forward by alleviating 
the challenge our country is facing and 
make the future better for them. It is 
always about the children and their fu-
ture. 
I urge our colleagues to consider all 
of those children all over America, but 
also in their own States, in their own 
districts, as they make their decision 
today that is so important to our coun-
try. 
That is why I am so grateful, Mr. 
Speaker, to have a distinguished chair-
woman, Chair NITA
LOWEY
of New 
York, as chair of the Appropriations 
Committee. She and many of our 
chairs of committees have been daz-
zling, dazzling with a depth of knowl-
edge of the subjects, the extent of leg-
islative 
brilliance 
that 
they 
have 
brought to all of this, knowing the 
challenge, understanding the policy, 
strategically thinking about how we 
can best accomplish and use money. 
This is not a Christmas tree. There is 
nothing joyful about this. This is a 
very strategically planned piece of leg-
islation that is tailored strictly to 
meet the needs of the American people 
regarding the coronavirus pandemic. 
To do anything less would not be re-
sponsible. There is more we could have 
done, but again, we wanted to keep the 
cost in line. 
When you talk about the cost, you 
have to think about the opportunity 
lost. The Chairman of the Fed has told 
us to think big. It is never going to be 
cheaper, he said, because the cost of in-
terest is so low, the cost of credit is so 
low. 
And I say, not to act now is not only 
irresponsible in a humanitarian way, 
but it is irresponsible because it is only 
going to cost more, more in terms of 
lives and livelihood, cost to the budget, 
cost to our democracy, as Governors, 
city halls, and county executives strug-
gle to make their budgets so depleted 
by this virus. 
This funding is to make sure that 
they have the funds to take care of 
some of the funding for the coronavirus 
expenses directly, but also a recogni-
tion of the loss of revenue to their 
budgets because of this assault on our 
economy by this vicious little virus 
that we must defeat. 
As we do that, Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chairwoman for her 
extraordinary leadership. She has a few 
more bills to go, a lot of time left, a 
great contribution to make. I had the 
privilege of serving with her for dec-
ades, and I am sorry to see her leave 
the Congress, but she leaves a tremen-
dous legacy. 
We all believe that a budget should 
be a statement of our national values. 
What is important to us as a Nation 
should be reflected in our budgets and 
how we allocate our resources. 
Chairman LOWEY has been just that 
messenger of values as she has put 
forth her budgets, and she does so with 
respect for the Republicans on her 
committee, in this Congress, and in 
this country. Bipartisanship is the 
order of the day. 
As a former member of the Appro-
priations Committee, where I was 
forged, 
and 
the 
Intelligence 
Com-
mittee, I recognize full well the prod-
uct, as Mr. COLE said, of appropriators 
working together. I always say, left to 
their own devices, they can get the job 
done, and they will. 
I have no doubt that this legislation 
will have bipartisan support. I just 
want it to be soon because these Gov-
ernors can’t wait. Right now, as I said, 
they have many layoffs because they 
don’t have the money. Are they going 
to raise property taxes? We can make 
that go away in large measure if we 
pass this legislation because it is not 
just about their budgets; it is about the 
services for the people of our country 
that will be lessened if we do not help. 
What are we here for, but for the 
American people? How are their serv-
ices delivered? In many ways by the 
statehouses and the State legislatures, 
the city councils, mayors’ offices, and 
the rest. We have a responsibility to 
make the strategic spending that we 
need to do. That is what this bill does. 
It is not for us to praise our heroes. 
Everybody praises them, thanks them, 
and honors them—words. We need 
deeds, and we need real support for 
them. We must always—this is the sad-
dest part, all these people who have 
died. 
I know, on both sides of the aisle, 
hearing our colleagues speak, that all 
of us will always carry those people in 
our hearts, 87,000 now. Hopefully, we 
can curtail the growth of that number 
with our testing, but we must make a 
decision to do so. That is the decision 
that we have to make here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my col-
leagues for their thoughtful and pray-
erful consideration of the HEROES 
Act. I thank all of you for your concern 
about the American people. Let us 
come together and give them a real sig-
nal that we care by allocating the re-
sources to meet their needs. 
We pray for all of them, all of our 
constituents, and we pray and thank 
God for continuing to bless America. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to 
support the HEROES Act. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, while our 
distinguished Speaker and I may dis-
agree on this particular bill, we cer-
tainly agree on our opinion of the 
chairwoman 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee and her ability to bring us 
together. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ADER-
HOLT), my good friend and distin-
guished ranking member of the Com-
merce, Justice, Science, and Related 
Agencies Subcommittee of the Appro-
priations Committee. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
for yielding to me. 
I rise today in strong opposition to 
this bill. No doubt, as has been said, 
State and local governments across 
this Nation are hurting because of the 
economic downturn this virus has cre-
ated. However, these times call for co-
operation. The Democrats, unfortu-
nately, have chosen partisanship. 
America needs us to come together 
to address this pandemic, but the 
Democrats chose their own way, shut-
ting out the Republicans in discussing 
this bill. Unfortunately, the Demo-
cratic leadership seems more inter-
ested in shaping the debate for Novem-
ber than solving the real problems that 
this country is going through today. 
Among the many concerns of this 
package is the election mandates. The 
Democrat pipe dream would lead to 
widespread voter fraud by allowing 
voter harvesting and prohibiting even 
States from requiring voter identifica-
tion. 
Let me be clear: This bill is chock- 
full of proposals that have absolutely 
nothing to do with addressing the eco-
nomic harms from the pandemic virus 
that we are experiencing in this Na-
tion. A $3 trillion liberal wish list is 
not a serious proposal. The United 
States of America, this country, de-
serves better. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY), my 
friend, a fellow New Yorker, an out-
standing Congresswoman from New 
York, and the chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good 
friend from New York for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of the HE-
ROES Act. This bill will provide over 
$67 billion in emergency relief to New 
York State, emergency aid that is des-
perately needed by a State that is on 
the front line of our national fight 
against the coronavirus. 
There is more than $17 billion that 
will flow directly to New York City, 
whose people continue to inspire the 
country with their resilience, courage, 
and compassion. 
The act includes crucial support for 
renters, which is especially important 
to my district. For people who have 
lost their jobs, the Federal Govern-
ment will pay their rent for them out 
of a $100 billion fund. 
As chair of the Oversight and Reform 
Committee, I helped lead a bipartisan 
effort to save the Postal Service from 
financial ruin. This bill will provide $25 
billion to ensure that it can continue 
serving the American public. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the numerous 
Members on both sides of the aisle who 
have joined me in fighting for this and

supporting this funding. This emer-
gency assistance will mean that we can 
avoid drastic service cuts at a time 
when American lives depend on the 
mail more and more every day. 
Recognizing that Congress has a con-
stitutional responsibility to ensure a 
fair and accurate Census, this bill ex-
tends certain reporting deadlines. The 
administration has asked for this delay 
as a result of the coronavirus crisis, 
which caused key operations of the 2020 
Census to be postponed. 
The bill would also enhance congres-
sional oversight of Census operations. 
This administration has fought legiti-
mate oversight tooth and nail, and the 
bill has added protections for this es-
sential function. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this crucial legislation. 
b 1515 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CALVERT), my very good 
friend and the distinguished ranking 
member of the Subcommittee on De-
fense Appropriations. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the HEROES 
Act. With $3 trillion in spending, there 
are plenty of giveaways for liberal pri-
orities, such as handouts for illegal im-
migrants and failed pension systems, 
yet there is no funding for the defense 
industrial base. 
Today, as we debate these measures, 
adversaries around the world are test-
ing our ability to defend ourselves as 
we battle this virus and the economic 
impact. But instead of shoring up our 
defense industrial base, which is com-
prised of businesses in every one of our 
districts, the majority ignores the 
clear and present danger of those who 
wish to exploit this crisis. 
China continues to secure its vision 
of regional dominance. Rather than 
spending billions of dollars to keep 
people dependent on the government, 
why not put them to work building 
more Virginia-class submarines, Joint 
Strike Fighters, amphibious combat 
vehicles, expeditionary sea bases, MQ–9 
Reapers, satellites. 
Let’s accelerate the next generation 
of weapons systems, including the Co-
lumbia-class submarines, the new frig-
ate, 
the 
B–21 
Long-Range 
Stealth 
Bomber, the Army’s Future Vertical 
Lift program. 
The defense industrial base is com-
prised of hundreds of thousands of com-
panies, from the primes to the 10-per-
son shops making nuts and bolts. It is 
the small innovator that disrupts the 
system and provides leap-ahead tech-
nology. It is a critical industry that is 
completely ignored in the bill. 
I am opposed to the bill for many 
reasons. It is a roadmap to an even 
more authoritative Federal Govern-
ment, a first step toward a socialist 
system. But today I stand for the men 
and women of the United States Armed 
Forces and the defense community 
that supports them. As the beacon of 
freedom and democracy in the world, 
we must send a message that will not 
allow for bad actors to take advantage, 
and we will continue to be the world’s 
superpower through our ability to 
project force to any corner of the 
world. 
This bill is a retreat from our values 
and our place in the world. Americans 
don’t want unlimited handouts and de-
pendence; they want to work, innovate, 
and succeed. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. NADLER), my friend, the out-
standing chairman of the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, we find ourselves at a 
critical moment: 1.4 million Americans 
are sick; nearly 90,000 people have died; 
36 million Americans are out of work. 
My constituents in New York have 
been at the epicenter of this pandemic 
for months. While this bill is not per-
fect, it goes far to support the country 
and New Yorkers. 
First and foremost, State and local 
governments will see nearly $1 trillion 
dollars in funding to fill the massive 
gaps in their budgets and prevent huge 
cuts to critical services. For New York 
State and New York City, that funding 
will mean the difference between re-
covery and total economic collapse. 
I am proud the HEROES Act includes 
two bills I introduced: the COVID–19 
Correctional Facility Emergency Re-
sponse Act, for testing, treatment, and 
prevention of COVID–19 in prisons and 
jails; and the Public Safety Officer 
Pandemic Response Act, which will 
make sure that our brave first respond-
ers who die or become disabled get 
their benefits. The bill also includes 
many priorities for the Judiciary Com-
mittee, like additional funding for the 
Violence Against Women Act to ad-
dress the surge in domestic violence, 
funding for Legal Aid and local law en-
forcement, and a ban on price gouging. 
The bill includes $100 billion for rent-
al assistance, $75 billion for home-
owners assistance so people don’t lose 
their homes, and financial support for 
the frontline and essential workers 
keeping our country running. 
It is vital that door staff who have 
been working every day in our apart-
ment and office buildings qualify for 
this additional pay. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to make 
sure that happens. 
The bill finally puts in place a com-
prehensive, nationwide, science-based 
strategy for testing and contact trac-
ing that is essential to limit the spread 
of the pandemic and to get our econ-
omy open again. 
Additionally, the bill improves PPP 
and makes loan forgiveness much easi-
er to achieve for millions of small busi-
nesses. Nonprofits, the backbone of 
New York’s economy, and housing co-
operatives will also now be eligible for 
PPP. 
The Postal Service, which has been a 
lifeline for American families since 
George Washington and small busi-
nesses during the pandemic, will also 
receive much-needed funding to keep 
services running. 
The bill is not perfect, but it is essen-
tial. I urge everyone to vote for it. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WOMACK), my good friend, and 
the distinguished Republican ranking 
member on the Budget Committee, as 
well as a valued member of the Appro-
priations Committee. 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, let me say before I get 
to the contents of my remarks, not lost 
on me is the work that Mr. COLE is 
doing today as a Rules Committee 
member and managing the debate that 
we just had, managing this debate with 
Appropriations. He is a real iron man 
today, and I just want to publicly 
thank him for the longstanding work 
that he is doing in support of our work 
here today. 
Mr. Speaker, here we are in the peo-
ple’s House debating nothing more 
than a real partisan grab bag, and it is 
an expensive one. What we see as a cri-
sis, Mr. Speaker, the other side sees as 
an opportunity to exert leverage: no 
collaboration, no transparency, no Re-
publican input. They can’t even wait 
until the trillions of dollars we have al-
ready spent is completely out the door 
before coming back for more. 
Why? Because this is not about a re-
sponse to the coronavirus; it is about 
implementing an agenda. Many of the 
items in this bill were already part of 
the liberal agenda before we could even 
say ‘‘coronavirus.’’ 
What does the federalizing of elec-
tions have to do with COVID–19? 
What does the SALT deduction that 
has been a source of contention with 
the other side have to do with COVID– 
19? 
How about forgiving $10,000 of stu-
dent loan debt? How did that get in the 
conversation with our response to 
coronavirus? 
The Postal Service bailout, multiem-
ployer pensions—are you kidding me? 
Mr. Speaker, the people deserve bet-
ter. This bill is not going anywhere, 
and they know it and we know it. 
It is appropriate, Mr. Speaker, that 
the conversations that are taking place 
today on this floor about this bill are 
being done behind a mask because no 
one can argue this with a straight face. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Arkansas. 
Mr. WOMACK. As I was saying, it is 
appropriate that we are having this 
conversation, in many respects, behind 
a mask, because there is nobody on 
this floor today who can argue with a 
straight face that many of the provi-
sions in this bill that we are debating 
right now are related to coronavirus or 
have any sense of congressional ur-
gency.

May 15, 2020 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. NEAL), my friend and the 
chairman of the Committee on Ways 
and Means, who came to Congress in 
the same class as I did. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding and for her 
kind comments. 
I am delighted to stand in support of 
H.R. 6800, the HEROES Act. It also 
could be called the confidence in the 
American people act. This legislation 
responds to the reality that 85,000 
Americans have lost their lives, 36 mil-
lion Americans are now without a job, 
and our thoughts are with those fami-
lies today. I am delighted with the role 
that Ways and Means once again 
played in stepping up to deliver solu-
tions in this latest legislation. 
The HEROES Act includes a second 
round of economic impact payments to 
keep 
Americans 
afloat 
and 
infuse 
money back into the economy; liquid-
ity, every economist has suggested 
that. This round is more substantial 
for families and fixes shortcomings in 
the first round of payments, like those 
of college students and others who are 
dependent on parents. 
We enhanced the employee retention 
tax credit. This expanded version will 
come to the aid of 60 million Ameri-
cans. The majority of those are em-
ployees of small and midsized busi-
nesses. 
April brought about the worst plunge 
in unemployment since the Great De-
pression. We have extended the weekly 
Federal unemployment compensation 
payments through January of next 
year. 
Frontline 
workers 
who 
haven’t 
stopped since this crisis began we now 
know are under great pressure. We pro-
vide 
flexible 
funding 
to 
support 
childcare and adult daycare for essen-
tial workers to ease this burden. 
The Ways and Means Committee also 
had a role in providing provisions to 
address the persistent public health 
emergency that is gripping the Nation. 
We led the charge to make investments 
in nursing home safety, as these facili-
ties have been ravaged by the virus. 
This bill was a team effort. Thank 
you to my Ways and Means Committee 
members for their contributions, who 
have been working around the clock 
with the staff to get this legislation be-
fore us today. 
I sought out Jay Powell’s advice on 
this from day one, in the early begin-
ning. He said just a couple of days ago, 
‘‘additional fiscal support could be 
costly but worth it if it helps avoid 
long-term economic damage and leaves 
us with a stronger recovery.’’ 
This is about balance right now. This 
is about relief and stability, which will 
hasten recovery. What we are doing 
here today will be, in fact, a fact-based 
approach to save the lives and liveli-
hoods of the American people. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN), my very 
good friend and the ranking member on 
the Homeland Security Committee of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in strong opposition to this 
bill. 
This great Chamber has passed four 
bills, four bipartisan, bicameral bills 
that the House, the Senate, Repub-
licans, 
Democrats, 
and 
the 
White 
House could agree on. This bill is not 
that. It is 3 trillion more dollars of un-
restrained spending. 
When given the opportunity, the peo-
ple’s House does need to speak up and 
does need to lead, but we need to lead 
on economic common ground, not on 
partisan grounds that will never pass 
outside of this Chamber. 
I spoke with a young man yesterday 
who showed me a picture of his 6-year- 
old daughter. I spoke with a friend yes-
terday at Saint Mary’s school in Oak 
Ridge, where they are having a gradua-
tion. 
This is not a giving; it is a taking. 
We are burdening the American people 
with over $30 trillion worth of national 
debt. 
Mr. Speaker, where does our debt go? 
It goes on the backs of future genera-
tions. 
And worse, who buys our debt? China, 
other countries. 
We are heading in the wrong direc-
tion. I plead with the majority to 
change this bill; come together, as we 
have done in the past. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this. I urge us 
to stand up and do the work for the 
hardworking Americans who are justly 
scared, justly concerned. We owe that 
to them. We represent them, and that 
is our job, and that is our calling. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), the outstanding 
chairman of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and another member of 
our great class. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today in strong support of the 
HEROES Act. Our top priority is the 
health and safety of the American peo-
ple, and the HEROES Act lays the 
foundation we will need to safely re-
open the economy. 
Contrary to my Republican col-
leagues, this legislation is directly re-
lated to the pandemic. Our legislation 
builds out national testing and contact 
tracing by finally requiring the Trump 
administration to develop comprehen-
sive plans with clear benchmarks and 
timelines. 
We also mandate a national czar and 
supply chain to guarantee that medical 
supplies, 
testing 
equipment, 
drugs, 
and, ultimately, vaccines are available 
to all Americans. 
The bill also provides States with ad-
ditional increases for their Medicaid 
programs to ensure that Americans 
don’t lose their health insurance, and 
it ensures that all COVID–19 treat-
ments and vaccines are free of cost- 
sharing for patients, as we did with 
previous legislation for testing. 
The HEROES Act, Mr. Speaker, pro-
tects vulnerable patients in nursing 
homes by providing funding for States 
to establish and deploy strike teams, 
manage outbreaks, and assist with 
clinical care, infection control, and 
staffing. 
This legislation also helps families 
stay connected. It ensures that they 
don’t lose critical utility services. It 
prevents home energy and water serv-
ice shutoffs and establishes a new pro-
gram to provide water bill assistance 
for low-income households. 
We 
also 
prohibit 
telephone 
and 
broadband service providers from stop-
ping service, and provide bill assist-
ance to low-income families and those 
who have lost their jobs. 
The HEROES Act also provides fund-
ing to schools and libraries to purchase 
hotspots, connected devices, and other 
equipment. 
And finally, Mr. Speaker, we go after 
price gougers by providing the Federal 
Trade Commission and State attorneys 
general the authority to seek civil pen-
alties from those engaging in price 
gouging of goods and services. 
Mr. Speaker, the HEROES Act is a 
bold next step in our process of pro-
tecting the American people and pro-
viding critical assistance during this 
crisis, and it is designed to try to end 
this pandemic, ultimately. It deserves 
strong bipartisan support. 
b 1530 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. 
RUTHERFORD), 
my 
very 
good 
friend, an esteemed member of the Ap-
propriations Committee, and today of 
all days, a career law enforcement offi-
cer as well. Mr. Speaker, we honor him 
for his service and his colleagues for 
their service to all of us. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Oklahoma for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to this political and insincere at-
tempt at coronavirus relief. 
Over the past few months, Congress 
came together in a bipartisan way and 
passed four major packages to combat 
coronavirus, but now, for whatever rea-
son, the Speaker has decided she is 
done working with Republicans. 
Despite what you may hear from my 
friends on the other side of the aisle, 
they know this is not a serious bill. 
They also know that it was drafted in 
secret, without input from the minor-
ity, and many of them are just as dis-
appointed that there was no attempt at 
bipartisanship. 
Mr. Speaker, almost 40 million Amer-
icans are out of work, and here we are 
in Washington considering a bill that 
will never, ever become law. 
How do you think those unemployed 
Americans feel right now? 
I would say that they are not inter-
ested in watching the Speaker, who is 
still receiving a full salary, by the way, 
play these political games. 
I do support elements of this bill.

So let me be clear: I do support addi-
tional coronavirus relief for hard-
working Americans. I also support 
sending additional relief to States and 
cities to help them respond to the 
coronavirus and its costs. 
However, I will not ask taxpayers to 
wipe out years of debt many of these 
localities incurred long, long before the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Let’s get back to working together 
and write a bill we can all support. 
Take out federalizing the elections 
process, which should be left to the 
States; take out the early release of 
criminals; take out the incentives for 
illegal immigration; take out all of the 
new government programs that keep 
communities from reopening and keep 
people from getting back to work. 
We can do this the right way, but 
this isn’t it. 
Our constituents expect better, and 
so should we. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT), the chairman of the 
Committee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
HEROES Act. 
The bill confronts the unprecedented 
pandemic that we are facing by first di-
recting significant funding to State 
and local governments. Without this 
funding, they will have to make dev-
astating cuts, especially in education, 
public safety, and basic services. 
Then it funds education to address 
the unique challenges created by the 
pandemic. K–12 funding would be avail-
able for technology, summer programs, 
special education, and initiatives to re-
duce the achievement gaps. It funds 
higher education to support students 
and maintain their institutions. It pro-
vides relief for student loans, con-
tinuing the present relief from pay-
ments, as well as interest accrual, and 
extending that relief to virtually all 
student loans, both Federal and pri-
vate. That relief goes to virtually all 
student loans. Then we target addi-
tional relief to students most in need 
of relief. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill supports fami-
lies by continuing the enhanced and ex-
panded unemployment benefits, in-
creasing SNAP benefits, and delivering 
another round of stimulus checks. It 
also protects healthcare insurance, so 
that under this bill, when you lose your 
job, you do not have to lose your 
health insurance. 
The bill helps contain the pandemic 
by funding contact tracers so that 
those who have been in contact with 
those who test positive can be identi-
fied and they can isolate themselves. 
Finally, the bill makes our work-
place safer by requiring OSHA to pro-
mulgate and enforce clear standards to 
protect workers from COVID–19. 
For our front-line workers, it author-
izes premium pay for their heroic 
work. 
This bill is a necessary response to 
today’s health crisis. It enables work-
ers and families to survive the pan-
demic. 
If States don’t get this money, the 
public will be inflicted with drastic 
cuts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the legislation. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BRADY), my very good friend, the 
distinguished past chairman of the 
Ways and Means Committee and cur-
rent ranking member. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. COLE for his remarkable leadership 
during these challenging times. 
What are we doing here? 
Our Nation is fighting a vicious bat-
tle for lives and jobs, yet Democrats 
waste time bringing a partisan, polit-
ical, and dead bill to the House, never 
asking Republicans to work together. 
It is shameful. 
As one House Democrat who opposes 
this bill said, ‘‘This isn’t the time for 
partisan gamesmanship. This is the 
time to find common ground.’’ 
Democrats parrot ‘‘go big, go big.’’ 
What they didn’t do is ‘‘go smart’’ to 
stimulate this economy. 
This bill guarantees a prolonged re-
cession. It leaves 36 million jobless 
Americans behind, but it delivers big 
for Democratic special interests. 
What do mail-in ballots, marijuana 
banking, bailing out failed union pen-
sions, and releasing criminals early 
have to do with America’s struggling 
economy? Absolutely nothing. 
The word ‘‘cannabis’’ even occurs 
more often than the word ‘‘job’’ in this 
bill. 
As we continue to battle this virus, 
Republicans believe Congress should 
‘‘go smart.’’ 
Our top economic priority is to make 
sure the millions of Americans who 
have lost their jobs temporarily don’t 
lose them permanently, because lost 
jobs mean more drug and alcohol 
abuse, more domestic violence, more 
crime in the streets, and shorter life-
spans. 
We need to reopen our economy safe-
ly, help our local businesses rebuild 
their 
workforce 
and 
remake 
their 
workplaces 
so 
they 
are 
safe 
and 
healthy. 
Instead, Democrats encourage mil-
lions of Americans to stay unemployed 
even if a good, safe job is offered. 
If you get paid more than your salary 
not to work and have good healthcare, 
why would you go back? 
But next year, when these govern-
ment benefits all run out, don’t be sur-
prised that local businesses and jobs 
simply don’t exist anymore. 
This bill robs precious cash from 
local businesses struggling to survive, 
imposes costly mandates, provides a 
windfall to millionaires, and sends 
your hard-earned tax dollars to those 
here illegally. 
This bill imposes a gag order to pre-
vent the jobless from knowing their af-
fordable health options, uses your tax 
dollars to fund abortions, and chooses 
rebate checks over paychecks. How will 
this get workers back into jobs? 
It gets sadder. Democrats choose 
wealthy trial lawyers over our front- 
line healthcare workers, giving a green 
light to unleash frivolous lawsuits on 
hospitals, doctors, and local businesses 
doing everything they can to reopen 
safely. 
These heroes are already struggling 
with huge losses. Fighting trial law-
yers in court will only make it worse. 
We will hear today about why we 
need to spend hundreds of millions 
more for State and local governments 
who, without question, are battling so 
hard. 
But did you know that Congress has 
already funded over $760 billion to 
State and local communities? That is 
more than we have helped small busi-
nesses. 
Did you know that State and local 
governments are struggling to spend 
all that money by the end of the year? 
As the Houston mayor told us: ‘‘I don’t 
need more money. I just need the flexi-
bility to spend it where it is needed.’’ 
Did you know most small commu-
nities in America haven’t seen a dollar 
yet because many State governments 
are hoarding this crucial aid, refusing 
to pass it on to smaller counties and 
cities as Congress intended? 
Let’s fix these problems first. 
The bottom line is this bill is 
crammed with special interest hand-
outs but does nothing for the jobless. It 
guarantees more jobs will disappear 
while silly political games are played. 
This is an unprecedented crisis, and 
so many Americans have been heroic. 
They deserve a Congress that works to-
gether to help them regain their jobs, 
their savings, and their future. 
This bill is big: regrettably, a big fail 
for our economy. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO), the chairman of 
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, the pub-
lic health emergency our country is 
facing requires immediate, bold action. 
That is why I rise today in support of 
H.R. 6800, the HEROES Act. 
The HEROES Act will provide fami-
lies, workers, and veterans in our com-
munities with the support they ur-
gently need during this pandemic. 
As chairman of the House Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs, I am proud that 
this bill includes essential provisions 
to meet veterans’ needs. 
The HEROES Act authorizes VA 
healthcare for all veterans who have 
lost their health insurance due to the 
pandemic, including legislation intro-
duced by Subcommittee Chair Rep-
resentative PAPPAS to streamline the 
payment of emergency care claims to 
community providers. 
As a result of COVID–19, veterans are 
facing financial hardships due to job 
losses while vital services are strained, 
leaving vulnerable veterans without 
support.

May 15, 2020 
This bill includes provisions spon-
sored by Subcommittee Chair Rep-
resentative LEVIN enabling VA to pro-
vide greater support for homeless vet-
erans and their children. 
It also includes legislation from Rep-
resentative ALLRED increasing aid and 
attendance support by 25 percent for 
veterans and caregivers. Those who 
need assistance with daily activities 
must not be forgotten. 
In addition to these strong veteran 
provisions, the HEROES Act responds 
to the dire economic and healthcare 
challenge our Nation is facing. 
It provides $1 trillion in funding to 
support States and local governments 
in their response to this pandemic so 
that they can continue their essential 
services. 
It addresses the urgent needs of fami-
lies and workers by putting direct fi-
nancial assistance in the pockets of 
every American, creating a $200 billion 
Heroes Fund to give hazard pay to es-
sential workers, and providing assist-
ance to renters and homeowners. 
We are facing an extraordinary crisis. 
Congress needs to respond to it with 
the courageousness it demands. The 
health and livelihoods of the American 
people depend on it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. WALDEN), my very good friend, 
and the past chairman and current 
ranking member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my friend from Oklahoma, who 
has done such a good job. 
I rise today in opposition to this bill. 
It is deeply troubling to me that dur-
ing the worst pandemic in modern his-
tory and amidst a deep economic crisis, 
Democrats in the House continue to 
take a partisan path. 
As Republicans and the Trump ad-
ministration moved to respond quick-
ly, it was congressional Democrats who 
needlessly delayed the initial passage 
of the CARES Act and later caused a 
pointless week-long shuttering of the 
Paycheck Protection Program. How 
many jobs were lost because of that 
delay? 
And here we go again. According to 
Politico, 
‘‘Democrats 
acknowledge 
that their behemoth proposal, whose 
summary alone is 90 pages, is more of 
a talking point than legislation that 
they expect to become law.’’ 
Well, just from the Energy and Com-
merce Committee perspective alone, 
you have policies that amount to Fed-
eral Government takeovers of entire 
sectors of the economy, Mr. Speaker. 
There is a sweetheart deal for Med-
icaid compliance carved out only for 
the State of New York and no one else. 
The bill throws more good money 
after bad to the failing enrollment pro-
grams in ObamaCare and it violates 
years of bipartisan agreement to main-
tain 
Hyde 
protections 
on 
Federal 
healthcare spending. 
Why would Democrats spend weeks 
crafting what amounts to an 1,800-page 
progressive manifesto that is dead on 
arrival in the Senate? Why? 
Mr. Speaker, I again implore my 
friends across the aisle to please drop 
the partisan, petty politics. Let’s move 
forward in a united way for the coun-
try. That is what the people across 
America are doing, and that is what 
they expect us to do here in Congress. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ), the chairwoman 
of the Committee on Small Business. 
b 1545 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the HEROES Act, 
and I want to take this opportunity to 
thank the chairwoman from the Appro-
priations Committee for yielding. 
This bill contains important provi-
sions to help stop the economy’s free 
fall. For small businesses, it authorizes 
an additional $10 billion in disaster 
grants. 
It improves the PPP initiative, al-
lowing businesses under stay-at-home 
orders to extend the loan coverage pe-
riod until the end of the calendar year. 
Also, we are eliminating the 75–25 rule, 
to make it easier for small businesses 
to apply for PPP loans. It also sets 
aside 25 percent, or $30 billion, of the 
remaining funds for firms with fewer 
than 10 employees. 
Equally important, this legislation 
assists struggling families. In this bill, 
we increase funding for SNAP by 15 
percent to address the record increase 
in hunger that we are seeing in this 
country. The bill extends unemploy-
ment benefits, including $600 per week 
in pandemic unemployment insurance. 
For New Yorkers and hardworking peo-
ple in this country struggling with 
rent, this measure provides $100 billion 
in rental assistance. 
Many essential workers will receive 
hazard pay under this bill and better 
access to personal protective equip-
ment, like nurses, door persons, transit 
workers, and those cleaning buildings 
so that the rest of us stay safe. Those 
are the real heroes of this crisis, and 
the HEROES Act compensates them 
more appropriately. 
The HEROES Act will also help 
States and localities with enormous 
fiscal challenges. 
Finally, this bill puts forth a stra-
tegic plan to test, trace, and treat the 
virus. Until we have widespread test-
ing, consumer confidence will remain 
weak. 
I urge everyone to support this bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS), my very good friend, and the 
Republican ranking member on the 
House Administration Committee. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
House Democrats are once again tak-
ing advantage of a national emergency 
to push their own political agenda. We 
shouldn’t be surprised, as we have seen 
them push their wish list at every turn. 
We saw their attempts to federalize 
elections in H.R. 1; we saw it during 
the last coronavirus relief package ne-
gotiation; and we are seeing it again 
now. They are using the HEROES Act 
to nationalize election policy, not to 
help Americans vote, but to serve their 
own interests on election day. 
This entire package would cost tax-
payers $3 trillion, and at least $23 mil-
lion of that would be going toward 
their federal elections takeover. Con-
gress has already given $1.25 billion to 
States since 2018, $400 million alone to 
help States prepare for their elections 
amid this pandemic. 
What the Democrats are proposing is 
outrageous. They are also requiring all 
States to adopt ballot harvesting. Bal-
lot harvesting, in the way House Demo-
crats are trying to use it, is when any 
individual can pick up any voter’s bal-
lot for any reason and deliver it to the 
polling place, completely unchecked. 
They don’t have to provide their name. 
They don’t have to show their ID. They 
don’t have to be a resident of the 
State. They don’t have to be an Amer-
ican citizen. 
Why would we force States to allow 
for people who aren’t even eligible to 
vote to then handle their voters’ bal-
lots? 
This practice is so wrought with 
fraud that I released a report this 
week, before consideration of this bill, 
to highlight how ballot harvesting is 
being misused. It is a summary of 18 
months of work by the House Adminis-
tration Republicans on this issue. We 
found that this practice is one of the 
greatest threats to our ballot integ-
rity. 
In addition to this bill jeopardizing 
ballot integrity, it would also jeop-
ardize people’s health. How will ballot 
harvesting 
follow 
social 
distancing 
practices? Not to mention, allowing po-
litical operatives to pick up ballots is 
not necessary when mail ballots may 
have prepaid postage. Why does a bal-
lot broker need to go door to door to 
pick up a ballot when you can mail it 
in for free? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman from Illinois an additional 
30 seconds. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. One 
can only assume, Mr. Speaker, that 
this is only for political gain. 
That is only one of the egregious pro-
visions. The bottom line is, election 
day is less than 6 months away. States 
don’t have enough time to implement 
these egregious election rules. 
Last week, I received a letter from 
over 800 professors telling me to vote 
for this bill. A little research showed 
that 400 of them are donors to Demo-
crats. 
This is why this bill is politically 
motivated. It is a takeover of the elec-
tions at the national level. We need to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this.

May 15, 2020 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS), the dynamic chairwoman of 
the Committee on Financial Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 6800, the HE-
ROES Act. This legislation includes a 
number of important proposals from 
the members of the Financial Services 
Committee and builds upon my pro-
posal for more direct payments to fam-
ilies by providing a second round of 
stimulus payments for up to $6,000 per 
household. 
I am pleased that this bill includes 
legislation championed by myself and 
Representatives HECK
and SCOTT
to 
create a $100 billion emergency rental 
assistance fund and a $75 billion home-
owner assistance fund. 
The bill also provides $11.5 billion for 
homeless assistance grants and $1 bil-
lion for new Section 8 vouchers to sup-
port persons experiencing homeless-
ness. 
The HEROES Act also suspends nega-
tive credit reporting for all consumers. 
And to ensure that consumers, small 
businesses, and nonprofits can weather 
the pandemic, the bill suspends debt 
collection and requires forbearance and 
loan modifications for consumer and 
commercial loans. 
The HEROES Act strengthens the 
Defense Production Act to supercharge 
the production of diagnostic tests and 
personal protective equipment to pro-
tect our brave essential workers and 
help save American lives. 
Importantly, the legislation also pro-
vides new funding and expands tech-
nical assistance, government deposits, 
and partnerships to support our Na-
tion’s community development finan-
cial institutions, known as CDFIs, and 
minority 
depository 
institutions, 
MDIs, which serve our low-income 
communities particularly hit hard by 
the pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, we are obligated to pro-
tect our Nation. The HEROES Act rep-
resents the response America needs to 
meet this crisis, so I urge all Members 
to support this critical legislation. 
We hear Members on both sides of the 
aisle talking about how much they love 
America, how much they love their 
constituents. Put up or shut up. Now is 
the time to do it. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
FOXX), my friend, the past chair and 
current ranking member of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Oklahoma for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
opposition 
to 
H.R. 
6800, 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s socialist wish list act. At a 
time when Americans are stepping up 
for one another, it is truly disheart-
ening to watch House Democrats and 
Speaker PELOSI fail to deliver for our 
Nation’s families, workers, and busi-
nesses. 
As frustrating as it may be, it is not 
surprising. Democrats routinely dis-
regard their own party’s calls for bipar-
tisan collaboration and accountability 
by meeting in secret, behind closed 
doors, without committee consensus to 
craft partisan monstrosities like the 
one we are set to vote on. 
To satisfy the most extreme socialist 
left, Democrats are pushing a radical $3 
trillion scheme that includes taxpayer 
bailouts for union-run pensions and 
money to illegal aliens, which will do 
nothing to help this Nation combat 
COVID–19. 
This is not a relief package. It is 
Speaker PELOSI’s partisan, 1,800-page 
socialist shopping list. We should de-
feat it. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the distin-
guished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), the dynamic, 
hardworking, and committed chair of 
the Subcommittee on Labor, Health 
and Human Services, Education, and 
Related Agencies. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, the HE-
ROES Act is a critical $3 trillion rescue 
for our frontline workers, cities and 
States, and our small businesses. It 
creates the kind of modern-day safety 
net I have been fighting for with so 
many brave allies in and outside the 
U.S. Congress. 
Paid sick days and paid family and 
medical leave are now available to all 
workers, including those workers in 
warehouses, healthcare, grocery stores, 
pharmacies, and retail. 
The child tax credit is now available 
for all families, raised to $3,000 per 
child over 6 years old and a higher ben-
efit for younger children, cutting child 
poverty nearly in half. 
We raised the maximum food stamp 
benefit by 15 percent, bigger than in 
2009, and we purged President Trump’s 
$135 billion gift to real estate devel-
opers and hedge fund managers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: 
Let us act boldly and let us act swiftly 
for this Nation. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN), my good 
friend and the Republican ranking 
member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, in 1 week, the Demo-
crats have shown us exactly what they 
want to do. In 1 week’s time, May 8, 1 
week ago, seven Democrats on the 
House 
Select 
Committee 
on 
the 
Coronavirus Crisis sent a letter to Uni-
versal Stainless & Alloy Products in 
western Pennsylvania and they said: 
Give back your PPP money. 
Right here is the letter: ‘‘You have 
not returned these funds.’’ 
Three days later, May 11, four of our 
colleagues, two Democrats, two Repub-
licans, sent a letter to those seven 
Democrats and said: Hey, wait a 
minute. Universal Stainless followed 
the rules. They are entitled to their 
money. If they have to give it back, 
they will have to lay off steelworkers. 
And today, this bill does what? This 
bill does what? It gives tax dollars to 
illegal immigrants. 
In 1 week’s time, they took money 
from steelworkers to give it to illegal 
immigrants. That is the Democrats’ vi-
sion for their country. 
If for no other reason, that is why we 
should vote against this bill. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am de-
lighted to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), my 
friend, the distinguished chair of the 
subcommittee that does so much good 
work here. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chair LOWEY
for that gracious set- 
aside, and I wish to say that the Amer-
ican people expect Congress to have 
their backs. 
Our economy needs help with historic 
levels of unemployment bearing down, 
and the HEROES Act will provide a 
bridge of support to save lives and live-
lihoods of our families, workers, hos-
pitals, and small businesses on the 
front lines. Imagine those folks. 
Let me applaud all of those still 
working, facing an unknown killer. 
A huge win within this HEROES Act 
is significant and direct assistance to 
communities of all sizes that are hem-
orrhaging because of the costs of fire, 
police, and emergency squads. 
This legislation will finally make 
multiemployer pension plans whole as 
well. 
Today, the deep recession requires 
bold action by our Congress. American 
lives truly are on the line here at 
home. I urge all of my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this lifesaving bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN), 
my 
good 
friend, a distinguished member of both 
the Oversight and Reform Committee 
and the Education and Labor Com-
mittee. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
first point I would like to make is some 
people feel this bill is a political in-
strument that will never become law. I 
see the current leader in the polls for 
next year’s Presidential election sign-
ing this bill next February. So we have 
to pay careful attention to what is in 
it. 
b 1600 
I take three things out of this bill. 
First of all, another $3 trillion fur-
ther in debt together with the $3 tril-
lion we have already passed and the 
natural trillion-dollar deficit we have 
here. In the current year, we will go 
about $22,000 more in debt for every 
man, woman, and child in the country. 
The second thing we take out of this 
bill is it is designed to discourage 
work. We extend, by Wisconsin stand-
ards, another 6 months in which people 
will be paid the equivalent of $50,000 a 
year not to work, and we are moving 
the work requirements for SNAP. In 
other words, it is an embracing of the 
idea that we want to discourage work 
and destroy our economy.

Finally, it is this effort to get more 
and more people to come here illegally. 
We are removing the requirement that 
you have to have a Social Security 
number for the earned income tax cred-
it, and we are saying not only the new 
$1,200 per person but the old $1,200 per 
person will go to people who do not 
have a Social Security number. I can-
not think of a quicker way to ruin the 
country. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOL-
LUM), who is the chair of the Sub-
committee on Interior, Environment, 
and Related Agencies. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, Na-
tive American communities are facing 
extraordinary challenges during this 
pandemic. Like other minority com-
munities, they are disproportionately 
affected by COVID–19 with devastating 
loss of life and economic hardship. This 
pandemic has magnified the health dis-
parities and historic lack of resources 
that exist within Indian Country. The 
HEROES 
Act 
contains 
many 
non-
partisan priorities for Native Ameri-
cans, reflecting bipartisan work to 
meet their critical needs. 
I acknowledge my coworker, Mr. 
COLE, on the floor with me on this en-
deavor. 
Mr. Speaker, we are providing $900 
million through the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs to assist Tribal governments to 
operate essential community services 
and provide clean water and safe hous-
ing. $2.1 billion is for Indian Health 
Service to purchase additional PPE 
and provide Tribes more telehealth. 
The bill includes dollars for transpor-
tation, supports education for children, 
and $20 billion in direct relief to Tribal 
governments. 
The Federal Government must up-
hold its trust and treaty obligations to 
Tribal nations. This bill is critical to 
ensure the health and safety of our Na-
tive American brothers and sisters. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from the great State of Texas (Mr. 
CRENSHAW), who is a former Navy 
SEAL. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, to-
day’s theatrics are shocking. 
Thirty-five million jobs are lost. 
Businesses and livelihoods are ruined. 
While American grocers, nurses, and 
workers kept America going, Demo-
crats kept Congress in hiding for the 
past 3 weeks. Hiding is fear; it is not 
leadership. 
When we finally reconvened, we get 
this—Politico summed it up best: ‘‘Nei-
ther this bill nor anything resembling 
it will ever become law—it is a Demo-
cratic wish list filled up with all the 
party’s favored policies.’’ 
Is this a joke? Because it certainly 
isn’t based on reality. Reality would be 
working here for the last 3 weeks, ex-
amining each problem our Nation 
faces, and working together to find the 
best solutions. That shouldn’t be all 
that difficult since, I would presume, 
we still have the same goal: mitigate 
the virus and save our economy and so-
ciety. 
Right? That is still our goal, isn’t it? 
If it is, then stop playing games. 
Mr. Speaker, $3 trillion of virtue sig-
naling to your base is no way to govern 
in the midst of a crisis, and you know 
it. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), who is 
the chair of the House Democratic Cau-
cus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair for her leader-
ship. 
More than 80,000 Americans dead, 35 
million unemployed, the economy in 
recession—there is pain; there is suf-
fering; and there is death throughout 
the land. Congress must act to provide 
relief to the American people. 
We must support our State and local 
governments. We must strengthen un-
employment insurance. We must pro-
vide an additional round of direct stim-
ulus payments to everyday Americans. 
We must provide hazard pay to our he-
roes and our essential workers. We 
must increase access to testing, trac-
ing, and treatment. 
There is pain; there is suffering; and 
there is death throughout the land. 
Congress must act with the fierce ur-
gency of now—not tomorrow, not next 
week, not next month, now. Vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on the HEROES Act. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON), who 
is a member of the Armed Services 
Committee and the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I oppose this parade of ab-
surdities on behalf of America’s stu-
dents 
and 
grandchildren—Addison, 
Houston, Emily Ruth, Michael, Anna 
Grace, Jack, Sally, and Katherine— 
who will be burdened by debt. 
On Monday, I saw the best of Amer-
ica in my birthplace of Charleston. I 
was with Boeing CEO David Calhoun as 
he presented planes full of PPEs to 
MUSC President David Cole, showing 
our appreciation for health profes-
sionals. I thank Doctors Balbir Minhas 
and Shalini Mittal for my N95 mask. 
This was private business, not gov-
ernment, protecting American fami-
lies. All levels of government were 
present: municipal with Mayor Keith 
Summey 
of 
North 
Charleston 
and 
Mayor John Tecklenburg of Charles-
ton, county with council Chairman El-
liott Summey, State with Governor 
Henry McMaster and Senator Marlon 
Kimpson, and Federal with Senator 
TIM
SCOTT
and 
Congressmen 
JOE 
CUNNINGHAM and RALPH NORMAN. Re-
publicans and Democrats are working 
together. 
Just 11 weeks ago today, I was at the 
same airport with President Donald 
Trump and 30,000 supporters thanking 
him for record job creation. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Ms. 
CLARK), who is a leader of our Caucus 
and a member of the Committee on Ap-
propriations. 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, we can’t wish away this pan-
demic. We can’t accept the false choice 
that we either reopen or lose to the 
virus. No. We must protect the Amer-
ican people and the institutions and 
values that define our Nation with ac-
tion. 
The HEROES Act provides us a path 
forward. We will save lives with test-
ing, tracing, and treatment. We will 
protect our communities by supporting 
our teachers, police, and frontline 
workers. We will bring relief to fami-
lies by providing them financial aid, 
food, rent relief, and healthcare. We 
will protect the sanctity of our democ-
racy by honoring every American’s 
vote. 
We vote today knowing we have more 
hard days ahead and more work to do 
to ensure we don’t just return to nor-
mal but that we emerge stronger, more 
just, and more prepared for the chal-
lenges ahead. Today, we vote for our 
heroes, for our future, and for the peo-
ple. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. COMER), who is a 
member of the Agriculture, Education 
and Labor, and Oversight and Reform 
Committees. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, hypocrisy 
and irresponsibility are alive and well 
today in this Chamber. 
At the same time NANCY PELOSI is 
calling for oversight of the $3 trillion 
we have already spent, she is bringing 
up a reckless bill to spend $3 trillion 
more. 
Much of this bill has nothing to do 
with COVID–19. Instead, this bill is a 
radical Democrat wish list: permanent 
mail-in voting, amnesty and stimulus 
checks for illegal immigrants, and 
more incentives for Americans not to 
work. 
Across America, citizens are coming 
together to help their friends and 
neighbors. For all its faults, Congress 
did come together in a bipartisan way 
to pass numerous measures to fight 
this pandemic. But Speaker PELOSI has 
broken that spirit of cooperation. In 
choosing to play partisan politics and 
go at this one alone, she has set a ter-
rible example for a nation in crisis. In-
stead of pausing the spending to evalu-
ate our needs and engage with Presi-
dent Trump and the Senate, we are 
here today simply to appease the fringe 
elements of the Democratic Party. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS), 
who is a member of the Committee on 
Appropriations. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, a Boy 
Scout named Noah from Peoria, Illi-
nois, wrote to me. He heard his city 
council talking about layoffs in the 
wake of COVID–19. Noah understands 
that we have failed towns like his. He

wrote: ‘‘Many people are going to lose 
their jobs. Some of those will be fire-
fighters and police officers. That will 
not help my city. . . . The city will not 
be as safe.’’ 
Noah, I hear you. Today, the United 
States House of Representatives hears 
you. 
With $915 billion for State and local 
assistance, we will help towns and cit-
ies like Noah’s. We will also expand as-
sistance to small businesses and farm-
ers and keep families afloat. 
This isn’t the final battle in the war 
against this virus, but the HEROES 
Act will increase American security— 
our food, health, and workplace secu-
rity. I will vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE), who is 
a member of the Homeland Security 
and Small Business Committees. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, in every neighborhood across 
our country, Americans are struggling 
with the health and economic ramifica-
tions of the coronavirus. 
As schools are closed and small busi-
nesses stay shuttered, American fami-
lies are just trying to make it one day 
at a time. Here in Congress, House 
Democrats are just trying to fund 
Planned Parenthood. 
American families are focused on 
putting food on their tables. Here in 
Congress, Democrats are focused on 
keeping Americans out of work instead 
of saving family-sustaining jobs. 
American families are working to-
gether to weather this storm. Here in 
Congress, 
Democrats 
would 
rather 
blame our President than hold the Chi-
nese Communist Party accountable for 
their role in this pandemic. 
Here in Congress, Democrats are 
wasting time that we could be using to 
deliver real solutions for the American 
people. This bill is not the answer, and 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), who is the chair-
man of the Legislative Branch Sub-
committee. 
Mr. RYAN. I have to tell you, Mr. 
Speaker, this is absolutely unbeliev-
able. Just a few years ago, the stock 
market is at 25,000; corporate profits 
are the highest they have been in dec-
ades; the rich keep getting richer; and 
our friends on the other side say: What 
do we do now? Let’s do a tax cut where 
83 percent of it goes to the top 1 per-
cent of the wealthiest people. 
Fast forward a few months: global 
pandemic; 36 million people unem-
ployed; 40 percent of families who have 
a worker who makes $40,000 a year or 
less lost their job last month; 4 million 
people didn’t pay their rent; and the 
Republican Party says: We don’t have 
any money to help you. 
Are you kidding me? Where do you 
guys live? Food lines around the blocks 
at our food banks in the United States 
of America, and one in five kids are 
going hungry. Your party can’t even 
get food to them. 
This isn’t a wish list. If it is a wish 
list, it is for the working-class people. 
How about the Teamsters who are 
going to get a pension when this bill 
passes? If we don’t act, their pension 
gets cut in half. 
This is ridiculous. The Republicans 
are turning their backs on the Amer-
ican people. Let’s be honest. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my 
friend that we worked with our friends 
to pass four bills, $3 trillion in the last 
10 weeks. We would work with the ma-
jority again if they would sit down and 
bargain with us. Sadly, they decided 
not to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON), who is a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee. My very 
good friend is a great neighbor. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, Dem-
ocrat leadership has established in this 
piece of legislation a new pandemic 
protocol for the United States Con-
gress: 
the 
practice 
of 
reality 
distancing. Reality distancing is the 
unhealthy distance between politicians 
and their policies and the people they 
were elected to serve. 
While tens of millions of working 
families have lost their livelihoods and 
millions more are struggling to sur-
vive, Members of Congress won’t miss a 
single paycheck and are wasting pre-
cious time on a partisan bill that is 
going nowhere. 
Furthermore, Speaker PELOSI
and 
many of her colleagues are so anxious 
to appease the left, and so zealous to 
advance their ideology, they didn’t 
even attempt to disguise this parade of 
horribles that is completely out of 
touch with the American people. 
Some will suggest, Mr. Speaker, that 
this legislation is so extreme and ab-
surd we can’t take it seriously. I would 
submit that we can’t take it seriously 
enough. When someone tells you who 
they are, believe them. This isn’t just 
the Democrats’ plan for America’s re-
covery; this is their vision for America. 
I oppose it, and I pray to God none of 
these policies see the light of day. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), who is the chairwoman of 
the Subcommittee on Military Con-
struction, Veterans Affairs, and Re-
lated Agencies. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to support our best hope 
to prevent long-term economic damage 
and preserve a strong recovery. 
The Great Depression taught us long 
ago: do too little now and millions of 
temporary job losses will not vanish 
for years. 
With nearly 90,000 dead and 36 million 
out 
of 
work, 
any 
half-hearted 
coronavirus response is a cowardly re-
treat. 
The HEROES Act is a bold response. 
It lays out a safe, scientific path to re-
open America through vital testing, 
tracing, and treatment. It supports 
State and local governments, provides 
hazard pay, and puts more money in 
workers’ and families’ pockets. 
I am proud this bill prevents veterans 
from being burdened with co-pays or 
cost-sharing for COVID–19 preventative 
treatment or services and includes crit-
ical protections for VA healthcare pro-
fessionals. These heroes need help just 
like the ones we count on now: first re-
sponders; healthcare and postal work-
ers; teachers; sanitation, transit, and 
food service workers. 
We need bold action now to keep 
America standing. If we don’t act, it 
will cost a whole lot more to pick this 
Nation up off the ground later. 
By the way, I find it rich that the 
previous gentleman actually had the 
nerve and the audacity to quote Maya 
Angelou. She is rolling over in her 
grave and certainly would support this 
bill. 
b 1615 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from the 
great State of Mississippi (Mr. GUEST), 
my good friend, a member of the Com-
mittee on Ethics, Committee on For-
eign Affairs, and Committee on Home-
land Security. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
would forever fundamentally alter our 
elections. It would provide a bailout to 
unsustainable pensions. It would re-
lease criminals from jail. It would pro-
vide protection and payments to illegal 
aliens. And it would discourage individ-
uals from returning to work as we seek 
to reopen the economy. Furthermore, 
the $3 trillion price tag should be 
greatly concerning to every American. 
It is disappointing that the Demo-
crats developed this legislation behind 
closed doors and without consulting 
their Republican counterparts. The 
Speaker has presented a partisan bill 
that does more to divide our Nation 
than to address the current national 
crisis. 
The coronavirus outbreak is not a 
time for political posturing but is, in-
stead, a time to put country before 
party. Congress has worked in a bipar-
tisan way to respond to the needs of 
Americans, and I hope that future ne-
gotiations will return to that level of 
cooperation. 
Mr. Speaker, I intend to vote against 
this legislation, and I encourage my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE), a 
senior member of the Committee on 
Appropriations. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first, let me thank Madam Chair, our 
Speaker, our committee chairs—chair 
of the Black Caucus, Chairwoman 
BASS, and ROBIN
KELLY
chairs the 
Health Braintrust for the Black Cau-
cus—for working together with me to 
address the unequal impact of COVID 
on people of color and the poor and

tions rooted in our communities play

the lead role in recovery, including 
contact tracing. 
We are facing the worst health and 
economic crisis of our lifetime. Ele-
vated rates of infection and death are 
in communities of color. Heroic front-
line and essential workers being paid 
poverty wages. There are struggling 
small and minority-owned businesses, 
millions 
unemployed, 
and 
millions 
pushed into poverty. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
this House must fight for those who 
bear the brunt of this pandemic, not 
big corporations whose wealth permits 
them to weather this crisis. 
This pandemic has shone a light, 
mind you, on the systemic racism, in-
equality, 
and 
poverty 
endemic 
throughout the country. The bill in-
cludes $75 billion for testing, contact 
tracing, and treatment in the highest 
impacted areas. 
I am disappointed that we did not in-
clude Congresswoman JAYAPAL’s Pay-
check Guarantee Act; however, the 
Paycheck Guarantee Act would provide 
stability of a paycheck through this 
pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
embrace this in the future as we move 
forward. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from the 
great State of Arkansas (Mr. HILL), my 
very good friend and a distinguished 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE), my friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this legislation. 
Over the last 3 months, we have put 
together a series of bipartisan bills 
that 
are 
extraordinary, 
and 
they 
amount to $2.9 trillion in spending. 
While the amount $2.9 trillion is 60 per-
cent of what the Federal Government 
spends in an entire year, nonetheless, 
this bipartisan effort was essential to 
beat the virus and get our economy 
back to full capacity. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we vote on an-
other $3 trillion in spending when we 
haven’t even gotten all of the first 
phase of money out to our schools, to 
our hospitals, to our cities, to our 
States. We have not completed getting 
the money out to restart our economy. 
Yet the House majority has blocked 
the House from working bipartisanly 
and has cooked up this 1800-page bill in 
the Speaker’s hideaway. This proposal, 
much of which has nothing to do with 
the coronavirus, discourages work and 
delays our economic recovery. 
We need to assess our actions and 
bring bipartisan efforts to the floor to 
address the gaps. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am de-
lighted to yield 1 minute to the distin-
guished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
BISHOP), chair of the Subcommittee on 
Agriculture. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
From the ag appropriations, the bill 
provides: 
$10 billion for SNAP; 
$150 million for food banks; 
$3 billion for school food programs; 
$1.1 billion for WIC; 
$309 million for Rural Rental Assist-
ance. 
In addition, it provides: 
$1 trillion to States, counties, cities, 
territories, and Tribal governments; 
Hazard pay for essential workers; 
Free widespread testing, tracing, and 
treatment for every American; 
More direct payments to families. 
It requires safety in the workplace 
and support for really small businesses 
and nonprofits of all kinds. 
Mr. Speaker, it meets the challenges 
of COVID–19 for every single American, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote for it. 
It is a good bill. It is a good bill for 
America. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MEUSER), my good friend, 
a member of the Committees on Budg-
et, Education and Labor, and Veterans’ 
Affairs. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
COLE) for yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, for the past 2 months, 
Americans have shown resilience, grit, 
and patience. The viral and economic 
data project that we now can begin a 
safe, soft reopening of our economy. 
President Trump’s inclusionary, data- 
based leadership in this fight is helping 
to protect both lives and livelihoods. 
Congress has also responded effec-
tively in mitigating the effects of this 
public health and economic emergency. 
I am extremely disappointed, however, 
that this House Democrat bill was 
drafted with not only no Republican 
input, but no input from the American 
people. 
Where is the investment for transpor-
tation and infrastructure? 
Where is the funding to get our chil-
dren back to school or to support small 
businesses to open their businesses 
safely? 
Today, President Trump announced 
Operation Warp Speed to develop a vac-
cine for this virus. Where is this 
House’s investment towards finding a 
cure? 
Instead, this partisan wish list allows 
illegal immigrants to receive stimulus 
checks, removes local control of elec-
tions, and somehow cannabis is men-
tioned 68 times. 
What in the world cannabis has to do 
with this crisis, I don’t know. 
This is another bill going nowhere. 
The American people deserve better, 
especially now. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the distinguished gentle-
woman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON 
COLEMAN), a member of the Committee 
on Appropriations. 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to see us 
take up the HEROES Act today. From 
State aid to essential pay, this is a step 
toward making sure every American 
makes it through this crisis. 
But I want to draw attention to 
something equally pressing. On both 
sides of the aisle, this pandemic has al-
lowed us to agree that there is a floor 
below which we don’t want any family 
to fall. 
The truth is that, before COVID–19, 
countless Americans were just a per-
sonal or local or national disaster away 
from not paying rent, not buying gro-
ceries, or worse. COVID–19 is just one 
more crisis derailing their lives, par-
ticularly those of Brown and Black 
communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA), my 
very good friend and a member of the 
Committee on Financial Services. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to this $3 trillion 
liberal, partisan wish list. 
With our Nation facing an unprece-
dented challenge, this bill erodes the 
American people’s faith in government 
when the Speaker refuses to work in a 
bipartisan manner to move our Nation 
forward. 
Giving money to Planned Parent-
hood, 
creating 
marijuana 
diversity 
studies, and permanently rewriting our 
Nation’s election laws have nothing to 
do with the challenges we are currently 
facing and certainly do not help west 
Michigan job creators or their employ-
ees. 
Sadly, provisions in this bill actually 
disincentivize small businesses from 
opening or helping people get back to 
work in a safe and responsible manner. 
What the manufacturer in Kentwood, 
the pizza shop owner in Muskegon, or 
the farmers and growers I have heard 
from across west Michigan expect is for 
Congress to take a reasonable and re-
sponsible approach. That is not what is 
happening here today. 
This mother-of-all Christmas tree 
bills isn’t the HEROES Act. In fact, it 
should be called the cynical partisan 
act of 2020, and it has absolutely no 
chance of becoming law. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to reject this bill 
and turn our focus to helping our con-
stituents, safely reopening our econ-
omy, and defeating this virus. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, there 
has been a lot of discussion this morn-
ing about the HEROES Act as a polit-
ical agenda. It is an agenda for the peo-
ple of this country, providing economic 
relief to families who are suffering 
with direct cash payments, providing 
resources to protect our heroes on the 
front lines who are risking their lives 
to protect us, providing desperately 
needed money to cities and States to

protect against tax increases at the 
State and local level to make up for 
revenue losses, expanding testing and 
treatment to defeat this pandemic, 
supporting hospitals at the center of 
this crisis, and rental and mortgage as-
sistance for those struggling with these 
payments. 
So the question is: This the agenda 
for the people. The real question is why 
is it not your agenda? 
This is about responding in a com-
prehensive way to the hurt and devas-
tation this pandemic is causing. You 
ought to join us in this effort. The 
American people need action now, and 
they need your support on this legisla-
tion. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on the HEROES Act. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I just remind 
my friend we did join them in four 
bills. It might have been nice to be 
asked to join in a fifth. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. KUSTOFF), my good friend 
and a member of the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services. 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, COVID–19 should never 
be a political issue. Yet today, Demo-
crats have put forward an 1800-page bill 
filled with a wish list of policies draft-
ed with zero input from House Repub-
licans. 
Now is the time to get serious about 
helping 
the 
American 
people. 
We 
should be returning to Washington to 
get back to what we were elected to do, 
not vote on a messaging bill that has 
absolutely no chance of becoming law. 
Our country deserves better. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill was not a sin-
cere effort to address this pandemic. It 
is why I will be voting against Speaker 
PELOSI’s wish list bill. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. FRANKEL), a member of the 
Committee on Appropriations. 
b 1630 
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Speaker, the 
COVID pandemic has brought so much 
grief and desperation to so many peo-
ple, and we have seen how millions of 
Americans have rightfully stayed home 
to stay safe. 
Our healthcare personnel, our police, 
our firefighters, our teachers, and 
other vital workers, they have been in 
full force, many risking their own lives 
to save ours. Today, we make sure that 
these heroes on the front line get the 
pay that they need and deserve to do 
their jobs. I urge passage of the HE-
ROES Act. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. WENSTRUP), my very good friend 
who is a Member of the Ways and 
Means Committee and who has ren-
dered distinguished service to our 
country and to our institution. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, for 
the past two months, Ohioans have 
made countless sacrifices and stepped 
up to help each other in many, many 
ways. They flattened the curve, and 
now they want to get back to work 
smartly and safely. 
In the same vein, Americans need 
their representatives here in this body 
to be back to work, too. We should be 
working on legislative solutions that 
mark the first phase, phase one, of the 
recovery and reopening of the United 
States. 
Much of this partisan bill has noth-
ing to do with COVID–19 or the current 
crisis facing so many Americans. This 
bill, sadly, paints a vision for this Na-
tion that does not match our great his-
tory. 
The situation that we find ourselves 
in requires the best from all of us. This 
bill fails that test. Let’s make this our 
finest hour. Show what we can do, not 
what we can’t do. I oppose this bill. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CUELLAR), a member of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, Mark 
Twain said many years ago: ‘‘Thunder 
is impressive; but it is lightning that 
does the work.’’ 
Look, we can talk about doing 
things, or we can get the work done. I 
think today we should choose to get 
the action done. 
This is the first step that we need to 
take in order to help the folks that live 
in our district, the small businesses, 
the cities and the counties and the 
front-liners. 
We know what’s going to happen. We 
are going to go ahead and pass this bill, 
this particular bill. It is going to go 
over to the Senate. We will negotiate 
with the Senate. We will come back. 
And sometime in the near future, we 
will be voting, and this particular bill 
will become law. 
Mr. Speaker, we can either talk 
about doing things or we can take the 
first step. I choose to take the first 
step and get this bill moving. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to 
support this legislation, the HEROES 
Act. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. JOHN W. ROSE), my very 
good friend and member of the Finan-
cial Services Committee. 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, today I will be voting ‘‘no’’ on 
an 1,800-page, $3 trillion socialist wish 
list. This wish list is the product of 
partisan scrambling meant to take ad-
vantage of the present crisis brought 
on by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I, and the people in my district, 
won’t stand for it. I am from Tennessee 
where we balance our budgets, we don’t 
write checks we can’t cash, and where 
common sense is still king. 
Today, I will be using that common 
sense to represent the people of the 
Sixth District of Tennessee and vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), a member 
of the Committee on Appropriations. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the HEROES Act. This 
bold relief package recognizes the com-
mitment to our Postal Service, pro-
viding critical emergency funding for 
the fiscal solvency of the Postal Serv-
ice, to ensure we fulfill our democratic 
duties to be counted in the 2020 Census 
and vote in the upcoming primary. 
It also demonstrates that we will 
stay committed to our local govern-
ments to have the resources that they 
have lost during this pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, this investment is for 
our families, for our communities, and 
for our country. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), my very good 
friend and member of the Judiciary 
Committee 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, $3 
trillion divided by 129 million house-
holds means the average family will 
have to pay more than $23,000 for this 
single bill, either from their future 
taxes or from inflation robbing their 
savings and retirements. 
Now, when we passed the last bill, I 
warned it was no substitute for restor-
ing our Nation’s commerce imme-
diately for a simple reason: The Fed-
eral Government does not finance the 
economy; the economy finances the 
government. Government cannot put a 
single dollar into the economy that it 
has not first taken out of that same 
economy. 
The wholesale lockdown of the Amer-
ican people and the deliberate decima-
tion of their livelihoods has been the 
single most self-destructive folly in our 
Nation’s 
history. 
These 
draconian 
measures have proven much less effec-
tive at stopping the virus than we were 
assured but have been much more ef-
fective at destroying the jobs that peo-
ple rely upon to feed their families. We 
have had enough. 
Democrats, don’t take away our fu-
ture. Give us back our country. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, at 
least 84,000 people have died in the 
United States from COVID–19, and al-
most 40 percent of those deaths are 
nursing home residents and the valiant 
workers in those nursing homes. 
We can and we must do better. The 
HEROES Act includes $150 million for 
strike teams in nursing homes strug-
gling with outbreaks, requires public 
reporting of cases and deaths and PPE 
availability and testing in nursing 
homes, prioritizes testing for older 
Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA), my very good 
friend, a member of the Agriculture 
Committee and the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2233 
May 15, 2020 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
is a grab bag of Democrat priorities 
that have nothing to do with abating 
this virus. 
One of the most misplaced ones, how-
ever, is the addition of the SAFE Bank-
ing Act, which, if enacted, would finan-
cially green light the marijuana indus-
try. 
Think about that. Marijuana is still 
an illegal drug under the Federal 
Schedule I, yet this bill attempts to le-
gitimize this criminal enterprise. 
What is next? Shall we have safe 
banking for whale oil or shark fin 
sales? 
Again, what does this have to do with 
the supposed disaster relief legislation? 
As well, this bill contains H.R. 1 wish 
list items, including ballot harvesting, 
a 
shady 
practice 
where 
campaign 
operatives go door to door asking, or 
even coercing, people’s private ballots. 
How is this door-to-door practice sup-
posed to mitigate spreading the virus, 
the whole premise of this bill, sup-
posedly, being included in a $3 trillion 
emergency package? 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on this. These are items 
that have nothing to do with what we 
should be prioritizing in this time of 
crisis. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. BERA). 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, as a doctor 
and public health expert, I know we 
don’t defeat this virus until we have a 
safe and effective vaccine. It is time for 
the United States to work with the rest 
of world to develop that vaccine and in-
oculate the world. 
This bill allows U.S. global leader-
ship to reemerge. The President may 
not want to lead, but let the world 
know the United States Congress is 
ready to lead and work with CEPI and 
the rest of the world to defeat this 
virus. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SPANO), my very good friend and 
member of the Small Business Com-
mittee and the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee. 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
staunch opposition to H.R. 6800, the 
largest spending package ever consid-
ered and crafted without any input 
from Republicans in Congress. 
COVID–19 is impacting all Ameri-
cans, and overcoming the crisis re-
quires input from all their representa-
tives. However, the Speaker and Demo-
cratic Party are clearly not focused on 
confronting 
the 
pandemic. 
Instead, 
they are exploiting the crisis to accom-
plish political goals rather than pro-
tect the American people. 
In this bill, Democrats include nearly 
a trillion dollars to bail out blue States 
and cities for years of irresponsible 
spending. It prevents States from re-
quiring voter ID’s and requires same- 
day voter registration. And nowhere in 
this 1,800-page bill do they find room 
for basic pro-life protections included 
in appropriations bills since Roe v. 
Wade. This is all on top of potentially 
freeing murderers and rapists. 
This bill steals money from the many 
to further the priorities of the few and 
then seeks to change election laws so 
they can do it all over again. 
For these reasons, I vehemently op-
pose the bill. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CISNEROS). 
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the HEROES Act. The may-
ors and local leaders in California’s 
39th and across America are asking for 
Congress to help their cities and towns. 
The HEROES Act will do that by pro-
viding $870 billion in direct funding to 
States, cities, and counties, and it will 
give them the flexibility to use the 
funding where it can do the most good. 
This is what our leaders in the 39th 
are asking for, because it will allow 
them to maintain crucial programs and 
adequately fund public safety in order 
to protect our citizens. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. KEVIN HERN), my very good 
friend and colleague from my State and 
member of the Budget Committee, Nat-
ural Resources Committee, and Small 
Business Committee. 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Oklahoma for doing a great job today. 
Mr. Speaker, when I look at the so- 
called HEROES Act, I don’t see legisla-
tion honoring heroes. I see an 1,800- 
page bill that takes 40 hours to read, 
written with zero bipartisan input. I 
see socialist fantasies from previously 
rejected bills. I see a mortgage on our 
children’s future, financed by China, 
the very foreign adversary responsible 
for the crisis in the first place. 
This bill was formed outside the col-
laborative nature of the House of Rep-
resentatives. It was proposed without 
going 
through 
committee 
or 
the 
amendment process, and no one, in-
cluding the Democrats, knows what is 
in it. 
Passing a $3 trillion spending bill 
written behind closed doors in the 
Speaker’s office sets a dangerous prece-
dent that will have generational con-
sequences. This is nothing more than a 
publicity stunt. This bill shows no bi-
partisan strategy for economic recov-
ery. We should keep the House in ses-
sion until we craft real bipartisan leg-
islation that gets our country back up 
and running. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. CLARKE), the vice chair of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
HEROES Act. 
As reported in Newsweek on Tuesday, 
my beloved Brooklyn has the distinc-
tion of having more deaths due to 
COVID–19 than any county in the 
United States, with a death toll ex-
ceeding 46 entire States. Over 4,000 
souls have departed due to the dreadful 
virus. 
The HEROES Act provides crucial re-
lief and support for our heroes fighting 
COVID–19 on the front lines, who ex-
tended to us a lifeline at great risk to 
their own lives. 
While this legislation does not in-
clude the Paycheck Guarantee Act, I 
believe that we must pass this bill. 
This is not the time for red or blue one- 
upmanship. COVID knows no political 
labels. I ask my colleagues to vote for 
the HEROES Act. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I have addi-
tional speakers on the way, but they 
are not here. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, let me tell 
you something that is in this bill: 
There is a repeal of about a $100 billion 
tax break for the richest people in this 
country that Trump and McConnell 
snuck in CARES 1. We didn’t see it at 
first. We found it. 
We put out a letter asking for sup-
port. Do we get one Republican to say 
yes, I want to join you and get rid of 
that $100 billion tax break for 80 per-
cent of the people who make $1 million 
a year or more and had nothing to do 
with coronavirus? Not one of you. You 
ought to be for that. That is thievery. 
That is robbery. Jesse James wouldn’t 
need a mask if he came here. Trump 
and McConnell didn’t have on a mask 
when they stole from the American 
people $100 billion for millionaires and 
billionaires. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I just advise 
my friend, if he is worried about tax 
breaks for billionaires and million-
aires, he might want to get rid of 
SALT deductions in this current bill. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. CARTER), my very good friend and 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and the only pharmacist in 
Congress. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition to the HE-
ROES Act. 
This legislation ignores the funda-
mental issues affecting our country. It 
is a harmful misallocation of congres-
sional efforts and ignores the plight of 
the American people. 
For instance, this package references 
cannabis more times than it does jobs. 
It includes hundreds of billions to bail 
out States, which may be needed, but 
it is not even ensuring that there are 
guardrails to prevent reckless behavior 
and waste. 
It extends increased unemployment 
benefits well past the targeted reopen-
ing of the country, forcing businesses 
to compete with a government program 
for employees. 
This package would allow illegal im-
migrants access to direct payments, 
and it would move to federalize elec-
tions. These are just a handful of exam-
ples of the misguided and dangerous

policies included in this legislation. We 
have allocated trillions of dollars in 
aid, and significant amounts of that 
still hasn’t gone out the door. 
Now is the time to discuss solutions 
for the problems facing the American 
people, not a partisan wish list. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, now is the time for us to discuss so-
lutions for the problems facing the 
American people, not to put out par-
tisan wish lists. I urge my colleagues 
to oppose this. 
b 1645 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, their 
priority is corporate liability. Ours is 
helping to save a nation. 
They say wait. Wait for what? The 
virus to stop spreading? It won’t. Wait 
for another 36 million Americans to 
have to file for unemployment? Wait 
for another million businesses to col-
lapse? For another 86,000 Americans to 
die? 
The time to act is now if we are 
going to save this economy and protect 
public health and safety, not to dither, 
not to wait. The virus won’t. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I would advise my very good friend 
from the great State of Virginia that 
we didn’t wait. We worked with you 
and passed four bills. You are wasting 
time. You are wasting time. You have 
brought a bill here you know will not 
pass the Senate, that the President 
will not sign. You decided not to work 
with us. So please don’t accuse us of 
delay. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Idaho (Mr. FULCHER), a 
member of the Education and Labor 
and Natural Resources Committees. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, the 
United States of America has gen-
erated more prosperity than every 
other nation in history combined. That 
is because our divinely inspired system 
of government prioritizes individual 
rights through a republic that has rep-
resentation, employs market principles 
and property rights, and backs it up 
with rule of law. 
The sponsors of today’s legislation 
are using a pandemic as an excuse to 
propose spending $3 trillion on policies 
that reverse or undermine all three. 
Now, we all know it is not going to be-
come law. Instead, it is part of a strat-
egy to set the initial negotiation bar so 
outrageously to the left that the end 
negotiated result would transform our 
Republic to a socialist remotely gov-
erned Republic. 
When I disagree with legislation con-
tent, I often consider compromise. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, when I 
disagree with the legislative content, I 
often consider compromise. But in this 
case, there is only one reasonable re-
sponse, and that is a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. COX). 
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, 
the working families of Central Valley, 
and the 86,000 Americans who have 
died, don’t have the luxury of waiting 
for the White House, Leader MCCON-
NELL, or my friends on the other side of 
the aisle to sit around and let more 
Americans die or go bankrupt. 
The fact is, Democrats are showing 
leadership in a plan that puts Main 
Street before Wall Street and takes 
care of the families who did nothing to 
cause this crisis but are paying with 
their lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill so we can recharge our 
efforts to test, track, and treat, which 
is the only way to reopen our Nation 
safely. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. PALMER), chairman of the 
Republican Policy Committee. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I oppose 
this bill because it constitutes a threat 
to our national security. 
On March 26, the Federal Reserve 
Bank of St. Louis reported that our 
debt-to-GDP was already at 106.8 per-
cent. Since that time, Congress added 
over $2 trillion. 
If this $3 trillion left-wing dream- 
come-true bill were to become law, it 
would likely move our debt-to-GDP at 
close to 120 percent by the end of this 
fiscal year. Debt levels of this mag-
nitude are not sustainable. Debt levels 
of this magnitude will be a threat to 
Social Security and Medicare. Debt 
levels of this magnitude will reduce 
household income. And debt levels of 
this magnitude threaten our national 
security. 
Once upon a time, there was bipar-
tisan agreement about this. Former 
Secretaries of Defense across multiple 
administrations all warned that our 
debt will compromise our national se-
curity capabilities. It is foolhardy to 
ignore these warnings that the single 
biggest threat to our national security 
is our national debt. 
America has enemies, and despite all 
the allusions of some, China is fore-
most among them. If this bill were to 
become law, it would undermine our 
ability to maintain our military supe-
riority over China. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, if this 
bill were to become law, it would un-
dermine our ability to maintain our 
military superiority over China. 
In that regard, if Xi Jinping had a 
vote in this Chamber, he would be an 
enthusiastic ‘‘yes.’’ Thank God he does 
not. But we do. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this bill. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, if we don’t 
act boldly, we will spend the next dec-
ade recovering from this crisis, and 
many families and many communities 
may never recover. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are right about one thing: 
This is our vision for America, an 
America where people can pay their 
rent and mortgage and buy food for 
their children; where businesses will 
reopen and create jobs; where our cities 
can pay our firefighters, our para-
medics, and our teachers next month; 
and where people can vote without 
risking their health and their lives. 
America is great because, in times of 
crisis, we come together to meet the 
challenge. We do big things. Let us 
meet this moment. Let’s pass this bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. THOMPSON), my very good 
friend, a member of the Agriculture 
and Education and Labor Committees. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition 
to this legislation. 
Through the CARES Act and the pre-
vious relief packages Congress has al-
ready approved, the Federal Govern-
ment has acted swiftly to address our 
most pressing needs as a result of the 
coronavirus. Our efforts thus far have 
been about three things: saving lives, 
saving jobs, and saving our economy. 
These bills were negotiated in good 
faith and passed with overwhelming bi-
partisan support to provide immediate 
resources and a lifeline to families, 
workers, businesses, and States. 
Mr. Speaker, legislation on the House 
floor today is not in the same bipar-
tisan spirit of addressing the urgent 
needs 
of 
Americans 
during 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. It is written 
without input from the minority and 
prioritizes divisive partisan policies 
over real relief for Americans. 
One division I am concerned about is 
agriculture. Instead of simply sup-
porting farmers, ranchers, and the ef-
fectiveness of our feeding programs, 
which is where our focus should be, the 
bill ties the hands of the USDA. These 
partisan policies have no place in a re-
lief package, and this legislation is 
dead on arrival in the Senate. 
As we begin to open up our economy, 
Congress must continue combating the 
virus and getting Americans back to 
work. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, we also could be doing 
more for working individuals by in-
cluding my legislation, the AG CHAIN 
Act, which would suspend Federal in-
come tax and payroll taxes for essen-
tial workers during this pandemic. 
However, 
today’s 
legislation 
was 
drafted and introduced with unneces-
sary haste and lacks bipartisan support

to become law. I am voting ‘‘no’’ on 
this bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the HEROES Act because it rec-
ognizes the human sacrifice of our fam-
ilies, our teachers, our postal workers, 
our police. It recognizes the human suf-
fering. 
In my own counties of Berks County, 
207 are dead, and in Montgomery Coun-
try, 608 are dead. Included in that num-
ber is my own mother-in-law, dead of 
COVID earlier this month in a local 
nursing home without the ability of 
her family to be at her side. 
And it recognizes the heroes all 
around us, like the staff at that nurs-
ing home who stood by and took care 
of Joan in a loving way. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. DEAN. I will be voting ‘‘yes’’ on 
this bill to send nearly $40 billion to 
my hard-hit State of Pennsylvania. I 
urge all of our colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I have addi-
tional speakers on the way. They have 
not yet arrived, so I am going to re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
DELBENE). 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, the HE-
ROES Act will help workers stay con-
nected to their employers, their pay-
checks, and their benefits. 
This bill includes an expanded em-
ployee retention tax credit. By build-
ing on this existing and bipartisan pro-
gram, we help businesses keep their 
employees on the payroll through the 
end of the year and reduce unemploy-
ment. 
The bill also expands the child tax 
credit to help families and reduce child 
poverty. These policies, along with sup-
port for essential public services, ex-
panded testing, and contact tracing, 
are the reasons why I will be voting 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, we, in 
Michigan, have been devastated by this 
virus. We were third for the number of 
cases in the country for weeks and, 
until this week, remained third in the 
number of deaths. 
Two million people are unemployed, 
and lives have been forever changed. 
The Chair of the Fed said this week 
that if we don’t want this economy to 
be ruined, we need to invest now, and 
that is what this bill does. It is not per-
fect, but the people of my district need 
help and they need it now. 
There are pension provisions in here 
that are not perfect, that help some 
and not others, but I urge my col-
leagues to vote for this bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. HICE), a member of the Natural 
Resources and Oversight and Reform 
Committees. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
the Federal Government has a respon-
sibility to help both individuals and 
businesses through this crisis because, 
as the government, they shut down the 
economy. But I do have deep concerns 
with the way in which we are attempt-
ing to go about this. 
We have already spent an unprece-
dented amount of money, $3.6 trillion, 
at an unprecedented rate. Now, we 
have a monstrosity, and we have yet to 
have a serious discussion as to how we 
are going to pay for this massive debt. 
In this bill—$3 trillion, 1,800 pages, 
zero input from the minority, from the 
Senate or the White House, drafted be-
hind closed doors, and just very little 
time to review it. 
As ranking member of the Govern-
ment Operations Subcommittee, I want 
to focus on the Postal Service. The 
Postal Service does not need a bailout; 
they need reform. It needs reform. 
We have 12 consecutive years of los-
ing money in the Postal Service, and it 
was not caused by this pandemic. It is 
a deeper pandemic within the Postal 
Service. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
this is an issue that we have to resolve, 
not with just a bailout of $25 billion. 
They have $9 billion sitting in the bank 
over there. 
This is our time to be responsible 
with the people’s money, and I urge my 
colleagues not to support this bill? 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of heroes. 
$15 billion for transit agencies, in-
cluding $3.8 billion for the MTA, that is 
a good thing. 
$2 billion for deep cleaning for public 
housing, such as NYCHA, that is a good 
thing. 
Another round of stimulus checks, 
$1,200, plus another $1,200 for children, 
and the inclusion of taxpaying immi-
grants and their families, that is a 
good thing. 
$10 billion for additional grants for 
small business, that is a good thing. 
$7 billion for childcare, that is a good 
thing. 
$2 billion to help employers provide 
hazard pay to essential workers, like 
hospital workers, transit workers, su-
permarket workers, and critical prop-
erty service workers like janitors, se-
curity officers, residential door per-
sons, and others who are often over-
looked but are so crucial to keeping 
key buildings and facilities like the 
hundreds in my district up and run-
ning, that is a good thing. 
$100 billion for emergency rental as-
sistance, that is an extremely good 
thing. Help for New York State and 
New York City. 
I rise in support of our heroes. This is 
a good thing. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, unfortu-
nately, our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle don’t hear the suffering 
happening in our communities, com-
munities like El Paso, vulnerable com-
munities that need more testing, more 
tracing. 
This bill does that. It provides that 
necessary step to safely reopening our 
economies. It also provides $1 billion 
for my community of El Paso, Texas, 
$35 billion for the State of Texas. For 
this and many other reasons, we need 
to look at this as one step in a long 
journey, a painful journey, but one 
that we are in together. 
b 1700 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I just remind my friends we actually 
do hear. That is why we worked with 
you to pass four straight bills. I would 
be willing to work with you again. You 
chose not to do that. You chose to 
bring to the floor a bill you know will 
not be taken up by the Senate, will not 
be signed by the President. So let’s 
abandon that course and go back to 
where we were at. We worked together. 
We got a lot done in a short period of 
time. I think that is what the Amer-
ican people want us to do. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, whenever 
my friend is ready to sit down, I am 
happy to work with him. 
I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of this legislation. 
Much talk, some facts. In California, 
$54 billion deficit by the State govern-
ment. The counties I represent are 
reeling in their deficit. We need this 
bill; otherwise, we are going to see hos-
pitals, we are going to see first re-
sponders, police, and firemen laid off. 
Many say this bill is dead on arrival. 
If we do not move this bill, the death 
will be in our districts. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of 
respect for my very good friend from 
California, but we live in a system 
right now of divided government. We 
have a Democratic House that cer-
tainly has a voice in anything that is 
done. We have a Republican Senate, 
and we have a Republican President. 
We have proven that we can work to-
gether. We did for four straight bills, 
extraordinary amount of time, largest

single bill in American history. So it is 
not as if the two sides don’t know how 
to do this. 
For whatever reasons, my friends 
chose to decide to move alone. Well, 
they can certainly do that through this 
Chamber, and that is their right to do. 
I respect that if that is what they want 
to do. But if they think moving alone 
without Republicans will get them 
anywhere in the United States Senate 
or at the other end of Pennsylvania Av-
enue, I would just suggest that is prob-
ably not the case. 
So again, we know how to do this. We 
have proven we can do it; an extraor-
dinary job by all concerned on both 
sides of the House to get those four 
bills done. 
Nobody works better, by the way, in 
a bipartisan sense than my good friend, 
the chairwoman of the Appropriations 
Committee, and nobody works with her 
better than my good friend, the rank-
ing member of the Appropriations 
Committee. I would suggest the rest of 
us probably should clear out for a while 
and let those two work together. I bet 
you we could actually get a bill to 
pass. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
the richest country in the world is fac-
ing a looming humanitarian crisis. 
Hunger looms large in the land, Mr. 
Speaker. This bill provides a $14 billion 
solution with a humanitarian response 
to feed the hungry. 
Homelessness looms large. Evictions 
are afoot. This bill provides $100 billion 
to keep people in their homes. 
This humanitarian crisis necessitates 
a humanitarian response. This bill pro-
vides that response. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND). 
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support the HEROES Act. 
The administration’s failed response 
to this crisis causes heartbreak, finan-
cial stress, and lays bare the dispari-
ties in our country. 
Two Dine sisters didn’t get treat-
ment in time and died. Their sons will 
live without their mothers. 
A single mom in my district lost her 
job and couldn’t get help because of her 
status. 
The HEROES Act meets this chal-
lenge at the level it demands. When I 
vote today, I will think of all the fami-
lies and all of the essential workers, 
the people who stock our groceries and 
keep us fed. 
Mr. Speaker, we must pass this bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY), a distinguished 
veteran in service to this country. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you this bill, 
among other things—we can talk about 
all the wish list of things that are in it, 
and I am sure many have and many 
will. I want to talk about the trillion 
dollars of additional spending to the 
States and talk about my State of 
Pennsylvania, where we spent and sent 
billions of dollars where, right now, the 
Governor 
is 
holding 
hostage 
that 
money that is supposed to go directly 
to the counties. He won’t give it to the 
counties that are going bankrupt right 
now. 
What he is doing, Mr. Speaker, is 
making sure that our nursing home pa-
tients get exposed to COVID–19. It is a 
directive in Pennsylvania, if they have 
COVID–19 and the hospital releases 
them, they have to go back to the 
nursing home. So our nursing homes 
are 74 percent of the deaths across the 
State. Seventy-four percent of the 
deaths in Pennsylvania are because of 
the Governor’s policy. 
Meanwhile, he says he doesn’t have 
enough money. We are going to spend 
more money in Pennsylvania when the 
money hasn’t already been spent. 
Oh, by the way, the unemployment 
compensation money that we sent to 
Pennsylvania, it takes 41 days right 
now to have your claim answered. Peo-
ple cannot exist on policies and prom-
ises. They need money. 
Mr. Speaker, spending more money, 
sending more money to buttress failed 
policies doesn’t fix the policies. They 
don’t fix anything. They don’t help 
anyone. 
Let’s fix the policies. Let’s make sure 
the people get the money that we have 
sent to them instead of just sending 
more to the Governor, who is going to 
extort the counties and kill our elder-
ly. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE), a senior 
member of the Homeland Security and 
Judiciary Committees. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
We heard on this floor, Mr. Speaker, 
God bless America, and now we know 
that America is sick and needs that 
blessing. Her lives, her livelihood are 
sick. 
This is not Speaker PELOSI’s bill. 
This is America’s bill. And I am glad to 
stand here and support heroes who will 
get $200 billion, including transit work-
ers. 
I am glad we will get more direct 
payments, $6,000, to families that are 
desperate. 
I am glad that there will be testing 
and contact tracing that will help save 
lives. 
I am glad that local governments— 
my mayor is suffering—$375 billion. 
And I am delighted to make sure that 
we know that the hungry people in the 
streets will get food. 
I support the HEROES legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, and founder and Co-Chair of 
the Congressional Coronavirus Taskforce, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 6800, the Health 
and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency 
Solutions Act, or HEROES Act, the most in-
stallment of the necessary assistance and re-
lief provided by Congress to address the ad-
verse health and economic impacts of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
The HEROES Act provides an additional 
$75 billion for the testing, tracing, and treat-
ment we need in order to have a science- 
based path to safely reopen our country and 
helping ensure that every American can ac-
cess free coronavirus treatment. 
I support this legislation also because it pro-
vides strong support for our heroes fighting 
the pandemic on the front lines with nearly $1 
trillion for state, local, territorial and tribal gov-
ernments who desperately need funds to pay 
the health care workers, police, fire, transpor-
tation, EMS, teachers and other vital workers 
who keep us safe and are in danger of losing 
their jobs. 
The Heroes Act also establishes a $200 bil-
lion Heroes’ fund to ensure that essential 
workers receive hazard pay, something that I 
have long advocated and for which I worked 
closely with the House and committee leaders 
to secure. 
Another reason to support this bill is that it 
puts money in the pockets of workers with a 
second round of direct payments to families 
up to $6,000 per household, new payroll pro-
tection measures to keep 60 million workers 
connected with their jobs and extending week-
ly $600 federal unemployment payments 
through January 2021. 
There are several additional salutary provi-
sions in this legislation which I will later ad-
dress, but it is important to note for the record 
the scale of public health and economic crisis 
we are in. 
Every day, we see the need for further ac-
tion to combat the coronavirus crisis. 
To date, there are more than 1,400,000 
confirmed cases, over 85,000 dead, including 
42,403 cases and 1,158 deaths in my home 
state of Texas. 
On top of that, by taking the necessary 
measures to slow the pandemic and ‘flatten 
the curve’ so as not to overwhelm the nation’s 
health care system, economic activity in the 
United States has experienced a severe shock 
to the system. 
More than 36 million initial unemployment 
claims in the past month alone. 
In addition, on March 23, 2020, the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dipped to 
18,321.62, which is even lower than it was on 
Election Night 2016, and far below the 19,827 
mark where it stood on January 20, 2017. 
In other words, Mr. Speaker, all the gains 
that were made to the stock market and her-
alded by this Administration as evidence of its 
genius have been wiped out, depleting the re-
tirement savings and 401(k) fund of millions of 
ordinary Americans. 
The situation is so dire that Federal Reserve 
Chair Jerome Powell, appointed by the current 
President, stressed the importance of Con-
gress providing further fiscal relief, stating this 
week: 
‘‘While the economic response has been 
both timely and appropriately large, it may not 
be the final chapter, given that the path ahead 
is both highly uncertain and subject to signifi-
cant downside risks. Additional fiscal support 
could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid

long-term economic damage and leaves us 
with a stronger recovery.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, among people who were work-
ing in February, almost 40 percent of those in 
households making less than $40,000 a year 
had lost their job in March. 
And in addition to the highly inequitable of 
gender and racial impacts, this economic 
downturn reveals a strong class dimension to 
the unemployment wave with 18.1 million of 
the 19.5 million jobs lost in the private sector 
last month classified as production and non- 
supervisory workers as opposed to managers. 
So, we have simultaneously a public health 
emergency and an economic calamity, both of 
which are addressed in the legislation before 
us. 
But before we can get back on our feet eco-
nomically and restore the booming economy 
inherited by the current Administration, Ameri-
cans must be assured and confident that there 
is a plan and strategy to combat COVID–19 
and the resources and commitment needed to 
implement the plan and execute the strategy. 
And that means testing, testing, and more 
testing, along with contact tracing. 
Mr. Speaker, as the media was reporting in 
early January on the rapid spread of the novel 
coronavirus and the alarming increase in the 
numbers of persons infected, I understood that 
this was an emergency situation requiring ur-
gent and immediate attention. 
On February 10, 2020, I held the first press 
conference 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
novel 
coronavirus at Houston Intercontinental Air-
port, which was followed by a second press 
conference on February 24, 2020 to continue 
efforts to raise public knowledge of the im-
pending threat. 
On February 26, 2020, I wrote the Chair 
and Ranking Member of the Committee on 
Homeland Security requesting to be briefed by 
Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad 
Wolf to regarding the preparedness of DHS to 
address a possible pandemic. 
On March 19, 2020, I partnered with United 
Memorial Medical Center to open the first 
drive through Coronavirus Test Screening fa-
cility in the Houston area. 
Since March 19, I have worked to open six 
other testing sites for a total of seven that are 
located within high risk communities in the city 
of Houston to reduce the need for travel to get 
access to COVID–19 testing. 
In early March news reports regarding the 
high risks for COVID–19 infections in jails and 
prisons provided early notice that these loca-
tions might become hot spots where the un-
checked spread of the virus would pose health 
risks to detainees, staff, and communities 
where they were located. 
Infectious disease experts warned that over-
crowded unsanitary conditions existed in these 
facilities making them extremely unsafe given 
what was known about the highly infectious 
nature of COVID–19. 
That is why I worked with the Harris County 
Sheriff’s Office to provide COVID–19 testing 
for detainees and staff beginning on April 21. 
Detention centers are overcrowded and un-
sanitary and pose significant risks to detainees 
and staff should COVID–19 breach them, 
whether they are prisons, jails, or ICE deten-
tion centers. 
In the weeks before the White House de-
clared 
a 
national 
emergency 
concerning 
COVID–19, ICE held approximately 38,000 in-
dividuals in more than 130 federal, private, 
and locally operated detention facilities across 
the country. 
Crowded, unsanitary conditions in ICE de-
tention facilities put detainees, detention facil-
ity staff, and surrounding communities in dan-
ger. 
Placing detainees in local jails or state pris-
ons may have triggered infections in those 
confinement settings that might reach local 
communities where the infections would not 
be detected until infected persons were sick 
enough to seek medical assistance at hos-
pitals. 
Individuals in detention are often housed in 
close quarters together with individuals in poor 
health, making them highly vulnerable to con-
tagious disease. 
Reducing the number of persons being held 
by focusing on release of non-violent persons 
who are at the greatest risk should they con-
tract the infection-the elderly, those with un-
derlying medical conditions, and those with 
compromised immune systems is the right 
thing to do for public safety and health. 
As I wrote in a May 6, 2020 Houston Chron-
icle op-ed, entitled Universal Testing Is A Na-
tional Security Issue, universal testing, contact 
tracing, and social distancing is needed to pro-
tect the public health and safety, and to pro-
vide Americans with the confidence they need 
to restart the national economy by resuming 
economic activity. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that H.R. 
6800 includes in its provisions many of the 
policies I have advocated and worked with 
leadership to secure, including the following: 
Bureau of Prisons—$200 million to prevent, 
prepare for, and respond to coronavirus in

supportive services for seniors and disabled 
individuals, and their caregivers. 
Department of Education—$100.15 billion to 
support the educational needs of States, 
school districts, and institutions of higher edu-
cation in response to coronavirus, including: 
1. $90 billion for a State Fiscal Stabilization 
Fund for grants to States to support statewide 
and local funding for elementary and sec-
ondary schools and public postsecondary insti-
tutions. 
2. $10.15 billion to help alleviate burdens 
associated with the coronavirus for both col-
leges and students, including $1.7 billion for 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
and Minority Serving Institutions, $20 million 
for Howard University, $11 million for Gal-
laudet University, $11 million for the National 
Technical Institute for the Deaf, and $8.4 bil-
lion for other institutions of higher education. 
Tenant-Based Rental Assistance—$4 billion 
to allow public housing agencies (PHAs) to re-
spond to coronavirus and the ability to keep 
over 2.2 million families stably housed even 
when facing a loss of income, including $1 bil-
lion for new, temporary, vouchers for individ-
uals and families who are homeless or at risk 
of becoming homeless, or fleeing domestic vi-
olence. 
Public Housing Operating- Fund—$2 billion 
for PHAs to carry out coronavirus response for 
the operation and management of almost 1 
million public housing units. 
Housing for Persons with AIDS—$15 million 
to maintain operations, rental assistance, sup-
portive services, and other necessary actions 
to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on low- 
income persons with HIV/AIDS. 
Homeless Assistance Grants—$11.5 billion 
for Emergency Solutions Grants to address 
the impact of coronavirus among individuals 
and families who are homeless or at risk of 
homelessness and to support additional home-
less assistance, prevention, and diver on ac-
tivities to mitigate the impacts of the pan-
demic. I am also pleased that the language of 
my bill, H.R. 6803, to specifically help the El-
derly and persons with disabilities during 
COVID–19 through wrap a round services was 
included. 
Emergency Rental Assistance—$100 billion 
to provide emergency assistance to help low- 
income renters at risk of homelessness avoid 
eviction due to the economic impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Project-Based Rental Assistance—$750 mil-
lion to ensure the continuation of housing as-
sistance for low-income individuals and fami-
lies living in project-based rental assistance 
properties, and to ensure housing providers 
can take the necessary actions to prevent, 
prepare for, and respond to the pandemic. 
Housing for the Elderly—$500 million to 
maintain operations at properties providing af-
fordable housing for low-income seniors and 
to ensure housing providers can take the nec-
essary actions to prevent, prepare for, and re-
spond to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Housing for Persons with Disabilities—$200 
million to maintain operations at properties 
providing affordable housing for low-income 
persons with disabilities, and to ensure hous-
ing providers can take the necessary actions 
to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Housing Counseling Assistance—$100 mil-
lion to enable housing counselors to respond 
to the surge of demand for services, which in-
clude foreclosure and eviction mitigation coun-
seling, in light of the economic impact of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. The bill allows the pur-
chase of technology and equipment so serv-
ices can be provided through electronic 
means. 
As the economic impact of the coronavirus 
pandemic becomes clearer and more far- 
reaching, it will be necessary to continually re-
plenish the Paycheck Protection Program 
(PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan pro-
gram (EIDL). 
Mr. Speaker, perhaps the principle reason 
to support this legislation is because it pro-
vides $75 billion for COVID–19 testing, contact 
tracing, and isolation measures; and ensures 
that 
every 
American 
can 
access 
free 
coronavirus treatment. 
The legislation also provides hospitals and 
health care workers on the frontlines needed 
funding for the necessary resources, espe-
cially personal protective equipment (PPE), to 
battle the coronavirus pandemic and care for 
its victims. 
Mr. Speaker, we have all seen the heart- 
wrenching stories of courageous doctors, 
nurses, ambulance drivers, orderlies, and oth-
ers selflessly striving to save other others 
while putting themselves in harm’s way be-
cause of the severe shortage of PPE. 
Mr. Speaker, the current president fancies 
calling himself a ‘‘War President.’’ 
For anyone who needs reminding, the na-
tion’s greatest wartime presidents made sure 
that American troops on the frontlines were 
trained, equipped, and protected in battle. 
The funding provided in this legislation will 
help states and local jurisdiction conduct nec-
essary COVID–19 testing in local jails, juvenile 
detention centers, and elsewhere in the crimi-
nal justice system. 
Testing is the key to reopening the economy 
and resuming our lives, and to prevent, pre-
pare for, and respond to coronavirus, domesti-
cally or internationally. 
If we cannot see where COVID–19 is within 
a community, there is no reliable way to pre-
vent its spread other than quarantine. 
If we do not dramatically increase testing, 
we will remain prisoners of COVID–19 until we 
have a vaccine widely available, which is not 
expected to occur until early 2021. 
Universal testing for COVID–19 is a matter 
of life and death for millions of Americans, but 
it is also a salvation for millions of others who 
are living desperate lives behind locked doors.

The liberation of millions hinges on getting 
testing in every community so that we can 
shine a light on where COVID–19 is and 
where it is not present. 
Mr. Speaker, the occasion demands that we 
rise, and I urge all Members to join me in vot-
ing to pass H.R. 6800, the Health and Eco-
nomic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solu-
tions Act. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI). 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing. 
I rise in support of the HEROES Act. 
Why? 
Because our firefighters and first re-
sponders are heroes. They deserve to 
remain employed. 
Because our frontline and healthcare 
workers are heroes. They deserve to 
have more testing and PPE. 
Our small business people are heroes, 
too, and they deserve relief, also. 
Heroic people need our action today. 
Inaction would not be heroic. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS). 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today at an unprecedented time. 
First, I want to thank those frontline 
and essential workers, those who are 
working each and every day on the re-
tail lines, certainly those who are 
working to keep our lights on. 
But this HEROES Act will provide 
New Jersey the much-needed help it de-
serves and needs, second in the Nation. 
Almost 10,000 people have been im-
pacted in a way that they will never 
forget. 
But we know for workers this will 
take care of OSHA so they have a safe 
workplace; for families so they have 
food and SNAP benefits increase; for 
small businesses, emergency grants. 
But most importantly, we, together, 
as a country, will get past this if we 
work together. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR), my great friend and 
distinguished member of the Financial 
Services Committee. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
For 21⁄2 years, Americans have heard 
Democrats in this House criticize the 
historic tax cuts for exploding the 
debt. They have listened to Democrats 
repeat that criticism even as indi-
vidual income tax revenues actually 
rose by $22 billion over CBO projec-
tions. 
But today, Speaker PELOSI proposes a 
bill that is so reckless, so outrageous, 
and so fiscally irresponsible that it will 
add $3 trillion to our national debt 
overnight. And instead of hearing 
about the deficit or even concerns 
about this pandemic, struggling Ameri-
cans are watching House Democrats 
push for legislation to legalize voter 
fraud, give stimulus checks to illegal 
immigrants, 
bail 
out 
mismanaged 
State and local governments, and re-
store tax breaks to blue State million-
aires and billionaires. 
So, to taxpayers across America, if 
you have ever had any doubt about 
where Democrats in this House actu-
ally stand on deficits and the debt, 
watch today’s vote. 
Instead of surrendering our country 
to socialism, we need to reopen our 
economy and allow Americans to safely 
get back to work. The government can-
not sustainably respond to this crisis 
or any crisis unless and until we have 
taxpayers who are actually working. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
H.R. 6800 is anything but a wish list 
for Democrats. Instead, the HEROES 
Act means everything to the people in 
all of our congressional districts. 
States and cities across our country 
are losing revenue that will lead to a 
loss of services and our safety. The 
funding in this bill shores up those 
services and our security, especially for 
our small cities. 
The PPP benefits small businesses, 
but it needs to be expanded and easier 
to understand. This bill provides those 
improvements, as well as more testing 
and tracing, help for renters and own-
ers, broadband for kids, purchases for 
farmers, and protections for farm-
workers. 
So when you call this a wish list, 
know that it is our constituents who 
are wishing for funding so that they 
can fight and defeat this pandemic. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
There is nobody I respect more than 
my good friend from California. He is a 
bipartisan person by nature and in-
stinct. All I would advise him is to re-
sume what they did that worked be-
fore: Go back to operating in a bipar-
tisan manner, sit down and negotiate, 
and we will actually get something 
done for the American people. 
What they are doing now is partisan, 
one-sided, no Republican input, dead on 
arrival in the Senate, not going to be 
signed by the President. That is not a 
productive use of time. It may be a po-
litical choice; it may be smart poli-
tics—I don’t know, I don’t think so, but 
maybe—but it certainly is not going to 
result in legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PORTER). 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
cans are suffering enough from this 
pandemic. They deserve the best policy 
to help them. Even if infection rates go 
down in May and June, unemployment 
will keep going up. 
The Paycheck Recovery Act would 
protect our capitalist economy, which 
the virus is attacking. It would pre-
serve businesses and give workers what 
they need most: their paychecks so 
they can provide for their families. 
The HEROES Act should have used 
this approach, but I know our States 
and local governments and our front-
line workers cannot wait for Federal 
help. I, therefore, support this bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PAYNE). 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support the HEROES Act, our 
fifth coronavirus aid package. 
Right now, Americans are losing 
loved ones, jobs, their health insur-
ance, and their patience. The only aid 
that they will get is whatever we pro-
vide them. 
Government exists to help the coun-
try in times of great need, and there 
might not ever be a greater time in our 
lifetime than right now. I am shocked 
that many of my Republican colleagues 
seem not to care. 
The price might be high, but the 
price of doing nothing is always higher. 
Our constituents count on us to do the 
right thing. This bill is the right thing 
for American workers, American fami-
lies, and American businesses. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
b 1715 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, from 
Eagle County to Gilpin County and 
every community in between, our com-
munities are looking to us to help 
them weather this crisis. 
These aren’t red counties; they are 
not blue counties. They are American 
counties. 
This bill is about helping all of Amer-
ica, and in particular, the American 
heroes who are standing up for us every 
day, the firefighters, the nurses, the 
first responders, the teachers, and so 
many more. 
They continue to stand up for us. 
Let’s stand up for them. 
Please, let’s pass this bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ENGEL), the chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, New York 
has been ravaged by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. My constituents in New Ro-
chelle, New York, were in the original 
New York hotspot and have suffered 
greatly, both health-wise and economi-
cally. 
I have worked tirelessly since the 
last CARES Act to help my constitu-
ents and bring as many resources as I 
can back to the Bronx and West-
chester. This includes about $5 billion 
for hard-hit New York hospitals and $76 
million for New York’s community 
health centers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2240 
May 15, 2020 
With today’s vote, the House makes 
clear its commitment to continue help-
ing the heroes of this pandemic and our 
State even further. 
The HEROES Act finally makes 
whole our State and local governments 
with nearly $34 billion in funding for 
New York and an additional $32 billion 
for local assistance. 
It provides billions in hazard pay for 
the brave frontline workers who have 
kept us going through this crisis, and 
also allocates billions more for the 
three T’s, testing, tracing, and treat-
ment, keys to reviving our economy. 
The bill also includes provisions I 
specifically requested and authored, in-
cluding an additional $5 billion in edu-
cation funding for New York to help 
prevent layoffs and program cuts, pro-
visions to protect the medical supply 
chain, and increased Medicaid pay-
ments for safety-net New York hos-
pitals. 
What is more, New York will benefit 
greatly from the provision in this bill 
which repeals SALT, the caps on State 
and local taxes deductions, something 
we have fought hard for since the GOP 
tax scam passed 3 years ago. 
In addition to the already mentioned 
provisions, there is an additional $175 
billion in housing aid, including the 
$100 billion in rental assistance that I 
and other New Yorkers called for; ex-
tended unemployment benefits through 
January 2021; more direct stimulus 
payments to Americans; and billions in 
funding for hospitals and the Postal 
Service. 
There are pension provisions in this 
bill which are controversial to some 
groups, and I am hopeful this can be re-
solved in conference. 
I was pleased to see property service 
workers included under the Pandemic 
Premium Pay for the Essential Work-
ers section. These workers, like jani-
tors, security officers, residential door 
persons, and others, are often over-
looked, but are crucial in keeping 
buildings and facilities up and running. 
Please vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. SA´ NCHEZ). 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the HEROES Act. 
COVID–19 has ravaged communities, 
businesses, and families. We will be 
reeling from the economic aftershocks 
of the coronavirus for many months to 
come. 
The HEROES Act will provide des-
perately needed relief to stabilize our 
fragile economy and protect essential 
workers. 
It will put us on the right path to 
economic recovery, a recovery that re-
duces food insecurity, compensates es-
sential workers for risking their lives 
to do their jobs, and help to prevent 
counties and municipalities from hav-
ing to lay off the workers that we rely 
on the most. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the HEROES Act. Let’s support our he-
roes. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Ala-
bama (Ms. SEWELL), the vice chair of 
the Committee on Ways and Means. 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to support our HEROES 
Act. 
This bill will provide $375 billion in 
support directly to local governments, 
which would mean millions of dollars 
for my counties and my towns in my 
district of Alabama. 
These funds will help our commu-
nities with their lost revenues while 
protecting the jobs of those essential 
workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand with the heroes 
and sheroes of Alabama, and I ask for 
all to support this bill, because we are 
dying in numbers, and we need to make 
sure that we are doing all that we can 
to protect the lives and livelihoods of 
all Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the HEROES Act. Let’s stand with 
our heroes. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, to 
date, 10,000 New Jerseyans have lost 
their lives to coronavirus; 1.1 million, 
their jobs. 
The toll of the pandemic on New Jer-
sey cannot be understated, nor can the 
need for additional relief. That is why 
I fought for desperately needed aid for 
State and local governments, a repeal 
of the SALT cap, increased funding for 
hospitals, testing, tracing, and PPE. 
In these times, we must stand to-
gether as a Nation. We must be bold, 
we must be resolute, and we must be 
brave. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the distin-
guished Republican leader of the House 
and my good friend. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, yes-
terday, Speaker PELOSI called scruti-
nizing China a diversion. That could 
not be further from the truth. 
First, China lied to the world about 
the virus. According to a recent study, 
95 percent of this crisis would have 
been contained if China had been hon-
est. All they had to do was be honest. 
Imagine all the lives and livelihoods 
that would have been saved. 
Second, during the crisis, China le-
veraged its stockpile of personal pro-
tection equipment for their own polit-
ical gain and at the expense of our 
frontline workers. 
Third, just this week, it was reported 
that China is now hacking our compa-
nies and universities to try to under-
mine our effort to find a cure to save 
lives. 
Speaker PELOSI should withdraw her 
comments. Instead, she withdrew her 
Members from what was supposed to be 
a bipartisan task force on China, one 
that we had planned and worked for for 
more than a year, long before this 
virus came from the distant land. 
Mr. Speaker, I would say to Speaker 
PELOSI that addressing China is not a 
diversion. Justice for Americans is not 
a diversion. It is what we must do to 
protect our country. 
The real diversion is the proposal on 
the floor today. 
This 1,800-page, $3 trillion proposal 
isn’t a serious attempt at making pub-
lic policy. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the talk 
which you had before your conference. 
I listened when Speaker PELOSI told 
your conference to ‘‘go big.’’ 
Instead of going big, it seems you 
went crazy. 
This is a political messaging bill that 
has no chance of becoming law. That is 
not my opinion. That is the opinion 
from your own Members and from the 
media itself. 
Why do they have that opinion? Let’s 
look at the flaws in the bill itself. 
Its central demands were written be-
hind closed doors, predates the crisis, 
and 
are 
not 
targeted 
to 
the 
coronavirus. 
Changing election laws won’t speed 
up the development of treatments or 
cures. That was the Democrats’ num-
ber one bill, H.R. 1. Does anyone re-
member back when they introduced 
that, the very first bill in Congress, 
long before anyone ever heard of 
coronavirus? 
Bailing out mismanaged pensions 
won’t keep cash-strapped Main Street 
afloat as Americans practice social 
distancing. 
Suspending the cap on SALT tax de-
ductions for millionaires and billion-
aires won’t reach the 36 million Ameri-
cans who are now unemployed. The 
Democrats promised to do that in their 
campaign, not when the virus came 
forth. 
This bill has more references to the 
cannabis industry in it than it does to 
jobs, even though it is jobs, not 
dispensaries, that are going up in 
smoke. 
Millions of more dollars earmarked 
for the National Endowment for the 
Arts won’t stop China from hacking 
our companies and universities who are 
working toward a vaccine. 
America is in a serious crisis, but un-
fortunately, Mr. Speaker, the House 
Democrats see it as leverage to pass 
their socialist agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, Majority Whip CLY-
BURN, who runs what I refer to as the 
2.0 Impeachment Committee, called it 
a ‘‘tremendous opportunity to restruc-
ture things to fit our vision.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, you have a Member on 
the other side of the aisle, who au-
thored the Green New Deal, who said, 
‘‘you absolutely love to see it’’ while 
she was cheering the loss of good jobs 
in the energy industry. 
There is another Member on the 
other side of the aisle, the co-chair of 
the Progressive Caucus, who said about 
passing more legislation, the concern,

she said, ‘‘For me, the leverage is that 
there is enormous suffering.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the 
American public that those are not the 
views from this side of the aisle. 
We do not view the coronavirus as an 
opportunity to reshape and restructure 
government. We do not smile and cheer 
when people lose their jobs. We do not 
think to use as leverage the fact that 
people are suffering. We do not see that 
as an opportunity to grab every philo-
sophical idea we have that has nothing 
to do with the coronavirus and put it 
into a bill. That is not who we are. 
Today’s partisan spectacle continues 
a trend by, unfortunately, the Demo-
crats that has strained Congress’ relief 
efforts from the very beginning. 
History will write that in January, 
Democrats were too busy impeaching 
President Trump to pay attention to 
what was happening in Wuhan, China. 
In March, Speaker PELOSI
delayed 
passage of the bipartisan CARES Act 
for 5 days. Her obstruction caused mil-
lions to lose their jobs and politicized 
the process but changed little in the 
bill. 
In April, Democrats dragged their 
feet over replenishing the crucial Pay-
check Protection Program for 14 days, 
allowing millions of jobs to be lost in 
the meantime and creating greater un-
certainty for cash-strapped small busi-
nesses. 
It is time for the political games to 
end. It is time to put politics on 
lockdown and get back to legislating. 
1,800 pages. I won’t ask who has read 
it, because I know nobody saw it in 
committee. We will vote on the largest 
bill in the history of Congress with not 
one committee hearing. 
But Democrats might argue back be-
cause H.R. 1, their election law bill 
that they passed more than a year ago 
before the crisis, they didn’t want to 
put it in here. 
Democrats took the time to change 
the rules of the floor. 
There are not many of us sitting on 
the floor today, Mr. Speaker, because 
of this virus. But there are more sit-
ting on the floor today than can actu-
ally pass a bill after the rules they 
want to change. 
You see, the American public, they 
might not understand that when they 
lend their voice for 2 years to the per-
son they vote for to represent them in 
Washington, that may no longer be the 
case. 
You see, now, after today, it only 
takes 20 people. Twenty Democrats 
could each hold ten proxies to them-
selves and pass anything they want, 
much like what we talked about here. 
b 1730 
It won’t stop China from hacking our 
universities to slow down our ability to 
have a vaccine. It won’t bring a new 
job. It may help the cannabis industry, 
but it won’t help Main Street. Maybe it 
helps you in an election because you 
are going to take an opportunity to try 
to change that as well. I will warn you, 
though, the American public is smart. 
We just saw, Mr. Speaker, just this 
Tuesday in a seat in California where 
you changed the election law there. 
You made it an all-mail ballot. That 
was okay. But when you saw the re-
turns were not coming in the way you 
wanted, you protested, so you changed 
it. 
You actually put a place where peo-
ple could walk in and vote, but not 
throughout the district. You picked 
one area. Where did you pick? The 
most Democrat precinct in the entire 
district. 
It didn’t turn out like you saw just a 
short time ago where a Democrat won 
by more than 9 points. No. It actually 
flipped. It flipped because the Amer-
ican public is frustrated. They are tired 
of these type of games they are seeing. 
They are tired of what they are seeing 
happening, Congress not working. 
There are so many Americans, mil-
lions, who are no longer getting a pay-
check, but Congress is for not working. 
What do you say to the Starbucks 
employee who works just two blocks 
from here that shows up to work every 
day, but not Congress? 
What do you say to the drivers who 
bring the food to the grocery stores or 
those who restock them every night? 
That that is essential. Or to the med-
ical community who care for us? That 
that is essential. 
What do you tell your constituents 
when you are going to ask them to 
vote for you again? That it wasn’t es-
sential for you to work, that you could 
have given a proxy to one of your 
friends who could vote for them, whom 
they do not know, whom they did not 
vote for, whom they did not lend their 
voice to? 
What will you say to the constituent 
in a time of need? That you wrote an 
1,800-page bill, but you didn’t write it? 
It was a select few, not in a committee. 
It had no oversight, and that is why it 
ended up talking about cannabis more 
than it ever mentioned a job. 
Yes, this bill is up in smoke, and it 
should end that way. But we should get 
back to what the American people ex-
pect of us: first, to work to earn your 
paycheck; and second, to make sure 
China never has the ability to do this 
again. 
For more than a year, I worked with 
the other side to create a bipartisan 
committee. They actually said yes. We 
went down to the date. We named the 
people. It was February. We were going 
to announce it, but they backed away. 
To the American public, I want them 
to know we welcomed Democrats to 
join us on this committee because we 
know and we understand 95 percent of 
this would have never happened had 
they not lied. 
We did not invite this virus; we did 
not welcome it; but we will defeat it if 
we work together. The first thing is to 
work together to defeat this bill, this 
rule, and bring the country back in 
this Congress, what we were supposed 
to do so long ago. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Before I yield to Mr. SOTO, I would 
just like to say to the distinguished 
minority leader, I know what it is to 
see people suffer in my district. I know 
what it is to see people die in my dis-
trict. There was too much time spent 
recommending Lysol and Clorox and 
other remedies for people who are real-
ly, really ill. So today, I am very 
pleased that we are working together 
with the leader of our party to address 
the pain, the suffering, and the illness 
that is happening in our communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SOTO). 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I don’t need 
a magic minute to say the obvious, 
that President Trump’s response to the 
coronavirus has been a colossal and 
utter failure that has left 36 million 
Americans without jobs, 87,000 dead, 
and 1.5 million with this disease. 
You can drone on and on about con-
spiracy theories all you want, but we 
are going to clean up the mess. That is 
what the HEROES Act is about. That is 
what we are doing here today: backing 
up first responders, funding new tests, 
and making sure we put dollars into 
the pockets of millions of struggling 
Americans. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), my very good 
friend, the Republican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my friend from Oklahoma for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here talking 
about Speaker PELOSI’s $3 trillion so-
cialist giveaway plan. If you look at 
this bill—we have talked about what is 
in the bill. We should also be talking 
about what is not in the bill. And, of 
course, they have $500 billion in this 
package for States, including many 
that already wrecked their economy 
and had billion-dollar deficits prior to 
COVID–19—$500 billion to bail them 
out. 
Keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, we al-
ready gave, working together, $150 bil-
lion to those States, and they haven’t 
even spent all of that money. They 
haven’t spent all of that money, but in 
this bill there is $500 billion to bail out 
States that were failing prior to 
COVID–19. 
What is not in this bill, Mr. Speaker? 
Money to hold China accountable for 
this whole mess. There is no money in 
this bill to hold China accountable. 
But, again, what is in this bill? Bil-
lions of dollars for people who are here 
illegally. Just look at this one page in 
the bill, a two-word change that makes 
accessible hundreds of billions of tax-
payer dollars to people here illegally. 
It is in the bill. 
Just what happened the other day, 
let’s talk about American companies 
that they are going after right now. 
Just a few days ago, the Democrat ma-
jority sent a target letter to a number 
of businesses that employ blue-collar 
workers all around America, steel com-
panies right here in Pennsylvania, in

Ohio, and New York—steelworkers— 
and they demanded in the letter: We 
ask you return these funds imme-
diately. So hundreds of steelworkers 
will go out of work based on the letter 
the Democrat majority sent out. And 
today, they are saying illegals can get 
that money. 
So you are taking it away from steel-
workers, shipbuilders, truck drivers, 
and you are turning around and giving 
it to people here illegally. What kind of 
set of priorities is that in the middle of 
a pandemic? 
Again, what is in the bill, you have 
got hundreds of billions of dollars for 
all of these other things, billions for 
taxpayer funding of abortions in the 
bill. 
What is not in the bill? Money to 
bring jobs back from China, PPE. 
You just saw the President, yester-
day, in Pennsylvania celebrating a 
company that is making PPE. So much 
of that is made right now in China. We 
are trying to bring that back because 
China is using their leverage to hold us 
hostage, not sending PPE, not sending 
lifesaving drugs. How about we make 
that in America? But, no, there is no 
money in this bill for that. 
But then this bill mandates that 
States do things that would wreck 
their election laws, things like: forced 
mail-out ballots, again, to people here 
illegally; telling States they can’t have 
integrity laws that would require a pic-
ture ID, Mr. Speaker. 
To get into the Democratic National 
Convention, you will need to show a 
picture ID, but if your State says you 
have to show a picture ID to vote, they 
knocked that off the books. What set of 
priorities is that and, by the way, what 
does that have to do with COVID–19? 
My goodness, we worked together to 
pass a bill to help families, to help 
small businesses and hospitals. Let’s 
work together to solve this problem. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman from Louisiana an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
want to look at what is not in this bill 
and what is in this bill. 
We worked together, Republicans and 
Democrats alike, to come up with a 
package of bills that will help families, 
small businesses, hospitals, and front-
line workers. We did that together, 
working with President Trump. And 
then all of a sudden, not when we were 
here, but when everybody was forced to 
work remotely, we see this package of 
1,800 pages dumped on us by dark of 
night that does all of these things that 
have nothing to do with this outbreak. 
We should be working together to 
help safely reopen, like 36 States have 
already done successfully. Congress 
should be here working, leading, not 
working remotely. We have proven 
today, and we proved a few weeks ago, 
we can be here safely doing our job like 
all of the frontline workers are safely 
doing their job. 
Let’s get this country back open 
safely. Let’s work together to get it 
done. Drop this wish list. 
Thank goodness this will not become 
law, but it shows you the misguided 
priorities when you see a bill with so 
much garbage like this. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI), a 
distinguished member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I represent 
three of the six hardest-hit counties in 
America. New York is the epicenter of 
the pandemic. 
As a former mayor and county execu-
tive, my biggest priorities have been to 
deliver funds to New York based upon 
the rate of infection and to eliminate 
the SALT cap. Both are included in the 
HEROES Act. 
Republican 
and 
Democratic 
Gov-
ernors, mayors, and local officials all 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, it is the height of hy-
pocrisy for Senator MCCONNELL to call 
this a blue State bailout when my 
State sends billions more to the Fed-
eral Government every single year, 
often to benefit Senator MCCONNELL’s 
State of Kentucky. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. THOMP-
SON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. It 
includes funding for State and local 
governments, for our healthcare work-
ers, cops, firefighters, and teachers— 
those on the front lines working for us. 
The tax provisions in this bill help 
small businesses pay their fixed costs 
and the wages of their employees so 
they can keep the lights on throughout 
this crisis. That is why small busi-
nesses support this bill. 
It improves the PPP to help the 
small businesses and help their em-
ployees, and it includes the FEED Act, 
a bipartisan, bicameral bill that en-
ables restaurants and small family 
farmers to feed hungry people. 
The HEROES Act is an investment 
by the Federal Government to help the 
American people get through this pan-
demic. 
Pass this bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the distinguished majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, there has 
been a lot of talk about how there was 
no consultation on this bill. One of the 
reasons was because Senator MCCON-
NELL, of course, said: Let the States go 
bankrupt. We are not going to meet. 
We will wait. We will see. Let the mu-
nicipalities go bankrupt. 
There was no energy on the other 
side of the aisle to engage once more. 
However, 
the 
President, 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, and others said when they 
signed the last bill that we needed an-
other bill. 
So all this talk about not cooper-
ating, I think, is correct, but I think it 
is incorrect as to who didn’t cooperate, 
who didn’t come to the table, who said 
let’s wait, who said let the States go 
bankrupt. So let’s not try to change 
the scenario here as to who wouldn’t 
come to the table. 
Today, more than 85,000 Americans 
have died from COVID–19, and that 
number grows every day. Wait, delay, 
pretend that this crisis has abated— 
that is not what the American people 
expect of us. 
More than 36 million Americans have 
applied for unemployment insurance 
over the past 8 weeks, which is more 
than one in every five workers in 
America. That is why we need to act. 
This is a public health and economic 
crisis like no other this Nation has 
faced. 
b 1745 
The people who are being hurt were 
not at fault. As one of the Republican 
Members said, and I agree with him, 
the economy was shut down. It didn’t 
go into recession or depression; we shut 
it down. 
When I say that ‘‘we shut it down,’’ 
the President of the United States said 
we needed to stay at home. He was a 
little late to that, but he finally said 
it. 
It is clear, therefore, that Congress 
has a duty to act. We have already en-
acted four major laws to address the 
impacts of this pandemic, and today, 
the House is moving forward with its 
next major legislative package. 
By the way, when Secretary Mnuchin 
called Senator MCCONNELL, he didn’t 
have a conference with us. He put a 
$250 billion bill Mr. Mnuchin wanted on 
the table. We said: Fine. Let’s talk 
about it. But by the way, the hospitals 
need money; we need more testing; and 
we need to take care of some other peo-
ple. 
Finally, after offering the bill and 
having it fail on the Senate floor, then, 
and only then, was there a bipartisan 
discussion. 
The HEROES Act will dedicate $1 
trillion toward assisting our frontline 
heroes by providing grants to States, 
cities, counties, territories, and Tribal 
areas. If you talk to any one of them, 
they will say they are hemorrhaging 
revenues and need help now. 
As State and local government reve-
nues decline sharply, this will not only 
directly support first responders and 
healthcare workers, but it will also 
keep teachers from losing their jobs as 
they contribute to this great national 
effort by blazing trails in virtual learn-
ing. 
Our bill would provide an additional 
$75 billion to ramp up a national, co-
ordinated effort for testing and contact

tracing, which we should have had 3 
months ago and, indeed, perhaps before 
that. That will be critical to any effort 
to reopen our economy so that we 
aren’t back here over and over again, 
confronting the fallout from this pan-
demic. 
It would also require the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administra-
tion, or OSHA, to establish a clear and 
enforceable standard within 7 days to 
require workplaces to develop and im-
plement plans to keep workers safe on 
the job. We admire and thank all those 
who showed up so we could stay home 
to try to defeat this virus. But we need 
to prevent employers from retaliating 
against people who say, ‘‘It is not safe, 
Mr. Employer. Make sure it is,’’ which 
is what we are doing on this floor. 
The HEROES Act allocates $175 bil-
lion to help renters and homeowners 
afford their monthly payments and 
utility bills as they deal with lost in-
comes. 
Why did they deal with lost income? 
Because we shut the government down. 
I mean the Governors and the Presi-
dent shut it down to try to defeat this 
virus. Very frankly, we are wearing 
masks to try to defeat this virus. It is 
a different environment. 
It increases SNAP benefits by 15 per-
cent to help those facing hunger. All of 
us have seen these long lines in our dis-
tricts of people who are fearful that 
they won’t have food to put on their ta-
bles. It is time to act today for those 
people. 
It protects our democracy by allo-
cating additional resources to protect 
the 2020 Census and secure our elec-
tions as well as ensuring the Postal 
Service provides its essential service. 
Mr. Speaker, as this crisis continues, 
the HEROES Act will provide direct 
payments to give additional help to 
those who, through no fault of their 
own, are struggling to pay their bills 
and support their families now—not to-
morrow and tomorrow and tomorrow 
but now. It extends for 6 additional 
months the unemployment compensa-
tion program created under the CARES 
Act, including its additional $600 per 
week and expanded eligibility to the 
self-employed, contract workers, and 
gig workers, while providing needed 
funding to State agencies to handle the 
historic influx of new unemployment 
claims. They are overwhelmed, and 
they need help now. 
It strengthens the Payroll Protection 
Program by making sure it can benefit 
underserved 
communities 
and 
non-
profits of any size as well as provides 
$10 billion toward small business loans 
through the EIDL program. 
This bill protects the independence of 
inspectors general. That is an impor-
tant aspect for the American people, so 
they can still strengthen oversight 
without the fear of reprisals from this 
administration. Mr. Fine was fired, es-
sentially, because they feared his neu-
trality and fairness. 
The 
HEROES 
Act 
also 
protects 
healthcare 
coverage 
by 
expanding 
COBRA subsidies so people have their 
health insurance by allowing a special 
open enrollment period in the Federal 
and State health insurance market-
place created under the Affordable 
Care Act. 
Mr. Speaker, this is the legislation 
that the American people need as they 
face this crisis. It is a bold response to 
an unprecedented challenge. 
So far, up to this time, we have dem-
onstrated unity in responding to those 
people who have been hurt so badly. I 
tell my Republican colleagues, with all 
due respect, it is not time to abandon 
them now. So, hopefully, we will rees-
tablish that unity. Again, I point out it 
was not us who didn’t come to the 
table. It was our Republican friends 
who said: Not now. Let’s wait. Let’s let 
some time go by. 
In the HEROES Act, we can say in 
one voice to the American people: We 
are in this together, you and us, you 
and the Congress of the United States. 
When the House passes this bill, I 
urge the Senate to work with us and 
with the White House. Some people say 
this bill won’t pass in this fashion. I 
think that is probably right. But we 
have set forth proposals. It is time, and 
hopefully, we will do it quickly, nego-
tiate our differences, and pass legisla-
tion to help those people without their 
jobs, faced with rent, faced with mort-
gage payments, and faced with paying 
their bills. Let’s make sure they know 
that we are in this together with them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ Vote for the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. RUIZ). 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, this is an un-
precedented crisis that requires an un-
precedented, bold response. 
The HEROES Act will support work-
ers, families, hospitals, and cities in 
my district struggling to get by with: 
direct payments for families; extended 
unemployment benefits; vital funding 
for police, firefighters, teachers, cities, 
and Tribal governments; and invest-
ment in testing, tracing, and treating 
coronavirus so we can safely get our 
country back to work. 
The American people can’t wait for 
their savings to run dry and their busi-
nesses to go bankrupt. Vote ‘‘yes’’ 
today for the HEROES Act to bring re-
lief to American families as we miti-
gate this health crisis. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, access to 
clean water and to affordable water is 
essential to saving lives and stopping 
the spread of COVID–19. No one de-
serves, Mr. Speaker, to die because 
they are too poor to afford water. 
In my district alone, thousands of 
low-income households began this pan-
demic with their water shut off. Just 
think about it. You are being told to 
wash your hands 10 times a day but you 
can’t have access. In the richest coun-
try in the world, 15 million people can-
not wash their hands during this pan-
demic. 
I thank my colleagues for supporting 
this bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
will vote ‘‘yes’’ on the HEROES Act 
today because it will help the small 
towns I represent and keep our first re-
sponders on the job. I wish that my col-
leagues would listen to the Republican 
and Democratic local leaders who are 
pleading with us to do that. 
I will vote ‘‘yes’’ because it pays for 
the testing we desperately need to go 
back to work safely. 
I will vote ‘‘yes’’ because it will help 
every American exercise our right to 
vote without jeopardizing our right to 
life. 
I don’t expect Senator MCCONNELL to 
agree with everything in this bill, but 
the time has come for him to start ne-
gotiating and find common ground. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL). 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I can’t believe what I am 
hearing, that this bill is political, that 
we have to wait, and that our constitu-
ents don’t need help. I want my col-
leagues on the other side to tell my 
constituents in Florida who can’t ac-
cess their unemployment benefits that 
they have to wait. Tell the people who 
don’t have food to feed their families 
that they have to wait. 
Each day that we delay, our constitu-
ents don’t get the help they need. This 
is a bipartisan bill, and local munici-
palities are in dire need of those funds. 
Monroe County and Miami-Dade Coun-
ty are going to get the money they 
need to pay for our heroes—fire-
fighters, teachers, and educators. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, as 
we face a challenge even greater than 
the Great Depression, it is imperative 
that we pass the HEROES Act today 
and then continue to fight. 
Next, I hope we tailor a specific plan 
to rescue America’s 500,000 neighbor-
hood restaurants and their 11 million 
workers. Without action soon, 80 per-
cent of them will go out of business 
this year, causing not just more eco-
nomic loss and unemployment but ir-
reparable damage to every community 
and every neighborhood in America. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time.

Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. COSTA). 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, the HE-
ROES Act legislation is vital to the 
health of the San Joaquin Valley and 
throughout the country by providing 
funding for much-needed medical edu-
cation. 
It provides funding to protect farm-
ers and farmworkers and our food sup-
ply chain that has been turned upside 
down. Ag markets have shrunk, and for 
some, they have entirely disappeared. 
We need to provide support to ensure a 
true safety net is in place for American 
agriculture. 
Our food supply is truly a national 
security issue. This has never been 
more 
evident 
than 
during 
this 
healthcare crisis. 
I stand ready to work with my col-
leagues in both the House and the Sen-
ate to arrive at a bipartisan com-
promise. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to

Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JUDY CHU). 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. 
Speaker, as businesses, families, and 
entire communities struggle, Congress 
must step up. The HEROES Act does 
just that, helping us through this cri-
sis. 
Our priority is a healthy economy, 
but there is none without healthy 
workers. So this bill ensures a plan for 
testing and contact tracing. 
State and local governments will be 
able to pay workers on the front lines. 
Families will be able to get help to sur-
vive 
unemployment, 
stay 
in 
their 
homes, and keep their small businesses 
alive. 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to 
wait one minute longer. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, before I 
proceed, may I inquire how much time 
each side has remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York has 21⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Oklahoma has 43⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, we have 
had a lot of talk on this floor about 
this bill and people pointing fingers 
and saying: It doesn’t do this. 
What it does do, though, is to provide 
real support for American heroes: our 
cops, our teachers, our firemen, our 
first responders, our State and local 
governments. 
And this is not a Democratic effort. 
This is an effort that is supported by 
Republicans, and somebody needs to 
say that: Republican Governors, Re-
publican mayors, and there will be Re-
publican Members on that side of the 
aisle who vote for this bill because it is 
the right thing. It provides testing, and 
it provides a way out for our heroes. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking my 
good friend, the distinguished chair-
woman of the Committee on Appropria-
tions, for the debate, and I thank her 
for her very good work. 
We have in front of us a product that, 
obviously, on this side of the aisle, we 
don’t agree with. We do not believe we 
were included in the process. Frankly, 
this was unveiled without any bipar-
tisan discussions. The Senate has al-
ready indicated it is not going to be 
taken up over there. The President has 
already indicated that he has a veto 
threat. 
There are certainly elements in this 
bill that I can support. I want to com-
mend my friend. Some of their work on 
Tribal issues was very, very impres-
sive. There are other elements there; 
there are things we can work on to-
gether in this bill. 
But my friends understand, as I think 
the fundamental reality, the Demo-
cratic House, they have every right to 
pass anything they want to pass. And 
there is a lot in this bill I disagree 
with, but I respect their right to move 
it across the floor. 
But you have to recognize the polit-
ical reality as well, Mr. Speaker. This 
bill is not going to be accepted in the 
United States Senate. This bill is not 
going to be signed by the President of 
the United States. 
I would suggest, rather than pointing 
fingers 
at 
one 
another 
and 
dis-
agreeing—and we do that on both sides 
of the aisle on occasion—that we do 
what we did recently. We worked to-
gether extremely well. My friend, the 
chairwoman, had a lot to do with that. 
We provided unprecedented relief to 
the American people in an extraor-
dinarily short period of time and did it 
with almost no partisan dissent on this 
floor. 
Sadly, that will not be what we see 
today. But because we don’t do it today 
doesn’t mean we can’t do it or begin to 
do it tomorrow or later. But it will not 
succeed this way at the end of the day. 
I have been exactly where my friends 
are sitting right now. I have been in 
this House when we had a Republican 
majority in the House and a Demo-
cratic Senate and a Democratic Presi-
dent, and we passed a lot of things that 
weren’t acceptable to that Democratic 
Senate and would never have been 
signed by that Democratic President. 
Sometimes you want to do that to 
make a point. 
This is not the time to make a point, 
Mr. Speaker. We are in the middle of a 
crisis. We need to work together. We 
have shown we can work together. We 
should actually take a great deal of 
pride in that, and we should go back 
and cooperate and move forward that 
way. 
This vehicle will not pass. There are 
elements in it, working with Repub-
licans, that could pass. There are lots 
of other things in here that aren’t 
going to. And the reality is we don’t 
have a lot of time. 
I actually agree with my friends in 
the sense that we are in a crisis situa-
tion. It is important that the country 
see us act, but it is important that we 
act together. We have done it in a mat-
ter of weeks. We can do it again. 
Mr. Speaker, I will just end on a 
hopeful note. 
We can have this exercise today. I do 
look on it as a partisan exercise. I do 
look on it as a messaging exercise. I 
don’t look on it as a serious effort to 
legislate. Serious efforts to legislate in 
divided government require consulta-
tion and inclusion with the other 
party. 
In this Chamber, that means—sadly 
for my friends in the majority—you 
have to deal with the minority, be-
cause your ability to pass here, if any-
thing rolls out of this Chamber with 
Democrat-only votes, essentially, is 
just simply not going to have any pros-
pects in the United States Senate. It is 
never going to be signed by a Repub-
lican President. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend my friend 
for all her hard work. I look forward to 
working with her—as we have so often 
done in the past—in the weeks ahead, 
and I hope we can come together, pass 
additional relief and additional policy 
changes that help us through this time 
that has come upon us through no 
one’s fault in this Chamber. 
Neither party wished for this to hap-
pen. Neither party had anything to do 
with it happening. And, frankly, when 
they are at their best, both parties 
work together to try and confront this 
crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, again, we have done 
that in recent weeks. I don’t think we 
have forgotten how to do it. So I hope 
we put this chapter behind us. 
I urge rejection of this bill, but I also 
welcome my friends to the bargaining 
table and look forward to working with 
them so that we can come up with a 
product that not only meets the needs 
of the American people, but a product 
that also shows the American people 
that we can work together and put 
their good above all else. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to 
say that my friend on the other side of 
the aisle is my friend. We have worked 
together. We have faced many chal-
lenges. And I do hope that we can face 
this challenge with direct assistance 
now because, in my judgment, we can-
not wait. 
As we close debate, the American 
people really have heard two visions: 
Democrats want to send additional 
aid to people, to the healthcare system, 
to students and our heroes. People are 
suffering. I see it in my district, and I 
am sure my friends have seen it in 
their districts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2245 
May 15, 2020 
The Republican vision, which is wait 
and see, we will do something. The dif-
ference, to my friends, I want to make 
it clear: That is not an option. 
Mr. Speaker, 86,000 Americans have 
died; 36 million have lost their jobs. I 
see it every day. Just the other day I 
spoke to friends at a nursing home. 
Too many people are losing their lives. 
Mr. Speaker, today is the day. We 
have an opportunity to act now. Let’s 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, 
over the last two months, I have pushed for 
and strongly supported four comprehensive, 
bipartisan COVID–19 relief laws. 
By enacting those laws, Congress and the 
President have provided over $3 trillion to 
meet the challenges posed by the virus and 
loan guarantees backed by the Federal Re-
serve have added trillions more to the rescue. 
Despite some stark differences of opinion 
on what constitutes the best federal, state and 
local response to the pandemic, we have 
managed to put partisanship aside and seek 
solutions. 
We have rallied for the people we serve— 
to make our communities safer and to ensure 
that the tens of millions made unemployed by 
COVID–19 have a bridge to prosperity again. 
Because so many Americans—especially 
those on the front lines-have sacrificed so 
much including their own lives to prevent the 
spread and heal the sick, many are alive 
today. 
Still, the loss of life—and disability suffered 
by those who have survived-is staggering. 
In my state of New Jersey, more than ten 
thousand people have tragically died so far 
with more than half of the fatalities suffered by 
women and men who resided in long term 
health facilities. 
During this unprecedented crisis, there have 
been serious negotiations with all parties and 
stakeholders to craft legislation to mitigate the 
pandemic through an integrated plan to pre-
vent, test and treat. 
Much has been done—but much work re-
mains. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, I am a strong 
believer in principled bipartisanship—espe-
cially when faced with a globe-altering pan-
demic. 
At its core, bipartisanship is about respect 
for others even when there are fundamental 
disagreements. Bipartisanship is not an end 
unto itself, but can be a practical, good faith 
path to understanding different views in order 
to achieve fair, equitable and sustainable solu-
tions to problems. 
More often than not, bipartisanship helps 
build support and consensus for effective poli-
cies. 
Despite some harsh rhetoric by some, we 
have nevertheless managed to put partisan-
ship aside and seek solutions. 
Until today. 
The bill before us today was crafted in se-
cret with no input from Republicans in either 
the House or Senate or the White House—it 
is the quintessential example of a partisan bill. 
There were no congressional hearings on 
new policy initiatives or changes to existing 
programs or changes to funding levels or what 
the costs might be for newly created entitle-
ments. 
Is there a Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO) estimate of the cost of H.R. 6800? 
Nope—it doesn’t exist. 
We had three days to read H.R. 6800’s over 
1,800 pages. 
I read the bill. I have more questions now 
than answers. 
And I am shocked by an unfair process that 
disallows revisions to the text or amendments 
to a $3 trillion bill—the costliest piece of legis-
lation in American history. 
I would note parenthetically, that I’ve spon-
sored and managed many major bills on this 
floor. My American Embassy Security Act of 
1999 for example was debated on the floor of 
the House for the better part of a week and 
we debated over 50 amendments to the bill 
before it passed the House. 
The rule today allows only one amendment 
to recommit. 
H.R. 6800 is unfair, deeply offensive and 
discriminates 
against 
students 
attending 
Catholic, other faith-based or private schools. 
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops 
and a large number of faith-based school as-
sociations wrote each of us last night to con-
vey their ‘‘extreme disappointment’’ that H.R. 
6800 ‘‘eliminates from eligibility for aid almost 
all students enrolled by their parents in private 
schools. This would represent a stark depar-
ture from 55 years of precedent under federal 
education programs such as the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(IDEA) and rejects the approach taken by 
Congress during all emergency relief efforts in 
memory . . . this is shocking and unprece-
dented.’’ 
H.R. 6800 also reopens the previously en-
acted CARES Act to restrict emergency serv-
ices to Catholic, faith-based and other private 
school students. 
That too is unconscionable. 
Mr. Speaker, where are the calculations to 
responsibly justify the need for taxpayer’s 
money, especially since funds provided in pre-
viously enacted COVID–19 appropriations 
laws are not even close to being exhausted? 
I am disappointed because I support some 
key policy initiatives in the legislation including 
federal assistance at some significant level of 
funding to state and municipalities—especially 
those hardest hit like my state and district. 
Today I introduced legislation—the New Jer-
sey, New York, and Highly Impacted States 
COVID–19 Relief Fund Act. 
Joined by my good friend and colleague 
Peter King of New York, the bill appropriates 
$500 billion in aid to the states, with significant 
amounts targeted to those with the highest in-
fection rates—like New Jersey and New York. 
Specifically, it appropriates: 
$280 billion to the states: 
$40 billion divided equally among 50 states; 
$100 billion awarded based on the state’s 
share of COVID cases provided by CDC data; 
$140 billion awarded based on the state’s 
share of population. 
$200 billion awarded within 30 days of en-
actment to all municipalities and counties: 
$100 billion to municipalities using a modi-
fied CDBG formula: 
$750 million to entitlement municipalities 
(generally defined as those with populations of 
at least 50,000) 
$250 million to non-entitlement municipali-
ties (generally defined as those with popu-
lations of less than 50,000). These funds will 
be awarded to states, which must make 
awards to non-entitlement cities based solely 
on population within 30 days of receipt. 
$100 billion to counties based on popu-
lation. 
Territories—$10 billion for the five territories 
and the District of Columbia. 
Tribes—$10 billion for tribal governments. 
$15 million for the Treasury Office of the In-
spector General. 
Given the death, morbidity and business 
lockdowns, many states will likely be unable to 
sustain their operations. 
Comprehensive 
COVID–19 
legislation 
should come to the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives for debate and votes after rig-
orous due diligence to the need and proposed 
remedies. H.R. 6800 has received no such 
scrutiny. 
It’s nearly certain that another COVID–19 
bill will be considered by the House and Sen-
ate. We’ve got to get it right next time. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my 
support for the HEROES Act. 
Yesterday, another 56,000 North Carolinians 
filed for unemployment, and 20 lost their lives. 
Unfortunately, the public health and eco-
nomic catastrophes caused by COVID–19 are 
not over—our families, our small businesses, 
our essential employees, our front line work-
ers, and our Heroes need relief now. 
I’m proud that the HEROES Act contains 
bills I’ve worked hard to support: 
Emergency funding to keep our most vulner-
able students fed and healthy. 
Essential health and safety protections and 
essential pay for our workers who supply our 
food, deliver our mail and serve our seniors. 
Desperately needed funding for housing, cit-
ies and states. 
Critical student loan debt reliefs. 
It’s a lot easier to keep an economy moving 
than try to bring it back from a screeching halt. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote 
in support of H.R. 6800, the Heroes Act. 
With more than 80,000 Americans tragically 
dead, more than 1.3 million sick, and more 
than 36 million out of work in the past eight 
weeks because of the novel coronavirus 
(COVID–19), there should be no doubt in any-
one’s mind about the staggering scale of this 
crisis. It demands extraordinary urgency and 
action from Congress. 
As the Republican-controlled Senate con-
tinues to stonewall additional relief legislation, 
going so far as to say states should just go 
bankrupt, I am proud that the House has put 
together an urgently-needed package to pro-
tect the lives and livelihoods of the American 
people from the devastation of the coronavirus 
crisis. This legislation is not perfect, but it is 
designed to deliver effective and immediate 
relief to families and workers in need. 
After hearing from dozens of my own local 
and county officials about the dire need, I am 
proud that the Heroes Act includes nearly $1 
trillion in relief funding to state, local, territorial, 
and tribal governments. This funding will help 
our state and local governments pay vital 
workers like first responders, teachers, and 
health care workers. 
The Heroes Act also puts us on a science- 
based path to safely reopen the country with 
billions for testing, contact tracing, research, 
and treatment, and it grants additional, much- 
needed relief to hospitals and health care pro-
viders. It also ensures that every American 
can access free coronavirus treatment, and it

creates a new special enrollment period for 
the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges to 
help the uninsured get coverage. 
As Chair of the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee, I authored provisions to 
strengthen working and travel conditions for 
those in the transportation sector, including re-
quirements on masks/face coverings for work-
ers and passengers on commercial U.S. 
flights, Amtrak trains, and certain public tran-
sit. I was also able to secure language to in-
crease the federal cost share for emergency 
declarations under FEMA to 100 percent fed-
eral so state and local governments aren’t 
saddled with extra bills as their own budgets 
are hammered by this crisis. I also worked 
with Chairman Pallone to include provisions to 
provide financial assistance to low-income and 
other adversely affected consumers to assist 
with payments for drinking water and waste-
water expenses during the pandemic. 
With millions of essential workers on the 
frontlines every day, I am pleased that this 
legislation would strengthen safety measures 
by mandating a strong, enforceable workplace 
safety standard from the Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration (OSHA). This legis-
lation would also ensure that these frontline, 
essential workers receive well-deserved haz-
ard pay. 
The Heroes Act also includes vital, direct re-
lief to millions of Americans, including addi-
tional direct impact payments, critical supports 
to assist renters and homeowners with making 
monthly rent and mortgage payments, expan-
sion of our nation’s nutrition programs as fami-
lies continue to line up at food banks, debt re-
duction for student borrowers who are facing 
economic distress as a result of the crisis, and 
an extension of vital safety-net unemployment 
benefits through January. 
This legislation also makes critical fixes to 
the Payroll Protection Program and resolves 
many of the challenges and flexibility issues 
Tribal communities are encountering when 
using federal relief funding. The Heroes Act 
also provides $25 billion to preserve the U.S. 
Postal Service and blocks the Trump adminis-
tration’s attempts to cripple this essential serv-
ice, while also including protections for our de-
mocracy with critical new resources to expand 
voting access and ensure safe elections dur-
ing this pandemic. Americans should never 
have to choose between their health and their 
fundamental right to vote. 
While I am strongly supportive of these and 
other provisions in the Heroes Act, I believe 
this legislation could have included proposals 
which would deliver more effective, stream-
lined, and accountable relief by keeping em-
ployees tied to their employers. 
One such proposal is the Paycheck Guar-
antee Act (PGA), which I believe is more com-
prehensive than an expansion of the Em-
ployee Retention Tax Credit and is estimated 
to save the government billions of dollars. 
Similar to the airline relief provisions in the 
CARES Act that I authored, I believe the PGA 
would largely end mass layoffs, keep workers 
paid and connected to their health care and 
other benefits, prevent employers of all sizes 
from being forced to close permanently, and 
ensure that the economy is ready to restart 
when the pandemic ends. 
Additionally, at least 27 million Americans 
have lost their employer-based health insur-
ance due to layoffs or furloughs during the 
pandemic. While I believe it is important that 
the Heroes Act would allow many of these in-
dividuals to maintain their insurance through 
COBRA subsidies, there are millions more 
laid-off Americans who would remain unin-
sured because they were not fortunate enough 
to have employer-sponsored health care be-
fore the pandemic. That’s why I support an ex-
pansion of Medicare, which would help ensure 
that everyone has access to health insurance 
during and after this pandemic, regardless of 
their employment status or employer-based 
benefits. 
I am also disappointed that this legislation 
does not include the $26 billion my colleagues 
and I had pushed to allow extension of grant 
research funding. Right now, the grant funding 
continues to flow, but because of the public 
health risks due to COVID, many researchers 
are not able to perform their research before 
the grant period ends, threatening their em-
ployment. While it does include $4.2 billion, 
the lack of more robust funding will mean re-
searchers in my district in Oregon will lose 
funding for their projects, and, ultimately, their 
jobs. 
However, it is abundantly clear that there is 
a need for Congress to act immediately to de-
liver robust aid to the American people. The 
Heroes Act is a critical step in our nation’s re-
covery, and I urge our Senate colleagues to 
waste no time in taking up this vital legislation. 
We must act—any delay will cause unneces-
sary and avoidable harm to our fellow citizens. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 6800, the Health and Economic Re-
covery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HE-
ROES) Act. Once again the Democratic 
House is leading the way by advancing a his-
toric legislative package to support our na-
tion’s heroes and every day Americans who 
are essential to meet the challenges of 
COVID–19. 
Since the first coronavirus death in the U.S. 
in February, over 80,000 Americans have lost 
their lives to COVID–19, more than 1.4 million 
Americans have been infected, and 36 million 
Americans have filed for unemployment. 
Workers, families, health care providers and 
students are all hurting because their financial 
wellbeing, employment status and health are 
being tested by the coronavirus. 
The HEROES Act builds on the critical in-
vestments Congress made since this public 
health and economic emergency began. We 
passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion funding pack-
age on March 4th to strengthen our nation’s 
public health response to the coronavirus. A 
week later we passed the bipartisan Families 
First Act, which provided tens of billions of dol-
lars to help working families and provide free 
coronavirus testing to anyone who needed 
one. At the end of March, we passed the larg-
est aid package in American history, the bipar-
tisan CARES Act, to fund health care pro-
viders; provide an additional $600 per week in 
Unemployment Insurance; and funding for 
small businesses to retain their employees. 
On April 4th we replenished the Paycheck 
Protection Program and advanced a national 
testing strategy. 
The HEROES Act goes further than any leg-
islation passed to date by providing des-
perately needed financial support to families, 
workers, and those who are risking their lives 
to perform essential jobs. It includes support 
for states, tribes, and local governments who 
are working to contain the pandemic, and the 
legislation guarantees that no American will go 
bankrupt paying for treatment related to 
COVID–19. It mandates workplace standards 
and protections for front line health care work-
ers, and it protects our most vulnerable in 
nursing homes by creating a ’strike force’ to 
manage infection and reduce the spread of 
COVID–19. Importantly, the bill also funds the 
U.S. Postal Service and requires all states to 
provide no-excuse voting by mail for Novem-
ber’s election. As we work to provide health 
care resources, we must protect constitu-
tionally mandated elections and the health of 
our democracy. 
Specifically, the HEROES Act includes: 
An additional round of $1,200 stimulus pay-
ments to every American making less than 
$75,000. 
A Heroes’ Fund for essential workers, with 
$200 billion to ensure that those who risk their 
lives for others during the pandemic receive 
hazard pay. 
$4.5 billion for research and development of 
vaccines and therapeutics, with a focus on im-
proving our nation’s domestic manufacturing 
capacity. 
$75 billion for testing, contact tracing and 
other COVID–19 monitoring and suppressing 
activities. 
An additional $100 billion for health care 
providers who have lost revenue or experi-
enced increases in costs related to COVID– 
19. 
$500 billion to states to cover lost revenues 
due to the pandemic. The State of California 
is projected to receive more than $47 billion, 
and local governments will receive $375 billion 
to cover lost revenues due to the pandemic in 
two installments. This funding will be a lifeline 
to local governments providing critical services 
including much of the social safety net. 
An increase to the minimum and maximum 
SNAP benefits. The bill rescinds work require-
ments and Trump Administration regulations 
that limit eligibility for SNAP. 
I’m especially proud that the HEROES Act 
includes many of my legislative priorities. The 
legislation requires the FDA to report foreign 
drug manufacturing sites and the volume of 
drugs manufactured overseas, and it author-
izes the National Academies of Sciences, En-
gineering, and Medicine to convene a commis-
sion to report to Congress in 90 days on how 
to best bring the manufacturing of critical 
drugs and devices back to the U.S. Legislation 
I authored to allow the Strategic National 
Stockpile to sell soon-to-be expired products 
to other governmental agencies and an expan-
sion of the Federal Communication Commis-
sion’s telehealth program are also included. 
The HEROES Act also includes a study on the 
short and long-term health impacts of COVID– 
19 because we have much more to learn 
about the effects of this novel virus on the 
human body. 
The HEROES Act will not be the last legis-
lation to address the public health and eco-
nomic disaster wrought by coronavirus, but it’s 
essential for the House to move expeditiously 
to stabilize our cascading economy, protect 
front line workers, help struggling families, and 
assist our state and local governments, and 
our health care providers so they can continue 
their heroic work. 
I’m proud to support this legislation to help 
the American people in one of our nation’s 
most crucial hours of need and I urge my col-
leagues to vote for the HEROES Act.

society, our physical well-being, and our econ-
omy have emerged with brutal clarity under 
the impact of the coronavirus. The pandemic’s 
devastation on the least secure is widespread 
across multiple facets of life and profound in 
impact. 
I strongly support the Heroes Act because it 
will targets significant emergency assistance 
to improve well-being and help meet basic 
needs of some of those who are hardest hit by 
the pandemic. It is designed to get this critical 
aid to the local level quickly, prioritizing people 
who may not be receiving other help and enti-
ties with demonstrated success in helping indi-
viduals most in need. 
Before the pandemic, my constituents strug-
gled with poverty. Almost one-third of children 
in my District live in poverty, almost one-fifth 
of adults in my District over 18 have income 
below the poverty level, and one-quarter 
taxfilers in my District were low-income work-
ing parents. The pandemic and national crisis 
exacerbated the income inequality, hunger, 
and housing insecurity; in addition, the African 
American and Latinx communities have dis-
proportionately lost their lives due to these 
persistent disparities in our society that so 
many took for granted. 
As a Member of the Committee on Ways 
and Means and as Chairman of the Sub-
committee on Worker & Family Support, I am 
proud of the policies providing critical sup-
ports, including: 
A second round of more generous direct 
payments—up to $6,000 per family—to help 
individuals and families pay for food and hous-
ing; 
Extension of the $600 federal unemploy-
ment payments through January 2021 recog-
nizing that workers will face a job market un-
like anything our country has experienced; 
Modernization of key work and child tax 
credits to improve the economic well-being, re-
duce poverty, and increase labor-fore partici-
pation of millions of workers; 
$850 million for child and family care for es-
sential workers; 
$100 million to strengthen vulnerable chil-
dren and families via home visiting; 
Substantial investment in public health via 
coverage for people, help for physicians and 
hospitals, and free treatment; and 
Stabilization of multiemployer and single 
employer pension plans to protect retirees. 
I applaud the investments in food security, 
housing assistance, small business assist-
ance, help for non-profits, broadband, tribes, 
veterans, tribes, and our democracy. 
I am thankful that this bill includes bills that 
I have championed—the expansion of the 
Earned Income Tax Credit for childless work-
ers, foster youth, and homeless youth; the 
modernization of the Child and Dependent 
Care Tax Credit; investments in family care for 
essential workers and home visiting to support 
vulnerable children and families; assistance for 
foster youth; and the protection of vulnerable 
students from tax bills from emergency edu-
cation grants. 
This is an expansive bill. It is an expansive 
bill to meet a unprecedented challenge affect-
ing everyone in our country. The last hearing 
that I chaired before we began remote working 
focused on reducing child poverty. We must 
not lose sight of that goal. We know how per-
nicious and devastating childhood poverty is. I 
am proud that this bill advances policies to re-
duce child poverty and strengthen the eco-
nomic well-being of families. I am proud that 
this bill invests in strengthening our commu-
nities and businesses so that we can all come 
out of this crisis stronger. This is an historic 
bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I would also like 
to thank my colleagues for adding additional 
funding for our nation’s tribal governments. 
This bill adds $20 billion to aid tribal govern-
ments who have been devastated by this pan-
demic, including tribes in my home state of 
Michigan. It is critical that tribal governments 
be given the flexibility to spend this money in 
a way that addresses the health and economic 
challenges they have endured. In many parts 
of Indian Country, tribes are among the largest 
employers of non-natives in their communities. 
We must ensure that tribal governments have 
the financial support to address the needs of 
their tribal members and those who are em-
ployed by the tribes. 
I am also pleased that language was in-
cluded in this bill that would ensure these fed-
eral dollars would only go to the 574 federally- 
recognized tribes. I want to thank my col-
leagues and Speaker Pelosi for including 
these provisions in this legislation. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I’m 
proud to be supporting the Heroes Act. 
This bill will provide $1 trillion to state and 
local governments on the frontlines of this 
pandemic to retain essential workers on pay-
roll. 
It will give much needed relief to renters and 
homeowners at risk of losing their homes. 
It will finally give direct payments to all tax-
payers, including workers with Individual Tax-
payer Identification Numbers and eligible indi-
viduals from mixed-status families. 
It will help families continue putting food on 
the table. 
And I am particularly proud that it includes 
my bill, which would set aside 10 percent of 
Paycheck Protection Program funds for minor-
ity and community lenders that lend to the 
smallest businesses. 
The American people need help now. 
We cannot wait to act. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote for this bill, 
which will help local and state governments, 
essential workers, families, and small busi-
nesses across America. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-
er, during this time of unprecedented crisis of 
Wuhan Virus, our families, small businesses, 
and hospitals need support now to maintain 
jobs, more than ever. Unfortunately, the 
Democrats have ignored any bipartisan effort 
to fight with families and jobs. Instead, we 
have the largest stimulus package yet, a $3 
trillion wish list that partisan House Democrats 
have put forward by themselves. This mas-
sive, partisan bill has truly shown that they will 
let no crisis go to waste. 
While millions of Americans are out of work 
and our families are attempting to recover, 
Democrats are mortgaging the future of 
younger Americans. Our children and grand-
children will be the ones paying the bill. Now 
is the time for Congress to work together to 
help our families recover from the coronavirus 
pandemic, I will be voting ‘‘no’’ on this legisla-
tion. This bill should never become law. 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops, and 
we will never forget September 11th in the 
Global War on Terrorism. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 6800, 
the HEROES Act, an urgently needed re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic designed 
to protect the lives and livelihoods of the 
American people while preserving the integrity 
of our democratic institutions on which our na-
tion relies. 
Among its provisions are those that will en-
sure our 2020 decennial Census is full, fair, 
and accurate. This bill grants the Administra-
tion’s request to extend data delivery dead-
lines for apportionment and redistricting, while 
requiring greater transparency from the Cen-
sus Bureau to Congress on the schedule and 
progress of 2020 Census operations. 
These provisions also grant colleges and 
universities the flexibility to respond on behalf 
of their students who have been sent home 
due to the coronavirus. In addition, these pro-
visions would ensure that in preparing and re-
leasing information related to the 2020 Census 
or redistricting, the Bureau focuses its efforts 
on information that is being collected in the 
2020 Census, without distractions or unneces-
sary diversion of resources from new, poten-
tially inaccurate data products that are not re-
quired by federal law. 
These provisions would require the Bureau 
to maintain high standards of data quality. To 
be clear, none of these provisions are in-
tended to impact or interfere with the Census 
Bureau’s efforts to protect the personally iden-
tifiable information of respondents, as required 
under Title 13. These provisions are common-
sense measures that reflect this difficult and 
challenging period in our history with the nar-
rowly focused goal of achieving a full, fair and 
accurate count of all-American residents in the 
2020 Census. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to swiftly 
consider and pass the HEROES Act so that 
American families and businesses receive the 
relief they need while ensuring an accurate 
2020 Census. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, during this 
unique and difficult time for our nation, I sup-
port The Heroes Act to respond to the 
COVID–19 pandemic and the related eco-
nomic catastrophe. 
This bill will provide relief to my constituents 
in California’s 19th District by providing nearly 
$1 trillion for state and local governments and 
the added flexibility to use these funds to ad-
dress significant revenue shortfalls. The State 
of California is projecting a $54 billion shortfall 
through the next fiscal year, and this additional 
funding and flexibility will help maintain various 
health and welfare programs as well as keep 
our teachers, first responders, public health 
and other essential workers employed. 
Throughout the pandemic, more than 3,000 
constituents and small business owners have 
contacted me to share the financial hardships 
they are facing. The Heroes Act addresses 
these challenges with a second round of direct 
payments for individuals and families, an ex-
tension of unemployment benefits, and $175 
billion for rental and mortgage assistance. 
Plus, it strengthens the Paycheck Protection 
Program and expands eligibility to nonprofits 
of all sizes. The bill also makes key invest-
ments in food security by boosting SNAP max-
imum benefits by 15 percent and nearly dou-
bling the minimum monthly benefit from $16 to 
$30. The bill provides $25 billion for the Postal 
Service to prevent its demise during this time 
when increasing numbers of Americans rely 
on it as a lifeline to receive medicine and vital 
materials.

COVID–19 has put an enormous strain on 
our education system, and this bill provides 
critical relief for students and schools. Our 
Santa Clara County institutions of higher edu-
cation will be eligible for direct emergency 
funding and billions more will be available for 
California to support elementary and sec-
ondary schools. The Heroes Act also provides 
$7 billion for childcare providers and extends 
student loan debt relief. 
The Heroes Act is also forward-facing, with 
$75 billion for testing, tracing, and treatment. 
California has been following science and 
medical professionals, and our national plan 
for reopening must also be strategic and 
science-based. 
As Chair of the Immigration and Citizenship 
Subcommittee, I authored provisions to pro-
vide temporary protections for essential critical 
immigrant infrastructure workers and help 
keep detention centers safe. As Chair of the 
Committee on House Administration, I secured 
safeguards for our democracy, including fund-
ing and protections to ensure elections can be 
held in 2020. Working with the Chair of the 
Rules Committee, I helped craft provisions 
that bring Congress into the 21st Century, 
which will allow the House to play a full and 
robust legislative and oversight role during the 
pandemic. 
A crisis of this magnitude requires bold leg-
islative actions, and this bill will provide relief 
for American workers, families, students, small 
businesses, and healthcare systems. I vow to 
continue working with my colleagues in the 
House and Senate to help jumpstart our eco-
nomic recovery and address specific commu-
nity needs during and after this public health 
emergency. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, as the House of 
Representatives considers further legislation in 
response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic, I rise to call for the eq-
uitable distribution of federal relief to tribal na-
tions. Despite the dire impact this crisis has 
had on tribes in my district in Central New 
York, these communities have been under-
served by current distribution mechanisms for 
federal relief. 
In March, Congress passed the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) 
Act to address the significant public health and 
economic impacts of the ongoing pandemic. 
Critically, this legislation allocated $8 billion for 
payments to tribal nations in response to in-
creased expenses and revenue shortfalls 
caused by COVID–19. These funds are critical 
to helping tribal governments maintain essen-
tial services during this crisis, however, the 
population-based distribution model currently 
being used by the U.S. Treasury has limited 
relief for tribes in my district. 
Across New York State, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has closed the doors of many economic 
enterprises operated by tribal nations. With 
these conditions likely to persist in the months 
ahead, tribes will face sustained shortfalls in 
revenue typically used to maintain health care, 
nutrition, education and public safety services 
for their communities. The costs of disruption 
are especially dire for tribes with relatively 
smaller populations, which have received lim-
ited support under the current allocation for-
mula for CARES Act funding despite facing a 
virtual cessation of economic activity. 
To address this disparity, economic impact 
must be accounted for in any additional relief 
provided by Congress or the Administration to 
our nation’s tribes. For example, utilizing avail-
able information such as employment or ex-
penditure data would help to ensure sub-
stantive federal support for tribes of all sizes. 
These efforts would represent a critical step in 
ensuring the wellbeing of tribal communities in 
Central New York and across the country. 
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the Heroes Act. 
When I talk to families in New Mexico, 
they’re sharing their concerns, fears, and 
struggles. They’re afraid of losing their homes, 
struggling to buy food, and can’t afford 
healthcare and medicine. 
I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to live 
paycheck to paycheck, to care for a child on 
a limited income, and worry for an elderly par-
ent who is in a senior community right now. 
The Trump Administration’s failure to begin 
widespread testing has caused heartbreak and 
economic stress for our families. 
This pandemic has laid bare the disparities 
that already existed in this country. 
Two sisters on the Navajo Nation who dedi-
cated their lives to helping others contracted 
coronavirus, didn’t get treatment in time, and 
died. Their sons will now go through life with-
out their mothers. 
Gladys Pineda, a single mom in my district, 
lost her job in homecare. She didn’t qualify for 
assistance because of her immigration sta-
tus—this bill will fix that. 
Heroes come in all forms—they’re hospital 
workers keeping our families healthy, grocery 
clerks stocking store shelves, teachers teach-
ing remotely, and families staying home to 
protect elders and their communities. 
The Heroes Act will provide economic sta-
bility so our communities can begin the long 
road of recovery from this public health emer-
gency. 
The families worried about housing security 
and utility shutoffs will have direct payments to 
help get through this tough time. 
Children in the homework gap will benefit 
from an investment in broadband internet 
connectivity. 
Small businesses will have access to a 
stronger Payroll Protection Program and emer-
gency grants that will reach underserved com-
munities and nonprofits of all sizes. 
We’re investing in testing, tracing, and treat-
ment to promote a safe and responsible re-
opening. 
Essential workers will get protection and 
hazard pay for the risks they’re taking and 
help for childcare and other dependent care. 
We know that state, local and tribal govern-
ments are doing everything they can, but 
they’re stretched thin, which is why I worked 
so hard to include flexible and retroactive 
funding in this bill. 
It means firefighters stay on the job, police 
officers don’t get furloughed, and the services 
cities provide remain intact for our families. 
As this pandemic impacts our democracy, 
we’re making sure every voter has access to 
the ballot box and every person in this country 
is counted in the Census. 
We’re keeping the Postal Service open so 
every vote counts, medications get delivered, 
and rural businesses have support. 
We’re boosting funding for the Census and 
delaying the count so every person has the 
opportunity to fill out their Census form. 
I heard from a dad in my district whose son 
serves in the military. He and his family were 
stuck in the middle of a move when the De-
fense Department issued its stop movement 
order. Many military families had to pay two 
sets of bills. 
The Heroes Act includes provisions I fought 
for to allow these servicemembers to cancel 
leases and contracts without penalty. 
In my home state of New Mexico, Native 
Americans make up just 11 percent of the 
population but over half of the coronavirus 
cases. 
The HEROES Act takes important steps to 
address this disparity by providing $20 billion 
for Tribal governments; addressing tribal busi-
ness concerns on PPP loans; and boosting 
funding for many Indian Health Service pro-
grams. 
I’m sure we all can think of more things we 
would like in this bill or things we might have 
done differently. For example, I’ve heard from 
some unions that have concerns about the 
way this bill goes about the important task of 
shoring up multiemployer pensions. 
As this bill and others move forward, I will 
continue to fight for the priorities that were left 
out and work with my colleagues to review 
and debate those on which there is disagree-
ment. 
To those who are saying that we don’t need 
this legislation, I want you to think about the 
two sisters who died on the Navajo Nation, or 
the person who checks you out at the grocery 
store, and the thousands of people who are 
struggling right now. 
American families are worth it, and we need 
to pass this bill. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the Heroes Act. 
This pandemic is a crisis unlike any we’ve 
seen in our lifetimes. 
In the last two months, more than 84,000 
Americans have died, more than 1.4 million 
have tested positive for coronavirus, and more 
than 36 million hardworking men and women 
have lost their jobs and livelihoods. 
We know that unprecedented problems call 
for unprecedented solutions. And the bill be-
fore us today is exactly the type of bold legis-
lation that a crisis of this magnitude requires. 
Most importantly, this legislation builds on 
our science-based approach to safely reopen-
ing our country. 
It’s clear that we cannot fix our economic 
crisis without fixing our public health crisis. 
Until we have robust national testing and 
contact tracing system in place, Americans will 
not 
feel 
comfortable 
returning 
to 
work, 
schools, restaurants, or businesses at pre- 
pandemic levels. 
The Heroes Act commits another $75 billion 
for testing, tracing and treatment. And it will 
help ensure that no one has to choose be-
tween putting food on the table or paying for 
the cost of coronavirus treatment. 
This legislation also brings much-needed 
economic relief to our state, local, and tribal 
governments on the frontlines of this crisis. 
By allocating nearly $1 trillion to local com-
munities, the bill will ensure that teachers, fire-
fighters, first responders, and other essential 
workers are able to remain on the job. And it 
will establish a $200 billion fund to ensure that 
these frontline heroes receive the hazard pay 
they deserve. 
Additionally, the legislation includes my bill 
to make state and local governments eligible 
for paid leave payroll tax credits for workers 
affected by the coronavirus. Without these tax 
credits, the costs of providing paid leave could

undermine successful local coronavirus re-
sponses at a time when budgets are already 
strained due to reduced tax revenues caused 
by the economic fallout of the pandemic. 
As I have advocated for many weeks, we 
must put more money in the pockets of work-
ers and families. The Heroes Act would pro-
vide a second round of direct payments to 
families, new payroll protection measures, and 
extended unemployment payments. 
It would also provide greater health security 
through COBRA subsidies and a special 
health care enrollment period, stronger work-
place protections, housing security and en-
hanced food assistance benefits. 
Some on the other side of the aisle have 
accused us of thinking too big with this pack-
age. 
But this is not a time to think small. Now 
more than ever, we must come together and 
take big, bold action to protect our commu-
nities from this unprecedented crisis. 
I’ve spoken to teachers and firefighters in 
my community who are worried about losing 
their jobs because of state budget deficits. I’ve 
heard from countless small business owners 
who fear bankruptcy. And I’ve received thou-
sands of emails from people scared to return 
to work because of inadequate testing. 
Like those in my community, Americans 
across the country are looking to us for solu-
tions. And that’s what is in this bill. 
Let’s put politics aside. Let’s do what’s right 
for the American people. And let’s pass this 
Heroes Act on behalf of all those who are 
hurting. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank my colleagues for their con-
sistent support of tribal governments. I also 
want to thank Speaker PELOSI and Chair-
woman LOWEY. They have demonstrated a 
deep commitment to these important issues. 
Without their personal attention and support, 
this historic investment in Indian country would 
not be possible. 
This is an issue that is deeply important to 
me because Covid–19 has taken a dispropor-
tionate toll on Native American communities. 
Historic inequities in health and infrastructure 
have resulted in extremely high infection rates 
on many reservations across our country. We 
must act, and I am proud to say, we are vot-
ing today to support Indian Country through 
the HEROES Act. 
As a member of the Financial Services and 
General Government Subcommittee of the Ap-
propriations Committee, I want to highlight four 
of the most significant tribal provisions in this 
bill that fall under our jurisdiction. 
First, we doubled down on the investment in 
tribal governments by adding an additional 
$20 billion to the Coronavirus Relief Fund for 
tribes. This additional relief will provide the 
necessary funding to support tribal govern-
ments as they cope with the devastating ef-
fects of the pandemic. 
Next, we made sure that the funding allo-
cated to tribal governments actually goes to 
tribal governments. We did this by clarifying 
that only federally recognized tribal govern-
ments listed in the Federal Register are eligi-
ble for this funding. This was critical, and it 
was done to ensure compliance with a recent 
court order. 
We also made sure that tribes—as well as 
state and local governments—had the discre-
tion to use this funding flexibly. This will en-
sure that tribal governments can cover any 
cost and revenue losses associated with 
Covid–19. 
Finally, we made sure that 100 percent of 
the funds appropriated for tribes from the Co-
rona virus Relief Funds will stay in Indian 
Country. We did this by clarifying that the De-
partment must reallocate any funds it claws 
back through enforcement action to other tribal 
governments. A year from now, we don’t want 
the administration to balance their budget on 
the backs of Indian Country. 
There is one other critical provision that I 
want to highlight. This bill rejects the allocation 
formula used by Treasury thus far. It requires 
a new consultation with Interior and Tribal 
Governments. That’s because the Department 
has so far only relied on a deeply inequitable 
formula that ignores the economic impact of 
Covid–19. In California, this resulted in many 
of the smallest allocations going to the tribal 
governments that have spent the most to sup-
port their employees and fight Covid–19. Com-
paratively, many of those tribes that are least 
impacted economically received the highest al-
locations. This must be remedied as soon as 
possible, and it is my hope that after additional 
consultation, Treasury will understand that fu-
ture funds must be allocated to tribal govern-
ments primarily based on economic factors 
such as total governmental and enterprise ex-
penditures in 2019 or wages paid to employ-
ees as measured by quarterly IRS Form 941s. 
Mr. Speaker, in this unprecedented time we 
face a question: will we use this pandemic as 
an excuse to walk away from our treaty and 
trust obligations to the indigenous peoples of 
this country? Or, will we rise to the occasion 
and make a clear statement that this country 
values our diversity and our commitments, and 
invest in the communities that need it most. I 
am proud to stand with our tribal nations in 
this difficult moment, and I urge my colleague 
to support this bill. 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in op-
position to H.R. 6800. 
A short time ago we were experiencing the 
greatest economic growth our nation has ever 
seen, businesses expanding, record low un-
employment, more prosperity for Americans 
across the board. Suddenly we find our nation 
thrust into a major health crisis, a pandemic 
caused by a coronavirus outbreak which 
began in Wuhan, China. Today, we have lost 
more than eighty thousand Americans from 
the virus and our economy is struggling as 
nearly thirty million Americans have lost their 
jobs. 
Early on we took steps as a nation, and in 
each state, to suspend economic activity in 
order to slow the spread of the pandemic to 
keep our health care system from being over-
whelmed and that worked. 
Hopefully many of the millions of job losses 
are only temporary, but some will be perma-
nent losses. The longer the economy stays 
locked up, the more likely we are to lose these 
jobs permanently. 
Most of the states are focusing on safely re-
opening in a manner that prevents outbreaks 
that would overwhelm the health care sys-
tems. Washington’s focus should be on finding 
ways to support those efforts so that Ameri-
cans can safely return to work and get our 
economy working again. 
Unfortunately, the $3 trillion, 1,800–page bill 
before us today fails to focus on a path for a 
working economy. Instead, Speaker PELOSI’s 
bill, written behind closed doors and with little 
input from the other 434 Members of Con-
gress, perpetuates ‘‘stay at home’’ as far as 
the eye can see. That is an unsustainable 
path. No nation ever has, or ever will, survive 
unless we work toward getting Americans 
back to work. 
PELOSI’s bill provides $1 trillion dollars to 
bail out poorly run, indebted states and local 
governments. It is fundamentally wrong to use 
this pandemic as an opportunity to exploit 
Florida taxpayers, forcing them to bail out New 
York, Detroit, Chicago, California and other 
states and localities that are in debt because 
the politicians they elected over decades 
made bad budget decisions. 
At a time when millions of American workers 
have lost jobs this bill provides billions of dol-
lars in stimulus checks to illegal immigrants, 
grants amnesty and lifts immigration caps. 
That is counterproductive and will delay eco-
nomic recovery and wage growth. This bill 
also asserts federal control over states elec-
tions and overturns long-standing law pre-
venting taxpayer funding of elective abortions. 
Across its 1,800 pages are 65 references to 
‘cannabis.’ 
This $3 trillion deficit spending bill does little 
to get Americans back to work, assist first re-
sponders, or defeat the pandemic. Americans 
want to get back to work. They want to safely 
open their businesses, return to their jobs and 
power-up this economy. They want their free-
dom. They want their lives back. And they 
want America to be strong and prosperous. 
Washington must listen to what Americans are 
saying rather than dictating from thousands of 
miles away. We must lead America out of this 
self-induced coma and back to prosperity. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
add my voice to the chorus recognizing this 
important fact: tribal governments and Native 
American citizens are disproportionately im-
pacted by this virus. And the reason they are 
so vulnerable is the historic failure of this 
country to live up to its trust and treaty obliga-
tions. 
Obligations 
like 
providing 
strong 
healthcare, education, and economic opportu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, the tribal set-aside within the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund is not nearly ade-
quate to right these historic wrongs, but it will 
help make sure that tribal governments do not 
fall even further behind as a result of the pan-
demic. 
The Coronavirus Relief Fund is a lifeline for 
tribal governments. The Navajo Nation is ex-
periencing one of the worst outbreaks in the 
entire Country, and Native Americans and 
Alaska Natives everywhere are more vulner-
able to this disease due to chronic lack of 
health care and higher rates of pre-existing 
conditions. Additionally, tribal governments 
without large outbreaks are suffering dis-
proportionate economic harm due to COVID– 
19 because they lack a tax base to replace 
lost revenue from shuttered businesses. When 
tribal governments made the decision to close 
their doors at tribal enterprises for the sake of 
public health, they also made the decision to 
shut off the revenue that supported vital gov-
ernment functions. 
That is why the $8 billion we passed in the 
CARES Act and the $20 billion included in the 
Heroes Act for a Coronavirus Relief Fund for 
tribal governments are so essential, and why 
we must ensure that all Tribes receive the 
help they need. I am proud that this legislation 
fixes a number of known challenges with the 
implementation of the Fund.

May 15, 2020 
First, it clarifies that only federally recog-
nized tribal governments listed in the Federal 
Register are eligible for this fund. That was al-
ways the intent of Congress—a conclusion 
that has been upheld in a court of law—but it 
also is common sense. 
Second, the bill clarifies that all of the fund-
ing allocated to tribal nations must stay with 
tribal nations. If some Tribes are unable to use 
their allocated money under the CRF by De-
cember 30, 2020, this bill requires Treasury to 
reallocate those unused funds to Tribal gov-
ernments whose need was not met. Experi-
ence has shown us that the impact of the 
virus is not even across the nation, and this 
provision recognizes that fact. Additionally, it is 
worth noting that the bill also directs Treasury 
to reallocate any funding that the Inspector 
General recoups as a result of an audit and 
clarifies that any funding a tribe returns to 
Treasury is not subject to interest. 
Finally, this bill asks Treasury, the Depart-
ment of the Interior, and Tribal Governments 
to once again consult on the allocation of this 
funding. As Chairman of the Indigenous Peo-
ples Subcommittee, I have heard from dozens 
of tribal leaders that the allocation process 
thus far has been flawed. The Administration’s 
decision to strictly adhere to the Indian Hous-
ing Block Grant population formula has re-
sulted in dramatically inaccurate counts for 
many Tribes. To the extent that Treasury feels 
the need to use population as a factor at all 
in further allocating this fund, the Heroes Act 
requires the Department to use population 
data provided by Tribal governments rather 
than IHBG. 
Further, the fact that the only funds that 
have been released so far have been based 
solely on population data has resulted in ex-
treme inequality amongst Tribal Nations, with 
many of the tribal governments that have en-
dured the most significant economic hardship 
receiving the least economic support. To rec-
tify this problem, the Department should allo-
cate further funding primarily based on eco-
nomic factors, as well as ensure that all Tribes 
receive a stronger baseline of relief than the 
$100,000 previously announced by Treasury. 
I am proud to support this bill and hope that 
it can be the first step towards keeping our 
trust responsibilities to Tribes during this crisis 
and well into the future. 
Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, it has now 
been seven weeks since the President signed 
the CARES Act into law to provide crucial re-
lief to small businesses around the country. 
While these funds have been essential to 
keeping the doors open for many businesses, 
I want to draw attention to the entities that re-
main unable to access the emergency federal 
funding they desperately need despite pro-
viding invaluable community services during 
this emergency. 
Throughout this crisis, YMCAs across the 
state of North Carolina have been on the front 
lines, working to ensure essential personnel 
have the resources and assistance they need. 
In the last few weeks, the YMCA of the Tri-
angle in Raleigh, NC has provided child care 
services for over 1,700 healthcare workers 
and served roughly 50,000 meals to families 
across the region. In Garner, NC, the Poole 
Family YMCA has provided stability and care 
to essential personnel by setting up day 
camps for their children. Their invaluable ef-
forts are central to ensuring healthcare work-
ers can continue fighting this virus. 
Despite their work supporting essential per-
sonnel, YMCAs continue to be left out of key 
federal assistance programs. Under the Pay-
check Protection Program (PPP), which Con-
gress passed specifically to help groups like 
this, affiliated YMCAs that collectively employ 
over 500 people cannot access funds. As a 
result, the YMCA of the Triangle and the 
YMCA of Greater Charlotte have furloughed 
over 95 percent of their staffs as they continue 
serving communities at a net loss. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress cannot sit idly by as 
these YMCAs continue operating at a loss. I 
implore my colleagues to support an adjust-
ment to affiliation rules for the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program in the next emergency pack-
age to ensure that YMCAs can access the as-
sistance they need regardless of affiliation. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, today we are 
voting on the HEROES Act, two days after the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Je-
rome Powell very bluntly stated that the Fed-
eral Reserve has exhausted its capacity to 
maintain liquidity in our financial markets, and 
that given the severity of this recession, the 
Congress needs to step up again to provide 
more fiscal relief to keep this country from 
going into a tailspin. He went on to say a pro-
tracted recession will do far more damage 
than the cost of the measures we’re voting on. 
He was very explicit—fiscal policy is going to 
be costly, but the harm that would be done if 
we undershoot providing relief for individuals, 
households, and communities will be far more 
expensive in the long term than if Congress 
acts in a timely fashion. 
This bill does a number of things—it is a 
lengthy bill, but fundamentally it provides sup-
port for states and local communities to keep 
the lights on in terms of vital public services, 
and deal with the fact that revenue is col-
lapsing with the economic downturn we are 
experiencing. The bill includes a bipartisan re-
quest from the National Governors Association 
for $500 billion to states hard hit by the 
Coronavirus. The State of Connecticut, which 
has done a great job in terms of shoring up its 
rainy day fund is going through those funds at 
a very rapid rate, and this measure will help 
stabilize state and local finances over two 
years. Not only is this money just targeting 
larger municipalities, but also communities of 
less than 50,000 residents. That’s funding di-
rectly to small towns like Vernon, where I live, 
which is a community with 30,000 people, and 
many of the more than 60 communities in the 
second Congressional district. This means we 
can protect our school systems, our public 
safety programs, and essential services like 
public works that are the underpinning of eco-
nomic activity we would be hardpressed to 
maintain if we don’t step in with some real fis-
cal relief. 
There will also be for the first time, a real fi-
nancial recognition of those workers who 
throughout this whole ordeal have been 
deemed essential, have been going to work, 
and have been keeping this country going. 
Whether that’s health care services like nurs-
ing staff in hospitals, janitors, food supply 
workers, people in meatpacking plants, and in 
grocery stores that have kept this country fed. 
It also includes the people who have to go to 
work as a result of an order from the Pen-
tagon, like the shipyard workers down in Grot-
on, who are specifically enumerated in this bill 
as being eligible for hazard pay. These work-
ers will be rewarded with premium pay for 
their essential work, on top of their normal 
wages, if this bill becomes law. 
There are many other important provisions 
in this bill, from help to the unemployed, to 
hospitals, to farmers, to further direct assist-
ance to families, all of which are gravely need-
ed. I want to thank the people of the Second 
district for the strong input that our office has 
received. It is my hope that this important 
emergency response effort becomes law. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6800, 
the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus 
Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act. Our na-
tion is experiencing unprecedented job loss as 
our communities deal with a global health pan-
demic that is responsible for the deaths of 
more than 85,000 individuals in our country in 
just the past few months. We cannot wait an-
other day, another week, or another month to 
take action. Our communities need help now 
and they are looking to Congress to lead. I’m 
grateful for the leadership of the House of 
Representatives, Speaker PELOSI, and our 
committee chairs and staff for working with us 
to put together an ambitious bill that will send 
needed help to individuals and families in the 
form of an additional direct stimulus payment; 
to our state and local governments, which are 
experiencing extreme budget shortfalls; and to 
our small businesses that are the backbone of 
our local economies and the heart of our com-
munities. Although I am disappointed that the 
bill does not include several provisions includ-
ing ongoing payments for individuals and fami-
lies, additional funding to support child care, 
and a strong investment in our workforce sys-
tems, among other things, I will support this 
step forward. 
We heard loud and clear from our state and 
local governments—they need more support 
to keep our communities safe. This bill in-
cludes $915 billion in emergency funding to 
state and local governments, funding that can 
be used to help prevent teacher job loss and 
funding cuts to education and, importantly, the 
bill expands the use of funds to cover lost, de-
layed, or decreased revenue from the public 
health emergency. The HEROES Act also in-
cludes $90 billion for the State Fiscal Sta-
bilization Fund that can be used to provide 
emergency support to students—including 
Dreamers, who were previously excluded from 
receiving emergency grants—schools, and in-
stitutions of higher education. These funds are 
critical to supporting public colleges and uni-
versities, addressing student mental health 
needs, and purchasing technology and mobile 
hotspots to support distance learning. Under 
this proposal, my home state of Oregon would 
receive approximately $980 million. 
During this public health crisis, no one 
should have to choose between affording 
basic needs or making payments on their stu-
dent loans. The CARES Act suspended invol-
untary collection like wage garnishment or re-
duction of Social Security payments for delin-
quent federally-owned student loans. The HE-
ROES Act follows my recommendation to ex-
tend these protections to all borrowers, includ-
ing those who have privately held student 
loans. 
Building on my earlier efforts to make sure 
K12 students can access school meals during 
school closures, this legislation funds school 
meal and child and adult care food programs 
with emergency relief that will help schools 
continue to meet the needs of children and 
their families. This bill will further help families

access nutritious meals by increasing the 
SNAP benefit level by 15 percent. 
I am grateful that this bill provides $7 billion 
for child care, but this is far from the invest-
ment that is needed to support families, pro-
viders, and the child care workforce at this 
critical time. I will continue to fight for signifi-
cant, additional funding in future relief pack-
ages. If child care is not available and afford-
able, families will be not be able to return to 
work. Additionally, I will continue to fight for 
additional funding for the Community Services 
Block Grant program to support the vital anti- 
poverty work of the more than 1,000 Commu-
nity Action agencies across this country. 
We cannot overcome this virus until we 
drastically increase our public health efforts. 
The HEROES Act provides crucial funding to 
conduct national testing, implement a contact 
tracing and surveillance strategy, and allow all 
Americans to seek treatment for COVID–19 
without worrying about the cost. The bill also 
increases support for our frontline health care 
providers, invests in public health infrastruc-
ture, and expands access to health coverage 
whether 
employer-provided, 
publicly 
sup-
ported, or on the open market. The HEROES 
Act also provides key resources to older 
adults and people with disabilities. The bill 
provides an additional $85 million in funding 
for Older Americans Act (OAA) programs that 
were reauthorized earlier this year by legisla-
tion I was proud to lead. This means more re-
sources for supportive services, nutrition pro-
grams, assistive technology, and elder rights 
protection activities. 
The direct payments to individuals in the 
CARES Act was an important first step, but I 
know that too many people in Northwest Or-
egon and across the country need more sup-
port during this health and economic crisis. Al-
though this bill does not provide at least 
$2,000 per month for individuals through the 
duration of the pandemic, which I advocated 
for, it does provide a second stimulus payment 
of $1200 to most individuals and, importantly, 
it retroactively fixes a problem in CARES and 
will now extend direct payments to individuals 
filing with Individual Taxpayer Identification 
Numbers. 
More than 396,000 Oregonians have filed 
for unemployment insurance in the last two 
months. I know how important this support is 
during the pandemic, and I’m working in Con-
gress to strengthen and expedite access to 
these benefits. The HEROES Act expands the 
additional $600 in federal benefits added to 
every weekly unemployment compensation 
check through January 2021, and it extends 
eligibility for self-employed individuals, gig 
economy workers, and independent contrac-
tors. This vital economic support must con-
tinue until workers can safely get back on the 
job. Also it is truly unfortunate that, despite the 
merits of a more comprehensive approach, the 
HEROES Act does not include the Paycheck 
Guarantee Act, legislation spearheaded by 
Congresswoman PRAMILA JAYAPAL. The Pay-
check Guarantee Act would allow most individ-
uals to stay on payroll during this national 
emergency and keep their benefits, and it 
would also significantly reduce the number of 
people filing for Unemployment Insurance. I 
will continue to advocate for creative ap-
proaches like the Paycheck Guarantee Act 
that maximize the benefits to workers and the 
economy while also reducing bureaucracy. 
We need to do more to protect workers from 
hazardous conditions on the job, and I will 
keep fighting for workplace protections and 
personal protective equipment for all workers 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. I am an origi-
nal cosponsor of the COVID–19 Every Worker 
Protection Act, and I’m pleased that it is in-
cluded in the HEROES Act with additional 
funding for the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration. Protecting essential 
workers during the pandemic is one of my top 
priorities. I have also advocated for premium 
pay for essential workers to recognize their 
role in sustaining our communities and the 
sacrifices they are making during the pan-
demic. The HEROES Act will provide frontline 
workers who are in contact with patients, the 
public, or co-workers—including grocery store 
workers, health care workers, and first re-
sponders—with an additional $13 per hour in 
premium pay on top of regular wages, up to 
$10,000. 
As more communities start to lift stay-at- 
home orders, all workers need access to paid 
family, medical, and sick leave benefits. The 
HEROES Act will help expand access to 
emergency paid sick leave and emergency 
paid family and medical leave by eliminating 
exemptions for health care workers, first re-
sponders, workers at businesses with fewer 
than 50 employees, and workers at busi-
nesses with 500 or more employees. And I will 
keep working with my colleagues to secure 
permanent paid sick leave and paid family and 
medical leave for all workers. 
I started working at Legal Aid while I at-
tended community college, and learned there 
that people do not struggle by choice. With 
our national economy upended, consumers 
face even greater financial hardships and 
predatory actors continue to take advantage of 
people facing this crisis. We should have im-
plemented the strengthened consumer protec-
tions in the HEROES Act at the beginning of 
this crisis, and I have continued calls for their 
passage. I’m glad that the HEROES Act sus-
pends consumer debt collection during the 
COVID–19 emergency and for 120 days after 
the end of the national emergency to make 
sure consumers can fully recover. I worked 
with the Congressional Progressive Caucus to 
make debt collection suspension a priority in 
relief legislation. 
We know that Oregonians are struggling 
through no fault of their own, and they should 
not be further harmed financially. Negative 
credit reporting will be suspended under the 
HEROES Act for the duration of this crisis and 
any future national emergencies. This is an 
essential step to safeguard consumers most 
affected by the current outbreak. I have also 
continued to call for medical debt collection 
and credit reporting suspensions—needed re-
forms to prevent a hospital visit from destroy-
ing the credit of consumers. I am glad to see 
that medical debt related to coronavirus treat-
ments will not result in adverse credit informa-
tion; however, we must give consumers the 
flexibility to settle their medical debt before it 
shows up on a credit report and we must con-
tinue to fight so everyone can access afford-
able health care. 
The HEROES Act also clarifies the intent of 
the CARES Act by preventing the garnish-
ment, levy, or seizing of direct payment for pri-
vate debts. I have been a vocal advocate for 
stopping unfair garnishment and protecting 
payments like Social Security and other es-
sential earned benefits. 
Oregon has strong laws to prevent unfair 
price hikes during crises like the current pan-
demic. I am continuing to work with Oregon 
Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum on ways to 
expand Oregon’s protections to all Americans. 
It’s beneficial that the HEROES Act includes 
provisions to stop unconscionably excessive 
prices on necessities like food, hygiene prod-
ucts, personal protective equipment, and 
health services. 
Workforce boards, labor unions, community 
colleges, 
community-based 
organizations, 
small businesses, and other stakeholders are 
training health care, direct care, and frontline 
workers, but they are in desperate need of 
more resources. I am pleased that the HE-
ROES Act includes $2.5 billion for adult edu-
cation, 
youth 
training, 
dislocated 
worker 
grants, migrant and seasonal farmworker pro-
grams, and public health worker recruitment 
and training as authorized in the Workforce In-
novation and Opportunity Act, but this funding 
is insufficient to meet the scale of the crisis at 
hand. For comparison, the American Reinvest-
ment and Recovery Act provided more than 
$7.7 billion in workforce funding. To respond 
to 
the 
economic 
consequences 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, we need at least $15 
.1 billion in supplemental federal investments 
to help prevent further layoffs and provide dis-
located workers and employers with access to 
employment services like training, career navi-
gation, and supportive services. I will keep 
working with my colleagues on the Education 
and Labor Committee to advance the Re-
launching America’s Workforce Act because 
the historic unemployment levels over the last 
two months require an equally historic re-
sponse to support workers. 
No one should be forced to choose between 
paying their bills and paying for food, but as 
Oregonians face the ongoing economic con-
sequences of COVID–19, this is becoming a 
reality for too many working families. This bill 
includes $175 billion to assist renters and 
homeowners make monthly rent, mortgage 
and utility payments, and other housingrelated 
costs. The Low Income Home Energy Assist-
ance Program (LIHEAP) is an important wrap-
around support that helps low-income families 
pay for heating and cooling bills. The HE-
ROES Act includes another $1.5 billion in sup-
plemental funding for LIHEAP, but many more 
households will need and likely qualify for as-
sistance in the coming weeks and months. Ad-
ditionally, as individuals comply with stay-at- 
home orders across the country during the 
pandemic, they will likely be using more elec-
tricity and heat or air conditioning to keep their 
homes habitable. As we work to craft the next 
response package, I will keep fighting for more 
funding for LIHEAP to provide tangible assist-
ance to families who are struggling to pay 
their bills. I also advocated for assistance simi-
lar to LIHEAP that would help households 
economically affected by COVID–19 with 
drinking water and wastewater services during 
this national emergency. The HEROES Act in-
cludes an additional $1.5 billion for this sup-
port. 
The success of our economic recovery will 
depend on the success of our small busi-
nesses. The Paycheck Protection Program 
was a good first lifeline for many, but many 
business owners are concerned about artificial 
timelines and a lack of flexibility in the pro-
gram. I’m glad that the HEROES Act will ex-
tend the coverage period to the end of 2020 
and give businesses additional flexibility while 
still adhering to local stay-at-home orders that

may not allow them to fully open and resume 
operating for some time to come. The bill 
would also expand PPP eligibility to additional 
nonprofit organizations of all types and sizes, 
as well as provide an additional $10 billion in 
economic injury disaster grants (EIDL) through 
the Small Business Administration. 
Fisheries are an important part of our econ-
omy in Northwest Oregon, and I know that our 
coastal communities need more assistance to 
get through these challenging times. The HE-
ROES Act provides an additional $100 million 
in disaster funding, and I will keep working to 
secure more direct assistance for fisheries and 
the domestic seafood supply chain. Northwest 
Oregon is known for its prestigious specialty 
crops, and our farmers have been struggling 
to make ends meet during the pandemic. The 
HEROES Act will also support our specialty 
crop farmers by providing $100 million for spe-
cialty crop grants and $50 million for support 
for local farmers markets and other direct to 
consumer markets. 
This bill addresses one of the key short-
comings of previous legislative efforts; the ex-
clusion of individuals from direct economic re-
lief because of their immigration status. The 
HEROES Act retroactively extends direct pay-
ments to mixed-status families and immigrants 
who file taxes using ITINs, and it expands eli-
gibility for other economic support. It removes 
barriers to testing, treatment, vaccines, and 
other health care based solely on immigration 
status and automatically extends work permits 
for individuals with DACA or TPS. The bill of-
fers protections from ICE removal and employ-
ment authorization for individuals in critical in-
dustries, including agricultural workers and 
meatpackers. It also requires ICE to review its 
detention policies and find alternatives for indi-
viduals not subject to mandatory detention. 
Importantly, the HEROES Act strengthens 
our democratic institutions with new resources 
to conduct secure, reliable elections using 
vote-by-mail. Oregonians have used this trust-
ed method of voting for more than twenty 
years, and it should be implemented nation-
wide as a simple and safe solution that will in-
crease access while allowing voters to main-
tain physical distancing measures. 
We must act quickly and decisively to curb 
the spread of COVID–19 and create condi-
tions that will allow us to begin our recovery, 
but we must also act boldly so our response 
is sufficient to prevent a widespread resur-
gence of the virus. We must also not leave 
behind any segment of our society as we work 
to repair the immense and harmful economic 
damage that we see across Oregon and the 
country. We are all safer and healthier when 
everyone in our communities is safer and 
healthier. I commend House leadership for 
putting forward a proposal that responsibly ad-
dresses the desperate need we are currently 
facing while also acknowledging the potentially 
disastrous costs of doing too little. I urge all 
my colleagues to support our nurses, first re-
sponders, grocery workers, and all frontline 
heroes by supporting this legislation. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, 
I strongly support the House Majority’s He-
roes Act which is a critical and urgent re-
sponse in our fight to defeat the COVID–19 
catastrophe. As the unimaginable toll of this 
virus continues to mount, an economic dis-
aster is also unfolding in every corner of our 
country. 
The Heroes Act is crucial to our ability to 
address these unprecedented crises. The bill 
includes new protections for working and mid-
dle-class families during this economic catas-
trophe by providing for a second round of di-
rect payments of up to $6,000 per household. 
And it ensures economic stimulus payments 
for everyone who files a tax return, regardless 
of immigration status. 
Our bill also provides $175 billion to help 
homeowners and renters make their mortgage 
and rent payments and new payroll protection 
measures to keep 60 million workers con-
nected to their jobs. The bill also extends 
through January 2021, the weekly $600 fed-
eral unemployment payments and it requires 
OSHA to develop standards to make work-
places safe from the virus. 
As we keep fighting COVID–19, the Heroes 
Act provides an additional $75 billion for test-
ing, contact tracing, and treatment that is es-
sential to our ability to save lives, curb the 
spread of the virus, and reopen our economy. 
Furthermore, the Heroes Act provides our 
frontline heroes with the support and protec-
tion they need as they fight COVID–19 to save 
lives, and protect our communities. This legis-
lation invests over $1 trillion into our states, 
cities, and towns, to ensure they can continue 
to pay our frontline personnel, including health 
workers, police officers, firefighters, transpor-
tation workers, farmworkers, and teachers. 
The bill also establishes a Heroes’ Fund to en-
sure our frontline workers receive hazard pay, 
and it protects our Postal Service workers who 
are making deliveries on their routes every 
day. 
In addition, the bill protects many immigrant 
families by automatically extending work au-
thorization for DACA and TPS recipients. And 
it protects the health of the public at large by 
ensuring everyone, regardless of immigration 
status, has access to free testing, treatment, 
and services related to COVID–19. The bill 
also protects essential workers, such as our 
nation’s farmworkers who pick the crops that 
feed our families, from deportation and it al-
lows undocumented students to access higher 
education financial relief and it permits natu-
ralization oath ceremonies to be administered 
remotely. 
Our small businesses also get additional 
support in the Heroes Act. The bill strengthens 
the Paycheck Protection Program to ensure it 
reaches underserved communities and non-
profits of all sizes and types. And the bill pro-
vides $10 billion for COVID–19 emergency 
grants through the Economic Injury Disaster 
Loan program. 
I am concerned however with the inclusion 
of the controversial GROW Act. And I hope 
this issue can satisfactorily be resolved during 
our negotiations with the Senate. 
Nevertheless, once again, House Demo-
crats are leading the way during this crisis of 
COVID–19 with legislation that will save lives 
and put families and workers first. 
We have no time to lose. Nearly 90,000 
Americans have died from this pandemic. 36 
million Americans have filed for unemploy-
ment. And as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome 
Powell said earlier this week, Congress must 
act now to prevent a deeper and more painful 
recession. 
I urge the Senate and the President to do 
the right thing and join the House in sup-
porting the Heroes Act to protect the American 
people, help American workers, and bolster 
America’s economy. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H.R. 6800, the Heroes Act. 
This November, the American people will 
cast their votes to elect a new government. 
Americans have voted during times of great 
strife in the past—during the Civil War, in the 
midst of the Great Depression, in the shadow 
of World Wars, and in the wake of terrorist at-
tacks. Americans will stand united to vote this 
November, as well. 
This year, however, we are faced with the 
unique challenges of a deadly, global viral 
pandemic which to date has killed more than 
80,000 Americans and infected more than one 
million people in the United States. This emer-
gency has already ground our daily lives and 
our economy to a halt. While drastic measures 
put in place have appeared to blunt some of 
the effects of this pandemic, we nevertheless 
face the prospect of a resurgence of the 
coronavirus in the Fall. 
Public health experts agree that we must 
take steps to mitigate risk of the spread of 
COVID–19. This includes limiting public expo-
sure to the virus by employing strict social 
distancing measures. These measures must 
also apply to the administration of our elec-
tions. To answer this challenge, the Heroes 
Act includes important provisions which I have 
authored to ensure safe and orderly elections 
in 2020. It appropriates $3.6 billion to assist 
state and local election officials to put into 
place much-needed protections for voters and 
poll workers. 
This includes expanding no-excuse absen-
tee vote by mail for every voter who wishes it, 
and providing 15 consecutive days of early in- 
person voting to ensure all who prefer or re-
quire to vote in person can do so without 
being forced to contend with overcrowded and 
potentially dangerous polling locations on elec-
tion day. In the event of an emergency dec-
laration, and including the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the bill provides that every registered 
voter will be mailed an absentee ballot with 
prepaid return postage so that they may vote 
from the safety of their homes. 
The bill also sets important federal stand-
ards to ensure the American people know 
how, when, and where to vote, how to track 
their ballot, and it provides an opportunity to 
cure issues that may arise before their ballot 
is rejected. 
We don’t yet know how conditions related to 
the coronavirus will impact our elections in No-
vember, but we do know that we cannot risk 
imperiling the lives of countless Americans by 
being unprepared on election day. The right to 
vote is an essential element of our democracy 
and Americans should not have to weigh their 
rights of citizenship against their own health 
and safety. 
The Heroes Act, if enacted, will put into 
place the necessary measures to allow every 
eligible voter to participate in our elections in 
a safe and orderly manner. The stakes are too 
high to fail to act, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 967, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time.

MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
opposed to the bill in its current form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Riggleman moves to recommit the bill 
H.R. 6800 to the Committee on Ways and 
Means with instructions to report the same 
back to the House forthwith with the fol-
lowing amendment: 
In subtitle A of title I of division B, strike 
section 20102. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. RIGGLEMAN) is recognized 
for 5 minutes in support of his motion. 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
offer this motion to recommit because 
Americans across this country are 
watching the steps we take in Con-
gress. 
Millions of Americans need our help 
and, unfortunately, millions more will 
lose their jobs if we consider partisan 
wish list legislation that has no chance 
of becoming law. 
Our Nation continues to battle the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and the strength 
and ingenuity of the American spirit 
has shone forth. We in this Chamber 
came together to pass the CARES Act, 
a bipartisan aid package in March of 
this year. 
In times of crisis, Americans should 
come together, but that togetherness 
has waned and the bipartisanship has 
vanished. Masked in darkness and so-
cially distanced from any review or de-
bate, this bill is filled to the brim with 
progressive agenda items. 
Hidden amongst these poison pills is 
a provision that would change the ID 
requirement for the CARES Act rebate 
checks from Social Security number to 
taxpayer identification number. This 
switch will allow illegal immigrants 
and noncitizens to get checks they 
aren’t eligible for. 
I didn’t think that a global pandemic 
meant it was time to stop helping 
American citizens who are desperate 
for assistance. Now, more than ever, we 
need to make sure these rebate checks 
go to Americans who need it. 
This motion to recommit shouldn’t 
be controversial. Unauthorized immi-
grants are not eligible for most Federal 
benefits, including SNAP, TANF, and 
most 
housing 
assistance 
programs. 
They weren’t even eligible to receive 
this money in the first CARES Act. 
The reason they are being included 
now is because this provision is the lat-
est in a grab brag of liberal priorities 
that Democrats are trying to sneak 
through in this bill. But not on my 
watch. That is why I am proud to offer 
this motion to recommit. 
It is time we show Americans that we 
will stand up and do our jobs in Con-
gress, be the responsible leaders Ameri-
cans elected us to be, not partisan 
headline grabbers or those who think 
messaging bills are more important 
than sensible legislation for all Ameri-
cans. 
The authors of the bill do not intend 
for this to become law, make a mock-
ery of our responsibility to govern. 
Enough of the messaging bills. Let’s 
stop playing politics and start working 
on solutions that will help the Amer-
ican people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, as of this 
morning, nearly 86,000 people in the 
United States have died from this 
virus. More than 1.4 million people 
have been infected, and those are just 
the cases we know about because of the 
frontline workers who are risking their 
lives to test as many people as pos-
sible. 
Unemployment is at its highest level 
since the Great Depression. Tens of 
millions of families are struggling to 
put food on the table and pay the rent. 
If you don’t understand the suffering, 
you haven’t been paying attention. 
Just turn on the TV—or better yet, lis-
ten to your constituents. They are de-
manding two things: facts and action. 
No 
matter 
what 
the 
President 
tweets, the facts of this pandemic are 
clear. And no matter whether Senator 
MCCONNELL sees urgency or not, the 
time for action is now. 
The American people have unprece-
dented needs, and the Federal Govern-
ment must step up to the plate, provide 
the necessary assistance to meet those 
needs. However, the Republicans are 
yet again standing in the way of help-
ing people. They are in the same denial 
that led to the Trump administration’s 
bungling of this virus. 
Against the weight of economic ex-
pertise, they are saying we need to 
slow down on spending money. Against 
the clear desperation of families, they 
are saying we need to wait and see 
what happens. 
Well, we know what is going to hap-
pen. We have seen what is going to hap-
pen. We have seen what has happened. 
There will be more cases tomorrow, 
more deaths this weekend, more eco-
nomic hardship next week. 
But instead of worrying about these 
concerns, the only thing Republicans 
can offer is regurgitated talking points 
about immigration. 
Right now, the American people are 
focused on their own survival and that 
of their families. 
I want to make it very clear: COVID– 
19 does not discriminate or differen-
tiate on immigration status. Our coun-
try doesn’t have time for Republicans 
to relitigate the culture wars. 
Regardless of background or country 
of origin, we need action today. People 
are suffering. Every day there are more 
cases. We need action now without fur-
ther delay. I strongly oppose the mo-
tion to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
b 1815 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of H.R. 6800 is postponed.

Mr. ZELDIN changed his vote from 
‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’ 
Ms. TLAIB changed her vote from 
‘‘nay’’ to ‘‘yea.’’ 
So the bill was passed. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
Stated for: 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I was 
absent during roll call vote No. 109. Had I 
been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on 
passage of H.R. 6800—the Heroes Act. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, as a re-
sult of my physician’s recommendation to 
avoid travel as a result of recent knee replace-
ment surgery, I was unable to be in the cham-
ber for votes today. Had I been present, I 
would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 105: 
Previous Question H. Res. 967, ‘‘nay’’ on roll-
call No. 106: Passage H. Res. 967, ‘‘nay’’ on 
rollcall No. 107: Passage H. Res. 965, ‘‘yea’’ 
on rollcall No. 108: Motion to Recommit H.R. 
6800, and ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 109: Passage 
H.R. 6800.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I am 
going to be yielding to the Republican 
whip in just a second, but I will an-
nounce the schedule for the weeks to 
come. 
As we face the crisis of the COVID–19 
pandemic, the House must do its duty 
in full and do so in a way that contrib-
utes to the safety and welfare of our 
people and not in any way that harms 
it. 
I want to thank each Member of the 
House for returning to D.C. today to 
vote on this important legislation. 
Madam Speaker, Members are ad-
vised that no votes are expected in the 
House next week. Members are further 
advised that the House will be in ses-
sion on Wednesday, May 27, and May 
28. 
As everyone knows, the Senate has 
amended the House-passed FISA bill, a 
very important piece of legislation 
that will require the House to act 
again. I expect that to be considered on 
the 27th. 
I also expect conversations to con-
tinue on additional legislation address-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. The House 
could vote on COVID–19-related bills on 
May 27 and 28. 
I am pleased that the House has 
adopted a resolution to allow the com-
mittees to work remotely. I look for-
ward to getting our committees back

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2256 
May 15, 2020 
up and running so they can begin hav-
ing hearings and markups on critical 
legislation. 
b 2130 
Clearly, the House, as it moves for-
ward, needs product. I have talked to 
the appropriators. I know that the 
WRDA bill is also a bill that we are 
looking at moving forward. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act is a bill that we want to see 
marked up. I talked to Mr. SMITH to-
night so, hopefully, we will be moving 
ahead, getting product, and we will be 
considering that. 
We have adopted some rules, not only 
for committees but for the floor, that 
will facilitate not only working on leg-
islation but also the safety of our 
Members and staff. 
As the gentleman knows, we have a 
number of must-pass bills that I have 
just mentioned. I think I did not men-
tion the surface transportation bill, 
but I did mention WRDA. As commit-
tees begin consideration of these bills, 
I will be in touch with Members about 
when they will be scheduled. 
Beyond May 27 and May 28, I want all 
Members to know that they will be 
given 72 hours’ notice of when they 
would need to be returning to Wash-
ington, D.C., for any additional votes. 
I would simply say one of the reasons 
that we are not meeting next week, we 
are going to give the staff, not only of 
the committees but of the House, the 
opportunity to determine exactly how 
the new rules can be carried out—not 
in any way to adversely affect either 
our Republican side of the aisle or the 
Democratic side of the aisle—and to re-
flect accurately the votes of Members, 
whether they are able to get to Wash-
ington during this pandemic or not. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), 
my friend. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
A couple of questions, but first, I 
want to ask: It is my understanding 
that on May 19, next week, we are sup-
posed to be swearing in the new Mem-
bers of Congress who were elected this 
week. You didn’t mention that. Is that 
still going to move forward here on the 
House floor? 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
apologize for not mentioning that. 
There will be pro forma sessions, and 
at the pro forma session on Tuesday, 
we will swear in the two new Members. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for that clarifica-
tion. 
Obviously, we had a full debate on 
the floor today about this change in 
the proxy voting. There still were 
many constitutional questions raised, 
especially as it relates to Article I, 
Section 5, which states that a majority 
of 
each 
House 
shall 
constitute 
a 
quorum. I would hope, although the 
rule is clearly passed and your side was 
able to pass that, doesn’t mean it needs 
to be exercised because the Senate is 
going to be in next week. 
Because we proved today that we can 
come back safely and conduct our busi-
ness, I would just hope and urge that 
while it is now an opportunity, an op-
tion for the majority to use that, we 
still would continue to do business 
with a majority of Members being 
present. Because if a major piece of 
legislation were to come to this floor 
and to pass with a proxy—meaning 20 
people holding proxies, clearly, under 
your bill, would be what your side 
would claim to be a majority—it would 
be challenged. It definitely would be el-
igible for being challenged in court 
under Article I, Section 5, the constitu-
tional requirement of a quorum. 
I would just hope that would be con-
sidered that, while it is there in the 
rule now, doesn’t mean it has to be the 
way the House conducts business. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time, the gentleman is 
correct. We expect a good turnout of 
Members on both sides of the aisle to 
be in the Chamber when we meet. We 
do know, however, there are Members 
who, for health reasons—either their 
own health or the health of one of their 
family 
members—transportation 
issues, as you know, are more difficult 
now with the pandemic going on, but 
our expectation is there will be a good 
number of Members. 
We do not expect there to be 20 Mem-
bers here. We expect there to be many 
more. And as the gentleman knows, 
when asked to come to the House to 
pass critically important legislation, 
Members on both sides of the aisle have 
been here in large numbers. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
think today our total number of Mem-
bers that showed up, out of 435, were 
406. Of course, we didn’t have the full 
435. We will have a few more sworn in 
next week. But with over 400 Members 
of Congress able to get here safely to 
do our business—and again, we know 
the Senate is going to be in next week; 
we know the President is at the White 
House working, as well, with his 
team—I would just hope that we would 
continue to lead by example as we are 
encouraging others to safely reopen. 
My home State of Louisiana today 
started entering into phase 1 of the re-
opening of our economy, and we saw so 
many new establishments. Of course, 
we have got our frontline workers, hos-
pitals, and grocery stores that have al-
ready been opened and other establish-
ments, but today we were able to have 
a full entering of phase 1, and from all 
accounts, it went very smoothly. 
I know the gentleman’s State of 
Maryland is doing the same thing, and 
36 different States are already entering 
phase 1 of reopening. I would just hope 
that we would lead by example by 
showing here in the House that we, too, 
can do the people’s business safely in 
person. 
And do we know when that next time 
that the House would be convening? If 
it is not going to be next week, do we 
have a date when? 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I would 
tell the gentleman, May 27 and 28. 
Mr. SCALISE. And is there any for-
mal legislation or even committee 
hearings? 
Mr. HOYER. I have already said, but 
I will repeat it. 
We will be considering FISA legisla-
tion, I believe, on May 27, and we will 
be considering other COVID–19-related 
bills, if they are ready. 
We have not specifically identified 
those bills, but on May 27 and 28, we 
will be meeting 2 days on that week. It 
is, as you know, Memorial Day on Mon-
day of that week. 
Mr. SCALISE. And then for commit-
tees like Armed Services that are going 
to be, hopefully, starting their negotia-
tions on the National Defense Author-
ization Act, obviously, those are things 
that have an opportunity to be bipar-
tisan. Hopefully, they will be bipar-
tisan. Historically, they have been. 
And that would be, hopefully, some 
more work that the House would do 
here in Washington, here at the Cap-
itol. 
And we would just push to make sure 
that that is the case, that we do as 
much of our work here, not remotely, 
not through Zoom and Skype and 
Webex and other things, but actually 
here in the Capitol where we can, 
again, show the country, as we are ask-
ing them to safely reopen and start 
getting our economy back on track, 
that we would do the same thing. 
Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, 
what I think, Mr. Whip, is that we are 
showing that we intend to do our work 
and we intended to do it with concern 
for the safety of our Members, with the 
safety of our staff, the safety of wit-
nesses who appear before our commit-
tees, and the safety of committee 
members as they proceed. 
I will tell you that Mr. SMITH and I 
had a discussion, as I said a little ear-
lier, and he is going to be talking to his 
ranking member. I expect them to have 
a markup, and I expect that markup to 
be in person. 
Mr. SCALISE. I would just share the 
gentleman’s hope that that happens. I 
know there was a lot of concern ex-
pressed with the resolution that au-
thorized pro forma sessions until July 
21, and I sure hope that is not the ap-
proach that the House would be taking, 
that instead of pro forma, we would ac-
tually be here in person doing the work 
of the people. 
Mr. HOYER. We are in session now, 
of course, and I expect us to be in ses-
sion on May 27 and 28. I expect, in the 
interim, committees will be consid-
ering legislation so that we will have 
product to do. 
We are behind schedule. I still want 
to accomplish much of the work that 
we need to do as a regular order of 
business in the near term. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman.

REMOTE VOTING BY PROXY REGU-
LATIONS PURSUANT TO HOUSE 
RESOLUTION 
965, 
116TH 
CON-
GRESS 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, May 15, 2020. 
MADAM SPEAKER; Pursuant to Section 6 of 
House Resolution 965, 116th Congress, I here-
by submit the following regulations regard-
ing remote voting by proxy for printing in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, Committee on Rules. 
REMOTE VOTING BY PROXY REGULATIONS 
PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 965 
A. Proxy Designation Letter 
1. A Member seeking to vote remotely by 
proxy must submit to the Clerk a dated and 
signed letter authorizing another Member to 
serve as their proxy. The letter must be sub-
mitted before the beginning of the first vote 
in which the Member wishes to vote by 
proxy, and must include: 
i. An affirmative statement that because of 
the public health emergency the Member is 
unable to physically attend proceedings in 
the House Chamber and is granting author-
ity to have their vote cast by proxy. 
ii. The name and state of the Member who 
is being designated as a proxy. 
iii. The original signature of the Member 
granting the proxy. Auto-pen or stamped sig-
natures will not satisfy this signature re-
quirement. 
2. A letter missing any of the items in 
paragraph 1 shall not be verified by the Clerk 
pursuant to regulation B.3, which will result 
in the proxy being unable to vote on the 
Member’s behalf. 
B. Submission of Proxy Designation Letter 
to Clerk 
1. Before submitting a letter designating a 
proxy, Members must confirm with their des-
ignated proxy that he or she agrees to and is 
able to vote for them. 
2. To ensure the Clerk receives the letter 
in a timely manner, a Member seeking to 
vote by proxy should scan and email the let-
ter to the Clerk from a House-maintained 
email account. Such electronic copy shall be 
actionable by the Clerk, including if, despite 
best efforts, the physical original is lost or 
damaged. 
3. Upon electronic receipt of any letter de-
scribed in these regulations, the Clerk must 
verify the letter and send a confirmation of 
receipt via email. A Member seeking to vote 
by proxy must then send the dated and 
signed hard copy of the letter to the Clerk so 
that it may be kept as a record. The Clerk, 
in concurrence with the Chair of the Com-
mittee on House Administration, may im-
pose additional security requirements with 
respect to the electronic submission of proxy 
letters. 
4. The Clerk must make any letter received 
pursuant to these regulations available on a 
publicly accessible website as quickly as 
practicable upon verification of the letter. 
5. The letter will be used by the Clerk to 
certify that a Member serving as a proxy has 
the authority to cast votes on behalf of the 
Member voting remotely by proxy. 
C. Duty of the Proxy 
1. A Member serving as a proxy must agree 
to and be able to appear in the Capitol for 
roll call votes at any time for the duration of 
the covered period. If they are unwilling or 
unable to perform this duty at any point, 
they must inform the Member for whom they 
are voting by proxy as quickly as possible. 
2. Before a Member’s presence may be re-
corded by proxy during a quorum call, the 
Member serving as a proxy must have exact 
instruction pursuant to regulation C.6 from 
the Member voting by proxy on whether they 
intend to be recorded as present, and must 
follow such instruction in responding to the 
quorum call. 
3. Before a vote may be cast by proxy, the 
Member serving as a proxy must have exact 
instruction pursuant to regulation C.6 from 
the Member voting by proxy on whether they 
intend to vote yea, nay, or present on the 
specific text or matter at hand, and must fol-
low such instruction exactly in casting the 
proxy vote. 
4. If the text of a measure changes after 
such instruction is received, the Member 
serving as a proxy may not cast a vote for 
the Member voting by proxy until new in-
struction is received. 
5. If an identical motion is made to a mo-
tion on which a Member voting by proxy has 
previously given instruction, the Member 
serving as a proxy must still receive voting 
instructions pursuant to regulation C.6 on 
the new motion in order to cast the proxy 
vote. 
6. The Member voting by proxy must pro-
vide written voting instruction (which may 
be in electronic form) to the Member serving 
as proxy. Members shall use official devices 
and accounts to transmit such instruction to 
the maximum extent practicable. If they are 
unable to transmit written instruction in a 
timely manner, a member of their staff may 
transmit the instruction at the direction of 
the Member, and that Member must confirm 
the instruction by telephone to the Member 
serving as proxy before the vote may be cast 
on their behalf. 
D. Alteration or Revocation of Proxy 
1. At any time during the public health 
emergency, a Member is permitted to change 
their designated proxy. 
i. In addition to including all the informa-
tion required by regulation A, a letter 
changing a Member’s proxy must clearly 
state that the signing Member seeks to 
change their proxy from the Member cur-
rently holding their proxy to a different 
Member who will hold their proxy starting 
on the date specified in the letter. 
ii. Any such letter must be submitted fol-
lowing the directions provided for the Proxy 
Designation Letter in regulation B. 
2. A Member may revoke their proxy at 
any time for any reason. Revocation of proxy 
does not prohibit a Member from designating 
a proxy at a later time. 
i. A Member seeking to revoke their proxy 
must send to the Clerk a signed letter revok-
ing their proxy which includes the date upon 
which their proxy is revoked. This letter 
must be submitted following the directions 
provided for the Proxy Designation Letter in 
regulation B. 
ii. Pursuant to section 2(a)(2)(B) of House 
Resolution 965, a Member will be considered 
to have revoked their proxy if they vote or 
record their own presence in the House 
Chamber. 
E. Timing of Votes 
1. The Majority Leader must provide Mem-
bers with 24-hours’ notice before any vote on 
the final disposition of bills or joint resolu-
tions conducted during the period designated 
by the Speaker pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 965.

resolution. Proceedings may be streamed on 
a reasonably short delay if necessary for 
technical reasons. 
2. Any text based or private messaging 
function in the software platform used for 
virtual proceedings must be disabled unless 
it is used to provide technical or logistical 
support to members, witnesses, or staff, 
which may be excluded from the public video 
stream and will not be considered a com-
mittee record. 
3. When providing notice of a remote pro-
ceeding, chairs must also provide notice of 
the software platform to be used for partici-
pation. Notice of such software platform con-
stitutes proper notice of a ‘‘place’’ for pur-
poses of section 4(a)(6) of House Resolution 
965. 
4. Members must have the opportunity to 
participate in a non-public rehearsal on the 
committee’s chosen software platform prior 
to the first remote full committee hearing, 
prior to the first remotely-attended full 
committee markup, and prior to the first re-
mote deposition held using that platform, 
and members shall be given reasonable no-
tice (no less than 48 hours) regarding the 
timing of any such rehearsal. Subcommittee 
chairs are encouraged to provide the same 
non-public rehearsal opportunities to sub-
committees. 
5. Members participating remotely must be 
provided access to technical support via tele-
phone throughout any proceeding. 
6. Only members, witnesses, temporarily 
designated participating staff, and necessary 
support staff may have participatory access 
on the software platform, meaning access 
which enables an individual to speak and be 
seen, as opposed to simply viewing the pro-
ceeding. 
7. The committee majority staff, in con-
sultation with the committee minority staff, 
must prepare a list of individuals with 
participatory access on the software plat-
form and share the list with members at 
least 24 hours prior to any proceeding, to the 
greatest extent practicable. 
8. Official reporters should be given direct 
access to the platform itself rather than the 
livestream. 
9. Members of the press and the public may 
view remote proceedings via the committee 
website, as outlined in regulation B.1. 
10. Committees must conduct remote pro-
ceedings using software platforms certified 
by the Chief Administrative Officer. The 
Chief Administrative Officer should inform 
committees, including the ranking minority 
members, each time a software platform is 
certified. 
11. To the greatest extent practicable, the 
software platform used for remote pro-
ceedings must enable participants to view 
proceedings in a ‘‘grid view’’ format. 
12. Committee chairs should inform the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on House Administration of any 
impactful technical issues arising from con-
ducting proceedings remotely. 
C. Deliberations 
1. Committee chairs must allow members 
participating remotely reasonable latitude 
when they are seeking recognition for mo-
tions, points of order, or any other proce-
dures where timeliness is a factor in the 
event that there are problems with tech-
nology such as lag or having the microphone 
muted. 
2. Members participating remotely must 
seek recognition verbally. It is the responsi-
bility of the member seeking recognition to 
unmute their microphone prior to speaking. 
3. No one may unmute a member’s micro-
phone absent an explicit request from the 
member, which may be via another channel. 
4. The chair or an individual designated by 
the chair may mute participants’ micro-
phones when they are not under recognition 
for the purposes of eliminating inadvertent 
background noise. This policy must be car-
ried out uniformly and should be announced 
at the outset of the proceeding. Members 
should have a clear understanding of the 
need to unmute their microphone each time 
they wish to speak. 
D. Decorum 
1. Member microphones may not be muted 
for the purposes of enforcing decorum. 
2. Members participating remotely must 
conform to the same standards for proper at-
tire as are required to participate in a com-
mittee proceeding in person. 
3. Members and witnesses participating re-
motely should appear before a nonpolitical, 
professionally appropriate background that 
is minimally distracting to other members 
and witnesses, to the greatest extent pos-
sible. 
4. Members are expected to follow proper 
decorum with respect to the display of exhib-
its when participating remotely and should 
refrain from displaying an exhibit when not 
under recognition. 
E. Committee Process 
1. For purposes of section 4(b) of House 
Resolution 965, committees will be consid-
ered to have met the requirements for con-
ducting a meeting if they have held at least 
two hearings with remote participation and 
if they have completed a non-public business 
meeting rehearsal pursuant to regulation 
B.4. One such hearing must be at the full 
committee level, and the other hearing may 
be at the subcommittee or full committee 
level. 
2. Committee chairs shall respect mem-
bers’ disparate time zones when scheduling 
committee proceedings. 
3. Committees shall provide an electronic 
repository, which may be an email inbox, for 
the submission of motions, amendments, and 
other documents pursuant to section 4(c)(3) 
of House Resolution 965 and shall notify 
members regarding how to properly submit 
documents electronically before and during a 
committee proceeding. 
4. Pursuant to section 4(c)(5) of House Res-
olution 965, in determining the order in 
which amendments to a measure or matter 
pending before a committee will be consid-
ered in a proceeding with remote partici-
pants, the chair may give priority to amend-
ments, otherwise in order, that have been 
filed with the committee through the elec-
tronic repository at least 4 hours prior to the 
business meeting on said measure or matter. 
5. Within 24 hours of declaring a recess pur-
suant to section 4(c)(2) of House Resolution 
965 the chair shall notify members of the cir-
cumstances which required the recess to be 
declared. 
6. Committees shall facilitate the mainte-
nance of electronically-submitted documents 
as part of any committee record maintained 
pursuant to clause 2(e)(l) of rule XI. 
F. Committee Reports 
1. Committee reports shall be filed in a sin-
gle comprehensive submission including: (1) 
the report as a single electronic document; 
(2) the electronic files comprising such docu-
ment; and (3) an electronic file containing 
the reported measure. Such committee re-
ports shall not be officially processed unless 
all requirements are met, and properly filed 
reports shall be processed in the form sub-
mitted. 
2. Committee reports filed electronically 
remain subject to all House rules regarding 
such reports to the extent consistent with 
House Resolution 965. 
3. Except for reports submitted after the 
receipt of separate views pursuant to clause 
2(c) of rule XIII, committee reports filed 
electronically will be officially processed 
only when the House is in session. Commit-
tees must provide reasonable notice to the 
Clerk when the House is out of session prior 
to filing a report electronically upon receiv-
ing all separate views pursuant to clause 2(c) 
of rule XIII. 
4. Committees shall consult with the Clerk 
regarding the appropriate manner in which 
to submit reports electronically pursuant to 
House Resolution 965. 
5. Any committee report of activities sub-
mitted pursuant to clause l(d)(l) of rule XI

ducted with remote participation. 
G. Witnesses 
1. Pursuant to section 4(c)(6) of House Res-
olution 965, witness counsel should be al-
lowed access on the remote proceeding soft-
ware platform if they are not in the physical 
presence of the witness. It is recommended 
that counsel facilitate a separate secure line 
of communication with the witness. A wit-
ness may not be unmuted by any other indi-
vidual and should be allowed to use such se-
cure line of communication while testifying 
to confer with counsel. 
2. A witness may not allow an individual 
not invited to testify to speak on the plat-
form when the witness is testifying re-
motely. A committee chair may provide ex-
ceptions on occasions where other individ-
uals are necessary to facilitate the witness 
participation in the hearing (e.g. trans-
lators). 
H. Depositions 
1. Depositions conducted remotely shall 
continue to be subject to regulations, includ-
ing supplemental regulations, submitted by 
the chair of the Committee on Rules pursu-
ant to section 103(a)(2) of House Resolution 6.

FOOD ALLERGY AWARENESS 
WEEK 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, this is a 
special week for the more than 32 million 
Americans living with potentially life-threat-
ening food allergies. Food Allergy Awareness 
Week, May 10 through 16, is dedicated to 
raising awareness about the challenges our 
food allergy families and friends face each and 
every day. 
Of course, this year’s Food Allergy Aware-
ness Week comes at a critical time. Our coun-
try is grappling with its greatest public health 
threat in over a century. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has made life even more challenging 
for most Americans, including our food allergy 
families. The New York Times recently re-
ported on the lack of safe, healthy, and afford-
able food choices for allergic families. In addi-
tion, CNBC reported that the threat of con-
tracting the corona virus is keeping people 
away from visiting emergency rooms. In ordi-
nary times, a food allergy reaction sends one 
person in the U.S. to the emergency room 
every three minutes. During the pandemic, 
food allergy families have needed to change 
the way they prepare for emergency care re-
lated to anaphylaxis. 
Individuals and families with food allergies 
are resilient, and I have long been inspired by 
their courage to navigate life’s challenges. 
That’s why I have been working for the past 
year with FARE (Food Allergy Research & 
Education), the world’s leading food allergy 
advocacy organization, to improve the quality 
of life for the more than 1.5 million Americans 
allergic to sesame. 
Sesame is a common ingredient and is 
found in food like bread, cookies, and pizza 
dough. But many people don’t know that it is 
also found in other items such as candy corn, 
ice cream, and sushi. 
Sesame’s widespread use is why those al-
lergic to it desperately need to know what 
foods it is found in so they can avoid this in-
gredient. Unfortunately, that information does 
not exist. Currently, sesame is often labeled 
as a ‘‘natural flavor’’ or as a ‘‘spice’’ on the in-
gredients label leaving millions of Americans 
unable to make smart and healthy food deci-
sions to protect themselves or their family 
members. 
Thankfully, there is hope. Last year, I wrote 
and introduced the Food Allergy Safety, Treat-
ment, Education, and Research (FASTER) 
Act, H.R. 2117 that would require sesame be 
added to the list of allergens that must be la-
beled. It would join other common allergens 
like milk, eggs, and peanuts that are already 
labeled. The FASTER Act is the first meaning-
ful food allergy legislation at the federal level 
in more than a decade and would change the 
lives for millions of Americans. The FASTER 
Act is a bipartisan solution that provides food 
allergy families with the life-saving information 
they need. 
I am proud to fight for food allergy families 
and during this year’s Food Allergy Awareness 
Week, I urge my colleagues to join with me in 
support of the more than 32 million Americans 
affected by life-threatening food allergies.

HONORING THE CAREER OF CIR-
CUIT 
COURT 
JUDGE 
ANDREW 
HOWORTH 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to commemorate the outstanding 
career of Judge Andrew Howorth. Mr. Howorth 
chose to create his first Facebook post to an-
nounce to friends and family his plans on retir-
ing as of June this year. In his nearly two dec-
ades on the bench, Mr. Howorth has honor-
ably served the state of Mississippi and the 
people of the Oxford-Lafayette County in his 
commitment to both his career and the well- 
being of North Mississippi. 
Mr. Howorth best described his dedication 
to public service in this way: ‘‘This is an op-
portunity . . . to work to preserve the integrity 
of the judicial system as is the responsibility of 
every judge. The part I’m most looking forward 
to is meeting and working with new people.’’ 
Mr. Howorth is not only an example of judicial 
leadership but embodies a commitment to his 
community that is nothing short of admirable. 
He has served on the Mississippi Drug Court 
Advisory committee and is a Mississippi Bar 
Foundation fellow. He is an active member of 
the Oxford Rotary Club, has served on the 
Oxford Housing Authority and the Oxford-La-
fayette County United Way. Last year, he was 
honored as the county Chamber of Commerce 
Citizen of the Year, and I cannot think of an 
award that better suits Mr. Howorth. 
In his retirement, Mr. Howorth plans to 
spend time on his farm in Abbeville with his 
wife, Elizabeth. They have an extensive buck-
et list they intend on checking off, and I wish 
them the best in this treasured season of life. 
I commend Judge Howorth for his admirable 
service to the state of Mississippi and his 
commitment to advocating for justice. Whom-
ever is to be appointed by the Governor has 
a substantial legacy to live up to.

THE WUHAN VIRUS WEB OF LIES 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as a former journalist myself, it is 
sad the mainstream media is so biased due to 
Trump Derangement Syndrome of mindless 
hatred. There is unlimited U.S. fake news, the 
Chinese Communist Party is relentless with 
propaganda, Russia blogs sow absurd dis-
content, Iranian zealots flat out lie, but in the 
midst of this madness it should be gratefully 
recognized there are rare beacons of truth as 
evidenced on March 19th with The Epoch 
Times editorial The Web of Lies Spun Around 
the CCP Virus. 
It is especially noteworthy what was cor-
rectly opined months ago is still rarely true 
today. It is so important and correct it should 
be worthy of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for 
the American people to know today and histo-
rians in the future. I include in the RECORD a 
piece authored by Heng He, a commentator 
on Sound of Hope Radio, a China analyst for 
NTD and a writer for The Epoch Times news-
paper. 
‘‘THE WEB OF LIES SPUN AROUND THE CCP 
VIRUS’’ 
The world can learn much by paying atten-
tion to how the outbreak of the CCP virus— 
commnonly 
known 
as 
the 
novel 
coronavirus—has been handled in China. 
There were at least two well-known doc-
tors at Wuhan Central Hospital during the 
outbreak, the whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang 
and whistle-provider Dr. Ai Fen. 
Ai is the emergency room director who saw 
a SARS coronavirus-positive test report for 
a patient on Dec. 30, 2019, and sent the report 
to a friend. The report immediately cir-
culated in a circle of eight doctors that in-
cluded Li. 
The reaction was almost instantaneous. At 
10:20 p.m., the hospital sent a message con-
veying a Wuhan Health Commission notice 
that anything about the ‘‘unknown pneu-
monia’’ shouldn’t be made public. One hour 
later, the hospital sent another, similar no-
tice. Then, on Jan. 2, Ai was called to the 
hospital office and was rebuked by a hospital 
official, who also conveyed orders from high-
er authorities. Ai didn’t talk about the virus 
afterward, not even to her husband, until 
Jan. 20. 
Li and seven other doctors who were con-
sidered whistleblowers got more serious pun-
ishment. They also were censured, and not 
by hospital officials, but by police on Jan. 3. 
The censorship effort turned out to be very 
successful; all of the doctors who knew about 
the outbreak kept silent. 
Meanwhile, the rest of China and the world 
were kept in the dark for at least another 20 
days. 
The coverup and censorship had begun be-
fore Ai shared the test report. Wuhan Cen-
tral Hospital sent out the first ‘‘unknown 
pneumonia’’ patient sample on Dec. 24, 2019. 
The report, which the hospital received Dec. 
27, indicated that a coronavirus was found in 
the sample, with 70 percent similarity to 
SARS coronavirus. A report from a second 
test facility stated simply, ‘‘SARS.’’ Both fa-
cilities were private companies. 
The hospital reported the results to the 
Wuhan Health Commission the same day, 
which means that Wuhan officials knew of 
the disease three days earlier than Ai. While 
the Wuhan Health Commission can directly 
order the hospital to silence doctors, only 
administrative officials can order the police 
to punish whistleblowers. 
The coverup was already at the city gov-
ernment level as early as Jan. 3.

May 15, 2020 
Other organizations also covered up the 
outbreak. On Jan. 1, the Hubei Provincial 
Health Commission notified gene-sequencing 
companies not to take the Wuhan pneumonia 
samples, not to test the samples, not to sub-
mit scientific papers, and not to reveal the 
results to the public. It also was ordered that 
all samples must be destroyed. 
On Jan. 3, the National Health Commission 
formally banned all non-governmental facili-
ties from testing samples related to the 
Wuhan pneumonia case, which the Beijing fi-
nancial magazine Caixin recounted, in the 
report ‘‘Tracing the Novel Coronavirus Gene 
Sequencing: When Did the Alarm Sound.’’ 
The Caixin article was taken down several 
hours after being published. 
HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION 
An esteemed, senior doctor named Zhong 
Nanshan was used to manage part of another 
coverup. Zhong went to Wuhan on Jan. 19. 
Before he left Wuhan to go to Beijing the 
next day, he announced that the virus was 
capable of human-to-human transmission, 
which authorities at different levels had de-
nied. 
Before Zhong, two groups of experts had 
been sent to Wuhan by the Chinese Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention (China 
CDC). Why is it that Zhong would find some-
thing within one day while so many experts 
visiting Wuhan couldn’t? Caijing, another 
Beijing-based 
financial 
magazine, 
inter-
viewed an expert from the second group, and 
asked those in the group whether hospital 
staff had been infected—the key evidence for 
human-to-human transmission. The experts 
never got an answer. 
Zhong had earned a good reputation for 
fighting SARS and is the leading Chinese of-
ficial for fighting respiratory infectious dis-
eases. An outsider to Wuhan, he hadn’t been 
involved in the previous coverup. He had the 
authority to change the status of the epi-
demic disease, and could change the tone 
without exposing government wrongdoing. 
Zhong, then, was just another tool of the 
Party. During this outbreak, even partial 
‘‘truth’’ from the CCP becomes part of the 
lies. 
From day one, every Party and govern-
ment organization—and the hospitals and in-
dividuals inside the system—has been in-
volved in weaving a web of lies. Anyone who 
intentionally or unintentionally exposed the 
lies was immediately silenced, by different 
organizations, at different levels, and by dif-
ferent authorities. 
‘DISASTERS MAKE THE NATION STRONG’ 
The CCP’s institutions are designed for 
keeping its power, not for preventing and 
handling natural disasters, especially not for 
something like the novel coronavirus. 
The pattern is usually like this. When a 
large-scale natural disaster such as an earth-
quake or flood occurs, the CCP doesn’t need 
to do much for the victims and survivors. 
Digging up survivors is for taking photos or 
videos—saving lives is the least concern. 
During the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, 
classrooms collapsed, killing schoolchildren, 
while government buildings remained stand-
ing. But officials were never held account-
able for the corruption that caused the shod-
dy school construction. The CCP’s ‘‘solu-
tion’’ was to jail parents and activists who 
sought the truth and justice. 
In fighting disasters, the most important 
work is to brag about how great the CCP is. 
The people can only see the gratitude of the 
survivors to the Party, the red-flag-waving 
rescue teams, the award and victory celebra-
tion ceremonies, and other similar actions. 
As time goes by, people who have no direct 
experience of the suffering can only remem-
ber—the propaganda, while totally forget-
ting the victims and the officials responsible 
for the disaster. 
This pattern is captured in the CCP slogan, 
‘‘disasters make the nation strong.’’ It might 
be difficult to understand that natural or 
even man-made disasters can be transformed 
into a ‘‘good thing’’ to enhance the CCP’s 
power. After the victims, the survivors, and 
the activists are silenced, CCP can easily 
generate the support of those who haven’t 
suffered personally. 
The disasters don’t make the nation 
strong. They make the CCP strong. 
SCAPEGOATS 
During this virus outbreak, the CCP has 
gone even further. ‘‘Disasters make the na-
tion strong’’ has become ‘‘CCP saves the 
world.’’ The CCP has claimed that China 
bought time for the world, a boast that has 
been echoed by some Western media. 
But if the CCP didn’t cover things up, 
there was not need to ‘‘buy time.’’ The CCP 
is very good at allowing a small problem to 
grow, then using all resources to fight the 
‘‘big problem.’’ People see the CCP fighting 
the big problem so efficiently that they tend 
to forget the problem was originally created 
by the CCP. This is part of the Party’s infor-
mation war. 
From the beginning, Chinese authorities 
have sought to pass the blame for the out-
break. The first scapegoat was Huanan Sea-
food Market (HSM). HSM was formally men-
tioned as the source by Chinese authorities 
on Dec. 30, 2019, on Jan. 11 by the Wuhan 
Health Commission, and on Jan. 22 by Gao 
Fu, the director of China CDC. 
However, three papers, including two from 
Lancet and one from the New England Jour-
nal of Medicine, and all by Chinese doctors 
and scientists, published between Jan. 24 and 
30, tell a different story. 
In the first 41 cases, 13 of then had no HSM 
contact history, and the first case, and two 
of three subsequent cases, had no HSM his-
tory. Since those cases were all confirmed 
before Jan. 11, the Wuhan Health Commis-
sion was aware that HSM could only be the 
first cluster, and not the original source. De-
nial of human-to-human transmission is one 
thing, while intentionally misleading about 
the origin of the disease is a totally different 
issue. What did they want to hide? 
The second scapegoat is the pangolin, the 
odd mammal with scales whose meat is con-
sidered a delicacy. On Feb. 7, a research 
group at South China Agriculture University 
announced that they had found a virus in the 
pangolin that has a 99 percent similarity to 
the coronavirus causing the Wuhan pneu-
monia. 
However, one of the researchers, Shen 
Yongyi, pointed out in an interview with 
Nanfang Daily that the pangolin sample 
wasn’t from the university’s collection but 
from a certain specific government unit. 
Shen said that under heavy pressure, results 
were revealed to the public, rather than pub-
lishing them in a scientific journal first. 
Since these two scapegoats didn’t work 
well, the United States has become the new 
target. 
Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson for the For-
eign Ministry Department, has claimed that 
a 
U.S. 
military 
team 
brought 
the 
coronavirus to Wuhan. This was not Zhao’s 
personal mistake. Before Zhao’s accusation, 
the SARS-fighting Dr. Zhong said that be-
cause the coronavirus outbreak appeared in 
China doesn’t mean it originated in China. 
Since then, Zhao’s accusation and similar 
finger-pointing have flooded China’s social 
media. 
If the HSM and pangolin were put forward 
to find someone, anyone, to blame, out of a 
spontaneous response, the decision to point 
at the United States is an equally well-or-
chestrated strategy from the top circle of 
the leadership. Why does the CCP want to do 
something so obviously wrong that nobody 
around the world would believe? The CCP is 
trying to turn the coronavirus controversy 
to its advantage, especially in China. 
What else could be more effective and con-
venient than blaming the United States? The 
United States has been the No. 1 scapegoat 
for all the CCP’s own problems for the past 
70 years. 
Did the CCP lie about the Wuhan outbreak 
at the early stage? Yes. Is the CCP still lying 
now? No doubt. Will the CCP lie in the fu-
ture? Definitely. What should we do? Don’t 
trust anything from the CCP. That’s what 
Taiwan has been doing, and doing so well. 
During the SARS outbreak in 2003, Taiwan 
was abandoned by the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO), which favors the CCP. Facing 
the coronavirus, Taiwan can only rely on 
itself. The most important lesson the rest of 
the world can learn from Taiwan is not to 
trust the CCP or WHO. 
While some countries believe that Taiwan 
should be accepted by WHO, it turns out that 
it’s not Taiwan that needs WHO, but the 
whole world needs Taiwan. 
The Epoch Times refers to the novel 
coronavirus, 
which 
causes 
the 
disease 
COVID–19, as the CCP virus because the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s coverup and mis-
management allowed the virus to spread 
throughout China and create a global pan-
demic.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
MORRIS HOOD, III 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the memory of the late former-Michigan 
State Legislator Morris Hood, III, whose life 
was tragically cut short by COVID–19. 
Morris Hood was born and raised in Detroit. 
His roots ran deep in Detroit and Wayne 
County. Mr. Hood was elected to Michigan’s 
House of Representatives, where he served 
the maximum three terms before he went on 
to be elected to Michigan’s State Senate, 
where he served the maximum two terms. He 
cared deeply for the people he represented 
and prioritized his time connecting with them, 
whether it was hosting meetings about impor-
tant issues or attending community gatherings. 
His easygoing nature and innate leadership 
abilities afforded him respect from his col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle. Morris 
Hood leaves a legacy of advocacy for policy 
initiatives to uplift the communities he served. 
He was a champion for education and re-
mained committed to improving our public 
schools. 
Morris Hood was a true public servant and 
more than that, a friend. Please join me in 
honoring his legacy.

CONGRATULATING CYNTHIA WIL-
LIAMS AND THE AUSTIN PEO-
PLES ACTION CENTER ON ITS 
40TH YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, May 10th marked the 40th Year An-
niversary of the Austin Peoples Action Center 
which was organized by a teenager/young 
adult, her parents and members of the Third 
Unitarian Church of Chicago in the Austin 
Community. Austin at the time was the largest 
community area in the City of Chicago and 
was still under-going a serious population 
change from being predominately white to be-
coming majority black. There was wholesale 
migration, racial animosity, blockbusting, panic 
peddling and mistrust. Cynthia Williams, a 
feisty teenage/young adult emerged as a lead-
er of a group and the Austin Peoples Action 
Center was born, with support of the Williams 
family, the Mayfield Block Club and the Third 
Unitarian Church. The group took off with 
neighborhood programs, help for teenagers, 
block club organizing and other self-help ac-
tivities, e.g. community festivals and the Taste 
of Austin which has occurred for more than 
thirty-five years in succession. Help for teen-
agers and young adults has evolved into Ma-
ternal and Child Health Programs and the 
largest WIC Program in the State of Illinois, 
Parenting Skills Development, Technology 
Training and other activities for youth. 
I take this opportunity to commend and con-
gratulate Ms. Cynthia Williams and the Austin 
Peoples Action Center on 40 Years of Produc-
tive Service.

Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend the life and leg-
acy of the late Gloucester County, New Jersey 
resident Mrs. Lorraine Madden. 
Born in l933, in the mining town Shamokin, 
Pennsylvania. Lorraine Madden was the third

den, Sr. and had two sons, Fred Jr. and 
Thomas. She worked at a local hospital, Bell 
Telephone, Harleco Company, A.E. Price Im-
porters and lastly in human resources for 
Johns Manville. After retirement, Lorraine and 
Fred relocated to Surfside Beach, South Caro-
lina for the next twenty years. After being 
many miles away from their family and friends 
they decided to move back to New Jersey. 
The residents of Gloucester County, New 
Jersey greatly adored and appreciated Mrs. 
Madden. Her passing is a great loss for our 
entire community. She is the beloved wife of 
Fred H. Madden, Sr., devoted mother of the 
Honorable Fred. H. Madden, Jr. (Patricia) and

NORTH AUGUSTA BUSINESSES GET 
CREATIVE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, it was heartwarming that on May 7th, 
during National Small Business Week, The 
Augusta Chronicle identified North Augusta 
businesses, getting creative. As we all work 
together to defeat the Wuhan Virus, it is inspir-
ing to see small businesses working together. 
I include in RECORD the following article de-
veloped by Staff Writer Miguel Legoas. 
With a tent, a couple tables, and a dedi-
cated staff, The Purple Hull restaurant made 
a DIY drive-through that has done so well 
owner Ray Henderson said they may make a 
more permanent version. 
‘‘I think it’s developed some business that 
we didn’t have, so I think we may go and ac-
tually build off the back-end and put us a 
drive through there,’’ he said. 
Henderson said the pandemic dealt a seri-
ous blow to the business, as it has done with 
many other small businesses, which is why 
they had to get creative in order to per-
severe. 
Jenny and Jesse Elliot, of Shoppe313, have 
flexed those same creative muscles with 
their online sales and by creating kits for 
parents so they can build their own teddy 
bears from home. 
Suzanne Fanning, of the Pink Dipper ice 
cream ship, also reiterated Henderson’s 
point, and since re-opening her store has ad-
justed hours, put up a partition between the 
customers and employees, updated their de-
livery service, and has done more with 
curbside pickup. 
‘‘Every day is a learning process being 
open during the pandemic,’’ Fanning said. 
‘‘What we learned and what we’re trying to 
teach our staff is that, in this craziness, 
we’re having to be really flexible. . . (and) 
most customers have been really pretty un-
derstanding of the changes.’’ 
But some of the customers in the North 
Augusta area have done much more than be 
courteous. Parks Pharmacy store manager 
Karen Powell said some customers, in their 
own time and with their own money, sur-
prised the pharmacy with handmade masks 
for the entire staff. 
‘‘It was very touching, it spoke very loudly 
that someone cared,’’ Powell said. 
‘‘We’ve got a little GroupMe chat, we’ve 
got emails shooting back and forth when all 
this was kicking up, the Chamber and North 
Augusta Forward were super, super helpful 
in just educating us all about the resources 
that are available,’’ Fanning said. 
Henderson said they have tried to help 
other businesses, ones that could be consid-
ered competitors. When Wife Saver said it 
would be closing, they offered encourage-
ment and help, and did the same with a near-
by Mexican establishment. They even pro-
vided DeShawn’s Seafood and Chicken Res-
taurant with some much-needed supplies. 
‘‘We all kinda doing our own thing and not 
really focused on each other,’’ Henderson 
said. ‘‘I think it made it where we were more 
willing to open up and say ‘‘Hey, I need your 
help.’’

healthcare, and arts education. In addition to 
these causes, Emmaline has produced several 
original art shows with the aim of raising funds 
for those in her community. Some of her 
shows’ revenue has been used to purchase 
medical supplies for those with ALS or AIDS, 
and some has been used to purchase baby 
clothing and supplies for those facing teenage 
pregnancy. 
Given a $1,000 scholarship and $2,500 to 
donate to the COVID–19 efforts of a nonprofit 
of her choosing, Emmaline stands out as one 
of the most selfless examples of servant-lead-
ership. I take this time to thank her for her 
service to the state we both call home.

RECOGNIZING DR. BERT BRIGHT 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to pay a heartfelt tribute 
to a very special gentleman who has been in-
strumental in the growth and development of 
many lives in eastern North Carolina. Dr. Bert 
Bright has served well in numerous roles at 
Arendell Parrott Academy in Kinston, N.C. for 
the past 25 years. 
Dr. Bright has excelled as a middle school 
science teacher, a Science Olympiad coach— 
taking five teams to top ten finishes nationally, 
a varsity football coach, Assistant Head-
master, and finally, Headmaster. He has been 
a servant leader, a forward thinker, an 
encourager and a friend to students, parents 
and faculty. During his tenure as Headmaster, 
he has overseen multimillion-dollar building 
projects, administered advanced technology 
with campuswide wireless access, instituted 
an after-school program, expanded transpor-
tation services and fervently cheered state 
championship teams in five different sports. 
He expanded a diverse enrollment through 
multi-community outreach. But even more than 
all these achievements, Dr. Bright will be re-
membered most as a caring teacher and lead-
er who saw the potential in every student and 
challenged them to be their best. A nurturing 
administrator who mentored his staff with skill, 
understanding and dedication. 
Parrott Academy enjoys a family atmos-
phere while maintaining a rigorous curriculum, 
competitive athletic programs, and exemplary 
fine arts interwoven with a culture of service. 
Such an environment would not be possible 
without the compassion, extraordinary commit-
ment to excellence in education, model of 
sportsmanship, and servant’s heart of Dr. Bert 
Bright. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing upon his retirement, a true Patriot in 
every sense of the word: Dr. Bert Bright.

CONGRATULATING PETER 
NEWBOULD ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor and congratulate Peter 
Newbould, the Senior Public Policy Manager 
of the Alzheimer’s Association Washington 
State Chapter, on his retirement. 
Peter has had an outstanding career advo-
cating for those affected by Alzheimer’s. In his 
six years at the Alzheimer’s Association he 
guided other advocates in opening a meaning-
ful discussion with Congress about this dis-
ease. Peter spread awareness of Alzheimer’s 
and was a top ten recruiter in the nation for 
the Alzheimer’s Impact Movement. 
Peter was instrumental in advancing public 
policy goals and served on the advocacy sub-
committee of the Dementia Action Collabo-
rative, helping win State appropriations to im-
plement priorities in the 2016 Alzheimer’s 
State Plan. 
Prior to joining the Alzheimer’s Association, 
Peter had an impressive career including 
working for over 13 years in the U.S. House 
of Representatives. In the 1980s, he was 
Chief of Staff to Congressman Jim Florio of 
New Jersey and Congressman RON WYDEN of 
Oregon. He then served for 21 years as Direc-
tor of Congressional & Political Affairs at the 
American Psychological Association, during 
which he co-chaired a coalition that won pas-
sage of two federal laws on mental health par-
ity. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great admiration 
that I recognize and congratulate Peter 
Newbould on his retirement and the incredible 
advocacy work he has done for those facing 
Alzheimer’s.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JANET 
OWENS 
HON. JOHN H. RUTHERFORD 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Janet Owens, an inspi-
rational community leader and advocate, who 
passed away on April 8th after a long battle 
with cancer. Janet was the executive director 
of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation’s 
(LISC) Jacksonville office for 10 years, serving 
as a tireless advocate for residents and com-
munities. Under her leadership, new affordable 
housing was financed, community centers 
were created to improve financial stability, 
playing fields were renovated, and local non-
profit organizations were made stronger. I am 
saddened by her passing, but honored to rec-
ognize her dedication and longtime commit-
ment to the people and neighborhoods that 
Janet fought to improve every day of her life. 
Janet was first and foremost a community 
servant, focused on empowering people and 
organizations as well as equipping them with 
the right information and resources. A signifi-
cant part of her career was spent in public 
service. She worked in city government in 
Greenville, South Carolina; Adrian, Michigan; 
and Washington, D.C. Her service continued 
after leaving government and was extended in 
the private sector where she served as Vice 
President of United Way of Northeast Florida 
and held positions with the Girl Scouts of 
Gateway Council and Volunteer Jacksonville. 
At LISC, Janet was a tremendous driving 
force in advancing the organization’s mission 
to help under-resourced neighborhoods in 
Jacksonville. She believed these neighbor-
hoods were ripe for opportunity and renewal, 
and her leadership ensured that public and 
private resources benefitted those most in 
need. Since its opening in 1999, LISC Jack-
sonville has invested nearly $500 million in the 
community, creating 2,100 affordable homes 
and 1.7 million square feet of space for com-
mercial, community, and educational facilities. 
Most notably, Janet was the driving force be-
hind LISC Jacksonville’s investment in several 
pivotal historic preservation projects in down-
town Jacksonville, including the Barnett Bank 
and Laura Street Trio. 
Janet’s commitment to community develop-
ment extended well beyond her professional 
life. She was involved in a range of volunteer 
activities and was acknowledged for her com-
mitment with numerous awards and accolades 
over the course of her life. In 2019, she was 
the recipient of the University of North Flor-
ida’s OneJax Humanitarian Award, which rec-
ognized her integrity, generosity, and dedica-
tion to improving the relationships among 
Jacksonville’s diverse populations. Leadership 
Jacksonville also acknowledged her as an out-
standing community trustee during its 2018 
Leadership Celebration. The Girl Scouts Gate-
way Council bestowed their Women of Distinc-
tion Award to Janet in honor of her career ac-
complishments, service to others and impact 
on the Northeast Florida community. 
Janet was a true advocate for the under-
served, and her legacy of community service 
will live on through her accomplishments both 
in Florida and nationally. I ask the House of 
Representatives to join me in celebrating her 
life of public service and extend deepest con-
dolences to her mother, Mamie Garrett; her 
beloved husband of thirty-seven years, Greg-
ory Owens; their three children Greg, Garrett 
and Morgan; and her grandchildren, siblings, 
relatives and friends.

South Carolina state officials have left it 
to school districts to plan for graduation 
while taking necessary precautions with so-
cial 
distancing 
to 
stop 
the 
spread 
of 
coronavirus. ‘‘We talked of every possible op-
tion, but never stepped away from our 
foundational desire to keep it safe and keep 
it responsible,’’ Airport High Principal David 
Damm said. 
Groups of graduates and their parents were 
spaced several feet apart as they approached 
the stage. The students took their turns, 
walking across the stage, receiving their di-
ploma case and getting photographs made. 
These images will be put together in a video 
along with speeches by Principal David 
Damm, valedictorian Ashleigh Smith, salu-
tatorian Rose Brandon, Student Body Presi-
dent Katie Kyzer, and Senior Class President 
Geena Rocanella. 
‘‘There’s some element to it that we hope 
is special. . . We are trying to provide the 
graduates with a memory, a video of their 
graduation, but do it in a way that keeps 
people apart and safe,’’ Damm said. 
‘‘I’m just glad to have had a ceremony, 
even if it was small,’’ Julion Brooks said 
after walking across the stage. His parents, 
Shaquana and Lamar Brooks, made photo-
graphs while wearing T-shirts honoring the 
class of 2020—‘‘delayed not denied’’—printed 
across the front. 
At Lexington District 2’s other high 
school, Brookland-Cayce, students will have 
a similar opportunity on May 14. Other ef-
forts to help honor the class of 2020 include 
yard signs, billboards, social media and a 
countywide porch light salute on May 20, at 
8:20 p.m. Virtual graduation ceremonies for 
the two high schools will air online and on 
local television June 6, the Lexington 2 
school district announced this week. 
They will be broadcast together from 5–7 
p.m. June 6 on WACH-Fox 57. They will also 
be available for streaming via STIRR, a free 
TV app. The presentations will be posted on 
the school district’s YouTube channel after 
they have aired.

HONORING OUR OFFICERS DURING 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
HON. GILBERT RAY CISNEROS, JR. 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, estab-
lished by a joint resolution of Congress in 
1961 and authorized by President John F. 
Kennedy in 1962, National Peace Officers Me-
morial Day was proclaimed on May 15th. The 
proclamation further established the calendar 
week of May 15th as National Police Week. 
National Police Week honors the heroic and 
selfless devotion of our peace officers to our 
country. It is a time to honor those who make 
sacrifices year-round, missing weekends, holi-
days, and family events to serve their commu-
nities. It is also a sacred time as we honor the 
fallen men and women in law enforcement 
who have laid down their lives in the line of 
duty to protect others. 
This week we are humbled by the chal-
lenges they face and the profound sacrifices 
that they make. Despite the daily adversity of-
ficers face, their dedication to protect the rule 
of law and their communities remains unwav-
ering. Even in times of grave danger and un-
certainty, such as the current Covid–19 pan-
demic, our nations’ police officers were some 
of the first to stand ready to serve and protect 
the citizens of their communities. 
The spirit of National Police Week is exem-
plified by those whose actions reflect courage, 
sacrifice, and selflessness. I am honored to 
rise today and recognize several individuals 
who bravely serve the residents of California’s 
39th District. Serving the Cities of Walnut and 
Diamond Bar I’d like to honor Lieutenant 
Tomas Giandomenico, a 30-year veteran of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department 
and 
an 
Army 
Veteran, 
Sergeant 
Paul 
Parkhurst, who has served since 2006, and 
Deputy Jesse Acuna who has served since 
2010. From the Fullerton Police Department, I 
would like to recognize, Sergeant Ryan O’Neil, 
who has served our community since 2008. 
From the Chino Hill’s Sheriffs Station, I would 
like to honor Deputy Ed Hernandez, Deputy 
Eileen Negron, and Deputy Tony Ortega for 
the daily sacrifices that they make to keep our 
citizens safe. 
These deputies have gone above and be-
yond the call of duty. Not only serving their 
community while in uniform, but also using 
their personal time to help those in need. Lieu-
tenant Giandomenico and Deputy Acuna help 
disadvantaged youth in Kenya at the School of 
Angels, a school they founded to provide over 
100 children a safe place to gain educational 
opportunities. Sergeant Parkhurst, a Marine 
combat veteran, helps transitioning veterans 
who are returning from active duty adjust to ci-
vilian life in the Los Angeles Sheriffs Depart-
ments, Vets to Vets program. 
Madam Speaker, I urge you and my other 
distinguished colleagues to join me in com-
mending these heroes: Lieutenant Tomas 
Giandomenico, Sergeant Paul Parkhurst, Ser-
geant Ryan O’Neil, Deputy Jesse Acuna, Dep-
uty Ed Hernandez, Deputy Eileen Negron, 
Deputy Tony Ortega, as well as all law en-
forcement officers, past, and present that 
make our country, and my District such a spe-
cial place.

I rise today to commemorate the outstanding 
career of Ms. Tammy Rogers and congratulate 
her on her retirement from the Lee County 
Board of Supervisors. After nearly three dec-
ades in this seat, Ms. Rogers has served her 
county well and set the precedent of hard 
work and commitment in county government. 
Tammy Rogers first applied as the Lee 
County Board of Supervisors Secretary in 
1989, though this was not the first they had 
heard from her. A coworker recalls her phone 
calls regarding the dilapidated state of a 
bridge near her home. Ms. Rogers commit-
ment to excellence was only solidified by her 
new position in public service. She is known 
for her work-ethic and transparency among 
her coworkers, as well as her dedication to 
forming relationships with each supervisor. It 
is dedication like this that makes North Mis-
sissippi great. 
The decision to retire after 30 years of serv-
ice was a difficult one for Ms. Rogers, how-
ever she will continue with her career at a 
local bank. I respect and admire her commit-
ment to public service for so many years and 
wish her the best in this new chapter of life. 
Her colleague Billy Davis said of Ms. Rog-
ers, ‘‘You can get some more good ones, but 
you won’t get anyone better.’’ I think this com-
ment exemplifies Ms. Rogers impact on her 
community and dedication to service. She will 
continue to be a pillar in her community.

ACADEMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Caleb Wawrzyniak of Sylvania, Ohio has been 
offered an appointment to the United States 
Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo-
rado. 
Caleb’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Air Force Academy 
this fall with the incoming Class of 2024. At-
tending one of our nation’s military academies 
not only offers the opportunity to serve our 
country, but also guarantees a world-class 
education while undertaking one of the most 
challenging and rewarding experiences of their 
lives. 
Caleb brings a tremendous amount of lead-
ership, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2024. While attending St. Francis de 
Sales in Toledo, Ohio, Caleb was an elected 
officer of the Latin American Student Support 
Organization, and member of the campus min-
istry, while maintaining a 3.679 GPA. 
Throughout high school, Caleb was involved 
with football, baseball, wrestling, and track 
among other extracurricular activities. I am 
confident that Caleb will cany the lessons of 
his student and athletic leadership to the Air 
Force Academy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Caleb Wawrzyniak on his 
offer of appointment to the United States Air 
Force Academy. Our service academies offer 
the finest military training and education avail-
able. I am positive that Caleb will excel during 
his career at the Air Force Academy, and I 
ask my colleagues to join me in extending 
their best wishes to him as he begins his serv-
ice to our nation.

As a teenager, his family moved to North 8th 
Street just across from Cliff Hare High School 
where he graduated in 1937. He worked sev-
eral after-school and summer jobs including 
working as a soda jerk at a local pharmacy. 
Always a music lover, Mr. Brown played the 
alto saxophone with a small group of friends 
in town. 
After high school graduation, he attended 
Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API), now 
known as Auburn University. With World War 
II looming, Mr. Brown joined the Air Cadet pro-
gram, but failed the initial physical because he 
didn’t meet the weight requirement. After in-
creasing his dietary intake, he passed the 
physical. He graduated in 1941 with a degree 
in Aeronautical Supervision and was then 
commissioned in the Army Air Corps. 
Mr. Brown was assigned to Cherry Point, 
North Carolina where he learned to fly anti- 
sub patrol as a navigator/bombardier. When 
the U.S. joined the war, his group was sent to 
England as part of the 8th Air Force. He flew 
30 missions in B-24s dropping supplies and 
agents to the French, Belgian and Norwegian 
resistance. He remained in the National Guard 
after the war and retired as a Lieutenant Colo-
nel. 
After returning to Opelika, Mr. Brown 
worked assisting veterans with loans. He met 
his future wife, Barbara Saunders on a blind 
date. They married in October of 1947 and 
were blessed with three daughters: Barbara 
(Bebe) and twin sisters Stephanie and Debbie. 
Mr. Brown has ten grandchildren and ten 
great-grandchildren. 
Mr. Brown worked at the Alabama Gas 
Company and later with Botsford Knight Insur-
ance Agency until his retirement. He was an 
active member of First United Methodist 
Church where he sang in the choir and partici-
pated in the Lumpkin Sunday School Class. 
He has been a member of the Kiwanis Club 
for over 60 years and was a member of the 
Saugahatchee Country Club where he enjoyed 
playing golf and preferred walking to riding in 
a golf cart. He still enjoys watching Auburn 
and SEC sports. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Mr. Brown and wishing him a very 
happy 100th birthday.

INHUMANITY IN AFGHANISTAN 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, on Tuesday May 12th there was an 
inhuman murderous attack by terrorists of a 
100-bed hospital compound in Kabul, Afghani-
stan, which included a maternity ward run by 
aid group Doctors Without Borders. Grue-
somely, the terrorist attack left 16 murdered, 
including mothers, infants, and healthcare 
workers, and 15 others were wounded. Shortly 
thereafter, a cowardly suicide bomber targeted 
a funeral ceremony of a local police com-
mander in Nangahar, leaving at least 24 dead 
and 68 injured. This level of fanaticism under-
scores that we must secure Afghan families or 
the terrorists will again eagerly kill Americans 
as they did on September 11th from a cave in 
Afghanistan. 
Tuesday’s gut-wrenching attacks are unfor-
tunately not an aberration in Afghanistan, as 
terrorists who would like to stifle freedom and 
liberty continue to destabilize the country and 
threaten the democratic trajectory of the Af-
ghan 
government. 
Although 
the 
Afghan 
Taliban have formally denied their participation 
in these attacks, President Ashraf Ghani point-
ed an accusatory finger at the terrorist group 
and called on them to cease and desist. ‘‘I 
once again call on them to embrace peace,’’ 
President Ghani said in an official statement, 
noting that it is ‘‘not only a demand of the gov-
ernment, but the nation and the international 
community.’’ America is grateful for President 
Ghani’s courageous leadership. As Co-Chair-
man of the Afghan Caucus, I especially have 
appreciated meeting with the President in 
Kabul where I found firsthand his devotion to 
the people. 
If the Taliban truly did not participate in 
these heinous attacks, the group should work 
with the Afghan government to bring the mur-
derous perpetrators to justice. 
It is especially tragic that these attacks oc-
curred during the Muslim holy Month of Rama-
dan, a time meant for solemn prayer and 
peace. The people of Afghanistan deserve a 
peaceful future, free from terrorism and death 
that they have been plagued with for far too 
long. 
Americans pray that peace, stability, and se-
curity return to Afghanistan and we stand 
ready to support Afghanistan’s government 
and security services in their efforts to realize 
this dream for prosperity of Afghan families.

TRIBUTE TO MR. LESLIE HERBERT 
WEXNER 
HON. STEVE STIVERS 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of myself and my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives TROY
BALDERSON
and JOYCE 
BEATTY, as well as the people of Central Ohio 
to celebrate the career of one of Ohio’s most 
distinguished citizens, a man who devoted his 
life to building a historic company and to the 
improvement of his community, Mr. Leslie Her-
bert Wexner. 
Born in Dayton, Ohio, Mr. Wexner has lived 
the American Dream. The child of a Russian- 
Jewish immigrant and a first generation Amer-
ican, he attended The Ohio State University 
and served in the Ohio Air National Guard. He 
then got his start in the retail industry working 
at his family’s store, Leslie’s. He used that 
first-hand experience to found The Limited, 
taking the company public on the New York 
Stock Exchange just six years later. 
Since then, he grew L Brands to, at one 
point, include household names such as Vic-
toria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works, Aber-
crombie and Henri Bendel. He has consist-
ently been ranked among the Top 100 Best 
Performing Chief Executive Officers and was 
named the longest-serving CEO of a Fortune 
500 company in 2012. 
His success as an entrepreneur is matched 
only by his extraordinary impact as a philan-
thropist who has made incredible contributions 
to Central Ohio. The Wexner Foundation 
began in order to fill a void in the North Amer-
ican Jewish Community, and has since ex-
panded its mission, with programs including 
the Wexner Service Corps, the Wexner Field 
Fellowship, Wexner Senior Leaders, and 
Wexner Alumni Summits. 
Beyond that, he and his wife, Abigail, have 
empowered individuals throughout Central 
Ohio with their charitable works, including sup-
port for the Columbus Foundation, The Ohio 
State University’s Wexner Medical Center, the 
Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nation-
wide Children’s Hospital, and the Wexner 
Center for the Arts. 
To attempt to quantify Mr. Wexner’s impact 
is impossible. As Mr. Doug Kridler, president 
and chief executive officer of the Columbus 
Foundation once said, ‘‘Les blew the ceiling 
off our sense of the possible in Columbus.’’ 
Mr. Wexner tackled projects large and 
small. From growing his business and pro-
viding thousands of jobs, to supporting devel-
oping leaders and encouraging medical break-
throughs, he has undeniably helped make 
Central Ohio a wonderful place to live, work, 
and raise a family. 
We all have come to know Mr. Wexner for 
his tireless work ethic, and his commitment to 
improving the lives of his neighbors. He has 
done a phenomenal job of building consensus 
and demonstrating the importance of civility in 
the process. His impact will be far-reaching for 
years and years to come, and as he begins 
this next chapter in his life, we are confident 
that our communities will continue to benefit 
from his exemplary leadership. 
It is an honor to recognize his retirement, 
and we ask all of our colleagues to join us in 
congratulating Mr. Les Wexner on an extraor-
dinary career and wishing him and Abigail all 
the best.

HONORING RICHARD L. JACOBS ON 
THE CELEBRATION OF HIS 90TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is my 
privilege to rise today to join the New Haven 
community in extending my heartfelt congratu-
lations and very best wishes to Richard L. Ja-
cobs, Esq., as he celebrates his 90th birthday. 
A New Haven native who has dedicated a life-
time to the pursuit of advocacy and justice, 
this is a remarkable milestone for this pillar of 
our community. 
The Jacobs family’s law practice has been 
an institution in the City of New Haven since 
its founding by Dick’s father, Israel, more than 
a century ago. Following his graduation from 
Yale University and Yale Law School, Dick 
joined the family firm where he has been prac-
ticing for more than six decades. He is well 
known for both his staunch advocacy on be-
half of as well as his sincere affection for his 
clients. Dick’s commitment and determination 
to ensure justice for all led to his early and un-
failing support of the New Haven Legal Assist-
ance Association and ensuring that those 
most in need had access to quality, affordable 
legal services. 
Throughout his professional career, Dick 
has demonstrated an unparalleled commit-
ment to the justice system. He has been a 
member of the New Haven County Bar Asso-
ciation and the American Association for Jus-
tice since his bar admittance in 1957 and has

served four years as both a member and sec-
tion chairman on the Connecticut Bar Associa-
tion. Among the many accolades he has 
earned, Dick was honored with both the Con-
necticut Bar Association’s Special President’s 
Award as well as the New Haven Legal As-
sistance Association’s Award for Support and 
Equal Access to Justice. Dick is endowed with 
an unwavering duty to pursue what is right 
and it is that indefectible spirit that has won 
him the respect and admiration of those fortu-
nate enough to know him both in and out of 
the courtroom. 
A lifelong resident of New Haven, Dick has 
always shown a deep commitment to the com-
munity. It is where he and his wife, Cary, 
raised their own family and where they con-
tinue their good work to make a difference. A 
proud graduate of Yale University and Yale 
Law School, Dick is an Eli through and 
through—never missing a home football game, 
often simply walking right to Yale Bowl to see 
the games. 
Like so many others, I consider myself fortu-
nate to know Dick Jacobs and I am honored 
to have this opportunity to celebrate this very 
special occasion. Today, as he marks his 90th 
birthday, we pay tribute to the lifetime of dedi-
cation Richard L. Jacobs has made to the City 
of New Haven and our legal system. I wish 
Dick all the best for many more years of 
health and happiness. Happy Birthday.

CONGRATULATING RANDY THOMP-
SON ON SELECTION AS A FUL-
BRIGHT SCHOLAR 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Randy Thompson on 
being selected as one of only fifteen jour-
nalism and communications students in the 
2020 Berlin Capital Program. Funded through 
the Fulbright Commission, this elite edu-
cational program highlights the best and 
brightest of America’s students. 
Thompson is a senior mass communications 
major at the University of Arkansas at Pine 
Bluff, set to graduate in May 2020. He is also 
a member of the Collegiate 4–H Club, the 
Peace Corps Prep Program, and the Phi Beta 
Sigma Fraternity. Throughout his education at 
UAPB, Thompson travelled all over South 
America and Asia, studying Spanish and Chi-
nese. 
The 2020 Berlin Capital Program will focus 
on introducing Thompson and other partici-
pants to German politics, society, and cultural 
affairs in remembrance of the 20th anniversary 
of German reunification. Thompson will also 
have the opportunity to explore the role of 
media in nurturing democracy. 
Randy Thompson’s accomplishment is to be 
commended not just in our district, but across 
our state and nation. Not only docs his work 
serve as an example of academic excellence 
and perseverance, but it also serves as a 
source of pride for the citizens of South Arkan-
sas. 
HONORING SACRAMENTO COUNTY 
SHERIFF’S 
DEPUTY 
MARK 
STASYUK 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of National Police Week and to 
honor a fallen law enforcement officer who 
served my community, Sacramento County 
Sheriff’s Deputy Mark Stasyuk. 
On September 17, 2018, Deputy Stasyuk 
and Officer Julie Robertson responded to a 
call at a local auto parts store. A gun battle 
ensued at the store and Deputy Stasyuk was 
killed in the line of duty. Sheriff’s Deputy Mark 
Stasyuk was a four-and-a-half year veteran of 
the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office. 
Deputy Stasyuk was a beloved son, brother, 
and newlywed husband to his wife, Amy. He 
was a member of Sacramento County’s vi-
brant Russian-American community, had a 
strong faith and a love of the outdoors. 
Deputy Stasyuk had planned on creating his 
wife’s dream backyard at their new house. 
Tragically, he was killed before he could fulfill 
her dream. To honor his life and service, his 
fellow deupties at the Sacramento County 
Deputy Sheriff’s Association stepped in—work-
ing with local contractors to make sure that 
the backyard was finished and could be a 
healing place for Amy and the Stasyuk family. 
This week in May marks the annual observ-
ance 
of 
National 
Police 
Week. 
Deputy 
Stasyuk’s bravery and sacrifice for the Sac-
ramento community and his fellow deputies’ 
support of his family is a testament to the 
commitment to service that law enforcement 
officers bring to our communities every day. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring all those have taken the oath to protect 
and serve, and who have fallen in the line of 
duty. We are forever grateful for Deputy 
Stasyuk’s sacrifice, and he will not be forgot-
ten.

CAROLINA COVERTECH MAKES A 
DIFFERENCE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, in the midst of the battle against the 
Wuhan Virus it is refreshing to read of innova-
tions by small businesses to protect our coura-
geous health professionals. 
The Augusta Chronicle first page featured 
Lisa Stuart of Carolina CoverTech on May 4th 
with a thoughtful article by Staff Writer Damon 
Cline, which I include in the RECORD: 
Carolina CoverTech makes 12,000 products 
that—as the company slogan says—‘‘cover, 
protect, contain and enclose.’’ 
But it wasn’t until this month that the 
third-generation manufacturer made a prod-
uct to cover and protect health care workers. 
The North Augusta-based custom fabri-
cator—best known for producing commercial 
awnings, golf car fabrics and spill-control 
guards for the oil industry—is making dis-
posable isolation gowns for University Hos-
pital. 
With the COVID–19 pandemic draining the 
nation’s supply of personal protection gear, 
the hospital called on CoverTech to produce 
a special run to help get it through the 
shortage. 
‘‘Three weeks ago we had never made one, 
ever,’’ CoverTech President Rian True said. 
‘‘Now we’re making 2,000 a day.’’ 
Although the company and the hospital 
are less than 15 minutes apart, the idea of a 
supplier-customer relationship was some-
thing neither knew was possible. 
But when gown stockpiles started running 
low, University began searching for options 
while volunteers and staff cranked out up to 
1,200 smocks a day using inexpensive sealing 
machines and plastic sheeting from home 
improvement stores. 
In a facility that disposes of 2,000 gowns a 
day, hospital officials predicted all inventory 
would 
be 
exhausted 
by 
the 
time 
the 
pandemic’s predicted ‘‘curve’’ began its up-
ward ascent. Mike Brown, University’s direc-
tor of materials management, offhandedly 
mentioned the dilemma to Greg Shuford, the 
pharmacy manager at University’s Summer-
ville campus. 
Shuford happened to know True, and he 
quickly put the two together. 
CoverTech operations manager Lisa Stuart 
said the plant started producing prototypes 
using existing material within a day of the 
first meeting. 
‘‘We like people who come to us and need 
us to solve a problem,’’ she said. ‘‘We can be 
agile and do things quickly.’’ 
After a few modifications and switching 
the material to a textured plastic sheeting, 
the plant had created a gown that fit the 
hospital’s needs. True said it took a little 
over a week to get the gown line up to full 
production. 
Brown said some of the hospital’s nursing 
staff 
have 
mentioned 
they 
prefer 
CoverTech’s smock to the ones sourced from 
the hospital’s medical-equipment supplier. 
‘‘They say its a little more durable,’’ 
Brown said. ‘‘So they have managed to make 
a gown that is of equivalent quality and is a 
little more durable.’’ 
The gowns, generally light blue in color, 
keep 
bodily 
fluids 
from 
contaminating 
health care workers’ clothing and scrubs. 
The gowns are worn by all workers treating 
suspected or confirmed COVID–19 patients. 
Reed said he enjoys designing products for 
all designing products for all types of appli-
cations, but that the gown project was espe-
cially satisfying. 
‘‘We feel like we’re helping make a little 
bit if a difference,’’ he said.

ship, service, and dedication to the incoming

John was a member of the National Honor So-
ciety, Student Council President, member of

MARTHA F. WILSON 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend the life and leg-
acy of the late Camden, New Jersey resident 
the Honorable Martha F. Wilson. 
Born on March 2, 1953 in New Church, Vir-
ginia, the Honorable Martha Wilson’s family 
relocated to Camden, New Jersey where she 
graduated from Camden High School in 1970. 
Mrs. Wilson attended Camden County College 
and Rutgers University-Camden and following 
graduation she married the Honorable Gilbert 
‘‘Whip’’ Wilson, Sheriff of Camden County, 
New Jersey. 
The Honorable Martha Wilson was the first 
African American to work for the Campbell 
Soup Company where she served as a Med-
ical Secretary in the Medical Department. 
Shortly thereafter she worked as an Account-
ant Receivables Clerk at the RCA Corporation 
located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. 
Among her many accomplishments include 
receiving the Camden County Federation of 
Democratic Women as a Camden County 
Women of Honor award and the Gloucester 
County NAACP ‘Power Couple’ distinction with 
her beloved husband Sheriff Wilson. Martha 
also honorably dedicated her life to serving 
her community in many roles such as Presi-
dent of the Camden City Board of Education, 
Representing Parent to the New Jersey 
School Board Association and also rep-
resented students in New Jersey, New York, 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as Execu-
tive Board Member of the National Coalition of 
Elementary and Secondary Education Asso-
ciation; National School Board Association; 
and Equality and Advocacy Institutes. 
The residents of Camden, New Jersey 
greatly adored and appreciated the dedication 
and humble service of Mrs. Wilson. Her pass-
ing is a great loss to Camden and our entire 
community, as well as a deeply personal loss 
for those who were pdvileged to call her a 
friend and mentor. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring the late Martha Wilson, of Camden, 
New Jersey, a dedicated public servant who 
fought tirelessly for children, parents, her com-
munity and for the constituents of Camden, 
New Jersey.

IN RECOGNITION OF OUR NATION’S 
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of our nation’s law enforcement. 
This year, May 10th marks the start of na-
tional police week. This is a time to honor the 
men and women that serve in local, state and 
federal law enforcement across our country. 
National Police Week is an occasion to cele-
brate the heroes among us and also to reflect 
on those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice 
and fallen in the line of duty. 
I wish to pay a special tribute to the fallen 
officers whose names will be added to the Na-
tional Law Enforcement Memorial this year 
from my home state of Massachusetts. Thom-
as F. Dylan, James B. DeShazo, and Harold 
J. Collins have made their final commitment to 
their community and will be justly honored at 
the National Law Enforcement Memorial in our 
nation’s capital. 
Typically, tens of thousands of law enforce-
ment officers head to Washington, D.C. to par-
take in the events of National Police Week. 
This year, however, the service of these brave 
men and women has been made more evident 
than ever. Instead of celebrating with their 
families and friends, they continue to serve on 
the front lines during the Covid–19 pandemic.

HONORING PINE BLUFF SCHOOLS 
FOR 
THEIR 
COMMITMENT 
TO 
LEARNING 
IN 
THE 
TIME 
OF 
COVID–19 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the work of the Pine Bluff 
School District in Arkansas’ Fourth Congres-
sional District. In the face of COVID–19, these 
educators are going the extra mile to bring 
internet access to students working from home 
in rural areas. 
This school district took quick action to de-
ploy their school buses to those rural areas 
from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. each weekday, providing 
their students the opportunity to conduct their 
assignments from home. This actively com-
batted the struggle that young people of low- 
income households may face without having 
access to their school’s network. It also aided 
those 
students 
who 
may 
face 
rural 
connectivity issues. 
In a rural district like Arkansas’ Fourth, ac-
tion like this is necessary to ensure our stu-
dents can succeed even out of the classroom. 
Thanks to the quick thinking and hard work of 
educators at Pine Bluff School District, stu-
dents of South Arkansas are provided the op-
portunity to learn and to stay connected in the 
time of the COVID–19 crisis. 
I take this time to thank these servant-lead-
ers for their example and for their commitment 
to the education of our communities’ most vul-
nerable citizens. Because of these heroes, the 
future of our country is brighter, even in the 
face of trying times.

SYDNEY POWELL: AMERICAN 
LEGAL HERO 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, Americans are grateful for the per-
sistence, competence, and professionalism of 
Sydney Powell Esq., attorney for General Mi-
chael Flynn. As more information emerges 
about the outrageous General Flynn case, it is 
increasingly obvious that Flynn, a decorated 
general and former director of the Defense In-
telligence Agency, was the victim of rogue FBI 
entrapment on entirely illegal and unconstitu-
tional grounds. Confirming the worst of the 
Deep State. 
Sydney Powell deserves highest accolades 
for fighting for General Flynn in the face of a 
deliberate criminal conspiracy by rogue leader-
ship at the FBI to incriminate both General 
Flynn and the Trump Administration under the 
fake pretense of ‘‘Russian collusion.’’ The en-
tire investigation began and continues to be a 
partisan witch hunt which must be uncovered 
for the sake of the American Republic. If this 
can happen to someone like General Flynn, 
indeed it can happen to any law-abiding cit-
izen of this country. In persistently fighting 
against this madness, Sydney Powell and the 
rest of General Flynn’s capable legal team 
also fight for the rights of all Americans to de-
fend themselves against illegal conspiracies of 
the highest degree by a Deep State. 
As a proud attorney myself and being the 
grateful father of S.C. Attorney General Alan 
Wilson, I am especially shocked at the rogue 
FBI and Department of Justice abuses of the 
profession. 
From the outset, there was absolutely no 
criminal predicate before the election for in-
vestigation into General Flynn. Previously un-
disclosed FBI documents from 2016 make the 
intentions of federal investigators crystal clear. 
One note from these documents written by the 
former head of FBI counterintelligence reads, 
‘‘What is our goal? Truth and admission or to 
get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get 
him fired?’’ These documents also reveal dis-
cussions regarding how the Justice Depart-
ment could get Flynn to admit to breaking the 
Logan Act, even though this law has never 
been used to convict an American citizen and 
questions abound as to its legality since its 
enactment in 1799. 
But when General Flynn was blackmailed 
into pleading guilty, none of these documents 
were made available to him or his legal team. 
And while federal investigators did not believe

that General Flynn had lied intentionally during 
the investigation, the disgraced Special Coun-
sel Mueller and his team disregarded this and 
moved ahead with the dubious charges, 
ratcheting up the pressure by even threatening 
to charge General Flynn’s son, aided and 
abetted by the shamefully biased U.S. District 
Judge Sullivan. 
What emerges from the evidence at hand is 
a shameful and chilling account of attempted 
entrapment by the federal government against 
an innocent man with a long history of serving 
his country. I commend Sydney Powell for her 
fortitude and determination against these 
seemingly insurmountable odds. America is 
grateful for leaders like General Michael Flynn 
and for strong advocates of the law like Attor-
ney Sydney Powell. 
It is sad that many Democrats and their bra-
zen mainstream media allies have become af-
flicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome 
leading to any nefarious illegality to establish 
the ends justify the means of the destruction 
of the Trump Presidency.

HONORING SARAH ETTA WORK 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Sarah Etta Work 
as she celebrates her 100th birthday on 
Wednesday, May 27. 
A dedicated member of her community, Mrs. 
Work 
graduated 
from 
Connellsville 
High 
School in 1938 before attending the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. She managed the 
kitchen at Springfield Elementary School in 
Newville, Pennsylvania for 27 years. 
Mrs. Work and her husband, Glenn, estab-
lished the Mill Run Campground, now the Yogi 
Bear Campground in Mill Run, Pennsylvania. 
Today, she continues to maintain a consistent 
presence at the campground. 
For decades, Mrs. Work has been an out-
standing community member. She is a mem-
ber of the Indian Creek Baptist Church, where 
she taught Sunday School for over 40 years. 
Additionally, she served as a 4-H leader for 25 
years. Mrs. Work has two children, six grand-
children, and 14 great-grandchildren. Before 
Glenn’s passing in 2007, Mr. and Mrs. Work 
were married for 67 years. 
It’s my honor to congratulate Sarah Etta 
Work on a century of life well-lived. I wish her 
a very happy 100th birthday and every contin-
ued happiness.

RECOGNIZING SUSAN DAVIS’ OUT-
STANDING 
CAREER 
AT 
THE 
RAINER 
CHAMBER 
OF 
COM-
MERCE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor and thank Susan Davis for over 
12 years of dedicated service to her commu-
nity as Executive Director of the Rainer Cham-
ber of Commerce. 
Susan provided an invaluable service to 
South Seattle over the last 12 years as the 
Executive Director of the Rainer Chamber of 
Commerce. She always saw the potential in 
the region and worked tirelessly to celebrate 
diversity and bring economic prosperity. Al-
though not originally from Washington, Susan 
became a heartbeat of her community. 
There are few who have had a stronger 
dedication to South Seattle. Susan focused on 
improving education, economic development, 
and public safety. During her time as Execu-
tive Director she produced festivals and pa-
rades for the community, helped create the 
Southeast Seattle Map and Guide, and hosted 
extraordinary guests at the Chamber lunch-
eons. Her enthusiasm and kind spirit allowed 
her to connect and make friends with nearly 
anyone. 
Susan’s genuine passion for giving back did 
not go unnoticed—and still does not. Even 
though Susan is no longer with the Chamber 
of Commerce, she is still working on projects 
in the neighborhood and looking for ways to 
contribute to her community. 
The entire community will miss Susan’s 
presence in this role, but she has created a 
legacy and we will continue to see the benefits 
of what she accomplished for many years to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect and 
admiration I honor Susan Davis on her out-
standing career as Executive Director of the 
Rainer Chamber of Commerce and the lasting 
impression she made on her community.

OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I, along with 
Representative KATIE PORTER, rise today to 
recognize the University of California, Irvine 
for its exemplary response to the ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic. UCI has always been 
committed to providing quality medical treat-
ment and research to the Orange County 
community and improving public health nation-
wide. In this time of crisis, UCI’s commitment 
to public health is nothing short of admirable. 
UCI has been a leader in COVID–19 re-
sponse since this threat was first recognized. 
Researchers and medical professionals per-
form extensive research, conduct clinical trials 
on drugs to treat the virus, test large volumes 
of people for the virus, and collaborate with re-
searchers and healthcare professionals across 
the nation. Widespread testing is critical to 
tracking the spread of the coronavirus. UCI 
has made this a priority by testing first re-
sponders and screening physicians, staff 
members, and other health care providers 
daily. Researchers at UCI also create and 
produce protective shields to meet the needs 
of healthcare providers on the front lines and 
contribute sample-preserving fluid for COVID– 
19 test kits. 
In light of this crisis, we look to institutions 
like UCI to provide us with the research and 
treatment tools to get us through this extraor-
dinary public health crisis. We are grateful for 
the work UCI has done to research, prevent, 
and treat the virus as well as educate the pub-
lic on best-practices during this time. 
I ask that all Members join me in honoring 
the important work and leadership of the Uni-
versity of California, Irvine.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 130TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF PELL CITY 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize 
the 130th Anniversary of Pell City, Alabama. 
In the late 1890s, in a small community 
tucked midway between Birmingham and At-
lanta, three railroad lines connected. The story 
of Pell City began when a young insurance 
salesman en route to Talladega missed his 
train, and, thus, was forced to spend a night 
at Pell City’s Cornett Hotel. That young man’s 
name was Sumter Cogswell. 
Upon reviewing the community’s location to 
water, cotton fields, coal mines and railroads, 
Mr. Cogswell decided to invest in the growth 
of the community. It took him two tries and 
upon his second try, he moved his family and 
household belongings to the community rais-
ing the number of people calling this area 
home to just over 40 people. 
A textile mill was built and jobs were plenti-
ful. In 1901, Pell City became the location of 
the second courthouse in St. Clair County, an 
act that would take an amendment to the Ala-
bama State Constitution to complete. 
In the 1960s, Logan Martin Lake and Inter-
state 20 added to the town’s appeal, and the 
population increased dramatically. 
In the 130 years since that fateful day when 
Mr. Cogswell missed his train, and with the di-
rection and investment of visionary leaders, 
Pell City has continued to grow and flourish in 
one of the fastest growing counties of Ala-
bama. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the 130th Anniversary of Pell City, Ala-
bama.

Due to his actions, medical professionals will

In April 2020, Mangan became the first per-
son to donate blood plasma after the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration approved clin-
ical trials and use of plasma extracted from 
those who have survived the virus to treat 
those who are currently battling COVID–19.

to Arkansas from a ski trip, Mangan and his

wife soon realized the severity of their symp-
toms, quarantining themselves for 14 days 
and learning of their positive tests. While he 
has recovered from the illness, Mangan knew 
that his plasma could be the life-saving dif-
ference for someone else facing this virus. 
During a visit to the Arkansas Blood Institute, 
Mangan donated over 600 millimeters of yel-
low plasma to be donated to the cause. 
David Mangan is truly an example of her-
oism in a time of great need. He exemplifies 
the strength of a survivor and the heart of a 
true servant. I take this time to wish him and 
his family well in the coming days and thank 
them for their commitment to seeing our com-
munities thrive and return to good health.

SECRETARY POMPEO IN ISRAEL 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, congratulations to Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo for traveling to Israel this week, 
his first international trip in nearly two months 
amid the ongoing Wuhan Virus pandemic. The 
trip coincided with the two-year anniversary of 
President Trump fulfilling his campaign and 
implementing U.S. law by relocating the U.S. 
Embassy to Jerusalem, Israel’s eternal unified 
capital. I was grateful to lead the House Dele-
gation with Senator Lindsey Graham, Vice 
President Mike Pence, lvanka Trump, and 
Jared Kushner for the opening of the new em-
bassy with Ambassador David Friedman as 
President Trump fulfilled ‘‘Promises Made, 
Promises Kept.’’ Secretary Pompeo’s trip also 
coincided with the 72nd anniversary of the 
Israel’s Declaration of Independence on May 
14, 1948. The timing of the visit, especially 
given today’s circumstances, sends a clear 
message to our valued allies and friends in 
Israel: the United States will unequivocally 
stand by your side. 
Secretary Pompeo’s visit also comes as 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his 
political rival Knesset Speaker Benny Gantz 
are in midst of forming a unity government 
after over a year of political stalemate that has 
paralyzed the Israeli government. This new 
unity government will be especially significant 
as it will take the first steps to realize Presi-
dent Trump’s bold and unprecedented ‘‘Peace 
to Prosperity’’ Middle East peace plan coordi-
nated by Jared Kushner. 
President Trump’s plan, unveiled in January 
2020, offers a fresh opportunity to restart final 
status negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestinians. This new plan includes many in-
centives for both sides, including an Israeli 
settlement freeze for four years, land swaps 
for both sides, and $50 billion in new invest-
ment in the Palestinian territories. 
While Israel has indicated a willingness to 
restart the negotiations, the Palestinian side 
has unfortunately categorically rebuffed Presi-
dent Trump’s plan, in line with their rejectionist 
track-record. I am grateful for the Trump Ad-
ministration’s efforts to restart negotiations for 
Middle East peace, and I beseech both sides 
to take this opportunity for a new, hopeful fu-
ture seriously. 
Undoubtedly another high priority item on 
Secretary Pompeo’s agenda in Israel is the 
persistent threat to Israel and indeed the sta-
bility and security of the entire region, posed 
by Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism and its de-
velopment of ballistic missiles. The threat will 
unfortunately be compounded in October of 
this year, when the United Nations arms em-
bargo on Iran expires pursuant to UN Security 
Council Resolution 2231. 
Not only does its expiration allow Iran to buy 
potentially game-changing military hardware 
and technology, it also weakens and effec-
tively eliminates the legal architecture that has 
underpinned international efforts to restrict 
Iran’s ability to transfer weapons to their prox-
ies. I’m grateful that Secretary Pompeo and 
President Trump have made coordination of 
security with Israel a top priority in light of this 
growing threat. 
Secretary Pompeo’s visit to Israel this week 
is yet another indication of the Trump Adminis-
tration’s strong support for our valued ally, 
Israel. It is a strong sign that this Administra-
tion will not forsake our allies and will always 
stand with the people of Israel to face any 
challenge side-by-side.

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Speaker, as the Chairman of the Committee 
on Homeland Security, I rise to honor Mr. 
Tyler Kent upon the conclusion of his service 
to the Committee as a Detailee from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office. 
Since joining the Committee one year ago, 
Mr. Kent has made valuable contributions to 
our work by sharing his considerable expertise 
on government operations and transportation 
and maritime security issues. He has served 
as a reliable resource to our staff and signifi-
cantly advanced our legislative and oversight 
efforts. In particular, during his tenure on the 
Committee, Mr. Kent was deeply involved in 
our oversight of the implementation of the TSA 
Modernization Act. Additionally, he helped 
identify solutions for supporting the Transpor-
tation Security Administration workforce which 
were integral to the House passage of the 
Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act 
of 2020 earlier this year. 
Throughout his time on the Committee, Mr. 
Kent has displayed a high degree of profes-
sionalism and personal commitment to pro-
viding Members of Congress and staff valu-
able insight and information. Mr. Kent has 
demonstrated commendable dedication, en-
thusiasm, and good humor, which has helped 
all of us enormously. 
We thank Mr. Kent for his service to the 
Committee and our country and wish him the 
very best as he returns to the Government Ac-
countability Office.

Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to 
honor the life of my dear friend and con-
stituent, Renee Kapchuk Grutman. 
For decades, Ms. Grutman served as a 
fierce advocate for Broward County’s children. 
Renee found her life-long home in our public 
schools and was an educational and PTA su-
perstar at her core. She faithfully and volun-
tarily served in numerous PTA council board 
positions and worked vigorously in pursuit of 
the optimum educational experience for every 
Broward County public school student. 
The word ‘‘no’’ was not in Renee’s vocabu-
lary. She helped plan, fund, and organize 
every council event including trainings, meet-
ings, awards banquets, conventions, student 
programs, and holidays to name a few. 
She was affectionately known as The Part-
nership Queen, using her can-do spirit and in-
fectious optimism to secure partnerships, fund-
ing, and assistance for school activities—ac-
tivities that would not been possible if not for 
Renee’s passion, determination, and support. 
She was a champion in every sense of the 
word. 
Renee was a dear friend who embodied the 
best of what it means to give back to your 
community. She was a selfless, compas-
sionate, and a tireless advocate for others and 
will be profoundly missed but never forgotten. 
My heart is with her children, grandchildren, 
and all her extended family.

Electrician’s Mate First Class onboard the 
USS LST 582 and USS LST 72. 
After the war, Coach Novak resumed his 
education, earning his Bachelor’s Degree from 
the University of Maryland College Park, and 
meeting his wife, Mrs. Phyllis Jane Shipley. 
Together they would have three children: 
Deborah Glasgow, Robert Novak, Jr., and 
Kevin Novak; as well as six grandchildren and 
three great-grandchildren. 
Coach Novak began his coaching career as 
an assistant football coach for his alma matter, 
the City Collge Knights, where he was my 
swim and football coach. During his tenure, 
Coach Novak would lead the Knight’s football 
program to a 6–2 record against their rival, 
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, six Maryland 
Scholastic Association championships, and a 
top 10 ranking in the country. 
In 1965, he became the first athletic director 
at Northwestern High School in Baltimore. 
Coach Novak coached four sports and led the 
Wildcats to two football state titles before 
transferring to the McDonogh School in 
Owings Mills in 1978, where he would work for 
13 years. Coach Novak was inducted to the 
McDonogh School Athletic Hall of Fame, was 
named Maryland Athletic Director of the Year, 
and was inducted to the Maryland State Ath-
letic Director’s Hall of Fame. 
Madam Speaker, aside from the decades 
Coach Novak spent in school athletics and 
sports administration, he was perhaps best 
known for his service to his community. Coach 
Novak and his wife Phyllis facilitated reunions 
for his WWII ship and he was an active mem-
ber of the Ensign C. Markland Kelly, Jr. Me-
morial Post 174 as well as the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars Post 9083. He taught swimming 
for 21 years at the Hampton Pool in Towson, 
and was a co-founder of the Free State Swim 
League, for which he was recongized by the 
American Red Cross for his 30 years and 
4,500 hours of volunteerism. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me 
today to honor the life of Coach Robert Edwin 
‘‘Ed’’ Novak, Sr. His compassion and dedica-
tion to our country, the Baltimore community, 
and his students is an inspiration to all. I hum-
bly express my condolences to his friends and 
family and wish them peace and comfort in 
the days ahead.

for the people of Xian, Chungdu, and Kunming

Samantha brings a tremendous amount of 
leadership, service, and dedication to the in-
coming Class of 2024. While attending An-
thony Wayne High School in Whitehouse, 
Ohio, Samantha volunteered for her church, 
Special Olympics, and Toledo Humane Soci-
ety, while being a member of National Honor 
Society and maintaining a 4.738 GPA. 
Throughout high school, Samantha was in-
volved with soccer and basketball, having 
achieved her varsity letter in both. I am con-
fident that Samantha will carry the lessons of 
her student and athletic leadership to the 
Naval Academy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Samantha Schofield on 
her offer of appointment to the United States 
Naval Academy. Our service academies offer 
the finest military training and education avail-
able. I am positive that Samantha will excel 
during her career at the Naval Academy, and 
I ask my colleagues to join me in extending 
their best wishes to her as she begins her 
service to our nation.

HONORING 
THE 
EXEMPLARY 
SERVICE 
OF 
CRYSTAL 
RIDGE 
DISTILLERY 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the exemplary service of Crys-
tal Ridge Distillery. Family owned and oper-
ated in Hot Springs, Arkansas, Crystal Ridge 
Distillery was on the front lines of battling the 
threat of COVID–19 on a state-wide stage. 
Started in 2018, Crystal Ridge Distillery was 
created by Danny Bradley, a native of the Hot 
Springs area with a passion for local history, 
job creation, and revitalization of the Down-
town Hot Springs area. Originally intended to 
become a family venue restaurant and dis-
tillery, Mr. Bradley and his family quickly saw 
the need for action in facing the public health 
crisis that resulted from COVID–19. 
Halting the production of its locally sourced 
southern moonshine, the Bradley family and 
Crystal Ridge team shifted their production 
and their fermentation tanks to produce hand 
sanitizer. Within days, Crystal Ridge hand 
sanitizer was on the shelves of Arkansas 
stores, ameliorating the shortage in the State 
of Arkansas and protecting its people from the 
spread of the virus. 
The quick action of Crystal Ridge Distillery 
not only actively combatted a public health cri-
sis, but it also served to highlight the power of 
a few good people who have the desire and 
conviction to serve their fellow man. Their 
family and their business are to be com-
mended for their heroic efforts not just here in 
Arkansas, but all across America.

HONORING MISSION AVIATION 
FELLOWSHIP 
HON. RUSS FULCHER 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, as a man 
of faith, I have seen the spiritual strength of 
our nation tested during these challenging 
times. As a ray of hope, I run proud to show-
case the work of Mission Aviation Fellowship, 
headquartered in Nampa Idaho, on their 75th 
anniversary. Founded shortly after World War 
II, a few veteran pilots who served our country 
found a way to extend the gospel of Christ to 
those in desperate need of aid, supplies, and 
medicine. On May 20, 1945, a non-profit orga-
nization was formed, and on February 23, 
1946, Mission Aviation Fellowship chartered 
their first flight from La Habra, California to 
Tuxpan, Mexico. A founding board member, 
Betty Greene, served as MAF’s first pilot, and 
after that first flight into Mexico she became 
the first woman to fly over the Andes mountain 
in South America, and the first female pilot in 
Sudan, as she traveled the world on behalf of 
MAF. She is a recipient of a Congressional 
Gold Medal as a Women Airforce Service Pilot 
(WASP) for her wartime service. Over the 
years, and through earthquakes, war, and 
genocides, Mission Aviation Fellowship sent 
brave men and women into uncharted areas 
to help those so desperately needing aid. 
Today, Mission Aviation Fellowship operates a 
fleet of 47 light aircraft, with 13 of those 
planes being Kodiaks, which are manufactured 
in Sandpoint, Idaho. In the 13 countries it 
serves, Mission Aviation Fellowship is that 
light at the end of the tunnel for many seeking 
aid when all else seems dark. Last year, I had 
the pleasure of meeting the staff of Mission 
Aviation Fellowship at their headquarters in 
Nampa, and the faith, courage, and dedication 
to their divinely inspired ‘‘mission’’ gives me 
great hope for our future. But as we learned 
on May 12, it comes at a cost. MAF pilot 
Joyce Lin took off from the Sentani, Papua, In-
donesia airport, on her way to a village in the 
Papua highlands, delivering supplies for a 
school and COVID–19 rapid test kits for the 
local clinic. A few minutes later, over Sentani 
Lake, she declared an emergency. Joyce did 
not survive the ensuing accident. She loved 
her Lord and she loved serving other people 
who were in need. The MAF family is grieving 
the loss of this dedicated pilot. As Jesus 
Christ, our savior once said, ‘‘Truly, I say to 
you, as you did it to one of the least of these 
my brothers, you did it to me.’’ May Mission 
Aviation Fellowship’s leadership be an exam-
ple for all of us during these difficult times.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE COMMIS-
SIONING OF THE USS ‘‘KANSAS 
CITY’’ (LCS–22) 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I proudly 
rise today to recognize and celebrate the U.S. 
Navy’s newest addition to its fleet, the Inde-
pendence-class Littoral Combat Ship, USS 
Kansas City. 
On September 22, 2018, before a large 
crowd, the USS Kansas City (LCS–22) was 
christened in Mobile, Alabama. She was 
launched on October 19, 2018, into the Mobile 
River. On June 20, 2020, she will be commis-
sioned in San Diego, California. 
The Independence variant Littoral Combat 
Ship (LCS) is testament to the hardworking 
and highly skilled women and men in the 
United States Navy and our nation’s ship-
building and manufacturing industries. It is a 
high-speed, agile, multi-mission ship designed 
to defeat growing littoral threats and provide 
access and dominance in coastal waters. The 
reconfigurability of the ship makes it a force 
multiplier in any environment for the Navy. 
She is the third ship to be named for Kan-
sas City, the largest city in the state of Mis-
souri. The first USS Kansas City (CA–128) 
was to have been a heavy cruiser but was 
canceled due to the end of World War II, just 
days after the keel laying ceremony. The sec-
ond USS Kansas City (AOR–3) was a Wichita- 
class replenishment oiler and saw service in 
the Vietnam War and Operation Desert Storm. 
What the future holds for the newest USS 
Kansas City is anyone’s guess. 
What I do know, without a doubt, is that the 
brave women and men, who took an oath to 
uphold the constitution and protect you and I 
and the liberty we hold so dear, are the true 
heroes and protagonists of this story. They are 
the ones who will be making history. They are 
the ones who will serve on this ship and who 
will make all of us from Kansas City proud as 
it sails with our city’s name. 
This ship will sail with the support of the en-
tire city. Any sailor who steps aboard the USS 
Kansas City will find themselves an honorary 
Kansas Citian and a constituent of mine. I 
wish to express my sincere and grateful ap-
preciation for the dedicated service provided 
by all current and future crew members of the 
USS Kansas City, and for the selflessness 
and sacrifices they and their families make in 
order that we may live in safety and freedom. 
Go therefore, USS Kansas City and make 
your mark, assume your place in history. Be 
proud of your accomplishments and make the 
most of your failures. 
As President Truman through his wit and 
wisdom once said, ‘‘Men make history. History 
does not make the man.’’ 
Madam Speaker, please join me in wishing 
the women and men of the USS Kansas City 
fair winds and following seas.

INDIA IS VOCAL FOR LOCAL 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I was grateful to read in The Wall 
Street Journal (May 13) that Indian Prime Min-
ister Narendra Modi in a nationally televised 
speech pledged to boost economic self-suffi-
ciency amid the Wuhan Virus pandemic. 
With 1.3 billion people locked down since 
March 25th the country has suffered historic 
job losses as nonessential industries have 
been completely shut down. Prime Minister 
Modi is inspiring the people of India with the 
slogan ‘‘Lets be vocal for local’’ 
America is fortunate to have such an incred-
ible leader of the Indo-Pacific. I was present 
firsthand several years ago with Ambassador 
Nikki Haley to welcome the Prime Minister to 
the Center Ring of Madison Square Garden in 
New York City. Last year I was present at the 
historic Red Fort in New Delhi for the Prime 
Minister’s Independence Day address, and 
later in Houston with President Donald Trump 
for the Howdy Modi event with over 50,000 at-
tending in the largest welcoming celebration 
for a foreign head of state in the history of the 
United States. 
I am confident with the obvious warm rela-
tionship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and 
President Donald Trump that the families of 
India and America will prevail over the Wuhan 
Virus.

HONORING THOMAS ANTHONY 
FLANNERY 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the House 
of Representatives to join me in honoring 
Thomas Anthony Flannery. 
Tom Flannery was born and raised in the 
Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia to 
immigrant parents from Ireland in 1923. Fol-
lowing the attack on Pearl Harbor during 
WWII, Tom enlisted in the Army where he be-
came a part of the Third Infantry Division. At 
20 years old, Tom was injured and captured at 
Anzio where he became a Prisoner of War for 
over a year under the German infantry. 
After returning home, Flannery married Joan 
Donnelly, who he met one summer in Ocean 
City, New Jersey. They were married for 62 
years until she died eight years ago. They had 
seven children—Karen, Butch, Joan, Nancy, 
Eileen, Susie and Kate. For over 40 years 
Tom ran his father’s ‘‘saloon’’, Flannery’s Tav-
ern in the Nicetown neighborhood of Philadel-
phia. Always more of a social worker than 
businessman, Tom rented out apartments 
above the tavern and when anyone was strug-
gling to pay their rent, he would let them work 
off the rent instead of evicting them. 
Tom is a humble, yet critical, member of our 
community. Even though he received a Purple 
Heart and a Bronze Star for his service in 
WWII, Tom considers those who didn’t return 
home from the war the real heroes. It is peo-
ple like Tom who are the gears that make the 
entire engine run, and who make their com-
munities better, stronger and more inter-
connected. It is people like Tom that remind 
us what life is worth living for. He never loses 
sight of what’s most important to him—family, 
friends and faith. 
May Tom ‘‘live to be a hundred years.’’

he was affectionately known—passed away on 
April 23, 2020, at the age of 58. With his 
passing, the manufactured housing industry 
lost a legend. 
Manufactured homes are a critical source of 
housing for more than 22 million Americans, 
including over 750,000 residents of Alabama. 
With the national homeownership rate at a 50- 
year low and rents increasing at a rapid pace, 
manufactured homes are one of the most 
promising avenues for addressing our coun-
try’s affordable housing shortage. Tommy un-
derstood the importance of manufactured 
housing, and he worked every day to promote 
and protect the industry. 
Tommy began his career with manufactured 
housing in 1976, painting frames in a plant 
when he was only 14 years old. After finishing 
high school, he stayed in the industry, later 
graduating from Troy University in Troy, Ala-
bama, with Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees 
in Business Administration. By 1992, he set 
out on his own, opening an installation com-
pany-Southern Mobile Home Service. Five 
years later, he joined the Alabama Manufac-
tured Housing Commission, where he later 
served as Assistant Administrator. 
He was also serving as Chair of the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment’s (HUD) Manufactured Housing Con-
sensus Committee and as Co-Chair of the 
Southern Region Council of State Administra-
tive Agencies. Last September, his office 
worked with HUD’s Office of Manufactured 
Housing Programs to host the ‘‘State Adminis-
trative Agency and Primary Inspection Agency 
Southern and Eastern Regional Meeting’’ in 
Mobile, Alabama. Two years ago, in recogni-
tion of his commitment to the manufactured 
housing industry, he was honored as the 
‘‘2018 Alabama Manufactured Housing Asso-
ciation Person of the Year’’ by the Alabama 
Manufactured Housing Association. In Feb-
ruary, he was inducted into the Alabama Man-
ufactured Housing Industry Hall of Fame. 
A devoted family man, he and his wife, Lisa, 
were married for 32 years. He is also survived 
by two children—his son, Ethan (Kaela), and 
daughter, Devon (Sam). A life-long resident of 
Eclectic, Alabama, he was also an elder and 
minister with Mt. Hebron Church of Christ. In 
his spare time, he loved to fish. 
Madam speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the life of Tommy and everything he did 
to support this industry. He will be missed.

SALUTING 
3,000 
TOLEDO 
JEEP 
WORKERS TO ‘RETURN-TO-WORK’ 
MONDAY BY STATE EDICT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with sincere concern for the well-being of 
thousands of workers and include in the 
RECORD this congratulatory entry during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. This coming Monday 
thousands of plant workers, largely connected 
to auto manufacturing and supplier networks, 
will ‘‘return to work.’’ Their return is a State of 
Ohio decision by the Governor to allow pro-
duction to resume at Fiat Chrysler in Toledo 
and hundreds of other Ohio manufacturing fa-
cilities. As Co-Chair of the U.S. House Auto 
Caucus, I represent workers who build the 
iconic Jeep product, vehicles from GM and 
Ford, and components from glass to tires and 
from paint to bucket seats. These plants and 
their workers were as instrumental in creating 
reliable over ground transportation during the 
last century in World War II that carried our Al-
lied victory. Today they are building new hy-
brid and electric vehicle technologies. Ohioans 
build things. Workers must be allowed to do 
their craft in a healthy and safe environment. 
In their ‘‘return to work,’’ these workers likely 
represent the largest manufacturing workforce 
to restart production nearly anywhere in Amer-
ica. 
My primary concern remains the workers, 
their health and safety, and the absolute ne-
cessity of embarking upon a COVID–19 test-
ing regime that will protect them, their cowork-
ers, and their families from the spread of the 
dreaded Covid–19 virus even as the Governor 
has opened the doors to these plants. To this 
end, I have spent hours on end on the tele-
phone and in meetings with top executives, 
union leaders, workers, health professionals, 
local health departments, the state health de-
partment, private and publicly operated labs. 
My goal: to get up and running, the testing ca-
pacity for which l have voted for and workers 
have been promised. But that is still largely 
lacking in Ohio and across our nation. 
I remain deeply concerned about the health 
and safety of Ohio’s workers. I offer my full 
cooperation to achieve a testing regime ac-
ceptable to our workforce, medical sciences, 
and all concerned. Workers who enter plants 
across Ohio will be working at a closer density 
than those who live in many of our nursing 
homes where COVID–19 has struck with a 
vengeance. In the case of Toledo Jeep, work-
ers will travel from Michigan and Indiana to 
work - untested and uncertain about what they 
face. Contact tracing will be harder without 
testing. Lucas County already has endured the 
highest number of COVID–19 related deaths 
in our State. We must pay attention. Today, 
the Veteran’s Home in Sandusky was struck 
by the COVID–19. It only takes one person 
who has the virus asymptomatically to directly 
spread it to many others. Testing is the only 
way to ensure that workers can work in a safe 
environment. A temperature test is not suffi-
cient. 
I cannot remain silent as this workforce be-
gins not only a new week, but a new chapter 
in American history. I offer my full personal 
and financial support as l am able to work with 
the management and workforce representa-
tives at the Fiat Chrysler and other facilities to 
embark upon necessary, free testing to assure 
the short and long-term health of these valu-
able American workers. Ours is a great nation, 
We must not accept less. 
On a personal note, our beloved father re-
tired from the old Jeep facility on Central Ave-
nue and our beautiful mother served the orga-
nizing committee of the original United Auto 
Workers unit at Champion Spark Plug, I be-
lieve our family knows firsthand what it takes 
to assure worker health and safety, In their 
memory, I take this stand for autoworkers, and 
all workers, who are being released to the 
workforce. Our great nation has the capability 
to safeguard the health and well-being of 
every person. To paraphrase a Civil War Ad-
miral: ‘‘Damn the Torpedoes! Full speed 
ahead!’’ This must be our rallying cry for test-
ing all our workers. America should accept no 
less than the best.
