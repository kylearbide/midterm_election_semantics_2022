MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 2020 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Our Father, as we think of those so 
desperately in need of legislative ac-
tion, give our lawmakers the wisdom 
and courage needed for these chal-
lenging times. Use them to empower 
all Americans, particularly those on 
life’s margins. 
Lord, help our Senators today to dis-
cern Your voice as they seek Your will 
in all they do. Give them the ability to 
differentiate Your guidance from all 
others, permitting You to lead them to 
Your desired destination. Speak to 
them through Your word. Guide them 
with Your Spirit, and sustain them 
with Your might. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ACADEMIC FREEDOM 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, ev-
erybody now in the Senate remembers 
Senator Hatch. I want to tell you how 
he is still on the job, reminding Ameri-
cans of our traditions. 
Recently, 
my 
friend 
from 
Utah, 
former Senator Orrin Hatch, wrote 
about American academia and our so- 
called cancel culture. I encourage all 
Americans to read his essay that was 
published in the Wall Street Journal. 
Senator Hatch calls for a ‘‘renewed 
commitment to intellectual diversity’’ 
and for a ‘‘radical overhaul of campus 
culture.’’ 
I agree with Senator Hatch. 
Our institutions of higher learning 
need to wake up and welcome the open 
exchange of ideas in the classrooms 
and across campuses, and if that isn’t 
what universities and colleges are for, I 
don’t know what they are for. Silenc-
ing or shaming students from sharing 
divergent views is antithetical to the 
American way. 
Our next generation of leaders de-
serves better. As colleges begin the 
school year, they should focus on keep-
ing their students safe from the virus, 
but—and a big ‘‘but’’—they shouldn’t 
worry one bit about keeping students 
safe from the free exchange of ideas or 
prevent professors from teaching dif-
ferent schools of thought. The herd 
mentality limits intellectual curiosity, 
and that is bad for freedom, particu-
larly academic freedom. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 
THE NAVY-MARINES TRAGEDY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate mourns the tragedy that we 
now know took place Thursday, off the 
coast of Southern California. 
According to official reports, nine 
American servicemembers—eight ma-
rines and one sailor—died during a 
training exercise. These young service-
members were all between the ages of 
19 and 23. It is absolutely heart-
breaking. 
The 
units 
involved 
are 
among our most unique and specialized 
amphibious forces. Their training is 
what allows them to deploy at a mo-
ment’s notice, under the harshest con-
ditions, in the most remote and unsup-
ported locations. 
As the search for survivors turned 
into a recovery mission, the Nation 
was reminded that even what our men 
and women in uniform may consider to 
be routine still involves serious risk 
and personal sacrifice. 
I extend the Senate’s sympathies to 
the families of those lost and our grati-
tude to the Marine Corps, Navy, and 
Coast Guard personnel who are search-
ing to bring their comrades home.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4654 
August 3, 2020 
officials from the intelligence commu-
nity, the FBI, and the Department of 
Homeland Security will brief us on for-
eign efforts to influence our politics 
and elections and how the administra-
tion is defending us. Every one of our 
colleagues should attend one of these 
sessions. 
Sharing sensitive threat information 
with Congress is just one of the ways 
this administration has outperformed 
its predecessor. The intelligence com-
munity kept Congress much more 
closely informed about these threats in 
2018 and now in 2020 than it did in the 
runup to 2016. I am sure these briefings 
will contain details that might seem 
ripe for cherry-picking and partisan 
leaks from both sides, but it is essen-
tial that Congress remain a place 
where the word ‘‘classified’’ actually 
means something. Leaking intelligence 
jeopardizes sources and methods. 
If we learned anything from studying 
Russian interference in 2016, it is that 
our adversaries’ ultimate objective is 
to leave America more divided and less 
confident in our institutions. Members 
of Congress must take special care not 
to do Putin’s work for him. 
Foreign adversaries have long sought 
to interfere in our politics and elec-
tions. That didn’t start in 2016, and it 
will not end in 2020, but this adminis-
tration has put us in a far, far better 
position than in 2016. There is, simply, 
no comparison. The intelligence com-
munity is better aware of the threat. 
Government agencies are more trans-
parent with Congress, the State and 
local jurisdictions that actually run 
elections, the private sector, and the 
public. 
In 2016, the Obama-Biden administra-
tion had to lean on congressional lead-
ership to act as a bridge to the States 
because the States so distrusted their 
Department of Homeland Security. 
Over the last 4 years, this administra-
tion’s DHS has develop its own deep re-
lationship with State officials. In 2016, 
only 14 State or local jurisdictions had 
received high-tech Albert sensors to 
alert them to cyber intrusions. They 
are deployed in all 50 States today. 
There were 14 States that had them in 
2016, and every State has them today. 
It was this administration that stood 
up the new Elections Infrastructure In-
formation Sharing and Analysis Cen-
ter, with participation from more than 
2,600 local jurisdictions and counting. 
This 
administration 
has 
imposed 
real, hard costs on election inter-
ference and Russia’s other misdeeds: 
shuttering the Kremlin’s consulates in 
San Francisco and Seattle; kicking out 
intelligence 
officers; 
sanctioning 
oligarchs; helping European partners 
defend their own elections against Rus-
sia; and sending weapons to Ukraine 
and Georgia, which the Obama-Biden 
administration did not supply. 
This administration has also con-
fronted China for what the State De-
partment described as ‘‘massive espio-
nage and influence operations,’’ includ-
ing closing Beijing’s consulate in Hous-
ton. 
As the Democratic vice chairman on 
the 
Senate 
Intelligence 
Committee 
stated in 2016, ‘‘We were caught flat-
footed.’’ Not anymore. Congress has 
provided more than $800 million for 
States and localities to shore up elec-
tion security and has passed a number 
of targeted new laws. Since foreign po-
litical interference is so often aimed at 
private sector platforms, like social 
media sites, we have encouraged those 
businesses to step up vigilance as well. 
Through all of this, we have also 
carefully avoided things that look like 
quick fixes but which would undermine 
our own institutions. In the United 
States of America, it is the States and 
localities, not the Federal Government, 
that run elections—period. Our lack of 
a one-size-fits-all national system isn’t 
just constitutionally appropriate; it 
also acts as a further safeguard. We 
lack a single point of failure. 
So, in closing, I urge all of our col-
leagues to attend these important 
briefings with an eye toward our real 
adversaries—not our fellow Americans 
but the foreign agents who love to see 
us at one another’s throats. 
Back during the impeachment trial, 
a leading House Democrat asserted 
that, if President Trump were to win 
reelection, the people’s vote would be 
presumptively invalid. 
Just a few days ago, it was reported 
that a leading Democratic strategist 
who was war-gaming this election de-
cided to experiment with what would 
happen if Vice President Biden were to 
lose the election but were to, simply, 
fail to concede. 
Once again, this kind of recklessness 
achieves our adversaries’ missions for 
them. So I urge my colleagues to listen 
to the civil servants who are defending 
our democracy. Let’s stay united, focus 
on the real dangers posed by foreign in-
telligence, and resist the urge to politi-
cize these vital subjects. 
f 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
one final matter, last week, the Senate 
Democratic leader brought an end to 
the additional Federal benefit for un-
employed workers. The Republicans 
tried multiple times to extend the 
money, including at the same dollar 
level that our colleague himself said he 
wanted, but the Democratic leader 
blocked it all. 
This is the dynamic on the Demo-
cratic side that killed the subject of 
police reform back in June, and it has 
now jeopardized more coronavirus re-
lief as well. The Democratic leaders in-
sist publicly that they want an out-
come, but they work alone, behind 
closed doors, to ensure a bipartisan 
agreement is, actually, not reached. 
We are about a week into the Speak-
er’s and the Democratic leader’s dis-
cussions with the administration—a 
week into the Democratic leadership’s 
cutting out all of their Members—all of 
them—cutting out all of their commit-
tees, and saying that only they can 
participate. 
So how is it going? 
Well, the Democratic leader is still 
refusing to let struggling Americans 
get another dime unless he gets a mas-
sive tax cut for the wealthy people in 
blue States that has nothing to do with 
the coronavirus. I am not kidding. This 
is his position. There is nothing for 
schools, nothing for kids, nothing for 
the PPP, nothing for the healthcare 
fight. Nobody gets a dime unless the 
Democratic leader gets a massive tax 
cut for the rich people in New York and 
California. That is what he is saying. 
The Speaker of the House and the 
Democratic leader are continuing to 
say ‘‘our way or the highway’’ with the 
massive wish list for leftwing lobbyists 
they slapped together a few weeks ago 
and called a coronavirus bill—stimulus 
checks for illegal immigrants, diver-
sity studies for the legal pot industry, 
and on and on. 
When they put out this proposal, 
even the media and their fellow Demo-
crats pronounced this thing dead on ar-
rival. 
Here was one report: ‘‘Neither this 
bill nor anything resembling it will 
ever become law—it’s a Democratic 
wish list filled up with all the party’s 
favored policies.’’ 
Remember how Speaker PELOSI’s own 
Members felt about this absurd pro-
posal: ‘‘Privately, several House Demo-
crats concede their latest bill feels like 
little more than an effort to appease 
the most liberal members of the cau-
cus.’’ 
Even 
Democrats 
knew 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s bill was unserious. 
But now, with the additional unem-
ployment benefit disappearing, with 
families still struggling, they are going 
back to this unserious position and re-
fusing to budge. 
I can’t imagine this is how Demo-
cratic colleagues really all want this to 
play out. 
In March, we built the CARES Act by 
Republicans and Democrats working 
together at the committee level. This 
time, again, Republicans introduced a 
serious proposal written by our own 
chairmen and our own Members. But 
this time, the Democratic leader has 
cut Senate Democrats out entirely. He 
has forbidden their committees from 
even talking to Republicans. He is 
digging in on a House messaging bill, 
written with no input from his own 
Members, that even House Democrats 
themselves called absurd. 
These are not the tactics that would 
build a bipartisan result. These are not 
the tactics that will get more cash in 
Americans’ pockets, more help to the 
unemployed, 
more 
assistance 
for 
schools to reopen. 
It is time for the Democratic leader-
ship to get serious about making a 
law—making a law—for the American 
people.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Mark Wesley Menezes, of Vir-
ginia, to be Deputy Secretary of En-
ergy. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic Leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just 
heard the Republican leader speak out 
on the floor. Leader MCCONNELL is busy 
giving partisan speeches while for the 
last 21⁄2 hours Speaker PELOSI, myself, 
Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin, and 
Chief of Staff Meadows were sitting in 
a room working hard, trying to narrow 
our differences and come to an agree-
ment. We all want to come to an agree-
ment. We know the gravity of the situ-
ation demands it. We will continue to 
work and work at it. 
We had a productive meeting. We 
narrowed some differences. Frankly, 
there are many that remain, but we 
must not give up. We must not resort 
to stark partisanship. We must come 
together and find a solution. 
If I had to characterize the major dif-
ference between our side and the Re-
publican side, we believe the gravity of 
the situation—the economic problems, 
the health problems—demands a bold, 
strong, vigorous solution by the Fed-
eral Government. We believe we must 
meet those needs. And it will cost 
money, but mark my words—if we 
spend less money now, it will cost us 
more money later. 
We hear from our schools. They very 
much want to reopen. We hear from the 
parents of children. They very much 
want their kids to go back to school, 
but they want to do it safely. It costs 
a lot of dollars to make a school safe in 
this COVID crisis—not only the money 
for masks and PPE, but you can’t sit 
two kids next to each other on a bus, so 
there have to be many more bus routes. 
Because some of the learning will be 
distant, you need hotspots, and a lot of 
the kids don’t have them in their 
homes. You may need new ventilating 
systems because COVID demands it for 
a healthy classroom. You may need to 
convert gymnasiums and cafeterias 
into new classrooms. Teachers may 
have to teach longer, and we may even 
need more teachers. These are very im-
portant things we need to do to open 
schools safely, but they demand more 
dollars. As we sat in a room today, we 
discussed our views as to how many 
dollars are needed. 
The same thing with food safety—we 
Democrats believe that during this cri-
sis, children and adults should not go 
hungry, and we proposed money to en-
sure that there are SNAP benefit in-
creases to help people to feed them-
selves, that there is enough money to 
feed the kids who used to get school 
breakfasts and lunches, and that there 
is enough money at food banks and 
other places so they can feed their fam-
ilies. That costs money. The Senate 
Republican proposal here proposed a 
tax break for a three-martini lunch and 
a $20 billion slush fund for big agri-
business but no money for these kids 
who need to be fed. That is a signifi-
cant difference. There are many. There 
are many. 
We Democrats believe strongly that 
we have to have free and fair elections 
and that the mail must be delivered in 
a timely way because so many more 
people are going to vote by mail. So 
many polling places need to be set up 
because, with COVID, you can’t be 
close together. 
There is a long list of things that are 
needed. The good news is, our Repub-
lican colleagues agree with a few of 
them, but some they don’t agree with, 
and we are discussing why we think 
they need them, and they will counter 
with us in the room—Mnuchin and 
Meadows. But the discussion is nec-
essary, the discussion is productive, 
and we will continue it. 
Again, the anomaly of the Repub-
lican leader making a partisan speech 
on the floor while we—Speaker PELOSI, 
myself, Mnuchin, and Meadows—are 
trying to negotiate and move forward 
is really a contrast that I think most 
people see. 
So let’s keep moving forward. There 
is a real crisis here. There are people 
who are unemployed, and they don’t 
deserve a pay cut as they go forward. 
There are small businesses that need 
help desperately. There are schools 
that have to open. There are State and 
local governments that must have 
funding. This is not an abstract con-
cept; these are firefighters, our teach-
ers, our healthcare workers, our bus-
drivers and sanitation men and women. 
If the State and local governments 
don’t get money, they are going to be 
laid off, and services will be much 
worse. 
Again, we have a wide disparity on 
what kind of dollars and how to deal 
with treatment. It is our belief that 
this 
administration’s 
program 
on 
treatment has been a failure, that we 
don’t have enough treatment, and that 
we have to redouble our efforts to put 
more money into treatment. 
These discussions are continuing be-
cause we hope we can reach an agree-
ment. We will keep at it and at it and 
at it because the Nation demands a so-
lution—a bold, comprehensive solution 
that will slay this awful virus and its 
consequences once and for all. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF EL PASO SHOOTING 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, 1 
year ago, a gunman stormed into an El 
Paso Walmart and opened fire. There 
were 46 people shot; 23, tragically, died; 
and the devastation in this tight-knit 
community was beyond imagination. 
The heartbreak and confusion quickly 
turned to rage when we learned that 
this out-of-town shooter was a white 
supremacist whose crime could only be 
described as domestic terrorism. 
As my good friend El Paso Mayor Dee 
Margo has said many times over the 
last year, we will not let this evil de-
fine us. He wrote in an op-ed this week-
end: ‘‘El Paso will not be known for 
tragedy but for our strength and grace 
in the midst of tragedy.’’ 
That strength comes to mind when I 
reflect on this terrible anniversary. 
When I visited El Paso the day after 
the shooting, I saw the makeshift me-
morial that was created to honor those 
who died. On that first day, the collec-
tion of photos, flowers, and mementos 
was relatively small—maybe just a few 
feet wide—but by the time I came back 
3 days later, it had grown to over half 
a mile. This massive memorial, the 
long line of folks waiting to donate 
blood, the generous donations made to 
support the victims and their families, 
these were the real reminders of the 
power and resilience of the El Paso 
community. 
As we remember this anniversary 
amidst a pandemic, there will not be 
groups of strangers hugging, crying, or 
holding hands like I witnessed in the 
days following the shooting. Instead, 
we will have socially distanced memo-
rials, like the vigil held yesterday, that 
will allow El Pasoans once again to 
prove that hate will not win. 
Together, we will remember the 23 
lives which were lost 1 year ago, as 
well as those who were wounded, and 
we stand in solidarity with El Paso, a 
border community that has looked 
hate in the eye and unequivocally cho-
sen strength, grace, and love for one 
another. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, with August here 
and the start of school just around the 
corner, school districts, colleges, and 
universities in Texas and Iowa and ev-
erywhere else are in the process of 
making very difficult decisions about 
how to begin the school year. The 
teachers, the professors, the faculty, 
and the administration of these schools

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4656 
August 3, 2020 
are trying to figure the best way to 
keep their students safe but, at the 
same time, provide a quality education 
for all their students. 
As we have seen, there is no one-size- 
fits-all to the coronavirus when it 
comes to public health. Our Nation is 
very diversified, with some highly con-
centrated populations with multigener-
ational families and an international 
travel hub, like New York City, and 
more rural areas where we, fortu-
nately, have not seen the same sort of 
impact that we have in some of these 
concentrated areas. 
So, in a country as big and diverse as 
ours, there has been no one-size-fits-all 
handbook or rubberstamp response. 
With COVID–19 surging in some parts 
of my State and declining in others, de-
cisions, I think, should continue to be 
made 
flexibly, 
which 
means 
they 
should be made locally. Each school 
district or college knows their chal-
lenges, their needs, their capability, 
and the risks better than anyone else 
from the outside—certainly from Wash-
ington, DC—and they should be the 
ones, at the local level, to make the de-
cisions how best to safely proceed. 
Whether the school year kicks off 
with in-person, online, or some com-
bination of the two, one thing that has 
become abundantly clear is that addi-
tional Federal support is needed so 
these schools can safely reopen with 
the proper protections in place. Con-
gress has already provided $30 billion in 
emergency relief for education, includ-
ing more than $2.6 billion for Texas 
alone, which has helped our school dis-
tricts, colleges, and universities pre-
pare for the start of the new year while 
filling some holes left by gaps in tui-
tion that has not been collected be-
cause students have not been studying 
in person. 
Now, this funding can be used to sup-
port things like cleaning services and 
equipment to protect students and 
staff returning to the classroom. It 
could be used for laptops or hot spots 
for virtual learning. 
What we really need is a restoration 
of confidence that people can continue 
to get on with their lives, as we all 
have 
learned 
to 
do, 
by 
socially 
distancing, masking, handwashing, and 
staying home if you are sick. That is 
what each of us can do as individual 
Americans, and that is what students 
can do in their classroom, as deemed 
appropriate by local authorities and 
parents. 
Well, we had a strong start in the re-
sponse to the coronavirus with the leg-
islation that we passed, the repeated 
bills we passed on a bipartisan basis, 
virtually unanimously, but now is not 
the time to take our foot off the gas. 
The Senate must move quickly to pass 
additional relief, not only for our stu-
dents and teachers but for the workers 
and the industries hit hardest by this 
pandemic. 
Think about our healthcare heroes. 
These were the truly essential workers 
who didn’t have the choice to work re-
motely; they had to be on the frontline 
treating the people with the virus. 
We have unemployed workers—peo-
ple who, through no fault of their own, 
continue to not earn a paycheck—and 
small businesses that are struggling. 
Maybe they had a PPP loan and grant 
but now have continued to see their 
businesses harmed by lack of cus-
tomers. Then there are farmers and 
ranchers and other producers, so many 
of whom need us to act and act quick-
ly. 
Now, Congress is not known for act-
ing with speed and dispatch, and at 
most times that is actually probably a 
good thing because you make mistakes 
when you get in a big hurry, but there 
is no reason we can’t come together 
and reach an agreement this week and 
get relief on the way to those who need 
it most. 
The Senate should not recess—we 
should not go back home for the Au-
gust break—until the next coronavirus 
bill is complete. So we really have a 
choice. We can do this the hard way or 
we can do it the commonsense and 
easier way, which is simply to sit 
down, come together, and work our 
way through our differences. We know 
how to do it because we do it all the 
time, and it is the only way anything 
gets done. 
So we need to put the grandstanding 
and the posturing and the rhetoric and 
the politicalization of this pandemic on 
the shelf for the time being. There is 
plenty of time for elections. The elec-
tion is 93 days off from today, but what 
is urgent and what is needed most is 
for us to demonstrate that we can lead 
during a time of crisis. When our con-
stituents, the American people, are in 
pain and hurting and need our help, we 
need to demonstrate we can work our 
differences out and come together and 
respond to that need. 
Despite the immense challenges pre-
sented by the virus, tens of millions of 
essential workers have continued to go 
to work each day because their com-
munities depend on them. We all de-
pend on them. Right now, our country 
is depending on us to do our job, and we 
cannot let them down. 
As school leaders make tough deci-
sions today and continue to assess the 
situation, we need to ensure that they 
have the resources they need to keep 
their students healthy and their edu-
cation on track. 
This is not a zero-sum game. It is not 
one or the other. We have to do both. 
The HEALS Act that was introduced 
by a number of colleagues on this side 
of the aisle included $105 billion for 
education, more than tripling the in-
vestment made in the CARES Act, 
which we passed late in March. The 
majority of that funding goes to K–12 
schools and will support safety meas-
ures for students and also provide bet-
ter access to those studying remotely 
at home. It will bolster the Higher 
Education Emergency Relief Fund with 
an additional $29 billion to ensure that 
colleges and universities can make ac-
commodations not only for learning on 
campus but also the living, eating, and 
the range of other activities that occur 
on university campuses. 
At least 10 percent of that funding is 
dedicated to the historically Black col-
leges and universities and minority- 
serving institutions. 
Keeping Texas children healthy and 
their education on track is a top pri-
ority. It should be a top priority here 
and for all of us, and the next relief bill 
must provide the funding for our stu-
dents and teachers that they need as 
they head into this new territory this 
fall. 
In addition to supporting our chil-
dren going back to school, another 
issue that has reared its head is 
childcare because, for many parents, if 
their children are not studying in 
classrooms, they are studying at home, 
and they need supervision. Many par-
ents who would like to go back to 
work, if they can do so safely, need to 
have childcare available for them to be 
able to do so. 
In 2018, 60 percent of Texas children 
under the age of 6 had all their avail-
able parents in the workforce—60 per-
cent. And prior to COVID–19, many of 
these 
working 
parents 
relied 
on 
daycare so they could go to work. 
Of course, the pandemic has changed 
childcare arrangements for many fami-
lies. Those who have been able to 
telework have often pulled double duty 
as employees and caregivers at the 
same time, and those who, unfortu-
nately, lost their jobs or were laid off 
have stayed home with children until 
they have been able to return to work. 
But, really, childcare will be a huge 
limiting factor for many, many people 
who want to and can safely return to 
work. Now that more businesses are re-
opening, parents are increasingly in 
need of safe, reliable childcare, and 
Congress needs to step up and provide 
relief to childcare providers. 
The HEALS Act authorizes short- 
term assistance to help them so they 
can safely reopen their doors and par-
ents can safely return to work. This is, 
I believe, a key to getting more people 
back to work so we can begin to re-
cover and rebuild our economy. 
This legislation builds on another 
provision in the CARES Act that pro-
vided students student loan relief for 
the more than 43 million Americans 
with student loan debt. It allowed stu-
dents to defer student loan payments 
for up to 6 months with no penalty. I 
have gotten a lot of positive feedback 
on that provision from Texans across 
nearly every part of the State. 
With so much economic uncertainty, 
we can’t allow that provision to expire. 
Student loan debt is a real and growing 
problem in our country, and families 
should never be in the situation where 
they are sacrificing their basic needs 
just to make those student loan pay-
ments, especially during the time of a 
global emergency. 
As we try to find consensus on the 
next coronavirus response package,

there is no room to compromise on sup-
port for our children and teachers. 
Another critical provision of sup-
porting 
our 
schools 
is 
liability 
protections. 
As I mentioned, schools are weighing 
whether to reopen, and they go through 
a long list of considerations. The num-
ber of cases of COVID virus in their 
community, new case trends, the risk 
to student health and teachers, the 
ability to implement relevant health 
guidelines—school leaders are weighing 
all of these factors and more in deter-
mining whether to reopen their doors. 
But even if a school is prepared to take 
every precaution and make a good- 
faith effort to protect the health and 
safety of students and staff, they can 
still face a mountain of lawsuits. 
Let’s say a district has carefully con-
sidered all of these factors and made 
the decision to reopen. They are pre-
pared to implement the CDC guidelines 
and mitigation strategies—things like 
social distancing, masks, handwashing, 
reduced class sizes, and cohorting stu-
dents. They have made changes to the 
bus routes, classroom seating, and 
lunch schedules to accommodate social 
distancing. They have talked to par-
ents about how to identify the symp-
toms of COVID–19 and have planned for 
what they should do if a student or 
staff member tests positive. 
Despite taking every precaution and 
closely 
following 
guidelines, 
the 
schools could still be sued for COVID– 
19 exposure. If a child contracts the 
virus, a parent could file a lawsuit 
blaming the school. Even though it 
would be extremely difficult—if not 
impossible—to prove the school was at 
fault, the district could be drawn into 
a costly court battle to defend itself, 
taking money and time away from 
classrooms needed to teach our chil-
dren. 
In Arizona, this has arisen as a major 
issue. The largest insurer for schools 
announced it will not provide liability 
coverage for COVID–19 claims. Without 
action from Congress, many schools 
may choose not to reopen their doors 
because the risk of expensive litigation 
is simply too high. 
It is not just litigating and losing 
that is such a burden. By litigating, 
you actually can lose even if you win 
the case because of the cost associated 
with defending these cases and the 
time and energy it takes that could be 
expended on educating our children. 
That is why the legislation I have in-
troduced, known as the SAFE Act, 
which is included in the HEALS Act, is 
so important. It will prevent schools 
that make a good-faith effort to safely 
reopen from facing a wave of opportun-
istic litigation. 
It doesn’t provide blanket immunity. 
It actually incentivizes following pub-
lic health guidelines and says that only 
those who engage in willful or grossly 
negligent conduct can be sued and re-
covery sought. But it does spell out in 
black and white that K–12 schools, col-
leges, and universities will be pro-
tected from COVID–19 exposure claims 
as long as they make a good-faith ef-
fort to comply with mandatory public 
health guidelines. 
This is the targeted and temporary 
provision. It expires in 2024. This is not 
an attempt to permanently change the 
tort laws that apply across the board 
but only a targeted provision that ap-
plies to this pandemic. 
Our schools need to know and have 
confidence that if they are operating in 
good faith and obeying guidelines, they 
will not spend the next years in court 
fighting lawsuits. 
In order for our country to recover, 
these workers and institutions need to 
be able to open their doors and to do 
their jobs with confidence. That is pre-
cisely what this legislation will pro-
vide. 
I hope our colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle will join us in providing this 
critical funding and the protections 
our schools need at such a crucial time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
TRIBUTE TO GENERAL DAVID L. GOLDFEIN AND 
CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT KALETH O. WRIGHT 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
recognize and congratulate two of my 
favorite people—Gen. David L. Goldfein 
and CMSAF Kaleth O. Wright on their 
upcoming retirement from the U.S. Air 
Force after a combined 68 years of dis-
tinguished military service to our 
great Nation. 
General Goldfein’s outstanding 37- 
year career has culminated as the 21st 
Chief of Staff of the Air Force. In this 
role, he has been responsible for the or-
ganization, training, and equipping of 
685,000 Active-Duty, Guard, Reserve, 
and Civilian Forces serving all over the 
world. He has been crucial to strength-
ening our national security and has led 
the effort on shaping the Air Force and 
Joint Force of the future. 
General Goldfein launched his career 
at the Air Force Academy. He grad-
uated in 1983 and continued his train-
ing at the United States Air Force 
Weapons School. He would go on to 
earn his command pilot rating, accu-
mulating more than 4,200 flying hours 
in various aircraft, such as the T–37, T– 
38, F–16, F–117, MQ–9, and MC–12. 
He flew combat missions in Oper-
ations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Al-
lied Force and Enduring Freedom. On 
May 2, 1999, while flying a night mis-
sion during Operation Allied Force, 
then 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Goldfein 
found himself in the skies above Serbia 
in his F–16 fighter jet. His mission was 
to bomb targets designed to force the 
Serbian dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, 
to withdraw his troops from Kosovo. 
Things changed rapidly when an air 
missile exploded through the belly of 
his aircraft, forcing him to eject and 
parachute into enemy territory. He 
was quickly rescued in Kosovo by the 
Air Force’s elite combat search and 
rescue team. 
His ability to make sound decisions 
under this extreme pressure and many 
other actions throughout his career are 
why he was the right person to serve as 
Chief of Staff for the past 4 years. Gen-
eral Goldfein epitomizes the finest 
qualities of a military leader. His pas-
sion for the Air Force, the airmen, and 
their families—this certainly is a fam-
ily affair—is unparalleled, and the 
country owes him a debt of gratitude 
for his sacrifice and for his service. 
I would also like to recognize Chief 
Master Sergeant of the Air Force 
Wright for his exceptional 31-year ca-
reer in the U.S. Air Force. For the past 
31⁄2 years, he has served as the senior 
enlisted advisor to the Air Force Chief 
of Staff and the Secretary of the Air 
Force on all issues regarding the wel-
fare, the readiness, the morale, and 
proper utilization and progress of the 
enlisted force. 
After enlisting in the Air Force in 
1989, Chief Wright would go on to serve 
in various duties in the dental career 
field. He deployed in support of Oper-
ations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, 
and Enduring Freedom and completed 
overseas tours in South Korea, Japan, 
Germany, and Alaska. 
As the 18th Chief Master Sergeant of 
the Air Force, his transparent leader-
ship, character, and natural charisma 
built a never-before-seen trust with the 
410,000 enlisted members. Under his 
leadership, improvements were made 
to the enlisted professional military 
education system, enlisted promotion 
system, physical training testing, and 
the enlisted evaluation system. His 
passion for building a resilient force, 
suicide prevention, and diversity and 
inclusion will have lasting positive im-
pacts on the service, the airmen, and 
their families. 
Fittingly, Chief Wright will continue 
to advocate for airmen as the next CEO 
of the Air Force Aid Society. As co-
chair of the Senate Air Force Caucus 
and Chairman of the Appropriations 
subcommittee responsible for ensuring 
our Armed Forces and their families 
have the infrastructure and facilities 
to support their needs, I have met with 
these Air Force leaders on numerous 
occasions during their service, as they 
encouraged congressional support to 
strengthen Air Force priorities and 
military readiness. Airmen can be 
proud of their advocacy and leadership 
to ensure the United States maintains 
our air superiority. 
On behalf of the U.S. Senate, the 
Senate Air Force Caucus, and a grate-
ful nation, I extend my deepest appre-
ciation to General Goldfein, Chief Mas-
ter Sergeant Wright, and their families 
for their many, many years of exem-
plary military service and sacrifice. We 
all wish them nothing but the very 
best in the future. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

S4658 
August 3, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, for 
almost 25 years, the internet has grown 
and thrived under the light-touch regu-
latory framework established by the 
Communications Decency Act. I hope 
we can continue that. I think some 
changes need to be made. 
Passed in 1996, the law that the Com-
munications Decency Act is a part of 
helped create the internet. Section 230 
of that law gives broad liability protec-
tions to interactive computer services, 
such as Facebook, Twitter, and other 
social media platforms. This provision 
protects online platforms from being 
held liable for content posted by their 
users. 
This is a unique protection for online 
platforms, and not everyone in our 
country enjoys those protections. For 
example, newspapers do not enjoy this 
important protection. But we have 
done this for internet platforms. 
At the same time, section 230 of the 
Communications Decency Act allows 
online platforms to censor content that 
they—the platforms—consider obscene, 
lewd, harassing, along with several 
other categories, including the term 
‘‘otherwise objectionable.’’ 
I am concerned that this term, ‘‘oth-
erwise objectionable,’’ is too broad and 
ends up protecting online platforms 
when they remove content that they 
simply disagree with or dislike or find 
distasteful personally. 
I fear section 230 has enabled big tech 
companies to censor conservative views 
and voices, and I am joined by a lot of 
Americans in that view. As such, this 
provision has become a loophole for 
censoring free speech, and it risks ne-
gating the values at the very heart of 
our First Amendment. 
In the last few years, reports of on-
line censorship of conservative view-
points have grown more frequent. In 
early 2018, for example, an undercover 
report exposed Twitter for systemati-
cally ‘‘shadow banning’’ conservative 
profiles—meaning users were blocked 
from the platform without being noti-
fied. 
More recently, Google threatened to 
demonetize a conservative news site, 
The Federalist, for not removing offen-
sive content in their comment section. 
Based upon information I received, the 
comments may indeed have been derog-
atory and unacceptable. But what is 
noteworthy is that Google’s threat to-
ward the Federalist was hyperselective 
and a bit hypocritical. Google held the 
Federalist accountable for comments 
made by the Federalist readers, but 
Google does not want to be held re-
sponsible for the posts or comments by 
users on Google’s platforms, including 
YouTube—a double standard imposed 
by Google itself. This selective scru-
tiny reveals what most Americans al-
ready believe: that tech companies are 
politically biased. 
According to a 2018 Pew study, 7 out 
of 10 Americans believed social media 
companies censor political viewpoints 
that they find objectionable. That was 
2 years ago. It has only worsened in the 
2 years since then. 
These concerns come at a time when 
tech companies wield unprecedented 
power within our economy and our cul-
ture at large, and no one can deny that. 
A bipartisan chorus of committee 
members from the other body pointed 
this out just last week. More and more 
of our daily business is taking place 
online, and that trend is only accel-
erating during the current pandemic. 
As we near the 2020 election, Ameri-
cans 
have 
serious 
concerns 
about 
whether online platforms will treat 
campaigns on both sides of the aisle 
fairly and equally. Those concerns are 
warranted. I have those concerns. 
Americans are right to be worried 
about interference by politically ho-
mogenous tech firms that hold unprec-
edented sway over our Nation’s polit-
ical discourse. 
After 24 years, it is time for Congress 
to revisit section 230 of the Commu-
nications Decency Act and start with 
refining—perhaps narrowing—the scope 
of what counts as otherwise objection-
able content subject to censors. There 
may be other reforms that would be 
better, but I think it is time for Con-
gress and the committee that I chair to 
revisit this section of the law. 
Last 
week, 
the 
Commerce 
Sub-
committee on Communications, Tech-
nology, Innovation, and the Internet 
convened a hearing to consider exactly 
this issue, and it was a very good hear-
ing. As chairman of the Commerce 
Committee, I intend to pursue this 
matter thoroughly and evaluate what 
changes are needed to section 230. Con-
gress needs to ensure that the internet 
remains a forum for a ‘‘true diversity 
of political discourse’’ that promotes 
competition and innovation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
last week, journalists at ESPN pub-
lished the results of a bombshell inves-
tigation into human rights violations 
at NBA training academies in China. 
When you think about a basketball 
camp, you probably think of shooting 
drills or running sprints, but these 
camps look much different. The inves-
tigation focused on training camps lo-
cated in Xinjiang. This particular re-
gion in western China has achieved a 
certain level of notoriety in recent 
months for the horrific political vio-
lence its government officials inflict on 
the Uighur Muslim minority. So it is 
no surprise that the stories told by 
trainers, coaches, and other NBA em-
ployees who helped to run these camps 
employ disturbing and familiar im-
agery. 
According to the ESPN investiga-
tion, one former league employee com-
pared the atmosphere at the Xinjiang 
camp to ‘‘World War II Germany.’’ 
An American coach, who worked at a 
similar facility, described it as a 
‘‘sweat camp for athletes.’’ 
Now, according to the investigation, 
almost immediately after the NBA 
launched this program back in 2016, 
multiple coaches who were staffing the 
camps reported to high-ranking organi-
zation officials that they had witnessed 
Chinese coaches beating and berating 
student athletes. Bear in mind that 
these reports were made in 2016. They 
also reported that the Chinese Com-
munist Party officials who were in 
charge of the camp were denying stu-
dents an education. 
In coming to this elite camp, they 
were to receive both an education and 
elevated sports training, but the re-
ports, going back to 2016, said the chil-
dren were being abused, beaten, be-
rated, and denied the education. So 
why then did the NBA maintain these 
programs? 
Money. 
Communist China plays host to an 
estimated $4 billion NBA market. They 
say that China is basketball-obsessed, 
and NBA execs have used every avenue 
they can to take advantage of that, 
and they jealously protect these rela-
tionships. 
Last October, when Houston Rockets’ 
General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted 
in support of the Hong Kong Freedom 
Fighters, 
multiple 
league 
all-stars, 
stakeholders, and well-connected em-
ployees lashed out in a panic—terrified 
of retaliation from Beijing. 
Team owner and Alibaba co-founder 
Joe Tsai not only sided with the Chi-
nese Communist Party as it retaliated 
against the entire league, but he char-
acterized the Hong Kong protesters as 
leading a separatist movement. 
Their 
over-the-top 
reactions 
are 
proof enough of how fragile the NBA’s 
relationship with China actually is and 
who is really in control of this rela-
tionship. The control is not with the 
NBA. 
In June, I sent a letter to the NBA, 
expressing my concerns about the 
training camps in Xinjiang and the 
league’s entanglement with the Chi-
nese Communist Party. In their re-
sponse, they announced that they had 
closed their facilities in the region and 
that they had severed their ties to any 
programs there. 
The problem is that the ESPN report 
I referenced previously disputes that 
assertion. I am reaching out for clari-
fication on that matter, but in their re-
sponse, I hope NBA officials express 
clarity regarding all—each and every 
one—of their business relationships 
with China because the NBA and other 
organizations that maintain close ties 
to the Chinese Communist Party be-
lieve that they are merely taking ad-
vantage of a growing consumer mar-
ket—or that is what they say. To them,

August 3, 2020 
it is the smart, savvy play. That is 
what they believe. In reality, what 
they are doing is giving the ball away. 
They are playing right into Beijing’s 
hands, and those hands are controlled 
by the Chinese Communist Party. 
Since 2013, the CCP has operated 
under a grand strategy to stretch its 
influence across Europe, Africa, and 
Asia. This strategy is known as—quite 
elegantly, they think—the Belt and 
Road Initiative. It involves making 
interlinked investments over land and 
sea, which has formed the beginnings 
of a modern day Silk Road. 
The Chinese Communist Party uses 
energy and transportation infrastruc-
ture development, as well as access to 
investment capital and trade opportu-
nities, to force its way into the good 
graces of comparatively poor and still- 
developing nations. 
I have seen this influence and its ef-
fects firsthand. Last year, I traveled to 
the Horn of Africa and spent some time 
in Djibouti—a country that welcomed 
China and the Belt and Road Initiative 
investments with open arms. 
China now holds somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 80 percent of that 
country’s national debt. This is 80 per-
cent of its debt that is held by Com-
munist China. The government in 
Djibouti, in turn, agreed to accommo-
date China’s first overseas military 
outpost, grant access to a crucial sea 
lane, and implement the Orwellian 
smart cities program. 
Now, I will tell you, if I asked you to 
picture a modern day surveillance 
state, the chances are the picture that 
would pop into your head would come 
pretty close to being what is happening 
right now in Djibouti City. 
Yet the other thing I saw while in 
Djibouti was its vital strategic impor-
tance to the United States. Our mili-
tary relationship is one that exists on 
the frontlines of great power competi-
tion, and it is essential to continue 
American commitment to and invest-
ment in African partners like Djibouti. 
Wherever AFRICOM headquarters is 
located, we must not lose sight of the 
importance of resourcing the African 
continent for great power competition. 
This is the combatant command that 
consistently proves it can ‘‘do the most 
with the least,’’ and it is a front where 
we can play offense, not defense, 
against two of our major adversaries— 
China and Russia. 
The way China does business makes 
maintaining these relationships incred-
ibly important. The BRI functions be-
hind a veil of secrecy to the tune of 
somewhere between $1 trillion and $8 
trillion in foreign investment. Now, 
think about this. China invests its dol-
lars in the United States. Currently, 
China holds over $1.1 trillion in U.S. 
debt. It does that because Congress has 
the power of the purse, but Congress 
seems to think: Print more money. We 
can issue some debt. We can afford it. 
All the while, China is making money 
off of our debt. Then, with those prof-
its, what is it doing? It is investing in 
countries around the globe. 
As I said, with what we know now 
about the Belt and Road Initiative— 
the digital Silk Road, its push in the 
great power competition—it has now 
spent somewhere between $1 trillion 
and $8 trillion around the globe. Some 
of these countries, like Djibouti, are 
holding 80 percent of the debt in ex-
change for locating a military post, for 
having a naval base, for building out 
its spy network globally. This is what 
it is up to. 
The low-interest loans China offers 
leads 
these 
countries 
into 
unsustainable 
debt 
burdens. 
Some 
countries’ overall debts to China are 
well above 20 percent of their GDPs, 
and many of these loan recipients exist 
on the brink of a debt crisis. When you 
get in a debt crisis—when your debt is 
more than your income—what hap-
pens? The person holding your debt 
does what? We know. The person owns 
you. 
In short, China has set a series of 
‘‘debt traps’’ for smaller, struggling 
countries so they will just go tumbling 
over the cliff. For China, everything is 
going according to plan because that 
dependency translates to control over 
key strategic positions all over the 
globe. 
Yet, pretty soon, if they are not care-
ful, organizations like the NBA, the 
National Basketball Association, will 
be the ‘‘National Beijing Association.’’ 
What is it doing? It is ignoring this. 
Why is it ignoring it? Because it is con-
venient. Why is it convenient? The 
profits look good. It is making money. 
China is basketball-obsessed. Do we 
really think that makes it OK? I have 
to say that it is not OK. 
What the NBA is doing is ignoring 
horrific human rights abuses—abso-
lutely horrific. It is ignoring speech re-
pression. It is ignoring political vio-
lence. It is ignoring religious persecu-
tion. It is doing it all in the name of 
finding its next basketball superstar, 
and it remains willfully blind to the 
manipulation tactics China uses to 
hide these abuses. 
Whether we are talking about debt 
diplomacy or enthusiastic access to a 
willing market, all of it is offered up by 
the Chinese Communist Party as a dis-
traction. 
I have said repeatedly that the 
United States must take immediate 
steps to unravel our relationships with 
China. The rapid and unnecessary 
spread of COVID–19, caused by the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s reckless atti-
tude in the early days of the pandemic, 
is proof enough of how dangerously 
vulnerable we are to the Chinese influ-
ence, but this unraveling cannot occur 
if governments and organizations alike 
refuse to acknowledge what the Amer-
ican people know to be true, which is 
that we had a real chance to keep 
China in check, but we missed the op-
portunity.

ESPN INVESTIGATION FINDS COACHES AT NBA 
CHINA ACADEMIES COMPLAINED OF PLAYER 
ABUSE, LACK OF SCHOOLING 
(By Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wada) 
Long before an October tweet in support of 
Hong Kong protesters spotlighted the NBA’s 
complicated relationship with China, the 
league faced complaints from its own em-
ployees over human rights concerns inside 
an NBA youth-development program in that 
country, an ESPN investigation has found. 
American coaches at three NBA training 
academies in China told league officials their 
Chinese partners were physically abusing 
young players and failing to provide school-
ing, even though commissioner Adam Silver 
had said that education would be central to 
the program, according to multiple sources 
with direct knowledge of the complaints. 
The NBA ran into myriad problems by 
opening one of the academies in Xinjiang, a 
police state in western China where more 
than a million Uighur Muslims are now held 
in barbed-wire camps. American coaches 
were frequently harassed and surveilled in 
Xinjiang, the sources said. One American 
coach was detained three times without 
cause; he and others were unable to obtain 
housing because of their status as foreigners. 
A former league employee compared the 
atmosphere when he worked in Xinjiang to 
‘‘World War II Germany.’’ 
In an interview with ESPN about its find-
ings, NBA deputy commissioner and chief op-
erating officer Mark Tatum, who oversees 
international operations, said the NBA is 
‘‘reevaluating’’ and ‘‘considering other op-
portunities’’ 
for 
the 
academy 
program, 
which operates out of sports facilities run by 
the Chinese government. Last week, the 
league acknowledged for the first time it had 
closed the Xinjiang academy, but, when 
pressed, Tatum declined to say whether 
human rights were a factor. 
‘‘We were somewhat humbled,’’ Tatum said 
of the academy project in China. ‘‘One of the 
lessons that we’ve learned here is that we do 
need to have more direct oversight and the 
ability to make staffing changes when appro-
priate.’’ 
In October, Houston Rockets general man-
ager Daryl Morey’s tweet in support of pro- 
democracy protesters led the Chinese gov-
ernment to pull the NBA from state tele-
vision, costing the league hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars. The controversy continues 
to reverberate, as the NBA prepares to re-
sume play this week after a 41⁄2-month hiatus 
because of the coronavirus pandemic. China 
Central TV recently said it still won’t air 
NBA games, and U.S. lawmakers have raised 
questions about the league’s business ties to 
China. 
The ESPN investigation, which began after 
Morey’s tweet, sheds new light on the lucra-
tive NBA-China relationship and the costs of 
doing business with a government that sup-
presses free expression and is accused of cul-
tural genocide. It illustrates the challenges 
of operating in a society with markedly dif-
ferent approaches to issues such as dis-
cipline, education and security. The report-
ing is based on interviews with several 
former NBA employees with direct knowl-
edge of the league’s activities in China, par-
ticularly the player-development program.

The program, launched in 2016, is part of 
the NBA’s strategy to develop local players 
in a basketball-obsessed market that has 
made NBA China a $5 billion enterprise. 
Most of the former employees spoke on the 
condition of anonymity because they feared 
damaging their chances for future employ-
ment. NBA officials asked current and 
former employees not to speak with ESPN 
for this story. In an email to one former 
coach, a public relations official added: 
‘‘Please don’t mention that you have been 
advised by the NBA not to respond.’’ 
One American coach who worked for the 
NBA in China described the project as ‘‘a 
sweat camp for athletes.’’ 
At least two coaches left their positions in 
response to what they believed was mistreat-
ment of young players. 
One requested and received a transfer after 
watching Chinese coaches strike teenage 
players, three sources told ESPN. Another 
American coach left before the end of his 
contract because he found the lack of edu-
cation in the academies unconscionable: ‘‘I 
couldn’t continue to show up every day, 
looking at these kids and knowing they 
would end up being taxi drivers,’’ he said. 
Not long after the academies opened, mul-
tiple coaches complained about the physical 
abuse and lack of schooling to Greg Stolt, 
the league’s vice president for international 
operations for NBA China, and to other 
league officials in China, the sources said. It 
was unclear whether the information was 
passed on to NBA officials in New York, they 
said. The NBA declined to make Stolt avail-
able for comment. 
Two of the former NBA employees sepa-
rately told ESPN that coaches at the acad-
emies regularly speculated about whether 
Silver had been informed about the prob-
lems. ‘‘I said, ‘If [Silver] shows up, we’re all 
fired immediately,’ ’’ one of the coaches said. 
Tatum said the NBA received ‘‘a handful’’ 
of complaints that Chinese coaches had mis-
treated young players and immediately in-
formed local authorities that the league had 
‘‘zero tolerance’’ for behavior that was 
‘‘antithetical to our values.’’ Tatum said the 
incidents were not reported at the time to 
league officials in New York, including him-
self or Silver. 
‘‘I will tell you that the health and 
wellness of academy athletes and everyone 
who participates in our program is of the ut-
most priority,’’ Tatum said. 
Tatum identified four separate incidents, 
though he said only one was formally re-
ported in writing by an NBA employee. On 
three of the occasions, the coaches reported 
witnessing or hearing about physical abuse. 
The fourth incident involved a player who 
suffered from heat exhaustion. 
‘‘We did everything that we could, given 
the limited oversight we had,’’ Tatum said. 
Three sources who worked for the NBA in 
China told ESPN the physical abuse by Chi-
nese coaches was much more prevalent than 
the incidents Tatum identified. 
The NBA brought in elite coaches and ath-
letic trainers with experience in the G 
League and Division I basketball to work at 
the academies. One former coach described 
watching a Chinese coach fire a ball into a 
young player’s face at point-blank range and 
then ‘‘kick him in the gut.’’ 
‘‘Imagine you have a kid who’s 13, 14 years 
old, and you’ve got a grown coach who is 40 
years old hitting your kid,’’ the coach said. 
‘‘We’re part of that. The NBA is part of 
that.’’ 
It is common for Chinese coaches to dis-
cipline players physically, according to sev-
eral people with experience in player devel-
opment in China. ‘‘For most of the older gen-
eration, even my grandparents, they take 
corporal punishment for granted and even 
see it as an expression of love and care, but 
I know it might be criticized by people living 
outside of China,’’ said Jinming Zheng, an 
assistant professor of sports management at 
Northumbria University in England, who 
grew up in mainland China and has written 
extensively about the Chinese sports system. 
‘‘The older generation still sees it as an inte-
gral part of training.’’ 
In 2012, the NBA hired Bruce Palmer to 
work as technical director at a private bas-
ketball school in Dongguan in southern 
China, a program that predated the acad-
emies. The school has a sponsorship agree-
ment that pays the NBA nearly $200,000 a 
year and allows the school to bill itself as an 
‘‘NBA Training Center.’’ 
Palmer spent five years in Dongguan and 
said he repeatedly warned Chinese coaches 
not to hit, kick or throw balls at children. 
After one incident, he said he told a coach: 
‘‘You can’t do that to your kid, this is an 
NBA training center. If you really feel like 
hitting a 14-year-old boy, and you think it’s 
going to help him or make you feel better, 
take him off campus, but not here, because 
the NBA does not allow this.’’ 
Palmer said the school’s headmaster told 
him that hitting kids has ‘‘been proven to be 
effective as a teaching tool.’’ 
The issue was so prevalent in the NBA 
academies that coaches repeatedly asked 
NBA China officials, including Stolt, for di-
rection on how to handle what they saw as 
physical abuse, according to three sources. 
The coaches were told to file written reports 
to the NBA office in Shanghai. One coach 
said he encountered no more issues after fil-
ing a report, but the others said the abuse 
continued. 
‘‘We weren’t responsible for the local 
coaches, we didn’t have the authority,’’ 
Tatum said. ‘‘We don’t have oversight of the 
local coaches, of the academic programs or 
the living conditions. It’s fair to say we were 
less involved than we wanted to be.’’ 
With a population four times the size of 
the U.S., China is an exploding market for 
the NBA. The league’s soaring revenues were 
propelled in part by the success of former 
Rockets center Yao Ming, who retired in 
2011. 
Tatum said the league sought advice from 
Yao and other experts in China on the devel-
opment of its academy program. He also said 
NBA China’s board of directors was briefed 
on the planning and placement of the three 
academies, including Xinjiang, adding that 
ESPN holds a seat on the board. An ESPN 
spokesperson said the network ‘‘is a non-vot-
ing board observer and owns a small stake’’ 
in NBA China, declining any further com-
ment. (Games are streamed in China by 
internet giant Tencent, which also has a 
partnership with ESPN.) 
Launching the academies had a primary 
goal for NBA bosses: ‘‘Find another Yao,’’ 
according to two of the former employees 
who spoke with ESPN. 
When Silver announced the plan to open 
three league-run academies in China in 2016, 
he said the goal was to train elite athletes 
‘‘holistically.’’ 
‘‘Top international prospects will benefit 
from a complete approach to player develop-
ment that combines NBA quality coaching, 
training and competition with academics 
and personal development,’’ Silver said. 
The league’s news release announcing the 
academies said, ‘‘The initiative will employ 
a holistic, 360-degree approach to player de-
velopment with focuses on education, leader-
ship, character development and life skills.’’ 
The NBA employees who spoke with ESPN 
said many of the league’s problems stemmed 
from the decision to embed the academies in 
government-run sports facilities. The facili-
ties gave the NBA access to existing infra-
structure and elite players, Tatum said. But 
the arrangement put NBA activities under 
the direction of Chinese officials who se-
lected the players and helped define the 
training. 
‘‘We were basically working for the Chi-
nese government,’’ one former coach said. 
After his work in the NBA-sponsored facil-
ity in Dongguan, the league hired Palmer to 
evaluate the academies. He concluded the 
program was ‘‘fundamentally flawed.’’ Palm-
er said it not only put NBA employees under 
Chinese authority but also prevented the 
league from working with China’s most elite 
players. 
In hindsight, Tatum said, the NBA might 
have been ‘‘a little bit naive’’ to believe the 
structure gave the league sufficient over-
sight. 
In Xinjiang, players lived in cramped dor-
mitories; the rooms were meant for two peo-
ple, but a former coach said bunk beds were 
used to put as many as eight to 10 athletes 
in a room. Players trained two or three 
times a day and had few extracurricular ac-
tivities. NBA coaches and officials became 
concerned that although education had been 
announced as a pillar of the academy pro-
gram, the sports bureaus did not provide for-
mal schooling. When the players—some as 
young as 13—weren’t training, eating or 
sleeping, they were often left unsupervised. 
One coach said league officials who visited 
China seemed to be caught off-guard when 
they learned that players in the NBA acad-
emies did not attend school. 
The NBA was able to work out an arrange-
ment by which players at the academy in 
Zhejiang would be educated at a local inter-
national school. But similar efforts in 
Xinjiang and Shandong were unsuccessful. 
Tatum said Chinese officials told the NBA 
that players at the academies would take 
classes six days a week in subjects such as 
English, math and sports psychology. He 
said when NBA employees later raised ques-
tions about whether the kids were in school, 
the Chinese officials reassured them they 
were. 
But two former league employees said they 
complained directly to Stolt, who’s based in 
Shanghai, that the players under their su-
pervision were not in school. 
Within the past month, as the NBA pre-
pared to resume play in Florida, it began to 
face new questions about its relationship 
with China. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R– 
Tenn., and Sen. Josh Hawley, R–Mo., sent 
separate letters to Silver questioning why 
the NBA is promoting social justice at home 
while ignoring China’s abuses. The letters 
came shortly after China announced a new 
national security law in Hong Kong that 
gives authorities sweeping powers to crack 
down on pro-Democracy protesters. Sen. Ted 
Cruz, R–Texas, also recently sparred on 
Twitter with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban 
over China. 
Hawley’s letter challenged the NBA for ex-
cluding messages supporting human rights in 
China among statements that players can 
wear on their jerseys. The approved mes-
sages are limited to social justice and the 
Black Lives Matter movement. 
‘‘Given the NBA’s troubled history of ex-
cusing and apologizing for the brutal repres-
sion of the Chinese Communist regime, these 
omissions are striking,’’ Hawley wrote in the 
letter, which was sent to media members. 
One 
recipient, 
ESPN 
reporter 
Adrian 
Wojnarowski, replied with a profanity, which 
Hawley then tweeted out to his 235,000 fol-
lowers. ESPN and Wojnarowski issued sepa-
rate apologies, and the reporter was sus-
pended for two weeks without pay. 
In Xinjiang, the NBA opened an academy 
in a region notorious for human rights 
abuses.

August 3, 2020 
In recent years, the Chinese government 
has escalated its use of high-tech surveil-
lance, restricted freedom of movement and 
erected mass internment facilities, which 
the government describes as vocational 
training centers and critics describe as con-
centration camps holding ethnic minorities, 
particularly Uighur Muslims. The govern-
ment says the policy is necessary to combat 
terrorism. In September, the United States 
joined more than 30 countries in condemning 
‘‘China’s horrific campaign of repression’’ 
against the Uighurs. Reports of separatist vi-
olence and Chinese government repression in 
Xinjiang go back decades. 
Tatum said the NBA wasn’t aware of polit-
ical tensions or human rights issues in 
Xinjiang when it announced it was launching 
the training academy there in 2016. 
In the spring of 2018, the U.S. began consid-
ering sanctions against China over human 
rights concerns there, and the issue became 
the subject of increasing media coverage 
within the United States. In August 2018, 
Slate published an article under the head-
line: ‘‘Why is the NBA in Xinjiang? The 
league is running a training center in the 
middle of one of the world’s worst humani-
tarian atrocities.’’ 
Later, the NBA would receive criticism 
from congressional leaders, but it never ad-
dressed the concerns or said anything about 
the status of the facility until last week. 
Sometime shortly after Morey’s October 
tweet, the academy webpage was taken 
down. 
Pressed by ESPN, Tatum repeatedly avoid-
ed questions on whether the widespread 
human rights abuses in Xinjiang played a 
role in closing the academy, instead citing 
‘‘many factors.’’ 
‘‘My job, our job is not to take a position 
on every single human rights violation, and 
I’m not an expert in every human rights sit-
uation or violation,’’ Tatum said. ‘‘I’ll tell 
you what the NBA stands for: The values of 
the NBA are about respect, are about inclu-
sion, are about diversity. That is what we 
stand for.’’ 
Nury Turkel, a Uighur American activist 
who has been heavily involved in lobbying 
the U.S. government on Uighur rights, told 
ESPN before the NBA said it had left 
Xinjiang that he believed the league had 
been indirectly legitimizing ‘‘crimes against 
humanity.’’ 
One former league employee who worked 
in China wondered how the NBA, which has 
been so progressive on issues around Black 
Lives Matter and moved the 2017 All-Star 
Game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, over 
a law requiring transgender people to use 
bathrooms corresponding to the sex listed on 
their birth certificates, could operate a 
training camp amid a Chinese government 
crackdown that also targeted NBA employ-
ees. 
‘‘You can’t have it both ways,’’ the former 
employee said. ‘‘. . .You can’t be over here 
in February promoting Black History Month 
and be over in China, where they’re in reedu-
cation camps and all the people that you’re 
partnering with are hitting kids.’’ 
Tatum said the NBA ‘‘has a long history 
and our values are about inclusion and re-
spect and bridging cultural divides. That is 
what we stand for and that is who we are as 
an organization. We do think that engage-
ment is the best way to bridge cultural di-
vides, the best way to grow the game across 
borders.’’ 
The repression in Xinjiang is aimed pri-
marily at Uighurs, but foreigners also have 
been harassed. One American coach said he 
was stopped by police three times in 10 
months. Once, he was taken to a station and 
held for more than two hours because he 
didn’t have his passport at the time. Because 
of the security restrictions, foreigners were 
told they were not allowed to rent housing in 
Xinjiang; most lived at local hotels. 
Tatum said the league wasn’t aware any of 
its employees had been detained or harassed 
in Xinjiang. 
Most of the players who trained at the 
NBA’s Xinjiang academy were Uighurs, but 
it was unclear to league employees who 
spoke with ESPN if any were impacted by 
the government crackdown. 
After returning from Xinjiang last fall, 
Corbin Loubert, a strength coach who joined 
the NBA after stints at the IMG Academy in 
Florida and The Citadel, posted a CNN story 
on Twitter describing how the network’s re-
porters faced surveillance and intimidation 
in Xinjiang. 
‘‘I spent the past year living in Xinjiang, 
and can confirm every word of this piece is 
true,’’ Loubert tweeted. ‘‘One of the biggest 
challenges was not only the discrimination 
and harassment I faced,’’ he added, ‘‘but 
turning a blind eye to the discrimination and 
harassment that the Uyghur people around 
me faced.’’ 
Loubert declined several interview re-
quests from ESPN. 
In a bipartisan letter to Silver last October 
after Morey’s tweet, eight U.S. legislators— 
including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D– 
N.Y., and Cruz—called for the NBA to ‘‘re-
evaluate’’ the Xinjiang academy in response 
to ‘‘a massive, government-run campaign of 
ethno-religious repression.’’ 
Even though the NBA now says it had left 
Xinjiang in the spring of 2019, the league did 
not respond to the letter. The Xinjiang acad-
emy webpage disappeared soon after. 
Last week, in response to Sen. Blackburn 
of Tennessee, the league wrote, ‘‘The NBA 
has had no involvement with the Xinjiang 
basketball academy for more than a year, 
and the relationship has been terminated.’’ 
John Pomfret, whose 2016 book, ‘‘The 
Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom’’ 
covers the history of the U.S.-China relation-
ship, called the decision to put an academy 
in Xinjiang ‘‘a huge mistake’’ that made the 
NBA ‘‘party to a massive human rights vio-
lation.’’ 
‘‘Shutting it down was probably the smart-
est thing to do,’’ he said. ‘‘But you can clear-
ly understand from the NBA’s point of view 
why they wouldn’t want to make an an-
nouncement: Then you’re just rubbing Chi-
na’s nose in it. What would you say, ‘We’re 
leaving because of human rights concerns?’ 
That’s worse than Morey’s tweet.’’ 
Tatum said the league decided to end its 
involvement with the Xinjiang facility be-
cause it ‘‘didn’t have the authority, or the 
ability to take direct action against any of 
these local coaches, and we ultimately con-
cluded 
that 
the 
program 
there 
was 
unsalvageable.’’ 
Tatum said the NBA informed its coaches 
in Xinjiang that the league planned to cease 
operations, and coaches were then ‘‘moved 
out.’’ But when Tatum was told that mul-
tiple sources had told ESPN that the NBA 
never informed the coaches of its plans to 
close Xinjiang, Tatum said he wasn’t actu-
ally sure what conversations had taken 
place. 
Two sources disputed that the NBA had 
any plans to leave Xinjiang in the spring of 
2019. One coach said the league was still 
seeking other coaches to move there well 
into the summer and that the league’s state-
ment to Blackburn was ‘‘completely inac-
curate.’’ 
‘‘They were still trying to get people to go 
out there,’’ the coach said. ‘‘It didn’t end be-
cause [Tatum] said, ‘We’re gonna end this.’ ’’ 
‘‘They probably finally said, ‘Why are we 
doing this?’ ’’ he continued. ‘‘Like we told 
them from the start, ‘Why do we need to be 
here? We’re the NBA, there’s no reasons for 
us to be here.’’ 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MARK WESLEY MENEZES 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
have come to the floor this afternoon 
to encourage Senators to support the 
nomination that is now pending before 
us. This is for Mark Menezes to be the 
Deputy Secretary of the Department of 
Energy. 
I have had plenty of opportunity to 
be working with Mr. Menezes, as he has 
been with the Department of Energy 
for quite some time. 
He originally hails from Louisiana. 
He earned his undergraduate and law 
degrees at Louisiana State University. 
He has, as I mentioned, considerable 
experience in the energy sector and 
here on Capitol Hill. He previously 
served as chief counsel for energy and 
environment on the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee. So he has been 
around for a fair period of time. 
But more recently, for the past 3 
years now, Mr. Menezes has served as 
the Department’s Under Secretary of 
Energy, and in that role, he has been 
responsible for many programs that 
help drive the innovation within the 
Department, including for renewable 
energy, as well as nuclear energy. 
Mr. Menezes also helped create the 
Department’s 
cybersecurity 
office, 
which is dedicated to protecting our 
energy infrastructure from what has 
become very sophisticated and near- 
constant threats. 
As Members may recall, the Senate 
confirmed Mr. Menezes to his current 
role by voice vote. I believe he has ex-
celled as the Under Secretary of En-
ergy. He has helped to set the policy di-
rection of the Department. He has 
worked with many of us on issues that 
are important to our States and to the 
country as a whole. 
I am also confident that Mr. Menezes 
will be a great second-in-command for 
Secretary Brouillette. We held Mr. 
Menezes’s nomination hearing back on 
May 20. This was our first hearing that 
we had held after several months lost 
due to the pandemic. 
Mr. Menezes did, not surprisingly, 
very, very well. He demonstrated his 
knowledge of the issues; he showed us 
that he understands what it takes to 
help lead the Department; and that en-
abled us to report his nomination to 
the full Senate with overwhelming bi-
partisan support. 
So we are sitting here now—it has 
been nearly a 2-month delay—and I am 
very pleased that we are about to vote 
on Mr. Menezes’s nomination. It is 
really key. It is very important that

Secretary Brouillette has his leader-
ship team in place, and Mr. Menezes 
has demonstrated that he has the 
knowledge and the experience needed 
to succeed as Deputy Secretary. 
So I appreciate, and I have shared 
this with Mr. Menezes, his willingness 
to serve our country in a new and a 
higher capacity, particularly as we 
seek to harness the Department’s capa-
bilities to overcome and recover from 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I thank the majority leader for bring-
ing up his nomination. I would urge 
every Member to vote in favor of it on 
cloture today and on confirmation to-
morrow. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, before I yield the floor 
to my friend and colleague, the rank-
ing member on the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee, I want to take 
just a very, very, very brief moment 
and urge us, at this moment, on the 3rd 
of August, as we are commencing this 
workweek here, where the expectation 
from people from Alaska to West Vir-
ginia and all points in between is that 
this Congress is going to come together 
to be responsive to the needs of the 
most vulnerable in this country right 
now—the vulnerability that has come 
about because of a global health pan-
demic and the ensuing economic crisis 
that we see now. 
I spent the weekend back home in 
Alaska. I heard the concerns and the 
fears of so many for whom things are 
not getting better. Things are looking 
worse, and it is bleak. As of today, in 
the State’s largest city, the mayor has 
recognized that with the numbers in-
creasing as they are, we need to go 
back to the hunker-down mode. So res-
taurants and bars are shutting down 
again—just after they thought, with 
some level of optimism, they would be 
able to bring folks back into work, 
they would be able to fill up the freez-
ers and get the produce and get the 
great salmon that is coming in off the 
streams and serve up some great meals. 
That is not happening. 
So that economic picture in our larg-
est community is bleaker and bleaker. 
And for those who wake up and know 
that today is the day that they have to 
pay the mortgage, they have to pay the 
rent, and they don’t know what level of 
assistance is going to be coming from 
their Congress—they do know, though, 
that the unemployment benefits that 
they 
had 
received, 
the 
plussed-up 
amount, that that is not on the horizon 
for them. 
They do know that school is opening 
up in 20 days, and there is uncertainty 
with how the schools are going to safe-
ly open up for the children and for the 
faculty, the teachers, the janitors, how 
they are going to make that work. 
And, oh, by the way, if this is a sched-
ule where the kids are only in class for 
a couple days a week, for a shorter 
time period, how do I deal with the 
struggles 
and 
the 
challenges 
of 
childcare? 
The folks at the food bank whom I 
met with over the weekend who are so 
concerned about the food security 
issues, for them, recognizing that a 
plus-up in SNAP may be—may be what 
gets that family through from week to 
week. 
This is not the time for us to figure 
out what every one of us wants because 
this is the must-pass bill in this Con-
gress. It is a must-pass bill. But we 
have to recognize that this can’t be 
about what we need, what I might need 
for my election, or what I might want 
to advance as a legacy piece. This 
needs to be about those for whom the 
anxiety and the—just the awful place 
they are in right now; that they know 
we have been responsive to them; that 
we are addressing the immediacy of 
now. 
So whether it is what we do with un-
employment insurance, whether it is 
what 
we 
do 
with 
food 
security, 
childcare, a longer term PPP program 
that will help our businesses, the 
short-term 
assistances—but 
under-
standing what it means for the longer 
term—the delay here only hurts the 
most vulnerable. 
So I am urging all of us, let’s come 
together, let’s work with our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
let’s work with our colleagues over in 
the House, because people in my State 
are hurting, and they are expecting us 
to respond. 
With that, I know that Senator 
MANCHIN wished to speak to the nomi-
nation of Mr. Menezes. I appreciate his 
good work on the committee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous to be able to complete my 
remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MARK WESLEY MENEZES 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the Mark Menezes 
nomination to be Deputy Secretary of 
Energy. 
I agree wholeheartedly with our 
chairwoman for Energy and Natural 
Resources. We have a great working re-
lationship, and we have a good friend-
ship that means more than anything to 
me. 
But, basically, every now and then 
you get a person who comes before you 
that you know they are there for the 
good of the public. They are truly pub-
lic servants, not for private service. 
So this person comes across with so 
much expertise. That is going to play 
an important role in our national de-
fense and our energy and economic se-
curity and our science and research 
and even in fighting the ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic and helping to re-
build our economy. 
The Deputy Secretary plays a central 
role in all of these efforts, and I believe 
that Mr. Menezes is up to the task. 
The Deputy Secretary is the second 
highest ranking officer in the Depart-
ment of Energy and the Department’s 
chief operating officer on top of that. 
He is responsible for managing the De-
partment’s wide-ranging mission and a 
budget of over $35 billion dollars—$35- 
billion-dollar budget. 
The DOE and its labs can also play a 
vital role in supporting the scientific 
research and development needed to re-
build our economy. 
In addition, the Department is re-
sponsible for maintaining the Nation’s 
nuclear weapons stockpile, overseeing 
the four power marketing administra-
tions, and ensuring our energy security 
and protecting the Nation’s energy sec-
tor from cyber attacks, among other 
things. 
As the Department’s second highest 
ranking officer and its chief operating 
office, 
the 
Deputy 
Secretary 
nec-
essarily plays a critical role in all of 
these important functions. 
Mr. Menezes brings an impressive 
background to the job. Thirty years 
ago, he was counsel to our former col-
league Senator John Breaux; 15 years 
ago, he was chief counsel to the House 
Energy and Commerce and played a 
major role in shaping the Energy Pol-
icy Act of 2005. 
He has held senior posts at the Amer-
ican Electric Power Company, the 
Hunton and Williams law firm, and 
Berkshire Hathaway Energy. 
Most importantly, though, for the 
past 3 years, he has served as the Under 
Secretary of Energy. As the Under Sec-
retary of Energy, Mr. Menezes has 
shown he is up to the task and capable 
of handling the job of Deputy Sec-
retary. 
I think that he truly, clearly, dem-
onstrated his knowledge and his firm 
grasp of the wide range of important 
issues before the Department during 
the confirmation hearing, and I am 
happy to support his nomination in the 
most bipartisan way. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, I would also like to 
make a few comments on what my 
good friend Senator MURKOWSKI from 
Alaska said. 
People are depending on us. This is 
not time to have political battles. Peo-
ple are hurting in West Virginia; they 
are hurting in Arkansas; they are hurt-
ing all over. The uncertainty hurts 
them more than anything else. We 
have to make sure that we understand 
this is a health crisis. 
A health crisis needs to have its at-
tention. We can’t be closing hospitals 
in the middle of a health crisis. I have 
three rural hospitals that closed. We 
have to make sure that they stay open 
to fight the fight. Also, I am certain of 
one point. Unemployment is not going 
to come back full force until people 
know they have a vaccine or an anti-
body that will protect them from a 
fatal disease. They are concerned and 
worried about that. 
With that being said, right now they 
are asking us to continue on for the 
next 
5 
months. 
We 
don’t 
have 
connectivity. You talk about telework, 
distance learning, telehealth. They 
can’t have any of this if they can’t con-
nect. So we have to make sure that one

major infrastructure project has to be 
connectivity—broadband 
and 
high 
speed. We have been working on hot 
spots just to get through these 5 
months. 
There are things we agree on. Demo-
crats and Republicans are coming to-
gether as Americans. We agree. We 
would like to help. They are just argu-
ing over amounts and this and that and 
the other. 
The bottom line is that we have to 
agree on what we can agree on and 
meet the needs of the people on the 
frontlines. That is the most important 
thing. So I whole-heartedly engage in 
any type of bipartisan cooperation or 
bipartisan talks that we can move 
along to show people that we can put 
the needs of the public above the par-
tisan divide that we have here and have 
had for a long time—since I have been 
here—and for decades. 
I am happy to support Mr. Menezes, 
and I appreciate the bipartisan support 
we have for him. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

ate proceed to legislative session for a 
period of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

(At the request of Mr. MCCONNELL,

f 
TRIBUTE TO THOMAS L. BOWLIN 
∑ Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Thomas L. 
Bowlin, Colonel, USAF, Ret., who in 
addition to a distinguished career in 
the U.S. Air Force, has served as the 
first Director of Government Affairs 
for the North Carolina National Guard. 
I thank him for his many years of serv-
ice to the great State of North Caro-
lina and our great Nation. 
Colonel Bowlin began his military 
career with the U.S. Air Force in 1975. 
He has served across the United States, 
as well as in Germany, Hawaii, Paki-
stan, and Alaska. He was the first 
USAF officer to attend Pakistan’s War 
College and served in a number of key 
assignments with increasing levels of 
responsibility. 
Following his retirement from the 
U.S. Air Force in 2001, Colonel Bowlin 
continued his dedication to service by 
beginning a second career and becom-
ing the first Director of Government 
Affairs for the North Carolina National 
Guard. He served as an essential com-
ponent of North Carolina National 
Guard leadership for nearly two dec-
ades where he has advised the adjutant 
general directly and interfaced with 
local, State, and Federal officials. 
Colonel Bowlin has served roughly 
11,500 citizen soldiers and airmen in the 
North Carolina Army and Air National 
Guard 
through 
many 
deployments 
overseas and harrowing natural disas-
ters at home. Tom’s contribution to 
advancing the overall readiness and 
operational capabilities of the North 
Carolina National Guard has been vital 
in maintaining an effective and resil-
ient reserve force. Through operations 
including Inherent Resolve, Enduring 
Freedom, and Freedom’s Sentinel, as 
well as during Hurricanes Irene, Mat-
thew, Florence, and Dorian, Colonel 
Bowlin has ensured that the men and 
women of the Guard had the utmost 
preparation of every mission that they 
embarked upon. 
Colonel Bowlin has worked tirelessly 
on a number of both Federal, State, 
and local priorities and policy reforms 
for the North Carolina National Guard. 
Just to name a few, these range from 
appropriations for facilities, programs, 
and assets, family readiness, GI Bill 
transferability, TRICARE expansion, 
tuition assistance, occupational licens-
ing, rental agreement protections, and 
many more, which will continue to 
benefit 
National 
Guard 
servicemembers and their families for 
years to come. 
As a U.S. Senator, a member of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, 
and a North Carolinian, I am pleased to 
congratulate Colonel Bowlin on his re-
tirement from the North Carolina Na-
tional Guard and for his impressive ca-
reer of military service and steadfast 
commitment to our country.∑

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak on the National Defense 
Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act provides crucial resources for our 
Armed Forces and our national de-
fense, including a pay increase for our 
men and women in uniform. I am glad 
that the Senate was able to come to-
gether on a bipartisan basis to pass 
this 
legislation 
to 
support 
our 
servicemembers, strengthen our na-
tional security, and invest in critical 
projects in my home State of Mary-
land. While there are parts of this leg-
islation that I do not support and will 
seek to change in conference, I believe 
that, on balance, this bill serves our 
national interest. 
In particular, I am pleased that this 
NDAA grants expanded acquisition au-
thority 
for 
U.S. 
Cyber 
Command,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4664 
August 3, 2020 
headquartered at Fort Meade. I echo 
the comments of the Armed Services 
Committee in its report, which finds 
that Cyber Command’s expanded mis-
sion and responsible use of its acquisi-
tion authority justify the removal of 
the constraints imposed by the FY16 
NDAA. 
I appreciate that my colleagues on 
the Senate Armed Services Committee 
adopted Senator WARREN’s amendment 
directing the Pentagon to begin the 
process of renaming military bases 
named for Confederate soldiers. No 
American military installations should 
be named in honor of those who led the 
fight against the union to defend slav-
ery. 
I also want to note my gratitude to 
Chairman INHOFE and Ranking Member 
REED and their staffs for working with 
me to include relief for the family of 
Lieutenant Richard W. Collins III. Lt. 
Collins’ tragic death was made even 
more painful for his family through the 
challenges they faced in receiving the 
proper benefits and recognition for 
their son. Nothing will ever fill the 
void of their loss, but I am hopeful that 
this provision brings the Collins family 
some peace of mind. 
Additionally, it is worth highlighting 
for the record that the House NDAA in-
cluded a provision extending the review 
period of the World War I valor medals 
review authorized by section 584 of last 
year’s NDAA. The Valor Medals Review 
Task Force has worked tirelessly to 
identify the service records of World 
War I veterans who may have been 
passed over for the Medal of Honor on 
the basis of race or ethnicity. Unfortu-
nately, the COVID–19 pandemic has 
limited their access to research mate-
rials and necessitated an extension for 
them to complete their work. I encour-
age the conferees to retain the House’s 
provision granting this extension. 
While I am pleased with many of the 
provisions included in this bill and 
voted for its passage, I do have signifi-
cant reservations. 
I am deeply disappointed that this 
bill authorizes full funding for the 
President’s misguided and wasteful nu-
clear weapons programs while taking 
no action to preserve the New START 
treaty, the last standing agreement 
capping 
U.S. 
and 
Russian 
nuclear 
forces. For more than half a century, 
successive administrations have linked 
arms control with nuclear moderniza-
tion efforts as a way of promoting sta-
ble deterrence and heading off an un-
constrained arms race. Failure to ex-
tend New START will unravel this 
linkage, freeing Russia of limits on its 
nuclear arsenal and sparking a costly, 
destabilizing arms buildup. 
I also strongly oppose the authoriza-
tion of funds to prepare for an explo-
sive underground nuclear test, an act 
that would prompt our nuclear-armed 
adversaries to conduct their own tests 
and 
would 
undermine 
longstanding 
arms control and nonproliferation ob-
jectives. I applaud the House’s passage 
of an amendment to bar nuclear test-
ing in its NDAA, and I urge my col-
leagues to uphold this prohibition in 
conference negotiations. 
I also believe that this bill fails to 
tackle the long-term budget challenges 
facing our country, which is why I was 
disappointed that the Senate rejected 
Senator SANDERS’ amendment to re-
duce defense spending by 10 percent 
and invest that money into healthcare, 
education, and poverty reduction in 
communities with a poverty rate of 25 
percent or more. In the midst of the 
worst economic downturn since the 
Great Depression, a pandemic that has 
taken the lives of more than 150,000 of 
our fellow Americans and shows no 
signs of slowing down, and the impend-
ing crises of homelessness and jobless-
ness that we face if the Congress fails 
to provide relief, we simply cannot af-
ford to continue this level of invest-
ment in defense at the expense of other 
critical national priorities. 
I regret that the Senate was not 
given an opportunity to vote on my 
amendment, cosponsored by 13 other 
Senators, prohibiting the use of U.S. 
security assistance to support the uni-
lateral annexation of all or parts of the 
West Bank. The security assistance 
which the United States provides to 
Israel is an important element of the 
relationship between our two countries 
and one that I strongly support. As I 
explained in my floor statement at the 
time of its introduction, the amend-
ment would not have reduced U.S. se-
curity assistance to Israel by a single 
penny. It would simply have ensured 
that no U.S. security assistance could 
be used for the purpose of unilaterally 
annexing territory in the West Bank. 
Furthermore, nothing in this amend-
ment would have prohibited Israel from 
using U.S.-financed missile defense sys-
tems such as Iron Dome to defend 
against attacks in any territories that 
could be unilaterally annexed by the 
Israeli Government. 
Likewise, I am troubled that the ma-
jority leader would not permit a vote 
on Senators WYDEN
and MERKLEY’s 
amendment to end the President’s un-
constitutional attacks on Americans 
exercising 
their 
First 
Amendment 
rights in Portland. Portland is not the 
first city to experience these tactics; 
President 
Trump 
sent 
unidentified 
Federal police onto the streets of our 
Nation’s Capital to threaten peaceful 
protesters. Now, he is threatening to 
send them to other American cities, in-
cluding Baltimore. We must require 
Federal agents to wear visible identi-
fication and ban them from making ar-
rests or detentions using unmarked ve-
hicles. The Senate’s failure to act 
quickly to respond to the President’s 
unconstitutional behavior is shameful. 
Finally, 
Majority 
Leader 
MCCON-
NELL, at the behest of the Trump ad-
ministration, once again blocked the 
inclusion the bipartisan DETER Act, 
which I introduced with Senator RUBIO, 
to deter future Russian interference in 
U.S. Federal elections. The DETER Act 
sends a clear message to Russian Presi-
dent Putin or any other foreign adver-
sary: If you attack American elections, 
you will face severe consequences. 
Leader MCCONNELL blocked this meas-
ure from the last NDAA, even though 
the Senate had unanimously passed a 
resolution instructing the conferees to 
support its inclusion. 
The decision of the Trump adminis-
tration, 
working 
through 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, to continue to block the 
DETER Act effectively green-lights 
Russian interference in future U.S. 
elections. It is a gift to Russian Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin and a subversion 
of the clear desire expressed by both 
Chambers of Congress to hold Russia 
accountable for future interference. It 
reinforces Putin’s belief that the costs 
of attacking our democracy are low 
and the rewards are great. I will con-
tinue fighting for the passage of the 
DETER Act. The Presidential election 
is less than 4 months away, and we 
must make clear to Putin that Russia 
will pay a steep price if they interfere 
in another election. 
While I am opposed to some of the 
provisions in this bill and disappointed 
by the omission of others, I believe 
that, on balance, the NDAA will 
strengthen our national security and 
advance other important national pri-
orities. For that reason, I voted in sup-
port of final passage. 
f 
VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I was 
absent when the Senate voted on vote 
No. 152 to confirm Executive Calendar 
No. 770, Derek Kan, of California, to be 
Deputy Director of the Office of Man-
agement and Budget. On vote No. 152, 
had I been present, I would have voted 
no on the motion to confirm Mr. Kan. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF DEREK KAN 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
opposed the confirmation of Derek Kan 
to be Deputy Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget. Mr. Kan’s 
tenure at OMB and his responses to 
questions from the Senate Budget 
Committee 
raise 
serious 
concerns 
about a lack of transparency and a fail-
ure of leadership in responding to the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
While Mr. Kan was the Executive As-
sociate Director at OMB, the agency il-
legally withheld security assistance for 
Ukraine in furtherance of President 
Trump’s corrupt scheme to pressure 
Ukraine 
to 
interfere 
on 
President 
Trump’s behalf in the 2020 election. On 
August 12, 2019, OMB General Counsel 
Mark Paoletta sent an email to Mr. 
Kan and other top OMB officials re-
garding concerns from the Department 
of Defense about this withholding, an 
email that made headlines when it was 
revealed publicly. While I specifically 
asked Mr. Kan about this email in 
written questions prior to the hearing, 
Mr. Kan claimed during the hearing 
that he was not familiar with the email 
in question.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4665 
August 3, 2020 
The Government Accountability Of-
fice found that OMB violated the Im-
poundment Control Act by withholding 
security assistance from Ukraine, and 
GAO 
also 
stated 
that 
OMB’s 
stonewalling of their inquiry had ‘‘con-
stitutional significance’’ due to the un-
dermining of legislative branch over-
sight. Mr. Kan, like OMB Director Rus-
sell Vought during his confirmation 
hearing, refused to even provide a rea-
son for why OMB did not turn over any 
documents in response to GAO’s re-
quest for documents to substantiate 
OMB’s claim that a policy process was 
the reason for withholding aid to 
Ukraine. In response to my questions 
following the hearing, Mr. Kan referred 
the matter to the office of OMB Gen-
eral Counsel Mark Paoletta, the same 
official whose response to GAO’s in-
quiry failed to turn over any such doc-
uments in the first place. 
I am also concerned about Mr. Kan’s 
leadership as a member of the Presi-
dent’s Coronavirus Task Force. On 
February 5, 2020, Mr. Kan told Senators 
that the Trump administration did not 
need additional resources to address 
the coronavirus, which contributed to 
the deadly lack of preparation as the 
pandemic spread in the United States. 
During his confirmation hearing, Mr. 
Kan would not say whether he agreed 
with President Trump about reducing 
testing for coronavirus or whether 
President Trump was setting a good ex-
ample by holding large indoor rallies 
at which masks were not required. 
For those reasons, I voted against 
Mr. Kan’s confirmation to be Deputy 
Director at OMB. 
f 
NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in 2008, 
Congress responded to rising reports of 
child sexual abuse material—CSAM— 
online by passing the PROTECT Act to 
direct the Department of Justice to 
combat these heinous crimes. However, 
in the decade that followed, DOJ failed 
to request the manpower, funding, and 
resources to combat this scourge, leav-
ing both the National Center for Miss-
ing and Exploited Children—NCMEC— 
and law enforcement agencies unco-
ordinated, understaffed, and under-
funded. As a result, though tech com-
panies reported more than 45 million 
instances of CSAM to NCMEC in the 
last year alone, just a fraction were in-
vestigated, and even fewer were pros-
ecuted and convicted. 
Yet, rather than confronting this 
failure by Congress and the executive 
branch, my colleagues on the Senate 
Judiciary Committee have put forth 
the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant 
Neglect of Interactive Technologies— 
EARN IT—Act, a deeply flawed piece of 
legislation that would revoke online 
platforms’ intermediary liability pro-
tections with regard to not only Fed-
eral civil Jaw, but also any State law 
broadly related to CSAM. 
The EARN IT Act will not protect 
children. It will not stop the spread of 
child sexual abuse material, nor target 
the monsters who produce and share it, 
and it will not help the victims of these 
evil crimes. What it will do is threaten 
the free speech, privacy, and security 
of every single American. This is be-
cause, at its core, the amended EARN 
IT Act magnifies the failures of the 
Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act— 
SESTA—and its House companion, the 
Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act— 
FOSTA. Experts believe that SESTA/ 
FOSTA has done nothing to help vic-
tims or stop sex trafficking, while cre-
ating 
collateral 
damage 
for 
marginalized 
communities 
and 
the 
speech of all Americans. A lawsuit 
challenging the constitutionality of 
FOSTA on First Amendment grounds 
is proceeding through the courts, and 
there is bicameral Federal legislation 
to study the widespread negative im-
pacts of the bill on marginalized 
groups. 
Yet, the authors of the EARN IT Act 
decided to take this kind of carveout 
and expand it further to State civil and 
criminal statutes. By allowing any in-
dividual State to set laws for internet 
content, this bill would create massive 
uncertainty, 
both 
for 
strong 
encryption and constitutionally pro-
tected speech online. What is worse, 
the flood of State laws that could po-
tentially arise under the EARN IT Act 
raises strong Fourth Amendment con-
cerns, meaning that any CSAM evi-
dence collected could be rendered inad-
missible in court and accused CSAM of-
fenders could get off scot-free. This is 
not a risk that I am willing to take. 
Let me be clear: The proliferation of 
these heinous crimes against children 
is a serious problem. However, for 
these reasons and more, the EARN IT 
Act is not the solution. Moreover, it ig-
nores what Congress can and should be 
doing to combat this heinous crime. 
The U.S. has a number of important 
evidence-based programs in existence 
that are proven to keep kids safe, and 
they are in desperate need of funding 
to do their good work. Yet the EARN 
IT Act doesn’t include a single dollar of 
funding for these important programs. 
It is time for the U.S. Government to 
spend the funds necessary to save chil-
dren’s lives now. 
In May of 2020, I introduced the In-
vest in Child Safety Act to do exactly 
that. My bill would drastically increase 
the number of prosecutors and agents 
hunting down child predators, require a 
single person to be personally respon-
sible for these efforts, and direct more 
than $5 billion in mandatory funding to 
the folks who can actually make a dif-
ference in this fight. 
I believe this historic, mandatory in-
vestment in personnel and funding is 
necessary to truly take on the scourge 
of child exploitation, and I urge my 
colleagues to support my approach. 
Meanwhile, I intend to object to any 
unanimous consent agreement regard-
ing the EARN IT Act. 
REMEMBERING COLONEL RONALD 
DUDLEY RAY 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, Col. Ron-
ald Dudley Ray, USMC, served as the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Guard/Reserve) during the Reagan ad-
ministration and was a highly deco-
rated Vietnam veteran who was an ad-
viser to the South Vietnamese Marine 
Corps during the Tet Offensive and 
other campaigns. He was awarded two 
Silver Stars, a Bronze Star with com-
bat V, and a Purple Heart. His gal-
lantry under fire was exceeded only by 
his tenacious advocacy for his fellow 
veterans. He entered law school at the 
University of Louisville, where he 
graduated at the top of his class. 
Throughout his civilian career, he used 
his talent and professional skills to en-
courage, organize, and recognize vet-
erans from the Vietnam era. He person-
ally championed the Kentucky Viet-
nam Veterans’ Memorial in Frankfort, 
and led the way in raising $1 million 
for its design and construction. A great 
student 
of 
American 
history, 
he 
amassed a collection of over 10,000 
books on the subject, and he shared his 
vast knowledge by writing and speak-
ing about the history of the country he 
loved and served with such distinction. 
Colonel Ray, who passed away July 6, 
2020, leaves a unique legacy of personal 
service to our Nation and dedication to 
its veterans that is worthy of this spe-
cial distinction.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4666 
August 3, 2020 
Elizabeth believes that teachers hold 
several roles in the lives of their stu-
dents. For example, they are respon-
sible for imparting knowledge, as well 
as providing guidance and leadership 
related to many of life’s skills. She 
often considers teachers to be surro-
gate family members for their stu-
dents. 
Elizabeth’s philosophy for teaching is 
one that states all students can learn 
and grow, no matter their background. 
She embodies the principle that having 
enthusiasm for learning is required to 
propel students, as well as others in 
the learning community, and makes 
for a more positive educational envi-
ronment. 
Elizabeth teaches fifth grade math 
and science at Wildwood Elementary 
School and has been a teacher for 21 
years. She graduated from the Univer-
sity of Central Florida with a bach-
elor’s degree in elementary education. 
I extend my best wishes to Elizabeth 
on the decades she has devoted to 
teaching her students. I look forward 
to hearing of her continued success in 
the coming years.∑

TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER DIXON 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Jennifer Dixon, the Pasco 
County Teacher of the Year from Gulf 
High School in New Port Richey, FL. 
Jennifer is excited to come to work 
every day because of her students. She 
finds it a great honor to work with 
them, to understand them, to teach 
them, and to help them grow through-
out the school year. 
High school was not Jennifer’s favor-
ite time in her life, and she believes 
other students should not have a simi-
lar experience. She credits teachers she 
had throughout her educational career 
for making a difference, helping her to 
become the first person in her family 
to graduate from college. 
Jennifer teaches economics, financial 
literacy, and psychology at Gulf High 
School. She became a teacher in 2003 
and is certified to teach art K–12, ex-
ceptional student education K–12, busi-
ness education for grades 6–12, and so-

from Texas Tech University. 
I extend my best wishes to Jennifer

∑
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to recognize Diana O’Con-
nor, the Indian River County Teacher 
of the Year from Beachland Elemen-
tary School in Vero Beach, FL. 
Diana instills her love for learning in 
each student, knowing this is impor-
tant for them today and later in their 
academic 
careers. 
Diana 
began 
a 
schoolwide 
initiative 
for 
collecting 
soda can tabs for Ronald McDonald 
House Charities and is one of the lead 
representatives for her school’s Leu-

classmates knowing about it. 
Diana is the exceptional student edu-
cation department chair and assists 
general education teachers in planning 
standards-based instruction and di-
verse lesson plans at Beachland Ele-

TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINE O’HARA 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Christine O’Hara, the Char-
lotte County Teacher of the Year from 
Peace River Elementary School in 
Charlotte Harbor, FL. 
Christine enjoys sharing her passion 
for math with teachers and students 
and believes everyone is a math person 
at heart. She enjoys utilizing the 
learning experience to make math en-
joyable and successful for her students. 
In 2016 and 2017, Christine was identi-

the State.

TRIBUTE TO JESSICA PRICE 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to recognize Jessica Price, 
the Citrus County Teacher of the Year 
from Lecanto High School in Lecanto, 
FL. 
Although she never planned to be-
come a Spanish teacher, Jessica’s pas-
sion for sharing a love for language 
makes her an excellent educator. Jes-
sica loved learning as a student in Cit-
rus County, focusing on Spanish and 
chorus as her favorite classes. She had 
originally planned to become a music 
teacher, but Spanish captivated her to 
teach the language to students each 
year. In college, she studied in Mexico, 
living with a family and immersing 
herself in Spanish culture, furthering 
her love of the Spanish language. 
Jessica teaches Spanish at Lecanto

English, with minors in linguistics and 
teaching English as a second language

TRIBUTE TO KATRINA 
RODDENBERRY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Katrina Roddenberry, the 
Wakulla County Teacher of the Year 
from 
Wakulla 
Middle 
School 
in 
Crawfordville, FL. 
Katrina finds it incredibly rewarding 
to see students motivated by science 
experiments and researching on their 
own about careers in science fields. She 
strives to spark their interests, which 
helped 
to 
raise 
Wakulla 
Middle 
School’s average science proficiency on 
the Florida Science Assessment for 
eighth grade by 23 percent, which is 21 
percent above the State average. 
Katrina created and sponsors her 
school’s science, technology, engineer-
ing, and math club, is an Odyssey of 
the Mind coach, Fellowship of Chris-
tian Athletes cosponsor, and is a teach-
er coach. She believes the ultimate 
measure of her success as a science 
teacher is when her students leave her 
classroom with strong foundational 
knowledge of science concepts and a re-
newed curiosity and love of learning 
about the world around them. 
Katrina is in her third year of teach-
ing middle school science and high 
school credit integrated science and in-
tegrated science honors to eighth grad-
ers at Wakulla Middle School. Pre-
viously, she taught third and fifth

TRIBUTE TO DEVAN ROULHAC 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am 
pleased 
to 
recognize 
Devan 
Roulhac, the Calhoun County Teacher 
of the Year from Blountstown High 
School in Blountstown, FL. 
Devan’s inspiration as an educator is 
to learn more about his students. He 
does this because we typically do not 
know the realities some students en-
dure after leaving the classroom or 
how deeply those negative experiences 
affect their mental health and personal 
well-being. His inspiration comes from 
his own personal experience as a stu-
dent. 
Devan knows some students have it 
worse than what he experienced and 
has realized the students he teaches 
today mimic the same front he put on 
while in school. This thought process is 
what drives his every decision to help 
those students who need it the most. 
Devan is an English I teacher at 
Blountstown High School. He began his 
teaching 
career 
in 
2017 
teaching 
English and reading at Wewahitchka 
Jr./Sr. High School. Currently, Devan 
is developing a curriculum for teaching 
freshman English courses that meet 
Florida standards, focusing on informa-
tional text analyses, argumentative 
writing, and grammar mechanics. 
I extend my deepest gratitude to 
Devan for his commitment to teaching 
and making a difference in the lives of 
his students. I look forward to hearing 
of his good work in the years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO JERRY WEBB 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to recognize Jerry Webb, 
the Taylor County Teacher of the Year 
from 
Taylor 
County 
Elementary 
School in Perry, FL. 
Jerry dedicates himself as an educa-
tor by putting his students first. He tu-
tors them on subjects they are strug-
gling with and makes himself available 
to talk about anything they need to 
discuss. Jerry works to make a dif-
ference in the lives of his students in 
any way that he can. 
Superintendent, Dr. Danny Glover, 
Jr., notes Jerry’s innovative teaching 
style is something not easily replicated 
and is a part of the reason he won this 
important award. Dr. Glover noted how 
fortunate the Taylor County School 
District is to have Jerry. 
Jerry has taught fourth and fifth 
grades at Taylor County Elementary 
School for the past 6 years. Previously, 
he worked as a paraprofessional at the 
school before becoming a grade school 
teacher. 
I extend my best wishes to Jerry and 
look forward to hearing of his contin-
ued success in the years to come.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO CARRIE WILSON 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to recognize Carrie Wilson, 
the Hernando County Teacher of the 
Year from Challenger K–8 School of 
Science and Mathematics in Spring 
Hill, FL. 
Carrie wants students to feel their 
school is like their home and to know 
they are cared for and valued when 
coming to class. She is very grateful to 
receive this important recognition as it 
represents the many passionate profes-
sionals who work in the Hernando 
County School District. 
Carrie has been a school counselor 
since 2001 and is in her 21st year work-
ing in elementary education. She is a 
graduate of the University of South 
Florida and earned her graduate degree 
in counseling and psychology from 
Troy State. She works to raise aware-
ness to students’ mental health and en-
courages others to see themselves as a 
partner in helping those who need that 
support. 
I offer my sincere gratitude to Carrie 
for her more than two decades of help-
ing students. I look forward to hearing 
of her continued good work in the 
years to come.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO HEATHER YOUNG 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Heather Young, the Sarasota 
County Teacher of the Year from Ven-
ice Elementary School in Venice, FL. 
Heather has been a teacher for 22 
years and is in her first year of teach-
ing visual arts at Venice Elementary 
School. Previously, she taught gifted 
students in elementary school through 
middle school in Sarasota County 
Schools. 
Heather makes her art room a great 
venue 
for 
teaching 
her 
students, 
whether they are gifted or intellectu-
ally disabled. She uses art to teach in-
novative ways to facilitate problem- 
solving, risk-taking, and creative deci-
sionmaking skills. 
Heather believes there is no better 
way to spend her day than having a 
classroom that is a creative outlet for 
students. She tries to get them to stop 
questioning whether they can do some-
thing and, instead, empowers them to 
be creative on their own. 
I offer my sincere gratitude to Heath-
er for the good work she does for her 
students. I look forward to hearing of 
her continued success in the years to 
come.∑
