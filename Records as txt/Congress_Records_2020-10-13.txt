HONORING ERIC HALE, TEXAS 
TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
HON. COLIN Z. ALLRED 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to congratulate Eric Hale for becoming 
the first black man to be named Texas Teach-
er of the Year. On September 30, 2020, the 
Texas Association of School Administrators 
named Mr. Hale the Texas Teacher of the 
Year for 2021. He is now a finalist for the Na-
tional Teacher of the Year. Mr. Hale is a kin-
dergarten and first-grade teacher at David G. 
Burnet Elementary School in Dallas ISD. 
Throughout his career, he has gone above 
and beyond and has been recognized for ex-
cellence in teaching. 
Earlier this year, he appeared on the Kelly 
Clarkson Show and shared how he uses en-
couragement and positivity to motivate his stu-
dents. He takes them outside for math and 
science lessons in the real world. He uses 
music to keep his students engaged. 
Everyone needs a teacher who goes the 
extra mile, and for many students at David G. 
Burnett, that teacher is Mr. Hale. Mr. Hale, an 
advocate for his students, and through his 
commitment and dedication, he also teaches 
them to become their own advocates. 
I was raised by a single mom who was a 
public school teacher and I went to Dallas 
public schools all my life. I benefited from 
teachers like Mr. Hale growing up and I am 
proud that this generation of students has Mr. 
Hale as their teacher. 
It is a privilege to recognize Mr. Hale for 
being the 2021 Texas Teacher of the Year 
and for becoming the first black man to re-
ceive this important and prestigious honor.

HONORING JIM MOCK 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Jim Mock on receiv-
ing Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hos-
pital’s Advocacy Award. 
During the coronavirus pandemic, many 
Pennsylvanians faced uncertainties. To help 
ensure food security, the Center for Inde-
pendent 
Living 
of 
South 
Central 
PA 
(CILSCPA) started Operation Five Loaves to 
deliver food directly to those in need. 
Throughout this crisis, Jim and his wife, 
Sandy, have worked tirelessly to deliver food 
directly to members of the disabled community 
in the Altoona area. Twice a week, Jim deliv-
ers 60 boxes of produce to people with mobil-
ity challenges who otherwise would have dif-
ficulty accessing fresh and healthy food. He 
often goes above and beyond to accommo-
date clients, putting in long hours and deliv-
ering food without contact. 
Jim’s selfless service is a hallmark of our 
community. I thank Jim and Sandy for their 
commitment to the Altoona region, and for 
their dedication to those in need. On behalf of 
the 13th District of Pennsylvania, I am proud 
to recognize Jim Mock as he receives this 
well-earned award, and I wish him the best in 
the chapters to come.

HONORING 
OFFICER 
MICHAEL 
TACKEMA AS A RECIPIENT OF 
THE VALOR AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize City of Fayetteville Police Depart-
ment Officer Michael Tackema as a recipient 
of the Public Safety Valor Award, presented 
annually by the Greater Fayetteville Chamber 
of Commerce. 
The Valor Award is a prestigious honor pre-
sented to men and women of the Fayetteville 
region who perform acts of heroism under ex-
treme risk. An outstanding member of Fayette-
ville Police Department, Officer Tackema went 
beyond his call of duty on July 5, 2019. 
Upon arrival to a domestic disturbance call, 
the scene escalated quickly and became dan-
gerous when the homeowner opened fire from 
within the residence. As other officers were 
forced to take cover, Officer Tackema placed 
himself in the line of fire to protect his team 
and engage the subject. 
Officer Tackema is a hero and that day he 
not only saved the lives of his fellow officers, 
but the lives of countless civilians as well. His 
quick actions, bravery, and dedication to serv-
ice is a credit to him, his family, and the entire 
Fayetteville Police Department. I know I speak 
for everyone in our community when I say we 
are truly grateful for his unwavering service 
and cannot thank him enough. 
Officer Tackema is deserving of this honor, 
and I would like to extend my most sincere 
appreciation and wish him success as he con-
tinues to protect our communities. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
celebrating City of Fayetteville Police Depart-
ment Officer Michael Tackema for receiving 
the Public Safety Valor Award.

CONGRATULATING PHILIP MILLER 
UPON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate long-time Missouri 
resident, Philip Miller on his upcoming retire-
ment from Bayer. 
After 26 years of service, mainly in the crop 
science field, Philip is the inventor of over 20 
patents, has authored 17 scientific papers and 
book chapters, and has spoken in numerous 
global and societal policy forums. Since 2012, 
he has served on the boards of the Bio-
technology Industry Organization (BIO) and 
CropLife International. He also found time to 
serve 
on 
the 
University 
of 
Missouri’s 
Chancellors Advisory Board and the board of 
the Missouri Make-A-Wish foundation, all while 
working to raise corporate funds for the United 
Way of Greater St. Louis. 
A scientist by training, Philip earned a Ph.D. 
in biochemistry, a Master of Science in cyto-
genetics, and a Bachelor of Science in biologi-
cal sciences. He has utilized his expertise and 
leadership skills in various roles throughout his 
career to ensure farmers have the tech-
nologies they need to ensure that our nation 
continues to have affordable supplies of food. 
Philip began his career as a regional sales 
director for PepsiCo and as a teacher at the 
University of Florida and Appalachian State 
University prior to joining Monsanto. From 
2002 until Bayer’s acquisition of Monsanto in 
2018, Philip served in a variety of roles, in-
cluding as the site lead at Mystic, Connecticut, 
a former Monsanto research site. Philip next 
served as Vice President, U.S. Commercial 
Technology Development before serving as 
Vice President, U.S. Product Management and 
Business Strategy. 
In 2010, Philip became Vice President, 
Global Regulatory Affairs and Science adding 
global government affairs to his responsibilities 
in 2015. The next year, his role expanded to 
include corporate affairs and communications 
and in 2018 he was also asked to lead 
Monsanto’s merger with Bayer. At Bayer, Phil-
ip has led engagements with global govern-
ments and regulatory bodies as well as with 
other important stakeholders, critically shaping 
the industrial landscape for the better. 
Having grown up farming and continuing to 
operate our family farm today, I cannot over-
state the importance of Philip’s contributions to 
the farming community and agriculture indus-
try. Families across the U.S and around the 
world can better feed their families thanks to 
his ingenuity and commitment to the avail-
ability of food. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking 
Philip Miller for his many years of service and 
congratulating him on a well-deserved retire-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E952 
October 13, 2020 
Paul Johnson loves his camper. His family 
bought their first one 10 years ago so they 
could spend more time together making their 
own Montana moments. For Paul, his wife, 
and their four kids, camping is a huge part of 
their lifestyle, and they cherish their time to-
gether. But this year looked a little different for 
the Johnson camper. It served as a home for 
Paul as he worked at Benefis West campus to 
keep his patients and family safe from the 
coronavirus. 
Back in March, the Benefis Health System 
instituted a respiratory clinic for the sole pur-
pose of treating COVID–19 patients. Paul was 
one of three commissioned physicians to over-
see the clinic, putting him in direct contact with 
COVID–19 patients. Formerly a part of the 
U.S. Army Reserve and currently in the Na-
tional Guard, it’s in Paul’s DNA to serve oth-
ers. 
For nine weeks, Paul camped at the Benefis 
West campus and the local KOA campground, 
away from his wife and children. Paul says he 
had to do what was best for his family. His 
eldest son was home, about to be deployed to 
Afghanistan. His daughter also worked at a 
family ranch that had guests coming and 
going. Paul simply didn’t want to jeopardize 
his family’s health if he was an asymptomatic 
carrier. 
Paul is good at putting things in perspective, 
though. He says it certainly wasn’t as bad as 
being deployed out of country. Still, the experi-
ence was emotionally and mentally draining, 
especially since there wasn’t a clear light at 
the end of the tunnel. But to Paul, the easiest 
thing to do was grab the bull by the horns and 
take care of his patients. 
His family is very proud of him, and so am 
I. 
Living out of a camper in March with no 
heat wasn’t easy. When it was below freezing, 
his water wouldn’t run, so he used the hospital 
for a warm shower. Cooking for himself was a 
challenge. Paul says there were a lot of busy 
days and sleepless nights. To pass the time, 
he tied flies. When it wasn’t cold, he was able 
to take a socially distant dog walk with his 
wife, but there was no hand-holding or kissing. 
Paul says that was one of the hardest parts. 
Many may ask, ‘‘Why go to these lengths?’’ 
For Paul, he was committed to treating his pa-
tients and serving his community in a time of 
need. 
Madam Speaker, for his outstanding service 
to country, for his dedication to family, and for 
his selfless, unwavering patient care, I recog-
nize Paul Johnson of Great Falls for his Spirit 
of Montana.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
DETECTIVE KEVIN COLLINS 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Pine Bluff 
police detective Kevin Dwaine Collins. His life 
tragically cut short in the line of duty on Mon-
day, October 5, we take this time to thank him 
for his life of service and his family for their ul-
timate sacrifice. 
A member of the Pine Bluff Police Depart-
ment since 2015, Detective Collins had proven 
himself to be a valuable resource and friend to 
his community. While his family and friends 
refer to him as a leader and a ‘‘gentle giant,’’ 
it was well-known that Detective Collins held 
his calling to law enforcement with the great-
est zeal. 
Prior to his work with the police department, 
Collins served in a variety of public service 
areas like the Arkansas Department of Correc-
tions and the Metropolitan Emergency Com-
munication Association. In 2017, he was 
named Pine Bluff Police Department’s Officer 
of the Year. 
Detective Collins is named by community 
leaders of Pine Bluff as ‘‘one of the finest offi-
cers you could ever hope to have.’’ His work 
was not just a job, ‘‘but it was his mission.’’ It 
is clear from his years of service and his com-
mitment to love his fellow man that Detective 
Kevin Collins is a man deserving of the high-
est honor. I take this time to celebrate his leg-
acy and to thank him for the sacrifice he has 
made for our community and our home.

HONORING DR. GOVINDAPPA 
VENKATAWSWAMY 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today 
I 
rise 
to 
honor 
Dr. 
Govindappa 
Venkataswamy, who devoted his life to pre-
venting blindness in India and across the 
world. His work preserved the vision of mil-
lions of men, women and children, allowing 
them the blessing of sight and the opportunity 
to enjoy independent, productive lives. 
Dr. V, as he was affectionately called, was 
born October 1, 1918, in a small village in 
Tamil Nadu, India. After graduating from med-
ical school, he joined the Indian Army Medical 
Corps, but had to resign after contracting a 
severe form of rheumatoid arthritis that left his 
hands permanently disfigured. Unable to prac-
tice in his chosen field of obstetrics, Dr. V. re-
turned to medical school to complete specialty 
training in ophthalmology and, despite his infir-
mity, mastered the art of cataract surgery. In 
1956, he was appointed head of the Depart-
ment of Ophthalmology at the Madurai Med-
ical College, where he performed thousands of 
ocular surgeries until reaching the mandatory 
retirement age of 58. 
Dr. V’s work at the medical college sen-
sitized him to the terrible impact of blindness 
on those without means to pay for care or 
cope with disability. That experience, and his 
deep religious conviction that the noblest pur-
pose in life is to serve others, inspired him to 
pursue an extraordinarily ambitious program to 
end preventable blindness in India. In 1976, 
immediately after retiring from government 
service, Dr. V and members of his family 
founded the first Aravind Eye Hospital in 
Madurai, India. 
Dr. V took a special interest in the lean 
business processes of highly efficient enter-
prises like McDonald’s restaurants, while 
maintaining the highest standard of care. The 
self-sustaining Aravind Eye Care System is 
notable for its imaginative division of labor, 
consistent delivery of positive patient out-
comes, and intense focus on reducing costs. 
One highly successful byproduct of this focus: 
Aurolab, a Dr. V innovation that manufactures 
high-quality intraocular lenses so competitively 
priced that it exports the majority of its produc-
tion to clinics all over the world. 
The Aravind Eye Care System has been ac-
claimed by Harvard Business School and is 
the focus of an HBS case study; was recog-
nized for excellence in publications including 
Fast Company, Forbes and the Wall Street 
Journal; and has inspired health-care organi-
zations throughout the developing world. From 
its humble beginnings in Madurai, the Aravind 
Eye Care System now provides care to over 
four million patients and performs over five 
hundred thousand surgeries each year in hos-
pitals and clinics in South India. Its consulting 
and training arm—the Lions Aravind Institute 
of Community Ophthalmology (LAICO)—sup-
ports ophthalmologic health care programs 
throughout 
the 
world, 
and 
the 
Dr. 
G. 
Venkataswamy Eye Research Institute inves-
tigates causes and evaluates treatment op-
tions for various eye diseases, and provides 
clinical and operations support. 
Thankfully, Dr. Venkataswamy’s service to 
humanity did not go unnoticed during his life-
time. The Government of India bestowed upon 
him one of its highest civilian honors, the 
Padma Shri Award, in 1973. Other honors in-
clude recognition by Helen Keller International, 
the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the 
Harold Wit Lectureship at Harvard Divinity 
School, and the International Agency for the 
Prevention of Blindness. Additionally, in 2008, 
the Aravind Eye Care System received the 
prestigious Gates Award for Global Health 
from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
Dr. V passed away in 2006, but his legacy 
continues to give eyesight to those who other-
wise would be blind, and his story continues to 
inspire. His life is best celebrated by his own 
words: ‘‘[when] we identify ourselves with all 
that is in the world . . . there is no exploi-
tation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is our-
selves we are healing.’’

Valor Award, presented annually by the Great-

The Valor Award is a prestigious honor pre-
sented to men and women of the Fayetteville 
region who perform acts of heroism under ex-
treme risk. An outstanding member of Cape 
Fear Valley EMS, Ms. Wheeler went beyond 
her call of duty when responding to a 911 call. 
After her ambulance was struck by a motor 
vehicle and inverted, Ms. Wheeler saved the 
lives of two individuals who were critically in-
jured on the scene. As she hung from her seat 
belt, she checked on her partner and calmed 
an alarmed EMS student. Bystanders assisted 
in freeing her and her team from the ambu-
lance, and Ms. Wheeler immediately began to 
render aid to the critically injured victims in the 
other vehicle.

HONORING HARRY WEDDLE 
HON. JOHN JOYCE

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

ceiving Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hos-

Like many Americans, Harry has faced un-
precedented 
challenges 
spurred 
by 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. Prior to his time at En-
compass Health, Harry had spent over thirty 
days at UPMC-Altoona and another four 
weeks at Select Specialty Hospital. After these 
lengthy stays, he was transferred to Encom-
pass. Throughout this ordeal, Harry also cou-
rageously battled COVID–19, while enduring 
isolation from family and loved ones. 
Harry is a fighter. He beat COVID–19 and 
continued on the road to recovery. Thankfully, 
Harry was able to return home to his wife. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I am proud to honor Harry 
Weddle and celebrate his recovery. I wish 
Harry and his family every continued health 
and happiness in the chapters to come.

life to serving the world at large. His was a 
powerful and touching life that was tragically 
cut short by cancer on September 2, 2020. He 
was just 55 years old. Dr. Laubach’s legacy 
will live on in the work he did, the lives he 
touched, and the story he left behind. 
Dr. Laubach began as an undergraduate in 
North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany at the Uni-
versity of Bonn, where he graduated with a 
degree in economics in 1993. He then went 
on to receive a Ph.D. in economics from 
Princeton University just four years later. At 
Princeton, Dr. Laubach’s thesis advisor was 
none other than Ben Bernanke, who would go 
on to serve as the 14th Chair of the Federal 
Reserve from 2006 to 2014. With an illustrious 
education under his belt, Dr. Laubach began 
his even more illustrious career. First making 
a name for himself in my home district as an 
Economist at the Kansas City Federal Re-
serve Bank, Dr. Laubach started on a path to 
change the world of economics forever. After 
working at the Kansas City Fed for three 
years, Dr. Laubach became an Economist, 
and then Senior Economist, for the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System. He 
then took four years to teach and serve as 
Chair of Macroeconomics at Goethe University 
Frankfurt while taking research stints at Deut-
sche Bundesbank and the European Central 
Bank. He returned to the Board of Governors 
in 2012, this time as the Associate Director, 
before being appointed Director of the Division 
of Monetary Affairs in 2015. He served in that 
capacity until his death on September 2nd. At 
the time of his death, he was leading the cen-
tral bank’s new strategy to lower unemploy-
ment while responding to the changes brought 
on by the devastating pandemic that has so 
deeply affected our nation’s economy. 
Though his life in the economic world was 
impactful in countless ways, he is most well- 
known for two groundbreaking contributions. 
The first, of course, is Dr. Laubach’s indelible 
mark on central bank interest-rate policy, 
which continues to affect both the U.S. Fed-
eral Reserve and central banks across the 
world. The second came in 2001, when Dr. 
Laubach co-authored a paper titled ‘‘Meas-
uring the Natural Rate of Interest’’ alongside 
John Williams, who is currently serving as the 
president of the New York Federal Reserve. 
That paper set forth a transformational theory 
on the neutral rate of interest that will forever 
be known as the Laubach-Williams model. 
Dr. Laubach wore many hats throughout his 
career: 
brilliant 
economist, 
dedicated 
re-
searcher, bold thinker, curious student, and 
generous professor. A friend to many, he is 
also remembered as a kind, calm, and colle-
gial presence. When critics attacked his ideas, 
Dr. Laubach responded with kindness and re-
spect. When young economic minds sought 
his wisdom, he responded with patience and 
empathy. He was, above all, a beautiful soul 
who sought to employ his talents to alleviate 
suffering and serve others, and for that, we 
are eternally grateful. 
When such a quietly influential figure 
passes on, I find myself wondering what I my-
self can do to help preserve their legacy. But 
in that respect, Dr. Laubach’s own work will do 
much more than any tribute or eulogy could 
ever hope to do. His ideas, his writing, his in-
fluence is already a part of the fabric of the 
economic world. His legacy lives on in global 
monetary policy, in economics classrooms 
around the country, and in the thinkers he 
helped prepare to take on the crises of tomor-
row. Madam Speaker, please join me, my dis-
trict, and the Subcommittee on Monetary Pol-
icy for the House Financial Services Com-
mittee in honoring Dr. Laubach’s memory and 
offering heartful condolences to his loved 
ones. We have lost a bright light, an irreplace-
able mind, and a dedicated public servant, but 
we are blessed with the dark places his light 
illuminated, the theories his mind made crystal 
clear, and the lives his service helped touch. 
He was taken from us far too soon, so let us 
all carry his torch forward by committing our 
passions, skills, and talents to the service of 
others. 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
CELEBRATION 
OF 
THE 
WHITE 
COUNTY FARM BUREAU 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Centennial Celebration of the 
White County Farm Bureau. 
The White County Farm Bureau had its ori-
gin in 1920 when farmers organized an asso-
ciation to accomplish together what one farm-
er could not do alone. Following a mass meet-
ing of area farmers at the White County Court-
house, and after many stirring speeches, the 
White County Farm Bureau was organized. 
The most important issue of the time was soil 
composition, and poultry was the most impor-
tant industry in the county followed by dairy 
and livestock. 
As is the case today, the strength of the 
early Farm Bureau laid with its members. For 
example, in 1925, a tornado crossed the coun-
ty causing widespread destruction and death. 
The Farm Bureau worked closely with relief 
organizations to help neighbors get their farm-
ing work done and back on their feet. 
The purchase of alfalfa seeds was a grow-
ing interest to the Bureau in the 1930s. And 
as the financial condition of White County 
farmers improved, so too did the value of the 
organization. Membership increased, espe-
cially with women, and in 1940 the White 
County Home Bureau was organized. 
The Farm Bureau moved into its new build-
ing in 1947, paying the final loan installment in 
1957. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the or-
ganization was involved in legislative, mar-
keting, and membership policy development 
programs. Steady membership growth ensued, 
and member participation reached an all-time 
high. 
In the 1970s, the Illinois and county Farm 
Bureau’s successfully lobbied for legislation to 
reduce fees for farm truck and trailer license 
plates. In addition, the Bureau was busy 
studying taxation policy, concluding early on 
that property taxes needed reform. 
Madam Speaker, the spirit of cooperation 
and hard work lives on in today’s White Coun-
ty Farm Bureau, continuing a proud legacy 
filled with accomplishments and overcoming 
challenges. To celebrate this legacy, the Bu-
reau plans to share historical photos and doc-
uments on social media, interview past lead-
ers, compile a video presentation, produce a 
Centennial Booklet for members, and hold the 
100th Annual Meeting in January 2021. 
It is an honor to stand today to acknowledge 
the centennial anniversary of the White Coun-
ty Farm Bureau, and I wish the Bureau many 
more years of success.

town of Hillsborough, California, for more than 
17 years in various roles. To all of those roles, 
he applied exemplary commitment and pas-
sion, always resulting in improvements for the 
town and its residents. If there was a job 
Hillsborough needed to get done, John was 
the man to ask. 
John started his public service in February 
of 2003 as Building Inspector I, working close-
ly with homeowners and contractors to ensure 
safety and adherence to building codes. In 
2004, he was promoted to Building Inspector 
II and in 2006 to Chief Building Official. In that 
role, John demonstrated remarkable leader-
ship and mentorship passing on his passion 
for service and his superb knowledge of the 
town. He was instrumental in streamlining the 
permitting process and improving the image of 
the building division. He developed a model 
Green Building Ordinance and was the master 
architect of a customer relations management 
system that made communication and access 
to information easy and effective. 
Frequently serving in interim positions, John 
always bridged transitions and helped out 
where he was needed. He was the Acting 
Public Works Director, Interim Assistant City 
Manager and Acting City Manager. No matter 
his position, he approached it with enthusiasm 
and injected a sense of collaboration and 
team spirit. 
John came to public service from the build-
ing trades. He graduated from Skyline College 
with an Associate’s Degree in Building Tech-
nology and began his career as a carpenter, 
plumber and electrician in 1977. He worked in 
residential and commercial construction until 
1995, when the City of South San Francisco 
hired him to coordinate the aircraft noise insu-
lation program. I speak from personal experi-
ence in my Congressional Office when I say 
that solving the problem of airplane noise and 
its detrimental impact on human health is not 
an easy task. John fully immersed himself in 
the issue and subsequently served as a Com-
bination Building Inspector for South San 
Francisco’s Fire/Economic and Community 
Development Building Division. 
It is obvious from his work history that John 
is a hands-on guy and knows how to turn 
ideas into tangible objects. In his free time, he 
volunteers his talent and time to Habitat for 
Humanity, Rebuilding Together Peninsula and, 
very fortunate for Hillsborough, the Beautifi-
cation Foundation. He has been instrumental 
in building and maintaining more than 145 
parks, parklets and medians, including Harvest 
Garden, Town Hall campus, the Veterans Me-
morial, the police station, two fire stations and 
five school sites. He is also an outstanding 
event organizer working behind the scenes to 
make everything go smoothly. He has worked 
on signature events such as Geri Lane Hal-
loween, Memorial Day, Veteran’s Day, Light 
Up the Town and the Centennial Celebration. 
Other areas in which John has extensive 
knowledge 
are 
emergency 
preparedness, 
safety and technology. That has made him an 
invaluable asset to the town and prepared 
town staff for any emergency. In his capacity 
as Assistant City Manager, he served as the 
town’s risk manager handling insurance and 
claims with the IJPA–PLAN and providing 
safety programs. He managed the town’s in-
formation technology program by finalizing the 
IT Strategic Plan, implementing the council 
chamber upgrade, security and hardware im-
provements, updating the website and improv-
ing connectivity in different departments. John 
also served on regional committees including 
the Airport Noise Committee and SAMCAT, 
and he supported sustainability projects re-
lated to solar and lighting and community con-
cerns such as pesticides, leaf blowers, right of 
way issues and park use regulations. 
In his well-deserved retirement, John is 
looking forward to enjoying more time with his 
wife Melissa and their daughters Lauren and 
Kailey. We thank them for sharing him with 
the residents of Hillsborough, who have great-
ly benefited from his expertise, dedication and 
hard work. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing John Patrick Mullins, an outstanding 
public servant who I have admired and whose 
contributions will continue to shine and reflect 
the welcoming and innovative character of our 
town. I am confident we will see his familiar 
face at many parades, picnic and parties for 
years to come.

HONORING 
FIREFIGHTER 
JUSTIN 
WHITE AS A RECIPIENT OF THE 
VALOR AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize City of Fayetteville Firefighter 
Justin White as a recipient of the Public Safety 
Valor Award, presented annually by the Great-
er Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce. 
The Valor Award is a prestigious honor pre-
sented to men and women of the Fayetteville 
region who perform acts of heroism under ex-
treme risk. An outstanding member of the Fay-
etteville Fire Department, Firefighter White 
went beyond his call of duty on March 22, 
2020. 
After responding to a motor vehicle accident 
alongside Lieutenant Joe Bumgarner and Cap-
tain Jason Hulon, Firefighter White heroically 
rescued a victim from a burning vehicle that 
was pinned to a tree. Remarkably, this feat 
was accomplished within two minutes and fif-
teen seconds of arriving on the scene. 
While Captain Hulon and Firefighter White 
got dressed in PPE, Lieutenant Bumgarner at-
tempted to free the victim wearing only his 
turnout coat. When his superiors were pushed 
back by the intensity of the flames, Firefighter 
White saw an opening and pulled the victim to 
safety just as the vehicle’s dash was encased 
in fire. He sought medical attention for the vic-
tim before successfully containing the remain-
ing blaze. 
Firefighter White’s quick actions, bravery, 
and dedication to service is a credit to him, his 
family, and the entire Fayetteville Fire Depart-
ment. I know I speak for everyone in our com-
munity when I say we are truly grateful for his 
unwavering service and cannot thank him 
enough. 
Firefighter White is deserving of this honor, 
and I would like to extend my most sincere 
appreciation and wish him success as he con-
tinues to protect our communities. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
celebrating City of Fayetteville Firefighter Jus-
tin White for receiving the Public Safety Valor 
Award. 
HONORING MISSY MELLOTT 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize Melissa Mellott for re-
ceiving the Encompass Health Rehab Patient 
Achievement Award, 
After her tumor removal surgery and subse-
quent complications, Melissa entered rehab at 
Encompass. At the time, she exhibited weak-
ness in her left side, double vision, pain, and 
decreased strength and coordination. As a re-
sult of these symptoms, she often required as-
sistance to do daily tasks and needed to wear 
a neck brace. 
Thankfully, Missy worked hard in rehab and 
experienced incredible progress. As a testa-
ment to her perseverance and hard work, 
Missy was able to walk out of the facility unas-
sisted. Now at home, she has resumed many 
of the activities she enjoyed prior to the sur-
gery, including gardening and walking. 
Missy’s recovery journey is a shining exam-
ple of hope and hard work. On behalf of Penn-
sylvania’s 13th Congressional District, I con-
gratulate Missy Mellott on her remarkable 
work towards recovery, and I wish her every 
continued success.

SCRIPT 
Hi! How is everybody? We are not well. 
Yes, we are not well, because no one in these 
conditions can say that it is okay. I want to 
give you a nice speech. But I will say truths 
and from the heart. Why did it take you so 
long to come? Since it has been a while since 
we cried for HELP. You do not know every-
thing we have suffered. Someone should stop 
it. Someone should answer for this. If they 
have us locked up, they have separated us 
from our families, the judges have denied us 
everything. Why do they punish us more? 
Sending us to a ‘‘crazy man’’, ruthless who 
mutilates bodies. And they deport us because 
no one is saying ANYTHING. And they de-
port us because no one is denouncing ANY-
THING. Someone should stop this. Someone 
should answer for this. Do not let ICE come 
and wash their hands if they are the ones 
who ‘‘authorize’’ it. 
You all do not know the psychological 
trauma and the outrage we feel when we see 
so many women that have been ‘‘operated’’ 
on. We have seen them cry from the pain be-
cause their stomachs are inflamed, because 
the surgery infected them. They did not 
given them treatment nor medicine after-
ward the surgery. Sometimes we have had to 
be nurses and help one another. The major-
ity of the women who have received that sur-
gery do not understand what is happening to 
their body, nor what they did to their body. 
They ‘‘told’’ them they were going to per-
form a study and they had deceived them. 
Because a surgery room should not be a 
school. We have already attended school. I 
have been referred 5 times to Doctor 
Mahendra G. Amin. We were taken with our 
feet, waist, and hands chained. And with me 
came along 2, 3, 4, more women in the same 
or worse conditions because they had already 
been operated on. I have not seen one sur-
gery that has not been infected. Just because 
we are immigrants does not give them the 
right to practice and mutilate our bodies. We 
also have the right to say NO. If the right to 
health is universal that all humans have, 
look at these other women that are in the 
same situation, we do not understand what 
they have done to our bodies and we are here 
now. 
[Redacted] 
And the others decided to remain anony-
mous for fear of retaliation. 
For the love of God!! And for humanity. 
This should stop now. This should stop now. 
They should not deceive us, because the 
house looks ‘‘clean’’. They should not de-
ceive us, because it smells like fresh paint. 
The floor is clean. 
But when you all leave, the house will con-
tinue to be dirty, because it was always 
dirty. 
And who will clean the wounds of the 
soul?! And who will help us heal the wounds 
on our body when you all leave?! 
Come and look at how the women are. 
Look at what they have done to us! Do not 
let them deceive you because when you all 
leave the mistreatment and punishments 
will continue. But someone should run the 
risk and should say it [Redacted] This should 
stop ‘‘now’’. This should stop ‘‘now’’. This 
MUTILATION center should be closed, and 
we ask for ‘‘FREEDOM’’. We need adequate 
and reliable medical treatment. They do not 
give us the medicine we need. They are not 
correctly looking after our ailments. We 
have women with serious illnesses and other 
that are also sick. For Humanity, Free Us. 
Signed by 24 women. 
Haaaa, and you all thought that this had 
ended but, no. Besides the terrible gyneco-
logical procedures, we ask for the people 
with serious health conditions and for the 
ones that are beginning to get sick because 
if you come with an illness and it will spread 
tenfold. But everything you tell the nurse, 
she says it is a lie, that you are lying, that 
you have nothing. 
‘‘Sicknesses do not wait. Every day they 
become more and more and more numerous 
here that there is hardly any medicine but 
when visitors come, the ogre changes into a 
princess and everything looks like a fairy-
tale. But when the visitors leave. ‘‘night-
mares begin for us’’ because everything goes 
back to reality for us living here in Irwin.

LETTER NO. 2 FROM ONE OF THE DETAINED 
WOMEN—ENGLISH TRANSCRIPT 
I, [Redacted], want to express myself 
through this medium since it has been 8 
months that I am in this detention center [.] 
I have not been heard by anyone and now we 
have the opportunity for someone to listen 
to us [.] I beg that please they get inves-
tigated for everything that happens in this 
center since that in this place we have expe-
rienced many atrocities [.] This has been 
very cruel what we have suffered inside this 
detention in Irwin [.] This place seems to be 
a place of torture only for undocumented 
people [.] We do not deserve to be mistreated 
in this way since we are humans we deserve 
decent treatment to be respected like a per-
son [.] but it appears and for everything that 
has happened here that they do not have the 
heart of a person [.] There is no way to com-
pare the person who has done such barbaric 
and psychologic harm and on occasions phys-
ical because they would take you with 
chained feet [,] hands [,] and waist to the 
doctor for three or four hour from here be-
cause I have lived it [.] I am voicing the day 
in June when they finally took me to the 
doctor [.] They took me that day at 3am [.] 
I didn’t even know because after the month 
of April they had sent me until that day they 
called me [.] 
I was shocked but like always here they do 
not allow you to ask anything because if you 
ask the punishment and mistreatment is 
worse from the officials. Well they took me 
[.] I arrived at the place [.] my surprise was 
where I was since 3am inside that room here 
in the detention all day without eating [.] 
later after arriving at that place for sure you 
wait until they tell you if they can enter 
while they make you worse until half an 
hour inside of the bus and in the back of the 
clinic [.] I don’t know why but from that mo-
ment I asked myself what is this [.] it even 
appears to be a secret place [.] later they no-
tify you to the officials that you can enter [.] 
they do not even take off your handcuffs nor 
do they explain what will they do at least I 
had asked for a pill for the pain in my stom-
ach and they did not say anything except 
take me to that place where they make you 
sign papers [.] later they tell you lay on that 
bed [.] they do not even tell you you’re going 
to see the gynecologist [.] or I am the gyne-
cologist. Nothing. they lay you down and 
enter the inside of our stomach in less than 
5 minutes [.] he told me that you have cyst 
inside for weeks the results will arrive and if 
not they will bring you here again [.] I was 
surprised because it has been 5 years in this 
country and since 2014 I have checked at the 
center in my country and I never had a psy-
chological treatment because they have mis-
treated us so much that our bodies are al-
ways nervous from the yelling from how 
they throw the doors almost in our face [.] 
day and night the officials mistreat you in a 
manner that we have to humiliate ourselves 
for them not to yell at us [.] we ask for un-
derwear and they give us used ones from 
other people [.] that is not correct to put 
used underwear but that is what they throw 
at us if you want it good and if not they take 
it again . . . new is all we ask [.] they offend 
us [.] we ask for things to clean ourselves 
with and they tell us that there is nothing 
that ICE does not have it [.] we ask for more 
[cories?] and they also say that we should 
wear twelve and up to 5 times we have put 
on[...] we are like cockroaches at the door [.] 
they yell bye bye what is the food that is the 
name of the dog food [.] also if you do not get 
in line they let you go without eating if you 
were in the shower [.] they do not care at all 
[.] later if you lose out on food and ask and 
say that you were in shower they say that 
ICE does not have food to be giving out [.] 
they do not give us anything to shower with 
[.] this place is terrible and the people who 
work here from the biggest person to the 
smallest person [.] during a weighing the 
colonel Bidos [.] this was worse than the vis-
its that would come to check . . . since the 
weeks in April now you do find them here be-
cause they say we can contaminate them 
they yell [the rest is cut off because photo-
copy] 
I got a cyst on my ovaries [.] it has been 
terrible what has happened to all the women 
here [.] at least every month they take 6 to 
7 women to the gynecologist and the major-
ity are operated on because they have cysts 
says the gynecologist [.] apart from that, 
they operate on you and do not even give you 
a Band-aid or a pill [.] I have had to take 
care of my fellow mates that have been oper-
ated 
on 
in 
this 
place 
and 
with 
that 
gynecologist[.] 
the 
mistreatment 
begins 
when they take you to the doctor [.] when 
they return from there from the clinic they 
cannot even walk [.] they come with their 
stomach lacerated and inflamed and they re-
turn them here like dogs without checking 
on them [.] by three days of . . . they give 
you a Tylenol 250 [.] that is the a joke be-
cause even while crying the strong pain of 
the surgeries us the mates help each other to 
shower or with pills that we buy from the po-
lice station we take those [.] please no more 
[.] so much cruelty for us to feel such great 
pain because we do not know how we will re-
turn to our families after everything we have 
lived through in this terrible place. . . We 
will need this has been my mates that I have 
seen enter in those surgery situations and 
have left with cysts on their ovaries accord-
ing to the doctor we all come out with cysts 
and yes other sicknesses in our stomachs [.] 
how is this possible that we all get sick in in 
our stomachs [.] this cannot be happening [.] 
[Redacted] 
These people are those that are tough to 
see in this detention center [.] subtle sur-
geries and cysts in their stomach sure and of 
course some in those conditions are deported 
to their countries in that condition [.] it has 
been so many the cases that we have lived in 
this place [.] we need to be freed from this 
place [.] We need to be free from this place [.] 
We are mothers with our children outside 
crying asking for their mom [.] 
Please we have our hearts shattered with-
out our children so much time and without 
knowing until when [.] Please our children 
are from this country this is their nation 
you cannot separate us from our children [.] 
Please I am the mother of 5 children who 
need me [.] It is tough for me to hear their 
sobbing voice saying mama when do you 
come back and I cannot give them a positive 
answer [.] Please listen to us we need to be 
with our children [.] Please I have nothing 
else to ask except to free us from this ter-
rible place.

CONGRATULATING BLAKE HURST 
UPON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker I rise 
today to recognize my friend and fellow Mis-
sourian, Blake Hurst who will be retiring as 
president of the Missouri Farm Bureau later 
this year. 
Blake raises corn, soybeans and flowers 
with his family and as a farmer himself, knows 
firsthand the challenges Missouri farmers face, 
like devastating floods and changing trade 
tides. Because of this personal knowledge, 
Blake has been able to dutifully serve Missouri 
farmers and ranchers in this post for a dec-
ade, and in several other positions at the Mis-
souri Farm Bureau since the 1980’s. 
With two-thirds of Missouri covered in farm-
land, we are home to a longstanding agricul-
tural tradition that is alive and well today. I am 
extremely grateful that he has spent the last 
ten years as one of the lead advocates, sup-
porters and resources for our state’s ag indus-
try, both in Missouri and on a national level. 
The Missouri Farm Bureau is the oldest in the 
nation and we have been incredibly fortunate 
to have Blake at the helm for the last ten 
years. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of myself and 
my fellow Missouri farmers, I thank him for his 
service and wish him all the best on his future 
endeavors.

HONORING DETECTIVE JONATHAN 
R. MILLER AS A RECIPIENT OF 
THE VALOR AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize City of Fayetteville Police Depart-
ment Detective Jonathan R. Miller as a recipi-
ent of the Public Safety Valor Award, pre-
sented annually by the Greater Fayetteville 
Chamber of Commerce. 
The Valor Award is a prestigious honor pre-
sented to men and women of the Fayetteville 
region who perform acts of heroism under ex-
treme risk. An outstanding member of Fayette-
ville Police Department, Detective Miller went 
beyond his call of duty on the evening of 
Tuesday, August 29, 2019. 
While driving over a bridge, Detective Miller 
witnessed a driver lose consciousness at the 
wheel and swerve into oncoming traffic. He 
saw a woman in the other lane attempt to 
avert the oncoming vehicle and jumped into 
immediate action. Detective Miller pulled over 
and successfully stopped the moving vehicle 
before impact. After securing the scene, he 
called for medical assistance for the uncon-
scious driver. 
Detective Miller is a hero and that night he 
prevented not only a head on collision, but 
also a possible second tragedy from occurring. 
His quick actions, bravery, and dedication to 
service is a credit to him, his family, and the 
entire Fayetteville Police Department. I know I 
speak for everyone in our community when I 
say we are truly grateful for his unwavering 
service and cannot thank him enough. 
Detective Miller is deserving of this honor, 
and I would like to extend my most sincere 
appreciation and wish him success as he con-
tinues to protect our communities. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
celebrating City of Fayetteville Police Depart-
ment Detective Jonathan R. Miller for receiv-
ing the Public Safety Valor Award.

HONORING THE WORK OF DESIGN 
LAB 
BY 
LOCKER 
ROOM 
ATH-
LETICS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST 
COVID–19 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the exceptional work of Design 
Lab by Locker Room Athletics. This local Hot 
Springs business has adapted their existing 
manufacturing to produce customized masks 
for organizations to continue operations during 
COVID–19. 
When many of Locker Room Athletics’ cus-
tomers began to see the effects of the pan-
demic, they reached out to this local business 
to produce masks that could keep employees 
safe while continuing to work. By converting 
their manufacturing capabilities, Locker Room 
Athletics now serves small businesses, local 
school districts, corporations, and government 
agencies across the nation. 
It is work like this that truly sets them apart 
as heroes in a time of national crisis. Not only 
does their service protect the health of their 
fellow man, but it also provides a way for fami-
lies to continue working, for businesses to 
continue running, and for the economy to con-
tinue growing. 
It is an honor to see work like this hap-
pening down the street in Hot Springs, Arkan-
sas. I take this time to thank them for their 
service to our community and for providing an 
example to the rest of the nation of what true 
servant-leadership is.

HONORING 
PARAMEDIC 
HUNTER 
FOX AS A RECIPIENT OF THE 
VALOR AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Cape Fear Valley Emergency 
Medical Services Paramedic Hunter Fox as a 
recipient of the Public Safety Valor Award, 
presented annually by the Greater Fayetteville 
Chamber of Commerce. 
The Valor Award is a prestigious honor pre-
sented to men and women of the Fayetteville 
region who perform acts of heroism under ex-
treme risk. An outstanding member of Cape 
Fear Valley EMS, Mr. Fox went beyond his 
call of duty on March 23, 2020. 
When his ambulance was overturned fol-
lowing a collision with a privately owned motor 
vehicle, Mr. Fox took command of the scene. 
In an act of heroic selflessness, he rendered 
aid to his partner, an EMS student, and the 
critically injured driver of the other vehicle. 
Working in conjunction with other EMS units, 
he successfully triaged all injured individuals 
and ensured that exceptional care was pro-
vided. 
Mr. Fox’s quick actions, bravery, and dedi-
cation to service is a credit to him, his family, 
and Cape Fear Valley EMS. I know I speak for 
everyone in our community when I say we are 
truly grateful for his unwavering service and 
cannot thank him enough. 
Mr. Fox is deserving of this honor, and I 
would like to extend my most sincere appre-
ciation and wish him success as he continues 
to protect our communities. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
celebrating Cape Fear Valley EMS Paramedic 
Hunter Fox for receiving the Public Safety 
Valor Award.

CELEBRATING THE RELEASE OF 
FIRST 
SERGEANT 
JOHN 
E. 
HATLEY 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the release of First Sergeant John 
E. Hatley from Fort Leavenworth. 
First Sergeant Hatley is an American hero 
who, throughout his twenty years of service, 
risked his life for his country time and time 
again. His outstanding military career as a sol-
dier and leader in the U.S. Army is recognized 
by two Bronze Stars and an Army Com-
mendation Medal for Valor—a true testament 
of his commitment to his country and his fel-
low soldiers. 
First Sergeant Hatley was sentenced for the 
premeditated murder of four Shi’ite fighters in 
Iraq despite the complete absence of evi-
dence. Not a single scrap of physical or foren-
sic evidence was found in a thorough inves-
tigation conducted by the Army Criminal Inves-
tigation Division. Notwithstanding this paucity 
of evidence, First Sergeant Hatley has been 
imprisoned for nearly a decade. 
Throughout his time at Fort Leavenworth, 
First Sergeant Hatley has availed himself of 
programs available within the barracks for self- 
improvement, and he has nearly completed a 
Master of Business Administration degree. He 
also consistently maintained a positive atti-
tude, led other inmates by example, and even 
saved a fellow inmate’s life. 
First Sergeant Hatley is a man with strong 
family support, a stellar military record, a phe-
nomenal moral compass, and an essentially 
perfect record while incarcerated. His career 
was characterized by honor, sacrifice, and 
valor. Now that he will return to his rightful 
place in life as a contributing member of soci-
ety, First Sergeant Hatley is planning to build 
a home for his disabled mother and father. He 
also plans to marry his girlfriend, Pamela Mil-
ler. 
John, I hope that you may continue to serve 
as an example to other soldiers and the Amer-
ican people. Thank you for your outstanding 
service to this country. I wish you the best of 
luck as you return to your proper place in soci-
ety, and I wish you a lifetime of happiness in 
your future marriage and life.

HONORING MICHAEL KUNKO 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize Michael Kunko for re-
ceiving the 2020 Encompass Health Rehab 
Award. 
Following a stroke, Mike entered outpatient 
therapy on November 20, 2019. After seven-
teen days of acute care, he transferred to in-
patient rehab for two and a half weeks. At the 
time, he had minimal use of his right arm and 
right leg due to significant hemiparesis, im-
paired vision and functionality, and short-term 
memory loss issues. 
With the help of his positive attitude and 
fighting spirit, Mike persevered. He worked 
hard in rehab and slowly began to see im-
provement. He attended appointments regu-
larly, and he continued his work at home with 
the help and support of his family. As a result 
of his hard work and dedication, I’m pleased 
to report that Mike now can walk without as-
sistance—and even participate in many of the 
activities he enjoyed before he suffered a 
stroke. 
Mike Kunko is a shining example of the 
benefits of hard work and determination. On 
behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional 
District, I congratulate Mike on his progress 
and wish him every continued success in his 
recovery.

HONORING DR. RICHARD RIVERA 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Dr. Richard Rivera on his well- 
deserved retirement from the Weslaco Inde-
pendent School District. Dr. Rivera instilled his 
own philosophy of education throughout the 
local community where now many generations 
share and foster his ideals. He not only 
shaped the community as a school board 
member and superintendent, but also as a 
teacher, role model, and mentor. 
Dr. Rivera’s journey in education began in 
1967 as a schoolteacher and coach. With 
every student he taught, parent he advised, 
and co-worker he befriended, his passion to 
expand and build upon the established edu-
cation system grew, leading him to rise to the 
position of Principal at both Mary Hoge Junior 
High School in 1974 and Weslaco High 
School in 1979. 
Dr. Rivera firmly believes that ‘‘education is 
the great equalizer,’’ and made it his life’s mis-
sion to open doors for the students of our re-
gion. To achieve his vision for the community, 
Dr. Rivera cultivated a nurturing and collabo-
rative environment during his 14 years of serv-
ice as the Weslaco ISD Superintendent. Dr. 
Rivera recognized that in order to make a 
positive impact on students, the educational 
organization and the individuals who make up 
the school setting are critical in enriching and 
growing students’ knowledge and experience. 
As such, our region’s education system under-
went a phase of great transformation. Student 
academic programs were expanded, school 
facilities were upgraded, and staff engagement 
was prioritized. 
Dr. Rivera believed in investing in people 
and prioritized mentoring his employees. 
There are countless testimonies from Weslaco 
ISD Staff who credit their careers to Dr. 
Rivera’s dedication and deep commitment to 
employee support programs. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize Dr. Richard Rivera for his 53 years of 
wholehearted devotion to the students and 
teachers of Weslaco. Dr. Rivera has undoubt-
edly had an indelible impact on educators 
throughout our region and has made a lasting 
impression on our students. I commend him 
on a well-earned retirement and wish him the 
best in every future endeavor.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ALAN LEVY 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of my dear 
friend, and pillar of the South Florida commu-
nity, Alan Levy. Alan called Fort Lauderdale 
home for more than 70 years and was the 
founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Presi-
dent of Great American Farms, a Pompano 
Beach-based agricultural marketing firm. He 
passed away on October 7, 2020, at the age 
of 80. 
Alan was a selfless leader who served on 
numerous nonprofit boards and was a pas-
sionate supporter of HANDY, a nonprofit that 
serves at-risk youth in South Florida. He dedi-
cated a large portion of his life to helping 
youth and families in our community by ensur-
ing they had every opportunity to succeed, 
serving as a beacon of hope for the less fortu-
nate. 
His dedication and passion for nonprofit or-
ganizations was beyond compare. Once he 
was asked, if he could wave a magic wand 
and do two things for Broward County what 
would they be? Alan responded by saying he 
‘‘wanted to strengthen our educational system 
from early childhood all the way through to 
universities.’’ He continued by saying, ‘‘Seeing 
is believing. We can’t just sit here and wait for 
somebody else to do it. You’ve got to get be-
hind it, make the decision that you are going 
to make it happen, believe in it, and have a 
passion for its success.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Alan did just that, he sup-
ported our community, believed in all of us, 
and because of that unyielding passion, en-
sured our success and the success of genera-
tions to come. It is true that our community 
has lost a hero, but it is undoubtedly the case 
that we are better for having had Alan in our 
lives. I will miss him dearly. I extend my heart-
felt condolences to his wife, Marsha, and his 
children, Eric and Hope. I pray they find com-
fort during this extremely difficult time. May 
Alan’s life and legacy live on for generations 
to come. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE ASSOCIA-
TION OF BRAZIL’S INDIGENOUS 
PEOPLES (APIB) 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Association of Bra-
zil’s Indigenous Peoples (APIB) and their inter-
nationally respected leader, Secretary General 
Sonia Guajajara, for receiving the prestigious 
Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award from the 
Institute for Policy Studies on October 15, 
2020. 
I would like to add my heartfelt congratula-
tions for their important work in defense of the 
rights of Indigenous Peoples from across 
Brazil and protection of the many natural eco-
systems that are part of Brazil’s ancestral terri-
tories. 
APIB and Brazil’s National Indigenous 
Movement have raised the profile of Indige-
nous rights issues through impressive grass-
roots mobilizations, such as the annual Free 
Land Camp, the implementation of the Indige-
nous Emergency Plan to Combat COVID–19, 
precedent-setting legal victories before the 
Brazilian Supreme Court, and international ad-
vocacy among influential spaces like the Inter- 
American Commission on Human Rights and 
the United Nations. 
I share my special admiration for the power-
ful leadership roles played by many Indige-
nous women at both national and local levels, 
even with the iminent threats coming from the 
administration of President Jair Bolsonaro. Un-
fortunately, under President Bolsonaro’s ad-
ministration, there has been an increase of 
violent actions against Indigenous peoples, 
like the invasions into Indigenous lands, illegal 
exploitation of natural resources and other in-
cidents, rising from 109 cases in 2018 to 256 
last year. This also includes the threats 
against and killings of Indigenous leaders and 
Forest Guardians, like Emyra Waja˜pi, Paulo 
Paulino Guajajara, and Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, 
among countless others. 
While those situations are condemnable, I 
applaud the work performed by APIB during 
these difficult times, and as they continue to 
create a movement of solidarity. Since 2005, 
APIB’s presence has been essential to 
strengthening and unifying Indigenous peo-
ples’ demands, politics, and rights. By building 
and strengthening alliances with the inter-
national Indigenous movement and other so-
cial movements, APIB is contributing to protect 
natural resources and promoting sustainable 
management of lands. 
To conclude, I’d like to mention APIB Sec-
retary General Sonia Guajajara’s words: ‘‘Our 
lives are inextricable from the natural world. 
The creatures of the rainforest protect us, and 
in turn we protect them. We are the only buff-
ers protecting our thinning forests. Our battle 
is not just for the future. It’s for the present.’’ 
Thank you, APIB, for your extraordinary and 
essential work for the rights of Indigenous 
Peoples and the Earth.

HONORING EVAN RENNINGER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Evan Renninger for 
receiving Encompass Health Rehab’s Advo-
cacy Award. 
Like many Americans, Evan faced unprece-
dented challenges during the coronavirus cri-
sis and courageously overcame these obsta-
cles. 
At the onset of the pandemic, Evan’s wife 
was admitted to Encompass Health Rehab 
due to a cerebrovascular accident following 
childbirth. To protect patients, Encompass had 
eliminated visitation. Knowing that the alter-
native would leave his wife vulnerable to lone-
liness and other mental health challenges 
shortly after the birth of their child, Evan de-
cided to move into the hospital so that he 
could support her each day in her recovery. In 
doing so, he demonstrated many of the char-
acteristics of the American spirit: selflessness, 
devotion to family, and support for each other 
in the midst of adversity. 
Madam Speaker, the virtues demonstrated 
by Evan during this challenging season dem-
onstrate the best of America. It is my honor to 
recognize Evan Renninger for his advocacy 
and dedication. On behalf of the 13th District 
of Pennsylvania, I wish Evan and his family 
continued health and happiness in the chap-
ters to come.

HONORING THE CITY OF FAYETTE-
VILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS 
A 
RECIPIENT 
OF 
THE 
VALOR 
AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 13, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the City of Fayetteville Police De-
partment as a recipient of the Public Safety 
Valor Award, presented annually by the Great-
er Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce. 
The Valor Award is a prestigious honor pre-
sented to men and women of the Fayetteville 
region who perform acts of heroism under ex-
treme risk. In honor of heroic efforts by the 
Fayetteville Police Department on July 5, 
2019, this award recognizes the combined ac-
tions of Sergeant Steven Bates, Lieutenant Mi-
chael Mulcahy, and Officers Daniel Jackson, 
Hakim 
Madyun, 
James 
McLeod, 
Jared 
Backey, Jeffrey Prevatte, Nicholas Wrench, 
Rachel Wood, Robert Ostendorf, and Steph-
anie Collins. 
When responding to a 911 distress call 
about a hostage situation at a private resi-
dence, these courageous men and women 
were met with gunfire immediately upon ar-
rival. In an incredible display of teamwork, 
they worked together and secured the scene, 
apprehended the subject, and removed the 
hostages without any civilian casualties. 
These men and women represent the best 
our nation has to offer, and I applaud them for 
their quick actions, bravery, and dedication to 
service. I know I speak for everyone in our 
community when I say we are truly grateful for 
their unwavering service and cannot thank 
them enough. 
The Fayetteville Police Department is de-
serving of this honor, and I would like to ex-
tend my most sincere appreciation and best 
wishes to them as they continue to protect our 
community. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
celebrating the City of Fayetteville Police De-
partment for receiving the Public Safety Valor 
Award.
