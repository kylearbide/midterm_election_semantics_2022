CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Washington, DC, May 7, 2020. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: Please accept this 
letter as a formal resignation of my position 
on the Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee; a seat I hold on a waiver, to 
allow for newly elected member, Rep. Kweisi 
Mfume to be appointed. In a time when over-
sight and accountability is of the utmost im-
portance, I am honored to have served along-
side my colleagues working to root our 
waste, fraud, and abuse in government to im-
prove the lives of all Americans. 
I ran for Congress on the promise of hold-
ing those who threaten our democracy and 
institutions accountable. Thank you for the 
opportunity to raise issues of critical impor-
tance to our democracy and give my unique 
perspective to ensure our government is 
working for New Mexico families and the 
American people. If an opportunity to serve 
on this committee were to become available 
in the future, I stand ready to fill the posi-
tion. 
I am available to offer any assistance nec-
essary to facilitate a seamless transition of 
duties and responsibilities to my successor. I 
trust Representative Mfume will continue to 
contribute to the much-needed investigative 
work taking place in our nation’s capital. I 
look forward to the continued success of this 
committee. 
Sincerely, 
DEB HAALAND, 
Member of Congress.

objection, the resignation is accepted.

HONORING THE LIFE OF OVER-
LAND 
PARK 
POLICE 
OFFICER 
MIKE MOSHER 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor Officer Mike Mosher who was 
killed in the line of duty on May 3, 2020. Offi-
cer Mosher served with the Overland Park Po-
lice Department for 14 years and was the 
President of the Overland Park Fraternal 
Order of Police. 
Officer Mosher was passionate about his job 
and served valiantly in our community. He is 
described by colleagues, friends, and family 
as a dedicated father and a true gentleman. In 
2018, Officer Mosher was one of two officers 
to stop an active shooter. He earned the Gold 
Valor Award and was named Officer of the 
Year at the Metro Chiefs Awards for Valor. Of-
ficer Mosher also loved bringing the commu-
nity together. He organized events like Shop 
with a Cop, served as a field training officer, 
and played a major role in starting the Shoot 
for the Gold fundraiser, which raised tens of 
thousands of dollars for the Special Olympics. 
My thoughts are with Officer Mosher’s wife 
and daughter during this difficult time. I join 
the Overland Park community in expressing 
my deep gratitude for Officer Mosher’s service 
as we mourn his passing.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF EARL G. GRAVES, SR. 
HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY III 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life and legacy of 
Earl G. Graves, Sr., a business icon, civil 
rights legend, and close friend to my grand-
father. 
Born in Brooklyn in 1935, Mr. Graves was 
the child of hardworking immigrants from Bar-
bados and Trinidad. After graduating with a 
business degree from Morgan State University 
and spending time in the United States Army, 
he moved back home to the Bedford- 
Stuyvesant neighborhood and immediately 
began serving his community. 
As part of his organizing work, Mr. Graves 
helped organize a rally for my grandfather, 
Robert F. Kennedy in the mid-1960s. My 
grandfather was so impressed that he offered 
Mr. Graves a job almost immediately as an 
administrative assistant in his Senate office. 
From there, he used his business acumen to 
launch a newsletter to support the Black busi-
ness community, which eventually evolved into 
Black Enterprise. 
More than just a conventional publication, 
Black Enterprise lifted up the successes of 
Black businessmen and women. Within its 
pages, Mr. Graves empowered his community 
and gave voice to minority-owned businesses 
across the country. He led by example, and 
our nation is better for the course he set. 
Beyond his professional career, Earl was a 
devoted husband to Barbara Kydd and a lov-
ing, proud father of three sons, Earl Jr., John, 
and Michael. 
As they mourn his loss and as this Nation 
that he helped build celebrates his memory, 
our hearts are with every single person whose 
life he touched.

HONORING IOWA’S VOLUNTEERS 
AS IOWANS OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing the Iowans making a difference 
during National Volunteer Week by helping 
local families keep food on the table during 
the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The efforts 
of each individual working to support our most 
vulnerable populations are commendable, and 
for that I am naming these volunteers Iowan of 
the Week. 
National Volunteer Week, observed April 
19–25 this year, provides an opportunity to re-
flect on the importance of giving back to our 
communities. Volunteerism, even in its sim-
plest forms, has the power to be trans-
formative; this is something Iowans know to 
be true. Our values of hard work, selflessness, 
and contributing to build a stronger community 
are reflected in the way Iowans lead their daily 
lives. While we may shine a light on vol-
unteerism this week, Iowans engage in giving 
back year-round. 
As communities across my district face the 
devasting impacts of COVID–19, we’ve seen a 
significant rise in the number of individuals 
turning to food banks for support. In the past 
few weeks, the pandemic has caused an his-
toric leap in unemployment. Families’ budgets 
have become more strained and those who 
were already food-insecure have been pushed 
to their limits. And while schools remain 
closed, we’ve faced growing concerns for chil-
dren who rely on their school meals for their 
daily nutritional needs. 
In the last two weeks of March alone, the 
DMARC Food Pantry Network saw more than 
1,000 people make their first-ever visit to the 
pantry. That is quadruple the number of first- 
time users DMARC recorded during the first 
half of March. 
Amidst those sobering statistics, we’ve also 
seen men and women step up in droves to 
lend their time, talent, and resources to keep 
others from going hungry. I would like to ex-
tend my deepest gratitude to the workers and 
volunteers at food banks and school meal dis-
tribution sites in central and southwest Iowa. 
Time and again in recent weeks, I’ve seen 
Iowans take action to make sure their neigh-
bors have safe access to essential nutrition. 
Volunteers are not only donating food at in-
creased rates, but are also putting on masks 
and gloves and showing up at their local food 
banks to assemble thousands of meals for de-
livery to those who need support or can’t risk 
leaving their homes. Food Bank of Iowa had 
570 volunteers dedicate just shy of 3,000 
hours last month even with the new restric-
tions on how many volunteers can be in the 
facilities at one time. 
Volunteers 
have 
donated 
hundreds 
of 
masks to be used by drivers and others work-
ing in the pantries. One group of 15 volunteers 
turned 3,000 tee shirts into totes that Food 
Bank of Iowa now uses to distribute food. And 
the organization’s BackPack sacks and bags 
that are distributed to children across its serv-
ice area have been filled with inspirational 
cards made by families at home. 
Our schools have also worked tirelessly to 
continue to provide meals for their students 
now learning at home. Des Moines Public 
Schools, the largest school district in Iowa, 
has successfully banded together district em-
ployees and dedicated volunteers to distribute 
18,000 meals Monday through Thursday, plus 
54,000 meals on Fridays, to ensure its stu-
dents aren’t trying to learn on an empty stom-
ach. 
I stand before you today humbled, yet 
again, at the perseverance of my constituents 
in Iowa’s Third District in the face of this pan-
demic. Iowans have continued to rise to the 
occasion and support those in need, even at 
the risk of their own health. I started Iowan of 
the Week knowing we would never face a 
shortage of incredible people to highlight, and 
this pandemic has brought out even more ev-
eryday heroes who deserve recognition. It is 
my privilege to honor the workers and volun-
teers of Iowa’s food banks and school meal 
distribution sites as Iowans of the Week.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
DONALD KENNEDY 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the life and work of an ex-
traordinary American, Donald Kennedy. 
Donald Kennedy was born in New York City 
to Barbara Bean and William Dorsey Kennedy, 
on August 18, 1931, and died in Redwood 
City, California on April 21, 2020. 
Donald Kennedy’s career was long, produc-
tive and illustrious. He received his BA, MS 
and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University. 
He began as a biology teacher at Syracuse 
University, then became an Assistant Pro-
fessor at Stanford University in 1960, earning 
tenure in 1962, and he was made Chair of the 
Department of Biology in the School of Hu-
manities and Sciences in 1967. In 1976 he

was awarded the Dinkelspiel Award for Out-
standing Service to Undergraduate Education, 
one of Stanford’s highest honors, and served 
as a trustee of the David and Lucile Packard 
Foundation. During the Carter Administration 
he served as Commissioner of the FDA, 
where he dealt with many controversies, earn-
ing the praise of consumers and industry alike 
for his leadership. He returned to Stanford in 
1979 and became its eighth president in 1980. 
During his distinguished tenure he grew the 
University’s endowment to $2 billion, inaugu-
rated overseas campuses in Japan and Eng-
land, established the Haas Center for Public 
Service and the Stanford-in-Washington cam-
pus. In 1992 he resigned from the presidency, 
and remained at Stanford. In 2000 he became 
Editor-in-Chief of Science, a post he held until 
2008. He received the Carl Sagan Prize for 
Science Popularization, and was a fellow of 
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 
and the American Academy of Sciences. He 
was the author of several books including his 
memoir, A Place in the Sun. 
No list of Donald Kennedy’s extraordinary 
accomplishments can describe the man he 
was. Proud yet humble, erudite and playful, 
and beloved by his students. I was privileged 
to call him my friend, and I’m exceedingly 
grateful to have benefitted from his wise coun-
sel. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in extending our 
condolences to Donald Kennedy’s wife Robin, 
and his children Page Kennedy Rochon 
(Mark); Julia Kennedy Tussing (Ted); Cam-
eron Kennedy (Rick Desimone); and Jamie 
Hamill (Rosario), and nine grandchildren. Don-
ald Kennedy made our country stronger and 
made our world a better place. He will always 
be missed by all those who had the good for-
tune to know him, and he will be a lasting 
source of inspiration to the generations he 
helped shape.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise with 
deep concern regarding the state of U.S. lead-
ership during the global COVID–19 pandemic. 
Tragically, over 200,000 people have died 
worldwide, with more than 3 million confirmed 
cases. This likely represents just the tip of the 
viral iceberg. 
The Coronavirus pandemic has caused the 
worst global health crisis since the 1918 Span-
ish flu epidemic. 
Real leadership could have contained this 
devastation. Instead of leading the global re-
sponse though, the Administration ignored re-
peated warnings from his intelligence experts 
and undermined the seriousness of the threat. 
Those at the very top called it a hoax, squab-
bled over the name of the virus, undermined 
G–7 unity, closed the U.S. border with Europe 
without consulting our closest allies, and sig-
nificantly delayed the opportunity to slow the 
spread of the disease both globally and do-
mestically. 
Worse yet, despite warnings during the ad-
ministration transition of the possible security 
threats of a viral pandemic, they hollowed out 
and eliminated the National Security Council’s 
Directorate for Global Health Security and Bio-
defense at Home. Now, we face the highest 
number of reported infections in the world, 
with more than 970,000 cases, and an alarm-
ing risk of spread rates because we still lack 
adequate testing capabilities. 
In the absence of American leadership, ma-
lign actors including China, Russia and Cuba 
have filled the void. They provided and 
pledged humanitarian assistance to Italy, the 
Philippines, and other nations in desperate 
need of assistance. Authoritarian governments 
have used the ensuing chaos to consolidate 
their rule. Take Russian President Putin’s con-
stitutional referendum to extend presidential 
term limits or Hungarian Prime Minister 
Orban’s recent parliamentary moves to rule by 
decree. But worse yet, also to spread misin-
formation about the disease and democratic 
response. Threatening further the domestic 
political divisions already ripe with tension. 
What makes our nation great is not only the 
American people’s ingenuity to solve problems 
at home, but also our generosity and creativity 
to lead with our values when the world faces 
crisis. Six years ago, the U.S. led the fight 
against the Ebola crisis from the beginning. 
We developed, coordinated, and led a world-
wide response to the Ebola outbreak, as well 
as strengthened our preparedness at home. 
As a result, we stopped the outbreak and kept 
the homeland safe. 
It is long past time for the Administration to 
play a leading role in the global pandemic co-
ordination response. As the richest nation on 
earth with leading global health experts, real 
leadership would coordinate and contain the 
virus domestically then turn to aid the inter-
national community. Real leadership would not 
cast blame and withhold international aid to 
organizations leading the global fight. Real 
leadership would be fully supporting critical, 
independent news outlets like Radio Free Eu-
rope/Radio Liberty and Voice of America who 
are providing credible news services and 
countering 
Russian 
and 
Chinese 
disinformation. 
Americans are at risk of further waves of in-
fection back in the homeland. The most vul-
nerable around the world are suffering. Global 
coordination and collaboration is vital, not only 
to keep Americans safe, but also to maintain 
the U.S.’s position as the leader of the free 
world and to maintain democratic values in 
countries across the globe.

RECOGNIZING THE SACOMANI 
FAMILY 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Michael and Tonya 
Sacomani and their kids for turning the difficul-
ties of social distancing and confinement into 
a positive. 
The Sacomani’s had to quickly adapt after 
their family trip, a cruise for the kids’ spring 
break, was canceled due to COVID–19. 
During these long days of social distancing 
and isolation, the Sacomani’s turned to a 
camping staycation in their own backyard, 
which backs up to the Saline River. 
The Sacomani’s made it their family mission 
to clean up as much of the Saline River as 
they can during the quarantine. 
Their list of cleaned up trash is incredible, 
so far including refrigerators, stoves, ski boats 
lodged in trees, a hot tub lodged in a tree, and 
hundreds of tires. 
I would like to extend a hand of gratitude to 
the Sacomani’s for their worthwhile commit-
ment to hard work, our environment and nat-
ural resources.

HONORING OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor our law enforcement officers from 
across our nation. This year National Police 
Week kicks off on May 10, which we dedicate 
time on the calendar to honor, remember, and 
celebrate American Law Enforcement. 
Since 1962, National Police Week continues 
to pay special recognition to those law en-
forcement officers who have lost their lives in 
the line of duty for the safety and protection of 
others. 
Each year, hundreds of American law en-
forcement officers are killed in the line of duty. 
In respect, honor, and remembrance their 
names are added to the walls of the National 
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Wash-
ington, D.C. This year, 307 names are being 
engraved on those walls, adding to the nearly 
22,000 killed in the line of duty already memo-
rialized there. 
Our law enforcement officers protect our 
communities by keeping us safe from harm, 
and even putting their own lives in jeopardy to 
save ours. Throughout my district, I’ve seen 
firsthand how committed our local officers are 
in keeping our communities safe and striving 
to protect our families by acting courageously 
when they come across harm. 
Given the unprecedented health threat of 
COVID–19, our law enforcement officers re-
main committed to serving our people. I would 
like to take this time to thank our brave men 
and women for risking their lives every single 
day. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
our brave men and women who serve in our 
front lines and for all our fallen heroes who 
made the ultimate sacrifice.

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

first women elected to serve as a Wayne 
County Commissioner. Isaac looked to his 
mother’s example and pursued a career in 
public service. After earning his Juris Doc-
torate degree from Northwestern University 
Pritzker School of Law, Isaac went on to work 
for the United Automobile Workers as well as 
Michigan Teamsters Joint Council No. 43 be-
fore founding his own law firm. 
Isaac’s work on behalf of laborers only gal-
vanized his resolve to work on behalf of the 
public. In 2018, he was elected to serve as 
State Representative to Michigan’s Fourth Dis-
trict. Isaac was a ferocious advocate for the 
people he served, championing environmental 
justice issues, disability rights, and housing 
rights. Isaac Robinson was a big-hearted and 
passionate advocate for the people he served, 
and he will be sorely missed. 
I therefore ask you to please join me in hon-
oring the memory of State Representative 
Isaac Robinson.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
STARBASE PROGRAM 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce legislation to include the Northern 
Mariana Islands and American Samoa in the 
Department of Defense STARBASE Program. 
STARBASE is a grant program aimed at im-
proving math and science skills through part-
nerships between military installations and 
schools with high proportions of economically 
and educationally disadvantaged students. 
STARBASE students participate in hands-on 
activities 
and 
real-world 
applications 
of 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math 
(STEM) led by military personnel in these ca-
reer fields. The program primarily focuses on 
fifth graders including those historically under-
represented in STEM fields to attract and pre-
pare them at an early age to pursue and suc-
ceed in related coursework and careers. 
STARBASE 2.0 focuses on middle school stu-
dents in an after-school, mentor program for-
mat. 
Such a beneficial educational experience 
should be available to all students in our coun-
try including the Northern Mariana Islands and 
American Samoa. The law establishing the 
STARBASE program currently defines ‘‘state’’ 
to include the District of Columbia, Puerto 
Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. My legis-
lation would ensure all U.S. territories are in-
cluded in this definition. 
The gentlewoman from American Samoa, 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN, is an original cosponsor of 
the bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation. 
HONORING IOWA’S BLOOD BANKS 
AND VOLUNTEERS AS IOWANS 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing the men and women working 
and volunteering across Iowa to maintain a 
critical component of our health care system: 
blood donation. Whether they’re blood center 
employees or volunteer blood donors, these 
individuals are quite literally rolling up their 
sleeves to make a difference in their commu-
nities during the coronavirus outbreak. For that 
commitment, it is my honor to celebrate each 
and every one of them as Iowan of the Week. 
The Surgeon General of the United States, 
Jerome Adams, recently called upon the pub-
lic, especially Millennials and Gen Z, to con-
sider donating blood during this crisis. He and 
the FDA reiterated that blood donation is safe 
and blood centers have been taking extra pre-
cautions to adhere to new CDC guidelines by 
spacing beds at least six feet apart, dis-
infecting surfaces between patient visits, tem-
perature checking the staff, conducting addi-
tional screening of donors, and encouraging 
advance scheduling of appointments. 
I join the Surgeon General and FDA in call-
ing upon healthy, eligible Iowans to continue 
donating blood to maintain a safe, stable, and 
adequate community blood supply. Since 
COVID–19 began to spread in our country, 
thousands of blood drives have been can-
celled and blood center donations have 
slowed significantly, resulting in several hun-
dred thousand fewer blood donations nation-
wide. Without increased donor turnout, the 
United States will soon face a serious blood 
shortage. 
When disaster strikes or we find ourselves 
in the midst of a public health crisis like the 
coronavirus outbreak, it is the blood on the 
shelves that saves lives. It’s part of our na-
tion’s readiness to face this challenge head 
on. Not only are health care professionals car-
ing for those affected by COVID–19, but 
they’re also still working 24/7 caring for cancer 
patients, trauma victims, and those in need of 
surgery. The need for blood is constant. One 
standard donation—an act that takes a few 
minutes—can save up to three lives and helps 
maintain the community blood supply. 
Donated blood is an essential part of caring 
for patients, and every blood center in the 
country is affected by this pandemic. I encour-
age every healthy, eligible Iowan to make an 
appointment to donate blood at their local 
blood center in the coming weeks. Remember: 
it is safe to donate blood; blood centers are 
taking every precaution to protect Workers 
and donors; there have been no reported or 
suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted 
COVID–19; and donating blood will not lower 
your immune system. It’s normal to feel fear 
during this time of uncertainty, but Iowans can 
be sure their blood donation will make a posi-
tive impact in our fight against this disease. 
I applaud our local blood center employees 
at places like LifeServe who are putting their 
community first by still going into work each 
day; their dedication and bravery in the face of 
coronavirus is inspiring. I also applaud local 
blood donors who, by no exaggeration, are 
saving the lives of their neighbors in need. 
Both are nothing short of heroic, and it is my 
honor to recognize them as Iowans of the 
Week.

CORONAVIRUS FRONTLINE WORK-
ERS FAIR PAY ACT OF 2020, H.R. 
6709 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, during 
the COVID–19 public health and economic cri-
sis, essential workers are confronting signifi-
cant risks to their health and the safety of their 
families in order to provide our communities 
with life-sustaining services. Health care work-
ers, grocery store personnel, first responders, 
and other brave workers deserve hazard pay 
for the risks they are taking to provide critical 
services during this unprecedented national 
crisis. 
On May 5, 2020 I was proud to introduce 
H.R. 6709, the Coronavirus Frontline Workers 
Fair Pay Act of 2020, which would establish a 
dedicated fund in the U.S. Treasury to provide 
employers with coronavirus hazard pay funds 
to be passed on to high-risk health care work-
ers and other essential workers on the 
frontlines of the fight against this virus. This 
hazard pay would be an important step in rec-
ognizing the sacrifices and contributions of 
countless Americans, including those health 
care workers that are in high risk positions. 
H.R. 6709 would guarantee hazard pay for 
individuals working in high-risk health care 
roles between January 27, 2020 and Decem-
ber 31, 2020. For the purposes of H.R. 6709, 
the definition of ‘‘high-risk health care worker’’ 
is intended to include, at minimum, individuals 
in the following occupations, as specified 
under major group 29 or 31 in the 2018 
Standard Occupational Classification System: 
Pharmacists; Physician Assistants; Podia-
trists; 
Respiratory 
Therapists; 
Registered 
Nurses; Nurse Anesthetists; Nurse Midwives; 
Nurse Practitioners; Anesthesiologists; Cardi-
ologists; Dermatologists; Emergency Medicine 
Physicians; Family Medicine Physicians; Gen-
eral Internal Medicine Physicians; Neurolo-
gists. 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Pediatri-
cians, General; Physicians, Pathologists; Psy-
chiatrists; Radiologists; Physicians, All Other; 
Ophthalmologists, Except Pediatric; Ortho-
pedic Surgeons, Except Pediatric; Pediatric 
Surgeons; Surgeons, All Other; Medical and 
Clinical Laboratory Technologists; Medical and 
Clinical 
Laboratory 
Technicians; 
Cardio-
vascular Technologists and Technicians; Diag-
nostic Medical Sonographers; Nuclear Medi-
cine Technologists. 
Radiologic Technologists and Technicians; 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologists; 
Medical 
Dosimetrists; 
Emergency 
Medical 
Technicians; Paramedics; Pharmacy Techni-
cians; Psychiatric Technicians; Surgical Tech-
nologists; Licensed Practical and Licensed Vo-
cational Nurses; Surgical Assistants; Home 
Health Aides; Personal Care Aides; Nursing 
Assistants; Orderlies; Psychiatric Aides. 
This list is not exhaustive; but is illustrative 
of the many health care workers that are fac-
ing extraordinary risks to keep Americans safe

CONGRATULATING RICHARD 
BOYER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Richard Boyer 
on celebrating his 100th birthday on Wednes-
day, May 6, 2020. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 
13th Congressional District, I congratulate Mr. 
Boyer on reaching this momentous milestone. 
A proud World War II veteran, a dedicated 
member of our community, and a former small 
business owner, Mr. Boyer is a true hero in 
Franklin County. Earlier this year, it was my 
privilege to present Mr. Boyer with several 
medals honoring his service in the U.S. Navy, 
and to hear him recount some of the stories 
of his youth. 
After completing basic training, Mr. Boyer’s 
company was assigned to a new destroyer 
and sent to Cuba in the fall of 1940 and then 
to Europe. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, 
Boyer’s ship was sent to Norfolk, Virginia, to 
add implements of war to the ship before trav-
eling to Pearl Harbor. Once in Pearl Harbor, 
Marines boarded the ship and they departed 
for Midway Island. Boyer also served aboard 
the USS Gwin DD–433 during the Doolittle 
Raid. 
After nearly eight years of military service, 
Mr. Boyer returned to Franklin County with his 
wife, Mary Jane. Longtime residents of South 
Mountain, Mr. and Mrs. Boyer operated the 
Big Dipper Restaurant and Dance Hall, a pop-
ular location in the Rouzerville area, until it 
closed in 1970. 
It is my sincere pleasure and privilege to 
honor Richard Boyer for his many years of 
service to our Franklin County community and 
to the United States of America. Over the past 
century, he has lived a remarkable life. I wish 
Mr. Boyer a very happy 100th birthday and 
every continued happiness.

THANKING 
HOMETOWN 
HERO 
KELLI 
MARTIN 
FOR 
OPENING 
THE FREE FOOD PORCH PANTRY 
DURING THE COVID–19 PANDEMIC 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Kelli Martin, who opened a food pan-
try on her front porch to feed the hungry dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. Since opening 
the ‘‘Free Food Porch Pantry,’’ her operation 
has tripled from one to three tables. 
Ms. Martin is a Certified Nursing Assistant 
who saw a need in her neighborhood once the 
coronavirus pandemic hit. The West Bluff 
Neighborhood in Peoria sits amid a food 
desert in the area, where residents have to 
make a long trek just to get to a grocery store. 
The state’s stay-at-home order has caused 
many of the neighborhood’s residents to lose 
their jobs. News spread in the neighborhood 
and on Facebook about the food pantry porch 
and more and more people began to rely on 
this generous service to feed their families or 
donate their own supplies. Ms. Martin is a 
Hometown Hero who cares about her neigh-
bors and community. I commend Ms. Martin 
for taking immediate action so her neighbors 
do not go hungry. 
It is because of leaders such as Ms. Martin 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally thank Ms. Kelli 
Martin for her actions amidst a global pan-
demic to keep her neighbors from going hun-
gry.

HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Ms. Katherine Boyd Brown, a resi-
dent of Highland Park, Michigan, as she cele-
brates her one hundredth birthday. 
Born one hundred years ago, Ms. Boyd 
Brown lives life to the fullest. The beloved ma-
triarch of her family, Ms. Boyd Brown counts 
her children, grandchildren, and her many 
family members as blessings in her life. Her 
strength, grace, and love for life has had a tre-
mendous positive impact on all who know her. 
Though separated by miles from her family, 
Ms. Boyd Brown is surrounded by the con-
stant love and warmth of her family who holds 
her in their prayers and warm wishes as she 
celebrates this milestone. 
Please join me in celebrating Katherine 
Boyd Brown’s birthday as we wish her well in 
the years to come.

HONORING 
OUR 
LAW 
ENFORCE-
MENT DURING NATIONAL POLICE 
WEEK 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the great sacrifice of our 
Nation’s men and women in law enforcement. 
May 10th is the beginning of National Police 
Week. This week is a time for all Americans 
to pause and pay tribute to those who serve 
in law enforcement, and to remember those 
who have fallen. 
Everyday our nation’s law enforcement offi-
cers leave their homes and families to make 
sure that our communities are safe. During 
these uncertain times, law enforcement offi-
cers play a vital role on the front lines to re-
duce the spread of COVID–19. I have always 
been amazed at the willingness of our law en-
forcement officers to put themselves in harms 
way for their neighbors, friends, family, and 
strangers. 
During this National Police Week, take a 
moment and say thank you to your local law 
enforcement officers and continue to be grate-
ful that there are those among us who are will-
ing to risk their lives to keep our communities 
safe. 
I thank the Law Enforcement Agencies of 
the Florida 12th Congressional District. We 
are eternally grateful for their sacrifice.

LEGISLATION TO SECURE AMER-
ICAN 
SPACE 
LAUNCH 
PRE-
EMINENCE 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 8, 2020 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I, along with 
my colleague, Representative CHARLIE CRIST, 
feel our nation’s robust commercial space 
launch industry is threatened by increased 
subsidies from foreign government entities. 
This threat does not only adversely impact 
U.S. space launch providers, but it will ad-
versely impact our ability to have affordable 
and assured ability to launch critical U.S. na-
tional security payloads. 
There are unfair practices coming from 
China, India, Russia and Europe. 
These countries have taken notice of U.S. 
market growth and are funding their own 
launch vehicle development and providing di-
rect subsidies to compete with and take mar-
ket share from the U.S. commercial launch 
companies. 
To level the playing field, the American 
Space Commerce Act extends existing space 
launch tax incentives for an additional ten 
years for companies that launch their payloads 
from the United States. 
The 2019 Report to Congress of the U.S.- 
China Economic and Security Review Com-
mission states that ‘‘China is taking steps to 
establish a commanding position in the com-
mercial launch and satellite sectors relying in 
part on aggressive state-backed financing that 
foreign 
market-driven 
companies 
cannot 
match.’’ 
The report further adds, ‘‘China has already 
succeeded in undercutting some U.S. and 
other foreign launch and satellite providers in 
the international market, threatening to hollow 
out these countries’ space industrial bases.’’ 
A strong domestic space launch industry is 
in the national security interest of the United 
States. Foreign launch providers are heavily 
subsidized by their governments and use 
these subsidies to intentionally price below the 
cost to undercut American competition, materi-
ally harming the American industrial base. 
The American Space Commerce Act will 
help our domestic space launch industry and 
keep the United States a leader in space.
