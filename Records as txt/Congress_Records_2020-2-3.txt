Manager SCHIFF to begin the presen-
tation on the part of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the U.S. Senate, coun-
sel for the President. 
Almost 170 years ago, Senator Daniel 
Webster of Massachusetts took to the 
well of the Old Senate Chamber, not far 
from where I am standing. He delivered 
what would become perhaps his most 
famous 
address, 
the 
‘‘Seventh 
of 
March’’ speech. Webster sought to rally 
his colleagues to adopt the Com-
promise of 1850, a package of legisla-
tion that he and others hoped would 
forestall a civil war brewing over the 
question of slavery. 
He said: 
It is fortunate that there is a Senate of the 
United States; a body not yet moved from its 
propriety, not lost to a just sense of its own 
dignity, and its own high responsibilities, 
and a body to which the country looks with 
confidence, for wise, moderate, patriotic, and 
healing counsels. It is not to be denied that 
we live in the midst of strong agitations and 
are surrounded by very considerable dangers 
to our institutions and our government. The 
imprisoned winds are let loose . . . but I 
have a duty to perform, and I mean to per-
form it with fidelity—not without a sense of 
surrounding dangers, but not without hope. 
Webster was wrong to believe that 
the Compromise of 1850 could prevent 
secession of the South, but I hope he 
was not wrong to put his faith in the 
Senate because the design of the Con-
stitution and the intention of the 
Framers was that the Senate would be 
a Chamber removed from the sway of 
temporary political winds. 
In Federalist 65, Hamilton wrote: 
Where else than in the Senate could have 
been found a tribal sufficiently dignified, or 
sufficiently independent? What other body 
would be likely to feel confidence enough in 
its own situation, to preserve, unawed and 
uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality be-
tween an individual accused, and the rep-
resentatives of the people, his accusers? 
In the same essay, Hamilton ex-
plained this about impeachment: 
The subjects of its jurisdiction are those 
offenses which proceed from the misconduct 
of public men, or, in other words, from the 
abuse or violation of some public trust. They 
are of a nature which may with peculiar pro-
priety be denominated political, as they re-
late chiefly to injuries done immediately to 
the society itself. 
The prosecution of them, for this reason, 
will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the 
whole community, and to divide it into par-
ties more or less friendly or inimical to the 
accused . . . in such cases there will always 
be the greatest danger that the decision will 
be regulated more by the comparative 
strength of parties, than by the real dem-
onstrations of innocence or guilt. 
Daniel Webster and Alexander Ham-
ilton placed their hopes in you, the 
Senate, to be the court of greatest im-
partiality, to be a neutral representa-
tive of the people in determining— 
uninfluenced by party or preexisting 
faction—the innocence or guilt of the 
President of the United States. 
Today you have a duty to perform, 
with fidelity, not without a sense of 
surrounding dangers, but also not with-
out hope.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S774 
February 3, 2020 
I submit to you, on behalf of the 
House of Representatives, that your 
duty demands that you convict Presi-
dent Trump. Now, I don’t pretend that 
this is an easy process. It is not de-
signed to be easy. It shouldn’t be easy 
to impeach or convict a President. Im-
peachment is an extraordinary remedy, 
a tool only to be used in rare instances 
of grave misconduct, but it is in the 
Constitution for a reason. In America, 
no one is above the law, even those 
elected President of the United States. 
I would say especially those elected 
President of the United States. 
You have heard arguments from the 
President’s counsel that impeachment 
would overturn the results of the 2016 
election. You have heard that, in seek-
ing the removal and disqualification of 
the President, the House is seeking to 
interfere in the next elections. Sen-
ators, neither is true, and these argu-
ments demonstrate a deeply misguided 
or, I think, intentional effort to mis-
lead about the role that impeachment 
plays in our democracy. 
If you believe—as we do and as we 
have proven—that the President’s ef-
forts to use his official powers to cheat 
in the 2020 election jeopardized our na-
tional security and are antithetical to 
our democratic tradition, then you 
must come to no other conclusion but 
that the President threatens the fair-
ness of the next election and risks put-
ting foreign interference between the 
voters and their ballots. 
Professor Dershowitz and the other 
counselors to the President have ar-
gued that if the President thinks that 
something is in his interest, then it is, 
by definition, in the interest of the 
American 
people. 
We 
have 
said 
throughout this process that we cannot 
and should not leave our common sense 
at the door. The logical conclusion to 
this argument is that the President is 
the State; that his interests are the 
Nation’s interests; that his will is nec-
essarily ours. You and I and the Amer-
ican people know otherwise; that we do 
not have to be constitutional scholars 
to understand that this is a position 
deeply at odds with our Constitution 
and our democracy; that believing in 
this argument or allowing the Presi-
dent to get away with misconduct 
based on this extreme view would 
render him above the law. 
But we know that this cannot be 
true. What you decide on these articles 
will have lasting implications for the 
future of the Presidency, not only for 
this President but for all future Presi-
dents. Whether or not the office of the 
Presidency of the United States of 
America is above the law, that is the 
question. 
As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in his 
1855 work, ‘‘Democracy in America,’’ 
‘‘The greatness of America lies not in 
being made more enlightened than any 
other nation, but rather in her ability 
to repair her faults.’’ 
In May of 1974, Barry Goldwater and 
other Republican congressional leaders 
went to the White House to tell Presi-
dent Nixon that it was time for him to 
resign and that they could no longer 
hold back the tide of impeachment 
over Watergate. 
Now, contrary to popular belief, the 
Republican Party did not abandon 
Nixon as the Watergate scandal came 
to light. It took years of disclosures 
and crises and court battles. The party 
stood with Nixon through Watergate 
because he was a popular, conservative 
President, and his base was with him, 
so they were, too. But, ultimately, as 
Goldwater would tell Nixon, ‘‘There are 
only so many lies you can take, and 
now there has been one too many.’’ 
The President would have us believe 
that he did not withhold aid to coerce 
these sham investigations; that his 
July 25 call with the Ukrainian Presi-
dent was ‘‘perfect’’; that his meeting 
with President Zelensky on the side-
lines of the U.N. was no different than 
a head-of-state meeting in the Oval Of-
fice; that his only interest in having 
Ukraine announce investigations into 
the Bidens was an altruistic concern 
against corruption; that the Ukrain-
ians interfered in our 2016 election, not 
Russia; that Putin knows better than 
our own intelligence agencies. How 
many falsehoods can we take? When 
will it be one too many? 
Let us take a few minutes to remind 
you one last time of the facts of the 
President’s misconduct as you consider 
how you will vote on this important 
matter for our Nation. Those facts 
compel the President’s conviction on 
the two Articles of Impeachment. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, over the past 2 
weeks, the House has presented to you 
overwhelming and uncontroverted evi-
dence that President Trump has com-
mitted grave abuses of power that 
harm our national security and were 
intended to defraud our elections. 
President Trump abused the extraor-
dinary powers he alone holds as Presi-
dent of the United States to coerce an 
ally to interfere in our upcoming Presi-
dential election for the benefit of his 
own reelection. He then used those 
unique powers to wage an unprece-
dented campaign to obstruct Congress 
and cover up his wrongdoing. 
As the President’s scheme to corrupt 
our election progressed over several 
months, it became, as one witness de-
scribed, more ‘‘insidious.’’ The Presi-
dent and his agents wielded the powers 
of the Presidency and the full weight of 
the U.S. Government to increase pres-
sure on Ukraine’s new President to co-
erce him to announce two sham inves-
tigations that would smear his poten-
tial election opponent and raise his po-
litical standing. 
By early September of last year, the 
President’s 
pressure 
campaign 
ap-
peared on the verge of succeeding— 
until, that is, the President got caught, 
and the scheme was exposed. In re-
sponse, President Trump ordered a 
massive 
coverup—unprecedented 
in 
American history. He tried to conceal 
the facts from Congress, using every 
tool and legal window dressing he could 
to block evidence and muzzle wit-
nesses. He tried to prevent the public 
from learning how he placed himself 
above country. 
Yet, even as President Trump has or-
chestrated this coverup and obstructed 
Congress’s impeachment inquiry, he re-
mains unapologetic, unrestrained, and 
intent on continuing his sham to de-
fraud our elections. As I stand here 
today delivering the House’s closing ar-
gument, President Trump’s constitu-
tional crimes—his crimes against the 
American people and the Nation—re-
main in progress. 
As you make your final determina-
tion on the President’s guilt, it is 
therefore worth revisiting the totality 
of the President’s misconduct. Doing so 
lays bare the ongoing threat President 
Trump poses to our democratic system 
of government, both to our upcoming 
election that some suggest should be 
the arbiter of the President’s mis-
conduct and to the Constitution itself 
that we all swore to support and de-
fend. 
Donald Trump was the central player 
in this corrupt scheme, assisted prin-
cipally by his private attorney, Rudy 
Giuliani. 
Early in 2019, Giuliani conspired with 
two corrupt former Ukrainian prosecu-
tors to fabricate and promote phony in-
vestigations of wrongdoing by former 
Vice President Joe Biden as well as the 
Russian 
propaganda 
that 
it 
was 
Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the 
DNC in 2016. 
In the course of their presentation to 
you, the President’s counsel have made 
several remarkable admissions that af-
firm core elements of this scheme, in-
cluding specifically about Giuliani’s 
role and representation of the Presi-
dent. 
The President’s counsel have con-
ceded that Giuliani sought to convince 
Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and 
have alleged Ukraine election inter-
ference on behalf of his client, the 
President, and that the President’s 
focus on these sham investigations was 
significantly 
informed 
by 
Giuliani, 
whose views the President adopted. 
Compounding this damning admis-
sion, the President’s counsel have also 
conceded that Giuliani was not con-
ducting foreign policy on behalf of the 
President. They have confirmed that, 
in pursuing these two investigations, 
Giuliani was working solely in the 
President’s private, personal interest, 
and the President’s personal interest is 
now clear—to cheat in the next elec-
tion. 
As Giuliani would later admit, for 
the President’s scheme to succeed, he 
first needed to remove the American 
Ambassador 
to 
Ukraine, 
Marie 
Yovanovitch—an 
anti-corruption 
champion Giuliani viewed as an obsta-
cle who ‘‘was going to make the inves-
tigations difficult for everybody.’’ In 
working with now-indicted associates 
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Giuliani 
orchestrated 
a 
bogus, 
monthslong

February 3, 2020 
smear campaign against the Ambas-
sador that culminated in her removal 
in April. 
The President’s sudden order to re-
move our Ambassador came just 3 days 
after Ukraine’s Presidential elections 
in late April, which saw a reformer, 
Volodymyr Zelensky, sweep into office 
on an anti-corruption platform. Presi-
dent Trump called to congratulate 
Zelensky right after his victory. He in-
vited President Zelensky to the White 
House, and he agreed to send Vice 
President PENCE to his inauguration. 
But 3 weeks later, after Rudy Giuliani 
was denied a meeting with President 
Zelensky, President Trump abruptly 
ordered Vice President PENCE to cancel 
his trip. Instead, a lower level delega-
tion, led by three of President Trump’s 
political appointees—Secretary of En-
ergy Rick Perry, Ambassador to the 
European Union Gordon Sondland, and 
Special Representative for Ukraine Ne-
gotiations 
Kurt 
Volker—attended 
Zelensky’s inauguration the following 
week. 
These three returned from Ukraine 
and were impressed with President 
Zelensky. In a meeting shortly there-
after with President Trump in the Oval 
Office, they relayed their positive im-
pression of the new Ukrainian Presi-
dent and encouraged President Trump 
to schedule the White House meeting 
he promised in his first call, but Presi-
dent Trump reacted negatively. He 
railed that Ukraine ‘‘tried to take me 
down’’ in 2016, and in order to schedule 
a White House visit for President 
Zelensky, President Trump told the 
delegation that it would have to ‘‘talk 
to Rudy.’’ 
It is worth pausing here to consider 
the importance of this meeting in late 
May. This is the moment when Presi-
dent Trump successfully hijacked the 
tools of our government to serve his 
corrupt personal interests—when the 
President’s 
‘‘domestic 
political 
er-
rand,’’ as one witness famously de-
scribed it, began to overtake and sub-
ordinate U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security interests. 
By this point in the scheme, Rudy 
Giuliani was advocating very publicly 
for Ukraine to pursue the two sham in-
vestigations, but his request to meet 
with President Zelensky was rebuffed 
by the new Ukrainian President. Ac-
cording to reports about Ambassador 
Bolton’s account—soon to be available 
if not to this body then to bookstores 
near you—the President also unsuc-
cessfully tried to get Bolton to call the 
new Ukrainian President to ensure he 
would meet with Giuliani. 
The desire for Ukraine to announce 
these phony investigations was for a 
clear 
and 
corrupt 
reason—because 
President Trump wanted the political 
benefit of a foreign country’s announc-
ing that it would investigate his rival. 
That is how we know without a doubt 
that the object of the President’s 
scheme was to benefit his reelection 
campaign—in other words, to cheat in 
the next election. 
Ukraine resisted announcing the in-
vestigations throughout June, so the 
President and his agent, Rudy Giuliani, 
turned up the pressure—this time, by 
wielding the power of the U.S. Govern-
ment. 
In mid-June, the Department of De-
fense publicly announced that it would 
be releasing $250 million of military as-
sistance to Ukraine. Almost imme-
diately after seeing this, the President 
quietly ordered a freeze on the assist-
ance to Ukraine. None of the 17 wit-
nesses in our investigation were pro-
vided with a credible reason for the 
hold when it was implemented, and all 
relevant agencies opposed the freeze. 
In July, Giuliani and the President’s 
appointees made it clear to Ukraine 
that a meeting at the White House 
would only be scheduled if Ukraine an-
nounced the sham investigations. Ac-
cording to a July 19 email the White 
House has tried to suppress, this ‘‘drug 
deal,’’ as Ambassador Bolton called it, 
was well known among the President’s 
most senior officials, including his 
Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and 
it 
was 
relayed 
directly 
to 
senior 
Ukrainian 
officials 
by 
Gordon 
Sondland on July 10 at the White 
House. ‘‘Everyone was in the loop.’’ 
Although 
President 
Zelensky 
ex-
plained that he did not want to be a 
‘‘pawn’’ in Washington politics, Presi-
dent Trump did not care. In fact, on 
July 25, before President Trump spoke 
to 
President 
Zelensky, 
President 
Trump personally conveyed the terms 
of 
this 
quid 
pro 
quo 
to 
Gordon 
Sondland, who then relayed the mes-
sage to Ukraine’s President. 
Later that morning, during the now- 
infamous phone call, President Trump 
explicitly requested that Ukraine in-
vestigate the Bidens and the 2016 elec-
tion. Zelensky responded as President 
Trump instructed: He assured Presi-
dent Trump that he would undertake 
these investigations. After hearing this 
commitment, President Trump then re-
iterated his invitation to the White 
House at the end of the call. 
No later than a few days after the 
call, the highest levels of the Ukrain-
ian Government learned about the hold 
on military assistance. Senior Ukrain-
ian officials decided to keep quiet, rec-
ognizing the harm it would cause to 
Ukraine’s defense, to the new govern-
ment’s standing at home, and to its ne-
gotiating posture with Russia. Officials 
in Ukraine and the United States 
hoped the hold would be reversed be-
fore it became public. As we now know, 
that was not to be. 
As we have explained during the 
trial, the President’s scheme did not 
begin with the July 25 call, and it did 
not end there either. As instructed, a 
top aide to President Zelensky met 
with Giuliani in early August, and they 
began working on a press statement for 
Zelensky to issue that would announce 
the two sham investigations and lead 
to a White House meeting. 
Let’s be very clear here. The docu-
mentary evidence alone—the text mes-
sages and the emails that we have 
shown you—confirms definitively the 
President’s corrupt quid pro quo for 
the White House meeting. Subsequent 
testimony further affirms that the 
President withheld this official act— 
this highly coveted Oval Office meet-
ing—to apply pressure on Ukraine to 
do his personal bidding. 
The evidence is unequivocal. 
Despite this pressure, by mid-August 
President Zelensky resisted such an ex-
plicit announcement of the two politi-
cally motivated investigations desired 
by President Trump. As a result, the 
White House meeting remained un-
scheduled, just as it remains unsched-
uled to this day. 
During this same timeframe in Au-
gust, the President persisted in main-
taining the hold on the aid, despite 
warnings that he was breaking the law 
by doing so, as an independent watch-
dog recently confirmed that he did. 
According to the evidence presented 
to you, the President’s entire Cabinet 
believed he should release the aid be-
cause it was in the national security 
interest of our country. During the en-
tire month of August, there was no in-
ternal review of the aid. Congress was 
not notified, nor was there any credible 
reason provided within the executive 
branch. 
With no explanation offered and with 
the explicit, clear, yet unsuccessful 
quid pro quo for the White House meet-
ing in the front of his mind, Ambas-
sador Sondland testified that the only 
logical conclusion was that the Presi-
dent was also withholding military as-
sistance to increase the pressure on 
Ukraine to announce the investiga-
tions. As Sondland and another witness 
testified, this conclusion was as simple 
as two plus two equals four. If the 
White House meeting wasn’t sufficient 
leverage to extract the announcement 
he wanted, Trump would use the frozen 
aid as his hammer. 
Secretary 
Pompeo 
confirmed 
Sondland’s conclusion in an August 22 
email. It is also clear that Vice Presi-
dent PENCE was aware of the quid pro 
quo over the aid and was directly in-
formed of such in Warsaw on Sep-
tember 1, after the freeze had become 
public and Ukraine became desperate. 
Sondland pulled aside a top aide in 
Warsaw and told him that everything— 
both the White House meeting and also 
the security assistance—were condi-
tioned on the announcement of the in-
vestigations that Sondland, Giuliani, 
and others had been negotiating with 
the same aide earlier in August. 
This is an important point. The 
President claims that Ukraine did not 
know of the freeze in aid, though we 
know this to be false. As the former 
Deputy Foreign Minister has admitted 
publicly, they found out about it with-
in days of the July 25 call and kept it 
quite. But no one can dispute that even 
after the hold became public on August 
28, President Trump’s representatives 
continued 
their 
efforts 
to 
secure

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S776 
February 3, 2020 
Ukraine’s announcement of the inves-
tigations. This is enough to prove ex-
tortion in court, and it is certainly 
enough to prove it here. 
If that wasn’t enough, however, on 
September 7, more than a week after 
the aid freeze became public, President 
Trump confirmed directly to Sondland 
that he wanted President Zelensky in a 
‘‘public box’’ and that his release of the 
aid was conditioned on the announce-
ment of the two sham investigations. 
Having received direct confirmation 
from President Trump, Sondland re-
layed the President’s message to Presi-
dent Zelensky himself. 
President Zelensky could resist no 
longer. America’s military assistance 
makes up 10 percent of his country’s 
defense budget, and President Trump’s 
visible lack of support for Ukraine 
harmed his leverage in negotiations 
with Russia. President Zelensky af-
firmed to Sondland on that same tele-
phone call that he would announce the 
investigations in an interview on CNN. 
President Trump’s pressure campaign 
appeared to have succeeded. 
Two days after President Zelensky 
confirmed his intention to meet Presi-
dent Trump’s demands, the House of 
Representatives announced its inves-
tigation into these very issues. Shortly 
thereafter, the inspector general of the 
intelligence community notified the 
communities that the whistleblower 
complaint was being improperly han-
dled—or was improperly withheld from 
Congress 
with 
the 
White 
House’s 
knowledge. 
In other words, the President got 
caught, and 2 days later, on September 
11, the President released the aid. To 
this day, however, Ukraine still has 
not received all of the money Congress 
has appropriated and the White House 
meeting has yet to be scheduled. 
The identity of the whistleblower, 
moreover, is irrelevant. The House did 
not rely on the whistleblower’s com-
plaint, even as it turned out to be re-
markably accurate. It does not matter 
who initially sounded the alarm when 
they saw smoke. What matters is that 
the firefighters—Congress—were sum-
moned and found the blaze, and we 
know that we did. 
The facts about the President’s mis-
conduct are not seriously in dispute. 
As several Republican Senators have 
acknowledged publicly, we have proof 
that the President abused his power in 
precisely the manner charged in article 
I. President Trump withheld the White 
House meeting and essential, congres-
sionally appropriated military assist-
ance from Ukraine in order to pressure 
Ukraine to interfere in the upcoming 
Presidential election on his behalf. 
The sham investigations President 
Trump wanted announced had no le-
gitimate purpose and were not in the 
national interest, despite the Presi-
dent’s counsel’s troubling reliance on 
conspiracy theories to claim the Presi-
dent acted in the public interest. 
The President was not focused on 
fighting corruption. In fact, he was try-
ing to pressure Ukraine’s President to 
act corruptly by announcing these 
baseless investigations. And the evi-
dence makes clear that the President’s 
decision to withhold Ukraine’s mili-
tary aid is not connected in any way to 
purported concerns about corruption or 
burden-sharing. 
Rather, the evidence that was pre-
sented to you is damning, chilling, dis-
turbing, 
and 
disgraceful. 
President 
Trump weaponized our government and 
the vast powers entrusted to him by 
the American people and the Constitu-
tion to target his political rival and 
corrupt our precious elections, sub-
verting our national security and our 
democracy in the process. He put his 
personal interests over those of the 
country, and he violated his oath of of-
fice in the process. 
But the President’s grave abuse of 
power did not end there. In conduct un-
paralleled in American history, once he 
got caught, President Trump engaged 
in categorical and indiscriminate ob-
struction of any investigation into his 
wrongdoing. He ordered every govern-
ment agency and every official to defy 
the House’s impeachment inquiry, and 
he did so for a simple reason: to con-
ceal evidence of his wrongdoing from 
Congress and the American people. 
The President’s obstruction was un-
lawful and unprecedented, but it also 
confirmed his guilt. Innocent people 
don’t try to hide every document and 
witness, especially those that would 
clear them. That is what guilty people 
do. That is what guilty people do. Inno-
cent people do everything they can to 
clear their name and provide evidence 
that shows that they are innocent. 
But it would be a mistake to view the 
President’s obstruction narrowly, as 
the President’s counsel have tried to 
portray it. The President did not defy 
the House’s impeachment inquiry as 
part of a routine interbranch dispute or 
because he wanted to protect the con-
stitutional rights and privileges of his 
Presidency. He did it consistent with 
his vow to ‘‘fight all subpoenas.’’ 
The second article of impeachment 
goes to the heart of our Constitution 
and our democratic system of govern-
ment. The Framers of the Constitution 
purposefully entrusted the power of im-
peachment in the legislative branch so 
that it may protect the American peo-
ple from a corrupt President. 
The President was able to undertake 
such comprehensive obstruction only 
because of the exceptional powers en-
trusted to him by the American people, 
and he wielded that power to make 
sure Congress would not receive a sin-
gle record or a single document related 
to his conduct and to bar his closest 
aides from testifying about his scheme. 
Throughout the House’s inquiry, just 
as they did during the trial, the Presi-
dent’s counsel offered bad-faith and 
meritless legal arguments as trans-
parent window dressing intended to le-
gitimize and justify the President’s ef-
forts to hide evidence of his mis-
conduct. 
We have explained why all of these 
legal excuses hold no merit, why the 
House’s subpoenas were valid, how the 
House appropriately exercised its im-
peachment authority, how the Presi-
dent’s strategy was to stall and ob-
struct. We have explained how the 
President’s after-the-fact reliance on 
unfounded and, in some cases, brand- 
new legal privileges are shockingly 
transparent cover for a President’s dic-
tate of blanket obstruction. We have 
underscored how the President’s defi-
ance of Congress is unprecedented in 
the history of our Republic, and we all 
know that an innocent person would 
eagerly provide testimony and docu-
ments to clear his name, as the Presi-
dent apparently thought he was doing, 
mistakenly, when he released the call 
records of his two telephone calls with 
President Zelensky. 
And 
even 
as 
the 
President 
has 
claimed to be protecting the Presi-
dency, remember that the President 
never actually invoked executive privi-
lege throughout this entire inquiry, a 
revealing fact, given the law’s prohibi-
tion on invoking executive privilege to 
shield wrongdoing. 
And yet, according to the President’s 
counsel, the President is justified in re-
sisting the House’s impeachment in-
quiry. They assert that the House 
should have taken the President to 
court to defy the obstruction. The 
President’s argument is as shameless 
as it is hypocritical. The President’s 
counsel is arguing in this trial that the 
House should have gone to court to en-
force its subpoenas, while at the same 
time, the President’s own Department 
of Justice is arguing in court that the 
House cannot enforce the subpoenas 
through the courts. And you know 
what remedy they say in court is avail-
able to the House? Impeachment for 
obstruction of Congress. 
This is not the first time this argu-
ment has been made. President Nixon 
made it too, but it was roundly re-
jected by the House Judiciary Com-
mittee 45 years ago, when the com-
mittee passed an article for obstruc-
tion of Congress for a far less serious 
objection than we have here. The com-
mittee concluded that it was inappro-
priate to enforce its subpoenas in court 
and, as the slide shows: 
The Committee concluded that it would be 
inappropriate to seek the aid of the courts to 
enforce its subpoenas against the President. 
This conclusion is based on the constitu-
tional provision vesting the power of im-
peachment solely in the House of Represent-
atives and the express denial by the Framers 
of the Constitution of any role for the courts 
in the impeachment process. 
Again, the committee report on Nix-
on’s Articles of Impeachment. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Once we 
strip the President’s obstruction of 
this legal window dressing, the con-
sequences are as clear as they are dire 
for our democracy. To condone the 
President’s obstruction would strike a 
deathblow to the impeachment clause 
in the Constitution. And if the Con-
gress cannot enforce this sole power

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S777 
February 3, 2020 
vested in both Chambers alone, the 
Constitution’s final line of defense 
against a corrupt Presidency will be 
eviscerated. 
A President who can obstruct and 
thwart the impeachment power be-
comes unaccountable. He or she is ef-
fectively above the law. And such a 
President is more likely to engage in 
corruption with impunity. This will be-
come the new normal with this Presi-
dent and for future generations. 
So where does this leave us? As many 
of you in this Chamber have publicly 
acknowledged in the past few days, the 
facts are not seriously in dispute. We 
have proved that the President com-
mitted grave offenses against the Con-
stitution. The question that remains is 
whether that conduct warrants convic-
tion and removal from office. 
Should the Senate simply accept or 
even condone such corrupt conduct by 
a President? Absent conviction and re-
moval, how can we be assured that this 
President will not do it again? If we are 
to rely on the next election to judge 
the President’s efforts to cheat in that 
election, how can we know that the 
election will be free and fair? How can 
we know that every vote will be free 
from foreign interference solicited by 
the President himself? 
With President Trump, the past is 
prologue. This is neither the first time 
that the President solicited foreign in-
terference in his own election, nor is it 
the first time that the President tried 
to obstruct an investigation into his 
misconduct. But you will determine— 
you will determine—you will deter-
mine whether it will be his last. 
As we speak, the President continues 
his 
wrongdoing 
unchecked 
and 
unashamed. 
Donald 
Trump 
hasn’t 
stopped trying to pressure Ukraine to 
smear his opponent, nor has he stopped 
obstructing 
Congress. 
His 
political 
agent, Rudolph Giuliani, recently re-
turned to the scene of the crime in 
Ukraine to manufacture more dirt for 
his client, the President of the United 
States. 
President Trump remains a clear and 
present danger to our national security 
and to our credibility around the 
world. He is decimating our global 
standing as a beacon of democracy 
while corrupting our free and fair elec-
tions here at home. 
What is a greater protection to our 
country than ensuring that we, the 
American people, alone, not some for-
eign power, choose our Commander in 
Chief? The American people alone 
should decide who represents us in any 
office without foreign interference— 
particularly the highest office in the 
land. And what could undermine our 
national security more than to with-
hold from a foreign ally fighting a hot 
war against our adversary hundreds of 
millions of dollars of military aid to 
buy sniper rifles, rocket-propelled gre-
nade launchers, radar and night vision 
goggles, so that they may fight the war 
over there, keeping us safe here? 
If we allow the President’s mis-
conduct to stand, what message do we 
send? What message do we send to Rus-
sia, our adversary intent on fracturing 
democracy around the world? 
What will we say to our European al-
lies, already concerned with this Presi-
dent, about whether the United States 
will continue to support our NATO 
commitments that have been a pillar 
of our foreign policy since World War 
II? What message do we send to our al-
lies in the free world? 
If we allow this President’s conduct 
to stand, what will we say to the 68,000 
men and women in uniform in Europe 
right now who courageously and admi-
rably wake up every day ready and 
willing to fight for America’s security 
and prosperity, for democracy in Eu-
rope and around the world? What mes-
sage do we send them when we say 
America’s national security is for sale? 
That cannot be the message we want 
to send to our Ukrainian friends or our 
European allies or to our children and 
our grandchildren who will inherit this 
precious Republic, and I am sure it is 
not the message that you wish to send 
to our adversaries. 
The late Senator John McCain was 
an astounding man—a man of great 
principle, a great patriot. He fought ad-
mirably in Vietnam and was impris-
oned as a POW for over 5 years, refus-
ing an offer by the North Vietnamese 
to be released early because his father 
was a prominent admiral. As you all 
are aware, Senator McCain was a great 
supporter of Ukraine, a great supporter 
of Europe, a great supporter of our 
troops. Senator McCain understood the 
importance of this body—this distin-
guished body—and serving the public, 
once saying: ‘‘Glory belongs to the act 
of being constant to something greater 
than yourself, to a cause, to your prin-
ciples, to the people on whom you rely 
and who rely on you.’’ 
The Ukrainians and the Europeans 
and the Americans around the world 
and here at home are watching what 
we do. They are watching to see what 
the Senate will do, and they are rely-
ing on this distinguished body to be 
constant to the principles America was 
founded on and which we tried to up-
hold for more than 240 years. 
Doing the right thing and being con-
stant to our principles requires a level 
of moral courage that is difficult but 
by no means impossible. It is that 
moral courage shown by public serv-
ants 
throughout 
this 
country 
and 
throughout the impeachment inquiry 
in the House. 
People 
like 
Ambassador 
Marie 
Yovanovitch—her 
decades 
of 
non-
partisan service were turned against 
her in a vicious smear campaign that 
reached all the way to the President. 
Despite this effort, she decided to 
honor a duly authorized congressional 
subpoena and to speak the truth to the 
American people. For this, she was the 
subject of yet more smears against her 
career and her character even as she 
testified in a public hearing before 
Congress. Her courage mattered. 
People like Ambassador Bill Taylor, 
a West Point graduate who wears a 
Bronze Star and an Air Medal for valor 
and, his proudest honor, the Combat 
Infantryman Badge. When his country 
called on him, he answered again and 
again and again, in battle and foreign 
affairs and in the face of a corrupt ef-
fort by the President to extort a for-
eign country into helping his reelec-
tion campaign—an effort that Ambas-
sador 
Taylor 
rightly 
believed 
was 
‘‘crazy.’’ His courage mattered. 
People like LTC Alexander Vindman, 
who came to this country as a young 
child fleeing authoritarianism in East-
ern Europe—he could have done any-
thing with his life, but he, too, chose 
public service, putting on a uniform 
and receiving a Purple Heart after 
being wounded in battle fighting coura-
geously in Iraq. When he heard that 
fateful July 25 call, in which the Presi-
dent sold out our country for his own 
personal 
gain, 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman reported it and later came be-
fore Congress to speak the truth about 
what happened. Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman’s courage mattered. 
To the other public servants who 
came forward and told the truth in the 
face of vicious smears, intimidation, 
and White House efforts to silence you, 
your courage mattered. You did the 
right thing. You did your duty. No 
matter what happens today or from 
this 
day 
forward, 
that 
courage 
mattered. 
Whatever the outcome in this trial, 
we will remain vigilant in the House. I 
know there are dedicated public serv-
ants who know the difference between 
right and wrong. But make no mistake, 
these are perilous times if we deter-
mine that the remedy for a President 
who cheats in an election is to pro-
nounce him vindicated and attack 
those who expose his misconduct. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, be-
fore we break, I want to take a mo-
ment to say something about the staff 
who have worked tirelessly on the im-
peachment inquiry and this trial for 
months now. There is a small army of 
public servants down the hall from this 
Chamber, in offices throughout the 
House, and, yes, in that windowless 
bunker in the Capitol, who have com-
mitted their lives to this effort because 
they, like the managers and the Amer-
ican people, believe that a President 
free of accountability is a danger to 
the beating heart of our democracy. 
I am grateful to all of them, but let 
me mention a few: Daniel Goldman, 
Maher Bitar, Rheanne Wirkkala, Pat-
rick Boland, William Evans, Patrick 
Fallon, Sean Misko, Nicolas Mitchell, 
Daniel Noble, Diana Pilipenko, Emilie 
Simons, Susanne Grooms, Krista Boyd, 
Norm 
Eisen, 
Barry 
Berke, 
Joshua 
Matz, Doug Letter, Sarah Istel, Ashley 
Etienne, 
Terri 
McCullough, 
Dick 
Meltzer, and Wyndee Parker. Some of 
those staff, including some singled out 
in this Chamber, have been made to en-
dure the most vicious false attacks to 
the point where they feel their lives 
have been put at risk. 
The attacks on them degrade our in-
stitution and all who serve in it. You

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S778 
February 3, 2020 
have asked me why I hired certain of 
my staff, and I will tell you—because 
they are brilliant, hard-working, patri-
otic, and the best people for the job, 
and they deserve better than the at-
tacks they have been forced to suffer. 
Members of the Senate, Mr. Chief 
Justice, I want to close this portion of 
our statement by reading you the 
words of our dear friend and former 
colleague in the House, the late Elijah 
Cummings, who said this on the day 
the Speaker announced the beginning 
of the impeachment inquiry: 
As elected Representatives, [he said], of 
the American people, we speak not only for 
those who are here with us now, but for gen-
erations yet unborn. Our voices today are 
messages to a future we may never see. When 
the history books are written about this tu-
multuous era, I want them to show that I 
was among those in the House of Representa-
tives who stood up to lawlessness and tyr-
anny. 
We, the managers, are not here rep-
resenting ourselves alone or even just 
the House, just as you are not here 
making a determination as to the 
President’s guilt or innocence for your-
selves alone. No, you and we represent 
the American people, the ones at home 
and at work who are hoping that their 
country will remain what they have al-
ways believed it to be: a beacon of 
hope, of democracy, and of inspiration 
to those striving around the world to 
create their own more perfect unions— 
for those who were standing up to law-
lessness and to tyranny. 
Donald Trump has betrayed his oath 
to protect and defend the Constitution, 
but it is not too late for us to honor 
ours and to wield our power to defend 
our democracy. As President Abraham 
Lincoln said at the close of his Cooper 
Union Address on February 27, 1860, 
‘‘[n]either let us be slandered from our 
duty by false accusations against us, 
nor frightened from it by menaces of 
destruction to the Government nor of 
dungeons to ourselves. Let us have 
faith that right makes might, and in 
that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do 
our duty as we understand it.’’ 
Today, we urge you—in the face of 
overwhelming evidence of the Presi-
dent’s guilt and knowing that, if left in 
office, he will continue to seek foreign 
interference in the next election—to 
vote to convict on both Articles of Im-
peachment and to remove from office, 
Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of 
the United States. 
Mr. Chief Justice, we reserve the bal-
ance of our time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
colleagues, we will take a 30-minute 
break for lunch. 
There being no objection, at 12:02 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 12:51 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will come to order. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Lead-
er 
MCCONNELL, 
Democratic 
Leader 
SCHUMER, Senators. Thank you very 
much, on behalf of all of us, for your 
continued attention. Today we are 
going to complete our argument and 
finish our closing argument. We will 
complete that in a very efficient period 
of time. 
You understand the arguments that 
we have been making, and at the end of 
the day, the key conclusion—we be-
lieve, the only conclusion—based on 
the evidence and based on the Articles 
of Impeachment themselves and the 
Constitution is that you must vote to 
acquit the President. At the end of the 
day, this is an effort to overturn the 
results of one election and to try to 
interfere in the coming election that 
begins today in Iowa. And we believe 
that the only proper result, if we are 
applying the golden rule of impeach-
ment, if we are applying the rules of 
impeachment that were so eloquently 
stated by Members of the Democratic 
Party the last time we were here—the 
only appropriate result here is to ac-
quit the President and to leave it to 
the voters to choose their President. 
With that, I will turn it over to 
Judge Ken Starr, and we will move 
through a series of short presentations. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Counsel STARR. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL, Democratic Leader 
SCHUMER, House impeachment man-
agers and their very able staff, as 
World War I, the war to end all wars, 
was drawing to a close, an American 
soldier sat down at a piano and com-
posed a song. It was designed to be part 
of a musical review for his Army camp 
out on Long Island, Suffolk County. 
The song was ‘‘God Bless America.’’ 
The composer, of course, was Irving 
Berlin, who came here at the age of 5, 
the son of immigrants who came to 
this country for freedom. 
As composers are wont to do, Berlin 
worked very carefully with the lyrics. 
The song needed to be pure. It needed 
to be above politics, above partisan-
ship. He intended it to be a song for all 
America, but he intended it to be more 
than just a song. It was to be a prayer 
for the country. 
As your very distinguished Chaplain, 
RADM Barry Black, has done in his 
prayers on these long days that you 
have spent as judges in the High Court 
of Impeachment, we have been re-
minded of what our country is all 
about and that it stands for one nation 
under God. Nation is about freedom. 
And we hear the voice of Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., and his dream-filled 
speech about freedom echoing the great 
passages inscribed on America’s temple 
of justice, the Lincoln Memorial, which 
stood behind Dr. King as he spoke on 
that historic day. Dr. King is gone, 
felled by an assassin’s bullet, but his 
words remain with us. And during his 
magnificent life, Dr. King spoke not 
only about freedom, freedom standing 
alone; he spoke frequently about free-
dom and justice. And in his speeches he 
summoned up regularly the words of a 
Unitarian abolitionist from the prior 
century, Theodore Parker, who re-
ferred to the moral arc of the uni-
verse—the long moral arc of the uni-
verse points toward justice—freedom 
and justice—freedom, whose contours 
have been shaped over the centuries in 
the English-speaking world by what 
Justice Benjamin Cardozo called the 
authentic forms of justice through 
which the community expresses itself 
in law. Authentic. Authenticity. 
And at the foundation of those au-
thentic forms of justice is fundamental 
fairness. It is playing by the rules. It is 
why we don’t allow deflated footballs 
or stealing signs from the field. Rules 
are rules. They are to be followed. 
And so I submit that a key question 
to be asked as you begin your delibera-
tions: Were the rules here faithfully 
followed? If not, if that is your judg-
ment, then, with all due respect, the 
prosecutors should not be rewarded, 
just as Federal prosecutors are not re-
warded. You didn’t follow the rules. 
You should have. 
As a young lawyer, I was blessed to 
work with one of the great trial law-
yers of his time, and I asked him: Dick, 
what’s your secret? 
He had just defended, successfully, a 
former United States Senator who was 
charged with a serious offense—perjury 
before a Federal grand jury. His re-
sponse was simple and forthright. His 
words could have come from prairie 
lawyer Abe Lincoln: I let the judge and 
the jury know that they can believe 
and trust every word that comes out of 
my mouth. I will not be proven wrong. 
So here is a question, as you begin 
your deliberations: Have the facts as 
presented to you as a court, as the 
High Court of Impeachment, proven 
trustworthy? Has there been full and 
fair disclosure in the course of these 
proceedings? Fundamental fairness? 
I recall these words from the podium 
last week. A point would be made by 
one of the President’s lawyers, and 
then this would follow: The House 
managers didn’t tell you that. Why 
not? And again: The House managers 
didn’t tell you that. Why not? 
At the Justice Department, on the 
fifth floor of the Robert F. Kennedy 
Building, is this simple inscription: 
‘‘The United States wins its point 
whenever justice is done its citizens in 
the courts.’’ Not did we win, not did we 
convict; rather, the moral question: 
Was justice done? 
Of course, as has been said fre-
quently, the House of Representatives 
does, under our Constitution, enjoy the 
sole power of impeachment. No one has 
disputed that fact. They have got the 
power, but that doesn’t mean that any-
thing goes. It doesn’t mean that the 
House cannot be called to account in 
the High Court of Impeachment for its 
actions in exercising that power. 
A question to be asked: Are we to 
countenance violations of the rules and

traditional procedures that have been 
followed scrupulously in prior im-
peachment proceedings? And the Judi-
ciary Committee, the venerable Judici-
ary Committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives—compare 
and 
contrast 
the thoroughness of that committee in 
the age of Nixon, its thoroughness in 
the age of Clinton with all of its divi-
siveness within the committee in this 
proceeding. 
A question to be asked: Did the 
House Judiciary Committee rush to 
judgment in fashioning the Articles of 
Impeachment? Did it carefully gather 
the facts, assess the facts before it con-
cluded? We need nothing more than the 
panel of very distinguished professors 
and the splendid presentations by both 
the majority counsel and the minority 
counsel. 
We asked some questions. The Repub-
licans asked some questions. We heard 
their answers. We are ready to vote. We 
are ready to try this case in the High 
Court of Impeachment. 
What was being said in the sounds of 
silence was this: We don’t have time to 
follow the rules. We won’t even allow 
the House Judiciary minority mem-
bers, who have been beseeching us time 
and again, to have their day—just one 
day—to call their witnesses. Oh yes, 
that is expressly provided for in the 
rules, but we will break those rules. 
That is not liberty and justice for all. 
The great political scientist of yes-
teryear, Richard Neustadt of Columbia, 
observed that the power of the Presi-
dent is ultimately the power to per-
suade—oh 
yes, 
the 
Commander 
in 
Chief, and, yes, charged with the con-
duct and authority to guide the Na-
tion’s foreign relations, but ultimately 
it is the power to persuade. 
I suggest to you that so, too, the 
House’s sole power to impeach is like-
wise ultimately a power to persuade 
over in the House. 
A question to be asked: In the fast- 
track impeachment process in the 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
did 
the 
House majority persuade the American 
people—not just partisans; rather, did 
the House’s case win over the over-
whelming majority of consensus of the 
American people? 
The question fairly to be asked: Will 
I cast my vote to convict and remove 
the President of the United States 
when not a single member of the Presi-
dent’s party—the party of Lincoln— 
was persuaded at any time in the proc-
ess? 
In contrast, and when I was here last 
week, I noted for the record of these 
proceedings that in the Nixon impeach-
ment, the House vote to authorize the 
impeachment inquiry was 410 to 4. In 
the 
Clinton 
impeachment—divisive, 
controversial—31 Democrats voted in 
favor of the impeachment inquiry. 
Here, of course, and in sharp contrast, 
the answer is, none. 
It is said that we live in highly and 
perhaps hopelessly partisan times. It is 
said that no one is open to persuasion 
anymore. They are getting their news 
entirely from their favorite media plat-
form, and that platform of choice is fa-
tally deterministic. 
Well, at least the decision of decision 
makers under oath, who are bound by 
sacred duty, by oath, or affirmation to 
do impartial justice, leaves the plat-
forms out. Those modern-day inter-
mediaries and shapers of thought, of 
expression, of opinion, are outside 
these walls where you serve. 
Finally, does what is before this 
court—very energetically described by 
the able House managers but fairly 
viewed—rise to the level of a high 
crime or misdemeanor, one so grave 
and so serious to bring about the pro-
found disruption of the article II 
branch, the disruption of the govern-
ment, and to tell the American peo-
ple—and, yes, I will say this is the way 
it would be read—‘‘Your vote in the 
last election is hereby declared null 
and void. And by the way, we are not 
going to allow you, the American peo-
ple, to sit in judgment on this Presi-
dent and his record in November’’? 
That is neither freedom, nor is it jus-
tice. It is certainly not consistent with 
the most basic freedom of ‘‘we the peo-
ple,’’ the freedom to vote. 
I thank the court. 
I yield to my colleague, Mr. Purpura. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, good 
afternoon. I will be relatively brief 
today and will not repeat the argu-
ments that we have made throughout, 
but I want to highlight a few things. 
There are a number of reasons why 
the Articles of Impeachment are defi-
cient and must fail. My colleagues have 
spent the past week describing those 
reasons. In my time today, I would like 
to review just a few core facts, which, 
again, remember, are all drawn from 
the record on which the President was 
impeached in the House and that the 
House managers brought to this body 
in support of the President’s removal. 
First, the President did not condition 
security assistance or a meeting on 
anything during the July 25 call. In 
fact, both Ambassador Yovanovitch 
and Mr. Tim Morrison confirmed that 
the Javelin missiles and the security 
assistance were completely unrelated. 
The concerns that Lieutenant Colo-
nel Vindman expressed on the call 
were, by his own words and admission, 
based on deep policy concerns. 
And remember, as we said before and 
everyone in this room knows, the 
President sets the foreign policy; the 
unelected staff implements the foreign 
policy. 
Others on the call, including Lieuten-
ant Colonel Vindman’s boss, Mr. Morri-
son, as well as LTG Keith Kellogg, had 
no such concerns and have stated that 
they heard nothing improper, unlawful, 
or otherwise troubling on the July 25 
call. 
Second, President Zelensky and his 
top advisers agreed that there was 
nothing wrong with the July 25 call 
and that they felt no pressure from 
President Trump. President Zelensky 
said that the call was ‘‘good,’’ ‘‘nor-
mal,’’ and ‘‘no [one] pushed me.’’ 
President 
Zelensky’s 
top 
adviser, 
Andriy Yermak, was asked if he had 
ever felt there was a connection be-
tween the U.S. military aid and the re-
quest for investigations. He was ada-
mant that ‘‘we never had that feeling. 
. . . We did not have the feeling that 
this aid was connected to any one spe-
cific issue.’’ Several other top Ukrain-
ian officials have said the same both 
publicly and in readouts of the July 25 
call to Ambassador Taylor, Ambas-
sador Volker, and others. 
Third, President Zelensky and the 
highest levels of the Ukrainian Govern-
ment did not learn of the pause until 
August 28, 2019—more than a month 
after the July 25 call between Presi-
dent Trump and President Zelensky. 
President Zelensky himself said: 
I had no idea the military aid was held up. 
When I did find out, I raised it with Pence at 
a meeting in Warsaw. 
Referring to the Vice President. 
The meeting in Warsaw took place 3 
days after the POLITICO article was 
published, on September 1, 2019. 
Mr. Yermak likewise said that Presi-
dent Zelensky and his key advisers 
learned of the pause only from the Au-
gust 28 POLITICO article. 
Just last week, while we were in this 
trial, 
Oleksandr 
Danylyuk, 
former 
chairman of Ukraine’s National Secu-
rity and Defense Council, said he first 
found out that the United States was 
withholding aid to Ukraine by reading 
POLITICO’s article published August 
28. Mr. Danylyuk also said there was 
panic within the Zelensky administra-
tion when they found out about the 
hold from the POLITICO article, indi-
cating that the highest levels of the ad-
ministration 
were 
unaware 
of 
the 
pause until the article was published. 
If that is not enough, Ambassador 
Volker, Ambassador Taylor, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State George 
Kent, and Mr. Morrison also testified 
that the Ukrainians did not know 
about the security hold until the PO-
LITICO article on August 28. We 
showed you the text message from Mr. 
Yermak to Ambassador Volker just 
hours after the POLITICO article was 
published. You also remember all of 
the high-level, bilateral meetings at 
which the Ukrainians did not bring up 
the pause in the security assistance be-
cause they did not know about it. 
When they did find out on August 28, 
they raised the issue at the very next 
meeting in Warsaw on September 1. 
This is a really important point. As 
Ambassador Volker testified, if the 
Ukrainians didn’t know about the 
pause, then there was no leverage im-
plied. That is why the House managers 
have kept claiming and continued to 
claim throughout the trial that the 
high-level Ukrainians somehow knew 
about the pause before late August. 
That is inaccurate. 
We pointed out that Laura Cooper, 
on whom they rely, testified she didn’t 
really know what the emails she saw

relating to security assistance were 
about. 
We told you that Catherine Croft, 
who worked for Ambassador Volker, 
couldn’t remember the specifics of 
when she believed the Ukrainian Em-
bassy learned of the pause and that she 
didn’t remember when news of the 
pause became public. 
The House managers also mentioned 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman, 
who 
claimed to have vague recollections of 
fielding unspecified queries about aid 
from Ukrainians in the mid-August 
timeframe. But Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman ultimately agreed that the 
Ukrainians first learned about the hold 
on security assistance probably around 
when the first stories emerged in the 
open source. 
Former 
Deputy 
Foreign 
Minister 
Olena Zerkal’s claim that she knew 
about the pause in July is inconsistent 
with statements by her boss, the then- 
Foreign Minister of Ukraine, who said 
that he learned of the pause from a 
news article, of which the August 28 
POLITICO article was the first, as well 
as those of all of the other top-level 
Ukrainian officials I have mentioned, 
the testimony of the top U.S. dip-
lomats responsible for Ukraine, and the 
many intervening meetings at which 
the pause was not mentioned. 
Fourth, none of the House witnesses 
testified that President Trump ever 
said there was any linkage between se-
curity assistance and investigations. 
When Ambassador Sondland asked the 
President on approximately September 
9, the President told him: 
I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no 
quid pro quo. 
Before he asked the President, Am-
bassador Sondland presumed and told 
Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison 
that there was a connection between 
the security assistance and the inves-
tigations. That was before he asked the 
President directly. 
Even earlier, on August 31, Senator 
RON JOHNSON asked the President if 
there was any connection between se-
curity assistance and investigations. 
The President answered: 
No way. I would never do that. Who told 
you that? 
Under Secretary of State David Hale, 
Mr. Kent, and Ambassador Volker all 
testified that they were not aware of 
any connection whatsoever between se-
curity assistance and investigations. 
The House managers repeatedly point 
to a statement by Acting Chief of Staff 
Mick Mulvaney during an October 
press conference. When it became clear 
that the media was misinterpreting his 
comments or that he had simply 
misspoken, Mr. Mulvaney promptly, on 
the very day of the press conference, 
issued a written statement making 
clear that there was no quid pro quo. 
Here is his statement: 
Let me be clear, there was absolutely no 
quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid 
and any investigation into the 2016 election. 
The president never told me to withhold any 
money until the Ukrainians did anything re-
lated to the server. 
The only reasons we were holding the 
money was because of concern about lack of 
support from other nations and concerns 
over corruption. Accordingly, Mr. Mulvaney 
in no way confirmed the link between the 
paused security assistance and investiga-
tions. A garbled or misinterpreted statement 
or a mistaken statement that is promptly 
clarified on the same day as the original 
statement is not the kind of reliable evi-
dence that would lead to the removal of the 
President of the United States from office. In 
any event, Mr. Mulvaney also stated during 
the press conference itself that the money 
held up had absolutely nothing to do with 
Biden. 
Now, why does this all matter? I 
think Senator ROMNEY really got to 
the heart of this issue on Thursday 
evening when he asked both parties 
whether there is any evidence that 
President Trump directed anyone who 
tell the Ukrainians that security as-
sistance was being held up on the con-
dition of an investigation into the 
Bidens. That was the question. There is 
no such evidence. 
Fifth, the security assistance was re-
leased when the President’s concerns 
with burden-sharing and corruption 
were addressed by a number of people, 
including some in this Chamber today, 
without Ukraine ever announcing or 
undertaking any investigations. You 
have heard repeatedly that no one in 
the administration knew why the secu-
rity assistance was paused. That is not 
true. Two of the House managers’ own 
witnesses testified regarding the rea-
son for the pause. As Mr. Morrison tes-
tified at a July meeting attended by of-
ficials throughout the executive branch 
agencies, the reason provided for the 
pause by a representative from the Of-
fice of Management and Budget was 
that 
the 
President 
was 
concerned 
about corruption in Ukraine and he 
wanted to make sure Ukraine was 
doing enough to manage that corrup-
tion. 
Further, 
according 
to 
Mark 
Sandy, Deputy Associate Director for 
National Security, Office for Manage-
ment and Budget, we had received re-
quests for additional information on 
what other countries were contributing 
to Ukraine. 
We told you about the work that was 
being done to monitor and collect in-
formation about anti-corruption re-
forms in Ukraine and burden-sharing 
during the summer pause. We told you 
about how, when President Zelensky 
asked Vice President PENCE in Poland 
about the pause, Vice President PENCE 
asked, according to Jennifer Williams, 
what the status of his reform efforts 
were that he could then convey back to 
the President and also wanting to hear 
if there was more that European coun-
tries could do to support Ukraine. Mr. 
Morrison, who was actually at the War-
saw meeting, testified similarly that 
Vice President PENCE delivered a mes-
sage about anti-corruption and burden- 
sharing. 
We told you about the September 11 
call with President Trump, Senator 
PORTMAN, and Vice President PENCE. 
Mr. Morrison testified that the entire 
process culminating in the September 
11 call gave the President the con-
fidence he needed to approve the re-
lease of the security sector assistance, 
all without any investigations being 
announced. 
Now, I focused so far on the House 
managers’ allegation that there was a 
quid pro quo for the security assist-
ance. Let me turn very briefly to the 
claim that a Presidential meeting was 
also conditioned on investigations. Re-
member, by the end of the July 25 call, 
President Trump had personally in-
vited President Zelensky to meet three 
times—twice by phone, once in a letter, 
without any preconditions. You heard 
the White House was working behind 
the scenes to schedule the meeting and 
how difficult scheduling those meet-
ings 
can 
be. 
The 
two 
Presidents 
planned to meet in Warsaw, just as 
President Zelensky requested on the 
July 25 call. President Trump had to 
cancel at the last minute due to Hurri-
cane Dorian. President Trump and 
President Zelensky then met 3 weeks 
later in New York without Ukraine an-
nouncing any investigations. 
Finally, one thing that the House 
managers’ witnesses agreed upon was 
that President Trump has strengthened 
the relationship between the U.S. and 
Ukraine and has been a better friend to 
Ukraine and a stronger opponent of 
Russian 
aggression 
than 
President 
Obama. 
Most 
notably, 
Ambassador 
Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and Am-
bassador Yovanovitch all testified that 
President Trump’s reversal of his pred-
ecessor’s refusal to send the Ukrain-
ians lethal aid was a meaningful and 
significant policy development and im-
provement for which President Trump 
deserves credit. 
Just last week, Ambassador Volker, 
who knows more about U.S.-Ukraine 
relationships than nearly, if not, every-
one, published a piece in Foreign Pol-
icy magazine. I would like to read you 
an excerpt: 
Beginning in mid-2017, and continuing 
until the impeachment investigation began 
in 
September 
2019, 
U.S. 
policy 
toward 
Ukraine was strong, consistent, and enjoyed 
support across the administration, bipar-
tisan support in Congress, and support upon 
U.S. allies and in Ukraine itself. 
The Trump administration also coordi-
nated Ukraine policy closely with allies in 
Europe and Canada—maintaining a united 
front against Russian aggression and in 
favor of Ukraine’s democracy, reform, sov-
ereignty, and territorial integrity. Ukraine 
policy is one of the few areas where U.S. and 
European policies have been in lockstep. The 
administration lifted the Obama-era ban on 
the sale of lethal arms to Ukraine, deliv-
ering, among other things, Javelin anti-tank 
missiles, coast guard cutters, and anti-sniper 
systems. Despite the recent furor over the 
pause in U.S. security assistance this past 
summer, the circumstances of which are the 
topic of impeachment hearings, U.S. defen-
sive support for Ukraine has been and re-
mains robust. 
And more, according to Ambassador 
Volker: 
It is therefore a tragedy for both the 
United States and Ukraine that U.S. par-
tisan politics, which have culminated in the

S781 
February 3, 2020 
ongoing impeachment process, have left 
Ukraine and its new reform-minded presi-
dent, Volodymyr Zelensky, exposed and rel-
atively isolated. The only one who benefits 
from this is Russian President Vladimir 
Putin. 
Those are the words of Ambassador 
Volker. He was one of the House man-
agers’ key witnesses. He was the very 
first witness to testify in the House 
proceedings on October 3. So I think it 
is fitting that he may be the last wit-
ness we hear from. In his parting 
words, Ambassador Volker admonishes 
that it is U.S. partisan politics which 
have culminated in this impeachment 
process that have imperiled Ukraine. 
In sum, the House managers’ case is 
not overwhelming, and it is not undis-
puted. The House managers bear the 
very heavy burden of proof. They did 
not meet it. It is not because they 
didn’t get the additional witnesses or 
documents that they failed to pursue. 
It is because their witnesses have al-
ready offered substantial evidence un-
dermining their case, and, important, 
as you have heard from Professor 
Dershowitz and from Mr. Philbin, the 
first article does not support or allege 
an impeachable offense regardless of 
any additional witnesses or documents. 
Members of the Senate, it has been 
an incredible honor and privilege to 
speak to you in this Chamber. I hope 
that what I have shown has been help-
ful to your understanding of the facts, 
and I respectfully ask you to vote to 
acquit the President of the wrongful 
charges against him. 
I yield to Mr. Philbin. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, we have 
heard repeatedly throughout the past 
week and a half or so that the Presi-
dent is not above the law, and I would 
like to focus in my last remarks here 
on an equally important principle— 
that the House of Representatives also 
is not above the law in the way they 
conduct the impeachment proceedings 
and bring a matter here before the Sen-
ate, because in very significant and im-
portant respects, they didn’t follow the 
law. 
From the outset, they began an im-
peachment inquiry here without a vote 
from the House and, therefore, without 
lawful authority delegated to any com-
mittees to begin an impeachment in-
quiry against the President of the 
United States. That was unprecedented 
in our history. The Speaker of the 
House does not have authority, by 
holding a press conference, to delegate 
the sole power of impeachment from 
the House to a committee, and the re-
sult was 23 totally unauthorized and 
invalid subpoenas were issued at the 
beginning of this impeachment hear-
ing. 
After that, the House violated every 
principle of due process and funda-
mental fairness in the way the hear-
ings were conducted, and we have been 
through that. I am not going to go 
through the details again, but it is sig-
nificant because denying the President 
the ability to be present through coun-
sel to cross-examine witnesses and 
present 
evidence 
fundamentally 
skewed the proceedings in the House of 
Representatives. It left the President 
without the ability to have a fair pro-
ceeding, and it meant it reflected the 
fact that those proceedings were not 
truly designed as a search for truth. We 
have procedural protections. We have 
the right of cross-examination as a 
mechanism for getting to the facts, and 
that was not present in the House of 
Representatives. 
Lastly, Manager SCHIFF, as an inter-
ested witness who had been involved 
in—or at least his staff—discussions 
with the whistleblower, then guided 
factual inquiry in the House. 
So why does all of this matter? It 
matters because the lack of a vote 
meant that there was no democratic 
accountability and no lawful author-
ization from the beginning of the proc-
ess. It meant that there were proce-
dural defects that produced a record 
that this Chamber can’t rely on for any 
conclusion other than to reject the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment and to acquit 
the President. And it matters because 
the President, in response to these vio-
lations of the President’s rights—the 
failure to follow proper procedure, fail-
ure to follow the law—has rights of his 
own, rights of the executive branch to 
be asserted. And that is the President’s 
response to the invalid subpoenas— 
that they are invalid, and we are not 
going to comply with them. 
And the President asserted other 
rights of the executive branch. When 
there were subpoenas for his senior ad-
visers to come and testify, along with 
virtually every President since Nixon, 
he asserted the principle of immunity 
of the senior advisers, that they could 
not be called to testify. And the Presi-
dent asserted the defects in the sub-
poenas that called for executive branch 
officials to testify without the presence 
of agency counsel—all established prin-
ciples that have been asserted before. 
What do the House managers say in 
response? They accuse the President in 
their second article of impeachment of 
trying to assert obstruction—that this 
was an unprecedented response and un-
precedented refusal to cooperate. It 
was unprecedented the 23 subpoenas 
were issued in a Presidential impeach-
ment inquiry without valid authoriza-
tion from the House. The President’s 
response was to a totally unprece-
dented attempt by the House to do that 
which it had no authority to do. They 
have asserted today and on other occa-
sions that the President’s legal argu-
ment in response to these subpoenas— 
they have said that it is indiscrimi-
nate. There was just a blanket defi-
ance. I think I have shown that wasn’t 
true. There were three very specific 
legal rationales provided by the execu-
tive branch as to different defects and 
different subpoenas, and there were let-
ters explaining those defects. But there 
was no attempt by the House to at-
tempt 
an 
accommodations 
process, 
even though the White House offered to 
engage in an accommodations process. 
There was no attempt by the House to 
use other mechanisms to resolve the 
differences with the executive branch. 
It was just straight to impeachment. 
Now, they asserted today and on 
other occasions that the President’s 
counsel—that I and my colleagues— 
have made bad-faith legal arguments. 
They were just window dressings. 
In an ordinary court of law, one 
doesn’t accuse opposing counsel of 
making bad-faith arguments like that, 
and if you make that accusation, it has 
to be backed up with analysis, but 
there hasn’t been analysis here. There 
has just been accusation. 
When the President asserts the im-
munity of his senior advisers, that is a 
principle that has been asserted by vir-
tually every President since Nixon. Let 
me read you what Attorney General 
Janet Reno, during the Clinton admin-
istration, said about this exact immu-
nity. She said that immediate advisers 
to the President are immune from 
being compelled to testify before Con-
gress. ‘‘The immunity such advisers 
enjoy from testimonial compulsion by 
a congressional committee is absolute 
and may not be overborne by com-
peting congressional interests.’’ 
And she went onto say: ‘‘Compelling 
one of the President’s immediate advis-
ers to testify on a matter of executive 
decision-making would also raise seri-
ous constitutional problems, no matter 
the assertion of congressional need.’’ 
Was that bad faith? Was Attorney 
General Reno asserting that principle 
in bad faith, and President Clinton? 
President Obama asserted the same 
principle for his senior political advis-
ers. Was that bad faith? 
Of course not. 
These are principles defending the 
separation of powers that Presidents 
have asserted for decades. President 
Trump was defending the institutional 
interests of the Office of the Presi-
dency and is asserting the same prin-
ciples here. That is vital for the contin-
ued operation of the separation of pow-
ers. 
The House managers have also said 
that, once the President asserted these 
defects in their subpoenas and resisted 
them, they had no time to do anything 
else. They had to go straight to im-
peachment. They could not accommo-
date. They could not go through a con-
tempt process. They could not litigate. 
The idea that there is no time for 
dealing with that friction with the ex-
ecutive branch is really antithetical to 
the proper functioning of the separa-
tion of powers. It goes against part of 
the way the separation of powers is 
supposed to work. That interbranch 
friction is meant to take time to re-
solve. It is meant to slow things down 
and to be somewhat difficult to work 
through and to force the branches to 
work together to accommodate the in-
terests of each branch, not just to jump 
to the conclusion of, well, we have no

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S782 
February 3, 2020 
time for that. We have to assert abso-
lute authority on one side of the equa-
tion. 
This is something that Justice Bran-
deis pointed out in a famous dissent in 
Myers v. United States, but it has since 
been cited many times by the Court 
majority. 
He said: ‘‘The doctrine of the separa-
tion of powers was adopted by the Con-
vention of 1787, not to promote effi-
ciency’’—so he is saying not to make 
government move quickly—‘‘but to 
preclude 
the 
exercise 
of 
arbitrary 
power. The purpose was not to avoid 
friction but, by means of the inevitable 
friction incident to the distribution of 
the governmental powers among the 
three departments, to save the people 
from autocracy.’’ 
That is a vitally important principle. 
The friction between the branches, 
even if it means taking longer, even if 
it means not jumping straight to im-
peachment, is part of the constitu-
tional design, and it is required to 
force the branches to determine incre-
mentally where their interests lie, to 
resolve disputes incrementally, and not 
to jump straight to the ultimate nu-
clear weapon of the Constitution. 
We have also heard from the House 
managers that everything the Presi-
dent did here in asserting the preroga-
tives of his office—in asserting the 
principles 
of 
immunity—must 
be 
wrong, must be rejected because only 
the guilty will assert a privilege; only 
the guilty will not allow evidence. 
That is definitely not a principle of 
American jurisprudence. It is antithet-
ical to the fundamental principles of 
our system of laws. As we have pointed 
out in our trial memorandum in 
Bordenkircher v. Hayes and in other 
decisions, the Supreme Court has made 
clear that the very idea of punishing 
someone for asserting rights or privi-
leges or suggesting that asserting the 
right or privilege is evidence of guilt is 
contrary to basic principles of due 
process. 
It takes on an even more malignant 
tenor to it when that principle is as-
serted in the context of a dispute be-
tween the branches relating to the 
boundaries of their relative powers, be-
cause what the House is essentially as-
serting in this case is that any asser-
tion of the prerogatives of the Office of 
the President—any attempt to main-
tain the principles of separation of 
powers of executive confidentiality 
that have been asserted by past Presi-
dents—can be treated by the House as 
evidence of guilt. And here, their entire 
second 
Article 
of 
Impeachment 
is 
structured on the assumption that the 
House can treat the assertion of prin-
ciples grounded in the separation of 
powers as an impeachable offense. 
Boiled down to its essence, it is an 
assertion that defending the separation 
of powers—if the President does it in a 
way that they don’t like and in a time 
that they don’t like—can be treated as 
an impeachable offense. That is an in-
credibly dangerous assertion because, 
if it were accepted, it would fundamen-
tally alter the balance between the dif-
ferent branches of our government. 
It 
would 
suggest—and 
Professor 
Turley explained this, and Professor 
Dershowitz explained it here—that, if 
Congress makes a demand on the exec-
utive and the executive resists based 
on separation of powers principles that 
past Presidents have asserted, Congress 
can nonetheless say: We have decided 
to proceed by impeachment. 
This is the principle they assert in 
the House Judiciary Committee’s re-
port: We have the sole power of im-
peachment. That means we are the sole 
judge of our own actions. There is no 
need for accommodation, and there is 
no need for the courts. We will deter-
mine that any resistance you provide is 
itself impeachable. 
That would fundamentally transform 
our government by essentially giving 
the House the same sort of power as a 
parliamentary 
system—to 
use 
im-
peachment as an effective vote of ‘‘no 
confidence’’ against a Prime Minister. 
This is not the way the Framers set up 
our three-branch system of government 
with a powerful Executive who would 
be independent from the legislature. 
That is why Professor Turley explained 
that the second Article of Impeach-
ment here would be an abuse of power 
by Congress. It would make the Execu-
tive dependent on Congress in a man-
ner antithetical to the system that the 
Framers had envisioned. 
So why is it that there are all of 
these defects in the House managers’ 
case for impeachment? Why are they 
asserting principles like ‘‘only the 
guilty would assert privileges’’? That is 
not a part of our system of law. Why 
are they asserting that, if the Execu-
tive resists, the House has the sole 
power to determine the boundaries of 
its own power in relation to the Execu-
tive? That is also not something that is 
in our system of jurisprudence. And 
why the lack of due process in the pro-
ceedings below? 
I think, as we have explained, it is 
because this was a purely partisan im-
peachment from the start. It was pure-
ly partisan and purely political, and 
that is something that the Framers 
foresaw. 
I will point to one passage from Fed-
eralist No. 65. There are a number of 
different passages from that which 
have been cited over the course of the 
past week, but I don’t think this one 
has. It is just after Hamilton points 
out—he warns—that an impeachment 
in the House could be the result of the 
‘‘persecution of an intemperate or de-
signing majority in the House of Rep-
resentatives.’’ 
Then he goes on: ‘‘Though this latter 
supposition 
may 
seem 
harsh, 
and 
might not be likely often to be 
verified, yet it ought not to be forgot-
ten that the demon of faction will, at 
certain seasons, extend his sceptre over 
all numerous bodies of men.’’ 
Now, that is very 18th century lan-
guage. We don’t talk about demons ex-
tending their scepters over men, but it 
is prescient nonetheless. We might not 
be comfortable with the terms, but it is 
accurate for what can happen, and that 
is what has happened in this impeach-
ment. 
This was a purely partisan, political 
process. It was opposed bipartisanly in 
the House. It was done by a process 
that was not designed to persuade any-
one or to get to the truth or to provide 
process and abide by past precedents. It 
was done to get it finished by Christ-
mas, on a political timetable, and it is 
not 
something 
that 
this 
Chamber 
should condone. That in itself provides 
a sufficient and substantial reason for 
rejecting the Articles of Impeachment. 
Members of the Senate, it has been 
an honor to be able to address you over 
the past week and a half or 2 weeks, 
and I thank you for your attention. 
I yield to Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Majority Leader MCCONNELL, 
Democratic Leader SCHUMER, House 
managers, I want to join my colleagues 
in thanking you for your patience over 
these 2 weeks. 
I want to focus on one last point. We 
believe that we have established over-
whelmingly that both Articles of Im-
peachment have failed to allege im-
peachable offenses and that, therefore, 
both articles—I and II—must fail. 
This entire campaign of impeach-
ment—that started from the very first 
day the President was inaugurated—is 
a partisan one, and it should never hap-
pen again. For 3 years, this push for 
impeachment came straight from the 
President’s opponents, and when it fi-
nally reached a crescendo, it put this 
body—the U.S. Senate—into a horrible 
position. 
I want to start by taking a look 
back. 
On the screen is a graphic of a Wash-
ington Post headline on January 20, 
2017: ‘‘The Campaign to impeach Presi-
dent Trump has begun.’’ This was post-
ed 19 minutes after he was sworn in. 
I also want to play a video in which 
Members, as early as January 15, 2017— 
before the President was sworn into of-
fice—were calling for his impeachment. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. RASKIN. Let me say this for Donald 
Trump, whom I may well be voting to im-
peach. 
Mr. ELLISON. I think that Donald Trump 
has already done a number of things which 
have legitimately raised a question of im-
peachment. 
Ms. WATERS. And I will fight every day 
until he is impeached. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. I rise today, Mr. 
Speaker, to call for the impeachment of the 
President of the United States of America. 
Mr. COHEN. The main reason I’m inter-
ested is not so much to win the Senate, 
which is a byproduct, but it’s because I think 
he has committed impeachable offenses. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. But if we get to 
that point, then, yes, I think that’s grounds 
to start impeachment. 
Mr. COHEN. So we’re calling upon the 
House to begin impeachment hearings imme-
diately. 
Question. Why do you think specifically he 
should be impeached?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S783 
February 3, 2020 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Well, there are five rea-
sons why we think he should be impeached. 
Question. On the impeachment of Donald 
Trump, how would you vote? 
Ms. OMAR. I would vote yes. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. I would vote to im-
peach. 
Ms. TLAIB. Because we’re going to im-
peach the [bleep]. 
Mr. SHERMAN. I introduced the Articles 
of Impeachment in July of 2017. All I did yes-
terday was make sure that those articles did 
not expire. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. I am concerned that, 
if we don’t impeach this President, he will 
get reelected. 
Ms. WARREN. It is time to bring impeach-
ment charges against him. 
Mr. NADLER. My personal view is that he 
richly deserves impeachment. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. One of the 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives said that we are bringing these 
Articles of Impeachment so he doesn’t 
get elected again. 
Here we are, 10 months before an 
election, doing exactly what they pre-
dicted. The whistleblower’s lawyer, Mr. 
Zaid, sent out a tweet on January 30, 
2017. 
Let me put that up on the screen: 
The #coup has started. First of many steps. 
#rebellion. #impeachment will follow ulti-
mately. 
And here we are. 
What this body, what this Nation, 
and what this President have just en-
dured—what the House managers have 
forced upon this great body—is unprec-
edented and unacceptable. This is ex-
actly and precisely what the Founders 
feared. This was the first totally par-
tisan Presidential impeachment in our 
Nation’s history, and it should be our 
last. 
What the House Democrats have done 
to this Nation, to the Constitution, to 
the Office of the President, to the 
President himself, and to this body is 
outrageous. They have cheapened the 
awesome power of impeachment, and, 
unfortunately, of course, the country is 
not better for that. 
We urge this body to dispense with 
these partisan Articles of Impeachment 
for the sake of the Nation, for the sake 
of the Constitution. 
As we have demonstrably proved, the 
articles are flawed on their face. They 
were the product of a reckless im-
peachment inquiry that violated all no-
tions of due process and fundamental 
fairness. Then incredibly—incredibly— 
when 
these 
articles 
were 
finally 
brought to this Chamber without a sin-
gle Republican vote, the managers then 
claimed that now—now—they needed 
more process; that now they needed 
more witnesses; that all of the wit-
nesses that they compiled and all of 
the testimony that you heard was not 
enough; that your job was to do their 
job—the one, frankly, they failed to do. 
We have already said, many times, 
the charges themselves do not allege a 
crime or a misdemeanor, let alone a 
high crime or a misdemeanor. There is 
nothing in the charges that could per-
mit the removal of a duly elected 
President or warrant the negation of 
an election and the subversion of the 
American people’s will. That should be 
whatever party you are affiliated with. 
You are being asked to do this when, 
tonight, the citizens of Iowa are going 
to be caucusing for the first caucus of 
the Presidential election season for the 
Democratic Party—tonight. 
I think there is one thing that is 
clear. The President has had a concern 
about other countries’ carrying their 
fair share of burden of financial aid. No 
one can doubt—and I think we have 
clearly set forth—the issue of corrup-
tion in Ukraine. 
The President’s and the administra-
tion’s policy on evaluating foreign aid 
and the conditions upon which it is 
given have been clear. Mr. Purpura laid 
that out in great detail. 
The bottom line is that the Presi-
dent’s opponents don’t like the Presi-
dent, and they really don’t like his 
policies. They objected to the fact that 
the President chose not to rely each 
and every time on the advice of some of 
his subordinates, even though he, not 
those unelected bureaucrats who work 
for him, were elected to office. 
The President, under our constitu-
tional structure, is the one who decides 
our Nation’s foreign policy. Here is a 
perfect example—the House managers 
brought this up frequently: Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman. He admitted on page 
155 of his transcript testimony that he 
‘‘did not know if there was a crime or 
anything of that nature’’—that is his 
quote—but that he ‘‘had deep policy 
concerns.’’ So there you have it. The 
real issue is policy disputes. 
Elections have consequences. We all 
know that. And if you do not like the 
policies of a particular administration 
or a particular candidate, you are free 
and welcome to vote for another can-
didate. But the answer is elections, not 
impeachment. 
To be clear, in our country, in the 
United States, the President, elected 
by the American people, is, in the 
words of the Supreme Court, ‘‘the sole 
organ of the federal government in the 
field of international relations’’ and 
foreign policy for our government—no 
unelected bureaucrats, not unhappy 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives. And however you were to define 
‘‘high 
crimes 
and 
misdemeanors,’’ 
there is no definition that includes dis-
agreeing with a policy decision as an 
acceptable ground for removal of a 
President of the United States. None. 
The first Article of Impeachment is, 
therefore, constitutionally invalid and 
should be immediately rejected by the 
Senate. 
Now, as to the second Article of Im-
peachment, President Trump in no way 
obstructed Congress. The President 
acted with extraordinary transparency 
by declassifying and releasing the tran-
script for the July 25 call and the ear-
lier call. It is that July 25 call which is 
purportedly at the heart of the Articles 
of Impeachment. He did so soon after 
the inquiry was announced. 
And despite the fact that privileges 
apply that could have been asserted, he 
released them anyway in order to fa-
cilitate the House’s inquiry and cut 
through all of it—all of the hearsay, all 
of the histrionics—to get the transcript 
out. 
Now, I want to take a moment be-
cause my colleague Deputy White 
House Counsel Pat Philbin addressed 
this idea of privilege. I have heard over 
and over again—and you have, too— 
phrases like: coverup; that the asser-
tion of a privilege is a coverup. 
Here is what the Supreme Court of 
the United States has said about privi-
leges in a variety of contexts: 
To punish a person because he has done 
what the law allows him to do is a due proc-
ess violation of the [basic order]—the . . . 
basic sort, and for an agent of the state to 
pursue a course of action whose objective is 
to penalize a person’s reliance on his con-
stitutional rights is patently unconstitu-
tional. 
And how much more so when you are 
talking about the President of the 
United States. 
How about this? And this goes to the 
context of assertions of privilege and 
other constitutional privileges. The al-
legation has been that if you assert a 
privilege, you are assumed to be guilty. 
That has been the assertion. 
Why would you do that? We have ex-
plained at great length—and I do not 
want to go over that again—the impor-
tance of the executive privilege and 
what it means to separation of powers 
and the functioning of our government, 
but I will say this: As the Supreme 
Court has recognized in other contexts 
with other privileges, the privilege 
serves to protect the innocent who oth-
erwise might be ensnared by ambig-
uous circumstances. 
In another Supreme Court 
case, 
Quinn v. The United States: ‘‘The 
privilege, this Court has stated, was 
generally regarded then, as now, as a 
privilege of great value, a protection to 
the innocent . . . ’’ The opinion goes on 
to say that ‘‘safeguard against heed-
less, unfounded or tyrannical prosecu-
tions.’’ 
I traced for you, and I am not going 
to do it again, how all of this started 
all those years ago, 3 years ago—how 
all of this began. There is no point to 
go over that because that evidence is 
undisputed, and the FISA Court’s most 
recent orders put that into fair play. 
We have talked about the fact that 
the House violated its own funda-
mental rules in a series of unlawful 
subpoenas. I won’t go over that again. 
Mr. Philbin laid that out in great de-
tail. 
But I do think it is important to note 
that, when seeking the advice of the 
President’s closest advisers, despite the 
well-known, bipartisan guidance from 
the Department of Justice regarding 
immunity, the House managers act as 
if it does not exist. They sought testi-
mony on matters from the executive 
branch’s confidential, internal deci-
sion-making process on matters of for-
eign relations and national security, 
and that is when protections are at 
their highest level.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S784 
February 3, 2020 
Let’s not forget that the House 
barred the attendance of executive 
branch counsel at witness proceedings 
when executive branch members were 
being examined. 
Notwithstanding 
these 
substantial 
abuses of process, the executive branch 
responded to each and every subpoena 
and identified the specific deficiencies 
found in each. You cannot just remove 
constitutional violations by saying you 
didn’t comply. 
You have heard that one recipient of 
a subpoena, and this is—in fact, we 
have talked about it a number of 
times, but I think as we wrap up, I 
think it is worth saying again. 
One subpoena recipient did seek a de-
claratory judgment as to the validity 
of the subpoena that he had received. It 
was set up to go to court. A judge was 
going to make a decision. The House 
withdrew the subpoena and mooted the 
recipient’s case before the court could 
rule. 
Now, was that because they didn’t 
like the judge that was selected? Was it 
because they didn’t like the way the 
ruling was going to go? Was it they 
didn’t mean to have that witness in the 
first place? 
Whatever the reason, there is one un-
disputed fact: As the case was in court, 
they mooted it out by removing the 
subpoena. 
The assertion of valid constitutional 
privileges cannot be an impeachable of-
fense, and that is what article II is 
based on, the obstruction of Congress. 
For the sake of the Constitution, for 
the sake of the Office of the President, 
this body must stand as a steady bul-
wark against this reckless and dan-
gerous proposition. It doesn’t just af-
fect this President; it affects every 
man or woman who occupies that high 
office. 
So as we said with the first Article of 
Impeachment, we believe the second 
Article of Impeachment is invalid and 
should also be rejected. 
In passing the first Article of Im-
peachment, the House attempted to 
usurp the President’s constitutional 
power to determine policy, especially 
foreign policy. 
In passing the second Article of Im-
peachment, the House attempted to 
control the constitutional privileges 
and 
immunities 
of 
the 
executive 
branch—all 
of 
this 
while 
simulta-
neously disrespecting the Framers’ sys-
tem of checks and balances, which des-
ignate the judicial branch as the arbi-
ter of interbranch disputes. 
By 
approving 
both 
articles, 
the 
House of Representatives violated our 
constitutional order, illegally abused 
our power of impeachment in order to 
obstruct the President’s ability to 
faithfully execute the duties of his of-
fice. 
These articles fail on their face as 
they do not meet the constitutional 
standard for impeachable offenses. No 
amount of testimony could change that 
fact. 
We have already discussed some of 
the specifics. I think Alexander Ham-
ilton has been quoted a lot, and there 
is a reason. What has occurred over the 
past 
2 
weeks—really, 
the 
past 
3 
months—is exactly what Alexander 
Hamilton and other Founders of our 
great country feared. 
I believe that Hamilton was pro-
phetic in Federalist 65 when he warned 
how impeachment had the ability to 
‘‘agitate’’—his words—‘‘the passions of 
the whole community, and . . . divide 
it into parties more or less friendly or 
inimical to the accused. 
He warned that impeachment would 
‘‘connect itself with the pre-existing 
factions, and will enlist all their ani-
mosities, partialities, influence, and 
interest on one side or on the other.’’ 
He continued: 
The convention, it appears, thought the 
Senate— 
This body— 
[the] most fit depositary of this important 
trust. Those who can best discern the intrin-
sic difficulty of the thing, will be least hasty 
in condemning that opinion, and will be 
most inclined to allow due weight to the ar-
guments which may be supposed to have pro-
duced it. 
In the same Federalist 65, Hamilton 
regarded the Members of this Senate 
not only as the inquisitors for the Na-
tion but as the representatives of the 
Nation as a whole. 
He said these words: 
Where else than in the Senate could have 
been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified 
or significantly independent? What other 
body would be likely to feel confident 
enough in its own situation to preserve, 
unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary im-
partiality between an individual accused, 
and the representatives of the people, his ac-
cusers. 
You took an oath. They questioned 
the oath. You are sitting here as the 
trier of fact. They said the Senate is on 
trial. 
Based on all of the presentations that 
we made in our trial brief, in the argu-
ments that we have put forward today, 
again, we believe both articles should 
be immediately rejected. 
Now, our Nation’s representatives 
holding office in this great body must 
unite today to protect our Constitution 
and the separation of powers. And, you 
know, there was a time, not that long 
ago, even within this administration, 
where bipartisan agreements could be 
reached to serve the interests of the 
American people. 
Take a listen to this. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Senator MARKEY. Today we had a beau-
tiful, bipartisan moment where Democrats 
and Republicans, working together, to keep 
that fentanyl out of our country, to use 
these devices to accomplish that goal. It is 
not perfect. We need to do a lot more, but 
today was a very good start, and I want to 
praise all of the people—Democrats and Re-
publicans and the President—for working to-
gether on this bill. 
Senator SHAHEEN. As has been said, and 
we can see by the people assembled here, if 
we work together in a bipartisan way, we can 
get things done. This is a place where we can 
all agree that we’ve got to do more and 
where we can work together. So I applaud 
everyone’s efforts. 
President TRUMP. We are proudly joined 
today by so many Members of Congress—Re-
publicans, Democrats—who worked very, 
very hard on this bill. This was really an ef-
fort of everybody. It was a bipartisan suc-
cess—something you don’t hear too much 
about, but I think you will be. I actually be-
lieve we may be—will be over the coming pe-
riod of time. I hope so. I think so. It is so 
good for the country. 
President TRUMP. Thank you, everybody. 
This was an incredible bipartisan support. 
We passed this in the Senate 87 to 12. That’s 
unheard of. And then in the House we passed 
it 358 to 36. 
Senator COONS. . . . be here to help cele-
brate your signing of this next step in the 
critical Women’s Global and Prosperity De-
velopment Initiative. It dovetails nicely 
with the bill—the bipartisan bill you signed 
into law with the WEEE Act, which recog-
nizes this as a critical strategy. So I think 
this is a tremendous initiative. Thank you, 
Mr. Trump. 
President TRUMP. Thank you very much. 
I appreciate it. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. This is what 
the American people expect. 
I simply ask this body to stand firm 
today to protect the integrity of the 
U.S. Senate, stand firm today to pro-
tect the Office of the President, stand 
firm today to protect the Constitution, 
stand firm today to protect the will of 
the American people and their vote, 
stand firm today to protect our Nation. 
And I ask that this partisan impeach-
ment come to an end to restore our 
constitutional balance, for that is, in 
my view and in our view, what justice 
demands and the Constitution requires. 
With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield 
my time to the White House Counsel, 
Mr. Pat Cipollone. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, 
Members of the Senate. 
I will leave you with just a few brief 
points: 
First, I want to express on behalf of 
our entire team our gratitude—our 
gratitude to you, Mr. Chief Justice, for 
presiding over this trial; our gratitude 
to you, Leader MCCONNELL; our grati-
tude to you, Democratic Leader SCHU-
MER; and all of you on both sides of the 
aisle for your time and attention. 
I also want to express my gratitude 
to our team. It is large, and with the 
large number of people who have 
helped in this effort—I won’t name 
them all—but I want to thank them for 
their effort and their hard work in the 
defense of the Constitution, in defense 
of the President, in defense of the 
American people’s right to vote. I want 
to thank, as Members of that team, the 
Republican Members of the House of 
Representatives who have also been en-
gaged in that effort throughout this 
entire period of time and the Demo-
crats in the House who voted against 
this partisan impeachment. I also want 
to thank the President of the United 
States for his confidence in us to send 
us here to represent him to all of you 
in this great body and for all he has 
done on behalf of the American people. 
I would make just a couple of addi-
tional points. No. 1, as we have said re-
peatedly, we have never been in a situ-
ation like this in our history. We have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S785 
February 3, 2020 
an impeachment that is purely par-
tisan and political. It is opposed by bi-
partisan Members of the House. It does 
not even allege a violation of law. It is 
passed in an election year, and we are 
sitting here on the day that election 
season begins in Iowa. It is wrong. 
There is only one answer to that, and 
the answer is to reject those Articles of 
Impeachment, to have confidence in 
the American people, to have con-
fidence in the result of the upcoming 
election, to have confidence and re-
spect for the last election and not 
throw it out and to leave the choice of 
the President to the American people 
and to leave to them also the account-
ability to the Members of the House of 
Representatives who did that. That is 
what the Constitution requires, and I 
think that should be done on a bipar-
tisan basis, and that is what I ask you 
to do. 
Point No. 2: I believe the American 
people are tired of the endless inves-
tigations and false investigations that 
have been coming out of the House 
from the beginning, as my colleague 
Mr. Sekulow pointed out. It is a waste 
of tax dollars. It is a waste of the 
American people’s time and, I would 
argue, more importantly—most impor-
tantly—the opportunity cost of that— 
the opportunity cost of that—what you 
could be doing, what the House could 
be doing. Working with the President 
to achieve those things on behalf of the 
American people is far more important 
than the endless investigations, the 
endless false attacks, the besmirching 
of the names of good people. This is 
something we should reject together, 
and we should move forward in a bipar-
tisan fashion and in a way that this 
President has done successfully. 
He has achieved successful results in 
the economy and across so many other 
areas, working with you on both sides 
of the aisle, and he wants to continue 
to do that. That is what I believe the 
American people want those of you 
elected to come here to Washington to 
focus on, to spend your time on—to 
unify us, as opposed to the bitter divi-
sion that is caused by these types of 
proceedings. 
So at the end of the day, we put our 
faith in the Senate. We put our faith in 
the Senate because we know you will 
put your faith in the American people. 
You will leave this choice to them, 
where it belongs. We believe that they 
should choose the President. We be-
lieve that this President, day after day, 
has 
put 
their 
interests 
first, 
has 
achieved successful results, has ful-
filled the promises he made to them, 
and he is eager to go before the Amer-
ican people in this upcoming election. 
At the end of the day, that is the 
only result; it is a result, I believe, 
guided by your wise words from the 
past that we can, together, end the era 
of impeachment; that we can, together, 
put faith in the American people, put 
faith in their wisdom, put faith in their 
judgment. That is where our Founders 
put the power. That is where it be-
longs. 
I urge you, on behalf of those Ameri-
cans—of every American—on behalf of 
all of your constituents, to reject these 
Articles of Impeachment. It is the 
right thing for our country. The Presi-
dent has done nothing wrong, and these 
types of impeachments must end. 
You will vindicate the right to vote, 
you will vindicate the Constitution, 
you will vindicate the rule of law by re-
jecting these articles. I ask you to do 
that on a bipartisan basis this week 
and end the era of impeachment once 
and for all. 
I thank you from the bottom of my 
heart for listening to us, for your at-
tention, and for considering our case 
on behalf of the President. 
I come here today to ask you to re-
ject these Articles of Impeachment. 
Reject these Articles of Impeachment. 
Thank you for granting us the per-
mission to appear here at the Senate 
on behalf of this President, and I ask 
you on his behalf, on behalf of the 
American people to reject these arti-
cles. 
Thank you. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, it is a problem 
that here at the end of the trial the 
President’s lawyers still dispute the 
meaning of high crimes and mis-
demeanors. Some say it requires an or-
dinary crime or that if the President 
misbehaves when he thinks it is good 
for the country, it is OK. Neither is 
correct. We need to clear this up by 
looking at what the Founders said. 
When the Founders created the Presi-
dency, they gave the President great 
power. They had just been through a 
war to get rid of a King with too much 
power, and they needed a check on the 
great power given to the President. It 
was late in the Constitutional Conven-
tion that they turned to the impeach-
ment clause. Madison argued in favor 
of impeachment. He said it was indis-
pensable. 
Mason asked: 
Shall any man be above Justice? Above all 
shall that man be above it, who can commit 
the most extensive injustice? 
Randolph defended ‘‘the propriety of 
impeachments,’’ saying: ‘‘The Execu-
tive will have great opportunitys of 
abusing his power.’’ 
The initial draft of the Constitution 
provided for impeachment only for 
treason or bribery. Mason asked: 
Why is the provision restrained to Treason 
& bribery only? Treason as defined in the 
Constitution will not reach many great and 
dangerous offences. 
And he added: 
Hastings is not guilty of Treason. At-
tempts to subvert the Constitution may not 
be Treason as . . . defined. 
Now Hastings’ impeachment in Brit-
ain at this time was well known, and it 
wasn’t limited to a crime. 
They considered adding the word 
‘‘maladministration’’ to capture abuse 
of Presidential power, but Madison ob-
jected. He said: ‘‘So a vague a term 
would be equivalent to a tenure during 
pleasure of the Senate.’’ So maladmin-
istration was withdrawn and replaced 
with the more certain term ‘‘high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ because the 
Founders knew the law. 
Blackstone’s 
Commentary, 
which 
Madison said was ‘‘a book in every 
man’s hand,’’ described high crimes 
and misdemeanors as offenses against 
King and government. 
Hamilton called high crimes and mis-
demeanors ‘‘those offenses which pro-
ceed from the misconduct of public 
men, or, in other words, from the abuse 
or violation of some public trust.’’ 
During ratification, Randolph in Vir-
ginia cited the President’s receipt of 
presents or emoluments from a foreign 
power as an example. And Mason’s ex-
ample was a President who may ‘‘par-
don crimes which were advised by him-
self,’’ or before indictment or convic-
tion to ‘‘stop inquiry and prevent de-
tection.’’ It is clear. They knew what 
they wrote. 
The President’s lawyers tried to cre-
ate a muddle to confuse you. Don’t let 
them. High crimes and misdemeanors 
mean abuse of power against the con-
stitutional order, conduct that is cor-
rupt, whether or not a crime. 
Now some say: No impeachment 
when there is an election coming. But 
without term limits when they wrote 
the Constitution, there was always an 
election coming. If impeachment in 
election years was not to be, our 
Founders would have said so. 
So here we are: Congress passed a law 
to fund Ukraine to fight the Russians 
who invaded their country. President 
Trump illegally held that funding up to 
coerce Ukraine to announce an inves-
tigation to hurt his strongest election 
opponent. He abused his power cor-
ruptly to benefit himself personally, 
and then he tried to cover it up. That 
is impeachable. 
The facts are clear, and so is the Con-
stitution. The only question is what 
you, the Senate, will do. 
Our Founders created a government 
where the tension between the three 
branches 
would 
prevent 
authoritarianism; 
no 
one 
of 
the 
branches would be allowed to grab all 
the power. Impeachment was to make 
sure that the President, who has the 
greatest opportunity to grab power, 
would be held in check. It is a blunt in-
strument, but it is what our Founders 
gave us. 
Some of the Founders thought the 
mere existence of an impeachment 
clause would prevent misconduct by 
Presidents, but, sadly, they were wrong 
because twice in the last half century a 
President tried to corruptly use his 
power to cheat in an election—first, 
Nixon with Watergate, and now an-
other President corruptly abuses his 
power to cheat in an election. 
The Founders worried about fac-
tions—what we call political parties. 
They built a system where each branch 
of government would jealously guard 
their power, not one where guarding a 
faction 
was 
more 
important 
than 
guarding the government.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S786 
February 3, 2020 
Opposing a President of your own 
party isn’t easy. It wasn’t easy when 
Republican Caldwell Butler voted to 
impeach Nixon in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. It wasn’t easy for Senator 
Barry Goldwater to tell Nixon to re-
sign. But your oath is not to do the 
easy thing; it is to do impartial justice. 
It requires conviction and removal of 
President Trump. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, counsel for the Presi-
dent, Senators, since I was a little girl 
and started going to church, I have 
been inspired by the words of scripture: 
‘‘[W]hatever you did for one of the 
least of my brothers . . . you did for 
me.’’ 
We are called to always look out for 
the most vulnerable. Sometimes fight-
ing for the most vulnerable means 
holding the most powerful accountable, 
and that is what we are here to do 
today. 
The American people will have to 
live with the decisions made in this 
Chamber. In fact, Senators, I believe 
that the decision in this case will af-
fect 
the 
strength 
of 
democracies 
around the world. 
Democracy is a gift that each genera-
tion gives to the next one. If we say 
that this President can put his own in-
terests above all else, even when lives 
are at stake, then we give our Nation’s 
children a weaker democracy than we 
inherited from those that came before 
us. The next generation deserves bet-
ter. They are counting on us. 
I am a Catholic, and my faith teaches 
me that we all need forgiveness. I have 
given this President the benefit of the 
doubt from the beginning. Despite my 
strong opposition to so many of his 
policies, I know that the success of our 
Nation depends on the success of our 
leader. But he has let us down. 
Senators, we know what the Presi-
dent did and why he did it. This fact is 
seriously not in doubt. Senators on 
both sides of the aisle have said as 
much. The question for you now is, 
does it warrant removal from office? 
We say yes. 
We cannot simply hope that this 
President will realize that he has done 
wrong or was inappropriate and hope 
that he does better. We have done that 
so many other times. We know that he 
has not apologized. He has not offered 
to change. We all know that he will do 
it again. 
What President Trump did this time 
pierces the heart of who we are as a 
country. We must stop him from fur-
ther harming our democracy. We must 
stop him from further betraying his 
oath. We must stop him from tearing 
up our Constitution. 
The Founders knew that in order for 
our Republic to survive, we would need 
to be able to remove some of our lead-
ers from office when they put their in-
terests above the country’s interests. 
Senators, we have proven that. This 
President committed what is called the 
ABC’s of impeachable behavior—abus-
ing his power, betraying the Nation, 
and corrupting our elections. He de-
serves to be removed for taking the 
very actions that the Framers feared 
would undermine our country. The 
Framers designed impeachment for 
this very case. 
Senators, when I was growing up poor 
in South Texas, picking cotton, I con-
fess I didn’t spend any time thinking 
about the Framers. Like me, little 
girls and boys across America aren’t 
asking at home what the Framers 
meant 
by 
high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors, but, someday, they will ask 
why we didn’t do anything to stop this 
President, who put his own interest 
above what was good for all of us. They 
will ask. They will want to understand. 
Senators, we inherited a democracy. 
Now we must protect it and pass it on 
to the next generation. We simply 
can’t give our children a democracy if 
a President is above the law, because in 
this country no one is above the law— 
not me, not any of you, not even this 
President. 
(English translation of statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Nobody is above the law—nobody. 
This President must be removed. 
With that, I yield to my colleague Mr. 
CROW. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, 2 weeks 
ago we started this trial promising to 
show you that the President withheld 
$391 million of foreign military aid to 
force an ally at war to help him win 
the 2020 election. And by many of your 
own admissions, we succeeded in show-
ing you that, because the facts still 
matter. 
We also promised you that, eventu-
ally, all of the facts would come out, 
and that continues to be true. But we 
didn’t just show you that the President 
abused his power and obstructed Con-
gress. We painted a broader picture of 
President Trump—a picture of a man 
who 
thinks 
that 
the 
Constitution 
doesn’t serve as a check on his power, 
but, rather, gives it to him in an un-
limited way; a man who believes that 
his personal ambitions are synonymous 
with the good of the country; a man 
who, in his own words, thinks that if 
you are a star, they will let you do 
anything. In short, it is a picture of a 
man who will always put his own per-
sonal interests above the interests of 
the country that he has sworn to pro-
tect. 
But what is in an oath, anyway? Are 
they relics of the past? Do we simply 
recite them out of custom? To me, an 
oath represents a firm commitment to 
a life of service, a commitment to set 
aside your personal interest, your com-
fort, and your ambition to serve the 
greater good, and a commitment to 
sacrifice. 
I explained to you last week that I 
believe America is great not because of 
the ambition of any one man, not sim-
ply because we say it is true but be-
cause of our almost 250-year history. 
Millions of Americans have taken the 
oath, and they meant it. Many of them 
followed through on that oath by giv-
ing everything to keep it. 
But there is more to it than simply 
keeping your word, because an oath is 
also a bond between people who have 
made a common promise. Perhaps the 
strongest example is the promise be-
tween the Commander in Chief and our 
men and women in uniform. Those men 
and women took their oath with the 
understanding that the Commander in 
Chief, our President, will always put 
the interests of the country and their 
interests above his own, and under-
standing that his orders will be in the 
best interest of the country, and that 
their sacrifice in fulfilling those orders 
will always serve the common good. 
But what we have clearly shown in 
the last few weeks and what President 
Trump has shown us the past few years 
is that this promise flows only one 
way. As Maya Angelou said, ‘‘When 
someone shows you who they are, be-
lieve them the first time.’’ 
Many of us in this room are parents. 
We all try to teach our kids the impor-
tant lessons of life. One of those les-
sons is that you won’t always be the 
strongest, you won’t always be the 
fastest, and you won’t always win. 
There are a lot of things outside our 
control, but my wife and I have tried to 
teach our kids that what we can always 
control are our choices. 
It is in that spirit that hanging in my 
son’s room is a quote from Harry Pot-
ter. 
The 
quote 
is 
from 
Professor 
Dumbledore, who said: ‘‘It is our 
choices . . . that show what we truly 
are, far more than our abilities.’’ 
This trial will soon be over, but there 
will be many choices for all of us in the 
days ahead, the most pressing of which 
is how each of us will decide to fulfill 
our oath. More than our words, our 
choices will show the world who we 
really are, what type of leaders we will 
be, and what type of Nation we will be. 
So let me finish where I began, with 
an explanation of why I am here stand-
ing before you. I have been carrying 
my kids’ Constitutions these last few 
weeks, and this morning I wrote a note 
to them to explain why I am here: 
Our Founders recognized the failings of all 
people. So they designed a system to ensure 
that the ideas and principles contained in 
this document would always be greater than 
any one person. It is the idea that no one is 
above the law. But our system only works if 
people stand up and fight for it, and fighting 
for something important always comes with 
a cost. 
Some day you may be called upon to de-
fend the principles and ideas embodied in our 
Constitution. May the memory and spirit of 
those who sacrificed for them in the past 
guide you and give you strength as you fight 
for them in the future. 
Thank you for your time. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Senators, and counsel for the 
President, this is a defining moment in 
our history and a challenging time for 
our Nation. A thousand things have 
gone through my mind since this body 
voted to not call witnesses in this trial. 
The 
vote 
was 
unprecedented.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S787 
February 3, 2020 
President’s former National Security 
Advisor indicated that he was willing 
to testify under oath before the Senate. 
Yet this body did not want to hear 
what he had to say. 
The President’s lawyers have asked 
you to not believe your lying eyes and 
ears, to reinterpret the Constitution, 
and to believe that if the President 
thinks his reelection is in our national 
interest, then he can do whatever he 
wants—anything—to make it happen. 
And that is exactly what he was at-
tempting to do—anything—when he il-
legally held much needed military aid 
while pressuring Ukraine’s President 
to announce bogus investigations into 
his most feared political rival. 
This trial is about abuse of power, 
obstruction, breaking the law, and our 
system of checks and balances, and 
since we are talking about the Presi-
dent of the United States, this trial is 
also most certainly about character. 
I am reminded today, Senators, of 
my own father. He worked more than 
one job. He didn’t have a famous last 
name. His name appeared on no build-
ing, but my father was rich in some-
thing no money and, apparently, no 
powerful position can buy. You see, my 
father was a man who was decent, hon-
est, a man of integrity, and he was a 
man of good, moral character. The 
President’s lawyer never spoke about 
the President’s character during this 
trial, and I find that quite telling. 
I joined the police department be-
cause I wanted to make a difference, 
and I believe I did. As a police chief, I 
was always concerned about the mes-
sage we were sending inside the agen-
cy, especially to young recruits, espe-
cially to newly hired dedicated police 
officers. We had to be careful about 
just how we were defining what was ac-
ceptable and unacceptable behavior in-
side the department and out in the 
community. Yes, people make mis-
takes. Yes, individuals make mistakes. 
But we had to be clear about the cul-
ture inside the organization, and we 
had to send a strong message that the 
police department was not a place 
where corruption could reside, where 
corruption was normalized, and where 
corruption was covered up. 
Today, unfortunately, I believe we 
are holding young police recruits to a 
higher standard than we are the leader 
of the free world. If this body fails to 
hold this President accountable, you 
must ask yourselves: What kind of Re-
public will we ultimately have with a 
President who thinks that he can real-
ly truly do whatever he wants? You 
will send a terrible message to the Na-
tion that one can get away with abuse 
of power, obstruction, cheating, and 
spreading false narratives if you simply 
know the right people. 
Well, today, Senators, I reject that 
because we are a nation of laws. Abra-
ham Lincoln, the 16th President of the 
United States said this: ‘‘America will 
never be destroyed from outside. If we 
falter and lose our freedoms, it will be 
because we chose to destroy our-
selves.’’ 
I urge you, Senators, to vote to con-
vict and remove this President. Thank 
you so much for your time. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, President’s counsel, I men-
tioned on the floor last week that Alex-
ander Hamilton has played a starring 
role during this impeachment trial. 
But Ben Franklin has only made a 
cameo appearance, but that cameo ap-
pearance was an important one, when 
he made the observation, in the after-
math of that convention in 1787, that 
the Framers of the Constitution had 
created ‘‘a Republic, if you can keep 
it.’’ 
Why would Dr. Franklin express am-
biguity about the future of America 
during such a triumphant moment? 
Perhaps it was because the system of 
government that was created at that 
convention—checks and balances, sepa-
rate and coequal branches of govern-
ment, the independent judiciary, the 
free and fair press, the preeminence of 
the rule of law—all of those values, all 
of those ideas, all of those institutions 
have never before been put together in 
one form of government. So perhaps it 
was uncertain as to whether America 
could sustain them. 
But part of the brilliance of our great 
country is that year after year, decade 
after decade, century after century, we 
have held this democracy thing to-
gether. But now all of those ideas, all 
of those values, all of those institu-
tions are under assault, not from with-
out but from within. We created ‘‘a Re-
public, if you can keep it.’’ 
House managers have proven our case 
against President Trump with a moun-
tain of evidence. President Trump tried 
to cheat, he got caught, and then he 
worked hard to cover it up. 
President Trump corruptly abused 
his power. President Trump obstructed 
a congressionally and constitutionally 
required impeachment inquiry with 
blanket defiance. President Trump so-
licited foreign interference in an Amer-
ican election and shredded the very 
fabric of our democracy. House man-
agers have proven our case against 
President Trump with a mountain of 
evidence. 
If the Senate chooses to acquit under 
these circumstances, then America is 
in the wilderness. 
If the Senate chooses to normalize 
lawlessness, if the Senate chooses to 
normalize corruption, if the Senate 
chooses 
to 
normalize 
Presidential 
abuse of power, then America is in the 
wilderness. 
If the Senate chooses to acquit Presi-
dent Trump without issuing a single 
subpoena, without interviewing a sin-
gle witness, without reviewing a single 
new document, then America is truly 
in the wilderness. 
But all is not lost. Even at this late 
hour, the Senate can still do the right 
thing. America is watching. The world 
is watching. The eyes of history are 
watching. The Senate can still do the 
right thing. 
Scripture says—Second Corinthians, 
the fifth chapter and the seventh verse, 
encourages us to walk by faith, not by 
sight. Faith is the substance of things 
hoped for, the evidence of things not 
seen. We have come this far by faith. 
And so I say to all of you, my fellow 
Americans, walk by faith. Democrats 
and Republicans, progressives and con-
servatives, the left and the right, all 
points in between, walk by faith. There 
are patriots all throughout the Cham-
ber, patriots who can be found all 
throughout the land—in urban Amer-
ica, rural America, suburban America, 
smalltown America. Walk by faith. 
Through the ups and the downs, the 
highs and the lows, the peaks and the 
valleys, the trials and the tribulations 
of this turbulent moment, walk by 
faith—faith in the Constitution; faith 
in our democracy; faith in the rule of 
law; faith in government of the people, 
by the people, and for the people; faith 
in almighty God. Walk by faith. 
The Senate can still do the right 
thing. And if we come together as 
Americans, then together we can eradi-
cate the cancer that threatens our de-
mocracy and continue our long, nec-
essary, and majestic march toward a 
more perfect union. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I want to begin by thanking you 
for the distinguished way you have pre-
sided over these proceedings. 
Senators, we are not enemies but 
friends. We must not be enemies. If 
Lincoln could speak these words during 
the Civil War, surely we can live them 
now and overcome our divisions and 
our animosities. 
It is midnight in Washington. The 
lights are finally going out in the Cap-
itol after a long day in the impeach-
ment trial of Donald J. Trump. The 
Senate heard arguments only hours 
earlier on whether to call witnesses 
and require the administration to re-
lease documents it has withheld. Coun-
sel for the President still maintains 
the President’s innocence, while oppos-
ing any additional evidence that would 
prove otherwise. 
It is midnight in Washington, but on 
this night, not all the lights have been 
extinguished. Somewhere in the bowels 
of the Justice Department—Donald 
Trump’s Justice Department—a light 
remains on. Someone has waited until 
the country is asleep to hit ‘‘Send,’’ to 
inform the court in a filing due that 
day that the Justice Department—the 
Department that would represent jus-
tice—is refusing to produce documents 
directly bearing on the President’s de-
cision to withhold military aid from 
Ukraine. The Trump administration 
has them, it is not turning them over, 
and it does not want the Senate to 
know until it is too late. Send. 
That is what happened last Friday 
night. When you left home for the 
weekend, in a replay of the duplicity 
we saw during the trial when the Presi-
dent’s lawyers argued here that the 
House must go to court and argued in 
court that the House must come here,

February 3, 2020 
they were at it again, telling the court 
in a midnight filing that they would 
not turn over relevant documents even 
as they argued here that they were not 
covering up the President’s misdeeds. 
Midnight in Washington. All too 
tragic. A metaphor for where the coun-
try finds itself at the conclusion of 
only the third impeachment in history 
and the first impeachment trial with-
out witnesses or documents, the first 
such trial—or nontrial—in impeach-
ment history. 
How did we get here? In the begin-
ning of this proceeding, you did not 
know whether we could prove our case. 
Many Senators, like many Americans, 
did not have the opportunity to watch 
much, let alone all, of the opening 
hearings in the House during our inves-
tigation, and none of us could antici-
pate what defenses the President might 
offer. 
Now you have seen what we prom-
ised: overwhelming evidence of the 
President’s guilt. Donald John Trump 
withheld hundreds of millions of dol-
lars from an ally at war and a coveted 
White House meeting with their Presi-
dent to coerce or extort that nation’s 
help to cheat in our elections. And 
when he was found out, he engaged in 
the most comprehensive effort to cover 
up his misconduct in the history of 
Presidential impeachment: fighting all 
subpoenas for documents and witnesses 
and using his own obstruction as a 
sword and a shield; arguing here that 
the House did not fight hard enough to 
overcome their noninvocation of privi-
lege in court, and in court that the 
House must not be heard to enforce 
their subpoenas but that impeachment 
is a proper remedy. 
Having failed to persuade the Senate 
or the public that there was no quid 
pro quo, having offered no evidence to 
contradict the record, the President’s 
team opted, in a kind of desperation, 
for a different kind of defense: first, 
prevent the Senate and the public from 
hearing from witnesses with the most 
damning accounts of the President’s 
misconduct, and second, fall back on a 
theory of Presidential power so broad 
and unaccountable that it would allow 
any occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania to 
be as corrupt as he chooses, while the 
Congress is powerless to do anything 
about it. That defense collapsed of its 
own dead weight. 
Presidents may abuse their power 
with impunity, they argued. Abuse of 
power is not a constitutional crime, 
they claimed. Only statutory crime is a 
constitutional 
crime, 
even 
though 
there were no statutory crimes when 
the Constitution was adopted. The 
President had to look far and wide to 
find a defense lawyer to make such an 
argument, unsupported by history, the 
Founders, or common sense. The Re-
publican expert witness in the House 
would not make it. Serious constitu-
tional scholars would not make it. 
Even Alan Dershowitz would not make 
it—at least he wouldn’t in 1998. But 
this has become the President’s de-
fense. Yet this defense proved indefen-
sible. 
If abuse of power is not impeach-
able—even though it is clear the 
Founders considered it the highest of 
all high crimes and misdemeanors—but 
if it is not impeachable, then a whole 
range of utterly unacceptable conduct 
of the President’s would now be beyond 
reach. Trump could offer Alaska to the 
Russians in exchange for support in the 
next election or decide to move to Mar- 
a-Lago permanently and let Jared 
Kushner run the country, delegating to 
him the decision whether to go to war. 
Because those things are not nec-
essarily criminal, this argument would 
allow that he could not be impeached 
for such abuses of power. 
Of course, this would be absurd— 
more than absurd, it would be dan-
gerous. So Mr. Dershowitz tried to em-
bellish his legal creation and distin-
guish among those abuses of power 
which would be impeachable from 
those which wouldn’t. Abuses of power 
that would help the President get 
elected were permissible and therefore 
unimpeachable, and only those for pe-
cuniary gain were beyond the pale. 
Under this theory, as long as the Presi-
dent believed his reelection was in the 
public interest, he could do anything, 
and no quid pro quo was too corrupt, no 
damage to our national security too 
great. This was such an extreme view 
that even the President’s other lawyers 
had to run away from it. 
So what are we left with? The House 
has proven the President’s guilt. He 
tried to coerce an ally into helping him 
cheat by smearing his opponent. He be-
trayed our national security in order 
to do it when he withheld military aid 
to our ally and violated the law to do 
so. He covered it up, and he covers it 
up still. His continuing obstruction is a 
threat to the oversight and investiga-
tory powers of the House and Senate 
and, if left unaddressed, would perma-
nently and dangerously alter the bal-
ance of power. 
These undeniable facts require the 
President to retreat to his final de-
fense. He is guilty as sin, but can’t we 
just let the voters decide? He is guilty 
as sin, but why not let the voters clean 
up this mess? And here, to answer that 
question, we must look at the history 
of this Presidency and to the character 
of this President—or lack of char-
acter—and ask, can we be confident 
that he will not continue to try to 
cheat in that very election? Can we be 
confident that Americans and not for-
eign powers will get to decide and that 
the President will shun any further for-
eign interference in our democratic af-
fairs? And the short, plain, sad, incon-
testable answer is, no, you can’t. You 
can’t trust this President to do the 
right thing, not for one minute, not for 
one election, not for the sake of our 
country. You just can’t. He will not 
change, and you know it. 
In 2016, he invited foreign inter-
ference in our election. Hey, Russia, if 
you 
are 
listening, 
hack 
Hillary’s 
emails, he said, and they did, imme-
diately. And when the Russians start-
ing dumping them before the election, 
he made use of them in every conceiv-
able way, touting the filthy lucre at 
campaign stops more than 100 times. 
When he was investigated, he did ev-
erything he could to obstruct justice, 
going so far as to fire the FBI Director 
and try to fire the special counsel and 
ask the White House Counsel to lie on 
his behalf. 
During the same campaign, while 
telling the country he had no business 
dealings with Russia, he was con-
tinuing to actively pursue the most lu-
crative deal of his life—a Trump Tower 
in the heart of Moscow. Six close asso-
ciates of the President’s would be in-
dicted or go to jail in connection with 
the President’s campaign, Russia, and 
the effort to cover it up. 
On the day after that tragic chapter 
appeared to come to an end with Bob 
Mueller’s testimony, Donald Trump 
was back on the phone, this time with 
another foreign power—Ukraine—and 
once again seeking foreign help with 
his election, only this time, he had the 
full powers of the Presidency at his dis-
posal. This time, he could use coercion. 
This time, he could withhold aid from 
a nation whose soldiers were dying 
every week. This time, he believed he 
could do whatever he wanted under ar-
ticle II. And this time, when he was 
caught, he could make sure that the 
Justice Department would never inves-
tigate the matter, and they didn’t. 
Donald Trump had no more Jeff Ses-
sions; he had just the man he wanted in 
Bill Barr, a man whose view of the im-
perial 
Presidency—a 
Presidency 
in 
which the Department of Justice is lit-
tle more than an extension of the 
White House Counsel—is to do the 
President’s bidding. So Congress had to 
do the investigation itself, and just as 
before, he obstructed that investiga-
tion in every way. 
He has not changed. He will not 
change. He has made that clear himself 
without self-awareness or hesitation. A 
man without character or ethical com-
pass will never find his way. 
Even as the most recent and most 
egregious misconduct was discovered, 
he was unapologetic, unrepentant, and 
more dangerous, undeterred. He contin-
ued pressing Ukraine to smear his ri-
vals even as the investigation was un-
derway. 
He invited new countries to get in-
volved in the act, calling on China to 
do the same. His personal emissary, 
Rudy Giuliani, dispatched himself to 
Ukraine, trying to get further foreign 
interference in our election. The plot 
goes on; the scheming persists; and the 
danger will never recede. He has done 
it before. He will do it again. What are 
the odds, if left in office, that he will 
continue trying to cheat? I will tell 
you: 100 percent. Not 5, not 10 or even 
50, but 100 percent. 
If you have found him guilty and you 
do not remove him from office, he will 
continue trying to cheat in the elec-
tion until he succeeds. Then what shall

you say? What shall you say if Russia 
again interferes in our election and 
Donald Trump does nothing but cele-
brates their efforts? What shall you say 
if Ukraine capitulates and announces 
investigations into the President’s ri-
vals? 
What shall you say in the future, 
when candidates compete for the alle-
giance of foreign powers in their elec-
tions, when they draft their platforms 
so to encourage foreign intervention in 
their campaign? Foreign nations, as 
the most super of super-PACs of them 
all, if not legal, somehow permissible 
because Donald Trump has made it so 
and we refused to do anything about it 
but wring our hands. 
They 
will 
hack 
your 
opponents’ 
emails; they will mount a social media 
campaign to support you; they will an-
nounce investigations of your opponent 
to help you—and all for the asking. 
Leave Donald Trump in office after you 
have found him guilty, and this is the 
future that you will invite. 
Now, we have known since the day we 
brought these charges that the bar to 
conviction, requiring fully two-thirds 
of the Senate, may be prohibitively 
high. And yet, the alternative is a run-
away Presidency and a nation whose 
elections are open to the highest bid-
der. 
So you might ask how—given the 
gravity of the President’s misconduct, 
given the abundance of evidence of his 
guilt, given the acknowledgement by 
Senators in both parties of that guilt— 
how have we arrived here with so little 
common ground? Why was the Nixon 
impeachment bipartisan? Why was the 
Clinton impeachment much less so? 
And why is the gulf between the par-
ties even greater today? 
It is not for the reason that the 
President’s lawyers would have you be-
lieve. Although they have claimed 
many times, in many ways, that the 
process in the House was flawed be-
cause we did not allow the President to 
control it, it was, in reality, little dif-
ferent than the process in prior im-
peachments. 
The 
circumstances, 
of 
course, were different. The Watergate 
investigation began in the Senate and 
had progressed before it got moving in 
the House. And there, of course, much 
of the investigative work had been 
done by the special prosecutor, Leon 
Jaworski. In Clinton, there was like-
wise an independent counsel who con-
ducted a multiyear investigation that 
started with a real estate deal in Ar-
kansas and ended with a blue dress. 
Nixon and Clinton, of course, played 
no role in those investigations before 
they moved to the House Judiciary 
Committee. But to the degree you can 
compare the process when it got to the 
Judiciary Committee in either prior 
and recent impeachments, it was large-
ly the same as we have here. The Presi-
dent had the right to call witnesses, to 
ask questions, and chose not to. 
The House majorities in Nixon and 
Clinton did not cede their subpoena 
power to their minorities, and neither 
did we here, although then, as now, we 
gave the minority the right to request 
subpoenas and to compel a vote, and 
they did. 
So the due process the House pro-
vided here was essentially the same 
and, in some ways, even greater. Never-
theless, the President’s counsel hopes 
that, through sheer repetition, they 
can convert nontruth into truth. Do 
not let them. 
Every single court to hear Mr. 
Philbin’s arguments has rejected them: 
The subpoenas are invalid—rejected 
by the McGahn court. 
They have absolute immunity—re-
jected by the McGahn court. 
Privilege 
may 
conceal 
crime 
or 
fraud—rejected by the court in Nixon. 
But if the process here was substan-
tially the same, the facts of the Presi-
dent’s misconduct were very different 
from one impeachment to the next. 
The Republican Party of Nixon’s time 
broke into the DNC, and the President 
covered it up. Nixon, too, abused the 
power of his office to gain an unfair ad-
vantage over his opponent, but in Wa-
tergate he never sought to coerce a for-
eign power to aid his reelection, nor 
did he sacrifice our national security in 
such a palpable and destructive way as 
withholding aid from an ally at war. 
And he certainly did not engage in the 
wholesale obstruction of Congress or 
justice that we have seen this Presi-
dent commit. 
The facts of President Clinton’s mis-
conduct pale in comparison to Nixon 
and do not hold a candle to Donald 
Trump. Lying about an affair is mor-
ally wrong, and when under oath it is a 
crime, but it had nothing to do with 
his duties in office. 
The process being the same, the facts 
of President Trump’s misconduct being 
far more destructive than either past 
President, what then accounts for the 
disparate result in bipartisan support 
for his removal? What has changed? 
The 
short 
answer 
is, 
we 
have 
changed. The Members of Congress 
have changed. For reasons as varied as 
the stars, the Members of this body and 
ours in the House are now far more ac-
cepting of the most serious misconduct 
of a President as long as it is a Presi-
dent of one’s own party. And that is a 
trend most dangerous for our country. 
Fifty years ago, no lawyer rep-
resenting the President would have 
ever made the outlandish argument 
that if the President believes his cor-
ruption will serve to get him reelected, 
whether it is by coercing an ally to 
help him cheat or in any other form, 
that he may not be impeached, that 
this is somehow a permissible use of 
his power. 
But here we are. The argument has 
been made, and some appear ready to 
accept it. And that is dangerous, for 
there is no limiting principle to that 
position. 
It must have come as a shock—a 
pleasant shock—to this President that 
our norms and institutions would prove 
to be so weak. The independence of the 
Justice Department and its formerly 
proud Office of Legal Counsel now are 
mere legal tools at the President’s dis-
posal to investigate enemies or churn 
out helpful opinions not worth the 
paper they are written on. The FBI 
painted by a President as corrupt and 
disloyal. The intelligence community 
not to be trusted against the good 
counsel of Vladimir Putin. The press 
portrayed as enemies of the people. The 
daily attacks on the guardrails of our 
democracy, so relentlessly assailed, 
have made us numb and blind to the 
consequences. 
Does none of that matter anymore if 
he is the President of our party? 
I hope and pray that we never have a 
President like Donald Trump in the 
Democratic Party, one who would be-
tray the national interest and the 
country’s security to help with his re-
election. And I would hope to God that, 
if we did, we would impeach him, and 
Democrats would lead the way. 
But I suppose you never know just 
how difficult that is until you are con-
fronted with it. But you, my friends, 
are confronted with it. You are con-
fronted with that difficulty now, and 
you must not shrink from it. 
History will not be kind to Donald 
Trump—I think we all know that—not 
because it will be written by Never 
Trumpers but because whenever we 
have departed from the values of our 
Nation, we have come to regret it, and 
that regret is written all over the 
pages of our history. 
If you find that the House has proved 
its case and still vote to acquit, your 
name will be tied to his with a chord of 
steel and for all of history; but if you 
find the courage to stand up to him, to 
speak the awful truth to his rank false-
hood, your place will be among the Da-
vids who took on Goliath. If only you 
will say ‘‘enough.’’ 
We revere the wisdom of our Found-
ers and the insights they had into self- 
governance. We scour their words for 
hidden meaning and try to place our-
selves in their shoes. But we have one 
advantage that the Founders did not. 
For all their genius, they could not see 
but opaquely into the future. We, on 
the other hand, have the advantage of 
time, of seeing how their great experi-
ment 
in 
self-governance 
has 
pro-
gressed. 
When we look at the sweep of his-
tory, there are times when our Nation 
and the rest of the world have moved 
with a seemingly irresistible force in 
the direction of greater freedom: more 
freedom to speak and to assemble, to 
practice our faith and tolerate the 
faith of others, to love whom we would 
and choose love over hate—more free 
societies, walls tumbling down, nations 
reborn. 
But then, like a pendulum approach-
ing the end of its arc, the outward 
movement begins to arrest. The golden 
globe of freedom reaches its zenith and 
starts to retreat. The pendulum swings 
back past the center and recedes into a 
dark unknown. How much farther will

it travel in its illiberal direction, how 
many more freedoms will be extin-
guished before it turns back we cannot 
say. But what we do here, in this mo-
ment, will affect its course and its cor-
rection. 
Every single vote, even a single vote 
by a single Member, can change the 
course of history. It is said that a sin-
gle man or a woman of courage makes 
a majority. Is there one among you 
who will say ‘‘enough’’? 
America believes in a thing called 
truth. She does not believe we are enti-
tled to our own alternate facts. She 
recoils at those who spread pernicious 
falsehoods. To her, truth matters. 
There is nothing more corrosive to a 
democracy than the idea that there is 
no truth. 
America also believes there is a dif-
ference between right and wrong, and 
right matters here. But there is more. 
Truth matters. Right matters. But so 
does decency. Decency matters. 
When the President smears a patri-
otic 
public 
servant 
like 
Marie 
Yovanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt 
aim, we recoil. When the President 
mocks the disabled, a war hero who 
was a prisoner of war, or a Gold Star 
father, we are appalled because de-
cency matters here. And when the 
President tries to coerce an ally to 
help him cheat in our elections and 
then 
covers 
it 
up, 
we 
must 
say 
‘‘enough.’’ Enough. 
He has betrayed our national secu-
rity, and he will do so again. He has 
compromised our elections, and he will 
do so again. You will not change him. 
You cannot constrain him. He is who 
he is. Truth matters little to him. 
What is right matters even less. And 
decency matters not at all. 
I do not ask you to convict him be-
cause truth or right or decency mat-
ters nothing to him but because we 
have proven our case and it matters to 
you. Truth matters to you. Right mat-
ters to you. You are decent. He is not 
who you are. 
In Federalist 55, James Madison 
wrote that there were certain qualities 
in human nature—qualities I believe, 
like honesty, right, and decency— 
which should justify our confidence in 
self-government. He believed that we 
possessed sufficient virtue that the 
chains of despotism were not necessary 
to restrain ourselves ‘‘from destroying 
and devouring one another.’’ 
It may be midnight in Washington, 
but the sun will rise again. I put my 
faith in the optimism of the Founders. 
You should too. They gave us the tools 
to do the job, a remedy as powerful as 
the evil it was meant to constrain: im-
peachment. They meant it to be used 
rarely, but they put it in the Constitu-
tion for a reason—for a man who would 
sell out his country for a political 
favor, for a man who would threaten 
the integrity of our elections, for a 
man who would invite foreign inter-
ference in our affairs, for a man who 
would undermine our national security 
and that of our allies—for a man like 
Donald J. Trump. 
They gave you a remedy, and they 
meant for you to use it. They gave you 
an oath, and they meant for you to ob-
serve it. We have proven Donald Trump 
guilty. Now do impartial justice and 
convict him.

f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, and 
all of my colleagues in the Senate, 
throughout this impeachment trial, I 
thought a lot about what this country 
stands for. For me, as the son of an im-
migrant whose family came to the 
United States from Germany in the 
1930s, America stands as a beacon of 
liberty, equal justice, and democracy. 
We are a nation forged by a revolu-
tion against a monarchy and its abso-
lute power. We are a nation founded by 
the ratification of the most radically 
democratic document in history, the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America. 
Under the Constitution, we are gov-
erned not by monarchs—who act with 
impunity and without accountability— 
but by elected officers who answer to, 
and work for, ‘‘We the People.’’ 
Generations 
of 
Americans 
have 
struggled and sacrificed their lives to 
defend that audacious vision. The Sen-
ate has a duty and a moral responsi-
bility to uphold that vision. 
Over the last 2 weeks, I fear that the 
Senate has failed in that duty. I am 
deeply disappointed that nearly all of 
my Republican colleagues refused to 
allow for the kind of witness testimony 
and documentary evidence that any le-
gitimate trial would include. You can-
not conduct a fair trial without wit-
nesses. 
In my view, you also can’t have a le-
gitimate acquittal without a fair trial; 
that the Senate refused to shed more 
light on the facts is truly astonishing. 
Despite this, the facts as we know 
them are clear and plain. President 
Trump pressured the Government of 
Ukraine, an American ally, not for our 
national security interests but for his 
own selfish and corrupt political inter-
ests. When he was caught, he sought to 
cover it up by suppressing documents 
and preventing witnesses from testi-
fying before Congress and the Amer-
ican people. 
The President’s defense team had 
every opportunity to present us with 
evidence that would explain his actions 
or give us reason to doubt this clear 
pattern of fact. Instead, they shifted 
their defense away from the damning 
facts and embraced an extreme legal 
philosophy that would allow any Presi-
dent to abuse their power and ignore 
the law. 
This dangerous argument is not new. 
It was used by President Richard Nixon 
when he said: ‘‘Well, when the presi-
dent does it, that means it is not ille-
gal.’’ 
President Nixon also strayed far from 
his duties to our Nation for his own 
personal and political gain. It was only 
after courageous Members of the U.S. 
Senate, in his own political party, put 
their country first and stood up to him 
that President Nixon finally resigned. 
We are now in yet another time when 
our Chief Executive has failed us, and 
our Nation requires more leadership 
and conscience from the U.S. Senate. 
Unfortunately, 
my 
Republican 
col-
leagues are unwilling to deliver that 
kind of moral leadership. 
President Donald Trump has proven 
to be unfit for the office he occupies. 
He abused his powers and continues to 
engage in a coverup. He presents a 
clear and present danger to our na-
tional security and, more fundamen-
tally, to our democracy itself. 
That is why my conscience and my 
duty to defend our Constitution compel 
me to vote to convict Donald Trump. I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S791 
February 3, 2020 
hope the rest of you will join in this 
vote, but I am not naive. I understand 
how President Trump operates. I know 
how ugly it can become if you dare to 
challenge him. But your fear of this 
bully cannot outweigh your duty to the 
American people. Your fear cannot 
blind you to how you will be viewed by 
history. What you should really fear is 
what will happen when there are no 
limits on any President, even when he 
is risking our national security and our 
foreign 
alliances 
to 
illegitimately 
maintain his grip on power. 
What we should all fear is what 
President Trump will do next if the 
Senate does not hold him accountable 
for the clear abuses of power he has al-
ready committed. This is the same 
President who praises dictators and 
despots and jeopardizes our inter-
national alliances. This is the same 
President who stole billions of dollars 
from military construction funds to 
pay for his monument to division and 
racism. This is the same President who 
is more focused on lobbing insults and 
spreading Russian conspiracy theories 
on Twitter than he is on his own intel-
ligence briefings. 
Let me just say that I pay close at-
tention to the intelligence that I am 
allowed to see, and from my seat on 
both the Armed Services and Intel-
ligence Committees, I am acutely 
aware of the threats that our Nation 
faces. They include an emboldened 
North Korea, the Iranian regime, and 
terrorist organizations across several 
continents. 
Russia and China are acting aggres-
sively to assert their authoritarian in-
fluence and provoke American inter-
ests and our allies, including the 
Ukraine. Finally, with the 2020 Presi-
dential election mere months away, 
Russia is once again targeting our elec-
tion systems and manipulating our 
democratic discourse. 
Right 
now, 
patriotic 
Americans 
working in the State Department, for 
our intelligence agencies, and serving 
in the military are defending us from 
those very threats. These Americans 
pledge to obey the orders of their Com-
mander in Chief. They trust that their 
Commander in Chief’s loyalty and sole 
focus is squarely on the best interests 
of the United States of America. I 
don’t say this lightly: President Trump 
has betrayed that trust. He promised 
us that he would put America first. In-
stead, he put himself first. 
Throughout our history, the defense 
of our Nation has depended on the lead-
ership of men whose names we now re-
member when we visit their memo-
rials, names like Lincoln and Wash-
ington and Roosevelt. These men all 
swore the same oath that President 
Trump did when they assumed our Na-
tion’s most powerful office. Our Presi-
dents swear to ‘‘faithfully execute the 
Office of President of the United 
States’’ and to ‘‘preserve, protect, and 
defend the Constitution of the United 
States.’’ President Trump has violated 
that oath. 
So I will ask us once again, what 
does America stand for? In considering 
that question, I think of Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr.—the only man who 
did not serve as President whom we 
recognize with a memorial on our Na-
tional Mall. More than 50 years after 
his assassination, Dr. King’s life’s work 
to make our Nation more fully live up 
to our founding principles still reso-
nates. These are the same principles 
that compelled my father’s family to 
come to this country: liberty, equal 
justice, democracy. 
While fighting for those principles, 
Dr. King wrote in his letter from a Bir-
mingham jail: ‘‘The ultimate measure 
of a man is not where he stands in mo-
ments of comfort and convenience, but 
where he stands in times of challenge 
and controversy.’’ My colleagues, this 
is one of those times. 
Two years after writing the Bir-
mingham Jail letter, Dr. King led thou-
sands on a 5-day, 54-mile march from 
Selma to Montgomery for our funda-
mental American right: the right to 
vote in free and fair elections. Remem-
ber, that right is what President 
Trump has threatened by inviting for-
eign interference in our elections. Upon 
reaching the steps of the Alabama 
State Capitol, Dr. King proclaimed: 
‘‘We must come to see that the end we 
seek is a society at peace with itself, a 
society that can live with its con-
science.’’ I sincerely hope that those of 
us in this body can keep seeking that 
society, that America. 
Before I finish, I also want to address 
Americans who have watched this trial 
unfold and are rightly disappointed by 
the coverup that it has become. I would 
urge you to remember what Dr. King 
said about accepting finite disappoint-
ment but never losing infinite hope. 
Despite what the Senate is about to do 
and the danger I fear it will bring 
about, I will never lose hope in what 
America stands for because we the peo-
ple—not any King or dictator—still 
hold immense power in this Nation, 
and it is up to all of us now to wield 
that power. 
I yield back.

ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as 
Senators, we cast many votes during 
our time here. I have cast over 13,200. 
Each one of those votes is important, 
but a vote to convict or acquit the 
President on charges of impeachment 
is perhaps the most important vote a 
Senator could ever cast. Until now, it 
has happened only twice in our Na-
tion’s history, and it is something that 
should never be taken lightly. 
President Trump has been charged of 
committing, according to the Constitu-
tion and in these articles, ‘‘high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’ for requesting that 
a foreign leader investigate his poten-
tial political opponent and, No. 2, ob-
structing Congress’s inquiry into those 
actions. For this, we are asked to per-
manently remove him from office. 
As a judge and juror, as we all are, I 
first ask whether the charges rise to an 
offense that unquestionably demands 
removal from office. If so, I then ask 
whether the House proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt that it actually oc-
curred. 
The House’s case fails on the first of 
those questions. The President’s re-
quest is not impeachable conduct under 
our Constitution. A President isn’t pro-
hibited by law from engaging the as-
sistance of a foreign ally in an anti- 
corruption investigation. 
The House tries to make up for this 
hurdle by suggesting that subjective 
motive—in other words, political ad-
vantage—can turn an otherwise unim-
peachable act into an act that demands 
removal from office. I won’t support 
such an irreversible break from the 
Constitution standard for impeaching a 
President. 
The Senate is an institution of prece-
dent. We are informed and guided by 
history and the actions of our prede-
cessors, but our choices also actually 
make history. These days, that can be 
difficult to keep in mind. A rush to 
convict or acquit can lead to cut cor-
ners and overheated rhetoric. 
We are each bound by our oath to ‘‘do 
impartial justice.’’ As President pro 
tempore of this institution, I recognize 
that we must also do justice to the 
Senate and to the Republic that this 
Senate serves. 
This trial began with a full and fair 
debate on the rules to guide our proc-
ess. We considered and voted on 11 
amendments over nearly 13 hours. Con-
sistent with precedent, the Senate 
adopted rules allowing the same length 
of time for arguments and questions as 
was agreed to unanimously in the 1999 
Clinton impeachment. Consistent with 
precedent, we engaged in a robust de-
bate on calling witnesses and pursuing 
additional evidence. We sat as a Court 
of Impeachment for over 70 hours. The 
final vote will be the product of a fair 
and judicial process consistent with 
precedent of the Senate. 
I cannot say the same of the Articles 
of Impeachment that we are consid-
ering today from the House of Rep-
resentatives, which has the sole power 
of impeachment. After 9 days of presen-
tation and questions and after fully 
considering the record, I am convinced 
that what the House is asking the Sen-
ate to do is constitutionally flawed and 
dangerously unprecedented. 
The House’s abuse of power article 
rests on objectively legal conduct. 
Until Congress legislates otherwise, a 
President is within his authority to re-
quest that a foreign leader assist with 
anti-corruption efforts. To make up for 
this, the House of Representatives’ 
abuse of power theory rests entirely on 
the President’s subjective motive. This 
very vague standard cannot be sus-
tained. 
The House offers no limiting prin-
ciple of what motives are allowed. 
Under such a flexible standard, future 
House of Representatives could im-
peach Presidents for taking lawful ac-
tion for what a majority thinks are the 
wrong reasons.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S792 
February 3, 2020 
The House also gives no guidance 
whatsoever 
on 
whether 
conviction 
rests on proving a single, corrupt mo-
tive or whether mixed motives suffice 
under their theory. In its trial brief, 
the House of Representatives argues 
that there is ‘‘no credible alternative 
explanation’’—those are their words— 
for the President’s alleged conduct, but 
once the Senate heard from the Presi-
dent’s counsel in defense, then all of a 
sudden, the House changed its tune. 
Now, even a credible alternative expla-
nation shouldn’t stop the Senate from 
removing the President. 
Reshaping 
their 
own 
standard 
midtrial only serves to undercut their 
initial arguments. And simply assert-
ing—at least 63 times that I counted— 
that 
their 
evidence 
was 
‘‘over-
whelming’’ doesn’t make the House of 
Representatives’ allegations accurate 
or prove an impeachable offense. Even 
after arguments had concluded, the 
House managers started repeating the 
terms ‘‘bribery’’ and ‘‘extortion’’ on 
the floor of the Senate, while neither 
term appears anywhere in their Arti-
cles of Impeachment. 
So you get down to this point. It is 
not the Senate’s job to read into House 
articles what the House failed or didn’t 
see fit to incorporate itself. Articles of 
Impeachment shouldn’t be moving tar-
gets like moving a goalpost. The ambi-
guity surrounding the House’s abuse of 
power theory gives this Senator reason 
enough to vote not guilty. If we are to 
lower the bar of impeachment—and 
that is what the House of Representa-
tives is trying to do—we better be clear 
on where the bar is being set. 
The House’s second article impeach-
ing the President for what they call ob-
struction of Congress is equally un-
precedented and equally patently frivo-
lous. This Senator takes great pride in 
knowing a thing or two about obstruc-
tion by the executive branch from both 
Republican Presidents and Democratic 
Presidents in the 40 years that I have 
been doing oversight. Congressional 
oversight—like 
rooting 
out 
waste, 
fraud, and abuse—is central to my role 
as a Senator representing Iowa tax-
payers. In the face of obstruction, I use 
the tools the Constitution provides to 
this institution. Now, that is the very 
core of the checks and balances of our 
governmental system. 
For example, I fought the Obama ad-
ministration to obtain documents re-
lated to Operation Fast and Furious. 
Under the House’s obstruction stand-
ard, should President Obama have been 
impeached for his failure to waive 
privileges during the course of that in-
vestigation? 
We 
fought 
President 
Obama on this for 3 years in the courts, 
and we still didn’t end up with all that 
we asked for. We never heard a peep 
from 
the 
Democrats 
when 
Obama 
pulled that trick. 
The hypocrisy here by the House 
Democrats has been on full display for 
the last 2 weeks. In the case before us, 
the House issued a series of requests 
and subpoenas to the executive branch, 
but the House failed to enforce those 
requests. When challenged to stand up 
for its subpoenas in court, the inves-
tigating committee simply retreated. 
The House may cower at defending 
its own authority, but the Senate 
shouldn’t have to clean up the mess of 
the House’s own making. For the many 
ways in which the House failed in the 
fundamentals of oversight and for the 
terrible new precedent this obstruction 
article would set, I will vote not guilty. 
Another point: There has been debate 
about the whistleblower, whose com-
plaint motivated the House’s impeach-
ment inquiry. I have worked for and 
with whistleblowers for more than 30 
years. I have sponsored numerous laws 
to strengthen whistleblower protec-
tions. Attempts by anyone to ‘‘out’’ a 
whistleblower just to sell an article or 
to score a political point are not help-
ful at all. It is not the treatment any 
whistleblower deserves. However, it is 
important for investigators to talk to 
whistleblowers and to evaluate their 
claims and credibility because those 
claims form the basis of an inquiry 
under checks and balances of govern-
ment. 
My office does this all the time. 
When whistleblowers bring significant 
cases of bipartisan interest, we fre-
quently work closely with the Demo-
crats to look into those claims. I know 
the House committees have followed 
that course in the past. Both parties 
understand how to talk to whistle-
blowers and respect confidentiality. 
Why no efforts were taken in this 
case to take these very basic, bipar-
tisan steps is very baffling to me. I fear 
that, to achieve its desired goal, the 
House majority weaponized and politi-
cized whistleblowers for purely par-
tisan purposes. I hope that the damage 
done will be short-lived. Otherwise, the 
separation of powers under our Con-
stitution will be weakened. 
Finally, I have always made it a pri-
ority to hold judicial nominees to a 
standard of restraint and fidelity to 
the law, and as judges in this case, 
which every Senator is, we should con-
sider those factors which counsel re-
straint. 
These articles came to the Senate as 
a product of a flawed, unprecedented, 
and partisan process. When the articles 
were voted on by the full House, the 
only bipartisanship was of those in op-
position. Moreover, tonight, the Iowa 
caucuses will be finished. The 2020 
Presidential election is underway. Yet 
we are all asked to remove the incum-
bent from the ballot based on an im-
peachment that is supported by only 
one party of the Congress. 
The Senate should take no part in 
endorsing the very dangerous new 
precedent that this would set for future 
impeachments. We need no new normal 
when it comes to impeaching a Presi-
dent. We have precedents of the past 
that should be followed, and they have 
not been followed. We have had more 
than 28,000 pages of evidence. We have 
had 17 witnesses and over 70 hours of 
open, transparent consideration by the 
Senate. The American people are more 
than adequately prepared to decide for 
themselves the fate of the President in 
November. This decision belongs to the 
voters. It is time to get the Senate 
back to work for the American people 
on issues of substance. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have 
been in the Senate now for two Presi-
dential impeachment trials, and I can 
tell you that this is never a situation I 
want to find our country in—not back 
then and certainly not today—when 
the odds of bipartisan cooperation, 
even on responsibilities as solemn as 
these, are brutally low. 
In spite of this, I called for impeach-
ment proceedings to begin in the House 
in July of this past year, and I did so 
because of the gravity of the threats to 
our democracy that has been outlined 
in Mueller’s report. At the time, I felt, 
if we did not fully explore those 
threats, we would fall short of our con-
stitutional duty and set a precedent of 
congressional indifference to poten-
tially flagrant violations of our Con-
stitution—ones that could jeopardize 
our core democratic institutions. 
After hearing both sides’ presen-
tations and after reviewing every avail-
able source of information and testi-
mony, I believe it is painfully clear 
that the President of the United States 
has abused his power and obstructed 
Congress and that he should be re-
moved from office. 
I want to talk about how I reached 
this conclusion, which I did not do 
lightly, and take a few minutes to re-
flect on the consequence of the deci-
sion each of us is individually about to 
make. 
Throughout the trial, the contrast 
between 
the 
presentations 
by 
the 
House managers and the President’s 
defense team could not have been 
starker or more damning for the Presi-
dent. 
The House managers built an iron-
clad case that shows the President 
abused his power and obstructed Con-
gress in ways that present grave, ur-
gent threats to our national security 
and to the rule of law. Over the course 
of their arguments, it became undeni-
ably clear: The corruption we have 
learned so much about in recent 
months starts at the very top—with 
the President of the United States. 
President Trump demanded a foreign 
government to intervene in our elec-
tions for his own political gain, and he 
did so by withholding American tax-
payer dollars and by ignoring congres-
sional authority. The President’s asso-
ciates acted with his full knowledge 
and consent, and he himself pressured 
Ukraine’s leader, knowing how much 
Ukraine depended on United States 
support. These actions have already 
made us less secure as a nation. By de-
laying vital military aid to Ukraine—a 
key 
partner—President 
Trump 
has

February 3, 2020 
emboldened Russia, one of our chief ad-
versaries, and he has undermined our 
credibility with other allies worldwide. 
Critically, the President has also 
given every indication he will continue 
to put his own interests ahead of Amer-
ican interests, including in our upcom-
ing elections, and he has, time and 
again, refused to recognize Congress’s 
constitutional authority to oversee the 
executive branch. In addition, informa-
tion continues to come out that fur-
ther implicates the President and dem-
onstrates not only his intent to abuse 
the power of our highest office but his 
direct personal engagement and efforts 
to do so. 
To summarize, the House’s argu-
ments made it impossible to ignore a 
reality our Founders deeply feared—a 
President who betrays our national se-
curity for his own personal benefit and 
disregards the system of checks and 
balances on which our democratic in-
stitutions depend, who believes he is 
above the law—contrary to the most 
fundamental American principles. 
The President’s defense did not di-
rectly refute those charges against the 
President or the thorough case that 
the House presented. In fact, the Presi-
dent’s defense only served to illustrate 
how indefensible the President’s ac-
tions were. We heard complaints from 
the 
President’s 
defense 
about 
the 
House’s process, which the President 
refused to engage in. 
We heard a debunked conspiracy the-
ory about Ukrainian election inter-
ference even though the President’s 
own advisers repeatedly explained to 
him that Russia, not Ukraine, inter-
fered in our 2016 election. 
We heard the denial of a quid pro quo 
that, as the House managers laid out in 
excruciating detail, was borne out not 
only on the President’s July 25 call 
with President Zelensky but in hun-
dreds of documents from before and 
after that call. 
We did not, however, hear any sub-
stantive defense of the President’s ac-
tions. Tellingly, the President’s de-
fense vehemently opposed common-
sense requests for the President’s own 
key aides to testify and for the consid-
eration of his aides’ documents as part 
of this trial. 
If the President were as innocent as 
he claims, surely, his aides and his ad-
ministration’s materials would bear 
those claims out, and he would want 
them considered. He and his team do 
not. 
In 1999, I said that, if we were to re-
move a sitting President, none of us 
should have any doubts. Based on the 
facts we have heard today and the dis-
traction and obfuscation that has been 
offered in response, none of us should 
have any doubts that the President 
committed the impeachable offenses of 
which he is accused. 
What we now know is the President 
of the United States demanded that a 
foreign government interfere in our 
elections to help him win his upcoming 
campaign. That truth is indisputable. 
The question is, What does each of us 
as an individual do with that informa-
tion? 
In sitting here, I have been reminded 
that this trial is so much larger than 
any one of us—larger than any polit-
ical party and much larger than Presi-
dent Trump. It is fundamentally about 
whether we will stand up for the insti-
tutions that secure our autonomy as a 
people—institutions we hope to leave 
stronger for our children and grand-
children. 
To go a step further, really, this trial 
is about freedom in our country be-
cause, if the President feels he owes his 
office to a foreign government, not to 
Americans, then whom does the Presi-
dent truly serve? How can he be trust-
ed? If foreign governments can skew 
our elections in their favor, if they 
interfere with Americans at the ballot 
box this November, then are Americans 
truly represented in the White House? 
Is there any American who is really 
free if a President can owe his election 
to an entity outside and aside from the 
American people and if foreign govern-
ments can help to decide who is in our 
highest office? 
These questions and their chilling 
answers have led me to my final deci-
sion, and I hope others consider them 
carefully as they make their own. 
I also want to speak for a minute 
about fear. There are really two dif-
ferent kinds at work in this moment. 
One is the fear of political con-
sequences. 
I 
remember 
how 
many 
Members of Congress felt compelled to 
vote for the war in Iraq. The political 
pressure was palpable. That kind of po-
litical fear is palpable again today, but 
fear of political consequences must 
never supersede concern for our coun-
try, and we should be fearful for our 
country today. 
We should be fearful for our future, 
for our safety, and the rule of law if the 
evidence we have heard cannot per-
suade this body to act on the painful 
truth before us. Our President has be-
trayed the public trust, flagrantly vio-
lated our laws, and proved himself a 
threat to our national security. So I 
ask my colleagues how they want to 
feel not in this moment here today but 
in the years ahead and as part of our 
Nation’s history as more information 
continues to come out about this ad-
ministration—and it will—as we get 
closer to an election we still have a 
unique opportunity to help protect, 
and as we explain this difficult but piv-
otal time to our grandchildren. Look-
ing back, whom or what will you want 
to have stood for—this President or our 
country? 
I believe, as Representative SCHIFF 
said so simply and powerfully, that in 
America, ‘‘right matters.’’ 
But I also note right matters only be-
cause so many people have, throughout 
our history, stood up for what is right, 
even when—especially when—it may be 
difficult. 
Today each U.S. Senator is called to 
do the same. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak during a sad and 
perilous moment in our Nation’s his-
tory. 
Our Nation was founded on impor-
tant, basic principles that ‘‘all men’’ 
and women ‘‘are created equal’’ and 
‘‘that they are endowed by their Cre-
ator with certain unalienable Rights, 
that among these are Life, Liberty and 
the pursuit of Happiness.’’ 
With rights, of course, always come 
responsibilities. America is a nation of 
laws, and no person, not even the 
President of the United States, is 
above these laws. No person, not even 
the President of the United States, is 
above these laws. That has been true 
since our Nation was founded, and it is 
still true today. 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Donald 
Trump has abused his power and acted 
as if he is above the law. He did this by 
holding up critical military aid to pres-
sure a new foreign leader to investigate 
a political rival for his own political 
benefit. Then he did everything he 
could to try and cover it up after he 
got caught. 
As U.S. Senators, it is our constitu-
tional duty to fairly and thoughtfully 
consider Articles of Impeachment, lis-
ten to the evidence, and make a deci-
sion that honors our Nation’s values 
and our fundamental belief that no one 
is above the law. 
That is exactly what I did, and it is 
why I will vote to convict President 
Trump and remove him from office. 
The facts show the President did ev-
erything he could to cover up the 
truth, put our elections under even 
greater risk of foreign interference, 
and damaged the constitutional checks 
and balances essential to our democ-
racy. 
Let’s be clear. We are here because of 
one person. We are here because of one 
person—President Donald J. Trump. 
The President was provided multiple 
opportunities to prove his innocence, 
as he should be. The House made 
countless requests for documents dur-
ing the impeachment inquiry. The 
White House ignored them. 
The House issued 42 subpoenas. The 
White House refused to comply and 
even went so far as to threaten and in-
timidate those people who chose to ap-
pear. 
Yet, even with this unprecedented 
level of obstruction, the House made a 
strong case for impeachment. 
Once impeachment moved to the 
Senate, the President again had nu-
merous opportunities to defend him-
self. The American people and the peo-
ple of Michigan strongly supported 
having additional documents and rel-
evant witnesses—firsthand witnesses 
who could speak to the Articles of Im-
peachment. That is what a trial is sup-
posed to be about. 
Yet the Senate did not hear from 
people who clearly have key, relevant

information, including the former Na-
tional Security Advisor, John Bolton, 
who is willing to testify, and, in fact, it 
is just a matter of time when we will 
hear publicly, all of us, what he would 
have said to the Senate; Acting White 
House Chief of Staff and Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget Mick 
Mulvaney; OMB Associate Director of 
National Security Programs Michael 
Duffy; and White House National Secu-
rity Aid Robert Blair. 
Common sense—common sense—says 
that if President Trump’s top staff 
have evidence of his innocence, he 
would have insisted that we hear from 
them, as we should. They would have 
rushed into this Chamber. 
Unfortunately, the exact opposite 
happened, lending strong support for 
the evidence presented by the House of 
Representatives. 
Instead, the President’s defense team 
argued that abuse of power is not a 
crime and, therefore, not an impeach-
able offense, and it became clear that 
they believe, as the President himself 
has said on many occasions, that he 
has power to do anything he wants 
under article II of the Constitution. 
They also argued that if the Presi-
dent thinks his reelection is in the pub-
lic interest, and if he does anything to 
benefit his reelection, including get-
ting help from a foreign country, then 
that too is in the public interest and 
not an abuse of power. 
Common sense would tell us other-
wise. 
Keep in mind that these are far from 
mainstream legal arguments, even in 
conservative legal circles. 
These arguments have been made up 
to protect President Trump and cover 
up his wrongdoing. These arguments 
are nothing short of appalling, and I 
am alarmed at what they suggest 
President Trump could do next week, 
next month, in November, or what any 
President in the future could do. 
Is it now OK for the President of the 
United States to ask a foreign leader to 
investigate a Member of Congress or 
any citizen if it helps him get reelected 
and, thus, in his mind, benefits the 
country? Is it now OK for the President 
of the United States to tell a Governor 
that they are not getting any critical 
disaster relief until they endorse him 
in the next election? Is it now OK for 
the President of the United States to 
ask foreign leaders to give campaign 
contributions or other political help in 
exchange for official visits? 
I don’t think any of this is OK. The 
people of Michigan don’t think any of 
this is OK, and I intend to do every-
thing I can to ensure that it doesn’t be-
come our new normal. 
The Founders were smart. They had 
lived under a King, and they had no in-
tention of doing so ever again. I have 
to wonder why so many of my Repub-
lican colleagues seem so, so eager to 
give it a try. This is the United States 
of America. In our country, no Presi-
dent is above the law, and it is illegal 
for a candidate or any elected official 
to receive political help from a foreign 
government. Americans must decide 
American elections. This is funda-
mental to our democracy and worth 
continuing to fight for, which I intend 
to do. 
Having said that, I am also deeply 
concerned about the divisions in our 
country, in our families, in our com-
munities. It is critical that we find 
ways to listen to each other, respect 
differences, and find common ground so 
that we can address the important 
issues affecting our families and our 
country. These are indeed serious and 
perilous times. It is up to all of us to 
stand up for what we believe is right 
and to work to strengthen our democ-
racy by coming together as Americans, 
by finding ways to work together to 
solve problems. Our children and our 
grandchildren are counting on us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. For the past 2 weeks, 
the President’s defense team has spun 
bizarre legal arguments, conspiracy 
theories, and flatout lies that are unbe-
coming of the Office of the President of 
the United States. 
The country knows the facts. The 
President pursued his personal and po-
litical interests in a way that harmed 
the national security of America. He 
smeared our own Ambassador to the 
Ukraine. He promoted Kremlin propa-
ganda on 2016 election interference. He 
sent his personal lawyer and willing 
members of his administration to trade 
official acts in exchange for fabricated 
dirt on a political rival. He stopped $391 
million dollars in aid from going to the 
Ukraine, and when the Ukrainians 
made clear they were desperate for 
that aid to come through, he made his 
demands—come up with dirt on the 
Bidens, find or invent the server. 
Donald Trump’s defense team has 
claimed the President wanted to fight 
corruption in Ukraine, but they have 
produced zero hard evidence to support 
that claim. 
Never in the history of our govern-
ment has the President pursued a pol-
icy end without generating what usu-
ally is mountains of paper, and yet 
here there are no memos, no meeting 
records, 
no 
communiques 
on 
anticorruption—nothing. This defense 
is fiction. 
It is fiction because the President 
was not fighting corruption in Ukraine. 
He was causing it. 
We also know the President was tell-
ing the people around him to do what 
he wanted with respect to the Ukraine. 
He was telling them to talk to his per-
sonal lawyer—talk to Rudy. Because 
the President had forgotten what is 
good for the American people, he ig-
nored the needs of our allies and for-
given the attacks on American democ-
racy. 
What 
the 
American 
Government 
under this President was after—the 
only thing it was after—was a corrupt 
favor for the personal benefit of Donald 
Trump. This favor was to get a foreign 
government to target an American cit-
izen when our own intelligence services 
were legally prohibited from doing so— 
an action that even Trump’s own Sec-
retary of State, Mike Pompeo, once ad-
mitted is illegal. Mike Pompeo said: 
‘‘It is not lawful to outsource that 
which we cannot do.’’ Yet that is what 
the President was seeking. 
And that was not the only illegal ac-
tion. The GAO has said that holding up 
the Ukraine aid was a violation of the 
Impoundment Control Act. And when 
the aid eventually went through in 
September of last year, it wasn’t be-
cause they suddenly had a whole lot of 
new respect for the constitutional pow-
ers of the Congress; it was because they 
got caught. 
When this abuse came to light, Don-
ald Trump’s response was: I pretty 
much can do what I want. I am above 
the law. 
On the south lawn of the White 
House, he confirmed that he wanted 
Ukraine to smear the Bidens, smear 
them by announcing investigations. He 
said he wanted the same thing from 
China. 
In a White House press briefing, Mick 
Mulvaney, the Chief of Staff, confirmed 
that the scheme had been politically 
motivated. A reporter who was clearly 
stunned at the Mulvaney admission 
asked 
for 
some 
clarification, 
and 
Mulvaney said: ‘‘I have news for every-
body: Get over it.’’ 
And that, I would submit, is what 
this trial is all about, whether the Sen-
ate and the country have to simply get 
over it. I know some Senators are ap-
parently prepared to do exactly that, 
but let’s consider the precedent that 
just ‘‘getting over it’’ sends. 
If this ends in an acquittal, it will 
signal that politicians can get away 
with selling out American interests to 
foreign coconspirators to rig an elec-
tion. What is to stop the Russians from 
approaching a future President with 
their own proposition: Dial back your 
support for the Baltic States, and we 
will take down your opponent. What 
would prevent the Chinese Government 
from approaching a Senator and offer-
ing fabricated dirt on Senators of the 
other party in order to smooth the way 
for a sweetheart trade deal? What if 
the President hands the Saudis an en-
emies list of political opponents to 
hack in exchange for military tech and 
a few regiments of American soldiers in 
Yemen? 
Ending in acquittal without hearing 
from any witnesses or getting any new 
evidence will say that the President 
can rig impeachment trials as well. 
Every impeachment trial—every one— 
included witness testimony. That is 
just good government 101. It is what 
Americans expect. It is what I heard in 
open-to-all townhall meetings in Or-
egon from counties Donald Trump won 
and from counties Hillary Clinton won. 
The Republican Senate majority is ap-
parently ready to acquit the Repub-
lican President without even going

February 3, 2020 
through the motions, ignoring what 
the American people expect. 
How will we sustain a functioning de-
mocracy when our leaders are allowed 
to rig an election and there are no con-
sequences? The Congress is going to 
struggle to unwind that precedent. It 
could outlive all of us. 
After these long days of arguments 
and questioning, in my view, this 
comes down to two simple questions. 
First, the President swears an oath, 
just like we do, to protect and defend 
our revered Constitution. Does the 
President’s oath of office mean any-
thing? When a President puts his own 
interests first, when he extorts fab-
ricated dirt from a foreign government 
for his political gain, he is obviously in 
violation of his oath. He is not pro-
tecting the constitutional right of 
Americans to choose their own leaders 
in free and fair elections. What he is 
doing is protecting himself and his own 
power. 
What does the President’s oath of of-
fice mean if violating it carries no con-
sequences? If his oath means nothing 
and he cannot be charged with a crime, 
then he is bound by nothing. And if we 
will not hold him to his oath, are we 
not surrendering our own oath—our 
own oath to protect and defend the 
Constitution? 
The second question is, Do we believe 
that this is a government of the people, 
by the people, and for the people? Be-
cause the President’s lawyers stood on 
the floor right over there and said, in 
short, it is not. 
Alan Dershowitz argued that nothing 
the President does to get reelected can 
be impeachable as long as he believes 
his reelection is in the public interest. 
The President’s counsel continued to 
build on that argument even after they 
claimed it was misunderstood—this 
from the same administration that 
holds that the President cannot be 
charged with a crime, that he exists on 
a plane—literally a plane above the 
law, as it applies to everyone else. 
If the President may commit crimes 
in office and cheat in an election to 
stay in power, then it is no longer a 
government of, by, and for the people. 
This is a government of, by, and for 
Donald Trump. The proposition of free 
and fair elections in America is gone, 
replaced by elections that happen on 
terms set by Donald Trump or on 
terms set by a future President with 
the same sort of boost from a foreign 
power. 
Putting aside whatever political fall-
out there may be in the days and weeks 
ahead, we have to ask, how can the 
Senate accept this degradation of the 
sanctity and security of free elections? 
Isn’t this institution supposed to pro-
tect our elections and defend our Con-
stitution? 
The President’s attempt to cheat in 
the election and the extreme lengths 
he has gone to cover it up are obvi-
ously dangerously wrong. What he did 
is a violation of his oath. It is a be-
trayal of the system of democratic gov-
ernment left for us by the Founders. 
And we have no choice. He is guilty. He 
must be convicted. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to make re-
marks today, if I may, until I conclude. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to speak on the impeach-
ment trial of President Donald John 
Trump. I know this was not a difficult 
decision for many of my friends and 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle, 
but it is one that has weighed heavily 
on me. Voting whether or not to re-
move a sitting President is no easy de-
cision, and it shouldn’t be, as the con-
sequences for our Nation are severe. 
As a moderate, centrist Democrat 
from West Virginia with one of the 
most bipartisan voting records in the 
Senate, I have approached every vote I 
have cast in this body with an open 
mind and pride myself in working 
across the aisle to bring my Republican 
and Democratic friends together to do 
what is best for our country. 
Where I come from, party politics is 
more often overruled by just plain old 
common sense, and I have never, in 
over 35 years of public service, ap-
proached an issue with premeditated 
thoughts that my Republican friends 
are always wrong and my Democratic 
friends are always right. Since the peo-
ple of West Virginia sent me here in 
2010, I have never forgotten the oath I 
took to defend the Constitution and 
faithfully discharge the duties of the 
office of which I am honored to hold. 
It is by the Constitution that we sit 
here today as a court for the trial of 
impeachments. It is the Constitution 
that gives us what Hamilton called the 
‘‘awful 
discretion’’ 
to 
remove 
the 
President from office. 
At the start of this trial, my col-
leagues and I took an oath swearing— 
swearing—to do impartial justice. 
I have taken this oath very seriously 
throughout this process, and I would 
like to think my colleagues have done 
the same, because, as the House man-
agers and our former colleague Repub-
lican Senator John Warner from Vir-
ginia said: It is not just the President 
who is on trial here but the Senate 
itself. 
The Framers of the Constitution 
chose the Senate for this grave task be-
cause, according to Hamilton, they ex-
pected Senators to be able to ‘‘pre-
serve, unawed and uninfluenced, the 
necessary impartiality’’ to discharge 
this 
awesome 
responsibility 
fairly, 
without flinching. 
The Framers knew this would not be 
easy, but that is why they gave the job 
to us, the Senators. They believed the 
Senate was more likely to be impartial 
and independent, less influenced by po-
litical passion, less likely to betray our 
oaths, and more certain to vote on 
facts and evidence. 
This process should be based simply 
on our love and commitment to our 
country, not the relationship any of us 
might have with this President. I have 
always 
wanted 
this 
President 
and 
every President to succeed, no matter 
what their party affiliation, but I deep-
ly love our country and must do what 
is best for the Nation. 
The Constitution refers to impeach-
ment ‘‘trials’’ and says the Senate 
must ‘‘try’’ impeachments. The Fram-
ers chose their words carefully. They 
knew what a trial was and what it 
meant to try a case. By using the term 
‘‘standards of judicial fact finding,’’ it 
calls on us to do what courts do every 
day and receive relevant evidence and 
examine witnesses. 
Sadly, the Senate has failed to meet 
its constitutional obligation, set forth 
by the Framers, to hold a fair trial and 
do impartial justice, and we have done 
so in the worse way, by letting tribal 
politics rule the day. 
I supported President Trump’s calls 
for a fair trial in the Senate, which he 
suggested himself would include wit-
nesses. But instead this body was 
shortchanged, with a majority of my 
Republican colleagues, led by the ma-
jority leader, voting to move forward 
without relevant witnesses and evi-
dence necessary for a fair trial, as our 
Framers intended. 
History will judge the Senate harshly 
for failing in its constitutional duty to 
‘‘try’’ this case and do impartial jus-
tice, to defend the Constitution, and to 
protect our democracy. Sadly, this is 
the legacy we leave to our children and 
grandchildren. 
Removing a President from the office 
to which the people have elected him is 
a grave step to take, but the Framers 
gave the Senate this solemn responsi-
bility to protect the Constitution and 
the people of this Nation. 
Over the duration of this trial, I have 
listened carefully as both the House 
managers and the White House Counsel 
make their case for and against the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment. I commend 
both sides for their great and grueling 
work in defending their respective po-
sitions. 
The House managers have presented 
a strong case, with an overwhelming 
display of evidence that shows what 
the President did was wrong. The 
President asked a foreign government 
to intervene in our upcoming election 
and to harm a domestic political rival. 
He delayed much needed security aid to 
Ukraine to pressure newly elected 
President Zelensky to do him a favor, 
and he defied lawful subpoenas from 
the House of Representatives. 
However, the President’s counsel, 
too, defended their actions by laying 
out their case of the President’s ac-
tions. They pointed to the unclassified 
transcript of President Trump’s July 25 
call with newly elected Ukrainian 
President Zelensky to make the argu-
ment that Trump discussed burden- 
sharing with other European countries 
and a mutual interest in rooting out

corruption. They presented their views 
that the President was not given due 
process in the House of Representatives 
and highlighted the expedited nature of 
the House’s proceedings. Finally, they 
argued: If a President does something 
which he believes will help him get 
elected and reelected in the public in-
terest, that cannot be the kind of quid 
pro quo that results in impeachment. 
Over the long days and nights of this 
trial, I have listened to both sides 
present their case and answer our ques-
tions. I remain undecided on how I will 
vote, but these points I believe to be 
true. First, it was not a ‘‘perfect’’ call. 
A newly elected President Zelensky, 
with no experience in international 
politics, gets a call from the leader of 
the free world asking for a favor re-
lated to U.S. domestic political affairs. 
No one—no one—regardless of polit-
ical party, should think what he did 
was right. It was just simply wrong. 
Pressuring a NATO ally who is actively 
fighting off Russian aggression in his 
country is wrong. President Zelensky, 
or anyone else, should never feel be-
holden to the superpower of the world 
for a ‘‘favor’’ before they can receive 
military aid. It is not who we are as a 
country. We stand shoulder to shoulder 
with our allies and never, ever condi-
tion our support of democracy for a po-
litical favor. 
Of all of the arguments we have 
heard from the House managers and 
White House Counsel during the long 
days and nights we have sat here, the 
most dangerous and the most troubling 
to me is the false claim that the Presi-
dent can do no wrong, that he is above 
the law, and if it is good for the reelec-
tion of the President, then, it is good 
for our country. That is simply prepos-
terous. That is not who we are as 
Americans. 
That is not how I was raised in the 
small coal mining town of Farmington, 
WV. Where I was raised, no one be-
lieved they were better than anyone 
else and could act with total disregard 
for the well-being of their neighbor if it 
was for their best interest. That is not 
why, over 230 years ago, the founding 
generation rebelled against a King and 
refused to crown a new one in this Re-
public. So let me be clear. No one, not 
even the President, is above the law. 
Finally, the purpose of impeachment 
is not to punish the President but to 
protect the public. The ultimate ques-
tion is not whether the President’s 
conduct warrants his removal from of-
fice but whether our Nation is better 
served by his removal by the Senate 
now with impeachment or by the deci-
sion the voters will make in November. 
As Hamilton warned us, impeach-
ments ‘‘seldom fail to agitate the pas-
sions of the whole community.’’ They 
divide us on party lines and inflame 
our animosities. Never before in the 
history of our Republic has there been 
a purely partisan impeachment vote of 
a President. Removing this President 
at this time would not only further di-
vide our deeply divided Nation but also 
further poison our already toxic polit-
ical atmosphere. 
In weighing these thoughts, and of 
all of the arguments brought forward 
in the case, I must be realistic. I see no 
path to the 67 votes required to im-
peach President Trump and haven’t 
since this trial started. However, I do 
believe a bipartisan majority of this 
body would vote to censure President 
Trump for his actions in this manner. 
Censure would allow this body to unite 
across party lines and as an equal 
branch of government to formally de-
nounce the President’s actions and 
hold him accountable. His behavior 
cannot go unchecked by the Senate, 
and censure would allow a bipartisan 
statement condemning his unaccept-
able behavior in the strongest terms. 
History will judge the Senate for how 
we have handled this solemn constitu-
tional duty, and without bipartisan ac-
tion, the fears of the great Senator 
Byrd will come true. As he said during 
the Clinton impeachment, the Senate 
will ‘‘sink further into the mire’’ be-
cause of this partisanship. ‘‘There will 
be no winners on this vote,’’ Byrd said. 
‘‘Each Senator has not only taken a 
solemn oath to support and defend the 
Constitution, but also do ‘impartial 
justice,’ ’’ to help the Nation, ‘‘so help 
me God . . . . . That oath does not say 
anything about political party; politics 
should have nothing to do with it.’’ 
I am truly struggling with this deci-
sion and will come to a conclusion re-
luctantly, as voting whether or not to 
remove a sitting President is the most 
consequential decision that I or any 
U.S. Senator will ever face. 
But regardless of my decision, and in 
the absence of 67 votes, I am reminded 
again of the words of Senator Byrd: 
The House and Senate—Republicans 
and 
Democrats—and 
the 
President 
‘‘must come together to heal the open 
wounds, bind up the damaged trust, 
and, by our example, again unite our 
people.’’ 
‘‘For the common good, we must now 
put aside the bitterness that has in-
fected our Nation . . . . We [must] 
begin by putting behind us the distrust 
and bitterness caused by this sorry epi-
sode, and search for common ground 
instead of shoring up the divisions that 
have eroded decency and good will and 
dimmed our collected vision.’’ 
It is not the legacy of the individual 
Senators 
we 
should 
be 
concerned 
about, but it is the legacy of this great 
institution, the U.S. Senate, that we 
leave for generations to come. 
I thank you, and I ask the good Lord 
to continue to bless this great country 
of ours during this trying time. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, before I begin, I really want to 
take a moment to thank our friend and 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL
for the 
manner in which he has worked to 
make this trial run so smoothly. I also 
thank our colleagues for their perse-
verance and, of course, the staff that 
has worked so diligently and has been 
so patient as we have worked through 
this process. 
The impeachment trial of President 
Donald J. Trump was a moment in his-
tory that should have been shrouded in 
the 
gravity 
of 
its 
potential 
con-
sequences. Instead, day by day, we en-
dured hyperbole in its most unserious 
form. 
It is easy to forget that America’s 
appetite for scandal fades quickly once 
you exit the beltway around Wash-
ington, DC, but I encourage my col-
leagues to recognize that the enthu-
siasm with which the House managers 
have sought President Trump’s re-
moval is completely and inarguably di-
vorced from reality in the heartland. 
As it appeared to my fellow Ten-
nesseans, the intentional mishandling 
of the House of Representatives’ con-
stitutional duty was nothing more 
than an attempt to prelitigate the 2020 
election. That is correct—to prelitigate 
the 2020 election and to remove Presi-
dent Trump from office and thereby re-
move him from the ballot. 
Our partisan friends had decided on 
the outcome that was necessary for 
them. They just needed to find a path 
that was going to get them there. So 
they had their outcome. They needed a 
path. 
We saw House Democrats freeze out 
the President’s counsel, refusing them 
an opportunity to fairly participate in 
the House Intelligence Committee’s in-
vestigation. 
House Manager SCHIFF created the 
supposed conversations he falsely at-
tributed to the President and waited to 
see if his assertions would be ques-
tioned or if they were going to be ac-
cepted as fact. 
Let me tell you something. I am a 
mom and I am a grandmother. I will 
tell you this. I don’t think there is any 
mother on Earth who would stand for 
it if her child did such a thing to a 
coach or a teacher or a Scout leader or 
a minister. They would not stand for 
it, and yet the Senate was expected to 
indulge this unseemly behavior. This is 
something that is appropriate that we 
question. 
The House managers relied heavily 
on the assertions of a whistleblower 
but refused to reveal anything about 
the circumstances that led to the whis-
tleblower’s report. So here we are at 
the end of the trial. Do we know if the 
whistleblower is a person or if it is a 
group of people? Does the report rep-
resent a consensus of ideas or just bi-
ased opinion? Was it prepared by an in-
dividual or prepared by a committee? 
No one can answer that question ex-
cept House Manager SCHIFF and his 
staff from the House Intel Committee, 
but that is not something they wanted 
to come down and talk about. 
When it became clear that the White 
House would push back on witness sub-
poenas seeking testimony protected by 
executive privilege, House Democrats 
chose to move on rather than fight as

hard as they could for their case. They 
looked at those subpoenas, thought 
about the evidence that might come 
from them, and decided: not worth the 
trouble. Instead, they tried to rely on 
the pandemonium created by a historic 
moment to convince their colleagues 
and the American people that justice 
demanded a do-over—a do-over for the 
House impeachment. 
When 
that 
strategy 
failed, 
they 
blamed the Members of the U.S. Senate 
for our unwillingness to go in and clean 
up their mess. This wasn’t a pressure 
tactic; it was a manipulation tactic 
aimed right at the hearts of the Amer-
ican people. 
Unfortunately for the House man-
agers, the people see with dazzling clar-
ity what has transpired within the four 
walls of this Chamber. The House man-
agers have asked us to go on the record 
and rubberstamp history’s first—his-
tory’s first—impeachment inquiry to 
be filed solely on the basis of partisan 
politics—first one. They have asked us 
to ignore how quickly they moved to 
impeach President Trump and to not 
compare 
their 
timeline 
to 
the 
timelines from the Nixon or the Clin-
ton impeachment. 
Colleagues, I did my constitutional 
due diligence. I have read the House 
managers’ brief and those reports pre-
pared by the House Republicans and 
the President’s counsel. I saw it all in 
black and white, and it was my due 
diligence that has led me to support ac-
quittal. 
Now, when I was serving in the 
House, there were times when I became 
frustrated with President Bush or, 
then, with President Obama. And when 
we, as Members of the House, at that 
point in time were faced with President 
Obama’s apology tour, his senseless 
pursuit of government-run healthcare, 
and his involvement in the Fast and 
Furious scandal or the DACA executive 
memo, my colleagues and I discussed 
the possibilities of impeachment: What 
are we going to do about this? We 
looked at all the facts, and ultimately 
we chose a different path, a different 
path that respected the American peo-
ple. We litigated our policy differences 
in the courts, where those battles be-
long. 
So, Madam President, I ask my col-
leagues that, when the time comes, 
they exercise the same restraint. I im-
plore every Member of this body to rec-
ognize the supremacy of the Constitu-
tion over partisan spin. Vote to acquit. 
Vote to reject the two Articles of Im-
peachment. 
I yield the floor. 
Madam President, I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to join my colleagues 
speaking about what has transpired 
over the last several weeks and also to 
say something that I think is maybe 
not as obvious as what people realize, 
and that is that election interference is 
the issue of our day. It is not because 
we just spent 11 days talking about it, 
and what might have happened in the 
Oval Office about interference in the 
upcoming 2020 election. It is the issue 
of our day because we live in an infor-
mation age, and weaponizing misin-
formation has become a lethal cam-
paign tool. That is to say that, if you 
tarnish your opponent enough with 
misinformation, accuse them of cor-
ruption, then you can either score by 
wounding them fatally—that is, by get-
ting people not to vote for them or by 
disincentivizing people to vote at all. 
Claiming corruption seems to be a 
pretty good tool these days to wound 
anybody, to wound institutions, the 
free press, legitimate government over-
sight, but most seriously, it wounds 
our democracy by sowing doubt into 
free and fair elections. Once voters be-
lieve the election results are corrupt, it 
is hard for them to have faith in the re-
sults, and it is hard to make tough de-
cisions that we need to make as a soci-
ety to move forward. Voting, in and of 
itself, does give us confidence as a na-
tion, unless we know there are free and 
fair elections, we know the public has 
spoken and the results are legitimate. 
I am personally grateful to my prede-
cessor, Senator Slade Gorton, for how 
he handled the 2000 election. After a 3- 
week recount and a margin of less than 
one half of 1 percent, with control of 
the Senate, a 50–50 split to be decided, 
he conceded. Since then—and even at 
that time—some States tried to sup-
press provisional ballots. But Senator 
Gorton not only believed that provi-
sional ballots were legitimate, but he 
believed that the election was cor-
rectly decided. That must have been a 
tough moment for him as he saw a 
shift in public sentiment in the State 
of Washington, as we have moved more 
toward a different direction. 
But today we live in a world of 
disinformation, where distrust can be 
served up like your own personal cock-
tail. After consuming and analyzing 
endless amounts of personal data about 
you, someone knows exactly what 
disinformation tactic will work best 
with 
you. 
It 
is 
almost 
like 
disinformation on steroids. 
Our adversaries, the Russians, are es-
pecially sowing these seeds of distrust 
into our democracy trying to dissuade 
people from even voting and more seri-
ously trying to divide us as a Nation 
and tarnish our democracy. I don’t 
know if this is some payback from 
President Putin, who believes that the 
United States helped in the demise of 
the Soviet Union, or if Russia is just 
trying to undermine American and Eu-
ropean trust and free and open demo-
cratic systems; or if Russia is trying to 
divide Europe so it can dominate Euro-
pean energy supplies and exert its in-
fluence over European policies. I just 
know this: We are not the first act of 
this play. 
This has been going on for many 
years and in many places. They have 
interfered in European elections. A 2018 
report shows, ‘‘the Europeans launched 
several multilateral and regional ini-
tiatives to improve Europe’s reliance 
to improve Europe’s resilience to build-
ing 
collective 
defenses 
against 
disinformation and cyber-attacks, im-
proving cross-border cooperation . . . 
and applying sanctions against mali-
cious actors.’’ 
The Russians interfered in our 2016 
election, our own intelligence agencies 
agreed. 
The Special Counsel’s investigation 
‘‘established Russia interfered in the 
2016 election principally through two 
operations. First, a Russian entity car-
ried out a social media campaign that 
favored Presidential candidate Donald 
J. Trump and disparaged Presidential 
candidate Hillary Clinton, and second, 
a Russian intelligence service con-
ducted computer intrusions and oper-
ations against entities, employees, and 
volunteers working for the Hillary 
Clinton campaign and released stolen 
documents.’’ 
We must fight back against Russia or 
anyone who interferes in our elections. 
Protecting our elections should be a bi-
partisan effort. We should listen to 
what the intelligence community says, 
because they are warning us now that 
Russia will interfere again in the 2020 
elections. 
That is why I take so seriously the 
House charges that President Trump 
was involved in a scheme, over a long 
period of time, involving many people, 
to ask the Ukrainians to interfere in 
our election. 
As Federal Election Commissioner 
Ellen Weintraub said, ‘‘let me make 
something 100% clear to the American 
people and anyone running for office. It 
is illegal for any person to solicit, ac-
cept, or receive anything of value from 
a foreign national in connection with a 
U.S. election. This is not a novel con-
cept.’’ 
So why has President Trump contin-
ued to sow distrust in our elections? He 
thought it was okay to ask the Rus-
sians to interfere in 2016, and he seems 
to be inviting Ukrainian interference 
in 2020. 
As one of my former campaign staff-
ers asked last weekend, ‘‘are cam-
paigns now going to be communica-
tions directors, fundraising directors, 
and foreign operations directors? You 
know, those people who go around and 
seek influence, perhaps dark money or 
endorsements 
from 
foreign 
govern-
ments? Will this become some sort of 
norm because we’re not acting?’’ 
We already know what the dark, 
murky world of Paul Manafort looks 
like. That is why it is so important for 
us to be clear here. Seeking, request-
ing, and accepting interference in a

U.S. election campaign is wrong. It is 
not just inappropriate, it is not just 
improper, it is illegal. By calling it im-
proper or turning a blind eye in this 
case, is enabling more election inter-
ference. 
What is not clear is who are all the 
President’s men in this administration 
who are helping him abuse his power. 
He is using his office for political gain. 
How are they accomplishing this task 
for him? 
It is so disappointing to see that this 
might be happening in our Nation. 
Where will the abuse stop? I know this. 
As a young girl, I remember the Satur-
day Night Massacre, the time when Bill 
Ruckelshaus and Elliot Richardson 
stood up to illegal behavior. My father, 
at the time was definitely a Democrat, 
but he wanted me to understand this 
lesson. People of the other party might 
not share the same philosophy, but 
they did share the same Constitution, 
and the scales of justice are balanced. 
Yes, there is probably no harder task 
than to stand up to the President of 
your own party, but that is what Bill 
Ruckelshaus and Elliot Richardson did. 
I remember that lesson and called 
Bill Ruckelshaus after Jeff Sessions 
recused himself and was fired. Bill’s ad-
vice was prophetic. He said, ‘‘You 
should use this opportunity now to 
make sure the next Attorney General 
will be an independent and help rein in 
this president’s abuse of power.’’ Well, 
we obviously did not get that done, and 
we all know what that outcome has 
been. 
It occurred to me last weekend that 
maybe the Saturday Night Massacre in 
this case has happened. Maybe John 
Bolton and Fiona Hill will turn out to 
be those people who stood up to the 
abuse of power. I know this: It is im-
portant to have listened to them. 
Twice in this gallery over the last 
several weeks I heard a young baby 
cry. I thought how unusual that some-
body would bring a child to an event 
like this. Probably their parents want-
ed to be part of history. And then I 
thought about what that child would 
say, probably over the rest of their life: 
that they had been at this impeach-
ment trial. 
But what I want to know is about the 
reflections 30 or 40 years from now. 
Will we be remembered for rooting out 
illegal activity, stopping interference 
in our elections or not, or will this mo-
ment have been forgotten? 
I know my constituents have been 
clear about this—and I don’t mean my 
constituents that support the Presi-
dent or my constituents that don’t sup-
port the President. I mean my con-
stituents who want to know that we 
are going to enforce the law. They 
don’t care about what the outcome is 
in the next election or how it might 
benefit either party. And it is clear 
that either party could overstep in this 
situation. They want to know if we are 
going to uphold the oath of office and 
hold 
people 
accountable 
for 
wrongdoings that they pursue. 
I hope that we have taken this elec-
tion interference issue seriously. I plan 
to work with my colleagues, on a bi-
partisan basis, to get more laws passed 
on election security and to stop inter-
ference. I have been a loud and con-
sistent spokesperson for better cyber-
security in our Nation. I am not going 
to let our democracy be eroded by for-
eign interests that want to harm what 
is so precious in our Nation. I will be 
voting for both articles, and for im-
peachment. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Hawaii is 
recognized. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, the 
American experiment was a radical 
one. It imagined equal justice under 
the law. It imagined equal protection 
under the law. It imagined a cum-
bersome system in which tyranny 
could be avoided by the constant strug-
gle between elected and appointed lead-
ers, and it intentionally sacrificed 
speed, efficiency, and convenience to 
avoid the abuse of power. And so it is 
with unending regret that I see what is 
happening. 
I grieve for the Senate, an institution 
both hallowed and flawed, an elite 
place in the worst sense of the word, 
and yet still the main place where 
American problems are to be solved. To 
paraphrase Winston Churchill, the Sen-
ate is the worst legislative body, ex-
cept for all of the others. 
There are millions of Americans who 
have formed a basic expectation about 
how a trial is to function based on hun-
dreds of years of law and based on their 
common sense. Make no mistake— 
what the Senate did was an affront to 
the basic idea of a trial. And for all of 
the crocodile tears of my colleagues, 
all of the fake outrage at the accusa-
tion, we must call this what it was—it 
is a coverup. 
I don’t know what Mulvaney or 
Bolton or Pompeo would say. I don’t 
know what the documents would illu-
minate. And I believe it is normally 
very dangerous to ascribe motives to 
fellow Senators when criticizing their 
vote. But it is impossible for me to es-
cape the conclusion that they don’t 
want to know; that they wanted to get 
this over with before the Super Bowl, 
of all things. They are afraid of this 
house of cards falling all the way down. 
As I look at the Republican side of 
the Chamber, I know this moment in 
history has made their particular jobs 
extraordinarily difficult, requiring un-
common courage. They have to risk 
the scorn of their voters, their social 
circle, 
their 
colleagues, 
and 
their 
President in order to do the right 
thing. 
On one level, I knew the likely out-
come, but the bitter taste of injustice 
lingers in my mouth. 
On behalf of everyone who couldn’t 
get away with an unpaid traffic fine, is 
in jail for stealing groceries so they 
could eat that night, who can’t get a 
job because of medical debt, I say 
shame on anyone who places this Presi-
dent or any President above the law. 
The President is not above the law. No 
one is above the law. The President is 
guilty on both counts. 
The Constitution gives extraordinary 
powers to the President under article 
II, and that makes sense because with-
out a powerful magistrate, the govern-
ment can’t function. But in granting 
these powers, the Framers thought 
carefully about how to constrain them, 
and they decided that a President 
could be controlled to greater or lesser 
degrees by the legislature, by the judi-
ciary, and by the voters. But the Fram-
ers couldn’t contemplate this level of 
polarization where, even in the face of 
the overwhelming evidence of high 
crimes, one party would not just exon-
erate him for it but, in fact, ratify 
these crimes. They didn’t imagine that 
one party would be so uniformly loyal 
to its President that it could maintain 
a hammerlock on the Senate, pre-
venting the prospect of 67 votes from 
ever being available for removal. 
I don’t think we are in danger of the 
impeachment process becoming rou-
tine; I think we are in much greater 
danger of making the impeachment 
process moot. And if so, God help us 
all. 
But all is not lost. We remain a gov-
ernment of, by, and for the people. If 
people across the country find this as 
odious to our basic values as we do, in 
8 months the American public can 
render their own verdict on the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Oklahoma is recog-
nized. 
Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous con-
sent to be allowed to speak as in morn-
ing business for whatever time I shall 
consume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, nearly 20 
years ago, I was here in this exact 
spot—I remember it so well—delib-
erating the guilt or innocence of a 
President. It happens that at that 
time, it was President Clinton from 
your State of Arkansas. At that time, 
I said that I thought it would probably 
be the most important vote I would 
cast as a Senator. I was wrong. I think 
my vote on Wednesday—the day after 
tomorrow—to acquit President Trump 
will be the most important vote of my 
career. I really believe that. 
Over the past few weeks, as we have 
considered impeachment, there has 
been a lot made of the fact that I was 
willing to vote to convict President 
Clinton 20 years ago and yet to vote 
the other way in the current process

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S799 
February 3, 2020 
we are under right now. Putting the 
morality question from President Clin-
ton aside, this supposed debate high-
lights the central point of the dif-
ferences in the impeachment process 
and why President Trump should not 
be impeached. 
Before Clinton was even impeached, 
he admitted to the crime of perjury. 
This is a big difference because we have 
a President right now who has not ad-
mitted that. In fact, there have not 
really been accusations of a crime. Our 
debate then was about whether perjury 
was a high crime or misdemeanor. I be-
lieve it was. As I said then, the Presi-
dent should be held to the highest 
standard. 
But that was substantially different 
than the question before us today. The 
question put to us by the House man-
agers is an evidentiary one. It is one 
that asks the question if, according to 
the evidence presented, there is a de-
termination that President Trump is 
guilty of a crime, and the answer is no. 
Presidents should be held to the high-
est standard, but that standard can’t 
be a false, moving standard that isn’t 
based on evidence or is established by a 
court of public opinion. 
Here is why I will vote to acquit the 
President. The whole impeachment in-
quiry was initiated on the basis that 
President Trump orchestrated the quid 
pro quo with Ukrainian’s President 
during a phone call on July 25 of 2019. 
It is kind of confusing. 
A lot of people don’t really under-
stand what it is all about, but Ukraine 
has had serious problems. You know 
what is happening. The Russians have 
been there mass murdering the Ukrain-
ians for a long period of time. We have 
watched that happen. So they kind of 
put this thing together saying: Well, 
there was an arrangement made by 
President Trump that they would with-
hold military aid to Ukraine unless 
there was a deal they could make and 
have something investigated by the 
President of Ukraine. Now, the House 
managers spent 75 percent of their time 
on this point and driving home the im-
portance 
of 
our 
partnership 
with 
Ukraine and talking about the Russian 
aggression. The facts weren’t there, 
but, worse, it is hypocritical. There 
was nothing wrong with President 
Trump’s phone call with President 
Zelensky. 
You might wonder how I can be so 
sure. It is simple. The House Demo-
crats’ allegations were secondhand, and 
that means they were hearsay. There 
was not one direct witness. In fact, 
they had 17 witnesses in the House of 
Representatives and not one of them 
were firsthand. The transcript speaks 
for itself. There was no evidence of a 
quid pro quo or of any wrongdoing, 
whatsoever, just of a President who un-
derstands 
both 
the 
importance 
of 
Ukraine as an ally and the importance 
of rooting out corruption. President 
Zelensky said publicly that he felt no 
pressure. He testified about this and 
Trump asking to investigate anything 
in exchange for foreign aid. 
You have to keep in mind we have a 
very conservative President. He doesn’t 
just dish out foreign aid to everybody 
who needs it. In this case, there was a 
necessity to have military aid. We 
couldn’t get any lethal military aid 
from President Obama. All he wanted 
to send was blankets and K-rations. 
They don’t have K-rations anymore; 
they call it something else. MREs. But, 
nonetheless, there was not going to be 
any military aid sent to them. 
The Trump administration placed a 
brief, temporary hold on the aid to 
Ukraine to ensure that the American 
taxpayers were not going to be abused. 
This is very significant. He did this to 
Ukraine to make sure that the amount 
of money that was sent in there was 
going to be used properly and the 
amount of military aid that was going 
to be used. 
But at the same time, you have to 
keep in mind he was doing that with 
everybody else too. He is just not a 
fast-spending President. He is going to 
make sure things have to be made in 
accordance with their needs. In fact, at 
other times, he withheld the same type 
financial aid to Afghanistan, South 
Korea, El Salvador, Honduras, Guate-
mala, Lebanon, and Pakistan. So the 
fact that he did it with Ukraine was 
consistent with his other policies. This 
is what he does and what he has always 
done. 
I am confident about this because I 
talked to President Trump directly 
about it. I am the chair of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, the com-
mittee is responsible for authorizing 
lethal aid to Ukraine. I have been 
working on securing that lethal aid for 
a long period of time, dating back to 
2014. In 2014, we had a different Presi-
dent. It was President Obama. And 
then 
the 
Ukraine 
President 
Poroshenko—I can remember being in 
Ukraine with Poroshenko, and I talked 
to him about this. This was the same 
time Russia was in Ukraine and was 
mass killing the Ukrainians. We went 
to President Obama to get help, and he 
wouldn’t do it. He didn’t want to send 
any lethal military aid. And he said 
over and over again—we talked about 
blankets and K-rations. When Presi-
dent Trump came into office, he 
changed it. He is the first President to 
provide lethal aid to Ukraine. He has 
been a committed partner in the region 
helping them withstand Russian ag-
gression. 
I bring this up because during the 
first 3 days of the House managers’ 
presentation, about 75 percent of that 
time was spent on this issue talking 
about his lack of support for Ukraine, 
when in reality, this President has 
been supporting Ukraine. The House 
managers who were serving in the 
House at that time—this is significant. 
Of the House managers—however many 
were sitting over here for the last 
week—they 
are 
all 
talking 
about 
things they want to do for Ukraine. 
Yet the first vote that was taken origi-
nated in the Armed Services Com-
mittee for FY 2016, and it happened to 
be that the Democrats—the very three 
Democrats who were serving at that 
time—voted against it. They didn’t 
vote for it. This is the type of thing 
you get when this hate-motivated stuff 
was going on for such a long period of 
time. 
The House didn’t prove that Trump 
committed a crime. I am the first to 
admit I am not a lawyer. Sometimes I 
think that plays to my advantage. I 
look at things in a different way. I try 
to just inject a little bit of common 
sense. I listened to the lawyers and, 
frankly, I didn’t even understand what 
some of them were saying, but I do 
know pretty much what is going on 
around here. 
In this case, the reasons behind why 
the President should not be impeached 
are common sense. He didn’t commit a 
crime. That didn’t come just from me. 
You would expect me to say that. That 
came from others who were the well-re-
spected attorneys who were involved in 
each side of this case. Each of the past 
impeachment cases in the House of 
Representatives 
accused 
Presidents 
Johnson, Nixon, and Clinton of com-
mitting a crime. This President didn’t 
commit a crime. But Clinton did, and 
he admitted that he did. It was perjury 
at that time. That is a crime. It was 
the same thing with Nixon and the 
same thing with Johnson. So all those 
things that have happened in recent 
history have been crimes but not with 
this President. 
The Democrats wanted to impeach 
President Trump since he took office. I 
think there was a witness we had 
today—I believe it was today—they had 
a visual up here that showed all the 
people who have been trying to im-
peach President Trump ever since he 
took office. I am talking about the 
first week he was in office. It was all 
documented up there. They are still at 
it. I have no doubt they will continue 
to do that, but it is not going to work. 
It didn’t work in this case. 
Democrats have wanted to impeach 
him since he took office. The Wash-
ington Post reported the concerted ef-
fort by the leftwing advocacy groups to 
move 
toward 
impeachment 
of 
the 
President only minutes after his inau-
guration. So they have been looking 
for a reason to impeach President 
Trump. 
I think one of the stars of the testi-
mony 
that 
went 
on 
was 
Alan 
Dershowitz. He is someone who is held 
in the highest regard. He is a law pro-
fessor at Harvard University, and he is 
a strong Democrat. He is not a Repub-
lican. First thing he did was admit he 
voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, so 
that qualifies him in a different way 
than most of the people who were here 
as witnesses. He was direct in his pres-
entation and shredded the Democrats’ 
case. He made it clear that abuse of 
power should be a political weapon 
suited for a campaign, not impeach-
ment, as abuse of power is not a crime 
or impeachable conduct.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S800 
February 3, 2020 
Dershowitz also explained that vir-
tually every President since President 
Washington could have been accused of 
impeachment if they used the criteria 
that the House managers—the ones 
who 
were 
sitting 
over 
here—were 
using. That was a level that could not 
be used or it would have affected every 
other President if it had been used at 
that time. 
He also had an important comment 
on whether or not we needed to hear 
sworn testimony from John Bolton. 
This is what he said. This is a quote by 
Dershowitz. He said: ‘‘Nothing in the 
Bolton revelations, even if true, would 
rise to the level of an abuse of power or 
an impeachable offense.’’ That is Alan 
Dershowitz. 
It is clear that President Trump 
must be acquitted of the charge of 
abuse of power on its merits. A vote to 
convict in this case would be a dan-
gerous precedent. 
I would say, time and time again, 
that during the trial, the House man-
agers have preached at us that the 
truth matters, that facts matter; that 
we must convict the President and re-
move him from office. In fact, the 
House managers’ closing arguments—I 
tried to keep count of every time they 
made the accusations using the words 
‘‘cheat,’’ ‘‘obstruction,’’ ‘‘crimes,’’ and 
it was so many times, I lost track—but 
truth matters. Just because you say 
the President has committed a crime 
doesn’t make it true. 
Here is what is true. This has been a 
partisan process from start to finish. 
Compare that to the past. The im-
peachment inquiry against President 
Nixon was authorized by a vote of 410 
to 4 in the Congress, an overwhelming 
bipartisan vote. The same thing was 
true with Clinton. They had 31 Demo-
crats who voted to impeach the Presi-
dent. Yet in the vote of this impeach-
ment inquiry, the final vote to impeach 
President Trump was strictly partisan. 
Not a single House Republican voted to 
impeach the President. On the con-
trary, nearly every House Democrat 
did. The only bipartisan vote was 
against impeachment. 
I listened to the facts and I have lis-
tened to the evidence and I am con-
vinced President Trump has not com-
mitted a crime. All the legal minds 
who 
gave 
testimony 
pretty 
much 
agreed 
with 
that, 
including 
Dershowitz. 
I think, though, it has to be said 
there is a hatred for Trump. We have to 
admit there is something about him 
that a lot of people don’t like, whether 
it is his demeanor or it is his style. I 
understand that. But when you listen 
to the substance, look at what he has 
done right now rebuilding the military, 
including killing the top terrorists. I 
am particularly sensitive to this be-
cause this is my committee. We have 
watched what he has done to the mili-
tary. 
Back during the Obama administra-
tion, using constant dollars during the 
last 5 years of his 8-year tenure, he ac-
tually reduced the spending in military 
by 25 percent. I don’t think that has 
ever been done in the history of this 
country, except maybe immediately 
following World War II. Yet there he is, 
rebuilding the military, and we are 
now back to where we are competitive. 
I have to admit, though, during those 
last 5 years of Obama, we really hurt 
ourselves in terms of our relationships 
in terms of China and Russia taking 
the leadership positions they have 
taken. He has been rebuilding the mili-
tary. He has been confirming constitu-
tional judges. Confirming 187 judges in 
the last 3 years is a record that hasn’t 
been done before. Oddly enough, these 
are judges who have actually read the 
Constitution. That is a novel idea. 
I would say that this is the best econ-
omy we have had in decades. Last week 
we went to 3.5 percent unemployment. 
We used to consider 4 percent unem-
ployment as being fully employed, and 
yet I don’t even have a memory to 
when it has been down to 3.5 percent. 
The trade deal we did is new. It 
shows we are getting things done. We 
have more Americans working today 
than ever before, and the median 
household income is the highest it has 
ever been. 
We are going to have a very signifi-
cant vote on Wednesday. I think you 
know how I am going to vote. I am 
going to vote to acquit the President 
on both Articles of Impeachment. That 
will be a very significant vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that my full state-
ment be included in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, con-
stitutional experts will be debating 
President Trump’s misconduct for gen-
erations to come, but I think they will 
reach consensus as to the misconduct 
of the Senate in the Trump impeach-
ment. This is the first time in the his-
tory of impeachment that no witnesses 
and documents were allowed to be 
called by the U.S. Senate. It violates 
the Constitution in the impeachment 
trial of Donald Trump by its failure to 
hold a constitutionally fair trial. 
At one time, I had the opportunity to 
present as a House manager an im-
peachment case here in the U.S. Senate 
on a district court judge by the name 
of Nixon. I remember, when I appeared 
before the Senate, I was cautioned im-
mediately, even though Judge Nixon 
had been convicted of a bribery type of 
an offense in a criminal court, that it 
was incumbent for us to present the 
witnesses and documents in the U.S. 
Senate and that the Senate would con-
duct its own record in regard to the 
proceedings. Yet, here, we are not hav-
ing witnesses in the President’s im-
peachment trial. 
We had some help from the Supreme 
Court on this. In Nixon v. United 
States, 1993, pertaining to Judge Nix-
on’s trial, Justice Byron White had a 
concurring opinion. Justice White said 
that the term ‘‘try,’’ as used in article 
I, section 3, clause 6, meant that the 
Senate should conduct a proceeding in 
a manner that a reasonable judge 
would deem a trial. 
We failed to conduct a constitu-
tionally fair trial here in the U.S. Sen-
ate, and we can look to the President’s 
own counsel here for help in evaluating 
our own conduct of this trial. The 
President’s counsel, Philbin, said that 
you need to cross-examine witnesses in 
order to get to the truth. We had no 
witnesses under oath and no witnesses 
cross-examined. The tragedy here is, if 
the President is acquitted, there will 
always be a question as to whether this 
was a legitimate trial here in the U.S. 
Senate. 
Let me just spend a moment com-
paring the impeachment proceedings of 
President Clinton’s versus those of 
President Trump’s. 
With President Clinton, there was a 
trial in the Senate. It was acknowl-
edged to be fair. Witnesses were called. 
President Clinton and his administra-
tion officials had testified under oath 
and had been subject to cross-examina-
tion. President Clinton showed remorse 
for his conduct and apologized for his 
misconduct, and President Clinton’s 
misconduct was personal in nature. 
Compare that to President Trump. 
He blocked all witnesses and docu-
ments and then, through counsel, pre-
vented the Senate trial from calling 
any witnesses or producing any docu-
ments. He has never shown any re-
morse. Even though most Senators 
here know that what he did was wrong, 
he has shown no remorse whatsoever, 
and his misconduct was that of abusing 
his office for personal gain—getting a 
foreign power to help in his election 
campaign. 
Let me briefly go through article I. 
Article I states that he solicited a 
foreign government, Ukraine, to inter-
fere in the 2020 elections by its publicly 
announcing investigations that would 
benefit his reelection, conditioned on 
official U.S. Government acts of sig-
nificant value to Ukraine. The House 
managers have submitted a voluminous 
amount of information that supports 
that, and I refer to that in my attached 
statement, so I will not spend the time 
here to go through that. 
Yet, even though there is enough in 
the full record to establish the charges, 
there are other issues that add to the 
President’s committing these acts. 
First, as I mentioned before, the 
President issued a blanket obstruction 
for any witness with firsthand knowl-
edge of the President’s conduct to pro-
vide testimony on these articles here 
in the U.S. Senate. Yes, we can infer 
that, if the President had exculpatory 
witnesses, he would have produced 
those exculpatory witnesses. 
Secondly, the President’s impeach-
ment attorney, Mr. Sekulow, said that 
you cannot view this case in a vacuum. 
I agree. The President has consistently

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S801 
February 3, 2020 
misrepresented the facts and defamed 
anyone who challenges him. 
Let me just give you one concrete ex-
ample: 
the 
Mueller 
investigation, 
which has been cited in this impeach-
ment trial. The President denies Rus-
sia’s initial involvement in our elec-
tions. He resisted efforts to hold Russia 
accountable. He defamed the reputa-
tion of the special counsel. He willfully 
impeded the investigation. He attacked 
the integrity of our intelligence and 
law enforcement agencies. He also 
wrongfully claimed that the investiga-
tion exonerated him. He has done that 
over and over again. The findings in 
the report speak to a contrary conclu-
sion. It says Russia interfered in our 
2016 elections in a sweeping and sys-
tematic fashion. It reads: ‘‘If we had 
confidence that the president clearly 
did not commit a crime, we would have 
said so.’’ 
There are numerous instances in 
which the President may have ob-
structed justice, but we left the further 
pursuit of that to Congress or to a 
prosecutor after he leaves office. 
Since he has taken office, the Presi-
dent’s pattern has been to mislead and 
misstate facts and to act as a bully 
against those who have had anything 
to say against him that he has not 
liked. It makes it easier for us to un-
derstand how the illegal scheme in ar-
ticle I unfolded. 
I have one additional fact of why this 
points to establishing the facts. 
The 
President 
has 
consistently 
shown no remorse. He continuously 
tells us that the summary of the July 
25 call shows a perfect call. We know 
how controversial that call was. It was 
far from perfect. 
The next hurdle was, is this an im-
peachable offense? I concluded that it 
was. It is an abuse of power, which is 
an abuse of trust, which is clearly what 
our Founders intended as being a high 
crime and misdemeanor while in office. 
The President’s own analysis of this 
leads to the only conclusion, that being 
that abuse of power must be an im-
peachable offense. I say that because 
we had the President’s counsel—once 
again, Professor Dershowitz—who told 
us that it was not an abuse of power 
and that it was not an impeachable of-
fense. Professor Dershowitz said that if 
your election is in the public interest— 
if a President does something which he 
believes will help him get elected in 
the public interest—that it cannot be 
the kind of quid pro quo that results in 
impeachment. 
Well, that is an absurd situation if 
you adopt the logic of the President’s 
counsel that abuse of power is not an 
impeachable offense. It is clearly an 
impeachable offense. The President’s 
conduct 
has 
jeopardized 
America’s 
global leadership in promoting our val-
ues. Our values are our strength. 
I thought it was very telling, the 
conversation of Ambassador Volker 
with Mr. Yermak, who is the principal 
counsel 
to 
President 
Zelensky 
of 
Ukraine. 
Ambassador Volker said: Don’t start 
an investigation in Ukraine on your 
opponent in your election because that 
will sow division in your community. 
Mr. Yermak responded: Do you mean 
like asking us to investigate Clinton 
and Biden? 
President Trump’s conduct has en-
dangered our national security, our 
global leadership, and American val-
ues. 
Article II is a lot easier—obstruction 
of Congress—because the facts clearly 
establish that the President’s blanket 
obstruction, which he orchestrated, de-
nied any access to individuals or to 
documents in order to facilitate a 
coverup of what was uncovered under 
article I of the Articles of Impeach-
ment. 
It is essential for Congress to carry 
out our responsibilities and to be able 
to get that type of information from 
the President. It is exactly what the 
Framers of our Constitution intended 
when they developed the checks and 
balances in our system—that there 
would be no branch that would have 
absolute power. We do not have a Mon-
arch. 
President Trump has crossed the line 
with his personal interests over the 
country’s interests. He used the power 
of his office for his own personal ben-
efit. No one is above the law. We must 
act to protect the Constitution and our 
democratic system of government. It is 
with a heavy heart that I will support 
both Articles of Impeachment. 
Senators have a grave responsibility 
when it comes to the power of impeach-
ment, particularly when it involves the 
President of the United States. This is 
a very profound responsibility in which 
Senators have to do what is right for 
our country. Our decision here will af-
fect not only this President but the fu-
ture of the Presidency itself. 
The Constitution leaves to the Sen-
ate ‘‘the sole power to try all impeach-
ments.’’ The Constitution clearly re-
quires the Senate to conduct a trial. 
The Supreme Court, the ultimate in-
terpreter of the Constitution, has given 
the Senate some guidance in carrying 
out its responsibility to conduct im-
peachment trials. Supreme Court Jus-
tice Byron White, in a concurring opin-
ion in Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 
224 (1993), found that the Framers of 
the U.S. Constitution clearly intended 
‘‘that the term ‘try’ as used in article 
I, section 3, clause 6 meant that the 
Senate should conduct its proceeding 
in a manner that a ‘‘reasonable judge’’ 
would deem a trial. Justice White ac-
knowledged that the Senate ‘‘has very 
wide discretion in specifying impeach-
ment trial procedures,’’ but stated that 
the Senate ‘‘would abuse its discre-
tion’’ if it were to ‘‘insist on a proce-
dure that could not be deemed a trial 
by reasonable judges.’’ Justice Black-
mun concurred in Justice White’s opin-
ion. 
The Senate has the sole power to 
‘‘try’’ impeachments. Yet how can the 
Senate hold an actual ‘‘trial’’ without 
hearing 
direct 
evidence 
from 
wit-
nesses? The Senate chose not to hear 
additional relevant evidence and key 
witnesses with firsthand knowledge of 
the President’s conduct. However, the 
Senate is not bound solely to the House 
record when conducting an impeach-
ment trial. The Senate should have 
heard new and relevant evidence that 
bore directly on the Articles of Im-
peachment, including testimony from 
former White House National Security 
Advisor John Bolton, Acting White 
House Chief of Staff and Acting OMB 
Director Mick Mulvaney, as well as 
various other OMB and DOD officials. 
The Senate should have demanded ad-
ditional documents from the White 
House, State Department, OMB, and 
DOD that bore directly on the Articles 
of Impeachment. The Senate should 
have been able to receive further evi-
dence before concluding its trial in this 
case, whether or not the additional evi-
dence was incriminating or excul-
patory. As one of President Trump’s 
counsel Mr. Philbin said during the 
trial, the best way to find out the truth 
is for witnesses under oath to be sub-
ject to cross-examination. The Senate 
therefore failed in its responsibility 
when it did not conduct a constitu-
tionally fair trial. I suspect that Jus-
tice White in the Nixon case would 
have concluded that no ‘‘reasonable 
judge’’ 
would 
conclude 
these 
pro-
ceedings constitute such a trial. 
The evident deficiencies of the Sen-
ate trial has made it more difficult for 
me to carry out my responsibility, and 
if the Senate fails to convict, that ac-
quittal will always be questioned be-
cause of the absence of a fair trial. This 
process is not fair to the House, Sen-
ate, American people, or the President. 
Now, in regards to the specific Arti-
cles of Impeachment, article I alleges 
‘‘abuse of power’’ by the President, 
stating: ‘‘Using the powers of his high 
office, President Trump solicited the 
interference of a foreign government, 
Ukraine, in the 2020 United States 
Presidential 
election. 
He 
did 
so 
through a scheme or course of conduct 
that included soliciting the Govern-
ment of Ukraine to publicly announce 
investigations that would benefit his 
reelection, harm the election prospects 
of a political opponent, and influence 
the 2020 United States Presidential 
election to his advantage. President 
Trump also sought to pressure the Gov-
ernment of Ukraine to take these steps 
by conditioning official United States 
Government acts of significant value 
to Ukraine on its public announcement 
of the investigations. President Trump 
engaged in this scheme or course of 
conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit 
of personal political benefit. In so 
doing, President Trump used the pow-
ers of the Presidency in a manner that 
compromised the national security of 
the United States and undermined the 
integrity of the United States demo-
cratic process. He thus ignored and in-
jured the interests of the Nation.’’ 
I reluctantly conclude that the Presi-
dent has indeed engaged in the conduct

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S802 
February 3, 2020 
alleged. I come to this conclusion 
based first on the record during this 
impeachment trial. 
In weighing the facts and evidence in 
this case, I have listened carefully to 
all of the trial proceedings and taken 
extensive notes, including during the 
managers’ presentations and Senators’ 
questioning period. Let me highlight a 
few key facts and pieces of evidence 
that were determinative for my think-
ing, with the understanding that this is 
not an exhaustive list. 
First, President Trump indicated his 
strong interest in having Ukrainian 
President Volodymyr Zelensky open a 
political investigation into the Bidens, 
in a July 26, 2019, phone call between 
the President and U.S. Ambassador to 
the European Union Gordon Sondland. 
Second, Acting Chief of Staff and Of-
fice of Management and Budget Direc-
tor Mick Mulvaney admitted that a 
quid pro quo existed in terms of tying 
the release of U.S. funding to Ukraine 
to the opening of a political investiga-
tion to help President Trump. 
Third, there are numerous examples 
in the record of direct pressure on the 
Ukrainian Government to open polit-
ical investigations for the personal 
benefit of President Trump, including a 
September 1, 2019, Warsaw meeting be-
tween 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
and 
Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to the 
Ukrainian President, which directly 
tied 
U.S. 
military 
assistance 
to 
Ukraine to the opening of political in-
vestigations to hurt President Trump’s 
political rivals. These accounts were 
later confirmed in testimony by other 
U.S. diplomats, and on September 7, 
Ambassador Sondland reiterated these 
themes 
following 
discussions 
with 
President Trump. 
Fourth, before the July 25 phone call 
between 
Presidents 
Trump 
and 
Zelensky, former U.S. Special Envoy to 
Ukraine Kurt Volker communicates 
with Yermak and conditions a White 
House visit to the launching of a polit-
ical investigation against the Presi-
dent’s rivals in Ukraine. 
Fifth, on July 10, 2019, the White 
House held a series of meetings with 
high-level Ukrainian defense officials, 
which conditioned a White House visit 
from the Ukrainian President with the 
opening of political investigations in 
Ukraine sought by President Trump. 
Notably, former National Security Ad-
visor John Bolton refused to be part of 
any ‘‘drug deal’’ and asked his staff to 
report these meetings to National Se-
curity Council lawyers. It was ex-
plained by National Security Council 
Member Fiona Hill that, by ‘‘drug 
deal,’’ Ambassador Bolton was refer-
ring to conditioning a White House 
meeting for the President of Ukraine 
with the Ukrainians starting the polit-
ical 
investigations 
desired 
by 
the 
President. 
Mr. Bolton should have testified be-
fore the Senate, and we should not 
have to wait for his book release, after 
this Senate trial concludes, to get a 
full accounting of firsthand conversa-
tions here that bear directly on the im-
peachment charges against the Presi-
dent. Press reports indicate that, in his 
upcoming book, Bolton will state that 
the President explicitly told him that 
he did not want to release $391 million 
in aid to Ukraine until it announced 
investigations into his Democratic ri-
vals, including former Vice President 
Joe Biden. Also, the President specifi-
cally asked Bolton to arrange a meet-
ing for President Trump’s personal at-
torney, Rudy Giuliani, with President 
Zelensky to further the illegal scheme. 
Notably, the former White House Chief 
of Staff at the time, John Kelly, be-
lieves Bolton’s account. 
Sixth, the language used in the July 
25, 2019, phone call between Presidents 
Trump and Zelensky was a direct solic-
itation 
of 
foreign 
interference 
(a 
‘‘favor’’) by using a political investiga-
tion to help President Trump’s cam-
paign and hurt his Democratic rivals. 
Seventh, why did the Administration 
keep secret its hold on assistance to 
Ukraine in order to allegedly combat 
corruption? The U.S. has generally no-
tified countries, Congress, and the pub-
lic when it is withholding foreign aid in 
order to change the country’s behavior 
and let them know what steps they 
need to take to resolve the hold. 
As the ranking member of the Hel-
sinki Commission and as a senior mem-
ber of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, I know the importance of 
promoting American values in foreign 
policy. The President’s conduct has 
weakened America’s global leadership 
in fighting corruption, promoting de-
mocracy, and strengthening the rule of 
law. 
President Trump’s corrupt use of his 
foreign 
policy 
power 
compromised 
America’s ability to help shape the 
global community that protects Amer-
ican values. 
The record shows that Ambassador 
Volker tried to discourage Mr. Yermak 
and the Ukrainian Government from 
trying to prosecute the country’s pre-
vious President. Ambassador Volker 
says he warned it would sow deep soci-
etal divisions. Ambassador Volker says 
that Mr. Yermak quipped in response, 
‘‘You mean like asking us to inves-
tigate Clinton and Biden?’’ 
In addition to the record, I am sup-
ported in my conclusions by three 
other considerations. First, why hasn’t 
the President presented to the im-
peachment trial the testimony of the 
witnesses that have direct knowledge 
concerning the factual allegations in 
the Articles of Impeachment? I draw 
from the absence of such testimony 
that it would only corroborate the 
record presented by the House Man-
agers. Secondly, counsel to President 
Mr. Sekulow acknowledged ‘‘you can-
not view this case in a vacuum.’’ I 
agree. President Trump, during his 
Presidency, has consistently misrepre-
sented the facts and defamed anyone 
who has challenged him. 
One clear and relevant example of 
this is how he tried to obstruct the 
Mueller investigation and how, to this 
date, he mischaracterizes its conclu-
sion. The President was not exonerated 
by the Mueller report, which found 
that Russia interfered in our 2016 Pres-
idential election in a ‘‘sweeping and 
systematic fashion.’’ President Trump 
consistently took steps to deny Rus-
sia’s involvement in tampering in our 
elections, resisted efforts to hold Rus-
sia accountable, besmirched the rep-
utation of the special counsel while 
trying to dismiss him or willfully im-
peded his investigation, and repeatedly 
attacked the integrity of our intel-
ligence and law enforcement agencies. 
Indeed, the Mueller report stated: ‘‘If 
we had confidence after a thorough in-
vestigation of the facts that the Presi-
dent clearly did not commit obstruc-
tion of justice, we would so state. 
Based on the facts and applicable legal 
standards, however, we are unable to 
reach that judgment.’’ At a press con-
ference, Special Counsel Mueller reiter-
ated: ‘‘If we had had confidence that 
the president clearly did not commit a 
crime, we would have said so.’’ The re-
port detailed numerous instances in 
which the President may have ob-
structed justice, but left further pur-
suit of the matter to Congress or fu-
ture prosecutors once the President 
leaves office. 
With such a track record, it is easier 
to understand how the facts presented 
by the House managers tie together 
supporting an illegal scheme, orches-
trated by the President, to get Ukraine 
involved in our 2020 elections to help 
Mr. Trump’s reelection. 
Third, the President has consistently 
failed to show any remorse for his con-
duct, leading to the conclusion that he 
will continue to violate the sacred 
trust of the office. 
Having been satisfied that the Presi-
dent did commit the offenses in the 
first Article of Impeachment, the next 
hurdle is whether these constitute im-
peachable offenses. I conclude they do. 
President Trump is not a King or Mon-
arch. The Founding Fathers wisely cre-
ated a system of separation of powers 
and checks and balances so as not to 
concentrate power in only one office or 
department of government. The Senate 
must reject President Trump’s state-
ment on July 23, 2019, that his right 
under article II of the Constitution is 
‘‘to do whatever I want as president.’’ 
As noted in the House Judiciary 
Committee report on constitutional 
grounds for Presidential impeachment 
(December, 2019), President Trump’s 
claim here ‘‘is wrong, and profoundly 
so, because our Constitution rejects 
pretensions to monarchy and binds 
Presidents with law. That is true even 
of powers vested exclusively in the 
chief executive. If those powers are in-
voked for corrupt reasons, or wielded 
in an abusive manner harming the con-
stitutional system, the President is 
subject 
to 
impeachment 
for 
‘high 
crimes and misdemeanors.’ This is a 
core 
premise 
of 
the 
impeachment 
power.’’ I agree.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S803 
February 3, 2020 
The President’s counsel notes that 
abuse of power could become too sub-
jective a standard for Presidential im-
peachments. But as Representative 
William Cohen remarked in President 
Nixon’s case, ‘‘It has also been said to 
me that even if Mr. Nixon did commit 
these offenses, every other President 
. . . has engaged in some of the same 
conduct, at least to some degree, but 
the answer I think is that democracy, 
that solid rock of our system, may be 
eroded away by degree and its survival 
will be determined by the degree to 
which we will tolerate those silent and 
subtle subversions that absorb it slow-
ly into the rule of a few.’’ 
The premise that abuse of power 
being a too subjective standard belies 
common sense and could lead to the ab-
surd conclusion given by Professor 
Dershowitz—one of President Trump’s 
impeachment 
counsel—during 
the 
trial. He stated: ‘‘Your election is in 
the public interest. And if a president 
does something which he believes will 
help him get elected in the public in-
terest, that cannot be the kind of quid 
pro quo that results in impeachment.’’ 
Abuse of power, as used by President 
Trump, to further a scheme to get 
Ukraine to help in President Trump’s 
campaign must be an impeachable of-
fense if we believe our Constitution 
guarantees that no one, including the 
President of the United States, is 
above the law. 
The President’s counsel also observes 
that, when initiating Articles of Im-
peachment, the House should only pro-
ceed if there is bipartisan support, but 
that decision is left solely to the 
House. Once the House has acted, the 
Senate shall proceed to trial and must 
render a decision based upon the case 
presented. 
There are clear distinctions between 
the Clinton and Trump impeachments. 
In Clinton, the trial was acknowledged 
to be fair; witnesses testified before the 
Senate; President Clinton and members 
of his administration testified under 
oath; and documents were produced for 
review by the President. President 
Clinton showed remorse for his conduct 
and apologized. His misconduct was 
personal in nature. 
In contrast, President Trump blocked 
all witnesses and documents, and the 
Senate called no witnesses to testify 
under 
oath. 
President 
Trump 
has 
shown no remorse, continuing to say 
that the controversial call with Presi-
dent Zelensky was ‘‘perfect.’’ Unlike 
President Clinton’s misconduct, Presi-
dent Trump has abused the power of 
his office for personal gain. 
Turning to the second Article of Im-
peachment, Obstruction of Congress, 
the House alleges, that, in response to 
their impeachment inquiry, President 
Trump ‘‘directed the unprecedented, 
categorical, and indiscriminate defi-
ance of subpoenas issued by the House 
of Representatives . . . without lawful 
cause or excuse, President Trump di-
rected Executive branch agencies, of-
fices, and officials not to comply with 
those subpoenas. President Trump thus 
interposed the powers of the Presi-
dency against the lawful subpoenas of 
the House of Representatives, and as-
sumed to himself functions and judg-
ments necessary to exercise of the ‘sole 
power of impeachment’ vested by the 
Constitution in the House of Rep-
resentatives.’’ 
In particular, the second article al-
leges that the President: No. 1, directed 
the White House to defy a lawful sub-
poena by withholding the production of 
documents; No. 2, directed other execu-
tive branch agencies and offices to defy 
lawful subpoenas and withhold the pro-
duction of documents, including OMB 
and the Departments of State, Defense, 
and Energy; and No. 3, directed current 
and former executive branch officials 
not to cooperate with the investigating 
committees, including Mick Mulvaney 
and numerous other officials. 
After reviewing the evidence, I be-
lieve that the Senate record supports 
conviction under article II as an im-
peachable offense. 
President Trump carried out an ex-
traordinary and unprecedented cam-
paign of obstruction of Congress. Note 
that President Clinton provided evi-
dence that was requested by the House 
and Senate during impeachment pro-
ceedings, and allowed multiple White 
House aides to testify in the under-
lying investigation. President Nixon 
cooperated to an extent in his inves-
tigation, 
allowing 
numerous 
White 
House officials to testify and providing 
substantial evidence to Congress in its 
inquiry. By contrast, President Trump 
issued an edict directing his adminis-
tration to refuse to ‘‘participate’’ in all 
aspects of the House’s impeachment in-
quiry. In particular, the October 8, 
2019, letter from the White House Coun-
sel did not even attempt to assert any 
specific privileges. 
This trial has been very difficult for 
the Senate and our Nation, but each 
Senator must in his or her own judg-
ment carry out the oaths we have 
taken as Senators to support the Con-
stitution as well as our special oath to 
do ‘‘impartial justice’’ as participants 
in this Senate impeachment trial, with 
Chief Justice Roberts presiding over 
the Senate. 
Weighing the credibility of President 
Trump, I find a clear pattern of mis-
conduct in office. President Trump’s 
obstruction of Congress shows a deep 
and abiding disrespect for Congress and 
lack of appreciation for the separation 
of powers and system of checks and 
balances in our government. 
As the President and Commander in 
Chief, President Trump used his power 
to compromise and corrupt America’s 
values. Our values are our strength. In 
particular, President Trump has under-
mined the rule of law, weakened our ef-
forts to fight corruption both at home 
and abroad, damaged our national se-
curity, and helped our adversary, Rus-
sia. 
President Trump’s conduct clearly 
crossed the line when he put his own 
personal interests over the country’s 
interests, using the power of his office 
for his own personal benefit. 
No one is above the law. We must act 
to protect the Constitution and our 
democratic system of government. It is 
with a heavy heart that I support both 
Articles of Impeachment, requiring the 
removal of the President from office as 
well as the disqualification to hold and 
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or 
profit under the United States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, I am 
honored and humbled to stand before 
you today as Georgia’s and our coun-
try’s newest U.S. Senator. 
As the 100th Senator, I have spent 
the least time in Washington, but as 
the least senior Senator, I am also the 
most recently attached to the private 
sector, where the vast majority of 
Americans live and work. I am in-
tensely aware of the needs and the ex-
pectations that Americans hold for us. 
Just 2 months ago, I left nearly a 
three-decade business career to serve 
the great people of Georgia and our Na-
tion, but being here in this respected, 
historic Chamber is a very long way 
from where I started. 
I was born and raised as the fourth 
generation of corn and soybean farm-
ers, and I grew up working in our fields 
and with our cattle on the feedlot. I 
waitressed and sold watches and shoes 
to put myself through school. Then I 
moved around the country to pursue 
my dream of a business career. I have 
been a job seeker and a job creator. I 
haven’t spent my life trying to get to 
Washington, but I worked hard to 
stand where I am today. 
I have lived the American dream, and 
each day, I remember where I came 
from, and I am proud of my beginnings. 
While I am an outsider to politics, I am 
not new to getting results. I came here 
to get things done for the people of 
Georgia. 
So why does all of this matter today, 
in this historic moment right now, just 
2 days from my vote to acquit Presi-
dent Trump? Because for months and, 
sadly, years for many, Members of Con-
gress who have meant to serve the 
American people have been tied up in a 
political game. 
There is much to regret here—the 
House’s false urgency to push through 
deficient articles, only to ask for more 
time, more evidence, more testimony; 
the deception of the House managers, 
who are more focused on political 
power than they are on pursuing the 
facts; the media who ran with the nar-
rative the Democrats planted, with se-
lective, unlawful leaks. 
For the last 132 days, Congress has 
been neglecting the American people. I 
came here to get things done for Geor-
gians, but for the last 2 weeks, we have 
been stuck in the Senate Chamber, 
working 
on 
something 
that 
most 
Americans have little interest in. 
As my notebooks filled up, I thought 
to myself, how did this case even make 
it to the Senate?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S804 
February 3, 2020 
When I am around the State, it is 
very clear that this is not what people 
at home care about. Georgians aren’t 
losing sleep over a call the President 
made or questioning his constitutional 
right to conduct foreign policy. They 
are concerned with taking care of their 
families, their jobs, and their freedom 
to achieve the American dream and 
live the lives they imagined. I think of 
young kids, whether in the inner city 
or on a farm or in the suburbs. What 
example are we setting in Washington? 
Why should employers feel that Wash-
ington cares about job creation when 
there is a neglect of the engine that 
makes America strong? 
Why are we here? We are public serv-
ants, charged with protecting the Con-
stitution and our country and I hope, 
in the process, bettering the lives of all 
Americans. 
Despite this monumental distraction, 
this administration has worked tire-
lessly to move our country forward. 
Last week, the President signed into 
law the United States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement. Sadly, this sat on Speaker 
PELOSI’s desk for 1 year, denying Amer-
ican farmers and workers untold eco-
nomic opportunity. 
Last month, the administration com-
pleted a phase one deal with China, 
now holding China accountable for un-
fair trade practices and adding to our 
thriving economy. 
For 3 years, as the Democrats have 
focused on taking down a duly elected 
President, 
President 
Trump’s 
pro- 
growth policies have given us a boom-
ing economy. These policies have re-
sulted in record employment, 7 million 
new jobs, and a blue-collar boom that 
is lifting up hard-working Americans. 
This administration charges on, but 
it needs Congress’s support if America 
is to move on with the American dream 
for all. 
With that in mind, I say: Enough. 
Let’s put our trust in the American 
people. They are the ones who should 
make a judgment about the President, 
and they will do that in 9 months. Let’s 
not be so arrogant as to take that deci-
sion away from the American people. 
Instead, let’s focus all of our energies 
on improving their lives. Impeachment 
does not do that. It is time to move on. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I come 
before this body ith a deep sadness that 
this institution has failed the Constitu-
tion and failed the American people. 
We have reached a low point in our 
history. We have failed to hold a fair 
and honest impeachment trial, and we 
are nearing a vote wherein we will fail 
to hold the President accountable for 
his abuse of power and a coverup. 
Thanks to the Senate’s Republican ma-
jority, this body is complicit in that 
coverup in its refusing to call witnesses 
and obtain documents to get the full 
truth. How can we turn a blind eye to 
the truth as we cast one of the most 
important votes we will ever take? 
Yes, we are approaching a sad day for 
this body and for this country, but to 
those across the country who feel pro-
foundly angry and saddened by this 
miscarriage of justice, my message is 
this: Do not give up. Do not stop fight-
ing to save our democracy because 
America is worth the fight. America is 
worth the fight. 
Make no mistake—try as they might 
to cover it up, the full truth will come 
out. And the facts that have already 
been revealed are damning. 
The President’s handpicked Ambas-
sador, Gordon Sondland, testified, ‘‘Ev-
eryone was in the loop.’’ The more we 
find out, the more revealing his testi-
mony becomes. 
Not only is the President implicated, 
so is the Vice President and the Sec-
retary of State and the Attorney Gen-
eral and the President’s acting Chief of 
Staff and his former Energy Secretary 
and even the White House Counsel, the 
lead lawyer in this very proceeding. 
This is a pandora’s box the Repub-
lican Party is fighting to keep shut, 
but it will not stay shut. The Presi-
dent’s misdeeds and his wide circle of 
accomplices will go down as one of the 
ugliest episodes in American history. 
Even now, the evidence gathered by 
the House—that the President abused 
his office and taxpayer funds for per-
sonal gain—is staggering. Ambassador 
Sondland didn’t sugarcoat the truth. 
‘‘Was there a quid pro quo? The answer 
is yes.’’ That was his quote. Using offi-
cial power for personal gain—that is 
the very essence of abuse of power, and 
that is precisely what this President 
did. That is hardly even in dispute. The 
evidence is overwhelming. 
The President first withheld a cov-
eted 
meeting 
until 
the 
Ukrainian 
President would announce investiga-
tions into the Bidens and the debunked 
conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not 
Russia, interfered in our 2016 election. 
The President next withheld congres-
sionally appropriated military aid ille-
gally to try to force the Ukrainian 
President into making the announce-
ment of the investigations. 
The independent Government Ac-
countability Office confirmed that the 
President acted illegally. 
The President threatened our na-
tional security, the security of an ally, 
and the integrity of our next Presi-
dential election. How much more could 
be at stake? 
Ukrainian 
officials 
began 
asking 
about the aid only hours after the 
President’s now-infamous July 25 call 
with President Zelensky. That is ac-
cording to Laura Cooper, the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Rus-
sia, Ukraine, and Eurasia. A former 
Deputy Foreign Minister in Ukraine re-
ports Ukraine knew of the freeze in 
July, and the whole world knew once 
the story broke the news on August 28. 
Fortunately, 
the 
President 
got 
caught and was forced to release the 
aid. He got caught red-handed and im-
mediately commenced a scorched-earth 
blockade in Congress and the courts to 
cover up his grave misdeeds. 
Again, the facts are not in dispute. 
So knowing that these are some of 
the most serious and solemn words I 
will ever say or utter on this floor, I 
will vote to convict the President on 
both Articles of Impeachment. He is 
guilty by any standard. If he is allowed 
to act with impunity, he will be a con-
tinuing threat to the sanctity of our 
democracy. He is patently unfit to hold 
the highest office in our land. 
While the Senate may vote to acquit 
him, he will not be exonerated—not by 
this sham trial. While the Senate may 
vote to acquit the President, history 
will not. 
Now, Senators on the other side of 
the aisle are publicly and not so pub-
licly admitting that they believe the 
President is guilty, that the House 
managers proved their case. But these 
same Senators did not vote to hear wit-
nesses and get documents. They will 
fail to hold the President accountable 
for the wrongdoing they now say he is 
guilty of. 
This is one of the worst abuses of 
Presidential power in our Nation’s his-
tory. This is as bad as or worse than 
President Nixon’s. Nixon tried to cor-
rupt the 1972 election and cover it up, 
but he didn’t try to extort an ally or 
invite foreign interference into our 
election. 
At that time, members of his party 
with courage refused to turn a blind 
eye. The Republican Party of today 
bears no resemblance to the party of 
Howard Baker, who insisted on getting 
to the truth. Howard asked: What did 
the President know and when did he 
know it? It bears no resemblance to the 
party 
of 
Barry 
Goldwater, 
John 
Rhodes, and Hugh Scott, who went to 
Nixon to tell him the Republican Party 
could no longer protect him from im-
peachment and removal. 
I am grateful to the honorable offi-
cials who had the courage to act this 
time around, who defied the Presi-
dent’s order not to come forward—Am-
bassador 
Yovanovitch, 
Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman, Ambassador Taylor, 
Mr. Kent, and the others. They risked 
their careers and even their personal 
safety. We should at least—at least— 
show the same courage because the 
consequences of failing to hold this 
President to account could not be grav-
er. 
The guardrails have been taken off. 
The President invited Russian inter-
ference in the 2016 election and invited 
Chinese interference in the upcoming 
2020 election. He said on national tele-
vision he would probably take foreign 
interference again. He is unapologetic 
and unrepentant. What is he going to 
do next once the Senate Republicans 
let him get away with this abuse, once 
we show that we are no longer a co-
equal branch? 
We have never ceded so much power 
to the Executive. You can rest assured 
that this President of all Presidents 
will use that power and abuse it. Take

his word for it. He said, ‘‘Article II al-
lows me to do whatever I want.’’ Pul-
itzer Prize-winning Presidential histo-
rian Jon Meacham said the President is 
now, and this is his quote, ‘‘function-
ally a monarch.’’ That is stunning. 
Again, these are sad days for our Na-
tion, but as I said at the outset, we 
cannot and will not concede our democ-
racy. We cannot and will not concede 
the values and principles that make 
this Nation strong. We must restore 
the balance of power in our govern-
ment. We must restore accountability. 
Most importantly, we must start doing 
the work the American people sent us 
here to do. Our institutions are not 
representing what the American people 
want. Senate Republicans’ refusal to 
hold a fair impeachment trial, which is 
what 75 percent of the American people 
wanted, is just the latest example. 
While the Senate and the Constitu-
tion took a terrible battering the last 2 
weeks, I am even more committed to 
breathing life into our shared prin-
ciples of representative government. I 
am going to continue the fight to take 
obscene amounts of secret money out 
of our elections, to make it easier to 
vote, and to bring power back to the 
American people and not hand it over 
to an imperial Presidency. 
The Senate will have future opportu-
nities to restore our constitutional sys-
tem. The only question is whether Sen-
ators will rise to the occasion. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Colleagues, over 
the past few weeks, we have conducted 
the third impeachment trial in our en-
tire Nation’s history for a President. 
Let’s be perfectly clear about some-
thing: Democrats did not want to im-
peach President Trump. From the 
start, efforts to begin an impeachment 
inquiry in the House were met with re-
sistance until the President’s reckless 
behavior and unprecedented actions 
forced the Speaker’s hand. The Speaker 
could not sit idly by after the Presi-
dent withheld congressionally approved 
military aid from a U.S. ally in order 
to orchestrate foreign interference in 
our upcoming election. 
We have worked hard to find common 
ground with this President, and at 
times, Democrats have worked to-
gether to get good, bipartisan legisla-
tion 
accomplished. 
But 
President 
Trump’s brazen misconduct forced this 
issue. His misdeeds posed a moral chal-
lenge to every single Member of Con-
gress. How much corruption should we 
stomach? How much of our integrity 
should we sacrifice? How much malfea-
sance should we tolerate? Will we look 
the other way as the President flaunts 
our laws and ignores the Constitution? 
Sometimes it can seem far easier to 
just stay silent. All of us know that it 
can be easier to avoid angry phone 
calls. But think about how much hard-
er it would be to explain this moment 
in history to our children and our 
grandchildren. Think about how pain-
ful it will be to explain if you knew 
what President Trump did was wrong 
and you did nothing; if you knew what 
President Trump did was wrong under 
the Constitution that you swore to up-
hold; that you knew it was wrong, but 
you voted to acquit anyway because of 
your ambition, because of your polit-
ical party. 
Lest you think you can convince 
them otherwise, let me dispel this fic-
tion. History’s record of this time will 
be very clear. The American people can 
see through these lies. They recognize 
the inconsistencies and the double- 
speak. The American people are not 
naive. They are not stupid. They are 
not ignorant. They are not immoral. 
My Republican colleagues are not 
naive or ignorant or immoral either. 
They are good men and women. They 
love their children, their neighbors, 
and our country. I consider many of 
them my friends. When we have dinner 
together, when we go to visit the 
troops overseas. We don’t do it as 
Democrats and Republicans. We do it 
as colleagues, friends, and as peers in 
this body. We do so as elected Members 
of Congress, as Senators representing 
our States and our country. 
It should be the very same when we 
judge President Trump. In I John 2:21, 
John writes to a group of believers who 
are in turmoil. He wrote: ‘‘I do not 
write to you because you do not know 
the truth, but because you do know it 
and because no lie comes from the 
truth.’’ 
This trial had the goal of accom-
plishing one thing—to discover the 
truth, to know what happened, to hold 
the President accountable. We pledged 
to listen to receive that evidence fairly 
and to judge honestly. We swore to de-
fend the Constitution, not to defend a 
man or a political party, and we should 
all remember this when we cast our 
votes, because President Trump is not 
like you. He is not honest, kind, or 
compassionate. He doesn’t have integ-
rity or moral conviction. He is neither 
fair nor decent. 
We, as Senators who swore to uphold 
the Constitution, should, based on the 
facts laid before us, vote to convict. 
Hold President Trump accountable for 
what he has done. We have to show the 
American people, ourselves, that Presi-
dent Trump does not represent our val-
ues, that we still believe that we must 
fight for what is right, for truth, for 
justice, for honesty, for integrity, and 
that laws mean something, and we 
don’t put ourselves before the law. 
For those who lack courage in this 
moment, those who are unwilling to do 
what they know in their heart of 
hearts, in their conscience and in their 
deepest thoughts to be right, if they do 
not do what they know they should, 
they will be remembered as complicit. 
They will be remembered as not telling 
the truth. They will not be remem-
bered well. 
I urge you to vote your conscience. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The

and CORTEZ 
MASTO.

sence of a quorum.

The

Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUL-
LIVAN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
rise this evening to address the trial of 
Donald John Trump. The Founders 
gave this body the sole power to try all 
impeachments, 
and 
exercising 
that 
power—we all know—is a weighty, 
weighty responsibility. This was only 
the third time in the history of our 
country that the Senate convened to 
handle a Presidential impeachment 
and only the second in the past 150 
years. 
I was part of a small group that 
worked to secure a fair, an honest, and 
a transparent structure for the trial, 
and we based it on how this Chamber 
handled the trial of President Clinton 
some 20 years ago. So there were 24 
hours of arguments for each side, 16 
hours of questions from Members, with 
the full House record admitted as evi-
dence. 
That should have been more than 
enough to answer the questions: Do we 
need to hear more? Should there be ad-
ditional process? Mr. President, the 
structure we built should have been 
sufficient, but the foundation upon 
which it rested was rotten. The House 
rushed through what should have been 
one of the most serious, consequential 
undertakings of the legislative branch, 
simply to meet an artificial, self-im-
posed deadline. 
Prior Presidential impeachments re-
sulted from years of investigation, 
where subpoenas were issued and they 
were litigated, where there were mas-
sive amounts of documents that were 
produced and witnesses deposed, where 
resistance from the Executive was 
overcome through court proceedings 
and through accommodations. 
The House failed in its responsibil-
ities. The House failed in its respon-
sibilities. 
The 
Senate 
should 
be 
ashamed by the rank partisanship that 
has been on display here. We cannot be 
the greatest deliberative body when we 
kick things off by issuing letters to the 
media instead of coming together to 
set the parameters of the trial and ne-
gotiate in good faith on how we should 
proceed. 
For all the talk of impartiality, it is 
clear to me that few in this Chamber 
approached this with a genuinely open 
mind. Some have been calling for the 
President to be impeached for years. 
Indeed, we saw just today clips that in-
dicate headlines 19 minutes after the 
President was sworn into office calling 
for his impeachment. Others in this 
Chamber saw little need to even con-
sider the arguments from the House be-
fore stating their intentions to acquit. 
Over the course of the past few 
weeks, we have all seen the videos from 
20 years ago where Members who were 
present during the Clinton trial took 
the exact opposite stance than they 
take today. That level of hypocrisy is 
astounding, even for a place like Wash-
ington, DC. 
The President’s behavior was shame-
ful and wrong. His personal interests 
do not take precedence over those of 
this great Nation. The President has 
the responsibility to uphold the integ-
rity and the honor of the office, not 
just for himself but for all future Presi-
dents. Degrading the office by actions 
or even name-calling weakens it for fu-
ture Presidents, and it weakens our 
country. 
All of this rotted foundation of the 
process—all of this—led to the conclu-
sion that I reached several days ago 
that there would be no fair trial. While 
this trial was held here in this Senate, 
it was really litigated in the court of 
public opinion. For half the country, 
they had already decided there had 
been far too much process; they consid-
ered the entire impeachment inquiry to 
be baseless, and they thought that the 
Senate should have just dismissed the 
case as soon as it reached us. 
Then, for the other half, no matter 
how many witnesses were summoned or 
deposed, no matter how many docu-
ments were produced, the only way— 
the only way—the trial could have 
been considered fair was if it resulted 
in the President’s removal from office. 
During the month that the House de-
clined to transmit the articles to the 
Senate, the demon of faction extended 
his scepter, the outcome became clear, 
and a careless media cheerfully tried to 
put out the fires with gasoline. We de-
bated witnesses instead of the case be-
fore the Senate. Rather than the Presi-
dent’s conduct, the focus turned to how 
a lack of additional witnesses could be 
used to undermine any final conclu-
sion. What started with political initia-
tives that degraded the Office of the 
President and left the Congress wal-
lowing in partisan mud threatened to 
drag the last remaining branch of gov-
ernment down along with us. 
Mr. President, I have taken tough 
votes before to uphold the integrity of 
our courts, and when it became clear 
that a tie vote here in the Senate 
would simply be used to burn down our 
third branch of government for par-
tisan 
political 
purposes, 
I 
said 
‘‘enough’’—just ‘‘enough.’’ 
The response to the President’s be-
havior is not to disenfranchise nearly 
63 million Americans and remove him 
from the ballot. The House could have 
pursued censure and not immediately 
jumped to the remedy of last resort. I 
cannot vote to convict. The Constitu-
tion provides for impeachment but does 
not demand it in all instances. An in-
cremental first step: to remind the 
President that, as Montesquieu said, 
‘‘Political virtue is a renunciation of 
oneself,’’ and this requires ‘‘a contin-
uous preference of the public interest 
over one’s own.’’ 
Removal from office and being barred 
from ever holding another office of 
honor, trust, or profit under the United 
States is the political death penalty. 
The President’s name is on ballots that 
have already been cast. The voters will 
pronounce a verdict in 9 months, and 
we must trust their judgment. 
This process has been the apotheosis 
of the problem of congressional abdica-
tion. Through the refusal to exercise 
war powers or relinquishing the power 
of the purse, selective oversight, and 
an unwillingness to check emergency 
declarations designed to skirt Con-
gress, we have failed. We have failed 
time and again. We, as a legislative 
branch, cannot continue to cede au-
thority to the Executive. 
The question that we must answer, 
given the intense polarization in our 
country, is, Where do we go from here? 
Where do we go from here? I wish that 
I had that magic wand. Sadly, I have 
no definitive answers, but I do have 
hope because we must have hope. 
As I tried to build consensus over the 
past few weeks, I had many private 
conversations with colleagues, and so 
many—so 
many—in 
this 
Chamber 
share my sadness for the present state 
of our institutions. It is my hope that 
we have finally found bottom here, 
that both sides can look inward and re-
flect on the apparent willingness that 
each has to destroy not just each other 
but all of the institutions of our gov-
ernment. And for what? Because it may 
help win an election? At some point, 
Mr. President—at some point—for our 
country, winning has to be about more 
than just winning, or we will all lose. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, as a U.S. 
Senator, I swore an oath to uphold the 
Constitution, and, while sitting in this 
High Court of Impeachment, I have ful-
filled my duty to serve as an impartial 
juror. 
After hearing all counsel arguments 
and reviewing all evidence in the volu-
minous record, including 17 witnesses, 
192 witness video clips, and 28,578 pages 
of evidence, procedural rules, and con-
stitutional concerns, I will vote to ac-
quit the President, preventing his im-
mediate removal from office and dis-
qualification from the ballot. 
A fair and accurate reading of this 
chapter in our Nation’s history will 
conclude that, on the issues of fact and 
law presented to this High Court of Im-
peachment, reasonable and public-spir-
ited Senators can disagree. This lends 
further support to the notion that the 
American people should be afforded the 
opportunity to register their opinions 
by participating in the coming na-
tional election. 
While the Senate worked to remain 
impartial and open-minded throughout 
this trial, it must be acknowledged

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S807 
February 3, 2020 
that a political fever permeated this 
process from the beginning, dating 
back not just to the start of the House 
of Representatives’ impeachment ef-
forts, but all the way back to Novem-
ber 2016. As a result, the House improp-
erly 
impeached. 
Now, 
the 
Senate 
should exercise restraint. Here is why. 
First and foremost, a fair legal proc-
ess is fundamental to our democracy. 
The House managers have repeatedly 
emphasized that no Americans are 
above the law. I could not agree more: 
No private citizen, President, or assem-
bled majority of Congress can violate 
the rights guaranteed to other Ameri-
cans under the Constitution. Accord-
ingly, the President is entitled to basic 
due process rights, and the House failed 
to afford him these rights. Due process 
includes the right to legal counsel, the 
right to review evidence, and the abil-
ity to confront your accusers—rights 
denied by the House majority. House 
Managers 
breathlessly 
insist 
that 
‘‘overwhelming’’ evidence already in 
the record proves ‘‘beyond any doubt’’ 
the President’s continued service con-
stitutes an imminent threat to the 
American people. The House’s flawed 
and rushed process led to unfair pro-
ceedings and resulted in superficial, 
unspecific charges supported by a one- 
sided, improperly curated factual foun-
dation. 
Second, Separation of Powers is a 
cornerstone of our constitutional re-
public, and its preservation is essential 
to prevent abuse of power by one 
branch over another. A majority of the 
House should exercise extreme caution 
when it bases impeachment upon the 
President’s exercise of his foreign rela-
tions prerogatives, which are expressly 
granted to him by the Constitution. 
Additionally, in developing its Articles 
of Impeachment, the House majority 
chose 
to 
circumvent 
the 
judicial 
branch of government in order to clar-
ify an issue of unsettled law pertaining 
to Executive Privilege. Instead, the 
House simply arrogated to itself a 
novel and dangerous new legal author-
ity: absolute power to define Executive 
Privilege, even when the President is 
exercising his foreign relations powers 
granted by the Constitution. 
As with prior impeachment inquiries, 
following a formal request by the 
House, the Federal courts could have 
compelled the executive branch to pro-
vide sensitive documents and wit-
nesses. The House chose to ignore this 
longstanding precedent because it con-
flicted with its political timeline. As-
tonishingly, Speaker PELOSI rushed the 
mismanaged process forward only to 
delay it, again for political purposes, 
before finally sending the Articles of 
Impeachment to the Senate. Now the 
House, having failed to fully develop 
its evidentiary record, invites the Sen-
ate to act as an accomplice to its ram-
rod impeachment and create a dan-
gerous new 51-vote Senate threshold to 
override executive branch claims of Ex-
ecutive Privilege. 
To accept this invitation would be a 
violation of a long-established separa-
tion of powers. 
Senators might be tempted by a 
burning curiosity or crass political cal-
culation to further develop the House’s 
vague and tainted articles, but the con-
stitutional separation of powers dic-
tates that our legal charge must be 
more narrowly confined. To act other-
wise would violate our oaths and dan-
gerously incentivize calculating and 
intemperate House majorities to pro-
miscuously impeach rival Presidents. 
We must set aside our personal pref-
erence because, under the Constitution, 
we are duty-bound by the ‘‘sole power 
to try’’ the infirm articles before us. 
Lastly, 
Americans 
should 
stand 
against any Senate action which abets 
the creation of a constitutional crisis 
through the politicization of impeach-
ment. The House majority’s misguided 
process 
created 
a 
precedent 
to 
weaponize impeachment, a new prece-
dent that will lead to serial impeach-
ments in a polarized America. If the 
House majority had its way and the 
Senate accepted its invitation to fix 
their broken articles, either political 
party would be tempted to impeach and 
potentially remove their political op-
ponents 
from 
office 
by 
initiating 
slapdash impeachment investigations. 
This new precedent would reduce im-
peachment to a mere vote of no con-
fidence, similar to that in the U.K. 
Parliament. During President Nixon’s 
impeachment, then Democratic Chair-
man Peter Rodino of the House Judici-
ary Committee urged that, for the 
American people to accept an impeach-
ment, it must be powerfully bipartisan. 
This has been dubbed the Rodino rule, 
and I embrace the standard. 
A decent respect for the law and the 
opinions of fellow citizens and a con-
cern for future precedent requires that 
I pointedly emphasize what I am not 
arguing, that a President can lawfully 
do ‘‘whatever he wants,’’ that inviting 
foreign election interference is appro-
priate, that absolute immunity at-
taches to Executive Privilege, or that a 
statutory offense must be committed 
to impeach. 
In summation, I have ineluctably ar-
rived at a conclusion after impartially 
applying the law to all facts presented: 
House managers delivered tainted arti-
cles and failed to present requisite evi-
dence to support their exceedingly high 
burden of proof. Therefore, I am duty 
bound to join my colleagues who would 
have the Senate resume the ordinary 
business of the American people. 
The Founding Fathers, who warned 
of the political nature of impeachment, 
also provided us a means to address 
dissatisfaction with our Presidents: 
frequent elections. This week, Ameri-
cans began the Presidential election 
process. For the sake of our Constitu-
tion and our Nation, the Court of the 
American People should render its ver-
dict through an election to address its 
support of or opposition to the current 
administration. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JASON OLSON 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, after 32 
years of serving his community in the 
Minot Police Department, including 8 
of those years leading it, Chief of Po-
lice Jason Olson began a well-deserved 
retirement on January 31. 
He became a police officer in 1988 at 
the age of 21, as he was completing his 
criminal justice degree at Minot State 
University. Starting as a patrol officer, 
he went on to spend 18 years on the 
SWAT team. 
Officer Olson became chief of police 
at a time of significant change for the 
city of Minot and western North Da-
kota. The challenges this growth and 
development brought to the fourth 
largest city in North Dakota demanded 
a leader who would advocate for his 
staff and be open to change. The city 
had the right person in Chief Olson. 
Serving on the frontlines during 
some of the greatest challenges to the 
city of Minot, Chief Olson was there for 
the tragic train derailment that spread 
anhydrous ammonia across the city in 
2002 and for the historic flooding of the 
Souris River in 2011. Through the best 
and very worst of times, Chief Olson 
exhibited his trademark calm and col-
lected demeanor. 
Chief Olson credits his success to the 
experience he gained as a young officer 
from the veteran officers who had 
served for decades. Likewise, many of 
the 80-plus employees today praise him 
for the lessons he taught them as the 
head of the department. This includes 
the new Police Chief John Klug, a 25- 
year officer who took over on February 
1, after being chosen in a national 
search. He speaks highly of Chief Olson 
and the example he set as a mentor and 
leader. 
We cannot thank our law enforce-
ment officers enough for their sac-
rifices keeping our communities safe 
and for the bravery they exhibit every 
day on the job. I join the residents of 
Minot and all North Dakotans thank-
ing Chief Olson for his many years of 
dedicated professional service. I wish 
him a well-deserved and rewarding re-
tirement.∑

RECOGNIZING THE MISSOURI UNI-
VERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECH-
NOLOGY 
∑ Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, it is 
my privilege to honor the sesqui-
centennial of Missouri University of 
Science and Technology, as Missou-
rians know it, S&T. 
Founded in 1870, Missouri S&T was 
the first technological institution west 
of the Mississippi. Originally named 
the Missouri School of Mines and Met-
allurgy, the school was primary fo-
cused on educating and training those 
who would mine the mineral rich area 
on the eastern side of the State. 
By the 1920s, S&T had expanded into 
chemical, electrical, and civil engi-
neering, as well as physics, chemistry,

mathematics, 
and 
geometry. 
After 
World War II, as the United States was 
becoming the global leader in techno-
logical innovation, S&T stepped up to 
do its part by adding graduate-level 
training and research. The school was 
home to Missouri’s first operational 
nuclear reactor. Across the years, S&T 
has established itself as one of the pre-
mier technical institutions in the Na-
tion, excelling at teaching and re-
search. 
For 150 years, Missouri S&T has been 
providing the sons and daughters of 
Missouri a close-to-home option for 
world-class technical education. Con-
gratulations on 150 years and here is to 
the next 150.∑

RECOGNIZING MOSS 
GREENHOUSES 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to 
honor Moss Greenhouses located in Je-
rome as the Idaho Small Business of 
the Month for February 2020. 
Moss Greenhouses is the largest 
wholesale 
plant 
producer 
and 
dis-
tributor in Idaho. Founded in 1952 by 
Ed and Ruth Adams, their hobby of 
growing orchids in their small green-
house quickly became a budding busi-
ness as they provided flowers, orchids, 
and flowering crops to their local gro-
cery stores and flower shops. The fam-
ily-run business quickly developed a 
reputation for its outstanding service 
and quality products. 
Today, Moss Greenhouses is owned 
and operated by the family’s third gen-
eration, Kevin and his wife Dana. Their 
300,000 square feet of covered green-
house and three acres of growing space 
allow them to serve customers from 
throughout the Mountain West. Their 
success and growth has created dozens 
of jobs for the Jerome community. As 
the company continues to serve the Je-
rome area, they hope to eventually 
welcome the family’s fourth generation 
into the business. 
Congratulations to Kevin, Dana, and 
all of the employees at Moss Green-
houses for being selected as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for Feb-
ruary 2020. You make our great State 
proud, and I look forward to your con-
tinued growth and success.∑

HONORING SPECIALIST ANTONIO 
MOORE 
HON. DAVID ROUZER 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and sacrifice of the late Spe-
cialist Antonio Isaac Devante Moore, of Wil-
mington, N.C. 
Just 22 years old, Specialist Moore trag-
ically passed in the service of his country on 
January 24, 2020 in Green Village, Syria in 
support of Operation Inherent Resolve. He 
was a member of the 346th Engineer Com-
pany, part of the 411th Engineer Brigade sta-
tioned in Knightdale, N.C. Though only his first 
deployment, he had already won the respect 
of his superiors and his fellow soldiers. His 
awards and decorations include the National 
Defense Service Medal and the Army Service 
Ribbon. 
A 2016 graduate of John T. Hoggard High 
School, Specialist Moore played football there 
all four years. He worked part time at Katy’s 
Grill and Bar in Wilmington where he was 
fondly remembered. ‘‘If everyone else was 
having a bad day, all you had to do was look 
at Tony,’’ said a former co-worker. 
Specialist Moore is survived by his parents 
in Wilmington, as well as four siblings. On be-
half of North Carolina’s 7th District and the en-
tire U.S. Congress, I extend our deepest sym-
pathy to his loved ones and friends. They are 
in our prayers. We will always be grateful for 
his service, sacrifice and commitment to his 
country. He was a patriot and a devoted 
American soldier whose memory will always 
be cherished.

HONORING DALE KLINE 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Dale Kline who is being 
honored as the Citizen of the Year by the City 
of Novato for his exemplary public service. 
Born in 1961 in Winslow, Arizona, Mr. Kline 
and his family lived in many places while his 
stepfather was in the Navy. They moved to 
Exmouth Western Australia when Mr. Kline 
was 14 where he learned to fly gliders and 
excel in many sports. After his stepfather was 
tragically killed in a car accident, Mr. Kline’s 
family moved back to California and settled in 
San Diego. Imbued with a strong sense of 
duty, Mr. Kline started volunteering for the 
American Red Cross when he was just 17 
years old, 
He met his wife in 1979 during a summer 
college course for high school students, and 
they married in 1984. When they moved to 
Novato in 1998, Mr. Kline immediately became 
involved in the community as a Little League 
volunteer and coach for his sons’ teams. 
Later, in 2000, Mr. Kline expanded his volun-
teer roles by joining the Novato Youth Soccer 
Association. In addition to taking on coaching 
roles, he joined its board of directors as an 
Age Group Coordinator, and later served as 
its Vice President. In addition to taking 
courses to become a coach, he became a cer-
tified soccer referee and worked tirelessly to 
mentor youth referees. He was honored with 
the Boys’ Coach of the Year award for his 
positive attitude and encouraging coaching 
style. 
When his sons started high school, Mr. 
Kline began volunteering with the Novato High 
School Athletic Boosters program, which was 
struggling financially. He took on leadership 
roles and led fundraising activities, collecting 
over half a million dollars in donations. In 
2009, Mr. Kline received a certificate of spe-
cial recognition for his volunteer efforts from 
the Novato Unified School District and an hon-
orary service award from the Novato High 
School Parent-Teacher-Student Association. 
Even after his youngest graduated from 
Novato High School, Mr. Kline continued to 
volunteer and support the academic boosters. 
In 2011, after many years of service, he was 
awarded the Golden Oak Service Award from 
the California State Parent Teacher Associa-
tion. 
In 2010, Mr. Kline joined the board of direc-
tors of School Fuel, the Novato Foundation for 
Public Education, where he still volunteers 
today nearly a decade later. He has also been 
the executive director of Tour of Novato and 
Fun Fair for the past ten years, where he con-
tinues provide stellar community service to the 
City of Novato. He works closely with the 
Novato Parks and Recreation, and the Novato 
Police Department to coordinate an annual 
event enjoyed by many near and far. Mr. Kline 
has also served on the Novato Unified School 
District Bond Oversight Committee, and since 
2018 has been a board member on the 
Novato Chamber of Commerce. 
Beyond the positive and indelible impact Mr. 
Kline has on his community through numerous 
roles of the course of many years, his most 
important roles are that of husband and father. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in expressing 
deep appreciation for Mr. Kline’s commitment 
to bettering his community and in wishing him 
the best of luck in all his future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF PILGRIM’S 
PROGRESS 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Pilgrim’s Progress Clothing, a 
family run business in Plymouth, Massachu-
setts as they close their doors after 42 years. 
Founded by Laura Brigida and her children 
in 1977, the story of Pilgrim’s Progress is the 
story of determination and family. The tragic 
passing of Laura’s husband, Peter, in 1962 
placed the family in precarious situation. Laura 
went to work for the postal service and was 
forced to raise their children on her own. 
Years later, a family meeting was called, and 
it was decided that together the family would 
purchase a local clothing store that was for 
sale in downtown Plymouth. Laura took out a 
second mortgage on her home and launched 
a new business. 
Over the decades the family run business 
would evolve and expand to include men’s 
clothing, women’s shoes and accessories. 
Weathering economic turns and an ever-shift-
ing retail landscape, Pilgrim’s Progress contin-
ued to thrive. Customers came to know their 
store not only for the fashionable clothing they 
offer but also for the one-on-one service and 
advice they received once there. 
In 2018, the Brigida family’s beloved matri-
arch, Laura, passed away at the age of 94. 
Upon her passing, her five children, Jayne, 
Marie, Joyce, Carol and Peter, took it upon 
themselves to continue the store that they had 
created with their mother. The five siblings 
have continued to strengthen their incredible 
bond by working together in their family busi-
ness for so many years. Recently, however, it 
was decided that it was time to close the fam-
ily owned store and enjoy a much-deserved 
retirement. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize 
Pilgrim’s Progress Clothing and the dedication 
of the entire Brigida family as a Plymouth 
landmark closes.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF COACH 
BUDDY NOBLES 
HON. AUSTIN SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of 
Coach Buddy Nobles of Ocilla, GA who 
passed away on Thursday, January 23, 2020 
after a hard-fought battle with stomach cancer. 
Coach Nobles served as the Head Coach of 
the Irwin County High School football team for 
the past six seasons, taking his team to the 
state playoffs during five of those seasons. 
Despite his battle with cancer, Coach Nobles 
led the Indians to finish their 2019 season 
undefeated and win the Class A State Cham-
pionship, earning him the honor of being 
named AJC’s Class A public-school coach of 
the year. 
Before coming to Irwin County in 2014, 
Coach Nobles was a high school football 
coach at various schools in Georgia and Flor-
ida for twenty-six seasons, during which, he 
was part of six Florida state-championship 
teams. His impressive career was marked by 
his dedication and love for all his players, and 
he will be missed by all. Coach Nobles’ lead-
ership and fighting spirit served as an inspira-
tion to those who knew him, and his legacy is 
sure to live on at Irwin County High School.

SGT. PHOEBE R. ORTIZ WINS 2019 
USO MARINE OF THE YEAR 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and congratulate the 2019 United 
Service Organization Marine of the Year, Ser-
geant Phoebe Ortiz. 
Sergeant Ortiz was recognized as the 
United Service Organization Marine of the 
Year in December 2019. She joined the Ma-
rine Corps in September 2015. In 2016, she 
completed Recruit Training at Marine Corps 
Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina 
and 
Marine 
Combat 
Training 
at 
Camp 
Lejeune, North Carolina. In October 2018, 
Sergeant Ortiz was one of the first female 
graduates of the elite Marine Corps Mountain 
Leaders Course, this course takes place at the 
Mountain Warfare Training Center within the 
8th district. The completion of the course 
qualified her as an instructor for future partici-
pants within the program. She regularly orga-
nizes events for the single Marines of her 
command and volunteers in many community 
outreach initiatives. 
Sergeant Ortiz conducts herself in a manner 
that reflects the exemplary work of our service 
members. She is not only an outstanding Ma-
rine, but a leader within her community and 
among her peers. I thank Sergeant Ortiz for 
her service, dedication, work ethic, profes-
sionalism and commitment to ensuring the 
safety and security of all Americans. Semper 
Fi.

IN RECOGNITION OF CAPTAIN 
WILLIAM SPRAGUE 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the retirement of Captain Wil-
liam Sprague, Fire Captain of the Eastham 
Fire Department. 
Captain Sprague began his career with the 
Eastham Fire Department in September of 
1979 as a call firefighter. In a few short years, 
he would be appointed an EMT and later a 
full-time firefighter. Always putting the needs 
of the community before his own, Captain 
Sprague played an incredibly crucial role in 
keeping the citizens of Eastham safe during 
Hurricane Bob in 1991. 
He received his degree in fire science in 
1997, and by 2001, after spending 20 years 
with the department, he was officially pro-
moted to Fire Captain. 
Continuing to put his expertise to practice, 
Captain Sprague joined the Barnstable County 
Technical Rescue Team in 2004, where he 
joined regional partners to ensure the larger 
community was prepared during emergencies. 
Captain Sprague brought considerable posi-
tive change and advanced the importance of 
teamwork both within his department and 
throughout Cape Cod. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Cap-
tain William Sprague and his commitment to 
ensuring the safety of our community. I ask 
that my colleagues join me in recognizing his 
hard work and dedication as he celebrates his 
retirement.

HONORING SHERIFF THOMAS 
(TOM) ALLMAN 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise with 
my colleague Representative MIKE THOMPSON 
to recognize Mendocino County Sheriff Tom 
Allman on the occasion of his retirement from 
a long and distinguished career in law en-
forcement. Thirty-four years of Sheriff Allman’s 
career were spent with Mendocino County 
Sheriff’s Department, where he provided the 
County with steadfast and effective leadership 
through major disasters and emergencies, 
while simultaneously working tirelessly to 
make Mendocino County a leader in mental 
health reform. 
Born in Sylva, North Carolina, Sheriff Allman 
grew up between Northern California and 
North Carolina. After graduating from high 
school in 1979, he pursued a career in fire-
fighting with the California Department of For-
estry and Fire Protection in San Bernardino 
County. He returned to Northern California 
and attended California State University, Chico 
and the Fire Academy at Butte College. He 
soon transitioned into a law enforcement ca-
reer with the Fairfield Police Department in 
1982, and joined the Mendocino County Sher-
iff’s Department three years later in 1985. 
After his promotion to Lieutenant in 1988, 
Sheriff Allman made the difficult decision to 
temporarily volunteer with the United States 
Department of State as a civilian peacekeeper 
following the Kosovo War. He served for 12 
months as a police presence in 1999, an ex-
perience which he has credited with influ-
encing much of his later career, and which 
began a long history of volunteerism that con-
tinued throughout his professional life. He vol-
unteered to support law enforcement efforts 
following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and trav-
eled with his local Rotary Club to Southern 
India in the wake of the 2004 tsunami to build 
an orphanage. 
Sheriff Allman was first elected to the office 
of Mendocino County Sheriff in 2006, and he 
served continuously until his retirement in De-
cember 2019. Sheriff Allman’s 13 years of 
service in that role have provided continuity 
and stability for the County through major dis-
asters including the catastrophic wildfires in 
2017 and 2018 as well as numerous other 
challenges faced by the County of Mendocino. 
He has been a tireless advocate for making 
broad structural improvements to mental 
health resources, while prioritizing the difficult 
work of investigating serious crimes. 
Sheriff Allman’s legacy and achievements 
will continue to be felt in Mendocino County 
through numerous anti-recidivism programs he 
spearheaded at the County Jail, including a 
baking program, resume writing course, and a 
robust General Education Diploma (GED) pro-
gram. One of his most significant achieve-
ments was the passage of a funding measure 
for the Mental Health Treatment Act, which 
has raised roughly $10 million to date. Sheriff 
Allman will continue to serve on the Measure 
B Committee as the Sheriff’s Designee. 
Madam Speaker, Sheriff Tom Allman has 
shown throughout his long and distinguished 
career his dedication to public service and the 
people of Mendocino County. He has drawn 
from his personal and professional experi-
ences to apply empathy and problem solving 
for the betterment of the many individuals and 
groups he has served over the course of his 
professional and volunteer life. His commit-
ment to the issues that matter most to his 
community, and his ability to deliver results, 
are testaments to his skill and his dedication 
to law enforcement and public service. I hope 
you will join us and the community, his family, 
and many friends in celebrating Sheriff 
Allman’s many accomplishments and in wish-
ing him success and good fortune in his future 
endeavors.

CLARIFICATION OF CO- 
SPONSORSHIP OF H.R. 550 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, on January 
30, 2020, the House voted on H.R. 550, the 
Merchant Mariners of World War II Act of 
2019. This bill originally provided for a Con-
gressional Gold Medal to be awarded to the 
U.S. Merchant Mariners of World War II in rec-
ognition of their service. When this bill was 
drafted, I was an Original Cosponsor, and 
proudly supported its passage in the House. 
Regrettably, I was forced to vote against the 
bill when it returned to the House. Upon its re-
turn, the bill was amended to include language 
I do not support that would repeal the 2002 
congressional authorization for the use of mili-
tary force (AUMF) in Iraq and a prohibition 
against the use of military force against Iran. 
I am, however, proud to have cosponsored 
and voted for H.R. 5671, which contained the 
original language for the Merchant Mariners of 
World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 
2020.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE PASSING 
OF 
THE 
HONORABLE 
CONRAD 
BLETZER 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the life of Conrad ‘‘Connie’’ 
Bletzer, who served as the Chief Justice of the 
Newton District Court in Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts. 
Born and raised in Brighton, Mr. Bletzer at-
tended Saint Columbkille’s high school and 
later enrolled at Boston College. During the 
outbreak of the Korean War, he left his studies 
to serve his country and enlisted in the United 
States Army. Upon returning, Connie utilized 
the GI Bill to continue his studies at Boston 
College Law School. Graduating at the top of 
his class, he went on to establish his own law 
firm, Bletzer & Bletzer, in 1959. In the 1980’s 
two of his sons joined his law firm and it was 
there that he would develop a reputation for 
being a hardworking, fair, and honorable man. 
In 1990, he moved out of his private practice, 
and was appointed by then Governor Michael 
S. Dukakis, to serve as the Presiding Justice 
of the Newton District Court. 
While becoming an extremely successful 
lawyer, Mr. Bletzer not only excelled in his 
work but also in his personal relationships with 
family and friends. A true family man, he was 
constantly playing hockey or baseball with his 
children and later his grandchildren. He greatly 
believed in the positive impact of competitive 
sports in his community, and served as presi-
dent of the Brighton Central Little League and 
even founded the Brighton youth hockey asso-
ciation. 
Those who knew Connie knew him as a 
good man, full of kindness and the desire to 
help others through the legal system. Mr. 
Bletzer passed away on the 29th of Decem-
ber, in the comfort of his family and friends, 
yet his legacy in the Newton community lives 
on. He is survived by his loving wife, Paula, 
six children, fifteen grandchildren, and five 
great-grandchildren. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in recog-
nizing his commitment to his local community 
and the people of Massachusetts.

HONORING N. ERIC WEISS, PH.D. 
IN 
CELEBRATION 
OF 
HIS 
RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, N. Eric 
Weiss, Ph.D., a specialist in financial econom-
ics, retired from the Government and Finance 
Division ofthe Congressional Research Serv-
ice (CRS) at the Library of Congress on Janu-
ary 3, 2020. In addition to his 15 years at 
CRS, Dr. Weiss also worked as an economist 
and econometrician at the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development’s Office of 
Policy Development and Research for 12 
years and the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
for 3 years, for a total of 30 years’ service to 
the American people. CRS and the Congress 
have lost an exceptionally able and dedicated 
public servant with his departure. 
A native of Massachusetts, Dr. Weis earned 
a bachelor’s degree from Cornell University in 
economics and government; he earned a mas-
ter of arts and doctorate of philosophy, both in 
economics, from Washington University in St. 
Louis. Dr. Weiss began his career teaching 
microeconomics to MBA and undergraduate 
students at the University of North Carolina at 
Charlotte, and although he left academia for 
federal service, he returned occasionally to 
teach at the Institute for Urban Studies at the 
University of Maryland at College Park and the 
Department of Finance and Real Estate at the 
Kogod College of Business at American Uni-
versity. Prior to joining CRS, Dr. Weiss also 
worked in the private sector, providing data 
management and programming services to cli-
ents such as Fannie Mae and various federal 
agencies. 
Dr. Weiss joined CRS in September 2005 
as a specialist in financial economics, initially 
with a concentration in small business lending. 
He retooled his research portfolio as the hous-
ing finance crisis of 2008 to 2009 developed, 
bringing his nationally-recognized expertise to 
the forefront as CRS supported Congress in 
responding to a range of housing-related pol-
icy issues, including the state of the housing 
and mortgage markets and the effectiveness 
of federal policies toward home ownership. 
During this period, he provided targeted anal-
ysis for Members and staff on the activities of 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government 
sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to provide li-
quidity in the mortgage market and promote 
homeownership for underserved groups and 
locations. In reports and memoranda for, and 
personal briefings with, Members and staff, he 
provided insightful analysis and detailed infor-
mation on the costs, benefits, and risks of the 
GSEs, along with their impact on the housing 
and mortgage markets particularly after being 
placed under conservatorship. 
During this period, Dr. Weiss worked closely 
with Congress as it drafted the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act of 2010. For legislation and oversight 
hearings, he briefed Members and staffers on 
current issues and policy options. Dr. Weiss’s 
published work for CRS demonstrated a de-
tailed understanding of the complex and sig-
nificant policy issues surrounding these institu-
tions and their operations, winning him praise 
and achievement awards from CRS. 
In addition to his primary coverage areas at 
CRS, Dr. Weiss (along with fellow colleague 
Dr. Edward ‘‘Ted’’ V. Murphy) authored ‘‘Con-
gress and Financial Crises,’’ U.S. Congress, 
Senate Committee on Rules and Administra-
tion, The Evolving Congress, committee print, 
prepared by Congressional Research Service, 
113th Cong., 2nd sess., December 2014, S. 
Prt. 113–30 (Washington: GPO, 2014), pp. 
325–352, which provided historical docu-
mentation of Congress’ responses to financial 
crises. Dr. Weiss was also active in profes-
sional associations, including the American 
Economics Association, the American Real 
Estate and Urban Economics Association, and 
Women in Housing Finance. He has been a 
regular participant in, and contributor to, nu-
merous academic conferences in his fields of 
expertise. 
Away from the office, Dr. Weiss and his 
wife, Sheila, are the proud parents of two 
adult daughters—Holly and Andrea. In addition 
to having more time with family during retire-
ment, he plans to pursue his numerous rec-
reational, artistic, and social interests, includ-
ing photography, scuba diving around the 
world, running, woodworking, and membership 
in a CRS staff book club. 
On behalf of the Members of the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee, I express my deep appre-
ciation to Dr. Weiss for his many years of 
service to Congress and the American people. 
I wish him good luck and Godspeed as he 
completes his professional career and opens a 
new chapter in a life of commendable public 
service and rewarding personal achievement.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. C.W. 
MILLER 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Mr. C.W. Miller, who is 
retiring as the Assistant Chief after 56 years of 
dedication with Gloucester County Fire and 
Rescue. Mr. Miller’s compassionate service to 
the community is not lost on me or the great 
people of Virginia’s First District. 
Raised in Harcum, Virginia, C.W. grew up in 
a tight-knit community where neighborly love 
was a way of life. As a motivated and selfless 
person, C.W. could not resist the call of duty 
and joined the Fire and Rescue squad in 
1964. After over a decade with Gloucester 
County, Miller’s achievements did not go un-
noticed, and was duly elected as the Assistant 
Chief in 1978. Since his promotion, Mr. Miller 
continued to ceaselessly serve and contribute 
to his community by responding to those in 
need. According to many of Miller’s close 
friends and colleagues, he is a warm-hearted 
man with a passion to serve. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Miller has worked through 
thick and thin during his career. His steadfast-
ness and compassion are worthy of admiration 
and emulation. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in recognizing Mr. Miller’s service 
and wish him the best. On behalf of Virginia’s 
First District and myself, we thank Mr. Miller.

In 75 years of service, Riviera Presbyterian 
has shown inspiration and love to whoever 
walks into the church, regardless of culture 
and background. Riviera Presbyterian was the 
first Anglo Presbyterian congregation to wel-
come a black man into pastoral leadership 
and ordained the first woman of the Pres-
byterian Church in South Florida. May the 
church continue to break barriers while assist-
ing our beautiful community. 
I’m deeply grateful to Riviera Presbyterian 
Church for its hard work and dedication to the 
Miami community.

HONORING MR. RONALD EDWARDS 
HON. ILHAN OMAR 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
mourn the passing of a prominent Civil Rights 
activist, leader and advocate Ronald Edwards. 
He truly loved Minneapolis and is deeply ap-
preciated and treasured by the people of Min-
neapolis. 
Born in Kansas City, Missouri, during the 
Jim Crow segregation era, Mr. Edwards had 
early experiences of racial inequality growing 
up in the south. Mr. Edwards moved to the 
Twin Cities with his father, who worked on the 
railroad. Mr. Edwards always fought against 
racial inequality and injustices not only for the 
Black community but for everyone. During his 
lifetime, Mr. Edwards was the longest-serving 
chair of the Minneapolis Urban League, was 
prominent leader for the Minneapolis NAACP, 
led the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission, 
and also sat on numerous civic boards and 
panels. For the past ten years, Mr. Edwards 
co-hosted a radio program where he used his 
platform to hold people in power and in the 
community accountable. 
Mr. Edwards was deeply dedicated to his 
family, friends, and community. He fought pas-
sionately for the Minneapolis community and 
used his tight connections within our neighbor-
hoods to help those in need. I ask that we re-
member the spirit and passion for equality and 
justice that Ronald Edwards helped shape in 
the city of Minneapolis. 
HONORING THE CAREER OF TOM 
NASSIF UPON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service of Tom Nassif, as his serv-
ice as President and CEO of Western Grow-
ers comes to an end. 
The career of Tom Nassif has been defined 
by strong consistent advocacy for growers of 
produce in the western United States. The na-
tional discourse on immigration, trade, and 
water policy has been distinctly shaped by his 
work for more than four decades. 
Tom Nassif received a Bachelor of Science 
degree in Business Administration from Cali-
fornia State University, Los Angeles and his 
Juris Doctorate from California Western Uni-
versity, School of Law in San Diego, Cali-
fornia. 
Nassif has set himself apart by serving in a 
multitude of prestigious positions. He was a 
labor attorney for the agricultural industry, and 
most notably, one of the first attorneys to try 
a case before the Agricultural Labor Relations 
Board. In President Ronald Reagan’s adminis-
tration, he was appointed Deputy and Acting 
Chief of Protocol for the White House. In 
1983, he was promoted to Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State for Near East and South 
Asian affairs. After two years, President 
Reagan appointed him to be his ambassador 
to the Kingdom of Morocco. After his term, he 
moved on to work as chairman of Gulf Inter-
state Engineering in Houston. Next, he be-
came managing partner of Aequitas Inter-
national Consulting, an international business 
and political consulting company. 
In February of 2002, Nassif became Presi-
dent and CEO of Western Growers. In 2013, 
he utilized his legal skills to help produce an 
immigration bill that passed in the Senate. Not 
only that, under his leadership, he assisted 
with the first time specialty crops received rec-
ognition in federal policy, with the passage of 
Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act as part of 
an agriculture appropriations bill. He also was 
a huge contributor for the specialty crop provi-
sions in the Farm Bill. Nassif was named the 
Western Growers’ 2019 Award of Honor in 
recognition of his unique approach and impact 
on the produce industry. This is the highest 
recognition of achievement in the industry. 
Tom Nassif has left his mark by advocating 
for transparency and quality service. Nassif’s 
affinity for protecting farms has directly re-
sulted in laws and programs that will carry on 
his legacy in the industry. He has commitment 
to creating programs to address areas like 
food safety and technology that are state of 
the art. 
Now, Nassif serves on the Agricultural Pol-
icy Advisory Committee in Washington, D.C. 
and is one of the three national co-chairs for 
the Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing the service of Mr. Tom 
Nassif and wish him the best in his well-de-
served retirement.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SCHOOL 
COUNSELING WEEK 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the tireless work of school coun-
selors across the country and in the 38th dis-
trict of California that I am honored to rep-
resent. These public servants help develop 
well-rounded 
students 
by 
guiding 
them 
through their academic, social-emotional, and 
career development. 
Humberto Solorio, a counselor at California 
High School in Whittier, California, is exactly 
the 
type 
of 
champion 
students 
need. 
Humberto has been a counselor at the school 
for eighteen years and has been instrumental 
in the lives of the students he works with in 
the school and its Business Academy. 
He is also a Program Lead for the school’s 
Fresh Air Mentoring program, which is a new 
creative and strategic intervention program at 
California High School. The program provides 
support 
to 
at-promise 
male 
students. 
Humberto, along with a team of counselors 
and teachers, help these students by teaching 
healthy coping strategies, planning for life after 
high school, and building authentic and gen-
uine relationships. 
Counselors, like Humberto, provide so much 
for our students. Not only do they help with 
career and college choices, but they are often 
the ones who help students cope with serious 
and common challenges of growing up, includ-
ing peer pressure, bullying, mental health 
issues, trauma, disciplinary problems, and 
more. Unfortunately, the average student- 
counselor-ratio is 442-to-1 nationally which is 
almost double the American School Counselor 
Association recommended ratio of 250-to-1. 
Our students deserve to have the support of 
school counselors, and school counselors de-
serve our support. 
That is why I am proud to introduce a reso-
lution to designate the week of February 3, 
2020, through February 7, 2020, as National 
School Counseling Week. I ask that all Mem-
bers join me in recognizing the extraordinary 
work and dedication our school counselors 
have done to better the lives of young stu-
dents.

THE LIFE OF REVEREND DR. 
WALLACE HARTSFIELD, SR. 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 3, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life 
and memory of the late Reverend Dr. Wallace 
Hartsfield, Sr., a prominent religious and civil 
rights leader who devoted his life to the uplift-
ing of mankind. Rev. Hartsfield’s passion for 
community was only rivaled by the fierce ado-
ration he had for his wife, four children, and 
many grandchildren. On Thursday, January 
23, 2020, Rev. Hartsfield passed away after a 
deeply inspiring ninety years of life. 
Born on November 13, 1929 in Atlanta, 
Georgia, Rev. Hartsfield was an only child, 
raised by his mother in Jacksonville, Florida. 
Reverend Hartsfield proudly served his coun-
try, completing a three-year tour of duty with 
the United States Armed Services in the Phil-
ippines before going on to attend Clark Col-
lege, where he graduated in 1954. Rev. 
Hartsfield later earned his Master of Divinity 
from Gammon Theological Seminary and went 
on to serve churches in South Carolina, Geor-
gia, Florida, and Wichita before settling in 
Kansas City. He served as senior pastor of 
Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church, one of 
Kansas 
City’s 
largest 
African-American 
churches, from 1962 to 1968 and again from 
1972 until his retirement in 2008. Rev. 
Hartsfield’s son, Pastor Wallace S. Hartsfield, 
II succeeded his father’s tenure at Metropoli-
tan Missionary Baptist and continues the leg-
acy of faith and leadership that his father es-
tablished. 
In connection to his lengthy and dedicated 
career of spiritual work, Rev. Hartsfield played 
a crucial role in the civil rights movement. 
Growing up in the segregated south, he was 
no stranger to the dark and deeply painful re-
alities of our nation’s history. Rev. Hartsfield 
committed himself to the fight for a more just 
world, using the negative experiences he en-
dured and witnessed as motivation in the fight 
for equality and a better life for African Ameri-
cans. Marching alongside Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. and working with Reverend Jesse 
Jackson on the PUSH campaign to improve 
economic opportunities for African Americans, 
Rev. Hartsfield embodied true leadership, 
compassion, and activism. 
In all that he approached, Rev. Hartsfield 
did so with a fervent passion and steadfast 
desire for change. By serving on local, re-
gional, and national boards, including as 
Chairman of the Congress of National Black 
Churches and President of the Baptist Min-
isters Union, creating the Concerned Clergy 
Coalition in an effort to combat crime, and 
leading a multi-million dollar campaign for 
Kansas City health centers, Rev. Hartsfield 
proved time and time again that he was truly 
a man of unparalleled dedication. 
As an unwavering voice for doing what was 
morally just, Rev. Hartsfield helped to posi-
tively shape the future for generations to 
come. By serving as a beacon of light through 
dark moments in our history and ushering in 
hope in times of hopelessness, Rev. Hartsfield 
leaves behind a monumental legacy of serv-
ice, courage, and perseverance. 
Madam Speaker, please join Missouri’s Fifth 
Congressional District in honoring the life of 
Reverend Dr. Wallace Hartsfield, Sr. Let us 
carry forth with the same sense of duty and 
compassion of Rev. Hartsfield, always remem-
bering his profound words: ‘‘I may not have 
the power to change things, but I can be a 
voice for change.’’
