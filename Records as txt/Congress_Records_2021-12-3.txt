PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Lord, find reason to delight in Your 
people. Call us to return to You, yield-
ing our whole selves to Your desires for 
Your creation. 
You have told us what You desire, so 
we ask that You would help us to do 
justice, to find opportunities to be fair 
to one another, to seek out those who 
are oppressed and give them voice, to 
look around us, and where there is in-
justice, not to ignore it. 
We ask that You would help us to 
love kindness, not just engage in polite 
discourse or offer a friendly gesture, 
but to look into the eyes of another 
and show them Your love, to go that 
extra mile for someone else’s welfare, 
to speak to someone who clearly needs 
a kind and sympathetic word. 
We ask that You would help us to 
walk humbly with You. God, You have 
called us to distinguished positions and 
entrusted to us significant responsi-
bility. You have blessed us abundantly 
with opportunity and power. May we be 
ever mindful that all we have obtained, 
all that we enjoy, all that we are, is 
from You. 
As we employ these gracious gifts of 
Your providence, may we live into 
Your expectations, into Your desires, 
that You would take delight in us. 
In Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

HONORING JIMMY LAI 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 3, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, on De-
cember 3, 2020, one year ago, Jimmy Chee- 
ying Lai, founder of the now shuttered Hong 
Kong pro-democracy newspaper the Apple 
Daily, was denied bail for the first time. He 
has since been convicted and sentenced and 
will spend his 74th birthday on December 8 
behind bars. 
Jimmy Lai’s life epitomizes the rise and fall 
of Hong Kong’s freedoms. 
Mr. 
Lai 
was 
born 
in 
Guangzhou, 
Guangdong, in China in 1947. At the age of 
12, he entered Hong Kong as a stowaway on 
a fishing boat. He found work at a garment 
factory and rose from an odd-job laborer to a 
manager. In 1975, he bought a bankrupt gar-
ment factory and built riches with an Asia-wide 
clothing chain, Giordano. In interview after 
interview, Jimmy recalled, ‘‘I came here with 
one dollar, the freedom here has given me the 
opportunity to build myself up.’’ 
The Tiananmen protests of 1989 in China 
motivated Jimmy to turn his attention from 
economic opportunities to civil and political 
freedom. ‘‘You deliver information, then you 
deliver choice, and choice is freedom,’’ he re-
counted. In 1990, he began publishing Next 
Magazine with a formula of tabloid-style sen-
sationalism 
combined 
with 
investigative 
expose´s of political and business elites. 
In 1995, just two years before Hong Kong’s 
return to China, Jimmy founded the Apple 
Daily with the catchy slogan ‘‘An apple a day 
keeps the liars away.’’ Against charges that 
the newspaper was anti-Chinese Communist 
Party, he retorted that ‘‘if we run this news-
paper based on hatred of communism, we will 
fail.’’ Instead, ‘‘all we need is to love what we 
love most, which is freedom of speech and 
freedom of the press.’’ 
This love of freedom is, however, anathema 
to the Chinese government’s goals. When 
Hong Kongers protested against national se-
curity legislation on July 1, 2003, Jimmy’s pub-
lications urged readers to take to the streets 
and called for the then Chief Executive Tung 
Chee-hwa to resign. 
During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, the 
Apple Daily was again at the forefront of the 
call for ‘‘genuine universal suffrage.’’ Jimmy 
camped out at the occupy site in Admiralty 
near the Central Government Offices. When 
the police cleared the site on December 13, 
2014, he was among those arrested. 
During the pro-democracy protests in 2019, 
the Apple Daily offered blanket coverage of 
the months-long protests and published hard- 
hitting reports on police abuses and alleged 
police-gangster collusion. Jimmy joined var-
ious mass demonstrations that numbered up 
to two million. 
In early 2020 Jimmy was repeatedly ar-
rested among other veterans of the city’s pro- 
democracy movement for organizing and par-
ticipating in marches on August 18, August 31, 
and October 1, 2019. Such protests were ren-
dered ‘‘unauthorized’’ simply because the po-
lice routinely refused to issue ‘‘Notices of No 
Objection’’ beginning in August. Jimmy was 
convicted and sentenced to a total of 20 
months in prison. He faces more jail terms for 
attending an unauthorized candlelight vigil on 
June 4, 2020. 
On June 30, 2020, the National People’s 
Congress Standing Committee enacted the 
National Security Law to criminalize vaguely 
defined ‘‘subversion,’’ ‘‘secession,’’ ‘‘terrorism’’ 
and ‘‘collusion with foreign forces.’’ The law 
removes the presumption of bail and imposes 
a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, 
thereby stifling free expression and other fun-
damental freedoms in contravention of Hong 
Kong’s Basic Law. Authorities quickly came for 
their targets. On August 10, police arrested 
Jimmy, his two sons and three top Apple Daily 
executives for collusion with external elements 
and conspiracy to defraud (for violating the 
terms of a commercial lease). More than 200 
police officers also raided the newspaper’s 
headquarters and seized box-loads of docu-
ments. On December 3, a court denied Jim-
my’s bail application and remanded him to 
custody. He was briefly granted bail in de 
facto house arrest on December 23 but was 
remanded to custody on December 31 when 
the court ruled in favor of the Department of 
Justice’s appeal. On February 16, 2021, 
Jimmy was arrested under the national secu-
rity law and ‘‘perverting the course of justice’’ 
for aiding activist Andy Li in his failed attempt 
to flee to Taiwan. 
Locking up Jimmy Lai did not silence the 
Apple Daily. After the arrest and raid on Au-
gust 10, 2020, the newspaper published on its 
front page a photo of Jimmy in handcuffs with 
the headline ‘‘Apple Daily must fight on.’’ In 
his last media interview with the BBC in De-
cember 2020, he remarked that ‘‘If they can 
induce fear in you, that’s the cheapest way to 
control you and the most effective way and 
they know it. The only way to defeat the way 
of intimidation is to face up to fear and don’t 
let it frighten you.’’ Journalists at the Apple 
Daily heroically kept up the fight in subsequent 
months. In the end, the authorities could stran-
gle the newspaper only by freezing its com-
pany accounts in June 2021. 
Jimmy said that ‘‘Hong Kong . . . made me 
what I am today’’ and thus he chose to stay 
in Hong Kong despite the severe con-
sequences. In truth, Jimmy also made Hong 
Kong what it was yesterday, by defending 
freedoms for as long as he could. 
Jimmy’s fearlessness has been honored 
with the Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award by 
the Committee to Protect Journalists in 2021, 
the Freedom of Press Award by Reporters 
Without Borders and the Faith and Freedom 
Award by the Acton Institute in 2020. 
Madam Speaker, as cochair of the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China I will 
continue to advocate for the freedoms and 
human rights of the people of Hong Kong, in-
cluding Jimmy Lai. 
RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF 
LONNIE BRAXTON 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 3, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the commendable career 
of a dedicated public servant and important 
figure in southeastern Connecticut, Lonnie 
Braxton. After 24 years of service as the Sen-
ior Assistant State’s Attorney for juvenile mat-
ters for New London County, Lonnie retires on 
December 14th, 2021. Throughout his career, 
Lonnie has been a stalwart guardian defend-
ing civil rights within his community and a 
source of wisdom and guidance through his 
leadership positions within the State and local 
branches of the NAACP. Though the setting of 
Lonnie’s public service has evolved throughout 
his career, his north star has always been 
driven by his mission to assist others. He has 
served honorably throughout his career, rep-
resenting a true commitment to civil rights and 
justice. 
Born in 1948, Lonnie was raised in Green-
ville, Mississippi where he attended high 
school and signaled his high level of com-
petence, joining the U.S. Navy Reserves by 
his sophomore year. Upon his graduation, he 
served 18 months on Active Duty aboard the 
USS Amphion AR–13. After completing his 
Active Duty service with the Navy, our region 
became lucky enough for Lonnie to take a job 
with the submarine manufacturer Electric Boat 
in Groton, ultimately causing him to choose 
southeastern Connecticut as his new home. 
Lonnie went to work at Electric Boat for 10 
years, holding various positions including elec-
tronics mechanic, radiation control monitor, 
property control analyst, and technical admin-
istrator in the material department. His tech-
nical skills and expertise were highly prized in 
an enterprise that adheres to a standard of ex-
cellence. He knew from his naval service that 
the lives of sailors depended on doing the job 
right. 
Lonnie, of course, was destined to help his 
community in a different way—to make sure 
our courts protected the rights of every citizen 
young or old who came into contact with the 
criminal justice system. Following his time with 
Electric Boat, Lonnie went on to further his 
education, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Gov-
ernment from Connecticut College in 1986 and 
subsequently a Juris Doctorate from the Uni-
versity of Connecticut School of Law in 1988. 
He immediately immersed himself in legal 
work, where he gained the experience that 
prepared him for his paramount work as a 
Senior Assistant State’s Attorney with the 
Connecticut Division of Criminal Justice. Since 
1997, he has worked in Juvenile Court where 
he has furthered the agency’s mission of pro-
moting restorative justice, accountability, and 
rehabilitation. Lonnie overcame all resistance 
faced in his career, relentlessly representing 
every member of his community in the court-
room.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1312 
December 3, 2021 
Madam Speaker, on a personal note, I first 
met Lonnie as a fellow attorney during my 
time as a practicing attorney in eastern Con-
necticut. His intelligence and compassion were 
apparent to me during the inevitable waiting 
time that lawyers experience in the court sys-
tem. Based on that friendship, Lonnie in 2007 
recommended a young attorney, Ms. Ayanti 
Grant, to apply for a job in my district office. 
Lucky for me, I offered her a job doing con-
stituent immigration casework, and today she 
is the District Director for Connecticut’s sec-
ond district. I will be forever grateful to Lonnie 
for that fortuitous suggestion of Ayanti Grant, 
that has benefited thousands of citizens in 
eastern Connecticut. 
Lonnie spent considerable time outside of 
his duties as a prosecutor serving his local 
communities. He is a member of the Board of 
Finance for the City of New London, a past 
member of the New London Planning and 
Zoning Committee, a member of the New Lon-
don Schools Truancy Review Board, among 
others. He has demonstrated a commitment to 
the well-being of others and has helped guide 
southeastern Connecticut’s next generation of 
legal advocates and civil figures. He became 
the First Vice President of the Norwich Branch 
of the NAACP upon its founding in 1963. He 
has fought for equality and civil rights for dec-
ades, having been a former President of the 
New London Branch of the NAACP. His work 
has paved the way for current and future ac-
tivists to continue making gains for all resi-
dents of eastern Connecticut. Lonnie has lived 
through and helped foster great change in his 
lifetime, helping lead our Nation’s continuing 
civil rights movement. 
Outside of his career, Lonnie has dem-
onstrated a passion for family, history, and the 
arts. He is the proud father of Lonnie Braxton 
III, who won the gold medal and silver medal 
in tennis at the National Special Olympics 
Games in 2010. This commitment to family 
runs into the past, as he is also the proud 
keeper of his family’s stories and history. He 
is a renowned speaker and lecturer on the 
civil rights movement, African-American His-
tory, and African-American cinema. This his-
tory is crucial to our Nation’s present and it is 
due to the efforts of historians such as Lonnie 
that the Nation can look to the past and con-
tinue striving to fulfill its great promises. Lon-
nie has also dedicated himself to collecting Af-
rican-American movies from the 20th century. 
These arts have greatly contributed to the cul-
ture of the United States and we benefit tre-
mendously from Lonnie’s preservation efforts. 
Madam Speaker, Lonnie’s contributions in 
administering and advocating for justice within 
Connecticut’s Second District are immeas-
urable and deserving of an equal amount of 
gratitude. His life and career, dedicated to 
public service, exist as an inspiration to those 
who follow in his footsteps. Although his retire-
ment from the Connecticut Division of Criminal 
Justice undoubtedly leaves large shoes to fill, 
he has demonstrated that the principles that 
have guided his career are larger than any 
one position. After such a long tenure in serv-
ice, I also cannot imagine that his valuable in-
sight will continue to go untapped. Lonnie will 
continue on to the next phase of his life with 
his family, his wife, Gwendolyn Bosco, and his 
son, Lonnie Braxton III. To these ends, I ask 
my colleagues in the House to join me in hon-
oring, thanking, and congratulating Lonnie 
Braxton for his successful commitment to the 
public well-being and safety. There is no bet-
ter way to honor such a steadfast steward of 
our community than immortalizing his career 
through the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

CONGRATULATIONS ON THE 25TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
LGBT 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF IL-
LINOIS 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 3, 2021 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the LGBT Chamber of Commerce 
of Illinois on their 25th Anniversary. 
In 1995, Tracy Baim of Lambda Publications 
and Kevin Boyer of Communications Manage-
ment, Inc. saw a need for a local chamber of 
commerce dedicated to gay- and lesbian- 
owned businesses. Joined by three other busi-
ness owners, they launched the Chicago Area 
Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. 
Their goal was to have 30 members by the 
first organizational meeting in March 1996. By 
the time the meeting was called to order, the 
Chamber had grown to include more than 80 
businesses. 
Today, the Chamber serves a roster of over 
300 members, and is still growing quickly. 
These members are lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender (LGBT) business owners, as well 
as ally-run businesses. Together, member 
businesses employ over 2,000 people in the 
Chicago area, with gross revenues that ex-
ceed $200 million. The Chamber fulfills its 
mission by promoting economic opportunities 
for LGBTQ+ individuals in the state of Illinois 
by serving as an advocate and resource for 
businesses that are committed to equality. 
On December 7, the LGBT Chamber of 
Commerce of Illinois will come together with 
sponsors, corporate partners, members, and 
friends to celebrate its 25th Anniversary. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the 
LGBT Chamber of Commerce of Illinois. I am 
honored to have such an exceptional organi-
zation in my district.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
OF THE HOUSTON PILOTS ASSO-
CIATION 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, December 3, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the centennial of the Houston Pilots 
Association. Over the last century, they have 
faithfully provided pilotage services to foreign 
and domestic vessels entering and departing 
the Port of Houston. 
The Houston Ship Channel (HSC) is one of 
the narrowest and busiest ports in the world, 
with 21,000 commercial vessels and more 
than 247 million tons of cargo in transit each 
year. It provides 3.2 million jobs and contrib-
utes $802 billion to America’s yearly economy. 
In fact, more than 20 percent of Texas’ gross 
domestic product (GDP) is supported by the 
HSC. The Houston pilots are responsible for 
maneuvering vessels safely and efficiently to 
and from docks through the narrow and con-
gested Houston Ship Channel. Without the 
knowledge and expertise of the Houston pi-
lots, our great state would not be flourishing. 
The origin of the Houston pilots dates back 
to 1916 when L. Fred Allien and J. William 
Laughton received gubernatorial appointments 
as pilots for the Port of Houston and Gal-
veston Bay. The official formation of the Hous-
ton Pilots Association occurred five years 
later, in 1921, when four more men were ap-
pointed to ensure the safety of ships and their 
crews entering and exiting the HSC. Their 
work laid the foundation for future generations 
of pilots. 
The Houston pilots are a team of skilled 
ship handlers, commissioned by the governor 
of the Lone Star State to protect Houston’s 
most vital waterway. Since 1921, 251 pilots 
have proudly served the Houston Ship Chan-
nel. Their names, units of service, and years 
of service are listed below: 
George Allien, Unit No. 1, 1921–1940; 
James B. Birch, Unit No. 2, 1921–1935;
