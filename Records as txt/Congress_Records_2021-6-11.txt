Merciful God, You have promised to

ness. Come alongside us now and up-
hold us, redeem us with Your steadfast 
love. 
Give us insight into the depth of 
Your wisdom that we would know of 
the blessing of Your counsel for the 
plans we make. May we understand the 
purpose for which You have designed 
this day. When we find ourselves dis-
couraged, encourage us with a word 
from You. When we deceive ourselves, 
assuming we can do everything on our 
own, correct us with Your instruction 
and open our hearts to the assistance 
You provide through the colleagues 
You have sat on this journey with us. 
And when we sin, call us back to You. 
Today, we promise to be faithful. 
This day we are determined to live in 
the way You would have us live. Now 
hold us accountable to our word and 
show us how to live according to Your 
own. 
We pray this in the strength of Your 
name. 
Amen.

HONORING JERRY MCNULTY 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of James Gerard McNulty Jr., who 
passed away on May 23, 2021. Jerry was 
committed 
to 
improving 
western 
Virginia 
through volunteer and charitable work. 
Jerry was born on October 12, 1938 in 
Binghamton, New York to Elise and James 
McNulty. After graduating from Michigan Tech 
University, he moved to western Virginia with 
his wife Colleen. He worked at General Elec-
tric in Salem, where he led the Drives Sys-
tems division. 
I first came to know Jerry through his in-
volvement with the Roanoke Valley Aquatic 
Association. Other causes and organizations 
to which he devoted his time and support in-
cluded the Smith Mountain Lake Lions Club, 
Lake Christian Ministries, and the Smith 
Mountain Lake Homes Tour. A 2016 story in 
the local Laker Weekly profiled Jerry and Col-
leen’s generous support of their neighbors 
through Lake Christian Ministries’ food pantry, 
helping to feed those in need in the area. 
Jerry’s survivors include his wife of 60 
years, Colleen; his children, Kate McNulty and 
spouse, Jeff Johnson, Lori McNulty and hus-
band, Ernie Sigala, Terry McNulty, and Mi-
chael McNulty and wife, Mandy; his grand-
children, Justin Johnson, Ciaran McNulty, 
Logan Pope, Sable McNulty, Caitlin McNulty, 
Sophia McNulty, and Indy McNulty; and his 
siblings Mary Gillette, Kay McNulty, John 
McNulty and wife, Larraine, Gene McNulty and 
spouse, Kathy, and Terry Blood. I offer them 
my condolences on their loss.

IN RECOGNITION OF G. HENRY 
COOK 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize G. Henry Cook as 
he is inducted into the Greater Johnstown/ 
Cambria County Business Hall of Fame, which 
honors leaders who have contributed to our 
region’s economic development and commu-
nity enrichment. 
Throughout his life, Mr. Cook has dedicated 
his time and efforts to serving his neighbors 
and our region. He joined Somerset Trust 
Company in 1972, and served as its president 
from 1988 to 2017. Mr. Cook has served as 
CEO since 1988 and chairman of the board 
since 1995. Under his leadership, Somerset 
Trust Company won the Cambria County Eco-
nomic Summit Award and was named one of 
the Best Banks to Work for in the United 
States. 
Mr. Cook has demonstrated his commitment 
to our community not only through his profes-
sional work, but also through his dedication to 
service—including as the former president of 
the Somerset Volunteer Fire Department, a 
member of the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium 
board of directors, and as co-chairman of the 
Somerset County Community Foundation. He 
also was an integral leader in the creation of 
the Flight 93 National Memorial. 
Additionally, Mr. Cook has invested in men-
toring future generations. He has served as an 
adjunct associate professor at the University 
of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, Saint Vincent Col-
lege, and Saint Francis University, in addition 
to teaching courses for the Small Business 
Development Center and the American Insti-
tute of Banking. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I congratulate G. Henry Cook 
and thank him for his outstanding commitment 
to our community. His hard work and dedica-
tion have made an indelible impact on the 
Johnstown community and beyond. As he is 
inducted into the Greater Johnstown/Cambria 
County Business Hall of Fame, I wish Mr. 
Cook continued health, happiness, and suc-
cess in the chapters to come.

MICHAEL R. ALTENBERG 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Michael R. Altenberg who 
passed away on May 19, 2021. 
Mike was born in Chicago to Jerome and 
Goldie Altenberg. In 1951, he joined family 
members and a close friend to start Perlmutter 
and Sons, a prestressed and precast concrete 
company. In 1952, the company bought prop-
erty at 58th and Pecos in Adams County. Perl-
mutter and Sons became Prestressed Con-
crete of Colorado before eventually becoming 
Stanley Structures, which spanned the Rocky 
Mountain West, Texas, Arizona and Canada, 
and employed more than 2,000 people. My 
dad, Leonard Perlmutter, served as CEO of 
Stanley Structures for many years. It was a 
union business from top to bottom and was in-
strumental in building thousands of structures 
including airports, resorts, roads and bridges, 
federal and state installations and laboratories, 
military bases, apartments, warehouses, office 
buildings, shopping centers, and hospitals. 
Mike joined the family when he married 
Roslyn Perlmutter. They had four children: 
Rick (Mary), Jim (Carole), Barb (Steve) and 
Judy (Bruce) and many grandchildren. His 
wife Roz passed away November 8, 2001. 
Mike then married Libby Bortz and for many 
years they have lived among friends at the 
Wind Crest Retirement Community. Mike val-
iantly fought through various life-threatening 
issues over the past decade. 
Mike was a beloved and devoted husband 
and was a loving father and grandfather. He 
never missed a moment in the lives of his chil-
dren and never missed a moment to celebrate 
his wife. He was brilliant, honest, and kind. I 
appreciate his lifetime of service to our com-
munity.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
CHIEF 
ROBERT 
TARDIF 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the career of a distinguished 
public servant in my district, Chief Robert 
Tardif. On June 12, 2021, Chief Tardif cele-
brates an incredible milestone of 50 years in 
service to the Baltic Fire Engine Company, 
No. 1. While it is an honor to reflect upon and 
commemorate graceful and dedicated tenure 
of Chief Tardif, it should be emphasized that 
his service as an essential community leader 
will only continue from here. 
Born in the Taftville section of Norwich in 
1956, Robert was inspired at an early age to 
public safety from his Father who also served 
as a firefighter—in both Norwich and Sprague, 
Connecticut—for an entire 66 years. An instru-
mental figure in his life, Robert’s father served 
until his passing. Five years after his family 
moved to Sprague, Robert began his career of 
public service at the age of 15 as a Firefighter 
Cadet for the Baltic Fire Engine Company No. 
1. After three years as a cadet, he was ac-
cepted by a unanimous vote to become a full- 
time firefighter. The rest is history. Robert 
climbed the ranks of the department as he 
braved years of danger on the front lines fight-
ing fires and assisting in an array of other 
public safety missions including the 1994 ice 
flood, which resulted in significant damage to 
the downtown area of Sprague. Chief Tardif 
was crucial in the ensuing rescue missions in 
that disaster and helped get rescue boats to 
residents in danger of drowning from the in-
credible floods. 
As a firefighter, it has always been ingrained 
in Chief Tardif to put others before himself. As 
a member of the local and essential workforce 
community, however, there was no one in bet-
ter standing to become Chief of the fire de-
partment than him when he took the reins in 
1999. Chief Tardif has not only fought for his 
department against fire and calamity but has 
worked to ensure that his team and depart-
ment are best equipped to serve the public to 
the best of their ability. I know this to be true 
as he has personally worked with my office on 
numerous occasions to attain FEMA’s Assist-
ance to Firefighters Grants to ensure his units 
are equipped and prepared for safety with the 
most up-to-date protective and emergency 
gear. 
When not serving Sprague, Robert serves 
the common good through his work as a union 
carpenter with United Brotherhood of Car-
penters and Joiners of America, Local 1302.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

June 11, 2021 
Through his work as a union carpenter, Robert 
has worked at Electric Boat, a submarine 
manufacturer and economic powerhouse in 
our region, for more than 46 years, serving in 
numerous leadership roles for his union in-
cluding President and Vice-President. Robert 
currently leads Local 1302 under the position 
of Business Agent/Chief Steward—a position 
he has held since 2003. To this day, Chief 
Tardif works to ensure that carpenters at Elec-
tric Boat are well equipped and versed in the 
most modern safety procedures and go home 
just as they came in. He has made a signifi-
cant difference during his time at Electric Boat, 
working hand in hand with the company to 
prioritize safety on the job site. 
We are truly fortunate to have a leader in 
public safety in our midst who serves the pub-
lic good in so many different forms. Chief 
Tardif is not only my colleague in public serv-
ice but a friend, and one who has even come 
to my own personal aid when I was left with 
a flat tire on the road one hot summer day 
with no wrench. He never hesitates to help 
those in need. 
Madam Speaker, it is a great honor to ask 
the chamber to join me in celebrating Chief 
Tardif’s 50 years of service to the town of 
Sprague. Chief Tardif’s inspirational and as 
piling career are perfectly encompassed in his 
own mantra on why he chose a life of public 
service which is that, ‘‘My Father had done it 
forever—and he inspired me to work to make 
a difference—no matter big or small—as long 
as it was helping someone.’’ To that end, I ask 
that my colleagues in the House join me in 
congratulating Chief Tardif for his 50 years of 
service with the fire department and Electric 
boat and wishing him thanks for the many 
more milestones to come in a truly decorated 
career. I wish him and his son Robert Tardif 
II continued success and happiness.

HONORING THE CAREER OF MR. 
JOHN C. DUFFEY 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the distinguished career of Mr. John 
C. Duffey of Fort Wayne. 
As a lawyer who has practiced for nearly 35 
years, John has been essential to the success 
of the railroad industry in Indiana and across 
the Midwest. 
Having worked for the Lafayette-based firm 
of Stuart & Branigin LLC for three-plus dec-
ades, John’s practice has included accident, 
employment, product liability, and real estate 
litigation, with special focus on representing 
national and regional railroads. 
This representation in resolving matters of 
law related to railroad companies has allowed 
the industry to prosper and serve those across 
the Midwest. From 2007 through 2017, John 
was named to the Indiana list of Super Law-
yers. He was selected to the list of ‘‘Best Law-
yers in America’’ for 11 consecutive years and 
named Lawyer of the Year for Railroad Law in 
2018. 
In addition to his work with the railroad in-
dustry, John has handled accident and injury 
claims for trucking companies and represented 
industrial manufacturers in numerous states. 
He has also resolved disputes for large non-
profit organizations, including the Roman 
Catholic Diocese of Lafayette. 
As John prepares to retire, I wish him the 
best for all that he has done after a long and 
distinguished career. This record is testament 
to his service for which northeast Indiana is 
grateful.

TRIBUTE TO KATHY AZEVEDO 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to my good friend and 
former Norco Mayor Kathy Azevedo, who 
passed away on Thursday, May 20, 2021. 
Kathy was a tireless advocate for, and inspira-
tional member of, the Horsetown USA commu-
nity of Norco, California and she will be deeply 
missed by many. 
Kathy proudly called Norco her hometown 
and graduated from Norco High School in 
1971. If you knew Kathy, you know she had 
a bright smile and lot of energy. She put both 
of those attributes to work as a Jazzercise in-
structor and in a leadership role with the 
Norco Chamber of Commerce. In 2003, Kathy 
was elected to the Norco City Council where 
she would serve for 12 years. Throughout her 
time on the council, Kathy was a staunch pro-
ponent for maintaining Norco’s rural lifestyle 
and supported economic development that 
was a good match for the community. 
Kathy’s legacy will be one of service and 
putting the needs of others before her own. As 
someone who understood the value of bring-
ing a community together, Kathy was integral 
in organizing the Norco Fair, the National Day 
of the American Cowboy, as well as the 
Horsetown Parade of Lights and Christmas 
Festival. After her cancer diagnosis many 
years ago, Kathy was determined not only to 
fight her own disease but also to support other 
women who were battling cancer. She co- 
founded a non-profit organization, Support 
Sisterz, comprised of breast cancer survivors 
who raise money to help women who have 
been recently diagnosed with cancer and need 
emotional and financial support. 
Kathy is survived by her husband Danny 
Azevedo, mother Ellen Seiberling, brother 
Lance Seiberling, daughter Stacy Azevedo, 
son Chad Azevedo, and her grandchildren 
Troy Nicola, Gracie Nicola, Reagan Azevedo, 
and Evyn Azevedo. I extend my heartfelt con-
dolences to the Azevedo family, her friends, 
and everyone fortunate enough to have known 
Kathy. Although she may be gone, the many 
contributions Kathy made to Horsetown USA, 
cancer patients and her family will have a last-
ing impact.

IN RECOGNITION OF DOMINIC 
BELLVIA 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Dominic Bellvia on 
his induction into the Greater Johnstown/ 
Cambria County Business Hall of Fame, which 
recognizes leaders for their outstanding con-
tributions to our economic development and 
community enrichment. 
Mr. Bellvia has dedicated his career of over 
60 years to serving his neighbors and our re-
gion. After founding Mainline Sanitation Com-
pany in 1964 and developing Laurel Highlands 
Landfill with partner Banks Wright, he led a 
number of business ventures—including Por-
tage Slag & Cinder, Dial Beer, A.B. Bell Rent-
als, Inc., and Oak Grove Village Mobile Home 
Park. These small businesses have provided 
services to Pennsylvanians and created fam-
ily-sustaining jobs throughout our community. 
Throughout his career, Mr. Bellvia has 
served on local boards including the Tri-Coun-
ty Water Authority board and 1st Summit 
Bank. His dedication to the Cambria County 
community is evident in his work to grow and 
sustain our local economy. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, it is my privilege to recognize 
Dominic Bellvia for his outstanding commit-
ment to our community and to congratulate 
him on this honor. Mr. Bellvia’s work and dedi-
cation have made an incredible impact on the 
Johnstown community, and I wish him and his

HONORING BAYS MOUNTAIN PARK 
& PLANETARIUM ON THEIR 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY IN 2021 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Bays Mountain Park & Plan-
etarium located in the City of Kingsport, in our 
First Congressional District in Tennessee, that 
is celebrating their golden anniversary of 50 
years. Since 1971, Bays Mountain Park & 
Planetarium has been a continuing resource to 
the citizens of Kingsport. 
Since the region’s humble beginnings in the 
late 1700s, Bays Mountain provided for the 
families who settled there with land to farm 
and wood to build houses, a church, and a 
school. From the early 1800s to the early 
1900s, Bays Mountain was the source of life 
for settlers and citizens. In 1914, one of 
Kingsport’s founders, J. Fred Johnson, began 
buying up land on the mountain in order to 
create a lake. The next year, work began on 
a dam with much of that work being done by 
family members of those living on and around 
the mountain. The lake created by the dam 
served the city until 1944 when the city out-
grew the capacity. Over the next two decades, 
the Mountain segued into a source of suste-
nance for its citizens to a resource to be rec-
ognized for its history and contribution to the 
livelihood of Kingsport. It was this transition 
that in 1965 led to the appointment of a com-
mittee to study ways to develop the mountain 
into a park by then Kingsport Mayor, Hugh 
Rule. After completion of the study, the City of 
Kingsport hired the National Audubon Society 
to help in the design of a park. The National 
Audubon Society’s recommendations were to 
designate the area as a nature preserve to 
also allow hiking, naturalist-led activities, nat-
ural history studies, research, and leisure ac-
tivities such as photography, painting wildlife 
observation and school day-use. They also 
recommended building a maintenance shed, a 
residence for a caretaker and an interpretive 
nature center. In short, the park was to be of 
great service to the public, including schools, 
while also serving to preserve the natural 
habitat it featured. 
Development of these plans began in 1968 
and, with assistance from Tennessee Eastman 
Company, as well as a bond referendum 
voted on by the citizens, the work culminated 
on May 24, 1971, with the opening of what our 
citizens know today as Bays Mountain Park & 
Planetarium. 
Bays Mountain Park & Planetarium is the 
largest city owned park in the State of Ten-
nessee with its 3,650-acre nature preserve, 40 
miles of recreational trails, an adventure ropes 
course, and the original 44-acre lake. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in celebrating Bays Mountain Park & 
Planetarium as a jewel and part of the rich 
history of Tennessee’s First Congressional 
District. 
RECOGNIZING MONICA BABINE 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Monica Babine. 
On May 26, 2021, Monica was presented with 
the 2021 Digital Equity Champion Award for 
her outstanding work in the field of digital eq-
uity. For more than 30 years, she has worked 
on this issue that is so critical to Washington’s 
5th Congressional District. 
Currently, Monica is the Senior Associate of 
the Program for Digital Initiatives at Wash-
ington State University’s Division of Govern-
mental Studies & Services. In this role, she 
works with business, government, economic, 
and community development organizations to 
increase broadband awareness, access, and 
use across the state of Washington. 
Monica has a keen understanding that ac-
cess to reliable, affordable broadband is basic 
infrastructure in our 21st Century digital econ-
omy. Her work to help close the digital divide 
and expand access to broadband in Eastern 
Washington’s most rural communities cannot 
be overstated. 
Monica has proven time and again to be a 
true leader in her field, creating the Broadband 
Action Team model and serving as a valuable 
resource 
for 
local 
leaders 
interested 
in 
broadband planning. As a result of her work, 
more people than ever are engaging to iden-
tify local broadband needs and make plans to 
address them. 
Monica’s focus on rural communities has 
made her an incredible partner, and I am 
grateful for her efforts as we continue working 
together to address this issue in Congress. 
Her tireless work to bring together members of 
our Eastern Washington community, including 
policymakers at every level, is so important to 
help close the digital divide once and for all. 
Madam Speaker, for her commitment to ex-
panding access to broadband, her exceptional 
leadership, and her ongoing work to improve 
the lives of people around her, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Monica 
Babine.

IN RECOGNITION OF FUSA 
TAKAHASHI 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, it is with de-
light that I rise to honor a remarkable woman, 
Fusa Takahashi, for her outstanding advocacy 
for the Go for Broke Japanese American Sol-
diers of WWII Stamp. 
In 2005, three Nisei women from California, 
Fusa Takahashi, Aiko King and Chiz Ohira, 
began a fifteen-year campaign for a com-
memorative stamp that would honor and share 
the story of the brave Nisei men and women 
who served our country during World War II, 
despite the forced relation and incarceration 
they and their loved ones faced. This impor-
tant history was deeply personal for Fusa and 
her co-chairs, as each were survivors of the 
forced incarceration. Fusa’s late husband, 
Kazuo Takahashi, was an Army veteran of 
World War II. He bravely served as a Military 
Intelligence Service officer. 
The women’s grassroots letter writing cam-
paign began as a small but mighty effort, en-
couraged by friends and community members. 
However, through their hard work, the cam-
paign quickly received support from national 
organizations, 
state 
leaders 
and 
Congressmembers. Fusa and her friends per-
severed through setbacks and delays, never 
giving up. In November 2020, the U.S. Postal 
Service announced a Go for Broke Soldiers 
commemorative postage stamp will be issued. 
The stamp was officially issued on June 3rd, 
2021. 
Today, the forced relocation and incarcer-
ation of over 120,000 Japanese Americans 
through Executive Order 9066 is now consid-
ered one of the most atrocious violations of 
American civil rights in the 20th century. The 
Go for Broke Stamp is an important reminder 
of our history and a symbol of the tireless ad-
vocacy and efforts of Fusa, Aiko and Chiz, 
and all who supported them. 
Madam Speaker, today we honor Fusa, 
Aiko and Chiz’s outstanding efforts to honor 
the brave Nisei Soldiers of World War II. I 
thank Fusa and her partners for their dedica-
tion and successful efforts.

RECOGNIZING 
JIMMY 
UKEGAWA 
AS MY CONSTITUENTS OF THE 
MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Jimmy Ukegawa for 
my May Constituent of the Month. The 
COVID–19 pandemic has placed numerous 
burdens on constituents in my district, includ-
ing a troubling rise in food insecurity. As a 
third-generation farmer who has been in busi-
ness for more than three decades, Jimmy is 
no stranger to the stress of business ups and 
downs. Last March, after witnessing so many 
neighbors and friends struggling to make ends 
meet during the COVID–19 pandemic, Jimmy, 
his staff, and partners donated more than 
500,000 pounds of food to those affected by 
food insecurity. 
His effort began when the pandemic first hit, 
partnering with the Boys & Girls Club of Carls-
bad and Carlsbad Senior Center to ensure 
children and those most vulnerable had some-
thing to eat. Since then, Jimmy’s food dona-
tion efforts have grown to include Head Start 
programs, North County Lifeline, schools, and 
affordable living residences throughout Carls-
bad, Oceanside, and Vista. Additionally, as the 
course of the pandemic played out, Jimmy 
wanted to make sure vulnerable and at-risk 
people in the district could still shop for nutri-
tious fresh food, so he created an open-air 
market in his warehouse. 
Over the course of this pandemic, I wit-
nessed first-hand, residents lining up for food 
just to place a nourishing meal on the table for 
their families. I am incredibly grateful for con-
stituents like Jimmy who stepped up to help 
the most vulnerable and in need families in 
CA–49. Our community is brighter and better 
because of Jimmy and his staffs generosity. I

Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate fellow Hoosier and my constituent, 
Alberta June Ochs-Lewis for turning 99 years 
young on June 9, 2021. 
Alberta was 71 years married to former Air

Korea, and Vietnam. 
Alberta still resides in Dillsboro, Indiana in

Happy 99th Birthday Alberta.

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
COR-
PORAL WILLIAM JAMES MCCOL-
LUM 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Corporal William James 
McCollum, who was killed in action during the 
Korean War on December 2, 1950. 
Born in Anderson, South Carolina on June 
19, 1931, Corporal McCollum was affection-
ately known by his friends and family as 
‘‘Billy.’’ At the age of 17, he was inducted into 
the U.S. Army at Fort Jackson in Columbia, 
SC and subsequently to the battlegrounds 
when the Korean War began. After enduring 
repeated enemy attacks at the Chosin Res-
ervoir, Corporal McCollum was declared miss-
ing in action on December 2, 1950. It was not 
until December 3, 1953, that Corporal McCol-
lum was officially declared dead, still with no 
knowledge of the location of his body. 
Following the summit between President 
Donald J. Trump and the Democratic Peoples’ 
Republic of Korea Kim Jong-Un in July of 
2018, an agreement was reached to return 55 
boxes of remains to the USA. The remains 
were believed to be those of U.S. soldiers who 
had been killed at the Chosin Reservoir in 
1950. Due to the tremendous leadership of 
President Donald J. Trump, the body of Cor-
poral McCollum’s body was accounted for on 
September 11, 2019. After 71 years, Corporal 
McCollum can return home and rest in his 
home city of Anderson. His funeral service, 
with military honors, will be held on June 19, 
2021 at 1:00 pm at the M.J. Dolly Cooper Vet-
erans Cemetery. 
Reflecting on the life of Corporal McCollum, 
I am reminded strongly of the verse John 
15:13: ‘‘Greater love has no one than this: to 
lay down one’s life for one’s friends.’’ From a 
young age, Corporal McCollum selflessly and 
nobly served his country. The United States is 
blessed to have the finest troops in the world, 
where so many heroes like Corporal McCol-
lum are willing to put on our country’s uniform 
in defense of our freedoms. 
I am proud of the leadership demonstrated 
by President Donald J. Trump, and it brings 
me comfort knowing that families were able to 
be reunited with their loved ones after so 
many years, especially in the Third District of 
South Carolina. Corporal McCollum’s funeral 
service will be held on the anniversary of his 
90th birthday. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be able 
to serve the Third District of South Carolina 
and to honor the lives of those lost in conflict, 
like Corporal McCollum. My thoughts and 
prayers are with his family and friends during 
this time.

RECOGNIZING EUGENE DOLLARD 
HON. JOSEPH D. MORELLE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished service of Mr. 
Eugene Dollard of Hamlin, New York. On June 
9, 2021, Mr. Dollard was presented with the 
Legion of Honor Medal, an honor given to 
those who demonstrate unparalleled courage 
and patriotism in the face of mortal danger 
and France’s highest accolade conferred for 
military bravery and service. In 1943, when he 
turned eighteen, Mr. Dollard enlisted in the 
United States Navy. A year later, on June 4, 
1944, Mr. Dollard participated in the largest 
naval invasion in history, D-day. On that fate-
ful morning, Mr. Dollard sailed with the U.S.S. 
Henrico under the command of Rear Admiral 
John Hall. Departing from Portland, England, 
the Henrico crossed the English Channel 
transporting the 16th Regiment of the First In-
fantry Division. Under heavy fire, the Henrico 
delivered the infantry to Omaha Beach. During 
the fighting, Mr. Dollard manned twenty-milli-
meter machine guns while under attack from 
German artillery and aircraft. Then, under con-
tinued fire, he landed on the beach and ad-
ministered first aid to the wounded. As the 
fighting raged on, Mr. Dollard did what he 
could to assist the wounded soldiers who were 
taken back to the Henrico. After D-day, he 
moved on to the Mediterranean theatre serv-
ing his country honorably in Morocco, Algeria, 
and Italy. Mr. Dollard was then transferred to 
the U.S.S. Chilton in the Pacific where he 
fought in the Battle of Okinawa. During a Jap-
anese bombing raid, he was sheltering in a 
bunker when he spotted shadowy figures mov-
ing on the beach. Crawling out into the dark-
ness, he tackled a Japanese General. Al-
though unarmed, Mr. Dollard was able to over-
power the General and capture him, eventu-
ally turning the Japanese General over to the 
Military Police. After three years of service, 
Mr. Dollard was honorably discharged from 
the United States Navy in 1945. Returning to 
Hamlin, he has lived a full life: running a busi-
ness, raising a family, and leaving his mark on 
the world for generations to come. Mr. Dollard 
is an extraordinary example of commitment 
and selfless service. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Mr. Eugene Dollard.

ADMIRAL 
JOHN 
MENONI 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate Rear Ad-
miral John Menoni on his exemplary leader-
ship as Commander of Joint Region Marianas. 
As the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command rep-
resentative for our region, Rear Admiral 
Menoni has embodied a leadership that truly 
speaks to the best of our human qualities and 
is critical to efforts made in overcoming the 
present global pandemic, facing future adver-
sity, and effectively moving our communities 
and Nation forward. 
Over the course of his 18–month assign-
ment to Guam, the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of 
Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, he and 
his team transcended in their greatest respon-
sibility to preserve the mission of ensuring our 
Nation’s security. Alongside their dedication to 
defending our Constitution, preserving human 
rights, and encouraging opportunities for our 
allies and partners around the world, they em-
bedded a revitalized relationship between mili-
tary and civilian populations across the region. 
Rear Admiral John Menoni collaborated 
closely with the Government of Guam and 
other important community members for a 
comprehensive COVID–19 response, which 
greatly contributed to the health, safety, and 
recovery of the crew of the U.S.S. Theodore 
Roosevelt. He worked tirelessly to cement an 
open forum for locals to identify their concerns 
and work together with the defense adminis-
tration to address them. From establishing 
open lines of communication with local leaders 
to introducing a cultural sensitivity training pro-
gram for all incoming Department of Defense 
parties, he has been a formidable force in cul-
tivating greater understanding among all those 
who call our islands home and elevating our 
collective quality of life. 
With recognitions such as three Legions of 
Merit, two Defense Meritorious Service Med-
als, two Air Strike-Flight Medals, a Guam 
Commendation Medal, and various other cam-
paign and unit awards, Rear Admiral Menoni’s 
service in numerous positions as support per-
sonnel and Commander of operations dem-

Marianas. His determination to strengthen 
community ties and fortitude amid the greatest 
of challenges have further contributed to a re-
invigorated mission of defense and unwaver-
ing freedom in the Pacific. 
Throughout his career and especially during 
his time in Guam, Rear Admiral Menoni has 
given new meaning to the Naval legacy of 
serving country before self. Moreover, he 
leaves behind a lasting impact on our commu-
nity rooted in collaboration and problem-solv-
ing. Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the 
people of Guam, offering my greatest appre-
ciation for his commitment to our country, re-
gion, and island. I sincerely thank Rear Admi-
ral Menoni for his service and wish him the 
best in his next chapter of duty and future en-

REMEMBERING BELOVED BASKING 
RIDGE, NEW JERSEY, CROSSING 
GUARD 
HON. TOM MALINOWSKI 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Carolyn Masaitis, a beloved 
crossing guard from Basking Ridge, New Jer-
sey. Carolyn passed away on May 17th, 2020, 
after a courageous battle with cancer. 
Carolyn was a cherished member of her 
community who spent the last 28 years ensur-
ing the safety of Basking Ridge children as a 
crossing guard near the Liberty Comer School. 
Along with her husband, George, Carolyn was 
a source of love and support to the students 
and families who knew her. 
Carolyn prepared goody bags full of snacks 
and stickers on holidays, gave cards and 
small gifts on birthdays, and always had treats 
on hand for the neighborhood dogs. She 
never forgot to ask how a sick family member 
was doing and continually kept up to date with 
those around her. 
I join the Basking Ridge community in 
mourning her loss. Carolyn exemplified what it 
means to be an upstanding citizen and neigh-
bor. Her presence will be missed by all.

RECOGNIZING 
FORMER 
MARION 
COUNTY 
SHERIFF, 
FRANK 
AN-
DERSON 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor former Marion County Sheriff Frank 
Anderson for 60 years of service in law en-
forcement. 
Frank’s life-long dedication to public service 
began in 1956 when he enlisted in the U.S. 
Navy after graduating from Shortridge High 
School. Shortly after joining the Marion County 
Sheriff’s Office in 1961, Frank moved to the 
U.S. Marshals Service where he quickly rose 
through the ranks. He played a vital role in the 
creation and direction of the Federal Witness 
Protection Program. In 1977, he was ap-
pointed as U.S. Marshal for the Southern Dis-
trict of Indiana where he served until 1981 and 
again from 1994 to 2001. Frank’s successful 
handling of the government seizure of the Indi-
anapolis Baptist Temple earned him the Martin 
J. Burke Award in 2001, a recognition award-
ed to the most outstanding marshal in the Na-
tion. 
In 2003, Frank made history when elected 
the first Black sheriff in Marion County; he 
served in this role for eight years. Frank was 
a trailblazer for diversity and inclusion in our 
community and across the State of Indiana. 
He will forever be remembered for the ‘‘Stop 
and Think’’ program where he provided youth 
participants his personal phone number to call 
before they made a wrong decision. 
Frank dedicated his life to service. He led 
with his heart and persevered through the 
many challenges that came his way. Today, I 
ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Frank Anderson.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF BLAIR DECKER 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the esteemed career of 
Blair Decker, who retires from General Dy-
namics Electric Boat as Vice President of Sup-
ply Chain on July 6, 2021. Mr. Decker retires 
from a long, dedicated career that spans more 
than 40 years with Electric Boat. With his 
service to the company in mind, Blair’s leader-
ship has been central in maintaining the qual-
ity and rate of production at Electric Boat. In 
leading the company’s supply and by exten-
sion output capabilities, Blair’s role has directly 
resulted in tangible benefits for our country, in-
cluding the creation of thousands of jobs for 
Connecticut and Rhode Island’s local econo-
mies and the maintenance of our national se-
curity. 
Madam Speaker, by way of origin, Blair’s 
background is a model example for contrib-
uting to one’s own community after receiving 
an in-state education. After graduating from 
Fairfield University with a bachelor’s degree in 
Economics, Blair went on to receive a Master 
of Science in Engineering Management from 
the University of New Haven. Although he 
went on to gain additional educational experi-
ence from Penn State University and Bryant 
College, Blair quickly transitioned the applica-
tion of the skills and knowledge he gained to-
ward a career at Electric Boat right here in 
Connecticut. 
During his loyal tenure at Electric Boat, Blair 
continuously sought to increase his role in 
leadership positions and level of responsibility, 
taking the mission of this essential company to 
heart. He further developed the skills from his 
earlier education through these new roles of 
responsibility—including his expert oversight of 
Material Acquisitions and Warehousing, Inven-
tory Management, Material Services, Informa-
tion, Document and Configuration Manage-
ment as well as Supplier and Shipyard Quality 
Assurance. 
As Vice President of Supply Chain, Blair 
has been responsible for cultivating the vision 
for organizing General Dynamic’s entire Mate-
rial and Acquisition Value Stream—an un-
doubtedly heavy influx order for the ever-in-
creasing national security demands placed 
upon Electric Boat. At this crowning position, 
Blair has been specifically responsible for the 
execution of design and engineering, construc-
tion, material conveyance, supply chain devel-
opment, strategic sourcing, supplier develop-
ment and product life cycle support, Overall, 
Blair has been instrumental in the progression 
of General Dynamic Electric Boat’s acquisi-
tions abilities, transforming the company’s rep-
utation as a national leader in shipbuilding. 
It is worth noting that Mr. Decker also 
sought to contribute toward the local commu-
nity outside of his impressive leadership 
record at Electric Boat. For example, Blair pre-
viously donated his time as an active member 
of the Board of Directors and Trustee for the 
Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, 
the Board of Directors of the DNA–EPI 
Science Center and the Board of Trustees for 
the Lyme Academy of Fine Arts of the Univer-
sity of New Haven. Considering the nature of 
his demanding position at Electric Boat, Blair 
also notably served as chair of the General 
Dynamics Supply Chain Management Council 
reporting directly to the Corporation’s Chief 
Executive Officer. 
Madam Speaker, Blair’s competence as an 
advocate for Electric Boat’s mission has been 
incomparable. With his departure, our region 
and Electric Boat can find comfort in the 
sound supply chain infrastructure that he di-
rectly brought about. This bright future for 
Electric Boat will continue to mean incredible 
things for the second district’s local economy 
and even more for the stability of our national 
security for generations to come. To that end, 
I ask that my colleagues in the House join me 
in congratulating Blair Decker on his well- 
earned retirement, where he now goes on to 
spend more time with his family: his daughters 
Alyssa and Robyn, and his sister Beth.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOSEPH 
JOHNS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Joseph Johns 
(Schantz) upon his posthumous induction into 
the Greater Johnstown/Cambria County Busi-
ness Hall of Fame, which recognizes leaders 
who have contributed to the area’s economic 
development and community enrichment. 
A farmer by trade, Johns is considered to 
be the preeminent urban planner of the Great-
er Johnstown area. Johns first purchased 
property in what is now Berlin, Somerset 
County. In 1793, he bought the Campbell 
tract, which includes much of modern-day 
Johnstown. Johns was truly the mastermind 
behind the settlement and development of 
Johnstown. Today, his beloved ‘‘Conemaugh 
Old Town’’ proudly bears his name. 
For centuries, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, 
has been forged and sustained by the Amer-
ican values of hard work, perseverance, serv-
ice, and patriotism. This region’s continued 
success is a testament to the vision of Joseph 
Johns and the leaders who have come before 
us. In Congress, it is my privilege to represent 
Johnstown and its citizens as we seek to se-
cure an even brighter tomorrow for this region.

RECOGNIZING THE RENAMING OF 
THE VA ANN ARBOR MEDICAL 
CENTER IN HONOR OF LT. COLO-
NEL CHARLES S. KETTLES 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the occasion of the re-
naming of the VA Ann Arbor Medical Center in 
honor of Lt. Colonel Charles S. Kettles. His 
lifetime of service to our Nation and his heroic 
legacy makes this an occasion worthy of com-
mendation. 
Lt. Colonel Kettles was born on January 9, 
1930, in Ypsilanti, Michigan. His father, Grant, 
was a pilot during World War I and II, so it 
was no surprise that, during his time in high 
school at the Edison Institute at Greenfield Vil-
lage in Dearborn, he took to frequenting the 
school’s Ford Motor Company flight simulator. 
After graduating from the Institute in 1949, he 
enrolled at Michigan State Normal College to 
study engineering but was drafted into the 
United States Army after two years. He later 
returned to the school, now Eastern Michigan 
University, to teach and develop the aviation 
program. 
Lt. Colonel Kettles completed basic training 
at Camp Breckinridge and attended Officer 
Candidate School at Fort Knox. On Feb. 28, 
1953, he earned his commission as an armor 
officer in the U.S. Army Reserve. He grad-
uated from the Army Aviation School in 1953, 
before serving active duty tours in Korea, 
Japan, and Thailand. During the Vietnam War, 
Lt. Colonel Kettles heard the call and volun-
teered for active duty and was trained to fly. 
In 1966, he was assigned as a flight com-
mander with the 176th Assault Helicopter 
Company, 14th Combat Aviation Battalion and 
was deployed to Vietnam. 
During the Vietnam War, Lt. Colonel Kettles 
was credited with saving the lives of 44 men 
when he selflessly flew into enemy fire in Duc 
Pho, South Vietnam, four times with a dam-
aged aircraft to rescue his fellow soldiers. For 
this act of bravery, he was awarded the Distin-
guished Service Cross in 1968. On July 18, 
2016, President Obama awarded him the 
Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration 
in the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and legacy of Lt. Colo-
nel Charles S. Kettles and celebrate the re-
naming of the VA Ann Arbor Medical Center in 
his honor. Lt. Colonel Kettles was a humble 
man, but due to his heroic actions, soldiers 
were able to return home safely to their fami-
lies. With this medical center now bearing his 
name, it will ensure that his legacy and his 
bravery is remembered forever.

HONORING GILES COUNTY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the service of all the selfless men and 
women of law enforcement in Giles County, 
Virginia who ensured Noah Trout was brought 
home safely. 
On May 2, 2021, 2-year-old Noah Gabriel 
Trout was abducted from his church nursery. 
Within a day, he was located by the police 
and securely returned to his mother. The Giles 
County Sheriffs Office and the Virginia State 
Police Department handled the case with 
great care and diligence. Virginia local and 
state police partnered with the Federal Bureau 
of 
Investigation, 
U.S. 
Marshals 
Service, 
Pearisburg Police Department, and National 
Center for Missing & Exploited Children to ful-
fill this duty to the best of their abilities. 
Southwest Virginia is lucky to have law en-
forcement officers that hold their jobs to the 
highest regard and fight vigorously to keep the 
people of our region safe.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
RES-
TAURANT 
REVITALIZATION 
FUND REPLENISHMENT ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund Replenishment Act. This bipartisan, bi-
cameral legislation will replenish the Res-
taurant Revitalization Fund with $60 billion in 
additional funding. 
The restaurant industry has been uniquely 
devastated by the COVID–19 pandemic, ac-
counting or a quarter of all job losses. The 
pandemic has cost restaurants and bars more 
than $280 billion in sales and left devastating 
impacts on the entire food supply chain. Nine-
ty-thousand restaurants have permanently 
closed and hundreds of thousands more have 
significantly scaled down their operations. 
The Restaurant Revitalization Fund, created 
in Section 5003 of the American Rescue Plan 
Act (Pub. L. 117–2), provided $28.6 billion for 
restaurants, bars, food trucks, caterers, tasting 
rooms, and taprooms to recover from the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Within days of opening 
the Fund, the SBA received requests for more 
funding than was available. Just three weeks 
after opening, the SBA received more than 
362,000 applications requesting more than 
$75 billion in funding—nearly triple available 
funding. Due to unprecedented need and a 
lack of funds, the SBA closed the application 
portal on May 24, 2021, meaning there is 
nearly $50 billion in outstanding need that will 
go unmet unless Congress acts. 
Even with months of positive steady job 
growth, restaurant and bars are still nearly one 
million jobs below their pre-pandemic aver-
ages. Dining restrictions still exist in 27 states, 
and consumer hesitancy threatens to prolong 
the hardship with 36 percent of diners saying 
they won’t resume their regular dining behav-
ior until at least after September 2021. Without 
congressional action, tens of thousands of be-
loved restaurants and bars simply won’t sur-
vive. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to replenish the Res-
taurant Revitalization Fund and work to get 
this battered industry back on its feet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E629 
June 11, 2021 
As the President and CEO of the Northeast 
Indiana Regional Partnership, John has been 
indispensable in making possible the eco-
nomic growth and general welfare that Hoo-
siers in northeast Indiana have enjoyed the 
last 15 years and will continue to enjoy for a 
long time to come. 
John led the partnership since its founding 
in 2006. Prior to the partnership’s creation, cit-
ies and counties in the region competed, more 
than did they cooperate, for investment. The 
region was experiencing a declining per-capita 
income and change was needed. 
Thanks to John’s leadership and his vision 
to make northeast Indiana a globally competi-
tive economy, investment started corning in 
and the region began a transfonnation. 
In his own words, ‘‘Working together, our re-
gion has overcome challenges and achieved 
major milestones many thought not possible. 
In collaboration with our partners from the pri-
vate and public sectors throughout the 11 
counties, we have built a foundation of re-
gional strength and momentum that will serve 
the residents of Northeast Indiana for years to 
come.’’ 
John has been described as having ‘‘Un-
abashed passion for all things Northeast Indi-
ana,’’ Anyone who has met him agrees. 
As John retires, I wish him the best for all 
that he has done after a long and distin-
guished career. This record is testament to his 
service for which northeast Indiana is grateful.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF JOHN LEONARD, JR. 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the esteemed career and 
public service of John V. Leonard, Jr, who re-
tires from General Dynamics Electric Boat as 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Offi-
cer on July 6, 2021. While John retires from 
a career in the private sector, his outstanding 
leadership and dedication as a senior em-
ployee at Electric Boat holds merits for main-
taining the public interest as he has helped 
oversee an economic boon at Electric Boat, 
creating thousands of jobs for the hard work-
ing residents of eastern Connecticut while si-
multaneously advancing our national security 
priorities. 
Having earned a Bachelor of Science De-
gree from the nearby University of Rhode Is-
land, John was always meant to apply his ex-
pertise toward the betterment of our local 
community. Before dedicating his career to 
Electric Boat, however, John first went on to 
serve in the Marine Corps, achieving the rank 
of Captain, then going on to attend Columbia 
University where he earned an MBA in numer-
ous areas of concentration. From there, John 
joined Electric Boat in 1980—first as a Finan-
cial Analyst—where he ultimately carried out 
the company’s mission for more than 40 
years. 
John’s track at Electric Boat has been de-
fined by loyalty and an ever-increasing degree 
of responsibility. Receiving one of his first 
major promotions in 1995 to Vice President of 
Finance, John seized upon the opportunity to 
prove his leadership capabilities. In 1998, 
when Electric Boat was experiencing an era of 
downsizing and uncertain financial sustain-
ability, John envisioned a path where others 
had not and earned the company the Block I 
contract with the Navy fortwo Virginia-Class 
attack submarines. His mastery of unconven-
tional problem solving and deep understanding 
of the engineering thought processes led John 
and Electric Boat to lay the groundwork that 
has allowed the company to meet today’s high 
demands from the Navy. 
John’s success and contractually-focused 
perspective most recently earned him the ap-
pointment of Senior Vice President and Chief 
Financial Officer in 2019, which has come 
after his promotion to the Chief Financial Of-
fice in 2003. As Senior Vice President, John 
has been responsible for a wide range of func-
tions at Electric Boat, including finances, con-
tracts, tax, strategic planning, IT management, 
oversight of the facility master plan, Applied 
Physical Sciences and the Washington Engi-
neering Office. 
Madam Speaker, John’s presence and ex-
pertise at Electric Boat will be sorely missed. 
Our region and Electric Boat, however, can at 
least find solace in what his leadership has 
helped create: a healthy backlog of submarine 
construction and the highly sought after Co-
lumbia Build I contract, meaning that Electric 
Boat will be responsible for building out the 
nation’s first ever, next generation sea-based 
strategic deterrent. This bright future for Elec-
tric Boat means great things for the second 
district’s local economy and even more for the 
security of our national defense. We owe a lot 
of thanks to John Leonard’s leadership abili-
ties. To that end, I ask that my colleagues in 
the House join me in congratulating John on 
his well-earned retirement, where he now 
goes on to spend more time with his wife Julia 
and adult sons Adam, Jack, Mason and Max.

COMMEMORATING 225 YEARS OF 
TENNESSEE 
STATEHOOD 
WITH 
THE KICKOFF CELEBRATION IN 
JONESOBOROUGH 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate 225 years of Ten-
nessee statehood. June 1, 2021 began a 
year-long celebration which will rightfully begin 
in 
the 
oldest 
town 
in 
Tennessee, 
Jonesborough, located in the First Congres-
sional District and which was established sev-
enteen years before Tennessee was granted 
statehood. 
The original territory of Tennessee consisted 
of 
six 
counties—Washington, 
Sullivan, 
Greene, Davidson, Sumner, and Tennessee 
(later Montgomery & Robertson)—under the 
jurisdiction of North Carolina from 1777 to 
1788. The counties requested protection from 
Native Americans and the right to navigate the 
Mississippi River but North Carolina neglected 
these territories so, in 1784, dissatisfied East 
Tennesseans formed the breakaway state of 
Franklin, or ‘‘Frankland,’’ under the direction of 
John Sevier, the newly named governor. As 
North Carolinian officials discovered the terri-
tory’s attempted independence, they slowly re-
asserted their authority over the area. Dis-
agreements among rival factions, coupled with 
the North Carolina resistance, doomed the 
state of Franklin, which passed out of exist-
ence in 1788. The following year, North Caro-
lina gave its Tennessee lands to the Federal 
government which designated it as the Terri-
tory of the United States, South of the River 
Ohio, also known as the Southwest Territory. 
William Blount governed the territory and, in 
1795, called for a constitutional convention in 
Knoxville to begin the process of joining the 
Union. Tennessee became the first Federal 
territory to apply for statehood and, after a 
close vote on June 1, 1796, became the 16th 
state of the Union. 
Our Governor, Bill Lee, has declared the 
theme for this yearlong celebration ‘‘Untold 
Tennessee.’’ 
He 
has 
encouraged 
Ten-
nesseans to share their untold stories of peo-
ple, places and events that have shaped our 
state since its beginning. With Jonesborough 
being the oldest town in Tennessee, estab-
lished seventeen years prior to statehood, and 
home to the International Storytelling Center, it 
is only fitting that those stories begin to be told 
here. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating the Great State of 
Tennessee on 225 years of statehood and 
Jonesborough, located in the First Congres-
sional District, on being the site of the kickoff 
of the yearlong celebration. I am proud to be 
a Tennessean and, even more so, to rep-
resent the people of the First District who will 
all be part of the next 225 years of stories that 
will continue to shape our state.

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the lifetime accomplish-
ments of Eddie Gossage, President and Man-
ager of Texas Motor Speedway. Mr. Gossage 
retires following a career spanning over 25 
years at Speedway Motorsports, LLC. It is my 
privilege to commend him for his tremendous 
support of North Texas and the creation of 
one of Fort Worth’s most famous landmarks. 
Mr. Gossage was personally instrumental in 
the founding, management, and ultimate suc-
cess of Texas Motor Speedway. Since the fa-
cility’s groundbreaking in 1995, it has not only 
become a go-to sporting destination for count-
less North Texans, it has also hosted the larg-
est single-day crowd in Texas sports history. 
In addition, Mr. Gossage’s motorsports accom-
plishments include hosting the first ever Indy 
night race. TMS has been the site of major 
music festivals and venue for countless civic 
and corporate events. 
I applaud Mr. Gossage for his philanthropic 
efforts in bolstering the health and wellbeing of 
our community. Mr. Gossage serves on the 
Board of Directors for Speedway Children’s 
Charities, and, most recently, offered the 
speedway as a ‘‘super’’ venue for distribution 
of the COVID–19 vaccine. Texas Motor 
Speedway’s partnership with the Denton 
County Public Health Department resulted in 
the administration of over 375,000 vaccines 
from early February to mid-May. Thanks to Mr.

Gossage’s opening TMS to facilitate large- 
scale vaccine delivery, over 10,000 North Tex-
ans were immunized on multiple days at the 
Speedway’s drive-through vaccine clinic. 
Mr. Gossage’s illustrious career has been 
punctuated by both commercial success and 
charitable service. I wish him all the best in his 
well-earned retirement and thank him for all he 
has done for our community and state.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF ME-
LISSA F. JAMES ON THE OCCA-
SION OF HER RETIREMENT 
HON. FRANK D. LUCAS 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
take this opportunity to recognize Melissa F. 
James, who is retiring from the House of Rep-
resentatives after 26 years of exemplary serv-
ice. 
Upon graduation from Oklahoma State Uni-
versity in 1994, Melissa relocated to Wash-
ington, D.C., to begin her career with the Hon-
orable Tom Coburn, newly elected from her 
hometown in Oklahoma. Melissa’s hard work, 
problem-solving skills, and cando attitude 
quickly made her a valued member of Con-
gressman Coburn’s staff. After starting as a 
staff assistant, Melissa eventually was pro-
moted to be Congressman Coburn’s sched-
uler, a position she held until Mr. Coburn re-
tired from the House in 2001. 
Melissa remained in the House, next serving 
for 10 years as the scheduler and office man-
ager to Congressman Todd Tiahrt of Kansas. 
In 2011, after Mr. Tiahrt’s departure from Con-
gress, Melissa joined the office of Congress-
man Randy Neugebauer of Texas. In her time 
with Mr. Neugebauer, Melissa frequently dis-
played a deft touch with difficult questions 
from both other staff and constituents. Indeed, 
it is difficult to imagine a finer office represent-
ative than Melissa, who embodies the true 
spirit of public service. Melissa proved herself 
to be an irreplaceable member of every team 
on which she served, as demonstrated by the 
fact that she never left a Member’s staff until 
the Member left the House. 
After Congressman Neugebauer’s retire-
ment from the House in 2017, Melissa joined 
the Office of General Counsel (OGC) as its 
administrative director. Melissa took on new 
tasks and responsibilities with aplomb and im-
mediately became an indispensable part of the 
OGC team. It would be impossible to list all of 
her contributions, but among them, she has 
taken a lead role with regard to all aspects of 
office management and administration, includ-
ing with the office budget and computer sys-
tems. During her time with OGC, Melissa 
demonstrated herself to be dedicated to serv-
ing Members, Officers, and employees of the 
House, remarkably trustworthy and utterly 
fearless when faced with novel, sensitive, and 
difficult matters. Melissa’s unwavering resolve 
and commitment to the House and OGC was 
always evident, as was her ability to find a so-
lution to seemingly any problem. 
Beyond her incredible dedication to her 
work, Melissa has been a kind and thoughtful 
coworker to all, treating everyone from the 
Members to the mail-carriers with the utmost 
respect and kindness. As scores of current 
and former colleagues can attest, Melissa is a 
true joy to work with, and is someone who 
makes the workday better for everyone with 
whom she comes into contact. It is no exag-
geration to say that she has become family to 
many over her years on the Hill. Melissa is al-
ways eager to share her passion and con-
tagious enthusiasm for golf—and really any 
sport in which an alum of her cherished OSU 
Cowboys (Go Pokes) plays—so much so that 
anyone who knows her soon becomes a fan 
as well. Melissa’s cheerful and welcoming 
presence on the Hill will be sorely missed by 
all those who had the pleasure of working with 
her. 
It will be hard to imagine the House without 
Melissa. Every day for the past 26 years, Me-
lissa has served the House with unmatched 
dedication and tenacity. Regardless of the 
task before her, Melissa will always find a way 
to accomplish it—a quality that will continue to 
serve her well in her future endeavors. On be-
half of the Office of General Counsel and the 
entire House community, I thank Melissa for 
her decades of service and wish for her a joy-
ous and relaxing retirement among her many 
friends and family in Oklahoma.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES 
ALKIRE 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of James ‘‘Jim’’ 
Alkire. 
Jim was born in West Virginia in 1934. 
When he was 10 years old, Jim’s family relo-
cated to Arizona where he spent the rest of 
his childhood and attended the University of 
Arizona. In 1957, he was drafted into the 
United States Army and served two years of 
stateside duty. Jim then returned to his edu-
cation and graduated from Texas Western 
College. From there, he obtained a master’s 
degree in public administration from the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. 
After completing his education, Jim pursued 
a career in public service. He served as the 
director of finance and assistant to the city 
manager in Highland Park, Illinois, and then 
the city manager of Centralia, Illinois. In 1970, 
Jim and his family made a final move to 
Pleasant Hill, California, where he served as 
the city manager until retiring in 1987. Jim is 
remembered as an outstanding leader who 
fostered positive working environments. 
In his personal life, Jim married his wife, 
Margaret, in 1960, and the couple had three 
children. Jim was a long-time Rotarian in Illi-
nois and California and joined the Pleasant 
Hill Rotary Club in 1970, where he participated 
in many years of invaluable community serv-
ice. Jim was also an emeritus member of the 
Pleasant Hill Community Foundation and ac-
tive member of St. Andrew’s Presbyterian 
Church. He coached baseball for his sons, lis-
tened to jazz music, and was known for his 
sense of humor. In retirement, Jim and Mar-
garet traveled the world together. 
Sadly, Jim passed away in April of this year. 
Please join me in honoring Jim for his leader-
ship and many contributions to our community. 
RECOGNIZING STATE SENATOR 
JIM BEALL OF CALIFORNIA 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor my friend, California 
State Senator Jim Beall. After more than 40 
years of dedicated public service to Santa 
Clara County, Jim recently retired at the end 
of his term. 
As a Santa Clara County native, Jim spent 
his formative years in San Jose as one of ten 
children. He lived in a home where money 
was tight and worked in the crop fields as a 
teenager, learning the values of a hard day’s 
work, self-reliance, and giving back to his 
community. Jim put his passion for public 
service to work at the age of 24 when he 
served on the San Jose City Planning Com-
mission, and at age 28, he became the young-
est person ever elected to the San Jose City 
Council. As a council member, Jim worked to 
fix and update the county’s infrastructure and 
expand affordable housing. His role in creating 
San Jose’s Housing Department was key to 
the development and growth of the city he 
loved serving. Jim’s efforts to bring new and 
updated access to the San Jose Community 
as chair of the Santa Clara County Traffic Au-
thority led him to be the first in California to 
successfully pass a half-cent sales tax in-
crease to raise funds to help build Highways 
85, 101, and 237. Later as a member of the 
Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, Jim 
followed through on his commitment to in-
creasing access to healthcare and mental 
health services and worked with his col-
leagues to pass the Children’s Health Initia-
tive, which ensured every child in the county 
had health insurance. 
Jim continued his public service as a mem-
ber of both the California State Assembly and 
California State Senate. Jim passed major in-
frastructure bills including SB1, one of the 
largest infrastructure bills in California’s history 
which created over 150,000 new jobs and re-
paired and updated roads, and SB 595 which 
supported regional transportation projects in 
the San Francisco Bay Area. He also worked 
on a number of public safety bills including 
passing Audrie’s Law, a bill that empowered 
survivors of sexual assault by reforming juve-
nile sexual assault statutes. As a lifelong ad-
vocate for foster youth, Jim authored first-in- 
the-nation legislation to extend foster youth 
benefits to more young people and passed 
college access bills that have led to higher 
graduation rates of foster youth. Jim also 
championed the cause to improve mental 
health treatment by authoring several bills that 
increased access to such services and played 
a critical role in ensuring California healthcare 
plans included mental health and substance 
abuse disorder treatment. Through his final 
term in the California State Senate that ended 
in December 2020, Jim has worked tirelessly 
and selflessly for his community and the list of 
his legislative accomplishments goes on and 
on. 
I was lucky to serve with Jim in both the 
California State Assembly and in the State 
Senate. I was always impressed by his 
thoughtfulness and dedication to improving his 
community and state. As he moves on to a

new phase of his career, I am pleased to rec-
ognize his incredible work for the Golden 
State. 
For his remarkable accomplishments, it is 
my honor to recognize Jim Beall. His decades 
of commitment and contributions to the City of 
San Jose, Santa Clara County, and the State 
of California are worthy of commendation and 
admiration.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF MRS. KAREN SCHUETT 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the career of Mrs. Karen 
Schuett and her retirement from teaching. 
Mrs. Schuett began her career at Horace 
Mann Elementary School in the Bakersfield 
City School District in 1983, before teaching in 
the Panama Buena Vista Unified School Dis-
trict at Stockdale Elementary School in 1984. 
For the remainder of her career, she taught 
primarily 2nd and 3rd grades at Castle, 
Sandrini, Laurelglen, and Hart Schools. In ad-
dition, as part of the Sister City Program, Mrs. 
Schuett taught English as a Second Language 
at Wakayama Municipal High School in 
Wakayama, Japan, from 1988 to 1989. 
During her career, Mrs. Schuett served nu-
merous committees and held various leader-
ship positions in efforts to ensure the best 
possible education for her students and the 
entire community. She also was awarded sev-
eral recognitions, including 1992 Teacher of 
the Year, the California Teachers Association 
State WHO Award for 2009–2010, and the 
California Teachers Association Member-in- 
Politics Ted Bass Award. 
Two of Mrs. Schuett’s proudest professional 
accomplishments are restoring the Christmas 
lights on Truxtun Avenue as part of a class 
project, which was nominated by the Bakers-
field Chamber of Commerce for a Beautiful 
Bakersfield Award, and founding the Boys of 
Color mentoring program. The Boys of Color 
program was started in 2003 to bring commu-
nity members to the school site to mentor 
young Black students. The program has grown 
to 50 participants and has been recognized by 
the Kern County Martin Luther King, Jr. Com-
mittee, the NAACP, the California Teachers 
Association, and the California legislature. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing the career of Mrs. Karen Schuett and 
wishing her the best in retirement.

RECOGNIZING CAT DAVIS 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, my heart is heavy as I rise today to 
honor the life of my dear friend, Cat Davis, 
who passed away on May 26, 2021. Cat was 
a remarkable soul, and she was one of God’s 
greatest gifts to everyone who knew her. My 
prayers are with Cat’s family as we mourn her 
passing. 
I first met Cat and her mom, Sally, at a unity 
dinner that I hosted several years ago in Spo-
kane, Washington. Cat had bright purple hair 
that caught everyone’s attention. When she 
first approached me, she gave me a big hug, 
and I knew right away that her stand out hair 
color was the perfect match for the clear vi-
brancy she had for life. 
In that moment, not I, nor anyone else could 
have imagined the depth of suffering she had 
been enduring. Under the surface, Cat was 
fighting 
for 
her 
life 
as 
she 
battled 
Scleroderma, a rare autoimmune disease with-
out a cure. During our first meeting, Cat told 
me she needed a stem cell transplant, but 
Medicare refused to cover the surgery. This 
would have devastated most people, but not 
Cat. Instead, her will to live and her desire to 
fight this illness only grew stronger. 
In June 2017, Cat and Sally travelled to 
D.C. to meet with the Director for the Centers 
of Medicare & Medicaid Services in my office 
in the Capitol. Cat passionately shared her 
story and pleaded for them to grant the trans-
plant surgery, and they responded positively. It 
had been worth the difficult trip from Spokane 
to D.C. 
Cat would eventually be granted approval 
for surgery, and with it, a second lease on life. 
I watched as Cat continued to approach each 
day with hope, enthusiasm, and deep under-
standing of the impact a life lived for others 
has. As our friendship continued to deepen 
over the years, she and her mom became a 
special example to me of love enduring all 
things. 
As the Bible says in I Corinthians, ‘‘Three 
things will last forever—faith, hope, and love— 
and the greatest of these is love.’’ Cat’s love 
and friendship will forever be imprinted on my 
heart, and for that, I will always be grateful. 
Madam Speaker, Cat Davis lived an amaz-
ing life that deserves to be celebrated. In 
honor of Cat’s love, legacy, and passion that 
has inspired all those who knew her, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing Cat 
Davis. May God grant her eternal peace in His 
kingdom.

HONORING SGT. NICK ERNSTES 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the heroic actions of Sgt. Nick 
Ernstes of the Hancock County Sheriff’s De-
partment. 
While off-duty, Sgt. Ernstes saved the life of 
a woman who had been stabbed repeatedly in 
the parking lot of a local convenience store. 
After arriving on the scene, Sgt. Ernstes 
acted quickly and applied the proper medical 
attention that likely prevented the women from 
losing her life. 
Thank God for Sgt. Nick Ernstes for his he-
roic actions and for serving our community. 
And I thank every member of law enforcement 
for bravely fulfilling their mission to protect and 
serve. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
THOMAS RAY POWELL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Thomas Ray 
Powell of Ypsilanti, Michigan. His lifetime of 
public service is worthy of commendation. 
Mr. Powell was born on November 9, 1949, 
in Stamford, Texas, to Lantz Powell and Mary 
Falcon. He spent his childhood in numerous 
states before attending the University of Mis-
souri—Kansas City. Upon his graduation, Mr. 
Powell entered the United States Army as a 
medical laboratory technician, stationed at Tri-
pler Hospital in Hawaii. He married Ms. 
Marianne Parizek on December 30, 1971, and 
together they had two children, Megan and 
Benjamin. Mr. Powell received a master’s de-
gree in Health Services Administration in 1980 
and worked in hospitals all around the country, 
including the VA Hospital in Kansas City, Tru-
man Medical Center, Davenport Medical Cen-
ter, Baker Hospital, and the Roper St. Francis 
Health System. 
In 2001, Mr. Powell decided to pursue his 
lifelong 
dream 
of 
teaching 
high 
school 
science. A year later, he received his teaching 
certificate and taught biology, chemistry, envi-
ronmental science, and forensic science at 
Woodland High School and Summerville High 
School in Charleston, South Carolina. After re-
tiring and moving to Ypsilanti in 2015 to be 
closer to his family, Mr. Powell served as a 
long-term science substitute at Saline High 
School. 
Mr. Powell is beloved by his former students 
and family. No matter where he goes, Mr. 
Powell has been active in his community, 
serving as the president of the North Charles-
ton Breakfast Rotary Club and as a trusted 
mentor to countless high schoolers. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Thomas Ray Powell. 
He has supported so many throughout his life, 
and all who know him can attest to his caring 
personality. I join with Mr. Powell’s wife, 
Marianne; two children, Megan and Benjamin; 
granddaughter, Nora; former students; family; 
and friends in extending my thanks to him for 
his lifelong dedication to public service.

TRIBUTE TO IKE BOOTSMA

Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to Eastvale City 
Council Member Ike Bootsma, who passed 
away on Friday, May 14, 2021. Ike was a 
dedicated leader in our Riverside County com-
munity and he will be deeply missed. 
Ike was one of nine children born to Trynje 
and Jim Bootsma, his Dutch immigrant par-
ents who were among the first families to es-
tablish a dairy in Chino Valley in the late 
1930s. Following in the agricultural and entre-
preneurial footsteps of his parents, Ike started 
his own calf ranch in 1975. As the area began 
to grow and local dairy farms began to make

way for homes, Ike was one of the leaders be-
hind the efforts to incorporate the city of 
Eastvale in 2010. In November of that year, 
voters elected Ike to the new city’s very first 
city council. 
In addition to his service as mayor and on 
the city council, Ike represented Eastvale on a 
number of regional government boards, includ-
ing Western Riverside Council of Govern-
ments and the Riverside Transit Agency. He 
also spent considerable time as an active 
member of community based organizations, 
including the Eastvale Kiwanis Club, the 
Eastvale Chamber of Commerce, and the 
Eastvale Roadway Adoption Program. Accord-
ing to his daughter, Metchelle Bootsma, one of 
Ike’s favorite ways to give back was to put his 
big white beard to work by serving as Santa 
Claus at various children’s events. 
Ike is survived by his wife Squeaker, and 
his children Shaun Bootsma, Heidi Tillman, 
Mike Kirk, and Metchelle Bootsma, as well as 
six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. 
I extend my heartfelt condolences to the 
Bootsma family, his friends, and everyone for-
tunate enough to know Ike. Although he may 
be gone, the many contributions Ike made to 
his community and family will have a lasting 
impact.

IN RECOGNITION OF MURPHY 
MONTLER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Murphy Montler upon 
his posthumous induction into the Greater 
Johnstown/Cambria County Business Hall of 
Fame, which recognizes leaders who have 
contributed to the area’s economic develop-
ment and community enrichment. 
Born in Ashville and raised in Altoona, Mr. 
Montler was rooted in our region. He grad-
uated from St. Francis University and began 
his 41–year career with FirstEnergy as a coal 
handler. Mr. Montler was quickly promoted 
and later retired as an executive in the gov-
ernment affairs office for Ohio and West Vir-
ginia. He was deeply involved in our commu-
nity, and his love of the Greater Johnstown 
area was evident throughout his service. 
During his time in our region, Mr. Montler 
served on a number of community boards, in-
cluding the Cambria Regional Chamber, Jun-
ior Achievement, JARI, United Way of Laurel 
Highlands, Johnstown Regional Partnership, 
Somerset 
County 
Economic 
Development 
Council, Enterprise Venture Capital Corp of 
PA, Johnstown Free Medical Clinic, Victim 
Services, Johnstown Symphony Orchestra, 
and Johnstown Area Heritage Association. 
Mr. Montler also served on the 1st Summit 
Bank Regional Advisory Board, the Johnstown 
Industrial Development Corporation Review 
Committee, the Community Foundation for the 
Alleghenies Advisory Board, and the Indiana 
Chamber of Commerce CEO Committee. He 
was a member of the Rotary Club, and pre-
viously served as Cambria County Business 
Hall of Fame chairman. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, it is my privilege to honor Mur-
phy Montler for his contributions to our region. 
This recognition by the Cambria Regional 
Chamber and Junior Achievement of Western 
PA is a well-deserved honor, and I extend my 
sincere congratulations to Mr. Montler’s family 
and loved ones.

HONORING THE CAREER OF MR. 
MATTHEW M. FOGARTY 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 11, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the distinguished career of Mr. Mat-
thew M. Fogarty of Fort Wayne. 
As a law enforcement officer of 40-plus 
years, Matthew has been essential to the suc-
cess and safety of the railroad industry in Indi-
ana and across the Midwest. 
A graduate of the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation National Academy, Class 231, Mat-
thew dedicated his career to law enforcement 
by way of the Norfolk Southern Railway Police 
Department. 
Matthew serves as the Northern Region Su-
perintendent of the Norfolk Southern Railroad 
Police. The upper Midwest is his jurisdiction, 
which includes northeast Indiana. 
The United States has the largest rail trans-
port network size of any country in the world, 
and without Fogarty—and other agents like 
him—it’s security would be jeopardized. He 
has oversight over crimes committed against 
the railroad, which include trespassing on rail-
road rights of way, theft of railroad property, 
threats of terrorism, derailments and more. 
As Matthew prepares to retire, I wish him 
the best for all that he has done after a long 
and distinguished career. This record is testa-
ment to his service for which northeast Indiana 
is grateful.
