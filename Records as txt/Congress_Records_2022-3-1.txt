TIME TO IMPOSE HARSHEST 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
have had the privilege of representing 
Ukrainian Village in Chicago for over 
10 years. In that time, we have become 
friends. 
From my friends, I have learned 
about the beauty of Ukrainian history, 
culture, and the courage and strength 
of the Ukrainian people. In the past 
days, the whole world has seen that 
strength and courage. 
Ukraine has bravely beaten back the 
onslaught of premeditated invasion by 
an evil autocratic leader. In response, 
there has been an outpouring of sup-
port from the entire world. 
But I rise today, Madam Speaker, be-
cause our thoughts and prayers are not 
enough. Of course, those expressions of 
support matter. They hearten a resist-
ance 
that 
is 
outgunned 
and 
out-
numbered, and they tell the Kremlin 
that the world is watching. But when 
you are at war, you need more than 
just thoughts and prayers. 
The people of Ukraine need us to use 
every tool at our disposal to help them 
repel Russia’s invading forces. I know 
many Americans want our country to 
stay out of this conflict. We have en-
dured 2 years of a pandemic that has 
taken thousands of lives and stretched 
pocketbooks to their breaking point. 
No one wants a conflict that could 
make our lives even more difficult. 
I understand the desire to hunker 
down and wait for it to go away, but 
the message is this: You can turn off 
your TV and try to ignore the crisis, 
but that will not stop it from having an 
impact on you. While it may seem like 
the battlefields are a world away, the 
repercussions of this fight are on our 
doorstep. 
The reality is that this conflict will 
worsen supply chain issues and in-
crease inflationary pressures. And any-
one who believes that Putin will not 
turn his attention to the rest of the 
world is badly mistaken. Indeed, he al-
ready has. He is already responsible for 
massive 
cyberattacks 
against 
the 
United States, and he interfered in two 
of our elections. 
Let’s remember, two generations of 
Americans fought for a new world 
order in which democracy prevailed 
over autocracy. For more than six dec-
ades, that victory has held. Now, it is 
threatened by Vladimir Putin. 
We must ensure that the sacrifices of 
our forebears were not in vain. Surely, 
other autocrats with desires to carve 
out expanded borders at the expense of 
sovereign democracies are watching 
the extent of Western resolve. 
Ukrainian President Zelensky has 
begged the West for military aid. The 
U.S. must hear these pleas. 
Thankfully, the response has begun. 
President Biden recently authorized an 
additional $350 million defense aid 
package for Ukraine, bringing the total 
commitment of U.S. security assist-
ance to $1 billion this year alone. And 
NATO has begun to send weapons and 
equipment for the first time in history. 
The European Union is shipping arms 
to Ukraine. Germany is supplying anti-
tank weapons and missiles. Belgium, 
Poland, the Netherlands, and others 
have joined. 
While we are inspired by the Ukrain-
ian military’s ability to hold firm, they 
need more help to keep the Russian on-
slaught at bay. 
As co-chair of the Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus, I have spent months 
calling for harsh sanctions against 
Russia, in addition to military aid for 
Ukraine. I am relieved to see many of 
these sanctions being imposed. 
President Biden has led a historic re-
sponse in which the West has presented 
a united front on behalf of Ukraine. 
Every wave of sanctions has come from 
a coalition of states: halting Nord 
Stream 2, imposing sanctions on Putin 
and his allies, and kicking a number of 
Russian banks out of the SWIFT sys-
tem. 
These are all important steps. Yet, 
more needs to be done. 
I know some of our allies are hesi-
tant to impose economic penalties that 
may harm the Russian people. Indeed, 
the Russian people are not the enemy. 
Like the Ukrainians, they have been 
dragged into this war through no 
choice of their own. Unfortunately, it 
is clear that Putin will not truly feel 
the consequences of his actions unless 
sanctions impact the entire nation of

Russia. It is time to impose the 
harshest sanctions available. 
Some leaders have said that we 
should wait to impose more. My ques-
tion to them is: If not now, when? 
Ukrainians are dying in defense of 
their country. As we speak, their cap-
ital is surrounded by Russian forces; 
500,000 Ukrainians have already fled 
their homes; soldiers have died; civil-
ians have been killed; children have 
been murdered. The time for action is 
now. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
have 
visited 
Ukraine many times. I have seen the 
beauty of their fields, the blue of their 
sky. I have shaken hands with their 
people, heard their praise of democ-
racy, and stood next to their leaders. 
The Ukrainian spirit I saw this week-
end in rallies in Chicago is the same 
Ukrainian spirit I saw in Kyiv when I 
visited shortly after the Maidan. 
Just 2 years ago, I met with the 
mayor of Kyiv right here in this build-
ing. We shared stories about the cities 
we represent, Chicago and Kyiv, sister 
cities. I promised during that meeting 
that the U.S. would always stand with 
Ukraine. We must live up to that prom-
ise. 
Until we do, ‘‘Glory to Ukraine,’’ 
‘‘Slava Ukraini.’’ 
f 
CARING FOR TEEN MENTAL 
HEALTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, kids 
and teens are facing a mental health 
crisis. 
In Orange County, the hospitaliza-
tion rate for children’s mental illness 
and substance use disorder increased 88 
percent between 2010 and 2019. Just last 
year, our children’s hospital saw a 40 
percent increase in mental health ad-
missions in its emergency department. 
On March 2, National Teen Mental 
Health Day, we recognize that caring 
for mental health is a part of raising 
and educating our kids. Communities 
should support children’s well-being be-
fore mental health issues become cri-
ses. 
In Orange County schools, like the 
ones my kids attend, that work has al-
ready begun. Using funds from the 
American Rescue Plan, the Irvine Uni-
fied School District has hired qualified 
mental health specialists. These pro-
fessionals are dedicated resources for 
mental health recovery, and they allow 
counselors to focus on academic issues 
and peer relationships and teachers to 
focus on education. 
Together with the Children’s Hos-
pital of Orange County, schools are 
building safe, comfortable places for 
students to heal. These retreats, called 
WellSpaces, are supported by mental 
health professionals and help students 
with the pressures of being kids. 
WellSpaces are an innovative way to 
ease the transition to in-person learn-
ing after pandemic school closures and 
to teach mental wellness skills. Just 
like with physical health, even the best 
prevention tactics do not eliminate 
emergencies or stop chronic illnesses. 
For kids that need more care, CHOC 
offers world-class treatment. CHOC’s 
intensive outpatient program keeps 
children living at home with their 
loved ones and allows them to remain 
in school. This healthcare delivery 
keeps kids connected to their families 
and their teachers. CHOC built a pedi-
atric inpatient center to give younger 
kids the acute care that will help them 
have healthier teen years. 
Mental healthcare providers are mov-
ing mountains to care for our kids. 
Thanks to the work of dedicated pro-
fessionals 
and 
health 
centers 
like 
CHOC, raising a family in Orange 
County means our kids will have the 
resources to stay healthy, mentally 
and physically. But these resources 
mean little if families cannot afford 
them or if insurers refuse to cover 
them. 
That is why I am making sure that 
big insurers follow the law and cover 
mental healthcare. I am proud that my 
bill, the Mental Health Parity Compli-
ance Act, was signed into law in 2020. 
This legislation provides tools to en-
force the requirement that insurance 
companies cover mental healthcare the 
same way they cover physical health. 
Children 
need 
lawmakers 
to 
prioritize their well-being, including 
mental healthcare. This means sup-
porting high-quality, innovative pro-
grams; increasing connections between 
families, schools, and healthcare pro-
viders; and closing loopholes used by 
insurance companies to deny families 
affordable 
mental 
healthcare. 
The 
youth mental health crisis will not im-
prove without investment in care. 
As an Orange County mom, I am 
proud that my community is leading 
the way in responding to the youth 
mental health crisis. Our younger gen-
erations are counting on us to help 
them toward health and wellness, and I 
am committed to working across the 
aisle to get that done. 
2022 SOTU VIRTUAL GUEST NAZY SHABAZIAN 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, when 
my 1-year-old daughter, Betsy, went to 
daycare, I was worried. My family was 
in upheaval with a divorce, and Betsy 
was new to childcare. But when the 
door opened, Betsy was scooped up in a 
hug. 
Irvine resident Nazy Shabazian pro-
vided Betsy with years of fun but firm 
guidance—painting, racing cars, danc-
ing, and even snacking on Persian cu-
cumbers. 
A single parent herself, Nazy inspired 
me by successfully running her small 
business and raising two terrific daugh-
ters. During the pandemic, she ad-
justed to new health protocols, em-
ployee changes, and different parent 
schedules. Today, her business, Melody 
Child Care, is thriving—and so are the 
children in her care. 
Nazy is an exemplar of the compas-
sion and resilience that childcare pro-
viders and small businesses showed 
during the pandemic. I am proud to 
honor her as my 2022 State of the 
Union guest. 
f 
MOURNING THE PASSING OF 
REVEREND DARRELL DARLING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the passing of 
the Reverend Darrell Darling. 
The loss of Darrell Darling hits us 
hard in Santa Cruz but also throughout 
the Central Coast, for Reverend Dar-
ling was that iconic mentor to all of us 
based on his longtime fight for civil 
rights, for equal rights, for peace, for 
justice, for nonviolence, and for his 
never-ending work for a more perfect 
Union. 
Reverend Darling’s fight began when 
he almost got kicked out of college for 
pressing its administration about its 
racist policies toward African Ameri-
cans. Reverend Darling then went on to 
attend the Yale Seminary, where, in 
1965, he marched with Martin Luther 
King from Selma to Montgomery and 
crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge with 
our former colleague, John Lewis. 
In 
California, 
Reverend 
Darling 
served in five parishes for over 25 
years. After that, Darrell and his wife, 
Karen, ran the Darling House Bed and 
Breakfast, where they hosted numer-
ous events for our community and con-
tinued to mentor young activists and 
future public servants. 
In fact, I will never forget the con-
versation that I had with Darrell, seat-
ed in his backyard, that inspired me to 
stand here in Congress, for it was that 
type of impression that the Reverend 
Darling had on me, on Santa Cruz, and 
on the fight for equality in our Amer-
ican democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I not only recognize 
his legacy of service, but we, in Santa 
Cruz, acknowledge and appreciate that 
Reverend Darling is why many of us 
stand, fight, and serve today. 
MOURNING THE LOSS OF JORGE DAVID 
ALVARADO, JR. 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the loss and the 
service of Salinas Police Officer Jorge 
David Alvarado, Jr. 
Officer Alvarado was shot and killed 
in the line of duty while conducting a 
traffic stop on Friday night. Before I 
flew back here on Sunday, I visited the 
growing memorial for Officer Alvarado 
at the Salinas Police Department and 
joined in the mourning, the devasta-
tion, and the disbelief of his fiance, his 
mother, his brethren in blue, and our 
entire community in Salinas. 
Although the investigation of the in-
cident is ongoing, the chief of police 
stated that Officer Alvarado stayed in 
the fight to the end and paid the ulti-
mate price. As a result, the suspected 
cop killer is behind bars. 
Jorge Alvarado understood what it 
means to give back to his community

and to his country with his time in the 
U.S. Army, as well as his 5 years as a 
police officer. Although we look back 
upon his commitment and actions as 
we mourn his loss, let us also look to 
Officer Alvarado’s legacy of service as 
a way forward. 
We must realize that our commu-
nities, no matter their makeup, rely on 
men and women who make up our po-
lice departments for order, for safety, 
and for our upward mobility.

Officer Alvarado did that by not only 
protecting and serving Salinas, but 
also Officer Alvarado got up every day 
and left his home knowing that his job 
was to run to the danger and not away 
from it. 
Madam Speaker, Officer Jorge Alva-
rado ran to the danger on Friday night. 
Let’s make sure that his service, that 
his sacrifice, are not in vain. Let’s 
make sure that all of us support his 
family and support the men and women 
in uniform who strive to serve and pro-
tect so that we can make it home to 
our families and thrive in safe commu-
nities.

FARM BILL IMPACT SERIES: CROP 
INSURANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, in prep-
aration for reauthorizing the farm bill 
in 2023, I rise today to deliver the next 
installment of my Farm Bill Impact 
Series where I am highlighting various 
aspects of the farm bill that deserves 
Congress’ awareness and support. 
If America is going to thrive, the 
people who feed, fuel, and clothe Amer-
ica must thrive, and the farm bill con-
tains certain programs that have been 
critical to the success of agricultural 
producers in my district and the food 
security of our country. This week, I 
am talking about crop insurance. 
I believe that crop insurance is one of 
the most important programs within 
the farm bill, and my conversation 
with producers, farm economists, and 
crop insurance agents have shaped my 
understanding of how critical it is to 
reauthorize the crop insurance title in 
full for 2023. 
Crop insurance helps producers man-
age the risks that they face every day 
from weather, pests, disease, and mar-
ket volatility; it has also been one of 
our Nation’s best public-private part-
nership programs between the govern-
ment, private industry, and agricul-
tural producers. Crop insurance does 
two things: it benefits farmers and it 
benefits Americans. Crop insurance 
never replaces a good crop, but it lets 
producers stay in the game if disaster 
strikes and it helps to ensure that our 
country continues to be the most food- 
secure nation in the world. 
I recently spoke with two Kansas 
farmers to get their thoughts on the 
importance of crop insurance. One of 
them said to me, ‘‘I spend a lot of time 
thinking about the agronomic and eco-
nomic strength of my farm. Crop insur-
ance is the most important tool in my 
toolbox for ensuring my farm’s eco-
nomic strength in the face of my two 
biggest challenges: the weather and the 
global market. For small family oper-
ations like mine, banks want to see 
crop insurance before they will give 
you a line of credit because they want 
to know that you can remain resilient 
as an operation through times of vola-
tility.’’ 
Another Kansas farmer told me, 
‘‘The very first year I was not sure that 
I wanted to take out insurance. My 
mom convinced me to manage my risk 
and so I did. That year was extremely 
dry in the spring, and my first crop of 
wheat only made 12 bushels to the acre. 
If I didn’t have crop insurance, that 
year would have put me in a deep hole, 
and I would have missed my equipment 
payments. I have never forgotten that, 
and I have carried crop insurance every 
year since.’’ 
There are countless stories just like 
these that testify to the importance of 
crop insurance, without which the gov-
ernment would be continually consid-
ering ad hoc disaster relief programs 
for farmers. Crop insurance is a mar-
ket-based approach to risk manage-
ment with a proven track record. The 
more we reduce the impact of risk and 
volatility in agriculture, the more food 
secure we become as a nation, and the 
more food secure we are, the stronger 
and freer we are. 
I support whatever directly benefits 
farmers, ranchers, and ag producers in 
this country because they are the life-
blood of America. They keep us food se-
cure, and therefore, free and self-deter-
mining as a nation. That is why I sup-
port crop insurance within Title XI, 
and why I am bringing awareness to it 
now, to ensure that this program re-
mains strong in the 2023 farm bill. 
I will be back on the floor soon to de-
liver another installment of my Farm 
Bill Impact Series and highlight more 
programs and titles within the bill that 
I believe this Congress must under-
stand and support to ensure that agri-
culture thrives in America. 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S FIRST STATE OF THE UNION 
SPEECH 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, tonight 
the President will give his first State 
of the Union speech in this very Cham-
ber. Unfortunately, our country is far 
weaker and has greatly declined in the 
131⁄2 months since President Biden took 
office. 
His heavy-handed COVID mandates 
have decimated workforces and hit cer-
tain industries, like healthcare, espe-
cially hard. Crime is rising on our 
streets, which is a direct result of ef-
forts to defund the police. Biden’s open 
border policies will result in approxi-
mately 2 million apprehensions in a 
single year. 
Our debt is approaching $30 trillion 
with no end in sight. Inflation and the 
rising cost of practically everything 
Americans need to live is wreaking 
havoc on our people, especially those 
on fixed incomes. Supply chains are in 
disarray. 
The administration’s needless war on 
domestic oil and gas production has led 
to dramatic increases at the pump and 
has caused the United States to once 
again, unfortunately, be a net oil im-
porter. 
President Biden’s disastrous with-
drawal from Afghanistan cost Amer-
ican lives and weakened our standing 
in the world. This weakness then 
emboldened Russia and resulted in 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and all the 
while we are doing far too little to 
stand up to China. 
The list goes on and on. America 
badly needs its President to quickly 
and dramatically reverse course so 
that the state of our Union is some-
thing that we can all be proud of and 
that will once again be strong. 
f 
URGENCY TO PASS IMMIGRATION 
REFORM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today on the eve of President Biden’s 
State of the Union speech to strongly 
urge Congress to pass immigration re-
form to boost our economy, grow our 
GDP, and create jobs across the coun-
try. 
Right now, our economy is roaring 
back after the depths of a global pan-
demic, and workers and families are 
still feeling the effects. As we continue 
this recovery and work to grow our 
economy, lower costs, and create jobs, 
it is now more crucial than ever that 
we secure a pathway to citizenship for 
the millions of hardworking, immi-
grant, essential workers across the 
country who contribute to our econ-
omy every day. 
We must secure a pathway to citizen-
ship 
for 
the 
farmworkers 
and 
meatpackers who feed America, the 
construction workers who build Amer-
ican cities, the restaurant and hotel 
workers who serve our families, and 
the nurses, doctors, and healthcare 
workers who have cared for us in this 
public health crisis. Now is the time to 
deliver on immigration reform to boost 
our economy and keep families to-
gether. 
Members of the Congressional His-
panic Caucus join me in this fight to 
urgently act. That is why we have 
worked tirelessly with the Biden ad-
ministration to enact policy changes to 
build a more efficient, just, fair, and 
humane immigration system that re-
flects our American values. 
We have pursued an all-of-the-above 
and any-which-way approach to achiev-
ing immigration reform using every 
tool at our disposal to secure a path-
way to citizenship for Dreamers, farm-
workers, TPS holders, and essential 
workers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1182 
March 1, 2022 
In the House, CHC members have in-
troduced and passed meaningful bipar-
tisan bills to achieve that goal. As the 
proud 
son 
of 
farmworkers, 
I 
was 
thrilled when Democrats, Republicans, 
growers, and workers came together to 
pass the Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act. This bipartisan bill would 
give farmworkers and their families a 
pathway to citizenship. 
Doing so would stabilize our work-
force and the price of our food, making 
your 
produce, 
my 
produce, 
and 
everybody’s produce available at a rea-
sonable cost. The CHC also led efforts 
to pass the bipartisan American Dream 
and Promise Act to allow DACA, tem-
porary protected status, and deferred 
enforced 
departure 
beneficiaries 
to 
earn permanent residence and continue 
contributing to our workforce and 
economy. 
CHC, with House Democrats, deliv-
ered. Unfortunately, Republicans in 
the Senate blocked these commonsense 
bills that would benefit all Americans 
and help keep families together. How-
ever, we didn’t let their refusal to do 
what is right for this country and 
American families stand in the way of 
our work to enact positive change. 
That is why the CHC led efforts to 
pass immigration reform through the 
Build Back Better Act and provide a 
much-needed pathway to citizenship 
for Dreamers, TPS holders, essential 
workers, and farmworkers, and mean-
ingful protections and work permits. 
Out of the House, we passed significant 
reforms to address the historic labor 
shortages our Nation faces, grow our 
GDP, and fight rising costs for Amer-
ican families. 
Now, with these much-needed provi-
sions awaiting consideration in the 
Senate, I call on my Senate colleagues 
to take up the Build Back Better Act 
without delay and pass it with a path-
way to citizenship. I call on the Senate 
to pass the American Dream and Prom-
ise Act. I call on the Senate to pass the 
Farm Workforce Modernization Act. 
We must urgently pass immigration 
reform right now. We will work with 
the administration to achieve positive, 
meaningful immigration changes. It is 
our duty to our Nation to give hard-
working, immigrant, essential workers 
the opportunity to stay in the country 
that they call home. 
Our Nation’s immigrants are profes-
sionals, entrepreneurs, doctors, nurses, 
and essential workers who make Amer-
ica stronger. We are at our strongest 
when we embrace our immigrant com-
munities. 
Later 
tonight, 
during 
President 
Biden’s State of the Union address, 
CHC members will be virtually joined 
by Dreamers from our districts to high-
light their contributions to our coun-
try, their home. Dreamers are part of 
our efforts to rebuild and to recover. 
They are our future and our constant 
inspiration in this fight. 
Tonight, I am proud to be joined by 
Alma from Thermal, California, my 
constituent, to say: ‘‘You are not for-
gotten.’’ ‘‘No son olvidados.’’ 
You are home.

MR. PUTIN’S IMMORAL WAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise with a very heavy heart and an 
overwhelming sense of sadness, an-
guish, and anger that should, however, 
be utilized to save lives. 
I traveled with the Organization of 
Security and Cooperation in Europe 
with 
my 
colleagues, 
Congressmen 
Cohen, Hudson, Wilson, Aderholt, and 
Veasey. We started out, most of us, on 
Sunday with the intent to go into the 
Ukraine region, and we did, all with op-
timism that this war would not be, 
that we could engage in discussions 
with parliamentarians and heads of 
state and that Putin would listen to 
reason of the 21st century. 
Upon 
arriving, 
we 
unfortunately 
heard the distorted, confused, and ab-
solutely rejected message of the Soviet 
Union, and how the history suggests 
that countries like Ukraine were not 
independent, they were simply part of 
the old Soviet Union. 
Madam Speaker, you are aware of the 
fact that generations now living in 
democratic countries like Lithuania 
have no knowledge of the old Soviet 
Union. Congratulations to leaders like 
Gorbachev and Yeltsin who believed 
that their duty was to bring Russia 
into the 21st century. 
We remember the words of Ronald 
Reagan: Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that 
wall. How in the world can Putin now 
come to represent that he, riding in on 
a fancy horse, maybe even shirtless, is 
going 
to 
now 
dominate 
violently, 
bringing these countries to their knees 
and for them to reject what they have 
come to love, and that is democracy? 
We 
continued 
in 
discussions—the 
Lithuanian Prime Minister, the Lith-
uanian President, the Lithuanian For-
eign Minister, and many others—that 
country, right in the eye of the storm, 
right in the potential of being one of 
those victims, yet Lithuania is a mem-
ber of NATO protected by Article 5. 
But we thought because of their fears 
and their concerns, because of their 
sensitivity of the reckless and uncon-
trolled posture of Putin, who knows 
where he would go, Estonia, Latvia, 
Moldova, countries that are standing 
separately. 
He has already, as we were fully 
briefed, dominated and taken over—it 
doesn’t exist. I want the President of 
Belarus to understand that. I hope that 
he could stand up, but there were al-
ready 30,000 to 40,000 Russia troops in 
his country bordering on Lithuania. 
b 1030 
Even with that, we wanted to, as we 
have heard, give peace a chance and 
continue to press for peace even to the 
point where we went to the meeting 
where Finland, Sweden, France, Great 
Britain, Russia, and Ukraine were all 
there. We went to sit down at the peace 
table to try and argue. We arrived on 
Wednesday, and as everyone knows, in 
the late hours, early morning, from 
Wednesday to Thursday, Putin de-
signed his own war. No vote by the 
Russian people. He designed a purpose-
less, senseless, and immoral war. 
I began to articulate how we should 
move quickly, financial sanctions that 
should immediately bring them to 
their knees, the SWIFT account being 
denied. On Friday and Saturday I 
asked for that. But I think the real 
issue is they should be brought to their 
knees. And then last Saturday I said 
that he should be charged as a war 
criminal. I am glad that the world 
criminal court, The Hague, is now 
opening an investigation on this des-
perate terrorizer, this killer. 
We cannot tolerate this kind of be-
havior. He indicated to the world that 
this was an operational war: I am going 
to be selective, I am not going after ci-
vilians. 
Madam Speaker, to the Nation and to 
the world: this is a face of a destroyed 
building reminiscent of World War II 
when civilian places were bombed and 
when thousands were lost. There is a 
person standing here. And this is dead 
children. 
Mr. Putin is a killer and a terrorist. 
And these are terrorists that are in 
Ukraine. We ask the world to continue 
to stand united, NATO and others, to 
be able to bring Putin to his needs fi-
nancially and economically and as well 
on the world stage. He should be tried 
as a criminal. We need this war to end 
in a cease-fire. 
Madam Speaker, President Zelensky 
said: We are here. 
We stand with him. Ukraine is here. 
Glory to Ukraine.

MARDI GRAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Down in 
New Orleans where the blues were 
born, it takes a cool cat to blow a horn. 
Down 
in 
LaSalle 
and 
Rampart 
Street, it is Mardi Gras combo with a 
mambo beat. 
Today is Mardi Gras, and as a New 
Orleanian, this is a special time for our 
city and our region. It is a joyous time 
culminating today in the dizzying, 
colorful explosion that is Mardi Gras 
Day—Fat Tuesday. Everywhere else, it 
is just a Tuesday, but in Louisiana it is 
Mardi Gras—a time for merriment, a 
time for joy, a time to party, and rec-
ognize the culture that makes New Or-
leans so unique and makes Louisiana 
so special. 
It 
is 
a 
one-of-a-kind 
experience. 
Some might call this biased, but objec-
tively I think everyone should enjoy 
and experience Mardi Gras. 
Today, people from all over the world 
come together, krewes of all stripes 
and backgrounds work to pull off a day 
like none other.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1183 
March 1, 2022 
After the challenges of isolation and 
the pandemic, this year’s Mardi Gras is 
a chance for us to reunite, reconnect, 
and celebrate what truly makes New 
Orleans, New Orleans—the love, the 
peace, the culture, and the energy of 
its people. 
While I am in D.C. for House business 
and for the President’s State of the 
Union address, my heart is at home as 
the Zulu float turns on Jackson Ave-
nue and the oceans of people scream 
and yell: Throw me something, mister. 
Our hearts are full of joy. 
My heart is handing out coconuts at 
the Zulu parade as we speak, although 
I am physically in Washington, D.C. 
People attending balls, costuming, 
and letting everyone be themselves is 
what Mardi Gras is all about. It is a 
time of love, a time of expression, and 
a time of cultural explosion. 
Happy Mardi Gras to one, happy 
Mardi Gras to all, have a safe and 
happy Mardi Gras. Enjoy the beautiful 
weather. 
For all of you watching, I invite you 
all to come to Louisiana, have a slice, 
have a piece of Mardi Gras. No matter 
where you are or where you are from, 
let’s show each other some love this 
season. 
And as we say in Louisiana: Laissez 
les bon temps rouler.

AMERICA’S ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight one of the most 
forceful and significant pieces of lever-
age on the world stage that President 
Biden surrendered on his first day in 
office: America’s energy independence. 
Later today the President will bra-
zenly attempt to rewrite history by 
hailing his so-called leadership amidst 
the horrific and heartbreaking war un-
folding in Ukraine while ignoring the 
self-inflicted crises he has imposed on 
the American people. Yet no amount of 
spin, lies, or deflection can hide the 
damage that Biden has done to our 
great 
country—particularly 
through 
his failed, destructive, and reckless en-
ergy policies. 
On day one he killed the Keystone 
XL pipeline destroying 11,000 American 
jobs and delivering a crushing blow to 
domestic energy production. Shortly 
after, 
President 
Biden 
infamously 
green-lit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline— 
handing Vladimir Putin a victory long 
before his Russian troops ever stepped 
foot into Ukraine. 
Throughout the first year of Biden’s 
Presidency, the current administration 
embarrassingly 
begged 
OPEC 
to 
produce more oil while stalling and 
even halting oil and gas permits here 
in the United States. 
To further weaken our position on 
the world stage, President Biden with-
drew U.S. support for beneficial energy 
projects around the world, increasing 
our dependence, as well as our allies’ 
dependence, on foreign adversaries. 
President Biden removed U.S. support 
from the Eastern Mediterranean gas 
pipeline that would have connected 
Israel’s offshore gas reserves to Europe. 
In spite of lauding this project as a 
new opportunity and a geopolitical 
win-win back in 2014 when Biden was 
Vice President, now President Biden 
claims his priorities lie with moving 
away from fossil fuels in order to pro-
mote green energy and renewables. 
Some may believe President Biden sim-
ply had a change of heart, but this 
would be naive. Instead, he has dan-
gerously appeased the far-left flank of 
his party by fully embracing Green 
New Deal garbage. 
Enough is enough, Madam Speaker. 
It is abundantly clear that energy inde-
pendence is national security. And 
through every solitary energy policy, 
the Biden administration has chipped 
away at our ability to independently 
fuel our Nation, thereby damaging our 
national security. 
Due to President Trump’s powerful 
efforts, the United States was recently 
energy independent just a year ago. 
Yet thanks to President Biden’s uto-
pian Green New Deal fantasies, we have 
lost our energy independence. So rath-
er than strengthening domestic produc-
tion by having every energy industry 
firing on all cylinders, we are left pur-
chasing oil and gas from other coun-
tries, like Russia. Yes, Russia. 
In fact, the United States buys over 
635,000 barrels of oil every day at over 
$103 per barrel. That is over $65 million 
every solitary day that we are sending 
to Russia filling Putin’s war coffers in 
the process. I stand with patriots boy-
cotting Russian vodka, pouring it out 
all over the streets, supporting the 
Ukrainian people. 
But why on Earth are we not boy-
cotting Russian energy to put America 
first and really hit Russia where it 
hurts: in the pocketbook? 
Mr. President, we must immediately 
cease purchasing Russian oil and fully 
unleash domestic energy production. 
Ahead of his State of the Union Ad-
dress tonight, I urge President Biden to 
rescind existing regulations and re-
verse harmful executive orders that un-
dermine our energy independence. Re-
store oil and gas production by swiftly 
authorizing vital leases and permits, 
and abandoned radical climate rules 
and policies that obstruct our ability 
to have domestic energy production 
roaring at full throttle. 
Unfortunately, based on the Presi-
dent’s most recent record, I fully ex-
pect him to double down on his disas-
trous energy agenda. Just this week-
end, Press Secretary Jen Psaki comi-
cally claimed that we need to reduce 
our dependence on foreign oil, on oil in 
general, and we need to look at other 
ways of having energy in our country 
and others. 
As a military veteran, I can assure 
the White House that renewable re-
sources are meaningless in fueling 
military equipment on the battlefield 
and winning a war. 
To no one’s surprise, recent reports 
claim President Biden will tout his en-
ergy policies tonight and request this 
body to deliver legislation to achieve 
so-called clean energy that promotes 
climate action. What a disappoint-
ment. 
There is still time for the President 
to cease this capitulation to the far 
left, stop putting $65 million every day 
into Vladimir Putin’s war chest, and 
put Americans first by fully empow-
ering and unleashing domestic energy 
production.

CELEBRATING THE ATHLETES 
FROM BEARDEN HIGH SCHOOL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, on 
February 6, Bearden High School’s 
dance team brought home another na-
tional championship from the Uni-
versal Dance Association’s National 
Dance Team championship. The team 
earned its third national championship 
in the large varsity Game Day Divi-
sion, the sixth in team history. 
Routines in the Game Day Division 
are focused on school spirit and crowd 
engagement. Teamwork is crucial in 
these choreographed competitions, and 
athletes must be on the same page if 
they want to win. Bearden’s dance 
team won this competition by working 
together and perfecting a motivating, 
effective routine during Bearden Bull-
dog athletic competitions. 
Members of this national champion-
ship winning team are Abigail Abrams, 
Olivia 
Roddy, 
Jordan 
James, 
Ella 
Klenck, Julie Horn, Maddie Taylor, 
Cadance Eastman, Kenzie Bankes, Mal-
lory Simpson, Ruby Fisher, Leah Cho, 
Ella 
McLaughlin, 
Marian 
Mitchell, 
Mallory Haskins, Eli Keziah, Lana Nel-
son, Avery Duncanson, and Reagan 
Honeycutt. 
The team’s leadership includes head 
coach 
Hannah 
Keathley, 
assistant 
coaches Natalie Adkins and Sydney 
Schriver, 
technical 
coach 
Kathryn 
Brasfield, choreographer Katie Fear 
Lane, and team sponsor and high 
school teacher Rebecca Nutter. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to 
celebrate this group of athletes from 
Bearden High School, my alma mater. 
Our community is proud of your con-
tinued success on the national stage. 
And go Bulldogs. 
Recognizing 
Tennessee 
Volunteers 
Legend Gus Manning 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize somebody who really 
needs no recognition at all but is some-
body who is very dear to me. He is a 
good friend of mine. He is a Tennessee 
Volunteer legend, Gus Manning. He is 
turning 99 this July, and I wanted to 
take a few moments to recognize Gus’ 
life and distinguished career here on 
the House floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1184 
March 1, 2022 
Gus is a lifelong Knoxvillian. He 
graduated from Rule High School, the 
Fighting Golden Bears, and then served 
in the United States Marine Corps dur-
ing World War II. After he completed 
serving his country in the Marine 
Corps he decided to become a Ten-
nessee Volunteer, and that journey 
began. 
A tremendously athletic individual, 
Gus walked onto UT’s football team in 
1947 and played baseball for the Volun-
teers. He graduated from Tennessee in 
1950 but returned to UT in 1951 when 
the athletic director, General Robert 
Neyland, hired him to be the sports in-
formation director for Volunteer ath-
letics. This was the beginning of Gus’ 
nearly half-century long professional 
career with UT’s athletic department. 
Outside of the athletic department, 
Gus co-hosted Vol Sports Report on 
WIVK. He also served as president of 
the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, the 
Southeastern Conference Sports Infor-
mation 
Directors, 
and 
the 
South-
eastern Conference Business Managers. 
From 1951 to 2003, Gus attended 608 
consecutive Tennessee Volunteers foot-
ball games. His dedication to the Uni-
versity of Tennessee’s athletic program 
earned him inductions into halls of 
fame and awards from various organi-
zations. His greatest recognition came 
in 2015, when Gate 16 at Neyland Sta-
dium was renamed Gus Manning Gate. 
It is fitting that an individual who 
dedicated so much of his life to the 
football teams that play in that sta-
dium is now a part of it forever. 
I thank Gus for continuing to be such 
a great representative of the Univer-
sity of Tennessee and its athletic pro-
grams.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
In You, O Lord, may all seek refuge. 
Incline Your ear to those who des-
perately cry to You as they flee the 
devastation surrounding them and res-
cue them speedily from their distress. 
Be the rock of refuge for all who seek 
shelter. Be a strong fortress behind 
which they may find safety and secu-
rity. 
Loving God, would that we trust in 
You and not in worthless idols of power 
and control. Turn not Your face from 
us. 
You have seen the affliction of the 
people who call on Your name; heed 
now and save them from unimagined 
adversity. 
Be gracious, O Lord, to those who are 
anguished, whose eyes are swollen with 
the grief of lives lost; whose souls are 
broken in fear of the terror threatening 
their loved ones left behind. 
Give us the courage to hold fast to 
You, our God. Embrace these times in 
Your mercy; deliver the innocent from 
the hands of their enemies. Save the 
blameless from their persecutors. 
Let Your face shine upon those who 
need, this day, the light of Your coun-
tenance. Save them by the strength of 
Your steadfast love. 
We offer this prayer for our world 
this day, in Your most holy name. 
Amen.

PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST 
COVID–19 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, last week the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention lifted 
many mask wearing mandates due to 
the positive trends in the fight against 
COVID–19. Effective today, Canada’s 
Ontario Ministry of Health is removing 
capacity limits and vaccination re-
quirements for all settings. 
Increased vaccination rates in the 
United States, Canada, and around the 
world show that communities who have 
done the right thing and followed the 
science can return to a watchful sense 
of normalcy. 
Today, I am calling on the United 
States and Canadian Governments to 
follow the science-based directives of 
their health agencies and to fully re-
open the Canadian border to travelers 
without COVID restrictions. 
Two years ago, the border between 
the United States and Canada closed 
with devastating consequences for both 
countries, economically and emotion-
ally. Incredible progress has been made 
in the fight against COVID. It is time 
to move the remaining disjointed and 
prohibitive restrictions at the U.S. and 
Canadian borders. 
f 
SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE 
(Mr. LATURNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the brave men and women 
across Ukraine fighting for their free-
dom and standing strong against Vladi-
mir Putin and his gang of thugs. As our 
adversaries look on, it is time our Na-
tion’s leaders step up on the world 
stage and restore peace through Amer-
ican strength and power. 
Make no mistake. This unprovoked 
invasion of Ukraine is an attack on de-
mocracy, and Russia must be held ac-
countable for their actions. The United 
States must immediately impose addi-
tional crippling economic sanctions 
against Putin and provide further mili-
tary and humanitarian aid to the 
Ukraine fighting forces. 
Most importantly, it is vital that we 
end our Nation’s reliance on Russia’s 
energy industry by unleashing domes-
tic energy production right here in the 
United States. Energy security is na-
tional security. 
I continue to be inspired by the 
countless acts of bravery and leader-
ship by President Zelensky and his peo-
ple as they fight for their freedom and 
independence. May God give strength 
and comfort to the people of Ukraine. 
f 
HONORING DR. PAUL FARMER 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a brilliant doc-
tor and a pioneer of global health, Dr. 
Paul Farmer, who sadly passed away 
last week. 
Dr. Farmer dedicated his entire life 
to improving the lives of others. 
As co-founder of Partners in Health 
alongside Dr. Jim Yong Kim and Ophe-
lia Dahl, he forever altered our under-
standing of the fight against global 
poverty and how to care for those in 
need. 
In his mission, ‘‘To Repair the 
World,’’ that is his book, he brought 
his unique and innovative brand of 
compassionate care to fight HIV in 
Haiti, tuberculosis in Peru, Ebola in 
Sierra Leone, to name just a few, while 
helping transform public health out-
comes in Rwanda. 
At the Harvard Medical School, he 
inspired a generation of aspiring doc-
tors to pursue careers in global health. 
Personally, it was a privilege to see 
his saintly work firsthand on our con-
gressional delegation visit to Haiti in

ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA’S 
DROUGHT 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, the Bureau of Reclamation an-
nounced that farmers in the Central 
Valley would receive none of the water 
contracted through the Federally man-
aged Central Valley Project. 
The lack of any allocation at all is 
alarming news to the communities 
that have continued to suffer from 
issues like the ongoing supply chain 
crisis. 
Once 
again, 
Central 
Valley 
farmers are being asked to do more 
with less. 
My constituents are the farmers who 
feed the world, and they are resilient. 
But the fact remains that our farms 
will not survive without a reliable 
water supply for south-of-Delta agri-
culture. 
Meanwhile, the House majority re-
fuses to consider my bill, the RENEW 
WIIN Act, which would immediately 
bring water to these fields and save 
these farms. 
These water allocations must reflect 
the needs of the agriculture commu-
nity which is the backbone of the Cen-
tral Valley economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
take up my legislation to address Cali-
fornia’s drought.

RECOGNIZING TOMMY VITOLO 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize my guest for 
this year’s State of the Union address, 
Massachusetts 
State 
Representative 
Tommy Vitolo of the 15th Norfolk Dis-
trict. 
Over the past year, we have strived 
with the Biden agenda to empower 
States and localities to use Federal 
funds as they felt best when securing 
historic relief to rebuild our economy 
coming out of the pandemic. This 
strategy has worked because of great 
partners at the State and local level 
like Representative Vitolo. 
From the passage of the American 
Rescue Plan to the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act, the Democratic 
agenda is helping people in Massachu-
setts and beyond. Tommy was a key 
partner in helping to get relief for es-
sential workers, bringing attention to 
critical transportation projects, and 
supporting job growth. I look forward 
to hosting him as my virtual guest this 
evening, and to our continued partner-
ship delivering results to the Bay State 
with the Biden agenda. 
f 
PUTIN’S WAR 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on Friday, I was grateful, as 
the ranking member of the U.S. delega-
tion to the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, to address 
the Parliamentary Assembly in Vi-
enna, Austria. Our delegation was ably 
led by Co-Chair STEVE COHEN. 
The bipartisan United States delega-
tion of Democrats and Republicans 
being transatlantic, with our valued 
European and Indo-Pacific allies, have 
been unintentionally united about the 
Putin war of mass murder in Ukraine, 
violating the principles of the Helsinki 
Final Act. Here, we want to emphasize 
the devastating human cost of the 
Putin war against the families of 
Ukraine, isolating Russia and Belarus 
from the modern world. 
I was grateful over the years to have 
visited Russia a number of times where 
I was so impressed by the talented citi-
zens. Today, they are being betrayed 
by Putin in his obsession for oil, 
money, and power. Two months ago, I 
visited Kyiv and it is horrifying to 
know of the attacks. 
Sadly, 
in 
Belarus, 
dictator 
Lukashenko has become a puppet fa-
cilitating the Putin war. It is inspiring 
that the legal President of Belarus, 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, would have 
her first loyalty to the people of 
Belarus, not the war criminal, Putin. 
In conclusion, God bless Ukraine. 
God save Ukraine. Long live President 
Volodymyr Zelensky. 
f 
RECOGNIZING LIZ BOLHOUSE 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Liz Bolhouse, a pe-
diatric ICU nurse back home in Las 
Vegas. Tonight, President Biden will 
address this Congress and the Nation in 
the State of the Union address, and Liz 
is my guest. 
While we continue to recover from 
this pandemic, let’s reflect on what we 
have done. We have put over 500 mil-
lion shots in arms of Americans, our 
kids are back in school, our economy is 
getting back on track, and a record- 
breaking 6.7 million jobs were created 
in the President’s first year. 
It 
is 
hardworking 
Americans 
in 
southern Nevada, and all across this 
Nation, who are the true heroes in this 
recovery. Liz is one of those heroes. Liz 
has lived and worked in Nevada for 22 
years as a nurse. It goes without saying 
that these have been two of the hardest 
years in all of our lives, but these 2 
years have brought out the best in our 
dedicated and selfless healthcare he-
roes, including Liz, and the hundreds of 
Nevada nurses she represents as the 
SEIU Local 1107 chief nursing steward. 
I thank Liz and I thank every nurse 
back home and across this great Na-
tion for your hard work and dedication 
in keeping our communities healthy 
and safe.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
REPRESENTATIVE JIM HAGEDORN 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember 
the

Jim 
Hagedorn. I had the privilege of work-
ing with Jim in D.C., and the oppor-
tunity to spend time with him in his 
district where I know he was well- 
loved. 
Jim was a tireless advocate on behalf 
of our Nation’s farmers, ranchers, pro-
ducers, and foresters, and he never 
wavered in his commitment to serving 
the great people of Minnesota’s First 
District. 
Jim was a warrior on the Ag Com-
mittee questioning and confronting the 
administration when he perceived poli-
cies were hurting those families that 
work hard every day to provide us food 
and fiber. I consider Jim a dear friend 
and his passing a tragic loss. 
His contagious personality and cheer-
ful sense of humor will be missed on 
the committee and in the Halls of Con-
gress for years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, scripture in Thessa-
lonians 4:13–18 instructs us with these 
words, ‘‘Brothers and sisters, we do not 
want you to be uninformed about those 
who sleep in death, so that you do not 
grieve like the rest of mankind, who 
have no hope.’’ 
Jim Hagedorn lived his life dedicated 
in service to this Nation in a manner 
that brought hope to so many. Let us 
find hope having known Jim Hagedorn.

RECOGNIZING ANTHONY 
ALEXANDER FOR HIS BRAVERY 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize one of my young 
constituents, Anthony Alexander, a 
student at Academy Park High School, 
for his recent bravery in a moment of 
crisis. 
Last week, on an unseasonably warm 
winter day, Anthony was riding his 
bike with friends in Collingdale Park 
when he heard cries for help. A frozen 
pond had given way and three younger 
children had fallen through the ice. 
As the children panicked, 16-year-old 
Anthony sprang into action. He dialed 
911 and then ran to the water’s edge 
and used a stick to help pull the chil-
dren to safety. He then jumped into the 
freezing pond to reach the third child.

Police Sergeant Pat Kilroy arrived on

So many of us wonder what we would 
do when faced with an emergency. An-
thony’s quick thinking and selfless ac-

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join

MR. PUTIN’S WAR 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I, too, 
join 
my 
colleague, 
Representative 
THOMPSON, in remembering and feeling 
very 
blessed 
to 
have 
known 
Jim 
Hagedorn, our colleague and friend, 
and I pray for his family. 
Mr. Speaker, on this day we need to 
discuss the fact that Vladimir Putin is 
absolutely stunned by the courage and 
resolve of the Ukrainian people. After 6 
to 7 days of fighting, Ukraine controls 
most of its major cities including the 
city that my family is from, Lviv. The 
Russian people are protesting their 
leader’s unprovoked aggression seeing, 
as the world sees, that this is Putin’s 
war alone. 
We must do more. Our crippling sanc-
tions are strongly hurting the Russian 
economy. But, Mr. Speaker, we must 
recognize this conflict is where energy 
is both the carrot and the stick. We 
must hit Putin where it hurts, by cut-
ting off imports of Russian oil to the 
United States, unleashing U.S. energy, 
and ensuring Nord Stream 2 never goes 
into effect. 
Putin can’t be trusted. This is under-
stood. His prior interest in diplomacy 
was insincere. We must show leader-
ship. We must provide the weapons 
that, by the way, were provided by the 
Ukrainian Parliament.

HONORING SUNNY BRYANT FROM 
HOUSTON, TEXAS 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor 8-year-old Sunny 
Bryant from Houston, Texas. 
Some hometown heroes, like Sunny 
Bryant, might be too young to work 
and are certainly too young to even 
have a driver’s license, but they inspire 
millions of people across our Nation. 
Sunny Bryant is a transgender girl 
who, like her transgender community, 
is currently experiencing fear and anx-
iety due to politically motivated at-
tacks sparked by Texas Governor Greg 
Abbott and his anti-trans actions. 
Governor Abbott recently directed 
State officials to investigate parents 
who support their trans children with 
gender-affirming healthcare, describing 
it as child abuse. This measure not 
only goes against the opinions of med-
ical 
experts, 
but 
it 
intentionally 
strikes fear in the transgender commu-
nity for political gain. This is appall-
ing. 
But like hometown heroes across the 
country, Sunny is strong and resil-
ient—and she has got some missing 
teeth as you can see in the photo, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Sunny Bryant, from my home dis-
trict in Texas, will be my virtual State 
of the Union guest. I am truly honored 
that she will be joining me today. 
f 
CALIFORNIA WATER ALLOCATION 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, Federal officials announced Cali-
fornia water allocations for water year 
2022—this one—this spring right now 
where growers are getting ready to 
plant—or would be. 
Despite their hard work as growers, 
their productivity and responsibility of 
feeding the rest of the Nation being on 
their shoulders, they were put dead 
last in line for water allocations. That 
is right. Behind even the mindless 
dumping of freshwater into our oceans 
to save nonexistent fish. 
Even 
though 
California 
farmers 
produce most of the Nation’s fruit, nut, 
and vegetable crops, many received 
zero percent of their allocation—this at 
a time of many bare store shelves in 
the grocery stores, this time of crisis of 
an international proportion where we 
should be making our own energy and 
our own food crops. 
We are going to become more reliant 
on imported food if we don’t grow this 
2022 crop year because we are growing 
next year’s crop right now—including 
on my rice farm at home. 
These water allocations will indeed 
have drastic consequences for the farm-
ers, their employees, and the small 
towns that they populate all up and 
down 
California 
and 
indeed 
other 
States as well. 
So growers are at their wit’s end. We 
need President Biden and others to re-
allocate and prioritize water for farm-
ers, not for fish. 
f 
PROTECTING LGBTQ RIGHTS 
ABROAD 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, reports 
to Congress are not just for us. They 
are a tool for Americans to hold our 
government accountable. 
I joined Republicans and Democrats 
to pass the Global Respect Act to re-
quire the White House and State De-
partment to name foreign individuals 
who violate the human rights of 
LGBTQ people. People put on this list 
would be ineligible for visas to enter 
into the United States. 
This report of human rights viola-
tions should not fit on some desk in 
Washington, D.C. gathering dust. My 
amendment to the Global Respect Act 
gives every American the opportunity 
to 
read 
the 
report 
on 
protecting 
LGBTQ rights abroad. 
The public, our partners, and our al-
lies need to see that the U.S. Govern-
ment is holding human rights abusers 
accountable. My amendment will re-
quire a published report and will im-
prove transparency and accountability. 
f 
UKRAINE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
solidarity with the people of Ukraine 
who are under horrific siege. Ukraine’s 
valorous 
President 
Volodymyr 
Zelensky and the courageous Ukrain-
ian forces and its people are defending 
their homeland in what truly is a bat-
tle of David versus Goliath. 
Putin is unleashing hell on Earth 
through cluster bombs and vacuum 
bombs on innocent civilians targeting 
women, children, and the elderly, and 
striking hospitals and orphanages in a 
murderous rampage. 
This is the work of war criminals. 
But more war is not the answer. The 
top leaders of every nation in our 
world—not just their ambassadors but 
every leader of every nation—this week 
must create an historic surge of diplo-
macy to engage with Vladimir Putin to 
end this massacre. 
Work it out. Work it out. 
Please stop the killing. Stop the fear. 
Stop the massacre. Build forward. In-
vite Vladimir Putin toward a new 
world of peace and opportunity for all 
in that damaged and struggling part of 
our beleaguered world.

DEMOCRATS ARE BUILDING A 
BETTER AMERICA 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, President 
Biden and Democrats are building a 
better America. 
Last year we passed the American 
Rescue Plan. That helped get our econ-
omy back on track. We have created in 
America approximately 7 million jobs 
in the last 12 months. That is a record 
in U.S. history. We are also experi-
encing very high economic growth. 
Jobs are up, wages are up, and unem-
ployment is down. 
We then followed it up with an infra-
structure law that is going to rebuild 
roads, bridges, and highways. It is 
going to put broadband internet every-
where from rural areas to inner cities. 
It is going to get lead out of our water, 
and it is going to put EV charging sta-
tions across America.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF 
H.R. 
3967, 
HONORING 
OUR 
PROMISE 
TO 
ADDRESS 
COM-
PREHENSIVE TOXICS ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 950 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 950 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the bill (H.R. 3967) to improve health 
care and benefits for veterans exposed to 
toxic substances, and for other purposes. All 
points of order against consideration of the 
bill are waived. An amendment in the nature 
of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 117–33, modified by the 
amendment printed in part A of the report of 
the Committee on Rules accompanying this 
resolution, shall be considered as adopted. 
The bill, as amended, shall be considered as 
read. All points of order against provisions 
in the bill, as amended, are waived. The pre-
vious question shall be considered as ordered 
on the bill, as amended, and on any further 
amendment thereto, to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs or their re-
spective designees; (2) the further amend-
ments described in section 2 of this resolu-
tion; (3) the amendments en bloc described in 
section 3 of this resolution; and (4) one mo-
tion to recommit. 
SEC. 2. After debate pursuant to the first 
section of this resolution, each further 
amendment printed in part B of the report of 
the Committee on Rules not earlier consid-
ered as part of amendments en bloc pursuant 
to section 3 of this resolution shall be con-
sidered only in the order printed in the re-
port, may be offered only by a Member des-
ignated in the report, shall be considered as 
read, shall be debatable for the time speci-
fied in the report equally divided and con-
trolled by the proponent and an opponent,

time before the question is put thereon, shall 
not be subject to amendment, and shall not 
be subject to a demand for division of the 
question. 
SEC. 3. It shall be in order at any time 
after debate pursuant to the first section of 
this resolution for the chair of the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs or his designee 
to offer amendments en bloc consisting of 
further amendments printed in part B of the 
report of the Committee on Rules accom-
panying this resolution not earlier disposed 
of. Amendments en bloc offered pursuant to 
this section shall be considered as read, shall 
be debatable for 20 minutes equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs or their respective designees, 
shall not be subject to amendment, and shall 
not be subject to a demand for division of the 
question. 
SEC. 4. All points of order against the fur-
ther amendments printed in part B of the re-
port of the Committee on Rules or amend-
ments en bloc described in section 3 of this 
resolution are waived. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
RUIZ). The gentleman from Massachu-
setts is recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, before 
I begin, I just want to state what I 
think we are all feeling here today, and 
that is that our prayers are with the 
Ukrainian people during this very per-
ilous time. 
I want to acknowledge the unity dis-
played in the yesterday afternoon 
Rules Committee meeting when Demo-
crats and Republicans came together 
and with one voice condemned Vladi-
mir Putin’s blatant aggression, his bru-
tality, and the horrific actions the 
Russian state is now taking against the 
people of Ukraine. It was almost as if 
there was no distinction between polit-
ical parties, and I think that is as it 
should be because Vladimir Putin is 
not a genius, as some have said, and he 
is not smart. He is a bully. He is a dic-
tator. 
I cochair the Human Rights Commis-
sion in Congress. We have done count-
less hearings on his brutality against 
the Russian people. He jails people he 
disagrees with, he kills people he dis-
agrees with, and he tortures people he 
disagrees with. He truly is an inter-
national pariah. 
After this latest action, he will be in 
the same category as Kim Jong-un in 
North Korea. 
So I just want to acknowledge the 
unity yesterday in the Rules Com-
mittee, and I want my Republican 
friends to know how grateful I was to 
have us all speak as one, especially 
during this difficult time. I know it is 
important not just for the Ukrainian 
people but in Russia that we are speak-
ing as one because when people start to 
make excuses for the Russian dictator 
or start to find ways to praise him, 
that gets played on Russian TV and ex-
aggerated in a way to indicate that 
somehow we are not unified here when 
I believe that we are. 
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules 
Committee met and reported a rule, 
House Resolution 950, providing for 
consideration of H.R. 3967, the Hon-
oring Our PACT Act, under a struc-
tured rule. The rule self-executes a 
manager’s amendment from Chairman 
TAKANO, provides 1 hour of general de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs, and makes in order 28 amend-
ments. Lastly, the rule provides en 
bloc authority to Chairman TAKANO 
and provides one motion to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, today we are here to 
stand up for our veterans. For a long 
time now, more and more have been 
speaking out—pleading—to be taken 
seriously about the health impacts of 
the toxic chemicals they dealt with 
while serving our country. 
Many encountered water at military 
bases that were contaminated with 
toxins, like harmful forever chemicals. 
They breathed in toxic fumes at burn 
pits where jet fuel was used to incin-
erate things like paint, petroleum, and 
plastic. And they were exposed with ra-
diation when being tasked to clean up 
after nuclear tests, without being given 
the proper safety equipment. 
These were duties we demanded of 
them. And as a result, many veterans 
have been left to suffer with severe 
health challenges like cancers, infer-
tility, 
and 
respiratory 
conditions. 
Many more have died, and others are 
just too sick to work. 
b 1230 
We aren’t talking about just a few 
people here, Mr. Speaker. We are talk-
ing about millions and millions of vet-
erans who answered the call to serve. 
When they asked us to take care of 
them, for too long, they were just 
brushed aside not just by Congress but 
also by the Department of Defense, 
year after year after year. 
They were told the science wasn’t 
clear. And they were told that pro-
viding the medical care that they need-
ed and that they earned was just too 
high. 
Maybe some bureaucrat somewhere 
viewed denying veterans’ disability 
claims as an exercise in frugality. 
Maybe drowning them in paperwork 
and setting an unreasonably high bar 
to get benefits just became the norm. I 
don’t know. 
But that finally ends here and now, 
Mr. Speaker. The legislation included 
in this rule will cut the burdensome 
red tape. It will streamline the VA’s re-
view process, and it will get veterans 
exposed to toxins the care that they so 
badly need. 
H.R. 3967 tasks the VA with providing 
standardized trainings to better handle 
these claims, and it requires them to 
conduct outreach and provide resources 
to veterans exposed to deadly chemi-
cals. 
Thanks to this bill, no longer will the 
burden to prove toxic exposure be 
placed on veterans themselves. And it 
is about damn time, Mr. Speaker. 
If this bill becomes law, it will help 
an estimated 1.4 million veterans by 
fiscal year 2031. That is something that 
we should all be proud of. 
The Honoring our PACT Act recog-
nizes that just thanking our veterans 
for their service isn’t enough. We must 
back up those words with action. 
Some may suggest that we should 
just maintain the status quo or make 
the scope of this bill much, much 
smaller. Let me remind them that Con-
gress made the choice to spend trillions

of dollars over the last 20 years on 
sending 
our 
servicemembers 
into 
harm’s way. Those decisions came at a 
cost of more than $6 trillion. That is 
trillion with a T. 
How in the world, Mr. Speaker, can 
anyone justify spending trillions of dol-
lars on sending servicemembers to 
fight abroad just to nickel and dime 
them on healthcare costs once they re-
turn home? That is unconscionable. 
Taking care of toxic-exposed vet-
erans is a cost of war, period. If anyone 
here has reservations about paying it, 
they should think long and hard before 
calling for our servicemembers to fight 
in another conflict halfway around the 
world. 
Our veterans put their lives on the 
line for us. They made sacrifices that 
are hard to even imagine. They fought 
to protect us, and they shouldn’t have 
to then fight their country for the ben-
efits that they have earned. 
Let’s take care of our veterans. Let’s 
pass this bill and the underlying legis-
lation. And let’s honor our veterans 
with more than just words. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
I want to thank my good friend, the 
chairman of the Rules Committee, for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I would 
just like to take a moment to recog-
nize someone who absolutely exempli-
fies the bipartisanship and camaraderie 
of the Rules Committee staff, and that 
is James Fitzella. He has worked on 
the Rules Committee for 7 years, and I 
am incredibly sad to say that he is 
leaving us for the private sector. His 
commitment to this institution and 
working across the aisle to get things 
done, that attitude will be truly 
missed. 
He served the Rules Committee with 
integrity, dedication, and unwavering 
optimism. Congressional staff are often 
the unsung heroes of this body and of 
any legislative accomplishment, and 
this is absolutely the truth in James’ 
case. 
I know I speak for everybody on the 
Rules Committee when I extend my 
sincere gratitude to James for his pub-
lic service and wish him our very best. 
I would also be remiss if I didn’t rec-
ognize Jeff Gohringer, who is leaving 
the majority staff after being on the 
Rules Committee for 6 years. I am sure 
Chairman MCGOVERN would agree that 
we would be lost without the excellent 
work from our staff members. 
I know Jeff was an absolutely critical 
part of the team, so I would like to also 
extend my best wishes to Jeff in his fu-
ture endeavors as well. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s talk about the rule 
before us. The rule before us today 
makes in order H.R. 3967, the Honoring 
our PACT Act. 
As an Iraq war veteran, I believe sup-
porting toxic-exposed veterans should 
be of the highest priority. 
Approximately 3.5 million veterans 
who served our Nation after the ter-
rorist attacks of 9/11 were exposed to 
open-air burn pits and other toxins. 
Many of these troops now suffer from 
serious health issues, including rare 
and aggressive cancers, respiratory 
conditions, and other illnesses. Yet, 
they face significant barriers to obtain-
ing help from the VA. 
These men and women put their lives 
on the line to defend our freedoms. We 
must provide them with the care and 
benefits they have earned. 
That is why I am disappointed that 
we are here considering H.R. 3967 rath-
er than voting on the Health Care for 
Burn Pit Veterans Act, a bipartisan 
bill that has already passed the Senate 
by unanimous consent. If we took up 
that bill immediately, it could be 
signed into law by the end of the week, 
ensuring swift delivery of lifesaving 
care for toxic-exposed veterans. 
Instead, here we are, prioritizing a 
bill that must still undergo a lengthy 
analysis process and many legislative 
considerations. We also have to look at 
the impact on the current VA and 
those that are getting benefits now 
from the VA, and the backlog that ex-
ists in our VA system. 
Republicans want to quickly deliver 
help to veterans suffering from toxic 
exposure. The best way to do that is to 
bring the Senate-passed Health Care 
for Burn Pit Veterans Act to the House 
floor. 
Prioritizing H.R. 3967 will only slow 
down the process and delay implemen-
tation of toxic exposure benefits. I, 
therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose 
this rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to thank the gentleman for 
his comments. I just want to say that 
he is right. We could probably pass the 
very short bill that the Republicans 
have put forward, H.R. 6659, and send it 
to the President. But our bill, which is 
actually more than 80 pages, goes into 
much more depth and covers a lot 
more. 
Republicans want to do just a little 
bit. We want to actually solve the chal-
lenges that so many of our veterans 
face. 
By the way, Mr. Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the Statement of Adminis-
tration Policy, which states that Presi-
dent Biden would basically sign the bill 
we are discussing here today into law. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 3967—HONORING OUR PROMISE TO ADDRESS 
COMPREHENSIVE
TOXICS
(PACT)
ACT—REP. 
TAKANO, D–CALIFORNIA AND 100 COSPONSORS 
The Administration strongly supports H.R. 
3967, which would expand veterans’ access to 
health care and benefits to address the 
health effects of harmful environmental ex-
posures that occurred during military serv-
ice. 
The President believes that our Nation has 
only one truly sacred obligation: to properly 
prepare and equip our service members when 
we send them into harm’s way and to care 
for them and their families when they return 
home. Far too often, military service comes 
with a cost, and we owe it to our veterans 
and their families to address these con-
sequences comprehensively. Unfortunately, 
it has taken decades to understand the dele-
terious effects of environmental exposures— 
leaving too many without access to the bene-
fits and services they need. 
H.R. 3967 would make changes to the defi-
nitions for who is eligible for VA health care 
based on presumed toxic exposure during 
military service, including from bum pits, 
radiation, or other environmental condi-
tions. H.R. 3967 would also make changes to 
the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA’s) 
process for determining presumptive service 
connection and mandate several research 
studies related to military related environ-
mental exposures. It would also establish 
new registries related to exposures, which 
would provide new data on the long-term im-
pacts from environmental exposures. H.R. 
3697 also would allow a Federal cause of ac-
tion related to contaminated water at Camp 
Lejeune, North Carolina and establish train-
ing requirements for health providers, and 
require an outreach plan to educate veterans 
about their eligibility for benefits and serv-
ices related to toxic exposure. 
The Administration looks forward to work-
ing with the Congress to enact this legisla-
tion and ensuring it is effectively imple-
mented. We must address the toxic legacy of 
environmental exposures sustained by vet-
erans during their military service and ful-
fill our sacred obligation to our veterans, 
their families, caregivers, and survivors. We 
must also ensure that VA has the resources 
it needs to implement this legislation. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. We have an oppor-
tunity today to move a bill forward 
that will pass the House, even if many 
Republicans will not vote for it; send it 
to the Senate; get them to act on it; 
and send to the President a bill for him 
to sign that will actually do the job 
and be more than just a press release. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she 
may consume to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), a distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of today’s rule. 
As we work with President Biden to 
build a better America, we must honor 
our debt to our veterans for their serv-
ice and sacrifice on behalf of our coun-
try. 
There are obvious risks and sacrifices 
in military service: the physical and 
mental challenges, time away from 
loved ones, and the possibility that one 
may be called upon to make the ulti-
mate sacrifice for one’s country. But 
there are hidden risks and sacrifices as 
well, and our failure to address them 
means that, for too long, we have not 
met the needs of veterans who have 
been exposed to toxic substances dur-
ing the course of their military service, 
as they have suffered from chronic res-
piratory illness, cancer, and a variety 
of other maladies later in life. 
The most well-known example of this 
is Agent Orange. It took years of vet-
erans’ advocacy for the government to 
acknowledge and provide services and 
treatment for injuries caused by Agent 
Orange. 
Even as the connections between ill-
ness and exposure to Agent Orange

have multiplied, new links have been 
established between exposure to other 
toxic substances during military serv-
ice and chronic and life-threatening 
diseases. The burn pits used at military 
installations across the globe are a 
more recent example. 
The Honoring our PACT bill enacts 
long-overdue support for over 3 million 
veterans suffering from illnesses due to 
exposure to toxins and radiation during 
military service. This comprehensive 
bill will cut red tape to getting vet-
erans benefits, allowing veterans ex-
posed to chemical, airborne, and radio-
active hazards to receive full health 
benefits to treat illnesses related to 
that exposure. 
We owe it to our vets to pass this bill 
and provide them with the benefits 
they deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to highlight 
my amendment to the Honoring our 
PACT Act, which will provide addi-
tional funding to ensure that the VA 
can implement the new benefits that 
this bill will authorize. 
I strongly encourage all of my col-
leagues to support the rule, the PACT 
Act, and my amendment when they are 
considered on the House floor. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Just a quick point of rebuttal. I 
would just remind my good friend from 
Massachusetts that passage of H.R. 3967 
is not guaranteed in the Senate. 
We don’t have that concern when we 
are talking about the Health Care for 
Burn Pit Veterans Act, which has al-
ready passed the Senate by unanimous 
consent. We could pass that today here 
on the floor this week. It could be 
signed into law this week. Doing any-
thing other is simply to delay assist-
ance to the veterans who need it most. 
Now, to the topic of Ukraine. In the 
wake of Vladimir Putin’s brutal, brutal 
invasion of Ukraine, the world is cry-
ing out for an alternative to Russian 
energy. Pennsylvania, and the rest of 
America’s 
heartland, 
could 
provide 
that alternative. 
But President Biden and Congres-
sional Democrats refuse to let that 
happen. They would rather promote 
their radical Green New Deal agenda 
and continue buying oil from Putin’s 
ruthless regime. They would rather do 
that than unleash domestic energy pro-
duction, and that includes Pennsyl-
vania coal, oil, and natural gas indus-
tries. They would rather do that than 
lower gas and heating prices for Amer-
ican families and strengthen our na-
tional security through becoming an 
energy exporter. 
Republicans, on the other hand, actu-
ally want to make America energy 
independent once again, just like we 
were in the last administration. 
That is why, Mr. Speaker, if we de-
feat the previous question, I will per-
sonally offer an amendment to the rule 
to immediately consider the American 
Energy Independence from Russia Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with any 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Here to ex-
plain the amendment is one of the 
bill’s authors, the Natural Resources 
Committee ranking member and my 
good friend. I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN). 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, as 
we witness an evil empire trying to re-
make itself, I reflect on Mrs. Bolin’s 
first grade class in my tiny rural 
school in the heartland of America and, 
as a 6-year-old living during the Cold 
War, trying to understand how crouch-
ing under a desk as part of our nuclear 
attack drill would save anyone. The 
simple truth is, it wouldn’t. 
Crouching, hiding, and being intimi-
dated only emboldens Communists. 
Standing up strong is how you beat the 
evils of communism. 
Last year, I had the great experience 
of standing at the Brandenburg Gate in 
Berlin, where Ronald Reagan spoke 
those famous words in 1987: ‘‘Mr. 
Gorbachev, tear down this wall.’’ 
Remarkably, less than 21⁄2
years 
later, that wall came down, and by the 
end of 1991, the evil Soviet empire had 
dissolved. The Soviet Union was gone, 
but the seeds of the evil in the Com-
munist government of Russia and other 
parts of the world still remain. 
As brave Ukrainians are fighting a 
David and Goliath type battle of sur-
vival, we must stand strong and create 
a long-term plan to crush the Russian 
energy grip on Europe and our allies. 
Energy 
revenue feeds the Russian 
beast, and we have the resources and 
the technology to starve it to death. 
Only a few years ago, the United 
States became energy independent. But 
my, how quickly things have changed. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipe-
line that could have reduced our reli-
ance on Russian oil. But it is not just 
Keystone. All U.S. pipeline projects are 
being held up, and Russian hackers 
even attacked our existing pipelines 
with no recourse. 
A week into office, the Biden admin-
istration doubled down on their anti- 
American energy agenda, ordering an 
indefinite freeze on new oil and gas 
leasing and, to this day, has issued zero 
new leases on Federal lands or waters. 
President Biden’s policies are choos-
ing Russian oil and Russian jobs over 
American energy and our own national 
security. In fact, in 2021, U.S. imports 
from Russia reached an 11-year high, 
and we are sending tens of millions of 
our dollars every day to fund Putin’s 
war machine. 
Why are we doing this to ourselves 
when we have so many resources at our 
fingertips? 
Our bill is simple, and it stands up to 
Russian aggression by going after their 
major source of funding. It will em-
power U.S. domestic production by im-
mediately approving the Keystone XL 
pipeline; by restarting the oil and gas 
leasing program on Federal lands and 
waters; by requiring President Biden to 
submit an energy security plan to Con-
gress; by unleashing liquefied natural 
gas exports to displace Russian gas 
abroad; 
and, 
finally, 
requiring 
drawdowns from the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to be replaced by in-
creased Federal oil and gas leasing. 
I ask my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to stand up strong and join 
Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS and me in co-
sponsoring the legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield the gentleman an additional 
15 seconds. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. I urge my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question 
so that our legislation can be consid-
ered immediately by the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
b 1245 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we begin on a note of 
basically saying that it was wonderful 
that we were all united in standing up 
to Vladimir Putin and speaking with 
one voice. I think we need to kind of 
amend that at this point. 
Let me just say that we need to stand 
with the people of Ukraine. We need to 
stand with President Zelensky, who 
has had the guts to stand up to Vladi-
mir Putin, but also to the former 
President who tried to extort him and 
who withheld essential defensive mili-
tary aid in exchange for trying to get 
from him some manufactured dirt on 
the President’s son. Let’s be a little bit 
careful about what charges we are 
throwing around here. 
Again, I am sorry that my Repub-
lican colleagues are feeling the need to 
come here and play partisan politics in 
the middle of a global crisis, but I 
guess I shouldn’t be surprised. 
Yet, for all their criticism on how 
this administration is handling the cri-
sis in Ukraine, they have been all over 
the map on what they would do dif-
ferently. They talk about energy inde-
pendence, yet they are the ones who 
have consistently voted against and op-
posed green and renewable energy here 
at home, which is the fastest way to 
achieve real energy independence. 
I include in the RECORD a February 23 
Washington Post opinion piece entitled 
‘‘Republicans say Biden is ‘weak’ on 
Ukraine. What would they do dif-
ferently?’’ By the way, just a spoiler 
alert, the answer is: They have no idea. 
[From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 2022] 
OPINION: REPUBLICANS SAY BIDEN IS ‘WEAK’ 
ON UKRAINE. WHAT WOULD THEY DO DIF-
FERENTLY? 
(By Paul Waldman) 
There was a time in American history 
when foreign crises were considered a mo-
ment for unity. We said ‘‘politics stops at

March 1, 2022 
the water’s edge,’’ meaning that partisanship 
had to be put aside so the country could 
show the world a united front, and both par-
ties usually agreed. 
The public acted that way, too. Presidents’ 
approval ratings would rise whenever we 
found ourselves in any sort of conflict with a 
foreign adversary; this was called the ‘‘rally 
’round the flag effect,’’ and it occurred even 
when things went badly. For instance, Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter’s approval ratings shot 
up by almost 30 points after Americans were 
taken hostage in Tehran. 
But no more. Even the most straight-
forward of foreign policy challenges become 
yet another opportunity for the opposition 
to say the president is a failure and a villain, 
which is what Republicans are doing now as 
we confront Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s 
invasion of Ukraine. 
But that doesn’t mean the Republican 
Party can decide what it believes. 
One of Donald Trump’s legacies is that in 
some GOP quarters, Putin is now regarded as 
akin to a hero. That starts with Trump him-
self, who reacted to the invasion by calling 
Putin’s aggression ‘‘genius,’’ ‘‘smart,’’ and 
‘‘savvy.’’ Meanwhile, Fox News host Tucker 
Carlson has been so relentless in passing on 
the Kremlin’s perspective that Russian state 
TV regularly airs clips from his show. 
That exacerbates the profoundly unsettled 
nature of contemporary foreign policy think-
ing in the GOP. The right has struggled to 
find a singular voice over the past 15 years or 
so, once the thrill of the Global War on Ter-
ror ran aground in the disaster of the Iraq 
War. 
In the 2016 presidential primaries, Repub-
lican candidates struggled over whether and 
how to call the war a mistake, and where 
that would leave the party’s traditional 
hawkishness. Then Trump took over, with 
less a foreign policy doctrine than a shifting 
collection of impulses, including a distrust 
of ambitious adventures and an obsequious-
ness toward Putin that can be described only 
as pathetic. 
So how should a Republican hawk respond 
to the current crisis? The answer is clear: 
Just make it about President Biden. 
The GOP critique is both blessedly free of 
substance and plays right into the anxieties 
about manhood that determine approxi-
mately 75 percent of everything Republicans 
do these days. 
So whether you’re a Putin fanboy or a cold 
warrior, you can agree that the real problem 
here is weakness. Why is this crisis hap-
pening? Because Biden is weak. What should 
America do now? Not be weak, because Biden 
is weak. Is your favorite baseball team going 
to win the pennant this year? They would, if 
Biden wasn’t so weak. 
‘‘Biden weakness invited Russian aggres-
sion, Republicans say,’’ reads a Fox News 
headline. Biden is ‘‘the weakest president 
that America has ever had,’’ says former 
Trump administration ambassador to United 
Nations Nikki Haley. ‘‘No one fears this pa-
thetic old geezer’’ says the National Review. 
The House Republican Conference tweeted 
a picture of Biden, with the caption ‘‘This is 
what weakness on the world stage looks 
like.’’ Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the 
third-ranking Republican in the House, 
tweeted, ‘‘Biden is unfit to serve as Com-
mander-in-Chief. He has consistently given 
into Putin’s demands and shown nothing but 
weakness.’’ 
Though some Republicans say the sanc-
tions at the center of Biden’s strategy should 
have started earlier, you’ll have a hard time 
finding one who can specify in any detail 
what Biden’s ‘‘weakness’’ toward Russia has 
consisted of to this point, nor what a 
‘‘strong’’ president would be doing instead. 
Mounting a ground invasion to take Mos-
cow? Launching nuclear weapons? What? 
If the answer is ‘‘What Biden is doing, but, 
you know, more,’’ that’s not very persuasive. 
But as far as they’re concerned, ‘‘strength’’ 
isn’t something presidents demonstrate with 
their actions; it’s more of an ineffable qual-
ity that Republican presidents possess by 
definition while Democratic presidents lack. 
Consider Trump. Short of literally getting 
down on his hands and knees to shine Putin’s 
shoes, there’s almost no way you could imag-
ine Trump having been weaker toward Putin 
than he actually was. Trump continually 
praised the Russian dictator, dismissed his 
misdeeds and went out of his way to deni-
grate NATO—just as Putin would want. 
It culminated in the utterly disgraceful 
display at the 2018 summit in Helsinki, when 
Trump was asked about Russian interference 
in the 2016 election and declared he was tak-
ing Putin’s word over the analysis of U.S. in-
telligence 
agencies, 
because 
‘‘President 
Putin was extremely strong and powerful in 
his denial today.’’ 
It was so embarrassing that even Repub-
licans were shocked; then-Sen. Bob Corker of 
Tennessee said Trump ‘‘made us look like a 
pushover.’’ Sen. John McCain called it ‘‘one 
of the most disgraceful performances by an 
American president in memory.’’ Neverthe-
less, today Republicans claim that when it 
came to Russia, Trump was a paragon of 
strength. 
And however this crisis ends, they will in-
sist that everything would have worked out 
far better if only Biden were stronger. What-
ever that means. 
To be clear, everyone has the right to criti-
cize the president; having politics end at the 
water’s edge brings its own problems. Nor is 
there anything wrong with intraparty dif-
ferences. But rather than a lively debate 
over alternative courses of action, what 
we’re seeing now from the GOP is mostly ju-
venile name-calling. 
Not that we had much reason to expect 
anything different. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ROSS), a distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, today, thou-
sands of veterans struggle with the 
health effects of exposure to hazardous 
substances during their training or de-
ployment. Congress has an obligation 
to provide these men and women with 
the resources, including healthcare 
services, they need to live with dignity. 
The Honoring our PACT Act fulfills 
this duty by streamlining VA processes 
to receive care for toxic exposure-re-
lated illnesses, reducing the burden on 
all veterans. It also takes preemptive 
measures to ensure that the VA con-
ducts research to track and identify 
emerging toxins. This will ensure that 
we are proactive in our efforts to safe-
guard the health of future veterans. 
I am particularly pleased that this 
bill includes the Camp Lejeune Justice 
Act, which gives our servicemembers 
the opportunity to seek compensation 
for exposure to contaminated water at 
Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in 
North Carolina. 
For decades, marines and their fami-
lies stationed at this base unknowingly 
consumed, bathed in, and used water 
containing harmful chemicals and in-
dustrial solvents. As a result of their 
service, many veterans and their fam-
ily members now suffer from serious 
medical conditions, including cancer 
and birth defects. 
For years, North Carolina law pre-
vented these individuals from seeking 
relief in court. The Camp Lejeune Jus-
tice Act rights this wrong, bringing 
long overdue justice to affected vet-
erans. 
The Honoring our PACT Act also cre-
ates a registry of veterans exposed to 
PFAS, or forever chemicals, from use 
of fire extinguishing agents in military 
installations. I proposed an amendment 
to this section with my colleague from 
North 
Carolina, 
Representative 
ROUZER, which will require the Depart-
ment of Defense to study additional 
sources of PFAS exposure on military 
bases and make recommendations to 
expand eligibility for toxic exposure 
benefits accordingly. I am grateful that 
this amendment was made in order. We 
owe our Nation’s veterans an immeas-
urable debt for putting their lives on 
the line to defend our freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the rule and 
the underlying bill. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the best ways 
that we can support the Ukrainian peo-
ple, and President Zelensky by exten-
sion, is by ensuring that we have a 
steady supply of American energy and 
that we are supplying our allies in 
Eastern Europe. This will also deny 
Putin a major revenue stream. 
Alarmingly, U.S. oil imports from 
Russia reached an 11-year high in 2021, 
accounting for more than 10 percent of 
the total U.S. crude oil and petroleum 
product imports. 
Here to explain why that should con-
cern all Americans is my good friend, 
my mentor, the ranking member of the 
Rules Committee, TOM COLE. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE). 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Pennsylvania for yielding. 
It is imperative that we defeat the 
previous question so that we can bring 
up the American Energy Independence 
from Russia Act for immediate consid-
eration. 
Mr. Speaker, last week, Vladimir 
Putin sent shock waves around the 
world by launching a full-scale inva-
sion of Ukraine. Though much of the 
planet has rallied to support Ukraine 
in their heroic defense, Putin has 
begun to use his most potent weapon to 
threaten Western democracies. That 
weapon is dependence of much of the 
world on Russian oil and gas. 
Not even the United States is im-
mune 
from 
this 
national 
security 
threat. In 2021, according to the Amer-
ican Fuel and Petrochemical Manufac-
turers, the United States imported an 
average of 209,000 barrels of crude oil 
per day and 500,000 barrels per day of 
other petroleum products from Russia. 
It is unconscionable that we are still 
this reliant on imports from authori-
tarian countries like Russia. This reli-
ance on bad actors for our energy sup-
ply needs poses a clear and present

danger to the security of the United 
States, just as it poses a threat to the 
security of Western and Central Eu-
rope. 
At any time, Vladimir Putin could 
choose to retaliate on the dozens of 
countries that have imposed sanctions 
on him and his regime by simply turn-
ing off the spigot. Gas prices in the 
United States would undoubtedly in-
crease, even more than they currently 
are, and much of Europe will be 
plunged into the cold in the depths of 
winter. That is a potent leverage for a 
dictator like Putin to have. We must 
counter this by restoring America’s en-
ergy independence and helping our 
friends and allies to do the same. 
Unfortunately, when President Biden 
took office, he immediately took steps 
that ultimately harmed America’s en-
ergy independence and made us more 
reliant on foreign energy imports. That 
included his decision to cancel the 
Keystone XL pipeline, which was ex-
pected to transport 830,000 barrels of oil 
every day, and his decision to impose a 
moratorium on new oil and gas leasing 
on Federal lands, including my home 
State of Oklahoma. President Biden’s 
actions have made America less energy 
secure and more vulnerable to foreign 
threats. 
This is why we need the American 
Energy Independence from Russia Act 
more than ever. This bill would imme-
diately approve the Keystone XL pipe-
line, would restart oil and gas leasing 
on Federal lands and waters, and would 
expand liquid natural gas exports at a 
time when Europe needs them the 
most. It would ensure an all-of-the- 
above energy policy that paves the way 
for American energy independence, and 
it would rightly end the ongoing vili-
fication of America’s oil and gas indus-
try. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is simply com-
mon sense. With one bill, we can open 
up new sources of energy and reduce or 
eliminate imports of foreign sources of 
energy. Above all, by advancing this 
bill, we can improve the security of the 
United States, and weaken Vladimir 
Putin’s most potent weapon in one fell 
swoop. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
not going to respond, because I like the 
gentleman too much. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I would 
like to begin by thanking Chairman 
TAKANO for his incredible leadership on 
this legislation and tireless work on 
behalf of veterans all across our coun-
try. 
H.R. 3967, the Honoring our PACT 
Act of 2021, recognizes the full range of 
military toxic exposure, from contami-
nated water at military bases and air-
borne hazards from burn pits, to radi-
ation from atomic testing. It upholds 
and recognizes the promise we made to 
every servicemember that we would 
care for them should they become 
wounded or sick while risking every-
thing to protect this country. 
This legislation is long overdue, and 
it is the least we can do for the more 
than 3.5 million veterans who are cur-
rently suffering without the healthcare 
they need and deserve. 
These veterans and their loved ones 
should never have been forced to come 
to Congress demanding that we and the 
VA provide the care they have so clear-
ly earned, which is why I am glad that 
this bill ensures that future veterans 
will be able to get the help they need 
without waiting decades for help by 
streamlining the VA’s toxic exposure 
presumptions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan bill. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, one in six American 
adults reported they cannot pay their 
full energy bill in the last 12 months. 
That is appalling. It is especially ap-
palling given the fact that at our fin-
gertips we have an abundance of en-
ergy. In Pennsylvania alone, we have 
oil, gas, and clean coal. We should be 
unleashing the American energy sec-
tor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. 
HERRELL), who is here to talk more 
about this. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the previous question so that 
the rule can be amended to consider 
H.R. 6858, the American Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act offered by 
my 
colleagues, 
Ranking 
Member 
MCMORRIS RODGERS and Ranking Mem-
ber WESTERMAN. 
The Biden administration has taken 
seemingly every step possible since 
taking office to cripple the energy 
dominance agenda of the Trump ad-
ministration that saw America become 
an energy-independent Nation for the 
first time in decades. 
In New Mexico, the Biden adminis-
tration has yet to hold a lease sale 
since taking office, which is a direct 
violation of Federal law. By not hold-
ing a lease sale, the Biden administra-
tion is robbing the citizens of New 
Mexico of revenues that could be used 
to improve vital services like our pub-
lic education system. 
By artificially reducing our energy 
production, we are only increasing 
Russia’s power in the world. Since the 
beginning of 2020, imports of Russian 
oil into the U.S. have increased by 
nearly 300,000 barrels a day. This is a 
direct result of the Biden administra-
tion flipping the switch and taking dis-
astrous executive actions that prevent 
energy development here at home. Our 
increased 
dependency 
on 
foreign 
sources of energy is causing energy 
prices for our constituents to sky-
rocket. Gas prices are up over 50 per-
cent, which is hitting our constituents 
hard every time they go to the pump 
and every time they buy groceries or 
heat their homes. 
If we get back to producing energy at 
the capacity that we are capable of, 
our energy supply will be secure, gas 
prices will fall, and economic outlook 
will vastly improve. Advancing innova-
tion and increasing U.S. production is 
the only effective way to achieve 
American prosperity and reduce global 
reliance on Russia. 
By accepting the status quo of being 
an energy-dependent Nation, my Demo-
cratic colleagues are willfully weak-
ening both our national and economic 
security. 
H.R. 6858 will change the course of 
American energy policy and bring back 
the era of American energy dominance. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the pre-
vious question and support the Amer-
ican Energy Independence from Russia 
Act. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, two quick things. One, 
my friends are touting this whatever it 
is, this all-of-the-above approach to 
dealing with our energy challenges. 
But I am looking at this proposal, and 
it just seems it is the same old, same 
old, fossil fuels, fossil fuels, fossil fuels. 
I wonder who wrote this. I wonder 
where this came from. 
Why isn’t there any mention of green 
energy or clean energy or solar energy 
or renewable energy, any of the things 
that, quite frankly, the majority of the 
American people want us to do? Why 
isn’t it here? 
Well, I will make a suggestion to peo-
ple who are tuning in: Follow the 
money. Follow the money. This is Big 
Oil’s wish list. If you want to continue 
to find ourselves in circumstances, 
whenever there is an international cri-
sis, that we have to kowtow to Big Oil, 
then listen to them. 
But on the Democratic side, we want 
to wean ourselves off of the same old, 
same old. And ‘‘all-of-the-above,’’ by 
the way, is not just oil, oil, oil. 
The second thing I want to say is 
that my friends on the other side al-
ways love to talk about how much they 
support our veterans. Well, we actually 
have a bill here that will support our 
veterans. It is a big deal. You all re-
ceived a letter from all the leading vet-
erans’ service organizations of this 
country saying to please pass this bill. 
They don’t want to talk about it. 
They say: Oh, support this minuscule 
bill, the alternative that we are put-
ting up here, by the way, which our 
veterans’ organizations do not prefer. 
If you really want to help our vet-
erans, if you are sincere about what 
you say when you say let’s support our 
veterans, then how about voting that 
way. Talk is cheap around here. How 
about putting your vote where your 
rhetoric is and supporting this under-
lying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH).

women who sign up, serve in Afghani-
stan, in Iraq, and they are going know-
ing that they are representing us, and 
they will take on the challenges and 
the dangers of combat. They do that 
willingly. 
But why is it that we create an extra 
hazard within our control by creating 
these burn pits and assign men and 
women to be breathing that toxic air? 
It is not right. This legislation, Hon-
oring our PACT Act, finally acknowl-
edges that that was wrong and that we 
have a duty to every one of those vet-
erans. 
In Vermont—and I know, Mr. Speak-
er, it is in your State as well; you have 
been a leader on this—there has been 
tragedy with cancers to young men and 
women, fathers, moms. 
In our State, Pat Cram and June 
Heston both lost their wonderful hus-
bands, Sergeant Major Michael Cram 
and Brigadier General Michael Heston, 
to cancer. Those women have started a 
movement in Vermont that has sup-
ported this legislation that finally is 
going to do for these veterans what we 
did for the Vietnam veterans with 
Agent Orange and establish a presump-
tion that this was combat related. It is 
overdue, and it is necessary. 
So I thank all of the men and women 
on both sides of the aisle who are 
standing up to acknowledge that our 
obligation is to take care of the war-
rior and his or her family after they 
have served us so well. 
This is overdue legislation. Let’s pass 
it by unanimous consent. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, just three quick points in rebuttal. 
First and foremost, I myself am a vet-
eran of the Iraq war. I was there for 6 
months, actually, in 2009. 
If we would just pass the Health Care 
for Burn Pit Veterans Act that the 
Senate passed by unanimous consent, 
we could pass that and put it on the 
President’s desk at the end of this 
week. There is nothing standing in our 
way except the Democratic Party on 
this. 
Also, I would just remind my good 
friend from Massachusetts that my mo-
tion does not prevent the House from 
considering the Honoring our PACT 
Act. It doesn’t. It simply amends the 
rule to also allow for consideration of 
the American Energy Independence 
from Russia Act. 
I am sure everyone on the other side 
of the aisle would agree that lowering 
gas and heating prices for all American 
families and ending our dependence on 
Russian oil is of the utmost impor-
tance. In fact, I just got an alert that 
a gentleman from my colleague’s State 
General Assembly just put forward a 
bill on the floor of the General Assem-
bly of Massachusetts to stop the impor-
tation of Russian oil. 
Sixty percent of the natural gas our 
country imports actually goes to Mas-
sachusetts. People don’t realize that. 
But if New York would get out of the 
way and allow Pennsylvania to have a 
pipeline from Pennsylvania to New 
England, the New Englanders wouldn’t 
need dirty Russian oil. They could use 
Pennsylvania natural gas. But I di-
gress. We can and should find the time 
this week to add the American Energy 
Independence from Russia Act to our 
agenda. 
Lastly, ad nauseam, I have heard bill 
after bill after bill from the leftists 
across the other side of the aisle on 
electric vehicles, and yet again I am 
reminded that the Republicans are the 
real party of science because if you 
look at the actual science, an electric 
car will generate just 23 percent fewer 
greenhouse gas emissions than a gaso-
line-powered car. 
In fact, if you were to take every gas- 
powered car on the face of the planet 
and get rid of it, it would only mean a 
mere 1.8 percent decline in total emis-
sions. This is fake science. We have al-
chemy and chemistry. We have astrol-
ogy and we have astronomy. We have 
the Democrat Party and we have the 
Republican Party. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. 
ARMSTRONG), my good friend, to talk 
more about this. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, my 
hometown of Dickinson, North Dakota, 
is in the southern part of the Bakken 
oil patch. It is where we unleashed this 
revolutionary technology of shale hy-
draulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, 
and producing natural gas. But you 
know what else? Eighteen miles away 
from my childhood hometown is an 
ethanol plant. Seven miles to the west 
is a biodiesel plant. Thirteen miles 
south, fourteen miles south is the larg-
est wind farm in North Dakota genera-
tion of Brady I and Brady II. About 80 
miles to the northeast we are figuring 
out how to strip rare earth metals out 
of lignite coal so we can be less depend-
ent on Russia and China in all of those 
issues. 
The people who work and live in my 
communities 
grow 
all 
the 
cereal 
grains, and the by-products from the 
ethanol plant are fed as feedstock to 
our cattle industry, so I don’t need lec-
tures from anyone on all-of-the-above 
energy, particularly when the left’s 
version of all-of-the-above energy is 
solely wind, solar, rainbows, unicorns. 
Here is the dirty little secret: The 
world is going to burn more carbon in 
2 years whether we shut down domestic 
production or not, and this naive and 
idealistic viewpoint that if we shut 
down American industry, American in-
genuity, then the rest of the world will 
follow along is fundamental differen-
tial to the fact we are watching it play 
out in real time. 
Our strategic adversaries and, indeed, 
our enemies will fill this space—that is 
the fact—because the world needs these 
products, and they are going to con-
tinue to utilize these products. But at 
least welcome this: We are going to do 
nothing to reduce global carbon emis-
sions because the atmosphere doesn’t 
recognize countries’ borders. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat the previous question, allow this 
to go back, and let us do what we were 
doing so well until the last year, devel-
oping American energy, allowing it to 
be utilized, rather than energy from 
our adversaries. 
I can tell you one last thing, and 
then I will close. In the last year, we 
haven’t had a Federal lease sale in 
North Dakota. Congressional Demo-
crats have tried to ban the transport of 
liquefied natural gas by rail, and so 
let’s be honest about how we got here 
so we can get there in the future. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. It is amazing, Mr. 
Speaker, we are here talking about a 
major veterans bill, and the gentleman 
couldn’t even bring himself to mention 
veterans once in his statement. 
To the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania, talking about taking all cars off 
the road, who is talking about that? I 
will tell the gentleman that if we go 
ahead with what he wants to do on the 
Keystone pipeline, that is equivalent to 
adding another 5 million cars on the 
road. That is what that would mean to 
our environment. 
My Republican friends, if they want 
to think small when it comes to vet-
erans, have at it. Veterans’ organiza-
tions are watching. We are hearing 
from veterans all across the country 
who want this bill passed. They want 
us to pass this comprehensive bill. We 
will do that. 
If you want to do your minuscule 
bill, you have a substitute, you can 
vote for it. It is in your substitute. We 
want to actually do something in a 
comprehensive way to meet the con-
cerns that our veterans have expressed 
for years and years and years. If you 
want to take a pass, go ahead. That is 
what you do on our most important 
issues. This probably is no exception. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
PRICE). 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the rule 
for the Honoring our PACT Act, which 
includes the Camp Lejeune Justice Act. 
This legislation would allow marines 
and their families who were exposed to 
contaminated drinking water at Camp 
Lejeune over 34 years—34 years of ne-
glect and denial—finally to pursue 
their long overdue day in court. 
Toxicity rates in Camp Lejeune’s 
water were staggering. They ranged 
from 240 to 3,400 times what is per-
mitted 
by 
today’s 
national 
safety 
standards. This greatly increased the 
risk of cancers, adverse birth out-
comes, and other medical tragedies. 
And now many veterans and their fam-
ilies are suffering from no legal re-
course. 
The Camp Lejeune Justice Act will 
correct an anomaly in North Carolina 
law by providing a legal pathway for 
affected veterans and their families to 
pursue fair compensation, which would 
already be permitted had their expo-
sure occurred anywhere else except the 
State of North Carolina. 
Today’s effort is a culmination of the 
decades-long bipartisan campaign to

provide servicemembers affected an op-
portunity for justice long deferred. 
First by Congressman Brad Miller and 
Senator BURR, as well as the late Con-
gressman Walter Jones. 
I am also grateful for the tireless ad-
vocacy of the affected marines and 
their families, the sustained efforts of 
diverse groups of supporters, and my 
congressional colleagues, including the 
bill’s 
sponsors, 
Congressmen 
MATT 
CARTWRIGHT and GREG MURPHY. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of 
the rule for this Honoring our PACT 
Act and with it the adoption of the 
Camp Lejeune Justice Act, a critical 
step to honor the promises we have 
made to our veterans. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), my good 
friend and the Republican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Pennsylvania for yield-
ing. First of all, opposing the previous 
question, the bill that is going to be 
coming up later is a very partisan bill. 
We could actually bring up the Senate 
bill for our veterans that passed the 
Senate unanimously. Imagine in these 
times when a bill passed the Senate 
unanimously, and Democrats in the 
majority won’t even bring that bill up, 
which clearly is the way to help our 
veterans. 
But there is something more impor-
tant that we can do today, dealing with 
the crisis in Ukraine. There are many 
crises in America, but in Ukraine 
Putin is running roughshod over the 
people of Ukraine, carpet bombing cit-
ies. One of the ways he is fueling his 
war is with oil that America and other 
countries are buying because President 
Biden took American energy off the 
table. 
There are very specific things Presi-
dent Biden does that if we reject this 
previous question, we can turn around 
and bring up this legislation by my col-
leagues, the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington (Mrs. RODGERS) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN), that actually open up 
American energy and take leverage 
away from Putin and also take billions 
of dollars away from Putin that he is 
using to finance the war. 
Let’s talk about a few of those very 
specific things we can do with rejecting 
the previous question to bring up this 
important energy legislation. When 
President Biden came in office, he did 
a number of very specific things to un-
dermine American energy. Not energy 
all over the world. He is begging OPEC 
and Russia to produce more oil. Think 
how tone deaf that is, begging Russia 
to produce more oil. Let’s open up our 
American energy reserves that Presi-
dent Biden shut off. Let’s approve LNG 
exports so we can help Europe get en-
ergy from America, not from Russia. 
President Biden hasn’t approved a sin-
gle LNG facility in over a year or pipe-
line. Let’s get rid of the red tape that 
they are using. Do you know that Rus-
sia right now is making $700 million a 
day by selling oil to America, EU, and 
U.K.? $700 million a day to fund his war 
against Ukraine. Let’s end it by open-
ing up American energy reserves. Re-
verse all these radical policies by 
President Biden that are emboldening 
Putin. Let’s reject this. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would remind the gentleman that 
President Biden didn’t try to extort 
President 
Zelensky 
by 
withholding 
money to get him to manufacture dirt 
on one of his political opponents. But I 
find this a little bit comical. 
My Republican friends say that they 
want to bring up this Senate bill, 
which is much narrower than what we 
are doing right now, yet they want you 
to defeat the previous question not so 
they can bring up that Senate bill, but 
so they can bring up this giveaway to 
the oil companies. Again, follow the 
money. Follow the money. This is a 
bill that was written in some back 
room in some oil company and, quite 
frankly, it is unconscionable. They 
never let a crisis go to waste. 
Today we are talking about trying to 
help our veterans, and it would be nice 
if on this one issue of helping our vet-
erans we could all come together, but I 
guess that is asking too much. 
I now yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CART-
WRIGHT). 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I 
could not be prouder that the Honoring 
our PACT Act includes my bill, the 
Camp Lejeune Justice Act, and let me 
tell you why I wrote this bill. Between 
1953 and 1987, two generations of ma-
rines and marine families and employ-
ees at Camp Lejeune were poisoned by 
the water at Camp Lejeune. Poisoned 
by water that by today’s standards in 
health, 240 to 3,400 times the level of 
acceptable toxins was in that water. 
This was water that the marines drank. 
It was in the mess halls. It was water 
they showered with. It was water that 
they drank out from the water buf-
faloes and filled their canteens from 
while on exercise. This is water that 
was poisoned, and it not only poisoned 
the water of marines but also the ma-
rine families and the employees at 
Camp Lejeune. 
Mr. Speaker, when marines volunteer 
for Marine duty, they know they are up 
for something dangerous. They know 
that the Marines pride themselves on 
being the first to fight. They know 
they are going to be in harm’s way at 
some point, but when they went to 
Camp Lejeune for combat training, 
they didn’t realize what their real 
enemy was going to be. It was going to 
be leukemia, bladder cancer, kidney 
cancer, aplastic anemia, liver cancer, 
multiple 
myeloma, 
non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma, Parkinson’s disease. Not 
only the marines, but their families 
were subject to this from the water. 
I would like to thank the people who 
helped put together this bill, DAVID 
PRICE, GREG
MURPHY, the Reverend 
William Barber, the veterans service 
organizations, 
151 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats who came together on this 
bill. 
Folks, at long last, all of these great 
marines, these great Americans will 
get a shot at justice. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on the PQ, ‘‘yes’’ on the rule, and 
let’s vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Honoring our 
PACT Act and the Camp Lejeune Jus-
tice Act. 
b 1315 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, just one point in rebuttal to my 
good friend from Massachusetts: Re-
publicans do support toxic-exposed vet-
erans. Yesterday, I personally offered 
an amendment in the Rules Committee 
to bring up the Health Care for Burn 
Pit Veterans Act. By the way, that 
passed unanimously in the Senate. We 
could again be doing that right now. 
That doesn’t stop us from debating the 
current bill. We can walk and chew 
gum at the same time, but the only 
thing that is delaying getting the Sen-
ate version of this bill on to the Presi-
dent’s desk at the end of this week is 
the Democratic Party. We could pass 
that bill this week. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Louisiana 
(Mr. 
GRAVES) to talk about oil and gas and 
energy issues. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania for yielding. 
I just heard my friends on the other 
side say, let’s follow the money. Let’s 
follow the money. 
Mr. Speaker, right now under this ad-
ministration, we have gone from buy-
ing approximately 76,000 barrels of 
crude oil a day to surging to 198,000 
barrels of crude oil every single day. If 
you add in other petroleum products, 
Mr. Speaker, let’s follow the money. 
The additional $22 million a day that 
we are giving to Vladimir Putin, if you 
add it all up, we are giving him $7 bil-
lion a year. $7 billion a year that goes 
toward the $65 billion Vladimir Putin 
puts towards military spending every 
single year. 
Yes, let’s follow the money. 
I hear my friends on the other side 
talk about emissions, oh, we can’t do 
these things because it is going to 
cause greater emissions. 
Let’s once again look at the facts, 
Mr. Speaker. Under the previous ad-
ministration, on average, emissions 
went down 21⁄2 percent a year. Under 
President Biden they have increased 6.3 
percent every single year. 
Let’s follow the money. 
Do you know who is paying that 
money? It is the Americans that can 
least afford it, whether it is the $12 
extra every single time they are filling 
up their vehicle with gas, whether it is 
the 700 to $1,700 a year in extra elec-
tricity payments that Americans are 
paying this year to heat their homes. 
Mr. Speaker, yes, let’s follow the 
money because the people in America 
that can least afford it, they are the 
ones that are paying the bill for these 
irresponsible, ill-advised energy poli-
cies that, Mr. Speaker, you can go back

and look at the RECORD, we are the 
ones who advocated otherwise. 
Here is the deal: This administration 
has stopped offshore production, pre-
vented new lease sales, prevented on-
shore production. This majority has 
tried to impose a $10,000 per year per 
mile pipeline fee, tried to raise royalty 
fees, increased severance taxes on do-
mestic energy. 
Do you think Vladimir Putin is doing 
the same thing with Russian energy? I 
can answer that, Mr. Speaker: Abso-
lutely not. 
The policies that this bill fixes are 
the errors that this administration and 
this majority in Congress made in im-
posing this energy crisis on us in rais-
ing energy prices for Americans that 
can least afford it. 
Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that the 
facts don’t result in the narrative that 
my friends on the other side are trying 
to establish. Let’s be clear on why we 
have an energy crisis in America, why 
we are dependent upon Vladimir Putin 
for energy, why we are funding the 
military atrocities that he is carrying 
out in the Ukraine right now, and let’s 
support this bill, this legislation that 
Congresswoman 
MCMORRIS
RODGERS 
and Congressman WESTERMAN
have 
pushed to ensure that we can have a 
clean American energy future. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD an April 28, 2021, 
Military.com article titled: ‘‘VA Sec-
retary Wants More Vets Sickened by 
Burn Pits to File Claims, But Many 
Are Still Being Turned Away,’’ and I 
include in the RECORD an April 12, 2021, 
‘‘NBC News’’ article titled: ‘‘Veterans 
Face Uphill Battle to Receive Treat-
ment For ‘Burn Pit’ Exposure.’’ 
[From Military.com, Apr. 28, 2021] 
VA SECRETARY WANTS MORE VETS SICKENED 
BY BURN PITS TO FILE CLAIMS, BUT MANY 
ARE STILL BEING TURNED AWAY 
(By Steve Beynon) 
Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary 
Denis McDonough wants more veterans who 
believe they were sickened by exposure to 
burn pits overseas to seek help from the de-
partment, despite many being turned away. 
‘‘We’re urging vets to come forward with 
their claims,’’ McDonough said at a press 
briefing Monday. ‘‘Our commitment is to 
treat each claim with the care it deserves. 
As we get more claims, we can aggregate 
those claims to draw bigger conclusions.’’ 
As of March 31, the VA had denied 72% of 
burn pit claims, according to agency data ob-
tained by Military.com. Between June 2007 
and March 31, the VA processed 15,640 dis-
ability compensation claims related to burn 
pit exposure. Of those, 3,510 veterans had at 
least one burn pit issue granted. 
The top three diagnoses related to burn 
pits are bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis 
and allergic rhinitis, according to depart-
ment data. The most common reasons for a 
veteran to be denied is not having a diag-
nosed medical condition or being unable to 
connect the condition to their service—43.1% 
and 42.8% of denials, respectively. 
But the data doesn’t reflect the scope of 
the issue. The number of patients filing 
claims might be disproportionately small 
given VA estimates that 3.5 million veterans 
have been exposed to burn pits since 1990. It 
is unclear how many are sick due to their ex-
posure or have died as a result. 
McDonough suggests that more data is 
needed, and he wants more veterans to seek 
help from the VA so officials can get a better 
grasp on the issue. 
The burn pit data also could be inherently 
flawed. To get the data, the VA had to use 
text mining, searching for keywords such as 
‘‘burn pit’’ and ‘‘burn pits’’ in its patient 
databases, according to department records. 
This means patients coming forward with 
issues related to burn pits might not auto-
matically be listed as burn pit patients if 
that phrase wasn’t used in their records. 
Out of the 2.5 million Global War on Ter-
rorism veterans, 781,384 have filed claims re-
lated to respiratory issues. According to VA 
data obtained by Military.com, 63% were 
granted. Of all the GWOT veterans, 42,686 
filed for claims related to cancer; 37% of 
those claims were granted. 
The VA’s research shows GWOT veterans 
are three times more likely than non-de-
ployed veterans to file claims related to res-
piratory issues and twice as likely to file 
claims for cancer. 
‘‘Although the GWOT-deployed and GWOT 
non-deployed population sizes are relatively 
the same, the GWOT-deployed cohort has 
more than two times the number of service- 
connected cancers,’’ according to the agen-
cy’s findings. 
Burn pits are often referred to as the post- 
9/11 generation’s Agent Orange, referencing 
the bureaucratic maze and uneven claims 
process veterans have to navigate, and what 
could be a decades-long legislative fight to 
issue easy-to-access health care and dis-
ability compensation. 
The House and Senate Veterans Affairs 
Committees and advocacy groups have made 
toxic exposure the top issue this year. Con-
gress is looking at some two dozen bills, 
ranging from incremental improvements to 
sweeping health care bills for all 3.5 million 
veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic 
environments. 
But it’s unclear what can actually make it 
to President Joe Biden’s desk. Some law-
makers and advocates are concerned over 
what is very likely to be a huge tab to cover 
the cost of opening the VA up to a huge 
swath of new patients. 
[From NBC News, April 12, 2021] 
VETERANS FACE UPHILL BATTLE TO RECEIVE 
TREATMENT FOR ‘BURN PIT’ EXPOSURE 
(By Kenzi Abou-Sabe and Didi Martinez) 
During Marine veteran Scott Evans’ two 
tours in Afghanistan, his work on a special-
ized team that used dogs to sniff out explo-
sives led him to spend large chunks of time 
around open-air pits where trash was burned. 
In August, Evans, 33, of North Carolina, re-
ceived devastating news: he had terminal 
pancreatic cancer. The diagnosis placed him 
among a growing number of military vet-
erans who say they have developed serious 
and sometimes fatal diseases after facing 
prolonged exposure to burn pits at overseas 
bases. 
The pits were a common feature at mili-
tary bases during the wars in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, a crude answer to the basic logis-
tics problem of how to deal with piles and 
piles of trash. Everything from electronics 
and vehicles to human waste was regularly 
doused in jet fuel and set ablaze, spewing 
toxic fumes and carcinogens into the air. 
The Department of Defense estimates that 
roughly 3.5 million service members could 
have been exposed to burn pits. The Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs has denied about 75 
percent of veterans’ burn pit claims, includ-
ing Evans’, because it does not acknowledge 
a connection between conditions like asthma 
and cancer to exposure to the flaming gar-
bage piles. 
Veterans say that at the same time they 
face resistance while seeking treatment from 
the VA, they have also been let down by ci-
vilian medical providers who often lack an 
understanding of the existence and dangers 
of burn pits. 
‘‘Over the next decades, I’d be shocked if 
we didn’t see spikes in disease in these pa-
tients,’’ said Dr. Tom Abrams, an oncologist 
at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who has 
treated two veterans affected by burn pits. 
‘‘Whether it’s cancer, respiratory illness or 
some other disease that has yet to make 
itself known, I think we have to be on the 
lookout and really be aware that these vet-
erans are at very high risk.’’ 
Abrams and other medical experts ac-
knowledge that it’s exceedingly difficult to 
draw a definitive link between burn pits and 
the conditions veterans are reporting, but 
they note that ample evidence already exists 
showing that long-term exposure to toxic 
smoke can lead to serious health issues. 
A VA spokesperson said it ‘‘follows the 
science on questions of health outcomes of 
military exposures’’ and is conducting a re-
view of the hazards of burn pits. 
The spokesperson referenced a 2020 report 
by the National Academies of Sciences, En-
gineering and Medicine that found none of 
the 27 respiratory health outcomes it re-
viewed met the criteria for ‘‘sufficient evi-
dence of an association.’’ The evidence for 
respiratory symptoms such as chronic per-
sistent cough and wheezing met the criteria 
for ‘‘limited or suggestive evidence of an as-
sociation,’’ the spokesperson added. 
A Pentagon spokesperson said the Defense 
Department and VA are ‘‘continuing to fund 
studies to provide more evidence on the po-
tential long-term effects of burn pit expo-
sure.’’ 
Lawmakers in Washington have taken up 
the cause, introducing multiple bills aiming 
to change the way the VA deals with vet-
erans who think they’re suffering from a 
burn pit-related illness. 
On Tuesday, advocates and legislators led 
by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D–N.Y., Sen. 
Marco Rubio, R–Fla., and the comedian Jon 
Stewart will take to Capitol Hill to rally in 
support of a measure, which would force the 
VA to expand care and benefits to veterans 
affected by certain burn pit-related illnesses. 
In an interview with NBC Nightly News’ 
Lester Holt, Stewart said the situation 
echoes the aftermath of the terror attacks of 
Sept. 11, 2001, when first-responders were 
coming down with serious illnesses and 
health officials were slow to recognize them 
as being caused by toxins swirling in the air 
at ground zero. 
‘‘What the first responders were standing 
on top of was essentially a burn pit,’’ he said. 
‘‘The jet fuel from the planes ignited it, but 
it was all those materials from the World 
Trade Center.’’ 
Stewart got involved in the effort after 
being approached by Rosie Torres, the found-
er of the nonprofit Burn Pits 360. Torres 
started advocating for veterans suffering 
from toxic exposure-related illnesses after 
her husband, an Army veteran, was diag-
nosed with constrictive bronchiolitis. 
‘‘I would challenge any congressperson who 
says, ‘Well, we’re going to wait for the 
science to be settled,’ to dig a hundred-yard 
pit in the middle of a town where your con-
stituents live, and burn everything in that 
town with jet fuel,’’ Stewart said. ‘‘And then 
come and tell me that, ‘Yeah, they’re cool 
with it, because there’s a lot of confusion 
about whether or not the science is settled 
that this is harmful to your health.’ ’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1195 
March 1, 2022 
For most veterans who think they are suf-
fering from a burn pit or other toxic expo-
sure-related illness, getting the VA to ac-
knowledge their condition and treat them 
has been a losing battle. Veterans must 
prove to the VA that they were exposed to a 
burn pit during their service, and that the 
exposure caused their condition. 
Further complicating matters, veterans af-
fected by toxic exposure often find them-
selves against the clock when it comes to 
gaining access to health care through the 
VA. If veterans don’t seek treatment during 
an initial five-year period in which the VA 
offers combat veterans free health care—and 
experts say many of the diseases that stem 
from toxic exposure typically manifest slow-
ly—they have to wait for their claim to be 
approved before getting care at a VA facil-
ity. 
Even if they do meet the burden of proof 
and have their claim approved, veterans say 
the approval process can take months to 
years, wasting precious time for those with 
terminal illnesses. 
Gina Cancelino, whose husband, Joseph, 
died of an aggressive form of testicular can-
cer in 2019, said they only learned about the 
possible link between burn pits and the dis-
ease months before he passed away. 
‘‘I said, ‘Hon, burn pits, burn pits in Iraq,’’ 
she recalls telling the former Marine Corps 
gunnery sergeant. ‘‘ ‘Look, I’m reading about 
this. Were you near these?’ And he’s like, 
‘Yeah, I’m pretty sure I was.’ ’’ 
Joseph Cancelino, who worked as a New 
York City Police Department sergeant, had 
deployed to Iraq in 2003 during the first wave 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
Now, his wife has made it her mission to 
piece together his exposure to burn pits. 
‘‘Had we known earlier that this was an 
issue, maybe he goes annually and gets 
checked,’’ Gina Cancelino said. ‘‘Maybe we 
find it earlier, and we don’t give it a chance 
to harbor in there, and fester in there. So 
I’m disappointed. I’m disappointed in the 
lack of communication.’’ 
Gen. Michael Heston was one of the rare 
few whose claims were approved. He served 
three tours in Afghanistan with the Vermont 
Army National Guard, and died in 2018 after 
a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 58 
years old. 
Heston’s wife, June, said she remembers 
her husband questioning the safety of the 
burn pits while he was still deployed. At one 
of the bases where Heston was stationed, she 
said, the burn pit was initially near the air-
field, but the smoke and soot were inter-
fering with the jet engines, so it was moved 
to another area of the base, closer to where 
troops lived and worked. 
‘‘He just couldn’t understand,’’ she said. 
‘‘If it’s doing that to a jet engine, well, why 
would you think it would be OK to be mov-
ing [it] closer to human beings that are 
breathing that in?’’ 
When Heston started complaining of back 
pain and rapidly losing weight in 2016, it 
took doctors 10 months to deliver a diag-
nosis. 
By that time, the cancer had metastasized 
to other parts of his body. 
Abrams, the Dana-Farber oncologist, had 
never heard of burn pits before treating 
Heston. When Heston first explained them, 
Abrams said, he was shocked. 
‘‘I was just horrified because I thought 
that was probably one of the most toxic 
kinds of things you could possibly have,’’ 
Abrams, who is also a faculty member at the 
Harvard Medical School, said. ‘‘It’s ex-
tremely unhealthy to be exposed to the prod-
ucts of massive combustion for years on 
end.’’ 
Abrams ultimately came to the conclusion 
that Heston’s cancer was likely caused by 
his exposure to toxic substances in Afghani-
stan, and wrote a letter spelling that out to 
bolster his application for VA benefits. 
‘‘Most patients are diagnosed [with pan-
creatic cancer] in their mid- to late-60s or 
early 70s,’’ Abrams said. ‘‘He had no risk fac-
tors, he was not a diabetic, he was in excel-
lent shape. And he had this long term, very 
significant toxic exposure that was certainly 
not something that was common at the 
time.’’ 
The VA ultimately acknowledged that 
Heston’s cancer was due to his toxic expo-
sures during service, due in large part, June 
Heston thinks, to Abrams’ letter. But a let-
ter like that is not easy to come by, experts 
say, because doctors are tasked with treat-
ing an illness, not investigating its cause. 
‘‘It’s very difficult to definitively say that 
X causes Y,’’ Abrams said. ‘‘But on some 
level, I think it’s important to at least ac-
knowledge that exposure to high levels of 
toxic smoke is a contributor to lots of dis-
eases in general. And I don’t think you need 
to necessarily pore through the data for 
years to make at least that kind of general 
claim.’’ 
Andrew Myatt deployed to Iraq in 2004 as a 
combat engineer with the Army National 
Guard, disarming improvised explosive de-
vices, or IEDs. He believes the acute 
lymphocytic leukemia he was diagnosed 
with in 2019 is connected to his exposure to 
burn pits in Iraq, but when he applied for 
health care and benefits, the VA denied his 
claim. 
Myatt, 53, said he’d be lost without the 
help of Anita Ritchie, the senior national 
service officer at the nonprofit Wounded 
Warrior Project, who is helping him gather 
evidence for an appeal. 
‘‘Toxic exposure is one of the few instances 
where there’s not a lot of people in the civil-
ian world who know anything about this 
stuff,’’ Ritchie said. 
Myatt said he is happy with his current 
private health care, but getting the VA to 
accept that his cancer was related to his 
service would ensure he has access to med-
ical care in the future. 
‘‘If this [cancer] shows up 20 years from 
now, when I’m retired and living someplace, 
then I can go to them for help,’’ he said. 
In 2014, the VA created a burn pit registry 
to start tracking the long term health ef-
fects for service members who were exposed 
to burn pits and other airborne hazards. 
Since then, nearly 240,000 current and former 
service members have joined. 
But the practice hasn’t stopped. In an 
April 2019 memo to Congress, the Defense De-
partment acknowledged that it had nine ac-
tive burn pits at bases throughout the Mid-
dle East. 
Legislators and advocates are hopeful that 
this will be the year that burn pit reform 
makes its way through Congress in part be-
cause of a unique connection to President 
Joe Biden. 
In the past, Biden has suggested that his 
son Beau’s deployment to Balad Air Base in 
Iraq may have had something to do with his 
brain cancer diagnosis. 
Balad Air Base had one of the largest burn 
pits, spanning more than 10 acres. ‘‘Because 
of exposure to burn pits—in my view, I can’t 
prove it yet—he came back with stage 4 glio-
blastoma,’’ Biden told a Service Employees 
International Union convention in 2019. 
But for veterans like Scott Evans, who 
said he was told he had between six months 
and a year to live, legislation may not come 
soon enough. 
Evans first contacted the VA medical cen-
ter closest to his home last April after his 
weight began to plummet and the whites of 
his eyes had turned yellow. But he said he 
was told he was ineligible because there was 
no evidence his condition was connected to 
his service and he didn’t qualify for financial 
need. 
He was eventually able to start receiving 
care at the VA in July due to a different con-
dition. The following month, he was diag-
nosed with pancreatic cancer at age 32. 
Evans said he tries not to dwell on how 
things may have been different if he had 
been able to access VA care last April. 
‘‘Would [the tumor] have been operable? 
What would the outcome have been of it?’’ he 
said. ‘‘For me, it’s done and over with, we 
can’t change that. But the big thing that I 
would like to see happen is that if somebody 
comes in and they need help, and they’re a 
veteran, be able to get that help right away. 
And let’s ask questions later.’’ 
Still, Evans said he has no regrets over his 
military service. 
‘‘Even knowing what I know now, and 
knowing the consequences, I’d still do ex-
actly the same thing, because it was about 
the guys you’re with,’’ he said, pausing to 
collect himself. ‘‘The thing I’m most proud 
of is everybody who walked behind me has 
all their limbs, and came back safe. And if 
the cost of it was getting cancer, that’s 
fine.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN: Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. And I rise today under-
standing that the greatness of America 
will not be measured by the number of 
nuclear-powered submarines we have. 
Its greatness won’t be measured by our 
B–1 bombers or our number of soldiers 
in uniform. The greatness of our Na-
tion will be measured by how do you 
treat the persons who fly the B–1 
bombers; how do you treat the persons 
who will take on the challenges of the 
world who become the front line of de-
mocracy; how do you treat them when 
they return home? This is how the 
greatness of America will be measured. 
The greatness of America will be 
measured by what kind of housing do 
we give them, do we help them to tran-
sition from military life to a job in ci-
vilian life? The greatness of America 
will be measured by the kind of insur-
ance that they get so that they can 
have the best healthcare the world can 
afford. 
This bill, this legislation, among 
other things, expands healthcare serv-
ices for a larger group of veterans who 
were 
exposed 
to 
toxic 
substances, 
Agent Orange, for example. Many men 
have died and suffered and didn’t get 
the healthcare that they earned be-
cause we allowed a nebulous notion as 
to what Agent Orange was doing to 
them to persist. There is a presumption 
now. 
This bill increases the number of vet-
erans without service-connected dis-
abilities who can receive healthcare. If 
I had my way, you would get all of 
your healthcare whether service-con-
nected or not. But I don’t have my 
way. But I am going to support this 
bill because I want my record to show 
that when I had the chance to help the 
veterans, I did what I could, and I 
voted ‘‘yes.’’ I didn’t cop out. I stood 
tall with them. I want my record to 
show that I came to this floor and en-
couraged my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’

H1196 
March 1, 2022 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I have talked a lot today about the 
Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act, 
which is again, the Senate version. 
That legislation carries the support of 
leading veteran service organizations, 
VSOs, including Disabled American 
Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, 
the Wounded Warrior Project, Iraq and 
Afghanistan Veterans of America, and 
the American Legion, as well as the 
Military Officers Association of Amer-
ica. 
Again, that Senate version passed 
unanimously. We could be running that 
here today and get it on the Presi-
dent’s desk at the end of the week. The 
only thing that stands between getting 
help to veterans right now in terms of 
the burn pit issues is the Democrat 
Party’s refusal to just run the Senate 
version of the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCARTHY), the Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding, but more 
importantly, for his service to our Na-
tion, and when he talks about that bill, 
you think, in Congress, when can you 
find something that is bipartisan? 
Here you have something come out of 
the 
Senate 
that 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats both agree upon. Repub-
licans on this side of the aisle will vote 
for that. The only thing holding it up 
for these veterans are the Democrats. 
They know the bill they are going to 
produce won’t go anywhere, and hope-
fully, we can come back and get this 
done, and it will go to the President’s 
desk. It would have been nice for the 
President to have a bill before he came 
for the State of the Union, so he could 
actually sign something, but unfortu-
nately, politics again gets in the way. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the rule and to support Mrs. MCMORRIS 
RODGERS’ and Mr. WESTERMAN’s legis-
lation. 
The crisis in Ukraine is a crisis of 
American energy security. 
Over the past decade, we have had 
every opportunity to lead. During the 
previous administration, we were en-
ergy independent and an exporter of 
energy for the first time in 50 years. 
Today, however, we have an adminis-
tration that crippled domestic produc-
tion. This administration has increased 
its daily reliance on Russian oil by 34 
percent. 
As every American is glued to their 
television to see what is happening in 
Ukraine, to see the bombing of inno-
cent children and women, there is no 
one American who would want any of 
our money to go to fund that. But in 
this administration, you had actually 
done that, increased the production of 
oil and natural gas coming from Russia 
to America. Meanwhile, it slow-walked 
oil and natural gas exports to our allies 
in Europe. In doing so, it made Europe 
more reliant on Putin. 
Today, 40 percent of natural gas and 
25 percent of crude oil in Europe comes 
from Russian. The Biden administra-
tion has made the free world dependent 
on despots for oil and natural gas from 
Russia. 
We all know that is shameful. 
As an economic and energy super-
power why are we relying on dictators 
when we should be supplying the 
world? 
If you are like me and you are con-
cerned about the environment, do you 
realize that American natural gas is 42 
percent cleaner than Russian natural 
gas? That crude oil could have come 
from Canada and been refined in Amer-
ica if President Biden hadn’t pulled the 
plug on the Keystone Pipeline. But in-
stead, he allowed Putin to have Nord 
Stream 2. 
For those at home that are won-
dering, what is the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line? It is another pipeline built by 
Russia to go in to supply natural gas to 
Europe, but it goes around Ukraine be-
cause the current pipeline goes through 
Ukraine, and Ukraine gets part of the 
money. 
But with this new administration 
and President Biden going to meet 
with Mr. Putin, what did he do? He 
waived the sanctions. But when Presi-
dent Biden watched Putin put hundreds 
of thousands of men along the border of 
Ukraine there was an amendment of-
fered in the Senate to put sanctions on 
Nord Stream 2. People wondered; did it 
pass? It came close, but it failed. 
Do you want to know why it failed? 
Because the Biden administration used 
all their political will to lobby against 
it passing. And more of American mil-
lions of dollars went to fund Putin who 
uses it for his military. 
That natural gas that goes to Europe, 
it could have come from America, from 
our Federal lands and waters where 
President Biden hasn’t approved a sin-
gle new lease—not one; he has actually 
shut them down—and if we had contin-
ued the energy policies of the Trump 
administration, we would actually be 
safer today and Putin would have less 
money to fund his military weaponry. 
Our allies would be safer today, and 
American families would be paying less 
for cleaner energy. In California it is 
more than $5 a gallon, as you know, 
Mr. Speaker. I don’t know if you can 
remember back when when it was 
much less. 
Now, I hear from our colleagues on 
the other side that the reason Amer-
ican resources must stay in the ground 
is climate change. I listened to Mr. 
Kerry be interviewed as Russia invaded 
Ukraine, and he was concerned. This 
former Secretary of State, now helping 
in this administration, I thought he 
would be concerned about the men and 
women in Ukraine. He was concerned 
with; would Putin still work with cli-
mate change? I think you should tell 
that to the Ukrainian people. I don’t 
think one of them is concerned about 
that right now. 
Now, I hear our colleagues when they 
talk about climate change, but if they 
really studied it, the truth is what I 
told you before, American natural gas 
is 42 percent cleaner than Russian nat-
ural gas. And we can guarantee you 
this, we are not invading Ukraine. We 
won’t use the resources to carpet- 
bomb, to shoot innocent women and 
children. 
If you are concerned about the envi-
ronment, like I am, you should support 
this bill. You could, Mr. Speaker. It 
immediately approves the Keystone 
Pipeline because we have waited long 
enough and can’t afford to wait a 
minute longer. It removes all restric-
tion on liquid natural gas exports so we 
could become an arsenal of energy for 
the free world. And it restarts the 
leases on Federal lands and waters 
which are being held up by the Biden 
administration. 
b 1330 
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting. You 
have the majority here on the floor. 
You have the Biden administration. It 
is in the power of your party. But those 
six permits that sit at the desk of the 
Secretary of Energy that could take 
money away from Putin, provide Amer-
ican jobs, and provide Europe with 
cleaner natural gas from America still 
sit there to this day because somehow 
you think it is better for climate 
change. 
Mr. Speaker, a vote for this bill is a 
vote to produce more energy for our al-
lies. It means American jobs. It means 
our allies don’t have to deal with 
Putin, be held hostage to him. It means 
Putin will not have millions of dollars 
from Americans to buy the weaponry 
that he uses to kill innocent people in 
Ukraine. 
A vote for this bill is a vote to pro-
vide relief for working families at the 
pump. It means Americans won’t have 
to pay the high prices they are today. 
I know at the White House, when 
they were asked this question, they 
said it is okay that the price is high be-
cause that way somehow it helps them 
with climate change if they could get 
more renewable energy. 
Mr. Speaker, that is a tax on all 
Americans, especially low-income. But 
I don’t know, in this administration, 
they have the highest inflation we have 
had in 40 years. Somehow, they must 
think that is positive, too. 
Mr. Speaker, in this new administra-
tion, when you have crime, we have a 
border that is not secure. People are 
coming across the border that are on 
the terrorist watch list. We now have 
more fentanyl in America today than 
at any time, enough to kill every sin-
gle American seven times over. 
Mr. Speaker, I know you would care 
about this because you know, today, 
the number one cause of death of those 
between the ages of 18 to 45 is fentanyl. 
You know where it comes from, the 
chemicals of China, across the border 
of Mexico that no longer is attended to. 
Mr. Speaker, I know the President of 
your party has put the Vice President 
in charge, and she has been there one 
time—one time. Every city in America 
has become a border city today every 
single weekend.

Mr. Speaker, you know this based 
upon your background. You see the 
deaths that are happening. It is un-
wanted. It is unneeded. And we could 
do better. 
Mr. Speaker, a vote for this bill is a 
vote to deprive Putin of a major rev-
enue stream. 
It is not difficult. There won’t be any 
pressure. All Members have to do is 
walk onto the floor, take the card out 
of their pocket, put it in the little box. 
And if you are somebody that because 
you are afraid of COVID, you are still 
home, or you are on a boat, you could 
still vote by proxy with this majority. 
What you could do is you could vote 
for this bill. You could vote to make 
America 
energy 
independent. 
You 
could lower the gas prices. You could 
take the money out of Putin’s hands 
that he uses to kill innocent people. 
Everybody in the world is watching. 
Mr. Speaker, the sad part, I bet if this 
bill was on the floor in any country in 
Europe, it would be 100 percent voted 
for. I will be watching. I think America 
will be watching. 
Would we stand for America and for 
freedom? Would we stand for President 
Zelensky, who didn’t take the advice of 
President Biden and leave his country, 
who doesn’t ask for men and women 
from America to come to fight? He just 
asks to provide some weapons so they 
can defend against Putin. 
Mr. Speaker, the sad part about that 
is every day that we allow crude or 
natural gas to come from Russia, 
American money is going to Putin. 
Let’s stop that and stop that today. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the 
world is watching. And I am not going 
to be lectured by someone who takes 
their marching orders from Donald 
Trump, who said that Putin’s invasion 
of Ukraine was a genius and savvy 
move. I wish the gentleman would have 
condemned that. 
Listening to that speech, you would 
think that Joe Biden invaded Ukraine. 
I mean, he spent all this time criti-
cizing Joe Biden, John Kerry, and ev-
erybody else but hardly criticized 
Vladimir Putin. 
You know, look, I also wish, because 
I think it would be helpful for this 
country and a signal to the world, if 
the gentleman who just spoke would 
reprimand Members of his own party 
who cozy up to white nationalists and 
go to pro-Putin rallies. That would 
send a signal to people in this country 
and to people around the world on 
whose side we are on. 
Bottom line is, the people of Ukraine 
are being invaded by a brutal dictator, 
Vladimir Putin. And when their stand-
ard-bearer, 
Donald Trump, was in 
charge, he spread propaganda about 
Ukrainian interference in the 2016 elec-
tion, which was a lie. He ousted a well- 
regarded U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine 
because they weren’t doing what he 
wanted to in terms of finding dirt on 
his political opponents. He froze mili-
tary assistance to Ukraine; they said 
nothing. He withheld a White House 
meeting with Zelensky, turned Ukraine 
policy over to Giuliani—I could go on 
and on and on. 
We are not going to be lectured by 
them. Instead, we are going to move 
forward and pass a bill to help Amer-
ica’s veterans, with or without them. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, so just a quick history lesson. The 
Obama-Biden 
administration 
sent 
Ukraine blankets and well-wishes. The 
Trump administration sent Javelin 
missiles. That is the big difference. 
You know, I have said numerous 
times standing up here that the Demo-
cratic Party is a party of political 
science. I could be even more generous. 
The Democratic Party is also a party 
of false choices and false narratives. 
The Democrats have presented us with 
a false choice when it comes to U.S. en-
ergy and also a false narrative. 
Let me be clear: We can unleash do-
mestic energy and be good stewards of 
the environment. Thanks to American 
energy innovation, thanks to the en-
ergy sector, the U.S., at least under 
President Trump, was actually reduc-
ing carbon emissions. In Pennsylvania, 
for example, thanks to natural gas, our 
energy sector has reduced emissions by 
41 percent since 2005. 
Again, it is an absolutely false 
choice. It is a false narrative that we 
cannot unleash the American energy 
sector and be good stewards of the en-
vironment. In fact, quite the opposite. 
We actually are good stewards of the 
environment when we are using clean 
natural gas, particularly from Pennsyl-
vania. 
But here to talk more about that 
issue is my good friend, the ranking 
member of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and one of the authors 
of the American Energy Independence 
from Russia Act, CATHY
MCMORRIS 
RODGERS. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
RODGERS). 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to urge imme-
diate consideration of the American 
Energy Independence from Russia Act. 
Innocent blood is being spilled in 
Ukraine as we speak. Women and chil-
dren are being separated from their fa-
thers. Democracy is under attack. 
Freedom must prevail. What do the 
people in Ukraine want? They want 
self-determination and independence 
from Russia. 
Mr. Speaker, Russia’s economy is en-
tirely dependent upon energy produc-
tion and exports. Putin uses energy 
and pipelines as weapons, threatening 
to cut off supplies or hike prices when 
the West confronts Russia’s aggression. 
Russia’s energy exports fund its mili-
tary and its current attack on Ukraine. 
America, not Russia, is the world’s 
number 
one 
energy 
producer. 
We 
should act like it and lead. 
President Biden must restore Amer-
ican energy dominance and use energy 
resources to help Ukraine and Europe 
fight back. We shouldn’t be buying a 
single barrel of oil from Russia, and 
our allies shouldn’t be beholden to ag-
gressors that attack their freedom. Eu-
rope should have the choice to buy 
American energy and say no to Russian 
pipelines and Nord Stream 2. 
That is why Congressman BRUCE 
WESTERMAN and I are leading on the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act. This bill flips the switch on 
American energy. We need more pipe-
lines, including Keystone XL, so this 
bill immediately approves the Key-
stone XL pipeline so that we can im-
port crude oil from Canada, not Russia. 
It also removes all restrictions on 
U.S. energy exports to deliver natural 
gas to our allies in Europe, and it re-
starts oil and gas leasing on our Fed-
eral lands and offshore waters. 
This is how we shut down Putin’s war 
chest, stand by Ukraine, empower our 
allies, protect our national security, 
and create jobs here at home. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
say ‘‘no’’ on this previous question and 
‘‘yes’’ on the American Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I have no further speakers at this 
time, and I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I am an Iraq war vet-
eran. I was in Baghdad for 6 months in 
2009. I can tell you that I am com-
mitted to ensuring the men and women 
who served our Nation receive the care 
and benefits they deserve. It is of ut-
most importance to me as a Member of 
this body and as an Iraq war veteran. 
That is the reason why I am so dis-
appointed in my friends across the 
aisle. I am disappointed that instead of 
considering the Senate-passed Health 
Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act—which, 
again, could immediately be sent to 
the President’s desk—House Democrats 
are prioritizing legislation that is still 
a long way away from enactment and 
will delay benefits for toxic-exposed 
veterans. 
Let me be clear. We can get help to 
veterans. We can get this bill to the 
desk of the President by the end of this 
week. The only thing standing in the 
way are my friends on the other side of 
the aisle. 
It is for that reason I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I 
want to thank and acknowledge Jeff 
Gohringer, who has served as the com-
munications director for the House 
Committee on Rules in both the major-
ity and minority over the last 6 years. 
Today is his last day with the Com-
mittee on Rules, and I speak for Mem-
bers and staff on both sides of the aisle 
when I say to Jeff that we are grateful

for your years of service in this institu-
tion. We wish you well in your future 
endeavors, and you will always have a 
home here. 
I also thank James Fitzella, who is 
leaving as well. The staff are incredible 
on the Committee on Rules, and James 
will be dearly missed. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just close by say-
ing that we heard a lot on the other 
side and barely a mention about our 
veterans. The gentlewoman from Wash-
ington, who came on the floor just re-
cently and read the oil company talk-
ing points, couldn’t even bring herself 
to mention veterans once. 
The bill that we are talking about 
here today is to make sure veterans 
who have been exposed to toxic chemi-
cals, who get cancer, who get other ail-
ments, get the healthcare they need. 
You would like to think that we 
could all come together on it. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania keeps on 
talking about this narrow bill. I mean, 
they are not even serious about it be-
cause if they were, they would have 
used the previous question vote, which 
would give them the right to control 
the floor, to bring that up. But they 
didn’t. Instead, they are bringing up an 
oil company’s wish list. 
This really is obnoxious. I get it. 
They don’t like President Biden, and 
they will let no crisis go by without 
trying to make it about President 
Biden. 
But let me just say this: We should 
be together in standing with the people 
of Ukraine, and we should be together 
in standing with our veterans. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 950 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
6858) to strengthen United States energy se-
curity, encourage domestic production of 
crude oil, petroleum products, and natural 
gas, and for other purposes. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
any amendment thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6858. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

(Applause, the Members rising.) 
The SPEAKER. Members of Con-
gress, I have the high privilege and the

President of the United States. 
(Applause, the Members rising.) 
The PRESIDENT. Madam Speaker, 
Madam Vice President, our First Lady 
and Second Gentleman, Members of 
Congress and the Cabinet, Justices of 
the Supreme Court, my fellow Ameri-
cans, last year, COVID–19 kept us 
apart. This year, we are finally to-
gether again. 
Tonight, we meet as Democrats, Re-
publicans, and Independents but, most 
importantly, as Americans with a duty 
to one another, to America, to the 
American people, and to the Constitu-
tion, and with an unwavering resolve 
that freedom will always triumph over 
tyranny. 
Six 
days 
ago, 
Russia’s 
Vladimir 
Putin sought to shake the very founda-
tions of the free world, thinking he 
could make it bend to his menacing 
ways. But he badly miscalculated. 
He 
thought 
he 
could 
roll 
into 
Ukraine and the world would roll over. 
Instead, he met with a wall of strength 
he never anticipated or imagined. He 
met the Ukrainian people. 
From President Zelensky to every 
Ukrainian, 
their 
fearlessness, 
their 
courage, their determination literally 
inspires the world—groups of citizens 
blocking tanks with their bodies, ev-
eryone from students, to retirees, to 
teachers 
turned 
soldiers 
defending 
their homeland. 
And 
in 
this 
struggle, 
President 
Zelensky said in his speech to the Eu-
ropean Parliament: ‘‘Light will win 
over darkness.’’ 
The Ukrainian Ambassador to the 
United States is here tonight, sitting 
with the First Lady. Let’s each of us, if 
you are able to stand, stand and send 
an unmistakable signal to the world 
and to Ukraine. 
She is bright, she is strong, and she is 
resolved. 
Yes, we, the United States of Amer-
ica, stand with the Ukrainian people. 
Throughout our history, we have 
learned this lesson: When dictators do 
not pay a price for their aggression, 
they cause more chaos. They keep 
moving. And the cost and the threats 
to America and to the world keep ris-
ing. That is why the NATO alliance 
was created, to secure peace and sta-
bility in Europe after World War II. 
The United States is a member, along 
with 29 other nations. It matters. 
American diplomacy matters. Amer-
ican resolve matters. 
Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was 
premeditated and totally unprovoked. 
He rejected repeated efforts at diplo-
macy. He thought the West and NATO 
wouldn’t respond. He thought he could 
divide us at home, in this Chamber and 
this Nation. He thought he could divide 
us in Europe as well. 
But Putin was wrong. We are ready. 
We are united. And that is what we did. 
We stayed united. We prepared exten-
sively and carefully. We spent months 
building coalitions of other freedom- 
loving nations in Europe and the Amer-
icas, to the Asia and the African con-
tinents, to confront Putin. 
Like many of you, I spent countless 
hours unifying our European allies. We 
shared with the world in advance what 
we knew Putin was planning and pre-
cisely how he would try to falsify and 
justify his aggression. 
We countered Russia’s lies with the 
truth. And now that he has acted, the 
free world is holding him accountable, 
along with 27 members of the European 
Union, including France, Germany,

March 1, 2022 
Italy, as well as countries like the 
United 
Kingdom, 
Canada, 
Japan, 
Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and 
many others, even Switzerland, that 
are inflicting pain on Russia and sup-
porting the people of Ukraine. Putin is 
now isolated from the world more than 
he has ever been. 
Together, along with our allies, we 
are right now enforcing powerful eco-
nomic sanctions. We are cutting off 
Russia’s largest bank from the inter-
national financial system, preventing 
Russia’s central bank from defending 
the Russian ruble, making Putin’s $630 
billion war fund worthless. 
We are choking Russia’s access to 
technology that will sap its economic 
strength and weaken its military for 
years to come. 
Tonight, 
I 
say 
to 
the 
Russian 
oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who 
have bilked billions of dollars off this 
violent regime, no more. I mean it. 
The United States Department of 
Justice is assembling a dedicated task 
force to go after the crimes of the Rus-
sian oligarchs. We are joining with Eu-
ropean allies to find and seize their 
yachts, their luxury apartments, their 
private jets. We are coming for your 
ill-begotten gains. 
And tonight, I am announcing that 
we will join our allies in closing off 
American 
airspace 
to 
all 
Russian 
flights, further isolating Russia and 
adding an additional squeeze on their 
economy. 
He has no idea what is coming. 
The ruble has already lost 30 percent 
of its value. The Russian stock market 
has lost 40 percent of its value, and 
trading remains suspended. The Rus-
sian economy is reeling, and Putin 
alone is the one to blame. 
Together with our allies, we are pro-
viding support to the Ukrainians in 
their fight for freedom—military as-
sistance, economic assistance, humani-
tarian assistance. 
We are giving more than a billion 
dollars of direct assistance to Ukraine, 
and we will continue to aid the Ukrain-
ian people as they defend their country 
and help ease their suffering. 
But let me be clear. Our forces are 
not engaged and will not engage in the 
conflict 
with 
Russian 
forces 
in 
Ukraine. Our forces are not going to 
Europe to fight Ukraine but to defend 
our NATO allies in the event that 
Putin decides to keep moving west. 
For that purpose, we have mobilized 
American ground forces, air squadrons, 
ship deployments to protect NATO 
countries, including Poland, Romania, 
Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. 
And as I have made crystal clear, the 
United States and our allies will defend 
every inch of territory that is NATO 
territory with the full force of our col-
lective power—every single inch. 
And we are clear-eyed. The Ukrain-
ians are fighting back with pure cour-
age. But the next few days, weeks, and 
months will be hard on them. 
Putin has unleashed violence and 
chaos. But while he may make gains on 
the battlefield, he will pay a con-
tinuing high price over the long run. 
And the Ukrainian people, the proud, 
proud people, pound for pound are 
ready to fight with every inch of en-
ergy they have. They have known 30 
years of independence, have repeatedly 
shown that they will not tolerate any-
one who tries to take their country 
backward. 
To all Americans, I will be honest 
with you, as I always promised I would 
be. A Russian dictator invading a for-
eign country has costs around the 
world. And I am taking robust action 
to make sure the pain of our sanctions 
is targeted at Russia’s economy and 
that we use every tool at our disposal 
to protect American businesses and 
consumers. 
Tonight, I can announce the United 
States has worked with 30 other coun-
tries to release 60 million barrels of oil 
from reserves around the world. Amer-
ica will lead that effort, releasing 30 
million barrels of our own Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. And we stand 
ready to do more if necessary, united 
with our allies. 
These steps will help blunt gas prices 
here at home, but I know news about 
what is happening can seem alarming 
to all Americans. But I want you to 
know we are going to be okay. We are 
going to be okay. 
When the history of this era is writ-
ten, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have 
left Russia weaker and the rest of the 
world stronger. 
While it shouldn’t have taken some-
thing so terrible for people around the 
world to see what is at stake, now ev-
eryone sees it clearly. 
We see the unity among leaders of 
nations, a more unified Europe, a more 
unified West. We see unity among the 
people who are gathering in cities in 
large crowds around the world, even in 
Russia, to demonstrate their support 
for the people of Ukraine. 
In the battle between democracy and 
autocracy, democracies are rising to 
the moment, and the world is clearly 
choosing the side of peace and security. 
This is the real test, and it is going 
to take time. So let us continue to 
draw inspiration from the iron will of 
the Ukrainian people. 
To our fellow Ukrainian Americans 
who forge a deep bond that connects 
our two nations, we stand with you. We 
stand with you. 
Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, 
but he will never gain the hearts and 
souls of the Ukrainian people. He will 
never extinguish their love of freedom, 
and he will never, ever weaken the re-
solve of the free world. 
We meet tonight in an America that 
has lived through two of the hardest 
years this Nation has ever faced. The 
pandemic has been punishing, and so 
many families are living paycheck to 
paycheck, struggling to keep up with 
the rising cost of food, gas, housing, 
and so much more. 
I understand, like many of you do. 
My dad had to leave his home in Scran-
ton, Pennsylvania, to find work. So 
like many of you, I grew up in a family 
where if the price of food went up, it 
was felt throughout the family. It had 
an impact. 
That is why one of the first things I 
did as President was to fight to pass 
the American Rescue Plan, because 
people were hurting. We needed to act, 
and we did. Few pieces of legislation 
have done more at a critical moment 
in our history to lift us out of a crisis. 
It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the 
Nation and combat COVID–19. It deliv-
ered immediate economic relief to tens 
of millions of Americans. It helped put 
food on the table. Remember those 
long lines of cars waiting for hours just 
to get a box of food put in their trunk? 
It cut the cost of healthcare insurance. 
As my dad used to say, it gave the peo-
ple just a little bit of breathing room. 
Unlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed 
in the previous administration that 
benefited the top 1 percent of Ameri-
cans, the American Rescue Plan helped 
working people and left no one behind. 
And it worked. It worked. It created 
jobs, lots of jobs. In fact, our economy 
created over 6.5 million new jobs just 
last year, more jobs in 1 year than ever 
before in the history of the United 
States of America. 
The economy grew at a rate of 5.7 
percent last year, the strongest growth 
rate in 40 years, and the first step in 
bringing fundamental change to our 
economy that hasn’t worked for the 
working people in this Nation for too 
long. 
For the past 40 years, we were told 
that if we gave tax breaks to those at 
the very top the benefits would trickle 
down and everyone would benefit. But 
that trickle-down theory led to weaker 
economic growth, lower wages, bigger 
deficits, and a widening gap between 
the top and everyone else in nearly a 
century. 
Look, Vice President Harris and I ran 
for office—and I realize we have funda-
mental disagreements on this—but we 
ran for office with a new economic vi-
sion for America. Invest in America. 
Educate Americans. Grow the work-
force. Build the economy from the bot-
tom up and the middle out, not from 
the top down. Because we know when 
the middle class grows, the poor have a 
ladder up and the wealthy do very well. 
America used to have the best roads, 
bridges, and airports on Earth. Now, 
our infrastructure is ranked thirteenth 
in the world. We won’t be able to com-
pete for the jobs of the 21st century if 
we don’t fix it. That is why it was so 
important to pass the bipartisan infra-
structure law, and I thank my Repub-
lican friends who joined to invest to re-
build America, the single biggest in-
vestment in history. It was a bipar-
tisan effort, and I want to thank the 
members of both parties who worked to 
make it happen. 
We are done talking about infrastruc-
ture weeks. We are now talking about 
an infrastructure decade.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1202 
March 1, 2022 
Look, it is going to transform Amer-
ica and put us on a path to win the eco-
nomic competition of the 21st century 
that we face with the rest of the world, 
particularly China. 
I have told Xi Jinping it has never 
been a good bet to bet against the 
American people. We will create good 
jobs for millions of Americans, mod-
ernizing roads, airports, ports, and wa-
terways all across America, and we will 
do it to withstand the devastating ef-
fects of climate change and promoting 
environmental justice. 
We will build a national network of 
500,000 electric vehicle charging sta-
tions, begin to replace the poisonous 
lead pipes so every child, every Amer-
ican has clean water to drink at home 
and at school. We are going to provide 
affordable 
high-speed 
internet 
for 
every 
American—rural, 
suburban, 
urban, and Tribal communities. 
Four thousand projects have already 
been announced. Many of you have an-
nounced them in your districts. To-
night, I am announcing that this year, 
we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of 
highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. 
Folks, when we use taxpayer dollars 
to rebuild America, we are going to do 
it by buying American. Buy American 
products, support Americans jobs. 
The 
Federal 
Government 
spends 
about $600 billion a year to keep this 
country safe and secure. There has 
been a law on the books for almost a 
century to make sure taxpayers’ dol-
lars support American jobs and busi-
nesses. Every administration, Demo-
crat or Republican, says they will do 
it, but we are actually doing it. We will 
buy American to make sure everything 
from the deck of an aircraft carrier to 
the steel on highway guardrails is 
made in America from beginning to 
end, all of it. 
But, folks, to compete for the jobs of 
the future, we also need a level playing 
field with China and other competitors. 
That is why it is so important to pass 
the bipartisan Innovation Act sitting 
in Congress that will make record in-
vestments in emerging technologies 
and American manufacturing. 
We used to invest almost 2 percent of 
our GDP in research and development. 
We don’t now, can’t. China is. 
Let me give you one example of why 
it is so important to pass. If you travel 
20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you 
will find 1,000 empty acres of land. It 
won’t look like much, but if you stop 
and look closely, you will see a field of 
dreams, the ground on which America’s 
future will be built. 
That is where Intel, the American 
company that helped build Silicon Val-
ley, is going to build a $20 billion semi-
conductor mega site, up to eight state- 
of-the-art factories in one place, 10,000 
new jobs. In those factories, the aver-
age job is about $135,000 a year, some of 
the most sophisticated manufacturing 
in the world, to make computer chips 
the size of a fingertip that power the 
world and our everyday lives, from 
smartphones, technology of the inter-
net, technology that is yet to be in-
vented. But that is just the beginning. 
Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is 
here tonight—I don’t know where Pat 
is. 
There you go. Pat, stand up. 
Pat came to see me, and he told me 
they are ready to increase their invest-
ment from $20 billion to $100 billion. 
That would be the biggest investment 
in manufacturing in American history. 
All they are waiting for is for you to 
pass this bill. So let’s not wait any 
longer. Send it to my desk, I will sign 
it, and we will really take off in a big 
way. 
Folks, Intel is not alone. There is 
something happening in America. Just 
look around, and you will see an amaz-
ing story, the rebirth of pride that 
comes from stamping products ‘‘made 
in America,’’ the revitalization of 
American manufacturing. Companies 
are choosing to build new factories 
here, when just a few years ago, they 
would have gone overseas. 
That is what is happening. Ford is in-
vesting $11 billion in electric vehicles, 
creating 11,000 jobs across the country. 
GM is making the largest investment 
in its history, $7 billion to build elec-
tric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in 
Michigan. All told, 369,000 new manu-
facturing jobs were created in America 
last year alone. 
Powered by people I have met like 
JoJo Burgess, from generations of 
union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, 
who is here with us tonight. Where are 
you, JoJo? There you go. Thanks, 
Buddy. 
As Ohio Senator SHERROD
BROWN 
says, ‘‘It is time to bury the label ‘Rust 
Belt.’ ’’ It is time to see what used to 
be called the Rust Belt become the 
home of a significant resurgence of 
manufacturing. 
With all the bright spots in our econ-
omy, record job growth and higher 
wages, too many families are strug-
gling to keep up with their bills. Infla-
tion is robbing them of the gains they 
might otherwise feel. I get it. That is 
why my top priority is getting prices 
under control. 
Look, our economy roared back fast-
er than almost anyone predicted, but 
the pandemic meant that businesses 
had a hard time hiring enough people 
because of the pandemic to keep up 
production in their factories. So you 
didn’t have people making those beams 
that went into buildings because they 
were out, the factory was closed. 
The pandemic also disrupted the 
global supply chain. When factories 
close, it takes longer to make goods 
and get them from the warehouses to 
the stores, and prices go up. Look at 
cars last year. One-third of all the in-
flation was because of automobile 
sales. There weren’t enough semi-
conductors to make all the cars that 
people wanted to buy. And guess what? 
Prices of automobiles went way up. Es-
pecially used vehicles as well. 
And so we have a choice. One way to 
fight inflation is to drive down wages 
and make Americans poorer. I think I 
have a better idea to fight inflation. 
Lower your costs, not your wages. 
Folks, that means make more cars 
and semiconductors in America. 
More infrastructure and innovation 
in America. 
More goods moving faster and cheap-
er in America. 
More jobs where you can earn a good 
living in America. 
Instead of relying on foreign supply 
chains, let’s Make It In America. 
Look, economists call this increasing 
the productive capacity of our econ-
omy. I call it building a better Amer-
ica. 
My plan to fight inflation will lower 
your costs and lower the deficit. Seven-
teen Nobel laureates in economics say 
my plan will ease long-term infla-
tionary pressures. Top business lead-
ers, and I believe most Americans, sup-
port the plan. 
And here is the plan: First, cut the 
cost of prescription drugs. We pay more 
for the same drug produced by the 
same company in America than any 
other country in the world. 
Just look at insulin. One in ten 
Americans has diabetes. In Virginia I 
met a 13-year-old boy, the handsome 
young man standing up there, Joshua 
Davis. He and his dad both have type 1 
diabetes, which means they need insu-
lin every single day. Insulin costs 
about $10 a vial to make. That is what 
it costs the pharmaceutical company. 
But drug companies charge families 
like Joshua and his dad up to 30 times 
that amount. 
I spoke with Joshua’s mom. Imagine 
what it is like to look at your child 
who needs insulin to stay healthy and 
have no idea how in God’s name you 
are going to be able to pay for it. What 
it does to your family, but what it does 
to your dignity, your ability to look 
your child in the eye, to be the parent 
you expect yourself to be. I really 
mean it. Think about that. That is 
what I think about. 
Joshua is here tonight, but yesterday 
was his birthday. Happy birthday, 
Buddy, by the way. For Joshua, and for 
the 200,000 other young people with 
type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of in-
sulin at $35 a month so everyone can 
afford it. 
And drug companies will do, very, 
very well, their profit margin. And 
while we are at it, I know we have had 
great disagreements on this floor with 
this, let’s let Medicare negotiate the 
price of prescription drugs. They al-
ready set the price for VA drugs. 
Look, the American Rescue Plan is 
helping millions of families on Afford-
able Care Act plans to save them $2,400 
a year on their healthcare premiums. 
Let’s close the coverage gap and make 
these savings permanent. 
Second, let’s cut energy costs for 
families an average of $500 a year by 
combating climate change. 
Let’s provide investments and tax 
credits to weatherize your homes and 
businesses to be energy efficient, and

you get a tax credit for it. Double 
America’s clean energy production in 
solar, wind, and so much more. Lower 
the price of electric vehicles, saving 
another $80 a month that you are not 
going to have to pay at the pump. 
The third thing we can do to change 
the standard of living for hardworking 
folks is cut the cost of childcare. If you 
live in a major city in America, you 
pay up to $14,000 a year for childcare 
per child. I was a single dad for 5 years, 
raising two kids. I had a lot of help, 
though. I had a mom, a dad, a brother, 
and a sister that really helped. But 
middle-class 
and 
working 
folks 
shouldn’t have to pay more than 7 per-
cent of their income to care for their 
young children. 
My plan would cut the cost of 
childcare in half for most families and 
help parents, including millions of 
women who left the workforce during 
the pandemic because they couldn’t af-
ford childcare, to be able to get back to 
work, generating economic growth. 
My plan doesn’t stop there. It also in-
cludes home- and long-term care. More 
affordable housing. Pre-K for 3- and 4- 
year-olds. All of these will lower costs 
for families. 
Under my plan nobody—let me say 
this again—nobody earning less than 
$400,000 a year will pay an additional 
penny in new taxes. Not a single penny. 
I may be wrong, but my guess is if we 
took a secret ballot on this floor that 
we would all agree that the present tax 
system ain’t fair. We have to fix it. 
I am not looking to punish anybody, 
but 
let’s 
make 
corporations 
and 
wealthy Americans start paying their 
fair share. Last year, like CHRIS COONS 
and TOM CARPER and my distinguished 
Congresswoman, we come from the 
land of corporate America. There are 
more 
corporations 
incorporated 
in 
Delaware than every other State in 
America combined, and I still won 36 
years in a row. The point is, even they 
understand that they should pay their 
fair share. 
Last year 55 of the Fortune 500 com-
panies earned $40 billion in profit and 
paid zero in Federal taxes. Look, it is 
not fair. That is why I proposed a 15 
percent minimum tax rate for corpora-
tions. 
We got more than 130 countries to 
agree on a global minimum tax rate, so 
companies can’t get out of paying their 
taxes at home by shipping jobs and fac-
tories overseas. That will raise billions 
of dollars. 
That is why I propose closing loop-
holes for the very wealthy who pay a 
lower tax rate than a teacher and a 
firefighter. 
So that is my plan, but we have to go 
into more detail later. We will grow 
the economy, lower the costs to fami-
lies. 
So what are we waiting for? Let’s get 
this done. We all know we have to 
make changes. 
Folks, while you are at it, confirm 
my nominees for the Federal Reserve, 
which plays a critical role in fighting 
inflation. 
My plan will not only lower costs and 
give families a fair shot, it will lower 
the deficit. 
The previous administration not only 
ballooned the deficit with those tax 
cuts for the very wealthy and corpora-
tions, it undermined the watchdogs, 
the job of those to keep the pandemic 
relief funds from being wasted. 
Remember, we had those debates 
about whether or not those watchdogs 
should be able to see every day how 
much money was being spent, and was 
it going to the right place? Under my 
administration, 
the 
watchdogs 
are 
back. 
And we are going to go after the 
criminals who stole billions of relief 
money meant for small businesses and 
millions of Americans. And, tonight, I 
am announcing that the Justice De-
partment will soon name a chief pros-
ecutor for pandemic fraud. 
Look, I think we all agree—thank 
you—by the end of this year, the def-
icit will be down to less than half of 
what it was before I took office, the 
only President ever to cut the deficit 
by more than $1 trillion in a single 
year. 
Lowering your costs also means de-
manding more competition. I am a cap-
italist, but capitalism without com-
petition is not capitalism. Capitalism 
without competition is exploitation. 
It drives up prices. When corpora-
tions don’t have to compete, their prof-
its go up. Your prices go up when they 
don’t have to compete. Small busi-
nesses and family farmers and ranchers 
go under. I need not tell some of my 
Republican friends from those States. 
Guess what? You have four basic 
meatpacking facilities. That is it. You 
play with them or you don’t get to play 
at all, and you pay a hell of a lot more, 
a hell of a lot more, because there are 
only four. 
We see what is happening with ocean 
carriers moving goods in and out of 
America. During the pandemic, about 
half a dozen or less foreign-owned com-
panies raised prices by as much as 1,000 
percent and made record profits. To-
night, I am announcing a crackdown on 
those companies overcharging Amer-
ican businesses and consumers. 
Folks, as Wall Street firms take over 
more nursing homes, quality in those 
homes has gone down, and costs have 
gone up. That ends on my watch. 
Medicare is going to set higher stand-
ards for nursing homes and make sure 
your loved ones get the care they de-
serve and that they expect, and they 
are looked at closely. 
We are also going to cut costs to 
keep the economy going strong and 
give workers a fair shot, provide more 
training 
and 
apprenticeships, 
hire 
them based on skills, not just their de-
grees. 
Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act 
and paid leave, raise the minimum 
wage to $15 an hour, and extend the 
child tax credit so no one has to raise 
a family in poverty. 
Let’s increase Pell grants and in-
crease our historic support of HBCUs 
and invest in what Jill, our First Lady 
who teaches full time, calls America’s 
best-kept secret, community colleges. 
Look, let’s pass the PRO Act. When a 
majority of workers want to form a 
union, they shouldn’t be able to be 
stopped. 
When we invest in our workers, when 
we build an economy from the bottom 
up and the middle out together, we can 
do something we haven’t done in a long 
time: build a better America. 
For more than 2 years, COVID has 
impacted every decision in our lives 
and the life of this Nation. And I know 
you are tired, frustrated, and ex-
hausted. And that doesn’t even count 
close to a million people who sit at a 
dining room table or a kitchen table 
and look at an empty chair because 
they lost somebody. 
But I also know this: Because of the 
progress we have made, because of your 
resilience and the tools that we have 
been provided by this Congress, tonight 
I can say we are moving forward safely, 
back to more normal routines. 
We have reached a new moment in 
the fight against COVID–19, where se-
vere cases are down to a level not seen 
since July of last year. Just a few days 
ago, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention issued new mask guide-
lines. 
Under 
the 
new 
guidelines, 
most 
Americans and most of the country can 
now go mask free. And based on projec-
tions, more of the country will reach 
that point across the next couple of 
weeks. 
Thanks to the progress we have made 
in the past year, COVID–19 no longer 
need control our lives. I know some are 
talking about living with COVID–19, 
but tonight, I say that we never will 
just accept living with COVID–19. We 
will continue to combat the virus as we 
do other diseases. And because this 
virus mutates and spreads, we have to 
stay on guard. 
Here are four commonsense steps as 
we move forward safely, in my view. 
First, stay protected with vaccines 
and treatments. We know how incred-
ibly effective vaccines are. If you are 
vaccinated and boosted, you have the 
highest degree of protection. We will 
never give up on vaccinating more 
Americans. 
Now, I know parents with kids under 
5 are eager to see vaccines authorized 
for their children. Scientists are work-
ing hard to get that done, and we will 
be ready with plenty of vaccines if and 
when they do. 
We are also ready with antiviral 
treatments. If you get COVID–19, the 
Pfizer pill reduces your chances of end-
ing up in a hospital by 90 percent. 
I have ordered more pills than any-
one in the world has. Pfizer is working 
overtime to get us a million pills this 
month and more than double that next 
month. 
And now we are launching the Test 
to Treat initiative so people can get 
tested at a pharmacy and, if they prove 
positive, receive the antiviral pills on 
the spot at no cost.

Folks, 
if 
you 
are 
immunocompromised or have some 
other vulnerability, we have treat-
ments and free high-quality masks. We 
are leaving no one behind or ignoring 
anyone’s needs as we move forward. 
On testing, we have made hundreds of 
millions of tests available, and you can 
order them for free to your doorstep. 
And we have already ordered free tests. 
If you already ordered free tests, to-
night, I am announcing you can order 
another 
group 
of 
tests. 
Go 
to 
covidtests.gov starting next week, and 
you can get more tests. 
Second, we must prepare for new 
variants. Over the past year, we have 
gotten much better at detecting new 
variants. If necessary, we will be able 
to develop new vaccines within 100 days 
instead of maybe months or years. 
And, if Congress provides the funds 
we need, we will have new stockpiles of 
tests, masks, and pills ready, if needed. 
I can’t promise a new variant won’t 
come, but I can promise you we will do 
everything in our power if it does. 
Third, we can end the shutdown of 
schools and businesses. We have the 
tools we need. 
It is time for America to get back to 
work and fill our great downtowns 
again with people. People working 
from home can feel safe and begin to 
return to their offices. 
We are doing that here in the Federal 
Government. The vast majority of Fed-
eral workers will once again work in 
person. 
Our schools are open. Let’s keep it 
that way. Our kids need to be in 
school. 
And with 75 percent of adult Ameri-
cans fully vaccinated and hospitaliza-
tions down by 77 percent, most Ameri-
cans can remove their masks, stay in 
the classroom, and move forward safe-
ly. We achieved this because we pro-
vided free vaccines, treatments, tests, 
and masks. 
Of 
course, 
continuing 
this 
costs 
money. So it will not surprise you, I 
will be back to see you all, and I am 
going to soon send a request to Con-
gress. The vast majority of Americans 
have used these tools and may want to 
again, may need them again, so I ex-
pect Congress—I hope you will pass 
that quickly. 
Fourth, we will continue vaccinating 
the world. We have sent 475 million 
vaccine doses to 112 countries, more 
than any nation on Earth. We won’t 
stop because you can’t build a wall 
high enough to keep out a pandemic. 
The vaccine can stop the spread of this 
disease. 
You know, we have lost so much to 
COVID–19—time with one another and, 
worst of all, so much loss of life. Let’s 
use this moment to reset. Let’s stop 
looking at COVID–19 as a partisan di-
viding line and see it for what it is: a 
god-awful disease. Let’s stop seeing 
each other as enemies and start seeing 
each other for who we are: fellow 
Americans. 
Look, we can’t change how divided 
we have been. It is a long time coming. 
But we can change how to move for-
ward—on COVID–19 and other issues 
that we must face together. 
I recently visited the New York City 
Police Department days after the fu-
nerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his 
partner, Officer Jason Rivera. They 
were responding to a 911 call when a 
man shot and killed them with a stolen 
gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old; Of-
ficer Rivera was 22 years old—both Do-
minican Americans who grew up in the 
same streets that they later chose to 
patrol as police officers. 
I spoke with their families, and I told 
them that we are forever in debt for 
their sacrifices, and we will carry on 
their mission to restore the trust and 
safety every community deserves. 
Like some of you that have been 
around for a while, I have worked with 
you on these issues for a long time. I 
know what works: investing in crime 
prevention and community policing— 
cops who walk the beat, who know the 
neighborhood, and who can restore 
trust and safety. 
Let’s not abandon our streets or 
choose between safety and equal jus-
tice. Let’s come together and protect 
our communities, restore trust, and 
hold law enforcement accountable. 
That is why the Justice Department 
has required body cameras, banned 
choke holds, and restricted no-knock 
warrants for its officers. 
That is why the American Rescue 
Plan provided $350 billion that cities, 
States, and counties can use to hire 
more police and invest in more proven 
strategies, like community violence 
interruption—trusted 
messengers 
breaking the cycle of violence and 
trauma and giving young people some 
hope. 
We should all agree: The answer is 
not to defund the police. It is to fund 
the police. Fund them. Fund them. 
Fund them with resources and train-
ing, resources and training they need 
to protect our communities. 
I ask Democrats and Republicans 
alike to pass my budget and keep our 
neighborhoods safe. And I will do ev-
erything in my power to crack down on 
gun trafficking and ghost guns that 
you 
can 
buy 
online, 
assemble 
at 
home—no serial numbers, can’t be 
traced. 
I asked Congress to pass proven 
measures to reduce gun violence, pass 
universal 
background 
checks. 
Why 
should anyone on the terrorist list be 
able to purchase a weapon? Why? 
Folks, ban assault weapons and high- 
capacity magazines that hold up to 100 
rounds. You think the deer are wearing 
Kevlar vests? 
Look, repeal the liability shield that 
makes gun manufacturers the only in-
dustry in America that can’t be sued, 
the only one. Imagine had we done that 
with the tobacco manufacturers. These 
laws don’t infringe on the Second 
Amendment. They save lives. 
The 
most 
fundamental 
right 
in 
America is the right to vote and have 
it counted. And, look, it is under as-
sault. In State after State, new laws 
have been passed, not only to suppress 
the vote—we have been there before— 
but to subvert the entire election. We 
can’t let this happen. 
Tonight, I call on the Senate to pass 
the Freedom to Vote Act, pass the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And 
while you are at it, pass the DISCLOSE 
Act so Americans know who is funding 
our elections. 
Tonight, I would like to honor some-
one who has dedicated his life to serve 
this country, Justice Breyer—an Army 
veteran, constitutional scholar, retir-
ing Justice of the United States Su-
preme Court. 
Justice Breyer, thank you for your 
service. Thank you, thank you, thank 
you. I mean it. Get up. Stand, let them 
see you. 
And we all know, no matter what 
your ideology, we all know one of the 
most serious constitutional respon-
sibilities a President has is nominating 
someone to serve on the United States 
Supreme Court, as I did 4 days ago. I 
have nominated the circuit court of ap-
peals’ Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of 
our Nation’s top legal minds who will 
continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of ex-
cellence. 
A former top litigator in private 
practice, a former Federal public de-
fender, from a family of public school 
educators and police officers, she is a 
consensus-builder. Since she has been 
nominated, she has received a broad 
range of support, including the Fra-
ternal Order of Police and former 
judges appointed by Democrats and Re-
publicans. 
Folks, if we are to advance liberty 
and justice, we need to secure our bor-
der and fix the immigration system. 
And as you might guess, I think we can 
do both. 
At our border, we have installed new 
technologies, like cutting-edge scan-
ners to better detect drug smuggling. 
We have set up joint patrols with Mex-
ico and Guatemala to catch more 
human traffickers. 
We are putting in place dedicated im-
migration judges in a significant, larg-
er number so families fleeing persecu-
tion and violence can have their cases 
heard faster, and those who are not le-
gitimately here can be sent back. 
We are securing commitments and 
supporting partners in South and Cen-
tral America to host more refugees and 
secure their own borders. We can do all 
this while keeping lit the torch of lib-
erty that has led generations of immi-
grants to this land—my forebearers 
and many of yours. 
Provide a pathway to citizenship for 
Dreamers and those with temporary 
status, 
farmworkers 
and 
essential 
workers. Revise our laws so businesses 
have the workers they need, and fami-
lies don’t wait decades to reunite. 
It is not only the right thing to do. It 
is the economically smart thing to do. 
That is why immigration reform is sup-
ported by everyone from labor unions 
to religious leaders to the U.S. Cham-
ber of Commerce. Let’s get it done once 
and for all.

March 1, 2022 
Folks, advancing liberty and justice 
also requires protecting the rights of 
women. The constitutional right af-
firmed by Roe v. Wade, standing prece-
dent for half a century, is under attack 
as never before. 
If we want to go forward, not back-
ward, 
we 
must 
protect 
access 
to 
healthcare, preserve a woman’s right 
to choose, and continue to advance ma-
ternal healthcare in America. 
And, 
folks, 
for 
our 
LGBTQ-plus 
Americans, let’s finally get the bipar-
tisan Equality Act to my desk. The on-
slaught 
of 
State 
laws 
targeting 
transgender Americans and their fami-
lies, it is simply wrong. 
I said last year, especially to our 
younger transgender Americans, I will 
always have your back as your Presi-
dent so you can be yourself and reach 
your God-given potential. 
Folks, as I have just demonstrated, 
while it often appears we do not agree, 
we do agree on a lot more things than 
we acknowledge. I signed 80 bipartisan 
bills into law last year, from pre-
venting government shutdowns, to pro-
tecting Asian Americans from still- 
too-common hate crimes, to reforming 
military justice. And soon, we will 
strengthen 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act that I first wrote three 
decades ago. 
It is important for us to show the Na-
tion we can come together and do big 
things. Tonight, I am offering a unity 
agenda for the Nation. Four big things 
we can do together. 
First, 
beat 
the 
opioid 
epidemic. 
There is so much we can do. Increase 
funding 
for 
prevention, 
treatment, 
harm reduction, and recovery. Get rid 
of outdated rules that stop doctors 
from prescribing treatments. Stop the 
flow of illicit drugs by working with 
State and local law enforcement to go 
after traffickers. If you are suffering 
from addiction, know you are not 
alone. I believe in recovery, and I cele-
brate the 23 million Americans in re-
covery. 
Second, let’s take on mental health, 
especially among our children whose 
lives and education have been turned 
upside down. The American Rescue 
Plan gave schools money to hire teach-
ers and help students to make up for 
lost learning. I urge every parent to 
make sure your school does just that, 
they have the money. We can all play 
a part—sign up to be a tutor or a men-
tor. Children were also struggling be-
fore the pandemic: bullying, violence, 
trauma, and the harms of social media. 
As Frances Haugen—who is here to-
night with us—has shown, we must 
hold social media platforms account-
able for the national experiment they 
are conducting on our children for prof-
it. Thank you for the courage you 
showed. 
It is time to strengthen privacy pro-
tection, ban targeted advertising to 
children, demand tech companies stop 
collecting personal data on our chil-
dren. Let’s get all Americans the men-
tal health services they need, more 
people they can turn to for help, and 
full parity between physical and men-
tal healthcare if we treat it that way 
in our insurance. 
The third piece of that agenda is sup-
port our veterans. Veterans are the 
backbone and the spine of this country. 
They are the best of us. I have always 
believed that we have a sacred obliga-
tion to equip all those we send to war 
and care for them and their family 
when they come home. 
My administration is providing as-
sistance in job training, housing, and 
now helping lower-income veterans get 
VA care debt-free. Our troops in Iraq 
and Afghanistan have faced many dan-
gers. One was stationed at bases and 
breathing in toxic smoke from burn 
pits. Many of you have been there. I 
have been in and out of Iraq and Af-
ghanistan over 40 times. These burn 
pits incinerate waste, the waste of 
war—medical, hazardous material, jet 
fuel, and so much more. 
When they come home, many of the 
world’s fittest and best-trained war-
riors in the world are never the same— 
headaches, numbness, dizziness, and a 
cancer that would put them in a flag- 
draped coffin. I know. One of those sol-
diers was my son, Major Beau Biden. 
I don’t know for sure if the burn pit 
that he lived near—that his hooch was 
near in Iraq, and earlier than that in 
Kosovo—was the cause of his brain can-
cer, or the diseases of so many of our 
troops, but I am committed to finding 
out everything we can. 
I am committed to military families 
like Danielle Robinson from Ohio, the 
widow of Sergeant First Class Heath 
Robinson. He was born a soldier, Army 
National 
Guard, 
combat 
medic 
in 
Kosovo and Iraq. He was stationed near 
Baghdad just yards from burn pits the 
size of football fields. 
Danielle is here with us tonight. 
They loved going to Ohio State football 
games. They loved building Legos with 
their daughter, but cancer from pro-
longed exposure to burn pits ravaged 
Heath’s lungs and body. Danielle says 
Heath was a fighter to the very end. He 
didn’t know how to stop fighting, and 
neither did she. 
Through her pain she found purpose 
to demand that we do better. Tonight, 
Danielle, we are going to do better. The 
VA is pioneering new ways of linking 
toxic exposure to diseases and is al-
ready helping more veterans get bene-
fits. Tonight, I am announcing we are 
expanding eligibility to veterans suf-
fering from nine respiratory cancers. 
I am also calling on Congress to pass 
a law to make sure veterans devastated 
by toxic exposure in Iraq and Afghani-
stan finally get the benefits and com-
prehensive healthcare they deserve. 
Fourth, and last, let’s end cancer as 
we know it. This is personal. This is 
personal to Jill and me, KAMALA, and 
so many of you. So many of you have 
lost someone you loved: husband, wife, 
son, daughter, mom, dad. 
Cancer is the number two cause of 
death in America, second only to heart 
disease. Last month I announced the 
plan to supercharge the Cancer Moon-
shot that President Obama asked me to 
lead 6 years ago. Our goal is to cut the 
cancer death rate by at least 50 percent 
over the next 25 years—and I think we 
can do better than that—turn more 
cancers from death sentences into 
treatable diseases, and more support 
for patients and their families. 
To get there, I call on Congress to 
fund what I called ARPA-H, Advanced 
Research Projects Agency for Health. 
It is patterned after DARPA, the De-
fense Department project that led to 
the internet, GPS, and so much more 
that make our forces safer and able to 
wage war with more clarity. 
ARPA–H will have a singular pur-
pose, to drive breakthroughs in cancer, 
Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. A 
unity agenda for the Nation. We can do 
these things. It is within our power. I 
don’t see a partisan edge to any one of 
those four things. 
My fellow Americans, tonight we 
have gathered in this sacred space, the 
citadel of our democracy. In this Cap-
itol, 
generation 
after 
generation, 
Americans have debated great ques-
tions amid great strife and have done 
great things. We fought for freedom, 
expanded 
liberty, 
defeated 
totali-
tarianism and terror. 
We built the strongest, freest, and 
most prosperous Nation the world has 
ever known. Now is the hour, our mo-
ment of responsibility, and our test of 
resolve and conscience, of history 
itself. It is in this moment that our 
character of this generation is formed, 
our purpose is found, our future is 
forged. 
Well, I know this Nation, we will 
meet the test, protect freedom and lib-
erty, expand fairness and opportunity, 
and we will save democracy. As hard as 
those times have been, I am more opti-
mistic about America today than I 
have been my whole life because I see 
the future that is within our grasp be-
cause I know there is simply nothing 
beyond our capacity. 
We are the only nation on Earth that 
has always turned every crisis we have 
faced into an opportunity. We are the 
only nation that can be defined by a 
single word: possibilities. 
So on this night, in our 245th year as 
a nation, I have come to report on the 
state of the Union, and my report is 
this: The state of the Union is strong 
because you, the American people, are 
strong. We are stronger today than we 
were a year ago, and we will be strong-
er a year from now than we are today. 
Now is our moment to meet and over-
come the challenges of our time, and 
we will as one people, one America— 
the United States of America. 
May God bless you all. May God pro-
tect our troops. 
Go get him. 
(Applause, the Members rising.) 
At 10 o’clock and 27 minutes p.m., 
the President of the United States, ac-
companied by the committee of escort, 
retired from the Hall of the House of 
Representatives.

You. When we feel fear, remind us that 
all power belongs to You. We thank 
You that mere human beings cannot

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
with each new day of war in Ukraine, 
the brutality and sheer evil of Vladimir 
Putin’s aggression against the Ukrain-
ian people becomes more apparent. 
Failing at securing the country with 
quick strikes, Russian forces are evi-
dently starting to engage in siege tac-
tics. Over the past 12 hours, the city of 
Kharkiv has endured especially heavy 
fire. Civilian casualties, tragically, are 
mounting. 
Today, every single Member of the 
Senate must say once again, without 
equivocation, that the United States 
stands behind the Ukrainian people and 
behind all people in all nations who op-
pose the aggressions of despotism. 
In the weeks to come, the Senate 
must work on a bipartisan basis—and 
in lockstep with the Biden administra-
tion—to pass a strong aid package pro-
viding both humanitarian aid and secu-
rity assistance to Ukraine. 
The strongest signal we can send to 
Vladimir Putin right now is that the 
United 
States 
stands 
together—to-
gether—with the people of Ukraine. 
Twenty years ago, when our own de-
mocracy was attacked right here on 
our own soil, Americans banded to-
gether—Democrat and Republican—to 
defend our Nation and our democracy. 
Today, as democracy faces its great-
est crisis in Europe since the end of the 
Cold War, we must likewise band to-
gether in support of our friends in 
Ukraine. So far, the President has done 
an excellent job uniting our Nation and 
our allies against Putin. This was not 
an easy job. The President had to show 
patience from some who had urged him 
to do things that would have torn the 
relationship 
apart—the 
European- 
American relationship. 
Now, 
because 
of 
the 
President’s 
strong leadership, the Russian Presi-
dent finds himself more isolated and a 
greater pariah than at any other mo-
ment in his time in power. When the 
full weight of international sanctions 
takes effect, the consequences will be 
catastrophic for Putin and the Russian 
economy. 
On the flip side—on the flip side—di-
visions within the United States or 
amongst our allies will only strengthen 
Vladimir Putin and strengthen his re-
solve that he can win this war, and we 
must resist him and his deeply cynical 
efforts however necessary. We must be

united in this moment, and so far our 
unity has precisely been our greatest 
asset in resisting Putin’s aggression: 
from unity amongst American people 
in solidarity with Ukraine to Amer-
ica’s unity with our European allies. 
So I hope our Republican colleagues in 
this Chamber will work with us and the 
administration to stay unified with a 
strong aid package. 
We don’t know how this crisis will 
evolve, but one thing that will not 
change is the need to maintain a 
united front so long as Vladimir Putin 
continues down his path of violence. 
For that reason, the Senate will con-
tinue working in the weeks to come on 
a strong aid package that will erase 
any doubt where our allegiance lies. 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. President, now on another sub-
ject, tonight, President Biden will 
come to the U.S. Capitol and deliver 
the first State of the Union of his Pres-
idency. Whenever the Nation takes 
stock of the state of our Union, it is 
important to know where we are today 
compared to where we were a single 
year ago. That, indeed, is a revealing 
measure of any President’s leadership. 
And despite the immense challenges 
we still have, what a difference be-
tween last year and this year. At the 
beginning of last year, we were facing 
the very worst of the pandemic. Unem-
ployment was over 6 percent. Most 
forecasters said it would take years— 
perhaps 
more—to 
make 
significant 
progress in our recovery. 
And, of course, as the Trump Presi-
dency came to a bitter and ignoble end, 
our country was still in shell shock 
from the violent assault waged upon 
this Capitol and upon democracy itself. 
Today, as we continue to face the se-
rious challenges of our time, just look 
at how far we have come. The economy 
has now grown at the fastest rate in a 
single year since the 1980s. We have 
added back the most jobs in a single 
year than in any President’s term 
ever—6 million jobs. Congress passed— 
and the President signed—the biggest 
comprehensive, standalone infrastruc-
ture law in generations, which is now 
fixing our roads and bridges, supply 
chains, and putting people to work 
across the country with good-paying 
jobs. Jobs have always been the No. 1 
issue to working families. And on that 
measure, this first year has been a 
very, very large success. 
And after years of President Trump 
currying favor with despots and auto-
crats—we all remember what he said 
about Vladimir Putin over and over 
again—the world can now rest assured 
that the United States is once again a 
reliable ally in the defense of democ-
racy and our alliances like NATO. 
And of course, COVID cases are sig-
nificantly dropping, communities are 
reopening, mask mandates are revers-
ing, and over 215 million Americans— 
215 million—have now been fully vac-
cinated. 
The road has not been easy, and cer-
tainly the work is not yet done. The 
pain of inflation is being felt around 
this country and around the world, 
thanks largely to the disruptions of the 
pandemic. 
The two greatest things vexing the 
American people are completing our 
recovery from COVID and getting life 
back to normal and fighting increasing 
costs. 
And Democrats in the Senate will 
keep our laser focus on precisely those 
issues: bringing down costs for the 
American people so we can reap the 
full benefits of our historic growth. 
From relieving shipping bottlenecks to 
making insulin more affordable, to 
lowering the cost of food, these are 
some of the things Americans want, 
and these are the issues that Demo-
crats right now are working to help 
solve. 
These problems must be handled, and 
Democrats and the Biden administra-
tion continue to work on them like a 
laser. Again, full recovery from COVID 
and increasing costs are the two big-
gest remaining issues on our domestic 
calendar, and we are focused on them. 
But even so, we cannot ignore that we 
have come far. 
And let me say this: The State of the 
Union is also an important and rare 
moment for the American people to see 
what the party in office actually 
stands for. 
It is under Democratic leadership 
that we will continue to work to lower 
costs, to fight inflation, give working 
families ladders of opportunity to get 
to the middle class, and thrive there 
once they are in the middle class. 
Republicans can’t say that. Crippled 
by Trump’s cult of personality, be-
holden to corporate interests and the 
ultrarich, the Republican agenda would 
trap Americans in a vortex of deep cyn-
icism—issues that would not solve to-
day’s dilemmas—while they pass legis-
lation that overwhelmingly would ben-
efit the very few wealthy people. 
If anyone doubts where the Repub-
lican Party stands today, all they have 
to do is read the bizarre, truly stunning 
plan released by the junior Senator 
from Florida last week—the head of 
the Republican Campaign Committee— 
which proposed everything from rais-
ing taxes on low-income Americans to 
naming a useless and ineffective border 
wall after Donald Trump. 
Imagine, we are talking about get-
ting back to normal and recovering 
from COVID and reducing costs, and 
they are talking about naming a border 
wall after Donald Trump. Which party 
is going to solve America’s problems? 
Indeed, an analysis released yester-
day by the Tax Policy Center found 
that low-income households would pay 
an average of nearly $1,000 more in 
taxes next year under a plan like Sen-
ator SCOTT’s and that nearly all of the 
new taxes under a plan like his would 
be paid by those making less than 
$100,000 a year—cut the taxes on the 
wealthy, as they did when Trump was 
President and they had the majority, 
and now increase taxes on poor people 
and working-class people. That seems 
to be where the Republicans are at. 
This is just wrong, especially at a 
time when American families are look-
ing for our help in lowering costs. So, 
tonight, the President will make clear 
that while we have a lot of work left to 
do, we have gotten a lot of work done 
already. And the Democratic Senate 
will continue, likewise, to focus work-
ing on legislation that completes our 
recovery from COVID and does every-
thing we can to make sure it doesn’t 
come back, to lower costs, to strength-
en our buoyant economy, and preserve 
America’s place as a nation of immense 
opportunity deep into the 21st century. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
week, President Biden announced his 
choice to succeed Justice Stephen 
Breyer on the Supreme Court, Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson. Judge Jackson 
was confirmed less than a year ago to 
the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Now, every Senator must carefully 
evaluate Judge Jackson’s record, legal 
views, and judicial philosophy. The 
nominee, the Senate, the Court, and 
the American people all deserve a proc-
ess that is free of embarrassing antics 
that have become the Democratic Par-
ty’s routine whenever a Republican 
President nominates a new Justice— 
the baseless smears, the shameless dis-
tortions. The country deserves a proc-
ess that is painstakingly rigorous and 
befitting the seriousness of a lifetime 
appointment to our highest Court. 
I, for one, don’t care what Judge 
Jackson’s friends wrote in her high 
school yearbook. I care that American 
families are facing major crises that 
bear directly on Federal courts and our 
legal system, from surging violent 
crime and systematically weak pros-
ecutors to open borders and campaigns 
to shrink religious freedom and the 
rights of conscience. 
What is more, one of our two major 
political 
sides 
increasingly 
makes 
noise about attacking the very legit-
imacy and structure of the Supreme 
Court itself. The country needs a seri-
ous and sobering examination of all of 
it. 
I look forward to discussing these 
issues and many others with Judge 
Jackson when I meet with her tomor-
row morning. 
It has been less than 1 year since 
Judge Jackson was confirmed to the 
DC Circuit. Since then, I understand 
she has authored only two opinions,

both in the last several weeks. I am 
troubled by the combination of this 
slim appellate record and the intensity 
of 
Judge 
Jackson’s 
far-left, 
dark 
money fan club. 
Throughout the jockeying that pre-
ceded President Biden’s announcement 
and, indeed, dating back to her prior 
confirmation last year, Judge Jackson 
has attracted loyal and intense support 
from some of the very same dark 
money, far-left activists who have de-
clared war on the institution of the 
Court itself. One has to wonder why 
these leftwing organizations worked so 
very hard to boost Judge Jackson for 
this potential promotion. 
I am sincerely looking forward to 
meeting Judge Jackson, to a thorough 
conversation tomorrow morning, and 
to the vigorous Senate process that lies 
ahead. 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. President, on another matter, to-
night, President Biden will deliver his 
first State of the Union Address. 
One year into his term, the American 
people have a lot of questions they 
would like answered: why Democrats 
plunged ahead with reckless spending 
that caused the worst inflation in 40 
years, why violent crime and illegal 
immigration 
are 
setting 
all-time 
records, why the administration hap-
hazardly withdrew from Afghanistan 
and proposed to cut defense spending 
after inflation at a time when Russia is 
trying to redraw maps in human blood. 
When President Biden took office 1 
year ago, he inherited major tailwinds 
and a brimming optimism. Brilliant 
scientists and Operation Warp Speed 
had developed vaccines in record time, 
and we were already putting doses in 
more than a million arms every day. 
Scientific data had already proven 
that, after a devastating year for chil-
dren and families, schools were safe to 
reopen in person. 
Thanks to the historic CARES Act 
and another targeted, bipartisan stim-
ulus that had just passed weeks earlier, 
our economic foundations had weath-
ered the pandemic lockdowns and were 
primed for a roaring recovery back to 
normalcy and prosperity. Before the 
pandemic, 
Republican 
policies 
had 
America as a net exporter of oil for the 
first time since World War II. 
The same voters who gave President 
Biden the Presidency gave him a razor- 
thin margin in both Chambers. His 
only mandate was to govern from the 
middle. 
In his inaugural address, President 
Biden promised to do just that—to 
unite and to heal—but for the past 
year, he and his administration have 
often behaved like they are trying to 
fail their own test. 
Remember, the President made sti-
fling American energy independence a 
day-1 priority, killing miles of pipeline 
and freezing new jobs and new explo-
ration with the stroke of a pen. 
Then came the spending bill his ad-
ministration called the ‘‘most progres-
sive domestic legislation in a genera-
tion’’ 
that 
top 
liberal 
economists 
warned would ‘‘set off inflationary 
pressures . . . we have not seen in a 
generation.’’ Inflation has surged so 
steeply, most Americans have seen 
their real wages actually cut. 
Then came the decision to cut and 
run from the international coalition we 
led in Afghanistan. President Biden’s 
top military advisers warned that re-
treat would embolden terrorists, en-
danger loyal partners, and leave our in-
telligence capabilities in the region 
badly handicapped; but the Biden ad-
ministration failed to heed these warn-
ings and presided over a disastrous 
withdrawal. Our biggest adversaries 
took notes, and now, one of them is 
testing the limits of the West’s resolve 
to oppose his murderous conquest. 
Then there are the alarming trends 
this administration has placed on the 
back burner but which communities 
across America are facing every day. 
After spending the Presidential cam-
paign talking about potential amnes-
ties, the Biden administration wasted 
no time in making our southern border 
more porous. The CBP has reported its 
highest single-year total for southern 
border encounters on record—with no 
sign of a coherent administration re-
sponse in sight. 
Meanwhile, Democrats’ response to a 
historic surge in violent crime has been 
to double down on the hostility toward 
police and the prosecution that has en-
couraged it. Across America, radical 
local prosecutors are simply declining 
to charge whole categories of crimes. 
But, instead of condemning this extre-
mism, the Biden administration has 
endorsed it, staffing their Justice De-
partment with some of the most out-
spoken critics of law and order. 
Meanwhile, this Justice Department 
goes out of its way to keep tabs on par-
ents who dare to question teachers 
unions’ veto power over established 
medical science or who exhibit skep-
ticism toward woke propaganda in pub-
lic schools. 
So that is a heck of a rap sheet, but 
I am afraid the most damaging legacy 
of President Biden’s first year is bigger 
than just his unwise policies. Demo-
crats have not just tried pushing bad 
ideas through our institutions; even 
under the Presidency of a self-styled 
institutionalist, the far left has tried 
to wreck—wreck—our institutions al-
together. 
Tonight, we will hear from a Presi-
dent who assigned a commission to 
study packing the Supreme Court be-
cause his party didn’t like its current 
ideological makeup. 
We will hear from a President who 
urged his former colleagues to tear up 
Senate rules in order to rewrite the 
rules of American elections, likened 
anyone who opposed these efforts to in-
famous racists, and continues to stoke 
racial animus with wild nonsense about 
a revival of segregation. 
We will hear from an administration 
that has failed its own tests and which, 
candidly, has the public approval fig-
ures to match. 
On foreign affairs in particular, I am 
sincerely rooting for President Biden’s 
success. We need steady, serious, and 
smart leadership to help guide the 
West through this perilous time, but on 
most issues, what the American people 
deserve tonight is a commitment to 
drastically change course. If this ad-
ministration does not majorly correct 
its course, the American people may 
correct course for them this coming 
November. 
I am glad the American people will 
also hear from Governor Kim Reynolds 
this evening. She is a strong and suc-
cessful leader who delivers real solu-
tions for the great people of Iowa. She 
fought COVID without declaring war 
on freedom or common sense. She 
backed the blue, stayed tough on 
crime, and kept Iowa’s economy open. 
I look forward to hearing her reac-
tion to the President’s remarks and her 
thoughts on how Washington could bet-
ter serve Middle America. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, every 
day, Americans get up, go to work, and 
do their jobs. It is time that all of us in 
the Senate do ours. 
We have five outstanding nominees 
for the Federal Reserve. They are 
ready. They are ready to get to work 
fighting inflation. And that fight is all 
the more important now as Americans 
brace for possible impacts at the gas 
pump and throughout our economy 
from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Vladimir Putin has made it clear he 
doesn’t care whom he hurts in his ma-
niacal quest for power. He has no prob-
lem attacking innocent Ukrainians de-
fending their country and wanting to 
continue their freedoms and their de-
mocracy. He has no regard for hard- 
working families in the United States 
and Europe and across the world who 
can’t afford higher energy prices. 
Our Senate colleagues of both par-
ties, led in part by the Presiding Offi-
cer today, Senator MURPHY, have so far 
shown a united front against Putin. We 
are united in the need for punishing 
sanctions against Putin and his cro-
nies. But along with these sanctions, it 
is our job to do all we can to make sure 
Putin’s invasion does not hurt hard- 
working Americans. 
Let’s be clear. This body, this admin-
istration, this Fed will do all it can to 
combat inflation. When it comes to 
spikes in energy prices because of 
Putin’s warmongering, our resolve is 
strong. Our commitment to democracy 
is certain. 
This is not the moment for political 
stunts. As we deal with the first land

war in Europe since World War II, as 
we confront inflation, as we work to 
continue our economic growth—in fact, 
in the past year, for the first time in 
two 
decades, 
America’s 
economic 
growth is stronger than China’s eco-
nomic growth. Our rate of growth ex-
ceeds China’s. As we emerge from this 
global pandemic, everyone understands 
we need a full Federal Reserve Board— 
the first one in nearly a decade. It has 
been since 2013 before we have had all 
seven members of the Federal Reserve. 
The Federal Reserve is in some sense 
the supreme court of our economy, as 
one Nobel Prize-winning economist, 
Joe Stiglitz, said. 
Americans don’t want more political 
theatrics; they want solutions to take 
on Putin, to protect our national secu-
rity, and to bring down costs. There is 
no more reason for delay. 
These nominees have met with every 
Senator, five nominees. These nomi-
nees have met with every Senator who 
asked for a meeting. These nominees 
met with staffs of Senators who asked. 
They offered to meet with many of my 
colleagues who refused to meet with 
them and in a couple of cases, met with 
them and were pretty combative, but 
that is OK. These nominees did every-
thing we asked of them, and then my 
colleagues boycotted the vote—some-
thing I have never seen happen, not 
just since I have been chair of Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs; I have 
never seen it since I have been in the 
Senate, where one party boycotted a 
vote and stopped that vote from actu-
ally happening as a result. 
These nominees answered every ques-
tion posed to them at the hearing. 
They answered every question sub-
mitted for the record. In one nominee’s 
case, she answered almost 200 questions 
in a 48-hour period, before the deadline. 
Then more questions came in after the 
deadline, and she still answered them. 
All of these nominees have cooperated 
with both parties in making sure that 
we can move forward. 
If we are going to continue to grow 
our economy, we need all seven Fed 
Governors in place. We need these pro-
fessionals working, debating, and mak-
ing decisions about monetary policy 
and interest rates and jobs and tack-
ling inflation. We need these profes-
sionals to do the Fed’s critical work on 
something we hadn’t really thought 
much about before—helping prevent 
cyber attacks in our financial system. 
Let me single out one of these five 
nominees because she has great exper-
tise in an issue the American public is 
more and more concerned about. We 
know and we have heard discussions in 
the media about Putin potentially hav-
ing interest in cyber attacks against 
our country, against Europe, against 
us. Sarah Bloom Raskin—this is the 
moment for her in her record and ex-
pertise. She helped lead efforts in both 
government and the private sector. 
Before she was nominated for the 
Federal Reserve to be Vice Chair of Su-
pervision, a key position to weigh 
risks—risks of cyber attacks, risks of 
climate change, risks brought about by 
many, many banks not having the cap-
ital that they have held that they 
should—she served as cochair of the G7 
Cyber Expert Group. She is a former 
Fed Governor. She was No. 2 at Treas-
ury. She was a banking commissioner 
in Maryland. She has elevated this 
issue of cyber attacks and cyber attack 
risks on corporate boards. She played a 
pivotal role in helping craft the Obama 
administration’s 
efforts 
to 
combat 
cyber threats in the financial industry. 
She is the leader we need at this crit-
ical moment on all of these issues, es-
pecially cyber. Let’s get her on the job. 
Let’s get all of these nominees on the 
job. 
Dr. Lisa Cook and Dr. Philip Jeffer-
son—they 
understand 
workers 
and 
communities that make our economy 
work. 
Dr. Cook was born in a small town in 
Georgia, 
graduated 
from 
Spelman, 
went to Oxford to study as a Truman 
scholar, and has a Ph.D. from Berke-
ley. 
Dr. Philip Jefferson grew up in the 
shadow of RFK Stadium—grew up with 
not a lot of material assets—and 
worked as a young man at the Federal 
Reserve before he went back to school 
and got his Ph.D. He is now dean of a 
prestigious school in the Carolinas. 
As I said, they understand workers. 
They understand communities. 
Chair 
Powell 
and 
Governor 
Brainard—the two nominees who have 
already been serving on the Fed—led 
the Fed’s extraordinary effort to sup-
port our economy throughout the pan-
demic. 
We need a full Federal Reserve 
Board. We need a united front to make 
our economy stronger, to take on infla-
tion, to take on Putin. I implore my 
Republican colleagues: Just show up. 
Vote no if you want to vote against 
these five nominees. That is certainly 
your right. But we don’t come to the 
Senate where they hand us a paper and 
say: Check a box—‘‘yes,’’ ‘‘no,’’ or ‘‘I 
don’t think I will show up and do my 
job.’’ No. You vote yes or you vote no. 
I just implore my colleagues on the 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee to show up to cast their 
votes, and we will then move forward. 
We need them to make our economy 
stronger and to take on inflation. 
The world is looking at us now. We 
are still the leader of the free world. To 
play these political games while in the 
midst of this awful attack, this poten-
tially growing land war in Europe, to 
play games on the committee and with-
hold your votes and not show up to 
work—let’s show the world what a 
functioning 
democratic 
government 
looks like. Let’s get this done for the 
people whom we serve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, over the 
past week, the world has watched in 
horror as once again an imperialist 
Russia sets its sights on a sovereign 
nation in Eastern Europe. 
Vladimir Putin’s unjustified and un-
justifiable war of aggression has al-
ready left hundreds dead and created a 
massive refugee crisis as noncombat-
ants flee Russian attacks. 
At this minute, Russia continues to 
press forward with attacks on several 
fronts, with a focus on the capital city 
of Kyiv, but courageous Ukrainian re-
sistance, both from its formal military 
and from an increasing number of civil-
ians, is slowing Russia. Kyiv and other 
major cities remain under significant 
pressure and could fall within days, but 
Ukraine is demonstrating a fierce re-
solve and continuing to blunt Russian 
advances. 
Russia has also been a victim of its 
own deficiencies, such as poor tar-
geting, broken supply lines, and a lim-
ited ability to fight at night. Surpris-
ingly, Russia has not yet established 
full air superiority, with some Ukrain-
ian jets still flying and some air-to-sur-
face 
systems 
still 
available. 
This 
means Ukraine can still fly combat 
sorties and strike back against Russia. 
Similarly, Ukrainian command, con-
trol, and communications appear to be 
intact. 
How long these conditions can last, 
however, is an open question, which 
underscores the urgent need to con-
tinue to provide Ukraine with the 
weapons it needs to stay in this fight 
and to bring the free nations of the 
world together to sanction and isolate 
Russia for its unjustifiable aggression. 
This is Ukraine’s fight, but the United 
States and allies can provide weapons 
and humanitarian assistance while im-
posing 
swift 
and 
severe 
sanctions 
against Russia. 
We must also shore up NATO to send 
a signal to Putin that the United 
States will make good on our defense 
commitments. This is essential not 
only to help prevent this war from 
spreading farther into Eastern Europe 
but to send a message to China that 
similar acts of aggression will not be 
tolerated. We know Taiwan remains in 
the crosshairs of President Xi, and just 
as Putin is flexing his power in Europe, 
communist China is looking for any 
opening to pounce. 
Many pundits have speculated about 
Putin’s mindset and ultimate goal with 
this attack and how far he would be 
willing to go despite mounting losses. I 
think it is clear he is willing to take it 
to the next level. We should be con-
cerned that as Russia continues to 
meet heavy resistance, Putin will order 
his generals to increase pressure no 
matter the cost—this means no matter 
the cost to his own troops, many of 
them young soldiers and conscripts, 
and no matter the cost to the Ukrain-
ian people. 
Putin’s 
failures 
in 
Ukraine 
and 
mounting international pressure may 
also spur Putin to escalate beyond 
Ukraine and lash out against the West. 
He has already ordered his nuclear

forces 
on 
high 
alert—yet 
another 
unprovoked escalation that has drawn 
immediate condemnation. 
The United States and other free na-
tions must match the resolve of the 
Ukrainian people and respond with 
swift 
and 
severe 
consequences 
for 
Putin and his cronies. The people of 
Ukraine have shown their fierce deter-
mination to fight, drawing inspiration 
from emerging stories of heroism. 
A reported ‘‘Ghost of Kyiv’’ fighter 
pilot has allegedly scored six kills 
against Russian jets. It may only be an 
urban legend, but it has captured 
Ukraine’s underdog grit nonetheless. 
Ukrainian border guards on a remote 
island in the Black Sea refused to sur-
render to the Russian Navy in a defiant 
radio transmission. 
A Ukrainian solder sacrificed himself 
on Friday by manually detonating 
charges to collapse a bridge when there 
was not enough time to detonate them 
remotely before a Russian column 
closed in. 
A Ukrainian woman defiantly ad-
dressed 
Russian 
occupiers, 
offering 
them sunflower seeds and telling them 
to put the seeds in their pockets so 
that sunflowers will grow when they 
die in Ukraine. 
Ukraine has handed out over 18,000 
weapons to reservists around Kyiv, 
with social media posts showing men 
and women lining up to volunteer. 
Ukrainian Parliament Member Kira 
Rudik is taking up arms, hoping to in-
spire other women to join the resist-
ance. Ukrainian media is broadcasting 
instructions on how to make Molotov 
cocktails to attack Russian vehicles. 
Then there is President Zelenskyy, 
who has led the Ukrainians with ex-
traordinary resolution and courage. 
President Zelenskyy is believed to be 
Putin’s top target, and there are re-
ports of Russian forces being sent into 
Ukraine for the express purpose of as-
sassinating Ukraine’s President. Yet, 
according to press reports, when he was 
offered 
the 
chance 
to 
evacuate, 
Zelenskyy said: 
The fight is here. I need ammunition, not 
a ride. 
Former Ukrainian President Petro 
Poroshenko has also been visible in 
Kyiv, saying Ukraine will resist ‘‘for-
ever’’ when asked how long the nation 
can hold out. 
Ukraine’s resolve has been on display 
for the world to see, as have Vladimir 
Putin’s true colors. Putin was given 
every chance to choose diplomacy and 
peace. Instead, he chose war. 
Putin has offered wild justifications 
for 
his 
attacks, 
suggesting 
that 
Ukraine somehow posed a nuclear 
threat to Russia and is governed by 
neo-Nazis and drug addicts. He has also 
called for Ukrainian soldiers to defect 
and to ‘‘take power into their own 
hands.’’ It may be that Russia is laying 
the groundwork for a narrative that 
there is an organic pro-Russian contin-
gent within Ukraine, possibly within 
the Ukrainian military itself, to be 
stood up as an ‘‘authentic’’ coup to 
carry out regime change. Putin has 
also claimed that the Ukrainian mili-
tary is moving equipment into residen-
tial neighborhoods, which would be 
consistent with a resistance or insur-
gency defensive posture but will also 
give Russia pretext to increase civilian 
targeting. 
Vladimir Putin is apparently on a de-
lirious quest to restore the Soviet 
Union and once again see Ukraine 
under its thumb. Unfortunately for 
him, he apparently reckoned without 
the people of Ukraine. Each missile 
that strikes a village, every rocket 
that strikes an apartment building, 
every tank that rattles by a once-quiet 
town will only further stoke Ukrain-
ian’s resentment of the Kremlin. 
Judging by the way Ukrainians are 
fighting, I don’t think they will ever 
accept Russian rule. As the growing 
number of Russians boldly protesting 
in the streets—from Moscow to St. Pe-
tersburg to Siberia—and online are 
making clear, Putin is also losing the 
trust of everyday Russians, particu-
larly of the younger generations whom 
he is likely leaning on for conscripts 
and who will inherit a decimated econ-
omy. Even the daughter of Putin’s own 
spokesman posted on Instagram ‘‘No to 
war!’’ which went viral before it was 
deleted. 
Russian protests have spread to more 
than 50 cities, and, in keeping with his 
KGB past, Putin’s response has been to 
detain protesters and restrict access to 
Facebook and Twitter. Unfortunately 
for him, however, it has become clear 
that he will not be able to fully hide 
the truth from the Russian people. 
Russians are clearly coming to know 
Putin as a murderous warmonger who 
will isolate them from the free world. 
It is unfortunate that the world did 
not take a more aggressive stance 
against Vladimir Putin before he in-
vaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine. 
I supported sanctions against Nord 
Stream 2 and the other punitive meas-
ures of the NYET Act before Russia 
made its attack. It is too bad it took 
Putin actually going to war for the 
world to get serious about checking 
Russian aggression. However, I am 
pleased that the United States and our 
partners are finally moving forward 
with unprecedented sanctions against 
Russia’s economy. 
The United States is sanctioning 
Russia’s central bank and freezing its 
assets in the United States, and a 
growing number of nations are united 
to block Russia from the SWIFT finan-
cial transaction messaging system. If 
blocked from this system, Russia will 
have to conduct run-of-the-mill bank-
ing 
transactions 
directly 
between 
banks, adding costly delays that should 
discourage any business with their 
banks. Putin has also joined the select 
list of despots, like Kim Jong-un, indi-
vidually sanctioned by the United 
States. 
While I am glad we have taken these 
steps, there is more we can and should 
do, including directly targeting the 
lifeblood of the Russian economy, and 
that is Russia’s energy sector. Every 
dollar the world denies Putin by not 
buying his oil and gas is one less dollar 
he has to spend on his war of aggres-
sion in Ukraine. 
The conflict in Ukraine is also a 
timely reminder that energy independ-
ence is not only economic security but 
national security and that here in the 
United States, we need to do every-
thing we can to get our energy pro-
ducers off the bench and into the game 
so that we don’t have to rely on foreign 
regimes for energy supplies. 
The situation is also a reminder of 
how important it is to make a robust 
investment in our own military to re-
store 
our 
Nation’s 
readiness. 
The 
Vladimir Putins of the world will only 
respond to strength, and we need to en-
sure that our Nation’s military is pre-
pared to meet threats from traditional 
state actors as well as terrorist organi-
zations. When it comes to dictators 
like Putin, the best way to secure 
peace is through robust deterrence. 
As Congress reviews the administra-
tion’s supplemental request for foreign 
security and humanitarian assistance, 
we cannot offset this funding by de-
grading our own defense. This is a mili-
tary emergency—just ask the people of 
Ukraine—and we should treat it as 
such. I hope Congress will come to a 
sensible solution in the days and weeks 
ahead. 
My thoughts and prayers today are 
with the people of Ukraine. I hope they 
know that their courage and deter-
mination have inspired millions, and I 
pray that the United States and free-
dom-loving countries the world over 
will continue to do our part by pro-
viding the lethal aid Ukrainians need 
to stay in this fight and by imple-
menting biting sanctions that will 
leave Putin and his cronies out in the 
cold. 
I yield the floor.

STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am 
going to join a number of my Repub-
lican colleagues on the floor today to 
talk about the State of the Union. 
Tonight, President Biden will come 
to Congress to give his annual State of 
the Union Address. He is going to try 
to do his very best to paint a rosy pic-
ture of the status quo. No matter how 
hard the President of the United States 
tries tonight, Joe Biden cannot hide 
the fact that his policies have put 
America in crisis. There is a war in Eu-
rope. We have the worst inflation in 40 
years, the worst violent crime in 25 
years, the highest prices at the pump 
for gasoline in 7 years, and the most il-
legal crossings into the United States 
ever. So no matter what Joe Biden says 
tonight, he is the one who has created 
these crises. We are less secure at home 
and abroad than the day Joe Biden 
took office. 
Over the last 10 months, the Amer-
ican people have said loud and clear

March 1, 2022 
that inflation is a top concern, and Joe 
Biden has only poured fuel on the fire. 
He told us that the fire would burn 
itself out quickly. Yet inflation has 
only burned hotter. 
Yesterday, the Associated Press put 
it this way. The Associated Press said: 
‘‘On cusp of Biden speech, a state of 
disunity, funk, and peril.’’ The article 
goes on to say: ‘‘Today’s national psy-
che is one of fatigue and frustration.’’ 
They go on to say it is ‘‘the malaise of 
our time.’’ 
In March of 2021, Joe Biden signed 
the single largest spending bill in 
American history. He put $2 trillion on 
America’s credit card, flooded the 
country with cash, government cash. 
Since then, prices have gone up faster 
and faster than wages. 
Joe Biden repeatedly said inflation 
would be ‘‘transitory.’’ He said it 
month after month after month as peo-
ple felt their paychecks being eaten 
away. In December, Joe Biden said in-
flation had ‘‘peaked.’’ Joe Biden has 
been dead wrong again and again and 
again. The American people are re-
minded of this every time they go to 
the gas station, every time they go to 
the grocery store, and every time they 
pay their heating bill. It is no wonder 
Joe Biden’s approval rating on han-
dling inflation, which is the No. 1 con-
cern of the American people, is just 31 
percent. That means Republicans don’t 
approve, Independents don’t approve, 
and a lot of Democrats don’t approve of 
how the President has handled their 
No. 1 concern. 
So tonight I expect President Biden 
will once again ask Congress to pass 
another 
reckless 
tax-and-spending 
spree. He will call it Build Back Better 
or, more accurately, ‘‘Break Your 
Back’’ bill. I am not sure what he is 
going to call it. It is going to be Build 
Back Better part 2. 
No matter what the President says 
tonight, the American people are going 
to continue to say, ‘‘No, thank you,’’ to 
all this additional government spend-
ing. 
The American people do not trust 
this President or the Democrats to 
tackle the issues that they care about. 
Inflation is eating away their pay-
checks and has been doing so now 
month after month after month. 
Millions of people are entering this 
country illegally. Shelves are going 
empty. No whitewashing by this Presi-
dent can cover up this painful reality 
for the American people. 
So tonight I will listen carefully to 
what the President has to say. The 
American people don’t want to listen 
to a fairytale tonight. They are not 
looking for a bedtime story from the 
President of the United States. The 
American people are looking for real 
answers. 
Joe Biden can brag if he wants. The 
American 
people 
know 
the 
truth. 
America is in crisis. The American peo-
ple understand that. And the American 
people know that the person to blame 
for all of this is squarely right there, 
the man behind the podium, the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING RICHARD C. BLUM 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, two 
things, and the first one is very short 
but something that is sorrowful that 
we have to talk about, Senator FEIN-
STEIN
losing her husband. Senator 
FEINSTEIN is a friend of mine. You get 
very well acquainted with people when 
you work with—like when I was chair-
man of the Judiciary, and she was 
ranking member. For years before 
that, she and I chaired or cochaired the 
drug caucus. 
So we all know that she lost her hus-
band of 42 years over this weekend. We 
know that he had a long battle with 
cancer. Dick and DIANNE
supported 
each other during everything life threw 
at them, and they had fun along the 
way. Together, they were even strong-
er. DIANNE
has dedicated herself to 
working for the people of California, 
and she had no better confidant and 
supporter than her husband Dick. 
Many Americans think that Senators 
of opposing political parties don’t get 
along, and that is not the case. All 100 
of us know that here. It is too bad that 
journalists always make controversy 
the center of everything, so people—at 
least in Iowa—have an extraordinary 
view that we never speak to each 
other, and that is not the case. 
And I would just point out how Sen-
ator FEINSTEIN and I have worked to-
gether. Barbara and I express our deep-
est sympathy to DIANNE and her family 
on Dick’s passing, as they grieve the 
loss of a life well lived. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, now to another point 
that I have come to talk to my col-
leagues about. 
In Biden’s inaugural address a year 
ago, he called repeatedly for unity. He 
said: 
We can treat each other with dignity and 
respect. We can join forces, stop the shout-
ing, and lower the temperature. For without 
unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and 
fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. 
I was glad to hear him say all of 
those good intentions. I took it, really, 
as an invitation for bipartisanship. It 
sounded like the Joe Biden that I knew 
as a Senator for the 28 years that he 
and I worked together. So I reached 
out early on to offer to work with him 
on lowering the cost of prescription 
drugs. 
But right out of the gate, he rejected 
good-faith offers from all of us to work 
together on another COVID relief pack-
age, as Republicans and Democrats had 
on five others throughout the year of 
2020. 
Even with the narrowest of margins, 
and you can’t get much more narrow 
than a 50–50 Senate, President Biden 
let his party’s agenda be dictated by 
the most radical progressive wing of 
his party. The extreme radicals refused 
to compromise on a wish list having 
nothing to do with COVID. 
President Biden should instead have 
listened to Professor Larry Summers. 
He was President Clinton’s Treasury 
Secretary and President Obama’s Chief 
Economic Adviser. Professor Summers 
warned that all the spending the pro-
gressives were insisting on would fuel 
the fires of inflation, and now we know 
how right Professor Summers was. 
But that $2 trillion spending binge 
just whet the appetite of the very 
young 
radicals 
in 
the 
Democratic 
Party who don’t remember the 1970s’ 
stagflation. And if they had memories 
of stagflation, they willingly ignored 
history. 
Instead of offering to find common 
ground on issues like prescription drug 
pricing, the Democrats wasted much of 
the year trying to spend another $4 
trillion on a slew of brandnew entitle-
ment programs. 
His 
one 
significant 
bipartisan 
achievement, passing a bipartisan in-
frastructure bill, was all but gift 
wrapped and handed to him by a bipar-
tisan group of Senators. 
Even then, liberal Democrats nearly 
derailed it by insisting its fate be tied 
to the passage of their unrelated lib-
eral spending spree that is referred to 
as Build Back Better. Opponents called 
it ‘‘Build Back Worse.’’ 
Thankfully, moderate Democrats in 
the House successfully delinked the 
two bills, as we did in the Senate, and 
sent the infrastructure bill to the 
President’s desk. So that was a bipar-
tisan victory for the President, and it 
was a victory for bipartisanship in this 
Senate. 
Now, even more importantly, thanks 
to the leadership of Senator MANCHIN, 
along with the principled stand of Sen-
ator SINEMA, Democrats multibillion- 
dollar liberal spending spree floun-
dered—Build Back Better floundered. 
As a result, we avoided piling even 
more gasoline into the inflation fire. 
But as Larry Summers warned and 
Senator MANCHIN feared, the fire of in-
flation is already burning brightly. It 
is picking the pockets of hard-working, 
middle-class Americans, who are pay-
ing more for gas and groceries, and, for 
that matter, everything else. 
President Biden’s reluctance to stand 
up to the radical voices in his own 
party or listen to moderate criticism 
has led to failure after failure. 
There is President Biden’s decision to 
shut down the Keystone Pipeline day 1 
of his administration and, more re-
cently, to not shut down Russia’s Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. 
But now, thanks to Germany and the 
Ukraine situation, that is shut down— 
but no thanks to President Biden. 
He pulled the few remaining troops 
out of Afghanistan in a chaotic hurry, 
leaving Americans stranded.

S851 
March 1, 2022 
He has even accused friends across 
the aisle, people of my political party 
whom he has long worked with, as 
being Jim Crow racists. 
This isn’t the uniting President that 
he promised that he would be on Janu-
ary 20 of last year. 
The good news is that it is not too 
late to change course. So, hopefully, he 
will get a big voice from both political 
parties about it is not too late to 
change course and work in a bipartisan 
way. 
There is reason to believe that he is 
trying to be Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt. But trying to be FDR without 
FDR’s popularity and FDR’s super-
majority in the Congress—that ap-
proach has failed. 
I invite President Biden to face re-
ality, ignore the radicals in his polit-
ical party, whether in Congress or on 
his staff, and work across the aisle in a 
way I know we can. I saw that regu-
larly for 28 years. Be the President you 
promised to be at your inauguration, in 
other words. 
The American people want action on 
issues that they are facing this very 
day: inflation, spike in violent crimes, 
prescription drug costs, open borders, 
and you could have a myriad of other 
things. 
I could name three things that I am 
part of a bipartisan effort to get things 
done: One, take on Big Tech, KLO-
BUCHAR and GRASSLEY; take on the big 
meatpackers, GRASSLEY
and TESTER 
and FISCHER and WYDEN; and take on 
prescription drugs, as WYDEN
and I 
worked on that prior to last year, when 
Democrats took over, and they forgot 
all about it. 
Let’s get some of these things done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
ENERGY 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss the need to imme-
diately increase our domestic energy 
production to counter Russia’s inva-
sion of Ukraine. 
For an energy-rich nation such as 
ours, it is unacceptable that our coun-
try has been increasingly reliant on 
Russia for oil. In recent months, we 
have imported nearly 600,000 barrels 
per day of Russian oil. At the same 
time, the Biden administration has 
worked systematically to shut down 
domestic U.S. oil and gas production. 
American oil and gas producers, in-
cluding those in North Dakota, have 
proven that they have the capacity to 
produce more oil here at home. We had 
gotten to 1.5 million barrels of oil a 
day production; now, 1.1 million barrels 
a day. 
We can do more; other States can do 
more. We need to do it not only for our 
consumers here at home but to help 
our allies in Europe. 
Our economy, quality of life, and se-
curity depend on access to low-cost, de-
pendable energy from all sources, both 
traditional and renewable. 
The Biden administration’s hostile 
energy policies treat America’s abun-
dant oil, gas, and coal reserves dif-
ferently, and they treat it as a liabil-
ity. 
We are seeing the direct consequence 
of that approach, allowing investment 
and dollars to flow to energy producers 
like Russia, Iran, and other countries 
that leverage their own energy against 
our interests, with little or no regard 
for environmental stewardship; where-
as, our environmental stewardship is 
the best in the world. 
It is time we harness our vast stra-
tegic energy reserves and maintain our 
status as a global energy powerhouse. 
President Biden will soon deliver his 
State of the Union Address, and it is 
time he works with us to support our 
domestic energy producers and aban-
don his failed approach to energy pol-
icy. 
Each additional barrel of oil we can 
produce here at home strengthens our 
economic and national security and 
helps our allies. Each additional U.S. 
barrel offsets production from Russia 
and other adversaries. Each additional 
barrel of oil helps reduce prices for 
American consumers, and because en-
ergy is built into virtually everything 
we consume, lowering energy costs 
helps bring down inflation. That means 
empowering and encouraging our do-
mestic producers and reversing the 
Biden administration’s policies that 
curtail production. 
To start, the Interior Department 
needs to immediately end the leasing 
moratorium and hold previously post-
poned lease sales, both onshore and off-
shore. 
We need to expand our energy infra-
structure to ensure efficient delivery 
to consumers. That includes approving 
the Keystone XL Pipeline, which is leg-
islation that I led, and we passed dur-
ing the Obama administration. Now, it 
was vetoed by President Obama, but it 
was my bill. We approved it in this 
Chamber, approved it in the House, got 
it to the President, and the President 
vetoed it. If he hadn’t, we would have 
Keystone Pipeline today, bringing mil-
lions of more barrels of energy to our 
country and to our allies, working with 
our closest friend and ally, Canada. 
We need to strengthen our energy 
trade with Canada—as I said, obvi-
ously, one of our most important al-
lies. 
It also includes building new natural 
gas pipelines to connect areas like New 
England to domestic gas reserves in 
Pennsylvania and West Virginia. 
We need to expand liquefied natural 
gas—LNG—exports to our European al-
lies to provide cleaner, more efficient 
alternatives to Russian gas. 
The gas that we send from our LNG 
facilities to Europe, on a lifecycle 
basis, has 41 percent less emissions 
than Russian gas. 
I will soon be introducing the Amer-
ican Independence from Russia Act, bi-
cameral legislation, with Representa-
tive CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, which 
requires the President to provide Con-
gress with an energy security plan 
that, first, evaluates U.S. oil imports 
and exports; second, assesses our en-
ergy security risks based on oil im-
ports; and, third, encourages U.S. do-
mestic oil production to offset Russian 
imports. This is all about a return to 
regulatory certainty to protect our ca-
pacity to produce energy, and that 
means helping producers attract cap-
ital investment. 
It is time we unleash the full poten-
tial 
of 
U.S. 
energy 
producers 
to 
strengthen our energy independence 
and weaken authoritarian adversaries 
like Russia and others. In addition to 
strengthening national security, robust 
and domestic energy production will 
help provide lower energy costs and re-
lief from inflation for hard-working 
American families. We need to unleash 
our energy resources for the sake of 
our own consumers and our allies. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SINEMA). The Senator from Iowa. 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, to-
night, the President will deliver the 
annual State of the Union Address. And 
I have to admit, as a result of Presi-
dent Biden’s policies over the past 
year, nearly everything is up—con-
sumer prices, up; violent crime, up; the 
national debt, illegal border crossings, 
fatal drug overdoses, our trade deficit— 
they are all up. 
But what isn’t up is the public’s view 
of the President and his policies. In 
poll after poll, the majority of Ameri-
cans disapprove of the job that Presi-
dent Biden is doing. On nearly every 
key issue facing the country, Ameri-
cans, by and large, just do not think 
Mr. Biden is up to the job. And more 
than two-thirds of Americans lack con-
fidence that President Biden can bring 
the country closer together, something 
he promised the American people that 
he would do. Folks, this is really no 
surprise since it is, after all, the Presi-
dent’s unpopular partisan policies that 
are driving Americans further apart. 
President Biden might try to mask 
himself as a moderate, but no one is 
being fooled. Behind the mask, the real 
Biden agenda is more mandates from 
Washington, higher prices for all Amer-
icans, and less security at home and 
abroad. As a direct result of mandates 
imposed by this administration, for ex-
ample, thousands of healthcare work-
ers have lost their jobs at a time when 
we need them more than ever. 
And because of the massive amount 
of money being printed in Washington, 
inflation is soaring at its highest point 
in 40 years. The cost of food, gas, hous-
ing, and just about everything else is 
significantly 
more 
expensive 
today 
than it was before President Biden was 
sworn into office. 
The President chose leftwing climate 
fantasies over national security. His 
doctrine of appeasement has resulted 
in America becoming more energy de-
pendent on foreign adversaries like 
Russia for the energy that is necessary 
to heat our homes and keep our coun-
try on the move.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S852 
March 1, 2022 
And with the Russian military on the 
march in Europe and terrorists in con-
trol of Afghanistan once again, the na-
tional and economic security of our 
Nation has been set back decades. It is 
really quite stunning and gravely con-
cerning what an incredible mess Presi-
dent Biden has created in such a short 
period of time. 
Yet the White House is attempting to 
convince the American people that ev-
erything is fine. The President called 
his hastily ordered exit from Afghani-
stan an ‘‘extraordinary success,’’ de-
spite leaving thousands of Americans 
and allies behind. 
And the Biden administration has re-
peatedly denied that rising prices and 
empty shelves are even a problem, 
while fanning the flames of inflation 
and out-of-control spending. Folks, if 
simply printing money could solve the 
problem for us, we would be living in a 
utopia right now since Washington 
spent nearly $7 trillion last year alone. 
Instead, every American is feeling the 
pinch of Bidenomics—because spending 
is not the solution, folks; it is the prob-
lem. 
And you would think that in light of 
Putin’s aggression and the threats 
from 
other 
adversaries, 
our 
Com-
mander in Chief would be focused on 
strengthening and modernizing our de-
fenses. Instead, funding for the Depart-
ment of Defense is being held hostage 
by the President and Democrats in 
Congress until the widely popular 50- 
year-old ban on taxpayer funding for 
abortions is repealed. 
Folks, is this really the time to play 
abortion politics with our Nation’s na-
tional security? 
Having spent the last half-century in 
Washington, President Biden is totally 
out of touch with the everyday needs of 
Iowa families. And the world around us 
has become much more dangerous 
under his watch. 
Just remember as you listen to his 
address, every time the President pro-
poses increasing Washington spending, 
that translates into higher prices and 
taxes for you. Every new government 
expansion 
the 
President 
proposes 
means more Washington mandates and 
control over you. And no matter who 
he blames for the security crises we are 
in now, it is the President’s poor deci-
sions and lack of leadership that con-
tinue to make our Nation less safe at 
home and abroad. 
To get our Nation moving in the 
right direction, we need a forward- 
looking, freedom-first agenda. To en-
sure our families have and can afford 
the food and essentials they need, the 
supply chain must be fixed. To protect 
and prepare our children for the future, 
we need schools to be a place of learn-
ing, not ‘‘woke’’ indoctrination. To 
protect 
our 
Nation 
from 
foreign 
threats, we need to ensure U.S. energy 
independence and the strength of our 
military remains unmatched. And to 
form a more perfect union, Washington 
needs to stop micromanaging how we 
live our lives and start abiding by the 
most important mandates in America, 
the ones that are listed in our Con-
stitution’s Bill of Rights, which pro-
tect us from government intrusion. 
These goals don’t represent a par-
tisan platform but rather an inclusive 
agenda for all Americans that puts 
each one of us back in charge of the di-
rection of our own lives. It is a vision 
based on freedom, on liberty, on oppor-
tunity. 
Folks, I know this vision works be-
cause that is exactly what is happening 
in my home State of Iowa under the 
leadership of our Governor and my 
friend, Kim Reynolds. She has led with 
Iowa common sense and compassion 
since day one. 
Right now, Governor Reynolds is ex-
panding opportunities for everyone by 
cutting taxes to help families and 
small businesses. She is standing up for 
our freedom, putting our kids first, and 
ensuring parents have their voices 
heard. 
Under her leadership, Iowa was the 
first State to reopen our schools during 
the pandemic. Governor Reynolds is 
pushing back on the massive Wash-
ington overreach from President Biden 
and standing up for our way of life. 
And she is fighting to keep the left’s 
‘‘woke’’ agenda out of Iowa. 
Folks, Governor Kim Reynolds is the 
perfect choice for the Republican re-
sponse to tonight’s State of the Union 
Address and her record of success in 
Iowa is the ideal contrast to the life in 
Joe Biden’s America. 
Things are not fine, folks. You and I 
know that, and we feel that every day. 
But Governor Reynolds—her leadership 
and her vision for a better future— 
leaves me very optimistic about what 
lies ahead for America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, to-
night, on the other side of the Capitol, 
President Joe Biden will tell the Amer-
ican people what a great job he has 
done. He will read a speech, and seated 
behind him will be NANCY PELOSI and 
Vice President Kamala Harris. 
Not even the most extreme Demo-
cratic partisan can believe that the 
last 14 months have been a success. Joe 
Biden campaigned for President as a 
reasonable and centrist moderate, and 
he abandoned every one of those prom-
ises the moment he put his hand on the 
Bible. Instead, he has handed the agen-
da over to the most radical and ex-
treme voices on the far left, and the re-
sult for the country has been disas-
trous. 
In 14 months, we have seen trillions 
of new spending and trillions of new 
debt, the highest debt in the history of 
our Nation. 
We have seen a war on domestic en-
ergy production. In his first week in of-
fice, Joe Biden shut down the Keystone 
Pipeline, destroying 11,000 jobs, de-
stroying 8,000 union jobs. He halted 
new leasing on Federal lands and off-
shore drilling, and the predictable re-
sult of launching an assault on domes-
tic energy production is that energy 
prices skyrocketed. 
But for that matter, everything has 
skyrocketed—food, 
electricity, 
rent, 
home, lumber, gasoline, heat, every 
basic expense. Working families are 
suffering and especially seniors—espe-
cially those on fixed incomes. 
Then we have our southern border— 
the absolute chaos and crisis on our 
southern border—over 2 million people 
crossing illegally into this country, the 
worst rate of illegal immigration in 61 
years. And it is worth noting that 
Biden inherited, the year before, the 
lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 
years. So he turned success into failure 
because he implemented the radical 
leftwing ideas of open borders from the 
extreme left. 
The crime and chaos of disease com-
ing from 2 million illegal immigrants 
is compounded domestically by the ex-
treme left’s war on the police. We have 
seen the far left advocating abolishing 
the police, advocating defunding the 
police. We have seen George Soros’ 
funded district attorney releasing vio-
lent criminals. And as a result, crime 
is up, murders are up, carjacking is up. 
And the Biden administration has em-
braced that radical agenda, nominating 
not one, but two of the leading advo-
cates of abolishing the police to senior 
positions in the Department of Justice. 
Unfortunately, every single Democrat 
in this Chamber voted to confirm those 
leading advocates for abolishing the 
police. 
We have seen Joe Biden imple-
menting illegal and unconstitutional 
vaccine mandates; standing up and fir-
ing soldiers and sailors and airmen and 
marines; advocating that doctors be 
fired, that nurses be fired, that police 
officers be fired, that firefighters be 
fired, that airline captains and flight 
attendants be fired—an assault on our 
liberties. And as disastrous as the do-
mestic policy has been and as disas-
trous as the economic policy has been, 
the foreign policy has been even worse. 
We saw in Afghanistan the cata-
strophic withdrawal—the surrender to 
the Taliban, leaving Americans behind. 
And unfortunately, when that hap-
pened, every enemy of America, they 
looked to Washington, they looked to 
the Oval Office, and they took the 
measure of the man in the Oval Office; 
and they all concluded that the Presi-
dent was weak and feckless and ineffec-
tive. 
As I said at the time when we with-
drew from Afghanistan, the chances of 
Russia 
invading 
Ukraine 
have 
in-
creased tenfold. As I said at the time, 
the chances of China invading Taiwan 
have increased tenfold. 
When the President is weak, when he 
is ineffective, our enemies are on ad-
vance and every region of the world 
you look at is worse for America. 
Russia has launched the largest war 
in Europe since World War II. China is 
more aggressive—is running concentra-
tion camps with a million Uighurs, is

murdering and torturing innocent peo-
ple in China. 
And mind you, when I brought a vote 
to the Senate floor that said the U.S. 
Government should not purchase goods 
manufactured using slave labor in Chi-
nese concentration camps, every Demo-
crat but one voted no. 
These are extreme positions. This is 
not the mainstream. This is not the 
center. This is the radical and extreme 
left. NANCY PELOSI will not portray it 
on her face, but she knows in January 
she will no longer be Speaker of the 
House. And I will say, Joe Biden’s be-
coming President was the best thing 
that ever happened to Vladimir Putin. 
Biden began his Presidency by sur-
rendering to Putin, waving the sanc-
tions on Nord Stream 2; sanctioned bi-
partisan sanctions that I authored that 
had stopped that pipeline, that had 
stopped an invasion of Ukraine; and 
Biden decided surrendering to our ad-
versary was a better policy. As Neville 
Chamberlain has demonstrated, ap-
peasement doesn’t work. 
The state of America is strong, but 
the state of the Union and the state of 
the Federal Government in Washington 
is disastrous. Yet the one bit of bright 
light on the horizon that I am con-
fident President Biden will not point to 
is that the American people will vote 
in November, and I believe they will 
change the path we are on. 
We have seen the disaster of the ex-
treme radical left. If Biden could re-
member the Joe Biden who swore me 
into office, the Joe Biden who swore 
many of my colleagues into office, the 
Joe Biden whom we served with—if he 
could remember that Joe Biden—it 
would be a very different administra-
tion. Sadly, this White House has de-
cided the radical, extreme, socialist 
left sets the agenda, and the results of 
that agenda are playing out for fami-
lies all across the country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I, along with 
Senators 
Hagerty, 
Peters, 
and 
Portman, be recognized to speak for up 
to 5 minutes each before the scheduled 
recess. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I was 
not intending to speak. As the Pre-
siding Officer knows, I was presiding, 
and she was kind to spell me. 
Yet, as I was hearing colleagues talk 
on the floor about the state of our 
country, what I was hearing from my 
Republican colleagues were words like 
‘‘malaise,’’ ‘‘funk,’’ ‘‘disaster,’’ and I 
was seeing visuals of a house on fire. 
So I was compelled to stand and just 
offer a few extemporaneous remarks. 
I don’t think America is a disaster. I 
don’t think America is on fire. I don’t 
think America is in a deep, unyielding 
malaise. I have heard colleagues talk 
about the situation in the world and 
use the ‘‘appeasement’’ word. I have 
heard language, both in committee 
hearings this morning and here on the 
floor, that I would characterize as a 
kind of a ‘‘blame America first’’ atti-
tude. If something is going on—if a dic-
tator like Vladimir Putin acts in a hor-
rific way—it has got to be America’s 
fault. It has got to be Joe Biden’s fault. 
I don’t think our instinct should be to 
blame America first when dictators in 
the world undertake despicable ac-
tions. 
What I have noticed in these com-
ments today in trashing our President 
and in trashing the country—sort of a 
cherry-picking of evidence—is that my 
colleagues 
have 
brought 
up 
some 
things that are really very legitimate 
concerns. Inflation is a very, very le-
gitimate concern that has to be ad-
dressed. Yet I have listened to these 
speeches, and not one has talked about 
record job growth. Not one has talked 
about strong GDP growth. Not one has 
talked about dramatic increases in the 
wages and salaries of low- and mod-
erate-income people. 
Is that because my colleagues are un-
aware of those things? 
No. They know these things. They 
are just choosing not to discuss them 
because what they want to do is to 
paint a picture of an American mal-
aise, an American funk, an American 
disaster. That is not what this country 
is. Yet my colleagues are very willing 
to paint a false picture by omitting 
key evidence. 
I listened to the speeches this morn-
ing, and not one mentioned that 
COVID deaths and hospitalizations are 
coming down dramatically and that 
the CDC now has said, in most of my 
Commonwealth and in most of the 
country, you needn’t wear masks in-
doors. I would think they might have 
mentioned that because part of the rea-
son for this recent progress is the vac-
cinations; it is the vaccines that were 
developed in the previous administra-
tion. They could have taken a little 
credit for it, but, no, they didn’t men-
tion it at all. COVID is coming down. 
There 
is 
strong 
economic 
growth, 
strong job growth, strong wage and sal-
ary growth. 
Around the world, a NATO that the 
previous President trashed when he 
was cozying up to the dictator Vladi-
mir Putin is demonstrating to the en-
tire world that, when it is resolved to 
unify, the power of American-led alli-
ances is a huge force for good in this 
world. 
So I am just trying to grapple with 
the one-sided presentation of American 
disaster, American malaise, American 
funk. Here is the way I understand it. 
The last 2 years have been brutal. 
The death toll due to COVID is now 
nearly 950,000. It will eclipse a million. 
I am 64 years old as of a couple of days 
ago. It has been the hardest 2 years in 
my life and for our country with the 
death, the illness, the economic devas-
tation, the job loss. It has been brutal 
here, and it has been brutal all around 
the world, and it is not completely in 
the rearview mirror yet. 
I suspect what you are going to hear 
President Biden say tonight—this is 
my intuition; I don’t have knowledge. 
He is going to acknowledge the incred-
ible pain we have been living under in 
this country and around the world for 
the last 2 years—nearly unprecedented 
in a century. He is going to point out 
that there are still significant chal-
lenges and that there is still too high a 
percentage of Americans who haven’t 
taken advantage of these vaccines. 
Yes, inflation is a problem, and there 
are problems that we have to deal with, 
but when you look at strong job growth 
and strong wage growth and strong 
GDP growth and when you look at de-
clining case numbers, I will tell you 
what I see. I see the beginnings of 
something that we often see in Amer-
ican life—an American comeback. We 
are comeback people. We are comeback 
people. 
A friend of mine once said: Tough 
times don’t last. Tough people do. 
We are tough, tough people. 
As I travel around Virginia—and I 
was traveling around Virginia last 
week—I don’t fundamentally see funk 
or malaise or ‘‘poor, poor, pitiful me’’ 
or blaming America for the woes of the 
world or blaming Joe Biden for the re-
ality of a tough situation we have been 
living through. I see people with their 
chins up and their heads held high, who 
will acknowledge that we have chal-
lenges and that we have got problems 
to solve but who believe that we are on 
our way to a better chapter after a 
very difficult last couple of years. 
That is the can-do spirit I see around 
Virginia. That is the can-do spirit, I be-
lieve, that has always characterized 
Americans, not a ‘‘we are on fire’’; ‘‘it 
is a malaise time’’; ‘‘it is a funk time.’’ 
No. I see a can-do spirit and the begin-
nings of an American comeback under-
way after what has been the most pain-
ful 2 years during my 64 here on the 
planet. 
I don’t know, if I am right, whether 
that is good news or bad news for my 
colleagues who are here on the floor, 
painting the negative picture. I would 
think it would be good news. But if it 
were good news, why wouldn’t I have 
heard some acknowledgment of job 
growth or wage growth or GDP growth? 
Why wouldn’t I have heard acknowl-
edgment about COVID cases coming 
down? 
We do need to work together. The 
Presiding Officer inspired all of us with 
her work on the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill, which, as I was traveling 
around Virginia last week—and I am 
sure most of us were doing this in our 
States—my mayors and my State offi-
cials and my local economic develop-
ment officials were talking with ex-
citement about what this will mean in 
terms of the rebuilding of American 
communities where we haven’t in-
vested in infrastructure for a very long 
time. 
I don’t think this is a moment when 
the leadership class of this country 
should be amplifying pessimism about

this country. I think it is a moment 
when the leadership class of this coun-
try should be amplifying an optimistic, 
can-do message that I think is in ac-
cord with the values of Virginians and 
the values of Americans. I suspect that 
that kind of a message—the acknowl-
edgment of the difficult reality but the 
foundation being laid for the begin-
nings of an American comeback after 2 
tough years—is the message that we 
are going to hear from President Biden 
tonight. 
With that, I yield the floor.

SUPPORTING 
REOPENING 
THE 
UNITED STATES CAPITOL BUILD-
ING AND SENATE OFFICE BUILD-
INGS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
rose in this Chamber 2 weeks ago to 
again urge the Senate to reopen the 
U.S. Capitol and to reopen the Senate 
office buildings. At that time, Demo-
crats objected to my resolution in sup-
port of reopening. Two weeks later, it 
has become even more clear that the 
American public is tired of government 
mandates and of COVID shutdowns. 
Democrats have exploited the pan-
demic to execute a power grab over 
American life—a power grab that al-
lows Democrats to dictate whether 
children can attend schools, whether 
Americans can keep their jobs and op-
erate their businesses, and how elec-
tions are conducted. These Big Govern-
ment lockdowns and mandates have 
caused irreparable damage that will be 
felt for generations to come. As we 
move ahead, we mustn’t lose sight of 
this lesson. 
On the bright side, even the Biden ad-
ministration is seeing the poll num-
bers, and they are adjusting the science 
accordingly. 
On 
Friday, 
the 
CDC 
changed its guidance once again. Now 
indoor masks are not recommended for 
most Americans. Masks are no longer 
required on either side of the Capitol 
Building. Why, even Washington, DC, 
has opened up and lifted its mask man-
date. Amazingly, all of this happened 
just in time for the State of the Union 
Address. 
The only science that is being fol-
lowed here is the political science, but, 
thankfully, America is returning to 
normal. 
Americans 
everywhere 
are 
safely living their lives—going to work 
and school, visiting stores, attending 
events, and gathering with their fami-
lies and their friends. They shouldn’t 
have to know somebody in order to 
visit their Representatives, to take a 
tour of the Capitol, to get into this 
building. 
It is time for the lockdown on democ-
racy to come to an end. Today, I am 
once again asking my colleagues to re-
join reality and reopen the Capitol to 
those to whom it belongs—the Amer-
ican people. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Rules 
and Administration be discharged from 
further consideration and that the Sen-
ate now proceed to S. Res. 512. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 512) supporting re-
opening the United States Capitol Building 
and Senate Office Buildings to the American 
people. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. HAGERTY. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolution be agreed to; 
that the preamble be agreed to; and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 512) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in the RECORD of February 15, 
2022, under ‘‘Submitted Resolutions.’’) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
am glad that the Senate has agreed to 
my resolution to reopen the Capitol, 
and I urge the House of Representa-
tives to pass a very similar resolution 
that was introduced in that body so 
that all parts of the Capitol Complex 
are open to the American people. 
I also stand ready to work with my 
colleagues and with the Capitol Police 
to implement this resolution so that 
we can welcome the American people 
back into their Capitol as soon as pos-
sible. 
I yield the floor.

POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT OF 
2022—Motion to Proceed—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
H.R. 3076 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, last 
night, the Senate came together for 
the American people and overwhelm-
ingly voted to move forward on his-
toric, bipartisan, bicameral, and long- 
overdue reforms that will help ensure 
the stability and the long-term success 
of the U.S. Postal Service. 
The Postal Service is one of our Na-
tion’s oldest and most trusted institu-
tions. It serves as a critical lifeline for 
millions of Americans, including sen-
iors and veterans in rural communities 
who expect the Postal Service to de-
liver vital mail, including supplies and 
medications. 
However, for more than 15 years, this 
public service and its dedicated work-
ers have been hindered by burdensome 
financial requirements. The need to 
quickly pass these balanced reforms, 
which are broadly supported by the 
American people, has become increas-
ingly urgent. 
One persistent burden has been a re-
quirement to prefund every single cent 
of healthcare benefits that every single 
postal worker employee will use when 
they eventually retire, no matter how 
far off that may be. This is something 
that no business in America is required 
to do, and for good reason. It makes no 
practical sense, and it has imposed an 
enormous cost on the Postal Service 
that has threatened their ability to 
provide reliable and timely delivery. 
In recent years, we have seen first-
hand how burdensome policies have 
driven the Postal Service to resort to 
harsh measures to cut costs and, as a 
result, compromise delivery service. 
We must act now to set this critical in-
stitution on a sustainable financial 
footing by passing the Postal Service 
Reform Act. 
This bipartisan, commonsense legis-
lation will save the Postal Service 
more than $49 billion in the next 10 
years by eliminating the aggressive 
prefunding 
requirement 
for 
retiree 
health benefits and by integrating 
postal retirees’ healthcare with Medi-
care. 
These changes will help ensure the 
Postal Service, which is self-sustaining 
and does not receive taxpayer funding, 
can continue serving the people and 
avoid making severe cuts down the line 
that would impact millions of Ameri-
cans. These reforms will also require 
the Postal Service to deliver 6 days a 
week so it can continue serving as a 
critical lifeline for countless commu-
nities that need timely delivery of 
their essential needs. 
This legislation will also make the 
Postal Service more transparent and 
accountable to the American people by 
making weekly local performance data 
publicly 
available 
online, 
enabling 
every single community to see exactly 
how the Postal Service is performing in 
their area. 
I introduced this legislation in the 
Senate last year and have worked hand 
in hand with Ranking Member ROB 
PORTMAN from Ohio, as well as Chair-
woman MALONEY and Ranking Member 
COMER
on the House Committee on 
Oversight and Reform, to craft this 
bill. 
Last month, the House passed this 
legislation with overwhelming bipar-
tisan support. Last night, we saw this 
body advance it with significant bipar-
tisan support once again. Now the Sen-
ate has a historic opportunity to move 
this legislation forward. 
I am proud to have helped secure sig-
nificant bipartisan support for our Sen-
ate companion bill, with a total of 14 
Democratic and 14 Republican cospon-
sors backing the legislation. 
Together, we can finally, after more 
than 15 years, pass this commonsense, 
bipartisan legislation to set the Postal 
Service on a stable financial foot and 
bring it into the future. We can support 
our dedicated and hard-working postal 
employees, as well as the customers 
whom they serve. We can set the Post-
al Service up for success so that fami-
lies and small businesses, veterans, 
seniors, and all Americans can con-
tinue to rely on this critical public

service, as they have for generations. 
We can show the American people this 
body can set aside partisanship and 
work hand in hand to improve their 
lives. 
Every single day that we delay will 
just hurt the Postal Service. We must 
pass these urgently needed reforms. I 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
this legislation and pass it swiftly so 
that we can ensure the long-term suc-
cess of this treasured institution and 
the essential role it plays in the lives 
of every single American. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of the legislation 
that my colleague from Michigan just 
talked about. This is H.R. 3076, the 
Postal Service Reform Act. What it 
really is, though, is ensuring that the 
post office works, that it works for the 
constituents whom I represent and peo-
ple all around the country. 
Unfortunately, right now, the post 
office is in trouble. It is in dire need of 
reform, and if we don’t do it, we are 
going to have big problems. The post 
office just had its 15th consecutive an-
nual net loss in 2021, and they pro-
jected they are going to be insolvent in 
the next few years unless we make 
these reforms and other reforms as well 
that can be made by the post office 
itself. In fact, they project a 10-year 
loss of $160 billion if we just continue 
with the status quo. 
The reality is that the Postal Service 
is delivering less and less first-class 
mail. We are all online. We are not 
sending as many letters as we used to. 
Yet there are more and more addresses 
that they deliver to because more and 
more people want to get the mail they 
do deliver, the packages, the direct 
mail, and so on. So it doesn’t work. It 
is a recipe for ruin if we don’t adjust to 
the new reality and make some nec-
essary changes. 
Last year, Senator PETERS and I did 
introduce the legislation he talked 
about. We had 26 cosponsors, equally 
divided 
between 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats. We kept this bipartisan 
from the start. In fact, I would even 
say we tried to keep it nonpartisan. 
What could be more nonpartisan than 
trying to save the post office? Every-
body cares about the post office and 
wants to be sure it is working well and 
working efficiently. It is not a partisan 
issue; it is of importance to all Ameri-
cans—young, old, urban, rural, every-
body. 
I hear a lot about it back home from 
my constituents. A constituent from 
Butler County, OH, wrote me recently 
and said: 
My father, a veteran of the Vietnam war, 
has COPD and is 70 years old. He receives his 
lifesaving medication through the mail. My 
father can’t breathe without his daily in-
haler. 
We have to be sure the post office 
works for him. 
A 
constituent 
from 
Montgomery 
County wrote: 
As a disabled veteran, I need to vote by 
mail. 
We have the ability to vote by mail 
in Ohio. It is no-fault absentee. But it 
requires the Postal Service to work, 
right? It doesn’t work well if the ballot 
is late and is not counted. 
A constituent from Richland County, 
OH, wrote: 
The post office is essential to millions of 
Americans, including seniors and veterans 
who depend on it for medications, small busi-
ness owners who are already struggling. 
Everybody. Everybody. 
Putting the Postal Service on sound 
financial footing cannot be accom-
plished through an act of Congress 
alone. This is not just about passing a 
law here. We are going to do that. We 
had a good vote last night, and I think 
we will get more people supporting it, 
I hope, as we go through the week. But 
it is also about reforms that the post 
office is going to make itself. 
The 
current 
Postmaster 
General, 
Louis DeJoy, has embarked on an am-
bitious plan to transform the Postal 
Service by finding efficiencies, includ-
ing transforming existing capabilities 
to more efficiently meet the needs of 
the American people. He is taking on a 
10-year plan to make certain changes 
to make the post office more efficient, 
but he has made clear to us that he 
needs the financial space to do that. He 
needs some headroom here by us mak-
ing some important changes here in 
Congress. 
We have a role to play too. This is 
what we do: 
First, we eliminate a burdensome and 
unique prefunding requirement for re-
tiree health benefits. Congress man-
dated this back in 2006 for current em-
ployees, regardless of age. That has 
crippled the Postal Service financially. 
Prefunding of retiree health benefits is 
not something that anybody else has to 
do. It is really uniquely the post office. 
The Federal Government does not do 
that. The private sector does not do 
that. In fact, very few private sector 
entities, of course, offer retiree health 
benefits. They rely on Medicare. So the 
Federal Government doesn’t do it. The 
private sector doesn’t do it. Why is the 
post office doing it? That is a good 
question. We are just trying to bring 
the post office in line with what every-
body else is doing with regard to re-
tiree health benefits. 
Second, it requires Postal Service 
employees who are retiring—who have 
been paying into Medicare their entire 
career, by the way—to actually enroll 
in Medicare Part B and Part D. Every-
body is in Part A, but about 25 percent 
of postal employees are not in Part B. 
Instead, they rely on the Federal em-
ployee health benefit plan, which is far 
more expensive. 
This includes the ability for these 
post office retirees to get into Medi-
care Advantage. That is very impor-
tant to me. So just like happens under 
current 
opportunities 
to 
enroll 
in 
Medicare Advantage under the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Program, 
they would be able to use the Medicare 
Advantage Program, which I like. It is 
kind of a wraparound program that 
gives you more opportunities for more 
options and benefits. It is more like a 
private sector plan. A lot of my con-
stituents in Ohio like it and use it. 
Currently, again, about 25 percent of 
postal employees don’t enroll in Medi-
care even though they are eligible for 
it. Again, they paid their HI payroll 
tax, the HI tax you see on your pay-
check. This means the Postal Service 
is currently paying higher premiums 
for FEHB than other public or private 
sector employers who require Medi-
care. This is a big savings for them. 
Third, it requires the Postal Service 
to maintain its current standard of 6- 
day-a-week delivery through an inte-
grated delivery network of mail and 
packages. This was important to a lot 
of my colleagues—particularly those 
representing rural areas—that they 
keep this 6-day-a-week delivery. It is 
important to the guy who is from But-
ler County who gets his COPD medica-
tion through the mail. So it requires 
the post office to continue to do that 
even while finding other efficiencies. 
In terms of the integrated delivery 
network of mail and packages to-
gether, it underscores through a rule of 
construction that this has no impact 
on existing rules governing how the 
Postal Service attributes costs between 
packages and mail. 
Let me repeat that. We provide for an 
integrated delivery system of mail and 
packages, and that makes sense. If you 
are going to deliver mail to somebody, 
you should also be delivering the pack-
age, right? That is much more effi-
cient. But we say that this has no im-
pact on existing rules governing how 
the Postal Service attributes costs be-
tween packages and mail. 
This is important to me because this 
makes sure that the private sector will 
not be subject to unfair competition. 
In addition to doing all of these 
things, the Congressional Budget Office 
estimates that the bill will result in a 
little more than $1 billion in savings in 
outlays and $458 million in savings in 
direct spending. 
The bottom line is, the Congressional 
Budget Office, CBO, the nonpartisan 
group up here in Congress, has looked 
at this and said there is going to be a 
$1.5 billion savings to the taxpayer be-
cause of this legislation—$1.5 billion 
savings to the taxpayer. 
Because it makes sense, this legisla-
tion received strong bipartisan support 
when it was taken up in the House of 
Representatives. In fact, it was passed 
by a vote of 342 to 92. Not much gets 
passed with those kinds of big bipar-
tisan numbers these days. Republicans 
and Democrats alike looked at this and 
said: You know, the post office is in 
trouble. We have to do something. 
Some say: Well, this may not be per-
fect. Well, it is not perfect. Nothing is 
around here. But it is a whole lot bet-
ter than the alternative, and it does 
get the post office back on track.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S856 
March 1, 2022 
Again, along with the reforms that are 
being undertaken at the Postal Service 
itself, this legislation gives them the 
financial breathing room they need to 
be able to save the post office. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in supporting this bill. Let’s put the 
post office in a position to succeed and 
provide those essential services that 
small businesses, veterans, and rural 
constituents rely on so much. 
I appreciate working with my col-
league Senator PETERS on this over 
time to find consensus. Both sides had 
to make concessions to get to this 
point. We have ended up with a good 
bill. Let’s pass this bill and ensure that 
the post office is healthy for our con-
stituents moving forward. 
I yield the floor.

POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT OF 
2022—Motion to Proceed—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, as 
the Senate process on the Postal Serv-
ice Reform Act is underway, I want to 
rise today to highlight the daily im-
pact the U.S. Postal Service has on 
folks back home, particularly in rural 
Kansas. 
Many Americans rely upon the U.S. 
Postal Service. When a special occa-
sion arises, they will send a card to a 
loved one. And while receiving a letter 
or a card, a gift in the mail—instead of 
a text message or email these days— 
brings lots of people lots of joy and a 
connection to people, the U.S. Postal 
Service holds a very different role for 
so many Kansans living in rural Amer-
ica. 
Its services are ingrained in the daily 
routines and lifestyles of our rural 
communities. Men and women of our 
communities gather at the post office. 
They see their friends and neighbors 
when they go to get their mail at the 
mailbox at the post office. Everything 
from celebrating birthdays and wed-
dings to supporting the town’s econ-
omy, to even providing lifesaving as-
sistance during a natural disaster or 
global pandemic revolves around the 
post office. 
Rod Holub, former president of the 
Kansas State Association of Letter 
Carriers, reminded me of a supercell 
tornado that hit Manhattan, KS, in 
June 2008. There was no electronic 
communication available, and the only 
reliable way to communicate was the 
post office. One of the first people al-
lowed in the affected area was Rod, the 
postal carrier. 
Kansans living in Manhattan at the 
time have told me stories of how Rod 
assured every family that they would 
still be able to connect to their mail 
service since electronic communica-
tions were down, and it would be a 
while before they could be restored. In-
surance claim information and legal 
documents were going to be vital in re-
building their lives, and Rod ensured 
safe, secure, and timely delivery of 
those documents. 
Similar situations occurred in the 
communities of Reading and Greens-
burg when natural disasters cut off 
their access to the local post office. 
When natural disasters wreak havoc in 
Kansas, a priority in the aftermath is 
helping to ensure postal operations re-
sume quickly for Kansans who lost al-
most everything. In both of the cases 
of Greensburg and Reading, the Postal 
Service worked quickly with the com-
munities to reestablish mail service 
and provide a method of communica-
tion to rebuild from the destruction. 
It is often a neglected fact that the 
U.S. Postal Service letter carriers are 
the protective eyes and ears of the 
neighborhood, often going the extra 
mile to aid a customer in need of as-
sistance. One such story occurred when 
a Kansas letter carrier discovered a 
customer confined to a wheelchair in 
the heat of summer and without air- 
conditioning, a fan, or a ramp to get in 
and out of their home. The Kansas let-
ter carrier took it upon herself to rally 
the neighbors who all provided the cus-
tomer with a window AC unit, a fan, 
and had a ramp built. 
Much of the benefits of the Postal 
Service Reform Act will be halting the 
service reductions Kansans have been 
subjected to for the past 15 years. Doz-
ens of post offices across the State 
have closed and multiple rural proc-
essing facilities in Dodge City, Colby, 
Hays, Salina, Topeka, and Fort Scott 
were shuttered. Now, if you live in 
many parts of Western Kansas or East-
ern or Southeast Kansas, your mail is 
processed someplace far away—North 
Platte, NE; Amarillo, TX. There are 
only two processing facilities that re-
main in our State. The impact of these 
closures and consolidations dispropor-
tionately affect rural Kansans in both 
service reductions and lost jobs. 
Congressional action on the postal 
reform legislation will allow the U.S. 
Postal Service to continue serving 
rural America without fear of immi-
nent service reductions that will fur-
ther isolate rural communities. The so-
lution to the post office’s financial cir-
cumstances can’t simply be elimi-
nating service, reducing service. To en-
sure that the U.S. Postal Service main-
tains its vital services, I urge my col-
leagues to support and vote for the 
Postal Service Reform Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3652 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise 
today to discuss Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine, and in a moment, I am going 
to ask unanimous consent to pass some 
legislation which has been kicking 
around here for a while and is way 
overdue. 
What we have witnessed over the 
past 5 days is a flagrant act of 
unprovoked aggression perpetrated by 
Russia against Ukraine. 
The world we are living in today is 
different from the one we lived in last 
week. For months, I, along with my 
Senate colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, have watched the conflict inch 
closer and closer. 
The intelligence community provided 
accurate and clear information on the 
situation, and for this, I commend 
them. I also commend them for releas-
ing the vast majority, if not all of the 
information they had in an attempt to 
deter Putin. That didn’t work. How-
ever, there is no question, we should 
have taken action sooner rather than 
later, and it is time to do so now in a 
much more aggressive fashion. 
In preparation for this invasion, 
many of my Senate colleagues and I 
drafted 
hard-hitting 
sanctions 
and 
called repeatedly for more lethal as-
sistance for months. We used all lever-
age at our disposal to pressure the ad-
ministration to take sufficient action, 
but despite our actions, our efforts, it 
didn’t happen. Certainly, some mili-
tary assistance was provided, but it is 
hard not to think that if we had expe-
dited Javelin and Stinger deliveries 
last year and let our allies move more 
equipment 
sooner, 
the 
Ukrainians 
would be making the Russians pay a 
much higher price. 
Right 
now, 
Ukraine 
desperately 
needs the support of the international 
community. It needs us to sanction 
Russia, to punish its government for 
this unjustified attack. These Ukrain-
ian heroes need more weapons, armor, 
and supplies to fight back the Russian 
invaders and preserve the lives of its 
population. 
The Biden administration was well- 
intentioned in pursuit of a diplomatic 
resolution for Russia’s aggression, but 
the administration was wrong to op-
pose our congressional efforts to im-
pose even tougher sanctions that were 
essential to make our deterrence cred-
ible. President Biden made it clear that 
maximum economic sanctions would 
only come after Putin invaded. The ad-
ministration’s promise that the threat 
of sanctions would be enough to deter 
Putin was a mistake. Look where we 
are now. Diplomacy has failed. The in-
vasion has happened. 
While sanctions have now been levied 
on Russia, there is still room for more 
robust sanctions in order get Putin to 
pull back. I have always said I am all 
in on all of the above when it comes to 
Ukraine and Russia. 
I am happy to support legislation 
proposed by my Democrat colleagues, 
but the Senate must take the lead and 
mandate the massive economic sanc-
tions that President Biden and his offi-
cials committed to. 
The NYET Act, which I introduced 2 
weeks ago with numerous cosponsors,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S857 
March 1, 2022 
contains the tough sanctions that will 
bring the hammer down on Putin and 
his regime and provide the assistance 
that Ukrainians need now. It is based 
on the bipartisan negotiations that 
took place over the last 2 months and 
includes many measures that have 
been endorsed by Members on both 
sides of the aisle. 
To be clear, I understand that my 
friends on the other side are going to 
object to this; nonetheless, a good 
number of the things they suggested 
are in this bill. 
The NYET Act places sanctions on 
Russia’s lucrative mining, mineral, and 
oil and gas sectors—actions that the 
administration thus far has refused to 
take. This needs to be done, and we 
haven’t received an explanation as to 
why they haven’t done it. It punishes 
Russian and Belarusian Government 
and military officials for their horrific 
actions and will expose the full extent 
of Putin and his cronies on the left. 
The bill sanctions 12 of the largest 
Russian banks and critically also im-
poses secondary sanctions on them— 
something the administration has yet 
to do. Secondary sanctions are critical 
to hurting the Russian economy. They 
force the world’s financial institutions 
to make a choice between Russia and 
Western markets. They will choose the 
West. Indeed, for their own good, they 
must choose the West. Russia will be 
isolated. 
When it comes to sanctions, I want 
to thank Senator TOOMEY for helping 
on that part of this bill, and he is going 
to talk about them in just a minute for 
just a period of time. 
NYET also increases the funding for 
military assistance to Ukraine, as well 
as other Eastern European nations, to 
Radio Free Europe, to Radio Liberty, 
the Global Engagement Center, and re-
fills the President’s drawdown account. 
It also establishes a new Ukrainian 
resistance fund to help Ukraine con-
tinue to resist attempts to occupy or 
subjugate any new territory Russia 
seizes, while sending a clear message to 
Putin that his military will pay a price 
for advances into sovereign Ukrainian 
territory. Their resistance has been 
nothing short of awe-inspiring; that is, 
the Ukrainian people themselves. We 
need to help them, and this bill, the 
NYET Act, will do exactly that. 
I hope my colleagues across the aisle 
will put aside partisanship and join us 
today by passing this bill, which will 
impose crippling sanctions on Russia’s 
most powerful people and which will 
support the people of Ukraine. All of us 
are moved by the Ukrainian people and 
their fight for freedom. I know my 
Democrat colleagues can and have sup-
ported nearly all of these concepts at 
one time or another. I ask them to join 
me today. 
This is the most deliberative body in 
the world, we always say. Well, we 
have overdeliberated, and it is time to 
act. 
I yield the floor to Senator TOOMEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
want to thank the ranking member of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee for the work he has done on this 
for years. 
I just want to make a couple of 
points here. One is—it is a very hard 
point to make, but I think we ought to 
be candid, and that is, there is a very 
real danger that the Russian military 
will eventually prevail. Let’s be hon-
est. They are much larger. They have 
far more resources. The Ukrainians are 
putting up an absolutely historic and 
heroic fight, but it is not clear that 
they can hold on indefinitely. 
So what should we be doing in light 
of that fact and the circumstances we 
have? I completely agree with Senator 
RISCH. We have an obligation, in my 
mind, to provide the resources that we 
can. We are doing that. This legislation 
would go further. 
There is one other thing we can do 
that I think is extremely important as 
well, and that is, establish as a goal 
that as soon as possible, Vladimir 
Putin come to regret this decision. It is 
extremely important, in my mind, that 
Putin and all of the other authoritar-
ians and bullies and dictators around 
the world see this invasion of Ukraine 
as a terrible, strategic mistake for 
Russia to have made because if they 
don’t conclude that this was a mistake, 
then it doesn’t end with Ukraine. 
So how do we ensure that this is uni-
versally recognized, including by Putin 
and those who would like to emulate 
him? How do we make sure they see it 
as the mistake that we believe it is? 
There is one way to do this: We bring 
the Russian economy to its knees. And 
we have the ability to do that, but we 
have chosen not to do so thus far. 
Now, I am pleased to see the adminis-
tration moving in the direction of 
sanctioning. I am pleased that many of 
our European allies have taken steps to 
go in this direction. But until we shut 
down the main source of revenue for 
Putin and his war machine, we will not 
have accomplished what we need to ac-
complish. 
This legislation does that. Among 
other things, it directly imposes the 
sanctions on the oil and gas industry— 
the industry that is 60 percent of all 
Russian exports, 40 percent of govern-
ment revenue, and more than 20 per-
cent of the entire economy. It goes 
after this source of cash to fund the 
war-fighting machine directly with 
sanctions, but it also does it in an indi-
rect fashion that is very important, 
and I want to touch on this. 
This legislation imposes what we call 
secondary sanctions on the Russian 
banking sector. Why is that important? 
We have all heard that some Russian 
banks are going to be excluded from 
the SWIFT system. That is true, and 
that is constructive; however, it is not 
dispositive by any means. 
The SWIFT system is just a commu-
nication system. There is no money ac-
tually transferred on SWIFT. Pay-
ments aren’t made. If we deny Russian 
banks access to SWIFT, we don’t deny 
them the ability to conduct business, 
the ability to move money on behalf of 
oligarchs and the oil and gas industry. 
We don’t cut off the flow of revenue to 
Putin, not just by kicking them off 
SWIFT. We make it inconvenient for 
them, but there are workarounds that 
you can use to get around the obsta-
cles. 
What we need to do and what we do 
in this legislation is we make a very 
simple proposition to the entire world. 
Banks all around the world will under-
stand that if this legislation becomes 
law, they have a choice to make: They 
can do business with Russian banks or 
they can do business with the United 
States of America, but they can’t do 
both. That is not a tough decision for 
the world’s banks. The overwhelming 
majority and all of the significant ones 
will choose to do business with the 
United States. That shuts down the 
Russian banking industry. That shuts 
down the revenue stream for Vladimir 
Putin. That shuts down the money that 
is funding this appalling, atrocious 
military campaign. 
Are there any consequences to us? It 
is possible that for some period of time, 
there would be somewhat higher en-
ergy prices. We don’t import very 
many Russian energy products. We 
shouldn’t be importing any at this 
point. We don’t import much. But the 
fact is, we can make up for a disruption 
in supply by enhancing our own pro-
duction and encouraging an increase on 
the part of swing producers who are 
much more closely allied with us than 
with the Russians. 
The 
Ukrainian 
people 
and 
the 
Ukrainian people’s elected leaders have 
been absolutely heroic. They are fight-
ing for their very lives. And, as I say, 
if Putin does not conclude that this 
was all a very big mistake, then it 
doesn’t end with Ukraine. 
I join my colleagues in urging the 
adoption of this legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I thank my colleagues Senators 
RISCH and TOOMEY for their leadership 
on these efforts. 
Americans are watching Russia’s in-
vasion into Ukraine, and they are look-
ing to us for leadership. As an evil ty-
rant wages war, they are asking how 
our government will respond. So here 
we are. Congress is in session, and Sen-
ator SCHUMER has placed the world’s 
most pressing issue on the back burner. 
What could be more important than 
supporting a fellow democracy under 
attack against a thug whose goal is to 
control as much of Europe as he can? A 
postal reform bill and a radical abor-
tion bill. 
The freedom, wealth, and resources 
of Europe are under attack. Senator 
SCHUMER wants to use our time to en-
sure more unborn babies can be killed 
and pass a postal reform bill that 
doesn’t actually provide any long-term 
reform for America’s postal workers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S858 
March 1, 2022 
And for what? So that President 
Biden has some progressive talking 
points he can use during his speech? 
This is wrong. Even Switzerland, 
which has spent decades with a strong 
sense of neutrality, took decisive ac-
tion this week and froze the assets of 
Putin and his thugs. 
The 
Ukrainian 
people 
are 
being 
pushed out of their country and are 
losing their lives as they bravely de-
fend their homes. We are hearing sto-
ries of Ukrainian grandfathers taking 
up arms to defend their families. Why 
can the Senate not come to work ready 
to take on the gross attacks by Putin? 
He is threatening to use nuclear 
weapons, and he is threatening NATO 
members with cyber attacks and sub-
version. Yet Senator SCHUMER wants to 
put the Senate’s focus elsewhere. 
And we all know that the Postal 
Service is not in dire straits. It will 
continue delivering the mail this week, 
next week, and the week after. 
But the same cannot be said about 
the continued self-rule of Ukraine or 
peace and stability in Europe as Putin 
threatens to expand this war. That is 
why Senator RISCH and I sent a letter 
to Senator SCHUMER asking he delay 
bringing up the postal reform bill and 
prioritize our support for the people of 
Ukraine. 
When Putin is threatening to undo 
our global order and seize further con-
trol of wealth and power across Europe, 
Congress must act swiftly and severely. 
Placing any other legislation, espe-
cially a bill which does not address any 
urgent issues, ahead of addressing the 
turmoil in Europe is dereliction of our 
duty to the American people and a be-
trayal of our responsibility to stand for 
freedom and support the world’s de-
mocracies. 
At a time like this, we need to be 
clear about our priorities. First, the 
United States must continue to work 
with our allies and partners to destroy 
the Russian economy and levy dev-
astating sanctions against the Russian 
oligarchy and Putin’s thugs and cro-
nies, both in and outside of the Krem-
lin. 
Second, the United States must sup-
ply Ukraine with every weapon needed 
and continue to work with our allies 
and partners to deliver resources to 
Ukraine’s military and the Ukrainian 
people. 
Third, we must prioritize and in-
crease our own defense spending to en-
sure maximum military readiness as 
we face both communist China and 
Putin’s aggression. Now is not the time 
for weakness or any compromise of 
America’s national defense capabili-
ties. 
Fourth, we must also immediately 
ban Russian aircraft from using Amer-
ican airspace. 
Fifth, the Biden administration must 
immediately roll back its failed Green 
New Deal policies and take action to 
boost U.S. energy production and inde-
pendence. They should restart the Key-
stone XL Pipeline and stop purchasing 
oil from Russia. 
Sixth, all lobbyists currently work-
ing with the Russian Government, Rus-
sian oligarchs, and other Russian inter-
ests should immediately cancel their 
contracts. The same goes for those rep-
resenting countries that refuse to con-
demn Russia’s invasion or are aiding 
Russia’s attempts to evade sanctions. 
It is inexcusable for any American to 
be lobbying on behalf of Putin’s evil re-
gime or those supporting it. 
Seventh, all State and local govern-
ments should take every action pos-
sible to end their relationship with 
Russian Federal and local governments 
and with Russian-owned businesses. A 
number of States and local govern-
ments have already taken this step, 
and we applaud their leadership. 
Finally, every American should take 
care to not purchase Russian-made 
products. Just like with communist 
China, buying products made in Russia 
will only fuel Putin’s war. One of the 
best tools America has at its disposal 
is our ability to destroy the Russian 
economy and inflict maximum pain on 
Putin and his oligarch thugs. 
Now is a time for all Americans to 
come together in defense of freedom 
and democracy, and the Senate must 
lead by example. 
That is why I am proud to work with 
my colleague from Idaho on the Never 
Yielding Europe’s Territory Act, or the 
NYET Act, to provide the critical sup-
port Ukraine needs to defend itself and 
deter Russian aggression, while impos-
ing real costs on the Kremlin for its 
ongoing aggression against Ukraine. 
The Senate should act immediately 
on this bill. American leadership is 
needed now more than ever, and taking 
these steps now is how we as a nation 
stand up against evil. Until this con-
flict is over, supporting Ukraine and 
making the horrific war as painful as 
possible for Putin and his evil regime 
must be our top focus. 
I yield the floor to Senator RISCH. 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, in 
closing, let me say, Ukrainians are 
dying. They are dying in a heroic fight; 
in a classic David versus Goliath fight. 
We can do something. We should do 
something. We have talked and talked; 
we have debated; and it is time to act. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Foreign Relations be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. 3652 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
First of all, let me agree with my Re-
publican colleagues. We stand in awe 
today of the Ukrainian people, of Presi-
dent Zelenskyy, of the Ukrainian mili-
tary. They have given the Russians 
more than they thought was coming. 
They have stood up a defense and are 
resistant. The world has watched with 
admiration, and the jury is, frankly, 
still out as to whether the Russians 
can make good on their plans, given 
how fierce the Ukrainians have fought. 
And I have been proud to stand with 
my colleagues on this floor as we have 
delivered additional aid to Ukraine, as 
we have made sure they have had the 
Javelins and the Stingers necessary to 
protect themselves. I have been proud 
to visit Ukraine with many of my col-
leagues here today, and we are going to 
continue to stand with the Ukrainian 
people. 
But I want to make two points today 
with respect to the effort that has been 
undertaken by my good friend, the 
ranking member of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. 
First, let me make a specific point on 
the merits of the bill that is being pro-
posed here today. 
Passing this bill with no committee 
process, no amendments, no debate 
would be a terrible idea. What this bill 
does, essentially, is to shatter Amer-
ican unity with Europe, with Japan, 
with South Korea, with all the allies 
that have stood with us over the course 
of this past week. 
President Biden spent the last 2 
months methodically building a never- 
before-seen coalition of nations to im-
pose the most significant set of sanc-
tions ever seen, and this bill would 
undo that. 
Why? Because this would mandate 
that the United States impose certain 
new sanctions over Europe’s objection. 
It calls for the United States to aban-
don our policy of focusing on multilat-
eral sanctions and start over with uni-
lateral sanctions. Why is that a ter-
rible idea? Well, first, because unilat-
eral sanctions just aren’t as effective 
as multilateral sanctions are. When 
you are talking about energy policy, 
you want the Europeans with you be-
cause that is where the Russian energy 
ends up. Without Europe, going at it 
alone, it makes the United States look 
weak, and the sanctions just aren’t as 
effective. 
But second, this bill is a bad idea be-
cause breaking with Europe and our 
NATO partners right now—that is ex-
actly what Vladimir Putin wants. Yes, 
he wants to control Ukraine, but what 
he wants more is to smash the trans-
atlantic alliance to pieces. He sees the 
invasion of Ukraine as a wedge that 
will cause America to squabble and 
break with our allies. Putin is setting 
a trap for us, and this bill would have 
us walk right into that trap. 
Third, let’s be clear. With a couple of 
small exceptions, President Biden has 
already done everything that this bill 
calls for and more. This bill calls for 
sanctions on those responsible for the 
buildup of forces around Ukraine. The 
administration has imposed sanctions 
on Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister 
Lavrov, 13 other members of Russia’s 
Security Council. 
This bill calls for sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2. Nord Stream 2 is done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S859 
March 1, 2022 
Thanks to the committed diplomatic 
efforts of the Biden administration, the 
German Government has put an end to 
Nord Stream 2, and we have applied the 
sanctions. 
This bill calls for sanctions on 
oligarchs. Biden did that with our al-
lies, and he went further. He launched 
a task force that is going to identify, 
freeze, and take from Russian oligarchs 
their assets. 
This bill calls for sanctions on finan-
cial institutions. The administration 
has already targeted all 10 of Russia’s 
largest financial institutions, which 
hold more than three-quarters of the 
Russian financial sector’s total assets. 
This bill calls for a prohibition on in-
vestment in occupied Ukrainian terri-
tory. President Biden did that on the 
first day of the war. 
This bill calls for sanctioning trans-
actions involving the Russian sov-
ereign debt. President Biden did that 
on the second day of the war. 
This bill calls for sanctions on 
Belarus. President Biden levied sanc-
tions on 24 Belarusian individuals, 2 
state-owned banks, and 13 of the coun-
try’s industries. 
President Biden has put together a 
sanctions package that is sweeping, 
that is unprecedented, that is breaking 
the back of the Russian economy. So 
why are we down here on the floor en-
gaged in this back-and-forth? 
And that brings me to my second 
point, a broader one. It used to be that 
the all-consuming politics of this town 
sometimes would take a break when 
the crisis was big enough. Sometimes 
they would stop at the water’s edge. 
This was the case in 2001 when this 
country was attacked. 
Republicans were in charge of the 
White House and both Houses of Con-
gress, and Democrats certainly had the 
choice to blame the attack on Presi-
dent Bush to try to score political 
points. Democrats could have come 
down to the floor to offer partisan 
bills. Democrats in the Senate could 
have used their minority prerogatives 
to 
block 
Bush’s 
national 
security 
nominees. 
But that is not what happened in 
2001. Democrats and Republicans came 
together because, at that moment, pa-
triotism, the love of your country, the 
defense of your country was more im-
portant than politics or party. 
Now, today, the shoe is on the other 
foot. Democrats control the White 
House, the House, and the Senate. And 
while our Nation wasn’t attacked last 
week, I would argue that this moment 
is the most perilous that the United 
States and the world has faced, cer-
tainly since 2001, but given the nuclear 
stakes involved in a conflict with Rus-
sia, perhaps the most perilous since the 
Cuban Missile Crisis. 
Now, I get it. The professional out-
rage machine that dominates American 
politics today has deluded a lot of folks 
in the Congress into believing that 
unity is weakness; that putting your 
country over party is an anachronism. 
But I don’t believe that. 
I believe that sometimes the stakes 
are so high that you have got to put 
aside your politics—at least tempo-
rarily—put aside your disagreements 
and get behind your government. 
Now, let’s be honest. As this crisis 
has grown in seriousness, over and over 
again Republicans have had the chance 
to do what Democrats did in 2001: ele-
vate loyalty to country. 
But all through 2021, even as Sen-
ators were made aware of Russia’s 
plans to invade Ukraine, Senators CRUZ 
and HAWLEY and a few others continued 
to put politics first by blocking every 
single national security nominee who 
came before this body, including those 
nominees who would have been work-
ing to try to help Ukraine and stop the 
Russian invasion. 
Last month, Republicans and Demo-
crats were working on a bipartisan bill 
to support Ukraine in its time of need. 
Those negotiations were difficult, but 
instead of staying at the table, Repub-
licans walked away with virtually no 
notice to Democrats and introduced 
this bill, with only Republicans sup-
porting it. 
And now, instead of rallying behind a 
President who has shocked the world 
by uniting friends and foes behind an 
unprecedented set of crippling sanc-
tions against Russia, Republicans are 
down here on the floor, not more than 
a week since the Russian invasion 
began, to highlight their grievances 
with the President’s policies. 
Russia invaded less than a week ago. 
We returned to Washington last night, 
and instead of deciding to sit down 
with Republicans today and work on 
agreeing on a package of support for 
Ukraine, like the one that President 
Biden has requested, Republicans have 
instead chosen to spend today, our first 
day back in the Senate since the inva-
sion, playing politics, trying to force a 
vote on a bill that they wrote, that not 
a single Democrat supports, that ev-
erybody knows is not going to pass, has 
no chance of passing. 
Now, we could do the same thing. 
Democrats could just put a bill on the 
floor that we all negotiated with our-
selves and force Republicans to vote on 
it. We could choose to use this week to 
highlight the differences between Re-
publicans and Democrats, but we are 
not going to do that because our pri-
ority is to try to work together with 
our 
Republican 
colleagues 
to 
find 
unity—unity—at this moment; to not 
use the first day that we are back in 
session since the invasion began to 
highlight the differences between our 
two parties. 
And, frankly, when I look at what 
Republicans 
have 
been 
calling 
on 
President Biden to do, I don’t see a lot 
of daylight. I don’t see a lot of reason 
for complaint. I don’t see the impera-
tive to come down here and highlight 
the differences. 
Nord Stream 2 is gone. It is not hap-
pening. SWIFT sanctions, previously 
opposed by Europe, are now happening. 
Russian banks are being crippled. As-
sets of Russian oligarchs are being 
seized. Vladimir Putin is being person-
ally sanctioned. Embargoes are being 
put on key technologies sent into Rus-
sia. 
The set of sanctions that President 
Biden announced—it goes further than 
what most all observers and pundits 
predicted. It is frankly stunning how 
successful President Biden’s diplomacy 
has been. 
And it just strains all credibility for 
Republicans to suddenly claim that 
this diplomacy is irrelevant and all 
these countries are going to impose 
these sanctions even if President Biden 
did nothing. 
I wish my colleagues could see the se-
riousness of this moment and the need 
for us to focus our energies on coming 
together instead of playing into our en-
emy’s hands and showing our dif-
ferences at this moment. 
Our President has rallied the world 
to this fight. Vladimir Putin is reeling, 
but we are forced to spend time today 
debating a partisan bill introduced by 
only one party that has no chance of 
passage because today on this floor 
scoring political points seems more im-
portant than finding a way to come to-
gether—to come together with the 
President, with both parties around 
our support for Ukraine. 
And for those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, in re-
buttal to my good friend’s comments, 
first of all, let me say that a number of 
the things I do take exception with— 
for instance, his statement that if we 
pass this we are going to somehow 
shatter the unanimity with which the 
world has come together to impose 
this. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. 
Certainly, the sanctions that we have 
put on have been in conjunction with a 
lot of our allies and a lot of our part-
ners. Simply putting on secondary 
sanctions—again, in conjunction with 
our allies and our partners—will not in 
any way shatter that at all. 
My good friend says, ‘‘Why are we 
here on the floor today?’’ 
Senator, I would say, the reason we 
are on the floor today is, it is not 
enough. 
Now, you said I came down here to 
criticize the President. I did not criti-
cize the President in anything I said. I 
applaud the action he has taken. I 
want him to take more. 
We have a convoy that is 40 miles 
long that is headed for Kyiv. Now, that 
convoy started out after all of these 
sanctions that the President put in 
place had taken effect. The banks, as 
you know, shut down—at least tempo-
rarily—in Russia. They closed their 
stock market. They have done a num-
ber of things, but it is not enough. We 
need to toughen up. 
As you know, I have talked and 
talked and talked with the administra-
tion to try to get them to embrace sec-
ondary sanctions because it is the sec-
ondary sanctions that are truly going

to shut the thing down lock, stock, and 
barrel; and Putin is going to have to 
answer to his people if we do get it 
shut down. 
Look, this is not partisan. I am not 
here to try to drive a wedge in the 
party. And as you know, your party 
had substantial input into the NYET 
Act that we have here. The chairman 
of the committee, I think, negotiated 
in good faith as we put this together. I 
have told him that personally. I have 
said that publicly. 
The fact is, we came very close to the 
bill, and the NYET bill is very close to 
what we agreed to, but we couldn’t 
come together on the last few things; 
and that is, a permanent shutdown of 
Nord Stream 2—not just the sanctions 
that are in place on a temporary basis, 
but a permanent shutdown—and on 
secondary sanctions, which we believe 
will be the final nail in the coffin for 
the economy in Russia. 
So, again, I answer the question 
asked: Why are we here? We are here 
because it is not enough. The convoys 
are continuing. There are tens of thou-
sands of more Russian soldiers that are 
entering Ukraine. They are having a 
tough, tough time of it. 
I agree with Senator TOOMEY. You 
know, you sit here, and you see what is 
going on. The question you have to ask 
is: How long can the Ukrainians hold 
out? We want them to hold out. 
There are provisions in this act, as 
you know, that provide additional help 
for the Ukrainians themselves. But 
most importantly, what it will do is it 
will flat shut down the economy in 
Russia. 
In addition to that, you and I dis-
cussed, I think, the fact that we can 
never use sanctions in a manner where 
we or our allies get hurt worse than the 
enemy does or, for that matter, to any 
great extent. That is why there are 
waivers in here. And sanctions always 
have waiver provisions in them so that 
it can take the edge off on anything 
that causes us or our allies any dif-
ficulties. So in that regard, I think 
that you are wrong on that. 
Back to the basic bill: I said I am an 
all-of-the-above person. If the Demo-
crats want to bring their bill down, it 
will probably look very much like this, 
but it won’t have secondary sanctions 
in it, it won’t have a permanent closing 
of Nord Stream 1 and 2. I will stand up 
here and say, We can do better, but I 
am still going to vote for your bill, and 
I wish you would do that on mine. But 
I would respectfully request that you 
back away from this complaint that 
this is a partisan exercise. It is not a 
partisan exercise. 
There isn’t a person in this body that 
doesn’t want to do all we can possibly 
do to preserve the lives of the Ukrain-
ians that are perishing every day— 
women, children, civilians. We need to 
do all that we can, and Putin is not 
going to be deterred until we do all 
that we can, and that comes to perma-
nently shutting down—excuse me, to 
completely shutting down the economy 
in Russia. This bill does that. 
Again, I apologize if you think there 
is anything political about this. It is 
not. It is trying to do the right thing, 
as you and I have talked about. We 
have an obligation to do this as Ameri-
cans, as the strongest country in the 
world. We can’t stand by and watch 
this slaughter that is happening, and 
when that convoy gets there, it is 
going to be even worse. 
This is something we can actually do 
to do more than what the President has 
done. 
And I will say it—I said it before and 
I will say it again. I commend the 
President for what he has done. But we 
also, as the first branch of government, 
have a responsibility. We believe this 
bill exercises that responsibility. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 819 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
Russia continues to engage in ruthless 
and unprovoked attacks against the 
democratic and independent nation of 
Ukraine. I strongly condemn Russia’s 
dangerous aggression against the peo-
ple of Ukraine. Putin is responsible for 
the death and destruction in his wake, 
and he must be held accountable. 
The one sledgehammer that we can 
use against Putin is American energy 
resources. Reducing the amount of 
Russian energy going to Europe would 
hurt Russia’s economy. The oil and gas 
revenues made up about 36 percent of 
Russia’s national budget last year. In 
2021, Russia sold $100 billion worth of 
oil and natural gas to Europe. 
Russia is Europe’s main supplier of 
energy. The European Union received 
over 40 percent of its gas imports from 
Russia. Russia also has significant 
ownership in Europe’s energy infra-
structure, including pipelines, distribu-
tion centers, and storage facilities. 
With natural gas prices increasing 
and oil surpassing $100 a barrel, more 
of our allies’ money will be lining the 
pockets of Vladimir Putin. Due to high 
energy costs, Russian oil and gas reve-
nues exceed initial plans by 5 percent 
this past year, totaling $119 billion. In 
2021, revenues from Russian oil and gas 
were almost $500 million each and 
every day. It is a windfall for Vladimir 
Putin. As a result, the amount of Rus-
sian energy going to Europe is a major 
problem. 
We must help our allies escape Rus-
sia’s energy trap. American energy re-
sources can allow Europeans to meet 
their energy needs and deprive Russia 
of the revenue it uses to fund its mili-
tary aggression. Due to technological 
advances and an abundance of natural 
gas, the United States can be a stra-
tegic energy supplier to Europe. Our 
Nation has more than enough gas to 
meet America’s needs and to export to 
other countries. We must speed up the 
process of getting American liquefied 
natural gas to our allies. 
That is why I introduced S. 819, the 
Energy Security Cooperation with Al-
lied Partners in Europe Act, commonly 
known as the ESCAPE Act. It cur-
rently has 23 sponsors. The bill, as 
amended, does three things: It deems it 
in the public interest to export U.S. 
liquefied natural gas to NATO coun-
tries and defense allies. It creates a 
transatlantic energy security strategy 
focused on increasing American energy 
exports directly to Europe. And it di-
rects our NATO representative to help 
our allies and partners improve that 
energy security. 
So, Madam President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 819 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. I further ask that the Bar-
rasso amendment at the desk be con-
sidered and agreed to; that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. First, very 
quickly, let me make a few final points 
about Senator RISCH’s comments. 
Senator RISCH says that this isn’t a 
partisan exercise. It is. The bill that 
Senator RISCH is talking about was in-
troduced by only Republicans. It was 
introduced with no notice to Demo-
crats. There was a big showy press con-
ference in which only Republicans were 
there. In fact, the introduction of this 
bill was a messaging point for Repub-
licans to announce that they were no 
longer negotiating with Democrats. 
And so I appreciate that Senator 
RISCH often is working very industri-
ously with Democrats, but in this case, 
it is a partisan bill. Only Republicans 
support it. 
And offering it today is not helpful to 
the process because it had no chance of 
passage. Instead, today, we should be 
working on getting additional funding 
to the Ukrainians. 
President Biden has requested our 
help, has requested Congress to step up 
and provide humanitarian assistance 
and more lethal assistance to Ukraine. 
Right now, with the time that we are 
spending arguing over a bill that is 
supported only by Republicans that is 
never going to pass this body, we could 
be using that time to come together 
around a bill that can pass, that will 
pass. 
So that is why there is anger on our 
side about this exercise. There are 
these moments in American history 
and world history where our focus 
should be on unity, where our focus 
should be on coming together and find-
ing what we can do together; and, in-
stead, the piece of legislation that was 
just offered was a bill that was specifi-
cally introduced to highlight the Re-
publican position in contrast to the 
Biden administration. 
As for Senator BARRASSO’s bill, it 
suffers from the same problem, which 
is it separates us from Europe. It sepa-
rates us from our allies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S861 
March 1, 2022 
There is a lot of wisdom on the Re-
publican side of the aisle, but it mys-
tifies me why so many of my friends 
who know so much about Russia don’t 
understand that Putin’s primary objec-
tive is to break NATO into pieces, is to 
smash the European Union, is to create 
tensions and fissures within the trans-
atlantic alliance, right? 
Putin sees the greatest catastrophe 
of the last 100 years as the breakup of 
the Soviet Union, and he blames the 
United States and the West for that 
breakup. So, while the invasion of 
Ukraine is part of his process of rem-
edying that grievance, the real crown— 
the real cherry on top for Vladimir 
Putin—is 
the 
splintering 
apart 
of 
NATO and the United States from Eu-
rope. Now, we almost got there during 
the Trump administration. Relations 
were never worse; threats of pulling 
out of NATO or refusing to honor our 
article 5 obligations. 
I would argue that this invasion is 
happening in part because the Biden 
administration made clear that there 
wasn’t going to be a natural disintegra-
tion of the transatlantic alliance, and 
so Vladimir Putin is using this inva-
sion of Ukraine, first and foremost, to 
get control of the territory he wants 
but also to try to split us from each 
other. And our fear is that bills like 
this essentially step into the trap that 
Vladimir Putin has laid for us because 
secondary sanctions on European enti-
ties against the wishes of European 
governments splits us from each other. 
Had Joe Biden gone this route, you 
would have never had the Europeans 
working with us on swift sanctions. 
You would have never had the Euro-
peans working with us on the seizure of 
Russian assets. 
But because Joe Biden made the wise 
decision to do these sanctions in con-
cert with Europe, we got more than we 
could have ever imagined. And this bill 
would walk us backwards, undo that 
unity with our colleagues. 
It may be that there will be a mo-
ment in time where we can convince 
our European colleagues to move with 
us on sanctions against certain ele-
ments of Russia’s energy economy, but 
we must do that together. We have to 
do that together because you need to 
understand what Putin’s larger game 
is. It is the breakup of the trans-
atlantic alliance. 
I wish my colleagues were on the 
floor today, celebrating—celebrating 
what President Biden has done. Nobody 
thought that he could keep the alli-
ance, that he could keep us together 
with Europe, that he could get Europe 
to agree to what they have already 
agreed to. I wish we were rallying be-
hind our President right now. 
I get it that there are always dif-
ferences between the Republicans and a 
Democratic President, but, boy, this 
would be a great moment for us to be 
on the floor, supporting the break-
through 
that 
President 
Biden 
has 
achieved on crippling sanctions against 
Russia and spending this day working 
together to try to deliver billions of 
dollars in additional aid to Ukraine. In-
stead, we are engaged in a partisan 
squabble over bills that have no chance 
of passing, that are literally just as 
valuable as the pieces of paper that the 
press releases from the Republicans 
will be written on. 
I hope that we can get beyond today 
and get down to work on serious busi-
ness—the serious business of coming 
together, Republicans and Democrats, 
and providing Ukraine the assistance 
they need, in a bipartisan way, through 
a package of support that can be sup-
ported by both parties and signed by 
this President. 
For that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
just to point out, Members are clearly 
entitled to their own opinions, but 
they are not entitled to their own 
facts. 
The facts of the matter are that this 
bill that I have at the desk right now 
includes no sanctions, none whatso-
ever—none, zero. 
This bill that we have at the desk is 
something that our European allies 
have asked for. It is not to divide them 
or us. They have asked for this to help 
them divide away from Putin. They 
need the energy; they need the lique-
fied natural gas. Some of the countries 
have built or are building what are 
called gasifiers so they can turn the 
liquefied natural gas, which comes in 
at a very low temperature, and turn it 
into gas that they can use for energy so 
they don’t have to buy it and be held 
hostage by Vladimir Putin. 
This is a bill that has previously got-
ten bipartisan support, in this very 
body, with Members of both sides of 
the aisle supporting efforts to help our 
European allies—our NATO friends— 
break the dependence from Russian en-
ergy. Those are the facts of the matter. 
People are entitled to their opinions. 
These are the facts. 
Russia’s actions against Ukraine em-
phasize just how important it is for na-
tions—and specifically for America—to 
be energy independent. 
Under the previous administration, 
America was energy dominant. We be-
came the world’s largest producer of oil 
and gas. It was the first time we had 
been energy independent in nearly 70 
years; yet this administration has re-
versed course. It has made it harder for 
us to use American energy, and that 
has empowered and emboldened Vladi-
mir Putin. We have moved from energy 
dominance to energy dependence. We 
have American energy in the ground 
that this administration won’t let us 
get out of the ground. We have energy 
resources that would help lower the 
cost and help lower the pain at the 
pump that the American public is liv-
ing with. It would help break the de-
pendence of our European allies and 
the people of Ukraine from Vladimir 
Putin. 
We were much better off as a nation 
when selling energy to our friends than 
having to buy it from our enemies. We 
need to expand our energy production 
to bring down prices for working fami-
lies in this country whose paychecks 
can’t keep up with the inflation, and 
we need to sell it to our allies so they 
can 
remove 
themselves 
from 
the 
clutches of Vladimir Putin. 
Freeing Europe from Russian energy 
dependence is going to strengthen both 
our allies and our NATO alliances. We 
must provide American energy re-
sources to those countries as quickly 
as possible. They are asking for it; they 
want it; they need it. It strengthens 
our national security and takes money 
directly out of Vladimir Putin’s pock-
ets. 
It is this administration’s energy 
policies that have driven up the cost of 
energy and driven down the production 
of American energy, which is what has 
provided a jackpot for Vladimir Putin 
to fund his war machine. Energy secu-
rity is a critical part of our shared de-
fense. There is a national security 
problem for the United States when 
our allies are more and more dependent 
on Russian gas. 
The world knows Vladimir Putin uses 
energy as a weapon. Energy is called 
the master resource for a reason. It 
powers our country—our economy, our 
military. It powers the world. Vladimir 
Putin uses his energy as a weapon to 
intimidate, to influence, and to coerce 
other nations. Energy funds Vladimir 
Putin’s aggression, and it has been the 
cash cow for his invasion of Ukraine. 
Look, we have abundant natural gas 
supplies. My home State of Wyoming 
has amazing energy resources. We just 
need to be allowed to produce it. Eu-
rope’s reliance on Russian gas under-
mines our national security. Our na-
tional security is increased by reducing 
the leverage that Russia holds over our 
allies. 
It is time for Congress to provide our

150TH ANNIVERSARY OF YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL 
PARK 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to highlight 
the 150th anniversary of Yellowstone 
National Park. 
When it was established on this date 
150 years ago, Yellowstone was the first 
national park in the world. Today, it is 
still one of the most popular parks on 
Earth. One-hundred-fifty years ago, it 
was a new idea to set aside public land 
for public enjoyment. With the estab-
lishment of Yellowstone, Congress set 
the gold standard. 
Based on Yellowstone’s success over 
the past century and a half, hundreds 
of additional national parks have been 
created for Americans to enjoy. Many

other countries have followed our lead 
and have established their own na-
tional parks. 
Yellowstone spans over 2 million 
acres throughout Wyoming, as well as 
parts of Montana and Idaho. That is 
more land than the entire State of 
Rhode Island and Delaware combined. 
Yellowstone’s vast and varied land-
scapes provide some of the most spec-
tacular views in the world, and this is 
just one of them. Cascading waterfalls, 
steaming geysers, and gaping canyons 
often leave visitors speechless. Many 
generations of Americans have enjoyed 
these same views. 
That is what Congress intended 150 
years ago when it established the park, 
as they said, for the benefit and enjoy-
ment of the people. Millions of people 
come from all across the world to expe-
rience the park’s beauty. From hiking 
and biking, to boating and wildlife 
viewing, Yellowstone offers some of the 
best outdoor recreation opportunities 
all around the world. 
It also has iconic natural wonders 
like Old Faithful, the Grand Canyon of 
the 
Yellowstone, 
and 
Yellowstone 
Lake. It has 25 square miles of gey-
sers—over half of the total number of 
geysers in the world. The Greater Yel-
lowstone Ecosystem, of which the park 
is a part, is one of the largest and most 
intact natural ecosystems in the world. 
Yellowstone also has the greatest 
concentration of mammals among na-
tional parks in the lower 48 States. The 
bison in Yellowstone are part of Amer-
ica’s largest and oldest free-range herd. 
Today, we carry on a tradition at 
Yellowstone that goes back not just 150 
years but over 11,000 years. For thou-
sands of years, Native Americans have 
hunted, fished, and used the thermal 
waters for medicinal purposes. 
The people of Wyoming are rightly 
proud of the culture, as well as its his-
tory. Today, the park supports thou-
sands of jobs in Wyoming and Montana 
and Idaho. It contributes greatly to 
local economies. 
Cam Sholly, the superintendent of 
Yellowstone, is doing an incredible job. 
A third-generation Park Service em-
ployee, Cam goes above and beyond the 
call of duty to ensure the park delivers 
a world-class experience to everyone 
who visits. Under his leadership, the 
park has hosted record numbers of visi-
tors. During the height of the COVID 
pandemic, when the only place to go 
was outside, Yellowstone set the stand-
ard on how parks should operate. 
Health, safety, security, and public ac-
cess were always a priority. 
I am very grateful for the dedicated 
leaders and staff at Yellowstone who 
made it possible for people to visit and 
enjoy this international landmark. 
Recently, the Senate passed my bi-
partisan resolution to honor Yellow-
stone on this historic day. This resolu-
tion celebrates the park’s 150 years of 
unique cultural heritage and natural 
beauty. 
It 
also 
encourages 
people 
across America and around the world 
to visit Yellowstone to experience its 
extraordinary treasures. 
I am proud to celebrate Yellowstone 
with my colleagues in the Senate, 
along with Senator LUMMIS, who is my 
colleague from Wyoming, as we cele-
brate with the people of Wyoming and 
with all Americans on this historic 
day. 
Congratulations to all of the people 
of Wyoming who work to keep Yellow-
stone one of our Nation’s greatest 
treasures. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM’S BOARD OF 
GOVERNORS NOMINATIONS 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise 
in support of the swift consideration of 
President Biden’s five nominees to the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve System. 
Over the last year, our economy has 
improved 
tremendously, 
thanks 
to 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure 
law, and we have been guided along the 
way by steady leadership at the Fed. 
We are seeing positive results. 
Last year, GDP grew by 5.7 percent, 
and we gained over 6.6 million jobs. In 
each month during the second half of 
last year, the family tax credit in the 
American Rescue Plan pulled approxi-
mately 3.5 million children out of pov-
erty; unemployment claims are at a 50- 
year low; the unemployment rate is at 
4 percent; and nominal wages are rising 
at the fastest pace in decades. 
We have also begun investing $1.2 
trillion from the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture law that will help businesses and 
the economy in the decades ahead and 
will provide an extraordinary number 
of jobs. 
We are not yet out of the woods from 
the pandemic, and there are critical 
economic challenges we need to ad-
dress, including inflation, the lack of 
affordable housing, the high cost of 
prescription drugs, the need for afford-
able childcare, and others. The Fed 
plays a pivotal role in making sure our 
economy grows on an even keel so that 
we can meet these challenges and re-
main the world’s leader. 
I might add also that this is a very, 
very difficult time for the world econ-
omy as we respond to the illegal attack 
by Putin on Ukraine. The world, under 
the leadership of President Biden and 
the United States, has imposed unprec-
edented sanctions. It is in this volatile 
moment that the Fed also will play a 
critical role. 
Unfortunately, Republican partisan 
brinkmanship is now preventing us 
from having a fully staffed and func-
tioning Fed, just as Republicans have 
stymied nominations of qualified indi-
viduals to serve at key posts in the De-
fense Department, in the State Depart-
ment, and in several other Agencies. 
I would note that, at times, we are 
being forced to break filibusters on 
nominations that eventually pass with 
70, 80, or 90 ‘‘yes’’ votes. Perhaps my 
colleagues think that these tactics are 
somehow politically beneficial, but the 
fact is that these tactics diminish and 
degrade the ability of the Federal Gov-
ernment to serve the American people. 
And so we come to the Federal Re-
serve. The seven-member Board is 
technically operating with four of its 
seven members today, and two of those 
are in confirmation limbo. 
Jerome Powell, who has been nomi-
nated for a second term as Chair, is 
serving 
on 
an 
acting 
basis. 
Lael 
Brainard is a Governor and is also the 
pending nominee for Vice Chair. There 
is no Vice Chair for Supervision, and 
two ordinary Governor seats are va-
cant. 
The President has nominated a slate 
of five qualified, bipartisan candidates 
to fill these positions, including Mr. 
Powell. 
Mr. Powell was first appointed Fed 
Chair by Donald Trump and has served 
admirably for the last 4 years. Lael 
Brainard was confirmed to her current 
position on the Federal Reserve Board 
with strong bipartisan support. Sarah 
Bloom Raskin is a former Governor 
and has been nominated as Vice Chair 
for Supervision. The Senate confirmed 
Ms. Raskin to the Federal Reserve 
Board a decade ago by voice vote and 
as Deputy Treasury Secretary on a bi-
partisan vote. Lisa Cook and Phil Jef-
ferson are mainstream academic econo-
mists who have been nominated as 
Governors. 
Earlier this year, the Banking Com-
mittee held hearings on these nomi-
nees. They demonstrated their quali-
fications and responded to hundreds of 
questions. They have met with Sen-
ators on the committee individually as 
well. But on February 15, my Repub-
lican colleagues blocked the Banking 
Committee from voting on these nomi-
nations. They didn’t show up and vote 
no on the nominees whom they op-
posed; they just didn’t show up. They 
decided to skip the meeting precisely 
to keep the committee from moving 
these nominees to the full Senate. 
They have taken this step during a 
pandemic, a bout of inflation, and a 
growing, violent conflict in Europe. At 
a time when the Federal Reserve’s job 
has never been more important, our 
Republican colleagues have chosen to 
stall the confirmations of qualified 
nominees to help lead our economy. 
The Federal Reserve’s monetary pol-
icy decisions are made by the Federal 
Open Market Committee, also known 
as the FOMC. The FOMC has 12 voting 
members, including all seven Gov-
ernors on the Board in Washington. 
The others are presidents of the re-
gional Reserve banks. Due to the Re-
publican boycott, the FOMC is now op-
erating with only nine members—four 
Governors and five Reserve bank presi-
dents. 
The FOMC’s primary job is to estab-
lish interest rate targets and authorize 
open market operations to achieve 
those targets. This function makes it 
the most important economic policy-
making body in the world. 
The FOMC now faces enormous chal-
lenges to bring prices under control

without harming the strong economic 
recovery. Supply chain disruptions and 
the pandemic have pushed inflation up. 
Russia’s 
unprovoked 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine, which many economists ex-
pect to make supply shortages much 
worse and cause energy prices to rise, 
creates huge risks for the global econ-
omy. 
These economic challenges collec-
tively demand a fully staffed FOMC. 
Indeed, one of the FOMC’s biggest 
strengths is its ability to inspire con-
fidence in the United States and in the 
world. It is able to do this because it 
typically works by consensus—con-
sensus that reflects the view of its 12 
expert members. But when the FOMC 
doesn’t have its full complement of 
members and when members are serv-
ing in an acting capacity, it doesn’t 
speak with the same authority. At a 
moment when there is so much turmoil 
in the domestic and global economies, 
it is reckless to deny the FOMC its full 
membership. 
My Republican colleagues have spent 
plenty of time talking about inflation 
without offering solutions. Now, when 
presented with a chance to empower 
the FOMC to combat higher prices, my 
Republican colleagues have instead 
chosen to handcuff it. 
By weakening the FOMC, Senate Re-
publicans are increasing the odds of a 
mistake. That makes it more likely for 
higher prices to persist, and this out-
come is unacceptable when millions of 
Americans are struggling to cover in-
creased costs for everyday expenses. 
The American people should not need 
to bear any further economic hard-
ships, however slight, that could result 
from Republicans continuing to block 
these nominees. 
Blocking these nominees also robs 
Congress and the public of an impor-
tant mechanism to hold the FOMC ac-
countable for its decisions. My Repub-
lican colleagues say they are com-
mitted to accountability, but their 
blockade is ensuring that the five Re-
serve bank presidents, who answer to 
the Nation’s commercial banks and are 
not confirmed by the Senate, are a ma-
jority on the FOMC. That means these 
five 
non-Senate-confirmed 
officials 
predominate when it comes to interest 
rate decisions. 
Congress promised the American peo-
ple an FOMC led by members who ex-
clusively serve their interests. I urge 
my Republican colleagues to deliver on 
that promise. 
If the Federal Reserve fails to deliver 
maximum 
employment 
and 
stable 
prices, the American people will ques-
tion why. 
Reasonable minds can differ about 
whether the FOMC ultimately raises 
interest rates too much, too little, or 
just enough. Economists are sure to de-
bate that question in the years to 
come. But one obvious conclusion will 
be that the FOMC lacked a full com-
plement of members to support the dif-
ficult decisions that it will make this 
year. 
That 
conclusion 
will 
spread 
doubts about the integrity of the Fed-
eral Reserve and its policies. If those 
doubts take root, it will be harder for 
our Nation’s central bank to support 
the economy. 
In these rather uncertain economic 
times, the American people need more 
certainty, not less, and they need an 
FOMC that is accountable to them. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
allow the Senate to vote on these high-
ly qualified nominees. 
With that, I yield the floor.

ator from Illinois. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
evening, the Ukrainian Ambassador, 
Oksana Markarova, will be the honored 
guest of President Biden in the State of 
the 
Union 
Address. 
Yesterday, 
we 
hosted the Ambassador for a meeting 
with almost 25 Senate colleagues. It 
was a meeting I won’t soon forget. 
Her country, Ukraine, is facing a bar-
baric, 
unprovoked 
military 
assault 
from Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. 
The images and the stories are heart-
breaking and infuriating—more than 
600,000 Ukrainians fleeing to neigh-
boring countries; brutal destruction, 
leaving people without homes or power 
during the winter; and Russian shelling 
of residential neighborhoods. We are 
witnessing 
innocent 
lives 
callously 
taken and uprooted. 
This is a photo from yesterday’s 
Washington Post. It shows a paramedic 
in Ukraine desperately trying to save 
this man’s young daughter. She had 
been a victim of Vladimir Putin’s 
shelling in her country of Ukraine. She 
did not survive. 
Why is Putin doing this? Because his 
own petty grievances and warped nos-
talgia for the dark days of the Soviet 
Union have taken control. In his twist-
ed mind, an entire innocent nation of 
44 million Ukrainians must be attacked 
and occupied at any cost. 
There is another reason he is trying 
to end Ukraine as we know it. He can-
not bear to have a free and independent 
nation on his border because it shows 
to the people living in Russia the stark 
contrast of democracy versus despotic 
rule. 
This morning, the Human Rights 
Council in Geneva met. When Russia’s 
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov began 
his speech, 100 diplomats all rose and 
walked out in protest of Russia’s war 
on Ukraine. All of NATO and nearly 
the entire world are united in outrage 
at Russia’s aggression. 
Mr. Putin should think about the in-
famy of his legacy. For years, he has 
poisoned and suppressed his own peo-
ple. Now he is trying to destroy an en-
tire nation, killing this little girl and 
who knows how many other innocent 
people. Mr. Putin will not win this war. 
And every day, every hour that Russia 
continues its assault on Ukraine, he is 
harming his own people and ensuring 
that he leaves a legacy of shame. 
What is also remarkable about the 
meeting yesterday with Ambassador 
Markarova was the determination and 
courage she and her fellow Ukrainians 
are showing against Putin. She ex-
plained to us that Ukrainians are 
peaceful people, but they will fight. 
They will participate in the negotia-
tions, but they won’t surrender. And 
they will fight until the Russians 
leave. Quite simply, the Ukrainians 
might be outmatched by the Russian 
military, but they will not be defeated 
by it. 
Here is one of the many acts of cour-
age and defiance in recent days. In 
Odessa’s historic Brodsky Synagogue, 
performers sang a moving 19th century 
version of the ancient Jewish hymn 
‘‘Adon Olam’’—now a prayer for an end 
to the invasion. 
And the world is on Ukraine’s side— 
with rallies of support in all corners of 
the globe, Japan, Sweden, Finland, Chi-
cago, even in cities across Russia. 
Countries like ours are providing ur-
gently needed weapons to help Ukraine 
defend itself against Russian aggres-
sion. 
Poland and other Ukrainian neigh-
bors are helping with hundreds of thou-
sands of refugees fleeing in panic and 
disbelief. Think of it. While we have 
political factions in the United States 
who are determined not to let any refu-
gees into our country, Poland and 
other 
countries—Moldova, 
Romania, 
for example—are opening their doors 
and accepting the Ukrainian refugees 
to give them some safety and security. 
We must continue and increase all of 
the help that we can send—military 
and humanitarian. Let us be crystal 
clear: Putin will not win this. In the 
end, the Ukrainian people will prevail. 
And Putin’s legacy and history will be 
written in the blood of the children and 
innocents his invasion of Ukraine has 
spilled. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. President, yesterday, I spoke 
briefly about President Biden’s an-
nouncement on Friday of his nomina-
tion to the Supreme Court of Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson. Today, I would 
like to offer some additional thoughts 
on this nominee. 
For those who are less than familiar 
with Judge Jackson, let me tell you a 
bit about her. Born in Washington, DC, 
her mom and dad were public school 
teachers. When she was 3 years old, 
Judge Jackson and her family moved 
to Miami, FL, so her father could at-
tend law school. 
Judge Jackson’s father later served 
as the top attorney for the Dade Coun-
ty School Board, and her mother spent 
14 years as a high school principal in 
Miami. In Judge Jackson’s family, edu-
cation and service were honored. 
Two of Judge Jackson’s uncles were 
police officers. One became police chief 
in Miami. Her younger brother also be-
came a police officer and a detective in 
Baltimore, MD, before going on to 
serve in the U.S. Army where he was 
deployed to Iraq. 
From a young age, Judge Jackson 
has been recognized as brilliant and

March 1, 2022 
thoughtful. In high school, she was the 
class president and the star of the de-
bate team. 
It was during a national high school 
debate championship at Harvard that 
she fell in love with the university. She 
would go on to graduate from Harvard 
College and Harvard Law School. 
She then embarked on an amazing 
and storied career. She practiced law, 
civil and criminal, at several leading 
law firms and clerked at all three lev-
els of the Federal judiciary, includ-
ing—and with some irony—for Justice 
Stephen Breyer, the Justice she hopes 
to replace. 
She has also worked as a Federal 
public defender, served on the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission, spent 8 years as a 
judge on the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Columbia. She currently 
serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the DC Circuit, which is often consid-
ered to be the second most prestigious 
court in our Nation. She was confirmed 
to that position just last year through 
our Senate Judiciary Committee on a 
bipartisan basis. 
As I noted yesterday, the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee has examined her 
record three times for three different 
positions and confirmed her on a bipar-
tisan basis for all three positions. 
She has performed each of these pub-
lic service roles with distinction. In the 
coming weeks, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee 
will 
undertake 
another 
comprehensive review of her record, 
her qualifications, and her approach to 
judicial decision making. As chair of 
the committee, I am determined to see 
that this review is careful, fair, and 
professional. 
I have great respect for her record, 
and I will be saying more in the coming 
days and weeks. For today, I want to 
focus on three important points: the 
President’s selection process, the his-
toric significance of this nomination, 
and how Judge Jackson will build upon 
the honorable legacy of Justice Breyer. 
President Joe Biden is a leader who 
respects the Senate. When Justice 
Breyer announced a month ago that he 
intended to retire, President Biden 
pledged ‘‘to fulfill my duty to select a 
justice not only with the Senate’s con-
sent, but with its advice.’’ 
The President kept that promise; and 
for that, he should be commended. The 
process 
for 
nominating 
Justice 
Breyer’s successor has been rigorous 
and bipartisan. It has included the Sen-
ate every step of the way. 
Just days after Justice Breyer’s an-
nouncement, the President hosted Sen-
ator GRASSLEY—the ranking Repub-
lican on this committee—and myself in 
the Oval Office to discuss the nomina-
tion. Repeatedly, he said to Senator 
GRASSLEY
and to me, ‘‘If you have 
someone you think I should consider, 
please let me know.’’ And he was sin-
cere. 
Over the next several weeks, Presi-
dent Biden sought the advice of many 
Senators—not just the two of us—in-
cluding all the members, Democratic 
members of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, then he made this decision to 
nominate Judge Jackson. 
Every Supreme Court nomination is 
critically important, but this one has 
special historic significance. In the 
United States history, our Supreme 
Court has had 115 Justices; 108 of those 
Justices have had one thing in com-
mon. They were all White men. 
Five of those who served on the 
Court as Justices were women. Only 
three have been people of color, out of 
115. With Judge Jackson’s nomination, 
we have already seen history in the 
making. If confirmed, she will be the 
first Black woman ever to serve on the 
U.S. Supreme Court. With this nomina-
tion, Judge Jackson and we have the 
opportunity to bend the arc of history 
toward justice. 
In accepting President Biden’s nomi-
nation last week, she said one of her 
heroes, another brilliant, trailblazing 
Black woman, was named Constance 
Baker Motley. Judge Motley was a 
champion of civil rights and women’s 
rights, a key attorney on Thurgood 
Marshall’s side when the NAACP Legal 
Defense and Education Fund argued 
Brown v. Board of Education and other 
cases which finally ended legal seg-
regation in America. 
Judge Motley was the first Black 
woman to ever argue before the Su-
preme Court. She went on to be the 
first Black woman appointed to the 
Federal judiciary, serving as a U.S. 
District Judge for the Southern Dis-
trict of New York. 
Judge Motley didn’t know it, but on 
her 48th birthday, a little baby girl was 
born in Washington, DC. She would 
grow up to be one of the finest legal 
minds of her generation, and she would 
be the first Black woman to be nomi-
nated to serve on the Supreme Court. 
Upon accepting that nomination last 
week, Judge Jackson said: ‘‘Today, I 
proudly stand on Judge Motley’s shoul-
ders, sharing not only her birthday, but 
also her steadfast and courageous com-
mitment to equal justice under law.’’ 
And then she added: ‘‘If I’m fortunate 
enough to be confirmed as the next As-
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court, I 
can only hope that my life and career, 
my love of this country and the Con-
stitution, and my commitment to up-
holding the rule of law and the sacred 
principles upon which this great nation 
was founded will inspire future genera-
tions.’’ 
I want to conclude my remarks by 
acknowledging the extraordinary leg-
acy of Justice Stephen Breyer. It is a 
legacy upon which I believe Justice 
Jackson will build if she is confirmed. 
In his time on the Court, Justice 
Breyer has been defined by his rigorous 
intellect, his thoughtful, pragmatic ap-
proach to judicial decision making, his 
collegiality and consensus building, 
and his devotion to the core principles 
on which America is founded—freedom, 
liberty, and equality. 
By all these measures and more, 
Judge Jackson is a natural successor 
to the Justice she once clerked for. She 
has proven her intellectual mettle— 
from the debate team in high school in 
Miami, to Harvard Law where she 
served as supervising editor of the Har-
vard Law Review, to clerkships on the 
District of Massachusetts, the First 
Circuit, and the Supreme Court, and to 
an extraordinary record of excellence 
on the Federal bench. 
It goes without saying that if you are 
going to be the first of anything in 
America, you have got to be the best. 
You have got to bring remarkable 
achievements to your aspiration to 
make history. Judge Jackson does 
that. 
She is a jurist who understands the 
importance of pragmatism and real- 
world experience. She will draw on her 
broad range of experience on the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission, as a Federal 
public defender, as a litigator in civil 
lawsuits in private practice. Judge 
Jackson has also demonstrated the pre-
mium she places on collegiality and 
consensus-building, 
especially 
with 
those who may not share her views. 
That may be unusual, but it sure is im-
portant in these days. 
Judge Thomas Griffith, a conserv-
ative jurist appointed to the DC Circuit 
by President George W. Bush, wrote in 
support of Judge Jackson’s nomination 
to the DC Circuit, and he has written 
again in support of her nomination to 
the Supreme Court. 
Judge Griffith wrote: ‘‘Judge Jack-
son and I occasionally differed on the 
best outcome of a given case . . . . 
However, I have always respected her 
careful approach, extraordinary judi-
cial understanding, and collegial man-
ner, three indispensable traits for suc-
cess on the Supreme Court. 
He added: ‘‘Judge Jackson has a dem-
onstrated record of excellence, and I 
believe, based on her work as a trial 
judge when I served on the Court of Ap-
peals, she’ll adjudicate based on the 
facts and the law and not as a par-
tisan.’’ 
Finally, like Justice Breyer, Judge 
Jackson has shown her dedication to 
the Nation’s founding principles, on 
and off the bench. She has a deep faith 
in the power and promise of our Con-
stitution and an unwavering belief that 
we must protect and preserve those 
ideals that set our Nation apart from 
so many others. 
Last Friday, when President Biden 
nominated Judge Jackson, the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, we sent the tra-
ditional questionnaire that is sent to 
nominees and candidates. It was re-
turned to us last night promptly. It 
was lengthy and comprehensive. We 
have seen much of it before, earlier last 
year when Judge Jackson was aspiring 
to be on the DC Circuit. And it is a 
great starting point for any Senator or 
any member of the staff who wants to 
understand Judge Jackson. 
She has published over 500—in fact, 
573—written opinions. Her background 
and thoughts on important issues will 
be no mystery or surprise for those who

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

March 1, 2022 
want to take the time to look at those 
cases. It has been less than a year since 
she was approved here on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate, but we are starting 
this process anew with her visitations 
with 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, 
Senator 
SCHUMER tomorrow, as well as myself 
and Senator GRASSLEY. 
Senators who wish to meet with her 
personally and talk about her positions 
on any issues or other relevant topics 
are welcome to do so. Senator GRASS-
LEY
this morning in the Judiciary 
Committee encouraged his colleagues 
on the Republican side of the aisle to 
take advantage of the opportunity if 
they wish. We want to make sure that 
this is an orderly, respectful, collegial, 
and professional process. 
My dearest hope is at the end of the 
day, she will receive bipartisan support 
for this nomination. It would be a 
great day for the Senate, as well as for 
the Supreme Court if that happened. 
But she needs to earn it. And to do it, 
she will be making the rounds in the 
Senate with individual Members mak-
ing her case and then appearing before 
our committee at a later date, which 
we will announce this week. 
I want to thank my colleagues for 
taking this as seriously as they should. 
It is rare in our Senate career that we 
are allowed to bring up the issue of ad-
vise and consent to the highest Court 
in the land—a lifetime appointment, a 
critically important appointment for 
the history of the United States and 
the history of that great Court. 
I want to make sure that on the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, we are re-
spectful and bipartisan in every aspect 
of that effort. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Alaska. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to come down to the floor and 
talk about the issue that is certainly 
the focus of America and the world 
right now, and that is Ukraine, and 
that is the President’s State of the 
Union Address, which will be a very 
important one tonight. 
And I know that Americans all 
across our great Nation are glued to 
their televisions, social media streams. 
And what we are seeing in Europe is 
quite remarkable, quite unsettling— 
another major war on the European 
continent. We are seeing children in 
bomb shelters singing the Ukrainian 
national anthem. We are seeing brave 
young men and women on the front 
lines taking up arms to defend their 
country. We are seeing grandmothers 
take to the streets, foisting upon Rus-
sian conscripts the seeds of their coun-
try’s flower. One of the most effective 
acts of resistance I have ever wit-
nessed. 
Mr. President, you and many of us 
were over in Europe just about a week 
ago at the Munich Security Con-
ference, where we had the opportunity 
to meet with many of these brave 
Ukrainian ministers, the mayor of 
Kyiv, parliamentarians, young parlia-
mentarians. 
And 
our 
message—my 
message certainly was a hard one. At 
the time, the war had not started, but 
we were seeing increasing intelligence 
that it would any day. 
And the message was, if war comes, 
it will be important for the Ukrainian 
people, the leaders, to fight. And we 
are seeing that. All across the country, 
the people in Ukraine are fighting and 
willing to die for freedom, for their 
country. 
I want to say I think I speak for the 
whole Senate: Watching these acts of 
courage and heroism has been truly in-
spiring, and we all applaud the courage 
and heroism that we are seeing in 
Ukraine, and we stand with the people 
of Ukraine. 
Given the circumstances in Ukraine 
and across the globe and in our coun-
try, where working families are strug-
gling under increasing energy costs and 
inflation, I want to talk a little bit 
about the President’s State of the 
Union tonight and what I certainly 
hope he is going to tell the American 
people. 
I and several of my colleagues here, 
Republican colleagues in the Senate, 
will be sending a letter to the Presi-
dent very soon, urging him to an-
nounce specific actions that relate to 
an entirely new world with this inva-
sion of Ukraine by Russia and start to 
announce a course correction on issues 
under which the Biden administration 
has been going the wrong way on two 
key, key areas. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the 
letter to the President. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, March 1, 2022. 
President JOSEPH R. BIDEN, 
The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: We appreciate your 
call for Americans to come together in light 
of Russia’s brutal, unprovoked invasion of 
Ukraine. We strongly support working with 
our allies and partners—one of our nation’s 
most important strategic advantages—as 
well as sending U.S. troops to support and 
defend NA TO allies in Eastern Europe dur-
ing these challenging and dangerous times. 
Yet, as our nation prepares for this new era 
of authoritarian aggression led by the dic-
tators in Russia and China, we have serious 
concerns that we encourage you to address 
in tonight’s State of the Union and there-
after act upon immediately. 
First, you must submit a robust military 
budget that significantly increases defense 
spending to reflect the realities of our 
geostrategic competition with China and 
Russia. Your Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 budget 
proposed significant real cuts to the Depart-
ment of Defense when, at the same time, you 
proposed massive increases to almost every 
other federal agency and department. Putin 
and Xi were undoubtedly encouraged that 
the President of the United States proposed 
significant budget cuts to his own armed 
services. We implore you not to make the 
same strategic mistake again. The FY 2022 
National Defense Authorization Act (NOAA) 
was a clear bipartisan rebuke of your mis-
guided defense budget cuts. You must put 
forward a robust, real increase in defense 
spending focused on the current and future 
readiness and lethality of our force. You 
should also continue to press our NATO al-
lies to meet their two percent of Gross Do-
mestic Product (GDP) goal for defense spend-
ing. 
Second, your Administration’s energy poli-
cies—which focus on restricting, delaying, 
and killing the production of American en-
ergy—have had the predictable but cata-
strophic effect of driving up energy prices for 
American working families, increasing pinks 
slips for American energy workers, and sig-
nificantly empowering our adversaries, espe-
cially Putin, who has used energy as a weap-
on for decades. 
You recently told the American people in a 
press conference that your Administration 
was using ‘‘every tool at our disposal to pro-
tect American families and businesses from 
rising prices at the gas pump’’ and ‘‘taking 
active steps to bring down the cost.’’ Mr. 
President, respectfully, that is not true and 
the facts show it. 
Time and time again, your administration 
has taken steps to unilaterally disarm the 
American energy sector. We hope that in 
your address tonight, you make a strategic 
course correction on your misguided energy 
policies that properly reflects your recent 
promises to reduce energy prices for Amer-
ican families, protect the national security 
of the United States, and provide meaningful 
support to our allies who are struggling to 
meet their energy needs. You can do this 
through the following actions: 
1. Rescind your decision to cancel the Key-
stone XL Pipeline and fast-track other simi-
lar energy infrastructure projects across the 
country. 
2. Work to rescind the recent decision by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC) that makes it much more difficult to 
approve natural gas pipelines. 
3. Commit to fast tracking and producing 
American energy on federal lands, including 
the 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge (ANWR), the National Petroleum Re-
serve of Alaska (NPR–A), and the Gulf of 
Mexico, all of which have decades of abun-
dant proven reserves of oil and gas. 
4. Expedite the permitting of critical min-
erals mining and processing, particularly 
Alaska’s Ambler Road project, and reinstate 
the leases issued to Twin Metals Minnesota 
LLC for the northeastern Minnesota mining 
project. 
5. Reinstate the January 2021 proposed rule 
from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency that would prevent America’s 
large financial institutions from black-list-
ing whole sectors of the economy and ensure 
the energy sector has fair access to capital 
and banking service to advance critically 
needed energy projects. 
6. Direct the Department of Justice to ap-
peal the U.S. District Court’s decision invali-
dating the Department of the Interior’s 
Lease Sale 257. Appealing the Court’s deci-
sion to block this sale will demonstrate the 
administration’s commitment to continuing 
critical offshore development. 
7. Direct the Department of the Interior to 
finalize a new 5-year offshore lease plan by 
June 30, 2022. 
8. Use your bully pulpit to encourage—not 
discourage—America’s financial institutions 
to support American energy independence by 
investing in American oil and gas. 
9. Sanction Russian oil and gas exports to 
America and our allies. We have seen a spike 
in American imports of Russian energy dur-
ing your Administration. We would replace 
such imports, which only empower Putin, 
with increased production of American en-
ergy for our citizens.

10. Issue all pending export licenses and an-
nounce an initiative to surge American liq-
uefied natural gas (LNG) exports to our al-
lies and partners in Europe who are being 
blackmailed and are trapped by the whims of 
tyrant Vladimir Putin. 
11. Terminate the positions of White House 
Climate Czar Gina McCarthy and Special 
Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, 
who have aggressively pushed an all-out as-
sault on America’s energy sector—at home 
and abroad—and whose actions are dramati-
cally weakening America’s geostrategic ad-
vantages. John Kerry’s statements just days 
ago clearly portray someone who does not 
care about the lives lost in the crisis in 
Ukraine but rather protecting the climate 
agenda no matter the cost. In his own words, 
he said, ‘‘Massive emissions consequences to 
the war, but equally importantly you’re 
going to lose people’s focus. You’re going to 
lose, certainly, big country attention be-
cause they will be diverted, and I think it 
could have a damaging impact,’’ and ‘‘I hope 
President Putin will help us to stay on track 
with respect to what we need to do for the 
climate.’’ 
12. Withdraw your nomination of Sarah 
Bloom Raskin based on her commitment to 
reduce American energy projects that would 
provide energy to our allies and reduce 
America’s dependence on Russian oil. 
It is our sincere hope that you announce 
these changes in your address this evening. 
Only then will your promise to use ‘‘every 
tool at our disposal to protect American 
families and businesses from rising prices at 
the gas pump’’ be fulfilled and our national 
security appropriately protected. 
The American people are looking to their 
President to rise to this critical moment. 
Our national security, global stability for 
ourselves and our allies, as well as the pros-
perity of every American family are on the 
line. 
We await your response in tonight’s ad-
dress. 
Sincerely, 
DAN SULLIVAN, 
United States Senator. 
KEVIN CRAMER, 
United States Senator. 
ROGER WICKER 
United States Senator. 
JAMES LANKFORD, 
United States Senator. 
JOHN CORNYN, 
United States Senator. 
JOHN HOEVEN, 
United States Senator. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, let 
me begin with one of the areas of 
course correction that we are urging 
the President to undertake, and that is 
in the area of national defense. 
There are many lessons that we are 
going to learn from this Ukrainian in-
vasion, but one of them is certainly 
that we have entered a new era of au-
thoritarian aggression, led by the dic-
tator in Russia—that is Putin—and the 
dictator in China—that is Xi Jinping. 
When they sense weakness, particu-
larly military weakness, they are act-
ing. 
As I mentioned, this new era of au-
thoritarian aggression is something we 
need to be ready for. It is led by the 
dictators of Russia and China, who are 
increasingly isolated and dangerous. 
They are driven by historical griev-
ances, they are paranoid about their 
democratic neighbors, and they are 
more than willing to use military force 
and other aggressive actions to crush 
the citizens of such countries on their 
periphery. These dangerous dictators, 
Putin and Xi Jinping, are increasingly 
working together to achieve their ag-
gressive goals. 
We must wake up to the fact, and 
that is what we are calling the Presi-
dent to do—hopefully he does in his 
speech tonight—that this new era of 
authoritarian aggression is likely to be 
with us for decades. 
What are the areas which we should 
focus on and which we are respectfully 
requesting the President to focus on 
and announce tonight? Well, first, as I 
mentioned, our Nation’s national de-
fense. Now, unfortunately, this has not 
been a priority of Democratic Presi-
dents. That is a fact. This has not been 
a priority often of my Democratic col-
leagues—some; not all but some. 
Let me just give you some of the 
numbers. In the second term of the 
Obama administration, the Pentagon’s 
budget was slashed by 25 percent—25 
percent. Our military readiness plum-
meted. 
When I got elected to the Senate—in 
many ways, I ran because of these 
issues in 2014. When I was elected in 
2015, I was on the Readiness Sub-
committee of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. The numbers at the time were 
classified because they were so horren-
dous in terms of our military’s readi-
ness. Three out of fifty-eight brigade 
combat teams of the U.S. Army were at 
the tier 1 level of readiness needed for 
deployment—3 out of 58. The Air Force 
was the smallest and oldest in terms of 
aircraft age ever, and less than half of 
the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps’ avia-
tion fleet could fly. That was the U.S. 
military during the end of the second 
term of the Obama administration. 
When you gut defense spending, you 
gut readiness, you gut lethality. 
During the Trump administration, 
when the Republicans had control of 
the Senate, we worked to reverse this 
dangerous hollowing out of our mili-
tary by dramatically increasing fund-
ing. Many of the areas I talked about 
involving readiness and lethality re-
turned back to the levels that the 
American people expect of their mili-
tary. 
Unfortunately, when the President, 
President Biden, was elected, he re-
verted back to what Democratic Presi-
dents always do: He submitted a budget 
that cut defense spending in real 
terms, inflation adjusted, about 3 to 4 
percent cuts. 
What was remarkable, if you looked 
at the Biden budget, everywhere else, 
it was double-digit increases. You 
name the Agency, it got a double-digit 
increase, with the exception of two: De-
partment of Defense and Homeland Se-
curity. Budgets are an indication of 
priorities, and this President was not 
prioritizing his own armed services. 
So what we are doing with regard to 
the letter today is asking the President 
of the United States: You can’t do that 
anymore, Mr. President. We are in a 
new era. 
We had a hearing in the Armed Serv-
ices Committee today. I asked both the 
witnesses 
what 
they 
thought 
Xi 
Jinping and Putin thought when the 
President of the United States put for-
ward a budget to cut his own military. 
The witnesses answered today in this 
hearing: Undoubtedly, it helped em-
bolden Putin and Xi Jinping. 
So the first thing we are asking the 
President to make clear in his speech 
tonight is that he needs to put forward 
a robust, real increase in defense 
spending to make sure we have current 
and future readiness and lethality of 
our military forces. Obviously, if you 
turn on the TV and see what is going 
on around the world, this needs to hap-
pen. 
The President also needs to continue, 
as every President has done before him, 
to call out our NATO allies, whom we 
are acting closely with right now, to 
meet their obligations that they have 
committed to for years, which is to 
spend at least 2 percent of their GDP 
on defense spending. 
The good news is, Germany just an-
nounced that it was going to do this, 
that it was going to double its budget. 
That is remarkable. That is great 
news. But we can’t have Germany lead-
ing on the calls for increasing defense 
spending and lethality. The President 
of the United States needs to do it, and 
he needs to do it tonight. 
The second issue that we raised in 
our letter on the critical need for a 
strategic course correction with this 
administration is with regard to en-
ergy. Everybody knows it. Everybody 
feels it. Everybody understands it. Yet, 
for some reason—I think driven by the 
far left of the Democratic Party—this 
administration won’t get real on en-
ergy. 
Let me talk about that for a minute 
because it is a topic I care deeply about 
and, by the way, have been pressing the 
Biden administration on since day 1, 
that this is bad for our economy, bad 
for working families, and bad for na-
tional security. 
What am I talking about? Well, first, 
it is important to understand what 
President Biden inherited. Over the 4 
years of the Trump administration, 
with Republicans in control of the Sen-
ate, we were able to achieve a bipar-
tisan goal of American foreign policy 
and energy security that we collec-
tively as a nation had been seeking for 
decades: American energy independ-
ence. 
Before the pandemic hit, the United 
States was the largest producer of oil 
in the world, bigger than Saudi Arabia; 
the largest producer of natural gas in 
the world, bigger than Russia; and a 
leader in producing renewables—all-of- 
the-above energy. 
At the same time, and I really want 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle to listen to this, we led the world 
in terms of major economies on reduc-
ing greenhouse gas emissions. Since 
2005, we have reduced these by almost 
15 percent. No other industrialized na-
tion in the world has a record like

March 1, 2022 
that, including our high standards on 
producing energy. In China, the emis-
sions are going through the roof. In the 
United States, they are coming down 
dramatically because of the American 
energy revolution. Millions of jobs 
were created because of this revolution 
in energy, in U.S. manufacturing, in 
energy sectors, and our energy inde-
pendence significantly enhanced our 
Nation’s national security. 
I often recount this story. In a meet-
ing about 4 years ago I had with Sen-
ator John McCain—a close friend of 
mine and mentor in the Senate—and a 
very senior level Russian dissident. At 
the end of the meeting, I asked this 
brave Russian dissident: What more 
can the United States do to undermine 
the Putin regime and to undercut 
Vladimir Putin’s malign influence in 
Europe and around the world? Without 
hesitation, this Russian dissident said: 
It is easy, Senator; America needs to 
produce more American energy. That is 
exactly what we did, and our country 
and our allies benefited enormously. 
So what has been the policy of this 
administration? From day 1—and I 
mean day 1—1 hour into his adminis-
tration, President Biden has inten-
tionally done the opposite. We are not 
going to produce more American en-
ergy, as that Russian dissident told me 
and Senator McCain to do to under-
mine Putin. To the contrary, the Biden 
administration made the conscious de-
cision: We are going to undercut the 
production of American energy. 
Since taking office, this administra-
tion has shut down energy production, 
has made it hard to produce on Federal 
lands, has killed energy infrastructure 
like pipelines, has strong-armed Amer-
ican financial institutions and not in-
vested in energy here and particularly 
in places like my State, the great 
State of Alaska. 
All of this restricting, delaying, kill-
ing the production of American energy, 
driven by a far-left agenda that makes 
no sense, has had the very predictable 
result of what? Catastrophically driv-
ing up energy prices for American 
working families—we are seeing that 
every day; my colleagues know that— 
increasing pink slips for American en-
ergy workers. Keystone XL laid off 
10,000 workers, a lot of laborers. First 
day on the job—that was the Presi-
dent’s call. 
Here is the thing that matters right 
now: This war on American energy has 
significantly empowered our adver-
saries, especially Vladimir Putin, who 
has used energy as a weapon for dec-
ades. 
Again, I see this every day. Think 
about this statistic if you are an Alas-
kan citizen. This administration comes 
up to Alaska and tries to delay and 
shut down the production of American 
energy. Guess what. At the same time, 
year 1 in the Biden administration, we 
are now importing 700,000 barrels a day 
of oil from Russia—almost a 40-percent 
increase in year 1 from the Biden ad-
ministration. Does any American or 
any U.S. Senator think that makes 
sense—killing American energy pro-
duction in our great Nation and im-
porting hundreds of thousands of bar-
rels more from Vladimir Putin? Be-
cause if you do—well, actually, I don’t 
think anyone thinks that makes sense. 
But that is what is happening right 
now. In effect, the United States, in 
many ways, along with countries in 
Europe, is funding the very war that 
Putin has launched. 
The United States still is the world’s 
largest producer of natural gas, but, 
again, due to the irrationality and hos-
tility toward pipelines, we can’t get 
enough natural gas to the Northeast. 
So you see places like Boston import-
ing LNG from where? Russia. 
This is insane. This is insane. This is 
a colossal, strategic mistake. It is 
clearly harming American working 
families. I am sure every Senator hears 
about it when they go home. But it is 
also national security suicide. 
It is being done, supposedly, to lower 
carbon emissions, but I want to be 
clear about that, too, because it isn’t. 
In fact, oil produced in the United 
States has lower emissions than oil 
produced in most other countries. LNG 
shipped to Europe from the United 
States has a 41-percent lower carbon 
emission footprint than gas piped in 
from Russia, and we also have some of 
the 
most 
rigorous 
environmental 
standards anywhere on the planet in 
terms of production. 
So, again, the Biden administration’s 
energy 
policies 
are 
strengthening 
Putin, increasing costs and hurting 
Americans, and are actually doing zero 
to address global emissions. The only 
conclusion I can come up with is the 
far left has undertaken some kind of 
holy war against the production of 
American energy, and it makes no 
sense. 
So here is what we are asking the 
President. He gave a speech to the 
American people the other night where 
he said that he is using all available 
tools to address these energy chal-
lenges. With all due respect to the 
President of the United States, that is 
not true. The President knows it; his 
team knows it; every Senator here 
knows it, and the American people 
know it. 
So in our letter today that we are 
sending to the President, we are say-
ing, President Biden, if you want to 
keep your word to the American people 
on what you just told them, ‘‘all avail-
able tools,’’ here is what you can actu-
ally announce tonight at the State of 
the Union that will have very signifi-
cant, real impacts on lowering energy 
costs in America and increasing our 
national security relative to Putin. 
Some of the actions we requested the 
President to take in the letter we are 
sending him before the State of the 
Union. 
Simple, rescind your decision to can-
cel the Keystone XL Pipeline and fast- 
track other similar energy infrastruc-
ture projects around the country. 
Work to rescind the recent decision 
by the Biden administration’s Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, 
that makes it much more difficult to 
actually approve natural gas pipelines. 
My understanding is my good friend 
from West Virginia Senator MANCHIN is 
holding a hearing on this very issue on 
Thursday because he knows that this is 
national security suicide. 
Commit to fast-tracking and pro-
ducing American energy on American 
lands, particularly where the Congress 
has told you to do so, like ANWR in 
Alaska, like the National Petroleum 
Reserve in Alaska—Congress has said 
produce there; that is the law—like the 
Gulf of Mexico. We have decades in our 
great Nation of abundant proven re-
serves of oil and gas. So why are we im-
porting so much from Putin right now? 
This brings me to another request. 
And this is a request of many Senators, 
and I believe Democratic Senators 
also. We should be banning the impor-
tation of Russian oil into the United 
States. Canada just announced it was 
doing it yesterday. Why would we be 
importing 700,000 barrels a day of Rus-
sian oil when we have millions and mil-
lions of barrels in Alaska? Can some-
body answer that question? 
I hope the President of the United 
States looks at our letter and recog-
nizes 
these 
are 
commonsense 
ap-
proaches that are going to be needed to 
address this new era of authoritarian 
aggression, not just with Vladimir 
Putin but with Xi Jinping as well. 
When you look at what the Communist 
Party fears more than anything, it is 
American energy dominance. And yet 
this administration has come in, in 
year 1, unilaterally disarmed one of our 
most important strategic advantages 
in the world. 
One other thing we mention in the 
letter, which makes so much sense, is 
to issue all pending export licenses and 
announce an initiative to help surge 
American liquefied natural gas to our 
allies in Europe and partners in Europe 
who right now are being blackmailed 
and trapped by Vladimir Putin’s use of 
energy. 
Again, you would think that would 
be a no-brainer. 
And we hope the President looks at 
the American people tonight and goes 
through this list of good energy ideas 
that we have given him and says he is 
going to do it—says he is going to do 
it. 
The world is reeling right now. Our 
country certainly is hurting, in terms 
of inflation and many other challenges, 
many of which are self-inflicted like 
the energy challenges. We can take 
steps to strengthen our country. And a 
strong 
United 
States, 
of 
course, 
strengthens the world. 
We have seen this time and time 
again throughout history. Our country 
is the beacon of freedom and hope, and 
the light of that beacon can only shine 
brightly, can only cast light on all cor-
ners of the globe when we are strong. 
And it shines most brightly when our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S868 
March 1, 2022 
citizens are not struggling, but when 
we have strong communities, strong 
families, bolstered by good-paying jobs 
that provide dignity. 
Our light of freedom shines most 
brightly when our country is on a com-
mon mission, and I think the President 
can call us toward a common mission 
tonight by listening to some of the 
things that we as Republicans have im-
plored him to talk about and focus on 
in his speech. 
As I mentioned, as a country, it is 
important that we wake up to the fact 
that this new era of authoritarian ag-
gression will likely be with us for dec-
ades. We need to face it with con-
fidence and strategic resolve. 
Our country has extraordinary ad-
vantages relative to the dictatorships 
of Russia and China if we are wise 
enough to utilize and strengthen them. 
Our global network of allies, our lethal 
military, our world-class natural re-
sources and energy resources, our dy-
namic economy, and most important, 
our democratic values and commit-
ment to liberty. 
Xi Jinping and Putin’s biggest weak-
ness and vulnerability is that they fear 
their own people. We should remember 
and exploit this vulnerability in the 
months and years ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, yester-
day, many of us in the Senate had the 
opportunity to meet with the Ukrain-
ian Ambassador to the United States. 
It was an opportunity for many of us 
to express our admiration for the com-
mitment of the Ukrainian people to the 
sovereignty of their country. They are 
motivated by the love of their country 
and a passion for freedom. Their Presi-
dent, President Zelenskyy, has shown 
courageous leadership. He has been in-
spirational as we have watched how he 
has put his own life at risk in order to 
serve his country. He has put country 
before personal safety. 
Ukraine versus Russia, good versus 
evil, this unprovoked attack on a 
peaceful sovereign country, orches-
trated by Mr. Putin. We are not sur-
prised. It was widely publicized, the use 
of his playbook. We knew what he was 
doing hour by hour in planning the in-
vasion on Ukraine. It doesn’t diminish 
the tragedy of Mr. Putin’s actions. 
This is Mr. Putin’s war, and he must be 
held fully accountable for what he has 
caused. 
I want to thank President Biden for 
his extraordinary global leadership on 
this issue. We have seen unity among 
our alliance, and we have seen global 
unity in condemning Mr. Putin’s ac-
tions, which is so important in order to 
put the right focus on who is respon-
sible and who can end this tragic war. 
We have imposed the strongest set of 
multilateral sanctions ever on Russia’s 
leaders and institutions. We have cut 
off many of its banks from the Swiss 
system of banking. We have put per-
sonal sanctions on Mr. Putin and his 
enablers. We have frozen assets around 
the world. We have isolated Russia 
from international organizations and 
events. We have restricted airspace to 
Russian aircraft. All that has been 
done not just by the United States but 
in conjunction with our allies around 
the world, and it is having a major im-
pact on Russia. 
We have seen unity in NATO. I think 
Mr. Putin thought that his campaign 
in Ukraine would weaken the NATO al-
liance. It has done just the opposite. It 
has strengthened the NATO alliance. 
We have sent NATO troops to the coun-
tries that border Russia that are mem-
bers of NATO to make it clear that we 
understand our collective obligation 
under article 5 of the NATO treaty: an 
attack on one is an attack on all, and 
we will come to each other’s mutual 
defense. 
And we have seen many countries 
that have been reluctant to get in-
volved in war-type activities change 
their position because they realize how 
clear it is what Russia is doing violates 
every international commitment and 
jeopardizes not just the integrity of 
Ukraine but the integrity of Europe, 
the 
integrity 
of 
sovereign 
states 
around the world. 
So let me point out just one of our 
NATO partners, Germany. Germany 
canceled—put on hold Nord Stream 2. 
We know Mr. Putin has used energy as 
a weapon. He has weaponized the 
source of energy he has in his country. 
He has done that several times. Nord 
Stream 2 would give him additional 
wealth and energy—stopped by Ger-
many. But Germany has gone further 
than that. For the first time, now they 
are going to be supplying lethal weap-
ons to Ukraine, recognizing that all of 
us 
have 
a 
responsibility 
to 
help 
Ukraine in its hour of need. 
And, yes, Germany has now made a 
commitment that we have asked all 
NATO nations to do, devote 2 percent 
of their economy to our mutual de-
fense, and Germany is now stepping up 
to meet that 2 percent commitment. 
That is what we are seeing from NATO 
partners. 
Turkey is going to block the use of 
warships from being able to use its 
waters in order to get engaged in the 
conflict; that is, Russian warships. 
We have seen non-NATO countries 
step up to the plate. We are very 
pleased with the global response, Fin-
land’s response, Switzerland’s response. 
This is unprecedented that we had this 
type of global unity saying to Mr. 
Putin: 
Stop 
this 
invasion, 
an 
unprovoked attack on a peaceful na-
tion. Stop it. 
Now, the consequences of our action 
have had major impact on the Russian 
economy. Their interest rates have 
gone up dramatically. The value of 
their currency, the ruble, has fallen 
dramatically. Their economy is suf-
fering dramatically. And when the Rus-
sian people want to know who to blame 
as a result of their economy going into 
the tank—one person, the person who 
caused this war, Mr. Putin. 
The Ukrainians are defending their 
country and have disrupted Putin’s 
military expectations. These are really 
people motivated for the right reasons 
to defend their country, and they have 
been able to do amazing things in stop-
ping Russia’s advancements. That is 
because of the will, determination, and 
bravery of the Ukrainian people. 
They need our help, and they need 
the help of our allies in supplying the 
necessary military equipment in order 
to defend themselves. We know how 
many Russian tanks are out there, and 
we know how many Russian aircraft 
are out there. They need anti-tank and 
anti-aircraft weapons, and they need 
ammunition. They need a lot in order 
to defend themselves, and we and our 
allies need to step up to make sure 
they have what they need. 
They also, by the way, need humani-
tarian aid. We know that there are al-
ready over several hundred thousand 
refugees who have escaped the violence 
in Ukraine and have gone into neigh-
boring countries. It is estimated that 
number could grow into the millions. 
We need to work with the international 
community in regard to the humani-
tarian needs of the refugees. We also 
have to realize that Ukraine’s supply 
chain has been totally disrupted. We 
need to provide humanitarian aid with-
in Ukraine, get it to the border, and 
work with the Ukrainian officials so 
they can get it inside the country. 
That is our responsibility in order to 
help in this hour of need. We need to do 
even more than that, and there are ad-
ditional steps that we can take. 
We need to continue to ratchet up 
the sanctions that are being imposed 
against Mr. Putin and Russia. As I said 
earlier, these sanctions are severe 
today, and we need to consider doing 
more. The administration is already 
setting up a process by which we can 
trace laundered assets so that, when we 
say we are going to freeze the assets of 
those who are being sanctioned, we will 
find those assets wherever you try to 
hide them. We are going to work with 
our allies around the world in order to 
make it clear that there is no safe 
haven for you to hide your wealth. 
We need to continue to build on indi-
vidual sanctions. We know that. Indi-
vidual sanctions mean a great deal, and 
there are others who need to be sanc-
tioned. Yes, I think we need to consider 
the oil and gas industry as to how we 
can make it clear that we are not going 
to let Mr. Putin benefit from his as-
sets. 
Trading policies need to be reevalu-
ated. A country that invades another 
country without any provocation what-
soever should not be entitled to normal 
trade relations with the United States, 
and we should be looking at how we 
can enforce those types of changes. 
Yes, there needs to be personal ac-
countability. It has now become quite 
obvious that Mr. Putin has had no re-
gard whatsoever for civilian casualties. 
In fact, there have been reports that he 
may have targeted civilians in his ef-
fort to gain control of Ukraine. We

need to make it clear that, if the facts 
are there, we will pursue potential war 
crimes. No one should escape account-
ability. We should hold those who are 
responsible for these tragedies ac-
countable for them. 
Let me make it clear. As Mr. 
Zelenskyy has said, the President of 
Ukraine, we will always look for a dip-
lomatic way to end this war. We want 
this war never to have started, and we 
want it to end as soon as possible. We 
will look in any way we can for a diplo-
matic end to this war—preserving the 
sovereignty of Ukraine. 
We recognize that Mr. Putin’s war 
has brought to our attention other 
issues that we need to really pay atten-
tion to. One is the energy policy of Eu-
rope and the United States. I have 
heard my colleagues talk about this, 
but the right answer is energy inde-
pendence, investment in renewable en-
ergy sources, so that we can not only 
protect our national security but so 
that we can also protect our environ-
ment. We need to make those invest-
ments moving forward so none of our 
allies ever has to rely upon an auto-
cratic government’s supply of oil or 
gas. 
I want to underscore the importance 
that was brought to our attention yes-
terday. There was a parliamentarian 
from Ukraine who was there who said: 
Thank you so much for the Magnitsky 
sanctions that you have imposed on in-
dividuals because that really hurts. 
Well, we are proud because it was 
this body that initiated the Magnitsky 
sanctions. 
Let me remind my colleagues that 
our law expires at the end of this year. 
Now is the time to expand and extend 
the Global Magnitsky law. We need to 
protect our supply chains. We saw that 
during the coronavirus, but we also 
recognize, with supplies in autocratic 
countries, that we need to shore up our 
own supplies and make them in Amer-
ica. We have legislation that has 
passed the House and Senate. Let’s get 
that bill to the finish line. That would 
be so important for our national secu-
rity. 
Our immediate priority: Let us all 
stand with the people of Ukraine in 
their struggle for freedom. They have 
not only our admiration, but they have 
our support. We want to do what we 
can, and we stand with the people of 
Ukraine. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
last week, President Putin of Russia 
ordered 
100,000 
to 
200,000 
Russians 
across Ukraine’s border. Air raid sirens 
rang out. Bombs rained down. Russia 
declared war on Ukraine—the first war 
in Europe since 1945. 
Putin’s terror is hard to watch. We 
have all seen it on television in 
realtime, but it is important we not 
look away. Amid it all, we are seeing 
examples of heroism and hearing sto-
ries of strength. 
Early in the fight, Russian warships 
called for Ukrainians to lay down their 
weapons on the small Snake Island. 
Ukrainian fighters answered with a 
bold response that has reverberated as 
a sort of drumbeat of defiance across 
the country. Since then, we have seen 
Ukrainians embody determination in 
the face of desperation—all in the 
name of freedom and love for their 
country. A Ukrainian marine sacrificed 
himself to blow up a bridge near Kyiv 
so that Russian tanks could not cross. 
All the while, President Zelenskyy of 
Ukraine has stayed. He has not aban-
doned his country, even though he 
knows Putin’s goal is to topple the 
Ukrainian Government—all this while 
knowing that President Putin of Rus-
sia has sent over assassins to eliminate 
him. He planted his feet and squared 
his shoulders for the fight and is ral-
lying his fellow countrymen to do the 
same. 
Ukrainian citizens are following suit, 
showing true bravery in the face of 
madness. As the Ukrainian Govern-
ment began to hand out weapons, thou-
sands and thousands lined up to receive 
them, men and women. Volunteers, or-
dinary citizens, are adding to the re-
sistance. They are men and women, 
young and old, coming from all back-
grounds and walks of life—all to defend 
freedom and democracy in their coun-
try. 
It is clear Mr. Putin underestimated 
the Ukrainians’ will to fight. While 
Ukrainians are handing Russia a tough 
fight, we know there will be hard days 
ahead. Mr. Putin’s rationale for invad-
ing was the ‘‘demilitarization and de- 
Nazification of Ukraine,’’ arguing that, 
if Ukraine joined NATO, the West 
would have an excuse to invade Russia. 
That is paranoia. That is delusion. 
That doesn’t sound like a strong lead-
er. It sounds like a weak leader. Putin 
was betting that NATO would fold and 
that countries would turn against one 
another. If anything, Mr. Putin’s bul-
lying has strengthened NATO. 
Last week, Germany halted the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline, and now, in a some-
what surprising about-face, Germany is 
agreeing to send weapons to Ukraine. 
This not only frees up other countries 
to follow suit, but it also reverses their 
historic policy of never sending weap-
ons to a conflict zone. 
Over the weekend, the United States 
joined with the European Commission 
and Canada, France, the United King-
dom, Italy, and Germany to ban select 
Russian banks from SWIFT. By lim-
iting access to this international pay-
ment system, we move closer to the 
goal of further isolating Russia. Addi-
tionally, the group leveled sanctions on 
Russia’s central bank—paralyzing as-
sets and freezing transactions. At least 
26 NATO countries have either inde-
pendently issued sanctions or have 
joined the EU sanctions. 
Since the invasion, the United States 
has not only imposed economic and fi-
nancial sanctions, but we also author-
ized $350 million in new military aid to 
Ukraine, including anti-tank and air 
defense capabilities, and the State De-
partment has sent millions in humani-
tarian aid. We are now seeing an inflec-
tion point for other countries—a time 
for choosing. Countries like Sweden, 
Finland, and Kosovo are all voicing a 
desire to join NATO. They are choosing 
to align with the West. 
So, in a moment of apparent frustra-
tion over the past few days, Putin or-
dered his Russian nuclear deterrent 
forces to be put on high alert in re-
sponse to what he calls ‘‘aggressive 
statements’’ from NATO leaders and 
the West’s financial sanctions. 
But I ask this question: Why? Why 
were all of these sanctions not pre-
sented 6 months ago to possibly deter 
this aggression and save tens of thou-
sands of lives? 
We were late. 
As it currently stands, this is not a 
fight for American troops, but if a 
NATO country is threatened, we will 
and do need to act. Facts could change; 
therefore, policies have to change, 
which is why we need to continue to 
impose harsh financial sanctions and 
project strength during this very ugly 
situation. 
Another step we must take is to re-
gain energy independence. We import 
nearly 600,000 barrels of oil a day from 
Russia. The Keystone Pipeline would 
have provided us 800,000 barrels per 
day. 
Ahead of the invasion, President 
Biden admitted ‘‘defending freedom 
will have costs for us at home here as 
well.’’ The irony is that Americans 
aren’t just now feeling the economic 
strain as we begin to ‘‘defend freedom’’ 
through 
sanctions 
on 
Russia. 
Gas 
prices began to soar long before Mr. 
Putin waged war in Ukraine. It started 
with the President’s first day in office 
when he blocked the Keystone Pipeline 
and undercut our Nation’s energy inde-
pendence. Russia ramped up aggression 
against Ukraine at the same time as 
the administration was canceling 80 
million acres of oil and gas leases. 
Green policies here at home have 
pushed us to seek energy abroad, and 
our country is paying a huge and hefty 
price. 
President Biden has again admitted 
that we might need to dip into our oil 
reserves, but why not dig into the oil 
reserves—dig our own oil? 
This is no time to be a purist and 
think others can bail us out. The 
United States of America is an energy- 
rich nation, but we must have smart 
policies in place to use them. 
This is an economic and a national 
security issue. You cannot have a 
strong economy without low energy 
costs, and ridding ourselves of our reli-
ance on Russian energy is a matter of 
national security. What happens in 
Ukraine matters, but so, too, do our 
actions here at home. 
So as our country prepares to hear 
from President Biden tonight on the 
state of our Union, I urge the President 
to project a strong path forward, to

double down on investments in our 
military, and to put forth policies to 
ensure we regain our energy independ-
ence. 
If the state of our Union here at 
home is strong, it will only serve to 
strengthen our standing abroad. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Russia 
is waging war, the likes we have not 
seen since World War II. They are wag-
ing war on freedom and democracy. 
Over recent days, the world has 
watched in horror as Russian troops 
have invaded and brutally attacked 
Ukraine and Ukrainians. So far, esti-
mates are that 350 Ukrainians have 
been killed. We really don’t know what 
the number is, but we do know that 
countless civilians have been injured, 
and more than half a million Ukrain-
ians, including women and children, 
are now refugees. 
This invasion was not weeks or even 
months in the making; this has been 
Moscow’s plan for years. Putin has 
made no secret of his desire to redraw 
the maps of Europe and to restore the 
Russian Empire. That is why in 2008, 
Russia invaded the nation of Georgia. 
In 2014, it invaded Ukraine, for the first 
time since the end of the Cold War, 
taking the Crimea region. So the cur-
rent invasion of Ukraine is really the 
second invasion we have seen from 
Vladimir Putin’s Russian Federation 
since 2014. Putin’s appetite has not 
been satisfied. If anything, these inva-
sions have made him hungrier for 
power. 
The people of Ukraine have lived 
under the shadow of Russian aggres-
sion for years, and it has always been a 
question of when, not if, Russia would 
finally act. For months, Russia has 
amassed hundreds of thousands of 
troops on Ukraine’s border, with num-
bers growing from a few thousand to 
more than 150,000. 
Defenders of freedom and democracy 
everywhere look to the United States 
for leadership. But, sadly, they were let 
down. That is because when it comes to 
projecting strength to authoritarians 
like Vladimir Putin and President Xi, 
to the Ayatollahs in Iran and Kim Jong 
Un in North Korea, the Biden adminis-
tration 
repeatedly 
projects 
not 
strength but weakness. 
First of all, when it comes to Europe 
and Ukraine and Russia, President 
Biden should not have waived sanc-
tions on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline 
last year. He should have never sug-
gested that certain Russian attacks 
would be disregarded by the United 
States. A minor incursion, he said, 
might be overlooked. 
And he should have taken swift ac-
tion and imposed paralyzing sanctions 
on Russia before—before—an invasion 
to give them a taste of what might 
come, in an effort to deter Putin from 
invading in the first place. And we 
should have earlier sent greater defen-
sive weapons to the Ukrainians. Strong 
action was called for before the war 
started, but unfortunately, we have 
been playing catchup since it did start. 
But now, we have a critical task 
ahead of us. Between this crisis and the 
disastrous withdrawal from Afghani-
stan stranding thousands of Americans 
without consultation or communica-
tion with any of our NATO allies that 
were discouraged and shocked to find 
out that we would leave them hanging, 
President Biden has repeatedly given 
our NATO allies reason to doubt our 
commitment and our credibility. 
I am sure Vladimir Putin is taking 
notice. I am sure President Xi and the 
People’s Republic of China has as well. 
In fact, Xi Jinping has already ex-
pressed approval of the Russian inva-
sion of Ukraine. 
Putin has now put Russia’s nuclear 
forces on high alert, threatening to es-
calate to the unthinkable—something 
that hasn’t happened since 1945—the 
discharge of a nuclear device. He has 
also ordered his soldiers to fire on resi-
dential neighborhoods, a clear-cut ex-
ample of a war crime. 
There is need of decisive action to 
counter Russian aggression. With the 
eyes the world looking at the United 
States for leadership, it is time for us 
to step up in defense of this democracy. 
President 
Biden 
needs 
to 
follow 
through on his promise to make Putin 
a ‘‘pariah on the world stage.’’ The 
Biden administration has put harsh 
sanctions on Russia, but its most valu-
able 
asset 
remains 
virtually 
un-
touched, and that is Russia’s oil and 
gas sector. 
Even as Russia wages a brutal war 
against the people of Ukraine, it is ex-
porting energy to the rest the world 
and using the profits—$100 oil and 
higher—to fund the war against inno-
cent 
Ukrainian 
citizens. 
Sanctions 
against banks and oligarchs are cru-
cial, but we should not ignore Russia’s 
single largest economic asset. 
The United States must identify 
ways to offset the global demand for 
Russian energy, both here at home and 
with our oil-producing allies abroad, so 
we can cut off Putin’s biggest stream 
of revenue. That would be the biggest 
and best sanction of all. 
Our friend John McCain used to joke 
that 
Russia 
was 
a 
gas 
station 
masquerading as a country to make 
the point that their oil and gas sector 
is the single most important part of 
their economy. And yet so far, the U.S. 
Government has left it relatively un-
touched and unscathed. 
In addition to economic penalties, we 
must provide additional materiel sup-
port for Ukrainian forces to sustain 
their heroic and inspirational fight 
against Russian aggression. A few 
weeks ago, I began working with a bi-
partisan group of colleagues on a far- 
reaching bill to counter this aggres-
sion. This package included legislation 
that I introduced called the Ukraine 
Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, 
reminiscent of what the United States 
did when Britain was hanging by a 
thread under Nazi aggression in World 
War II. 
Just as we did in World War II for our 
allies in Britain, this bill would ensure 
that Ukrainian forces and the Ukrain-
ian citizenry had the defensive weap-
ons, the air power, the ships—whatever 
they needed—in order to defend their 
sovereignty. It also included security 
assistance, as well as sanctions on Rus-
sia. 
And even though we agreed on a bi-
partisan basis on the vast majority of 
what was being discussed, the adminis-
tration’s oppositions prevented us from 
reaching a final agreement. 
I am disappointed that we were un-
able to act and send a strong and 
united and bipartisan message as Con-
gress to Vladimir Putin, but the fact 
that we were unsuccessful then doesn’t 
eliminate the need for us to take fur-
ther action now. 
Thanks to the leadership of the rank-
ing member of the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee, Senator RISCH from 
Idaho, I was proud to join my Repub-
lican colleagues in introducing legisla-
tion that will kneecap Russia’s efforts. 
The Never Yielding Europe’s Territory 
Act doesn’t just support Ukraine or im-
pose economic consequences on Russia 
on counter Russian aggression, it does 
all of the above. 
This legislation includes a range of 
measures to strengthen Ukraine’s abil-
ity to defend itself, including my lend- 
lease bill. It imposes harsh economic 
consequences on the Russian economy 
through far-reaching sanctions. 
As we all know, Senator MENENDEZ, 
the chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, and Senator RISCH, the 
ranking member, negotiated for days 
and indeed weeks upon weeks, but were 
unable to come up with a bipartisan 
package. 
I am especially disappointed that 
today, when Senator RISCH offered to 
take up and pass this bill by unani-
mous consent, that it was blocked by 
one of our Democratic colleagues. I 
wonder what kind of message that 
sends to Vladimir Putin—not a good 
one. 
America stands with Ukraine, and we 
must do everything in our power to 
help Ukrainian forces defend their free-
dom and their democracy. Through the 
devastation that we have seen over the 
past couple of days, we have all been 
inspired by the strength and courage of 
the Ukrainian people. They are on the 
frontlines of the war against our val-
ues, against their sovereignty, against 
democracy, and they deserve our un-
equivocal support. 
As the conflict—indeed, as the war— 
in Ukraine wages on, strong American 
leadership is desperately needed on a 
bipartisan, monolithic basis. 
This evening, President Biden will 
have a chance to provide his State of 
the Union message, and I hope that he 
sends a clear message to the world that 
Russia’s belligerence and hostility will 
not be tolerated. The American people, 
our friends and allies, and our adver-
saries will be paying close attention,

and President Biden should not pull 
any punches. He should not mince 
words. He should say that America 
stands with Ukraine, and we will not 
tolerate as civilized nations—as democ-
racies—a blatant attack on a fellow de-
mocracy. 
In addition to the many challenges 
abroad, the American people are facing 
the failures of the President Biden’s 
domestic policies here at home. Fami-
lies are being battered by the worst in-
flation in 40 years, up 71⁄2 percent so far 
this year alone. It is more expensive in 
Texas to heat your home, to stock your 
pantry, or fill your gas tank. 
I spoke to cotton producers in Abi-
lene, TX, just last week. They told me 
their single biggest problem is the cost 
of inputs, of fuel, fertilizer, and other 
things they need in order to grow their 
product, their commodity. 
Anyone who has a need to make a big 
purchase—things like a car or home ap-
pliances—has likely experienced ex-
treme sticker shock. 
Business owners, too, have been hit 
with a double whammy as supply chain 
issues make it even more difficult and 
more costly to produce, sell, and ship 
their products. 
Wages have increased some, which 
would normally be good news, but wage 
growth is still being outpaced by infla-
tion; meaning that for the average 
American 
family, 
their 
purchasing 
power is shrinking, not growing be-
cause of inflation. That means our 
workers have essentially gotten a pay 
cut because of the flawed policies of 
the Biden administration. 
Economists said that if our Demo-
cratic colleagues had proceeded with 
their nearly $2 trillion partisan spend-
ing spree at the beginning of last year, 
that it would cause inflation. I still re-
member Larry Summers, a Demo-
cratic-leaning economist who served in 
Bill Clinton’s Cabinet, warning that all 
of this money that Congress is spend-
ing—not the money we were spending 
for public health purposes or to miti-
gate the economic consequences of 
COVID–19, but the money spent on 
other items in our Democratic col-
leagues’ outbox—he said that we are 
risking the return of inflation like we 
haven’t seen in the last few decades. 
Despite the warning from people like 
Larry Summers and others, our Demo-
cratic colleagues forged ahead and now 
America’s working families are paying 
the price. 
I hope President Biden has a plan he 
will announce tonight on how to at-
tack inflation. But that plan cannot— 
cannot—involve 
his 
ill-conceived 
‘‘Build Back Broke’’ agenda. This is an-
other $5 trillion spending bill that, 
thanks to bipartisan opposition, did 
not go anywhere, but which threatened 
huge tax increases and huge infla-
tionary spending. This is not time to 
pile on and make the American peo-
ple’s pain worse. We need to do every-
thing we can to reduce inflation, to in-
crease their buying power. 
I would like to also hear the Presi-
dent’s strategy to address another cri-
sis, and that is the crisis at our south-
ern border. My State has 1,200 miles of 
border with Mexico, and, last year 
alone, we have seen 2 million people 
show up at the border, either to be re-
turned to their country of origin or, 
more likely, to be welcomed into the 
United States and be given a slip of 
paper that says: Show up for your im-
migration court hearing in a year or 2 
years. 
We know that the human smugglers 
are getting rich smuggling people into 
the United States. They understand 
our system. They know how to exploit 
the flaws in our system, and they are 
getting rich doing so. And by flooding 
the border with so many people, includ-
ing unaccompanied children at one 
time, it takes Border Patrol off the 
frontlines while the drug smugglers 
move their illicit cargo into the United 
States. And it is those drugs that have 
contributed to the loss of more than 
100,000 American lives due to drug 
overdoses last year alone. 
I want to hear President Biden’s an-
swer: Why haven’t you done anything 
about it? Why haven’t you welcomed or 
asked for the help of bipartisan Mem-
bers of Congress to try to address this 
crisis at the border? 
Instead, the Biden administration 
made it worse. They revoked many of 
the policies of the previous administra-
tion that deterred an influx of migra-
tion, and they failed to anticipate the 
obvious consequences. When you lay 
out the welcome mat on the U.S. bor-
der, people will come, and they come 
not just from Mexico and Central 
America. They come from around the 
world. 
I remember early on during the Biden 
administration talking to the chief of 
the Border Patrol in the Del Rio Sec-
tor. He said: In the last few weeks, we 
have detained people from 150-plus 
countries. 
The reason for that is obvious. Illegal 
immigration is the way that inter-
national criminal networks get rich 
and do business. And if you have 
enough money, they will get you across 
the southern border, exploiting the 
laws that we know need to be changed 
but we cannot seem to muster the sup-
port from President Biden nor our 
Democratic friends to fix. 
Local governments and my constitu-
ents in the Rio Grande Valley and 
along the border, who are largely His-
panic themselves, understand the dif-
ference between legal and illegal immi-
gration, and they are being inundated 
with illegal immigration and the bur-
dens that are associated with that. 
They are looking to Washington to do 
something about it, but those calls are 
not being answered. So the burden falls 
on State government—Governor Ab-
bott and the Texas Legislature—to try 
to step up. But this is the Federal Gov-
ernment’s responsibility, not the State 
government’s responsibility. Leaders in 
Texas have begged the Biden adminis-
tration to step up and do its duty. They 
have asked for more staff, better re-
sources, and policies that put an end to 
these pull factors, but the administra-
tion has done nothing. The only con-
clusion I can draw after all this time is 
they just don’t care. 
As we head into the spring, which is 
typically the busiest time at the bor-
der, the Biden administration needs to 
take action. The President cannot con-
tinue to ignore this humanitarian cri-
sis. We need a concrete plan to address 
this chaos and ensure that migrants 
are treated fairly and humanely in ac-
cordance with U.S. law. 
But, sadly, the border crisis isn’t the 
only problem the administration has 
shown complete and utter disregard 
for. Communities across the country 
are worried about alarming increases 
in violent crime. 
This morning alone, we had a hearing 
in 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
on 
carjacking, the violent theft of an 
automobile using a gun or other weap-
on to steal it from a person who may 
be driving their kids to school or to 
work or to church, only to have their 
car stolen and their life threatened or 
taken. 
In 2020, murders rose nearly 30 per-
cent from the year before—30 percent— 
the single largest increase on record. 
We are still waiting for the rest of the 
data from 2021, but, so far, the picture 
is no brighter. A number of major cit-
ies experienced their deadliest years on 
record. Of course, this was in the wake 
of this boneheaded idea called ‘‘defund 
the police,’’ which destroyed support 
for the police at the local level and de-
moralized the men and women who are 
doing their duty in an honorable and 
necessary way each and every day. 
This is the price that you pay for such 
misguided efforts as defunding the po-
lice. 
The American people are paying at-
tention, as you would expect. A poll in 
November found that more than half of 
those surveyed believe that local crime 
had gotten worse—a 13-percent jump 
from the previous year. Concerns at 
the national level are even higher. 
Nearly three-quarters of Americans be-
lieve that crime is up nationally. They 
believe that because it is. This is bad 
news for families, for communities, for 
businesses, and for our dedicated law 
enforcement professionals, and the ad-
ministration needs to take action. 
American families are facing a host 
of crises at home, and democracy is 
taking a beating abroad. Tonight, I 
hope President Biden will outline a 
clear plan to address these many chal-
lenges and come up with answers that 
we can work on together in a bipar-
tisan way. Trying to do things in a 50– 
50 Senate or at the 4-vote majority in 
the House of Representatives is des-
tined to fail, as we have seen time and 
time again. The only way to get things 
done in a 50–50 Senate is to work to 
build consensus and get bipartisan sup-
port. 
I hope we will see a midcourse correc-
tion from the administration on these 
many challenges that I mentioned

than a year now. I hope and I trust he 
will send a strong message to the world 
that America condemns Russian action

Mr.

I 
strongly believe women should have

under attack in many States across the 
country. For this reason, I voted to 
move to the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act. I will continue to fight to 
codify Roe v. Wade, as I have since 
coming to the Senate, so that no mat-
ter where you live in America you can 
access the full range of reproductive 
health care. I know that many Colo-
radans have a moral difference of opin-
ion on this matter, and I respect their 
beliefs. In the end, I believe the value 
of individual liberty demands that peo-
ple, not governments, make these most 
personal decisions.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
BETH 
TFILOH 
CONGREGATION 
SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP TRANSI-
TION 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of a rare event 
happening this Saturday at my home 
synagogue of Beth Tfiloh in Pikesville, 
MD. At what is the largest Modern Or-
thodox Synagogue in America, with 
over 1,200 members, we will install only 
the fourth senior rabbi since the found-
ing of the congregation in 1921. 
In Judaism, a rabbi is a leader or 
teacher. ‘‘Teacher’’ is the literal trans-
lation of the word. He or she is a spir-
itual guide for the community through 
spiritual learning and religious explo-
ration. Our rabbi is an integral part of 
all 
life-cycle 
and 
congregational 
events. 
Rabbi Chai Posner was selected by a 
unanimous vote of the members of the 
Beth Tfiloh congregation as the next 
spiritual leader of our synagogue in 
September 2019, just before the pan-
demic transformed our world. While his 
official installation will take place on 
Saturday, March 5, Rabbi Posner offi-
cially became the senior rabbi of Beth 
Tfiloh Congregation and dean of the 
Beth Tfiloh Dahan Community School 
on January 1, 2022. 
Originally, from Brooklyn, he has 
been a member of the Beth Tfiloh cler-
gy since 2010 and is often described as 
‘‘wise beyond his years.’’ Rabbi Posner 
represents the next generation of lead-
ership in our community. He has a 
keen understanding of where the com-
munity has been and where we are 
heading. 
In a recent interview with local 
Jmore Baltimore Jewish Living, he de-
scribed the legacy he has taken on: 
‘‘One of the main reasons that Beth 
Tfiloh has been so successful is we have 
stayed true to our mission but have 
also adapted to the changing world 
around us. Rabbi Samuel Rosenblatt, 
Beth Tfiloh’s founding rabbi, was com-
mitted to tradition, modernity, Israel, 
education, children and women’s inclu-
sion. All of those look different today 
than they did 100 years ago, but it’s as-
tounding to see that we are still com-
mitted to all of these same principles.’’ 
The other part of this spiritual tran-
sition, along with Rabbi Posner, is 
Rabbi Mitchell Wohlberg, who held the 
position of senior rabbi for 43 years. He 
will serve in the position of rabbi-in- 
residence through December 2025. 
What 
can 
I 
say 
about 
Rabbi 
Wohlberg? He has been a friend and a 
counselor, a leader and guide for Beth 
Tfiloh Congregation and Baltimore 
over the course of four decades—for my 
family and me as well. 
Through his legendary sermons and 
community involvement, his moral 
leadership has inspired generations of 
community leaders. For 40-plus years, 
he has led our community through the 
most joyous and most painful moments 
in our lives, and everything in between. 
Through it all, he maintains, ‘‘we are 
supposed to serve God in joy.’’ 
As for those sermons—on every topic 
imaginable and then some—they stand 
as a legacy to Rabbi Wohlberg’s love of 
scripture, his faith, and the world as a 
whole. In one such sermon, he shared 
‘‘It is said that actions speak louder 
than words. That may be so but words 
carry a lot of weight. They are what 
makes us human.’’ 
Rabbi Wohlberg also has embodied 
the spirit of tikkun olam—repairing 
our world. I want to share one example 
among countless instances of how he 
has transformed the lives around him. 
A half-dozen years ago, Rev. Dr. 
Terris King of the Liberty Grace 
Church of God in Ashburton reached 
out to Rabbi Wohlberg in fellowship. 
This was a time when Baltimore was 
still healing from the death of Freddie 
Gray and some national leaders chose 
to attack Baltimore for their own per-
sonal gain. Rabbi Wohlberg and Dr. 
King connected over faith, shared com-
munity and shared history. Barely 5 
miles separates the two congregations, 
but as the two clergy have explained: 
‘‘In some ways, Ashburton and Pikes-
ville are in two different worlds. But 
the reality is, we are next-door neigh-
bors. Maryland’s recently maligned

seventh district reminds us that there 
are no barriers separating Baltimore 
City and Baltimore County; the only 
barriers are the ones we establish in 
our hearts. We have discovered that 
getting to know each other not only 
brings us closer, but helps us to learn 
from each other, to better understand 
each other’s lived experiences, and 
even to better understand ourselves.’’ 
The interfaith and interracial rela-
tionship between Beth Tfiloh and Lib-
erty Grace has grown stronger over the 
years, nurtured by Rabbi Wohlberg and 
Dr. King. Branded as ‘‘Building Bridges 
Across Baltimore,’’ volunteers from 
both communities have come together 
to provide fresh produce and meals to 
West Baltimore residents, renovate 
local schools, host local festivals and 
book fairs, promote reading and writ-
ing partnerships, and work together to 
reduce violence. This model of commu-
nity involvement has maintained its 
focus of ‘‘Working together to improve 
the education and health of Baltimore 
children and families [as] the only way 
we will improve the conditions of our 
city.’’ 
Throughout Rabbi Wohlberg’s four 
decades at Beth Tfiloh Congregation, I 
especially have been struck at how he 
has made the children of our congrega-
tion and our community a priority. 
During his tenure, the Beth Tfiloh 
Dahan Community School has grown in 
both size and reputation. 
Thanks in no small part to Rabbi 
Wohlberg’s determination and high ex-
pectations, in 2000, the school, which 
now serves children from preschool 
through high school, was named a Na-
tional Blue Ribbon School of Excel-
lence. It was 1 of 12 schools nationally 
to receive an award for its special em-
phasis in technology. 
On a very personal note, I am a third- 
generation member of Beth Tfiloh con-
gregation. Rabbi Wohlberg and I have 
been friends for years, and my children 
and grandchildren have attended the 
schools. He presided over the B’nai 
Mitzvahs of our children and the wed-
ding of my daughter. Rabbi Wohlberg is 
and will forever be an indelible part of 
my family history. 
As Beth Tfiloh congregation begins 
to write a new chapter in its century- 
long history, I want to extend my 
heartfelt congratulations and thanks 
to 
both 
Rabbi 
Posner 
and 
Rabbi 
Wohlberg. 
Transitions are not always easy, but 
these two spiritual and community 
leaders, who have worked side-by-side 
for so many years, have forged a path 
forward that celebrates past successes 
and has the community excited for the 
future. 
As it says in Ecclesiastes Chapter 3, 
‘‘to every thing there is a season, and a 
time to every purpose under the heav-
en.’’∑

TRIBUTE TO CAITLYN KNOWLES, 
BELLA 
DONOHUE, 
AND 
EMMA 
SUGHRUE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Caitlyn Knowles 
and Bella Donohue of Exeter and 
Emma Sughrue of Brentwood as Feb-
ruary’s Granite Staters of the Month. 
This trio led the Exeter High School 
girl’s hockey team in organizing this 
year’s ‘‘Stick it to Stigma’’ game, an 
initiative 
to 
promote 
discussions 
around student mental health and 
show teenagers that they are not alone. 
Exeter High School’s first ‘‘Stick it 
to Stigma’’ game was in 2017 and is 
now an annual tradition for the com-
munity to raise awareness about stu-
dents’ mental health. The event is in 
partnership with Connor’s Climb, an 
organization that provides suicide pre-
vention education to young people in 
New Hampshire. 
After last year’s event was downsized 
due 
to 
COVID–19, 
team 
captains 
Caitlyn, Emma, and Bella wanted this 
year’s event to bring the community 
together in a big way and to help re-
duce the stigma around mental health. 
The trio promoted the event to their 
classmates and shared the word both in 
school and over social media. The in-
credible size of the crowd on game day 
was evidence of their hard work in 
bringing people together and raising 
awareness about mental health. 
Spectators participated in a Chuck-a- 
Puck fundraiser to compete for raffle 
prize money, mingled with new and old 
friends, and cheered on the teams. Par-
ents, students, and former players also 
wore buttons and t-shirts with mes-
sages of support to raise awareness 
around mental health, and shared in-
formation with one another about men-
tal health resources. 
Caitlyn, Emma, and Bella are work-
ing to address mental health chal-
lenges and share the message that ‘‘it’s 
okay to not be okay,’’ a phrase that 
their coach often tells them. These 
young women showed enormous leader-
ship in organizing an event that helped 
bring their community together, all 
the while shining a spotlight on one of 
the 
most 
important 
issues 
facing 
young people today. They exemplify 
the Granite State spirit of tackling an 
issue head on to help others, and I com-
mend them for their efforts.∑

TRIBUTE TO D. BROCK HORNBY 
∑ Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize Judge D. Brock 
Hornby of Cape Elizabeth, ME. Last 
week, after more than 40 years of serv-
ice on both Maine’s State and Federal 
courts, Judge Hornby presided over his 
final proceeding at the U.S. District 
Court in Portland. I want to honor 
Judge 
Hornby’s 
incredible 
career, 
thank him for his service, and wish 
him well in this next chapter. 
Judge Hornby is a native of Mani-
toba, Canada, and earned his bachelor’s 
degree in English and history in Can-
ada before coming to the United States 
to attend Harvard Law School. The 
year after graduating from Harvard, 
Judge Hornby began teaching at my 
alma mater, the University of Virginia 
Law School—where I am certain he ob-
tained the wit and polish he would 
carry throughout his career. He moved 
to Maine in 1974, became a citizen, and 
began to practice law in Portland at 
Perkins, 
Thompson, 
Hinckley, 
and 
Keddy. 
In 1982, Judge Hornby became a U.S. 
magistrate judge, serving in Portland 
and Bangor until 1988. He then served 
on the Maine Supreme Judicial Court 
for 2 years. In 1990, President George 
H.W. Bush nominated him to the U.S. 
District Court, and the Senate con-
firmed him to this position by unani-
mous consent. At the district court, he 
served as chief judge from 1996 to 2003. 
During 
his 
distinguished 
career, 
Judge Hornby has presided over thou-
sands of criminal and civil cases. Some 
have grabbed headlines, others may 
only impact those involved, but in all 
his cases, his colleagues say that he 
brought a sense of fairness to the 
bench. Judge Hornby played a critical 
role in changing strict Federal sen-
tencing guidelines, allowing judges to 
use their discretion in sentencing the 
defendants before them. 
Through his career, Judge Hornby 
has been a fair and neutral arbiter of 
the law, offering respect to all who en-
tered his courtroom. While we will 
miss his insight, intellect, and experi-
ence on the bench, he has earned this 
retirement. I extend my best wishes to 
Judge Hornby and thank him again for 
his unwavering service—the State of 
Maine is lucky to call him one of our 
own.∑

70TH ANNIVERSARY OF MARINE 
CORPS LOGISTICS BASE ALBANY 
∑ Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, today 
let the Senate recognize the 70th anni-
versary of the Marine Corps Logistics 
Base in Albany, GA. 
For 70 years, Marines Corps Logistics 
Base Albany has provided critical sup-
port to its tenants, including the Ma-
rine Corps Logistics Command and Ma-
rine Depot Maintenance Command/Pro-
duction Plant Albany. 
Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany 
and its outstanding personnel provide 
the U.S. Marine Corps with advanced 
logistical capabilities vital to U.S. na-
tional security. 
Under the leadership of Col. Michael 
J. Fitzgerald, Mr. Leonard Housey, and 
Sgt. Maj. Auburne I. Edwards II, the 
base has been recognized for its leader-
ship in energy security. Last year, the 
Secretary of the Navy awarded the En-
ergy Excellence Award to Marine Corps 
Logistics Base Albany for its commit-
ment to energy security planning, cy-
bersecurity, and energy reduction. 
On behalf of the State of Georgia and 
the U.S. Senate, I express our heartfelt 
gratitude to each servicemember and 
civilian marine who has served at Ma-
rine Corps Logistics Base Albany.∑

part, as the basis for the commencement of 
an investigation described in such clause, to

‘‘(iv) No investigation described in clause 
(ii) (or hearing described in clause (vi) based 
on such investigation) may be conducted 
with respect to information about a failure 
to comply with the requirements under this 
subsection, unless the Secretary receives the 
information not later than 24 months after 
the date of the alleged failure. 
‘‘(v) Before commencing an investigation 
of an employer under clause (i) or (ii), the 
Secretary shall provide notice to the em-
ployer of the intent to conduct such inves-
tigation. The notice shall be provided in such 
a manner, and shall contain sufficient detail, 
to permit the employer to respond to the al-
legations before an investigation is com-
menced. The Secretary is not required to 
comply with this clause if the Secretary de-
termines that to do so would interfere with 
an effort by the Secretary to investigate or 
secure compliance by the employer with the 
requirements of this subsection. There shall 
be no judicial review of a determination by 
the Secretary under this clause. 
‘‘(vi) If the Secretary, after an investiga-
tion under clause (i) or (ii), determines that 
a reasonable basis exists to make a finding 
that the employer has failed to comply with 
the requirements under this subsection, the 
Secretary shall provide the interested par-
ties with notice of such determination and 
an opportunity for a hearing in accordance 
with section 556 of title 5, United States 
Code, not later than 120 days after the date 
of such determination. If such a hearing is 
requested, the Secretary shall make a find-
ing concerning the matter by not later than 
120 days after the date of the hearing. 
‘‘(vii) If the Secretary, after a hearing, 
finds a reasonable basis to believe that the 
employer has violated the requirements 
under this subsection, the Secretary shall 
impose a penalty under subparagraph (K). 
‘‘(viii)(I) The Secretary may conduct sur-
veys of the degree to which employers com-
ply with the requirements under this sec-
tion. 
‘‘(II) The Secretary shall— 
‘‘(aa) conduct annual compliance audits of 
not less than 1 percent of the employers that 
employ nonimmigrants described in section 
101(a)(15)(L) during the applicable fiscal 
year; 
‘‘(bb) conduct annual compliance audits of 
each employer with more than 100 employees 
who work in the United States if more than 
15 percent of such employees are non-
immigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(L); 
and 
‘‘(cc) make available to the public an exec-
utive summary or report describing the gen-
eral findings of the audits carried out pursu-
ant to this subclause. 
‘‘(ix) The Secretary is authorized to take 
other such actions, including issuing sub-
poenas and seeking appropriate injunctive 
relief and specific performance of contrac-
tual obligations, as may be necessary to as-
sure employer compliance with the terms 
and conditions under this paragraph. The 
rights 
and 
remedies 
provided 
to 
non-
immigrants described in section 101(a)(15)(L) 
under this paragraph are in addition to, and 
not in lieu of, any other contractual or stat-
utory rights and remedies of such non-
immigrants, and are not intended to alter or 
affect such rights and remedies.’’.

By Ms. HIRONO (for herself and 
Mr. MARKEY): 
S.J. Res. 40. A joint resolution for-
mally apologizing for the nuclear leg-
acy of the United States in the Repub-
lic of the Marshall Islands and affirm-
ing the importance of the free associa-
tion between the Government of the 
United States and the Government of 
the Marshall Islands; to the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce a resolution that af-
firms the importance of our compact of 
free association with the Republic of 
the Marshall Islands and apologizes to 
the people of the Republic of the Mar-
shall Islands on behalf of the U.S. Gov-
ernment for the United States’ nuclear 
testing program. I am thankful to Sen-
ator MARKEY for joining me in this res-
olution as we seek to strengthen the 
ties between the United States and the 
Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
After freeing what are now the Re-
public of the Marshall Islands from 
Japanese control during the Second 
World War, the United States was en-
trusted with administering the islands 
as a part of the United Nations Trust 
Territory of the Pacific Islands. Under 
the trusteeship, the United States was 
charged with promoting self-govern-
ment and the economic and edu-
cational advancement of the islands. 
The trusteeship also obligated the 
United States to protect the health of 
the inhabitants of the trust territory. 
President Harry Truman reaffirmed 
the United States’ ‘‘special responsi-
bility’’ for the people of the Republic of 
the Marshall Islands when he reassured 
the United Nations that the people of 
the Marshall Islands ‘‘will be accorded 
all rights which are the normal con-
stitutional rights of the citizens under 
the Constitution.’’ 
In many ways, the Government of 
the United States failed to live up to 
that special responsibility. From 1946 
to 1958, the United States conducted 67 
thermonuclear tests in the Marshall Is-
lands. The tests contaminated at least 
11 of the Marshall Island’s 29 atolls. 
These tests destroyed their land and 
led to their displacement. Nuclear test-
ing also exposed the Marshallese to ra-
dioactive fallout, contributing to in-
creased cancer rates, birth defects, and 
other serious health conditions. The 
nuclear testing program has caused ir-
reparable harm to the people of the Re-
public of the Marshall Islands. 
That harm and our collective failure 
to live up to our nation’s responsibil-
ities have similarly failed members of 
the Armed Forces and civilian contrac-
tors that were tasked by our govern-
ment with cleaning up nuclear waste in 
the Marshall Islands. In the 1970s, the 
United States sought to clean up 
Enewetak Atoll, where the United 
States conducted over 40 nuclear tests. 
In an effort to contain radioactive ma-
terial on Enewetak, members of the

Armed Forces and civilian contractors 
constructed the Runit Dome, an un-
lined nuclear waste containment struc-
ture that stores approximately 110,000 
cubic yards of radioactively contami-
nated soil and debris. Thousands of 
servicemembers were exposed to radi-
ation 
and 
nuclear 
waste 
as 
they 
worked to clean up Enewetak Atoll. 
To this day, those servicemembers 
remain ineligible for health benefits 
through the Department of Veterans 
Affairs that other ‘‘radiation-exposed 
veterans’’ receive. I am thankful to 
Senators SMITH and TILLIS for their 
leadership on this issue, as they seek 
to secure health benefits for these 
servicemembers 
through 
the 
Mark 
Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare 
Parity Act. 
The Republic of the Marshall Islands 
is one of the United States’ strongest 
allies and one of its most important 
partners in the Indo-Pacific region. 
Since entering into a Compact of Free 
Association with the United States in 
the 1980s, thousands of Marshallese 
have migrated to the United States to 
live and work. The Marshallese have 
made invaluable contributions to my 
home State of Hawaii and have en-
riched communities throughout the 
country. The compact also protects 
U.S. national security interests by pro-
viding the U.S. military with exclusive 
access to the territorial waters of the 
Marshall Islands and serves as host to 
the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile 
Defense Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll. 
While our relationship with the Re-
public of the Marshall Islands remains 
strong, they are in jeopardy. U.S. eco-
nomic assistance under the Compact of 
Free Association to the Marshall Is-
lands is set to end in 2023 while near- 
peer competitors threaten to under-
mine our alliances. Additionally, cli-
mate 
change 
poses 
an 
existential 
threat to the Republic of the Marshall 
Islands. 
But in order to continue on with our 
relationship with the Marshall Islands, 
we need to reckon with our past. The 
United States has never apologized for 
its nuclear testing program in the Mar-
shall Islands. The harm caused by the 
United States’ nuclear legacy in the 
Marshall Islands cannot be taken back 
or undone. But as the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands memorializes today, 
March 1, as Nuclear Victims Remem-
brance Day, we can show our contri-
tion and endeavor to build a stronger 
relationship based on correcting the 
wrongs of the past and strengthening 
the special ties that bind our two na-
tions.

CRAMER, Mr. GRASSLEY, Mrs. HYDE- 
SMITH, Mr. SCOTT
of Florida, Ms. 
ERNST, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. DAINES, and Mr. 
WICKER) submitted the following con-
current resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. CON. RES. 30 
Whereas 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council is tasked with upholding inter-
national peace and security among the coun-
tries of the world; 
Whereas the primary responsibility of the 
United Nations Security Council is to deter-
mine the existence of a threat to inter-
national peace or act of aggression and to 
recommend what necessary action should be 
taken; 
Whereas Article 39 of the Charter of the 
United Nations states that ‘‘The Security 
Council shall determine the existence of any 
threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or 
act of aggression and shall make rec-
ommendations, or decide what measures 
shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 
and 42, to maintain or restore international 
peace and security’’; 
Whereas 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council currently has five permanent mem-
bers: the United States of America, the 
United Kingdom, France, the People’s Re-
public of China, and the Russian Federation; 
Whereas the acts of aggression and malign 
influence by the Russian Federation and its 
proxies in Ukraine are a threat to the terri-
torial integrity and democratic sovereignty 
of Ukraine and run counter to both the letter 
and spirit of the Security Council’s responsi-
bility to maintain peace and security; 
Whereas the build-up of nearly 200,000 Rus-
sian Federation military troops, artillery, 
tanks, armor, and other military equipment 
on Ukraine’s border since March 2021 has sig-
nificantly threatened the safety, security, 
stability, and sovereignty of Ukraine and has 
destabilized the security of the continent of 
Europe; 
Whereas, on February 21, 2022, the Russian 
Federation 
deployed 
additional 
military 
forces into two Russian-declared separatist 
regions of eastern Ukraine, which are under 
Ukrainian government control; 
Whereas, on February 22, 2022, Russian 
Federation President Vladimir Putin recog-
nized the independence of the two Russian- 
backed 
separatist 
republics 
in 
eastern 
Ukraine, the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s 
Republics, and secured parliamentary au-
thorization to deploy additional Russian 
forces abroad, setting conditions for a fur-
ther offensive against Ukraine; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russian 
Federation 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin 
launched a well-coordinated disinformation 
campaign, announcing the start of a ‘‘special 
military operation’’ aimed at the ‘‘demili-
tarization and denazification of Ukraine’’ in 
order ‘‘to protect the people who have been 
abused by ‘the genocide’ of the Kyiv regime 
for 8 years’’; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the Russian 
Federation launched multiple unprovoked 
missile strikes in Kyiv, Ukraine, as well as 
in numerous key eastern Ukrainian cities, 
including Kharkiv, Odessa, Mariupol, Dnipro, 
and Kramatorsk, jeopardizing the safety of 
civilians and with the intent to strike 
Ukrainian military infrastructure, including 
airfields, military depots, air defenses, and 
command and control sites; and 
Whereas the increased aggression of the 
Russian Federation against the sovereignty 
of Ukraine has destabilized the security of 
the continent of Europe and could cause 
massive casualties, energy shortages, and fi-
nancial instability across the globe: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) condemns the Russian Federation’s in-
vasion of Ukraine’s sovereign territory and 
its ongoing support of proxy militias in the 
region, which together pose a direct threat 
to international peace and security and run 
contrary to its responsibilities and obliga-
tions as a permanent member of the United 
Nations Security Council; 
(2) urges the President to direct the United 
States representative to the United Nations 
to use the voice, vote, and influence of the 
United States to take all necessary steps to 
remove the Russian Federation as a Perma-
nent Member of the United Nations Security 
Council; and 
(3) urges other member states to support 
such efforts to hold the Russian Federation 
accountable at the United Nations by sup-
porting such efforts.

days 
ago—Russia’s 
Vladimir 
Putin sought to shake the foundations 
of the free world—thinking he could 
make it bend to his menacing ways. 
But 
he 
badly 
miscalculated. 
He 
thought he could roll into Ukraine— 
and the world would roll over. 
Instead—he met a wall of strength he 
never imagined. He met the Ukrainian 
people. From President Zelenskyy to 
every Ukrainian—their fearlessness— 
their courage—their determination— 
inspires the world. Groups of citizens 
blocking tanks with their bodies. Ev-
eryone from students to retirees— 
teachers 
turned 
soldiers—defending 
their homeland. 
In 
this 
struggle—as 
President 
Zelenskyy said in his speech to the Eu-
ropean Parliament—‘‘light will win 
over darkness.’’ 
The Ukrainian Ambassador to the 
United States is here tonight. Let each 
of us here tonight—in this Chamber— 
send 
an 
unmistakable 
signal 
to 
Ukraine and to the world. 
Please rise if you are able—and show 
that—YES—WE the United States of 
America—stand with the Ukrainian 
people. 
Throughout 
our 
history—we’ve 
learned this lesson—when dictators do 
not pay a price for their aggression— 
they cause more chaos. They keep 
moving. 
And 
the 
costs 
and 
the 
threats—to America and the world— 
keep rising. 
That’s why the NATO Alliance was 
created—to secure peace and stability 
in Europe after World War II. The 
United States is a member—along with 
29 other nations. It matters. American 
diplomacy matters. American resolve 
matters. 
Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was 
premeditated and unprovoked. He re-
jected repeated efforts at diplomacy. 
He thought the West—and NATO— 
wouldn’t respond. And he thought he 
could divide us at home. Putin was 
WRONG. We were ready. Here is what 
we did. 
We prepared—extensively and care-
fully. We spent months building a coa-
lition of other freedom-loving nations 
from—Europe and the Americas—to 
Asia and Africa—to confront Putin. 
I spent countless hours—unifying our 
European allies. We shared with the 
world—in 
advance—what 
we 
knew 
Putin was planning—and precisely how 
he would try to falsely justify his ag-
gression. We countered Russia’s lies 
with truth. 
And now that he has acted—the free 
world is holding him accountable. 
Along with—27 members of the Euro-
pean Union—including France, Ger-
many, 
Italy—as 
well 
as 
countries 
like—the United Kingdom—Canada— 
Japan—Korea—Australia—New 
Zea-
land, and many others—EVEN Switzer-
land—we are inflicting pain on Russia 
and supporting the people of Ukraine. 
Putin is now isolated from the world 
more than ever. 
Together with our allies—we are 
RIGHT NOW—enforcing powerful eco-
nomic sanctions. We are—cutting off 
Russia’s largest banks from the inter-
national financial system. Preventing 
Russia’s central bank from defending 
the Russian Ruble—making Putin’s 
$630 billion ‘‘war fund’’—worthless. We 
are choking off Russia’s access to tech-
nology that will sap its economic 
strength and weaken its military for 
years to come. 
Tonight—I 
say 
to 
the 
Russian 
oligarchs 
and 
corrupt 
leaders—who 
have bilked billions of dollars off this 
violent regime—NO MORE. 
The U.S. Department of Justice is as-
sembling a dedicated task force to go 
after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. 
We are joining with our European al-
lies to—find and seize—your yachts— 
your luxury apartments—your private 
jets. We are coming for your ill-begot-
ten gains. 
And tonight—I am announcing that 
we will join our allies in closing off 
American air space to ALL Russian 
flights—further isolating Russia—and 
adding an additional squeeze—on their 
economy. 
The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its 
value. The Russian stock market has 
lost 40 percent of its value and trading 
remains suspended. 
Russia’s 
economy 
is 
reeling—and 
Putin alone is to blame. 
Together with our allies—we are pro-
viding support to the Ukrainians in 
their fight for freedom. Military assist-
ance. Economic assistance. Humani-
tarian assistance. We are giving more 
than $1 billion in direct assistance to 
Ukraine. 
And we will continue to aid the 
Ukrainian people—as they defend their 
country and to help ease their suf-
fering. 
Let me be clear—our forces ARE NOT 
engaged and WILL NOT engage—in 
conflict 
with 
Russian 
forces 
in 
Ukraine. 
Our forces are NOT going to Europe 
to fight in Ukraine—but to DEFEND 
our NATO Allies—in the event that 
Putin decides to keep moving west. 
For that purpose—we’ve mobilized 
American—ground forces—air squad-
rons—and ship deployments to protect 
NATO countries—including—Poland— 
Romania—Latvia—Lithuania—and Es-
tonia. 
As I have made crystal clear—the 
United States and our Allies will de-
fend every inch of territory of NATO 
countries—with the full force of our 
collective power. 
And 
we 
remain 
clear-eyed. 
The 
Ukrainians are fighting back—with 
pure courage. But the next few—days— 
weeks—months—will be hard on them. 
Putin has unleashed violence and 
chaos. But while he may make gains on

the battlefield—he will pay a con-
tinuing high price over the long run. 
And a proud Ukrainian people—who 
have known 30 years of independence— 
have repeatedly shown—that they will 
not tolerate anyone who tries to take 
their country backwards. 
To all Americans—I will be honest 
with you—as I’ve always promised. 
A Russian dictator invading a foreign 
country has costs around the world. 
And I’m taking robust action to 
make sure the pain of our sanctions is 
targeted at Russia’s economy. 
And I will use every tool at our dis-
posal to protect American businesses 
and consumers. 
Tonight—I can announce that—the 
United States has worked with 30 other 
countries—to release 60 million barrels 
of oil—from reserves around the world. 
America will lead that effort—releas-
ing 30 million barrels from our own 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
And we stand ready—to do more if 
necessary—Unified with our allies. 
These steps will help blunt gas prices 
here at home. 
And I know the news about what’s 
happening can seem alarming. 
But I want you to know that—we’re 
going to be okay. 
When the history of this era is writ-
ten—Putin’s war on Ukraine will have 
left Russia weaker and the rest of the 
world stronger. 
While it shouldn’t have taken some-
thing so terrible for people around the 
world to see what’s at stake—now ev-
eryone sees it clearly. 
We see the unity among leaders of 
nations—and a more unified Europe—a 
more unified West. 
And we see unity among the people— 
who are gathering in cities in large 
crowds around the world—even in Rus-
sia—to demonstrate their support for 
Ukraine. 
In the battle between democracy and 
autocracy—democracies are rising to 
the moment—and the world is clearly 
choosing the side—of peace and secu-
rity. 
This is a real test. It’s going to take 
time. 
So—let us continue to draw inspira-
tion from the iron will of the Ukrain-
ian people. 
To our fellow Ukrainian Americans— 
who forge a deep bond that connects 
our two nations—we stand with you. 
Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks— 
but he will never gain the hearts and 
souls of the Ukrainian people. He will 
never extinguish their love of freedom. 
He will never weaken the resolve of the 
free world. 
We meet tonight—in an America that 
has lived through two of the hardest 
years this Nation has ever faced. 
The pandemic has been punishing. 
And so many families are living pay-
check to paycheck. 
Struggling to keep up with the rising 
cost 
of—food—gas—housing—and 
so 
much more. I understand. 
I remember when my Dad had to 
leave our home in Scranton, Pennsyl-
vania to find work. 
I grew up in a family—where if the 
price of food went up—you felt it. 
That’s why one of the first things I did 
as President was fight to pass the 
American Rescue Plan. Because people 
were hurting—we needed to act—and 
we did. Few pieces of legislation have 
done more—in a critical moment in our 
history—to lift us out of crisis. It 
fueled our efforts to—vaccinate the Na-
tion and combat COVID–19. It delivered 
immediate economic relief—for tens of 
millions of Americans. Helped put food 
on their tables—keep a roof over their 
heads—and cut the cost of health in-
surance. 
And as my Dad used to say—it gave 
people a little breathing room. 
And unlike the $2 trillion tax cut 
passed in the previous administration 
that benefitted the top 1 percent of 
Americans—the American Rescue Plan 
helped working people—and left no one 
behind. And it worked. It created jobs. 
Lots of jobs. 
In fact—our economy created over 6.5 
million new jobs just last year. More 
jobs created in 1 year than ever before. 
Our economy grew at a rate of 5.7 
percent 
last 
year—the 
strongest 
growth in nearly 40 years. 
The first step in bringing funda-
mental change to an economy that 
hasn’t worked for the working people 
of this Nation for too long. 
For the past 40 years—we were told 
that if we gave tax breaks to those at 
the very top—the benefits would trick-
le down to everyone else. 
But that trickle-down theory led to— 
weaker 
economic 
growth—lower 
wages—bigger deficits and the widest 
gap between those at the top and ev-
eryone else—in nearly a century. 
Vice President HARRIS and I ran for 
office—with a new economic vision for 
America. Invest in America. Educate 
Americans. Grow the workforce. Build 
the economy from the bottom up—and 
the middle out—not from the top down. 
Because we know that when the middle 
class grows—the poor have a ladder 
up—and the wealthy do very well. 
America used to have the best— 
roads—bridges—and airports on Earth. 
Now our infrastructure is ranked 13th 
in the world. We won’t be able to com-
pete for the jobs of the 21st Century— 
if we don’t fix that. 
That’s why it was so important to 
pass 
the 
Bipartisan 
Infrastructure 
Law—the most sweeping investment to 
rebuild America in history. This was a 
bipartisan effort—and I want to thank 
the members of both parties who 
worked to make it happen. 
We’re done talking about infrastruc-
ture weeks. We’re going to have an in-
frastructure decade. It is going to 
transform America. And put us on a 
path to win—the economic competition 
of the 21st Century that we face with 
the rest of the world—particularly with 
China. 
As I’ve told Xi Jinping—it is never a 
good bet to bet against the American 
people. We’ll create good jobs for mil-
lions of Americans—modernizing roads, 
airports, 
ports, 
and 
waterways—all 
across America. 
And we’ll do it all to withstand the 
devastating effects of the climate cri-
sis—and promote environmental jus-
tice. We’ll build—a national network of 
500,000 electric vehicle charging sta-
tions. Begin to replace—poisonous lead 
pipes—so every child—and every Amer-
ican—has clean water to drink at home 
and school. Provide affordable high- 
speed internet for every American— 
urban, suburban, rural, and tribal com-
munities. 4,000 projects have already 
been announced. 
And tonight—I’m announcing that 
this year—we will start fixing over 
65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 
bridges in disrepair. 
When we use taxpayer dollars to re-
build America—we are going to Buy 
American. Buy American products—to 
support American jobs. The Federal 
Government spends about $600 billion a 
year to keep the country safe and se-
cure. There’s been a law on the books 
for almost a century—to make sure 
taxpayers’ dollars support American 
jobs and businesses. 
Every administration says they’ll do 
it. But we’re actually doing it. We will 
buy American to make sure everything 
from the deck of an aircraft carrier—to 
the steel on highway guardrails—are 
made in America. 
But to compete for the best jobs of 
the future—we also need to level the 
playing field with China and other 
competitors. 
That’s why—it is so important to 
pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sit-
ting 
in 
Congress—that 
will 
make 
record investments in emerging tech-
nologies—and 
American 
manufac-
turing. 
Let me give you one example of 
why—it’s so important to pass it. If 
you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, 
Ohio—you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of 
land. It won’t look like much. But if 
you stop—and looked closely—you’ll 
see a ‘‘field of dreams’’. The ground on 
which America’s future will be built. 
This is where Intel—the American 
company that helped build Silicon Val-
ley—is going to build its $20 billion 
semiconductor ‘‘mega site’’. Up to 
eight state-of-the-art factories in one 
place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. 
Some of the most sophisticated manu-
facturing in the world—to make com-
puter chips the size of a fingertip—that 
power the world and our everyday 
lives. 
Smartphones. 
The 
Internet. 
Technology we have yet to invent. 
But—that’s just the beginning. 
Intel’s CEO—Pat Gelsinger—who is 
here tonight—told me they are ready 
to increase their investment from $20 
billion to $100 billion. That would be 
one of the biggest investments in man-
ufacturing in American history. 
And all they’re waiting for—is for 
you to pass this bill. 
So—let’s not wait any longer. Send it 
to my desk. I’ll sign it. And we will 
really take off. 
And Intel is not alone. There’s some-
thing happening in America. Just look

around—and you’ll see an amazing 
story. The rebirth of the pride that 
comes from stamping products ‘‘Made 
In America’’. The revitalization of 
American 
manufacturing—Companies 
are choosing to build new factories 
here—when just a few years ago—they 
would have built them overseas. 
That’s what is happening—Ford is in-
vesting $11 billion to build electric ve-
hicles—creating 11,000 jobs across the 
country. GM is making the largest in-
vestment in its history—$7 billion to 
build electric vehicles—creating 4,000 
jobs in Michigan. 
All told—we created 369,000 new man-
ufacturing jobs in America—just last 
year. Powered by people I’ve met—like 
JoJo 
Burgess—from 
generations 
of 
union 
steelworkers 
in 
Pittsburgh— 
who’s here with us tonight. 
As Ohio Senator SHERROD
BROWN 
says—‘‘It’s time to bury the label 
‘‘Rust Belt.’’ It’s time. 
But with all the bright spots in our 
economy—record job growth and high-
er wages—too many families are strug-
gling to keep up with the bills. Infla-
tion is robbing them of the gains they 
might otherwise feel. I get it. 
That’s why my top priority is getting 
prices under control. Look—our econ-
omy roared back faster than most pre-
dicted—but the pandemic meant that 
businesses had a hard time hiring 
enough workers to keep up production 
in their factories. 
The pandemic also disrupted global 
supply chains. When factories close—it 
takes longer to make goods and get 
them from the warehouse to the 
store—and prices go up. 
Look 
at 
cars. 
Last 
year—there 
weren’t 
enough 
semiconductors 
to 
make all the cars that people wanted 
to buy. And guess what—prices of auto-
mobiles went up. 
So—we have a choice. One way to 
fight inflation is to drive down wages 
and make Americans poorer. 
I have a better plan to fight infla-
tion. Lower your COSTS—not your 
wages. Make more cars and semi-
conductors in America. More infra-
structure and innovation—in America. 
More goods moving faster and cheap-
er—in America. More jobs where you 
can earn a good living—in America. 
And instead of relying on foreign sup-
ply chains—let’s make it in America. 
Economists call it—‘‘increasing the 
productive capacity of our economy.’’ I 
call it building a better America. 
My plan to fight inflation—will lower 
your costs and lower the deficit. 17 
Nobel laureates in economics say my 
plan will ease long-term inflationary 
pressures. Top business leaders and 
most 
Americans—support 
my 
plan. 
And here’s the plan. 
First—cut the cost of prescription 
drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten 
Americans has diabetes. In Virginia—I 
met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua 
Davis. He and his Dad both have Type 
1 diabetes—which means they need in-
sulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 
a vial to make. But drug companies 
charge families like Joshua and his 
Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with 
Joshua’s mom. Imagine what it’s like 
to—look at your child who needs insu-
lin and have no idea how you’re going 
to pay for it. What it does to your dig-
nity—your ability to look your child in 
the eye to be the parent you expect to 
be. 
Joshua is here with us tonight. Yes-
terday was his birthday. Happy birth-
day, buddy. For Joshua—and for the 
200,000 other young people with Type 1 
diabetes—let’s cap the cost of insulin 
at $35 a month so everyone can afford 
it. 
Drug companies will still do very 
well. And while we’re at it—let Medi-
care negotiate lower prices for pre-
scription drugs—like the VA already 
does. 
Look—the American Rescue Plan—is 
helping millions of families on Afford-
able Care Act plans—save $2,400 a year 
on their health care premiums. Let’s 
close the coverage gap and make those 
savings PERMANENT. 
Second—cut energy costs for fami-
lies—an average of $500 a year—by 
combatting climate change. 
Let’s provide investments and tax 
credits to weatherize your homes and 
businesses to be energy efficient and 
you get a tax credit, double America’s 
clean energy production in solar, wind, 
and so much more, and lower the price 
of electric vehicles—saving you an-
other $80 a month because you’ll never 
have to pay at the gas pump again. 
Third—cut the cost of child care. 
Many families pay up to $14,000 a year 
for child care per child. Middle-class 
and working families shouldn’t have to 
pay more than 7 percent of their in-
come for care of young children. 
My plan will cut the cost in half for 
most families—and help parents—in-
cluding millions of women—who left 
the workforce during the pandemic be-
cause they couldn’t afford child care— 
to be able to get back to work. 
My plan doesn’t stop there. It also in-
cludes home and long-term care. More 
affordable housing. And Pre-K for 
every 3- and 4-year-old. All of these 
will lower costs. 
And under my plan—nobody earning 
less than $400,000 a year—will pay an 
additional penny in new taxes. Nobody. 
The one thing all Americans agree on 
is that the tax system is NOT fair. We 
have to fix it. I’m not looking to pun-
ish anyone. But let’s make sure cor-
porations and the wealthiest Ameri-
cans—start paying their fair share. 
Just last year—55 Fortune 500 cor-
porations earned $40 billion in profits 
and paid zero dollars in Federal income 
tax. 
That’s simply not fair. That’s why 
I’ve proposed a 15 percent minimum 
tax rate for corporations. 
We got more than 130 countries to 
agree on a global minimum tax rate— 
so companies can’t get out of paying 
their taxes at home by shipping jobs 
and factories overseas. 
That’s why I’ve proposed—closing 
loopholes so the very wealthy—don’t 
pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or 
a firefighter. 
So—that’s my plan. It will grow the 
economy—and lower costs for families. 
So—what are we waiting for? Let’s 
get this done. 
And while you’re at it—confirm my 
nominees to the Federal Reserve— 
which plays a critical role in fighting 
inflation. 
My plan will not only lower costs to 
give families a fair shot—it will lower 
the deficit. 
The previous administration not only 
ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for 
the very wealthy and corporations—it 
undermined the watchdogs whose job 
was to keep pandemic relief funds from 
being wasted. 
But 
in 
my 
Administration—the 
watchdogs have been—welcomed back. 
We’re going after the criminals—who 
stole billions in relief money meant for 
small businesses and millions of Amer-
icans. 
And tonight—I’m announcing that 
the Justice Department will name a 
chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. 
By the end of this year—the deficit 
will be down to less than half what it 
was before I took office. The only 
President ever to cut the deficit by 
more than one trillion dollars in a sin-
gle year. 
Lowering your costs—also means de-
manding more competition. I’m a capi-
talist—but capitalism without com-
petition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploi-
tation—and it drives up prices. When 
corporations don’t have to compete— 
their profits go up—your prices go up— 
and small businesses—and family farm-
ers and ranchers—go under. We see it 
happening with ocean carriers moving 
goods in and out of America. 
During the pandemic, these foreign- 
owned companies raised prices by as 
much 
as 
1,000 
percent—and 
made 
record profits. 
Tonight—I’m announcing a crack-
down on these companies overcharging 
American businesses and consumers. 
And as Wall Street firms take over 
more nursing homes—quality in those 
homes has gone down—and costs have 
gone up. That ends on my watch. 
Medicare is going to set higher stand-
ards for nursing homes—and make sure 
your loved ones get the care they de-
serve and expect. 
We’ll also cut costs and keep the 
economy going strong—by giving work-
ers a fair shot—provide more training 
and apprenticeships—hire them based 
on their skills not degrees. 
Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act 
and paid leave. Raise the minimum 
wage to $15 an hour—and extend the 
Child Tax Credit—so no one has to 
raise a family in poverty. 
Let’s increase Pell Grants—and in-
crease our historic support of HBCUs— 
and invest in what Jill—our First Lady 
who teaches full-time—calls America’s 
best-kept secret—community colleges. 
And let’s pass the PRO Act—when a 
majority of workers want to form a 
union—they shouldn’t be stopped.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S894 
March 1, 2022 
When we invest in our workers— 
when we build the economy from the 
bottom up and the middle out—to-
gether—we 
can 
do 
something 
we 
haven’t done in a long time. Build a 
better America. 
For more than 2 years—COVID–19 has 
impacted every decision in our lives— 
and the life of the Nation. 
And 
I 
know 
you’re—tired—frus-
trated—and exhausted. 
But I also know this. Because of the 
progress we’ve made—because of your 
resilience—and the tools we have—to-
night—I can say—we are moving for-
ward safely back to more normal rou-
tines. 
We’ve reached a new moment in the 
fight against COVID–19—with severe 
cases down to a level not seen since 
last July. 
Just a few days ago—the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention—the 
CDC—issued 
new 
mask 
guidelines. 
Under 
these 
new 
guidelines—most 
Americans in most of the country—can 
now be mask free. 
And based on the projections—more 
of the country will reach that point 
across 
the 
next 
couple 
of 
weeks. 
Thanks to the progress we have made 
this past year—COVID–19 no longer 
controls our lives. I know some are 
talking about ‘‘living with COVID–19’’. 
Tonight—I say that we will never just 
accept living with COVID–19. We will 
continue to combat the virus—as we do 
other diseases. 
And because this is a virus that mu-
tates and spreads—we will stay on 
guard. 
Here are four common sense steps as 
we move forward safely. 
First—stay protected with vaccines 
and treatments. We know how incred-
ibly effective vaccines are. If you’re 
vaccinated and boosted you have the 
highest degree of protection. We will 
never give up on vaccinating more 
Americans. 
Now—I know parents with kids under 
5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized 
for their children. The scientists are 
working hard to get that done—and 
we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines 
when they do. 
We’re also ready with anti-viral 
treatments. If you get COVID–19—the 
Pfizer pill reduces your chances of end-
ing up in the hospital by 90 percent. 
We’ve ordered more of these pills than 
anyone in the world. 
And Pfizer is working overtime to 
get us 1 million pills this month—and 
more than double that next month. 
And—we’re launching the ‘‘Test to 
Treat’’ initiative so people can get 
tested at a pharmacy—and if they’re 
positive—receive antiviral pills on the 
spot at no cost. 
If 
you’re 
immunocompromised—or 
have 
some 
other 
vulnerability—we 
have treatments and free high-quality 
masks. We’re leaving no one behind—or 
ignoring anyone’s needs as we move 
forward. And on testing—we have made 
hundreds of millions of tests available 
for you to order for free. 
Even if you already ordered free 
tests—tonight—I am announcing that 
you 
can 
order 
more 
from 
COVIDTESTS.gov starting next week. 
Second—we must prepare for new 
variants. Over the past year—we’ve 
gotten much better at detecting new 
variants. If necessary—we’ll be able to 
deploy new vaccines within 100 days in-
stead of many more months or years. 
And—if Congress provides the funds we 
need—we’ll have new stockpiles of— 
tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. 
I cannot promise a new variant won’t 
come. But I can promise you we’ll do 
everything within our power to be 
ready if it does. 
Third—we can end the shutdown of 
schools and businesses. We have the 
tools we need. It’s time for Americans 
to get back to work—and fill our great 
downtowns again. People working from 
home—can feel safe to begin to return 
to the office. 
We’re doing that here in the Federal 
Government. The vast majority of Fed-
eral workers will once again work in 
person. 
Our schools are open—let’s keep it 
that way. Our kids need to be in 
school. 
And with 75 percent of adult Ameri-
cans fully vaccinated—and hospitaliza-
tions down by 77 percent—most Ameri-
cans—can remove their masks—return 
to work—stay in the classroom—and 
move forward safely. 
We achieved this because we pro-
vided—free 
vaccines—treatments— 
tests—and masks. 
Of 
course—continuing 
this 
costs 
money. I will soon send Congress a re-
quest. The vast majority of Americans 
have used these tools and may want to 
again—so I expect Congress to pass it 
quickly. 
Fourth—we will continue vaccinating 
the world. We’ve sent 475 million vac-
cine doses to 112 countries—more than 
any other nation. And we won’t stop. 
We have lost so much to COVID–19. 
Time with one another. And worst of 
all—so much loss of life. Let’s use this 
moment to re-set. Let’s stop looking at 
COVID–19—as a partisan dividing line— 
and see it for what it is—a God-awful 
disease. Let’s stop seeing each other as 
enemies—and start seeing each other 
for who we really are: fellow Ameri-
cans. 
We can’t change how divided we’ve 
been. But we can change how we move 
forward—on 
COVID–19—and 
other 
issues we must face together. 
I recently visited the New York City 
Police Department days after the fu-
nerals of Officer Wilbert Mora—and his 
partner—Officer Jason Rivera. They 
were responding to a 9–1–1 call—when a 
man shot and killed them with a stolen 
gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Of-
ficer Rivera was 22. Both Dominican 
Americans who’d grown up on the same 
streets they later chose to patrol as po-
lice officers. I spoke with their fami-
lies—and told them—that we are for-
ever in debt for their sacrifice—and we 
will carry on their mission to restore 
the trust and safety every community 
deserves. 
I’ve worked on these issues a long 
time. I know what works investing in 
crime prevention and community po-
lice officers—who’ll walk the beat— 
who’ll know the neighborhood and who 
can restore trust and safety. So let’s 
not abandon our streets. Or choose be-
tween safety and equal justice. Let’s 
come together to protect our commu-
nities—restore trust—and hold law en-
forcement accountable. 
That’s why the Justice Department 
required 
body 
cameras—banned 
chokeholds—and restricted no-knock 
warrants for its officers. That’s why 
the American Rescue Plan provided 
$350 billion that cities, States, and 
counties—can use to hire more police— 
and invest in proven strategies like 
community 
violence 
interruption— 
trusted messengers breaking the cycle 
of violence and trauma and giving 
young people hope. 
We should all agree—the answer is 
not to defund the police. The answer is 
to FUND the police—with the re-
sources and training they need to pro-
tect our communities. 
I ask Democrats and Republicans 
alike: Pass my budget and keep our 
neighborhoods safe. 
And I will keep doing everything in 
my power to crack down on gun traf-
ficking and ghost guns you can buy on-
line and make at home. They have no 
serial numbers—and can’t be traced. 
And I ask Congress to pass proven 
measures to reduce gun violence. Pass 
universal 
background 
checks. 
Why 
should anyone on a terrorist list be 
able to purchase a weapon? Ban assault 
weapons and high-capacity magazines. 
Repeal the liability shield that makes 
gun manufacturers the only industry 
in America that can’t be sued. These 
laws don’t infringe on the Second 
Amendment. They save lives. 
The 
most 
fundamental 
right 
in 
America is the right to vote—and have 
it counted. And it’s under assault. In 
State after State—new laws have been 
passed—not only to suppress the vote— 
but to subvert entire elections. We can-
not let this happen. 
Tonight—I call on the Senate to: 
Pass the Freedom to Vote Act; Pass 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Act; and 
while you’re at it—pass the Disclose 
Act—so Americans can know who is 
funding our elections. 
Tonight—I’d like to honor someone 
who has dedicated his life to serve this 
country—Justice Stephen Breyer—an 
Army veteran—Constitutional schol-
ar—and retiring Justice of the United 
States Supreme Court. 
Justice Breyer—thank you for your 
service. 
One of the most serious constitu-
tional 
responsibilities 
a 
President 
has—is nominating someone to serve 
on the United States Supreme Court. 
And I did that 4 days ago—when I nom-
inated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S895 
March 1, 2022 
One of our Nation’s top legal minds 
who will continue Justice Breyer’s leg-
acy of excellence. A former top liti-
gator in private practice. A former 
Federal public defender. And from a 
family of—public school educators and 
police officers—a consensus builder. 
Since she’s been nominated—she’s re-
ceived a broad range of support—from 
the Fraternal Order of Police to former 
judges appointed by Democrats and Re-
publicans. 
And if we are to advance liberty and 
justice—we need to secure the border 
and fix the immigration system. We 
can do both. 
At our border—we’ve installed new 
technology—like 
cutting-edge 
scan-
ners—to better detect drug smuggling. 
We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico 
and Guatemala to catch more human 
traffickers. We’re putting in place dedi-
cated immigration judges so families 
fleeing persecution and violence can 
have their cases heard faster. We’re se-
curing commitments and supporting 
partners in South and Central America 
to host more refugees and secure their 
own borders. 
We can do all this while keeping lit 
the torch of liberty that has led gen-
erations of immigrants to this land— 
my forefathers and so many of yours. 
Provide a pathway to citizenship—for 
Dreamers—those on temporary sta-
tus—farm 
workers—and 
essential 
workers. 
Revise our laws—so businesses have 
the workers they need and families 
don’t wait decades to reunite. It’s not 
only the right thing to do—it’s the eco-
nomically smart thing to do. 
That’s why immigration reform is 
supported 
by—everyone 
from 
labor 
unions to religious leaders to the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce. Let’s get it 
done once and for all. 
Advancing liberty and justice also re-
quires protecting the rights of women. 
The constitutional right affirmed in 
Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for 
half a century—is under attack—as 
never before. If we want to go for-
ward—not backward—we must protect 
access to health care. Preserve a wom-
an’s right to choose. And let’s continue 
to advance maternal health care in 
America. 
And for our LGBTQ+ Americans— 
let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality 
Act to my desk. The onslaught of State 
laws targeting transgender Americans 
and their families is WRONG. As I said 
last year—especially to our younger 
transgender Americans—I will always 
have your back as your President—so 
you can be yourself—and reach your 
God-given potential. 
While it often appears that we never 
agree—that isn’t true. 
I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law 
last year. From preventing government 
shutdowns. To protecting Asian-Ameri-
cans 
from—still-too-common 
hate 
crimes. To reforming military justice. 
And soon—we’ll strengthen the Vio-
lence Against Women Act that I first 
wrote three decades ago. 
It is important for us to show the Na-
tion that we can come together and do 
big things. 
So—tonight I’m offering a Unity 
Agenda for the Nation. Four big things 
we can do together. 
First—beat 
the 
opioid 
epidemic. 
There is so much we can do. Increase 
funding 
for—prevention—treatment— 
harm reduction—and recovery. Get rid 
of outdated rules that stop doctors 
from prescribing treatments. 
And stop the flow of illicit drugs by 
working with State and local law en-
forcement to go after traffickers. 
If you’re suffering from addiction— 
know you are not alone. I believe in re-
covery—and I celebrate the 23 million 
Americans in recovery. 
Second—let’s take on mental health. 
Especially among our children whose 
lives and education have been turned 
upside down. The American Rescue 
Plan gave schools money to hire teach-
ers and help students make up for lost 
learning. I urge every parent to make 
sure your school does just that. And we 
can all play a part. Sign up to be a 
tutor or a mentor. 
Children were also struggling before 
the 
pandemic. 
Bullying—violence— 
trauma—and 
the 
harms 
of 
social 
media. As Frances Haugen—who is here 
with us tonight—has shown we must 
hold social media platforms account-
able 
for 
the 
national 
experiment 
they’re conducting on our children—for 
profit. 
It’s time to—strengthen privacy pro-
tections—ban targeted advertising to 
children—demand tech companies stop 
collecting personal data on our chil-
dren. 
And let’s get all Americans the men-
tal health services they need. More 
people they can turn to for help and 
full parity between physical and men-
tal health care. 
Third—support our veterans. Vet-
erans are the best of us. I’ve always be-
lieved that—we have a sacred obliga-
tion to equip all those we send to war— 
and care for them and their families 
when they come home. 
My Administration is providing as-
sistance with job training and housing 
—and now helping lower-income vet-
erans get VA care debt-free. 
Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan 
faced many dangers. One was being sta-
tioned at bases—and breathing in— 
toxic smoke from ‘‘burn pits’’ that in-
cinerated—wastes of war—medical and 
hazard material, jet fuel, and more. 
When they came home many of the 
world’s fittest and best trained war-
riors were never the same. 
Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness. A 
cancer that would put them in a flag- 
draped coffin. I know. One of those sol-
diers was my Major Beau Biden. We 
don’t know for sure if a burn pit was 
the cause of his brain cancer or the dis-
eases of so many of our troops. But I’m 
committed to finding out everything 
we can. Committed to military fami-
lies like Danielle Robinson from Ohio, 
the widow of Sergeant First Class 
Heath Robinson. He was born a soldier. 
Army National Guard. Combat medic 
in Kosovo and Iraq. Stationed near 
Baghdad just yards from burn pits the 
size of football fields. 
Heath’s widow Danielle is here with 
us tonight. They loved going to Ohio 
State football games. He loved building 
Legos with their daughter. But cancer 
from prolonged exposure to burn pits 
ravaged 
Heath’s 
lungs 
and 
body. 
Danielle says Heath was a fighter to 
the very end. He didn’t know how to 
stop fighting—and neither did she. 
Through her pain—she found purpose— 
to demand we do better. 
Tonight—Danielle—we are. 
The VA is pioneering new ways of 
linking toxic exposures to diseases—al-
ready helping more veterans get bene-
fits. 
And tonight—I’m announcing we’re 
expanding eligibility to veterans suf-
fering from nine respiratory cancers. 
I’m also calling on Congress—Pass a 
law to make sure veterans devastated 
by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghani-
stan finally get the benefits and com-
prehensive health care they deserve. 
And fourth—let’s end cancer as we 
know it. 
This is personal to me and Jill—to 
KAMALA and to so many of you. Cancer 
is the #2 cause of death in America— 
second only to heart disease. 
Last month—I announced our plan to 
supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that 
President Obama asked me to lead 6 
years ago. 
Our goal is to—cut the cancer death 
rate by at least 50 percent over the 
next 25 years. 
Turn more cancers from death sen-
tences into treatable diseases. More 
support for patients and families. 
To get there—I call on Congress to 
fund ARPA–H—the Advanced Research 
Projects Agency for Health. 
It’s based on DARPA—the Defense 
Department project that led to the 
Internet, GPS, and so much more. 
ARPA–H will have a singular pur-
pose—to drive breakthroughs in can-
cer—Alzheimer’s—diabetes—and more. 
A unity agenda for the Nation. We 
can do this. 
My fellow Americans—tonight—we 
have gathered in a sacred space—The 
citadel of our democracy. In this Cap-
itol—generation 
after 
generation— 
Americans have debated great ques-
tions amid great strife—and have done 
great things. 
We have fought for freedom. Ex-
panded 
liberty. 
Defeated 
totali-
tarianism and terror. And built the— 
Strongest. Freest. And most pros-
perous Nation the world has ever 
known. 
Now is the hour. Our moment of re-
sponsibility. Our test of resolve and 
conscience—Of history itself. 
It is in this moment that our char-
acter is formed. Our purpose is found. 
Our future is forged. Well—I know this 
Nation—we will meet the test. 
To protect freedom and liberty. To 
expand fairness and opportunity. We 
will save democracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S896 
March 1, 2022 
As hard as these times have been—I 
am more optimistic about America 
today than I have been my whole life. 
Because I see the future that is with-
in our grasp. 
Because I know there is simply noth-
ing beyond our capacity. 
We are the only nation on Earth that 
has always turned every crisis we have 
faced into an opportunity. 
The only nation that can be defined 
by a single word: Possibilities. 
So on this night—in our 246th year as 
a Nation—I have come to report on the 
State of the Union. 
And my report is this: the State of 
the Union is strong—because you—the 
American people—are strong. 
We are stronger today—than we were 
a year ago. 
And we will be stronger a year from 
now than we are today. 
Now is our moment—to meet and— 
overcome the challenges—of our time. 
And we will. 
As One People. 
One America. 
The United States of America. 
May God bless you all. May God pro-
tect our troops.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

f 
STRENGTHENING AMERICAN 
CYBERSECURITY ACT OF 2022 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
on something that is very important to 
this country, Senator PETERS, in a 
minute, 
will 
move 
to 
pass 
the 
Strengthening American Cybersecurity 
Act. 
As we all know, protecting America— 
our government, our businesses, our 
utilities, and so many of our entities— 
from cyber attack has been very, very 
important over the last decade. It be-
comes even more important now. As 
the war in Ukraine goes on and as 
Putin mounts his illegal, immoral, and 
unprovoked attack, he is escalating 
cyber attacks on democracies around 
the world. So, as the need to protect 
this country from cyber attack is al-
ways very, very, very important, it has 
assumed even greater importance now 
with Putin’s fighting in Ukraine and 
threatening cyber attacks throughout 
the world. 
Today, the Senate is taking an ur-
gently needed step to protect the 
American people, American critical in-
frastructure, and American Govern-
ment institutions from the dangerous 
threat of cyber attacks. The most im-
portant part of this provision will re-
quire our companies—our individual 
businesses—to report cyber attacks 
when they occur. 
There has been a reluctance on the 
part of many in the business commu-
nity to want to do this because it may 
expose them to other kinds of harm, 
and maybe the public will not want to 
be involved in these businesses, but the 
importance of the reporting is vital. 
When our authorities in the govern-
ment know of the attacks, they can 
prepare against future attacks. They 
will know who is attacking, where they 
are attacking, and how they are at-
tacking. That will allow them to 
strengthen our defenses against future 
cyber attacks. So this knowledge of 
cyber attacks, caused by foreign enti-
ties or domestic entities, is vital as 
America seeks to protect itself. 
This legislation has been around for a 
while. For too long, certain business 
interests opposed it, but now they have 
come to see the light, and, in fact, we 
have a bipartisan agreement—unani-
mous in this Chamber—that this bill 
move forward. That is very important 
for America’s security. It is more im-
portant than it ever has been. Cyber 
warfare is truly one of the dark arts— 
specialized by Putin and his authori-
tarian regime—and this bill will help 
to protect us from Putin’s attempted 
cyber attacks against our country. 
Last year, I asked Chairman PETERS 
and other relevant committee chairs to 
draft legislation to counter the in-
creased threat, and Senator PETERS 
has done an outstanding job. I want to 
commend him and Senator PORTMAN 
and so many others—Senator WARNER 
among them—for being heavily in-
volved in this issue. 
Tonight, we will pass legislation by 
unanimous consent. When this legisla-
tion passes and is signed into law, 
America will be a safer place from one 
of the greatest scourges we worry 
about—cyber attack. I am glad we are 
doing this, and I am glad both sides 
have agreed. 
I yield to Senator PETERS, who, as I 
said, as chair of the HSGAC Com-
mittee, has done a terrific job in shep-
herding this legislation through the 
Senate.

ator from Michigan.

S897 
March 1, 2022 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 265, S. 3600. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3600) to improve the cybersecu-
rity of the Federal Government, and for 
other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Wicker 
and Peters amendments, which are at 
the desk, be considered and agreed to; 
that the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 4954) was agreed 
to, as follows: 
(Purpose: To improve the bill) 
On page 18, strike line 10 and insert the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘agency.

issue to such covered entity a subpoena to 
compel disclosure of information the Direc-
tor deems necessary to determine whether a 
covered cyber incident or ransom payment 
has occurred and obtain the information re-
quired to be reported pursuant to section 
2242 and any implementing regulations, and 
assess potential impacts to national secu-
rity, economic security, or public health and 
safety.

TITLE III—FEDERAL SECURE CLOUD 
IMPROVEMENT AND JOBS ACT OF 2022 
SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Federal Se-
cure Cloud Improvement and Jobs Act of 
2022’’. 
SEC. 302. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Ensuring that the Federal Government 
can securely leverage cloud computing prod-
ucts and services is key to expediting the 
modernization of legacy information tech-
nology systems, increasing cybersecurity 
within and across departments and agencies, 
and supporting the continued leadership of 
the United States in technology innovation 
and job creation. 
(2) According to independent analysis, as of 
calendar year 2019, the size of the cloud com-
puting market had tripled since 2004, ena-
bling more than 2,000,000 jobs and adding 
more than $200,000,000,000 to the gross domes-
tic product of the United States. 
(3) The Federal Government, across mul-
tiple presidential administrations and Con-
gresses, has continued to support the ability 
of agencies to move to the cloud, including 
through— 
(A) President Barack Obama’s ‘‘Cloud First 
Strategy’’; 
(B) President Donald Trump’s ‘‘Cloud 
Smart Strategy’’; 
(C) the prioritization of cloud security in 
Executive Order 14028 (86 Fed. Reg. 26633; re-
lating to improving the nation’s cybersecu-
rity), which was issued by President Joe 
Biden; and 
(D) more than a decade of appropriations 
and authorization legislation that provides 
agencies with relevant authorities and ap-
propriations to modernize on-premises infor-
mation technology systems and more readily 
adopt cloud computing products and serv-
ices. 
(4) Since it was created in 2011, the Federal 
Risk and Authorization Management Pro-
gram 
(referred 
to 
in 
this 
section 
as 
‘‘FedRAMP’’) at the General Services Ad-
ministration has made steady and sustained 
improvements in supporting the secure au-
thorization and reuse of cloud computing 
products and services within the Federal 
Government, including by reducing the costs 
and burdens on both agencies and cloud com-
panies to quickly and securely enter the Fed-
eral market. 
(5) According to data from the General 
Services Administration, as of the end of fis-
cal year 2021, there were 239 cloud providers 
with FedRAMP authorizations, and those au-
thorizations had been reused more than 2,700 
times across various agencies. 
(6) Providing a legislative framework for 
FedRAMP and new authorities to the Gen-
eral Services Administration, the Office of 
Management and Budget, and Federal agen-
cies will— 
(A) improve the speed at which new cloud 
computing products and services can be se-
curely authorized; 
(B) enhance the ability of agencies to effec-
tively evaluate FedRAMP authorized pro-
viders for reuse; 
(C) reduce the costs and burdens to cloud 
providers seeking a FedRAMP authorization; 
and 
(D) provide for more robust transparency 
and dialogue between industry and the Fed-
eral Government to drive stronger adoption 
of secure cloud capabilities, create jobs, and 
reduce wasteful legacy information tech-
nology. 
SEC. 303. TITLE 44 AMENDMENTS.

Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, S. 3600 
is commonsense, bipartisan legislation 
that will help protect critical infra-
structure from the absolute relentless 
cyber attacks that we see that threat-
en both our economy as well as our na-
tional security. 
I appreciate Senator PORTMAN work-
ing with me to get this legislation 
across the finish line. And I think this 
is especially important right now as we 
face increased risk of cyber attacks 
from Russia and the cyber criminals 
that they harbor in retaliation for our 
support for Ukraine. 
I appreciate the Senate for coming 
together here tonight to get this im-
portant landmark bill done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, just 
one more point. 
As we have always said, we in the 
Democratic majority want to work 
with our Republican colleagues on bi-
partisan legislation whenever we can, 
and this is an example of that. 
Obviously, there are times when we 
can’t, and we will move forward. But 
the more we can get done and accom-
plished in a bipartisan way on impor-
tant legislation like this, the better. 
So, once again, let me salute the bi-
partisan coalition led by GARY PETERS 
and ROB PORTMAN and so many others 
on both sides of the aisle who contrib-
uted to this very important legislation. 
f 
ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MARCH 
2, 2022

dissolution of the joint session, the 
Senate 
adjourn 
until 
11 
a.m. 
on 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022; that fol-
lowing the prayer and the pledge, the 
morning hour be deemed expired, the 
Journal of proceedings be approved to 
date, the time for the two leaders be 
reserved for their use later in the day, 
and morning business be closed; that 
upon conclusion of morning business, 
the Senate resume consideration of 
Calendar No. 273, H.R. 3076, the Postal 
Service Reform Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

Union. 
If there is no further business to 
come before the Senate, I ask that it 
recess under the previous order. 
Thereupon, the Senate, at 6:23 p.m., 
recessed until 8:30 p.m. and reassem-
bled when called to order by the Presi-
dent pro tempore.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
JOHN 
C. 
FLETCHER, THE ANCIENT ORDER 
OF HIBERNIANS PAUL ‘‘HOOK’’ 
O’MALLEY MAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor John C. Fletcher, who will be named 
the Man of the Year by the Ancient Order of 
Hibernians Paul ‘‘Hook’’ O’Malley Division 4 at 
their annual gathering on March 1, 2022. 
John, the son of the late Elizabeth Charles 
and Bill E. Fletcher, was born on April 2, 1955 
in Niagara Falls, New York. He, along with his 
three siblings, Bob, Linda, and Beth, attended 
Niagara Falls schools. In 1972, Bill moved his 
family to Scranton where he opened Fletcher’s 
Hilltop Garage on Jackson Street. John grad-
uated from Scranton High School as a mem-
ber of the Class of 1972, and in 1973, he en-
listed in the Army, earning the rank of spe-
cialist E4. 
Following an honorable discharge from the 
Army in 1977, John enrolled at Lackawanna 
Junior College and earned an associate de-
gree in business management. He put his de-
gree to work by helping his father run the fam-
ily gas station. John was then offered a posi-
tion at Tobyhanna Army Depot where he was 
employed for 11 years. 
With retirement on the horizon for his father, 
John resigned from Tobyhanna Army Depot to 
return to the family business in 1989. He kept 
the family business running with his brother, 
Bob, and, this year, the garage will celebrate 
its 50th anniversary of servicing vehicles in 
West Scranton. 
John has always been an active member of 
his community, generously lending his time 
and talents to many organizations to support 
their mission. He is a former parishioner of St. 
David’s Church and currently attends St. Pat-
rick’s Church in West Scranton where he is 
also a member of the Holy Name Society. He 
has been a longtime supporter of youth sports, 
volunteering his time to Little League baseball 
and the Trips Park Miss E League. John is a 
member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles and 
a 30–year member of the Scranton Pool 
League. John has also served three decades 
as a judge of elections. Seeking to connect 
with his Irish heritage, he joined with his fellow 
Irish American Scrantonians to charter the An-
cient 
Order 
of 
Hibernians 
Paul 
‘‘Hook’’ 
O’Malley Division 4. Throughout the history of 
the Division, he has held many offices and is 
the current Shillelagh Man of the Year. His 
brothers in the Division recognize him as a 
dedicated and beloved member who would do 
anything for his fellow members or community 
at large. 
John is the proud father of five children, 
Nina, Jonathan, Matt, Megan, and Ryan. He is 
known for being a loving father, a loyal friend, 
and for caring deeply about his fellow citizens. 
I am honored to join with the Ancient Order 
of Hibernians Paul ‘‘Hook’’ O’Malley Division 4 
in recognizing John as the Man of the Year. 
Selfless and hard-working Americans like John 
make our region a better place to live and 
work, and I am grateful for his service to his 
country and his community.

HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE 
SUMGAIT POGROMS 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, as the world 
contends with multiple crises—from Ukraine to 
Yemen to Afghanistan and so many others— 
I feel it is important to pause and take time 
today to remember what is at stake and re-
mind ourselves why our fight for a peaceful 
world free of violence, discrimination, and hate 
is so important. 
February 27th to the 29th marks the 34th 
anniversary of the Sumgait Pogrom which took 
place during the collapse of the Soviet Union 
in the Azerbaijan SSR. The massacres—part 
of a wider tragic history of intercommunal con-
flict 
between 
ethnic 
Armenians 
and 
Azerbaijanis—marked one of the first major 
outbreaks of ethnic-based violence as the 
USSR began to disintegrate. 
On this, the 34th anniversary, our world still 
struggles with the evils of war, nationalism and 
unjustifiable hatred. I take, and encourage all 
my colleagues to take, this opportunity to re-
commit my pledge to do all I can to ensure 
that events like the never again occur. 
We have a lot of work to do. Let’s move for-
ward more committed than ever for the fight 
for a peaceful world rooted in a love for all 
people.

Amor 
Fernandez for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Amor Fernandez is a student at Arvada 
High School and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Amor 
Fernandez is exemplary of the type of 
achievement that can be attained with hard 
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of 
their education and develop a work ethic 
which will guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Amor Fernandez for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt she will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments.

CONGRATULATING 
ROCHELLE 
‘‘BUBBI’’ BERMAN ON HER 90TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. BYRON DONALDS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to extend my sincerest congratulations 
in honor of Rochelle Berman, affectionately 
known by her family as ‘‘Bubbi,’’ who recently 
celebrated her 90th birthday. Born on Novem-
ber 3, 1931 to Jacob and Rose Sattler, Ro-
chelle was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin 
alongside her brother, Robert ‘‘Bobby’’ Sattler, 
a World War II veteran. Rochelle graduated 
from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 
1953 and became a teacher for the 3rd and 
4th grades. 
In 1956, Rochelle met her future husband 
Alexander (Al) Berman. After a first date to 
Disneyland, Rochelle and Alexander were 
later married on July 14, 1957. Rochelle and 
Al had 3 children together: James (Jimmy), 
Janet, and Gary. Rochelle is the matriarch of 
the Berman family: grandmother to 11 and 
great-grandmother (or ‘‘Bibi’’) to 3. Jimmy and 
his late wife Marla had three kids together: Al-
lison, Leigh, and David. Jimmy went on to 
marry Jayne and welcomed Lauren and Lexi 
into the family. Janet built a family with Jay 
Miller and together they have three children: 
Tova, Ezra, and Miriam; two sons-in-law: 
Shmuelli and Zevy; and three grandchildren:

together they had Mia, Josie, and Elliot. Ro-
chelle’s family continues to grow, with Ezra’s 
recent engagement to Ariella. And of course, 
we can’t forget Rochelle’s love of dogs and 
her furry family members, past and present: 
Buddy, Oscar, Sunny, B.J., Cooper, Bailey, 
Becker, and Hercules. 
Splitting time between Marco Island, Florida, 
in my district, and Mequon, Wisconsin, Ro-
chelle has lived a life filled with love, friends, 
and family. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues in the U.S. House of Representatives 
to join me in honoring an outstanding citizen, 
mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and 
cherished friend, Ms. Rochelle Berman, for the 
inspiring life that she leads. We extend our 
best wishes to her as she, her family, and

RECOGNIZING YANINA NICKLESS 
AS STATE OF THE UNION GUEST 
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE 
OF MAINE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor Yanina Nickless, who is my in-
vited guest for President Biden’s 2022 State of 
the Union address. Yanina lives in my district, 
but her family is home in Ukraine fighting for 
their lives and for democracy amid Russian in-
vasion. 
For the past week, Vladimir Putin has at-
tempted to violently overthrow a sovereign de-
mocracy. But it’s the countless examples of 
courage by Ukrainians like Yanina’s family that 
has united the free world—rallying behind de-
mocracy 
and 
against 
autocracy—as 
the 
Ukraine people defend their homeland. As 
Yanina told me, ‘‘Every day I wake up, I hope 
my parents wake up too. I’m staying strong for 
them and for my country and I believe in the 
USA and in the world. Thank you, Congress-
woman PINGREE and President Biden, for not 
being silent and for supporting a democracy in 
Ukraine. Ukrainians will never forget.’’ 
It is truly an honor to have Yanina join me 
tonight as President Biden further unites our 
nation with his State of the Union address. 
Yanina and her family’s heartbreaking story 
deserves to be heard on the global stage— 
joining a chorus of courage in the fight for 
freedom. Under President Biden’s leadership, 
the U.S. stands firmly against Russia’s 
unprovoked war.

WELCOME HOME VETERANS DAY 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA

Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and include 
in the RECORD a proclamation from the County 
Commission of Fall River County, South Da-
kota, designating March 29, 2022, as ‘‘Wel-
come Home Veterans Day.’’ 
A PROCLAMATION DESIGNATING MARCH 29, 
2022, AS ‘‘WELCOME HOME VETERANS DAY’’ 
(By Fall River County Commission) 
Whereas, the Vietnam War was fought in 
Vietnam from 1961 to 1975, and involved 
North Vietnam and the Viet Cong in conflict 
with the United States Armed Forces and 
South Vietnam; and 
Whereas, the United States became in-
volved in Vietnam because policymakers in 
the United States believed that if South 
Vietnam fell to a Communist government 
then Communism would spread throughout 
the rest of Southeast Asia; and 
Whereas, members of the United States 
Armed Forces began serving in an advisory 
role in the South Vietnamese in 1961; and 
Whereas, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin 
incidents on August 2, 1964, and August 4, 
1964, Congress overwhelmingly passed the 
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7, 1964, 
which effectively handed over war-making 
powers to President Johnson until such time 
as ‘‘peace and security’’ had returned to 
Vietnam; and 
Whereas, in 1965, United States Armed 
Forces completed the withdrawal of combat 
troops from Vietnam; and 
Whereas, by the end of 1965, there were 
80,000 United States troops in Vietnam, and 
by 1969 a peak of approximately 543,000 
troops was reached; and 
Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of 
Paris was signed, which required the release 
of all United States prisoners-of-war held in 
North Vietnam and the withdrawal of all 
United States Armed Forces from South 
Vietnam; and 
Whereas, on March 29, 1973, the United 
States Armed Forces completed the with-
drawal of all United States Armed Forces 
from South Vietnam; and 
Whereas, more than 58,000 members of the 
United States Armed Forces lost their lives 
in Vietnam and more than 300,000 members 
of the Armed Forces were wounded; and 
Whereas, members of the United States 
Armed Forces, who served bravely and faith-
fully for the United States during the Viet-
nam War, were caught upon their return 
home in the crossfire of public debate about 
the involvement of the United States in the 
Vietnam War; and 
Whereas, it was also the first time in his-
tory America failed to welcome its veterans 
back as heroes; and 
Whereas, the establishment of a ‘‘Welcome 
Home Vietnam Veterans Day’’ would be an 
appropriate way to honor those members of 
the United States Armed Forces who served 
in Vietnam during the Vietnam War; and 
Whereas, Hot Springs, SD, in Fall River 
County is known as the Veterans Town; and 
Now, therefore be it resolved that the Fall 
River County Commissioners do hereby rec-
ognize March 29, 2022, as ‘‘Welcome Home 
Vietnam Veterans Day.’’ The Fall River 
County Commissioners further honors and 
recognizes the contributions of veterans of 
the Armed Forces who served in Vietnam.’’

HONORING UNITED STATES ARMY 
SERGEANT HOWARD R. BELDEN 
FOR HIS BRAVE SACRIFICE AT 
THE BATTLE OF CHOSIN RES-
ERVOIR 
DURING 
THE 
KOREAN 
WAR 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of United States Army Ser-
geant Howard R. Belden. At the age of nine-
teen, Sergeant Belden gave his life in service 
to this nation at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir 
during the Korean War. After nearly seventy- 
one years, Sergeant Belden’s remains were 
accounted for on October 14, 2021. 
Sergeant Belden was born in 1931 to 
James and Esther Belden. Shortly after the 
conclusion of World War II, Sergeant Belden 
enlisted in the Army at the age of seventeen. 
Two years later, he deployed to Korea as a 
member of Headquarters and Headquarters 
Company, 31st Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry 
Division. On December 1, 1950, his unit was 
attacked by enemy forces in North Korean ter-
ritory near the Chosin Reservoir. This attack 
occurred in the midst of a battle that would be-
come the bloodiest seventeen days of the en-
tire conflict. During this stretch, a massive 
enemy offensive comprising of over one hun-
dred thousand Chinese communist troops 
forced the withdrawal of the much smaller 
United Nations coalition. This assault claimed 
the lives of at least one thousand American 
soldiers, including Sergeant Belden. 
In the aftermath of the fighting, the Army 
listed Sergeant Belden as ‘‘unaccounted for’’ 
and informed his family that he was missing in 
action and presumed dead. Decades later, in 
August 2018, North Korea agreed to release 
the remains of fifty-five fallen American service 
members back to the United States. Sergeant 
Belden’s remains were among those returned 
and were finally identified on October 14, 
2021. To his family’s relief, the Army reclassi-
fied his status to ‘‘accounted for’’ on that day. 
In April 2022, Sergeant Belden will reach his 
final resting place in the Arlington National 
Cemetery, where he will be buried with full 
military honors. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
Congressional 
District, 
I 
thank 
Sergeant 
Belden for his service and his sacrifice, and I 
am proud to honor his legacy of defending 
American liberty, freedom, and democracy.

RECOGNIZING 
COMMANDER 
GEORGE 
O. 
FULENWIDER, 
III, 
UNITED STATES COAST GUARD 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to pay a heartfelt tribute 
to Commander George O. Fulenwider, III of 
the United States Coast Guard, to honor his 
long 
and 
illustrious 
career. 
Commander 
Fulenwider began serving in the Coast Guard 
in January of 1984, when he enlisted as an 
E1. Upon graduating from basic training in 
Cape 
May, 
New 
Jersey, 
Commander 
Fulenwider was stationed on the Coast Guard 
Cutter UTE based out of Key West, Florida 
and has been serving our great nation with 
dedication and honor ever since. His retire-
ment after many years of service to the United 
States Coast Guard is extraordinary and is a 
testament to his love for our country. 
During his very successful career, Com-
mander Fulenwider spent 15 years on 8 dif-
ferent cutters with positions including Engi-
neering Petty Officer (EPO), Main Propulsion 
Assistant (MPA) and Engineering Officer (EO). 
During his service, Commander Fulenwider 
supported various Coast Guard missions in-
cluding: Port and Waterway Security, Drug 
Interdiction, Aids to Navigation, Search and 
Rescue, Living Marine Resources, Marine 
Safety, Defense Readiness, Migrant Interdic-
tion, Marine Environmental Protection, Ice Op-
erations and Law Enforcement. 
Throughout 
his 
career, 
Commander 
Fulenwider was either directly involved in or 
supported nearly every mission and operation 
the Coast Guard was involved in during his 
tenure. This includes Operation Just Cause in 
Panama (December 1989 to January 1990), 
Operation Desert Shield (August 1990 to Jan-
uary 1991), the Gulf War (August 1990 to 
February 1991), Operation Enduring Freedom/ 
Global War on Terrorism resulting from the 
September 11th attacks on America’s World 
Trade Centers (October 2001 to December 
2014). In addition, Commander Fulenwider re-
sponded to the devastating 7.0 magnitude 
earthquake in Haiti that killed 250,000 people 
and displaced thousands of survivors. 
During his dedicated time of service, Com-
mander Fulenwider quickly rose through the 
ranks of Seaman Recruit-Fireman (E1–E3), 
Machinery Technician Third Class (MK3, E4), 
MK2 (E5), MK1 (E6), MKC (E7), Chief War-
rant Officer 2 (CWO2), Chief Warrant Officer 3 
(CWO3), Lieutenant (LT, O3E), Lieutenant 
Commander (LCDR, O4), and finally Com-
mander (O5). Furthermore, the U.S. Coast 
Guard afforded him the opportunity to obtain 
his Associate of Science in Naval Engineering 
from Trident Technical College located in 
North Charleston, South Carolina. 
Commander Fulenwider has received count-
less awards and achievements during his illus-
trious career. These include the Meritorious 
Service Medal, numerous Coast Guard Com-
mendation Medals, numerous Coast Guard 
Achievement medals and Commandants Let-
ter of Commendation, The Coast Guard Presi-
dential Unit Citation, Joint Meritorious Unit 
Award, Coast Guard and Navy Unit Com-
mendation amongst many more. 
Currently, Commander Fulenwider is a Pro-
gram Support Manager & Executive Officer at 
Project Resident Office Gulf Coast, assisting 
with the acquisition and construction of the 
Legend-Class National Security Cutters (NSC) 
at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mis-
sissippi. The NSCs are the most techno-
logically advanced ship in the Coast Guard’s 
fleet, with capabilities for maritime homeland 
security, law enforcement and national secu-
rity missions. The NSCs are the largest cutters 
in the Coast Guard fleet at 418 feet long and 
have a maximum speed of 28 knots with a 
range of 12,000 nautical miles; these cutters 
are equipped to carry a crew of 148 and can 
be out at sea for 3–6 months, projecting a 
U.S. presence around the globe, from the 
straits of Taiwan to the Black Sea. 
Commander George O. Fulenwider, III will 
retire in Hubert, North Carolina with his high 
school sweetheart and wife of 37 years, 
Nancy Fulenwider, who has supported his 
selfless career from the very beginning. The 
sacrifices they both have made to make this 
distinguishing career possible is simply admi-
rable. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the retirement of this incredible and noble pa-
triot and wishing Commander George O. 
Fulenwider, III, a happy retirement from his life 
of outstanding service to our country.

HONORING MICHAEL HARDAT AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Michael Hardat, a financial 
coach and youth advocate at the Financial 
Empowerment Center’s Evelyn K. Davis Cen-
ter for Working Families, as Iowan of the 
Week. 
Michael is a Lifelong resident of the Des 
Moines metro area and a recent Iowa State 
University graduate. From a young age, Mi-
chael recognized that he and his family lacked 
the financial resources that others had. As a 
result, Michael began going to the Children 
and Family Urban Movement’s programs. 
These programs made all the difference for 
Michael and helped him embrace the spirit of 
community support and betterment. Knowing 
he wanted to give back to the community, Mi-
chael began working with the Financial Em-
powerment Center. In his role, he has a direct 
hand in helping families make informed finan-
cial decisions and plan for a brighter future. 
During the pandemic when many families 
faced even greater struggles, he spoke out 
about how Iowans receiving the Child Tax 
Credit could most effectively use those funds 
to create positive outcomes.

powerment Center at Evelyn K. Davis since 
2018. The organization helps connect people 
to career goals as well as achieve financial 
stability through job development, career 
coaching, workforce training, and financial

how individuals can come together to help one

As we celebrate Black History Month, it is 
my honor to recognize Michael Hardat for the 
amazing work he is doing for families in great-
er Des Moines. Michael’s selfless approach 
and dedication to helping others succeed are 
some of the many reasons he is a shining ex-
ample of what it means to be an Iowan and 
a good neighbor. I will continue to fight in 
Congress to ensure every American has ac-
cess to quality financial education and quality 
community programs. It is my pleasure to 
name Mr. Hardat Iowan of the Week.

IN RECOGNITION OF KEITH MOSS 
FOR HIS SERVICE TO DURYEA, 
PENNSYLVANIA AS MAYOR 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor Duryea Mayor Keith Moss who retired 
from mayoral work in January after 20 years 
in office. 
Keith, the son of the late George and Arlene 
Moss, was born and raised in Duryea, Penn-
sylvania along with his nine siblings. His inter-
est in public service began as a young Boy 
Scout, and, at the age of 20, he joined the 
Germania Hose Company as a volunteer fire-
fighter. He served the organization as presi-
dent, vice president, and trustee. 
Keith decided to run for Duryea council after 
his uncle, a councilman himself, suggested he 
would be a good fit for the job. In 1992, Keith 
ran for and was elected to Duryea Borough 
Council. During his time on the council, he 
worked closely with the Borough’s police 
force, fostering a friendship with the late police 
chief Leonard Ash. It was Ash who first pro-
posed the idea of running for mayor to Keith. 
In 2001, a hallmark year for both Keith per-
sonally—he married his wife, Patricia—and for 
the Borough—it celebrated its centennial—he 
won the mayoral election. He confidently took 
on the office’s duties of overseeing the police 
department, crafting the Borough budget, 
breaking vote ties at council meetings, and 
managing the Borough’s public relations. In 
September 2011, when rain from Hurricane 
Irene and Tropical Storm Lee flooded areas of 
Duryea, Keith helped his community work 
through the storm and its aftermath. 
During his tenure as mayor, Keith worked to 
strengthen the sense of community in Duryea, 
organizing the Borough’s involvement in Na-
tional Night Out to foster community-police ca-
maraderie and the Borough’s Halloween party. 
He worked diligently to grow the Borough’s 
police force to four full-time officers. He also 
found great joy and fulfillment in performing 
weddings, marrying more than 500 couples 
during his time in office. 
Keith took great pride in his mayoral work 
and sought to share the wisdom he acquired 
on the job, and also to learn from others. He 
served as the chair of the Pennsylvania State 
Mayors Association’s Mayor of the Year Com-
mittee. He also regularly worked with mayors 
from Pittston, Hughestown, West Pittston, and 
Old Forge. 
In addition to his work as mayor, Keith has 
also been employed by the Wilkes-Barre/ 
Scranton International Airport as a mainte-
nance firefighter. He additionally has served 
his community as the treasurer of the Duryea 
Lions Club, president of Duryea Borough 
Sewer Authority, vice president of the Greater 
Pittston Cultural Coalition, and the president of 
the Luzerne County National Recreation Trail, 
and he continues to volunteer with the Ger-
mania Hose Company. For his efforts, Keith 
was recognized by the Sunday Dispatch with 
the Joseph Saporito Jr Lifetime of Service 
Award. 
I am honored to join with the citizens of 
Duryea in honoring the two-decade tenure of 
their beloved mayor. Keith has been a beacon 
of strength and stability for the Borough and 
has helped the community navigate a chang-
ing world. I wish Keith all the best as he be-
gins this next phase of his life. May he con-
tinue to feel inspired to share his time and tal-
ents with his community.

RECOGNIZING MR. FERNANDO 
ALANIZ 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Fer-
nando Alaniz, a father, husband, teacher, 
coach, and friend who unexpectedly passed 
away just a few weeks ago. 
An immigrant from Guadalajara, Mexico, Mr. 
Alaniz came to the Central Valley when he 
was just 5 years old, settling in Wasco. He 
graduated from Wasco High School in 1991, 
where he excelled in both football and basket-
ball, and helped lead his team to a Valley 
Championship. 
After receiving a scholarship to play football 
at McPherson College, Fernando and his wife, 
Christine, moved back to the Central Valley of 
California to begin a family. After spending 
time working at Delano Joint Union High 
School, Mr. Alaniz began a job serving his 
community at the Kern County Sheriffs Office. 
After earning his master’s degree, Fernando 
began teaching computer science and key-
boarding classes at McFarland High School. 
He quickly earned the respect of both his col-
leagues and his students, as they saw first- 
hand his dedication and passion for teaching. 
Not only did Mr. Alaniz demonstrate his 
dedication to his students in the classroom, 
but he also showed that same level of commit-
ment to his players. As the McFarland High 
varsity basketball coach, Fernando instilled 
discipline, work ethic, and integrity into his 
players. He was committed to helping his play-
ers succeed and showing them how to win in 
a humble way. Under his strong leadership, 
the Cougars made numerous trips to the play-
offs. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring the life of 
a respected, beloved, and invaluable member 
of our community, Fernando Alaniz.

Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Rodrigo Her-
rera for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge

Rodrigo Herrera is a student at Arvada High 
School and received this award because his

The dedication demonstrated by Rodrigo 
Herrera is exemplary of the type of achieve-

cation and develop a work ethic which will

I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Rodrigo Herrera for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I

IN 
SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
DAVE KISHLER UPON HIS RE-
TIREMENT FROM NETSMART 
HON. MARKWAYNE MULLIN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. MULLIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the career of Dave Kishler, a Sen-
ior Industry Relations Strategist at Netsmart. 
The company provides health information 
technology solutions to tens of thousands of 
public and private nonprofit mental health, 
human services and senior service organiza-
tions throughout the United States serving mil-
lions of Americans with mental illnesses, sub-
stance use disorders and other disabilities. 
Dave announced his retirement from Netsmart 
at the end of 2021 after a rich and extremely 
productive 30-year career with the company. 
Among many other duties, Dave was re-
sponsible for Netsmart’s relationships with pa-
tient advocacy organizations and trade asso-
ciations 
representing 
Community 
Mental 
Health Centers, providers of rehabilitation 
services for persons with Intellectual and De-
velopmental Disabilities (I/DD) and home care 
providers serving seniors. But I got to know 
Dave during our work together on legislative 
amendments to 42 CFR Part 2—a outdated 
federal privacy law that inhibited the sharing of 
clinical information for persons with major sub-
stance use disorders.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E197 
March 1, 2022 
When one of the committees I serve on— 
the House Energy & Commerce Committee— 
held public hearings to examine the real-world 
impact of the law, Dave assisted my office and 
committee staff in truly understanding how 
‘‘Part 2’’ obstructed the exchange of clinical 
data that made care coordination for people 
with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) nearly impos-
sible. Because of his diligent efforts and the 
patient stories he brought to our attention, the 
Congress ultimately passed legislative amend-
ments in the CARES Act that facilitated the 
exchange of vital information among hospitals, 
residential treatment centers and community- 
based providers. Once implemented, I am 
convinced that these statutory changes will 
save lives. 
By reflecting on Dave’s career, we recog-
nize both his enormous personal contributions 
as well as the tremendous value of public-pri-
vate partnerships in improving the lives of our 
most vulnerable citizens. I thank Dave, and 
congratulate him on this significant milestone.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 70TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
MARINE 
CORPS LOGISTICS BASE IN AL-
BANY, GEORGIA 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the men and 
women who have served and currently serve 
at the Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB) in 
Albany, Georgia. On Tuesday, March 1, 2022, 
base personnel, Armed Services veterans, 
and local dignitaries will celebrate the facility’s 
70th anniversary. 
Over the last 70 years, the brave men and 
women who have served at MCLB, Albany 
have made significant contributions in defend-
ing our homeland and safeguarding our lib-
erties. 
On March 1, 1952, MCLB, Albany was com-
missioned as the Marine Corps Depot of Sup-
plies. By 1954 the station was sufficiently 
complete with warehouses and administration 
buildings to assume supply support for Ma-
rines east of the Rocky Mountains and in the 
Atlantic area. In 1967, the base became a 
storage Activity and Depot Maintenance Activ-
ity. 
On January 17, 1990, the Commandant of 
the Marine Corps designated the Commanding 
General, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany 
to also be Commander, Marine Corps Logis-
tics Bases. The reorganization placed control 
of Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Cali-
fornia; Blount Island Command, Jacksonville, 
Florida, as well as Marine Corps Logistics 
Base, Albany under this single command. 
In 2005, the Marine Corps regionalized all 
installations under Marine Corps Installation 
Command, and the organization here was di-
vided into a base command (MCLB Albany) 
and Marine Corps Logistics Command. 
Over the last several decades, MCLB, Al-
bany has provided exceptional support to the 
Marine Air Ground Task Forces sent to South-
west Asia. The MCLB, Albany military and ci-
vilian team’s hard work and dedication, com-
bined with equal efforts from MCLB, Barstow 
and Blount Island Command have reaped out-
standing results for our Nation’s Armed Serv-
ices. 
In 2021, MCLB, Albany won in the Fiscal 
Year 
2021 
SECNAV 
Energy 
Excellence 
Award’s small installation category for its 
achievements in policy implementation, reduc-
tions in energy and water intensity, cybersecu-
rity, and overall commitment to energy security 
planning. This vital Net Zero Initiative from 
MCLB, Albany reduced the energy cost 
aboard the installation and helped the base 
nearly reach its goal in FY 2020 of covering all 
critical building energy loads in the event of an 
outage by increasing its sources of on-site 
generation. 
Madam Speaker, I have had the pleasure of 
traveling to many U.S. military installations 
around the world and the Marine Corps Logis-
tics Base in Albany, Georgia is one of the fin-
est military bases I have ever had the pleas-
ure of visiting. 
Through my ongoing interaction with MCLB, 
Albany personnel, one of the things I have 
come to admire about our nation’s Marines is 
that their commitment to serving our country 
does not end once they separate from Active 
Duty. In their everyday life and actions off 
base, the personnel at MCLB, Albany have re-
mained faithful to serving their fellow Marines, 
their community, and their nation. They have 
truly exemplified the U.S. Marine Corp’s motto, 
Semper Fidelis. 
MCLB, Albany Marines hold themselves to a 
higher standard—that service to our Nation is 
a lifelong commitment, not just a tour of duty. 
Whether it is going on to work as police-
men, fire fighters, teachers, or business pro-
fessionals, a MCLB, Albany Marine’s commit-
ment to making our nation better remains at 
the fundamental core of what not only makes 
them great during their Armed Services ca-
reer, but what will also make them invaluable 
members of our society once their military ca-
reers end and their transition into civilian life 
begins. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 people of the Second Congressional 
District of Georgia in paying tribute to the men 
and women who have served at the Marine 
Corps Logistics Base in Albany, Georgia over 
the last 70 years and those who currently 
serve today for their outstanding valor and pa-
triotic service.

HON. JIMMY GOMEZ

Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor L.A. Chinatown Firecracker Run 
Committee, Inc. (LACFRC) on 44 years of 
service to the district. 
LACFRC is a non-profit organization com-
posed of a group of volunteers who donate 
their time and energy to organize and stage 
events and programs promoting healthy life-
styles, fitness, and cultural awareness to the 
greater Los Angeles community. 
This organization hosts the annual Los An-
geles Chinatown Firecracker 5/10K Run/Walk 
which is the largest and longest-running Lunar 
New Year charity run in the United States. 
Today, because of LACFRC’s dedication it 
has expanded its events to include a bike ride, 
kiddie run and paw’er dog walk. 
All proceeds are reinvested into the commu-
nity, in support of elementary schools and 
nonprofit organizations, providing services and 
programs to those in need. LACFRC has con-
tributed more than $500,000 to local elemen-
tary schools and non-profit community organi-
zations. 
Although, the pandemic prevented an in- 
person event this year, LACFRC has stood by 
its mission: ‘‘to promote health and fitness, 
education, cultural awareness and community 
involvement’’ by hosting virtual events. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring and celebrating L.A. China-
town Firecracker Run Committee, Inc.

Patrick was born in Beaumont, Texas, to 
Hubert and Virginia Oxford. He attended 
Catholic school in Beaumont, graduating from 
St. Anthony’s Catholic High School. Patrick 
grew up playing football and baseball and 
working for his father’s business, Oxford Build-
ing Material, LLC. As he got older, Patrick’s 
love of baseball never faded. His friends and 
family cherished his knowledge of the game, 
its history, and his ability to make analogies of 
many situations in life or business to the game 
of baseball. 
Patrick and I attended the University of 
Texas at Austin, where he earned a Bachelor

of Business Administration with honors in 
1966 and a law degree with honors in 1967. 
He was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fra-
ternity and the Texas Cowboys, an honorary 
student organization. While in law school, Pat-
rick was the Managing Editor of the Texas 
Law Review and a member of the Friar Soci-
ety. In 1997, he was appointed to serve on the 
Board of Regents for the University of Texas 
System for a six-year term. He also chaired 
the Health Affairs Committee, which oversaw 
the operations of six health institutions within 
the University of Texas System. 
In 1973, Patrick joined the firm of Bracewell 
& Patterson, now known as Bracewell LLP, 
and immediately became its 13th partner. He 
specialized in business and transactional law 
at the firm, focusing on real estate, energy, 
and banking. Later, Patrick served as Man-
aging Partner and led the opening of the firm’s 
New York City office. Patrick took great pride 
and interest in recruiting and mentoring young 
lawyers at the firm; he genuinely cared and 
was a brilliant attorney who loved to share his 
passion for the law with others. 
Patrick believed that Houston’s business

state, and country. In fact, Patrick twice 
served as chairman of the campaign com-
mittee for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and 
was a leader in the gubernatorial and presi-
dential campaigns of George W. Bush. He 
also served as counsel for many statewide 
and local officeholders in Texas. 
Patrick was a man of deep faith. He at-

band, David; his brothers-in-law, Kit Herrington 
and Tommy Herrington; and numerous cous-

in death by his parents, Hubert and Virginia, 
and sister, Mary Englander. 
Madam Speaker, it is a special privilege to 
honor my dear friend, Patrick Cunningham Ox-

heartfelt prayers remain with his family and 
friends during this difficult time.

IN RECOGNITION OF NOAH CLAY,

CONGRESSIONAL 
DIS-
TRICT FOR THE STATE OF THE 
UNION ADDRESS 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Noah Clay from Keene, New 
Hampshire. Noah is joining me virtually for the 
State of the Union. Noah is an Intensive Care 
Unit (ICU) nurse who has been on the 
frontlines of the COVID–19 pandemic in the 
Granite State. I am pleased to honor Noah’s 
commitment and that of his colleagues to the 
well-being of our communities and their tire-
less work to save lives during the pandemic. 
Mr. Clay, a native of Keene, graduated with 
a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Colby- 
Sawyer College in 2020 and completed his 
Masters in Nursing Management from Colby- 
Sawyer College in 2022. Noah is an early ca-
reer Registered Nurse who came directly into 
the ICU specialty in 2020. 
It’s impossible to overstate the essential role 
of our Granite State health care workers dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. Throughout 
every surge and every variant, they have been 
on the frontlines, putting themselves in harm’s 
way to save lives and push back against this 
deadly virus. Our state and our country would 
not be where we are without them. Noah and 
his fellow health care workers are the true he-
roes behind America’s progress, and I’m 
proud to uplift their stories. 
On behalf of New Hampshire’s Second Con-
gressional District, I thank our health care he-
roes for all they do. I look forward to our con-
tinued work in Congress to ensure New 
Hampshire is the best place to live, work and 
raise a family. 
HONORING LEANNE KIM DO 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor my constituent, Leanne Kim Do, from 
Seattle, Washington. 
Today, on the day of President Biden’s 
State of the Union Address, we celebrate the 
bold and progressive accomplishments that 
have bolstered our economy and served as a 
critical lifeline for families and small business 
owners across our nation. I am proud to have 
worked alongside President Biden to enact the 
American Rescue Plan and Infrastructure In-
vestments and Jobs Act, two landmark pieces 
of legislation that invest in our communities 
and create good paying jobs for Americans. 
Leanne, a writing skills teacher and working 
mother of three young children, was a direct 
recipient of the Child Tax Credit and is a tes-
tament to the real differences these payments 
have made in the lives of Americans. Both 
Leanne and her spouse, Nathan, uplift the bril-
liance of marginalized communities in their 
work but neither were provided with paid fam-
ily leave to welcome their third child into their 
family. The Child Tax Credit payments allowed 
them to take much needed time off without 
worrying about how they were going to pay 
their bills or having to leave their cause-driven 
professions for higher pay. 
This past year we have made critical invest-
ments in vaccine distribution, rental and nutri-
tion assistance, grants to small businesses, 
and funding for schools and child care facili-
ties. It is imperative that we keep this momen-
tum up and continue to deliver for families, like 
Leanne’s, across our Nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF JUDGE THOM-
AS MUNLEY FOR HIS SERVICE 
TO LACKAWANNA COUNTY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor Judge Thomas J. Munley who, after 
16 years on the bench, recently retired from 
the Lackawanna County Court of Common 
Pleas. Judge Munley is beloved by his col-
leagues and community as a fair and skilled 
jurist who treats everyone with respect and 
dignity. 
A native Northeastern Pennsylvanian, Judge 
Munley graduated from Jessup High School in 
1964. He continued his studies at East 
Stroudsburg University, graduating in 1968 
with a degree in education. Judge Munley re-
turned to his hometown to teach at his alma 
mater from 1968 to 1969. In 1969, he was 
drafted to serve in the Army and was sent to 
Vietnam on an 11-month tour as an infantry-
man with the 11th Infantry Brigade, Americal 
Division. For his meritorious service in Viet-
nam, he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. 
After returning home from military service in 
1971, Judge Munley enrolled in law school at 
Loyola University Law School in New Orleans, 
Louisiana. He earned his JD and was admit-
ted into the Pennsylvania Bar in 1974. From 
1976 to 1979, he served as Assistant Public 
Defender in Lackawanna County. In 1979, 
Judge Munley founded his own law practice 
and was renowned as a fiercely competent 
defense attorney, a formidable opponent in the 
courtroom. 
In 2005, after 25 years at his own practice, 
Judge Munley ran for the seat on the Lacka-
wanna County Court of Common Pleas. He 
won the Democratic and Republican nomina-
tions in the May primary and easily prevailed 
in the November election. Judge Munley 
quickly earned the respect of his colleagues 
on the court, building on his acclaimed reputa-
tion as an attorney. The integrity and principle 
with which he conducted himself on the bench 
led his colleagues to elect him president-judge 
in 2011. 
Inspired by his own time in the service and 
his experience as a veteran, Judge Munley 
has been a longtime, fierce advocate for vet-
erans and their families. Since 2014, he has 
hosted the popular television program ‘‘Vet-
erans Views’’ on NBC/WBRE–TV which aims 
to inform those who have served about the 
benefits and services to which they are enti-
tled. He often receives a deluge of calls after 
the show from veterans seeking assistance, 
and he diligently calls them back. He is also 
a proud member of the American Legion and 
the VFW. 
On January 1, 2022, Judge Munley retired 
to senior status as required by Pennsylvania’s 
mandatory retirement age of 75. In his role of 
senior judge, he will serve in every county 
where the state Supreme Court grants him au-
thority to hear matters. He also plans to con-
tinue his work on behalf of veterans and their 
families in his retirement. 
I am honored to recognize the judicial ca-
reer and lifetime of public service of Judge 
Thomas Munley. It is a privilege to call him a 
colleague in the legal profession, and I join 
with the entirety of Lackawanna County in 
thanking him for his service to his country and 
his community. May he continue to find fulfill-
ment and purpose in this new chapter of his 
life.

CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION FUNDS 
FOR JONES ACT VESSELS 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce legislation to allow operators of 
Jones Act-compliant passenger ferries to es-
tablish Capital Construction Funds. Only car 
ferries are currently eligible for this special, 
tax-exempt domestic shipbuilding program ad-
ministered by the Maritime Administration 
(MARAD). 
Federally regulated Capital Construction 
Funds allow operators of US-flagged vessels 
to legally forgo paying federal business taxes 
pertaining to such vessels, provided all that 
forgone tax payment is reinvested in con-
structing new US-flagged vessels in American 
shipyards. 
Current law only allows operators of cargo 
and fishing vessels to establish Capital Con-
struction Funds for such vessels. Car ferries 
are only eligible because they are treated as 
‘‘cargo vessels’’ for the purposes of the pro-
gram, not ferries. Under my bill, all ferries and 
similar vessels with 50-plus passenger capac-
ity would be eligible to establish Capital Con-
struction Funds. 
Through my tenure in the Congress, I have 
worked to increase federal funding for ex-
panded passenger ferry service. Regrettably, 
Congress has historically underfunded the 
Federal Highway Administration’s formula pro-
gram and the Federal Transit Administration’s 
competitive grant program for ferries, ferry ter-
minals, and related infrastructure. Privately op-
erated passenger ferries remain ineligible 
under both U.S. Department of Transportation 
programs. 
Both public and private operators are work-
ing to expand service in the San Francisco 
Bay Area. My legislation is intended to support 
proposed service expansion by private ferry 
operators in the Bay Area and nationwide, at 
no cost to American taxpayers. Many Bay 
Area ferry operators are also considering re-
placing their existing fleets with new renew-
able energy-powered ferries, like hydrogen 
fuel cells. Those ferries can and should be 
built in American shipyards by skilled workers. 
Madam Speaker, I plan to make this legisla-
tion a priority in the forthcoming Coast Guard 
Authorization Act for fiscal years 2022 and 
2023.

EMILIA LINGAD 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Emilia Lingad 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Emilia Lingad is a student at Arvada High 
School and received this award because her 
determination and hard work have allowed her 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Emilia 
Lingad is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Emi-
lia Lingad for winning the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassador for Youth award. I have 
no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication 
and character in all of her future accomplish-
ments.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
RESOLUTION 
TO SUPPORT THE GOALS AND 
IDEALS OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to introduce this resolution supporting 
the designation of International Day for Elimi-
nation of Violence against Women on the 
twenty-fifth day of November. 
According to the World Health Organization, 
1 in 3 women and girls experience physical or 
sexual violence in their lifetime. This figure 
does not include sexual harassment, and re-
ports show that less than 40 percent of 
women who experience violence report it or 
seek help. Around the world, women and girls 
are being denied access to education and are 
politically and economically oppressed. Eco-
nomic and political marginalization leaves 
women and girls all the more vulnerable to ex-
periencing violence. We cannot be silent in the 
face of such injustice and violence. I urge my 
colleagues to stand with me in the face of in-
justices. 
As we enter Women’s History Month, the 
United States and the international community 
have an obligation to lend support and assist-
ance to those suffering from violence and op-
pression, both abroad and at home. There are 
many critical factors that contribute to violence 
against women. Of all the women murdered in 
the United States, about 63 percent were 
killed by an intimate partner. Acts of violence 
as a result of war—especially physical abuse, 
sexual assault, and trafficking—disproportion-
ately affect women of color. It is estimated that 
up to half a million women were raped during 
the Rwandan 1994 genocide. Furthermore, in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, close to 60,000 
women were raped during the war in which vi-
olence against women was used as a stra-
tegic tool of ethnic cleansing. That should 
never happen again. We must stand with 
women worldwide—this is unacceptable. 
International Day for the Elimination of Vio-
lence Against Women is commemorated to 
share women stories and educate commu-
nities about the percentage of women who ex-
perience violence, who lack access to edu-
cation afforded to men[?], and how they face 
political and economic marginalization. The 
United Nations General Assembly observes 
International Day for the Elimination of Vio-
lence Against Women each year. My resolu-
tion expresses support for the designation of

the twenty-fifth day of November as Inter-
national Day for the Elimination of Violence 
Against Women. Congress should recognize 
this work and improve our efforts to address 
the challenges of women facing threats and vi-
olence. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join me in supporting International Day for the 
Elimination of Violence Against Women’s des-
ignation on the twenty-fifth day of November 
to better support the millions of women af-
fected by violence. I urge the House to sup-
port this resolution.

HONORING ALLISON BOETTCHER 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 1, 2022 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate my guest for 
the State of the Union address, Allison 
Boettcher. 
President Joe Biden and House Democrats 
are building a better America. The American 
Rescue Plan put our economy back on track 
with historic job growth and the fastest recov-
ery of any of the world’s leading economies; 
and small business owners across the nation, 
like Allison, have persevered and survived 
with assistance from President Biden and 
Democrats. 
Allison is the founder of Blue Mountain Cof-
fee House, a small business in Florida’s 21st 
Congressional District. Raised in Jamaica, Alli-
son has been passionate about the Carib-
bean—the culture, the community, and the 
coffee. In January 2020, she committed to 
sharing that love with her neighbors in West 
Palm Beach, and her fresh roasted coffee 
from Jamaica’s Blue Mountains has become a 
local staple. 
Like so many small business owners across 
the country, Allison found herself struggling 
when the COVID–19 pandemic hit and was 
able to withstand the economic fallout from the 
pandemic. With the help of the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program and Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund, crucial provisions in The American Res-
cue Plan, Allison’s business stayed open and 
kept employees safe and on payroll. 
For the people of West Palm Beach, 
Allison’s Blue Mountain Coffee House is much 
more than a cafe´, it is a place where people 
feel at home. Her tenacity and desire to serve 
the people of West Palm Beach is truly inspir-
ing. I am grateful for her contributions and 
look forward to her continued success.
