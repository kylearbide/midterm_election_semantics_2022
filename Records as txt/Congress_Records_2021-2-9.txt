PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, author of liberty, take 
control of this impeachment trial. 
Lord, permit the words of the New Eng-
land poet James Russell Lowell to pro-
vide our Senate jurors with just one 
perspective. Lowell wrote: 
Once to every man and nation comes the 
moment to decide, In the strife of Truth with 
Falsehood, for the good or evil side. 
Mighty God, could it really be that 
simple? Could it really be just truth 
striving against falsehood and good 
striving against evil? 
Powerful Redeemer, have mercy on 
our beloved land. 
We pray in Your magnificent Name. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ARTICLE
OF
IMPEACHMENT 
AGAINST
DONALD
JOHN
TRUMP, 
FORMER 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
moment, I will call up a resolution to 
govern the structure of the second im-
peachment 
trial 
of 
Donald 
John 
Trump. 
It has been agreed to by the House 
managers, the former President’s coun-
sel, and is cosponsored by the Repub-
lican leader. It is bipartisan. 
It is our solemn constitutional duty 
to conduct a fair and honest impeach-
ment trial on the charges against 
former President Trump—the gravest 
charges ever brought against a Presi-
dent of the United States in American 
history. 
This resolution provides for a fair 
trial, and I urge the Senate to adopt it. 
Mr. President, I send a resolution to 
the desk on my behalf and that of the 
Republican leader for the organizing of 
the next phases of this trial. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 47) to provide for re-
lated procedures concerning the article of 
impeachment against Donald John Trump, 
former President of the United States. 
VOTE ON S. RES. 47 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
question is on agreeing to the adoption 
of the resolution. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll.

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pur-
suant to the provisions of S. Res. 47, 
there shall now be 4 hours of argument 
by the parties, equally divided, on the 
question 
of 
whether 
Donald 
John 
Trump is subject to the jurisdiction of 
a Court of Impeachment for acts com-
mitted while President of the United 
States, notwithstanding the expiration 
of his term in that office. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN, are you a pro-
ponent or an opponent of this question? 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. I am a pro-
ponent. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
Castor, are you a proponent or an oppo-
nent of this question? 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. We are an op-
ponent. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Oppo-
nent, thank you. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN, your party may 
proceed first. You will be able to re-
serve rebuttal time, if you wish. 
Mr. RASKIN, you are recognized. 
MANAGERS’ OPENING STATEMENTS 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you 
very 
much, 
Mr. 
President, 
distin-
guished Members of the Senate. Good 
afternoon. 
My name is JAMIE RASKIN. It is my 
honor to represent the people of Mary-
land’s Eighth Congressional District in 
the House and also to serve as the lead 
House manager. 
And Mr. President, we will indeed re-
serve time for rebuttal. Thank you. 
Because I have been a professor of 
constitutional law for three decades, I 
know there are a lot of people who are 
dreading endless lectures about the 
Federalist Papers. Please breathe easy, 
OK. I remember well W.H. Audens’ line 
that a professor is someone who speaks 
while other people are sleeping. 
You will not be hearing extended lec-
tures from me because our case is 
based on cold, hard facts. It is all about 
the facts. 
President Trump has sent his lawyers 
here today to try to stop the Senate 
from hearing the facts of this case. 
They want to call the trial over before 
any evidence is even introduced. 
Their argument is that if you com-
mit an impeachable offense in your 
last few weeks in office, you do it with 
constitutional impunity; you get away 
with it. In other words, conduct that 
would be a high crime and mis-
demeanor in your first year as Presi-
dent and your second year as President 
and your third year as President and 
for the vast majority of your fourth 
year as President you can suddenly do 
in your last few weeks in office without 
facing 
any 
constitutional 
account-
ability at all. 
This would create a brandnew Janu-
ary exception to the Constitution of 
the United States of America—a Janu-
ary exception. And everyone can see 
immediately why this is so dangerous. 
It is an invitation to the President to 
take his best shot at anything he may 
want to do on his way out the door, in-
cluding using violent means to lock 
that door, to hang on to the Oval Office 
at all costs, and to block the peaceful 
transfer of power. 
In other words, the January excep-
tion is an invitation to our Founders’ 
worst nightmare. And if we buy this 
radical 
argument 
that 
President 
Trump’s lawyers advance, we risk al-
lowing January 6 to become our future. 
And what will that mean for Amer-
ica? Think about it. What will the Jan-
uary exception mean to future genera-
tions if you grant it? I will show you. 
(Video footage of 1–6–2021.) 
Mr. TRUMP. We will stop the steal. 
(Applause.) 
Mr. TRUMP. Today I will lay out just 
some of the evidence proving that we won 
this election and we won it by a landslide. 
This was not a close election. And after this, 
we’re going to walk down—and I will be 
there with you—we’re going to walk down— 
we’re gonna walk down to the Capitol. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah. Let’s take the 
Capitol.’’) 
Unidentified Male. Take it. 
Unidentified Male. Take the Capitol. 
Unidentified Male. We are going to the 
Capitol, where our problems are. It’s that di-
rection. 
Unidentified Male. Everybody in. This way. 
This way. 
Mr. TRUMP. Tens of thousands of votes. 
They came in in duffel bags. Where the hell 
did they come from? 
(People chanting: ‘‘USA.’’) 
Sergeant at Arms: Madam Speaker, the 
Vice President and the United States Senate. 
(Applause.) 
Unidentified Male. Off the sidewalk. 
Unidentified Male. We outnumber you a 
million to one out here, dude. 
Unidentified Male. Take the building. Take 
the building. 
Unidentified Male. Let us in. 
Unidentified Male. Fuck these pigs. 
Unidentified Male. Join us. 
Unidentified Male. Let us in. 
Unidentified Male. That’s enough. There’s 
much more coming. 
Mr. TRUMP. The Constitution says you 
have to protect our country and you have to 
protect our Constitution. And you can’t vote 
on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, 
doesn’t it? When you catch somebody in a 
fraud, you’re allowed to go by very different 
rules. 
So I hope Mike has the courage to do what 
he has to do. 
Unidentified Male. Talking about you, 
Pence. 
Mr. TRUMP. When we fight, we fight like 
hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re 
not going to have a country anymore. 
Unidentified Male. Fuck DC police. Fuck 
you. 
Mr. TRUMP. So we are going to walk down 
Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania 
Avenue. And we are going to the Capitol, and 
we are going to try and give our Repub-
licans—the weak ones because the strong 
ones don’t need any of our help. We are going 
to try and give them the kind of pride and 
boldness that they need to take back our 
country. 
Unidentified Male. Get the fuck out of 
here, you traitors. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. We are debating a step 
that has never been taken in American his-
tory. 
Unidentified Male. Fuck you, traitors. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. President Trump claims 
the election was stolen. The assertions range 
from specific local allegations to constitu-
tional arguments to sweeping conspiracy 
theories. 
(People chanting: ‘‘USA.’’) 
Mr. MCCONNELL. But my colleagues, 
nothing before us proves illegality anywhere 
near the massive scale—the massive scale— 
that would have tipped the entire election. 
Unidentified Female. Our house, our house, 
our house, our house. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
Unidentified Male. Fuck you, police. 
Unidentified Male. Let’s go. Let’s go. 
Officer GOODMAN. Second floor. 
Unidentified Male. You are gonna beat us 
all? Are you gonna beat us all? 
Mr. LANKFORD. My challenge today is 
not about the good people of Arizona. 
The PRESIDING pro tempore. The Senate 
will stand in recess until the call of the 
Chair. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Thank you. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Woot, woot.’’) 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam—Mr. Speaker, can I 
have order in the Chamber. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The House 
will be in order. 
Unidentified Male. Go, go, go. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The House 
will be in order. OK. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Stop the steal.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Traitor Pence.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Stop the steal.’’) 
Unidentified Male. They are leaving. They 
are leaving. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Break it down.’’) 
Unidentified Male. Get down. Let’s go. 
Come on. Where the fuck are they? 
(People chanting: ‘‘No Trump, no peace.’’) 
Unidentified Male. Let’s go. We need fresh 
patriots. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Traitors.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
Mr. TRUMP. There has never been a time 
like this where such a thing happened, where 
they could take it away from all of us—from 
me, from you, from our country. This was a 
fraudulent election, but we can’t play into 
the hands of these people. 
We have to have peace. So go home. We 
love you. You’re very special. You’ve seen 
what happens. You’ve seen the way others 
are treated that are so bad and so evil.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S591 
February 9, 2021 
I know how you feel, but go home, and go 
home in peace. 
(Audience chants: ‘‘USA.’’) 
Your lies in your own cities, your own 
counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. 
We 
take 
down 
every 
one 
of 
these 
motherfuckers. 
Hang them! 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Senators, the 
President was impeached by the U.S. 
House of Representatives on January 
13 for doing that. You ask what a ‘‘high 
crime and misdemeanor’’ is under our 
Constitution. That is a high crime and 
misdemeanor. If that is not an im-
peachable offense, then there is no such 
thing. And if the President’s argu-
ments for a January exception are 
upheld, then even if everyone agrees 
that he is culpable for these events, 
even if the evidence proves, as we think 
it definitively does, that the President 
incited a violent insurrection on the 
day Congress met to finalize the Presi-
dential election, he would have you be-
lieve there is absolutely nothing the 
Senate can do about it—no trial, no 
facts. He wants you to decide that the 
Senate is powerless at that point. That 
can’t be right. 
The transition of power is always the 
most dangerous moment for democ-
racies. Every historian will tell you 
that. We just saw it in the most aston-
ishing way. We lived through it. And 
you know what? The Framers of our 
Constitution knew it. That is why they 
created a Constitution with an oath 
written into it that binds the President 
from his very first day in office until 
his very last day in office and every 
day in between. 
Under that Constitution and under 
that oath, the President of the United 
States is forbidden to commit high 
crimes and misdemeanors against the 
people at any point that he is in office. 
Indeed, that is one specific reason the 
impeachment, conviction, and disquali-
fication of powers exist: to protect us 
against Presidents who try to overrun 
the power of the people in their elec-
tions and replace the rule of law with 
the rule of mobs. These powers must 
apply even if the President commits 
his offenses in his final weeks in office. 
In fact, that is precisely when we need 
them the most because that is when 
elections get attacked. 
Everything that we know about the 
language 
of 
the 
Constitution, 
the 
Framers’ original understanding and 
intent, prior Senate practice, and com-
mon sense, confirms this rule. 
Let’s start with the text of the Con-
stitution. Article I, section 2 gives the 
House the sole power of impeachment 
when the President commits high 
crimes and misdemeanors. We exer-
cised that power on January 13. 
The President, it is undisputed, com-
mitted his offense while he was Presi-
dent, and it is undisputed that we im-
peached him while he was President. 
There can be no doubt that this is a 
valid and legitimate impeachment, and 
there can be no doubt that the Senate 
has the power to try this impeachment. 
We know this because article I, section 
3 gives the Senate the sole power to try 
all impeachments. The Senate has the 
power, the sole power, to try all im-
peachments. ‘‘All’’ means all, and there 
are no exceptions to the rule. Because 
the Senate has jurisdiction to try all 
impeachments, it most certainly has 
jurisdiction to try this one. It is really 
that simple. The vast majority of con-
stitutional scholars who studied the 
question and weighed in on the propo-
sition being advanced by the President, 
this January exception, heretofore un-
known, agree with us, and that in-
cludes the Nation’s most prominent 
conservative legal scholars, including 
former Tenth Circuit Judge Michael 
McConnell; the cofounder of the Fed-
eralist Society, Steven Calabresi; Ron-
ald Reagan’s Solicitor General Charles 
Fried; luminary Washington lawyer 
Charles Cooper, among hundreds of 
other constitutional lawyers and pro-
fessors. 
I commend the people I named—their 
recent writings to you in the news-
papers over the last several days. And 
all of the key precedents, along with 
detailed explanation of the constitu-
tional history and textual analysis, ap-
pear in the trial brief we filed last 
week and the reply brief that we filed 
very early this morning. 
I will spare you a replay, but I want 
to highlight a few key points from con-
stitutional history that strike me as 
compelling in foreclosing President 
Trump’s argument that there is a se-
cret January exception hidden away in 
the Constitution. 
The first point comes from English 
history, which matters because, as 
Hamilton wrote, England provided ‘‘the 
model from which the idea of this insti-
tution has been borrowed.’’ And it 
would have been immediately obvious 
to anyone familiar with that history 
that former officials could be held ac-
countable for their abuses while in of-
fice. 
Every single impeachment of a gov-
ernment official that occurred during 
the Framers’ lifetime concerned a 
former official—a former official. In-
deed, the most famous of these im-
peachments occurred while the Fram-
ers gathered in Philadelphia to write 
the Constitution. It was the impeach-
ment of Warren Hastings, the former 
Governor-general of the British colony 
of Bengal and a corrupt guy. The 
Framers knew all about it, and they 
strongly supported the impeachment. 
In fact, the Hastings case was invoked 
by name at the convention. It was the 
only specific impeachment case that 
they discussed at the convention. It 
played a key role in their adoption of 
the high crimes and misdemeanors 
standard. And even though everyone 
there surely knew that Hastings had 
left office 2 years before his impeach-
ment trial began, not a single Fram-
er—not one—raised a concern when 
Virginian George Mason held up the 
Hastings impeachment as a model for 
us in the writing of our Constitution. 
The early State constitutions sup-
ported the idea too. Every single State 
constitution in the 1780s either specifi-
cally said that former officials could be 
impeached or were entirely consistent 
with the idea. In contrast, not a single 
State constitution prohibited trials of 
former officials. As a result, there was 
an overwhelming presumption in favor 
of allowing legislatures to hold former 
officials accountable in this way. Any 
departure from that norm would have 
been a big deal, and yet there is no sign 
anywhere that that ever happened. 
Some States, including Delaware, 
even confined impeachment only to of-
ficials who had already left office. This 
confirms that removal was never seen 
as the exclusive purpose of impeach-
ment in America. The goal was always 
about accountability, protecting soci-
ety, and deterring official corruption. 
Delaware matters for another reason. 
Writing about impeachment in the 
Federalist Papers, Hamilton explained 
that the President of America would 
stand upon no better ground than a 
Governor of New York and upon worse 
ground than the Governors of Mary-
land and Delaware. He thus emphasized 
that the President is even more ac-
countable than officials in Delaware, 
where, as I noted, the constitution 
clearly allowed impeachment of former 
officials. 
And nobody involved in the conven-
tion ever said that the Framers meant 
to reject this widely accepted, deeply 
rooted understanding of the word ‘‘im-
peachment’’ when they wrote it into 
our Constitution. The convention de-
bates instead confirm this interpreta-
tion. There, while discussing impeach-
ment, the Framers repeatedly returned 
to the threat of Presidential corruption 
aimed directly to elections, the heart 
of self-government. 
Almost perfectly anticipating Presi-
dent Trump, William Davey of North 
Carolina explained impeachment was 
for a President who spared ‘‘no effort 
or means whatever to get himself re-
elected.’’ 
Hamilton, in Federalist 1, said the 
greatest danger to republics and the 
liberties of the people comes from po-
litical opportunists who begin as dema-
gogues and end as tyrants and the peo-
ple who are encouraged to follow them. 
President Trump may not know a lot 
about the Framers, but they certainly 
knew a lot about him. 
Given the Framers’ intense focus on 
danger to elections and the peaceful 
transfer of power, it is inconceivable 
that they designed impeachment to be 
a dead letter in the President’s final 
days in office when opportunities to 
interfere with the peaceful transfer of 
power would be most tempting and 
most dangerous, as we just saw. Thus, 
as a matter of history and original un-
derstanding, there is no merit to Presi-
dent Trump’s claim that he can incite 
an insurrection and then insist weeks 
later that the Senate lacks the power 
to even hear evidence at a trial, to 
even hold a trial. 
The true rule was stated by former 
President John Quincy Adams when he 
categorically declared:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S592 
February 9, 2021 
I hold myself, so long as I have the breath 
of life in my body, amenable to impeachment 
by [the] House for everything I did during 
the time I held any public office. 
When he comes up in a minute, my 
colleague Mr. NEGUSE of Colorado will 
further pursue the relevant Senate 
precedents and explain why this body’s 
practice has been supported by the text 
of the Constitution, and Mr. CICILLINE 
of Rhode Island will then respond to 
the fallacies presented by the Presi-
dent’s counsel. After these gentlemen 
speak, I will return to discuss the im-
portance—the fundamental importance 
of 
the 
Senate 
rejecting 
President 
Trump’s argument for the preservation 
of democratic self-government and the 
rule of law in the United States of 
America. 
I now turn it over to my colleague, 
Mr. NEGUSE of Colorado. 
Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. Presi-
dent, distinguished Senators, my name 
is JOE NEGUSE, and I represent Colo-
rado’s Second Congressional District in 
the United States Congress. 
Like many of you, I am an attorney. 
I practiced law before I came to Con-
gress, tried a lot of different cases, 
some more unique than others, cer-
tainly never a case as important as 
this one, nor a case with such a heavy 
and weighty constitutional question 
for you all to decide. 
Thankfully, as Lead Manager RASKIN 
so thoroughly explained, the Framers 
have answered that question for you, 
for us, and you don’t need to be a con-
stitutional scholar to know that the 
argument President Trump asks you to 
adopt is not just wrong, it is dan-
gerous. And you don’t have to take my 
word for it. This body, the world’s 
greatest deliberative body, the United 
States Senate, has reached that same 
conclusion in one form or another over 
the past 200 years on multiple occa-
sions that we will go through. Over 150 
constitutional 
scholars, 
experts, 
judges—conservative, 
liberal, 
you 
name it—they overwhelmingly have 
reached the same conclusion, that, of 
course, you can try, convict, and dis-
qualify a former President. And that 
makes sense because the text of the 
Constitution makes clear there is no 
January exception to the impeachment 
power; that Presidents can’t commit 
grave offenses in their final days and 
escape 
any 
congressional 
response. 
That is not how our Constitution 
works. 
Let’s start with the precedent, with 
what has happened in this very Cham-
ber. I would like to focus on just two 
cases. I will go through them quickly. 
One of them is the Nation’s very first 
impeachment case, which actually was 
of a former official. 
In 1797, about a decade after our 
country 
ratified 
our 
Constitution, 
there was a Senator from Tennessee by 
the name of William Blount, who was 
caught conspiring with the British to 
try to sell Florida and Louisiana. Ulti-
mately, President Adams caught him. 
He turned over the evidence to Con-
gress. Four days later, the House of 
Representatives impeached him. A day 
after that, this body, the United States 
Senate, expelled him from office, so he 
was very much a former official. 
Despite that, the House went forward 
with its impeachment proceeding in 
order to disqualify him from ever again 
holding Federal office. And so the Sen-
ate proceeded with the trial with none 
other than Thomas Jefferson presiding. 
Now, Blount argued that the Senate 
couldn’t proceed because he had al-
ready been expelled. But here is the in-
teresting thing: He expressly disavowed 
any claim that former officials can’t 
ever be impeached. And unlike Presi-
dent Trump, he was very clear that he 
respected and understood that he could 
not even try to argue that ridiculous 
position. 
Even impeached Senator Blount rec-
ognized the inherent absurdity of that 
view. Here is what he said: 
I certainly never shall contend, that an of-
ficer may first commit an offense, and after-
wards avoid by resigning his office. 
That is the point. And there was no 
doubt 
because 
the 
Founders 
were 
around to confirm that that was their 
intent and the obvious meaning of 
what is in the Constitution. 
Fast-forward 80 years later—arguably 
the most important precedent that this 
body has to consider—the trial of 
former 
Secretary 
of 
War 
William 
Belknap. I am not going to go into all 
the details, but, in short, in 1876, the 
House discovered that he was involved 
in a massive kickback scheme. Hours 
before the House Committee had dis-
covered this conduct, released its re-
port documenting the scheme, Belknap 
literally rushed to the White House to 
resign, tender his resignation to Presi-
dent Ulysses Grant to avoid any fur-
ther inquiry into his misconduct, and, 
of course, to avoid being disqualified 
from holding Federal office in the fu-
ture. 
Later that day, aware of the resigna-
tion, what did the House do? The House 
moved forward and unanimously im-
peached him, making clear its power to 
impeach a former official. And when 
his 
case 
reached 
the 
Senate—this 
body—Belknap made the exact same 
argument that President Trump is 
making today, that you all lack juris-
diction, any power, to try him because 
he is a former official. 
Now, many Senators at that time, 
when they heard that argument—lit-
erally, they were sitting in the same 
chair as you all are sitting in today— 
they were outraged by that argument— 
outraged. You can read their comments 
in the RECORD. They knew it was a dan-
gerous, dangerous argument with dan-
gerous implications. It would literally 
mean that a President could betray 
their country, leave office, and avoid 
impeachment and disqualification en-
tirely. And that is why, in the end, the 
United States Senate decisively voted 
that the Constitution required them to 
proceed with the trial. 
The Belknap case is clear precedent 
that the Senate must proceed with this 
trial since it rejected pretrial dis-
missal, affirmed its jurisdiction, and 
moved to a full consideration of the 
merits. 
Now, Belknap ultimately was not 
convicted but only after a thorough 
public inquiry into his misconduct, 
which created a record of his wrong-
doing. It ensured his accountability 
and deterred anyone else from consid-
ering such corruption by making clear 
that it was intolerable. The trial 
served important constitutional pur-
poses. 
Now, given that precedent that I de-
scribed to you, given all that that 
precedent imparts, you could imagine 
my surprise—Lead Manager RASKIN’s 
surprise—when we were reviewing a 
trial brief filed by the President in 
which his counsel insists that the Sen-
ate actually didn’t decide anything in 
the Belknap case. They say—these are 
not my words. I will quote from their 
trial brief: 
[It] cannot be read as foreclosing an argu-
ment that they never dealt with. 
Never dealt with? The Senate didn’t 
debate this question for 2 hours. The 
Senate debated this very question for 2 
weeks. The Senate spent an additional 
2 weeks deliberating on the jurisdic-
tional question. And at the end of 
those deliberations, they decided deci-
sively that the Senate has jurisdiction 
and that it could proceed, that it must 
proceed to a full trial. 
By the way, unlike Belknap, as we 
know, President Trump was not im-
peached for run-of-the-mill corruption, 
misconduct. He was impeached for in-
citing a violent insurrection—an insur-
rection where people died in this build-
ing, an insurrection that desecrated 
our seat of government. And if Con-
gress were just to stand completely 
aside in the face of such an extraor-
dinary crime against the Republic, it 
would invite future Presidents to use 
their power without any fear of ac-
countability. And none of us—I know 
this—none of us, no matter our party 
or our politics, wants that. 
Now, we have gone through the high-
lights of the precedent, and I think it 
is important that you know, as Lead 
Manager 
RASKIN
mentioned, 
that 
scholars, 
overwhelmingly, 
that 
re-
viewed this same precedent have all 
come to the same conclusion that the 
Senate must hear this case. 
Let’s go through just a few short ex-
amples. To start, all of us, I know, are 
familiar with the Federalist Society. 
Some 
of 
you 
may 
know 
Steven 
Calabresi personally. He is the co- 
founder of the Federalist Society. Ac-
tually, he was the chairman of the 
board in 2019. He was the first president 
of the Yale Federalist Society chapter 
board, a position I understand Senator 
HAWLEY later held. 
Here is what Mr. Calabresi has to 
say. On January 21, he issued a public 
letter stating: 
Our carefully considered views of the law 
lead all of us to agree that the Constitution 
permits the impeachment, conviction, and

disqualification of former officers, including 
presidents. 
And by the way, he is not the only 
one, as Lead Manager RASKIN said— 
President Reagan’s former Solicitor 
General, among many others. 
Another 
prominent 
conservative 
scholar known to many of you, again, 
personally is a former Tenth Court of 
Appeals judge—my circuit—Judge Mi-
chael McConnell. He was nominated by 
President George W. Bush. He was con-
firmed by this body unanimously. Sen-
ator Hatch—many of you served with— 
he had this to say about Judge McCon-
nell, that he ‘‘is an honest man. He 
calls it as he sees it, and he is beholden 
to no one and no group.’’ 
Well, what does Judge McConnell 
have to say about the question that 
you are debating this afternoon? He 
said the following: 
Given that the impeachment of President 
Trump was legitimate, the text makes clear 
that the Senate has power to try that im-
peachment. 
You heard Lead Manager RASKIN 
mention another lawyer, Chuck Coo-
per, a prominent conservative lawyer 
here in Washington. He has represented 
former Attorney General Jeff Sessions 
and House Minority Leader KEVIN 
MCCARTHY. He issued an editorial just 2 
days ago, very powerful, observing that 
‘‘scholarship on this question has ma-
tured substantially’’ and that, ulti-
mately, 
arguments 
that 
President 
Trump is championing are beset by 
‘‘serious weaknesses.’’ 
Finally, I have gone through a lot of 
scholars. I will finish on this one. 
There is another scholar that I know 
some of you know and some of you 
have actually spoken with recently. Up 
until just a few weeks ago, he was a 
recognized 
champion—champion—of 
the view that the Constitution author-
izes the impeachment of former offi-
cials. And that is Professor Jonathan 
Turley. 
Let me show you what I mean. These 
are his words. First, in a very detailed 
study, thorough study, he explained 
that ‘‘the resignation from office does 
not prevent trial on articles of im-
peachment.’’ 
Those are Professor Turley’s words. 
Same piece. He celebrated the Belknap 
trial. He described it as ‘‘a corrective 
measure that helped the system regain 
legitimacy.’’ 
He wrote another article—he has 
written several on this topic. This one 
is actually a 146-page study, very de-
tailed. 
In that study, he said that the deci-
sion in Belknap was ‘‘correct in its 
view that impeachments historically 
had extended to former officials, such 
as Warren Hastings,’’ who you heard 
Lead Manager RASKIN describe. 
In fact, as you can see, Professor 
Turley argued the House could impeach 
and the Senate could have tried Rich-
ard Nixon after he resigned. His quote 
on this is very telling: ‘‘Future Presi-
dents could not assume that mere res-
ignation would avoid a trial of their 
conduct’’ in the United States Senate. 
Finally, last quote from Professor 
Turley that ‘‘no man in no cir-
cumstance, can escape the account, 
which he owes to the laws of his coun-
try.’’ Not my words, not Lead Manager 
RASKIN’s 
words—Professor 
Jonathan 
Turley’s words. I agree with him be-
cause he is exactly right. 
Now, a question one might reason-
ably ask after going through all those 
quotes from such noted jurists and 
scholars: Why is there such agreement 
on this topic? Well, the reason is pretty 
simple. It is because it is what the Con-
stitution says. 
I want to walk you through three 
provisions of the Constitution that 
make clear that the Senate must try 
this case. 
First, let’s start with what the Con-
stitution says about Congress’s power 
in article I. You heard Lead Manager 
RASKIN make this point, but it is worth 
underscoring. Article I, section 2 gives 
the House ‘‘sole Power of Impeach-
ment.’’ Article I, section 3 gives the 
Senate the ‘‘sole Power to try all Im-
peachments.’’ 
Based on President Trump’s argu-
ment, one would think that language 
includes caveats, exceptions, but it 
doesn’t. It doesn’t say ‘‘Impeachment 
of current civil officers.’’ It doesn’t say 
‘‘Impeachment of those still in office.’’ 
The Framers didn’t mince words. 
They provided express, absolute, un-
qualified grants of jurisdictional power 
to the House to impeach and the Sen-
ate to try all impeachments—not some, 
all. 
Former Judge McConnell, the judge 
that we talked about earlier, he pro-
vides very effective textual analysis of 
this provision. You can see it up here 
on the slide. I will just give you the 
highlight. He says—and I will quote. 
This is Judge McConnell: 
Given that the impeachment of Mr. Trump 
was legitimate, the text makes clear that 
the Senate has power to try that impeach-
ment. 
Now, again, here is what—it is pretty 
interesting to me at least. We pre-
sented this argument in our trial brief, 
which we filed over a week ago, where 
we laid it out step by step so that you 
could consider it and so that opposing 
counsel could consider it as well. 
We received President Trump’s re-
sponse yesterday, and the trial brief of-
fers no rebuttal to this point—none. In 
fairness, I can’t think of any con-
vincing response. I mean, the Constitu-
tion is just exceptionally clear on this 
point. Now, perhaps they will have 
something to say today about it, but 
they did not yesterday. 
There is another provision worth 
mentioning here because there has 
been a lot of confusion about it. I am 
going to try to clear this up. This is 
the provision on removal and disquali-
fication. We all know the Senate im-
poses a judgment only when it con-
victs. Up on the screen, you will see ar-
ticle I, section 3, clause 7. With that in 
mind, the language says that if the 
Senate convicts, the judgment ‘‘shall 
not extend further than’’ removal and 
disqualification. 
That is it. The meaning is clear. The 
Senate has the power to impose re-
moval, which only applies to current 
officials. And, separately, it has the 
power 
to 
impose 
disqualification, 
which obviously applies to both cur-
rent and former officers. But it doesn’t 
have the power to go any further than 
that. 
Now, 
as 
I 
understand 
President 
Trump’s argument, they believe that 
this language somehow says that dis-
qualification can only follow the re-
moval of a current officer, but it 
doesn’t. 
That 
interpretation 
essen-
tially rewrites the Constitution. It 
adds words that aren’t there. I mean, 
after all, the Constitution does not say 
‘‘removal from office and then disquali-
fication.’’ It doesn’t say ‘‘removal from 
office followed by disqualification.’’ It 
simply says the Senate can’t do more 
than two possible sentences: removal 
and disqualification. 
This, by the way, is not the first time 
that this direct question has been de-
bated in this Chamber. One hundred 
forty-six years ago, during the Belknap 
trial, Senator George Edmunds of 
Vermont was one of the most pres-
tigious Republican Senators of his 
time. He sat right where Senator 
GRASSLEY sits today. He zeroed in on 
this exact point during the Belknap 
trial. 
This is his quote: 
A prohibition against doing more than two 
things cannot be turned into a command to 
do both or neither. 
And just imagine the consequences of 
such an absurd interpretation of the 
Constitution. If President Trump were 
right about that language, then offi-
cials could commit the most extraor-
dinary, destructive offenses against the 
American people—high crimes and mis-
demeanors. They would have total con-
trol over whether they could ever be 
impeached and, if they are, whether 
the Senate can try the case. If they 
want to escape any public inquiry into 
their misconduct or the risk of dis-
qualification from future office, then it 
is pretty simple. They could just resign 
1 minute before the House impeaches 
or even 1 minute before the Senate 
trial or they could resign during the 
Senate trial if it is not looking so well. 
That would effectively erase ‘‘disquali-
fication’’ from the Constitution. It 
would put wrongdoers in charge of 
whether the Senate can try them. 
The third and final reason why Presi-
dent Trump must stand trial: the pro-
vision of article I of the Constitution. 
You will see here on the screen that 
the Constitution twice describes the 
accused in an impeachment trial. Here 
is what I want you to focus on. The in-
teresting thing is notice the words. It 
refers to a ‘‘person’’ and a ‘‘party’’ 
being impeached. Now, again, we know 
that the Framers gave a lot of thought 
to the words that they chose. They 
even had a style committee during the 
Constitutional Convention. They could

February 9, 2021 
have written ‘‘civil officers’’ here. They 
did that elsewhere in the Constitution. 
That would, ultimately, have limited 
impeachment trials to current offi-
cials, but, instead, they used broader 
language to describe who could be tried 
by the United States Senate. 
So who could be put on trial for im-
peachment other than civil officers? 
Who else could a ‘‘person’’ or a ‘‘party’’ 
be? Well, really, there is only one pos-
sible answer: former officers. 
And, again, that actually might ex-
plain why, during the Belknap trial, 
Senator Thomas Bayard, of Delaware, 
who later became the Secretary of 
State for the United States—he sat 
right where Senator CARPER is sitting 
now—he found this point so compelling 
that he felt compelled to speak out on 
it. During the trial, he concluded that 
the Constitution must allow the im-
peachment and trial of people and par-
ties who are not civil officers, and the 
only group that could possibly encom-
pass was former officials like Belknap 
and, of course, here, like President 
Trump. 
Just so we are clear, in full disclo-
sure, this is another argument that was 
not addressed by President Trump in 
his rebuttal, and we know why they 
didn’t: because their argument doesn’t 
square with the plain text of the Con-
stitution. There is one provision that 
President Trump relies on almost ex-
clusively, article II, section 4. I am 
sure you will see it when they present 
their arguments. 
Their argument is that the language 
you will see on the screen somehow 
prevents you from holding this trial, 
by making removal from office an ab-
solute requirement—but, again, where 
does the language say that? Where does 
it say anything in that provision about 
your jurisdiction? In fact, this provi-
sion isn’t even in the part of the Con-
stitution that addresses your author-
ity. It is in article II, not article I, and 
it certainly says nothing about former 
officials. 
President 
Trump’s 
interpretation 
doesn’t 
square 
with 
history, 
originalism, textualism. In fact, even 
Chuck Cooper, the famous conservative 
lawyer I mentioned earlier, with cli-
ents like the House minority leader, 
has concluded that this provision of 
the Constitution that President Trump 
relies on ‘‘cuts against’’ his position— 
his words—and that is because, as Coo-
per says, article II, section 4 means 
just what it says. The first half de-
scribes what an official must do to be 
impeached—namely, 
commit 
high 
crimes and misdemeanors—and the sec-
ond half describes what happens when 
civil officers of the United States, in-
cluding the sitting President, are con-
victed: removal from office. That is it. 
In Cooper’s words: 
It simply establishes what is known in 
criminal law as a ‘‘mandatory minimum’’ 
punishment. 
It says nothing about former offi-
cials, nothing at all. 
Given all of that, it is not surprising 
that, in President Trump’s legal trial 
brief—a 75-page brief—they struggled 
to find any professors to support their 
position. They did cite one professor, 
though, Professor Kalt, an expert in 
this field, who they claim agreed with 
them that the only purpose of impeach-
ment is removal. Professor Kalt’s posi-
tion, which they had to have known be-
cause it is in the article that they cite 
in the brief, is that ‘‘removal’’ is ‘‘not 
the sole end of impeachment.’’ Actu-
ally, in that same article, he describes 
the 
view 
advocated 
by 
President 
Trump’s 
lawyers 
as 
having 
‘‘deep 
flaws.’’ 
Again, you do not have to take my 
word for it. You can take Professor 
Kalt’s word for it, the professor they 
cited in their brief, filed yesterday, be-
cause he tweeted about it on the screen 
here. This is what he had to say. I am 
not going to read through it in great 
detail. I will just simply give you the 
highlights. 
[President] Trump’s brief cites my 2001 ar-
ticle on late impeachment a lot. . . . But in 
several places, they misrepresent what I 
wrote quite badly. . . . There are multiple 
examples of such flat-out misrepresenta-
tions. . . . They didn’t have to be disingen-
uous and misleading. . . . 
This key constitutional scholar, re-
lied on by President Trump, said it just 
right. 
I have explained in great detail the 
many reasons the argument that Presi-
dent Trump advocates for here today is 
wrong. I just want to close with a note 
about why it is dangerous. 
Lead Manager RASKIN explained that 
impeachment exists to protect the 
American people from officials who 
abuse their power, who betray them. It 
exists for a case just like this one. 
Honestly, it is hard to imagine a 
clearer example of how a President 
could abuse his office: inciting violence 
against a coequal branch of govern-
ment while seeking to remain in power 
after losing an election—sitting back 
and watching it unfold. We all know 
the consequences. 
Like every one of you, I was in the 
Capitol on January 6. I was on the floor 
with Lead Manager RASKIN. Like every 
one of you, I was evacuated as this vio-
lent mob stormed the Capitol’s gates. 
What you experienced that day, what 
we experienced that day, what our 
country experienced that day was the 
Framers’ worst nightmare coming to 
life. Presidents can’t enflame insurrec-
tion in their final weeks and then walk 
away like nothing happened. Yet that 
is the rule that President Trump asks 
you to adopt. 
I urge you, we urge you to decline his 
request, to vindicate the Constitution, 
to let us try this case. 
Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Mr. Presi-
dent, distinguished Senators, my name 
is DAVID CICILLINE. I have the honor of 
representing the First Congressional 
District of Rhode Island. 
As I hope is now clear from the argu-
ments of Mr. RASKIN and Mr. NEGUSE, 
impeachment is not merely about re-
moving someone from office. Fun-
damentally, impeachment exists to 
protect our constitutional system, to 
keep each of us safe, to uphold our free-
dom, to safeguard our democracy. It 
achieves that by deterring abuse of the 
extraordinary power that we entrust to 
our Presidents from the very first day 
in office to the very last day. It also 
ensures accountability for Presidents 
who harm us or our government. In the 
aftermath of a tragedy, it allows us an 
opportunity to come together and to 
heal by working through what hap-
pened and reaffirming our constitu-
tional principles, and it authorizes this 
body and this body alone to disqualify 
from our political system anybody 
whose conduct in office proves that 
they present a danger to the Republic. 
But impeachment would fail to achieve 
these purposes if you created, for the 
first time ever, despite the words of the 
Framers and the Constitution, a Janu-
ary exception, as Mr. RASKIN explained. 
Now, I was a former defense lawyer 
for many years, and I can understand 
why President Trump and his lawyers 
don’t want you to hear this case, why 
they don’t want you to see the evi-
dence, but the argument that you lack 
jurisdiction rests on a purely fictional 
loophole—purely fictional—designed to 
allow the former President to escape 
all accountability for conduct that is 
truly indefensible under our Constitu-
tion. You saw the consequences of his 
actions on the video that we played 
earlier. I would like to emphasize in 
still greater detail the extraordinary 
constitutional offense that the former 
President thinks you have no power 
whatsoever to adjudicate. 
While spreading lies about the elec-
tion outcome, in a brazen attempt to 
retain power against the will of the 
American people, he incited an armed, 
angry mob to riot—and not just any-
where but here in the seat of our gov-
ernment, in the Capitol, during a joint 
session of Congress, when the Vice 
President presided while we carried out 
a peaceful transfer of power, which was 
interrupted for the first time in our 
history. This was a disaster of historic 
proportion. It was also an unforgivable 
betrayal of the oath of office of Presi-
dent Trump, the oath he swore, an oath 
that he sullied and dishonored to ad-
vance his own personal interests. 
And make no mistake about it, as 
you think about that day, things could 
have been much worse. As one Senator 
said, they could have killed all of us. It 
was only the bravery and sacrifice of 
the police, who suffered deaths and in-
juries as a result of President Trump’s 
actions, that prevented greater trag-
edy. 
At trial, we will prove with over-
whelming 
evidence 
that 
President 
Trump is singularly and directly re-
sponsible for inciting the assault on 
the Capitol. We will also prove that his 
dereliction of duty, his desire to seek 
personal advantage from the mayhem, 
and his decision to issue tweets, fur-
ther inciting the mob by attacking the 
Vice President, all compounded the al-
ready enormous damage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S595 
February 9, 2021 
Now, virtually every American who 
saw those events unfold on television 
was absolutely horrified by the events 
of January 6, but we also know how 
President Trump himself felt about the 
attack. He told us. Here is what he 
tweeted at 6:01 as the Capitol was in 
shambles and as dozens of police offi-
cers and other law enforcement officers 
lay battered and bruised and bloodied. 
Here is what he said: 
These are the things and events that hap-
pen when a sacred landslide election victory 
is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped 
away from great patriots who have been 
badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go 
home with love & in peace. Remember this 
day forever! 
Every time I read that tweet, it 
chills me to the core. The President of 
the United States sided with the insur-
rectionists. He celebrated their cause. 
He validated their attack. He told 
them, ‘‘Remember this day forever,’’ 
hours after they marched through 
these halls looking to assassinate Vice 
President Pence, the Speaker of the 
House, and any of us they could find. 
Given all that, it is no wonder that 
President Trump would rather talk 
about jurisdiction and a supposed Jan-
uary exception rather than talk about 
what happened on January 6. 
Make no mistake, his arguments are 
dead wrong. They are distractions from 
what really matters. The Senate can 
and should require President Trump to 
stand trial. 
My 
colleagues 
have 
already 
ad-
dressed many of President Trump’s ef-
forts to escape trial. I would like to 
cover the remainder and then address 
the broader issues at stake in this 
trial. 
For starters, in an extension of his 
mistaken reading of the Constitution, 
President Trump insists that he cannot 
face trial in the Senate because he is 
merely a private citizen. He references 
here the bill of attainder clause. 
But as Mr. NEGUSE just explained, 
the Constitution refers to the defend-
ant in an impeachment trial as a ‘‘Per-
son’’ and a ‘‘Party,’’ and certainly he 
counts as one of those. 
Let’s also apply some common sense. 
There is a reason that he now insists 
on being called ‘‘the 45th President of 
the United States’’ rather than ‘‘Cit-
izen Trump.’’ He isn’t a randomly se-
lected private citizen. He is a former 
officer of the United States Govern-
ment. He is a former President of the 
United States of America. He is treated 
differently under a law called the 
Former Presidents Act. 
For 4 years, we trusted him with 
more power than anyone else on Earth. 
As a former President, who promised 
on a Bible to use his power faithfully, 
he can and should answer for whether 
he kept that promise while bound by it 
in office. His insistence otherwise is 
just wrong, and so is his claim that 
there is a slippery slope to impeaching 
private citizens if you proceed. 
The trial of a former official for 
abuses he committed as an official, 
arising from an impeachment that oc-
curred while he was an official, poses 
absolutely no risk whatsoever of sub-
jecting a private citizen to impeach-
ment for their private conduct. 
To emphasize the point, President 
Trump was impeached while he was in 
office for conduct in office—period. 
The alternative, once again, is this 
January exception, in which our most 
powerful officials can commit the most 
terrible abuses and then resign, leave 
office, and suddenly claim that they 
are just a private citizen who can’t be 
held accountable at all. 
In the same vein, President Trump 
and his lawyers argue that he shouldn’t 
be impeached because it will set a bad 
precedent for impeaching others. But 
that slippery slope argument is also in-
correct. For centuries, the prevailing 
view has been that former officials are 
subject to impeachment. We just heard 
a full discussion of that. The House has 
repeatedly acknowledged that fact. 
But in the vast majority of cases, the 
House has rightly recognized that an 
official’s 
resignation 
or 
departure 
makes the extraordinary step of im-
peachment unnecessary and maybe 
even unwise. 
As a House manager rightly ex-
plained in the Belknap case, and I 
quote: 
There is no likelihood that we shall ever 
unlimber [the] clumsy and bulky monster 
piece of ordinance to take aim at an object 
from which all danger has gone by. 
President Trump’s case, though, is 
different. The danger has not ‘‘gone 
by.’’ His threat to democracy makes 
any prior abuse by any government of-
ficial pale in comparison. 
Moreover, allowing his conduct to 
pass without the most decisive re-
sponse would itself create an extraor-
dinary danger to the Nation, inviting 
further abuse of power and signaling 
that the Congress of the United States 
is unable or unwilling to respond to in-
surrection incited by the President. 
Think about that. 
To paraphrase Justice Robert Jack-
son, who said that precedent that I just 
described would lie about like a loaded 
weapon, ready for the hand of any fu-
ture President who decided in his final 
months to make a play for unlimited 
power—think of the danger. 
Here is the rare case in which love of 
the Constitution and commitment to 
our democracy required the House to 
impeach. It is for the same reason, the 
Senate can and must try this case. 
Next, President Trump will assert 
that it somehow is significant or it 
matters that the Chief Justice isn’t 
presiding over this trial. 
Let me state this very plainly: It 
does not matter. It is not significant. 
Under article I, section 3, ‘‘When the 
President of the United States is tried, 
the Chief Justice shall preside.’’ 
There is only one person who is 
President of the United States at a 
time. Right now, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 
is the 46th President of the United 
States. As a result, the requirement 
that the Chief Justice preside isn’t 
triggered. Instead, the normal rules of 
any impeachment of anyone other than 
the sitting President apply, and under 
those rules, the President Pro Tem-
pore, Senator LEAHY, can preside. 
And, of course, this makes perfect 
sense. The Chief Justice presides be-
cause, when the current President is on 
trial, if the Chief Justice doesn’t pre-
side, the Vice President presides, and it 
would be a conflict for someone to pre-
side over a trial that would become 
President if there was a conviction. So 
there isn’t that concern when you have 
a former President on trial, or, for that 
matter, when you have anyone on trial 
other 
than 
the 
current 
President, 
which is why the Chief Justice presides 
only in that single case, and why this 
is exactly the Presiding Officer the 
Constitution and the Senate rules re-
quire. 
As a fallback, President Trump and 
his lawyers may argue today that he 
should get a free pass on inciting an 
armed insurrection against the United 
States Government and endangering 
Congress because, as he would put it, 
this impeachment is somehow uncon-
stitutional. 
So far as I understand it, from read-
ing the pleadings in this case, this de-
fense involves cobbling together a 
bunch of meritless legal arguments, all 
of them attempting to focus on sub-
stance rather than jurisdiction and in-
sisting that these kitchen-sink objec-
tions lead the Senate to not try the 
case. 
Since they may raise these points, at 
this juncture I feel obliged, really, to 
address them. 
He may argue, for example, that he 
didn’t receive enough process in the 
House, even though the House pro-
ceedings are more like a grand jury ac-
tion, which is followed later by trial in 
the Senate, with a full presentation of 
evidence; even though the evidence of 
his high crimes and misdemeanors is 
overwhelming and supported by a huge 
public record; even though we are 
going to put that evidence before you 
at this trial; and even though he had a 
full and fair opportunity to respond to 
it before all of you; even though hun-
dreds of others involved in the events 
of January 6 have already been charged 
for their role in the attacks that the 
President incited; and even though we 
invited him to voluntarily come here 
and testify and tell his story, a re-
quest, as you know, that his lawyers 
immediately refused, presumably be-
cause they understood what would hap-
pen if he were to testify under oath. 
Regardless, President Trump’s proc-
ess arguments are not only wrong on 
their own terms, but they are also 
completely irrelevant to the question 
of whether you should hold this trial. 
That question is answered by the Con-
stitution, and the answer is yes. 
In addition, separate from his due 
process complaints, President Trump 
and his counsel—particularly his coun-
sel—have both said on TV that to

counter the undisputed evidence of 
what actually happened in this case, 
you will see video clips. They will show 
video clips of other politicians, includ-
ing Democratic politicians, using what 
they consider incendiary language. 
Apparently, they think this will es-
tablish some sort of equivalency or 
that it will show, in contrast, that 
President Trump’s statements at the 
Save America rally weren’t so bad. 
Like so much of what President 
Trump’s lawyers might say today, that 
is a gimmick. It is a parlor game, 
meant to inflame partisan hostility 
and play on our divisions. 
So let me be crystal clear. President 
Trump was not impeached because the 
words he used, viewed in isolation, 
without context, were beyond the pale. 
Plenty of other politicians have used 
strong language. But Donald J. Trump 
was President of the United States. He 
sought to overturn a Presidential elec-
tion that had been upheld by every sin-
gle court to consider it. He spent 
months insisting to his base that the 
only way he could lose was a dan-
gerous, 
wide-ranging 
conspiracy 
against them and America itself. 
He relentlessly attempted to per-
suade his followers that the peaceful 
transfer of power that was taking place 
in the Capitol was an abomination that 
had to be stopped at all costs. 
He flirted with groups like the Proud 
Boys, telling them to ‘‘stand back and 
stand by,’’ while endorsing violence 
and sparking death threats to his oppo-
nents. 
He summoned an armed, angry, and 
dangerous crowd that wanted to keep 
him in power and was widely reported 
to be poised on a hair trigger for vio-
lence at his direction. 
He then made his heated statements 
in circumstances where it was clear, 
where it was foreseeable, that those 
statements would spark extraordinary, 
imminent violence. 
He then failed to defend the Capitol, 
the Congress, and the Vice President 
during the insurrection, engaging in 
extraordinary dereliction of duty and 
desertion of duty that was only pos-
sible because of the high office he held. 
He issued statements during the in-
surrection targeting the Vice President 
and reiterating the very same lies 
about the election that had launched 
the violence in the first place. 
And he issued a tweet 5 hours after 
the Capitol was sacked in which he 
sided with the bad guys. 
We all know that context matters, 
that office and meaning and intent and 
consequences matter. Simply put, it 
matters when and where and how we 
speak. The oaths we have sworn and 
the power we hold matter. 
President Trump was not impeached 
because he used words that the House 
decided are forbidden or unpopular. He 
was impeached for inciting armed vio-
lence against the Government of the 
United States of America. 
This leads me to a few final thoughts 
about why it is so important for you to 
hear this case, as authorized and as, in-
deed, required by our history and by 
the Constitution. 
President Trump’s lawyers will say, I 
expect, that you should dismiss his 
case so that the country can ‘‘move 
on.’’ They will assert that this im-
peachment is partisan, and that the 
spirit of bipartisanship and bipartisan 
cooperation requires us to drop the 
case and march forward in unity. 
With all due respect, every premise 
and every conclusion of that argument 
is wrong. 
Just 
weeks 
ago—weeks 
ago—the 
President of the United States literally 
incited an armed attack on the Capitol, 
our seat of government, while seeking 
to retain power by subverting an elec-
tion he lost, and then celebrated the 
attack. 
People died. People were brutally in-
jured. President Trump’s actions en-
dangered every single Member of Con-
gress, his own Vice President, thou-
sands of congressional staffers, and our 
own Capitol Police and other law en-
forcement. 
This was a national tragedy, a dis-
aster for America’s standing in the 
world, and President Trump is sin-
gularly responsible for inciting it. 
As we will prove, the attack on the 
Capitol was not solely the work of ex-
tremists lurking in the shadows. In-
deed, does anyone in this Chamber hon-
estly believe that, but for the conduct 
of President Trump, that charge in the 
Article of Impeachment, that that at-
tack at the Capitol would have oc-
curred? Does anybody believe that? 
And now his lawyers will come before 
you and insist, even as the Capitol is 
still surrounded with barbed wire and 
fences and soldiers, that we should just 
move on, let bygones be bygones, and 
allow President Trump to walk away 
without any accountability, any reck-
oning, any consequences. That cannot 
be right. That is not unity. That is the 
path to fear of what future Presidents 
could do. 
So there is a good reason why this 
Article of Impeachment passed the 
House with bipartisan support. The 
principles at stake belong to all Ameri-
cans through all walks of life. We have 
a common interest in making clear 
that there are lines nobody can cross, 
especially the President of the United 
States, and so we share an interest in 
this trial where the truth can be shown 
and where President Trump can be 
called to account for his offenses. 
William Faulkner famously wrote 
that ‘‘the past is never dead.’’ But this 
isn’t even the past. This just happened. 
It is still happening. Look around as 
you come to the Capitol and come to 
work. I really do not believe that our 
attention span is so short, that our 
sense of duty so frail, our factional loy-
alty so all-consuming, that the Presi-
dent can provoke an attack on Con-
gress itself and get away with it just 
because it occurred near the end of his 
term. 
After a betrayal like this, there can-
not be unity without accountability. 
And this is exactly what the Constitu-
tion calls for. The Framers’ original 
understanding, this Chamber’s own 
precedent, and the very words used in 
the Constitution all confirm unques-
tionably, indisputably, that President 
Trump must stand trial for his high 
crimes and misdemeanors against the 
American people. 
We must not, we cannot continue 
down the path of partisanship and divi-
sion that has turned the Capitol into 
an armed fortress. 
Senators, it now falls to you to bring 
our country together by holding this 
trial and, once all the evidence is be-
fore you, by delivering justice. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Senators, Mr. 
President, to close, I want to say some-
thing personal about the stakes of this 
decision whether President Trump can 
stand trial and be held to account for 
inciting insurrection against us. 
This trial is personal indeed for every 
Senator, for every Member of the 
House, every manager, all of our staff, 
the Capitol Police, the Washington, 
DC, Metropolitan Police, the National 
Guard, the maintenance and custodial 
crews, the print journalists and TV 
people who were here, and all of our 
families and friends. I hope this trial 
reminds America how personal democ-
racy is and how personal is the loss of 
democracy too. 
Distinguished Members of the Sen-
ate, my youngest daughter, Tabitha, 
was there with me on Wednesday, Jan-
uary 6. It was the day after we buried 
her brother, our son Tommy, the sad-
dest day of our lives. Also there was 
my son-in-law Hank, who is married to 
our oldest daughter, Hannah, and I con-
sider him a son, too, even though he 
eloped with my daughter and didn’t 
tell us what they were going to do. But 
it was in the middle of COVID–19. 
But the reason they came with me 
that Wednesday, January 6, was be-
cause they wanted to be together with 
me in the middle of a devastating week 
for our family, and I told them I had to 
go back to work because we were 
counting electoral votes that day on 
January 6. It was our constitutional 
duty. And I invited them instead to 
come with me to witness this historic 
event, the peaceful transfer of power in 
America. And they said they heard 
that President Trump was calling on 
his followers to come to Washington to 
protest, and they asked me directly: 
Would it be safe? Would it be safe? And 
I told them: Of course it should be safe. 
This is the Capitol. 
STENY HOYER, our majority leader, 
had kindly offered me the use of his of-
fice on the House floor because I was 
one of the managers that day and we 
were going through our grief. So Tab-
itha and Hank were with me in STENY’s 
office as colleagues dropped by to con-
sole us about the loss of our middle 
child, Tommy, our beloved Tommy. 
Mr. NEGUSE and Mr. CICILLINE actu-
ally came to see me that day. Dozens of 
Members—lots of Republicans, lots of 
Democrats—came to see me, and I felt

a sense of being lifted up from the 
agony, and I won’t forget their tender-
ness. 
Through the tears, I was working on 
a speech to the floor when we would all 
be together in joint session, and I 
wanted to focus on unity when we met 
in the House. I quoted Abraham Lin-
coln’s famous 1878 Lyceum speech, 
where he said that if division and de-
struction ever come to America, it 
won’t come from abroad, it will come 
from within, said Lincoln, and in that 
same speech, Lincoln passionately de-
plored mob violence. This was right 
after the murder of Elijah Lovejoy, the 
abolitionist newspaper writer. Lincoln 
deplored mob violence, and he deplored 
mob rule, and he said it would lead to 
tyranny and despotism in America. 
That was the speech I gave that day 
after the House very graciously and 
warmly welcomed me back. Tabitha 
and Hank came with me to the floor, 
and they watched it from the Gallery, 
and when it was over, they went back 
to that office, STENY’s office off of the 
House floor. They didn’t know that the 
House had been breached yet and that 
an insurrection or a riot or a coup had 
come to Congress, and by the time we 
learned about it, about what was going 
on, it was too late. I couldn’t get out 
there to be with them in that office. 
And all around me, people were calling 
their wives and their husbands and 
their loved ones to say goodbye. 
Members of Congress in the House 
were removing their congressional pins 
so they wouldn’t be identified by the 
mob as they tried to escape the vio-
lence. Our new Chaplain got up and 
said a prayer for us, and we were told 
to put our gas masks on, and then 
there was a sound I will never forget, 
the sound of pounding on the door like 
a battering ram, the most haunting 
sound I have ever heard, and I will 
never forget it. 
My chief of staff, Julie Tagen, was 
with Tabitha and Hank, locked and 
barricaded in that office, the kids hid-
ing under the desk, placing what they 
thought were their final texts and 
whispered phone calls to say their 
goodbyes. They thought they were 
going to die. My son-in-law had never 
even been to the Capitol before. 
When they were finally rescued over 
an hour later by Capitol officers and we 
were together, I hugged them, and I 
apologized, and I told my daughter 
Tabitha, who is 24 and a brilliant alge-
bra teacher in Teach for America now, 
I told her how sorry I was, and I prom-
ised her that it would not be like this 
again the next time she came back to 
the Capitol with me. And do you know 
what she said? She said: Dad, I don’t 
want to come back to the Capitol. 
Of all the terrible, cruel things I saw 
and I heard on that day and since then, 
that one hit me the hardest, that and 
watching someone use an American 
flagpole, with the flag still on it, to 
spear and pummel one of our police of-
ficers, ruthlessly, mercilessly tortured 
by a pole with a flag on it that he was 
defending with his very life. 
People died that day. Officers ended 
up with head damage and brain dam-
age. People’s eyes were gouged. An offi-
cer had a heart attack. An officer lost 
three fingers that day. Two officers 
have taken their own lives. 
Senators, this cannot be our future. 
This cannot be the future of America. 
We cannot have Presidents inciting and 
mobilizing mob violence against our 
government and our institutions be-
cause they refuse to accept the will of 
the people under the Constitution of 
the United States. Much less can we 
create a new January exception in our 
precious, beloved Constitution that 
prior generations have died for and 
fought for, so that corrupt Presidents 
have several weeks to get away with 
whatever it is they want to do. History 
does not support a January exception 
in any way, so why would we invent 
one for the future? 
We close, Mr. President. 
RECESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that there now be a 
10-minute break. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate recess for 10 min-
utes. 
There being no objection, at 2:41 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 3:01 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the President

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
Castor has 2 hours, and Mr. RASKIN has 
33 minutes. 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. May I proceed, 
Mr. President? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. You 
may. 
COUNSELS’ OPENING STATEMENTS 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Mr. President 
and Members of the U.S. Senate, thank 
you for taking the time to hear from 
me. 
My name is Bruce Castor. I am the 
lead prosecutor—lead counsel—for the 
45th President of the United States. I 
was an assistant DA for such a long 
time, I keep saying ‘‘prosecutor,’’ but I 
do 
understand 
the 
difference, 
Mr. 
RASKIN. 
Before I begin, I want to comment on 
the outstanding presentation from our 
opponents and the emotion that cer-
tainly 
welled 
up 
in 
Congressman 
RASKIN
about his family being here 
during that terrible day. 
You will not hear any member of the 
team representing former President 
Trump say anything but, in the strong-
est possible way, denounce the violence 
of the rioters and those who breached 
the Capitol, the very citadel of our de-
mocracy—literally, the symbol that 
flashes on television whenever you are 
trying to explain that we are talking 
about the United States, an instant 
symbol. To have it attacked is repug-
nant in every sense of the word. 
The loss of life is horrific. I spent 
many long years prosecuting homicide 
cases, catching criminals who com-
mitted murders. I have quite an exten-
sive experience in dealing with the 
aftermath of those things. 
Certainly, as an FOP member and a 
member of many police organizations 
myself, we mourn the loss of the Cap-
itol Police officer, whom I understand 
is laying not too far away from here. 
And, you know, many of you in this 
room, over your careers, before they 
reached this summit here in the Sen-
ate, would have had times where you 
represented your local communities as 
assistant district attorneys, assistant 
Commonwealth 
attorneys, 
assistant 
State attorneys. And you know this to 
be true—that when a horrific event oc-
curred in your county or in your juris-
diction, if it was a State jurisdiction, 
you know that there was a terrible out-
cry, and the public immediately reacts 
with a desire that someone pay because 
something really bad happened. And 
that is a natural reaction of human 
beings. It is a natural reaction of 
human beings because we are generally 
a social people. We enjoy being around 
one another, even in DC. 
We recognize that people all the 
world over, and especially Americans 
who share that special bond with one 
another, love the freedoms that this 
country gives us. And we all feel that if 
somebody is unsafe when they are 
walking down the street, that the next 
person who is unsafe could be you, your 
spouse, one of your children, some 
other person that you love and know 
personally. 
So you will never hear anybody rep-
resenting former President Trump say 
anything at all other than what hap-
pened on January 6 and the storming 
and breaching of the Capitol should be 
denounced in the most vigorous terms, 
nor that those persons responsible 
should be prosecuted to the fullest ex-
tent that our laws allow. 
Indeed, I have followed some of those 
cases and those prosecutions, and it 
seems to me that we are doing a pretty 
good job of identifying and prosecuting 
those persons who committed those of-
fenses. And I commend the FBI and the 
District of Columbia police and the 
other Agencies for their work. 
It is natural to recoil. It is an imme-
diate thing. It comes over you without 
your ability to stop it, the desire for 
retribution. Who caused this awful 
thing? How do we make them pay? 
We recognize in the law—and I know 
many of you are lawyers. Probably, 
lawyers—some of you have been a law-
yer for 35 years, longer than me— 
many, longer than me, probably. And 
we know we have a specific body of law 
that deals with passion and rage, blind-
ing logic and reason. That is the dif-
ference 
between 
manslaughter 
and 
murder. 
Manslaughter is the killing of a 
human being upon sudden and intense 
provocation. But murder is done with 
cold blood and reflective thought. 
We are so understanding of the con-
cept that people’s minds can be over-
powered with emotion, where logic 
does not immediately kick in, that we 
have recognized examples that other-
wise would be hearsay, and said that,

no, when you are driving down the 
street and you look over at your wife 
and you say: ‘‘Hey, you know what, 
that guy is about to drive through the 
red light and kill that person,’’ your 
wife can testify to what you said be-
cause, even though it is technically 
hearsay, it is an exception because it is 
the event living through the person. 
Why? No opportunity for reflective 
thought. 
There are all sorts of examples that 
we recognize in the law for why people 
immediately desire retribution, imme-
diately recognize in the law that people 
can be overcome by events. 
And you know, Senators of the 
United States, they are not ordinary 
people. They are extraordinary peo-
ple—in the technical sense, extraor-
dinary people. 
When I was growing up in suburban 
Philadelphia, my parents were big fans 
of Senator Everett Dirksen from Illi-
nois. Senator Dirksen recorded a series 
of lectures that my parents had on a 
record. We still know what records are, 
right? The thing you put the needle 
down on and you play it. 
And here is little Bruce—8, 9, 10 years 
old—listening to this back in the 1960s. 
And I would be listening to that voice. 
If you ever heard Everett Dirksen’s 
voice, it is the most commanding, 
gravelly voice that just oozes belief 
and sincerity. He must have been a 
phenomenal U.S. Senator. He doesn’t 
talk about ordinary people, as we do in 
the law. We apply the ordinary person 
standard. He talks about extraordinary 
people. He talks about ‘‘Gallant Men,’’ 
which was the name of the album, and, 
now, of course, as a sign of the times, 
gallant men and women. 
I would watch television, and I would 
watch Senator Goldwater or Senator 
Byrd or Senator Mansfield or Senator 
Dole, and I would be fascinated by 
these great men. 
And everybody’s parents say this 
when they are growing up: You could 
grow up to be a U.S. Senator. You 
could do that. They are just men and 
women like you are. 
Well, then, Everett Dirksen tells us 
that they are not; they are gallant men 
and 
women 
who 
do 
extraordinary 
things when their country needs them 
to do it. 
U.S. Senators really are different. I 
have been around U.S. Senators before. 
Two of them in this room from Penn-
sylvania, I would like to think, are 
friendly toward me or at least friends 
of mine when we are not politically ad-
verse. And I have been around their 
predecessors. 
One thing I have discovered, whether 
it be Democrats or Republicans, U.S. 
Senators are patriots first—patriots 
first. They love their country. They 
love their families. They love the 
States that they represent. 
There isn’t a Member in this room 
who has not used the term ‘‘I represent 
the great State of’’—fill in the blank. 
Why? Because they are all great? Yeah. 
But you think yours is greater than 
others because these are your people. 
These are the people who sent you here 
to do their work. They trusted you 
with the responsibility of representa-
tive government. 
You know, I feel proud to know my 
Senators—Senator CASEY, up here in 
the back, and Senator TOOMEY, over to 
the left. 
You know, it is funny. This is an 
aside, but it is funny. Do you ever no-
tice how, when you are talking or you 
hear others talking about you, when 
you are home in your State, they will 
say, ‘‘You know, I talked to my Sen-
ator’’ or ‘‘I talked to somebody on the 
staff of my Senator’’? It is always ‘‘my 
Senator.’’ 
Why is it that we say ‘‘my Senator’’? 
We say that because the people you 
represent are proud of their Senators. 
They absolutely feel that connection of 
pride because that is not just PAT 
TOOMEY of Pennsylvania. That is my 
Senator from Pennsylvania. Or BOB 
CASEY from Scranton—that is my Sen-
ator. 
And you like that. People like that. 
The people back home really do. 
U.S. Senators have a reputation, and 
it is deserved. They have a reputation 
for coolheadedness, being erudite—the 
men and women who we send from 
back home to DC to look after our in-
terests. We feel a sense of ownership 
and a sense of pride in our Senators. 
There is plenty of times I have been 
around in political gatherings where I 
hear, There is no way Senator TOOMEY 
is going to allow that—I don’t mean to 
pick you on, PAT—or There is no way 
Senator CASEY is going to allow that— 
because we feel pride. 
When something bad is potentially in 
the wind, we expect our U.S. Senators 
not reacting to popular will and not re-
acting to popular emotions. We expect 
them to do what is right, notwith-
standing what is immediately and ex-
pedient that the media tells us is the 
topic of the day. 
So Senators are patriots. Senators 
are family men and women. They are 
fierce advocates for the great State 
which they represent. And somewhere 
far down that list of attributes, way 
below patriot and way below love of 
family and country and way below 
fierce advocates for their States, far 
down—at least that is what I thought, 
anyway, and I still think that. Some-
where far down that list, Senators have 
some obligation to be partisans, to rep-
resent a group of beliefs that are simi-
lar to beliefs shared by other United 
States Senators. 
I understand that. And, in fact, I 
have no problem with that system. It 
helps us debate and decide what is best 
for America, the robust debate of dif-
ferent points of view. And I dare say 
that Senator SCHUMER
and Senator 
MCCONNELL represent those things in 
this body and make sure that every-
thing is talked out and robustly de-
bated in this room before United States 
Senators make a decision of extreme 
importance to the people they rep-
resent. 
I know you aren’t allowed to talk, 
but I don’t see either one of them 
jumping up and saying I am wrong 
about that because I think that that is 
what happens. I think United States 
Senators try to listen to each other’s 
views. I think United States Senators 
try to do what is right for the country, 
and far down is partisanship. 
In our system of government, and if 
you read the Federalist Papers—we are 
very fortunate because the Federalist 
Papers were authored as an expla-
nation for why it is the States, the 
original States, should adopt the Con-
stitution. These were persuasive docu-
ments about why the Constitution is a 
good thing, because if the individual 
State legislatures didn’t adopt the Con-
stitution, we would not have it. 
So Mr. Jay and Mr. Madison and Mr. 
Hamilton, they had an incentive to ex-
plain what they were thinking when 
they wrote it because they are explain-
ing to other erudite people who rep-
resent individual States why it is that 
they feel that this is the right thing to 
do. And, in fact, as many of you well 
know, Madison had to promise that 
there would be a Bill of Rights imme-
diately upon adoption or we wouldn’t 
have a Constitution. Even then there 
was horse trading going on in the legis-
lative body of the United States. 
The other day, when I was down here 
in Washington—I came down earlier in 
the week to try to figure out how to 
find my way around. I worked in this 
building 40 years ago. I got lost then, 
and I still do. 
But in studying the Constitution in 
all the years I was a prosecutor, where 
so many things depend on interpreta-
tions of phrases in the Constitution, I 
learned that this body, which one of 
my worthy colleagues said is the great-
est deliberative body in the entire 
world—and I agree—that was—that 
particular aspect of our government 
was intentionally created, if you read 
the Federalist Papers. 
The last time a body such as the 
United States Senate sat at the pin-
nacle of government with the responsi-
bility that it has today, it was hap-
pening in Athens and it was happening 
in Rome. 
Republicanism, the form of govern-
ment republicanism, throughout his-
tory has always and without exception 
fallen because of fights from within, 
because of partisanship from within, 
because of bickering from within. And 
in each one of those examples that I 
mentioned—and there are certainly 
others, probably, that are smaller 
countries that lasted for less time that 
I don’t know about off the top of my 
head. 
But each one of them, once there was 
the vacuum created that the greatest 
deliberative 
bodies—the 
Senate 
of 
Greece sitting in Athens, the Senate of 
Rome—the moment that they devolved 
into such partisanship, it is not as 
though they ceased to exist; they 
ceased to exist as representative de-
mocracy, 
both 
replaced 
by 
totali-
tarianism.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S599 
February 9, 2021 
Paraphrasing the famous quote from 
Benjamin Franklin, who, as a Philadel-
phian, I feel as though I can do that be-
cause he is my Founding Father too: 
He who would trade liberty for some 
temporary security deserves neither 
liberty nor security. If we restrict lib-
erty to attain security, we will lose 
both. 
And isn’t the way we have enshrined 
in the Constitution the concepts of lib-
erty that we think are critical, the 
very concepts of liberty that drove us 
to separate from Great Britain—and I 
can’t believe these fellas are quoting 
what happened prerevolution as though 
that is somehow of value to us. 
We left the British system. If we are 
really going to use prerevolutionary 
history in Great Britain, then the 
precedent is we have a Parliament and 
we have a King. Is that the precedent 
that we are heading for? 
Now, it is not an accident that the 
very first liberty—if you grant me that 
our liberties are enumerated in the Bill 
of Rights, it is not an accident that the 
very first liberty in the first article of 
the Bill of Rights is the First Amend-
ment, which says: ‘‘Congress shall 
make no law . . . abridging freedom of 
speech,’’ and et cetera. ‘‘Congress shall 
make no law . . . ’’—the very first one, 
the most important one, the ability to 
have free and robust debate, free and 
robust political speech. 
Something that Mr. RASKIN and his 
team brought up is that it is somehow 
a suggestion from former President 
Trump’s team that when various public 
officials were not denouncing the vio-
lence that we saw over the summer, 
that that was somehow the former 
President equating that speech to his 
own. Not at all. Exactly backwards. 
I saw a headline: Representative so- 
and-so seeks to walk back comments 
about—I forget what it was—something 
that bothered her. I was devastated 
when I saw that she thought it was 
necessary to go on television yesterday 
or the day before and say she needs to 
walk back her comments. 
She should be able to comment as 
much as she wants, and she should be 
able to say exactly as she feels. And if 
she feels that the supporters of then- 
President Trump are not worthy of 
having their ideas considered, she 
should be permitted to say that, and 
anybody who agrees should be per-
mitted to say they agree. That is what 
we broke away from Great Britain in 
order to be able to do: to be able to say 
what we thought in the most robust po-
litical debate. 
My colleague Mike van der Veen is 
going to give you a recitation on the 
First Amendment law of the United 
States. I commend to your attention 
the analysis that he is going to give 
you. 
I don’t expect and I don’t believe that 
the former President expects anybody 
to walk back any of the language. If 
that is how they feel about the way 
things transpired over the last couple 
of years in this country, they should be 
allowed to say that, and I will go to 
court and defend them if anything hap-
pens to them as a result. If the govern-
ment takes action against that State 
representative or that U.S. Representa-
tive who wants to walk back her com-
ments, if the government takes action 
against her, I have no problem going 
into court and defending her right to 
say those things, even though I don’t 
agree with them. 
This trial is not about trading liberty 
for security. It is about trading—it is 
about suggesting that it is a good idea 
that we give up those liberties that we 
have so long fought for. We have sent 
armies to other parts of the world to 
convince those governments to imple-
ment the freedoms that we enjoy. 
This trial is about trading liberty for 
the security from the mob? Honestly, 
no, it can’t be. We can’t be thinking 
about that. We can’t possibly be sug-
gesting that we punish people for polit-
ical speech in this country. And if peo-
ple go and commit lawless acts as a re-
sult of their beliefs and they cross the 
line, they should be locked up. 
And, in fact, I have seen quite a num-
ber of the complaints that were filed 
against the people who breached the 
Capitol. Some of them charged con-
spiracy. Not a single one I noticed 
charged conspiracy with the 45th Presi-
dent of the United States, probably be-
cause prosecutors have an ethical re-
quirement that they are not allowed to 
charge people with criminal offenses 
without probable cause. You might 
consider that. 
And if we go down the road that my 
very 
worthy 
adversary 
here, 
Mr. 
RASKIN, asks you to go down, the flood-
gates will open. I was going to say it 
will—instead of ‘‘floodgates,’’ I was 
going to say originally it will ‘‘release 
the whirlwind,’’ which is a Biblical ref-
erence, but I subsequently learned, 
since I got here, that that particular 
phrase has already been taken, so I fig-
ured I had better change it to ‘‘flood-
gates.’’ 
But the political pendulum will shift 
one day. This Chamber and the Cham-
ber across the way will change one day, 
and partisan impeachments will be-
come commonplace. 
You know, until the impeachment of 
Bill Clinton, no one alive had ever 
lived through a Presidential impeach-
ment, not unless some of you are 150 
years old. Not a single person alive had 
lived through a Presidential impeach-
ment. Now most of us have lived 
through three of them. 
This is supposed to be the ultimate 
safety valve, the last thing that hap-
pens, the most rare treatment, and a 
session where this body is sitting as a 
Court of Impeachment among the most 
rare things it does. 
So the slippery-slope principle will 
have taken hold if we continue to go 
forward with what is happening today 
and scheduled to happen later this 
week. And after we are long done here 
and after there has been a shift in the 
political winds and after there is a 
change in the makeup of the United 
States House of Representatives and 
maybe a change in the makeup of the 
United States Senate, the pressure 
from those folks back home, especially 
for Members of the House, is going to 
be tremendous because, remember, the 
Founders recognized that the argument 
that I started with, that political pres-
sure is driven by the need for imme-
diate action because something under 
contemporary 
community 
standards 
really horrific happened and the people 
represented by the Members of the 
United States House of Representatives 
become incensed. 
And what do you do if a Federal 
issue—you are back in suburban Phila-
delphia and something happens that 
makes the people who live there in-
censed? You call your Congressman. 
And your Congressman, elected every 2 
years, with their pulse on the people of 
their district, 750,000 people, they re-
spond. And, boy, do they respond. The 
Congressman calls you back, a staffer 
calls you back, and you get all the in-
formation that they have on the issue. 
Sometimes you even get invited to sub-
mit 
language 
that 
would 
improve 
whatever the issue is. 
Well, when the pendulum swings, per-
haps the next person who gets im-
peached and is sent here for you to con-
sider is Eric Holder during Fast and 
Furious, the Attorney General of the 
United States, or any other person 
whom the other party considers to be a 
political danger to them down the road 
because of their avowed abilities and 
being articulate and having a resume 
that shows that they are capable. 
I picked Eric simply because I think 
he has a tremendous—he has had a tre-
mendous career, and he might be some-
body whom some Republicans some-
where might be worried about. So 
maybe the next person they go after is 
Eric Holder. 
And, you know, the Republicans 
might regain the House in 2 years. His-
tory does tend to suggest that the 
party out of power in the White House 
does well in the midterm elections. 
Certainly, the 2020 elections, the House 
gained—the House majority narrowed, 
and there was a gain of Republicans. 
The Members of the House—they 
have 
to 
worry 
about 
these 
con-
sequences because if they don’t react 
to whatever the problem of the day is, 
somebody in that jurisdiction there— 
somebody is going to say: If you make 
me the Congressman, I react to that. 
And that means that the sitting Mem-
ber has to worry about it because their 
terms are short. 
And it is not just Members of the 
House of Representatives with their 
short—with their short terms. I saw on 
television the last couple of days the 
honorable gentleman from Nebraska, 
Mr. SASSE—I saw that he faced back-
lash back home because of a vote he 
made some weeks ago, that the polit-
ical party was complaining about a de-
cision he made as a United States Sen-
ator.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S600 
February 9, 2021 
You know, it is interesting because I 
don’t want to steal the thunder from 
the other lawyers, but Nebraska, you 
are going to hear, is quite a judicial- 
thinking place, and just maybe Senator 
SASSE is onto something, and you will 
hear about what it is that the Ne-
braska courts have to say about the 
issue that you all are deciding this 
week. There seem to be some pretty 
smart jurists in Nebraska, and I can’t 
believe a United States Senator doesn’t 
know that. 
A Senator like the gentleman from 
Nebraska, whose Supreme Court his-
tory is ever present in his mind, and 
rightfully so, he faces the whirlwind 
even though he knows what the judici-
ary in his State thinks. 
People back home will demand their 
House Members continue the cycle as 
political fortunes rise and fall. The 
only entity that stands between the 
bitter in-fighting that led to the down-
fall of the Greek Republic and the 
Roman Republic and the American Re-
public is the Senate of the United 
States. 
Shall the business of the Senate and 
thus the Nation come to a halt, not 
just for the current weeks while a new 
President is trying to fill out his ad-
ministration, but shall the business of 
the Senate and the Nation come to a 
halt because impeachment becomes the 
rule rather than the rare exception? I 
know you can see this as a possibility 
because not a single one of you ever 
thought that you would be doing a sec-
ond impeachment inside of 13 months, 
and the pressure will be enormous to 
respond in kind. 
To quote Everett Dirksen, the gal-
lant men and women of the Senate will 
not allow that to happen. And this Re-
public will endure because the top re-
sponsibility of the United States Sen-
ator and the top characteristic that 
you all have in common—and, boy, this 
is a diverse group, but there isn’t a sin-
gle one of you who, A, doesn’t consider 
yourself a patriot of the United States, 
and 2, there isn’t a single one of you 
who doesn’t consider the other 99 to be 
patriots of the United States. And that 
is why this attack on the Constitution 
will not prevail. 
The document that is before you is 
flawed. The rule of the Senate con-
cerning impeachment documents, Arti-
cles of Impeachment, rule XXIII, says 
that such documents cannot be divided. 
You might have seen that we wrote 
that in the answer. It might have been 
a little legalistic or legalese for the 
newspapers to opine on very much, but 
there is some significance. 
The House managers, clever fellows 
that they are, they cast a broad net. 
They need to get 67 of you to agree 
they are right. And that is a good 
strategy. I would use the same strat-
egy, except there is a rule that says 
you can’t use that strategy. You see, 
rule XXIII says that the Article of Im-
peachment is indivisible, and the rea-
son why that is significant is you have 
to agree that every single aspect of the 
entire document warrants impeach-
ment because it is an all-or-nothing 
document. You can’t cut out parts that 
you agree with that warrant impeach-
ment and parts that don’t, because it is 
not divisible. It flat-out says in the 
Senate rules it is not divisible. 
Now, previous impeachments, like 
President Clinton’s, said the President 
shall be found guilty of high crimes 
and misdemeanors for engaging in one 
or more of the following and then gives 
a list, so all you had to do was win one, 
but they didn’t do that here. It has to 
be all or nothing. 
Some of these things that you are 
asked to consider might be close calls 
in your mind, but one of them is not. 
The argument about the 14th Amend-
ment is absolutely ridiculous. The 
House managers tell you that the 
President should be impeached because 
he violated the 14th Amendment. Here 
is what the 14th Amendment says: 
No person shall be a Senator or Represent-
ative in Congress, or elector of President and 
Vice President, or hold any office, civil or 
military, under the United States, or [any 
other] state, who, having previously taken 
an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an 
officer of the United States, or [as] a member 
of any state legislature, or as an executive or 
judicial officer of any state, to support the 
Constitution of the United States, [and] 
shall have engaged in insurrection or rebel-
lion against the same, or given aid or com-
fort to the enemies thereof. But Congress 
may vote by two-thirds of each House [to] re-
move such disability. 
It 
doesn’t 
take 
a 
constitutional 
scholar to recognize that that is writ-
ten for people who fought for the Con-
federacy or who were previous military 
officers or were in the government of 
the Confederacy, and it doesn’t take a 
constitutional scholar to require that 
they be convicted first in a court, with 
due process of law. So it never—that 
question can never be ripe until those 
things have happened. 
If you agree with those arguments— 
and I know you will all get your Con-
stitutions out and you will read it, and 
if you agree with those arguments, the 
suggestion that the 14th Amendment 
applies here is ridiculous. And if you 
come to that conclusion, then, because 
the managers have not separated out 
the counts, any counts within the Arti-
cle of Impeachment, the whole thing 
falls. 
I didn’t write that. They are married 
to that. I wrote it out in individual re-
sponses because I didn’t know how to 
respond to the cast-the-wide-net effort. 
And fortunately Senators sometime in 
the past realized that you can’t do that 
because you passed a rule that says: 
Hey, you can’t do that. So that is why 
it is flawed. It is flawed in other ways, 
too, and my colleague will explain 
that. 
I was struck—I thought the House 
managers who spoke earlier were bril-
liant speakers, and I made some notes. 
They will hear about what I think 
about some of the things they said 
later when I am closing the case, but I 
thought they were brilliant speakers, 
and I loved listening to them. They are 
smart fellows. But why are the House 
managers afraid and why is the major-
ity—the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
afraid of the American people? 
I mean, let’s understand why we are 
really here. We are really here because 
the majority in the House of Rep-
resentatives does not want to face Don-
ald Trump as a political rival in the fu-
ture. That is the real reason we are 
here. That is why they have to get over 
the jurisdictional hurdle, which they 
can’t get over, but that is why they 
have to get over that in order to get to 
the part of the Constitution that al-
lows removal. So that is the—nobody 
says it that plainly, but unfortunately 
I have a way of speaking that way. 
And the reason that I am having 
trouble with the argument is, the 
American people just spoke, and they 
just changed administrations. So in the 
light most favorable to my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle here, 
their system works. The people are 
smart enough—in the light most favor-
able to them, they are smart enough to 
pick a new administration if they don’t 
like the old one, and they just did, and 
he is down there at Pennsylvania Ave-
nue now, probably wondering, how 
come none of my stuff is happening up 
at the Capitol? 
Why do the Members of the House of 
Representatives—the majority of the 
House 
of 
Representatives—why 
are 
they afraid of the very people who sent 
them to do this job, the people they 
hope will continue to send them back 
here? Why are they afraid that those 
same people who were smart enough to 
pick them as their Congressmen aren’t 
smart enough to pick somebody who is 
a candidate for President of the United 
States? Why fear that the people will 
all of a sudden forget how to choose an 
administration in the next few years? 
In fact, this happens all the time 
when there are changes in administra-
tions from one-term Presidents to oth-
ers. Well, Nixon was sort of 11⁄2 term, 
but Nixon to Ford, Ford to Carter, Car-
ter to Reagan, Bush 41 to Clinton. It 
happens. The people get tired of an ad-
ministration they don’t want, and they 
know how to change it. And they just 
did. 
So why think that they won’t know 
how to do it in 2024 if they want to, or 
is that what the fear is? Is the fear that 
the people in 2024, in fact, will want to 
change and will want to go back to 
Donald Trump and not the current oc-
cupant of the White House, President 
Biden? Because all of these other 
times, the people were smart enough to 
do it, choose who the President should 
be, and all these other times, they were 
smart enough to choose who their 
Members of Congress were—and, by the 
way, choose you all as well—but they 
are not smart enough to know how to 
change the administration, especially 
since they just did. So it seems pretty 
evident to me that they do know how. 
It has worked 100 percent of the time. 
One hundred percent of the time in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S601 
February 9, 2021 
United States, when the people had 
been fed up with and had enough of the 
occupant of the White House, they 
changed the occupant of the White 
House. 
Now, 
I 
know 
that 
one 
of 
the 
strengths of this body is its delibera-
tive action. 
I saw Senator MANCHIN on the TV the 
other night talking about the fili-
buster. And the main point was that 
Senator MANCHIN
was explaining to 
those of us who don’t operate here all 
the time, that this body has an obliga-
tion to try to reach consensus across 
the aisle to legitimize the decisions it 
makes. Obviously, he is capable of 
making his own pronouncements on it, 
but that is what came across on the 
television. And I think that that is a 
good way of saying why the Senate of 
the United States is different than 
other places. 
You know, the Constitution is a doc-
ument designed to protect the rights of 
the minority, not the rights of the ma-
jority. Congress shall make no law 
abridging all of these things. That is 
because those were the things that 
were of concern at the time. It is easy 
to be in favor of liberty and equality 
and free speech when it is popular. 
I think that I want to give my col-
league Mr. Schoen an opportunity to 
explain to all of us the legal analysis 
on jurisdiction. 
I will be quite frank with you. We 
changed what we were going to do on 
account that we thought that the 
House managers’ presentation was well 
done, and I wanted you to know that 
we have responses to those things. 
I thought that what the first part of 
the case was, which was the equivalent 
of a motion to dismiss, was going to be 
about jurisdiction alone, and one of the 
fellows who spoke for the House man-
agers—who was a formal criminal de-
fense attorney—seemed to suggest that 
there was something nefarious that we 
were discussing jurisdiction in trying 
to get the case dismissed, but this is 
where it happens in the case because 
jurisdiction is the first thing that has 
to be found. 
We have counterarguments to every-
thing that they raised, and you will 
hear them later on in the case from Mr. 
van der Veen and from myself. 
But on the issue of jurisdiction—the 
scholarly issue of jurisdiction—I will 
leave you with this before I invite 
David to come up and give you the eru-
dite explanation. Some of this was 
shown on the screen, but article I, sec-
tion 3 says: 
Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall 
not extend further than to removal from Of-
fice, and disqualification to hold . . . any Of-
fice of honor, Trust or Profit under the 
United States: but the Party convicted shall 
nevertheless be liable and subject to Indict-
ment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, ac-
cording to law. 
So this idea of a January amnesty is 
nonsense. If my colleagues on this side 
of the Chamber actually think that 
President Trump committed a criminal 
offense—and let’s understand a high 
crime is a felony and a misdemeanor is 
a misdemeanor. The words haven’t 
changed that much over time. After he 
is out of office, you go and arrest him. 
So there is no opportunity where the 
President of the United States can run 
rampant into January, the end of his 
term, and just go away scot-free. The 
Department of Justice does know what 
to do with such people. And so far, I 
haven’t seen any activity in that direc-
tion. 
And not only that, the people who 
stormed this building and breached it 
were not accused of conspiring with the 
President. But the section I read— 
‘‘Judgment’’—in other words, the bad 
thing that can happen—the ‘‘Judgment 
in Cases of Impeachment’’—i.e., what 
we are doing—‘‘shall not extend further 
than . . . removal from Office.’’ 
What is so hard about that? Which of 
those words are unclear? 
Shall not extend further than removal . . . 
from Office. 
President Trump no longer is in of-
fice. The object of the Constitution has 
been achieved. He was removed by the 
voters. 
Mr. Schoen, are you ready—now that 
I have taken all of his time. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
Schoen. 
Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. Mr. President, 
leaders. 
I stand before you in what I always 
thought as the hallowed ground of de-
mocracy. In this room, American lives 
have been changed so dramatically in 
just my lifetime through so many of 
your legislative initiatives from the 
Civil Rights Act, when I was a child, 
through, most recently, the FIRST 
STEP Act—laws that have provided 
major opportunities for Americans to 
move forward and upward and more 
fully enjoy all of the attributes of what 
has been the greatest Nation on Earth. 
I have seen the changes these laws 
have made to my clients every day for 
the past 36 years. These laws have en-
abled me to fight for their enjoyment 
of a fair stake in our American project. 
I stand before a group of 100 United 
States Senators who have chosen to 
serve your country from all corners of 
this great Nation, giving up all sorts of 
professions, time with family, and per-
haps other more lucrative opportuni-
ties to serve your country. 
Mr. President, you are a man who so 
honorably served this Nation in the 
Senate and in public service before 
your tenure here. It is an honor to ap-
pear in this historic hall of democracy. 
Yet today, that honor is tempered by 
an overriding feeling of grave concern, 
grave concern for the danger to the in-
stitution of the Presidency that I be-
lieve even convening these proceedings 
indicates. The joy I believed I would 
feel if I ever had the great privilege of 
appearing before this body is replaced 
by sadness and pain. My overriding 
emotion is, frankly, wanting to cry for 
what I believe these proceedings will 
do to our great, so long-enduring, sa-
cred Constitution and to the American 
people on both sides of the great divide 
that now characterizes our Nation. 
Esteemed Members of the Senate, 
going forward with this impeachment 
trial of a former President of the 
United States is unconstitutional for 
reasons we have set out in our brief, 
some of which we will focus on here. 
And as a matter of policy, it is wrong 
as wrong can be for all of us as a na-
tion. 
We are told by those who favor hav-
ing these proceedings that we have to 
do it for accountability. But anyone 
truly interested in real accountability 
for what happened at the Capitol on 
January 6 would, of course, insist on 
waiting for a full investigation to be 
completed. Indeed, one is underway in 
earnest already, intent on getting to 
the bottom of what happened. 
Anyone interested in ensuring that it 
is truly the one or ones responsible 
from whom accountability is sought 
would more than willingly wait for the 
actual evidence, especially with new 
evidence coming in every day about 
preplanning, about those who were in-
volved, and about their agenda bearing 
no relationship to the claims made 
here. 
They say you need this trial before 
the Nation can heal, that the Nation 
cannot heal without it. I say our Na-
tion cannot possibly heal with it. With 
this trial, you will open up new and 
bigger wounds across the Nation, for a 
great many Americans see this process 
for exactly what it is: a chance by a 
group of partisan politicians seeking to 
eliminate Donald Trump from the 
American political scene and seeking 
to disenfranchise 74 million-plus Amer-
ican voters and those who dare to share 
their political beliefs and vision of 
America. They hated the results of the 
2016 election and want to use this im-
peachment process to further their po-
litical agenda. 
These elitists have mocked them for 
4 years. They called their fellow Ameri-
cans who believe in their country and 
their Constitution ‘‘deplorables.’’ And 
the latest talk is that they need to 
deprogram those who supported Donald 
Trump and the Grand Old Party. But at 
the end of the day, this is not just 
about Donald Trump or any individual. 
This is about our Constitution and 
abusing the impeachment power for po-
litical gain. 
They tell us that we have to have 
this impeachment trial, such as it is, 
to bring about unity, but they don’t 
want unity. And they know this so- 
called trial will tear the country in 
half, leaving tens of millions of Ameri-
cans feeling left out of the Nation’s 
agenda, as dictated by one political 
party that now holds the power in the 
White House and in our national legis-
lature. 
But they are proud Americans who 
never quit getting back up when they 
are down, and they don’t take dictates 
from another party based on partisan

force-feeding. This trial will tear this 
country apart, perhaps like we have 
only seen once before in our history. 
And to help the Nation heal, we now 
learn that the House managers, in 
their wisdom, have hired a movie com-
pany and a large law firm to create, 
manufacture, and splice for you a pack-
age designed by experts to chill and 
horrify you and our fellow Americans. 
They want to put you through a 16- 
hour presentation over 2 days, focusing 
on this as if it were some sort of blood 
sport. And to what end? For healing? 
For unity? For accountability? Not for 
any of those. For, surely, there are 
much better ways to achieve each. It 
is, again, for pure, raw, misguided par-
tisanship that makes them believe 
playing to our worst instincts somehow 
is good. 
They don’t need to show you movies 
to show you that the riot happened 
here. We will stipulate that it hap-
pened, and you know all about it. 
This is a process fueled irresponsibly 
by base hatred by these House man-
agers and those who gave them their 
charge, and they are willing to sac-
rifice our national character to ad-
vance their hatred and their fear that 
one day they might not be the party in 
power. They have a very different view 
of democracy and freedom. 
From Justice Jackson who once 
wrote: 
[But][F]reedom to differ is not limited to 
things that do not matter much. That would 
be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its 
substance is the right to differ as to things 
that touch at the heart of the existing order. 
They have a very different view of de-
mocracy and freedom. This is nothing 
less than the political weaponization of 
the impeachment process—pure, raw 
sport, fueled by the misguided idea of 
party over country when, in fact, both 
will surely suffer. 
I can promise you that if these pro-
ceedings go forward, everyone will look 
bad. You will see and hear many Mem-
bers of our Congress saying and doing 
things they must surely regret. But, 
perhaps, far worse than a moment of 
personal shame in a world in which his-
tory passes from our memories in a 
moment, our great country, a model 
for all the world, will be far more di-
vided and our standing around the 
world will be badly broken. Our arch 
enemies who pray each and every day 
for our downfall will watch with glee, 
glowing in the moment as they see you 
at your worst and our country in inter-
nal divide. 
Let’s be perfectly clear. If you vote 
to proceed with this impeachment 
trial, future Senators will recognize 
that you bought into a radical, con-
stitutional theory that departs clearly 
from the language of the Constitution 
itself and holds—and this is in their 
brief—that any civil officer who ever 
dares to want to serve his or her coun-
try must know that they will be sub-
ject to impeachment long after their 
service in office has ended, subject only 
to the political and cultural landscape 
of the day that is in operation at any 
future time. This is exactly the posi-
tion taken by the House managers at 
page 65 of their brief—unprecedented, 
radical position. They unabashedly say 
so. 
Imagine the potential consequences 
for civil officers you know and who you 
believed served so honorably but who, 
in the view of a future Congress, might 
one day be deemed to be impeachment 
worthy. Imagine it now because your 
imagination is the only limitation. 
The House managers tell you a cor-
rect reading of the impeachment power 
under the Constitution is that it has no 
temporal limit and can reach back in 
time without limitation to target any-
one who dared to serve our Nation as a 
civil officer. Now add that to their de-
mand that you Members put your im-
primatur on the snap impeachment 
they returned in this case and can do 
again in the future if you endorse it by 
going forward with this impeachment 
trial. This is an untenable combination 
that literally puts the institution of 
the Presidency directly at risk, noth-
ing less, and it does much more. 
Under their unsupportable constitu-
tional theory and tortured reading of 
the text, every civil officer who has 
served is at risk of impeachment if any 
given group elected to the House de-
cides that what was thought to be an 
important service to the country when 
they served now deserves to be can-
celed. 
They have made clear in public state-
ments that what they really want to 
accomplish here, in the name of the 
Constitution, is to bar Donald Trump 
from ever running for political office 
again, but this is an affront to the Con-
stitution no matter who they target 
today. It means nothing less than the 
denial of the right to vote and the inde-
pendent right for a candidate to run for 
elective political office, guaranteed by 
the 1st and 14th Amendments to the 
Constitution, using the guise of im-
peachment as a tool to disenfranchise. 
Perhaps my friend put the situation 
simply and sharply into focus last 
week on his radio show. My friend is a 
distinguished lawyer who served as an 
Ambassador 
to 
former 
President 
Obama and has friends among you. He 
described himself to his listeners as a 
dyed-in-the-wool, lifelong Democrat, 
but he said the idea of 100 people in 
these circumstances deciding that tens 
of millions of American voters cannot 
cast their vote for their candidate for 
President ever again is unthinkable, 
and it truly should be. 
I will discuss today several reasons 
this matter should not and must not 
proceed; why the Senate lacks jurisdic-
tion to conduct this trial of a former 
President—a President no longer in of-
fice and now a private citizen. Any sin-
gle reason in our trial memorandum or 
discussed today suffices, but I want to 
start with a discussion of the funda-
mental due process lacking from the 
start, and that would last through the 
end if this goes forward because it is 
this irretrievably flawed process and 
its product—a dangerous snap impeach-
ment—that brings us here and that 
threatens to send a message into the 
future that we will all regret forever 
and that will stain this body, which up 
to now our Founding Fathers believed 
was uniquely suited for the most dif-
ficult task of conducting an impeach-
ment trial, as Mr. Hamilton wrote in 
Federalist No. 65. 
These aren’t just niceties. I make no 
apology for demanding in your name, 
in the name of the Constitution, that 
the rights to due process guaranteed 
under the Constitution are adhered to 
in a process as serious as this in our 
national lives. 
The denial of due process in this case, 
of course, starts with the House of Rep-
resentatives. In this unprecedented 
snap impeachment process, the House 
of Representatives denied every at-
tribute of fundamental constitutional 
due process that Americans correctly 
have come to believe is part of what 
makes this country so great. How and 
why did that happen? It is a function of 
the insatiable lust for impeachment in 
the House for the past 4 years. 
Consider this: 
(Video footage.) 
Mr. RASKIN: I want to say this for Donald 
Trump who I may well be voting to impeach. 
Mr. Ellison: Donald Trump has already 
done a number of things which legitimately 
raise the question of impeachment. 
Ms. WATERS: I don’t respect this President, 
and I will fight every day until he is im-
peached! 
Mr. CASTRO: That is grounds to start im-
peachment proceedings. Those are grounds 
to start impeachment. Those are grounds to 
start impeachment proceedings. Yes, I think 
that’s grounds to start impeachment pro-
ceedings. 
Mr. GREEN: I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to 
call for the impeachment of the President of 
the United States of America. 
Ms. WATERS: I continue to say, Impeach 
him! Impeach 45! Impeach 45! 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah.’’) 
Mr. COHEN: So we are calling upon the 
House to begin impeachment hearings imme-
diately. 
Mr. Commentator: On the impeachment of 
Donald Trump, would you vote yes or no? 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ: I would vote yes. 
Ms. OMAR: I would vote to impeach. 
Ms. TLAIB: Because we’re going to go in 
there, and we’re going to impeach the [bleep 
bleep]! 
Mr. SHERMAN: The fact is I introduced Ar-
ticles of Impeachment in July of 2017. 
Mr. GREEN: If we don’t impeach this Presi-
dent, he will get reelected. 
Mr. COHEN: My oath requires me to be for 
impeachment, have impeachment hearings, 
and leave a scarlet ‘‘I’’ on his chest. 
Mr. BOOKER: The Representatives should 
begin impeachment proceedings against this 
President. 
Ms. WARREN: It is time to bring impeach-
ment charges against him. Bring impeach-
ment charges. 
Mr. NADLER: My personal view is that he 
richly deserves impeachment. 
Ms. TLAIB: We are here at an impeachment 
rally, and we are ready to impeach the— 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah.’’) 
I can’t say it. 
The relevant timeline in the House 
reveals the rush to judgment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S603 
February 9, 2021 
On the day following the January 6 
riot, the House leadership cynically 
sensed a political opportunity to score 
points against the outgoing then-Presi-
dent Trump, and the Speaker de-
manded that Vice President Pence in-
voke the 25th Amendment, threatening 
immediate impeachment for the Presi-
dent if Mr. Pence did not comply with 
this extraordinary and extraordinarily 
wrong demand. 
Four days later, on January 11, 2021, 
the instant Article of Impeachment 
was introduced in the House. Speaker 
PELOSI then gave the Vice President 
another 
ultimatum, 
threatening 
to 
begin impeachment proceedings within 
24 hours if he did not comply. Vice 
President 
Pence 
rejected 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s demand, favoring instead ad-
herence to the Constitution and the 
best interests of the Nation over a po-
litically motivated threat. 
On January 12, Speaker PELOSI an-
nounced who the nine impeachment 
managers would be, and on January 13, 
2021, just days after holding a press 
conference to announce the launching 
of an inquiry, the House adopted the 
Article of Impeachment, completing 
the fastest impeachment inquiry in 
history 
and, 
according 
President 
Trump, no due process at all over 
strong opposition, based in large part 
on the complete lack of due process. 
To say there was a rush to judgment 
by the House would be a grave under-
statement. It is not as if the House 
Members who voted to impeach were 
not mightily warned about the dangers 
to the institution of the Presidency 
and to our system of due process. They 
were warned in the strongest of terms 
from within their own ranks ada-
mantly, clearly, and in no uncertain 
terms not to take this dangerous snap 
impeachment course. Those warnings 
were framed in the context of the con-
stitutional due process that was denied 
here. 
Consider the warnings given by one 
Member during the House proceedings, 
pleading with the other Members to ac-
cord this decision the due process the 
Constitution demands. 
This is Representative COLE of Okla-
homa: 
With only 1 week to go in his term, the 
majority is asking us to consider a resolu-
tion impeaching President Trump, and they 
do so knowing full well that even if the 
House passes this resolution, the Senate will 
not be able to begin considering these 
charges until after President Trump’s term 
ends. 
I can think of no action the House can take 
that is more likely to further divide the 
American people than the action we are con-
templating today. Emotions are clearly run-
ning high and political divisions have never 
been more apparent in my lifetime. 
Said by Representative COLE. 
Mr. COLE’s words on the floor empha-
sizing the care that must be taken with 
respect to the consideration of the Ar-
ticle of Impeachment echo the con-
cerns by our Founding Fathers on this 
subject. 
Listen to this from Mr. Hamilton in 
Federalist No. 65: 
A well constituted court for the trial of 
impeachments, is an object not more to be 
desired than difficult to be obtained in a gov-
ernment wholly elective. . . . The prosecu-
tion of them, for this reason, will seldom fail 
to agitate the passions of the whole commu-
nity, and to divide it into parties, more or 
less friendly or inimical, to the accused. In 
many cases, it will connect itself with the 
pre-existing factions, and will inlist all their 
animosities, partialities, influence and inter-
est on one side, or on the other; and in such 
cases there will always be the greatest dan-
ger, that the decision will be regulated more 
by the comparative strength of parties than 
by the real demonstrations of innocence or 
guilt. 
Prescient thinking by Mr. Hamilton, 
as we see often. 
In what I say to you is a proof of the 
need for due process, based on the criti-
cally serious nature of the singular 
role the impeachment process has in 
our government, Mr. Hamilton charac-
terized the consideration of an im-
peachment in these terms: 
The delicacy and magnitude of a trust, 
which so deeply concerns the political rep-
utation and existence of every man engaged 
in the administration of public affairs, speak 
for themselves. 
This, too, is in Federalist No. 65. 
Now back to the House and the warn-
ings against this rushed judgment in 
this case. 
Mr. COLE of Oklahoma again. In the 
name of healing, a path forward he said 
our people so desperately need, he 
warned that ‘‘the House is moving for-
ward erratically with a truncated proc-
ess that does not comport with the 
modern practice and that will give 
members no time to contemplate the 
serious nature of action before us.’’ 
Mr. COLE
emphasized to his col-
leagues that such care must be taken 
with the consideration of an Article of 
Impeachment ‘‘in order to ensure that 
the American people have confidence 
in the procedures the House is fol-
lowing and because the Presidency 
itself demands due process in the im-
peachment proceedings.’’ 
Congressman COLE continued: 
Unfortunately, the majority has chosen to 
race to the floor with a new Article of Im-
peachment, forgoing any investigation, any 
committee process or any chance for Mem-
bers to fully contemplate this course of ac-
tion before proceeding. 
Mr. COLE complained that ‘‘the ma-
jority is failing to provide the House 
with an opportunity to review all the 
facts—which are still coming to light— 
to discuss all the evidence, to listen to 
scholars, to examine the witnesses, and 
to consider precedence.’’ 
He noted further: 
This is not the type of robust process we 
have followed for every modern impeach-
ment, and the failure to do so does a great 
disservice to this institution and to this 
country. 
Mr. COLE complained right on the 
House floor that ‘‘rather than fol-
lowing the appropriate processes the 
House has used in every modern im-
peachment, the majority is rushing to 
the floor, tripping all over themselves 
in their rush to impeach the President 
a second time.’’ And in Mr. COLE’s 
words, it was doing so to ‘‘settle 
scores.’’ He warned this snap impeach-
ment approach would cause great divi-
sion as the country looks ahead to the 
start of a new administration. 
He said to them: 
In a matter as grave and consequential as 
impeachment, shouldn’t we follow the same 
process we have used in every modern im-
peachment rather than rushing to the floor? 
And he implored them: 
On behalf of generations of Americans to 
come, we need to think more clearly about 
the consequences of our action today. 
Mr. COLE
then reached across the 
aisle and credited a Member of this 
body, Senator MANCHIN, having voiced 
similar sentiments about how ill-ad-
vised this rushed process was, sug-
gesting that the underlying events 
were a matter for the judicial system 
to investigate, not one for a rushed po-
litical process. 
Finally, Mr. COLE admonished his fel-
low House Members, telling them: 
We need to recognize that we are following 
a flawed process. 
The alarm Mr. COLE sounded went 
unheeded. 
Now let us consider the process in 
the House that actually was due. The 
House managers assert in their memo-
randum that ‘‘[t]he House serves as a 
grand jury and prosecutor under the 
Constitution.’’ They told you that 
again today. If this is accurate, then 
they highlight the complete failure to 
adhere to due process. 
One should not diminish the significance of 
impeachment’s legal aspects, particularly as 
they relate to the formalities of the criminal 
justice process. It is a hybrid of the political 
and the legal, a political process moderated 
by legal formalities. 
This is a quote, Richard Broughton. 
The Fifth Amendment to the United 
States Constitution provides, in rel-
evant part, that ‘‘no person shall be 
. . . deprived of life, liberty or prop-
erty, without due process of law.’’ The 
Supreme Court long ago recognized in 
Matthews v. Eldridge that, at its core, 
due process is about what we all want, 
what we all have the right to demand— 
fundamental 
fairness. 
One 
scholar, 
Brian Owsley, has written that ‘‘the 
impeachment process should and does 
include some of the basic safeguards 
for the accused that are observed in a 
criminal process such as fairness, due 
process, presumption of innocence, and 
proportionality’’—basic American val-
ues. And, of course, we know that the 
Supreme Court has recognized that due 
process protections attend congres-
sional investigations. While Congress is 
empowered to make its own rules of 
proceeding, it may not make rules that 
ignore constitutional restraints or vio-
late fundamental rights. 
While the case law is limited in 
terms of spelling out what due process 
looks like in impeachment hearings 
and, of course, in the Nixon case—Wal-
ter, not Richard—we know that there 
is a great deal of leeway afforded Con-
gress with respect to its impeachment

S604 
February 9, 2021 
rules. It is clear that the fundamental 
principles that underlie our under-
standing of what due process must al-
ways look like apply. 
In Hastings v. United States, a DC 
court 
case 
vacated 
on 
different 
grounds, they address the matter, 
clearly concluding that the due process 
clause applies to impeachment pro-
ceedings and that it imposes an inde-
pendent constitutional constraint on 
how the Senate exercises its sole power 
to try all impeachments under article 
I, section 3, clause 6. 
The court wrote in Hastings: 
Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy. 
As an essential element of our constitutional 
system of checks and balances, impeachment 
must be invoked and carried out with solemn 
respect and scrupulous attention to fairness. 
Fairness and due process must be the watch-
word whenever a branch of the United States 
Government conducts a trial, whether it be 
in a criminal case, a civil case or a case of 
impeachment. 
A 1974 Department of Justice memo 
suggested the same view, opining that 
‘‘whether or not capable of judicial en-
forcement, due process standards would 
seem to be relevant to the manner of 
conducting 
an 
impeachment 
pro-
ceeding.’’ 
More specifically, as the Hastings 
court described it, ‘‘one of the key 
principles that lies at the heart of our 
constitutional democracy: fairness.’’ 
Again, fairness. 
The Supreme Court’s ‘‘precedents es-
tablish the general rule that individ-
uals must receive notice and an oppor-
tunity to be heard before the govern-
ment deprives them’’ of a constitu-
tionally protected interest. It is also 
true that ‘‘in any proceeding that may 
lead to deprivation of a protected in-
terest, it requires fair procedures com-
mensurate 
with 
the 
interests 
at 
stake.’’ 
Impeachment proceedings plainly in-
volve deprivations of property and lib-
erty interests protected by the due 
process clause, and the House surely 
seeks to strip Donald Trump of his 
most highly cherished constitutional 
rights, including the right to be eligi-
ble to hold public office again, should 
he so choose. 
Due process must apply, and, at a 
minimum, due process in the impeach-
ment process must include that the 
evidence must be disclosed to the ac-
cused, and the accused must be per-
mitted an opportunity to test and con-
front 
the 
evidence, 
particularly 
through ‘‘the rights to confront and 
cross-examine witnesses,’’ which ‘‘have 
long been recognized as essential to 
due process.’’ In almost every setting 
where important decisions turn on 
questions of fact, due process requires 
an opportunity to confront and cross- 
examine. 
It is unfathomable that the Framers, 
steeped in the history of Anglo-Amer-
ican jurisprudence, would create a sys-
tem that would allow the Chief Execu-
tive and Commander in Chief of the 
Armed Forces to be impeached based 
on a process that developed evidence 
without providing any of the elemen-
tary procedures that the common law 
developed over centuries for ensuring 
the proper testing of evidence in an ad-
versarial process. We would never 
countenance such a system in this 
country. 
Current Members of the House and 
Senate leadership are themselves on 
record 
repeatedly 
confirming 
these 
procedural due process requirements. 
Indeed, Congressman NADLER
is on 
record asserting that, in the context of 
the House impeachment investigation, 
due process includes the ‘‘right to be 
informed of the law, of the charges 
against you, to call your own wit-
nesses, and to have the assistance of 
counsel.’’ 
Then-President Trump was not given 
any semblance of the due process Con-
gressman NADLER clearly believes he 
deserves, based on the Congressman’s 
description of due process, that must 
be afforded to an accused in an im-
peachment proceeding, as reflected in 
the statement he made relating to an-
other impeachment in 1998. No reason 
was found for the apparent change in 
the Congressman’s point of view with 
respect to the two objects of the im-
peachments at issue. 
These fundamental aspects of due 
process have been honored as required 
parts of modern impeachment protocol 
since at least 1870. It is not seriously 
debatable, nor should it be—nor should 
it be—by any American legislator. 
In spite of all this, the House leader-
ship defied all the norms and denied 
the then-President all of his basic and 
constitutionally protected rights. With 
then-President 
Donald 
Trump, 
the 
House impeachment procedure lacked 
any semblance of due process whatever. 
It simply cannot be credibly argued to 
the country, and we do not make spe-
cial rules for different targets. It is the 
very integrity of the institution that 
suffers when we do, and that is what 
the House leadership knowingly has 
caused. 
A review of the House record revealed 
that the Speaker streamlined the im-
peachment process—H. Res. 24—to go 
straight to the floor for a 2-hour debate 
and a vote, without the ability for 
amendments. The House record reflects 
no committee hearing, no witnesses, no 
presentation or cross-examination of 
evidence, and no opportunity for the 
accused to respond or even have coun-
sel present to object. 
As the New York Times recently re-
ported, ‘‘there were no witness inter-
views, no hearings, no committee de-
bates and no real additional fact find-
ing.’’ 
House managers claim the need for 
impeachment was so urgent that they 
had to rush the proceedings, with no 
time to spare for a more thorough in-
vestigation or, really, any investiga-
tion at all. 
But that claim is belied by what hap-
pened or didn’t happen next. The House 
leadership unilaterally and by choice 
waited another 12 days to deliver the 
Article to this Senate to begin the trial 
process. In other words, the House 
leadership spent more time holding the 
adopted Article than it did on the 
whole process leading up to the adop-
tion of the Article. 
That intentional delay, designed to 
avoid having the trial begin while Mr. 
Trump was still President, led to yet 
another egregious denial of due proc-
ess. Article I, section 3, clause 6 of our 
Constitution, of course, provides, in 
pertinent part, that: 
The Senate shall have the sole Power to 
try all impeachments. When sitting for that 
Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirma-
tion. When the President of the United 
States is tried, the Chief Justice shall pre-
side. 
By intentionally waiting until Presi-
dent Trump’s term of office expired be-
fore delivering the Article of Impeach-
ment to the Senate to initiate trial 
proceedings, Speaker PELOSI deprived 
then-President Trump of the express 
constitutional 
right—and 
the 
right 
under the Senate’s own rule IV—to 
have the Chief Justice of the United 
States preside over his trial and wield 
the considerable power provided for in 
the Rules of Procedure and Practice in 
the Senate when sitting on impeach-
ment trials. 
That power includes, under rule V, 
the Presiding Officer’s exclusive right 
to make and issue all orders; under 
rule VII, to make all evidentiary orders 
subject to objection by a Member of 
the Senate. 
We say, respectfully, that this inten-
tional delay by Speaker PELOSI, such 
that in the intervening period, Presi-
dent Trump became private citizen Mr. 
Trump, constitutes a lapse or waiver of 
jurisdiction here, for Mr. Trump no 
longer is ‘‘the President’’ described as 
subject to impeachment in article I, 
section 3, clause 6 and in article II, sec-
tion 4, and this body, therefore, has no 
jurisdiction as a function of that addi-
tional due process violation by Speaker 
PELOSI. 
Moreover, with all due respect, then- 
President Trump suffered a tangible 
detriment from Speaker PELOSI’s ac-
tions, which violates not only his 
rights to due process of law, but also 
his express constitutional right to have 
the Chief Justice preside. 
That tangible detriment includes the 
loss of the right to a conflict-free, im-
partial Presiding Officer—with all due 
respect—the very purpose behind re-
quiring the Chief Justice to preside 
over 
the 
President’s 
impeachment 
trial, along with the other benefits of 
having the two branches combined— 
the Chief Justice from the Judiciary 
and the Senate—for the impeachment 
trial of the President, reflected in Fed-
eralist 66, one of the reasons the Chief 
Justice was chosen for that task. 
Mr. Trump now faces a situation in 
which the Presiding Officer will serve 
as both judge, with all the powers that 
the rules endow him with, and juror 
with a vote. And beyond that, the Pre-
siding Officer, although enjoying a life-
long, honorable reputation, of course,

has been Mr. Trump’s vocal and ada-
mant opponent throughout the Trump 
administration. And, in fact, in the 
very matter on trial, the Presiding Of-
ficer, respectfully, already has publicly 
announced his fixed view before hear-
ing any argument or evidence that Mr. 
Trump must be convicted on the Arti-
cle of Impeachment before the Senate 
and, indeed, that Members in both par-
ties have an obligation to vote to con-
vict, as well. 
Nowhere in this great country would 
any American—and, certainly, not this 
honorable Presiding Officer—consider 
this scenario to be consistent with any 
stretch of the American concept of due 
process and a fair trial and certainly 
not even the appearance of either. 
By no stretch of the imagination 
could any fairminded American be con-
fident that a trial so conducted would 
or could be the fair trial promised by 
the leader. 
While most procedural aspects of a 
Senate impeachment trial may be non-
justiciable political questions, this is 
not an excuse to ignore what law and 
precedent clearly require. The present 
situation either presents a violation of 
the constitutional text found in the ar-
ticles mentioned above that require the 
Chief Justice to preside when the 
President is on trial or it is a clear de-
nial of due process and fair trial rights 
for Private Citizen Trump to face an 
impeachment trial so conducted by the 
Senate. 
The impeachment Article should be 
treated as a nullity and dismissed 
based on the total lack of due process 
in the House. It should be dismissed be-
cause of Speaker PELOSI’s intentional 
abandonment or waiver of jurisdiction, 
if the House ever acquired jurisdiction, 
and the Article should be dismissed be-
cause the trial in the Senate of a pri-
vate citizen is not permitted, let alone 
with the conflicts just described that 
attend this proceeding. 
Finally, on the subject of due process 
in this matter, I say the following: 
This is our Nation’s sacred Constitu-
tion. It has served us well since it was 
written, and it has been amended only 
through a careful process. It is a docu-
ment unique in all the world. It is a 
foundational part of what makes the 
United States a beacon of light among 
the other nations of the world. It not 
only has room for a tremendous vari-
ety of perspectives on the philosophical 
and political direction our country 
should take, it encourages the advo-
cacy of our differences. 
But we have long held that funda-
mental to its health and well-being 
and, therefore, to ours as a nation, is 
its insistence on due process for every 
citizen. The emphasis on the right to 
due process long ago was recognized as 
its life breath, a primary guarantor of 
its eternal viability as our political, 
civic, and national guiding light. 
We all well know that there are 
many 
systems 
in 
other 
countries 
around the world that do not offer any 
semblance of the safeguards our con-
stitutional concept of due process pro-
vides. Some of them have chosen their 
own handbooks, which direct their citi-
zens’ conduct on penalty of death. This 
is one of them. 
There can be no room for due process 
in such a system as this or the system 
would be lost. Snap decisions are re-
quired in a system like this to main-
tain power for one political philosophy 
over all others in those kinds of sys-
tems. 
But we as a nation have rejected 
those systems and the kind of snap de-
cisions they demand to maintain con-
trol for one party, for one point of 
view, and for an imposed way of life. 
We choose to live freely under a con-
stitution that guarantees our freedom. 
Other countries fear those freedoms 
and seek to ensure adherence to a 
party line in all civic, political, spir-
itual, and other affairs and to ensure 
that the party line is toed. And those 
systems have no place for due process. 
Snap decisions that remove political 
figures are the norm. Maintaining their 
systems depend on it. That is not our 
way in America and never must be. 
We choose in America to live by our 
Constitution and its amendments and 
the due process this document demands 
for every citizen among us. By putting 
your imprimatur on the snap judgment 
made in this matter, to impeach the 
President of the United States without 
any semblance of due process at every 
step along the way, puts the Office of 
the President of the United States at 
risk every single day. It is far too dan-
gerous a proposition to countenance, 
and you must resoundingly reject it by 
sending the message now that this pro-
ceeding, lacking due process from start 
to finish, must end now with your vote 
that you lack jurisdiction to conduct 
an impeachment trial for a former 
President, whose term in office has ex-
pired and who is now a private citizen. 
So one reason you must send this 
message here and now is because of the 
complete lack of due process that 
brought this Article of Impeachment 
before this body. God forbid we should 
ever lower our vigilance to the prin-
ciple of due process. 
An impeachment trial of Private Cit-
izen Trump held before the Senate 
would be nothing more nor less than 
the trial of a private citizen by a legis-
lative body. An impeachment trial by 
the Senate of a private citizen violates 
article I, section 9 of the United States 
Constitution, which provides that ‘‘[n]o 
bill of attainder . . . shall be passed.’’ 
The bill of attainder, as this clause is 
known, prohibits Congress from enact-
ing ‘‘a law that legislatively deter-
mines guilt and inflicts punishment 
upon an identifiable individual without 
provision of the protections of a judi-
cial trial.’’ 
A bill of attainder is a legislative act 
which inflicts punishment without a judicial 
trial— 
A judicial trial— 
The distinguishing characteristic of a bill of 
attainder is the substitution of a legislative 
determination of guilt and legislative impo-
sition of punishment for judicial finding and 
sentence. 
[The Bill of Attainder Clause], and 
the separation of powers doctrine gen-
erally, reflect the Framers’ concern 
that trial by a legislature lacks the 
safeguards necessary to prevent the 
abuse of power. 
As the Supreme Court explained in 
United States v. Brown, ‘‘[t]he best 
available evidence, the writings of the 
architects of our constitutional sys-
tem, indicate that the Bill of Attainder 
Clause was intended not as a narrow, 
technical (and therefore soon to be out-
moded) prohibition, but rather as an 
implementation of the separation of 
powers, a general safeguard against 
legislative exercise of the judicial func-
tion, or more simply—trial by legisla-
ture.’’ The bill of attainder ‘‘reflected 
the Framers’ belief that the Legisla-
tive Branch is not so well suited as po-
litically independent judges and ju-
ries.’’ 
When the Senate undertakes an im-
peachment trial of a private citizen, as 
it clearly understands to be the case 
here, supported by the fact that the 
Chief Justice is not presiding and Mr. 
Trump is not ‘‘the President,’’ it is act-
ing as a judge and jury rather than a 
legislative body. And this is exactly 
the type of situation that the bill of at-
tainder constitutional prohibition was 
meant to preclude. 
It is clear that disqualification from 
holding future office, the punishment 
the House managers intend to seek 
here, is a kind of punishment, like ban-
ishment and others, that is subject to 
the constitutional prohibition against 
the passage of bills of attainder, under 
which designation bills of pains and 
penalties are included. The cases in-
clude Cummings, Ex parte Garland, 
and this Brown case. The Supreme 
Court three times has struck down pro-
visions that precluded support of the 
South or support of communism from 
holding certain jobs as being in viola-
tion of this prohibition. Thus the im-
peachment of a private citizen in order 
to disqualify them from holding office 
is an unconstitutional act constituting 
a bill of attainder. 
Moreover, this is the exact type of 
situation in which the fear would be 
great that some Members of the Senate 
might be susceptible to acting in the 
haste the House acted in when it 
rushed through the Article of Impeach-
ment in less than 48 hours, acting hast-
ily simply to appease the popular clam-
or of their political base—the very kind 
of concern expressed by Mr. Hamilton 
in Federalist 65. 
Moreover, as Chief Justice Marshall 
warned in Fletcher v. Peck, ‘‘it is not 
to be disguised that the framers of the 
constitution viewed, with some appre-
hension, the violent acts that might 
grow out of the feelings of the moment; 
and that the people of the United 
States, in adopting that instrument, 
have manifested a determination to 
shield themselves and their property

from the effects of those sudden and 
strong passions to which men and 
women are exposed. The restrictions on 
the legislative power of the states are 
obviously founded in this sentiment; 
and the constitution of the United 
States contains what may be deemed a 
bill of rights for the people of each 
state. No state shall pass any bill of at-
tainder. In this form the power of the 
legislature over the lives and fortunes 
of individuals is expressly restrained.’’ 
So now let’s turn to the text of the 
Constitution. 
Turning to the text of the Constitu-
tion is, for many, of course, the most 
appropriate and the most important 
starting place to trying to answer a 
Constitution-based question. There are 
several passages of the United States 
Constitution that relate to the Federal 
impeachment process. Let’s turn to a 
reading of the text now. 
A true textual analysis, as the name 
implies, always begins with the words 
of the text and only resorts to legisla-
tive history or history itself if the 
meaning of the text is not plain. As the 
Supreme 
Court 
has 
emphasized, 
‘‘[s]tatutory interpretation, as we al-
ways say, begins with the text.’’ ‘‘In in-
terpreting this text, we are guided by 
the principle that the Constitution was 
written to be understood by the voters; 
its words and phrases were used in 
their normal and ordinary as distin-
guished from technical meaning.’’ And 
‘‘[w]e must enforce plain and unambig-
uous statutory language according to 
its terms.’’ 
If a President is impeached, the un-
ambiguous text of the Constitution 
commands that the Chief Justice of the 
United States shall preside, as we dis-
cussed earlier. Again, the Chief Justice 
is disinterested and nonpartisan. His 
presence brings dignity and solemnity 
to such a proceeding. In this case, the 
Chief Justice clearly is not presiding, 
and the conflict of interest wouldn’t 
necessarily just arise as a substitute 
for the Vice President. It is the appear-
ance of a conflict of interest and the— 
and a conflict of interest and the pre-
judgment that we have discussed. In 
this case, as we say, the Chief Justice 
clearly is not presiding. The Senate 
President pro tempore is presiding. It 
appears that in the leader’s view, un-
doubtedly joined by other Senators, 
this is permitted by the Constitution 
because the subject of the trial is a 
non-President. As such, it is conceded, 
as it must be, that for constitutional 
purposes of the trial, the accused is a 
non-President. The role of the Senate, 
though, is to decide whether or not to 
convict and thereby trigger the appli-
cation of article II, section 4: 
The President, Vice President and all civil 
Officers of the United States, shall be re-
moved from Office on Impeachment for, and 
Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other 
high Crimes and Misdemeanors. 
From which office shall a non-Presi-
dent be removed if convicted? A non- 
President doesn’t hold an office, there-
fore cannot be impeached under this 
clause, which provides for the removal 
from office of the person under the im-
peachment attack. 
The House managers contend that 
the fact that the Chief Justice is not 
presiding does not impact the constitu-
tional validity of this trial. Notably, 
they devote only a single paragraph of 
their trial memorandum to a develop-
ment so significant that it prompted 
multiple Senators to declare the entire 
proceeding suspect, with one going so 
far as to say it ‘‘crystalized’’ the un-
constitutional 
nature 
of 
this 
pro-
ceeding. And the single paragraph that 
the House managers do devote to the 
issue is entirely unpersuasive on the 
merits. 
The House managers’ position ig-
nores traditional statutory canons of 
interpretation. It is well established 
that ‘‘[a] term appearing in several 
places in a statutory text is generally 
read the same way each time it ap-
pears.’’ This presumption is ‘‘at its 
most vigorous when a term is repeated 
within a given sentence.’’ Additionally, 
the Court in at least one instance has 
referred to a broader ‘‘established 
canon’’ that similar language con-
tained within the same section of a 
statute be accorded a consistent mean-
ing. 
I know this is a lot to listen to at 
once—a lot of words, but words are 
what make our Constitution, and the 
interpretation of that Constitution, as 
you well know, is a product of words. 
If the text, ‘‘the President of the 
United States’’ in the constitutional 
provision requiring the Chief Justice to 
preside can refer only to the sitting 
President, and not to former presi-
dents, then the textual identification 
of ‘‘[t]he President’’ contained in arti-
cle II, section 4, which makes the 
President amenable to impeachment in 
the first place, also excludes anyone 
other than the sitting President. In 
full, that sentence provides that ‘‘[t]he 
President, Vice President and all civil 
Officers of the United States, shall be 
removed from Office on Impeachment 
for, and Conviction of, Treason, Brib-
ery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors.’’ This is the substantive 
phrase of the Constitution vesting the 
conviction and removal power in the 
Senate, and it contains a clear jurisdic-
tional limitation. The House managers 
do understand what the word ‘‘Presi-
dent’’ means for the purposes of other 
constitutional provisions, and so they 
should understand this limitation as 
well. Only a sitting President is re-
ferred to as the President of the United 
States in the Constitution. And only a 
sitting President may be impeached, 
convicted, and removed upon a trial in 
the Senate. ‘‘The President’’ in article 
II, section 4 and ‘‘the President’’ in ar-
ticle I, section 3 identify the same per-
son. If the accused is not ‘‘the Presi-
dent’’ in one, he is not ‘‘the President’’ 
in the other. No sound textual inter-
pretation—I emphasize ‘‘textual inter-
pretation’’—principle permits a con-
trary reading. In the words of the Su-
preme Court, it is a ‘‘normal rule of 
statutory construction that identical 
words used in different parts of the 
same act are intended to have the same 
meaning.’’ Unwittingly or unwillingly 
as it may be, Senate Democrats, in 
their 
announcement 
that 
Senator 
LEAHY will preside, have already taken 
their position on this matter. The ac-
cused is not the President. The text of 
the United States Constitution there-
fore does not vest the Senate with the 
power to try him and remove him—a 
factual nullity; he can’t be removed— 
or disqualify him—a legal nullity—as if 
he was the President. 
The House managers contend that 
the Senate has jurisdiction over this 
impeachment because despite the fact 
that he is no longer the President, the 
conduct that the former President is 
charged occurred while he was still in 
office. That argument does not in any 
way alter the Constitution’s clear tex-
tual identification of ‘‘the President.’’ 
The House managers justify their 
strained argument by noting that 
‘‘[t]he 
Constitution’s 
impeachment 
provisions are properly understood by 
reference to this overarching constitu-
tional plan.’’ But with that very jus-
tification in mind, their argument fails 
once again. In an impeachment, it is 
the accused’s office that permits the 
impeachment. Ceasing to hold that of-
fice terminates the possibility and the 
purpose of impeachment. 
Private persons may not be im-
peached in America, and so they ask 
you to look back at the British model. 
The Constitution, as I see it, does not 
make private citizens subject to im-
peachment. The Founders rejected the 
British model that allowed Parliament 
to impeach anyone, except for the 
King, and so they limited impeachment 
to certain public officials, including 
Presidents in our country. 
Next on the textual front, the pri-
mary and, in fact, only required rem-
edy of a conviction is removal. 
Article II, Section 4, states a straight-
forward rule: whenever a civil officer is im-
peached and convicted for high crimes and 
misdemeanors, they shall be removed. 
It is undeniable that in this instance 
removal is moot in every possible re-
gard. Removal is a factual and legal 
impossibility. Yet the Article of Im-
peachment itself—read it in the where-
fore clause; it calls for removal. This is 
one reason why impeachment pro-
ceedings are different from ordinary 
trials and why the Constitution point-
edly separates the two. In ordinary 
criminal jurisprudence, a person con-
victed of public crimes committed 
while he or she was in office may still 
be punished even though they no 
longer hold that office. Not so with im-
peachment. In a Senate impeachment 
trial, conviction means and requires re-
moval, and conviction without a re-
moval is no conviction at all. Only 
upon a valid conviction and its req-
uisite, enforceable removal may the 
additional judgment of disqualification 
plausibly be entertained.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S607 
February 9, 2021 
Presidents are impeachable because 
Presidents 
are 
removable. 
Former 
presidents are not because they cannot 
be removed. The Constitution is clear. 
Trial by the Senate sitting as a Court 
of Impeachment is reserved for the 
President of the United States, not a 
private citizen who used to be Presi-
dent of the United States. Just as 
clear, the judgment required upon con-
viction is removal from office, and a 
former President can no longer be re-
moved from office. 
The purpose, text and structure of the Con-
stitution’s impeachment Clauses confirm 
this intuitive and common-sense under-
standing. 
So wrote Judge Michael Luttig, 
former judge in the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-
cuit. 
And, indeed, there are State court de-
cisions that analyze this very same 
language and conclude that impeach-
ment can only be entertained against 
an existing officer subject to removal, 
in State v. Hill, from Nebraska, and 
Smith v. Brantley, a 1981 decision from 
the Florida supreme court. 
This is the first time that the United 
States Senate has ever been asked to 
apply the Constitution’s textual identi-
fication of ‘‘the President’’ in the im-
peachment provisions to anyone other 
than the sitting President of the 
United States. And, of course, most 
significantly from a textual approach, 
the term specifically used is ‘‘the 
President’’ not ‘‘a President.’’ And 
there can only be one ‘‘the Presi-
dent’’—the 
incumbent—at 
a 
time. 
Judge Luttig relies on this textual 
reading for his firm conclusion that a 
former President cannot be impeached 
or convicted. Consider the alternative, 
as Robert Delahunty and John Yoo 
have: If Mr. Trump can be convicted as 
‘‘the President,’’ the language the Con-
stitution uses, then why is he still not 
‘‘the President’’ under the Commander 
in Chief clause, for example? They are 
joined by Professor Alan Dershowitz 
and University of Chicago Professor 
Richard Epstein in their focus and con-
clusion. They point out the dangers of 
an approach that deviates from a focus 
on the text. If there is no temporal lim-
itation—that is what they suggested to 
you—remember, you can go back in 
time and impeach any civil officer who 
ever served for anything that occurred 
during the course of their service, time 
immemorial. With the House man-
agers’ position, the concept necessarily 
includes all executive officers and 
judges, including, perhaps, the im-
peachment now of Jimmy Carter for 
his handling of the Iran hostage scan-
dal, as one example. That flows logi-
cally from their argument without any 
hesitation. Further, they ask, why not 
then countenance the broad reading of 
other terms? When I say ‘‘they ask,’’ I 
mean the experts who opined on this. 
Why not then countenance a broad 
reading of other terms, such that terms 
like ‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’’ 
however broadly construed, are not in-
tended to be exclusively the only kind 
of conduct intended as impeachable. 
They conclude—these experts—by writ-
ing that a nontextual impeachment 
power would undermine the Constitu-
tion’s effort to make the President 
independent of Congress, a central goal 
of the Founding Fathers. The authors 
convincingly argue for textual analysis 
over nontextual reliance on a presen-
tation of history, suggesting that if 
one’s presentation of history were to 
control, it would expressly permit con-
duct contrary to the express language, 
leading to clearly unintended results. 
I must tell you that I have spoken to 
Judge Ken Starr at some length over 
this past week about this. This textual 
approach is something he, too, feels 
very strongly about. I also happen to 
be friendly with Chuck Cooper, by the 
way. He is a fine person. He also hap-
pens to be a person who has a strong 
animus against President Trump. But 
Chuck Cooper is a fine lawyer and a 
fine person, as I am sure our friends 
from Alabama know. 
As we already have discussed, the 
risks to the institution of the Presi-
dency and to any and all past officers 
is limited only by one’s imagination. 
The weakness of the House managers’ 
case is further demonstrated by their 
reliance on the unproven assertion that 
if President Trump is not impeached, 
future officers who are impeached will 
evade removal by resigning either be-
fore impeachment or Senate trial. 
For example, they contend, citing 
various law professors, that ‘‘[any offi-
cial] who betrayed the public trust and 
was impeached could avoid account-
ability simply by resigning one minute 
before the Senate’s final conviction 
vote.’’ 
This argument is a complete canard. 
The Constitution expressly provides in 
article I, section 3, clause 7 that a con-
victed party, following impeachment, 
‘‘shall nevertheless be liable and sub-
ject to indictment, trial, judgment, and 
punishment according to law’’ [after 
removal]. Clearly, a former civil officer 
who is not impeached is subject to the 
same. 
We have a judicial process in this 
country. We have an investigative 
process in this country to which no 
former officeholder is immune. That is 
the process that should be running its 
course. That is the process the bill of 
attainder tells us is the appropriate 
one for investigation, prosecution, and 
punishment, with all of the attributes 
of that branch. We are missing it by 
two articles here that the article III 
courts provide. They provide that kind 
of appropriate adjudication. That is ac-
countability. 
There are appropriate mechanisms in 
place for full and meaningful account-
ability not through the legislature, 
which does not and cannot offer the 
safeguards 
of 
the 
judicial 
system, 
which every private citizen is constitu-
tionally entitled to. 
But more to the point here. Their ar-
gument does nothing to empower a dif-
ferent reading of the Constitution’s 
plain text; that is, one that reads ‘‘the 
President’’ in one provision to include 
former Presidents but reads ‘‘the Presi-
dent’’ in the other provision to mean 
only the sitting President. 
Second, this red herring of an argu-
ment also fails because the former 
President did not resign, even amid 
calls by his opponents that he do so. As 
a result, the Senate need not decide 
whether it possesses the power or juris-
diction to try and convict the former 
President who resigned or how it might 
best proceed to effectuate justice in 
such a case. That is not this case. 
The plain meaning of the Constitu-
tion’s text, faithfully and consistently 
applied, should govern whether the 
United States Senate is vested by the 
Constitution with the power to convict 
a private citizen of the United States. 
It is not. 
The House managers posit in their 
trial memorandum that despite the 
fact that the primary and only nec-
essary remedy upon conviction, re-
moval, is a legal nullity, this late im-
peachment trial is appropriate because 
the other, secondary, optional remedy 
that the Senate is not even required to 
consider and which only takes effect 
upon a later, separate vote—disquali-
fication from future office—can still 
theoretically be applied to a former 
President. 
The managers contend that ‘‘Article 
II, Section 4 states a straightforward 
rule: whenever a civil officer is im-
peached and convicted for high crimes 
and misdemeanors, they ‘shall be re-
moved.’ Absolutely nothing about this 
rule implies, let alone requires, that 
former officials—who can still face dis-
qualification—are immune from im-
peachment and conviction.’’ 
That is what they say. I told you 
that today. In other words, so the argu-
ment goes, a President no longer hold-
ing office does not moot the entirety of 
remedies afforded by impeachment. 
This, however, also flies in the face of 
both the plain meaning of the text and 
the canons of statutory interpretation. 
First of all, the managers, once 
again, simply choose to ignore the 
text. Even in the passage that the man-
agers cite, the word ‘‘shall’’ does, to 
put it mildly, imply a requirement, an 
imperative such that an impeachment 
in which removal would be impossible 
is invalid. ‘‘ ‘Shall’ means shall. The 
Supreme Court . . . ha[s] made clear 
that when a statute uses the word 
‘shall,’ Congress has imposed a manda-
tory duty upon the subject of the com-
mand,’’ as in shall remove. Indeed, 
‘‘the mandatory ‘shall’ . . . normally 
creates an obligation impervious to ju-
dicial discretion.’’ 
And ‘‘[w]herever the Constitution 
commands, 
discretion 
terminates.’’ 
‘‘Shall’’ means mandatory, and ‘‘shall 
be removed’’ is not possible for a 
former officer no longer in office. Im-
peachment cannot apply. 
Now, here is the ‘‘and’’ argument.

February 9, 2021 
about it if you follow such things. This 
is another one Judge Starr is big on, 
and many of the textual scholars have 
written about it. 
The managers critically ignore this 
language in article I, section 3, clause 
7, which states that ‘‘[j]udgment in 
Cases of Impeachment shall not extend 
further than to removal from Office, 
and disqualification to hold and enjoy 
any Office of honor, Trust or Profit 
under the United States.’’ 
Ordinarily, as in everyday English, use of 
the conjunctive ‘‘and’’ in a list means that 
all of the listed requirements must be satis-
fied, while use of the disjunctive ‘‘or’’ means 
that only one of the list of requirements 
needs to be satisfied. 
Judge 
Kenneth 
Starr 
subscribes 
strongly to this argument and under-
stands the comma to provide further 
support for the reading. 
As Judge Michael Luttig, again, re-
cently argued, ‘‘The Constitution links 
the impeachment remedy of disquali-
fication from future office with the 
remedy of removal from the office that 
person currently occupies; the former 
remedy does not apply in situations 
where the latter is unavailable.’’ Con-
viction and removal are inextricably 
entwined. If removal no longer is pos-
sible, neither is an impeachment con-
viction. 
Judge Luttig’s view is consistent 
with that of Justice Joseph Story in 
his famous ‘‘Commentaries on the Con-
stitution of the United States,’’ where-
in Justice Story analyzed ‘‘that im-
peachment is inapplicable to officials 
who have left their position because re-
moval—a primary remedy that the im-
peachment process authorizes—is no 
longer necessary.’’ 
Justice Story noted that he is not 
coming to a firm posit on this. This is 
his belief, and this is his thought proc-
ess. 
There is also much force in the remark, 
that an impeachment is a proceeding purely 
of a political nature. It is not so much de-
signed to punish an offender, as to secure the 
state against gross official misdemeanors. It 
touches neither his person, nor his property; 
but simply divests him of his political capac-
ity. 
Professor Philip Bobbitt. Now, this 
is—I have to say this is insulting. We 
heard earlier today we don’t cite any 
scholars. Professor Philip Bobbitt is a 
distinguished Webster professor at Co-
lumbia University who, along with 
Professor Charles Black, wrote the 
handbook on impeachment used for 
many, many years. He is a constitu-
tional expert on impeachment. He has 
written that ‘‘there is little discussion 
in the historical record surrounding 
the precise question of whether a per-
son no longer a civil officer can be im-
peached—and in light of the clarity of 
the text, this is hardly surprising,’’ 
Professor Bobbitt wrote. 
Professor Bobbitt, by the way, who 
has a rich family history in the Demo-
cratic Party—LBJ—also asserted the 
following, as recently as January 27, 
2021, arguing against holding this trial. 
He said: 
There is no authority granted to Congress 
to impeach and convict persons who are not 
‘‘civil officers of the United States.’’ It’s as 
simple as that. But simplicity doesn’t mean 
unimportance. 
Professor Bobbitt wrote: 
Limiting Congress to its specified powers 
is a crucial element in the central idea of the 
United States Constitution: putting the 
state under law. 
Professor Bobbitt and former Stan-
ford University Law professor Richard 
Danzig have remarked that impeach-
ment’s principal purpose, as the 66th of 
the Federalist Papers makes clear, is 
to check the ‘‘encroachments of the ex-
ecutive.’’ Trial by jury, rules of evi-
dence, and other safeguards are put 
aside, they write, because of the need 
to protect the public from further 
abuse of office. 
Similarly, yesterday, Professor Eu-
gene Kontorovich wrote: The Constitu-
tion provides that the impeachment 
process is to be used to remove ‘‘all 
Civil officers of the United States’’— 
that is, people holding a government 
position. Yet in the case of Mr. Trump, 
the House is reading the Constitution 
as if it said the process applies to ‘‘all 
Civil officers of the United States, and 
people who aren’t civil officers, but 
once were.’’ Exactly what it does not 
say. 
We have been told by the House man-
agers about missed citations in our 
brief. I would like to draw your atten-
tion to page 37. This is a substantive 
misrepresentation to you, I would re-
spectfully suggest, and it reflects to me 
a very different view of democracy—a 
fear of democracy. 
They wrote on page 37 of their brief 
that the Framers—I am paraphrasing 
the first part. 
The Framers themselves would not have 
hesitated to convict on these facts. Their 
worldview was shaped by a study of classical 
history, as well as a lived experience of re-
sistance and revolution. They were well 
aware of the danger posed by opportunists 
who incited mobs to violence for political 
gain. They drafted the Constitution to avoid 
such thuggery, which they associated with 
‘‘the threat of civil disorder and the early as-
sumption of power by a dictator.’’ 
The citation is ‘‘178, Bernard Bailyn, 
The Ideological Origins of the Amer-
ican Revolution.’’ That is this book. 
Professor Bailyn, when he gave his 
description of the threat of civil dis-
order and the early assumption of 
power by a dictator and thuggery, was 
referring to early colonists’ view to-
ward democracy. They feared democ-
racy. That is what they called thug-
gery, democracy, because it is an 
elitist’s point of view—an elitist’s po-
litical point of view. We don’t fear de-
mocracy. We embrace it. 
In summing up, let’s be crystal clear 
on where we stand and why we are 
here. The singular goal of the House 
managers and House leadership in pur-
suing the impeachment conviction of 
Donald J. Trump is to use these pro-
ceedings to disenfranchise at least 74 
million Americans with whom they vis-
cerally disagree and to ensure that nei-
ther they nor any other American ever 
again can cast a vote for Donald 
Trump. And if they convince you to go 
forward, their ultimate hope is that 
this will be a shot across the bow of 
any other candidate for public office 
who would dare to take up a political 
message that is very different from 
their own political point of view as to 
the direction in which they wish to 
take our country. 
Under our Constitution, this body 
and the impeachment process must 
never be permitted to be weaponized 
for partisan political purposes. This 
Article of Impeachment must be dis-
missed for lack of jurisdiction based on 
what we have discussed here today and 
what is in our brief. The institution of 
the Presidency is at risk unless a 
strong message is sent by the dismissal 
of the Article of Impeachment. 
Before we close, I want to leave you 
with two thoughts. One was expressed 
by Abraham Lincoln. He comes to mind 
first because of the way in which our 
Nation is now divided. We must learn 
from his times. He had a simple but im-
portant message about the paramount 
importance of doing what is right. Mr. 
Lincoln said: 
Stand with anybody that stands Right. 
Stand with him when he is right and Part 
with him when he goes wrong. . . . In both 
cases you are right. In both cases you oppose 
the dangerous extremes. In both cases you 
stand on moral ground and hold the ship 
level and steady. In both you are national 
and nothing less than national. 
And the second message is from one 
of Mr. Lincoln’s favorite poets who 
wrote in 1849, at a time fraught with 
division and at risk for even more. The 
message from that other time of divi-
sion—a call for hope and unity to bring 
strength—has special meaning today. 
A poem Longfellow wrote: 
Sail forth into the sea, O ship! 
Through wind and wave, right onward steer! 
The moistened eye, the trembling lip, 
Are not the signs of doubt or fear. 
Sail forth into the sea of life, 
O gentle, loving, trusting wife, 
And safe from all adversity 
Upon the bosom of that sea 
Thy comings and thy goings be! 
For gentleness and love and trust 
Prevail o’er angry wave and gust; 
And in the wreck of noble lives 
Something immortal still survives! 
Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State! 
Sail on, O Union, strong and great! 
Humanity with all its fears, 
With all the hopes of future years, 
Is hanging breathless on thy fate! 
We know what Master laid thy keel, 
What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel, 
Who made each mast, and sail, and rope, 
What anvils rang, what hammers beat, 
In what a forge and what a heat 
Were shaped the anchors of thy hope! 
Fear not each sudden sound and shock, 
’Tis of the wave and not the rock; 
’Tis but the flapping of the sail, 
And not a rent made by the gale! 
In spite of rock and tempest’s roar, 
In spite of false lights on the shore, 
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea! 
Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee, 
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears, 
Our faith triumphant o’er our fears, 
Are all with thee,—are all with thee!

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S609 
February 9, 2021 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
it has been a long day. We thank you, 
and we thank all the Senators for their 
careful attention to the legal argu-
ments and your courtesy to the man-
agers and to the lawyers here. 
This has been the most bipartisan 
impeachment in American history, and 
we hope it will continue to be so in the 
days ahead. And nothing could be more 
bipartisan than the desire to recess. 
So the only issue before the Senate 
today, of course, is whether Donald 
Trump is subject to the Court of Im-
peachment that the Senate has con-
vened. We see no need to make any fur-
ther argument that this body has the 
power to convict and to disqualify 
President Trump for his breathtaking 
constitutional crime of inciting a vio-
lent insurrection against our govern-
ment. 
Tomorrow, we will address the amaz-
ing array of issues suggested by the 
thoughtful presentations by our col-
leagues, by including the First Amend-
ment, due process, partisanship under 
our Constitution, the bill of attainder 
clause, and many, many more. 
But, in the meantime, we waive all 
further arguments. We waive our 33 
minutes of rebuttal, and we give those 
33 minutes, gratefully, back to the Sen-
ate of the United States. 
(Chorus of Hear! Hear!) 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is all 
time yielded back? 
All time has been yielded back. 
The question is whether Donald John 
Trump is subject to the jurisdiction of 
a Court of Impeachment for acts com-
mitted while President of the United 
States, notwithstanding the expiration 
of his term in that office? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there a sufficient second? 
There is a sufficient second. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S613 
February 9, 2021 
The Senate, without any intervening action, 
motion, or amendment, except for delibera-
tion by the Senate, if so ordered under the 
Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Sen-
ate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials (re-
ferred to in this resolution as the ‘‘Rules of 
Impeachment’’), shall then decide the fore-
going question by the yeas and nays. If a ma-
jority of Senators voting, a quorum being 
present, shall vote in the negative, the Sen-
ate shall order that the article of impeach-
ment be immediately dismissed and the Sec-
retary shall notify the House of Representa-
tives of the order of dismissal. If a majority 
of Senators voting, a quorum being present, 
shall vote in the affirmative, the Senate 
shall proceed as provided in this resolution. 
SEC. 3. The former President and the House 
of Representatives shall have until 9:00 a.m. 
on Wednesday, February 10, 2021, to file any 
motions permitted under the Rules of Im-
peachment with the exception of motions to 
subpoena witnesses or documents or any 
other evidentiary motions. Responses to any 
such motions shall be filed no later than 
11:00 a.m. on Wednesday, February 10, 2021. 
All materials filed pursuant to this section 
shall be filed with the Secretary and be 
printed and made available to all parties. Ar-
guments on such motions shall begin at 12:00 
p.m. on Wednesday, February 10, 2021, and 
each side may determine the number of per-
sons to make its presentation, following 
which the Senate shall deliberate, if so or-
dered under the Rules of Impeachment, and 
vote on any such motions. 
SEC. 4. Following the disposition of such 
motions, or if no motions are made, then the 
House of Representatives shall make its 
presentation in support of the article of im-
peachment for a period of time not to exceed 
16 hours, over up to 2 session days. If no mo-
tions are made under section 3, the House of 
Representatives shall begin its presentation 
at 12:00 p.m. on Wednesday, February 10, 
2021. Following the House of Representa-
tives’ presentation, the former President 
shall make his presentation for a period not 
to exceed 16 hours, over up to 2 session days. 
Each side may determine the number of per-
sons to make its presentation. Each side 
shall have the right to decide for how many 
hours it shall make its presentation on each 
of the up to 2 session days allotted to it, ex-
cept that neither side shall make its presen-
tation for more than 8 hours on any single 
session day. The parties’ presentations need 
not be limited to argument from the record 
described in section 1. 
SEC. 5. Upon the conclusion of the period 
allotted for presentations by the parties as 
provided under section 4, Senators may ques-
tion the parties for a period of time not to 
exceed 4 hours over not more than 1 session 
day. 
SEC. 6. Upon conclusion of the period allot-
ted for Senators’ questions as provided under 
section 5, there shall be 2 hours of argument, 
equally divided between the parties, followed 
by deliberation by the Senate, if so ordered 
under the Rules of Impeachment, on the 
question of whether it shall be in order to 
consider and debate under the Rules of Im-
peachment any motion to subpoena wit-
nesses or documents. The Senate, without 
any intervening action, motion, or amend-
ment, shall then decide by the yeas and nays 
whether it shall be in order to consider and 
debate under the Rules of Impeachment any 
motion to subpoena witnesses or documents. 
Following the disposition of that question, 
other motions provided under the Rules of 
Impeachment shall be in order. 
SEC. 7. (a) If the Senate agrees to allow ei-
ther the House of Representatives or the 
former President to subpoena witnesses, the 
witnesses shall first be deposed and the par-
ties shall be allowed other appropriate dis-
covery. The Senate shall decide after deposi-
tion and other appropriate discovery which, 
if any, witnesses shall testify, pursuant to 
the Rules of Impeachment. No testimony 
shall be admissible in the Senate unless the 
parties have had the opportunity to depose 
such witnesses and to conduct other appro-
priate discovery. 
(b) If the Senate agrees to allow either 
party to subpoena witnesses, provisions for 
the admission of evidence, issuance of sub-
poenas, arrangements for depositions, other 
appropriate discovery, testimony by wit-
nesses in the Senate, if such testimony is or-
dered by the Senate, and any related matters 
are to be determined by subsequent resolu-
tion of the Senate. 
SEC. 8. (a) If the Senate decides that no 
party shall be permitted to subpoena wit-
nesses pursuant to section 6, the House of 
Representatives shall be recognized to make 
a motion to admit into evidence the mate-
rials relied upon by the House of Representa-
tives during the trial. The House of Rep-
resentatives shall be recognized to make 
such a motion, however, only if it has dis-
closed to the former President all materials 
it will move to admit into evidence at least 
48 hours before making said motion. Argu-
ments on the motion shall be limited to 1 
hour equally divided. The Senate, without 
any intervening action, motion, or amend-
ment, shall then decide by the yeas and nays 
whether to admit into evidence such mate-
rials. If a majority of Senators voting, a 
quorum being present, shall vote in the af-
firmative, the materials shall be admitted 
into evidence. If a majority of Senators vot-
ing, a quorum being present, shall vote in 
the negative, the materials shall not be ad-
mitted into evidence. The former President 
shall then be recognized to make a motion to 
admit into evidence the materials relied 
upon by the former President during the 
trial. The former President shall be recog-
nized to make such a motion, however, only 
if he has disclosed to the House of Represent-
atives all materials he will move to admit 
into evidence at least 48 hours before making 
said motion. Arguments on the motion shall 
be limited to 1 hour equally divided. The 
Senate, without any intervening action, mo-
tion, or amendment, shall then decide by the 
yeas and nays whether to admit into evi-
dence such materials. If a majority of Sen-
ators voting, a quorum being present, shall 
vote in the affirmative, the materials shall 
be admitted into evidence. If a majority of 
Senators voting, a quorum being present, 
shall vote in the negative, the materials 
shall not be admitted into evidence. 
(b) The disclosure requirements estab-
lished under subsection (a) shall not apply to 
evidence discovered by the movant after the 
disclosure deadline, so long as the movant 
declares in writing that the movant was un-
aware of such evidence until after the disclo-
sure deadline, and that such evidence could 
not reasonably have been discovered until 
after the disclosure deadline. 
(c) The admission of any evidence pursuant 
to this section shall not be treated as a con-
cession by any party as to the truth of the 
matter asserted by the parties, and the Sen-
ate as the trier of fact shall decide the 
weight to be given such evidence. 
SEC. 9. Unless the Senate shall have al-
ready voted on the article of impeachment, 
the Senate shall convene as a Court of Im-
peachment at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, February 
14, 2021, notwithstanding rule III of the Rules 
of Impeachment. 
SEC. 10. Immediately upon the conclusion 
of any action by the Senate under section 8, 
or immediately upon the next day on which 
the Senate reconvenes as a Court of Im-
peachment after the conclusion of such ac-
tion, the Senate shall proceed to final argu-
ments as provided in the Rules of Impeach-
ment, waiving the 2-person rule contained in 
rule XXII of the Rules of Impeachment. Such 
arguments shall not exceed 4 hours, equally 
divided between the parties. 
SEC. 11. At the conclusion of final argu-
ments as provided under section 10, the Sen-
ate, without intervening action, except for 
deliberation if so ordered under the Rules of 
Impeachment, shall vote on the article of 
impeachment.
