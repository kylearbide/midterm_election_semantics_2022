DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE

nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
June as National Dairy Month. 
National Dairy Month began as Na-
tional Milk Month in 1937. Now it has 
developed into an annual tradition that 
celebrates the contributions the dairy 
industry has made to the world. 
Milk contains nine essential nutri-
ents which may help reduce your risk 
of high blood pressure, osteoporosis, 
and certain cancers; yet dairy prod-
ucts, particularly milk, continue to be 
unfairly demonized. 
Coming from a long line of dairy 
farmers, I understand the impact that 
this decrease in milk consumption has 
caused. Not only does it hurt our dairy 
industry, but it has also resulted in the 
loss of an entire generation of milk 
drinkers, which has negatively im-
pacted their health. 
That is why I introduced the Whole 
Milk For Healthy Kids Act in March of 
this year with the gentleman from New 
York, Mr. ANTONIO DELGADO. This bill 
addresses the importance of providing 
both flavored and unflavored whole 
milk in school cafeterias. 
This builds upon the efforts from the 
School Milk Nutrition Act, which al-
lows for flavored and unflavored 1 per-
cent milk to return as an option for 
the National School Lunch and School 
Breakfast Programs. 
Last month, Mr. JOE COURTNEY and I 
led a bipartisan coalition of 55 Mem-
bers of Congress from across the coun-
try in writing a letter to Secretary 
Vilsack of the USDA. This letter urged 
him to codify the efforts to continue to 
provide schools the option to offer low- 
fat flavored or unflavored milk. 
Whether it is protein to help build 
and repair the muscle tissues of active 
bodies or vitamin A to help maintain 
healthy skin, dairy products are a nat-
ural nutrient powerhouse. 
That is why, Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to sign on to my bill, the 
Whole Milk For Healthy Kids Act, dur-
ing National Dairy Month and allow 
our students the option of consuming 
the type of milk that they love. 
And this month, when you pour a 
glass of milk, enjoy a cheese board, or 
cool down with some ice cream, re-
member the hardworking dairy farmers 
and farm families who made that pos-
sible. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
COURTNEY ANN NEALE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Court-
ney Ann Neale, my office’s press sec-
retary and digital manager. Courtney 
passed away suddenly on May 23. 
It is still hard to fully express how 
much my staff and I feel Courtney’s 
spirit, her energy, and her strength, 
and we miss her. She was an activist to 
the core and a dedicated public serv-
ant, an untiring advocate for women, 
for working-class people, immigrants, 
and communities of color. 
In the year before she joined our of-
fice, Courtney was diagnosed with sev-
eral medical conditions that changed 
her daily life. Still, she continued her 
fight for a world where healthcare and 
education 
are 
guaranteed 
rights. 
Courtney stood strongly by her prin-
ciples and—this I can tell you from per-
sonal 
experience—challenged 
those 
around her to do the same. 
As press secretary and digital man-
ager, Courtney was a member of my of-
fice’s communication team. Now, com-
munications on the Hill can feel a bit 
like a one-way street, getting the mes-
sage out fast before turning to the next 
thing. But Courtney took the meaning 
of 
communications 
seriously. 
Even 
under the greatest time crunch, she 
seemed to approach each tweet, each 
press statement, as a two-way dia-
logue. 
She not only got out our message; 
most mornings she would bring new 
messages in, raising attention to feed-
back on social media or local angles on 
national news. True to her title as a 
communicator, Courtney didn’t just 
tell, she also learned and responded, 
ensuring that constituents were heard. 
And while she was known as our of-
fice’s authority on all things social 
media, she gracefully filled many other

roles in her personal life. She was an 
adventurous traveler; an avid reader; a 
doting dog mom; and beloved daughter, 
sister, and friend. 
Despite the hectic Hill schedule, she 
still prioritized time with colleagues, 
friends, and family. Principled work 
was a passion, but a principled life was 
the goal. 
So her memory is more than a leg-
acy. It is a call to action, to take care 
of yourself, and take care of others as 
well, to give selflessly, and to savor 
what you have. Courtney dared to 
dream. She challenged us to act. 
Alongside the many joyful memories 
she leaves with us, it is those actions 
that we remember. On and off Capitol 
Hill, Courtney helped advance the pro-
gressive cause and, through it all, re-
mained a kind and grounded person. 
As my staff and I mourn her passing, 
we also resolve ourselves to honor her 
legacy by continuing to fight for the 
better, fairer world that she so passion-
ately believed in. 
My prayers are with Courtney’s par-
ents, 
Jill 
and 
Kevin; 
her 
sister, 
Marissa; and the incredible network of 
friends she made along the way in Mil-
waukee, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. 
Rest in peace, Courtney.

OUR NATION’S CURRENT 
ECONOMIC TRAJECTORY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today with great con-
cern for our Nation’s current economic 
trajectory. 
Inflation is spiraling out of control, 
unemployment numbers continue to 
disappoint, and millions of small busi-
nesses are unable to fill job openings. 
This pattern is increasingly alarming; 
and for anyone who is paying atten-
tion, it is not a surprise. 
The Biden administration’s plan to 
throw money at problems is failing the 
American people. This so-called rescue 
plan is stunting our economic recovery 
and impeding our Nation’s comeback 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
As President Biden makes even more 
plans to squander our taxpayer dollars, 
prices 
are 
skyrocketing. 
American 
families are experiencing this first-
hand. As they see every day, the stag-
gering 5 percent increase in inflation is 
affecting nearly everything, including 
essentials. Together, food and energy 
prices have increased nearly 4 percent. 
And with the current cost of materials, 
not even the kitchen sink is safe. 
At home in Pennsylvania, no one is 
shocked that gas is more than 50 per-
cent more expensive today than a year 
ago. Our Commonwealth already has 
one of the highest gas taxes in the Na-
tion, burdening workers and families 
alike. We cannot afford to keep paying 
more at the pump. 
For hardworking families in Pennsyl-
vania and around the country, the cost 
of inflation is real. It is real at the gro-
cery store. It is real at the gas pump. It 
is real at the hardware store and at the 
local diner. It is real for every Penn-
sylvanian every day of the week. 
As a nation, we cannot ignore the 
sound and source of this alarming 
trend. This is rooted in President 
Biden’s and the Democrats’ broken eco-
nomic agenda. From higher taxes and 
fewer jobs, to more regulations and 
burdens on American industries, their 
plan is not working. 
Day after day, we see more evidence 
of this. Just last week, the developers 
of the Keystone pipeline stopped this 
project after the Biden administration 
effectively eliminated its opportunity 
to succeed. Not only will this decision 
hinder America’s energy independence 
and security, it is also killing family- 
sustaining jobs for American workers. 
The Biden administration already 
killed the pipeline. What will be next? 
As inflation rises, the unemployment 
rate remains disappointingly high and 
our work force is suffering. This should 
be a major warning to all of us that we 
must stop this trend now. We cannot 
afford to stay entrenched in President 
Biden’s 1970s-era economic crisis. 
We must advance pro-work, pro- 
growth solutions that will jump-start 
America’s recovery from the COVID–19 
pandemic, and it starts with getting 
Americans back to work, supporting 
our small businesses, and strength-
ening the workforce. It also requires 
ending the current administration’s in-
fatuation with Big Government inter-
vention. 
The American people don’t want 
more of the same. We simply cannot af-
ford more of it. This is a time to invest 
in American workers, to promote the 
dignity of hard work, and restore our 
Nation to the path of recovery. 
NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor and cele-
brate a truly essential industry at 
home in Pennsylvania and around our 
country. 
Dairy farmers go to work every day 
of the year to produce safe and healthy 
food for all American people. Despite 
mounting regulations and obstacles, 
these hardworking men and women 
continue to persevere. 
Dairy products, including nutrient- 
rich whole milk, are good for our kids 
and good for our families, and they are 
essential for our region’s economy. 
I have the distinct privilege of rep-
resenting nearly 20 percent of Penn-
sylvania’s dairy farms, which are home 
to more than a quarter of our Common-
wealth’s dairy cows. 
This robust industry is a key part of 
our local community and our economy. 
It is truly my privilege to stand up for 
dairy farmers and to serve as their 
voice here in Congress as we seek to 
eliminate barriers to the dairy indus-
try’s success. 
As we mark National Dairy Month, I 
thank dairy farmers in Pennsylvania 
and across the country for their stead-
fast dedication to our communities and 
to American families.

HIGHLIGHTING 
THE 
STAFF 
OF 
MANCHESTER VA MEDICAL CEN-
TER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the incredible ef-
forts of the staff at the Manchester, 
New Hampshire, VA Medical Center, 
who worked long hours to resolve a 
massive backlog of unpaid medical 
claims for community care. 
In a district where veterans travel 
long distances to get to a VA facility, 
community care has been a game- 
changer for vets to receive the services 
they need closer to home. But in the 
early years of the Choice Act, and now 
the Mission Act, provider payment 
delays and bureaucratic errors threat-
ened the stability of community care 
networks and, ultimately, the access to 
critical lifesaving care for veterans. 
One of the first providers who con-
tacted our office was an acupuncturist 
who provides care to veterans experi-
encing PTS and debilitating pain. The 
acupuncturist was passionate about 
caring for those who served, but the 
chronic billing delays were creating se-
vere uncertainty and financial hard-
ship for her office. 
She introduced me to a group of vet-
erans that she cares for in her office to 
learn a little bit more about their expe-
rience. They all had a remarkable 
story about how their quality of life 
had improved since accessing these 
services through VA community care. 
But they understood that payment 
delays could disrupt that. 
Countless other providers, including 
large hospital systems and small care 
organizations, were also caught up in 
this claims backlog. The VA was mak-
ing it difficult, if not impossible, for 
many of these providers to continue 
serving veterans. 
The issue of unpaid claims was com-
pounded in the Northeast region by 
VA’s 
multiple 
transitions 
between 
third-party administrators over the 
last few years. It created confusion and 
frustration in both the provider and 
the veteran communities. 
I knew we couldn’t let our veterans 
down, and that is why I am so thankful 
for the efforts of the community care 
team at the Manchester VA for work-
ing with our office, with providers, as 
well as the third-party billers to thor-
oughly address this issue. 
Our office worked closely with the 
leadership at the Manchester VA Med-
ical Center and the New Hampshire 
Hospital Association and its members. 
A plan was developed to painstakingly 
delve into the minutiae of the claims 
backlog, line by line, so that providers 
could be paid for legacy claims and re-
ceive timely payments for future serv-
ices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2751 
June 15, 2021 
The Manchester VA Medical Center’s 
Office of Community Care steadily 
plowed through the backlog, giving 
specialized attention to each provider. 
After more than 15 months of their 
hard work, I am proud these diligent 
efforts have resulted in tens of millions 
of dollars of paid claims to New Hamp-
shire’s VA Community Care providers. 
They were so successful in this work 
that their internal process is now being 
shared nationally across the VA sys-
tem as a model. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to person-
ally thank the team members at the 
VA in Manchester who put in so many 
hours to address this backlog, includ-
ing: 
Michelle Mercer, who spent consider-
able time dealing with each member’s 
hospital billing department; 
Patricia Patterson, who also spent 
considerable time dealing with each 
member’s billing department; 
Tracy Allaire, who worked closely 
with Tri-West on claims on behalf of 
hospitals on the back end; 
Charlene Eaton, who supervised and 
provided oversight to the VA Office of 
Community Care staff; 
Dr. Brain Phemester, who worked 
and provided leadership and served as a 
conduit between VA Central Office and 
the New Hampshire Hospital Associa-
tion and its members; 
And Daniel Wilson, who initially 
spearheaded the billing resolution ef-
fort within the VA Central Office, and 
worked with our district office and the 
Hospital Association. 
These Manchester VA Medical Center 
employees went above and beyond the 
call of duty for our veterans and the 
providers, as well as the future of com-
munity care. I couldn’t be more proud 
to be able to recognize them for their 
efforts here today.

AMERICA DESERVES BETTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in 
fierce 
opposition 
to 
President 
Biden’s proposed budget. 
When he released his budget just a 
few weeks ago, nearly 3 months later 
than any President in a transition 
year, by the way, President Biden re-
minded Americans of advice his father 
gave him years ago. ‘‘Don’t tell me 
what you value,’’ Biden’s father told 
him. ‘‘Show me your budget, and I’ll 
tell you what you value.’’ 
If that is true, then Biden’s $6 tril-
lion budget reveals to us exactly what 
President 
Biden 
values: 
destroying 
America’s 
oil 
and 
gas 
industry, 
prioritizing the rights of illegal immi-
grants over law-abiding Americans, 
funneling foreign aid away from our 
longtime ally Israel, turning a blind 
eye to protecting the unborn. 
Under the Biden budget, President 
Biden suggests we spend our hard- 
earned dollars fixing problems he cre-
ated. 
He wants us spending $174 billion on 
electric cars, carports, car charging 
stations, and other subsidies to the 
electric vehicle market in a full-on at-
tempt to replace the oil and gas indus-
try; $40 billion to retain employees who 
lost their jobs after he blocked the 
Keystone pipeline and destroyed thou-
sands of energy jobs; and a total of $36 
billion to combat climate change, 
bringing back the waters of the U.S. 
rule and mandating 30 percent of our 
privately owned land be locked in con-
servation practices. President Biden’s 
budget is the progressive’s Green New 
Deal in disguise, and America doesn’t 
want anything to do with it. 
President Biden wants $2 billion to 
provide care for unaccompanied mi-
grant children at our southern border 
after he put millions of innocent chil-
dren in harm’s way and encouraged im-
migrants to cross illegally. He wants 
no extension of funding to complete 
the already nearly finished wall system 
or money to enforce our immigration 
laws at the border and instead instated 
an executive order stopping construc-
tion on the very wall that keeps our 
country safe. 
President Biden wants $63.5 billion 
for international affairs spending, a 12 
percent increase from 2022 that lacks 
specific defense funding for Israel, 
America’s only democratic ally in the 
Middle East. His omission is clear and 
comes at a time when the terrorist or-
ganization Hamas launched hundreds 
of rockets at Israel in the last month 
alone and when Democrats are on the 
record for their anti-Semitic language 
and slurs. 
And President Biden refuses to pro-
tect our dollars from being spent on 
abortions or abortion services. Instead, 
for the first time in four decades, no 
such protection exists, a protection 
that 77 percent of Americans support 
and a protection even Biden supported 
for years before his Presidential cam-
paign. 
On top of all this, President Biden 
claims his budget is partly in response 
to the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, but 
like the American Rescue Plan, it, too, 
fails to investigate the origins of 
COVID–19. Even more, the Biden ad-
ministration won’t commit that none 
of the budget requests would include 
funding for the research at the Wuhan 
lab. 
The economic disaster to follow from 
his 
reckless 
spending 
will 
cripple 
American families’ purchasing power 
and leave future generations with the 
crushing burden of the national debt. It 
is time we hold President Biden ac-
countable for a budget that would 
cause our Federal debt to reach 117 per-
cent of gross domestic product by 2031, 
the highest level since World War II, 
and continue the record rates of infla-
tion we are already seeing under Presi-
dent Biden. 
I ran for Congress with the intention 
of creating a better world for my chil-
dren, our children, one where they 
don’t have to pay President Biden’s 
debts and suffer the consequences of ir-
responsible and egregious spending. 
America deserves better.

CELEBRATING CARIBBEAN- 
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, it is 
spring, the beginning of summer, but it 
is also Caribbean-American Heritage 
Month this June. It brings me great 
pride to join Virgin Islanders and other 
Caribbean people across the country in 
celebrating Caribbean-American Herit-
age Month. 
As a Virgin Islander and an American 
of Caribbean descent, I am proud to 
celebrate the life, legacy, and achieve-
ment of Caribbean people in this coun-
try. Virgin Islanders and other Ameri-
cans of Caribbean lineage have made 
enormous contributions to the United 
States through academia, athletics, 
the arts, and more. 
Caribbeans have been involved in this 
country since its inception, such as des 
gens de couleurs libres, who included 
800 French-Caribbean soldiers, 500 of 
whom were Haitian free men of color 
who fought at the battle of Savannah 
for the Colonies in the American Revo-
lution. 
Caribbean-American Heritage Month 
was officially celebrated and recog-
nized on June 5, 2006, by Presidential 
proclamation 
signed 
by 
President 
George W. Bush. It had been unani-
mously adopted in the House in 2005 
through the unwavering power of our 
colleague BARBARA LEE, who sponsored 
the legislation. Since 2006, the White 
House has released an annual procla-
mation recognizing June as National 
Caribbean-American Heritage Month. 
Caribbean Americans have added to 
the history, culture, and communities 
in America in countless ways. The 
unique relationship between the United 
States and the Caribbean has enriched 
both regions, and this month is a won-
derful time to celebrate our shared 
past and our future. 
We should also look for opportunities 
for us as Americans to pursue new 
partnerships on a number of issues 
with the Caribbean. From trade, immi-
gration, disaster preparedness, poverty 
eradication, and ending HIV/AIDS, the 
United States and the Caribbean share 
a number of mutual policy interests. 
This year, the COVID–19 pandemic 
adds a new challenge to both our coun-
try and our Caribbean neighbors. I will 
keep fighting to ensure that the United 
States works to be an active and con-
structive partner in safeguarding the 
health and welfare of our third border. 
The people of the Caribbean are as 
much a part of the fabric of this coun-
try as anyone else. We are not mono-
lithic, nor do we represent one culture, 
one ideology, or even one ethnicity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2752 
June 15, 2021 
Alexander Hamilton, the drafter of the 
United States Constitution and our 
first Secretary of the Treasury, was 
born on the island of Nevis and spent 
his childhood and formative years on 
my home, St. Croix, in the Danish West 
Indies, what is now the Virgin Islands. 
Caribbean-American 
heritage 
not 
only flows through the fabric of this 
country; it also flows through the Halls 
of Congress every day. Shirley Chis-
holm, a personal hero of mine, was the 
first African-American Congresswoman 
and the first Black woman to run for 
President, nominated by a major party. 
Her heritage hails from Barbados and 
Guyana. 
Without 
her, 
Caribbean 
women, even Black women, myself, and 
many other of my colleagues would not 
be 
here 
today: 
YVETTE
CLARKE, 
JENNIFFER
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, ALEXAN-
DRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE, FREDERICA WILSON, former Mem-
bers 
Mia 
Love 
and 
Ileana 
Ros- 
Lehtinen, and many more. Even our 
current Vice President, KAMALA HAR-
RIS, is of Jamaican descent. 
The Caribbean people have done so 
much more than just fight and make 
laws for this country. That doesn’t 
even scratch the surface. The building 
we are standing in right now was de-
signed by Dr. William Thornton, who 
was born on the island of Jost Van 
Dyke in the British Virgin Islands. The 
symbol of our democracy was designed 
by a Caribbean American. 
Our works in the arts are felt every 
day: news commentators Joy Reid, 
Yamiche Alcindor, Karine Jean-Pierre; 
from Sidney Poitier, the first Black 
man to win an Academy Award, to 
Kerry Washington. Who can forget 
Cicely Tyson and Harry Belafonte; 
great 
minds 
like 
Edward 
Wilmot 
Blyden, the father of Pan-Africanism; 
Denmark 
Vesey; 
Malcolm 
X; 
and 
Stokely Carmichael. 
In music, we have managed to not 
only be great but iconic as well: Max-
well, who is considered to be the god-
father of neo-soul and the R&B move-
ment; 
Biggie 
Smalls, 
a 
fellow 
Brooklynite born to Jamaican parents, 
changed hip-hop forever; and Nicki 
Minaj, who is changing it even more in 
the modern era. 
Some of the greatest athletes of our 
time 
are 
Caribbean, 
from 
Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar, whose family is from 
Trinidad, to Tim Duncan, from my 
home on St. Croix, who was just elect-
ed to the hall of fame, and even Ramon 
Harewood in the NFL. 
During this unique time in our coun-
try’s history, I encourage everyone to 
learn more about the contributions of 
Caribbean Americans.

DEMOCRATIC DOUBLE STANDARDS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
that woman, and I am back to talk 
about the Democratic double standards 
once again. 
Democrats love to jump on the Re-
publican outrage train. But when we 
see the blatant anti-Semitism from one 
of their own, all you see are timid, 
fake, pandering, and watered-down re-
sponses. 
For those of you who struggle to 
keep up with the latest anti-Semitic 
rhetoric from a Democrat, I am refer-
ring to the Congresswoman from this 
Chamber comparing the United States 
and Israel to real terrorist organiza-
tions. 
The Speaker and her leadership team 
issued a weak and embarrassing press 
release thanking her for her clarifica-
tion and walking back her remarks. 
But, of course, Democrats are not seri-
ous in disciplining anti-Semitism, or 
even anti-American remarks, within 
their ranks. 
This photo of the Speaker smiling 
next to the Congresswoman from Min-
nesota was on the cover of the March 
2019 edition of Rolling Stone. This 
came after the Congresswoman from 
Minnesota had tweeted, and then de-
fended, that ‘‘Israel has hypnotized the 
world’’ and implied that the Jewish 
people were buying political support by 
tweeting: ‘‘It’s all about the Benjamins 
baby.’’ 
The cover of the magazine says: 
‘‘Women Shaping the Future: NANCY 
PELOSI
and the New Voices of the 
House.’’ 
Is this really the voice of the Demo-
cratic Party, Madam Speaker? 
Can you imagine, for one moment, 
the Democratic outrage if this were the 
Republican leader and the Congress-
woman from Georgia? There would be 
demands for resignations, and Repub-
lican office phones would be ringing off 
the hook from leftwing, liberal activ-
ists. 
I ask the Speaker, are you truly 
proud of this photo? 
I can’t wait to hear her answer. I just 
hope she won’t be as demeaning as the 
last 
time 
she 
spoke 
about 
‘‘that 
woman.’’

bers are reminded to address their re-

ceived viewing audience.

REPUBLICANS SUPPORT POLICE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. NEHLS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, as a 30- 
year law enforcement veteran, the 
rhetoric and hatred I have seen toward 
law enforcement the past 12 months 
are, quite honestly, infuriating. 
Liberal cities across our country 
have defunded hundreds of millions 
from their police. Seattle, Portland, 
Minneapolis, Austin, they all cut police 
budgets, and every single one of them 
is 
now 
experiencing 
skyrocketing 
crime. 
No surprise. Less police equal more 
crime, common sense that doesn’t seem 
all too common in today’s Democratic 
Party. 
Whatever happened to the Demo-
cratic Party of Bill Clinton? In 1994, 
Clinton added 100,000 law enforcement 
officers to the streets with the COPS 
grants. Today’s Democratic Party is 
unrecognizable to that party. 
The socialist squad is the de facto 
leaders of the Democrats, and they are 
the driving force behind the defund the 
police movement. They would rather 
see 100,000 less police than 100,000 more. 
The Republican Party has never 
wavered in our steadfast support for 
our Nation’s law enforcement. I hope 
to see the Democrats will one day em-
brace common sense and join us.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DON 
L. TAYLOR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the memory and 
celebrate the life of Don L. Taylor, a 
lifelong resident of Wisconsin and a 
friend, who peacefully passed away at 
age 88 on April 16, 2021, surrounded by 
his family. 
Don was active in many civic and 
service organizations and wore many 
hats throughout his lifetime. He served 
honorably as a second lieutenant in the 
U.S. Army and was a longtime member 
and past president of the Waukesha Ro-
tary Club. He spent his leisure time 
writing 
historical 
fiction 
set 
in 
Waukesha. He also had many other in-
terests and, as many Wisconsinites do, 
Don enjoyed many trips to his family 
cabin up north in Wisconsin. 
Don was a staple in the Waukesha 
community due to his involvement in 
the Waukesha State Bank. Don suc-
ceeded his father, Carl, as president 
and CEO of the Waukesha State Bank, 
a role he held for 25 years, from 1969 to 
1994. Don is credited with modernizing 
the operations of the bank and comput-
erizing operations in 1968, one of the 
first banks to do so. In 2004 Don’s son, 
Ty Taylor, became the third genera-
tion of the family to serve as president 
of the bank. 
Don will also be remembered for his 
deep involvement in politics. He served 
as chairman of the Waukesha County 
Republican Party for 30 years, from 
1979 to 1989, and again from 1993 to 2013. 
Don was one of the early pioneers in 
Waukesha to help grow the conserv-
ative movement, and his efforts cannot 
be understated for their lasting impact 
today. Don was recognized for his orga-
nizing capabilities by being selected to 
chair and co-chair President Ronald 
Reagan’s 1968, 1980, and 1984 Wisconsin 
campaigns. 
Above all else, Don Taylor was first 
and foremost a man of faith. He was a 
devoted Christian who lived his values 
through his everyday work and his 
family life. 
Don is survived by his loving wife of 
62 years, Carol. He is also survived by

THIS NATION WON’T GIVE UP ITS 
LIBERTIES EASILY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, for 
over 200 years, American citizens have 
chosen dangerous freedom over peace-
ful subjugation. For the past few dec-
ades, 
the 
American 
patriot 
has 
watched in horror as the Federal Gov-
ernment has opened the shackles of 
safety and firmly clamped them around 
the Second Amendment. 
As the Second Amendment restric-
tions have risen, so has violent crime. 
Washington wonders in one moment 
why violent crime is rising, and then 
takes away the right of Americans to 
defend themselves in the next. 
Mr. Speaker, the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ex-
ists for the sole purpose of regulating 
and keeping me from three of the 
things I hold most dear as an Amer-
ican. 
This administration’s proposed head 
of the ATF thinks that the Second 
Amendment was created for hunting 
and sporting. David Chipman could not 
be more wrong. The purpose of the Sec-
ond Amendment was and is to hold 
back 
a 
tyrannical 
government. 
Chipman’s tyrannical reading of the 
Constitution would turn millions of 
Americans into criminals overnight. 
I am here to tell you today that 
these Americans who seek to defend 
their right to bear arms are not the 
criminals our Nation ought to be con-
cerned by. 
Mr. Speaker, the most dangerous 
threat to our safety and security does 
not arise from Americans wanting to 
protect themselves. No, it comes from 
men and women like those in this 
Chamber who would choose the quiet of 
servitude over the tumult of liberty. 
The Second Amendment was designed 
to protect the First, and this Nation 
will not give up its liberties so easily.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, even as we acknowledge 
the tragedy of over 600,000 deaths this 
pandemic has wrought on our country 
and the devastation it has caused 
around the world, help us to find the 
gift we are now being given: the oppor-
tunity to emerge, carefully, from the 
fear and anxiety COVID has imposed on 
our daily living and rediscover the im-
portance of our relationships one with 
another. 
What a joy it is to see someone else’s 
whole face, to look not just in their 
eyes but to be graced by their whole 
countenance. 
As we dare to unmask, may we dare 
also to reveal our hearts to one an-
other and rediscover the gift of being 
in fellowship. 
Even as we risk exposure to the en-
during dangers of our environment, 
may we also risk exposing ourselves to 
the challenge of frank and open, albeit 
respectful, interchange of ideas and di-
versity of thought. 
In sharing our heartfelt thoughts and 
opinions, may we also find ways to 
share care and concern with those 
whose perspectives are at times dras-
tically different from our own. 
May we, our faces, our whole selves, 
unhidden 
and 
unrestrained, 
reflect 
Your generosity, mercy, and love. 
Then reveal Yourself to us, in the 
face of those with whom we serve this 
day. 
In Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

HONORING UNITED STATES AIR 
FORCE THUNDERBIRDS 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the glorious Thunder-
birds of Nellis Air Force Base, who are 
celebrating 65 years in Las Vegas this 
month. 
Since their establishment, the Thun-
derbirds, America’s Ambassadors in 
Blue, have performed in front of mil-
lions worldwide, defying gravity with 
stunning aerobatics that showcase our 
military power and might. 
Their mission is to recruit, retain, 
and inspire. With each dazzling per-
formance, they rouse America’s future 
heroes to serve our Nation. 
Congratulations on 65 years, Thun-
derbirds. You are the pride of Nevada’s 
Fourth District and the pride of our 
Nation.

REMEMBERING COACH JOHN 
MCDONNELL 
(Mr. WOMACK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of a legend 
in Arkansas sports, the late Razorback 
track and field coach John McDonnell. 
Coach McDonnell was laid to rest 
last week, leaving a truly remarkable 
legacy: the most decorated coach in 
NCAA history, having won 40 national 
championships in indoor and outdoor 
track and cross country. He was the 
national coach of the year 30 times and 
is responsible for six NCAA triple 
crowns at Arkansas. 
He coached and mentored some of the 
world’s best athletes: Southwest Con-
ference 
champions, 
Southeast 
Con-
ference champions, NCAA champions, 
and Olympic champions. He himself 
was an outstanding runner, and he 
knew how to help his student-athletes 
become successful. 
Coach McDonnell was a native of Ire-
land. He came to the U.S., graduated 
from Southwest Louisiana, and earned 
his citizenship in 1969. 
He devoted his life to inspiring young 
people to excel. On the many occasions 
that I had a chance to visit with Coach 
McDonnell, I always came away thank-
ful that we in America were blessed to 
have him. 
When the starting gun fires and they 
are calling the Hogs on the track that 
bears his name, we will all be reminded 
of his legacy of good works and great 
coaching and his unrelenting Razor-
back spirit. 
My deepest condolences to his wife of 
more than 50 years, Ellen, children 
Sean and Heather, and the rest of the 
McDonnell family.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2754 
June 15, 2021 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on behalf of our Na-
tion’s veterans struggling with PTSD 
and their family members anxious for 
help. 
This week, I spoke with the mother 
of a young man who joined the Marines 
out of patriotic duty following 9/11. He 
served four tours. 
His mother told me that when he 
came home, he was a changed man 
struggling with PTSD. 
She took him to the VA when he said 
he was contemplating suicide. She was 
told all the beds were full; they 
couldn’t help. 
He was later denied extended treat-
ment at an inpatient facility after he 
began self-medicating. A year-and-a- 
half ago, he died of an overdose. 
We have to do better. The VA needs 
more and better addiction and mental 
health resources. This young man’s 
mother said to me, after losing her son, 
she is in the fight now. I am, too, and 
I hope you will join me.

ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
CONGRES-
SIONAL BASEBALL SHOOTING 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, 4 years ago yesterday, Repub-
licans were tragically attacked by a 
liberal gunman with an agenda to 
shoot and kill Republican Members of 
Congress. 
That day, United States Capitol Po-
lice Officers Griner and Bailey, along 
with Alexandria police, acted swiftly to 
neutralize the gunman and prevent 
what could have been an extraor-
dinarily deadly event that changed the 
course of our country. 
I stand here today because of their 
heroism, and I, along with my Repub-
lican colleagues present that morning, 
are forever grateful. 
We must always support our men and 
women in blue and oppose any efforts 
to defund the police and make commu-
nities less safe. 
Law enforcement officers go to work 
in their communities every day to 
make a difference, protect their neigh-
bors, and prevent crime, a solemn duty 
we should commend and not tear down. 
We will forever owe a debt of grati-
tude to the officers present 4 years ago 
and are grateful for every brave and 
honorable law enforcement officer who 
is willing to sacrifice themselves to 
keep us safe. 
In God we trust. 
f 
NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
CLEAN ENERGY 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today as Nevadans are facing 
the reality of our climate crisis head- 
on. 
Lake Mead has reached record low 
levels not seen since the construction 
of the Hoover Dam, and a massive heat 
wave has now brought record-breaking 
temperatures and safety warnings. 
We cannot deny the climate trajec-
tory our country faces, and at the same 
time, our State and the country are 
climbing out of an economic crisis. 
There is no question that the oppor-
tunity to take action on both the eco-
nomic and the climate crises is now. 
That is why I am proud to have 
joined my colleagues in the Problem 
Solvers Caucus to bring Democrats and 
Republicans together on an infrastruc-
ture proposal. 
We need to work together now more 
than 
ever. 
Our 
crumbling 
roads, 
bridges, and the tools that grind the 
gears of our day-to-day American life 
cannot support our economy and our 
planet without bold new investment. 
Those bold investments will create 
good-paying 
jobs 
in 
communities 
across the country. 
The time to deliver solutions is now.

CONGRATULATING GRACE CHRIS-
TIAN 
WARRIORS 
BASEBALL 
TEAM 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to recognize the Grace Christian 
School Warriors baseball team for 
their come-from-behind victory in this 
year’s Virginia Association of Chris-
tian Athletics State championship. 
Down to the last 12 outs, the War-
riors trailed 4–0. But thanks to some 
timely hits, their comeback started as 
they were able to put one run on the 
board in the fourth. 
In the bottom of the fifth, things 
really started turning in Grace Chris-
tian’s favor. A few hits, some heads-up 
base running, and costly errors made 
by their opponents gave the Warriors a 
5–4 lead. 
However, the lead didn’t last long, as 
the Bulldogs from Westover Christian 
Academy scored two in the top of the 
sixth. But the Warriors battled back, 
tying the game in the bottom half of 
the inning. 
Grace Christian’s MVP pitcher, Isa-
iah Riddle, mastered Westover hitters 
in the top of the seventh, meaning it 
all came down to the Warriors’ bats. 
First baseman Justin Hain led off 
with a base hit, then stole second, and 
moved to third on a wild pitch. With 
another wild pitch, Hain sprinted home 
and secured Grace Christian the title. 
Truly, it ain’t over till it’s over. 
Congratulations 
to 
the 
players, 
coaches, parents, and staff on an in-
credible season and a well-deserved 
win.

REMEMBERING DAVID SAMRICK 
(Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy 
heart that I rise to honor the remark-
able life of David Samrick of Fort Lau-
derdale, Florida. 
David’s faith and love for the Jewish 
community were evident in his support 
of the American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee. He served on the AIPAC 
national board since 2015, working 
closely with Members of the United 
States Congress to strengthen and pro-
mote a strong and unbreakable U.S.- 
Israel relationship. 
Through his work with AIPAC, he led 
citizen activists in building relation-
ships with Members of Congress on 
both sides of the aisle, a key to the 
success of the pro-Israel movement. We 
worked together to address a multitude 
of issues facing our community, from 
the scourge of anti-Semitism to ensur-
ing we maintain our strong U.S.-Israel 
relationship. 
I am proud to have considered him 
my very dear friend. I will miss his 
guidance and wisdom but mostly his 
friendship. 
My heartfelt sympathy goes out to 
his wife, Susan, and his entire family. 
David was one of a kind, a selfless, 
compassionate, and tireless advocate. 
May his memory be for a blessing.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD 
FURLONG 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Richard J. 
Furlong, a wonderful member of our 
community who passed away late last 
year. 
Mr. Furlong was born in 1926 in 
Utica, New York, my hometown. He 
grew up on the Seminole Farm in Hol-
land Patent. 
He was called to serve his country at 
the age of 19 when he enlisted in the 
United States Army during the World 
War II era. After he left service, he re-
turned home to Holland Patent. He 
would later go on to marry Neva 
Millias, who was his beloved wife of 37 
years. 
Mr. Furlong was a very proud son of 
Irish immigrants. He enjoyed sharing 
his heritage with those around him and 
made several visits to Ireland over the 
course of his life. 
Friends and family remember him as 
a jovial and hardworking man. Mr. 
Furlong was the oldest living member 
of The American Legion Leon R. Rob-
erts Post 161 and a past member and 
president of the Holland Patent Hose 
Company. 
He was beloved by his siblings, 12 
nieces and nephews, and many great- 
nieces and -nephews. I extend my con-
dolences to his family and also his 
great friends. 
Richard was larger than life, with a 
vibrant and fun personality. While we 
all miss him dearly, we will always re-
member his great legacy with a big 
smile.

HONORING PENNSYLVANIA’S 
FIFTH DISTRICT CLASS OF 2021 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate Pennsylvania’s 
Fifth District class of 2021 and wish 
them well in their next adventures. 
As we watched the world change be-
fore our eyes over the past year-and-a- 
half, we also saw the strength and de-
termination of young people in our dis-
trict, throughout the U.S., and across 
the globe. 
We saw students pick up jobs to help 
support their families, take to the 
streets to support causes they believed 
in deeply, and contribute their time 
and savings to help others in need. 
Whether they realized it or not, their 
energy and activism have shifted the 
national conversation around issues 
like gun violence, racial justice, and 
the climate crisis. 
We are at an inflection point of his-
tory, science, and technology, and I 
have never been more inspired or hope-
ful than I am for this generation. 
I also want to acknowledge our debt 
of gratitude to all the teachers and 
school staff who showed such dedica-
tion and resilience as they guided our 
students through the challenges of a 
pandemic with patience, courage, and 
innovation. 
Graduates, the world is waiting for 
our next wave of leaders, and we know 
that you are ready for the challenge. 
Congratulations.

ARVN DAY HONORS THE SERVICE 
OF VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Veterans of the Re-
public of Vietnam Armed Forces Day. 
June 19th is ARVN Day, which honors 
the service and sacrifice of the South 
Vietnamese soldiers who fought to de-
fend a free Vietnam. 
Thousands of South Vietnamese sol-
diers fought alongside our U.S. Armed 
Forces in the Vietnam war in defense 
of freedom and democracy. They de-
serve our appreciation and respect for 
their service. 
After the fall of Saigon, many who 
fought with the South Vietnamese 
forces fled Vietnam to escape tyranny. 
Many found a home here in the United 
States. Today, there are over 100,000 
veterans from the Republic of Vietnam 
living in California. 
On ARVN Day, we honor the sacrifice 
of those who served and remember 
those who paid the ultimate price in 
the pursuit of freedom. 
f 
STATEHOOD FOR THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, the 
D.C. statehood bill will receive a hear-
ing in the Senate, and I expect the date 
to be announced today. I appreciate 
that our D.C. statehood bill has al-
ready passed the House, and I thank 
the House. 
Our hearings and House passage have 
alerted Americans that the residents of 
their own Nation’s Capital do not have 
the same rights as other Americans. As 
a result, a detailed poll now shows that 
54 percent of the American people sup-
port D.C. statehood for the District of 
Columbia. 
As Americans who pay the highest 
Federal taxes per capita in the United 
States, D.C. residents say it is about 
time—indeed, well past time—for Con-
gress to grant statehood to the resi-
dents of the District of Columbia. 
f 
THE CALIFORNIA DROUGHT MUST 
BE ADDRESSED 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to share the disastrous con-
sequences of the House majority’s fail-
ure to address the California drought. 
As you can see in this photo, Califor-
nia’s water levels are dramatically low. 
This water is supposed to be up all the 
way at the tree line. The reservoirs are 
low at this point because of disastrous 
policies that force us to waste water 
during the wetter years. 
Countless communities are relying 
on this water. If this is what we are 
seeing in the beginning of the system 
in the north, how are we supposed to 
supply the entire State of California 
with enough clean water to survive? 
Across the State, communities rely 
on water supplied by the federally 
managed Central Valley Project. Last 
month the Bureau of Reclamation an-
nounced that Central Valley farmers 
would receive zero percent of their con-
tracts, effectively signing a death sen-
tence for their fields. 
Acres of half-grown crops meant to 
feed families across the Nation are 
being abandoned to dry up and die. 
Meanwhile, the majority refuses to 
even 
consider 
my 
legislation, 
the 
RENEW WIIN Act, which would help 
prevent this from happening again in 
the future. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to acknowledge the 
suffering of California families and get 
to work to help them. 
f 
WE MUST PROTECT THE SANCTITY 
OF LIFE 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to be a voice for the most inno-
cent and vulnerable among us. This 
Sunday many families, including mine, 
will celebrate Father’s Day. 
My faith and my family are the most 
important parts of my life, and I 
couldn’t be more grateful for my wife, 
Chelsea; and our two sons, Guy and 
Sam. Being the father of Guy and Sam 
has only intensified my belief that we 
must protect the sanctity of life. Our 
society cannot leave our most vulner-
able unprotected. 
Safeguarding the right to life has al-
ways been one of my top priorities, and 
I will continue working to protect life 
at every stage of development. 
As a Christian and a father, I will al-
ways fight for the right to life and for 
traditional family values. We must 
protect 
those 
who 
cannot 
protect 
themselves.

HONORING THE CAREER OF DR. 
ANNE SCHUCHAT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor CDC’s Principal Deputy Director 
Anne Schuchat for her outstanding ca-
reer in medicine and public health. 
Dr. Schuchat joined the CDC in 1988 
as an Epidemic Intelligence Service of-
ficer. Since joining the agency, she has 
served as chief of the Respiratory Dis-
eases Branch, director of the National 
Center For Immunization and Res-
piratory Diseases and as acting CDC di-
rector twice. 
Her contributions have been recog-
nized by an election to the National 
Academy of Medicine, and she has re-
ceived the United States Public Health 
Service’s Distinguished Service Medal 
and the Association of State and Terri-
torial 
Health 
Officials 
Lifetime 
Achievement 
Award, 
among 
many 
other awards and recognitions. 
Dr. Schuchat has dedicated her life 
to improving public health around the 
world and has inspired many young 
women to go into medicine and public 
health. 
As a lifelong healthcare professional, 
I congratulate Dr. Schuchat on her re-
tirement and commend her for her hard 
work over the past 33 years.

born and raised on a farm in Mahaska 
County, Iowa, and is the oldest of five 
siblings. 
In the 1930s many children who were 
raised on farms elected not to attend 
high school, but Clarissa was inspired 
by her aunt to not only attend high 
school but to continue her education 
through courses at William Penn Uni-
versity, which is still in Oskaloosa 
today. 
In the early 1940s, her love for chil-
dren and teaching led her to pursue a 
career in education at Bryan County 
school, a small school south of New 
Sharon. 
On August 14, 1945, Clarissa married 
her husband, Gerald, and together they 
had six children: Allan, Calvin, Nor-
man, Kathleen, David, and Ken, who is 
a State senator and my colleague in 
the State senate in Iowa. 
Clarissa, I wish you all the joy in the 
world as you celebrate this with your 
loved ones.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I will include in the 
RECORD a letter from Chairman JOHN 
YARMUTH of the House Committee on 
Budget agreeing to waive consideration 
of H.R. 610, as amended, as well as 
Chair DEFAZIO’s response to Mr. YAR-
MUTH expressing appreciation for his 
willingness to work cooperatively on 
this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter from Midpeninsula Re-
gional Open Space District in support 
of H.R. 610. 
MIDPENINSULA REGIONAL 
OPEN SPACE DISTRICT, 
Los Altos, CA, June 10, 2021. 
Re H.R. 610—San Francisco Bay Restoration 
Act—SUPPORT. 
Hon. JACKIE SPEIER, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE SPEIER: On behalf of 
the Board of Directors of the Midpeninsula 
Regional Open Space District (Midpen), I 
write to express our support for your legisla-
tion, H.R. 610, the San Francisco Bay Res-
toration Act. Comprised of over 65,000 acres 
of acquired and protected open space on the 
San Francisco Peninsula, Midpen is one of 
the largest regional open space districts in 
California. Our braided mission is to acquire 
and preserve in perpetuity open space and 
agricultural land of regional significance, to 
protect and restore the natural environment, 
to preserve rural character and encourage 
viable agricultural use of land resources, and 
to provide opportunities for ecologically sen-
sitive public enjoyment and education. 
As 
you 
know, 
the 
legislation 
would 
prioritize funding for the San Francisco Bay, 
a vital resource to our District, the regional 
community, and the entire state of Cali-
fornia. The $250 million authorized in the bill 
would provide critical federal investment to 
restoring the Bay’s wetlands and estuaries, 
assist in the recovery of endangered species, 
and help to alleviate the impacts of climate 
change. We greatly appreciate the legisla-
tion’s establishment of this federal partner-
ship to improve the Bay Area and protect 
our coastal community and economy. 
For these reasons, the Midpeninsula Re-
gional Open Space District greatly supports 
the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act (H.R. 
610). Thank you for your leadership and con-
tinued work on improving the Bay Area. If 
you have any questions or would like to fur-
ther discuss our support, please do not hesi-
tate to contact us. 
Sincerely, 
ANA M. RUIZ, 
General Manager. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 610. This legislation 
would create a stand-alone program for 
the San Francisco Bay within the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, in 
essence elevating restoration efforts of 
a water body that has been part of the 
national estuary program since 1993. 
This legislation responds to an Au-
gust 2018 Government Accountability 
Office report that found a centralized 
program would improve the existing ef-
forts to restore and protect the San 
Francisco Bay. 
This legislation would authorize $25 
million annually for fiscal year 2022 
through 2026, with a cap on Federal 
funding for eligible projects and a cap 
on administrative expenses. H.R. 610 is 
supported 
by 
the 
delegation 
rep-
resenting the bay and surrounding 
area, including our committee col-
leagues 
JARED
HUFFMAN, 
MARK 
DESAULNIER, and JOHN GARAMENDI. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
610, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.

Hon. JOHN YARMUTH: 
Chair, Committee on the Budget, House of Rep-
resentatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. YARMUTH: Thank you for your 
letter regarding H.R 610, the San Francisco 
Bay Restoration Act. I appreciate your deci-
sion to waive formal consideration of the 
bill. 
I agree that the Committee on the Budget 
has valid jurisdictional claims to certain 
provisions in this important legislation, and 
I further agree that by forgoing formal con-
sideration of the bill, the Committee on the 
Budget is not waiving any jurisdiction over 
any relevant subject matter. Additionally, if 
requested I will support the appointment of 
conferees from the Committee on the Budget 
should a House-Senate conference be con-
vened on this legislation. Finally, this ex-
change of letters will be included in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD when the bill is consid-
ered on the floor. 
Thank you again, and I look forward to 
continuing to work collaboratively with the 
Committee on the Budget on this important 
issue.

Chair. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, May 27, 2021. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair, Committee on Transportation & Infra-
structure, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR DEFAZIO: I write to confirm 
our mutual understanding regarding H.R. 
610, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act. 
H.R. 610 contains provisions that fall within 
the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on 
the Budget. However, the committee agrees 
to waive formal consideration of the bill. 
The Committee on the Budget takes this 
action with the mutual understanding that 
we do not waive any jurisdiction over the 
subject matter contained in this or similar 
legislation, and the committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as the bill or 
similar legislation moves forward so that we 
may address any remaining issues within our 
jurisdiction. The committee also reserves 
the right to seek appointment to any House- 
Senate conference convened on this legisla-
tion or similar legislation and requests your 
support if such a request is made. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding, 
and I ask that a copy of our exchange of let-
ters on this matter be included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration 
of the bill. I look forward to continuing to 
work with you as this measure moves 
through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Last Congress we worked together to 
ensure bipartisan support for several 
regional water bills, including this one. 
H.R. 610 codifies the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s existing restora-
tion work in the San Francisco Bay es-
tuary and establishes a San Francisco 
Bay program office. 
I urge support of this legislation and 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, this 
bill is something I have been working 
on for 10 years and have introduced in 
every Congress since I came to Con-
gress. It provides $25 million a year for 
5 years. 
Over the last 200 years, 90 percent of 
the bay wetlands have disappeared. 
They are gone. What is even worse is 
that in less than 9 years, sea level rise 
in that region will effectively drown 
out all of the marshes. The damage will 
be irreversible. 
Over the last 8 years the EPA has in-
vested only $45 million in San Fran-
cisco Bay. However, even though it is 
the largest estuary on the West Coast, 
Puget Sound received more than $260 
million and the Chesapeake Bay re-
ceived $490 million. That is an unbe-
lievable difference in funding opportu-
nities. 
We can’t afford to keep pushing this 
off. The San Francisco Bay supports 4 
million jobs and provides 20 million 
Californians with clean drinking water. 
It is the lifeblood of the region and a 
worthy investment of taxpayer dollars. 
Every dollar spent on restoration ef-
forts generates $2.10 in economic activ-
ity. More funding for the bay is a win- 
win. It would, in fact, be the right 
thing to do, the only fair thing to do 
considering how much more has been 
spent on other estuaries. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1230 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship and recognition on this important 
issue. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this legislation. 
I am so proud of Representative 
JACKIE SPEIER, with whom I have the 
privilege of corepresenting San Fran-
cisco. JACKIE
SPEIER
has been our 
champion on San Francisco Bay, and 
this San Francisco Bay Restoration 
Act is a vital step to restoring our 
cherished bay. 
It is an honor to be joined in this leg-
islation with other bay area colleagues,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2758 
June 15, 2021 
FEINSTEIN and ALEX PADILLA, who have 
introduced a Senate companion bill. 
Madam Speaker, Members may not 
know, but the San Francisco Bay is an 
icon of California and a national treas-
ure: inspiring us with its beauty and its 
might, enriching our lives with world- 
class recreation, tourism, and jobs. 
The bay area delta, of which it is a 
part, is also the economic lifeblood of 
our coast, contributing over $370 bil-
lion to our economy each year and sup-
porting more than four million jobs. 
As part of the bay-delta estuary, it is 
a vital part of public health, providing 
drinking water for millions of Califor-
nians, a key force in combating the cli-
mate crisis. 
But, for centuries, this magnificent 
estuary has been overexploited and 
underprotected. Today, 90 percent of 
the bay area’s wetlands have been de-
stroyed, undermining the strength of 
our coastal economies and commu-
nities. 
The San Francisco Bay Restoration 
Act—sponsored 
and 
championed 
by 
Congresswoman JACKIE
SPEIER
over 
many years—would make a long over-
due $125 million investment in restora-
tion efforts. It improves coordination 
from San Francisco to Washington, as 
it revives our wetlands to protect our 
coastal communities, improves our 
water quality, strengthens our climate 
resilience, including by combating sea 
level rise. 
In 2018, the GAO concluded that a 
centralized initiative providing im-
proved coordination and communica-
tion across efforts, along with dedi-
cated Federal funding, would be the 
best chance for long-term restoration 
and protection of this vital geographic 
area on the West Coast. And this bill 
introduced by Congresswoman JACKIE 
SPEIER provides exactly that. 
Californians have fought to increase 
appropriations for the bay area for 
years, and we are grateful for the sup-
port of then-chair Nita Lowey of the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
and 
the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies, 
BETTY MCCOLLUM. We secured an in-
crease of $3 million in funding for the 
bay. 
Last year, with the support of Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
chair 
PETER DEFAZIO and, hence, the com-
mittee of Congresswoman ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON, and Water Resources 
and Environment Subcommittee chair 
GRACE NAPOLITANO, the House passed 
this Bay Restoration Act by a voice 
vote, and then again as part of our in-
frastructure bill, H.R. 2, the Moving 
Forward Act. Now we want to make it 
the law of the land. 
Our communities and our lives are 
heavily enriched by the bay-delta estu-
ary. This investment is an economic, 
health, environmental, and moral im-
perative. 
I urge Members to support it with 
strong bipartisan support, and I hope 
that it will be bipartisan on the part of 
our colleagues on the West Coast, who 
know the value of the quality of life 
that the bay estuary project brings to 
us. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, I urge support of this bipar-
tisan legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 610, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

NATIONAL CHILDREN’S MUSEUM 
ACT 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1703) to amend title 40, 
United States Code, to require the Ad-
ministrator of General Services to 
enter into a cooperative agreement 
with the National Children’s Museum 
to provide the National Children’s Mu-
seum rental space without charge in 
the Ronald Reagan Building and Inter-
national Trade Center, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1703 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Children’s Museum Act’’. 
SEC. 2. NATIONAL CHILDREN’S MUSEUM. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the Museum and Library Services Act 
of 2003 (Public Law 108–81) designated the 
Capital Children’s Museum, the predecessor 
to the National Children’s Museum, as the 
‘‘National Children’s Museum’’;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2759 
June 15, 2021 
This bipartisan, bicameral bill, which 
I introduced with Republican RODNEY 
DAVIS of Illinois and which has been in-
troduced in the Senate by Democrat 
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of Maryland and Re-
publican SHELLEY
MOORE
CAPITO
of 
West Virginia would require the Gen-
eral Services Administration to enter 
into a cooperative agreement with the 
National Children’s Museum, a con-
gressionally designated museum, to 
allow the museum to remain in the 
Ronald Reagan Building and Inter-
national Trade Center, a Federally 
owned building in the Nation’s capital 
without charge for the duration of its 
existing lease. 
The National Building Museum oper-
ates under such an agreement. The Na-
tional Children’s Museum is the only 
congressionally designated museum re-
quired to pay rent in a Federal build-
ing. 
Originally named the Capital Chil-
dren’s Museum, the museum was a sta-
ple in D.C. for decades. The museum 
opened in 1974 in a former convent on H 
Street Northeast. In 2003, Congress rec-
ognized the immense value of having a 
children’s museum in the Nation’s cap-
ital and officially designated the mu-
seum as the National Children’s Mu-
seum. 
After being closed for several years, 
the museum reopened last year in the 
Ronald Reagan Building and Inter-
national Trade Center in downtown 
D.C. where it immediately attracted 
visitors from throughout the Nation’s 
capital and the entire Nation. However, 
only 18 days later, the coronavirus pan-
demic forced the museum to close its 
physical space. 
Still, the museum continued to offer 
valuable online resources to our chil-
dren as they navigated new, chal-
lenging learning circumstances, includ-
ing over 75 at-home experiment and 
project video programs and monthly 
podcasts. 
The 
museum 
has 
served 
teachers in 45 States and the District 
through its virtual field trips since the 
pandemic began. However, due to rev-
enue losses during the pandemic and 
other costs, the museum has said it 
will close permanently without enact-
ment of this bill. 
This bill would allow the National 
Children’s Museum to continue to ben-
efit the millions who visit and live in 
the Nation’s capital and the national 
capital region. 
Madam Speaker, I support this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I am pleased to lead this effort with 
my good friend and colleague, the chair 
of the Highways and Transit Sub-
committee, Ms. NORTON. 
As Congresswoman NORTON said, this 
important legislation directs the Gen-
eral Services Administration to pro-
vide rent relief to the National Chil-
dren’s 
Museum 
that 
is 
currently 
housed in the Ronald Reagan Building 
and International Trade Center right 
here in Washington, D.C. 
Currently, the museum is the only 
federally designated museum sitting in 
a Federal building that is required to 
pay rent. This bill will give the mu-
seum the same benefits afforded to 
other congressionally designated muse-
ums. 
Prepandemic, the museum offered 
our children the ability to interact 
with exhibits that were focused on 
science, technology, engineering, arts, 
and math. And that allowed children to 
foster a greater appreciation for our 
STEM fields. 
As our country reopens and we look 
to the future, the museum will con-
tinue to build off that success and be-
come even more valuable of a resource 
for our youth. In that spirit, I actually 
look forward to visiting with some of 
my colleagues soon and talking about 
this important bill. It is just frus-
trating that it is the only museum that 
is congressionally directed that has to 
pay another government agency, the 
GSA, for rent when they weren’t al-
lowed to be open. 
So this is a commonsense bill. It has 
been great to work with Congress-
woman NORTON, and I support this leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the remarks of my good 
friend, Mr. DAVIS, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. NORTON 
for her cooperation on this. It is great 
to be back on the floor and see every-
body. I enjoy this greatly. I certainly 
hope everybody supports this common-
sense bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, like 
my friend, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1703, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter from the city of San 
Diego in support of H.R. 587. 
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO, 
San Diego, CA, June 14, 2021. 
Hon. SCOTT PETERS, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN PETERS: On behalf of 
the City of San Diego, I am writing to you in 
support of the Ocean Pollution Reduction 
Act II (OPRA II) H.R. 587. 
OPRA II is the product of a decades-long 
regional collaboration and will deploy ad-
vanced technology to purify recycled water. 
Additionally, this legislation is critical to 
implementing the comprehensive Pure Water 
San Diego program, which will provide a re-
liable, sustainable source of drinking water 
while simultaneously reducing treated dis-
charge to the ocean by nearly 50 percent. 
This bill delivers certainty and provides a 
more streamlined process to comply with 
regulations, provided the City meets strin-
gent water recycling milestones. 
Under OPRA II, the City of San Diego must 
demonstrate that its Pure Water program is 
able to produce 83 million gallons of water a 
day, nearly one-half of the City’s water sup-
ply demand by 2036. Over the same period, 
the program is expected to reduce treated 
discharge from the Point Loma Wastewater 
Treatment Plant, which will be continuously 
monitored and subjected to ongoing research 
efforts by academic, local, state, and na-
tional entities. 
The City of San Diego is grateful for your 
leadership on this important legislative ef-
fort. 
Sincerely, 
TODD GLORIA, 
Mayor, 
City of San Diego. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 587. The legislation, 
introduced by Representative SCOTT 
PETERS, clarifies that the city of San 
Diego, California, can utilize the stand-
ard Clean Water Act National Pollu-
tion Discharge Elimination System 
permit process to continue operation of 
the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment 
Plant with alternative standards. 
The legislation, which provides regu-
latory accountability and consistency 
to the city, has the support of sur-
rounding localities, local public works 
departments and water districts, as 
well as local nongovernmental and en-
vironmental organizations. 
Currently, the Point Loma Waste-
water Treatment Plant applies for and 
receives a waiver under the Clean 
Water Act to discharge wastewater 
with less than full secondary treat-
ment, the baseline requirement of the 
Clean Water Act. The facility qualifies 
for the waiver by meeting certain cri-
teria and must renew its application 
every 5 years. 
As part of a long-term effort, the 
Point Loma Wastewater Treatment 
Plant is working to reduce its dis-
charges to coastal waters. This effort 
involves water recycling and will redi-
rect a portion of the facility’s dis-
charge. However, the facility’s dis-
charges to coastal waters will never be 
eliminated. 
To be clear, this legislation is not a 
waiver of all the requirements of the 
Clean Water Act, and the facility will 
need to comply with the other require-
ments of the act. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 587, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 587, introduced 
by Congressman PETERS
from Cali-
fornia and others from his home State, 
is a bipartisan bill that aims to make 
permanent 
a 
regulatory 
exemption 
under the Clean Water Act. This ex-
emption 
allows 
certain 
wastewater 
treatment facilities seeking to dis-
charge to the ocean to apply for permit 
modifications that offer alternatives to 
the Clean Water Act’s secondary treat-
ment standards. 
These alternative standards must be 
met every 5 years during the normal 
permit renewal period. This permit re-
newal process is lengthy, complex, and 
costly. 
The city of San Diego’s Point Loma 
Wastewater Treatment Plant has been 
operating under this regulatory exemp-
tion for well over two decades. 
The objectives of this bill are worthy 
and a win-win for the city and the envi-
ronment. 
Madam Speaker, the bill will help en-
sure that San Diego has long-term cer-
tainty for its water supply and will 
save the city millions of dollars and 
protect regional ratepayers from bil-
lions in new costs by providing this 
regulatory certainty while preserving 
applicable standards. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
PETERS). 
Mr. PETERS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I introduced the 
Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II, or 
OPRA II, for three reasons: one, to en-
sure that the Point Loma Wastewater 
Treatment Plant’s waiver process is 
fair and efficient; two, to further re-
duce the facility’s pollution output to 
the ocean; and three, to increase our 
region’s freshwater supply. 
The city’s proposed wastewater recy-
cling plan, the Pure Water Program, 
will guarantee the region’s water secu-
rity and further reduce the amount of 
wastewater that flows into the ocean 
from the plant. 
OPRA II requires that the city of San 
Diego 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
Pure 
Water Program can produce 83 million 
gallons of freshwater a day by 2036. 
This is an estimated one-third of the 
entire city’s drinking water needs. 
Over the same period, the program is 
expected to reduce treated wastewater 
flows from the Point Loma plant by 
over 100 million gallons. 
This bill replaces the complex and 
expensive secondary treatment waiver 
application with a simpler process, as 
long as the city meets stringent water 
recycling milestones. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 587 would sup-
port the water recycling and conserva-
tion efforts of the city of San Diego’s 
Point Loma Wastewater Treatment 
Plant by making permanent its long-
standing regulatory exemption under 
the Clean Water Act. 
Madam Speaker, this is a good bill, 
and I urge support of this bipartisan 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. ROUZER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1144, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1144. The bill establishes a new re-
gional program within the U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency to ad-
dress water pollution concerns in the 
Puget Sound and authorizes $50 million 
annually for fiscal years 2022 through 
2026. 
The Puget Sound has seen significant 
degradation of water quality and habi-
tat as a result of human development. 
This legislation builds on the successes 
Puget Sound has seen while part of the 
National Estuary Program and incor-
porates the recommendations of a July 
2018 report of the U.S. Government Ac-
countability Office on the Federal and 
State efforts to restore the Sound. 
This legislation is vitally important 
to ensure long-term health of a water-
shed that helps provide food, water, 
and other ecosystem services for 4.5 
million people and contributes to the 
State’s economy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1144, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
H.R. 
1144, 
the 
PUGET SOS Act, codifies the Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s existing 
restoration work in the Puget Sound 
and establishes a Puget Sound program 
office. 
Puget Sound was one of the first es-
tuaries designated within the National 
Estuary Program in 1987, and EPA has 
worked with Federal and non-Federal 
entities to coordinate restoration ef-
forts. This bill ensures this important 
work will continue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

June 15, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to rise in support of the Pro-
moting United Government Efforts to 
Save Our Sound Act, or the PUGET 
SOS Act, and I thank my good friend 
and colleague, Representative STRICK-
LAND, for her partnership on this im-
portant legislation. 
Madam Speaker, those of us who are 
lucky to call the better Washington 
home know that Puget Sound is our 
most iconic body of water. Generations 
of our friends and neighbors have built 
their lives and earned their livelihoods 
on the Sound. 
We know the Puget Sound is critical 
to the environmental and economic fu-
ture of our region. And some of our re-
gion’s most iconic species, including 
salmon, orca, and Dungeness crab, rely 
on a healthy Puget Sound. 
But despite years of efforts to protect 
and restore Puget Sound, we still have 
a lot of work to do to address the sig-
nificant challenges, including storm 
water runoff, habitat loss, and harmful 
algal blooms, that continue to threaten 
this crown jewel of our region’s iden-
tity and economy. 
That is why I am proud to see the 
House advance this critical bill, which 
will finally bring to bear the coordi-
nated Federal resources necessary to 
save our Sound. If we are going to re-
cover our salmon and orca populations, 
if we are going to ensure future genera-
tions can dig for clams, if we are going 
to respect and uphold Tribal treaty 
rights, we need the Federal Govern-
ment to step up and support the work 
already being done by the State, 
Tribes, local communities, and busi-
nesses that all depend on a vibrant and 
healthy Puget Sound. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud that this 
bill represents meaningful progress to-
ward these goals. If future generations, 
including my two kiddos, are going to 
have the opportunities to enjoy these 
treasures and to build their livelihoods 
in our region, we have to act now to 
protect and restore the Sound. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this critical bill. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. STRICKLAND). 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 1144, the 
PUGET SOS Act, which I am honored 
to co-lead with Congressman KILMER, 
who I thank for working on this bill 
over the years. I also thank the Puget 
Sound Partnership and Northwest In-
dian Fisheries Commission for all their 
help. I am proud to work with you to 
restore Puget Sound. 
Madam Speaker, as a western Wash-
ington native, I know how critical the 
health of the Puget Sound is to our re-
gion—economically, culturally, and en-
vironmentally. 
The Sound is an economic engine cre-
ating over $30 billion in economic ac-
tivity and supporting nearly 150,000 
jobs. It is a biodiversity hotspot, home 
to over 7,000 different species, including 
200 different types of fish. It is a sacred 
resource for Tribal nations throughout 
the region who rely on the flora and 
fauna the Sound supports for their 
lives and livelihoods. And it is a cul-
tural treasure, with the salmon, shell-
fish, orca, and others which live in the 
ecosystem, that is fundamental to the 
history and identity of the Pacific 
Northwest. 
For years, this ecosystem has been 
on the brink of danger, and we are at a 
tipping point. As the human population 
continues to grow significantly, the 
risks and strain on Puget Sound inten-
sify. 
This legislation takes much-needed, 
timely steps to secure the health of the 
Puget Sound now and into the future 
by establishing a dedicated program of-
fice within the EPA and codifying the 
Puget Sound Federal Task Force. To-
gether, these groups will develop a Fed-
eral action plan to preserve and restore 
this most critical national maritime 
treasure. 
Washingtonians view and use Puget 
Sound the way Marylanders view the 
Chesapeake Bay and how Michiganders 
view the Great Lakes. It is well past 
time the Federal Government does as 
well. 
If we really want to make an impact, 
and support hundreds of thousands of 
jobs while trying to save orcas and 
salmon, we must act now. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1300 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the Puget Sound 
watershed has long provided food, clean 
water, and other ecosystem benefits for 
4.5 million people and a wide variety of 
species as well. The region is essential 
to the State’s economy. Human devel-
opment and other actions have de-
graded the water quality and habitat of 
the Sound, including that of critical 
species like salmon and orca whales. 
The Puget Sound was deemed an Es-
tuary of National Significance in 1988, 
and in 2018, GAO determined that fur-
ther investment and a program with 
clear leadership and coordination of 
objectives is crucial to achieving the 
long-term restoration and protection 
goals of this diverse and dynamic eco-
system. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Mrs. RODGERS), the ranking member 
on the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding, and I want to also 
thank my colleague from Washington 
State (Mr. KILMER) for his attention to 
the Puget Sound, and his commitment 
to putting us on a better path. 
The Puget Sound is in crisis. The 
salmon in Puget Sound, the salmon 
that are most crucial to the orcas, are 
in crisis. You can see right here; this is 
the State of Salmon report. This is the 
graphic Washington State of Salmon 
report, and it says that the Puget 
Sound 
Chinook, 
the 
Puget 
Sound 
steelhead—over here—are in crisis. 
And I might just point out, the 
Snake River Chinook are actually ap-
proaching 
goal. 
The 
Snake 
River 
steelhead are making progress. It is 
part of the reason that I believe the 
Puget Sound SOS Act is so important, 
to bring much needed oversight and en-
forcement of Federal pollution stand-
ards in Puget Sound. But we must do 
more. 
Despite NOAA’s research indicating 
that these salmon stocks are the most 
critical to our orcas, the State of 
Washington continues to allow out-
dated sewage treatment plants to ille-
gally dump raw sewage into the Sound, 
creating conditions that are literally 
suffocating the salmon. 
Over the years, 80 sewage treatment 
plants have illegally dumped toxins 
into the Sound, and now the Wash-
ington State Department of Ecology is 
considering permits to allow 58 plants 
to continue poisoning the water. It is 
unacceptable. 
By establishing a Puget Sound Re-
covery National Program Office, I hope 
this bill will finally push the EPA to 
hold the State of Washington account-
able for the damage that unchecked 
pollution in the Sound is doing for our 
endangered salmon and orcas. 
It is also critically important that 
we stop this pollution at its source so 
that the money we are authorizing for 
the Puget Sound Recovery Act is actu-
ally effective. 
Madam Speaker, I am urging leader-
ship in my State, stop the sewage, save 
our Sound, save our salmon, save our 
orcas. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, H.R. 1144 would continue the 
EPA’s management of a competitive 
grant program to support projects that 
protect and restore the Puget Sound. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1144, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays.

June 15, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

LOCAL WATER PROTECTION ACT 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2008) to amend the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act to reau-
thorize certain programs relating to 
nonpoint source management, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2008 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Local Water 
Protection Act’’. 
SEC. 2. NONPOINT SOURCE MANAGEMENT PRO-
GRAMS. 
Section 319(j) of the Federal Water Pollu-
tion Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1329(j)) is amend-
ed by striking ‘‘subsections (h) and (i) not to 
exceed’’ and all that follows through ‘‘fiscal 
year 1991’’ and inserting ‘‘subsections (h) and 
(i) $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 
through 2026’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. ROUZER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2008. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2008. H.R. 2008 is a bipartisan bill 
to reauthorize appropriations for the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s 
Nonpoint 
Source 
Management 
grants program. I would like to thank 
my colleagues, Ms. CRAIG from Min-
nesota and Mr. MAST from Florida, for 
introducing this bill. 
Nonpoint sources of water pollution 
come from many diffuse sources, in-
cluding runoff from farms, managed 
forests, and urban areas. This runoff 
can carry pollutants, such as fertilizers 
and sediment from fields and lawns, 
toxins from abandoned mines, and oils 
and heavy metals from roads into 
lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water. 
Nationally, some 55 percent of assessed 
rivers and streams currently do not 
meet State water quality standards. 
The Clean Water Act was enacted in 
1972 to restore and maintain the chem-
ical, physical, and biological integrity 
of the Nation’s waters. In 1987, the 
Clean Water Act was amended to add 
section 319 to create a non-regulatory 
program through which EPA admin-
isters annual grants to help States de-
velop and implement their own pro-
grams for managing nonpoint sources 
of water pollution. 
Under EPA’s 319 program, States re-
tain the primary role for addressing 
nonpoint source water pollution, which 
they do largely through voluntary 
means and financial incentives. How-
ever, according to the General Ac-
counting Office, the extent of the 
available incentives has declined in re-
cent years, as grants to States under 
the section 319 program have declined 
by more than 30 percent from a high of 
about $240 million annually in fiscal 
year 2004. 
The section 319 program was initially 
authorized at $70 million annually in 
fiscal year 1988, and its authorization 
level steadily increased to $130 million 
in fiscal year 1991, the last year of au-
thorization for this program. 
Since that time, the section 319 pro-
gram has continued to receive funds 
through the annual appropriation for 
EPA. In fiscal year 2021, the section 319 
program received a Federal appropria-
tion of $177 million, and the President’s 
fiscal year 2022 budget request proposes 
an increase in funding for the program 
to $180 million. 
H.R. 2008 would authorize $200 mil-
lion annually for the section 319 pro-
gram through 2026. This would be a 
modest increase of the current appro-
priated level for this popular program, 
but less than the historic peak appro-
priation for this program in the early 
2000s. 
Again, I thank Ms. CRAIG and Mr. 
MAST for leading this bipartisan bill. 
This legislation passed out of com-
mittee with bipartisan support and is a 
good bill for a valuable program. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2008 reauthor-
izes 
the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency’s section 319 Nonpoint Source 
Pollution Control program under the 
Clean Water Act. 
Reauthorizing 
this 
program 
rein-
forces the Federal leadership that helps 
our State and local partners in their ef-
forts to control nonpoint source pollu-
tion. 
For example, my home State of 
North Carolina typically receives $1 
million for competitive grant funding 
for 
watershed 
restoration 
projects. 
This money is put to good use con-
ducting watershed restoration projects 
like stormwater and agricultural best 
management practices and restoration 
of 
impaired 
streams 
affected 
by 
nonpoint source pollution. 
In my district, some of these grant 
funds 
are 
being 
used 
to 
reduce 
stormwater runoff volume on the cam-
pus of UNC-Wilmington. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. 
CRAIG). 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2008, the Local Water 
Protection Act. 
Madam Speaker, in the Land of 10,000 
Lakes, we take water quality very seri-
ously. Not only are our lakes and wa-
terways critical for transporting agri-
culture goods, but they are at the core 
of Minnesota’s natural beauty and 
tourism economy. 
That is why I was so proud to intro-
duce the bipartisan Local Water Pro-
tection Act to reauthorize funding for 
pollution mitigation efforts in our 
communities. 
From 1987 to 1991, Congress author-
ized funds each year for the Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s Nonpoint 
Source Management grants program, 
which provides grants to State and 
local governments to reduce water pol-
lution. 
Our Local Water Protection Act 
would reauthorize funding for this im-
portant task with $200 million annually 
to help protect our lakes, rivers, and 
streams, and protect them for future 
generations. 
This program would give State and 
local governments the authority to 
create locally-focused, voluntary con-
servation programs that are tailor- 
made for their own communities. And 
recent history in my home district 
demonstrates that these programs are 
incredibly effective. 
In fact, the Goodhue County Soil and 
Water Conservation District is cur-
rently working to reduce pollutants in 
the Mississippi River-Lake Pepin wa-
tershed by 20 percent. And I would add, 
I was out there on Lake Pepin just this 
last weekend with some great folks. 
In Wabasha County, these projects 
provided low-interest loans to improve 
residential 
infrastructure 
and 
help 
farmers come into compliance with 
pollution standards. 
And the South Washington Water-
shed District integrated a stormwater 
reuse plan that is estimated to reduce 
potable water usage by more than 40 
million gallons annually. There is no 
doubt that these programs can be effec-
tive, and there is no good reason why 
we shouldn’t prioritize them. 
As we look toward preserving our en-
vironment, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan legislation, and 
I thank my colleague, the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. MAST) for intro-
ducing the bill with me. 
Madam Speaker, thank you so much, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
this piece of legislation. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1921. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1921. This legislation reauthorizes 
the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restora-
tion Program for 5 years at $20 million 
annually and provides for regular re-
porting on the progress of the program. 
Some 2.1 million people live in the 
area surrounding Lake Pontchartrain, 
which is threatened by pollution re-
lated to urban and agricultural runoff, 
sewage overflows, and nonpoint source 
pollution. The Basin Restoration Pro-
gram helps address these environ-
mental challenges in a nonregulatory 
fashion and has made some progress. 
With continued funding and reauthor-
ization, the program can continue im-
plementing projects related to restora-
tion. 
During 
a 
Water 
Resources 
Sub-
committee hearing last Congress, some 
implementation issues related to this 
program 
were 
identified. 
Ranking 
Member GRAVES and Chair DEFAZIO re-
quested that the U.S. Government Ac-
countability Office study the program 
implementation; however, those issues 
should not prevent us from acting on 
this bill today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1921, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1921, the Pro-
tect and Restore Lake Pontchartrain 
Basin Act, introduced by my friend 
GARRET GRAVES from Louisiana, would 
reauthorize the Lake Pontchartrain 
Basin Restoration Program to provide 
assistance to the Federal, State, and 
local watershed partners in addressing 
the water quality challenges that are 
in this especially sensitive area. 
I support the critical work these 
partners are doing to help restore the 
water quality of the lake, and this bill 
will help continue this work. 
I commend Aviation Subcommittee 
Ranking Member GARRET GRAVES for 
his leadership on this issue, and I urge 
support of this legislation. I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES), who is the Aviation Sub-
committee ranking member. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the 
opportunity to talk about this impor-
tant legislation. 
Before I get started, I do want to 
thank the chair of the subcommittee, 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO; the ranking member, 
Mr. 
ROUZER
from 
North 
Carolina; 
Chairman DEFAZIO; and Ranking Mem-
ber SAM GRAVES as well. I do want to 
thank some of the other partners from 
Louisiana we worked with, Congress-
man STEVE SCALISE, former Congress-
man Cedric Richmond, and Congress-
man TROY
CARTER, who all worked 
with us on this important legislation. 
Madam Speaker, Lake Pontchartrain 
is one of the largest saltwater lakes in 
the United States. It is incredibly pro-
ductive. It is a productive ecosystem. 
There is much fishing, shrimping, and 
crabbing and oysters that are produced 
there. As a matter of fact, since 1997, 
over 40 million pounds of blue crabs 
have been produced almost annually. 
The secret, Madam Speaker, if you 
can keep this between the two of us, is 
that much of that is actually headed to 
Maryland 
restaurants 
to 
improve 
Maryland crab cakes. That is right. 
Just don’t tell anybody. They also put 
spice on the outside of the shells. It is 
really confusing what they do. The 
meat is on the inside. 
But in any case, Madam Speaker, 
this is a huge watershed. It is about a 
10,000-square-mile watershed, that com-
prises 16 parishes and four Mississippi 
counties, into this lake. 
But more importantly, and why there 
is a Federal nexus here, is that, since 
the first time in 1937, they open the 
nearly 7,000-acre Bonnet Carre Spill-
way to shift water from the Mississippi 
River into Lake Pontchartrain and ul-
timately to the Gulf of Mexico as an 
emergency pressure relief valve. You 
see, Madam Speaker, the Mississippi 
River drains 32 States and two Cana-
dian provinces. This is one of the larg-
est watersheds in the world, and the 
Mississippi River is the largest water-
shed in the United States. 
When the water hits a certain level— 
again, since 1937, when they began 
opening this, and it has been opened an

average of once every 10 years—it sends 
huge flows, hundreds of thousands of 
cubic feet of water per second, out of 
the Mississippi River into the Bonnet 
Carre Spillway and into Lake Pont-
chartrain, and it shifts from a salt or a 
brackish lake into a freshwater lake 
because of this huge surge. 
As a result of the floodwaters coming 
from Canada and all over the United 
States, they come and impact the eco-
system of this lake. 
So, what this legislation does is 
builds upon some of the efforts for eco-
logical restoration. 
I want to thank the great work of 
Carlton Dufrechou, Kristi Trail, and 
others who have done an amazing job 
in working to restore the ecological 
function of Lake Pontchartrain. 
I again want to thank all the cospon-
sors and folks who have helped us to 
work on this legislation. It did pass 
unanimously last Congress, and I want 
to remind everybody here that there is 
a huge Federal nexus with this legisla-
tion. I urge its adoption. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, H.R. 
1921 would reauthorize an important 
program that supports the critical ef-
forts of the Federal, State, and local 
watershed partners in restoring water 
quality in the Lake Pontchartrain 
Basin. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this important legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1921. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

PREVENTING DISASTER 
REVICTIMIZATION ACT 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 539) to amend the Disaster 
Recovery Reform Act of 2018 to require

States related to covered assistance 
provided to an individual or household, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

ance was distributed based on an error by the 
Agency and such debt shall be construed as a 
hardship; and 
‘‘(ii) waive a debt owed to the United 
States related to covered assistance provided 
to an individual or household if such assist-
ance is subject to a claim or legal action, in-
cluding in accordance with section 317 of the 
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer-
gency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5160); and’’; 
and 
(2) in paragraph (3)(B)— 
(A) by striking ‘‘REMOVAL OF’’ and insert-
ing ‘‘REPORT ON’’; and

paragraph (2) shall no longer be effective’’ 
and inserting ‘‘the Administrator shall re-
port to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Affairs of 
the Senate actions that the Administrator 
will take to reduce the error rate’’. 
SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
GRAVES) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 539. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 539, the Preventing Disaster Re-
victimization 
Act, 
introduced 
by 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee Ranking Member GRAVES 
from 
Missouri 
and 
Representatives 
CARBAJAL, 
GARAMENDI, 
HUFFMAN, 
THOMPSON, and LAMALFA of California. 
This legislation is designed to ensure 
disaster survivors are not revictimized 
by recoupment—or clawbacks—of Fed-
eral disaster assistance they have re-
ceived from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
Unfortunately, FEMA has repeatedly 
instructed disaster survivors to reg-
ister 
for 
individual 
assistance 
for 
which they were ultimately not eligi-
ble, or granted qualified survivors more 
assistance than they should have re-
ceived. 
However, once FEMA identifies an 
error, it forces these survivors into a 
bureaucratic nightmare to appeal the 
debt that they now owe as a result of 
the agency’s error. I am not surprised 
that this still goes on, but I am dis-
appointed that—given the technology 
and data we have at our fingertips—we 
have not been able to improve this sys-
tem for survivors, especially consid-
ering that this program is just a small 
piece of the Federal disaster recovery 
apparatus. 
H.R. 539 would waive survivors’ debt 
owed to the Federal Government in in-
stances where FEMA erroneously dis-
tributed assistance. This bill would 
also provide a similar waiver to dis-
aster survivors who may be involved in 
a legal action against a party deemed 
responsible for a disaster event. While 
this scenario is less common, it played 
out in California last year and jeopard-
ized disaster relief for tens of thou-
sands of families displaced by the un-
precedented wildfires of the last few 
years. 
Survivors have already been trauma-
tized by a disaster—the Federal Gov-
ernment should not force them to en-
dure a convoluted process to correct 
FEMA’s mistakes or decision to pursue 
legal action years after an event 
against a liable party. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am a proud spon-
sor of this bill, the Preventing Disaster 
Revictimization Act. 
In 2018, Congress made the recovery 
process fairer and more equitable for 
communities when we passed impor-
tant reforms to the disaster prepara-
tion and recovery processes. This bill 
builds upon those efforts by ensuring 
that funds spent by disaster victims 
aren’t clawed back by the government. 
When victims apply—and this is in 
good faith, mind you—when victims 
apply for assistance from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and 
receive it from the agency, those indi-
viduals likely need to move quickly to 
use that assistance for eligible ex-
penses like home repairs to speed up

recovery and to begin rebuilding their 
lives, for obvious reasons. So, these 
victims 
should 
never 
expect 
that 
FEMA is going to come back weeks, 
months, and sometimes even years 
later and say: Oops, we made a mis-
take. Now you, the victim, are going to 
have to give back those funds that you 
have already put to good use. 
To add insult to injury, FEMA’s in-
formation on how disaster victims can 
appeal these decisions is incredibly 
confusing, and it is absolutely insuffi-
cient. 
Remember, this is due to no fault of 
their own, but many disaster victims 
are faced with debt collectors and the 
full force of the Federal Government 
when it comes to repaying these funds. 
This is absolutely unacceptable. Peo-
ple acting in good faith to rebuild 
should not be revictimized after they 
have properly relied upon FEMA’s de-
termination that they were qualified 
for the assistance that they did re-
ceive. 
This bill, H.R. 539, is going to clarify 
that if FEMA makes an error, and 
there is no evidence of fraud, then the 
victim will not be revictimized. Their 
debt is automatically viewed as a hard-
ship, and it is waived. 
In addition, the bill would also re-
quire FEMA to report back to Con-
gress, to us, on its error rates and tell 
us what they are doing to be more ac-
curate. 
Last Congress, this bill passed on the 
House floor and had bipartisan support. 
This Congress, the bill now has a com-
panion version in the Senate, and I 
hope that we can see this legislation 
enacted into law this year and truly 
help disaster victims not only in my 
district but also across the Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage support 
for this bill. It is a good bill, and people 
don’t need to be revictimized. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of

passed.

EXPEDITED 
DELIVERY 
OF 
AIR-
PORT INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 
2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 468) to amend title 49, United 
States Code, to permit the use of incen-
tive payments to expedite certain fed-
erally financed airport development 
projects. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 468 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expedited 
Delivery of Airport Infrastructure Act of 
2021’’. 
SEC. 2. ALLOWABLE COST STANDARDS FOR AIR-
PORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 47110(b)(1) of title 
49, United States Code, is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘(1) if the cost necessarily’’ 
and inserting ‘‘(1)(A) if the cost necessarily’’; 
(2) by striking the semicolon at the end 
and inserting ‘‘; or’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(B) if the cost is an incentive payment in-
curred in carrying out the project described 
in subparagraph (A) that is to be provided to 
a contractor upon early completion of a 
project, if— 
‘‘(i) such payment does not exceed the less-
er of 5 percent of the initial construction 
contract amount or $1,000,000; 
‘‘(ii) the level of contractor’s control of, or 
access to, the worksite necessary to shorten 
the duration of the project does not nega-
tively impact the operation of the airport; 
‘‘(iii) the contract specifies application of 
the incentive structure in the event of un-
foreseeable, non-weather delays beyond the 
control of the contractor; 
‘‘(iv) nothing in any agreement with the 
contractor prevents the airport operator 
from retaining responsibility for the safety, 
efficiency, and capacity of the airport during 
the execution of the grant agreement; and 
‘‘(v) the Secretary determines that the use 
of an incentive payment is likely to increase 
airport capacity or efficiency or result in 
cost savings as a result of shortening the 
project’s duration;’’.

CORRECTION.—Section 
47110(e)(7) of title 49, United States Code, is

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
GRAVES) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 468. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 468, the Expe-
dited Delivery of Airport Infrastruc-
ture Act of 2021. Introduced by the 
committee’s 
ranking 
member, 
SAM 
GRAVES, the bill incentivizes the early 
completion of airport projects funded 
by the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion’s Airport Improvement Program. 
As the global pandemic begins to sub-
side and the number of vaccinated 
Americans has steadily grown, the 
number of passengers traveling by air 
has dramatically increased. In fact, 
last month, the Transportation Secu-
rity Administration recorded the high-
est 
number 
of 
daily 
passengers 
screened at U.S. airports since the 
start of the COVID–19 pandemic, forc-
ing airports to find ways to keep up 
with the growing passenger demand. 
This legislation will help address this 
need by allowing airports to use their 
Airport Improvement Program funding 
to offer incentive payments to contrac-
tors for early completion of airport de-
velopment projects. 
Importantly, H.R. 468 includes condi-
tions that ensure projects completed 
early do not have a negative impact on 
airport safety, efficiency, or capacity. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 468, which is the Expedited Deliv-
ery of Airport Infrastructure Act of 
2021, and I want to thank Aviation Sub-
committee Ranking Member GARRET 
GRAVES for cosponsoring the bill. 
H.R. 468 provides airports with some 
commonsense tools to incentivize the 
early completion of airport projects 
using AIP funds, or Airport Improve-
ment Program funds. 
Under this bill, the use of AIP funds 
for incentive payments is left to the 
discretion of the airport operator, but 
the benefits of incentive payments are 
already well-known in the surface 
transportation sector. 
This bill is going to allow airports to 
expedite 
the 
delivery 
of 
airport 
projects, take better advantage of 
short 
construction 
seasons, 
relieve 
operational 
disruptions 
that 
result 
from such projects and, obviously, save 
the taxpayer money. 
This is a commonsense practice that 
is utilized in so many other Federal in-
frastructure projects and it does not 
increase Federal spending. 
H.R. 468 is supported by the Amer-
ican Association of Airport Executives, 
the Airports Council International, and 
the Associated General Contractors of 
America. 
This bill was introduced in Congress 
last year. It passed the House under 
suspension of the rules, and it was done 
by voice vote. I am hopeful that we can 
get this commonsense bill across the 
finish line this Congress. I would very 
much urge support of the legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES), the ranking mem-
ber of the Aviation Subcommittee.

DEFAZIO; the sponsor of the bill, the 
ranking member of the committee, 
SAM GRAVES; as well as Aviation Rank-
ing Member RICK
LARSEN
of Wash-
ington State. 
Madam Speaker, we need to be able 
to have the authority to make incen-
tive payments. We have seen an ex-
traordinary shift in aviation travel. In 
April of last year, there was a 95 per-
cent reduction in airline passengers. 
We recently saw TSA screen the same 
number of passengers as before the 
pandemic. 
The aviation demand is coming back 
with a vengeance. Our airports are 
crowded. Our airlines are packed. Our 
airplanes are packed. 
What this allows the FAA to do is to 
provide incentive payments to expedite 
the 
completion 
of 
construction 
projects at airports. This is for safety. 
This is for additional capacity. This is 
going to ensure that the aviation in-
dustry, that our airport infrastructure 
can keep up with increased demand. 
And as the ranking member said, this 
same expedited authority and incen-
tive payments is allowed in other 
forms of infrastructure. So I want to 
thank 
the 
ranking 
member, 
SAM 
GRAVES, for bringing up this common-
sense legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge its adoption. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this is common-
sense legislation. It doesn’t cost the 
government any money. And the fact 
of the matter is, it is already being 
done in so many other areas of trans-
portation projects. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the bill, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of

Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2016) to amend the Disaster 
Recovery Reform Act of 2018 to develop 
a study regarding streamlining and 
consolidating information collection 
and preliminary damage assessments,

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

COLLECTION 
AND PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ASSESS-
MENTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1223 of the Dis-
aster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (Public

note), to expedite the administration of pre-
liminary damage assessments. 
‘‘(c) COMPREHENSIVE REPORT.—The Admin-
istrator shall submit one comprehensive re-
port that comprises the plans developed 
under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) and a re-
port of the findings of the working group

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico 
(Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) each will con-

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2016. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 2016, the Fed-
eral Disaster Assistance Coordination 
Act, introduced by Representatives 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N and PETERS. This leg-
islation amends the Disaster Recovery 
Reform Act to help Federal agencies 
streamline and consolidate informa-
tion collection and preliminary dam-
age assessments following disasters. 
When a major disaster occurs, Ameri-
cans don’t have time to wait for bu-
reaucracy. Today, however, too many 
barriers stand between emergency re-
sponse and Americans in crisis due to 
disaster. 
Federal recovery assistance following 
major disasters is currently hampered 
by inefficient information collection 
and assessments conducted by multiple 
agencies. 
This bill will remove information 
collection barriers that currently im-
pede disaster aid. It creates a working 
group to identify duplicative assess-
ments and propose their elimination. 
Further, it would streamline Federal 
disaster recovery efforts by concluding 
that a single agency is sufficient to 
conduct damage assessments to ac-
count for the needs of disaster victims 
in 2021. 
It is 2021, and we can and should be 
doing this smarter. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2770 
June 15, 2021 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
First of all, I rise in support of this 
bill, H.R. 2016, the Federal Disaster As-
sistance Coordination Act. 
First, I want to thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES 
for bringing this bill to the floor, as 
well as Chairwoman NORTON. But I 
would also like to thank Representa-
tive SCOTT PETERS from California for 
cosponsoring this legislation. 
In the last Congress, I joined with 
former colleague, MARK MEADOWS, in 
proposing this bill, and it was with 
great satisfaction that I see it come to 
the floor. 
This is a simple bill that will estab-
lish a process to identify ways to 
streamline and consolidate the collec-
tion of certain disaster information in 
order to start the recovery process for 
individuals, families, and government 
devastated by natural disasters. 
While FEMA is the lead Federal 
agency on disasters, there are multiple 
Federal agencies involved in every dis-
aster response and recovery. This often 
leads to duplicative assessments and 
causes serious delays for the recovery 
process to begin. 
In the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma 
and Maria, and the seismic activity in 
Puerto Rico, we discovered how Fed-
eral agency after Federal agency, from 
FEMA, to HUD, to SBA, would require 
the same information from applicants, 
location, nature of damage, ownership, 
value of damage, estimated repair 
costs, among many others, in each of 
their preliminary assessments. 
There was no process to share this in-
formation between the Federal agen-
cies, which ultimately caused signifi-
cant delays during both immediate re-
lief and long-term recovery. At one 
point, these represented more than 
70,000 assessments of individual work-
sites that each needed to be completed 
by FEMA. Many of these assessments 
will be small parts of a larger project; 
sites costing under $126,000, with re-
sponsibilities divided among munici-
palities and State agencies. Many of 
these were each, itself, a part of a larg-
er process. 
For example, repairs to individual 
pipes, storage tanks or pumps of an aq-
ueduct system; and having to evaluate 
each site individually will slow down 
the whole project. 
After many complaints from us and 
the local governments, FEMA, finally, 
in 2020, decided to begin consolidating 
these assessments for Puerto Rico to 
speed up the project delivery process 
across multiple Federal agencies. 
I think it is critically important that 
Federal response agencies work to-
gether to minimize overlaps in their 
assessments and take advantage of the 
newest technologies. 
Specifically, this bill will establish a 
Federal working group led by FEMA 
that will work with the Council of the 
Inspectors General on Integrity and Ef-
ficiency, and in consultation with 
HUD, SBA, HHS, EDA, the Department 
of Labor, and OMB to identify ways to 
reduce duplication and modernize the 
Federal damage assessments process. 
This is a good government bill that 
will help expedite all forms of disaster 
recovery across the Nation. As we have 
learned in Puerto Rico, it is not a mat-
ter of if there is a next disaster; it is 
about when it is going to happen, at 
least in our case. 
So we must be ready to respond in a 
way that takes care of the immediate 
needs of those facing a disaster and of 
rebuilding with resiliency. That re-
sponse needs to be efficient and effec-
tive, and with this legislation, we are 
going to help bring this about. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Texas 
(Ms. 
VAN 
DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my colleagues’ 
bill, H.R. 2016, the Federal Disaster As-
sistance Coordination Act. 
When I was Regional Secretary for 
HUD during Hurricane Harvey, Hurri-
cane Maria, and Hurricane Irma, I saw 
firsthand the bureaucratic web of red 
tape and inefficiencies that prevented 
getting help to those who needed it the 
most in a timely manner. 
I spoke with several of you in this 
body on both sides of the aisle, who 
came to me fighting for your constitu-
ents, asking why it was taking so long 
to get aid. I felt and understood your 
frustration, but had to explain the long 
list of policies, procedures, and red 
tape that our regulations demanded. 
And, boy, I never felt like more of a bu-
reaucrat than when I spoke with you. 
It is a very difficult position for our 
folks to be in. These inefficiencies have 
serious costs. 
This is a bipartisan piece of common-
sense legislation to establish proce-
dures to streamline and consolidate 
processes. When we allocate dollars, 
they need to get to those who are suf-
fering the most. And the last thing we 
need is for them to be caught up in a 
bureaucracy of the government’s mak-
ing. 
The faster FEMA is able to help get 
to communities of need, the faster they 
can recover. It is critically important 
that these agencies all work together. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan legislation. 
b 1345 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES), my friend and the 
ranking member of the Aviation Sub-
committee. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, you have heard numerous 
speakers talk about the bureaucracy 
that happens in the aftermath of a dis-
aster, and we had legislation by Rank-
ing Member SAM GRAVES trying to help 
to cut through that bureaucracy and 
not have our own Federal Government 
revictimize our disaster victims, who 
are citizens of this country. 
In the aftermath of a disaster— 
which, being from south Louisiana, we 
experience, unfortunately, way too fre-
quently—we have FEMA, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, that 
comes in; we have the Small Business 
Administration that comes in; we have 
the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development; we have the Department 
of Agriculture; and others that all offer 
different types of emergency aid or 
programs. 
Madam Speaker, apparently, it ap-
pears that many of these agencies 
aren’t aware that there has been this 
invention called the internet that con-
nects everybody. Instead of coming in 
and forcing these disaster victims, who 
potentially have lost everything that 
they own, to come in and stop by nu-
merous locations and fill out the same 
paperwork over and over again, they 
should come in and apply commonsense 
solutions that we have seen in the pri-
vate sector for decades now, simply 
coming in, providing information once, 
being more efficient, truly providing 
service to these disaster victims, in-
stead of revictimizing them. 
I want to thank the gentlewoman 
from Puerto Rico, my friend, for her 
leadership on this effort. I know, being 
from Puerto Rico and victimized by 
Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and others, 
this is an extraordinary issue for her 
constituents. I really do appreciate 
Congressman DEFAZIO, Ranking Mem-
ber SAM GRAVES, and others who have 
partnered with her on this legislation, 
allowing it to go through. I urge adop-
tion of this legislation. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I want 
to first thank Chairman DEFAZIO and 
Ranking Member GRAVES for bringing 
this important bipartisan legislation to 
the floor. 
H.R. 2016 would begin the critical 
process in working to consolidate the 
overlapping disaster response programs 
that delay disaster assistance for citi-
zens in Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N’s dis-
trict, as well as in my district. 
Mississippi has withstood flooding, 
hurricanes, and tornadoes over the last 
2 years, and many of these response ef-
forts are still underway today. This is 
no fault of the Federal agencies that 
are tasked with responding, but it is, 
instead, the product of overlapping pro-
grams that result in duplicative assess-
ments that delay the recovery process. 
This bill would establish a Federal 
working group to help identify a more 
streamlined approach to helping Amer-
icans respond to natural disasters.

This commonsense approach to solv-
ing delays in Federal disaster response 
would help expedite recovery and give 
Americans confidence in the Federal 
response. 
I 
appreciate 
Congresswoman 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N’s leadership on this 
issue, and I ask my colleagues to sup-
port this important piece of legisla-
tion. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to say, 
in closing, that H.R. 2016 is a good-gov-
ernment, bipartisan piece of legislation 
that will help streamline and improve 
disaster recovery efforts. 
It is not just Puerto Rico. It is not 
just the Caribbean. From the western 
part of the United States to even the 
territories, we are all affected by nat-
ural disasters. 
I want to thank, again, Representa-
tive SCOTT PETERS from California for 
co-leading this legislation, as well as 
Chairman DEFAZIO and Ranking Mem-
ber GRAVES for recognizing the merits 
of this bill. 
I urge support of H.R. 2016, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2016. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1262, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support 
H.R. 1262, the Notice to Airmen Im-
provement Act, introduced by Mr. 
STAUBER and Mr. DESAULNIER. 
H.R. 1262 will create a task force to 
review existing methods for presenting 
notices to airmen. Notices to airmen 
provide pilots with essential and real- 
time information regarding abnormali-
ties or issues in the National Airspace 
System. For example, notices to air-
men alert pilots to potential hazards in 
the airspace or at an airport, such as a 
closed runway or taxiway. While pilots 
are required to review all notices to 
airmen before flight, there has been 
concern about the lengthiness and 
completeness of the critical informa-
tion contained in notices to airmen and 
how the information is displayed to, 
and organized for, pilots. 
Under H.R. 1262, the task force will 
determine best practices for organizing 
and presenting flight operations infor-
mation to pilots in the most optimal 
manner and make recommendations to 
improve the presentation of notices to 
airmen while ensuring their accuracy 
and completeness. 
Recommendations 
from 
the 
task 
force could help prevent future avia-
tion accidents and near-accidents. We 
saw, in July 2017, an Air Canada A320 
almost land on top of five jetliners, 
with more than a thousand people on 
board, awaiting takeoff at San Fran-
cisco International Airport, before exe-
cuting a go-around. The aircraft came 
as close as 60 feet above one of the 
planes on the ground. 
Thankfully, there were no injuries, 
but this could have been catastrophic. 
The National Transportation Safety 
Board determined the probable cause of 
the incident was the pilots’ misidenti-
fication of the taxiway for a runway, 
based in part on their ineffective re-
view of notices to airmen before flight. 
Notices to airmen and airwomen can 
and must be better for pilots. I expect 
the task force established under H.R. 
1262 will lead to recommendations that 
will improve aviation safety.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2772 
June 15, 2021 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
STAUBER
from Minnesota for intro-
ducing this legislation and working to-
gether with Congressman DESAULNIER 
from California. 
As Ms. NORTON, the gentlewoman 
from the District of Columbia, noted, 
in 2017, at San Francisco International 
Airport, a NOTAM had been issued, a 
notice to airmen, which is usually sent 
to notify pilots about changes in air-
space or construction conditions or 
changes of conditions at airports. 
One was issued that indicated that a 
runway was under construction and an 
alternative runway was open. They had 
an Air Canada flight that came in 
while four occupied planes were on the 
taxiway, and there was a near miss 
where this Air Canada flight nearly 
landed on a taxiway that they mistook 
for the alternative runway. It would 
have caused widespread death in the 
event that those five planes ultimately 
would have collided. 
The National Transportation Safety 
Board, as noted, did find that the lack 
of comprehension, or possibly even re-
viewing this NOTAM, was a primary 
cause. 
This legislation creates a task force 
to look at better ways of informing, of 
connecting with pilots, to make sure 
that they have accurate information 
and that they actually read or are 
aware of these changing conditions 
which could, as in the 2017 incident, be 
the difference between life and death. 
Again, I want to thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO. I want to thank Ranking 
Member SAM GRAVES. I want to thank 
Mr. STAUBER, the author of this bill, 
with 
his 
partner, 
Congressman 
DESAULNIER from California. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield as much time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in support of my bipar-
tisan legislation that improves the 
safety of air travel. I would also like to 
thank my colleague, Mr. DESAULNIER, 
for his support and leadership on this 
piece of legislation. 
In 2020, the United States was home 
to 7 of the top 10 busiest airports in the 
world. This means that, as Americans, 
we have no room for error when it 
comes to aviation safety. 
Although aviation is the safest form 
of travel, we must always strive to do 
better. This is why we must address the 
notice to airmen, or NOTAM, system. 
NOTAMs are critical, as they relay 
safety information to pilots that allow 
them to understand the possible haz-
ards and conditions of airports and 
runways before actually getting to the 
destination. 
The current system simply is not 
working as well as it should. NOTAMs 
are often buried in lengthy reports, 
conflating important safety informa-
tion with more common alerts. These 
inefficiencies have the potential to cre-
ate life-threatening situations, as de-
scribed earlier. 
My legislation addresses these issues 
and creates a task force at the FAA 
with important input from safety ex-
perts and industry professionals to ad-
dress what changes need to be made to 
NOTAMs to make air travel even safer 
than it already is. 
Americans are more comfortable and 
excited to travel than they have been 
in over a year. Let’s ensure that we 
support this sentiment and bolster the 
safety in our skies. 
I was proud to work with my col-
leagues to get this reported out of the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee 
unanimously, 
both 
last 
Congress and this one. 
The House also passed this legisla-
tion with strong bipartisan support 
during the 116th Congress, and I urge 
the same support this Congress of the 
Notice to Airmen Improvement Act. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield as much time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, first, I 
would like to thank Chairman DEFAZIO 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
GRAVES
for 
bringing this bipartisan legislation to 
the floor. 
H.R. 1262 would create a task force to 
recommend reforms and improvements 
to the notice to airmen system, a cru-
cial domestic and international flight 
safety notification to pilots that has 
become both inefficient and outdated 
over the years. 
The current state of the notice to 
airmen system has the potential to cre-
ate life-threatening situations for both 
pilots and their passengers. This re-
form would provide the needed steps to 
provide important safety information 
to our Nation’s pilots in a timely and 
concise manner. 
In the most recent FAA reauthoriza-
tion, Congress made it a priority that 
the agency delivers a new and modern-
ized notice to airmen system, yet we 
have seen few results to date. This leg-
islation would make that priority a re-
ality within 1 year from this bill’s en-
actment. 
I would like to thank Congressman 
STAUBER
for his leadership on this 
issue and for prioritizing aviation safe-
ty within this bill. 
b 1400 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to 
say that the United States has the 
safest aviation system in the world, 
and air travel is the safest way to trav-
el. 
This bipartisan legislation by Con-
gressmen STAUBER and DESAULNIER en-
sures that we maintain that level of 
safety for air passengers in the future. 
I think it is a great bipartisan piece of 
legislation. I appreciate those two gen-
tlemen working on this together. I 
urge adoption of the legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BLUNT ROCHESTER). The question is on 
the motion offered by the gentlewoman 
from the District of Columbia (Ms. 
NORTON) that the House suspend the

The question was taken; and (two-

INFORMATION ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2093) to direct the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to make all fact 
sheets of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs available in English, Spanish, 
and Tagalog, and other commonly spo-
ken languages, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2093 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans 
and Family Information Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FACT SHEETS. 
(a) LANGUAGES.—The Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs shall make available versions of all 
fact sheets of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs in— 
(1) English; 
(2) Spanish; 
(3) Tagalog; and 
(4) each of the 10 most commonly spoken 
languages, other than English, in the United 
States that are not otherwise covered by 
paragraphs (2) and (3). 
(b) WEBSITE.—The Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs shall establish and maintain a pub-
licly available website of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs that contains links to all 
fact sheets of the Veterans Benefits Adminis-
tration, Veterans Health Administration, 
and of the National Cemetery Administra-
tion. The website shall be accessible by a 
clearly labeled hyperlink on the homepage of 
the Department. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit a 
report to Congress regarding fact sheets de-
scribed in subsection (a) and details of the 
Language Access Plan of the Department of 
Veteran Affairs. The report shall include the 
following: 
(1) What the Secretary determines con-
stitutes a fact sheet of the Department for 
purposes of this Act. 
(2) How such fact sheets are utilized and 
distributed other than on and through the 
website of the Department. 
(3) How such Language Access Plan is com-
municated to veterans, family members of 
veterans, and caregivers. 
(4) The roles and responsibilities of patient 
advocates in the coordination of care for vet-
erans with limited English proficiency, fam-
ily members of such veterans, and care-
givers. 
(5) Other demographic information that 
the Secretary determines appropriate re-
garding veterans with limited English pro-
ficiency. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
2093. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, since 2001 the for-
eign-born share of the veteran popu-
lation has steadily risen. Immigrants 
have served in the Armed Forces since 
the very beginning of our Nation, and 
they today make up 600,000 veterans. 
1.9 million veterans are the U.S.-born 
children of immigrants. Together, the 
2.5 million veterans of immigrant ori-
gin, by birth or parentage, account for 
13 percent of all veterans living today. 
Certain nationals of countries in free 
association with the United States— 
the Marshall Islands, the Federated 
States of Micronesia, and Palau—are 
eligible to serve the United States, and 
they do in numbers much larger than 
their counterparts stateside. 
Half a million veterans live in Puerto 
Rico. There are 6,000 regular Philippine 
Scouts still alive and 15,000 U.S. vet-
erans who live in the Philippines, half 
of whom rely on the VA clinic in Ma-
nila for their service-connected care. 
Two-thirds of the veteran cohorts I 
just mentioned do not speak English at 
home. Many of them are aging and 
have to rely more and more on their 
families for care and to manage health 
decisions. 
VA has scarce availability of vet-
eran-facing materials in other lan-
guages, both online and in paper. Fa-
cilities are, for the most part, on their 
own to translate material that best 
serves their patients. 
This extra burden was made clear to 
me during committee trips to Puerto 
Rico, where we heard from staff about 
the arduous work it took to have to 
translate everything from administra-
tive staff training materials to hurri-
cane brochures. Everything sent from 
VA Central Office in Washington, D.C., 
to Puerto Rico had to be redone so it 
could be usable and accessible to vet-
erans and the staff who serve them. 
The VA should be fully accessible to 
all veterans who need it, and that in-
cludes 
language 
accessibility. 
Mr. 
JEFFRIES’ bill, H.R. 2093, the Veterans 
and Family Information Act, would re-
quire VA to do what it should have 
been doing for years, make its veteran- 
facing fact sheets and websites avail-
able in languages veterans and their 
families speak; specifically, the lan-
guages of Spanish, Tagalog, and the 
other top 10 spoken languages in the 
United States. It would also require VA 
to create a language access plan for the 
VA enterprise. 
Now, this is a long overdue correc-
tion of VA’s posture. If this pandemic 
has taught us anything, it is that 
clearly communicated public health in-
formation from our healthcare institu-
tions is essential. VA must ensure that 
language proficiency is never a barrier 
to a veteran’s care. 
I therefore ask my colleagues to join 
me in supporting the Veterans and 
Family Information Act. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2093, the Veterans and 
Family Information Act. This bill 
would require VA to make fact sheets 
available in multiple languages, in-
cluding English, Spanish, and Tagalog. 
I appreciate Congressman JEFFRIES’ 
introduction of this legislation, and I 
am glad to support it today. I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), my good 
friend, the chairman of the Democratic 
Caucus and author of H.R. 2093. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend and classmate, 
Chairman TAKANO, for his tremendous 
leadership as well as the leadership of 
the ranking member and all of the dis-
tinguished members of the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2093, the Veterans and Family In-
formation Act, a bipartisan bill that 
will serve those who have served our 
Nation with distinction. This common-
sense legislation would improve non- 
English language accessibility for vet-
erans, their families, and caregivers. 
The Veterans Benefits Administra-
tion provides critical information to 
all veterans about their benefits that 
have been hard earned, including serv-
ice-connected disability benefits, home 
loans, vocational rehabilitation, em-
ployment information, and how to ac-
cess assistance for trauma. 
For veterans of limited English pro-
ficiency, there is no guarantee that 
this critical information is made avail-
able in their primary language, thereby 
creating barriers for them and for their 
families. 
As Chairman TAKANO indicated, there 
are over 500,000 foreign-born veterans 
that live in the United States, and ad-
ditionally 1.9 million veterans who are 
the U.S.-born children of foreign-born 
parents. 
Not only are our veterans increas-
ingly diverse in terms of country of or-
igin, but tens of thousands of veterans 
have self-identified to the VA that they 
speak English less than well. 
In the most recent survey conducted, 
the VA also found that minorities, peo-
ple of color, and language minorities 
comprise approximately 24 percent of 
the total veteran population in the 
United States. 
Every single veteran deserves con-
sistent, clear, and equal access to any 
and all information that the VA offers, 
regardless of their English proficiency. 
They have all served this country well. 
The Veterans and Family Informa-
tion Act would direct the Department 
of Veterans Affairs to make versions of

all of its fact sheets available in the 10 
most 
commonly 
spoken 
languages 
other than English in the United 
States, including Spanish and Tagalog. 
I would like to thank the lead co-
sponsor of this bill, Representative 
YOUNG KIM, for her extraordinary lead-
ership and partnership in this effort, as 
well as, again, the chair, ranking mem-
ber, and all of the distinguished mem-
bers of the Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 2093. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
2093, the Veterans and Family Informa-
tion Act. This is the legislation I intro-
duced with my colleague, Representa-
tive JEFFRIES. 
This bipartisan bill directs the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs to make 
versions of all fact sheets available in 
the 10 most commonly spoken lan-
guages other than English in the 
United States, including Spanish, Chi-
nese, Tagalog, and Korean. 
My district is home to more than 
27,000 veterans from diverse back-
grounds who faithfully served in the 
United States military, including my 
own sister, brother-in-law, and my hus-
band, too. With an increasingly diverse 
population of veterans across the coun-
try, and with United States veterans 
residing in the Philippines and in Puer-
to Rico, this bill ensures that our vet-
erans and their caretakers whose first 
languages are not English are aware of 
and understand the VA’s benefits. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
JEFFRIES for working with me to im-
prove language availability and acces-
sibility at the VA. I urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to support 
H.R. 2093. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I encour-
age all my colleagues to support this 
bill. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I am 
very, very pleased to recommend to all 
of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ This 
issue affects my own constituency 
where I know that we have veterans 
that have caregivers that may only 
speak, say, the language of Spanish, 
and so I am very convinced that this 
legislation will benefit all of our coun-
try, but especially my own district. 
It is with that spirit that I rec-
ommend that we pass this important 
piece of legislation. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2093. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

EQUAL 
ACCESS 
TO 
CONTRACEP-
TION FOR VETERANS ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 239) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to provide for limitations 
on copayments for contraception fur-
nished by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 239 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equal Ac-
cess to Contraception for Veterans Act’’. 
SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON COPAYMENTS FOR CON-
TRACEPTION. 
Section 1722A(a)(2) of title 38, United 
States Code, is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘to pay’’ and all that fol-
lows through the period and inserting ‘‘to 
pay—’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraphs: 
‘‘(A) an amount in excess of the cost to the 
Secretary for medication described in para-
graph (1); or 
‘‘(B) an amount for any contraceptive item 
for which coverage under health insurance 
coverage is required without the imposition 
of any cost-sharing requirement pursuant to 
section 2713(a)(4) of the Public Health Serv-
ice Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–13(a)(4)).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 239. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, contraception ac-
cess is a crucial element of preventa-
tive healthcare and reduces the likeli-
hood that a woman will live in poverty. 
Copay-free access to contraception is 
covered under every insurance program 
in this country, except at the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs. 
H.R. 239, the Equal Access to Contra-
ception for Veterans Act, would elimi-
nate copays on contraceptive items at 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. I 
thank Congresswoman BROWNLEY
for 
introducing this bill and for her efforts 
as chair of the Subcommittee on 
Health and the Women Veterans Task 
Force. 
Contraception 
is 
already 
widely 
available at VA, and veterans enrolled 
at VA can obtain oral contraceptions, 
shots, skin patches, vaginal rings, and 
long-acting reversible contraceptives, 
such as implants or intrauterine de-
vices. In addition, the VA pharmacy 
dispenses over-the-counter contracep-
tives, including condoms and emer-
gency contraception. 
Even a small copay can be insur-
mountable for a veteran struggling to 
make ends meet. Eliminating copays 
ensures parity with both Federal insur-
ers and private insurers, as mandated 
under the Affordable Care Act. Most of 
all, it eliminates an unnecessary finan-
cial burden on our veterans. 
Furthermore, we know also that 
every tax dollar spent on family plan-
ning, such as contraception, ultimately 
saves seven times that amount. 
Passing this bill is an essential ele-
ment of both meeting the health and 
economic well-being of our Nation’s 
veterans. 
This legislation has the support of 
the VA, broad VSO support, and passed 
on suspension last Congress. 
Again, I thank Chairwoman JULIA 
BROWNLEY for her leadership on this 
issue, and I ask my colleagues to join 
me in supporting H.R. 239. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 239, the Equal Access to 
Contraception for Veterans Act. 
The bill would prohibit the VA from 
charging copayments to veterans for 
contraception. 
Women are volunteering to serve our 
country in uniform in record numbers. 
When they separate from the service, 
they are seeking care from the VA in 
record numbers as well. Ensuring that 
those women receive the recognition, 
respect, and welcome they are owed is 
one of our highest priorities. 
This bill would further that goal. I 
am glad to support it here today. 
Copayments have been prohibited for 
contraception in the private sector for 
many years. This bill would bring the 
VA healthcare system in line with that 
precedent. 
This bill passed the committee last 
year with unanimous, bipartisan sup-
port. One of those supporters was the 
former Republican leader of this com-
mittee, Dr. ROE. Dr. ROE, who is an OB/ 
GYN, has decades of experience with 
women’s health and reproductive care. 
Like me, he is also a steadfast defender 
of pro-life principles. 
This bill also passed the House last 
Congress by voice vote. I hope that it 
can do so again this Congress. 
The Equal Access to Contraception 
for Veterans Act was introduced by 
Congresswoman BROWNLEY. I thank her 
for her continued efforts on behalf of 
women veterans and for introducing 
the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
join me in voting for this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2775 
June 15, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. BROWNLEY), my 
good friend, the chairwoman of the 
Subcommittee on Health, and also the 
author of this important legislation. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 239, the 
Equal Access to Contraception for Vet-
erans Act, my bill to ensure that vet-
erans have access to contraception cov-
erage without any copay. 
I thank the chairman for working 
with me to advance this legislation. 
Because of the Affordable Care Act, 
women using civilian health insurance 
may access basic contraceptive serv-
ices, like the pill or an IUD, without 
any copay. Active Duty servicemem-
bers can also receive contraceptive 
care without any copay. 
However, women veterans who re-
ceive healthcare through the VA do not 
have access to the same benefit. 
Clearly, we need to fix this inequity. 
The benefits of contraception are 
widely recognized. 
Choosing when, or if, to have a fam-
ily is essential to women’s health and 
to their economic security. 
Today, there are two million women 
veterans living in the United States, 
and women compromise the fastest 
growing subpopulation within the mili-
tary 
and 
veteran 
populations; 
yet 
many 
of 
their 
health 
needs 
go 
unaddressed in a VA system that has 
not evolved to equitably serve a rap-
idly changing population. 
As chairwoman of the Women Vet-
erans Task Force and chair of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee 
on Health, I have worked to identify 
disparities in healthcare for women 
veterans and, where necessary, intro-
duce, advocate for, and pass legislation 
that eliminates these gaps. 
Our veterans have sacrificed so much 
for our country. It is past time that we 
ensure that they get the equitable 
healthcare they have earned and de-
serve. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 239. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Ranking Member BOST 
for pointing out that the previous 
ranking member and previous chair-
man of this committee, an OB/GYN, 
Representative ROE, stood in firm sup-
port of this legislation. I know him to 
also be someone of very firm pro-life 
convictions. I am very proud of the bi-
partisan support that has gathered 
around Ms. BROWNLEY’s legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 239. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

PAIR, ENHANCEMENT, AND DEBT 
IMPROVEMENT FOR TOMORROW 
ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1257) to direct the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study 
on the effect of financial and credit 
counseling for homeless veterans and 
veterans experiencing housing insta-
bility, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
1257, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, credit and financial 
counseling services remain a top 10 
unmet need for veterans experiencing 
or who are at risk of homelessness. 
This bill directs the VA to study the 
efficacy and barriers to credit and fi-
nancial counseling for homeless and 
unstably housed veterans, and to pro-
vide recommendations for improve-
ments to these services. 
Under the Homeless Veterans CRED-
IT Act, the Secretary will work with 
outside organizations to review these 
barriers, and submit to Congress con-
crete steps we can take to expand cred-
it access to veterans in need. 
H.R. 1257, as amended, has the sup-
port of VA and key veteran service or-
ganizations, like the VFW, Paralyzed 
Veterans of America, and the IAVA. 
Also included in this legislation are 
various oversight improvements to ex-
isting law that our committee has 
worked on with the House Appropria-
tions Committee, and I thank my col-
leagues on the Appropriations Com-
mittee for their hard work. I therefore, 
ask my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 1257, as amended. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1257, as amended, the 
Homeless Veterans Credit Repair, En-
hancement, and Debt Improvement for 
Tomorrow—or CREDIT—Act. 
This bill would direct the VA to 
study the effects of financial and credit 
counseling for homeless veterans. 
COVID–19 has impacted our economy 
and our lives in many ways. 
The 
most 
recent 
Department 
of 
Housing 
and 
Urban 
Development 
Point-in-Time—or 
the 
PIT—count 
found that, on a single night in Janu-
ary of 2020, an estimated 37,252 veterans 
were homeless. 
We must do everything we can to 
help eliminate veteran homelessness 
and prevent those who have worn the 
uniform of our country from having to 
worry about where they will lay their 
head at night. 
This bill, which I am proud to sup-
port, would direct the VA to conduct a 
comprehensive study on the financial 
and 
credit 
counseling 
services 
for 
homeless veterans. 
This study would use data from the 
Supportive Services for Veterans Fam-
ilies—or the SSVF—program to look at 
barriers that homeless veterans are 
facing in relation to financial coun-
seling services. 
I thank Congressman PALLONE for his 
hard work on crafting this bill and for 
his continued support of our Nation’s 
veterans. 
This bill, as amended, also includes 
some technical changes to the omnibus 
bill that was signed into law earlier 
this year that were requested by the 
Committee on Appropriations. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), my good 
friend, the author of this critical piece 
of legislation, and also the chairman of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman of the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee, my friend from 
California, for moving this bill through 
the committee as quickly as he did. 
I rise today in support of the bill, 
H.R. 1257, the Homeless Veterans Cred-
it Repair, Enhancement, and Debt Im-
provement for Tomorrow Act. 
We know that veterans’ homelessness 
continues to be a blight on our Nation. 
Congress and advocates from across the 
country have worked hard to nearly 
halve the homeless veteran population 
in the past decade. 
Unfortunately, the coronavirus pan-
demic jeopardized this progress by neg-
atively impacting the credit and finan-
cial stability of our Nation’s veterans. 
b 1430 
Now is the time to redouble our ef-
forts and do everything we can to en-
sure stable housing for veterans. We 
must start by examining the under-
lying causes of veteran homelessness in 
our Nation. 
The VA has declared credit and fi-
nancial counseling services a top 10 
unmet need for our homeless veterans. 
My bill directs the Secretary of the VA 
to conduct a study of the credit and fi-
nancial counseling services available 
to homeless veterans and veterans fac-
ing housing instability. The study will 
assess current services available to vet-
erans and the barriers they face in uti-
lizing them, including the COVID–19 
pandemic and other health challenges. 
During a time of such economic un-
certainty, we must look out for our

most vulnerable communities, includ-
ing homeless veterans and veterans ex-
periencing 
housing 
instability. 
We 
have a responsibility to help those who 
served in uniform and stood ready to 
make the ultimate sacrifice for our 
country. 
The CREDIT Act will identify the 
credit and financial counseling services 
needed to help our veterans avoid fi-
nancial pitfalls and make informed de-
cisions about their future. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, 
I 
thank 
Chairman TAKANO for his partnership 
on this issue, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this commonsense, bipar-
tisan legislation. Together, we can im-
prove veterans’ financial literacy to 
build a better life for themselves after 
they complete their service to our 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank my 
staff member, Jake Freed, who basi-
cally came up with this idea, after 
talking to various veterans groups, and 
put this together. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, we 
know that preventing homelessness is 
especially critical as we try to emerge 
out of this pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support Chairman PAL-
LONE’s bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 1257, the 
Homeless Veterans Credit Act, and would like 
my good friend Chairman PALLONE for his 
work to bring this bill to the floor. 
The freedom and luxuries that we are af-
forded on a daily basis are made possible by 
the sacrifices of our men and women in uni-
form. It is unthinkable that, after returning 
home from serving our country, veterans are 
often faced with several challenges including a 
lack of accessibility to quality and affordable 
housing. The state of Texas is home to the 
second largest population of veterans in the 
United States, and veterans homelessness is 
becoming an increasingly prevalent issue in 
our communities. 
That is why I am proud to support the 
Homeless Veterans Credit Act. This bill will di-
rect the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
conduct a study on the effectiveness of finan-
cial and credit counseling services currently 
available to homeless veterans and how those 
services can be improved so these veterans 
can move a step closer to securing stable 
housing, employment and income. Such stud-
ies are critical for us as legislators to deter-
mine the efficiency of the institutions, pro-
grams, and funding levels in place to assist 
veterans. 
As Chair of the Congressional Homeless-
ness Caucus, I remain committed to advo-
cating on behalf of veterans experiencing 
homelessness and housing insecurity. This 
pandemic has brought to light the stark inequi-
ties in access to housing for veterans, but I 
am confident that this bill will set the stage for 
transformative efforts to reform care for those 
in need. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting in 
favor of this bipartisan, commonsense legisla-
tion and would urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1257, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to direct the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a 
study on the effect of financial and 
credit counseling for homeless veterans 
and veterans experiencing housing in-
stability, and for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f

ability of the law enforcement oper-
ations of the Department of Veterans

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to insert 
extraneous material on H.R. 2429. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to sup-
port H.R. 2429, the VA Police Improve-
ment and Accountability Act, intro-
duced by former Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs member Representative 
RICE from New York. 
This bipartisan legislation cospon-
sored by Representative RADEWAGEN 
would improve the transparency and 
accountability of the VA police. Spe-
cifically, the legislation would require 
the VA police to publish online infor-
mation about arrests and use of force, 
as well as establish a consistent way 
for the public to obtain more detailed 
information about those incidents. 
Importantly, this bill would also re-
quire VA to have its police use body- 
worn cameras, publish guidance on the 
use of such cameras, improve tracking 
and analysis of arrests and other police 
actions, and develop a staffing plan 
that adequately supports every VA fa-
cility’s needs. Together, these improve-
ments will build accountability and 
trust between the VA police and any-
one who walks through VA facility 
doors across the country. 
H.R. 2429 was reported favorably by 
the committee, and I ask my col-
leagues to join me in supporting the 
VA Police Improvement and Account-
ability Act. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2429, the VA Police Im-
provement and Accountability Act. 
This bill represents months of bipar-
tisan work by the committee. I thank 
my colleagues for their efforts. 
This bill would increase transparency 
and accountability in the VA police 
force by requiring each officer to wear 
a body-worn camera. It would also re-
quire VA to make police statistics pub-
lic and available and report on police 
actions, including arrests and use of 
force. 
Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, the VA 
began modernizing its police force. 
This legislation would support the 
VA’s ongoing efforts. 
Veterans deserve safe environments 
in which to seek the care and benefits 
they have earned. I believe this legisla-
tion and the VA work will help provide 
those safe environments. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Miss RICE), my good 
friend, a former member of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, and the lead 
Democratic cosponsor. 
Miss RICE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
bipartisan bill, the VA Police Improve-
ment and Accountability Act, H.R. 
2429. This bill takes important steps to 
strengthen 
oversight 
and 
account-
ability for VA police and law enforce-
ment operations. 
A number of shortcomings with VA’s 
law enforcement operations were iden-
tified in a hearing held by the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs last 
Congress. Inadequate policing proce-
dures and a lack of true oversight for 
the Department’s police force were two 
of the pressing issues raised at the 
hearing. 
Challenges with management and 
oversight of VA police were also re-
vealed in subsequent reports issued by 
the VA Office of Inspector General and 
the Government Accountability Office. 
These challenges include insufficient 
officer staffing, inappropriate conduct, 
and other concerning issues at VA fa-
cilities across the country. 
On Long Island, I have worked with 
one of my constituents who was hor-
ribly mistreated by the Northport VA 
police. Our veterans deserve much bet-
ter from an agency that is always sup-
posed to be on their side. 
My bill aims to address these press-
ing issues with the VA police by requir-
ing the VA police to implement the use 
of body cameras, improve data collec-
tion and reporting on police incidents 
at VA facilities, and enact other impor-
tant measures to strengthen oversight 
and transparency for VA’s police pro-
gram. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my Repub-
lican 
co-lead, 
Representative 
RADEWAGEN, for joining me on this bill. 
I also thank Chairman TAKANO
and 
Ranking Member BOST for helping to 
bring H.R. 2429 to the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan leg-
islation to help us better serve and pro-
tect our Nation’s veterans. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
urge all my colleagues to support the 
bill of the gentlewoman from New York 
(Miss RICE). 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2429. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

VA FOIA REFORM ACT OF 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2726) to direct the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to establish a plan 
to reduce the backlog of requests for 
information made to the Department 
of Veterans Affairs pursuant to section 
552 of title 5, United States Code, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2726 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA FOIA 
Reform Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. PLAN FOR REDUCTION OF BACKLOG OF 
FOIA REQUESTS. 
(a) PLAN.—The Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs shall establish and carry out a plan for 
the Secretary to meet, by not later than five 
years after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the requirements of section 552 of title 
5, United States Code, with respect to pro-
viding documents and information under 
such section within the timeframes required 
by such section. The plan shall include the 
following: 
(1) Improving and acquiring technology, in-
cluding with respect to searching email and 
other 
electronic 
information, 
and 
the 
timelines for such improvement, to ensure 
that the information technology of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs is capable of 
carrying out the plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2779 
June 15, 2021 
(b) COMPLIANCE

tives and the Senate. 
(d) BACKLOG OF FOIA REQUESTS DEFINED.— 
In this section, the term ‘‘backlog of FOIA 
requests’’ means the number of requests, as 
reported by the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs to the Attorney General in the Annual 
FOIA Report, made by individuals to the 
Secretary pursuant to section 552 of title 5, 
United States Code, for documents or infor-
mation that the Secretary has not fulfilled 
or provided a response to the individual. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
2726. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to sup-
port H.R. 2726, the VA FOIA Reform 
Act of 2021, introduced by Representa-
tive GALLEGO, a member of the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
This bipartisan legislation is cospon-
sored by Representative MURPHY from 
North Carolina and would modernize 
the Department of Veterans Affairs’ 
Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, 
process to help VA meet statutory re-
quirements and improve efficiency. 
The FOIA process is essential for en-
suring a transparent and accountable 
VA by allowing the public insight into 
the workings of a Department that 
serves millions of veterans each year. 
However, an enduring backlog of open 
requests and out-of-date technology 
have made it difficult for the Depart-
ment to provide timely access to re-
quested information. 
Madam Speaker, this bill would re-
quire VA to establish a plan in order to 
meet all statutory FOIA requirements, 
identify its technology needs, and 
carry out this plan within 5 years. 
Veterans and their families, employ-
ees, and the public who have made 
FOIA requests at VA have been kept 
waiting for too long. I hope this bill 
puts VA on a path to providing FOIA 
information in a timely manner. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2726 was re-
ported favorably by the committee, 
and I ask my colleagues to support the 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2726, the VA FOIA Reform 
Act of 2021. 
Madam Speaker, over the last few 
years, VA has worked hard to reduce 
the Freedom of Information Act, or 
FOIA, requests backlog. These efforts 
have achieved some success, but the 
VA still has a long way to go. 
At the end of fiscal year 2020, VA re-
ported 4,206 pending requests. This bill 
would require VA to carry out a plan to 
reduce the backlog and comply with 
existing FOIA requirements. 
It would also require VA to report to 
Congress on a plan and the Depart-
ment’s work. This will help Congress 
oversee VA’s efforts to reduce the 
FOIA backlog and provide additional 
resources that may be necessary. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the bi-
partisan work on this legislation, and I 
encourage my colleagues to support it. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
GALLEGO), 
my 
good 
friend, author of H.R. 2726, and a mem-
ber of the House Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 
2726, the VA FOIA Reform Act. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chair 
TAKANO and Ranking Member BOST for 
bringing this bill to the floor and Rep-
resentative MURPHY for co-leading this 
important legislation with me. 
The bill is a simple, bipartisan meas-
ure to improve efficiency and trans-
parency at the VA. 
As we all know, transparency is crit-
ical in ensuring that the VA is serving 
our veterans as effectively as possible. 
Veterans, their caregivers, VSOs, and 
the public all deserve easy and timely 
access to information about veteran 
care, VA performance, and other data 
when requested. 
Unfortunately, 
VA 
currently 
has 
among the worst backlogs of Freedom 
of Information Act requests across 
Federal agencies. Among these back-
logged requests are inquiries about VA 
performance and decisions, as well as 
requests from veterans for their own 
personal records. 
My bill will ensure that the VA takes 
concrete steps to reduce its FOIA back-
logs so that these veterans get an-
swers. It also calls for the National Ar-
chives and Records Administration to 
review VA’s FOIA process. 
Finally, the bill requires the VA to 
analyze the root causes of its FOIA 
backlog and to identify technology 
needs and procedural improvements 
that will increase efficiency in re-
sponding to requests. 
This straightforward bill is a com-
monsense step toward improving the 
flow of information from the VA to all 
the stakeholders it serves. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support it today, and I look 
forward to working to get it signed 
into law. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to close by saying I urge all 
of my colleagues to support the VA 
FOIA Reform Act of 2021. We need to 
make sure that our veterans and their 
families get information that they 
have requested from the VA in a timely 
manner. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2726. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2780 
June 15, 2021 
SECTION 1. ROLE OF DOCTORS OF PODIATRIC 
MEDICINE IN DEPARTMENT OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS. 
(a) CLARIFICATION OF ROLE.—Section 7306 of 
title 38, United States Code, is amended— 
(1) in subsection (a)— 
(A) in paragraph (6), by striking ‘‘a Direc-
tor of Podiatric Service,’’; 
(B) by redesignating paragraph (10) as 
paragraph (11); and 
(C) by inserting after paragraph (9) the fol-
lowing new paragraph: 
‘‘(10) A Podiatric Medical Director, who 
shall be a qualified doctor of podiatric medi-
cine and who shall be responsible to the 
Under Secretary for Health for the operation 
of the Podiatric Service.’’; 
(2) 
in 
subsection 
(b)(1), 
by 
inserting 
‘‘podiatric medicine,’’ after ‘‘doctors of med-
icine,’’; and 
(3) in subsection (c), by striking ‘‘and (8)’’ 
and inserting ‘‘(8), and (10)’’. 
(b) CLARIFICATION OF PAY GRADE.—Section 
7404 of title 38, United States Code, is amend-
ed— 
(1) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting ‘‘, po-
diatrists,’’ after ‘‘physicians’’ ; and 
(2) in subsection (b), in the first heading of 
the list following the colon, by striking ‘‘PO-
DIATRIST’’ and inserting ‘‘PODIATRIST 
(DPM)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2545. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to sup-
port H.R. 2545 to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to clarify the role of doc-
tors of podiatric medicine in the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs, and for 
other purposes. 
H.R. 2545 is offered by former Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee member, Dr. 
BRAD WENSTRUP. This legislation seeks 
to clarify a technical error affecting 
the Director of Podiatric Services 
which developed following the inclu-
sion of Dr. WENSTRUP’s VA Provider 
Equity Act in the MISSION Act. 
The renaming of the position to 
Podiatric Medical Director will create 
equity by allowing this position holder 
to be paid on par with their peers rath-
er than below, which is currently the 
case. 
If VA is to recruit top talent, we 
must ensure VA is able to offer com-
petitive salaries whenever possible, 
that is why I support this legislation 
and I hope my colleagues will too. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2545, a bill that would clar-
ify the role of podiatrists in the VA 
health system. Podiatrists are increas-
ingly called upon to care for veterans 
in the VA medical facilities. 
This bill would make a technical cor-
rection to current law to ensure that 
they are properly compensated for 
their important work. 
This 
bill 
is 
sponsored 
by 
Dr. 
WENSTRUP. Dr. WENSTRUP is a veteran, 
a podiatrist, and a former member of 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I am 
grateful for his continued commitment 
to those who he serves. 
Madam Speaker, I urge every Mem-
ber of the Chamber to join me and Dr. 
WENSTRUP and the chairman in sup-
porting this bill today, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers and I am pre-
pared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I encour-
age everyone to support this piece of 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
urge all my colleagues to support the 
legislation and join me in passing H.R. 
2545, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2545. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

VA HOSPITALS ESTABLISHING 
LEADERSHIP PERFORMANCE ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 293) to direct the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to establish qualifica-
tions for the human resources positions 
within the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 293 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA Hos-
pitals Establishing Leadership Performance 
Act’’.

HUMAN 
RE-
SOURCES POSITIONS WITHIN THE

ADMINISTRA-
TION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT
OF
QUALIFICATIONS.— 
Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs shall— 
(1) establish qualifications for each human 
resources 
position 
within 
the 
Veterans 
Health Administration of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs; 
(2) 
establish 
standardized 
performance 
metrics for each such position; and 
(3) submit to Congress a report containing 
the qualifications and standardized perform-
ance metrics established under paragraphs 
(1) and (2). 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the establishment of the qualifications and 
performance metrics under subsection (a), 
the Comptroller General of the United States 
shall submit to the Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs of the 
Senate a report containing— 
(1) a description of the implementation of 
such qualifications and performance metrics; 
and 
(2) an assessment of the quality of such 
qualifications and performance metrics. 
SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED. 
No additional funds are authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out the requirements 
of this Act. Such requirements shall be car-
ried out using amounts otherwise authorized 
to be appropriated. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 293. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to sup-
port H.R. 293, the VA Hospitals Estab-
lishing Leadership Performance Act, 
introduced by our committee’s ranking 
member, Mr. BOST. 
This bill would require VA to estab-
lish qualifications and performance 
metrics for human resources positions 
within the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration. This legislation follows a 2017 
Government Accountability Office re-
port that found human capital process 
deficiencies, such as a lack of perform-
ance metrics for certain positions. 
GAO 
concluded 
that 
these 
defi-
ciencies negatively affected VA’s abil-
ity to serve veterans. The legislation 
does not specify what metrics VA must 
use, but leaves that determination up 
to VA. Instituting these human re-
source management improvements at 
VA is a commonsense, good–govern-
ment step. 
H.R. 293 was favorably reported by 
the committee, and I ask my col-
leagues to join me in supporting the 
VA Hospitals Establishing Leadership 
Performance Act. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2781 
June 15, 2021 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 293, VA Hospitals Estab-
lishing Leadership Performance Act. I 
believe that a high-performing organi-
zation needs to have clear qualifica-
tions and metrics by which they can 
measure success. Without them, orga-
nizations lose their way. 
That is why I am proud to have, once 
again, introduced the VA Hospital Es-
tablishing 
Leadership 
Performance 
Act. My bill would require VA to estab-
lish standardized qualifications and 
performance metrics for each human 
resource position within the Veterans 
Health Administration. 
A few years ago, the committee 
found that certain HR professionals 
working in the VA healthcare system 
did not have the proper education or 
experience for the jobs that they held. 
For example, one HR director at a 
medical center lacked both a college 
degree and relevant work experience 
when hired for the job. This bill would 
make sure that that does not happen 
again by requiring HR staff to be quali-
fied and equipped to handle VA’s com-
plex human resources needs. 
During the 115th Congress, this bill 
passed the House by a vote of 417–0. I 
hope that it, again, gains that type of 
support with this entire Chamber. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support my bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further questions, and I am 
prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill,

States Code, to render an individual, 
who transfers certain educational as-
sistance, to which the individual is en-
titled because of an agreement by such 
individual to serve in the Armed 
Forces, to a dependent of that indi-
vidual, and who fails to complete such 
agreement, solely liable for the over-
payment of such educational assist-
ance, as amended.

resentatives of the United States of America in

SECTION 1. SOLE LIABILITY FOR TRANSFERRED 
EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE BY AN 
INDIVIDUAL WHO FAILS TO COM-
PLETE A SERVICE AGREEMENT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (i) of section 
3319 of title 38, United States Code, is amend-
ed— 
(1) in paragraph (1)—

ing ‘‘Subject to paragraph (2), in the event’’; 
and

(B) by inserting ‘‘for which the individual 
shall be solely liable to the United States for 
the amount of the overpayment for purposes 
of section 3685 of this title’’ before the period 
at the end; and

ment of this Act. 
SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory

mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-

from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 290, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the eligibility for 
veterans to transfer their earned edu-
cational benefits is limited based on 
service time and commitments to addi-
tional service time. Recently, there 
have been a number of cases where 
DOD erroneously calculated service-
members’ time in service, allowing the 
servicemember to transfer a benefit 
when they should not have, as in the 
case of Russell Dotson. 
In Mr. Dotson’s case, he was told by 
the Navy that he was able to transfer 
his benefit to his daughter. Unfortu-
nately, the Navy was 6 days off in its 
calculation. That led to his daughter’s 
GI Bill-covered tuition at DePaul Uni-
versity being cut off. Now, she and her 
father, a veteran who served 22 years 
and was honored for saving two lives in 
Afghanistan, are left having to repay 
more than $20,000. 
As a result of these errors, the vet-
eran and their dependent are saddled 
with a huge bill, that is overpayment, 
for the cost of erroneously billed edu-
cational costs. The debt levied on the 
dependent is costly and can ruin their 
credit before they enter the labor force, 
which could impact their housing and 
job opportunities. 
H.R. 290, as amended, limits liabil-
ities to ensure that there aren’t sur-
prise debts created by errors in paper-
work. This legislation has been sup-
ported by VSOs such as the VFW, 
American Legion, and the Student Vet-
erans of America. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking 
Member BOST
for his work on this 
issue. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
supporting H.R. 290, as amended, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 290, as amended, 
to create a sole liability for GI Bill 
payments during transfer in certain 
cases. This bill would hold a service-
member liable should they transfer the 
GI Bill entitlement but fail to com-
plete their service obligation. 
The GI Bill is a fantastic benefit. The 
GI Bill has helped tens of thousands of 
veterans and their families obtain a 
higher education. Some servicemem-
bers are eligible to transfer their GI 
Bill entitlement to a dependent. They 
can do this once they have completed 6 
years of active service and agree to 
serve an additional 4 years. 
Under my bill, if the servicemember 
begins to transfer the entitlement at 
the 6-year mark but fails to complete 
the additional 4 years of the required 
service, their dependent would not be 
held liable for overpayments. This 
would help dependents avoid unex-
pected VA debt for actions outside of 
their control. Some overpayments can 
total hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
It is only right that we ensure that 
they are assigned to the right person. 
Madam Speaker, I thank our VSO 
partners, especially those at the Trag-
edy Assistance Program for Survivors 
for bringing this issue to my attention.

HARLEM 
HELLFIGHTERS 
CON-
GRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3642) to award a Congres-
sional gold medal to the 369th Infantry 
Regiment, commonly known as the 
‘‘Harlem Hellfighters’’, in recognition 
of their bravery and outstanding serv-
ice during World War I, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3642 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Harlem 
Hellfighters Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) When the United States officially en-
tered World War I in April 1917, the Armed 
Forces were still segregated, even though Af-
rican-American soldiers had served and dis-
tinguished themselves in every war since the 
Revolutionary War, and even the Colonial 
Wars preceding the American Revolution. 
(2) After several years of advocacy and de-
bate, in 1916 the State of New York author-
ized the recruitment of the 15th New York 
National Guard Regiment, which was called 
to Federal service on July 25, 1917, soon after 
arriving for training at Camp Whitman, New 
York. 
(3) The 15th completed its basic military 
practice training at Camp Whitman, New 
York. 
(4) To receive combat training, the 15th re-
ported, on October 8, 1917, to Camp Wads-
worth, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, 
where it experienced many incidents of ra-
cial discrimination. 
(5) Consequently, the government agreed 
to remove the 15th from Camp Wadsworth, 
but, instead of receiving further training, 
the regiment began preparing for deploy-
ment to France in November. 
(6) The 15th arrived in Saint Nazaire, 
France, on January 1, 1918, where it was re-
designated the 369th Infantry Regiment 
(7) Partly because many White soldiers 
within the American Expeditionary Forces 
(hereinafter, the ‘‘AEF’’) refused to perform 
combat duty with Black soldiers, members of 
the 369th were initially assigned manual 
labor tasks, such as loading and unloading 
supplies, and constructing roads and rail-
roads. 
(8) After receiving pressure from the 369th 
regimental commander about not having a 
combat mission, the AEF attached the 369th 
to the French Fourth Army. 
(9) By mid-March of 1918, the 369th went to 
the Argonne Forest with the French 16th Di-
vision for training and soon entered the 
trenches. 
(10) The 369th encountered its first German 
soldiers in combat in April, 1918. 
(11) In May of 1918, Private Henry Johnson 
of the 369th received the French Croix de 
Guerre, with Palm, for extraordinary valor, 
becoming one of the first American soldiers 
to be awarded this honor. 
(12) Johnson also belatedly received a Pur-
ple Heart, was awarded the Distinguished 
Service Cross, and in, 2015, was awarded the 
Medal of Honor. 
(13) Throughout the remainder of the 
spring and into the summer the 369th served 
at Minacourt, in the Champagne-Marne De-
fensive, and during the Aisne-Marne Offen-
sive in support of the French 161st Infantry 
Division. 
(14) As summer turned to autumn, the 
369th went on to participate in the Meuse- 
Argonne offensive, where it captured the im-
portant village of Sechault despite sus-
taining severe losses. 
(15) On October 14, 1918, the 369th advanced 
to Alsace. 
(16) On November 20, 1918, the 369th reached 
the banks of the Rhine River as part of the 
French Army of Occupation, the first Allied 
unit to do so. 
(17) The 369th was relieved of its assign-
ment with the French 161st Division in De-
cember, 1918, and elements of the regiment 
sailed for New York in late January and 
early February, 1919. 
(18) The 369th Infantry Regiment received 
a parade up 5th Avenue in New York City on 
February 17, 1919, receiving applause and 
cheers from hundreds of thousands of on-
lookers. 
(19) The 369th was demobilized on February 
28, 1919. 
(20) Over 170 individual members of the 
369th received the Croix de Guerre, many 
were awarded the Distinguished Service 
Cross, and the 369th was awarded a unit cita-
tion. 
(21) It is generally believed that the 369th 
was dubbed the ‘‘Harlem Hellfighters’’ by 
German soldiers, who found the men to be 
incredibly determined and courageous in 
battle. 
(22) The 369th was the first regiment of Af-
rican Americans to deploy overseas during 
World War I and spent 191 days on the front 
line in World War I, more than any other 
American regimental sized unit. 
(23) The 369th never lost a foot of ground 
nor had a man taken prisoner, despite suf-
fering a high number of casualties. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the award, on

(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Smithsonian Institution

ant to this Act available for display else-
where, particularly at other locations associ-
ated with the Harlem Hellfighters. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary may strike

tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the soldiers of the 
369th Infantry Regiment were known 
to both their enemies and allies alike 
for their fierceness in battle and dedi-
cation to their country. They were 
called the Black Rattlers, the Men of 
Bronze, and Hollenkampfer, but they 
were 
best 
known 
as 
the 
Harlem 
Hellfighters. 
The Harlem Hellfighters were one of 
the first African-American regiments

to serve with the American Expedi-
tionary Forces in World War I. Over 
the course of the war, the Harlem 
Hellfighters spent more time than any 
other American unit in the frontline 
trenches and suffered 1,500 casualties— 
the most losses of any American unit. 
In addition to facing the dangers of 
frontline trench warfare, the men of 
the Harlem Hellfighters endured racist, 
derogatory attacks from their White 
compatriots, many of whom refused to 
perform combat duty with African- 
American soldiers. This resulted in the 
Harlem Hellfighters being transferred 
to a French Army where, despite racist 
warnings from American Expeditionary 
Forces headquarters of the alleged in-
ferior 
nature 
of 
African-American 
troops, the Harlem Hellfighters were 
treated as welcome reinforcements and 
equals. 
Despite the racism and derogatory 
attacks from their fellow countrymen, 
the Harlem Hellfighters were steadfast 
in their devotion to their country. 
Some members considered their service 
to be a way to prove they deserved re-
spect from their White compatriots. 
Even German propaganda targeting the 
Harlem Hellfighters highlighting the 
racism of a segregated U.S. military 
failed to diminish their resolve. 
Yet, despite their considerable sac-
rifices and being awarded the Croix de 
Guerre by the French Army for their 
efforts, the Harlem Hellfighters contin-
ued to face considerable racism when 
they returned home after World War I. 
Their bravery and accomplishments 
were similarly ignored by the broader 
American public. But their legacy and 
memory has been kept alive in their 
hometown. 
The 
annual 
Harlem 
Hellfighters Parade in Harlem, New 
York, became a marker of African- 
American service to their Nation, and 
their service was frequently referenced 
as part of the civil rights campaign. 
This bill directs the U.S. Mint to 
strike a Congressional Gold Medal hon-
oring the Harlem Hellfighters for their 
service during World War I. The gold 
medal will be displayed at the Smith-
sonian Institution so that others may 
learn of the patriotism and courage 
displayed by the men of the 369th In-
fantry Regiment. 
So, Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. 
SUOZZI for introducing this bill. I urge 
Members to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3642, a bill that awards a Congres-
sional Gold Medal to the 369th Infantry 
Regiment commonly known as the 
Harlem Hellfighters. This gold medal is 
in recognition of their bravery and out-
standing service during World War I. 
I would like to thank Congressman 
SUOZZI and the numerous original co-
sponsors for getting this important bill 
to the floor today. 
I have heard from constituents who 
had family members and I have heard 
from folks from around the country 
about the importance of our recog-
nizing this heroic group of—at that 
point—men. The 369th Infantry Regi-
ment 
nicknamed 
the 
Harlem 
Hellfighters were the first African- 
American infantry unit to fight in 
World War I. They were also one of the 
most decorated. 
This is extraordinary. They became 
one of the most feared units fighting 
for the Allies in World War I, and they 
were 
notorious 
for 
never 
yielding 
ground to their enemies. This is ex-
traordinary. 
Their name, Harlem Hellfighters, 
which was given to them by the Ger-
mans, is reflective of that reputation. 
That was a hard-won reputation that 
they had, and that name is synony-
mous with the fear that produced in 
our enemies. They fearlessly spent 191 
consecutive days on the front lines, 
which was more time in combat than 
any other American unit during the 
Great War—during World War I. 
Additionally, I would be remiss if I 
did not point out that at least 249 
North Carolina-born African-American 
men served in this prestigious unit. 
These brave sons of Carolina fought 
valiantly just west of the Argonne For-
est in defense of an outpost against a 
German raiding party. During this con-
flict, 
four 
North 
Carolinian 
Hellfighters were wounded, including 
Sergeant Henry Johnson, a native of 
Winston-Salem that I have the honor 
to represent. 
Not only were these men fierce fight-
ers, they were also instrumental in in-
fluencing art and culture, including in-
troducing jazz to Europe, and for that 
the Europeans should be grateful. 
Their leader, James Reese Europe, di-
rected their regimental band to inter-
national acclaim. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
Harlem 
Hellfighters of World War I deserve a 
Congressional Gold Medal as the high-
est recognition of national apprecia-
tion. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill. I am grateful for the bipar-
tisan nature of this bill and also bring-
ing attention to the valiant soldiers 
who protected us during the Great War, 
especially this very special decorated 
unit of intense fighters but fantastic 
humans. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. SUOZZI) who is also the 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, today 
we have the opportunity to begin to 
right a century-old wrong. I rise to 
support the creation of a Congressional 
Gold Medal in honor of the Harlem 
Hellfighters. 
Thousands of Harlem Hellfighters 
were African-American soldiers who 
signed up to join the U.S. Army in 
World War I. Sadly, but predictably, 
White soldiers were unwilling to serve 
alongside Black soldiers, and these 
brave men were assigned to join the 
French Army. But that didn’t stop 
them. 
The Harlem Hellfighters, wearing 
U.S. uniforms but issued weapons and 
helmets by the French, went on to face 
more combat time than any other regi-
ment during World War I. No Harlem 
Hellfighter was captured as a prisoner 
of war, and they never gave up any 
ground. 
The bravery, dedication, and sac-
rifices of the Harlem Hellfighters who 
served 191 days under near-constant 
enemy fire impacted the outcome of 
World War I, but instead of receiving a 
hero’s welcome, they returned home to 
racism and race-fueled violence. 
There were three dozen Hellfighters 
who came from my hometown of Glen 
Cove. In 2019 the family of Sergeant Le-
ander Willett came to tell me about 
their father and grandfather. He had 
served in France and had been stabbed 
by a German bayonet and been the vic-
tim of mustard gas attacks, but never 
received a Purple Heart. He returned 
home and died in 1956 without ever 
being properly recognized and honored 
for his service to our country. He 
joined his fellow comrades who have 
been lost to history. 
In November of 2019 we surprised the 
Willett family with a posthumous Pur-
ple Heart for Sergeant Willett for 
wounds received as a result of hostile 
actions in France on October 4, 1918. 
I then approached my colleague 
ADRIANO
ESPAILLAT, who represents 
Harlem, and the chairwoman of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, JOYCE 
BEATTY, about collaborating together 
to attain a Congressional Gold Medal. 
They both immediately and enthu-
siastically agreed. We went on to ob-
tain 310 bipartisan cosponsors of this 
bill and expect strong support today. 
I would like to especially thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for her and the 
Financial Services Committee’s sup-
port. On behalf of the Willett family, 
the families of dozens of Harlem 
Hellfighters from my hometown, and a 
grateful Nation, we say thank you to 
this body for putting aside partisanship 
and helping to right a century-old 
harm. It is never too late to do the 
right thing. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman SUOZZI
for his 
leadership on this bill and for working 
with me on this fight for justice. I also 
want to thank Chairwoman WATERS 
and Ranking Member MCHENRY
for 
working with us to get this bill out of 
the committee. 
Today, I rise in support of this bill to 
honor a group of brave men who have 
yet to receive their due commendation: 
the Harlem Hellfighters. 
This distinguished group of African- 
American and Puerto Rican men were 
patriots of the highest valor. Their 
bravery, dedication, perseverance, and

service helped the United States and 
our Allied forces in our fight to secure 
victory. But, Madam Speaker, these 
fighters weren’t even permitted to 
serve alongside their fellow White sol-
diers. Our government threw them to 
the side—assigning them to a unit of 
the French Government rather than 
our own. 
They put their lives on the line for 
the freedoms enshrined in our Con-
stitution, despite doing so at a time 
when many like them did not enjoy the 
very freedoms they fought to protect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from New York an 
additional 1 minute. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
these men spent 191 days in combat and 
were 
the 
most 
active 
regiment 
throughout the entire First World War. 
Under constant enemy fire and cast 
away from the nation they swore an 
oath to protect, they still persevered, 
fighting until the end. 
There is no doubt that their heroism 
impacted the outcome of the war and, 
undoubtedly, American history as well. 
This bill is a necessary first step to 
righting the decades-old injustice. It is 
about time the Harlem Hellfighters’ in-
valuable contributions be commended 
and commemorated, and their service 
be formally recognized by our govern-
ment. Let’s finally give these men the 
Congressional Gold Medal they deserve. 
b 1515 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman WATERS for man-
aging this time. 
To the gentleman from New York, 
what an honor it is for me to stand on 
this House floor as chair of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, as a Black 
woman, to urge my colleagues to sup-
port the Harlem Hellfighters Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act. 
We have heard so much about them, 
and I am proud to join them, giving 
them the recognition that they de-
serve. These men of this segregated 
unit fought bravely in the First World 
War and distinguished themselves in 
battle across France. The men of the 
369th Infantry Regiment, the Harlem 
Hellfighters, are an important chapter 
in the long history of Black Americans 
serving our country. 
So often we talk about Black history, 
but it is important to know that Black 
history is American history. And, 
today, we stand here united as Ameri-
cans, Democrats, Republicans, asking 
our colleagues to make sure that we 
recognize the Harlem Hellfighters for 
the great work, the great bravery, for 
what they did for this country. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire if there are additional speak-
ers? I am prepared to close. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
There is an extraordinary story to 
tell about the American Armed Forces. 
There is an extraordinary story to tell 
about African Americans in our Armed 
Forces in the United States. 
The Harlem Hellfighters were rep-
resentative 
of 
a 
really 
amazing 
achievement during the war to end all 
wars, World War I. But there are also 
stories before this. That was not the 
first group of African Americans to 
fight to defend our Nation. 
It was not the Civil War where Afri-
can Americans fought for our Nation 
for the first time. It was not. It was ac-
tually our liberation from Great Brit-
ain. It was George Washington’s army 
that had African Americans serving 
alongside other Americans to liberate 
us from Great Britain. 
Our founding of this Nation is one of 
a 
multiracial, 
multiethnic, 
multi-
lingual, amazing group of folks who 
wanted the same things, which is free-
dom to make decisions for themselves 
and for their families. And it was that 
first 
integrated 
army, 
which 
was 
George Washington’s army, the Conti-
nental Army, that begat the African 
Americans who served alongside other 
Americans in the Civil War. 
And, sadly, that established capacity 
was lost for two generations before the 
Great War, and the Harlem Hellfighters 
showed the American people that Afri-
can Americans can fight just as well as 
any other American, and, in fact, do 
better in unmitigated harsh treatment 
on the front lines of the biggest war 
that anyone thought they would ever 
see in their lifetimes; which then said, 
during World War II, actually, we are 
all 
in 
this 
together; 
which 
then 
changed the whole face of the 20th cen-
tury. 
So what the Harlem Hellfighters rep-
resent to us in this debate is not just 
the good work of the Congressional del-
egation from New York, or Congress-
man SUOZZI in bringing this to the 
floor today, but giving us the oppor-
tunity to highlight what this genera-
tion of men showed to the American 
people and to our allies in Europe 
about who we are as Americans. 
So for us to honor the Harlem 
Hellfighters today has given us the op-
portunity to recognize 100 years of 
progress. Not even progress, not fulfill-
ment of every dream that we have as 
Americans, not perfect, not perfect, 
but a whole hell of a lot better than we 
were 100 years ago when these Harlem 
Hellfighters showed the world not just 
what America is about, but specifically 
what African Americans were about 
and their capacity. Not just capacity 
to fight, but to be smart, to be capable, 
to deliver results, to be the best, the 
best. 
So the last hundred years, you can go 
back to that generation of Harlem 
Hellfighters and you can see what they 
brought to the public and the under-
standing that they brought over the 
last hundred years, and it made us bet-
ter. 
So for us to have this opportunity to 
recognize them also lets us recognize 
ourselves as a country and who we are, 
and to actually say, you know, it is 
pretty amazing. We have an amazing 
country. And these men who fought 
and died—many who died—they loved 
their country. They love their country 
and they are willing to not just support 
it with words like I am right now, but 
with their lives. 
So, with a grateful heart, I say thank 
you to Congressman SUOZZI and his 
constituents for bringing this debate to 
the floor. 
I want to thank my colleagues for 
doing this in a very wide, bipartisan 
way, and giving us the opportunity to 
have a broader look at history and the 
greatness of the last century and the 
improvement that we have as a result 
of what they broke through over 100 
years ago in the Argonne Forest. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I certainly want to thank 
Mr. SUOZZI for bringing forward this 
legislation. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Mr. 
ESPAILLAT and Congresswoman BEATTY 
for joining with him to bring this legis-
lation forward. I want to thank Mr. 
MCHENRY and the members of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee for joining 
together in support of this legislation. 
The Harlem Hellfighters braved long 
deployments, treacherous conditions, 
and the scorn of their fellow patriots. 
So we find ourselves, I guess, 100 years 
later or so, understanding the impor-
tant role that they played and the sac-
rifices that they made. 
We also understand how important it 
is for all of us to not only give recogni-
tion to their sacrifice, but also recog-
nize 
that 
this 
country 
has 
gone 
through some very difficult times, 
faced with the question of race. 
Despite the fact that we have seen 
times in this country when we were 
moving forward and we thought we 
were erasing the kind of racism that 
had been present for too long, we find 
ourselves today fighting some of the 
same battles. 
There are many in the history of this 
country who have made sacrifices in so 
many different ways that perhaps will 
never be recognized. But I am hopeful, 
with the cooperation, the cosponsor-
ship, and the work for both sides of the 
aisle on a recognition such as this, that 
this will help us to continue to fight to 
rid this country of racism and discrimi-
nation and hatred. 
I am hopeful that the word will go 
forward today about this recognition 
that we are giving to the Harlem 
Hellfighters and will inspire others to 
want to praise and honor those who are 
certainly ones who are so committed to

DEBT BONDAGE REPAIR ACT 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2332) to prohibit consumer re-
porting agencies from furnishing a con-
sumer report containing any adverse 
item of information about a consumer 
if such consumer is a victim of traf-
ficking, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

from

woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the Committee on Financial 
Services 
ranking 
member, 
Mr. 
MCHENRY, for introducing H.R. 2332, 
the Debt Bondage Repair Act. 
Over the last year, working in a bi-
partisan manner, the Financial Serv-
ices Committee has been engaged in an 
examination of trafficking issues of all 
types. As we heard at a recent hearing 
that delved into issues of human traf-
ficking, which includes forced labor, 
sex trafficking and organ trafficking, 
victims of trafficking are not only 
abused physically and emotionally, but 
financially also. 
The moving testimony of Reverend 
Dr. Martin Hatcher, an advocate for 
sex trafficking survivors and a survivor 
himself, demonstrated how traffickers 
steal their victims’ identities, open ac-
counts in their names, run up credit 
card debt, purchase large ticket items 
like automobiles, and take out loans 
while pretending to be their victims. 
This financial exploitation is not 
only designed as a stream of finance, 
allowing the traffickers’ operation to 
thrive, but it also inflicts long-term 
harm and asserts control over the vic-
tim. 
This bill, which aims to help sur-
vivors of human trafficking restore 
their credit and gain access to the con-
sumer financial products and services 
that most of us take for granted, is an 
important step in restoring survivors’ 
dignity and financial stability and in 
preventing revictimization. 
Specifically, the bill prohibits credit 
bureaus from including adverse infor-
mation that resulted from human or 
sex trafficking in a victim’s credit re-
port. It directs the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau to develop a process 
to ensure that adverse information 
caused by their traffickers is not in-
cluded in a victim’s credit report. Such 
a process does not exist now and, given 
the importance that credit reports play 
in our economy, it makes it difficult 
for survivors in our communities to get 
a loan or even secure a job. 
As noted by the Survivor Inclusion 
Initiative of the Human Trafficking 
Focus 
Liechtenstein 
Initiative, 
we 
must ‘‘facilitate survivor access to 
basic banking services, such as check-
ing and savings accounts, and help sur-
vivors’ financial recovery to become 
full financial participants in their com-
munities.’’ 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to support this im-
portant bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
b 1530 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 2332, and I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, debt bondage is a 
terrible crime, and many victims find 
themselves trapped in a perpetual 
cycle of forced labor and coerced debt 
because of it. 
Earlier this year, the House Finan-
cial Services Committee held a hearing 
where we focused on the financing of 
human trafficking. This is an area of 
bipartisan cooperation on the House 
Financial Services Committee. I want 
to commend my Democrat colleagues 
for leading this discussion and finding 
time on the committee docket for us to 
continue the conversation we have had 
over the last couple of Congresses. 
In that hearing, we heard from many 
powerful witnesses, including Rev. Dr. 
Marian Hatcher, who is a trafficking 
survivor. Rev. Dr. Hatcher had the 
courage to tell us her story, and be-
cause of it, we now have legislation 
that will help others. 
This is the way Congress is supposed 
to work. We are supposed to listen to 
experts and get ideas out of that on 
how we can construct legislation. Be-
cause of Dr. Hatcher, we know a lot 
more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2786 
June 15, 2021 
Dr. Hatcher, like so many others in 
this country and around the globe, but 
in this country, in particular, fell vic-
tim to human traffickers. Thankfully, 
she was able to escape a terrible situa-
tion and restore her life. 
However, she struggled to reestablish 
herself because of a credit score, which 
was negatively affecting her whole fi-
nancial life. She was affected by loans 
in particular that she was forced to ob-
tain on behalf of her traffickers. 
So not only does she have to go 
through 
the 
emotional 
and 
social 
struggles, but she has this that is a 
weight around her. This is something 
where we can legislate and make her 
life and make the lives of trafficking 
survivors like hers better. 
You see, Madam Speaker, this is 
where traffickers trap a victim into a 
debt cycle. Traffickers will take out 
loans, open businesses, and destroy a 
victim’s credit, which forces them to 
remain a victim until they pay off the 
debt. 
Now, you think this happens in other 
places around the globe. You think 
that this is some other country. No, it 
is here. It is here in our midst, and 
they are doing it through what seems 
like legal means. 
Too often, these victims are never 
able to get out. This is something that 
we have to be aware of and focus on. 
That is where this bill, the Debt 
Bondage Repair Act, comes in. This 
simple, 4-page bill has the potential to 
help thousands of victims every year 
by ensuring that a consumer reporting 
agency may not furnish a credit report 
with adverse information from a severe 
form of trafficking. 
While this does not erase the terrible 
crimes committed against them, it will 
help victims to regain their financial 
freedom and begin to rebuild their 
lives. 
I would like to note that this bill has 
a very tailored rulemaking provision. 
We want to fix this problem. We pro-
vide the CFPB a window of 180 days for 
rulemaking. This should be sufficient 
time to hear from all the stakeholders. 
But it is my hope that they will com-
plete this rulemaking quickly so that 
the victims can get relief as soon as 
possible. 
I would like to thank the many vic-
tim advocates and consumer data in-
dustry representatives who provided 
technical assistance to get this bill 
where it is. 
I would say the difficulty of legis-
lating is that you have to take in folks 
who are on opposite sides of an issue. 
Not that they don’t care about the 
same issue, but you have folks that are 
on one side of a business and those ad-
vocates that see things differently. It 
takes time to bring them together to 
see what is a workable solution, maybe 
not a perfect solution, but a workable 
solution. 
I include in the RECORD statements 
of support from Shared Hope Inter-
national, the National Center on Sex-
ual Exploitation, Rev. Dr. Hatcher her-
self, and the Consumer Data Industry 
Association. 
SHAREDHOPE INTERNATIONAL, 
June 11, 2021. 
Letter of Support for the Debt Bondage Re-
pair Act. 
DEAR
RANKING
MEMBER
MCHENRY
AND 
CONGRESSMEMBERS WAGNER, GONZALEZ, TAY-
LOR, AND HILL: Traffickers financially ben-
efit from exploiting human trafficking vic-
tims through forced labor and commercial 
sex, but also by exploiting their victims’ 
credit history. With credit cards, loan appli-
cations, and access to financial services all 
dependent on an individual’s credit history, 
the impact of this financial exploitation is 
both far reaching and long-term. 
We thank you for taking an important step 
in addressing these harms by introducing 
and sponsoring HR 2332, the Debt Bondage 
Repair Act (DBRA). The DBRA supports traf-
ficking survivors by preventing consumer re-
porting agencies from issuing credit reports 
containing adverse information that resulted 
from a survivor’s victimization. This legisla-
tion is essential to address the long-term im-
pact of human trafficking by eliminating ad-
verse credit history that would otherwise re-
main on a survivor’s credit report. Most im-
portantly, the DBRA provides survivors an 
opportunity for financial independence and 
stability that can help end the cycle of ex-
ploitation. 
Good credit history is essential for opening 
bank accounts, and applying for loans, credit 
cards, insurance, and housing. Credit reports 
are also sometimes necessary for applying 
for student loans, and utility and cellphone 
service contracts. Individuals with adverse 
credit history and low credit scores experi-
ence higher interest rates or denial alto-
gether. 
Traffickers use coercion and control to fi-
nancially exploit their victims in various 
ways. One survivor described her trafficker 
coercing her into obtaining a loan and then 
credit cards by threatening the survivor’s 
family. This left the survivor with poor cred-
it and more than $25,000 in debt. Traffickers 
may also try to access credit that has not 
yet been exploited by intentionally targeting 
younger victims. One survivor recalled a 
trafficker targeting seventeen-year-old girls, 
who were about to turn eighteen because the 
trafficker could exploit their fresh credit by 
having them sign up for credit cards. In addi-
tion, as Rev. Dr. Marian Hatcher powerfully 
recounted in her testimony to the House 
Committee on Financial Services, traffickers 
may also use their victim’s credit to pur-
chase expensive items, such as cars. Traf-
fickers also control their victim’s bank ac-
counts, passwords, and use the victim’s ac-
counts to engage in criminal activities. Con-
sequently, financial institutions may later 
deny the survivor services because of crimi-
nal activity. Traffickers often exploit their 
victim’s credit history at a time when the 
victim is not present in the formal economy 
and unable to build positive credit history. 
Trafficking survivors then experience ad-
verse credit history and burdensome loan ob-
ligations because of their financial exploi-
tation. Consequently, when survivors leave 
their trafficking situations, they often can-
not access financial resources. Trafficking 
survivors report difficulty opening bank ac-
counts and obtaining safe housing, employ-
ment, cars, and cell phones. Access to hous-
ing is especially important to ending the 
cycle of vulnerability and exploitation. In 
one study, 64% of trafficking victims re-
ported that lack of affordable housing pre-
vented them from escaping their trafficking 
situation. Lack of resources may result in 
survivors returning to their exploitative cir-
cumstances. In her testimony to the House 
Committee on Financial Services, Rev. Dr. 
Marian Hatcher testified that lack of re-
sources leads to reexploitation because ‘‘sur-
vivors feel they have no option other than 
returning to the commercial sex industry.’’ 
Also, obstacles to accessing financial re-
sources and student loans may also hinder a 
survivor’s educational aspirations. This neg-
atively impacts the survivor’s academic em-
powerment and long-term goals. Further-
more, survivors may feel stigmatized or em-
barrassed because of their poor credit. By 
preventing a consumer reporting agency 
from reporting adverse information resulting 
from a survivor’s trafficking, the DBRA pre-
vents a survivor’s credit report from becom-
ing an apparatus for continuing victimiza-
tion. 
Poor credit due to financial exploitation 
has long-term impacts on a survivor’s ability 
to access financial resources, build financial 
independence, and navigate life after exploi-
tation. The Debt Bondage Repair Act is cru-
cial to providing trafficking survivors a 
clean slate and path toward financial inde-
pendence. We support this critical legisla-
tion and urge Congress to support trafficking 
survivors by passing the Debt Bondage Re-
pair Act. 
Sincerely, 
CHRISTINE RAINO, 
Senior Director of Public Policy, 
Shared Hope International. 
NCSE LETTER OF SUPPORT 
The National Center on Sexual Exploi-
tation is grateful to Rep. Patrick McHenry 
for introducing HR 2332, the Debt Bondage 
Repair Act (DBRA) and to Survivor Leader 
Marian Hatcher, whose testimony before the 
Financial Services Committee inspired this 
solution. 
H.R. 2332 provides financial relief to vic-
tims of human trafficking by preventing ad-
verse credit reporting of incidents which oc-
curred while being trafficked. The ability to 
move forward in life after tremendous adver-
sity requires financial well-being along with 
personal well-being. In America, financial 
health depends on good credit. HR 2332 al-
lows victims to put the past behind them and 
seek a much-needed fresh start. It is an ex-
cellent complement to the Trafficking Vic-
tims Protection Act in supporting justice for 
survivors. 
We look forward to working toward pas-
sage of this act as well as continued efforts 
on behalf of trafficking survivors. 
REVEREND DR. MARIAN HATCHER LETTER OF 
SUPPORT: H.R. 2332 
Survivors spend a great deal of time trying 
to heal in ways you would expect; physically, 
mentally, emotionally and spiritually. 
However, another critically important as-
pect of healing is often left unattended and 
impedes the path to holistic health. That as-
pect is financial healing. 
In many cases, the lack of financial 
wellness causes victims to have no option 
but to return to exploitive situations. 
In other circumstances, survivors may be 
held civilly or criminally liable for debt in-
curred during their trafficking. 
Any of these scenarios prevent the life of 
liberty and wholeness that survivors yearn 
for and deserve. 
The Debt Bondage Repair Act will help 
provide survivors with a viable chance at full 
wellbeing, inclusive of financial stability and 
security. 
I strongly support this critical legislation 
and urge Congress to support trafficking sur-
vivors by passing the Debt Bondage Repair 
Act. 
REV. DR. MARIAN HATCHER.

CONSUMER DATA INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, June 14, 2021. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, 
Hon. PATRICK T. MCHENRY, 
Ranking Member, 
Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS
AND RANKING 
MEMBER MCHENRY: I write on behalf of the 
Consumer Data Industry Association in sup-
port of H.R. 2332, the Debt Bondage Repair 
Act. This bill will give victims of human 
trafficking and debt bondage the ability to 
prove that they were victims of human traf-
ficking and financial abuse so they can re-
move that information from their financial 
history. 
This bill will help to address the financial 
trauma victims of human trafficking often 
endure. These victims should not have to 
bear the burden of fraudulent debts and ru-
ined credit from their exploitation as they 
begin to rebuild their lives. Any verified 
fraudulent data on a credit report should be 
removed promptly from credit reports. In 
fact, the current practice credit bureaus fol-
low is to remove any verified fraudulent data 
from reports. This bill will be helpful as it 
will specifically acknowledge in the law that 
these kinds of abuses occur and that the re-
sulting tradelines should be deleted from re-
ports. 
Thank you for your work on this legisla-
tion. 
Sincerely, 
FRANCIS CREIGHTON, 
President & CEO. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Additionally, I would 
like to thank Polaris for their support 
of this legislation. 
This is a great example of what hap-
pens when both parties work together. 
I want to thank Chairwoman WATERS 
for her help and assistance, and her 
staff, the Financial Services Com-
mittee majority Democrat staff, for 
their help with my staff and the Repub-
lican minority staff on the House Fi-
nancial Services Committee. 
We have a bipartisan solution to help 
trafficking victims pick up the pieces 
and begin a new life. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. I think 
this will be helpful to the lives at stake 
and let them rebuild their lives, not 
just financially but rebuild their lives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time until Mr. MCHENRY
yields 
back. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to vote for this 
good bipartisan bill that will help vic-
tims. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has yield-
ed back. 
The gentlewoman from California has 
the only time remaining. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
thought I reserved. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this important measure, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Survivors of human trafficking face 
many obstacles to recovering from the 
physical, 
emotional, 
and 
financial 
abuse inflicted by their traffickers. 
The Debt Bondage Repair Act makes 
strides in assisting them to restore 
their credit and achieve financial re-
integration into their communities. 
Congress can play a leading role in 
helping trafficking survivors to take 
back control. For that reason, I cer-
tainly urge both sides of the aisle to 
join me in supporting this important 
bill. 
I do want to take a moment to thank 
my ranking member, Mr. MCHENRY, for 
the leadership that he has provided on 
trafficking in general and on financial 
trafficking specifically. This is impor-
tant legislation, and I am so pleased to 
be able to work with him, and I am so 
pleased that this bill has bipartisan 
support. I want to thank him for the 
work that he has done and will con-
tinue to do. 
I would also briefly note that sur-
vivors of trafficking are not the only 
individuals who are harmed by our bro-
ken credit reporting system. The sys-
tem serves as a major barrier to eco-
nomic opportunity for so many others. 
So we are going to continue working 
with Mr. MCHENRY, and I have sched-
uled a full committee hearing on June 
29 to further explore these credit re-
porting challenges. I believe that our 
Republican colleagues will join with us 
to advance bold solutions to make the 
system fair for all of our constituents. 
Again, I am so pleased that the mem-
bers of the committee have worked to-
gether. I urge my colleagues to support 
H.R. 2332, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2332, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the gentleman from New York, 
Representative TORRES, for his leader-
ship on H.R. 1443, the LGBTQ Business 
Equal Credit Enforcement and Invest-
ment Act. 
We know transparency is critical in 
helping identify discriminatory lending 
practices in the financial marketplace. 
This bill would enhance a provision of 
Dodd-Frank requiring data collection 
on lending to small and minority- 
owned businesses to include data on 
lending to LGBTQ-owned businesses as 
well, including self-reported gender 
identity and sexual orientation. 
This bill will also define an LGBTQ- 
owned business in the Equal Credit Op-
portunity Act, the ECOA, which would 
allow more businesses to gain access to 
capital and investment. 
Of course, June is Pride Month, a 
time to recognize and celebrate the

LGBTQ community’s significant con-
tributions to our country, including to 
the economy, and to also stand as al-
lies. 
We know there is more work to be 
done to ensure equal opportunities. For 
example, according to a study of mort-
gage lending data from 2019, loan appli-
cants in neighborhoods with a higher 
density of LGBTQ people received 
higher interest and fees, regardless of 
the applicant’s sexuality or identity. 
In addition, LGBTQ individuals face 
employment discrimination, which has 
contributed to high rates of poverty, 
especially for LGBTQ people of color. 
The Williams Institute found that 
nearly 31 percent of Black LGBTQ peo-
ple live in poverty compared with near-
ly 25 percent of Black cisgender, 
straight people. 
These factors further support the ur-
gency of supporting LGBTQ businesses 
as they create job opportunities and 
build community wealth. 
As of 2016, there were an estimated 
1.4 million LGBTQ-owned businesses in 
the United States. The CFPB needs to 
begin collecting this data and help us 
as policymakers and the public iden-
tify and understand the community de-
velopment needs of LGBTQ-owned busi-
nesses. 
I am pleased we were able to report 
this bill unanimously out of committee 
with a voice vote. I hope we can build 
on that bipartisan effort, and I urge all 
of my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
We can all agree data is important. 
But we need to recognize, particularly 
as it relates to obtaining data on com-
panies, that each one is unique. Manda-
tory reporting metrics do not accu-
rately measure progress. 
Just look at the mandatory disclo-
sure bills on the floor this week. They 
are a mess. The only outcome we can 
expect to see with those bills is a high-
er compliance cost on companies, leav-
ing fewer resources to build out a 
workforce and invest in research and 
development. 
Simply put, one size does not fit all, 
and one-size-fits-all doesn’t work. 
However, the bill we have in front of 
us today does not impose a new manda-
tory reporting regime. It adds on a list 
of voluntary data and adds a new item 
to that voluntary data. Data is col-
lected on a voluntary basis under 
ECOA, under this law that is being 
amended. Any loan applicant who does 
not wish to provide information can de-
cline to provide it, meaning there are 
fewer concerns over privacy or a one- 
size-fits-all reporting regime. 
These are the things I have raised 
about this bill. I want to commend the 
sponsor for being willing to work with 
Republicans on getting back to the es-
sence of the bill. I appreciate that my 
Democrat colleagues have offered a so-
lution to promote diversity and inclu-
sion without imposing new require-
ments on businesses or business owners 
that do not effectively measure their 
success. 
I support this bill. I will vote for this 
bill. And I want to commend my Demo-
crat colleagues for working with us on 
a number of concerns that we had with 
the various drafts of the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1545 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time we have 
remaining in this debate? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 171⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield all 171⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TORRES), who is 
also the sponsor of this legislation. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, 
H.R. 1443, the LGBTQ Business Equal 
Credit Enforcement and Investment 
Act. 
I want to thank Chairwoman WATERS 
and Ranking Member MCHENRY
for 
their support. As the ranking member 
noted, we did make concessions to ad-
dress his concerns about the legisla-
tion. 
In the United States there are 1.4 
million LGBTQ businesses, contrib-
uting more than $1.7 trillion to the 
American economy. We have a vested 
interest in sustaining and strength-
ening these businesses with equal ac-
cess to credit, which is the beating 
heart of the American economy. 
As a former New York City Council 
member, I partnered with the National 
LGBTQ Chamber of Commerce to es-
tablish the Nation’s largest municipal 
certification program for LGBTQ busi-
ness enterprises, enabling those busi-
nesses to enjoy equal access to a $25 
billion pool of government procure-
ment. 
The legislation before us, H.R. 1443, 
builds on a foundation laid by several 
statutes and regulations. The Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act, most com-
monly known as ECOA, prohibits cred-
it discrimination, including but not 
limited to sex discrimination. A new 
interpretive rule from the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, 
clarifies 
that 
ECOA’s 
prohibition 
against sex discrimination applies to 
sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Section 1071 of Dodd-Frank, which 
exists to enable and enhance the en-
forcement of ECOA, requires financial 
institutions 
to 
report 
information 
about the race, ethnicity, and sex of 
credit applicants who serve as principal 
owners of small businesses. 
My legislation would expand the 1071 
reporting requirements to include not 
only sex but also sexual orientation 
and gender identity. In doing so, it 
would enable antidiscrimination en-
forcement where none might exist. 
Even though the United States has 
made 
substantial 
strides 
toward 
LGBTQ equality, the mission is far 
from accomplished. Seventy percent of 
the LGBTQ community remains unpro-
tected 
by 
antidiscrimination 
laws. 
When it comes to credit in particular, 
according to the Williams Institute, 
more than 7.7 million LGBTQ adults 
live in states that offer no protection 
against discrimination based on sexual 
orientation or gender identity. 
It is often said that knowledge is 
power. Knowledge affords us the power 
to detect discrimination that might 
otherwise go undetected. Take as an 
example the Home Mortgage Disclo-
sure Act, which is analogous to the leg-
islation before us. Both the National 
Community 
Reinvestment 
Coalition 
and Iowa State University reviewed 
data from the HMDA and found that 
same-sex couples were denied loans at 
higher rates than heterosexual couples 
despite 
having 
comparable 
credit-
worthiness. It also found that those 
same-sex couples paid higher fees and 
interest. The experience of HMDA tells 
us that sunlight can be a powerful dis-
infectant against discrimination. 
H.R. 1443 would make credit more ac-
cessible, credit laws more enforceable, 
and creditors more accountable. It 
would represent a triumph of trans-
parency in the service of economic op-
portunity for all, regardless of who you 
are and whom you love. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
The LGBTQ Business Equal Credit 
Enforcement and Investment Act led 
by Representative TORRES would help 
ensure that LGBTQ business owners 
have access to opportunities to grow 
and invest through government and 
other private procurement contracts as 
well as have equal access to credit op-
portunities. 
This bill is supported by the National 
Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Com-
merce, 
the 
Center 
for 
American 
Progress, the National Center for Les-
bian Rights, the National Center for 
Transgender 
Equality, 
Center 
for 
LGBTQ Economic Advancement & Re-
search, Human Rights Campaign, Out 
Leadership, and many others. 
The Financial Services Committee 
passed this bill unanimously by voice 
vote in May 2021, and I would like to 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, again, to join me in supporting 
this important legislation. 
I would like to thank the ranking 
member, Mr. MCHENRY, for joining 
with me and others to pass this impor-
tant legislation and particularly this 
Pride Month that we are all cele-
brating the progress that has been 
made in the LGBTQ community. 
I thank Mr. MCHENRY for his cospon-
sorship, his support, and his coopera-
tion, for all that we are able to get 
done these days working together. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3325) to award four congres-
sional gold medals to the United States 
Capitol Police and those who protected 
the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3325 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) Every day, the United States Capitol 
Police (‘‘Capitol Police’’) protects the U.S. 
Capitol, Members of Congress, congressional 
staff and institutional staff, journalists, and 
the visiting public. 
(2) On January 6, 2021, a mob of insurrec-
tionists forced its way into the U.S. Capitol 
building and congressional office buildings 
and engaged in acts of vandalism, looting, 
and violently attacked Capitol Police offi-
cers. 
(3) The sacrifice of heroes including Cap-
itol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and How-
ard Liebengood, Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment Officer Jeffrey Smith, and those who 
sustained injuries, and the courage of Cap-
itol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, exem-
plify the patriotism and the commitment of 
Capitol Police officers, and those of other 
law enforcement agencies, to risk their lives 
in service of our country. 
(4) Up to seven Americans died following 
this violent attack, and more than 140 law 
enforcement officers suffered physical inju-
ries, including 15 officers who were hospital-
ized. 
(5) The desecration of the U.S. Capitol, 
which is the temple of our American Democ-
racy, and the violence targeting Congress are 
horrors that will forever stain our Nation’s 
history. 
(6) On April 2, 2021 Officer William ‘‘Billy’’ 
Evans was killed while protecting the North 
Barricade of the Capitol. Officer Evans was a 
distinguished member of the First Respond-
ers Unit and an eighteen-year veteran of the 
United States Capitol Police. Also injured in 
that assault was Officer Kenneth Shaver. Of-
ficer Shaver is a fifteen-year veteran of the 
United States Capitol Police.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, every day the men 
and women of the United States Cap-
itol Police protect the U.S. Capitol. 
They protect us, they protect our staff, 
they protect journalists and other visi-
tors who come into the people’s House. 
In March of this year, the House 
passed H.R. 1085 to award three Con-
gressional Gold Medals honoring the 
courage, patriotism, and commitment 
to service exemplified by the men and 
women of the Capitol Police, Metro-
politan Police, and other law enforce-
ment agencies who risked their lives 
and sustained injuries as they sought 
to protect those trapped in the Capitol 
on January 6, 2021. 
This bill builds upon H.R. 1085 to in-
clude minting of a fourth Congres-
sional Gold Medal to be displayed by 
the Architect of the Capitol so that we 
may continue to honor those officers 
who sustained injuries in the line of 
duty and the sacrifices of heroes, in-
cluding Capitol Police Officers Brian 
Sicknick and Howard Liebengood and 
Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police 
Department Officer Jeffrey Smith. We 
also honor Capitol Police Officer Eu-
gene Goodman; whose quick thinking 
and selfless action undoubtedly saved 
the lives of many. 
Additionally, this bill honors the 
memory of Capitol Police Officer Wil-
liam ‘‘Billy’’ Evans, who was killed 
while protecting the north barricade of 
the Capitol against a vehicular assault 
on April 2, 2021. It also honors the brav-
ery displayed by Capitol Police Officer 
Kenneth Shaver, who was also injured 
in that assault. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI for intro-
ducing this bill this Congress and urge 
Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3325, a bill to award the Congres-
sional Gold Medal to the U.S. Capitol 
Police and those who protected the 
Capitol on January 6, 2021.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2790 
June 15, 2021 
I would like to thank the Speaker for 
bringing this legislation to the floor to 
honor the officers who work tirelessly 
to protect us in and out every day, to 
not just protect this building, but to 
protect the Members in this building. 
Not just protect the Members, but to 
make sure that staff is safe on a daily 
basis. And the staff, indeed, makes 
Congress what it is and gives us the ca-
pacity that we have to legislate. We 
want to make sure that staff and Mem-
bers and our visitors here are protected 
on a daily basis, and the Capitol Police, 
indeed, do that. 
Madam Speaker, what happened to 
this institution on January 6 was hor-
rific. This building is a working monu-
ment to our Nation’s Founding Fathers 
and our founding principles. It is a tes-
tament to the freedoms we hold dear 
and that we strive for, and we strive to 
become a more perfect Union on every 
day that we are here. Not perfectly, 
but we strive for a more perfect Union. 
Madam Speaker, the brave men and 
women who stood and faced danger on 
January 6 deserve to be recognized for 
their actions. Without their coura-
geous work and their dedication, many 
of us here today could have been seri-
ously injured or worse. 
This gold medal will also honor an-
other Capitol Police Officer, William 
‘‘Billy’’ Evans. Officer Evans, an 18- 
year veteran of Capitol Police, was 
killed at his post when a car rammed 
into the Capitol barricade on Good Fri-
day. Any life lost is a tragedy, espe-
cially those of our friends on the police 
force. 
Once this bill is enacted, a Congres-
sional Gold Medal will be displayed at 
the U.S. Capitol Police headquarters. It 
will be a recognition of the good work 
the Capitol Police do on a daily basis. 
Another will be displayed at the D.C. 
Metropolitan Police headquarters, and 
the third will be given to the Smithso-
nian Institution so everyone who visits 
D.C. will be reminded of the bravery by 
our police officers on that very day. 
Madam Speaker, I think I speak for 
all my colleagues when I say thank 
you, thank you to each and every offi-
cer who was here on January 6. Their 
bravery will not be forgotten. 
The U.S. Capitol Police and those 
who protected us on January 6 deserve 
this Congressional Gold Medal. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI) 
the 
Speaker, who is also the sponsor of this 
legislation. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
and for leading the effort on the floor 
today to pass this important legisla-
tion. I commend her and the ranking 
member, Mr. MCHENRY, for his good 
words about this legislation and his 
reference to the bravery of our Capitol 
Police. 
Madam Speaker, over 5 months have 
passed since the January 6 insurrection 
was waged against our Capitol and our 
democracy. 
For most of us, the horror of January 
6 has not faded. The memory of Mem-
bers, staff, and workers fleeing for 
their lives, the sound of screams and 
shots fired, the agony of over 140 law 
enforcement officers physically harmed 
and those killed all remain very raw. 
January 6 was unquestionably one of 
the darkest days in the history of our 
democracy, but because of the courage 
of the Capitol Police and other law en-
forcement officers, it will also be 
etched in history as a day of heroism. 
That day the Capitol Police Force put 
themselves between the violence and 
us. They risked their safety and their 
lives for others with the utmost self-
lessness. Some died, becoming martyrs 
for our democracy. 
They did so because they were patri-
ots, the type of Americans who heard 
the call to serve and answered it, put-
ting country above self. They enabled 
us to return to the Capitol, to that po-
dium that night to show the world that 
our democracy had prevailed and that 
it had succeeded because of them. 
b 1600 
In March, as you recall, we came to-
gether and we passed legislation to 
award these patriots the Congressional 
Gold Medal, the highest award, as has 
been mentioned, that this body can 
offer. 
Doing so was a high honor and privi-
lege for each of us, and it was also our 
responsibility to ensure that we always 
remember those heroes and their sac-
rifice. 
As I said on the floor then: ‘‘May the 
courage of these heroes always remain 
an inspiration to us. And may we al-
ways remember the valor of the fall-
en.’’ 
This gold medal will be proudly dis-
played, as the distinguished gentleman 
referenced, for years to come, ensuring 
that their valor and the sacrifice of the 
fallen are always remembered. 
But 2 weeks after we passed that gold 
medal legislation, as you know, Madam 
Speaker, under your leadership, Con-
gress honored one of the fallen, Officer 
Brian Sicknick, with a lying-in-state 
ceremony to convey the grief and grat-
itude felt for all Americans by his sac-
rifice. 
That respect was reflected in the 
presence of distinguished leaders, mili-
tary leaders, and leaders of institutions 
of government who came to pay their 
respects, including President Biden. 
Sadly, just weeks later, we returned 
to the Capitol rotunda for a lying-in- 
honor 
ceremony 
for 
Officer 
Billy 
Evans, as the distinguished ranking 
member mentioned, killed in the line 
of duty in April on Good Friday. 
Officer Evans was a distinguished 
member of the first responders unit 
and an 18-year veteran of the United 
States Capitol Police. 
Everyone who knew him knew he was 
a hero. We hope that it was a comfort 
to his children Logan and Abigail that 
so many learned that day what a hero 
their father was. We hope by adding 
Billy’s name to the pantheon of patri-
ots honored with this gold medal, the 
memory of his sacrifice will always en-
dure. 
So here we are once again on the 
floor of the House honoring our heroes. 
As we pass this legislation, we, as 
Members of Congress, have a responsi-
bility to do more than simply laud 
these officers as heroes. 
We must respect them and we must 
support them with resources and fund-
ing. We must keep them safe. And we 
must ensure that a January 6th attack 
can never happen again. 
This is about our respect for their 
service and our responsibility to honor 
their sacrifice. Any chance we get, we 
want to praise our Capitol Police. 
Sadly, we are doing this in a time when 
we are honoring some who have lost 
their lives and some were severely in-
jured, but every day we know that they 
are making a sacrifice, and that is 
what we respect. 
I urge a strong bipartisan vote for 
this legislation. I am pleased to hear 
both our distinguished chair, MAXINE 
WATERS, and the distinguished ranking 
member both support the legislation. I 
urge all members to join us in honoring 
our law enforcement heroes with real 
action with a gold medal. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congresswoman WATERS
for 
yielding, and I thank the gentlewoman 
and the ranking member for their lead-
ership. 
I ask that we think carefully as this 
legislation is debated and really reflect 
on January 6, where each of us prob-
ably has a personal experience that we 
can offer to be able to add to the sac-
rifice of that day, the moment in his-
tory and imaging that we never ex-
pected an insurrectionist mob to rise 
to attack the citadel of democracy. 
We were here quietly doing the peo-
ple’s business, the constitutional re-
sponsibility of affirming the President 
and Vice President of the United 
States. We were doing what the Amer-
ican people asked us to do. We were 
representing the Capitol Police and law 
enforcement 
throughout 
America. 
Nurses, doctors, students, teachers, the 
impoverished, all were with hope look-
ing toward the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration. 
We knew that there were those who 
did not vote for them, but we also 
knew the sacredness of our Constitu-
tion, and so did the Capitol Police and 
other law enforcement. 
For as we were down in this very au-
gust place where noises could not be 
heard quickly, our Capitol Police were 
already facing a torrent of outrageous 
behavior, violence, guns, smears, flags 
representing the worst of our Nation. 
So I am very proud to rise today and 
thank Speaker PELOSI for the vision

June 15, 2021 
and leadership and to remember to be 
reminded of the names Brian Sicknick, 
Howard Liebengood, Metropolitan Po-
lice Department Officer Jeffrey Smith, 
and those who sustained injuries, those 
who were heroic; Officer Eugene Good-
man exemplified the patriotism, com-
mitment, and unselfishness in saving 
the lives of others; and the Metropoli-
tan police, along with many other law 
enforcement. 
I rise to support this gold medal. I 
rise so that we never have this happen 
again. And I rise to say the simple 
words of ‘‘thank you.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 3325, legislation awarding four Congres-
sional Gold Medals to the United States Cap-
itol Police and those who, on January 6, 2021, 
displayed selfless and heroic service in de-
fense of American democracy in protecting the 
U.S. Capitol from the violent assault of domes-
tic terrorists. 
The United States Capitol Police dates back 
to 1800 when the Congress moved from Phila-
delphia to Washington, D.C., and a lone 
watchman was hired to protect the Capitol 
Building. 
In 1827, President John Quincy Adams 
asked that a regular Capitol Police force be 
established, and on May 2, 1828, Congress 
passed an Act that expanded the police regu-
lations of the City of Washington to include the 
Capitol and Capitol Square. 
The United States Capitol Police expanded 
its force after the terrorist attacks on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and again following the his-
toric merger with the Library of Congress Po-
lice in 2009. 
In addition to the more than 2,000 sworn 
members of the force, the United States Cap-
itol Police Department has over 350 civilian 
personnel who provide operational and admin-
istrative support, and its diverse workforce is 
comprised of employees from nearly all 50 
states and the U.S. territories. 
The United States Capitol Police embodies 
the best in American policing and serves as a 
model in security, urban crime prevention, dig-
nitary protection, specialty response capabili-
ties, and homeland security. 
As ambassadors of the Congress, officers of 
the United States Capitol Police Department 
are often the first face that visitors and em-
ployees encounter, leaving a lasting impres-
sion that is reflective of the Legislative Branch 
and its role in America’s democracy. 
Officers of the United States Capitol Police 
Department each day proudly protect the leg-
islative process, the symbol of the Nation’s de-
mocracy, the people who carry out the proc-
ess, and the millions of visitors who travel 
here to see democracy in action. 
No finer example of the selfless devotion to 
duty, love of country, and fidelity to their oath 
to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitu-
tion of the officers of the United States Capitol 
Police Department’s than their valiant, heroic, 
and courageous response to the January 6, 
2021 assault on the Capitol Building by thou-
sands of domestic terrorists, insurrectionists, 
and rioters sent there by the President of the 
United States to ‘‘fight like hell’’ to disrupt and 
derail the constitutionally required Joint Meet-
ing of Congress to open, count, and publicly 
confirm the vote tally of the presidential elec-
tors and announce the persons who had been 
elected President and Vice-President of the 
United States. 
District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser 
and the Metropolitan Police Department have 
a distinguished record of protecting all groups, 
regardless of their beliefs, who come to the 
Nation’s capital to exercise their First Amend-
ment rights peaceably to assemble, and to pe-
tition the Government for a redress of griev-
ances. 
At the direction of Mayor Bowser, and in ad-
vance of the scheduled demonstrations, mu-
tual aid was requested by the Metropolitan Po-
lice Department from several area police de-
partments to be on standby in the District, in-
cluding neighboring law enforcement depart-
ments, the Metropolitan Transit Police and 
non-law enforcement agencies such as the 
District’s Homeland Security and Emergency 
Management Agency and the Fire and Emer-
gency Medical Services Department. 
The sustained assault on the Capitol precip-
itated an equally unprecedented response, ne-
cessitating the urgent request of the United 
States Capitol Police for the Metropolitan Po-
lice Department to come defend the Capitol to 
which the Metropolitan Police Department re-
sponded immediately with several Civil Dis-
turbance Unit Platoons and proceeded to de-
ploy to the west front of the Capitol and ar-
rived within minutes. 
The violent mob overran protective meas-
ures at the Capitol, and by 1:50 p.m., Metro-
politan Police Department had declared the 
assembly to be a riot and immediately began 
working to achieve the objectives of stopping 
domestic terrorists from entering the Capitol 
building and removing those that were already 
inside, secure a perimeter so that the Capitol 
could be cleared for lawmakers to resume the 
Joint Meeting of Congress to demonstrate to 
the Nation and the world the robustness and 
vitality of America’s democracy, and making 
arrests of anyone violating the law. 
During the height of the siege of the Capitol, 
approximately 850 Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment members were at the Capitol, with an-
other 250 had been in the area to directly sup-
port the response and aftermath. 
Madam Speaker, people around the country 
and the world were shocked and moved by 
the video of a Metropolitan Police Department 
Officer being beaten by a crowd of insurgents, 
including one wielding an American flag, and 
of another in agony as he was crushed be-
tween a door and a riot shield but also awed 
by their bravery in the face of this unprovoked 
and vicious attack, bravery that was matched 
that day by countless other unheralded Metro-
politan Police Department officers. 
The January 6, 2021 siege of the Capitol 
assault resulted in one of the worst days of in-
juries for law enforcement in the United States 
since the September 11, 2001, terrorist at-
tacks. 
Madam Speaker, officers of the United 
States Capitol Police Department, the Metro-
politan Police Department of Washington, 
D.C., and other uniformed law enforcement of-
ficers stood their ground in defense of Amer-
ican democracy while being attacked by the 
angry mob of domestic terrorists with metal 
pipes, discharged chemical irritants, and other 
weapons. 
At least 138 officers, 73 from the United 
States Capitol Police Department and 65 from 
the Metropolitan Police Department in Wash-
ington, sustained injuries during the attack on 
the Capitol Building, several of which required 
hospitalization. 
The injuries sustained ranged from bruises 
and lacerations to more serious damage such 
as concussions, rib fractures, burns, and even 
a mild heart attack. 
One United States Capitol Police Depart-
ment officer died from injuries sustained while 
physically engaging with protesters and two 
officers involved in the response have died by 
suicide. 
Dozens, if not hundreds, of officers whom 
law enforcement officials estimate will suffer in 
years to come with post-traumatic stress dis-
order and the dozens who contracted the 
coronavirus from the unmasked domestic ter-
rorists and rioters who stormed the Capitol. 
At least 38 Capitol Police officers have test-
ed 
positive 
or 
were 
exposed 
to 
the 
coronavirus as well as nearly 200 National 
Guard personnel who were deployed to pro-
tect the Capitol. 
Madam Speaker, the seven hours between 
the urgent call for help from the Capitol Police 
to Metropolitan Police Department and the re-
sumption of work by both houses of Congress 
will be indelibly etched in the memories of 
every law enforcement officer who was on the 
scene, as it is in the minds of the Senators, 
Representatives, congressional and support 
staff, and members of the media corps who 
were forced to seek safety behind locked 
doors. 
Despite 
being 
overwhelmed 
and 
out-
numbered, the indomitable forces of American 
democracy, symbolized by the resolve of the 
officers of the United States Capitol Police De-
partment, prevailed and the seditious attack 
was quelled, the Capitol Building preserved, 
and the lives of United States Senators and 
Representatives protected, as well as those of 
congressional and support staff, and order 
was restored so that the Joint Meeting of Con-
gress was resumed and completed its con-
stitutionally required duty of counting and an-
nouncing the votes of the presidential electors, 
an essential step in the peaceful transfer of 
power that has been a hallmark of American 
democracy and the example to the world for 
more than two centuries. 
As the legislation recites, ‘‘the courage of 
Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman,’’ and 
‘‘the sacrifice of heroes including Capitol Po-
lice Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard 
Liebengood, Metropolitan Police Department 
Officer Jeffrey Smith, and those who sustained 
injuries, exemplify the patriotism’’ and devotion 
to duty of Capitol Police officers, and those of 
other law enforcement agencies, who risk their 
lives in service of our country. 
Madam Speaker, the Congressional Gold 
Medals authorized to be minted by this legisla-
tion and to be displayed at the United States 
Capitol Police headquarters, the Metropolitan 
Police Department of Washington, D.C., the 
Smithsonian Institution, and by the Architect of 
the Capitol at the United States Capitol con-
veys the thanks and appreciation of a grateful 
nation for the selfless and heroic service ex-
hibited by these sentinels of the republic in de-
fense of American democracy in responding to 
the January 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Cap-
itol by domestic terrorists. 
This tribute is, as President Lincoln noted at 
Gettysburg, ‘‘altogether fitting and proper’’ for 
heroes of the republic. 
The action we are taking today should en-
courage all educational and media institutions 
throughout the United States to teach and cel-
ebrate the story of the heroism of the officers

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2792 
June 15, 2021 
of the United States Capitol Police Depart-
ment, the Metropolitan Police Department, and 
all other law enforcement officers who, out of 
true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of 
the United States, selflessly risked their lives 
to protect the Capitol Building and its per-
sonnel, the Congress, and the spirit and fact 
of democracy in America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Americans to 
read, celebrate, and revere the Constitution of 
the United States, fidelity to which is the sur-
est best means of forming a more perfect 
union, establishing justice, ensuring domestic 
tranquility, providing for the common defense, 
promoting the general welfare, and securing 
the blessing of liberty to them and their pos-
terity. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I think this is a spe-
cial moment for the House in a very 
tough year for us to pause and to say 
thank you to those men and women 
who stand guard over this institution; 
not just this building, not just this 
campus, but the people who work here 
every day. 
It is not Members; it is staff that are 
here every day. It is the people that 
make the Capitol work physically. It is 
the folks who are at the daycare, the 
folks who are in the press. They are the 
folks who are frequent visitors here, 
such that they feel like they work 
here, too. 
It is the Capitol Police that keep us 
safe not from one another, but safe 
from the harms that can happen in a 
very dangerous world. And we want to 
say thank you to the men and women 
of the Capitol Police for their dedica-
tion, for their bravery, for their train-
ing every day. 
And we honor you not just in word, 
but with deed; not just with word and 
this deed of a Congressional Gold 
Medal, but our ongoing support. Our 
ongoing support, such that you can op-
erate every day to the best of your 
training with the best training and tac-
tics available to police and law en-
forcement anywhere in the world, the 
best equipment, the best training re-
sources, but also the freedom to use 
those things in a way that is commen-
surate with public safety. 
So I want to thank the Capitol Police 
for their service and their sacrifice in 
making this institution safe; safe so we 
can debate important things that need 
to be debated, to disagree, for us to be 
able to disagree as a civil society, yet 
still come together for the important 
things of being friends and neighbors 
and lovers of this great country. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
In 
closing, 
I 
commend 
Speaker 
PELOSI for bringing forward this legis-
lation. 
Every day, the brave men and women 
of the U.S. Capitol Police put their 
lives on the line in service to our Na-
tion. 
On January 6, we all witnessed this 
bravery 
firsthand 
as 
they 
fought 
against those who would seek to end 
this democracy. It is true that the 
leadership and decisive action on that 
day saved many lives, including my 
own. We honor their sacrifices on that 
day, and every day we thank them for 
their service. 
Madam Speaker and Members, I can-
not help but say at this time where 
this bill is being discussed on the floor 
of the House of Representatives, I saw 
Capitol Police in hand-to-hand combat 
with these insurrectionists. I saw them 
being attacked by QAnon, by the proud 
boys, by the oath keepers, by the KKK, 
by white supremacists. I thought I 
would never see such in my lifetime. 
I watched Capitol Police being at-
tacked with the American flag jabbed 
into their bodies. I never thought those 
who considered themselves conserv-
ative would attack uniformed police of-
ficers of the Capitol or any place, but 
we saw it. 
So we can’t say enough about these 
Capitol Police, whose lives were endan-
gered and some who lost their lives and 
some who are still trying to recuperate 
from the injuries that they received. 
I am absolutely saddened by the fact 
that too many do not want to know 
what really happened that day, who op-
pose investigation, oppose a commis-
sion to delve into exactly what took 
place, who was responsible, who orga-
nized it, who paid for it, et cetera. 
I could go on all day and night talk-
ing about that experience, as many 
Members of Congress perhaps would 
like to do, but I know that, despite the 
fact, there is opposition to delving into 
what happened. We are going to find 
out what happened. We are going to 
find out who supported all of the re-
sources that were put together to bring 
people here in buses and put them on 
airplanes to come and attack us in the 
Capitol of the United States of Amer-
ica. 
So I urge all Members to honor the 
sacrifices and courage displayed by the 
members of the Capitol Police, the 
Metropolitan Police, and other law en-
forcement agencies by voting ‘‘yes’’ on 
H.R. 3325. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3325, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES 
AND PASS CERTAIN BILLS 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to section 8 of House Resolution 
473, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass H.R. 293, H.R. 587, H.R. 610, H.R.

HARLEM HELLFIGHTERS CONGRESSIONAL GOLD 
MEDAL ACT 
H.R. 3642 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Harlem 
Hellfighters Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) When the United States officially en-
tered World War I in April 1917, the Armed 
Forces were still segregated, even though Af-
rican-American soldiers had served and dis-
tinguished themselves in every war since the 
Revolutionary War, and even the Colonial 
Wars preceding the American Revolution. 
(2) After several years of advocacy and de-
bate, in 1916 the State of New York author-
ized the recruitment of the 15th New York 
National Guard Regiment, which was called 
to Federal service on July 25, 1917, soon after 
arriving for training at Camp Whitman, New 
York. 
(3) The 15th completed its basic military 
practice training at Camp Whitman, New 
York. 
(4) To receive combat training, the 15th re-
ported, on October 8, 1917, to Camp Wads-
worth, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, 
where it experienced many incidents of ra-
cial discrimination. 
(5) Consequently, the government agreed 
to remove the 15th from Camp Wadsworth, 
but, instead of receiving further training, 
the regiment began preparing for deploy-
ment to France in November. 
(6) The 15th arrived in Saint Nazaire, 
France, on January 1, 1918, where it was re-
designated the 369th Infantry Regiment 
(7) Partly because many White soldiers 
within the American Expeditionary Forces 
(hereinafter, the ‘‘AEF’’) refused to perform 
combat duty with Black soldiers, members of 
the 369th were initially assigned manual 
labor tasks, such as loading and unloading 
supplies, and constructing roads and rail-
roads. 
(8) After receiving pressure from the 369th 
regimental commander about not having a 
combat mission, the AEF attached the 369th 
to the French Fourth Army. 
(9) By mid-March of 1918, the 369th went to 
the Argonne Forest with the French 16th Di-
vision for training and soon entered the 
trenches. 
(10) The 369th encountered its first German 
soldiers in combat in April, 1918. 
(11) In May of 1918, Private Henry Johnson 
of the 369th received the French Croix de

Guerre, with Palm, for extraordinary valor, 
becoming one of the first American soldiers 
to be awarded this honor. 
(12) Johnson also belatedly received a Pur-
ple Heart, was awarded the Distinguished 
Service Cross, and in, 2015, was awarded the 
Medal of Honor. 
(13) Throughout the remainder of the 
spring and into the summer the 369th served 
at Minacourt, in the Champagne-Marne De-
fensive, and during the Aisne-Marne Offen-
sive in support of the French 161st Infantry 
Division. 
(14) As summer turned to autumn, the 
369th went on to participate in the Meuse- 
Argonne offensive, where it captured the im-
portant village of Sechault despite sus-
taining severe losses. 
(15) On October 14, 1918, the 369th advanced 
to Alsace. 
(16) On November 20, 1918, the 369th reached 
the banks of the Rhine River as part of the 
French Army of Occupation, the first Allied 
unit to do so. 
(17) The 369th was relieved of its assign-
ment with the French 161st Division in De-
cember, 1918, and elements of the regiment 
sailed for New York in late January and 
early February, 1919. 
(18) The 369th Infantry Regiment received 
a parade up 5th Avenue in New York City on 
February 17, 1919, receiving applause and 
cheers from hundreds of thousands of on-
lookers. 
(19) The 369th was demobilized on February 
28, 1919. 
(20) Over 170 individual members of the 
369th received the Croix de Guerre, many 
were awarded the Distinguished Service 
Cross, and the 369th was awarded a unit cita-
tion. 
(21) It is generally believed that the 369th 
was dubbed the ‘‘Harlem Hellfighters’’ by 
German soldiers, who found the men to be 
incredibly determined and courageous in 
battle. 
(22) The 369th was the first regiment of Af-
rican Americans to deploy overseas during 
World War I and spent 191 days on the front 
line in World War I, more than any other 
American regimental sized unit. 
(23) The 369th never lost a foot of ground 
nor had a man taken prisoner, despite suf-
fering a high number of casualties. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the award, on 
behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of ap-
propriate design to the 369th Infantry Regi-
ment, commonly known as the ‘‘Harlem 
Hellfighters’’, in recognition of their bravery 
and outstanding service during World War I. 
(b) DESIGN

(a), the Secretary of the Treasury shall

(c) SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Following the award of 
the gold medal in honor of the 369th Infantry 
Regiment, the ‘‘Harlem Hellfighters’’, the 
gold medal shall be given to the Smithsonian 
Institution, where it will be displayed as ap-
propriate and made available for research. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Smithsonian Institution 
should make the gold medal awarded pursu-
ant to this Act available for display else-
where, particularly at other locations associ-
ated with the Harlem Hellfighters. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary may strike 
and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold 
medal struck under section 3, at a price suf-
ficient to cover the costs of the bronze med-
als, including labor, materials, dies, use of 
machinery, and overhead expenses.

ceived from the sale of duplicate medals 
under subsection (a) shall be deposited in the 
United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.

United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund 
such amounts as may be necessary to pay for 
the costs of the medals struck under this

RESIGNATION 
AS 
MEMBER 
OF 
COMMITTEE 
ON 
NATURAL 
RE-
SOURCES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following resigna-
tion as a member of the Committee on 
Natural Resources: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 15, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: I write today to re-
quest to be removed from the House Com-
mittee on Natural Resources to allow Rep-
resentative Stansbury to serve on this im-
portant committee. 
Representative Stansbury was recently 
sworn in as a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives serving New Mexico’s 1st Con-
gressional 
District. 
Representative 
Stansbury is filling the vacancy created 
when then Representative Haaland was nom-
inated and confirmed to be the United States 
Secretary of the Interior. Before serving as 
Secretary of the Interior, former Representa-
tive Haaland used her position on the House 
Committee on Natural Resources to combat 
the climate crisis and create a more equi-
table future for her constituents and all 
Americans. I believe it is important that 
Representative Stansbury have an oppor-
tunity to continue this legacy and represent 
her constituents in New Mexico’s 1st Con-
gressional District on the House Committee 
on Natural Resources. 
I appreciate your consideration of this re-
quest. 
Sincerely, 
DORIS MATSUI, 
Member of Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the resignation is accepted. 
There was no objection. 
ELECTING A CERTAIN MEMBER TO 
CERTAIN 
STANDING 
COMMIT-
TEES OF THE HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Democratic Caucus, I 
offer a privileged resolution and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 475 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
ber be, and is hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing standing committees of the House of 
Representatives: 
COMMITTEE
ON NATURAL RESOURCES: Ms. 
Stansbury, to rank immediately after Ms. 
Leger Ferna´ndez. 
COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECH-
NOLOGY: Ms. Stansbury, to rank immediately 
after Mr. Bowman. 
Mr. AGUILAR (during the reading). 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that the resolution be considered as 
read and printed in the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST TAKE ACTION 
(Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, last week, the un-
thinkable happened. A grandmother, 
Litha Verone, was innocently shopping 
in a local supermarket with her pre-
cious young grandson when they were 
both brutally murdered by a deranged 
man with a semi-automatic weapon. 
My heart breaks for Litha’s family 
for their unbearable loss. 
But, once again, prayers and good 
wishes are not enough. On so many lev-
els we must take action passing com-
monsense gun legislation, strength-
ening our mental health system, reach-
ing out to those in trouble because in 
the last moments of her life, a grand-
mother watched in horror as her grand-
child was shot and killed by a man who 
should never have had a gun. 
Madam Speaker, last week, the un-
thinkable happened, and we must not 
stop thinking about it.

HONORING 
THE 
125TH 
ANNIVER-

OF 
THE 
INDIANA 
VET-
ERANS’ HOME 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor the 125th anniversary of 
the Indiana Veterans’ Home. 
It was established in Tippecanoe 
County in 1895, and the Indiana Vet-
erans’ Home initially served as a facil-
ity to care for the disabled Union sol-
diers after the Civil War.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2802 
June 15, 2021 
By 1910, the home served over 1,400 
residents and offered its own hospital, 
bakery, and electric light plant. 
Over a century later, the Indiana 
Veterans’ Home continues to operate 
as a full-service facility offering a mul-
titude of medical and support services 
for its residents. 
It is also home to a small museum of 
historical artifacts, and serves as the 
final resting place for nearly 3,000 vet-
erans and their spouses. 
Indiana has a proud tradition of hon-
oring its veterans, and the Indiana Vet-
erans’ Home is a shining example of 
Hoosiers’ commitment to the care of 
those who have served. 
I congratulate those at the Indiana 
Veterans’ Home on their 125th anniver-
sary, and I offer my sincere gratitude 
for their continued service to Hoosier 
veterans and their families.

BRING DANNY FENSTER HOME 
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to mark 3 weeks since 
my constituent, Danny Fenster—pic-
tured here—was captured and impris-
oned by the Burmese military simply 
for doing his job as a journalist, 22 days 
spent on the phone and with my arms 
wrapped around his traumatized but 
determined family, upwards of 500 
hours reading our community’s out-
pouring of comments about Danny’s 
dignity and his career of standing up 
for people around the world. 
I have called on ambassadors all 
throughout the region. I have called on 
our own State Department to ask why, 
what is the justification for our Em-
bassy not having access to our citizen? 
And they have no reason. 
It is a violation of international law, 
and it is a violation of human rights. 
The U.S. Embassy needs access to 
Danny while we keep fighting for his 
immediate and unconditional release 
and to protect the freedom of the press. 
I will not stop fighting and our com-
munity will not stop fighting until we 
bring Danny home. 
f 
HOLDING CAMILA ORTEGA 
ACCOUNTABLE 
(Ms. SALAZAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
SALAZAR. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Latin America’s dictators exploit their 
children just like they exploit their 
own people. 
The best example is Nicaragua’s dic-
tator, Daniel Ortega. Ortega leads his 
corrupt, oppressive, dictatorial regime 
along with his wife and Vice President, 
Rosario 
Murillo. 
Their 
daughter, 
Camila Ortega, has defalcated millions 
and millions of dollars from the Nica-
raguan people while her mother and fa-
ther continue oppressing anyone who 
opposes them. 
Madam Speaker, 10 days ago, the 
United States Government blacklisted 
Camila Ortega for corruption. She is 
officially sanctioned. Her bank ac-
counts are frozen. No one can do busi-
ness with her at this hour. She will no 
longer lavishly spend the people’s 
money in the streets of Miami, my dis-
trict, where I represent thousands and 
thousands of the Nicaraguan exile com-
munity who fled her father’s regime 
and his oppression. 
Madam Speaker, from the floor of the 
United States Congress, from this 
floor, we ask the European Union and 
Canada to join America in holding 
Camila Ortega accountable. 
Ortega wants to steal the elections 
by jailing anyone who opposes him. 
But make no mistake, he and his fam-
ily will pay for these atrocities. 
f 
HONORING SISTER PEG SPINDLER 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great admiration and pride that I 
rise to honor Sister Peg Spindler for 
her lifetime of service and dedication 
to the Sojourner Truth House in Gary, 
Indiana. 
After more than 24 years of service, 
Sister Peg will be retiring on July 1 as 
the executive director of the women’s 
shelter. 
Sister Peg found her calling to sister-
hood at a young age while growing up 
in Cedar Lake, Indiana. In November 
1997, Sister Peg, along with the support 
of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ, 
opened the doors to the Sojourner 
Truth House, which serves the true 
vulnerable populations, the homeless, 
the 
underserved, 
and 
the 
at-risk 
women and their children, with the 
goal of providing them the necessary 
tools and resources to improve their 
quality of life. 
After retiring, Sister Peg plans to 
visit Catholic parishes throughout the 
country to advocate on best practices, 
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and 
to combat the harmful effects of cli-
mate change on the most vulnerable. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and 
my colleagues join me in honoring Sis-
ter Peg Spindler for her lifetime of 
leadership and tireless dedication to 
the most vulnerable of populations in 
her community. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF FRED-
ERICK AURELIUS ‘‘RELE’’ EVANS 
(Mr. PALMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to celebrate a life well-lived. 
Frederick 
Aurelius 
‘‘Rele’’ 
Evans 
passed away last month at the age of 
94. After graduating high school in 
Tuscaloosa, he joined the Navy. After 
his service, he enrolled at Tulane Uni-
versity 
and 
earned 
a 
bachelor 
of 
science in electrical engineering. 
Following his college graduation, he 
joined the Air Force and became a 
fighter pilot, protecting Strategic Air 
Command while stationed in Sioux 
City, Iowa. 
Following his time in the military, 
he became employed as a test pilot for 
Hughes Aircraft and later worked for 
TRW. While working for TRW, he 
earned a Ph.D. in aerospace engineer-
ing at UCLA, specializing in control 
systems theory. 
Rele was the lead guidance engineer 
at Cape Canaveral when John Glenn 
was put into orbit, and he designed the 
on-board computer’s guidance system 
for the lunar lander. He also coau-
thored the formula to put Apollo on 
the Moon and was present at Mission 
Control when Neil Armstrong took one 
giant leap for mankind. He eventually 
returned to Alabama. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
the contributions Rele made to our 
military, our space program, and the 
State of Alabama. I wish his family the 
best as they mourn the loss of this 
modest man who accomplished much. 
f 
ENSURING EQUAL 
TRANSPORTATION ACCESSIBILITY 
(Ms. NEWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
NEWMAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise on behalf of the millions 
of Americans with disabilities, the mil-
lions of Americans who live in a major 
city with a major public transit system 
but are unable to utilize it because it is 
not accessible to them. 
If we want to build a world-class pub-
lic transportation system in America, 
it has to start by ensuring every sta-
tion and every bus and train across our 
Nation is equally accessible to every-
one. 
That is why I introduced the All Sta-
tions Accessibility Act, or ASAP Act, 
of 2021, which would establish a Federal 
grant program to support transit au-
thorities to upgrade stations to meet 
or exceed ADA accessibility standards. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to say 
that we have secured this grant pro-
gram in the INVEST in America Act. 
Now, I urge this body to pass that leg-
islation so that we can better ensure 
our public transit services are for all 
riders, especially those with a dis-
ability.

ENDING ILLEGAL MARIJUANA 
OPERATIONS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given

recognize this is still an illegal sub-
stance at the Federal level. 
We have, in my district—it is amaz-
ing—many hundreds of illegal hot-
houses that have been planted in 
Siskiyou County full of marijuana 
grows. 
Now, we haven’t had many resources 
to help out up there until very re-
cently, when a sheriff up there took it 
upon himself to eradicate these grows, 
to go against the county ordinances 
there, to go against other ordinances 
on water use, chemical use. They are 
using chemicals that are not even 
available to farmers that have long 
been made illegal in this country and 
in the State of California. 
These grows cause irreparable dam-
age to the environment and wildlife 
and are even dangerous to people who 
happen to traipse in there accidentally, 
with folks who are so heavily armed. 
They are cartels from out of the coun-
try that are in there doing this oper-
ation—all illegally. Why do we allow 
this to go on? 
These marijuana grows are dangerous 
and are against the law. The Federal 
Government needs to be a stronger 
partner in backing the locals on eradi-
cating these grows because of how 
much damage they do to the commu-
nity, to the environment, to the wild-
life, and to the overall feeling people 
have of their community up there. We 
need to help more.

CONTINUE RESTAURANT 
REVITALIZATION 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
earlier this year, Congress sprung into 
action to deal with the part of the 
economy that was hit perhaps hardest 
than any: the hospitality industry. 
Independent 
restaurants 
suffered 
massive job losses. Congress responded 
with the Restaurant Rescue Plan, $28.6 
billion. Madam Speaker, the need was 
so overwhelming that the fund was to-
tally subscribed in 3 days. 
We are working now with H.R. 3807 to 
replenish that fund with a $60 billion 
allocation, with bipartisan support in 
the House and Senate. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to support this important 
legislation to replenish the fund and 
rescue our restaurants, which are the 
cornerstone of a livable community. 
f 
RECLAIMING OUR FISCAL FUTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
ROSS). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 4, 2021, the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. HERN) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the topic 
of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, our 
country is facing a crisis of our own 
making. Republicans and Democrats 
alike have contributed to the rampant 
spending in Washington over the last 
several decades. But it is time for 
someone to stand up and say enough is 
enough. 
I am here tonight with some of the 
greatest minds in Congress to talk 
about our floor-ready plan to tackle 
wasteful spending and restore fiscal re-
sponsibility to the Federal Govern-
ment. 
In December, Republican Study Com-
mittee Chairman JIM BANKS asked me 
to lead the Budget Task Force for the 
117th Congress, and I gladly accepted. I 
put together a team of incredible fiscal 
conservatives to help repair our fiscal 
year 2022 budget. 
I 
thank 
these 
intelligent, 
hard-
working colleagues for rising to the oc-
casion, working diligently to meet our 
ambitious goals, and putting together 
a fine product that will serve all Amer-
icans. They are Chairman JIM BANKS, 
ROGER WILLIAMS, TRENT KELLY, RALPH 
NORMAN, RON ESTES, MICHAEL CLOUD, 
BEN CLINE, BYRON DONALDS, and BOB 
GOOD. Thank you, gentlemen. 
In addition to my task force mem-
bers, I would like to thank a man who 
is integral to the work of the task 
force and is a huge reason for the suc-
cess of this final budget, Richard 
Stern. 
When I said yes to drafting the budg-
et for fiscal year 2022, I committed to 
creating a thorough, floor-ready budget 
that reflects the conservative values 
that gave us the greatest economy in 
the history of the world before the pan-
demic. I believe, as do my colleagues, 
that the pro-growth policies of the 
Trump administration are proven tac-
tics to grow the economy and give 
Americans more control of their own 
money. 
Everyone in Washington seems to 
forget that we have no money of our 
own. Everything we appropriate in this 
Chamber, every dollar, comes from the 
American taxpayers. None of it belongs 
to us. 
In the last year, we spent $7.6 tril-
lion, largely due to an unprecedented 
global pandemic. The Biden adminis-
tration has shown no sign of slowing 
down and is starting to alarm more 
than just conservatives. It is our re-
sponsibility to hold this administra-
tion accountable and prove to the 
American people that there is someone 
left on Capitol Hill who cares about our 
debts. 
We need to return to federalism, 
where the Federal Government, the 
State, and the individual have their 
own distinct roles. 
In order to combat aggressive spend-
ing, we need an aggressive plan. That 
brings us to this year’s budget, aptly 
named ‘‘Reclaiming Our Fiscal Fu-
ture.’’ 
President Trump’s budget proposal to 
Congress would have balanced in 15 
years. That was our starting point, and 
we knew we were capable of balancing 
in less than 10. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to say 
that our budget will balance in just 5 
years. Many of you would ask how that 
is even possible. There are two parts to 
that answer. The first part is due to 
changes in inflation and interest costs 
following the COVID–19 pandemic. The 
second is due to pro-growth policies 
like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
When we give Americans more con-
trol of their own money, the result is 
market growth, wage growth, con-
sumer confidence, and, yes, increased 
revenues for the Federal Government. 
We are making provisions from the 
Tax Cuts and Job Cuts Act permanent, 
reducing the tax burden by $1.9 trillion, 
almost $16,000 per household. 
We are shielding the middle class 
from capital gains taxes, eliminating 
the death taxes, and repealing market- 
distorting tax carve-outs. 
Our budget is the most pro-life budg-
et ever introduced, with 17 pieces of 
pro-life legislation included. Our budg-
et stands strong for the issues Ameri-
cans care about, and we are crystal 
clear about how to pay for it. 
We are securing our border and build-
ing the wall. We are protecting your 
Second Amendment rights. We are sup-
porting our police officers and ensuring 
our communities remain safe for every-
one. 
Our budget includes over 30 specific 
deregulation bills ensuring liberty for 
American job creators and workers 
alike. 
b 1815 
We are putting Medicare and Social 
Security on a path to solvency without 
cutting immediate benefits. Whether 
you call them earmarks or community 
project funding, we are getting rid of it 
for good. We are reforming the budget 
process to be transparent and effective. 
To put it simply, we are fighting for 
Main Street America. 
Tonight, you will hear from me and 
my colleagues who helped shape this 
budget, whether as a member of the 
task force or by contributing legisla-
tion that is included in our budget. 
These Members all have something 
very important in common, a deep re-
spect for the American taxpayer. 
It is our job to ensure that Ameri-
cans’ tax dollars are being spent wise-
ly, that the government is making 
every effort to prevent waste and pro-
mote efficiency. It is pretty clear this 
hasn’t been the case in Washington for 
a long time. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY), my dear 
friend from the 21st Congressional Dis-
trict.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2804 
June 15, 2021 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma and ap-
preciate his work on this important 
matter, and my colleagues on the Re-
publican Study Committee. 
I am happy to be working on a task 
force to advance healthcare freedom, 
personalized healthcare, the ways that 
we believe we can get the American 
people to see the doctor of his or her 
choice without having to see an insur-
ance bureaucrat or a government bu-
reaucrat and be able to get access to 
care. And that is all germane, by the 
way, to this question of spending. 
I think it is really important here, 
and I am going to talk in a minute 
about how good I believe it is that we 
have a 5-year balanced budget that the 
Republican Study Committee has put 
forward, and proving that it can, in 
fact, be done. 
But let’s talk for a minute about the 
irresponsible budgeting and spending of 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. 
Most Americans hear these large 
numbers and they don’t know how to 
put them in context. What our national 
debt is, over $28 trillion. But nobody 
knows what that means. It doesn’t 
mean anything to the average person. 
We divide it and we say how much it is 
per person or family. We got numbers 
here, $226,000 per taxpayer, $85,000 per 
citizen. People still don’t know what 
that means. 
If you set out to count the roughly 
$28.2 trillion debt we have now, how 
long do you think that would take, 
Madam Speaker? 900,000 years if you 
counted one per second; one Mis-
sissippi. It would take you 900,000 years 
to count to $28.2 trillion. It is just ab-
surd. 
We are literally destroying the fiscal 
health of our country by the second. 
We are destroying it by the second. Our 
children and grandchildren are going to 
inherit this. But what is the real prob-
lem? We are killing our economy in the 
process. We are killing the American 
Dream in the process. We are killing 
small businesses in the process. 
We just spent $6 trillion appropriated 
in the process of spending. $6 trillion in 
a year in the name of COVID, as my 
friend from Oklahoma and my other 
colleagues well know. $6 trillion. Some 
of that was worthwhile. I think there 
was some PPP money in there that 
helps small businesses that I was happy 
to support, but $6 trillion. 
Would it interest the Madam Speaker 
to know that we spent $4.1 trillion for 
all of World War II, in current dollars? 
All of World War II, from the very be-
ginning, from Pearl Harbor all the way 
to the second bomb in Japan, $4 trillion 
over 31⁄2 years. 
We just spent $6 trillion in a year, ef-
fectively shutting down our economy, 
scaring the heck out of our children, 
forcing them to wear masks, shoving 
them into the corners of the classroom, 
forcing people not to go to the doctor 
of their choice, all so that Anthony 
Fauci could find himself on the cover 
of another magazine, while perpet-
uating a whole lot of myths that scare 
the hell out of the American people. 
That is just what occurred over the 
last year. 
And what is the impact of that? Well, 
last week the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics reported that year over year con-
sumer prices rose 5 percent in May. Has 
anybody gone to go buy a sheet of ply-
wood? Two times, three times, four 
times. Anybody talking to the builders 
in your districts? How is their pipeline 
looking down the road? 
Did anybody go talk to the small res-
taurants and businesses out there? 
They are devastated, unable to hire 
people. Why? Because we are paying 
people more not to work than to work. 
How many people do you talk to that 
are in your district that say, well, I 
have got a help wanted sign up, but I 
can’t get anybody to work. 
How is that going to bring back the 
economy and bring back jobs and bring 
back opportunity and bring back pros-
perity for the American people? And, 
oh, by the way, how is it ever going to 
allow us to have any fiscal responsi-
bility as a nation? And that is what we 
are talking about here. 
And we are talking about a plan that 
Republicans 
are 
putting 
forward. 
Meanwhile, our Democratic colleagues 
have not passed a budget. We just had 
a deeming statement, or whatever it is 
we adopted, for $1.5 trillion, it just slid 
in this week. $1.5 trillion. It is like Mo-
nopoly money. Nobody even under-
stands what we are doing here. 
And so we have got a budget that we 
put forward that balances in 5 years. 
Why don’t we debate it? For all the C– 
SPAN viewers out there, look how 
many people are in the Chamber. 
About, what, 10 of us. Ten Members, 
election certificates, in here. Why 
don’t we have a bill on the floor and 
why don’t we debate it? 
How many Americans would love to 
hear that the people’s House has not 
had an amendment offered on the floor 
of this Chamber since May of 2016 in 
regular order, an open amendment? 
Congressman ROY offers an amendment 
to a bill. Not since May of 2016, 5 years. 
It is all done in committee and rules 
and some smoke room in the back up 
here, just drop down, and we all go up 
and we vote ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’, and then 
we go out and give speeches. That is no 
way to govern. The American people 
know how to balance their own budgets 
at home. Businesses know how to bal-
ance budgets. Yet, this irresponsible 
government doesn’t. 
Madam Speaker, I would implore my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
to follow the great work of the Repub-
lic Study Committee, and look at the 
budget that we put forward that bal-
ances in 5 years, bring it to the floor of 
the House, and allow us to have an 
open debate. Go through the Budget 
Committee, go to the floor, and actu-
ally have a debate about the fiscal 
health and responsibility of this coun-
try so that our kids and grandkids can 
inherit the greatest country in the 
world, rather than $30 trillion in debt, 
and leaving us crippled and unable to 
carry forward for the good of our coun-
try. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I would 
yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois 
(Mrs. MILLER), the 15th Congressional 
District. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank the Repub-
lican Study Committee for hosting this 
important Special Order. Our Nation’s 
taxpayers deserve to be respected when 
it comes to our Federal budget. Fiscal 
responsibility is vital for a stable, 
strong, and long-lasting economy. 
Under the current administration 
and Democrat control in Congress, 
there are actual Federal efforts being 
conducted at the taxpayers’ expense to 
redefine gender and demonize tradi-
tional American values. We must put a 
stop to this nonsense, especially on the 
taxpayers’ dime. 
I have always told my children; the 
government has no money except for 
what they extract from the American 
people. The Republican Study Com-
mittee released a counter budget to the 
extremely irresponsible and radical 
budget that the Biden administration 
has put forth. This budget would bal-
ance our Federal budget in 5 years, cut 
spending by $14.4 trillion over 10 years, 
incorporate 30-plus deregulatory legis-
lative proposals, and reduces taxes by 
$1.9 trillion. 
The RSC budget will also adopt my 
bill, the Safety and Opportunity for 
Girls Act, to protect spaces for women 
and girls in schools. The bill would pre-
vent the Title IX provisions in Presi-
dent Biden’s executive order—it would 
limit them to being biological and the 
genetic definition of sex. 
I support the RSC budget proposal 
because it treats the government’s 
money as its own and works to pro-
mote all the best parts in America. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BABIN), the co-chair of the Border Cau-
cus from the 36th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from Oklahoma for hav-
ing this Special Order tonight. 
Madam Speaker, my message tonight 
is simple. We are more than $28 trillion 
in debt and sinking fast. If we don’t 
make drastic changes to the way we 
govern, we won’t have a country left to 
govern. 
In 2011, former chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, 
famously proclaimed that the national 
debt is the single greatest risk to our 
Nation. 
When I was elected in 2014, 7 years 
ago, the national debt was $18 trillion. 
In just 7 years, Madam Speaker, we 
have increased the debt by more than 
$10 trillion. In fact, we have spent more 
in the last year than the annual eco-
nomic production of every single coun-
try in the world, with the exception of 
our own, China, and India.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2805 
June 15, 2021 
Shockingly, President Biden’s only 
idea of how to deal with our rapidly in-
creasing debt is to spend $6 trillion 
more. The President and my colleagues 
across the aisle throw the word trillion 
around like it is nothing. It is hard to 
contemplate the magnitude of a tril-
lion, but think about this: one trillion 
seconds is around 32,000 years. Let that 
sink in. 
The left’s out of control spending and 
blatant disregard for our future must 
absolutely be stopped. Our failure to do 
so will undoubtedly lead us down the 
road to economic ruin, which is exactly 
why the Republican Study Commit-
tee’s, the RSC’s balanced budget is our 
best chance at reclaiming our fiscal fu-
ture. 
Madam Speaker, I am incredibly 
proud that one of my bills, the State 
and Local Pensions Accountability and 
Security 
Act, 
which prohibits the 
unelected bureaucrats at the Treasury 
Department or the Federal Reserve 
from bailing out irresponsible State or 
local government pension systems was 
included in the RSC’s final budget pro-
posal. 
So let’s eliminate the deficit and 
let’s balance the budget in the next 5 
years, as this does. Let’s cut spending 
by $14.4 trillion over the next decade, 
and reduce taxes by $1.9 trillion, and 
get our country back on the right 
track, and that is exactly what this 
budget proposal does. 
To quote my colleague from Ala-
bama, Congressman MO
BROOKS, he 
says, ‘‘Great nations weaken from 
within before they fall from without.’’ 
Our future generations are counting on 
us to get this done. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DA-
VIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague and the whole 
group of the Republican Study Com-
mittee for working on this budget pro-
posal because, frankly, this is an in-
credible threat to our Nation’s secu-
rity. It is a threat to the U.S. dollar as 
our global reserve currency, and as the 
Fed continues to accommodate it, we 
are destroying the value of our dollar. 
This is an essential duty of our body 
here in the House of Representatives, 
and so it is an incredible honor to have 
three of the bills that I have drafted be 
included in the proposal. One is the 
CBO Show Your Work Act. Frankly, 
the Congressional Budget Office is our 
accounting office. 
Now, imagine if you worked at a firm 
and you were on the board, and you 
simply said, I want to see the books. 
And the accounting department said, 
no, we are not going to show it to you. 
They won’t even show it to regular 
Members sometimes. They should show 
it to the whole public. They are doing 
the work on behalf of the public. It is 
not a trade secret. It is not propri-
etary. They model our economy, their 
scores have incredible consequences, 
and they need to show their work. 
Another one is the Global Trade Ac-
countability 
Act. 
President 
Trump 
rightly put a lot of attention on trade, 
and it is right that Congress would re-
claim some of its authority. Because 
when Congress doesn’t enact a law, it 
doesn’t endure, it pivots from adminis-
tration to administration. It pulls the 
authority back to Congress where it 
lies in the Constitution, and it puts the 
President on a shot clock. And, frank-
ly, not the President so much as the 
people we initiate against; either come 
to the table and negotiate something 
within 90 days, or the authority goes 
away, and you have to change some-
thing. 90 more days. And, in general, 
until you agree, it is going to keep get-
ting worse. 
b 1830 
Lastly, we have the fair representa-
tion amendment, and that would say 
that when we apportion congressional 
districts, we apportion them based on 
the number of U.S. citizens. 
Frankly, rural America is being dis-
enfranchised by counting noncitizens 
when we apportion Representatives. 
Ohio is losing yet another Representa-
tive. 
That is not a partisan issue. It 
doesn’t break on party lines. Frankly, 
Texas and California benefit by count-
ing noncitizens, but it is hurting a lot 
of our country by counting them. 
There are factors in terms of how we 
allocate dollars. Instead of dollars per 
citizen, we are allocating dollars per 
capita, and that sends more dollars to 
urban districts and fewer dollars to 
rural districts. 
It is important work. I thank the 
committee, and I thank, particularly, 
Mr. HERN for his work leading it. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from the great State 
of Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of 
America’s fiscal future as it is envi-
sioned in the RSC budget. 
For the first time since I have been 
here in 5 years, we have managed to as-
semble a very reasonable path forward 
to fiscal stability for our country. 
I have language in this bill reflective 
of the crisis at the border. My legisla-
tion, H.R. 2729, the Finish the Wall Act, 
is included in the language of the un-
derlying bill. 
On President Biden’s first day in of-
fice, he halted the use of border secu-
rity funds allocated by Congress, ended 
all ongoing construction of the border 
wall, and implemented very weak bor-
der policies that have had dire con-
sequences for our Nation. 
We have had over 1 million illegal 
crossings thus far this year. In history, 
it has never been this high. We have 
had surges here and there in 2014 and 
2019, yes, under various administra-
tions for various reasons. But we have 
never had 1.1 million illegal crossings 
into our country. 
Our border has created layers of cri-
sis, and we must deal with it. We must 
act. We must force action from our ex-
ecutive. 
The debt that we face as a nation is 
crippling, and the generations yet un-
born will not survive a $31 trillion debt 
that we are looking at right now. 
America will not continue to exist as 
we know it with that type of crippling 
debt. But we won’t get there. We won’t 
get to our grandchildren and great- 
grandchildren as a strong American na-
tion if we allow the sovereignty of 
America to be destroyed in the course 
of one Presidential term. 
Madam Speaker, we are trending 
over 2 million illegal crossings this 
year. We cannot allow this to happen. I 
urge my colleagues to take a reason-
able look at the RSC budget. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from the Fourth Con-
gressional 
District 
of 
Iowa 
(Mr. 
FEENSTRA). 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to discuss Sarah’s Law, a bi-
cameral bill I introduced along with 
Senator JONI ERNST from Iowa. 
Our proposal was named in honor of 
Sarah Root, a 21-year-old girl who, 
after her graduation, that night, was 
killed by an illegal immigrant. The il-
legal immigrant was drunk and drag 
racing. He posted bond. ICE did not de-
tain him, and he left the country, 
never to be seen from ever again. 
The bill would require authorities to 
keep illegal immigrants in custody if 
they have been charged with a crime 
that resulted in death or serious bodily 
injury. 
I am pleased that my proposal was 
included in the Republican Study Com-
mittee budget. After all, budgets re-
flect priorities, and given the crisis at 
our border, it is crucial that we imple-
ment tougher immigration policies 
that protect Iowans and protect Ameri-
cans. 
Border encounters have hit an all- 
time high in the last two decades, with 
over 180,000 encounters in the month of 
May. Last year, we had over 23,000. Yet, 
President Biden’s bloated $6 trillion 
budget proposal does not include a sin-
gle cent more for homeland security. 
Unlike Vice President Harris, the ad-
ministration’s 
self-appointed 
border 
czar, I went to the border. I heard di-
rectly from law enforcement officers. 
We need to ensure they have the re-
sources they need to do their jobs, and 
we need to start enacting stricter im-
migration and border security policies 
that address this crisis. 
At the very least, we can all agree 
that neither American citizens nor ille-
gal immigrants should ever be able to 
evade the law. Sarah’s Law would en-
sure illegal immigrants cannot escape 
justice simply due to immigration pol-
icy loopholes. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the Republican 
Study Committee’s budget. It is a fan-
tastic budget. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, may I 
ask how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oklahoma has 35 minutes 
remaining.

Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from the Fifth Con-
gressional District of Virginia (Mr. 
GOOD). He is also a task force member 
who gave us a tremendous amount of 
input on our process, and I want to 
thank him for his work. It was a 5- 
month journey that we went through 
to arrive at this budget and a lot of 
sleepless nights. I really appreciate the 
gentleman’s inputs and his thoughts. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Congressman HERN for his 
work as chairman of the Republican 
Study Committee Budget Task Force 
and for leading this effort. Also, I 
would like to thank RSC Chairman JIM 
BANKS for his outstanding leadership 
overall of the RSC. 
This team has done remarkable work 
to try to keep money where it belongs: 
in the wallets of hardworking Amer-
ican taxpayers. 
The RSC budget proposal would bal-
ance the Federal budget within 5 years 
of implementation, and I am thrilled to 
say that it is the most pro-life RSC 
budget ever. 
The RSC budget would cut Federal 
spending by $14.4 trillion over 10 years 
and cut taxes by $1.9 trillion. In fact, it 
reduces the burden on American tax-
payers by nearly $16,000 per household. 
Unlike Biden’s budget buster, this 
budget prioritizes American families 
and hardworking taxpayers. 
I am proud to have served as a mem-
ber of the RSC Budget Task Force, and 
this budget is historic for two reasons. 
First, 
it 
unapologetically 
and 
un-
equivocally affirms the conservative 
values that we were elected to fight 
for. Second, it courageously addresses 
our 
unsustainable entitlement pro-
grams, preserves and protects our com-
mitment to America’s seniors and 
those nearing retirement, builds the 
framework for responsible fiscal man-
agement, and secures the future for 
younger generations of Americans. 
The RSC budget contains many of 
the conservative principles that I have 
fought for since my first day in office 
nearly 6 months ago. From protecting 
people of faith from government intru-
sion to shielding small businesses from 
the heavy hand of government regula-
tions to putting the needs of our stu-
dents before teachers’ unions, the RSC 
budget contains many pieces of legisla-
tion that I have personally introduced. 
This includes my ALERT Act, which 
would require monthly updates from 
executive agencies about any rules 
they are working on, including the 
costs to taxpayers of those regulations. 
My Article I Regulatory Budget Act 
would restore direct, accountable con-
gressional control of the Federal regu-
latory system, as the Founders in-
tended, and require a budget from the 
President for all regulatory costs, simi-
lar to the annual budget for other 
taxes and spending. 
My Right to Earn a Living Act would 
prevent Congress from subsidizing cost-
ly lockdown policies like those handed 
down by State and local Democrat offi-
cials. As a free-market conservative, I 
know there is no better way to stimu-
late our economy than by opening it up 
and turning the American people loose. 
Congress cannot continue bailing out 
poorly run States whose economies 
have 
been 
devastated 
by 
these 
lockdown orders. 
My Protecting Religion from Govern-
ment Act seeks to preserve all Ameri-
cans’ First Amendment rights by al-
lowing citizens to sue State or local 
governments that seek to prevent or 
regulate religious services. Govern-
ment has no constitutional authority 
over religion. 
My 
Students 
Before 
Unions 
Act 
would put children first and make 
COVID funding contingent upon the 
transparency of local teachers’ unions. 
My bill to repeal the Jim Crow-era 
Davis-Bacon Act, which requires the 
Federal Government to pay the pre-
vailing wage, would end this inexcus-
able, long-held practice that drives up 
prices for taxpayer-funded construction 
and eliminates opportunities for hard-
working Americans. 
Finally, my SHUSH Act would de-
regulate firearm suppressors at the 
Federal level and preempt State laws 
that regulate, tax, or prohibit the pos-
session of suppressors. No constitu-
tional right should be at risk of public 
opinion or subject to regulatory and 
tax burdens. 
As a freshman, I am truly grateful 
and humbled to have so many of my 
bills included in the budget, second 
only to the number submitted by RSC 
Chairman JIM BANKS. 
At $28 trillion of debt that we have 
now, that equates to about $85,000 per 
American citizen. Every time we reck-
lessly and foolishly spend another $1 
trillion, that is about $10,000 per house-
hold. This is unsustainable. The major-
ity in this administration is, at best, 
economically and fiscally illiterate and 
incompetent, or, at worst, they are in-
tentionally crushing our financial fu-
ture and our very Republic. 
Our work on this conservative budget 
shows that it is possible to do what the 
Democrats seem to find impossible: 
balance the budget through practical 
solutions that put American taxpayers 
first while preserving the values that 
have made this the greatest country in 
history. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
HERN
again 
for 
his 
leadership 
in 
crafting this budget that deserves a 
vote in the House Budget Committee 
and on this very floor so that the 
American people can see if their Rep-
resentatives are serious about fighting 
inflation and restoring our fiscal san-
ity. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, Speaker 
PELOSI reminded us about 3 years ago 
when she infamously said: Show me 
your budget, and I will show you your 
values. 
That phrase and that statement have 
been made so many times by leaders 
talking about budgets. 
In America, individuals have budgets, 
counties have budgets, communities 
have budgets, cities have budgets, 
schools have budgets, businesses have 
budgets, and States have budgets. The 
United States of America has gone 3 
years now without a budget from the 
Budget Committee that is run by my 
colleagues from the Democratic Party, 
the people in power. 
We have a budget that we are asking 
to get on the floor, a budget that is 
built on the pro-growth policies that 
we saw 16 months ago yield the great-
est economy in our lifetime, the lowest 
unemployment rate, the most people 
employed with all diversity, of all 
ethnicities, of all countries of origin, 
women, African Americans, and His-
panics. Everywhere, people have seen 
the greatest jobs they have ever seen. 
There were double-digit increases for 
the lowest earning wage earners among 
us. 
We know these policies work. This 
budget builds upon them. The Amer-
ican people are demanding that we be 
accountable for the dollars they send 
us. What we are seeing now in the 
budget that was just put out by the 
President in a piecemeal fashion is a 
budget that sends jobs overseas and 
that destroys jobs in our energy-pro-
ducing companies, some of the highest 
wage earners we have in this country. 
We see our defense budget being cut 
below the inflation rate. 
As we speak about inflation, the 
President promised the American peo-
ple that he wouldn’t raise taxes on 
anybody making less than $400,000 a 
year. Madam Speaker, I will tell you 
the greatest hidden tax in America is 
inflation, and what we are seeing right 
now is inflation rising at an annualized 
rate of 5, 6, and 7 percent that spans ev-
erybody in America on top of the pro-
posed tax increases that the President 
is talking about. 
He is proposing looking at changing 
the tax rates for our multinational 
companies, our companies that were 
starting to move jobs back to America. 
Now we are seeing a deal is being 
struck by Secretary Yellen to try to 
take the G7 to tax our companies to 
the point that we are going to see jobs 
leave our country and return back to 
where they moved their headquarters 
overseas, to lower tax nations. 
To my colleagues out there, all we 
are asking for is to put a budget on the 
floor, our budget, to get your vote to 
be responsible to the American tax-
payers so that we can see, once and for 
all, where everyone is on doing the 
right thing for the American tax-
payers. 
b 1845 
For all of my colleagues that joined 
us tonight, what we have heard over 
the last hour was a clear vision for 
America, an outline of how conserv-
atives intend to govern. It is sad that 
we have to call it a conservative budg-
et. It is a budget for the American peo-
ple. This is the future of our Nation. 
This is the hope of democracy. 
Before I finally close, I would like to 
yield to the gentleman from Kansas

June 15, 2021 
(Mr. ESTES), my dear colleague, a 
member of the task force, to give his 
thoughts on what he saw and worked 
on, on our budget. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the Republican Study Committee for 
hosting this Special Order hour. 
Today, our Nation’s debt is more 
than $28 trillion. With a number that 
large, it is hard to really understand 
how much taxpayer money we are real-
ly talking about. Well, $28 trillion is $1 
million 28 million times. Or another 
way to think about it is it is 28 with 12 
zeros behind it. 
Spending far beyond our means and 
watching the debt clock grow astro-
nomically higher has real implications 
for the future of our country and for 
our citizens. While many out there 
would like to believe that we can go on 
spending without some sort of re-
straint and it doesn’t have any con-
sequences, common sense tells us that 
is not true. 
Because of overspending, the debt 
held by Americans has already eclipsed 
the size of our economy and will top 200 
percent of the GDP by 2051. Every 
American, adult and child, bears a bur-
den of more than $85,000. 
The problem is so stark that our 
country spends about $800 million per 
day on interest payments alone. The 
net interest costs for taxpayers financ-
ing this debt will skyrocket from 1.4 
percent of GDP, about $300 billion this 
year, to 8.6 percent of GDP. That would 
be more than 21⁄2 times higher than 
what the U.S. currently spends on de-
fense as a percent of our GDP. 
Another way to look at this problem 
is through the lens of any family budg-
et and take away some zeros. 
Let’s say in 2020 an individual made 
$34,000. That same person spent $65,000, 
meaning they spent $31,000 they didn’t 
have. And they also had a credit card 
with $280,000 already on it and growing. 
This would clearly be absurd and 
unsustainable, yet somehow that is 
how the Federal Government operates. 
Madam Speaker, American families 
understand that we should tackle the 
spending problem first and live within 
our means. This has to be the focus of 
our body. It is our duty and our respon-
sibility to those we represent. 
We have got to tackle the out-of-con-
trol spending before it brings down this 
great Nation. We need to stop mort-
gaging our grandkids’ future just to 
sustain and spend our lifestyle today. 
Madam Speaker, we need to do the 
hard work now to address our spending, 
balance the budget, and fiscally secure 
our Nation for future generations. Our 
constituents deserve it. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, the 
Biden administration has put them-
selves on the side of Big Government, 
big taxes, and big bureaucracy. 
To paraphrase the great President 
Ronald Reagan, he said: You can’t be 
for Big Government and still fight for 
the little guy. 
Our budget is a clear outline for mid-
dle and working-class Americans that 
their government hasn’t left them be-
hind. We have a plan and it will benefit 
all Americans. 
I am proud of the budget we put to-
gether this year, and I am ready to de-
fend it in front of any committee and 
any Member of this House. 
We have spent the last hour talking 
about conservative principles. Well, I 
want to make it clear that this budget 
is not just for conservatives. It is not 
just for Republicans. It is a budget for 
all Americans. 
It doesn’t matter if your children 
grow up to be Republicans or Demo-
crats. They will be paying for our debts 
regardless, long after we are gone. That 
is why it is important to have leaders 
who are thinking about our grand-
children and great-grandchildren’s fu-
ture. 
It is clear that Joe Biden, KAMALA 
HARRIS, NANCY
PELOSI, and CHUCK 
SCHUMER would rather auction off that 
future in order to pay for an unpopular 
radical agenda. 
The American people need to know 
that we are the captains of this ship 
and we will not let economic doomsday 
destroy America’s future. 
Fiscal responsibility does not have to 
be partisan, which is why I am calling 
on my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to help us bring this budget to the 
floor for a vote. 
I thank everyone who supported this 
budget tonight and to everyone who 
helped us put it together. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
AMERICAN FAMILIES PLAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. BOWMAN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, to-
night, I am pleased to be joined by 
many of my colleagues in the Congres-
sional 
Progressive 
Caucus 
to 
talk 
about the long overdue investment we 
would need to make in the care econ-
omy, something that our infrastruc-
ture has always relied upon. 
I introduced the Care for All Agenda 
earlier this spring calling for the Fed-
eral Government to dramatically ex-
pand and strengthen the care economy. 
The American Families Plan outlines 
the next step we need to take to get 
there, which must include improving 
work conditions and compensation for 
care workers nationwide. 
The care economy impacts all of us: 
Our children, elderly loved ones, family 
members with disabilities, childcare 
workers, home health aides, nurses, 
and so many more. Care is something 
we all need at different stages in our 
lives. 
The care economy includes our essen-
tial workers who put their lives on the 
line every day during the most dev-
astating global pandemic in a century. 
Many of us will be caregivers ourselves, 
if we haven’t been one yet. 
Ask any working family about how 
hard it has been to find affordable, 
quality childcare even before COVID. 
Ask a childcare worker if they can 
afford to send their own child to the 
center they work at. 
Ask any one of the vast majority of 
workers who do not have paid family 
and medical leave how hard it is to 
care for a loved one who is ill while 
holding on to their job. 
Ask anyone who qualifies for long- 
term care under Medicaid but has been 
unable 
to 
access 
it 
due 
to 
the 
healthcare workforce shortage. 
Ask a home health aide how much 
they make hourly, and the need to re-
design our care infrastructure will be-
come abundantly clear. 
Just as our physical infrastructure is 
crumbling, the United States today 
suffers from a lack of care infrastruc-
ture. These two truths are intertwined. 
Our crumbling infrastructure dis-
proportionately harms Black, Brown, 
Indigenous and low-income commu-
nities. The negative health impacts 
arising from fossil fuel use, industrial 
pollution, and toxic materials in our 
homes and schools are literally making 
us sick. 
We need to invest in eliminating car-
bon emissions, and we also need to in-
vest in the caregivers we are counting 
on to heal us now. 
We are calling for a broader shift to 
a society based on care for the people, 
communities, and the planet we share. 
We are still grieving more than 
600,000 lives lost to COVID in our coun-
try, many of them caregivers them-
selves. In this last year, we saw how 
badly we need a robust care economy 
and what happens when our investment 
in care doesn’t match our needs. 
I know that for some, talking about 
caregiving as infrastructure sounds 
like a new idea and a ‘‘nice to have.’’ 
None of this work is new, and all of it 
is necessary. 
I have heard directly from New York-
ers who rely on caregivers every day; 
like a constituent of mine in West-
chester, who was born with diastrophic 
dysplasia, and wrote in about how we 
need to do better by our caregivers and 
pay them a living wage. Now in her fif-
ties, she qualifies for Medicaid and 
needs home-based care. The home 
health aide who cares for her has to 
work two additional jobs to make ends 
meet. That should give us all pause. 
One of the biggest champions for 
caregivers and domestic workers, Ai- 
jen Poo, said that: ‘‘The definition of 
infrastructure is that which enables so-
ciety and the economy to function. So

what is more fundamental than the 
ability to take care of our loved ones?’’ 
Caregiving is almost always provided 
by women, especially Black and Brown 
women. This work has historically 
been made invisible, which creates op-
portunities for the exploitation and 
poverty wages many of our caregivers 
face without protection or recourse. 
When it comes to finding care, mil-
lions of families are left with no option 
but to figure it out, which we know so 
often means women not taking paid 
work in order to provide unpaid care 
for their own families. 
The American Families Plan will 
help us bring the care economy out of 
the shadows with key investments in 
childcare, paid leave, Medicaid, home 
and community-based services, and 
more. 
This goes so much deeper than mak-
ing it possible for families to enter and 
remain in the workforce. We need to 
ask ourselves what kind of systems and 
structures we want in place not only 
for people to survive, but also to thrive 
and reach their full potential. 
Given how common it is to need care 
and not get it, we must ask ourselves: 
Are we, as a nation, structured to lis-
ten? Are we structured to care? 
We need to listen to the caregivers 
and the families who rely on them so 
that we make the most powerful in-
vestments that will not only boost our 
economy, but also allow us to heal and 
truly move forward as a society. 
We need to rebuild our Nation with a 
new foundation; a foundation rooted in 
love, care, and equality. That is the 
kind of thinking we need in the infra-
structure package. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
yield to my other colleagues who will 
highlight other critical care economy 
needs. I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL), the chair of 
the Congressional Progressive Caucus. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman BOWMAN for yield-
ing to me and also for his tremendous 
leadership in the Progressive Caucus. 
We are so proud to welcome him into 
the Progressive Caucus, into Congress, 
and to have the benefit of his tremen-
dous 
experience 
in 
education, 
in 
caregiving, on so many fronts. I am so 
proud to cosponsor the Care resolution 
with the gentleman. I think it is a very 
important statement. 
Madam Speaker, I am also very 
proud to be here as the chair of the 
Congressional Progressive Caucus. This 
is our Special Order hour that we get 
to devote to any topic that we want; 
and, today, it is a real privilege and an 
honor to devote it to the American 
Families Plan. 
Why? 
Because the American Families Plan 
and the American Jobs Plan are what 
this country needs and what this coun-
try wants. Democrats, Republicans, 
and Independents across the country 
have said clearly that they are ready 
for a big, bold investment that allows 
us, allows America, to build back bet-
ter. 
That is what the President has pro-
posed because, Madam Speaker, at the 
core of any society is how we care and 
look out for each other. That reality 
was made undeniably clear as we have 
struggled to overcome the COVID–19 
pandemic, with over 600,000 deaths. 
And at the root of our recovery is 
how we look out for each other, how we 
give each other opportunities, how we 
ensure that America truly is a country 
where we are all better off when we are 
all better off. 
For me, coming to this country by 
myself at the age of 16, now getting to 
serve in the United States Congress as 
the 
first 
South 
Asian-American 
woman, I have watched how too many 
people across America do not have that 
opportunity. They do not have the in-
vestments that we, as a Federal Gov-
ernment, should make in order for 
them to be successful. 
Now, our care economy is broad. I am 
not 
just 
talking 
about 
essential 
healthcare providers, like nurses and 
doctors who cared for patients struck 
by COVID–19. I am talking about the 
broader care infrastructure, and that 
includes childcare. It includes home- 
and community-care services. And it 
includes providing everyone with basic 
paid family and medical leave and 
more. 
The American Families Plan also in-
cludes investing in healthcare for ev-
eryone across America, investing in 
education, the kind of education that 
gave me my opportunity to come here. 
We need to provide that 2 years of free 
community college or college for peo-
ple across this country so that they 
can get the additional skills they need. 
We need to invest in housing and, of 
course, we need to invest in this broad-
er care economy. 
At the end of the day, our American 
Families Plan, the President’s Amer-
ican Families Plan, the jobs plan, has 
to be about every person across this 
country, working-class, poor, people 
who are seeking opportunity, people 
who deserve to have the American 
Dream that is no more; to make sure 
that every person, White, Black, and 
Brown, with understanding that the 
disproportionate burden of our inequi-
ties and racial injustices in the United 
States have fallen on Black, Brown, 
and Indigenous people, we need to 
make sure that all people are taken 
care of and have opportunity. 
b 1900 
Care infrastructure is the critical in-
frastructure that allows our families 
and communities to thrive and stay 
healthy. 
Take, for instance, the home care 
workers across the country who have 
been serving on the front lines of the 
pandemic. For those most vulnerable 
to COVID, such as people with disabil-
ities and seniors, home care workers 
were often the difference between life 
and death. Home care workers allowed 
many of those most vulnerable to avoid 
congregate settings, like nursing and 
group homes, that saw a high spread of 
COVID. 
Yet, this critical workforce shrunk 
by 280,000 people at the beginning of 
the pandemic, despite an increasing 
need for home care services. That is 
why the Biden administration has pro-
posed investing $400 billion to expand 
the home care workforce, something I 
was very proud to help negotiate last 
year as part of our Unity Task Force 
on healthcare. 
But we can’t stop there, and the 
American Families Plan doesn’t stop 
there. The American Families Plan 
also recognizes that the majority of 
caregivers, as Mr. BOWMAN said, are 
women and disproportionately women 
of color. Many of them are responsible 
for care at home, which is a huge rea-
son why we have seen women forced 
out of the workforce in record num-
bers. 
In December 2020 alone, women ac-
counted for nearly all the jobs lost, 
with a disproportionately high number 
of job losses coming from women of 
color. 
That is why we need robust invest-
ments in universal childcare. No fam-
ily, regardless of income, should pay 
more than 7 percent of their income on 
childcare. And we have to eliminate 
administrative barriers, like work re-
quirements, that make it much more 
difficult for low-income White, Black, 
Brown, and indigenous people to access 
childcare. 
Finally, we have to ensure strong 
labor standards for this care workforce. 
We cannot entrust people to care for 
the most valuable people in our lives 
and deny them a living wage, the right 
to join a union, and paid leave. These 
workers give our loved ones dignity. 
They give so many of us the ability to 
work outside of our homes to support 
our families. 
As we talk about domestic workers, I 
am so proud to have the Domestic 
Workers Bill of Rights that I have in-
troduced in Congress. Let’s remember 
that this care work is the work that al-
lows all other work to be possible. 
This is an important moment for us 
to pass the American Families Plan to 
invest 
in 
education, 
to 
invest 
in 
healthcare, to lower the Medicare eligi-
bility age, to take on prescription 
drugs, and to invest in this oh-so-im-
portant care economy. It is time to de-
liver for the American people so we 
continue to build back better and en-
sure that everyone has the support 
they need. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. TAKANO), my friend. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New York 
for his work. We are indeed friends. We 
both were teachers, Mr. BOWMAN
a 
principal. We are educators at heart. 
To recover from one of the worst eco-
nomic crises we have faced as a Nation, 
we must invest in families, our care 
economy, and our Nation’s childcare. 
For most American families, quality 
childcare 
and 
preschool

unaffordable. 
In 
Riverside 
County, 
where my district, the 41st District of 
California, is located, it is unavailable. 
My district is a childcare desert. My 
constituents do not have childcare lo-
cations available, even if eligible, to 
help them care for their children while 
they attend school or work. 
It doesn’t have to be this way, and it 
shouldn’t be this way. In fact, we 
should use our path toward recovery as 
an opportunity to address the dispari-
ties communities like mine have been 
facing when it comes to affordable 
childcare options. The American Fami-
lies Plan will secure universal access 
to preschool and will expand the supply 
of quality childcare options for all fam-
ilies. 
Studies have proven that quality pre-
school will positively impact children’s 
cognitive, behavioral, and social-emo-
tional development that is critical for 
their long-term success and mental 
health. If we are serious about invest-
ing in our children’s education, we 
must provide universal preschool and 
affordable childcare for every child in 
need. 
Investing in preschool and affordable 
childcare will not only help our chil-
dren, but will also greatly benefit our 
workforce. As more preschools and 
childcare centers are available, more 
families can get back to work without 
worrying about their child’s well-being. 
This is our opportunity to help strug-
gling families and take bold action to 
create a just and equitable post-COVID 
economy. I urge my colleagues to in-
vest in our care economy by supporting 
the American Families Plan Act. 
We just can’t go back to the way 
things were before. We have to be bold 
and act with urgency to give families 
and parents access to the resources 
they need to help our country bounce 
back stronger than ever before. 
Let me just close with a short anec-
dote, a short story. This happened on 
the weekend, the Friday before the Me-
morial Day weekend. I, as chairman of 
the 
Veterans’ 
Affairs 
Committee, 
joined Secretary McDonough in a cere-
mony to honor our Nation’s veterans at 
the Quantico cemetery. I met the com-
mander of the base, who has responsi-
bility not just for the Marine base that 
is there but also the FBI training cen-
ter. There are a number of different fa-
cilities that are sort of associated with 
the base. 
We just got in a chat, and I wasn’t 
fishing for any sort of answers from 
him or any information. But I said: 
What has been your biggest challenge, 
in terms of reopening your base? 
He said: Congressman, quite surpris-
ingly to me, the biggest challenge has 
been childcare. That is what has held 
us back, and that has been my biggest 
challenge as a base commander. 
I said: Do you think other base com-
manders across the country have had 
the same challenge? 
He said: Yes. 
This challenge of providing quality 
childcare and preschool is something 
that is really holding our road to re-
covery back, and it is slowing it down. 
The American Families Plan is a sound 
and substantive answer to meeting this 
challenge. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. EVANS), my friend. 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from the great State of 
New York for his leadership. In such a 
short period of time, what he has dem-
onstrated to all of us about being a 
leader, I applaud him for this. 
I am pleased to join with my col-
leagues in the Progressive Caucus as 
we continue to advocate for President 
Biden’s American Families Plan and 
investing in the care economy. 
That means things like funding for 
high-quality, affordable childcare, in-
cluding universal pre-K; making sure 
that childcare costs do not exceed 7 
percent of income for working families; 
ensuring that childcare workers, who 
are largely women and people of color, 
have a $15 minimum wage—let me re-
peat 
that—ensuring 
that 
childcare 
workers, who are largely women and 
people of color, have a $15 minimum 
wage; and meaningful investments in 
Medicare home and community-based 
services, which would help workers in 
the home care industry. 
Everyone would like to say they are 
pro-family and pro-children. This is the 
chance to prove it. 
Earlier this month, I joined with 
SEIU members in Philadelphia to rally 
for passing $400 billion for caregiving. I 
told them funding for childcare and 
other caregiving is essential, since we 
actually want people to be able to go 
back to work. 
We started this year off big and bold 
with $1.9 trillion in the American Res-
cue Plan. That was a big step in the 
right direction. It was a down pay-
ment. 
The American people voted into of-
fice a Democratic President, a Demo-
cratic Senate, and a Democratic House. 
As we promise to build back better, 
they expect us to do more than just 
reset the calendar to February 2020. 
The old normal wasn’t so great for mil-
lions of Americans, including many 
Philadelphians I represent. They de-
serve better than the old normal. The 
American Families Plan would do a lot 
to deliver on our promise. Let’s get it 
done. 
Again, I thank Mr. BOWMAN for his 
leadership and the importance of this 
leadership and all the members of the 
Progressive Caucus demonstrating how 
we are going to lead the charge. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
now yield to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. OMAR), my friend. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, as our 
country recovers from this devastating 
pandemic, it is critical we prioritize 
our families. All working families de-
serve to thrive, and that starts with 
ensuring 
high-quality, 
affordable 
childcare. 
This is a generational opportunity to 
invest in affordable, quality care for all 
children, and I urge my colleagues not 
to let it go to waste. 
Right now, the average cost of 
childcare for children under 5 is around 
$10,000 a year. This amount is even 
higher for infants. In my home State of 
Minnesota, we have some of the high-
est childcare costs in the Nation, rank-
ing fourth in the country. 
A minimum-wage worker working 
full-time in my district in Minneapolis 
would have to work 30 weeks to cover 
the cost of childcare for one infant. 
This is unconscionable. 
As a mom, I know how difficult it 
can be to find affordable childcare op-
tions and how a lack of childcare im-
pacts all aspects of life, including the 
ability to graduate from college while 
taking care of young children or even 
the ability to find a job and thrive. 
We need universal childcare and pre- 
K for all families, and we need to pay 
our childcare workers a living wage. 
Ensuring affordable, quality care for 
every child and family would stimulate 
the economy and have a lasting benefit 
for children’s development and growth. 
The American Families Plan moves 
us closer to this goal by investing in 
universal preschool, ensuring childcare 
costs do not exceed 7 percent of income 
for working families, and guarantees 
childcare workers make a $15 minimum 
wage. 
I urge my colleagues to ensure that 
women and families are not left behind 
in our recovery. Families across Amer-
ica are counting on us to do the right 
thing. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Hawaii 
(Mr. KAHELE), my brother. 
Mr. 
KAHELE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
mahalo also to my brother and my 
freshman colleague from New York for 
allowing me this opportunity to speak 
about something really important in 
our country, and that is the American 
Families Plan. 
Today, I rise in support of our Na-
tion’s students, the future of America, 
an engaged generation of young Ameri-
cans working to create a better future 
for our country. We must stand with 
them. The time is now to do that, as 
they embark on their journey to 
unlock their potential and achieve 
their dreams. But that journey starts 
with a quality education and the op-
portunity for higher education, the 
great equalizer in our society. 
b 1915 
Now, our children wield tremendous 
potential and remind us to dream big. 
However, too many of our students do 
not have that opportunity because of 
the high costs of public higher edu-
cation. Skyrocketing tuition, applica-
tion fees, student fees, overpriced text-
books, meal plans, dorm plans all con-
tribute to $1.4 trillion in crushing stu-
dent debt and are barriers preventing 
all of America’s children from pursuing 
higher education. 
The American Families Plan will 
change that. The American Families

Plan will enable the opportunity for 
every student across the country to ob-
tain a degree or certificate through a 
community college for free. 
The American Families Plan is built 
to invest in our children from early 
childhood through postsecondary edu-
cation. Most importantly, this plan 
recognizes the importance of investing 
in access to community college. 
Each year thousands of students in 
my home State of Hawaii benefit from 
community colleges across our islands, 
but unfortunately just 50 percent of 
those students are able to complete a 
postsecondary degree of any kind with-
in 6 years of enrolling. As a product of 
community college myself, and an edu-
cator, I know how these public institu-
tions can positively impact our most 
disadvantaged communities, which is 
why for so long I have fought to re-
move barriers to higher education. 
The American Families Plan will re-
define access to education, taking the 
long overdue step of ensuring 2 years of 
free community college for all stu-
dents. This opportunity will invest in 
the future of our students, prepare 
them to compete and succeed in a high-
ly competitive global economy, and 
level the playing field. 
Every child in our country deserves 
the opportunity to live the American 
Dream, but in order to achieve that, we 
must believe, all of us must believe 
that we all have a stake in each other’s 
prosperity. 
President Biden’s vision in the Amer-
ican Families Plan is a defining mo-
ment in our Nation’s history and will 
give American children head starts and 
pave the way for the best-educated gen-
eration in U.S. history. 
America’s students have an amazing 
opportunity to pursue education be-
yond high school. Let us give them 
that opportunity. 
Mahalo, Madam Speaker, and my col-
league from New York. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Thank you so much, 
Mr. KAHELE. I now yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, it is great to stand here with 
Representative BOWMAN, with our col-
league JAN
SCHAKOWSKY, with Mr. 
KAHELE, with all of our brothers and 
sisters in Congress to say that we can 
and we must, and we will do so much 
better right now for our working par-
ents, our workers, our kids. 
As we recover from the pandemic and 
Build Back Better, we can’t forget 
about the people who make up what we 
call the care economy—nursing home 
workers, home caregivers, childcare 
providers, and others who work every 
day to better the lives of other people. 
Why is care work so important? The 
care economy has been central to my 
own life. I started my career helping 
nursing home workers organize with 
SEIU, but I think most parents can tell 
you about the importance of childcare 
in their own words. 
Personally, I think back to the birth 
of my first son, Koby, and how so much 
of those early years were spent jug-
gling schedules with my wife to raise 
our son. I would stay home with the 
baby during the day so Mary could 
teach in public school, and then she 
would rush home and tap in while I 
took law school classes in the after-
noon and evening. Ultimately, we had 
three kids under 5 in the house and 
later four kids altogether. It was joyful 
and exhilarating, but it was chal-
lenging and there was just no way we 
could have done it alone. 
Providing quality childcare to every 
family in this country means providing 
every parent the opportunity to cher-
ish raising their child or their children 
without fear of losing their income, of 
losing their job, of losing their career. 
Right now, in Michigan a year’s worth 
of childcare for an infant costs well 
over $10,000 on average. Who can afford 
that? 
A record number of women have 
dropped out of the workforce during 
the pandemic. From August to Sep-
tember of last year alone, in one 
month, 865,000 women left the work-
force. They didn’t become unemployed. 
They left the workforce because of 
their responsibility for caregiving. And 
job gains in the recovery so far are dis-
proportionately going to men. 
In this crisis, we have an opportunity 
to Build Back Better and right this his-
toric inequity. President Biden’s Amer-
ican Families Plan and its investment 
in childcare won’t just save families 
money by fully or partially covering 
their childcare costs. It will also create 
good-paying jobs that will go predomi-
nantly to women and people of color. 
The poverty rate for early educators 
in my State of Michigan is 18.9 percent, 
much higher, almost double compared 
to the 10.8 percent rate for Michigan 
workers overall. Nearly half of U.S. 
childcare workers receive public in-
come support. These statistics are to-
tally unacceptable. 
We need to take better care of the 
people taking care of our children and 
our seniors, and we can start by raising 
their wages to $15 an hour by 2025 with 
no subminimum wages. That would 
lead to higher quality care and allow 
workers to provide for their own fami-
lies. 
Let’s 
remember, 
high 
quality 
childcare and preschool don’t just ben-
efit working parents and the workers 
involved. They benefit our kids most of 
all. The data on the return on invest-
ment of investing in early education in 
childcare is overwhelming in terms of 
these kids’ whole lives, their academic 
accomplishment, their earnings later 
in life. 
There is so much at stake. We can’t 
afford to let childcare become a bar-
gaining chip in the next round of nego-
tiations. Strengthening families, cre-
ating jobs, and giving kids the support 
they need to thrive should be the cen-
terpiece of our work, not an after-
thought. I am thrilled that the Presi-
dent’s plan recognizes that. 
Our work in this space won’t end 
once we get the American Families 
Plan signed into law. I believe we need 
to create a system of free universal 
childcare and that our caregivers de-
serve far better pay, benefits, training, 
and protection across the board. The 
American Families Plan is a great 
start and brings us closer to that goal. 
Let’s get it done. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. BOWMAN 
for his leadership in this. 
Mr. BOWMAN. I now yield to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate Congressman BOWMAN’s or-
ganizing this on behalf of the Congres-
sional Progressive Caucus, which I am 
so proud to be a member of, and I real-
ly am grateful to him. 
Let me just say this in no uncertain 
terms. Care infrastructure is infra-
structure, and it is especially true for 
women whose opportunities are often 
limited because we don’t really have a 
working care economy right now. 
Every single day nearly 10,000 people 
turn 65 years old in the United States 
of America, and yet we do not have in 
the United States a long-term-care pol-
icy. Think about it. The United States 
of America does not have a real long- 
term-care policy. 
Every family tries to figure out for 
itself, What are we going to do when 
grandma and grandpa get older? What 
are we going to do when I get older? 
What is the plan? Most people when 
they retire or have to retire actually 
don’t have enough money to really 
make the kinds of decisions that they 
need to and will come up. 
Of the people who turn 65, between 50 
and 70 percent at that time need some 
sort of support or care. Where does 
that come from? Let me be clear; it 
mostly comes from women. 
There is a sociologist who says many 
countries have a safety net; the United 
States has women. Paid and unpaid 
caregivers are women. 
Let’s talk about the paid caregivers 
first. People who work in nursing 
homes, people who work in home care. 
They make an average of about $12 an 
hour, with no benefits. You can’t live 
on that. They certainly can’t plan for 
their retirement and to pay for some-
one to care for them. 
And so what do we do? It is pretty 
clear what has to be done, and actually 
the Biden administration has actually 
begun to do it, because everyone should 
be able to provide and care for their 
families at any age, for childcare, and 
certainly for long-term care for the el-
derly, which is a particular concern of 
mine. 
I am the co-chair of the Democratic 
Caucus Task Force on Aging and Fami-
lies, and I am proud of that, coming up 
with proposals that are going to help 
our elderly. It is projected that right 
now we will need about 4 million addi-
tional caregivers, people who are either 
paid or unpaid, by 2028. That is just 
really around the corner. 4 million. We 
do not have enough. 
First of all, we have to pay the work-
ers a living wage. Now, President Biden

June 15, 2021 
has come up with a plan for $400 billion 
for home and community-based care. 
That is a lot of money. It can be a 
game changer. 
The idea is to be able to provide more 
money, more wages for those who suit 
up every day and go to work, and dur-
ing the pandemic often in very dan-
gerous situations where they don’t 
have enough of the PPE, the personal 
protective equipment, to take care of 
them and protect them against the 
virus. They suit up every day and go to 
work and can barely take care of their 
own families. 
And what about all the women who 
have had to leave the workforce be-
cause they did not have anyone to care 
for their children or for their parents 
or both? The sandwich generation has 
to worry about making sure that they 
have someone to care for their children 
and someone who will help them to 
take care of their elderly relatives. 
That burden has fallen on women who 
have ended up having to leave the 
workforce. 
We need to act now. We need to act 
to fill this gap, to have a real program 
for long-term care, to have real help 
for childcare so that women can go to 
work to care for their families, to have 
the income that it really takes. 
This is not rocket science. It is that 
we need to pay attention. We need to 
have the policies in place. We need to 
have the infrastructure in place, the 
plan on how we are going to deliver the 
care that is needed. Without it, we will 
not be able to move forward economi-
cally in this country, and certainly 
women will pay, especially pay, the 
price, and often it is women that are 
low income, women of color that suffer. 
b 1930 
So I am happy that we are seeing the 
Biden administration, we are seeing 
the Democrats, we are seeing the pro-
gressives move forward with that plan 
that will actually provide the infra-
structure we need. 
And let me just end by saying that 
care infrastructure is infrastructure. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Massa-
chusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY), my friend and 
sister. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New York, 
my friend and colleague, for convening 
us this evening. 
Care work is the backbone of our Na-
tion’s economy. Yet, for too long, pol-
icymakers have failed to make the 
critical investments needed to ensure 
that everyone, at all stages of life, has 
access to the high-quality care they 
need and deserve, and that our care 
workers are compensated for their es-
sential work with livable wages. Their 
work is essential and so, too, are their 
lives. 
I rise today on behalf of our Nation’s 
care workers, whose labor continues to 
be undervalued, undermined, and un-
protected, despite its essential role in 
our society. 
I rise to lend my voice to the thou-
sands of care workers, disproportion-
ately Black and Brown women, who 
spend hours upon hours meeting the 
care needs of others, children, the el-
derly, and people with disabilities. 
Caregivers often juggling work while 
also providing care for their own fami-
lies and struggling to cover the most 
basic of needs. 
I want to take a moment to speak 
specifically on the critical role of home 
and community-based services. During 
the COVID–19 crisis and long before, 
these services have been a lifeline, sup-
porting people from all walks of life 
with critical medical care in their 
home or community. This is an issue of 
quality care, of healthcare justice, of 
disability justice, and of liberty. 
Again, 
throughout 
the 
pandemic, 
home and community-based services 
were a lifeline for so many, but the in-
frastructure 
needs 
resources. 
The 
Biden administration has proposed a 
historic investment in HCBS to meet 
the scale of the need and demand. This 
proposed investment is an investment 
in healthcare justice, but also an in-
vestment in human infrastructure, in 
our essential workers. 
We must make these services readily 
available and compensate our home 
care workers, the majority of whom 
are women of color, with a living wage. 
To build back better, we must center 
the people. We must invest in our com-
munities and affirm that a better world 
is possible, a more just world, where 
every person can thrive. 
We have a once-in-a-generation op-
portunity to legislate our values and to 
create a more just and caring America 
that takes care of everyone who calls 
this great Nation home. 
Passing a robust infrastructure pack-
age that affirms care is infrastructure 
would leave a profound legacy. 
Today, on the floor of the House of 
Representatives, we reaffirm our com-
mitment to building a nation where 
every person can live and thrive with 
dignity. 
As we craft a legislative response 
that actualizes that vision, we must 
make plain that what is needed in this 
moment of unprecedented economic 
crisis is bold, intentional legislation 
that recognizes the dignity and human-
ity of all workers, and affirms the right 
to meaningful, dignified work and a 
livable wage. 
Earlier this year, I introduced a con-
gressional resolution calling for a Fed-
eral job guarantee, which would pro-
vide every person in America with an 
enforceable legal right to a quality job. 
Extending beyond a project-based ap-
proach, our resolution calls for the cre-
ation of Federal jobs on projects that 
meet long-neglected community, phys-
ical and human infrastructure needs, 
such as delivering high-quality care for 
children and seniors, building and sus-
taining 21st century transit systems, 
strengthening our neighborhoods, and 
protecting the environment. 
That is the type of bold, necessary 
approach we should bring to this proc-
ess and beyond. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has exacer-
bated many of these challenges and 
laid bare the deep inequities and dis-
parities in our Nation. 
From paid family and medical leave 
to home and community-based serv-
ices, to universal childcare, to a dig-
nified living wage and beyond, the peo-
ple demand responsive policy that 
speaks to their lived experiences and 
struggles. The people are counting on 
us to deliver. 
So let me make it plain: Any infra-
structure package must deliver for our 
care workers, and it must take care of 
the people, because the care economy 
is critical infrastructure. 
In this moment, as we fight for a 
strong economic recovery, we must 
also work to build a better, a more 
just, and more equitable economy than 
ever before. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, the 
American Families Plan recognizes 
that childcare is infrastructure, and 
that it is not enough to settle for any 
childcare that enables a parent to go to 
work. This needs to be high-quality 
childcare that every child can access. 
Babies are born learners, and it is 
well established by brain science that a 
child’s environment and interactions in 
the first 1,000 days of life, whether posi-
tive or negative and long before they 
enter a kindergarten classroom, are 
highly formative during this critical 
period for learning and growth. 
When those formative early child-
hood experiences include inadequate 
nutrition, homelessness on other ad-
verse childhood experiences, or ACEs, 
such as those brought on by a global 
pandemic, we know that a child’s brain 
and body are changed in ways that are 
linked to poor health and learning out-
comes later in life. 
Without reliable supports in place to 
buffer our kids from the stress, that 
stress can quickly turn toxic. 
The good news is that ACEs are pre-
ventable on a national scale if we are 
collectively willing to put in the in-
vestment worthy of our kids. 
As the Representative for New York’s 
16th District and a former educator and 
school leader, I believe our goal for 
healthy early childhood development 
needs to be more ambitious than the 
prevention of ACEs, which aims to pro-
tect our kids from the worse effects of 
stress and trauma. That should be the 
floor. 
We, ourselves, need to move past a 
scarcity framework and embrace a 
framework of shared abundance. 
That looks like affordable, reliable 
access 
to 
quality 
childcare 
where 
young children, in the context of an 
intergenerational community, are em-
powered to explore themselves and 
their world with pure wonder; where 
they grow into self-directed learners, 
collaborative 
leaders, 
and 
adaptive 
community-centered problem solvers. 
Madam Speaker, I now would like to 
speak a little bit about the child tax

credit. The child tax credit has been in 
place for years, and it is supposed to 
help offset the many expenses of rais-
ing 
children. 
This 
includes 
food, 
childcare, diapers, healthcare, cloth-
ing, and taxes. 
But before the American Rescue 
Plan, it wasn’t accessible to the fami-
lies who needed it most because it 
wasn’t fully refundable. Families that 
didn’t earn enough income could not 
benefit. 
The American Rescue Plan changed 
that when it enacted a much-needed 
expansion of the child tax credit, mak-
ing it fully refundable and increasing 
the maximum credit from $2,000 per 
child to $3,000 per child up through age 
17, and $3,600 per child for children 
under age 6. 
Because of the American Rescue 
Plan, nearly 66 million children will 
benefit from the child tax credit, mak-
ing this the single largest contributor 
to reducing child poverty. 
In my district, which includes the 
Bronx and Westchester, 124,400 children 
will gain from the expanded child tax 
credit. 
The average benefit for 41,800 house-
holds in my district is $2,800, lifting 
9,200 children out of poverty and 4,700 
children out of deep poverty. 
This is historic, but we can’t be satis-
fied with reducing child poverty. We 
need to completely end child poverty 
and eliminate it. 
The American Families Plan would 
extend the child tax credit increases 
from 
the 
American 
Rescue 
Plan 
through 2025. The infrastructure we 
want for building back better shouldn’t 
tolerate childhood poverty, and the 
American Families Plan moves us for-
ward on that necessary path. 
Before I close, I want to use my time 
on the House floor to share the experi-
ence of a New Yorker who needs home 
care services and wrote into my office. 
Her experience seeking care paints a 
very telling picture about the state of 
our care economy, and makes the case 
for the strong investments in the 
American Families Plan that we have 
heard tonight. 
She shared that seniors and people 
with disabilities like her struggle to 
find the home care she needs because 
the job pays under $13 an hour in most 
of New York State. 
One week into the COVID lockdown, 
her home health aide contracted the 
virus from a relative, a nursing home 
worker who contracted it through their 
own caregiving job. 
The first health aide has been unable 
to return to work because the virus has 
caused long-term complications from 
their immediate family members, for 
whom they are the primary caregiver. 
Just 1 week after her first health 
aide contracted the virus, a second 
health aide fell ill. 
While the second health aide did re-
cover, the health aide’s childcare pro-
vider closed permanently. 
The second health aide wants to re-
turn to work, but, due to the low 
wages, 
they 
are 
unable 
to 
afford 
childcare. 
Not being able to find a full-time 
health aide to provide her care means 
she is unable to receive assistance with 
all of her needs. Some days she only 
gets help to eat and use the toilet once 
per day. She cannot shower as fre-
quently as she would like. 
She shared: ‘‘I live in constant fear 
that should something happen to my 
health aide, that my literal independ-
ence will be taken from me overnight. 
I don’t know when this situation will 
improve, and I have no other resources 
to lean on should my situation wors-
en.’’ 
The solution, however, is simple. We 
need home care jobs to be recognized 
and treated as quality, dignified jobs 
with family-sustaining wages. If we 
pay home care workers a living wage, 
these jobs will be filled immediately 
because of the high demand. We need to 
ensure our home care jobs never be-
come minimum wage jobs again. 
I want to thank her for sharing her 
personal experience and allowing me to 
share it tonight. It goes to show how 
connected and interdependent we all 
are on one another and the care econ-
omy. 
We need to meet this dire moment 
with a substantial, transformative in-
vestment in the care economy, and we 
must do that with the American Fami-
lies Plan. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF ISSUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we are back here after 3 weeks in our 
districts, and I think our minds should 
probably be on the border and the 
thousands of people—tens of thousands 
of 
people 
streaming 
across 
every 
month, or perhaps on the economic 
problems caused by higher inflation. 
But, instead, there was a few brief 
statements made by one of our promi-
nent TV anchors that causes me to feel 
I have to speak tonight. 
While we were gone, we celebrated 
both Memorial Day and the hundreds 
of thousands of American soldiers who 
have died for our freedoms. We cele-
brated another anniversary of D-day, 
the landing in Europe. And when we 
think about Memorial Day, we can’t 
help but remember other names of bat-
tles during World War II: Okinawa, Iwo 
Jima, the Battle of the Midway, the 
Battle of the Bulge, as well as all the 
soldiers who died fighting the com-
munists in Vietnam and Korea. 
It is a time for superlatives talking 
about the heroic efforts of these great 
men and women. 
Unfortunately, on a formerly major 
network, NBC or MSNBC, Brian Wil-
liams decided to compare or supposedly 
compliment all of our brave troops by 
comparing them to people who fight 
under the most evil banner I think that 
has existed, or one of the two most evil 
banners that has existed in the last 100 
years, and that is the banner of antifa. 
b 1945 
Antifa is an organization. If we had 
their flag here before us, it is virtually 
identical to the flag used by the com-
munists in the early 1920s in Nazi Ger-
many. The socialist flag at the time, 
the communist flag, allied with the So-
viet Union, which at the time millions 
of people were dying as they adjusted 
to life without the czar and life under 
communism. 
The Soviet armies were soon respon-
sible for killing millions and millions 
of Ukrainians as they guarded the food 
so the kulaks would starve to death, 
the communist armies that in Red 
China caused tens of millions of deaths, 
the communist armies in Cambodia, 
these countries with their anti-God 
philosophy, proud in Red China when 
the 
final 
Christian 
churches 
were 
closed. 
Of all things, to compare our troops 
at D-day with antifa, I cannot imagine 
a greater insult to give these soldiers. 
I wish more of them were still alive so 
they could respond to seeing on tele-
vision a TV anchor trying to compare 
them—these brave men to keep the 
world free—to compare them to antifa, 
a group whose flag is almost identical 
to the communist flag. 
By the way, it is not surprising that 
we have a red flag for Nazi Germany 
and a red flag for the Soviet Union. 
Red at the time stood for socialism. 
Our young children should be edu-
cated on the comparisons between the 
two. During the 1920s, there were times 
when both ideologies entered into joint 
strikes because they both wanted to 
get rid of what existed of a free coun-
try in Germany at the time. 
We would like to hear from NBC. 
Shame on you, NBC, the once-proud 
network. Would you respond to the 
statements by Brian Williams com-
paring the men who died at D-day, the 
men who landed on European soil to 
free Europe? Will you respond to your 
anchor implying they were the equiva-
lent of antifa, a group connected with 
communism? Shame on that once- 
proud number one network in America. 
What do you think of what you have 
done? 
The next issue I would like to com-
ment on that I heard about again and 
again when I was back is an issue that 
is not surprising. To a certain extent, 
some of the policies of the past are re-
sponsible for this, but recently, we 
have had a new round of checks go out, 
a greater increase in the money supply, 
both M1 and M2. 
Not surprising, when the government 
prints money, we see an increase in the 
amount of gasoline, an increase in food 
prices led by an increase in soybeans, 
an increase in lumber, and massive in-
creases in homebuilding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2813 
June 15, 2021 
I am scared to death for the younger 
generation as a new economic ideology 
seems to have taken over in which 
there is a feeling that you can spend 
yourself into prosperity. When I look 
at the degree to which housing costs 
have skyrocketed within the last year, 
it is perhaps not surprising, given the 
degree to which money is being print-
ed. But it is going to be much more dif-
ficult for a young couple to buy that 
first house today compared to 12 years 
ago. 
It is important that everybody in 
this Chamber sit back and question the 
idea that is being approved by the Fed-
eral Reserve that America can become 
wealthier just by printing money. 
America will not become wealthier by 
printing money. America will have in-
flation, and that inflation will strike 
hardest at commodity prices and hard-
est at housing. 
So everybody in this Chamber, before 
we vote for any more spending bills, 
ought to look at the rather boring 
charts of M1 and M2 as we analyze the 
money supply and look at the cost of 
all commodities over the last year as 
this Chamber has decided that the way 
to create prosperity is to print more 
money. 
I do feel it is also important to ad-
dress one more time the crisis at the 
border and the variety of bad things 
happening because of that crisis and 
not caring like we did only a few 
months ago as to who crosses the bor-
der. 
I don’t think we have spent enough 
time addressing the drug crisis in 
America. It has been around so long, it 
becomes boring even to think about it. 
Except recently, we hit the point at 
which 90,000 Americans had died of 
drug overdoses in a 12-month period. 
When I talk to people at the border 
or my local drug enforcement adminis-
tration, they both agree that this is in 
part happening because more drugs are 
coming across the border. In part, it is 
predictable that more drugs are coming 
across the border because it is easier to 
get across the border. More people are 
crossing the border. But even more so, 
as marijuana becomes legalized in the 
country, it is no longer profitable to 
bring marijuana across the southern 
border. 
I heard an anecdote of a significant 
amount of marijuana coming across 
the border, and the people who owned 
it couldn’t sell it. Because the mari-
juana produced by the now-legalized 
agriculture operations in the United 
States—not surprisingly, because we 
now do genetic engineering, that sort 
of thing—the marijuana produced in 
the United States in States like Colo-
rado and Washington is superior to the 
marijuana brought across the Mexican 
border. 
Well, if the Mexican drug cartels can-
not make money selling marijuana or 
bringing marijuana across the border, 
how are they going to make it up? 
They are going to make it up by bring-
ing more and more dangerous drugs— 
meth, cocaine, heroin, but above all, 
fentanyl. They are going to bring more 
and more fentanyl across the southern 
border. Now, we have 90,000 deaths in 
this country in 1 year. 
A little bit of my district touches 
Milwaukee County, not a huge county, 
by nationwide standards, about a mil-
lion people. Last year, 540 people died 
of drug overdoses in Milwaukee Coun-
ty. There were about 200 murders, 
which is the all-time record, and every-
body couldn’t believe 200 murders. 
There were over 500 illegal overdoses. 
Now, what do we do about that? Well, 
clearly, one of the things we have to do 
is we have to prevent these drugs from 
coming into the country in the first 
place. It is disappointing that we put 
the security of the border on the back 
burner and think of excuses not to deal 
with it. 
But in addition to thinking of all the 
people running across the border, take 
a minute to think about the 90,000 peo-
ple, many very young people, dying pri-
marily of fentanyl but also other ille-
gal drug overdoses, and ask yourself: 
What is this body going to do to stop 
it? 
Of course, other problems are at the 
border. We have gone from checking in 
or touching about 17,000 people a 
month to 180,000 people a month. As far 
as got-aways, people who aren’t even 
checked in, our Border Patrol esti-
mates we have gone from about 6,000 
this time last year to about 30,000 
now—just massive increases. 
I would guess between got-aways and 
people who are checked into the coun-
try, we are looking at 60,000 or 70,000 a 
month instead of under 10,000 a month 
at this time last year. It is truly a cri-
sis. 
Quite frankly, this body ought to be 
doing nothing else but dealing with 
that crisis until it is solved. The fact 
that we had under 10,000 people cross-
ing the border only 4 or 5 months ago 
shows it is not something we don’t 
know how to solve or that it is impos-
sible to solve. It is that we are will-
ingly 
allowing 
a 
massive 
increase 
across the border. 
Of course, that massive increase, 
since the drug cartels charge people to 
come here, also increases the power of 
those drug cartels, both in the United 
States and their country. It, to a de-
gree, results in separation of children 
from their families, as unaccompanied 
children come here, as well as a given 
number of children are probably rented 
by people to come here because they 
know supposed intact families have a 
better chance of being allowed in this 
country than single people, who are 
still frequently turned around. 
In any event, there is a brief sum-
mary of issues. I hope I was enjoyable. 
And I hope NBC will let us know what 
they were thinking when Brian Wil-
liams decided to say that our soldiers 
landing on D-day were like antifa. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Holy God, known to us in countless 
ways, we seek to magnify Your glo-
rious Name. 
Lord, You are worthy of our praise, 
for You have been our help in ages 
past. You are our hope for all of our to-
morrows. 
Remind us all that we are temporary 
creatures who long for a sense of per-
manence. Inspire our Senators with the 
knowledge that You are changeless and 
that they can trust that Your mercies 
will endure. 
May our lawmakers continue to de-

VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, a few 
weeks ago, toward the end of the legis-
lative session in Texas, Texas Demo-
crats in the statehouse staged a dra-
matic walkout, denying a quorum and 
preventing the Texas Republican ma-
jority from passing one of the most re-
strictive voting laws in this country. 
Texas Republicans could come back 
and reconsider the law in a special ses-
sion, but the extraordinary measures 
taken by the State Democrats reflect 
the extraordinary damage of the voting 
law. 
Texas Republicans were on the verge 
of passing several alarming restric-
tions: reducing polling hours, elimi-
nating drive-through voting and 24- 
hour voting centers. The proposed law 
would have made it easier for a judge 
to overturn an election and push back 
the start of Sunday voting—a measure 
that seemed designed to interfere with 
voting drives held by Black churches. 
Texas already has some of the strict-
est voting procedures in the country. 
The additional effort, in the wake of 
Donald Trump’s Big Lie, directly tar-
gets all the ways poorer, younger, non- 
White, and typically Democratic voters 
cast their ballots. 
Of course, Texas is only the most re-
cent flashpoint in the nationwide effort 
by Republican legislators to contract 
Americans’ right to vote, as you well 
know, Mr. President. 
The tide of Republican voter suppres-
sion laws is a direct assault on our de-
mocracy and could disenfranchise tens 
of millions of Americans. 
Today, I am proud to say, at the 
Democratic caucus lunch we will host 
the group of Texas Democrats who 
bravely fought the voter suppression 
law in their State. The topic of our dis-
cussion will be about how to come to-
gether to protect voting rights not just 
in Texas but across the country. 
Next week, the Senate will consider 
major voting rights legislation. Con-
gress must take action to defend our 
democracy. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on the 
President’s 
foreign 
trip, 
President 
Biden’s first foreign trip has projected 
a welcome sight to the world: an Amer-
ican President embracing our allies 
and bringing them together to confront 
our common adversaries. 
Already, the President’s visit to G7 
has yielded results: a commitment to 
counter China’s rapacious economic 
policies and unwinding a longstanding 
dispute over tariffs and trade with the 
European Union. 
Now after meeting with our allies at 
both the G7 and at the NATO summit 
in Brussels, the President will meet to-
morrow with Vladimir Putin. From the 
occupation in Crimea to violating po-
litical human rights within its own 
borders, to interfering in democratic 
elections across the Western world, to 
imprisoning those who expose his bru-
tal, undemocratic regime, Vladimir 
Putin has spent the past decade inter-
fering and destabilizing the world 
order.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4524 
June 15, 2021 
For 4 years, former President Trump 
turned a blind eye and gave Putin a 
free pass. In the history of our country, 
Americans had never seen a President 
of the United States support an adver-
sary the way Trump supported Presi-
dent Putin on that stage in Helsinki 
nearly 3 years ago. We all remember 
President Trump standing next to 
Vladimir Putin and taking the word of 
a Russian intelligence officer over 
America’s intelligence agencies. 
Trump not only defended Putin re-
peatedly from accusations of election 
interference, he actually announced—if 
you believe this, stranger than fic-
tion—that the United States and Rus-
sia would set up a joint cyber security 
unit. Even Senator GRAHAM said that it 
wasn’t ‘‘the dumbest idea [he’d] ever 
heard, but it [was] . . . close.’’ 
Now, President Biden must take the 
exact opposite approach. The United 
States must approach Vladimir Putin 
with a firm hand and demand account-
ability in a way that President Trump 
never did. I expect President Biden will 
do exactly that. 
One issue I am particularly con-
cerned about is cyber security and the 
rise of ransomware attacks on the crit-
ical 
infrastructure 
of 
the 
United 
States. Many of those cyber criminals, 
unsurprisingly, may be hiding out in 
Putin’s Russia or potentially con-
nected to Putin’s intelligence agencies. 
Here at home, I have called on Con-
gress to significantly boost funding for 
our cyber fighting Agencies and asked 
our Senate committees to study if we 
need new legislation to help counter 
the threat of cyber attacks. 
Abroad, President Biden has an op-
portunity to pressure Putin directly to 
put an end to Russian-supported cyber 
crime. I expect he will. The President 
has smartly made these issues a pri-
ority among our NATO allies, announc-
ing a host of joint actions to combat 
cyber crime, harden our cyber security, 
and condemn Russian aggression in the 
cyber space. It is time to take the issue 
directly to Vladimir Putin himself. 
For 4 years, former President Trump 
berated our allies while emboldening 
and sometimes embracing the world’s 
dictators 
and 
autocrats, 
Vladimir 
Putin above all. Already, President 
Biden’s first foreign trip is a welcome 
turn of the page in America’s relation-
ship with the world. 
f 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, fi-
nally, on one final matter, QAnon, last 
December, I joined with Senator HEIN-
RICH and other Democrats to ask the 
FBI and DHS to provide a written as-
sessment on the dangers posed by the 
online conspiracy group QAnon. 
They recently responded to our re-
quest with a very sobering assessment. 
The threat of QAnon is likely to per-
sist, and the current environment will 
likely continue to spur QAnon adher-
ents to see violence as a legitimate 
course of action. The assessment also 
expresses that QAnon adherents and 
domestic violent extremists will likely 
shift from acting digitally to engaging 
in real world violence. That is a shot 
across our bow. That is a warning sig-
nal. 
QAnon today is perhaps best known 
for the role it played in inspiring many 
of the rioters who assaulted the U.S. 
Capitol on January 6. According to the 
FBI’s assessment, they arrested 20 self- 
identified adherents who participated 
in the insurrection. But even before the 
horrific events on January 6, QAnon 
supporters spread disinformation that 
amplified hatred and violence and 
threatened 
our 
democratic 
institu-
tions. 
The past 4 years have seen a notable 
increase in violent domestic terrorism, 
fed by a host of lies and conspiracies 
that flourished under the Trump era. 
This assessment by the FBI is a stark 
reminder that we have a lot of work to 
do to tamp down conspiracy theories 
and disinformation as well as moni-
toring and thwarting violent domestic 
extremists. 
And to my Republican Senate col-
leagues, I would add that this report 
further strengthens the argument for 
an independent January 6 Commission. 
I yield the floor.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 1 
week ago today, the personal financial 
information 
of 
several 
prominent 
Americans was made public in only the 
latest leak of sensitive data from the 
Internal Revenue Service. To put it an-
other way, it appears that an anony-
mous source committed a felony by re-
leasing the confidential information of 
American citizens, which a media out-
let then published. Now, the way this 
leak has been covered in the press may 
not suggest it, but the most alarming 
part isn’t whose information was in-
volved; it is how it was allowed to hap-
pen at all—at all. 
The American people know that hav-
ing the personal information they give 
to the IRS made public isn’t just a fear 
reserved for the highest earners. On 
multiple occasions in the last decade, 
individuals and organizations alike 
have had to watch as their filing de-
tails wander far from the IRS’s data-
bases. And it goes beyond pay stubs. 
The IRS holds massive storage of sen-
sitive details, from healthcare ex-
penses, to retirement savings, to chari-
table contributions. They hold address-
es, information about dependents, and 
associations with organizations that 
may not be tax-deductible. 
Needless to say, there are good argu-
ments for paring back the scope of 
what information this Agency is al-
lowed to collect in the first place. But 
here is the bottom line: American tax-
payers are required by law to comply 
with invasive disclosure requirements, 
and they are doing it with less and less 
confidence that the Federal Govern-
ment will honor their trust. 
A fundamental piece of our Nation’s 
social contract is fraying, but just how 
worried you should be about it appar-
ently depends on your personal poli-
tics. The precise circumstances of this 
latest leak have not yet been made 
clear, but the recent history of IRS 
negligence and outright political tar-
geting tells conservatives to be espe-
cially worried. 
As our colleagues remember all too 
well, years ago, the State of Califor-
nia’s database of private donor data for 
over 1,000 nonprofit organizations was 
made public illegally. A few years 
later, confidential IRS donor informa-
tion from a conservative organization’s 
tax filings was published. To no one’s 
surprise, that information made its 
way into the hands of liberal groups 
with opposite views on key issues. Of 
course, we are talking about the same 
IRS that made slow-walking requests 
and filings from conservative organiza-
tions a matter of internal policy under 
the last Democratic administration. 
So these situations all have two 
things in common: first, a blatant po-
litical agenda aimed at advancing the 
cause of the political left, and second, 
the utter absence of criminal charges 
against 
the 
leakers—no 
charges 
against the leakers. 
So let’s be clear. As soon as sensitive 
personal information is leaked, the 
damage is already done. The genie 
can’t be put back in the bottle, and the 
Federal Government has proven far too 
often that it is at best, incapable and 
at worse, unwilling to protect tax-
payers’ data from misuse by the polit-
ical left. That is why I have been out-
spoken in support of efforts to reduce 
taxpayers’ exposure to unnecessary 
IRS collection in the first place. 
But every time a leak goes without 
serious 
investigation 
and 
criminal 
prosecution, basic public trust in our 
tax system suffers, and that fraying 
trust may eventually be irreparable. 
That is why I joined Ranking Member 
GRASSLEY and Ranking Member CRAPO 
to demand that the Department of Jus-
tice and the FBI immediately inves-
tigate last week’s leak and aggres-
sively pursue criminal charges against 
those who are responsible—actual con-
sequences as a matter of justice and as 
a practical deterrent. The Federal Gov-
ernment owes taxpayers nothing less. 
Unfortunately, thus far, the Biden 
administration hasn’t just neglected to 
aggressively prosecute overt discrimi-
nation; in some cases, it is actually 
trying to promote it. 
Take the massive spending package 
Democrats rammed through in the 
name of COVID relief. The spending 
bill was billed as urgent, but its au-
thors apparently had time to bake in a 
provision directing relief funds to res-
taurants on the basis of race and sex

and another directing funds to farmers 
on the basis of race. So we are talking 
about blatantly unconstitutional dis-
crimination. 
Fortunately, the independent judici-
ary has stepped in to stop it. Over the 
last few weeks, multiple Federal courts 
have struck down these provisions, in-
cluding an appeals panel led by Judge 
Amul Thapar from my home State of 
Kentucky. But these are hardly the 
only instances in which Washington 
Democrats have tried to impose their 
own radical preferences on ordinary 
Americans. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
later today, the Senate will vote on the 
nomination of Kiran Ahuja, President 
Biden’s choice to serve as head of the 
Office of Personnel Management. This 
is the position responsible for making 
hiring, payroll, and training decisions 
that affect literally millions of Federal 
employees. 
The President’s nominee has made 
statements expressing sympathy for 
the 
discredited, 
ahistorical 
claims 
about our Nation’s origins that form 
the backbone of so-called critical race 
theory. One major organization of Fed-
eral employees expressed its concern 
about the nominee’s capacity for ‘‘neu-
trality, fairness, and impartiality.’’ I 
share those concerns, and I will be vot-
ing against this nomination. 
Still elsewhere in the Biden adminis-
tration, efforts to subvert the basic un-
derstanding of our founding principles 
are already well underway. The Depart-
ment of Education’s latest ‘‘proposed 
priorities’’ run roughshod over existing 
history 
and 
civic 
programs—estab-
lished 
with 
bipartisan 
support—in 
order to push critical race theory on 
public school students and keep pace 
with ‘‘woke’’ sensibilities. 
American students deserve a rock- 
solid civics education grounded in ac-
tual facts, not divisive propaganda that 
tells them they are little more than a 
product of their racial background. 
That is the basis of new legislation I 
was proud to help introduce this week. 
Schools that choose to trade in fact- 
based curricula for activist propaganda 
like the 1619 Project forfeit their right 
to receive Federal education grant 
funding for those teachings. 
The current administration came to 
power on the promise to unify a divided 
nation. It will be judged closely and 
carefully on how that power is used.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, unfortu-
nately, predictions about the negative 
economic effects of the so-called Amer-
ican Rescue Plan seem to be coming 
true. 
In March, Democrats pushed through 
this massive partisan spending bill. 
They claimed it was urgently needed 
COVID funding. In reality, the bill was 
filled with unnecessary spending, from 
a staggering $350 billion slush fund for 
States, a majority of which didn’t need 
any more government money to weath-
er the rest of the pandemic, to almost 
$129 billion for schools, even though 
schools had spent just a tiny fraction 
of the tens of billions of dollars Con-
gress had already given them. 
At the time, Republicans warned 
about the bill’s level of spending. More 
than just one liberal economist warned 
about the size of Democrats’ spending 
plan, with former Obama adviser Larry 
Summers noting that the bill could 
‘‘set off inflationary pressures of a kind 
we have not seen in a generation.’’ 
Well, it turns out he was right to be 
worried. Last week, the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics released its report on 
May’s consumer prices, and the news 
was not good. Inflation reached its 
highest level in nearly 13 years, with 
consumer prices up 5 percent from a 
year ago. Core inflation, a measure of 
inflation that excludes food and energy 
prices, soared to its highest level in 
nearly three decades. 
And what does that mean? Well, 
higher prices for Americans. The price 
of everything from bikes to bacon has 
shot up. Auto insurance costs 17 per-
cent more than it did a year ago. Used 
cars cost 30 percent more. Shoes and 
whole milk cost 7 percent more. Infla-
tion is starting to look like it could be-
come nontransitory, or what most 
Americans call a serious problem. 
And Democrats’ government spend-
ing spree is contributing, but, of 
course, that is not causing Democrats 
to hit pause on the economic over-
stimulation. Democrats are looking at 
more trillion-plus-dollar spending bills. 
The President just released a budget 
proposing to hike government spending 
by trillions of dollars over the next 10 
years. Under the President’s plan, the 
Federal budget would be $6 trillion for 
fiscal year 2022, rising to $8.2 trillion 
for fiscal year 2031. Now, to put those 
numbers in perspective, the entire Fed-
eral budget for 2019 came to $4.4 tril-
lion. The President is proposing to 
nearly double that by 2031. 
It is disturbing that the overspending 
in the American Rescue Plan hasn’t 
made Democrats think twice about fu-
ture government sprees, but it is not 
all that surprising because in the 
Democratic Party these days, dogma 
tends to triumph over reality—or prac-
ticality. Democrats are ever more fa-
natically committed to expanding gov-
ernment and taxing Americans, and 
they are not slowed down by little de-
tails like damaging the economy. 
Take the increased unemployment 
benefits situation. Congress provided a 
Federal increase in unemployment ben-
efits early in the pandemic when busi-
nesses were closed and workers had few 
alternatives to keep their families 
afloat, but as early as last fall, there 
were signs that our economy was re-
bounding. And with the arrival of the 
COVID vaccines, it became clear that 
America would be able to get fully 
back to work sooner rather than later. 
But 
Democrats 
insisted 
on 
con-
tinuing the increased unemployment 
benefits until September of 2021, and 
the effect has been predictable. Despite 
record-high job openings, many people 
are declining to return to work because 
they can make more money staying 
home and drawing unemployment ben-
efits. 
Businesses hit hard by the pandemic 
are desperate to return to full oper-
ating capacity, but they are being 
slowed down by the fact that they can’t 
find workers. In response to the worker 
shortage, 
a 
number 
of 
Governors 
around the country decided to stop ac-
cepting the Federal increase in unem-
ployment benefits. They wanted to 
help businesses in their States and get 
their residents back to work. 
And how did Democrats respond to 
that? Well, more than one Democrat 
responded by suggesting that the Fed-
eral Government step in to make sure 
these 
payments 
continue. 
That 
is 
right. Despite evidence that the in-
creased unemployment benefits were 
discouraging workers from going back 
to work, some Democrats wanted to 
prevent Governors from halting these 
payments. 
Nowhere is Democrats’ devotion to 
dogma over reality more notable than 
in their proposed capital gains tax 
hike. Now, I don’t need to tell anyone 
that ‘‘tax the rich’’ has become the ral-
lying cry of the Democratic Party. And 
one of the ways that the President 
plans to tax well-off Americans is by 
doubling the top capital gains rate to 
almost 40 percent. 
The problem is that a 40-percent cap-
ital gains rate substantially exceeds 
the revenue-maximizing rate. In non-
accountant speak, what that means is 
that Democrats could collect more

June 15, 2021 
government revenue if they raised the 
capital gains tax less. Let me repeat 
that. Democrats could collect more 
government revenue if they raised the 
capital gains tax less. 
Now, you would think that the Presi-
dent would want to maximize the rev-
enue the government could collect, es-
pecially with his plans for 10 years of 
massive government spending, which I 
alluded to earlier. But in today’s 
Democratic Party, taxing the rich is 
more important than maximizing gov-
ernment revenue, just like tax hikes on 
corporations are more important than 
making sure our economy grows and 
that American companies can compete 
on the global stage—or raising taxes is 
more important than passing legisla-
tion to boost American infrastructure. 
That is right. The President would 
have reached an agreement with Re-
publicans on a substantial infrastruc-
ture bill, but he tanked negotiations 
because he was insistent that any bill 
repeal parts of the 2017 tax reform leg-
islation, the same legislation that had 
driven up wages and boosted our econ-
omy before the pandemic hit. 
Democrats are so committed to tax-
ation that they included a provision in 
the bloated COVID legislation that 
they passed specifically prohibiting 
State governments from using COVID 
relief money to cut taxes. Apparently, 
Democrats are fine with government 
payments to Americans, but allowing 
them to keep more of their own money 
is off the table. 
Democrats have long been interested 
in higher taxes to pay for more govern-
ment spending, but to today’s Demo-
crats, taxation is rapidly becoming a 
good in itself. Democrats are no longer 
just interested in raising taxes to raise 
revenue. If they were, they wouldn’t be 
planning to jack up the capital gains 
tax rate to over 40 percent. They are 
interested in raising taxes because 
they believe that success should be 
punished. 
In the increasingly socialist Demo-
cratic Party, it doesn’t matter how 
hard you work to get where you are, 
how many people you have created jobs 
for, or how much good you are doing 
with your money; if you have been suc-
cessful, you should be heavily taxed for 
your efforts, even if those heavy taxes 
actually cost the government money or 
hamstring the American economy. 
The growing commitment in the 
Democratic Party to an increasingly 
rigid, socialist dogma is deeply dis-
turbing, and it is certainly not limited 
to a fanatical commitment to taxation 
or spending. It embraces everything 
from a social agenda that is increas-
ingly hostile to freedom of religion and 
freedom of speech to a fundamental be-
lief that government knows best when 
it comes to how Americans run their 
lives. 
But, for today, I am just going to 
limit myself to taxes and spending. 
Let’s hope that Democrats rethink 
their planned government spending 
sprees before inflation really gets out 
of control and hard-working Americans 
end up paying the price.

The majority leader. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. We have two of our 
Members who couldn’t be here because 
of serious illnesses in their families, 
and therefore we are going to delay the 
vote on Kiran Ahuja. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
cloture motion with respect to the 
nomination of Kiran Ahuja to be Direc-
tor of the Office of Personnel Manage-
ment be withdrawn. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. We will return to 
that vote as soon as these Members can 
return.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session for a pe-
riod of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I now 
ask that the Senate recess until 2:15 
p.m. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, the Senate stands in recess 
until 2:15 p.m. 
Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:22 p.m., 
recessed until 2:15 p.m. and reassem-
bled when called to order by the Pre-
siding Officer (Ms. SINEMA).

BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the 
American people are counting on Con-
gress to act on some of the biggest 
issues facing our country. 
For starters, there is a border crisis. 
Since January, more than 630,000 mi-
grants have come to our southern bor-
der, including more than 65,000 unac-
companied children. In May, Customs 
and Border Protection had their busi-
est month in 21 years, with more than 
180,000 encounters in May alone, and we 
are on track to see some of the highest 
numbers in yearly border crossings in 
decades. 
Well, the alarm bells are sounding, 
but amid this crisis, the Senate Judici-
ary Committee held a hearing this 
morning on a partisan bill that has 
nothing to do with the extant border 
crisis. 
Make no mistake, I believe Congress 
should absolutely take action to allow 
current DACA, or Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals, recipients to re-
main in the United States, but a par-
tisan bill that would provide a pathway 
to citizenship for 4.4 million adults and 
other unrelated issues has simply no 
chance of passing in the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4527 
June 15, 2021 
Now, Senator DURBIN, the chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee, who has 
long been an advocate for the Dream-
ers, if he really were serious about that 
issue, he now has the authority, as 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
to put a bill before the committee to 
allow Senators to offer and vote on 
amendments and to mark up a bill. 
And if he were able to get a majority of 
the committee to vote for a bill, he 
could then ask majority Leader SCHU-
MER to put the bill on the floor. But, so 
far, most of our discussions on immi-
gration have been just that, all talk 
and no action. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. CORNYN. At the same time, 
Madam President, America’s roads and 
bridges are in dire need of attention by 
Congress. Every year, the American 
Society of Civil Engineers evaluates 
the state of our infrastructure and 
issues a report card to let us know how 
we are doing. Well, America is barely 
passing with a ‘‘C-minus.’’ Texas is 
faring slightly better than the rest of 
the class, with just a ‘‘C.’’ 
I believe Republicans and Democrats 
alike think that rebuilding our roads 
and bridges is important. We even 
share the same goal of expanding the 
definition of ‘‘infrastructure’’ to in-
clude broadband because we saw during 
the current pandemic that broadband 
is no longer a luxury. It is an absolute 
necessity, whether it is for telehealth 
or whether it is for our children learn-
ing remotely or for people working re-
motely from home. 
Even as bipartisan negotiations con-
tinue, though, the majority leader is 
eyeing the prospects of a partisan bill 
that would circumvent the normal leg-
islative process and would be entirely a 
partisan product. But we know that in 
a 50–50 Senate, bipartisan work on 
shared priorities is not impossible. In 
fact, we did it just last week. 
Last week, we saw a great example of 
what can be accomplished if we will 
work together to achieve an outcome. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in 
recent years, China has emerged as one 
of the greatest competitors to Amer-
ica. Both Republicans and Democrats 
recognize the need to take action now 
to confront the growing threats posed 
by China, and so that is what we did 
last week. 
Last week, the Senate passed a 
sweeping bipartisan bill to invest in 
strategic competition with China, in 
large part by funding the CHIPS for 
America Program to shore up this vul-
nerable supply chain of advanced semi-
conductors 
coming 
primarily 
from 
Asia, primarily from Taiwan. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. CORNYN. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, there is a lot of work that we can 
and should do on a bipartisan basis be-
cause, of course, not every issue should 
be or is a partisan issue. But I will 
have to tell you that old habits die 
hard around here. 
Despite the clear need for coopera-
tion 
to 
move 
critical 
legislation 
through a 50–50 Senate, the majority 
leader is resisting any progress on 
issues that we can and should be ad-
dressing. Instead, he is trying to drum 
up a scenario where somehow we decide 
to eliminate the 60-vote requirement, 
otherwise known as the filibuster. But 
it is that 60-vote requirement that re-
quires both parties to roll up their 
sleeves and do the hard work and build 
consensus. 
In a country of 330 million people, we 
need to have the continuity and the 
planning and the stability of bipartisan 
work products, not just a partisan bill 
that can be undone after the next elec-
tion for Congress or after the next 
Presidential election. 
Well, over several months, our Demo-
cratic colleagues have been asked 
about the fate of the filibuster, wheth-
er they would be willing to eliminate 
the filibuster in pursuit of partisan 
goals. Senator SCHUMER, for one, has 
repeatedly said that ‘‘all options are on 
the table’’—whatever that means—and 
a number of our Democratic colleagues 
have parroted the same line. 
Now, they have looked for examples 
of Republicans filibustering bills, just 
like they have done over the last 6 
years. They assumed this would be the 
golden ticket to rid themselves of the 
bipartisan filibuster requirement and 
escape blame, only things haven’t quite 
worked out that way. The roadblock to 
bipartisanship isn’t on the Republican 
side but, rather, on the Democrat side. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
after passing five bipartisan COVID–19 
relief bills last year to support the 
American people through the pan-
demic, 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
kicked off this year with a different ap-
proach. They made no attempt to try 
to negotiate another consensus pack-
age, as we had done five times before 
last year, and insisted on skirting the 
normal legislative process so they 
could pass a purely partisan $1.9 tril-
lion spending bill. 
Well, the problem with that is it was 
really mislabeled. One, it vastly over-
shot the target, and it spent less than 
10 percent of the money—which, pur-
portedly, was for COVID–19 relief—on 
COVID–19, and less than 1 percent of 
that was related to vaccines, which was 
clearly the most urgent need. 
But the money that we had appro-
priated last December hadn’t even been 
spent yet, but, apparently, the Biden 
administration wanted to demonstrate 
that it could get things through but, in 
the meantime, appropriated $1.9 tril-
lion, threatening us with something we 
haven’t seen rear its head in a long 
time, which is inflation. 
But the bill, as I said, included a lot 
of unrelated and unnecessary partisan 
priorities, ranging from blank checks 
for mismanaged union pension funds, 
funding for climate justice, backdoor 
money for Planned Parenthood, and an 
exclusive paid leave program for Fed-
eral bureaucrats. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
where did that land us? Well, as I said, 
last week, the Department of Labor an-
nounced that inflation had climbed to 
the highest rate since 2008. Core infla-
tion surged to the highest level in 
nearly three decades. Families are feel-
ing the pinch of higher prices as they 
pay higher prices for everything from 
housing to cars to gasoline to gro-
ceries. 
This is really sort of a silent and hid-
den tax on their income, when the dol-
lar that they earn is worth less and less 
as prices go higher and higher. But, un-
fortunately, this is the exact scenario 
economists expected when our Demo-
cratic colleagues rolled out this $2 tril-
lion spending bill at the beginning of 
the year. And they are currently pro-
posing to spend trillions of dollars 
more. 
Even Larry Summers, who once 
served as Treasury Secretary under 
Bill Clinton and Director of the Na-
tional Economic Council under Presi-
dent Obama, warned about inflation. 
He penned an op-ed in the Washington 
Post in February, cautioning the ad-
ministration about the risks of infla-
tion, making himself persona non grata 
among our Democratic colleagues. But 
he wrote another one last month say-
ing that ‘‘the inflation risk is real.’’ 
You might think that would serve as 
a cautionary tale to our Democratic 
colleagues, that partisan legislation 
does not give way to sound and stable 
policies. But that is not the case. 
When the majority leader said all op-
tions are on the table for eliminating 
the filibuster, he didn’t mention the 
fact that he would be setting the table 
and setting the agenda trying to make 
that case. 
Absent Republican obstruction that 
he and other members of the media 
forecasted, the majority leader is now 
teeing up a series of designed-to-fail 
votes so he could explain or justify— 
try 
to 
justify—why 
the 
filibuster 
should be eliminated. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we 
kicked things off last week with a vote 
on a bill that would exploit the cause 
of pay fairness, when that is already 
clearly the existing law, but, in this 
case, to line the pockets of trial law-
yers. 
Senator SCHUMER said this month, 
the Senate will vote on S. 1, the par-
tisan Federal election takeover bill. So 
just as our Democratic colleagues went 
on a spending spree in the name of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4528 
June 15, 2021 
COVID–19, this bill hijacks the con-
stitutional authority of the States in 
the purported name of increasing vot-
ing access. But this bill, too, is chock 
full of unnecessary, unpopular, and un-
constitutional election proposals. 
It makes it much easier for partisans 
to affect our elections through fraud, 
in part, by removing requirements for 
the most basic safeguard, which is 
voter identification. 
That was one of the main rec-
ommendations in 2005 of the Commis-
sion on Federal Election Reform, a bi-
partisan 
commission 
cochaired 
by 
former President Jimmy Carter, a 
Democrat, and former Secretary of 
State, James Baker, a Republican. 
That Commission, back in 2005, rec-
ommended that voters be required to 
present a photo ID card and the State 
should provide free cards to voters 
who, for some reason, didn’t have a 
driver’s license or other identification. 
In order to vote in person, most 
States require voters to present some 
valid form of identification. Matching 
the name of an eligible voter with the 
name on a valid form of ID is a com-
monsense safeguard against fraud, but 
one our Democratic colleagues appar-
ently want to eliminate. 
In fact, their legislation would stop 
the States—actually it would prohibit 
the States—from requiring proof of 
identification in order to vote. Just 
sign a piece of paper saying you are 
who you say you are and no further 
questions can be asked. 
On top of that, this bill would require 
the States to automatically register 
anyone in their databases for every-
thing from the department of motor 
vehicles to public assistance. We know 
these programs aren’t limited to eligi-
ble voters and could include nonciti-
zens and others who aren’t eligible to 
cast a ballot, not to mention the fact 
that those who are already registered 
to vote would be registered again, po-
tentially. 
And even if there are duplicate reg-
istrations or if someone passes away or 
moves, States would not be allowed, by 
this law, to clean up their voter rolls 
within 6 months of an election. 
But just when you think things can’t 
get any crazier, they do. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues want to provide tax-
payer funding for political campaigns 
and elections. That is right. They want 
you to pay for a political candidate’s 
campaign, whether you want to or not, 
whether you support the policies of 
that candidate or not. 
A lot of companies have matching 
programs for charitable giving. If an 
employee donates to the charity of 
their choice, the company often will 
match the donation dollar for dollar. 
Well, that same principle applies here, 
in part, except instead of the charity 
getting money, it is now a political 
candidate. Instead of the company 
footing the bill, it is—you got it—it is 
you, the taxpayer. 
I could go on and on. This proposal, 
S. 1, which we will be voting on in the 
near future, changes the basic struc-
ture of the Federal Election Commis-
sion, which is currently a bipartisan 
Commission, which is forced to obtain 
a bipartisan majority before they can 
act. It split 3 to 3. But this bill would 
eliminate that bipartisan requirement 
and simply allow a partisan Federal 
election committee to work its will. 
This bill also legalizes something 
called ballot harvesting, which is sus-
ceptible to widespread fraud. In other 
words, it lets a campaign worker go 
around to nursing homes, neighbor-
hoods, union halls, wherever, and col-
lect your ballot and then to take them 
down to the clerk’s office and cast that 
ballot. Well, the opportunities for fraud 
are pretty obvious. 
This bill would also implement a new 
financial disclosure policy that even 
the American Civil Liberties Union 
says ‘‘could interfere directly with the 
ability of many to engage in political 
speech about causes that they care 
about.’’ 
But above all this, this bill under-
mines the trust and accountability 
that is so important to elections. The 
Judiciary Committee recently had a 
hearing where the secretary of state, 
who happens to be a Democrat, from 
New Hampshire said the single most 
important thing in providing a big 
turnout for elections is public con-
fidence that their ballot will be count-
ed. It is not how many days before elec-
tion day you can vote, who can vote by 
mail; it is the public’s confidence that 
their ballot will be counted, no matter 
how and when cast. 
So S. 1 is not a serious attempt at bi-
partisanship. It is the opposite. It is 
not an honest effort to pass legislation. 
Right now, we know that Democrats 
don’t even have 50 votes on their side 
of the aisle. But the majority leader is 
trying to prove that partisanship ap-
parently has a death grip on the Sen-
ate, but, unfortunately for him, it is 
not the party he thinks. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
INVESTIGATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
Friday, the New York Times reported 
that during the Trump administration, 
the Justice Department issued sub-
poenas involving Members of Congress, 
their staff, and family members, even a 
minor family member. It is highly un-
usual for the Justice Department to in-
vestigate Members of Congress. The 
reason it is unusual is clear: Our 
Founders 
created 
three 
separate 
branches of the Federal Government 
with a separation of powers so that 
each branch could serve as a check and 
balance on the other and no branch 
would have too much power. 
When the Justice Department inves-
tigates a Member of Congress, typi-
cally, it is for corruption charges. That 
is understandable, but that is not what 
happened here. This was an investiga-
tion into a leak of information. And 
the use of subpoenas to investigate 
Members of Congress is extremely 
strange territory. 
These concerns are heightened when 
the President has publicly attacked 
those same Members of Congress. That 
is what former President Trump did 
when he repeatedly and without any 
evidence accused Representative ADAM 
SCHIFF
about 
leaking 
information 
about Russian election interference. 
These reports and the reports that 
journalists and even Trump’s own 
White House Counsel were included in 
the 
Justice 
Department’s 
so-called 
leak investigation raise serious ques-
tions about the Justice Department 
and its former leaders. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee has 
a constitutional responsibility to over-
see the Department of Justice on be-
half of the American people, so yester-
day our committee sent a letter to At-
torney General Merrick Garland asking 
for more information. But yesterday 
Senator MCCONNELL, the Republican 
minority leader in the Senate, came to 
the floor and warned us off. He warned 
the Judiciary Committee against exer-
cising our statutory oversight respon-
sibility because it could become ‘‘a 
partisan circus.’’ This came on the 
heels of Senator MCCONNELL’s personal 
veto of a bipartisan Commission to in-
vestigate the deadly January 6 mob at-
tack on the U.S. Capitol. But now the 
minority leader is warning us against 
even looking into the targeting of 
Trump’s perceived political enemies by 
the Justice Department. The minority 
leader claimed that the Senate does 
not need to look into this matter be-
cause—get this—the Department of 
Justice inspector general has already 
announced he would investigate. That 
is a pretty decent argument if you have 
no memory whatsoever. 
For over 13 months during the last 
Congress, under a Republican majority, 
the Senate Judiciary Committee con-
ducted an extensive oversight inves-
tigation into the FBI’s opening of the 
Crossfire Hurricane investigation even 
though the Department of Justice in-
spector general had already inves-
tigated it. The Department of Justice 
inspector general had already com-
pleted a 19-month investigation of so- 
called Crossfire Hurricane involving 
over 100 witnesses and reviewing over a 
million documents. 
That wasn’t good enough for the Re-
publican majority. They persisted in 
conducting a committee investigation 
nevertheless even though the inspector 
general’s investigation concluded that 
Crossfire Hurricane had a proper basis

June 15, 2021 
and that anti-Trump bias did not affect 
the FBI’s work on Crossfire Hurricane. 
Those are the very issues the Repub-
lican majority reexamined in their own 
investigation. In that instance, the De-
partment of Justice inspector general 
satisfied all the criteria of an inspec-
tion, an investigation, and yet the Re-
publicans rejected it and proceeded for-
ward. 
In this case, the Republican leader in 
the Senate is arguing that the work of 
the 
inspector 
general 
should 
be 
enough—quite a difference. 
Throughout the course of that inves-
tigation, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee held extensive hearings, but it 
wasn’t enough. 
The Republican-led Senate Judiciary 
Committee was so focused on inves-
tigating a conspiracy theory about 
Obama that they didn’t hold a single 
hearing on the Trump administration’s 
Department of Justice in 4 years. If 
they had, maybe they would have dis-
covered this latest revelation rather 
than the New York Times. 
Senator MCCONNELL did not warn the 
Judiciary Committee that the DOJ in-
spector general’s investigation was suf-
ficient or that its investigation into 
Crossfire Hurricane would become a 
partisan circus. He saw it completely 
differently in those days. 
Importantly, it seems the minority 
leader does not speak for his entire 
caucus. Yesterday the minority whip 
said: ‘‘Obviously this warrants further 
review and investigation,’’ and he 
‘‘assume[s] the committee will work 
through that.’’ I hope that other Re-
publican Members of the Chamber join 
the minority whip to call for further 
investigation. Congress’s place in our 
constitutional order is too important 
to simply look the other way. 
f 
DACA 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it 
was 9 years ago today, after a year or 
more of writing letters to my friend 
and colleague President Obama, that 
he finally agreed to an Executive order 
known as DACA. DACA took the heart 
of the DREAM Act, which I introduced 
20 years ago, and made an Executive 
order. He said to those who were 
brought to this country as children, in-
fants, who really had nothing to do 
with the family decision on coming to 
America: We are going to give you a 
chance, since you grew up undocu-
mented, to be a part of this Nation. So 
every 2 years, you can apply for renew-
able status, be protected from deporta-
tion, and be allowed to legally work. 
We will do a criminal investigation, 
national security investigation, and if 
we believe that you are no threat to 
this country, we will give you 2 years 
to prove yourself. 
More 
than 
800,000 
young 
people 
stepped forward and made a life in 
America and did extraordinary things 
for this country. They proved that, 
given a chance to be part of America’s 
future, they would make it a better na-
tion. Two of them testified today. One 
of them is a doctor from the city of 
Chicago. I am so proud of him, Dr. 
Bernal Mejia. He was born in Mexico 
and grew up in Memphis, TN. He strug-
gled, scrapped, clawed his way into an 
amazing 
undergraduate 
institution, 
graduated 
summa 
cum 
laude, 
and 
hoped that one day he would have a 
chance to go to medical school. 
Before DACA, that was a dream that 
was way too distant. Then came DACA. 
He looked around to see if any medical 
schools in the United States would let 
someone who was protected by DACA 
apply for medical school. It turned out 
there was one. I am proud to say it was 
Loyola University in Chicago, the 
Stritch 
School 
of 
Medicine. 
They 
didn’t create a new category of stu-
dents; they just said: We will let you 
compete. If you are good enough, we 
will admit you as a student. 
Over 30 DACA students became med-
ical students at Loyola. Dr. Mejia was 
one. He is now about to finish, in a few 
weeks, the third year of his residency 
in emergency medicine. He has spent 
the last year and a half, as you can 
imagine, in emergency rooms saving 
the lives of so many people, particu-
larly victims of COVID–19. 
How many times has each of us 
thanked the healthcare heroes, and 
how many times have we thought that 
one of them might have been an un-
documented doctor whose future and 
fate are still so uncertain in America? 
That is the case today because the 
DREAM Act has not become the law of 
the land. 
So we had a hearing and discussed his 
situation and the bill that was sent to 
us by the House. I believe there is some 
bipartisan sentiment in favor of that, 
and I am trying to work to develop 
that into legislation that will finally 
give to Dr. Mejia and so many others 
across this country the future in Amer-
ica which they have all prayed for. 
They have worked hard to earn it. 
They deserve it. 
I am glad, at this hearing today, the 
doctor came and told this story. It is 
an inspiration to me and all who be-
lieve in this country that we should 
have justice when it comes to immigra-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the

f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise for the ninth time to once 
again call for this entire body to have 
the opportunity to consider and to cast 
their votes for the Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act. 
This commonsense reform would en-
sure that people in the military who 
have been subjected to sexual assault 
and other serious crimes get the justice 
they deserve. 
I have been calling for a full floor 
vote on this bill since May 24. That was 
22 days ago. Since then, an estimated 
1,232 servicemembers will have been 
raped or sexually assaulted. 
Two in three of those survivors will 
not even report it because they know 
they are more likely to face retaliation 
than to receive justice. 
Tonight, I want to share the story of 
just one of these countless survivors of 
sexual assault in our military who 
bravely shared her story with me. 
A husband and a wife both served in 
the Marine Corps when the wife was as-
saulted by another marine. Her com-
mander concluded that she deserved ill 
treatment for wearing running shorts 
and makeup. Her husband said that 
when he read the opinions of the com-
mand-appointed investigator, he found 
that he compared rape to prostitution 
or marrying a rich man. The wife said 
of the retaliation after she reported the 
assault that ‘‘[t]he humiliation of the 
retaliation was worse than the assault 
because it was sanctioned from those 
same leaders I once would have risked 
my life for.’’ 
I ask my colleagues—I ask my col-
leagues to imagine living through the 
worst day of your life and knowing 
that nothing would happen to your as-
sailant. Imagine knowing that there 
was a bill that could change this sys-
tem that failed you, knowing that Sen-
ators from both sides of the aisle have 
come together to advocate for it, 
knowing that if it were allowed to be 
voted on, it would pass. 
Now imagine the vote getting denied 
night after night after night, watching 
the government that you volunteered 
to serve and defend continue to fail 
you. 
We have to do better. We can start by 
bringing this legislation to the floor. 
I ask unanimous consent that at a 
time to be determined by the majority 
leader in consultation with the Repub-
lican leader, the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours for debate, equal-
ly divided in the usual form, and that 
upon the use or yielding back of that 
time, the Senate vote on the bill with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, reserv-
ing my right to object, the legislation 
that the Senator from New York pro-
poses, particularly with respect to the 
issue of crimes involving sexual mis-
conduct, is something that I support. 
But without a thorough, careful review 
in the Armed Services Committee, 
which is the traditional means of mak-
ing these decisions, particularly when

they affect the entire Uniform Code of 
Military Justice, is something that is 
necessary, in my view, and will be 
done—and I hope promptly—so that we 
can move forward with this legislation, 
not only to ensure that it passes but 
that it works for the benefit of the sol-
diers, sailors, marines, and airmen in 
our Armed Forces. 
Passing something that sounds good 
but has not been thoroughly reviewed 
and thoroughly vetted and will not be 
implemented effectively for the benefit 
of soldiers, sailors, marines, and air-
men is something I don’t think we 
should do. 
I think, rather, we should wait for 
the committee hearings. I am con-
fident that this legislation, with re-
spect to crimes involving sexual mis-
conduct, will emerge from the com-
mittee. There are other issues that we 
will consider. 
With that, I would reaffirm my objec-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I respect the chairman and his 
need to carefully review this legisla-
tion, but we have been reviewing the 
legislation for 8 years, and we have 
been having hearings on this legisla-
tion and the issue of sexual assault in 
the military for 8 years. 
We have been passing legislation 
through the committee for 8 years, but 
this vote has been denied every time. 
In fact, when don’t ask, don’t tell re-
peal was being filibustered by the 
Armed Services Committee chairman 
and other Members of that committee, 
we ultimately took that vote to the 
Senate floor. It was an up-or-down vote 
to repeal don’t ask, don’t tell. 
In this case, the committee has been 
considering this thoroughly and care-
fully for 8 years. And even if the chair-
man believes that he hasn’t fully vet-
ted it or reviewed it or had the careful 
consideration, many of the Members of 
the committee have. We have been dili-
gently looking at this issue for 8 
straight years. It is time to bring this 
to the floor. 
I am confident that if we bring this 
to the floor, we will be able to reform 
how we deal with these cases; we will 
be able to change the system for the 
better; and that we will be able to fi-
nally begin to overcome the scourge of 
sexual violence in the military. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
UNWAVERING SUPPORT FOR OUR 
COAST GUARD ACT 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
rise today in strong support of our U.S. 
Coast Guard. 
For more than 230 years, the U.S. 
Coast Guard has watched over our 
shores, 
protected 
against 
foreign 
threats, lent a helping hand to those in 
need of rescue, and enforced the rule of 
law. 
The Coast Guard lives by its motto, 
‘‘Always Ready,’’ and has earned the 
trust and admiration of the American 
people. America could not do without 
this uniquely capable branch of our 
military. 
The Coast Guard is so effective and 
so versatile that it is tasked with 11 
statutory missions spanning the entire 
globe. 
One of the best known Coast Guard 
missions is search and rescue. The 
Coast Guard carries out 45 search and 
rescue missions on an average day, sav-
ing the lives and property of Americans 
in dire need. 
The Coast Guard also protects our 
ports and inland waterways, facili-
tating billions of dollars in trade and 
maintaining the navigation aids that 
make sea commerce possible. In to-
day’s global economy, 80 percent of 
international trade travels by sea. The 
Coast Guard plays a crucial role in 
screening commercial vessels, patrol-
ling maritime infrastructure, and serv-
icing aids to navigation, such as bea-
cons and buoys. Each of these func-
tions contributes to our Nation’s pros-
perity and security. 
The Coast Guard is also increasingly 
involved in homeland security. It is 
largely the Coast Guard’s job to deter 
potential threats before they arrive in 
U.S. ports. Coast Guard men and 
women can be found in every major 
port in America, conducting security 
boardings and escorting passenger and 
cargo vessels into our waterways. The 
Coast Guard also helps to enforce U.S. 
migration laws and saves the lives of 
those who foolishly risk everything to 
travel on unseaworthy vessels. 
Beyond this, the Coast Guard plays a 
crucial role in blocking narcotics and 
illegal weapons from entering our 
country. It is not uncommon for Amer-
icans to open their news feeds and read 
a report about the latest multimillion- 
dollar drug bust carried out at sea by 
the Coast Guard. In one recent exam-
ple, three Coast Guard cutters joined 
efforts to intercept more than 11,000 
pounds of cocaine valued at $220 mil-
lion. That was a remarkable feat, but 
not unusual for the U.S. Coast Guard. 
As the polar regions attract more in-
terest from Congress, it should be 
known that the Coast Guard is Amer-
ica’s surface presence in both the Arc-
tic and the Antarctic waters. Coast 
Guard icebreakers carry out a wide 
range of operations, allowing us to 
have a sustained presence in Antarc-
tica and conduct research in some of 
the most remote corners of the Earth. 
If all of these roles were not enough, 
the Coast Guard is taking on greater 
responsibilities in national security. 
Partnering side-by-side with the Navy, 
today’s Coast Guard conducts freedom 
of navigation operations in the South 
China Sea, provides maritime security 
in the Middle East, and deters illegal 
fishing in international waters. 
This long list of responsibilities 
should make two things very clear: 
First, the Coast Guard is indeed capa-
ble and adept; and, secondly, it is being 
stretched increasingly thin. Today, the 
Coast Guard is being asked to carry 
out almost every maritime task imag-
inable, but Coast Guard funding has 
not kept up with these increased de-
mands. The fifth branch of our military 
needs the certainty, predictable fund-
ing, and authorities necessary to ac-
complish all of its missions. 
Congress has the ability to meet 
these needs, and I am asking my col-
leagues to do so by supporting a new 
bill, the Unwavering Support for Our 
Coast 
Guard 
Act. 
This 
legislation 
would essentially do five things. 
No. 1, it would protect pay and allow-
ances for Coast Guard members during 
the government shutdown. During the 
latest government shutdown, the Coast 
Guard members went without pay yet 
continued to serve admirably. This 
should not be allowed to happen again. 
We need to safeguard Coast Guard pay 
and allowances from failures here in 
Washington. 
No. 2, the legislation would provide 
full funding to eliminate the shore-side 
facility maintenance backlog while 
building resilience into these facilities. 
No. 3, the bill would enhance the di-
versity of the Coast Guard. 
No. 4, it would support needed ren-
ovations at the Coast Guard Yard in 
Maryland. 
And, No. 5, the bill would require the 
Coast Guard to tell us the assets and 
facilities it needs to complete all of its 
missions. 
For too long, the Coast Guard has 
been asked to do more with less. Con-
gress needs to understand the true cost 
of modernizing and recapitalizing our 
Coast Guard fleet to meet its mission 
requirements in the increasingly com-
plex maritime domain. 
I am proud of my State’s role in sup-
porting the Coast Guard’s fleet recapi-
talization efforts. Mississippi is build-
ing two of the vessels that will be the 
vanguard of our Coast Guard for years 
to come: the National Security Cutter 
and the cutting-edge Polar Security 
Cutter. 
The National Security Cutters have 
already proven themselves to be the 
most capable and versatile ships the 
Coast Guard has ever used. They can 
deploy all around the world and inte-
grate seamlessly with our NATO allies, 
and use next-generation technologies, 
like unmanned drones, to extend their 
reach. These cutters are especially ef-
fective at countering drug smuggling, 
illegal fishing, and illegal movement of 
migrants. 
America will also benefit signifi-
cantly from the new Polar Security 
Cutters, which will be the first heavy 
icebreakers built in America since the 
1970s. Our current fleet of icebreakers 
is aging and shrinking. We have fallen

far behind Russia in our icebreaker 
fleet, and the Arctic is quickly becom-
ing a critical national security domain. 
A fleet of new Polar Security Cutters 
will allow us to maintain a heavy pres-
ence in polar regions and keep our ad-
versaries at bay. 
America needs a capable and growing 
Coast Guard, and the Coast Guard 
needs the support of this legislation. I 
look forward to working with my col-
leagues to provide the Coast Guard 
with the resources it needs to continue 
its exemplary service to our Nation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
JUNETEENTH 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to recognize the 156th anniver-
sary of Juneteenth. On Saturday, we 
mark 156 years since June 19, 1865, 
when MG Gordon Granger announced 
in Galveston, TX, that the Civil War 
was over and that enslaved people were 
now free. 
In 
his 
announcement, 
General 
Granger said: 
The people of Texas are informed that, in 
accordance with a proclamation from the 
Executive of the United States, all slaves are 
free. This involves an absolute equality of 
personal rights and rights of property. 
In commemoration of this momen-
tous day, June 19 became known as 
Juneteenth. In the years following the 
Civil War and in the early 20th cen-
tury, Juneteenth has been celebrated 
as a holiday of independence. 
While Juneteenth has been cele-
brated in States across the country, it 
carries a special significance in Texas, 
where Juneteenth celebrations began. 
In 1872, four men in Houston, my home-
town, purchased the land for Emanci-
pation Park, the oldest park in Texas, 
as the site for Juneteenth celebrations. 
In 1980, the State of Texas became the 
first State to make Juneteenth a State 
holiday. Today, 47 States recognize 
Juneteenth. 
I am proud to cosponsor the Senate 
resolution designating June 19, 2021, as 
Juneteenth Independence Day to honor 
the historical significance this day has 
in the United States. 
Juneteenth is an important day. It is 
a somber reminder of the original sin 
of slavery that our Nation inherited 
from colonial powers. Still, it is also a 
celebration of the fact that our coun-
try strives each and every day to make 
good on its promise to protect the in-
alienable right to life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness for all men and all 
women, who are created equal. Our 
country was founded on that revolu-
tionary idea, that revolutionary belief 
that all men are created equal, and 
that means no matter where we come 
from or what we started with, any one 
of us can live freely and achieve great 
things. 
The story of America and the story 
of Juneteenth is a story of freedom, 
and while we have had many troubled 
chapters along the way, I, for one, 
agree with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
that the arc of history is long and that 
it bends towards justice, and we have 
made significant progress on that arc. 
On Saturday, as we commemorate 
the 
long-overdue 
announcement 
of 
emancipation made in Texas 156 years 
ago, let us together remember the God- 
given freedoms we all cherish as Amer-
icans. 
f 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, on Sun-
day, June 20, Joe Biden will have been 
President for exactly 5 months. In 
these 5 months, we have seen crisis 
after crisis after crisis. We have experi-
enced a gas crisis, where we had gas 
lines and skyrocketing energy prices. 
We are on the verge of an inflation cri-
sis, where everywhere we look, prices 
are rising on food, on housing, and on 
lumber. We have already had a war in 
the Middle East, and we have a border 
crisis that has been raging so intensely 
that we are on pace to see 2 million il-
legal immigrants come through our un-
secured border this year. 
Just last month, 180,034 illegal immi-
grants crossed the border. To put that 
in perspective, that number is a 674- 
percent increase over the number of il-
legal immigrants that crossed the bor-
der last May—a 674-percent increase— 
and that number is a 21-year high. The 
reason for this is simple: The crisis 
that has unfolded is the direct result of 
political decisions made by Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS. 
No. 1, the first week in office, Presi-
dent Biden immediately halted con-
struction of the border wall. 
No. 2, that same week, President 
Biden reinstated the failed catch and 
release policy. 
No. 3, most inexplicably, the Biden 
administration ended the ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ international agreement, a 
historic 
agreement 
negotiated 
by 
President Trump with the Government 
of Mexico whereby the Government of 
Mexico agreed that those who crossed 
illegally into Mexico would remain in 
Mexico while their asylum proceedings 
were pending in the United States. 
That agreement was a tremendous 
success. It produced last year the low-
est rate of illegal immigration in 45 
years. Let me repeat that. Just 6 
months ago, our country had achieved 
the lowest rate of illegal immigration 
in 45 years. Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS come into office, they rip to 
pieces the international agreement 
that produced that success, and today 
we have the highest rate of illegal im-
migration in 20 years. 
Meanwhile, as the crisis rages, Joe 
Biden is nowhere to be found, and 
KAMALA HARRIS is nowhere to be found. 
In 5 months in office, Joe Biden 
couldn’t be bothered to go down to the 
border and see the humanitarian dis-
aster his policies have created. KAMALA 
HARRIS, who was designated ‘‘in charge 
of the border,’’ seems determined to go 
anywhere she can but the border. 
In the 84 days since she has been 
tasked with handling the border crisis, 
do you know how many press con-
ferences she has given? Not even one— 
not a single press conference in 84 days. 
She can’t be honest about what is 
causing the crisis so she hides from 
questions. The one time she sought 
questions was with NBC’s Lester Holt, 
where he asked her about going to the 
border. She responded with that now 
characteristic 
and, 
quite 
honestly, 
creepy laugh, where she said: ‘‘We’ve 
been to the border.’’ I am not sure who 
the royal ‘‘we’’ was, but that ‘‘we’’ 
doesn’t include Joe Biden, who hasn’t 
been to the border as President. That 
‘‘we’’ doesn’t include KAMALA HARRIS, 
who hasn’t been to the border as Vice 
President. 
And Lester Holt—to NBC’s credit, 
Lester Holt actually asked a followup 
question, and it was a very simple 
question: ‘‘You haven’t been to the bor-
der?’’ To which she responded, oddly: 
‘‘Well, I haven’t been to Europe ei-
ther.’’ 
(Mr. VAN HOLLEN assumed the 
Chair.) 
Mr. President, we are not facing a 
humanitarian crisis, a border crisis, a 
public crisis, a national security crisis 
in Europe. We are facing it at our 
southern border. We are facing it in my 
home State of Texas. And the Vice 
President, it seems, cannot be bothered 
to go and see firsthand the failures 
that President Biden’s policies are 
causing. 
I also want to touch on one issue that 
greatly affects border communities, 
and that is our land ports of entry. 
While Joe Biden has repeatedly en-
couraged this crisis of illegal immigra-
tion, he is at the same time preventing 
lawful border crossing. 
Border communities are suffering im-
mensely right now because important 
land ports of entry in El Paso, in Del 
Rio, in Eagle Pass, in Laredo, in Rio 
Grande City, in McAllen, in Pharr, in 
Brownsville remain closed to everyone 
except those deemed ‘‘essential’’ traf-
fic. 
Basically, Mexicans who have a visa 
to enter the United States legally can-
not do so through these land ports of 
entry unless they are going to school, 
working, or somehow considered essen-
tial. Nonessential travel from the 
United States—into the United States 
from Mexico for shopping, for visiting 
family and friends, for casual visits are 
not allowed by the Biden administra-
tion. 
Instead, the Biden administration 
has decided to keep our land ports of 
entries closed for nonessential travel 
until at least June 21, ostensibly be-
cause of the COVID–19 pandemic. This

decision makes no sense, when Ameri-
cans have access now to effective vac-
cines and the Biden administration is 
just fine with allowing hundreds of 
thousands of illegal aliens to stream 
across the border and be released in our 
communities. 
Despite testing positive at a COVID 
positivity rate of 10 percent, the Biden 
administration has no problem with 
that, and they perpetuate the policies 
that continue that disaster. And yet, at 
the same time, they shut down trade 
and legal tourism through our land 
ports of entry. 
For a long time, I have summed up 
my immigration views very simply in 
four words: ‘‘legal, good; illegal, bad.’’ I 
think the overwhelming majority of 
Americans agree with that proposition. 
And yet, as we look at the first 5 
months of the Biden-Harris administra-
tion, it seems for President Biden and 
Vice President Harris, their immigra-
tion policy is legal, bad; illegal, good. 
That makes no sense. It is exactly 
backward. 
We should open up our land ports of 
entry to legal tourism, which would 
greatly benefit the border commu-
nities, especially in my home State of 
Texas. 
And we need to end this heartless, in-
humane policy that is resulting in tens 
of thousands of children being traf-
ficked in by human traffickers, which 
is resulting in thousands of children 
being physically abused and sexually 
abused, being thrown into the Biden 
cages, packed in larger and larger num-
bers. 
Ignoring this problem won’t go away. 
Behaving like an ostrich, Joe Biden 
and KAMALA
HARRIS
cannot plunge 
their heads into the sand and hope the 
disaster at the border will magically 
disappear. They don’t want to go to the 
border because they know the TV cam-
eras will follow them to the border, and 
their only hope is people don’t notice 
the lives that are being destroyed, the 
crime that is coming in, the vandalism 
that is coming in, the public health 
threat that we are seeing. 
This is not compassionate. It is not 
humane. This chaos is wrong, and it is 
time to end. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
f 
2022 OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, 8 short 
months from now, the greatest athletes 
in the world will gather together and 
compete in the 24th Olympic Winter 
Games. 
Usually, Americans await this awe- 
inspiring event with enthusiasm and 
excitement. This year, though, we 
await it with apprehension and, frank-
ly, disgust. That is because next year’s 
games will be held in the People’s Re-
public of China—a Communist nation 
that enslaves workers, puts women and 
children in concentration camps, steri-
lizes women, and unleashed a global 
pandemic that killed millions and up-
ended the global economy. 
The 2022 Games will be located in 
Beijing—a 5-hour train ride away from 
the Wuhan lab where the coronavirus 
pandemic likely originated and a day 
away from Xinjiang Province, where 
the Communist Party is committing 
genocide against ethnic and religious 
minorities and has herded more than 1 
million innocent souls into concentra-
tion camps. 
The Chinese Communist Party may 
believe that extravagant pageantry 
will distract us from the reality of 
what they have done, but no amount of 
rushed urban cleaning can wipe away 
the moral stain that permeates the 
capital city of China. No golden torch 
can redeem the moral bankruptcy of 
communism. No fireworks display can 
make us forget that Beijing is the epi-
center of evil in the world. It is no ex-
aggeration to state that the Chinese 
Communist Party is the purist, most 
powerful, and most pervasive force for 
evil in the world. 
Locating the Games in Beijing will 
enrich and embolden the Chinese Com-
munist Party and strengthen their 
hold on their captive people. That is 
why the International Olympic Com-
mittee 
should 
immediately—imme-
diately—rebid the 2022 Games and 
award it to a free democratic nation. I 
will note that this is entirely feasible. 
If the Tokyo Summer Games can be 
postponed a year due to an event that 
was no fault of Japan’s Government, 
we can certainly rebid the Winter 
Games on short notice if China is per-
petrating crimes against humanity. 
I would observe that the Winter 
Games are far smaller and easier to 
move than the Summer Games. The 
Winter Games include fewer than half 
the number of sports, nearly 4,700 fewer 
medals, only one-quarter the number of 
events, and less than half the com-
peting country. 
There are many, many Western de-
mocracies that could easily, easily ac-
commodate a relocation of the Games 
on short notice. Some of our European 
partners, 
like 
France, 
Switzerland, 
Sweden, and Italy have more than 
enough winter sporting venues and 
hotel capacity and transportation ca-
pacity to host these Games with 8 
months’ notice. Many of them have 
hosted modern Games before. Many of 
them host national and international 
winter sporting competitions. 
If the IOC fails to rebid the games, 
however, the United States should 
fully embrace an economic and diplo-
matic boycott. No U.S. official, com-
pany, or spectator should participate 
in and legitimize China’s despotic and 
totalitarian actions. American compa-
nies should not profit off of genocide 
and oppression or help line the pockets 
of the Communist Party officials per-
petrating these crimes against human-
ity, these grotesque atrocities. 
If—and it is a big if—we can keep our 
athletes safe, they should compete in 
the spirit of the great Jesse Owens. 
They should stare tyranny in its eye 
and defeat China in every field of com-
petition. But the only Americans—and 
I 
mean 
the 
only 
Americans—who 
should step foot on Chinese soil are the 
athletes, their coaches, their essential 
support staff, and the necessary per-
sonnel to ensure their safety. 
If the games remain in China, it will 
pose unique challenges to the safety, 
security, and privacy of those limited 
number of Americans who do attend, 
though. The U.S. Government must be 
fully prepared for the dangers to which 
these athletes and supporting per-
sonnel would be exposed. 
First, the Chinese Government oper-
ates the most extensive, sophisticated, 
and invasive police state anywhere on 
Earth. Members of the American dele-
gation should expect the Chinese au-
thorities to bug their hotel rooms, 
their vehicles, and to hack all of their 
electronic devices. 
Second, China has an ignominious 
history of arbitrarily detaining Amer-
ican citizens and other Western visi-
tors to gain political and economic 
concessions, placing exit bans on for-
eign nationals. Members of the Amer-
ican delegation could be detained dur-
ing their visit. 
Former Assistant Secretary of State 
David Stilwell apparently shares these 
concerns, stating that ‘‘spectators have 
good reason to beware Xi Jinping’s Bei-
jing Winter Olympics.’’ 
And I would add especially those, 
like, say, the Houston Rockets’ general 
manager, Daryl Morey, who have spo-
ken out against the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s abuses in Hong Kong, 
Tibet, 
Xinjiang, 
and 
many 
other 
places. 
Third, the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s infringement of privacy knows no 
limits, and our Nation’s representa-
tives should prepare our athletes and 
their staff accordingly. 
China even considers DNA collection 
as a vital intelligence-gathering objec-
tive, wants to use DNA data to cata-
pult Chinese biotech companies to 
global market dominance, and has re-
portedly conducted research on bio-
logically enhancing its soldiers. 
During the Olympics, of course, the 
DNA of thousands of world-class ath-
letes could prove an irresistible target 
to Communists in Beijing, whose evil 
sometimes seems to verge on science 
fiction. So whether through the ruse of 
COVID testing or testing for perform-
ance-enhancing drugs, China will have 
the opportunity to steal the very DNA 
of our elite athletes—young men and 
women, in many cases young boys and 
girls, who deserve our protection. 
For all of these reasons, and many 
more, President Biden should force-
fully call on the International Olympic 
Committee to rebid the 2022 Winter

Beijing and asking if the Communist 
authorities are cooperating with U.S. 
efforts to protect our athletes. 
If the safety, security, and privacy of 
our athletes cannot be guaranteed, the 
United States should, and indeed must, 
adopt a total and complete boycott of 
the Beijing Winter Olympics. 
No American should be put in harm’s 
way for the sake of a sporting event. 
President Biden ought to make these 
terms absolutely clear to Communists 
in Beijing, and we should not com-
promise on them. 
The athletes we send to the Olympics 
are not Democrats or Republicans. 
They do not wear donkeys or elephants 
on their uniform. They have no party 
insignia. They are Americans, wearing 
the Stars and Stripes, bearing the 
standard of our great Nation. It is the 
responsibility of our government to 
protect these champions, and I hope 
this is an area in which our divided 
government can unite. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, the 
Democrats want to call their voting 
bill the For the People Act, but I would 
suggest you not be fooled by the mar-
keting. This bill has nothing to offer 
the people of our country. The so- 
called For the People Act is, in fact, a 
partisan takeover of our elections that 
seeks a government of the Democrats, 
by the Democrats, and for the Demo-
crats. So it is no wonder that it is their 
very top priority and it is literally the 
first bill filed in both the House and 
the Senate this year. 
If this bill passes, it will shatter our 
Nation’s faith in the fairness of our de-
mocracy, weaken the security of our 
elections, and attempt to entrench 
Democratic rule in the swamp, unchal-
lenged, for decades to come. 
S. 1 is a Federal takeover of our elec-
tions that would usurp the constitu-
tional prerogative of the States in de-
termining what the Constitution calls 
the ‘‘Times, Places, and Manners of 
holding elections.’’ While our Constitu-
tion has always given Congress the 
power to determine certain aspects of 
how 
elections 
are 
conducted, 
the 
Founders envisioned that this power 
would be exercised, in the words of 
Alexander Hamilton, only under ‘‘ex-
traordinary circumstances’’ and only 
as ‘‘the last resort.’’ For example, Con-
gress could intervene if States were 
simply refusing to hold Federal elec-
tions in an attempt to deprive Congress 
of the Members needed to operate 
under the quorum rules of the Con-
stitution. Of course, we face no such 
extraordinary circumstances today. 
No matter the outrageous claims of 
hysterical journalists and politicians, 
almost every story you hear and every 
Democratic claim you hear about State 
election 
law 
reforms 
misrepresents 
those reforms or doesn’t put them in 
proper context. 
The 
Democratic 
Party—the 
very 
head of the Democratic Party, Presi-
dent Joe Biden, referred to Georgia’s 
election reform, for instance, as a ‘‘new 
Jim Crow,’’ even though it has far, far 
more access to the ballot than Demo-
cratic-run States like New York and, 
yes, Joe Biden’s own Delaware. 
I might also note that Kentucky 
passed a fairly sweeping election re-
form bill earlier this year. It still 
doesn’t go as far as Georgia’s bill did in 
providing early access to the ballot. 
Yet there is no condemnation of Ken-
tucky’s bill. I wonder why. Could it be 
because Kentucky has a Democratic 
Governor? 
The Democrats want to use these 
kinds of misrepresentations to pass S. 
1, which would give all power over our 
Nation’s elections to Democrats in 
Congress, who think anyone should be 
able to vote, at any time, at any place, 
and in any manner, with remarkably 
little concern even for the basics of 
election integrity, such as establishing 
the identity and the legality of individ-
uals who are casting the ballots. 
The bill before the Senate would in-
validate voter identification laws in 
States across the country—laws that 
simply require individuals to present 
valid photo identification in order to 
vote. Now, Democrats like to pretend 
that voter ID laws are racist, just as 
they like to pretend that anyone who 
opposes them is also racist. That would 
be a surprise to most of the American 
people, though. According to recent 
polling, three-quarters of Americans 
support photo ID requirements, includ-
ing 70 percent of Black voters, who sup-
port photo ID requirements. That is a 
pretty big claim of false consciousness 
by the Democrats. 
After all, it is no great burden to 
present a driver’s license or photo iden-
tification at the polling place in order 
to vote. It is not some devious tactic to 
suppress any group of voters. If it was, 
maybe we would need to ask some of 
these politically correct airlines, like 
Delta, why they require passengers to 
present 
photo 
identification 
before 
boarding flights. Are they engaged in 
some nefarious, racist practice of trav-
eler suppression? I don’t think so. 
I think voter ID laws are a basic 
means of securing the vote, just like 
three-quarters of all Americans think. 
Yet S. 1 would still eliminate them all, 
allowing anyone to register to vote, 
under any identity, without presenting 
proof that they are who they claim to 
be. 
The Democrats’ bill would also make 
permanent many of the vote-by-mail 
expansions that were rushed through as 
ill-considered emergency measures dur-
ing the pandemic last year. The free- 
for-all of ballot harvesting and mail-in 
voting during the 2020 elections caused 
many Americans to doubt the integrity 
of that vote. 
Removing guardrails against fraud 
will only convince more voters that the 
electoral process is rigged. Responsible 
elected officials should be trying to as-
suage voters’ fears by implementing 
adequate safeguards on our elections. 
After all, many of these practices were 
unheard of before the 2020 election. 
Now, the Democrats like to say that 
they have to pass S. 1 in a response to 
these State election reforms, but I 
would point out that this bill was in-
troduced in the House 2 years ago, be-
fore the States passed any of the elec-
tion reforms. Oftentimes these State 
election reforms are being passed by 
legislatures that were appalled by their 
Governor’s sweeping power grabs. So 
no matter what the conditions, the 
Democrats think it is always time to 
nationalize our elections. 
Another provision of the Democrats’ 
election bill would repeal donor pri-
vacy laws that keep the IRS from 
harassing 
nonprofit 
organizations 
about the identities and addresses of 
their donors. Democrats claim that 
this change is about dark-money mega 
donors, but it would apply to any mid-
dle-class family who donates a few hun-
dred dollars a year to a cause they care 
about, like a church or a charity. Yet, 
if the Democrats have their way, bu-
reaucrats at the IRS would be able to 
force nonprofits to name their donors 
or risk losing their tax-exempt status. 
This should alarm anyone familiar 
with the IRS’s track record of unfairly 
targeting conservative groups. After 
all, just last week, we saw a conven-
iently timed leak of legally protected 
tax returns that came out right before 
the Senate Finance Committee had a 
meeting to justify higher taxes. What a 
coincidence. 
Now, these are just a few of the pro-
posals in the Democrats’ election bill. I 
haven’t even talked about the public 
funding of campaigns. I haven’t men-
tioned transforming the Federal Elec-
tion Commission into a partisan weap-
on to be used by the President’s party 
against the opposition. All of these 
provisions and many more encourage 
fraud, harassment, and corruption in 
our campaigns and elections. Not coin-
cidentally, they all seem to work to 
the advantage of the Democrats or at 
least to the Democrats’ perceived self- 
advantage. It is little surprise, then, 
that this partisan bill is supported only 
by Democrats—not even all Democrats, 
for that matter, not all the Democrats 
here in the Senate and not all the 
Democrats in the House, which passed 
it earlier this year by the thinnest of 
margins. 
So I am proud to be a part of the bi-
partisan majority in the Senate that is 
opposing the Democratic Party’s at-
tempted takeover of our States’ elec-
tion 
processes. 
Political 
office 
in 
America is not a birthright of any 
party or any politician, so the Demo-
crats should try winning their elec-
tions fair and square instead of taking 
them over in a centralizing power play. 
I yield the floor.

June 15, 2021 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nominations en 
bloc: Calendar Nos. 151, 152, 153, and 
154; that those nominations be con-
firmed en bloc; that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate; that no further motions 
be in order to any of the nominations; 
and that the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action and the 
Senate then resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Tennessee is recog-
nized. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
reserve the right to object, and I rise to 
object to this unanimous consent re-
quest. 
The VA, for years, has made promises 
that they have year after year failed to 
meet. For years, veterans and their 
family members have called my office, 
whether I was in the State senate or 
over in the House or here in the Sen-
ate. They are distressed by the lack of 
service they receive from the VA. My 
caseworkers would work tirelessly with 
these constituents, only to end up frus-
trated by a very unresponsive VA. This 
is unacceptable. It has become the cul-
ture of the VA, and this is something 
that has to change. 
Now, for weeks, the committee has 
been asking for feedback on legislative 
proposals which have the potential to 
affect the workflow and the capacity of 
the VA. The VA has been silent on this 
even though we have asked for their 
views and have asked them to weigh in. 
The reason we have asked them for this 
is the VA has a backlog of over 180,000 
cases. Their wait times this year have 
continued to escalate. They are not 
going down. 
So, yesterday, I had a call with Sec-
retary McDonough expressing my con-
cerns with the lack of feedback that 
the committee has received on what is 
shaping up to be the most consequen-
tial legislative effort in the veterans 
space in an entire generation. The for-
mal response that I received today was 
incomplete, but it contained a promise 
that they would have more fulsome 
feedback by July 30. 
I will continue to keep my hold on 
these pending VA nominees until I re-
ceive the official views on the COST of 
War Act, on the toxic exposures bills. 
We owe our veterans. We owe it to 
them to get this right. Therefore, I ob-
ject to the unanimous consent request, 
and I will continue my hold on these 
nominees. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Montana is recog-
nized. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
CALENDAR NO. 153 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I will 
rephrase this one more time. 
I would ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to executive session 
to consider the following nomination: 
Calendar No. 153—for those who want 
to know, that is Matthew T. Quinn of 
Montana; that the nomination be con-
firmed and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to any other nomination; and 
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action and the 
Senate resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana is recognized. 
Mr. TESTER. Last month, four well- 
qualified, noncontroversial nominees 
were unanimously voted out of the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee—unani-
mously voted out of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee, which Senator BLACK-
BURN sits on. Here is who these people 
are: 
Don Remy, a veteran, has been nomi-
nated as VA Deputy Secretary—VA 
Deputy Secretary. That is second in 
command. If Senator BLACKBURN wants 
quick reaction from the VA on toxic 
exposure, maybe Senator BLACKBURN 
shouldn’t hold that nominee of the No. 
2 position of the Department, a nomi-
nee specifically tasked with coordi-
nating VA’s work with the Defense De-
partment, which includes issues like— 
guess what—toxic exposure. But that is 
all right. We will leave him sitting at 
home. We will leave the veterans out in 
the cold. 
Then there is Patricia Ross, who is 
nominated to be Assistant Secretary 
for Congressional Affairs. So if Senator 
BLACKBURN
wants more information 
from the VA on legislation and how 
much it costs, maybe the Senator 
shouldn’t hold the nominee tasked 
with getting that information from the 
VA to Congress, but she is. 
Then, there is Maryanne Donaghy, 
nominated as Assistant Secretary for 
Accountability and Whistleblower Pro-
tection. I want to tell you that whistle-
blowers regularly come to us with re-
ports of waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Folks love to condemn the VA—we 
heard a lot about it a second ago— 
when it fails to hold its workforce ac-
countable. I recommend that, if Sen-
ator BLACKBURN wants to request ac-
countability at the VA, maybe the Sen-
ator shouldn’t hold the nominee tasked 
with 
employee 
accountability 
and 
whistleblower protection. 
Then, there is Matt Quinn—someone 
that I know very, very well because he 
comes from the State of Montana—for 
director of cemetery affairs. So when 
people die, no one is there in the VA to 
take care of this issue. 
Once again, all four people—criti-
cally important people—whom the Sen-
ator voted for to get out of committee 
are now being held by the Senator. 
I am going to tell you that, if we 
want to hold the VA accountable today 
in a situation where we are coming out 
of a pandemic, this is not the way to do 
it. The bottom line is that if you want 
a VA that can function, then, we have 
to have that VA staffed up. 
Don’t talk to me or anybody else in 
this body about distressed veterans and 
then say: You know what. We are going 
to stop the No. 2. We are going to stop 
the VA person who is supposed to talk 
to us. We are going to stop the ceme-
tery person. We will stop the whistle-
blower person. That is really helping 
veterans. 
Quite frankly, it is just the contrary. 
I pride myself on running a com-
mittee that is very bipartisan, and the 
VA Committee may be the best, not be-
cause of me but because of people like 
JERRY MORAN, JOHN BOOZMAN, people 
like PATTY MURRAY. Those people step 
up to the plate every day, and they do 
what is right for veterans. 
Let’s talk about the toxic exposure 
bill. Let’s talk about that bill. In 
World War I, we had mustard gas. The 
VA had no capacity to deal with those 
veterans. In World War II, we had radi-
ation. The VA had no capacity. In the 
Vietnam war, we had Agent Orange. 
And, by the way, they died, they died, 
and they died again because this body 
refuses to give the VA the tools they 
need to take care of our veterans, and 
now we are doing the same thing with 
burn pits. 
I am here to tell you that I had a vet-
eran stand up in my very first year on 
the VA Committee. A Vietnam veteran 
stood up in the back of the room in a 
townhall and said: You are not going to 
treat this generation of veterans like 
you treated ours, the Vietnam vet-
erans. 
Well, I tell you what: If we want to 
close the door and we want to delay 
and we want to push back what is 
going on with burn pits, then, let’s 
have them die. 
You were at the hearing that the 
lung transplant guy was at. We had to 
juggle that hearing so he could even be 
at it because he was on medication. 
The bottom line is people are dying 
every day. 
By the way, we are still not done 
with Agent Orange, hypertension, and 
MGUS, which are in this bill. They will 
die. Some more of them will die. 
We send our young people off to war. 
They come back changed, and we don’t 
have the guts to step up and debate the 
bill. When I give the ranking member 
the authority to stop that bill from 
coming to the floor, we are still going 
to make excuses? Give me a break. 
I am going to tell you what. I have 
been in this body for probably too long. 
We turn around and we try to do the 
right things, and we have people who 
say: You know, send our young people 
off to war at the drop of the hat. Send 
them off to war. Send them off to war.

And then they come back, and they 
are changed, and we say we are not 
going to take care of them because we 
need information right now, this very 
minute, when it is not even on the 
floor. We need the information—when I 
have already made a commitment to 
the ranking member that we are going 
to have this information. But, no, what 
we are going to do is we are going to 
stop the VA from having a slate of can-
didates so they can do their jobs and 
service the veterans. 
Guess what. I am not a veteran. This 
doesn’t impact me, but it impacts the 
veterans in my State, some 100,000 of 
them—1 in 10 Montanans—and, in fact, 
veterans all across this country. 
We can sit here and we can play these 
games of holding up nominees to fill 
critical Agency departments, and we 
can play them and play them and play 
them again, and we can say we are 
doing it on behalf of the veterans. That 
is bull—you got it—total bull. 
We have a job to do here, folks. If we 
don’t want to confirm well-qualified 
folks, then, why don’t we just shut 
down the VA? Why don’t we tell 
McDonough that he is out of luck, that 
we are not going to send him any help? 
And then we start making demands. 
The bottom line is this, folks: All the 
things Senator BLACKBURN
is con-
cerned about, I made a commitment 
with the ranking member that we are 
going to get those questions answered, 
and we will get them answered with 
good information. And then if the 
ranking member consents, we will have 
a vote and we will have debate, and we 
will make a determination whether 
this is the right thing to do. 
But just to say, ‘‘No, we are stopping 
everything right now; no more toxic 
exposure bill until I get this informa-
tion because we are not going to send 
you the staff to do your job,’’ doesn’t 
make a lot of sense to me. It doesn’t 
make a lot of sense to me. And in the 
process our veterans suffer. That vet-
eran who has hypertension dies—one 
less problem for the VA, because we 
created the problem right here today. 
I would ask Senator BLACKBURN to 
reconsider her hold so we can get the 
VA the staff they need so they can do 
their job. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
you know, it is truly an honor to work 
with the veterans in Tennessee, and we 
have hundreds of thousands of veterans 
in our State. 
I know that the chairman says he 
prides himself in working with the vet-
erans. I will tell you, quite frankly, I 
consider it a humbling experience to 
work with these veterans. Whether 
they are from World War II or Korea or 
Vietnam or whether they are from any 
of our recent wars—the Mideast— 
whether we are dealing with Agent Or-
ange or burn pits, to me it is heart- 
wrenching to hear their stories. 
And the VA has not done their job. 
So what we are doing is standing up for 
these veterans and saying to the VA: 
Get your act together. Provide this in-
formation. How do you deal with this 
backlog? Do you have the capability to 
deal with what we are discussing? Do 
you have that capability? What is your 
capacity? How do we best handle these 
issues? 
The VA, for years—decades, decades, 
decades—has not done their job in a 
timely manner, in a responsive manner 
to our Nation’s veterans. Therefore, 
let’s say: Let’s get this right. Let’s get 
it right. 
Excuse me. There is a fly in this 
Chamber. 
Let’s get it right now. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
last week’s conversations about our 
own government’s role in the COVID 
coverup reflected over a year of refusal 
on the part of my Democratic col-
leagues 
to 
accept 
that 
the 
novel 
coronavirus may not have spread via 
natural transmission from a Chinese 
wildlife wet market. 
As the theories of the pandemic’s ori-
gins evolved, one remained, until very 
recently, off limits. This is, of course, 
the lab leak hypothesis, or the theory 
that the virus somehow escaped from a 
lab in Wuhan, China. 
Now, this theory didn’t come out of 
nowhere. In early January 2020, alarm 
bells were already ringing at the CDC, 
the State Department, and in the sci-
entific community over problems with 
the natural origin theory of trans-
mission. 
Virologists and other public health 
officials studying the disease were 
quickly coming to the conclusion that 
the way the virus was spreading sug-
gested that this theory was flawed. Of-
ficials also knew that the Wuhan Insti-
tute of Virology was conducting con-
troversial and dangerous ‘‘gain of func-
tion’’ research with the help of repack-
aged U.S. Government grants. 
Yes, that is correct. 
In April of last year, I joined many of 
my colleagues in publicly demanding a 
thorough investigation into the lab 
leak theory. What followed was noth-
ing less than moral panic. Activists, 
journalists, and even our own Demo-
cratic colleagues accused us of racism, 
xenophobia, and science denial. 
Major media organizations refused to 
report on the hypothesis, except to 
decry it as a racist attack on Chinese 
scientists. Facebook banned accounts 
that posted about it. YouTube deleted 
videos that dared contradict the World 
Health Organization. 
Rather than scaring us off, though, 
these attacks left us with another 
question to answer: Why did the very 
idea of investigating the Wuhan lab in-
spire such a bizarre panic? Or, perhaps, 
the better question is, Why did NIAID 
Director Dr. Fauci and the rest of the 
powers that be publicly insist that the 
idea of a lab leak was completely pre-
posterous? 
Even NIH Director Francis Collins 
hadn’t ruled it out. In a March 2020 
interview with the Atlantic, he said 
that while natural transmission was 
the likely culprit, ‘‘the possibility that 
such a naturally evolved virus might 
have also been under study at the 
Wuhan 
Institute 
of 
Virology 
and 
reached residents of Wuhan—and ulti-
mately the rest of the world—as the re-
sult of a lab accident has never been 
adequately excluded.’’ 
We certainly have evidence to show 
that mistakes happen, even in a profes-
sional lab. Who could forget that back 
in 2015, we saw reports that personnel 
at a military facility in Utah acciden-
tally shipped active samples of anthrax 
to labs in nine States—yes, a 2015 lab 
accident. 
NIH has also had problems keeping 
track of things. According to a memo 
prepared in 2016 by a minority staff of 
the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, a 2009 Department of Health 
and Human Services OIG audit found 
an inventory discrepancy at the NIH 
caused in part by mislabeled envelopes 
containing unregistered vials of plague 
and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 
In 2012, NIH researchers found vials 
of anthrax spores in the wrong place. 
What is worse, the scientists in that 
particular lab weren’t registered to 
possess them. 
In 2014, an FDA researcher working 
at the NIH campus in Bethesda discov-
ered vials of live smallpox virus stuffed 
in a cardboard box in an unsecured cold 
storage room. 
Mistakes were clearly made. Lab ac-
cidents happen. It is also clear that 
while a leak from the Wuhan lab could 
have happened due to human error, 
this coverup we are now learning about 
certainly did not happen by error. 
We now have an emerging picture of 
what did happen behind the scenes to 
create so much resistance to the lab 
leak theory. 
On June 3 of this year, that bastion 
of rightwing insanity known as Vanity 
Fair magazine published an investiga-
tive report exposing the deranged polit-
ical gamesmanship that prompted pub-
lic health officials to paint the lab leak 
theory as a conspiracy. 
The report confirmed just about ev-
erything those officials wanted to keep 
hidden—namely, that the lab leak hy-
pothesis was suppressed at multiple 
levels of government by officials look-
ing to protect their own interests and 
to distance themselves from President 
Donald Trump—so much for following 
the science. They were following emo-
tions. 
The report confirmed conflicts of in-
terest concerning grant awards that 
supported gain-of-function research at 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The 
same people who knew that Chinese 
scientists were performing these dan-
gerous experiments on the taxpayer 
dime also knew from verified intel-
ligence reports that three Wuhan-based 
researchers fell ill with COVID-like 
symptoms in November 2019, well be-
fore the first reported outbreak. Still,

State Department officials warned in-

would ‘‘open a can of worms.’’ 
The internal coverups bled into this 
year until, finally, 5 days before Presi-
dent Biden took the oath of office, the 
State Department put out a fact sheet 
on the Wuhan lab that confirmed the 
November outbreak and revealed that 
scientists working there had collabo-
rated with the Chinese military on 
classified research. The Biden adminis-
tration has yet to walk any of this 
back. 
We are also finally seeing some inter-
est in the World Health Organization’s 
Beijing-controlled investigation into 
the Wuhan lab. On March 1 of this year 
and again on May 24, I laid out my con-
cerns to the White House about the 
WHO’s reliance on the Chinese Com-
munist Party for funding and support. 
I explained how this reliance drove 
their initial support for Beijing’s re-
sponse to the outbreaks and ruined the 
integrity of their investigation. The 
White House has yet to respond to my 
concerns, but it is not going to be able 
to avoid responding because the Amer-
ican people are demanding the answers. 
I think it is important to state for 
the record that what we are seeing in 
these news reports is not entirely new 
information. The foundations of the lab 
leak hypothesis remain much the same 
as they were a year ago. So why pop 
open that can of worms right now? Be-
cause there is no way to sweep this 
thing back under the rug. 
We have the sudden interest of the 
media. Imagine that. We also have an 
entire body of published statements 
and investigative reporting from inside 
China. Facebook and YouTube have re-
versed their content policies, which 
means they couldn’t stop people from 
sharing this information unless they 
pulled the plug on the entire internet 
which, obviously, isn’t an option. 
We also have the magic of FOIA on 
our side. We learned from Dr. Fauci’s 
published emails that he knew about 
the dangerous research happening in 
China. He was aware. We know he al-
lowed inquiries into the Wuhan lab 
leak theory to go unanswered. We also 
know he worked with Mark Zuckerberg 
to determine what COVID-related in-
formation 
flowed 
into 
the 
public 
timeline and when that information 
went out. 
Now, I stand by my criticism of Dr. 
Fauci. His dystopian comments equat-
ing attacks on his job performance 
with attacks on science are unaccept-
able, but I want to encourage everyone 
to not make this about one person. We 
now have evidence that public officials 
were eating each other alive over polit-
ical disagreements and that these dis-
agreements 
derailed 
investigations 
into the origins of COVID–19. 
This is more than just political fail-
ure; it is a moral inversion that em-
powered one of the globe’s most violent 
authoritarian governments. The Chi-
nese officials who hid the existence of 
the 
novel 
coronavirus 
from 
inter-
national bodies are the very same Chi-
nese officials who gunned down free-
dom fighters in Hong Kong, who un-
leashed political violence in Inner 
Mongolia and Tibet, and who continue 
to commit ongoing genocide against 
Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. 
It is time for Congress to get serious 
about cleaning up this mess. I reiterate 
the same demands I made more than a 
year ago for a full and unbiased inquiry 
into the lab leak hypothesis and a 
broader investigation into the origins 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Last week, I joined Senator COTTON 
in reintroducing the Li Wenliang Glob-
al Public Health Accountability Act. 
This legislation would authorize the 
President to sanction foreign officials 
who suppress or distort information 
about international public health cri-
ses, including COVID–19. I encourage 
my colleagues to sign on to the bill. 
Most importantly, I would implore 
my Democratic colleagues to engage in 
a little introspection. The officials im-
plicated in this coverup swept science 
under the rug, orchestrated a relentless 
smear campaign, throttled the flow of 
public information, and allowed the 
Chinese Communist Party to exonerate 
itself at the expense of truth and ac-
countability. 
You don’t have to defend this. Please, 
have the moral courage to make the 
right choice, and join us in our de-
mands for unbiased investigations into 
the origin of the pandemic. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the 
referenced fact sheet and letters. The

FACT SHEET ACTIVITY AT THE WUHAN INSTI-
TUTE
OF
VIROLOGY—UNITED
STATES
DE-
PARTMENT OF STATE 
Fact Sheet 
January 15, 2021 
For more than a year, the Chinese Com-
munist Party (CCP) has systematically pre-
vented a transparent and thorough inves-
tigation of the COVID–19 pandemic’s origin, 
choosing instead to devote enormous re-
sources to deceit and disinformation. Nearly 
two million people have died. Their families 
deserve to know the truth. Only through 
transparency can we learn what caused this 
pandemic and how to prevent the next one. 
The U.S. government does not know ex-
actly where, when, or how the COVID–19 
virus-known as SARS—CoV-2—was trans-
mitted initially to humans. We have not de-
termined 
whether 
the 
outbreak 
began 
through contact with infected animals or 
was the result of an accident at a laboratory 
in Wuhan, China. 
The virus could have emerged naturally 
from human contact with infected animals, 
spreading in a pattern consistent with a nat-
ural epidemic. Alternatively, a laboratory 
accident could resemble a natural outbreak 
if the initial exposure included only a few in-
dividuals and was compounded by asymp-
tomatic infection. Scientists in China have 
researched 
animal-derived 
coronaviruses 
under conditions that increased the risk for 
accidental and potentially unwitting expo-
sure. 
The CCP’s deadly obsession with secrecy 
and control comes at the expense of public 
health in China and around the world. The 
previously undisclosed information in this 
fact sheet, combined with open-source re-
porting, highlights three elements about 
COVID–19’s origin that deserve greater scru-
tiny: 
1. ILLNESSES INSIDE THE WUHAN INSTITUTE OF 
VIROLOGY (WIV) 
The U.S. government has reason to believe 
that several researchers inside the WIV be-
came sick in autumn 2019, before the first 
identified case of the outbreak, with symp-
toms consistent with both COVID–19 and 
common seasonal illnesses. This raises ques-
tions about the credibility of WIV senior re-
searcher Shi Zhengli’s public claim that 
there was ‘‘zero infection’’ among the WIV’s 
staff and students of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS- 
related viruses. 
Accidental infections in labs have caused 
several previous virus outbreaks in China 
and elsewhere, including a 2004 SARS out-
break in Beijing that infected nine people, 
killing one. 
The CCP has prevented independent jour-
nalists, investigators, and global health au-
thorities from interviewing researchers at 
the WIV, including those who were ill in the 
fall of 2019. Any credible inquiry into the ori-
gin of the virus must include interviews with 
these researchers and a full accounting of 
their previously unreported illness. 
2. RESEARCH AT THE WIV 
Starting in at least 2016—and with no indi-
cation of a stop prior to the COVID–19 out-
break—WIV researchers conducted experi-
ments involving RaTG13, the bat coronavirus 
identified by the WIV in January 2020 as its 
closest sample to SARS-CoV-2 (96.2% simi-
lar). The WIV became a focal point for inter-
national coronavirus research after the 2003 
SARS outbreak and has since studied ani-
mals including mice, bats, and pangolins. 
The WIV has a published record of con-
ducting ‘‘gain-of-function’’ research to engi-
neer chimeric viruses. But the WIV has not 
been transparent or consistent about its 
record of studying viruses most similar to 
the COVID–19 virus, including ‘‘RaTG13,’’ 
which it sampled from a cave in Yunnan 
Province in 2013 after several miners died of 
SARS-like illness. 
WHO investigators must have access to the 
records of the WIV’s work on bat and other 
coronaviruses before the COVID–19 outbreak. 
As part of a thorough inquiry, they must 
have a full accounting of why the WIV al-
tered and then removed online records of its 
work with RaTG13 and other viruses. 
3. SECRET MILITARY ACTIVITY AT THE WIV 
Secrecy and non-disclosure are standard 
practice for Beijing. For many years the 
United States has publicly raised concerns 
about China’s past biological weapons work, 
which Beijing has neither documented nor 
demonstrably eliminated, despite its clear 
obligations under the Biological Weapons 
Convention. 
Despite the WIV presenting itself as a ci-
vilian institution, the United States has de-
termined that the WIV has collaborated on 
publications and secret projects with China’s 
military. The WIV has engaged in classified 
research, including laboratory animal ex-
periments, on behalf of the Chinese military 
since at least 2017.

funded or collaborated on civilian research

at the WIV have a right and obligation to de-
termine whether any of our research funding 
was diverted to secret Chinese military 
projects at the WIV. 
Today’s revelations just scratch the sur-
face of what is still hidden about COVID–19’s 
origin in China. Any credible investigation 
into the origin of COVID–19 demands com-
plete, transparent access to the research labs 
in Wuhan, including their facilities, samples, 
personnel, and records. 
As the world continues to battle this pan-
demic—and as WHO investigators begin their 
work, after more than a year of delays—the 
virus’s origin remains uncertain. The United 
States will continue to do everything it can 
to support a credible and thorough investiga-
tion, including by continuing to demand 
transparency on the part of Chinese authori-
ties. 
MARCH 1, 2021. 
Hon. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., 
President of the United States, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN: The COVID–19 pan-
demic has taken a significant toll on Amer-
ican life as well as the U.S. economy. Test 
kits, antibody therapies, and vaccine devel-
opment have occurred in record time due to 
Operation Warp Speed and the ingenuity of 
the private sector. However, the investiga-
tion into the origins of the pandemic are not 
complete. Without this knowledge, it will be 
difficult to prevent a future, similar pan-
demic. I urge you to use your leadership to 
ensure investigations by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) are free from conflicts 
of interest. 
Concerns have been raised about the lack 
of transparency of the events that took place 
at the time the outbreak started in Wuhan, 
China. In addition, concerns have been raised 
regarding the manner in which World Health 
Organization investigators were chosen to 
study the outbreak and some of the conflicts 
of interest that exist in those investigators. 
Following the 2014 breakdown of security 
measures that resulted in cross contamina-
tion with a dangerous bird flu strain and the 
accidental mailing of live anthrax spores 
from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 
to other labs, Tom Frieden, the director of 
the CDC under president Obama testified 
‘‘We also need to encourage a culture of 
openness and effective reporting of past or 
future incidents—since a key aspect of effec-
tive response is to support rapid reporting of 
problems.’’ 
On February 13, 2021, National Security 
Advisor Jake Sullivan said, ‘‘We have deep 
concerns about the way in which the early 
findings of the COVID–19 investigation were 
communicated and questions about the proc-
ess used to reach them. It is imperative that 
this report be independent, with expert find-
ings free from intervention or alteration by 
the Chinese government.’’ 
Transparency is an issue upon which we 
can agree. In light of that, I respectfully re-
quest you use your leadership to ensure the 
ongoing investigation of the COVID–19 pan-
demic origin be free from conflict of interest. 
WHO should be required to have independent 
investigators to conduct this study. WHO 
should not include researchers with conflicts 
of interest or with a lack of experience in fo-
rensic investigation. We owe this to the over 
500,000 Americans who have died from this 
disease, to their families, and to future 
Americans who face possible pandemics. 
Sincerely, 
MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
U.S. Senator. 
MAY 24, 2021. 
Hon. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., 
President of the United States, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN: I write to follow- 
up on my March 1, 2021 letter with lingering 
concerns about the validity of the World 
Health Organization’s (WHO) investigation 
into the origin of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Prior reports appear to confirm that the 
WHO had ‘‘little power to conduct a thor-
ough, impartial examination.’’ On May 13, 
2021, in a letter published in Science, a group 
of 19 prominent scientists called for a deeper 
investigation of the two primary hypotheses: 
1) the virus began to spread after jumping 
from infected animals to humans; and 2) the 
virus was accidentally released from China’s 
Wuhan Institute of Virology and began 
spreading in the human population. 
Among other issues, these scientists call 
into question the China-WHO joint study’s 
consideration of the two main hypotheses 
stating, ‘‘Only 4 of the 313 pages of the report 
and its annexes addressed the possibility of a 
laboratory accident.’’ This fact is deeply 
concerning in light of recent media reports 
that, 
‘‘[t]hree 
researchers 
from 
China’s 
Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick 
enough in November 2019 that they sought 
hospital care.’’ 
In light of these reports and my continued 
concerns, please respond, in writing, to the 
following questions: 
1. According to reports, the WHO asked the 
U.S. government to recommend three ex-
perts for the China-WHO joint investigation 
team. Although they were not ultimately se-
lected, another U.S. scientist was selected 
for the team. 
a. Please name the three scientists rec-
ommended by the U.S., and articulate the 
WHO’s reasoning for not choosing these indi-
viduals. 
2. Beijing has refused to share critical raw 
data on the initial cases of COVID–19 in 
China. Has Beijing provided the U.S. with 
that data? If not, please explain why. 
3. The China-WHO joint investigation stat-
ed that they ‘‘lacked expertise and access to 
investigate a potential lab leak.’’ What will 
the administration do to insure that com-
petent, impartial experts are involved in fu-
ture investigations? 
4. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said 
the organization was not mandated to do a 
forensic audit. Why was this the case? Will 
your administration insist on a fulsome fo-
rensic audit for future outbreaks? 
I request the courtesy of a reply by June 
14, 2021. 
Sincerely, 
MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
U.S. Senator. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I 
would like to speak for a moment 
about S. 1. 
This bill says that politicians and 
unelected bureaucrats who spend their 
entire careers in the same few square 
miles of Washington, DC, know how to 
run Nebraska’s elections better than 
Nebraskans. I was glad to see the sen-
ior Senator from West Virginia come 
out against S. 1 and provide some 
much-needed honesty about what some 
Democrats’ true intentions are with 
this bill. 
I think he summed up this issue well 
when he wrote in his op-ed: ‘‘Today’s 
debate about how to best protect our 
right to vote and to hold elections, 
however, is not about finding common 
ground, but seeking partisan advan-
tage.’’ 
As I said at the Rules Committee’s 
markup for S. 1 a few weeks ago, I sim-
ply cannot understand why so many of 
my Democratic colleagues would like 
to hand over the control of our elec-
tions to the Federal Government. 
To take one example, this bill would 
allow candidates for the Senate to re-
ceive Federal funding for their cam-
paigns through a new program sup-
ported by Federal dollars. That would 
include a 6-to-1 match for contribu-
tions up to $200, meaning that, if a 
donor gives $100, Federal dollars com-
ing from taxpayers would match that 
with $600 more. 
During the bill’s markup, I offered an 
amendment to prevent sitting Members 
of the Senate from benefiting from this 
windfall, but it was rejected by all of 
my Democratic colleagues on the com-
mittee. This does not help voters make 
informed decisions. This only helps 
those of us who are already here in 
Congress. The changes S. 1 proposes 
only get more radical from there. 
This bill would effectively turn the 
bipartisan six-member Federal Elec-
tion 
Commission—the 
agency 
that 
oversees the financing of Federal elec-
tions—into a five-person panel subject 
to partisan control by giving the sit-
ting President the power to appoint an 
independent fifth Commissioner to the 
agency. Because only a slim majority 
would then be needed to make a deci-
sion, this Commissioner could act as 
the deciding vote on issues that have 
historically been bipartisan. 
If Senate Republicans were still in 
the majority and I told you that our 
leader wanted to pass a bill that would 
tip the balance of the FEC toward our 
party, those on the other side would 
object, and they would be right to do 
so. This Commission must remain 
truly bipartisan, and that is done by 
having equal Democratic and Repub-
lican membership. 
S. 1 would also repeal an appropria-
tions amendment that helps ensure the 
IRS does not infringe on the First 
Amendment rights of taxpayers who 
contribute to nonprofits. Allowing the 
IRS to possess this information when it 
is not a campaign finance enforcement 
agency only empowers bad actors at 
the agency to target groups that it dis-
likes. This is especially problematic 
given the recent leak of sensitive tax-
payer information, and the IRS’s his-
tory of targeting tax-exempt appli-
cants solely based on their political 
leanings. 
Also, this bill would not only allow 
people to register to vote at a polling 
place on election day without pre-
senting any form of identification, it 
would tell the 36 States that have some 
form of voter ID laws on the books now 
that those laws would be illegal. This 
is despite the fact that a majority of 
Americans supports requiring photo ID

to vote, and it flies in the face of the 
practices of other democracies, like 
Germany, the United Kingdom, Nor-
way, and France, which all require vot-
ers to verify their identities before 
casting their ballots. 
Despite 
all 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
changes this bill proposes, the most 
disheartening thing might be that it 
was introduced to solve a problem that 
doesn’t actually exist. More people 
voted in last year’s elections than ever 
before, including a record 76 percent of 
voters in my State of Nebraska. In the 
middle of a pandemic, voters turned 
out in historic numbers to make their 
voices heard. 
Defenders of this bill can’t say that 
this turnout was an issue, so they have 
tried to scapegoat States like Georgia 
and 
Florida, 
which 
have 
recently 
passed new election laws. President 
Biden went as far as to call Georgia’s 
bill ‘‘Jim Crow in the 21st century’’ be-
fore admitting that he was speaking 
about a very early draft, not the bill 
that actually became law. 
Reality gets in the way of that nar-
rative, too, as Georgia’s bill is less re-
strictive than the laws of more liberal 
States like New York and Delaware. 
Reasonable people can disagree about 
the best way to conduct elections, but 
it is disingenuous to say that some-
thing is voter suppression or undemo-
cratic just because you may not agree 
with it. 
I hope we can agree that we all want 
to make sure that all American voters 
are able to make their voices heard in 
our elections. To see that in action, 
you only have to look at States like 
Nebraska. We have been a ‘‘no excuse’’ 
State for absentee and early voting for 
years, which means that anyone who 
has already provided an ID when reg-
istering to vote can vote by mail for 
any reason whatsoever. In fact, a bill 
that originally allowed for mail-in vot-
ing in Nebraska was the first bill I in-
troduced and passed as a State legis-
lator in 2005. 
Many other States go out of their 
way to make it easy to vote, regardless 
of which party is in power and regard-
less of whether they are red States or 
blue States. That is the beauty of the 
American system. Each State can do as 
it sees fit and respond to events like 
the COVID–19 pandemic while still pro-
ducing positive reforms. By keeping 
States free from Federal mandates, we 
are allowing them to innovate and in-
troduce the changes that work best for 
them. 
Washington, DC, isn’t what makes 
America great. Our 50 States, each 
with its own history and its own needs, 
are what make this country so unique. 
This bill jeopardizes that diversity, 
and it would do away with a system 
that works well and replace it with one 
that would be partisan, divisive, and, 
frankly, chaotic. 
I think we would be making a ter-
rible mistake if we pass S. 1 as it is 
currently written.

SEC. 2. JUNETEENTH NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE 
DAY AS A LEGAL PUBLIC HOLIDAY. 
Section 6103(a) of title 5, United States 
Code, is amended by inserting after the item 
relating to Memorial Day the following: 
‘‘Juneteenth National Independence Day, 
June 19.’’. 
f 
JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 
269, submitted earlier today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 269) designating June 
19, 2021, as ‘‘Juneteenth Independence Day’’ 
in recognition of June 19, 1865, the date on 
which news of the end of slavery reached the 
slaves in the Southwestern States. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 269) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, thank 
you. That was the Juneteenth resolu-
tion, which we will talk about more to-
morrow. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the need for integrity in our elections. 
As I stand here, you know, prices are 
rising at the pump, and prices are ris-
ing at the grocery store. Inflation is 
the highest it has been basically since 
the financial crisis 13 years ago. 
The number of unfilled jobs is at a 
record high for our Nation. Small busi-
nesses, certainly in my home State in 
Wyoming and all across the country, 
have ‘‘help wanted’’ signs up; they 
can’t find workers. Some are worried 
they may have to shut down forever. 
We also have a crisis at the southern 
border. There is a lot happening in 
America today. Half a million illegal 
immigrants have crossed our border 
since Joe Biden took the oath of office 
to become President of the United 
States. Now, these are just the illegal 
immigrants whom we know about. 
Since Joe Biden became President, 
we have seized over 3,200 pounds of 
fentanyl at our southern border. That 
is enough fentanyl to kill every man, 
woman, and child living in America 
today. That is just one category of 
drugs, and these are the drugs that we 
know about. Just imagine what has 
come into the country that we don’t 
know about. 
Yet, despite the critics and the cri-
sis—President Biden has created a cri-
sis, and Democrats, certainly in this 
body, refuse to raise a finger to bring 
the crisis to an end. Instead, it seems 
that the Democrats are focused on only 
one thing and one thing alone, and that 
is seizing more power. 
We are told Democrats are going to 
bring a bill to the floor next week on 
election takeover in America. Now, the 
majority leader already knows that 
this bill cannot pass the U.S. Senate. It 
will not pass because he doesn’t even 
have the support for the votes in his 
own caucus, and that is because the 
bill is radical, it is extreme, it is dan-
gerous, and it is scary. It is actually a 
Federal takeover of elections in Amer-
ica. 
Under the Constitution, the times, 
places, and manner of holding elections 
is generally up to the States. This bill 
would flip the constitutional order and 
flip it upside down and put Congress 
and Washington in charge of elections, 
not each of our individual States. It 
would effectively repeal the election 
laws in all 50 States. 
This Democratic takeover attempt is 
over 800 pages in length, over 800 pages 
of mandates. Every page of the bill has 
one thing in common: makes it easier 
to cheat. Makes it easier to cheat in 
elections. 
For example, the bill would register 
people to vote automatically, whether 
they wanted to be registered or not. 
Automatic registration. Take everyone 
they have in databases throughout a 
State and sign them up. 
Now, under this bill, anyone who 
interacted with a State government 
would then be registered to vote. Well, 
this includes a lot of people who aren’t 
legally entitled to vote because they 
are not U.S. citizens. So these are obvi-
ously people who would not be eligible 
to vote. Doesn’t matter to Democrats— 
register them anyway. Maybe it is just 
a coincidence that Democrats opened 
our border before pushing this election 
takeover, where everybody in a data-
base in a State is registered to vote. 
Maybe it is not a coincidence. 
The bill also endorses something 
called ballot harvesting. That is where 
paid political operatives can go door to 
door and collect hundreds, thousands, 
tens of thousands of ballots—other peo-
ple’s ballots—and then they get to de-
cide which ballots they are going to 
turn in. No supervision. No account-
ability. None. These activists could de-
stroy, tamper, or lose ballots. These 
activists could do just that. No one 
would ever know. 
Additionally, the bill would force 
taxpayers to pay for political cam-
paigns. For every small political dona-
tion, taxpayers would pay and kick in 
an additional $6—$6 kicked in by the 
taxpayers for every $1 of small-dollar 
donations raised. Much of it is raised 
online. This is an invitation to money 
laundering. Activists could spread out 
donations to get free taxpayer money. 
One of my colleagues in the Senate 
on the Republican side of the aisle 
looked at this and said: ‘‘Gee.’’ Based 
on fundraising that he has done online, 
he would be entitled to a check from 
the government for $30 million. Tax-
payers don’t want to put that kind of 
taxpayer dollar behind any candidate, 
whether they are Republican or Demo-
crat. 
Democrats sit here and they claim 
they want less money in politics. Yet 
every several years—every 2 years, 
they outspend the Republicans. Now 
they want taxpayers to add to the 
money they are spending. Well, polit-
ical activists have plenty of money al-
ready. They don’t need additional tax-
payer dollars. 
Finally, this bill would ban voter ID. 
That means when you go to vote and 
you ask for a ballot—this is what voter 
ID is. You go to vote, you ask for a bal-
lot, and you have to show an identifica-
tion card that proves you are who you 
say you are. Democrats have been try-
ing to eliminate that one for a long, 
long time. Democrats claim that ask-
ing for identification is racist. 
The idea that people can’t get an ID 
is absurd. It is condescending. ID is re-
quired to check into a hotel. It is re-
quired to order a beer at a bar. It is re-
quired to buy a pack of cigarettes. It is 
required to get on an airplane—any air-
line in America. Voting is a lot more 
important than any of these things. It 
is the foundation of our entire system 
of government. We ought to make it 
safe, and we ought to make it secure. 
During 
the 
committee 
process, 
Democrats had a chance to fix the bill. 
Senator HYDE-SMITH from Mississippi 
said that she would like to take a look 
at this bill and use the campaign fund-
ing instead to help rural hospitals, in-
stead of this matching money of 6 to 1 
to candidates. Oh, no. Democrats didn’t 
want any part of that. They want the 
money. 
Senator 
FISCHER
and 
Senator 
HAGERTY said that we should delay the 
date the bill would go into effect. That 
would prevent a conflict of interest for 
the Democrats who vote for it, because, 
in a sense, the Democrats who vote for 
it would be getting the money them-
selves. Democrats said: No. No. We 
want the money. 
Senator HYDE-SMITH
and Senator 
CRUZ also tried to remove this ban on 
voter ID from the bill. Democrats said: 
Nope. People can show up, say whoever 
they want to say they are, and get a 
ballot. 
Democrats deny the existence of 
voter fraud. They claim no irregular-
ities ever happen—not in their elec-
tions. So then why are they trying to 
repeal or eliminate or take over every 
State voting law in the country? 
Truth is, there is a problem with our 
elections today. Yet the Democratic

bill would make these problems even 
worse. 
A majority of the public says they 
don’t want future elections to look like 
the last one—special situation, a pan-
demic. They don’t want future elec-
tions to look like the last one. The 
American people want security, and 
they want integrity. We want to trust 
that our elections are fair. 
That is why I have joined Senator 
SCOTT of Florida, Senator HYDE-SMITH, 
and Senator LUMMIS to introduce a bill 
specifically to give people more con-
fidence in our elections. It is called the 
Save Democracy Act. Our bill bans 
vote harvesting. It bans automatic reg-
istration. It requires at least a Social 
Security number to register to vote. 
Under our bill, States can’t just send 
out ballots in the mail based on old in-
formation. People could still vote by 
mail, as they do in my home State of 
Wyoming; they would just need to re-
quest a ballot. They wouldn’t get a bal-
lot automatically in the mail; they 
would have to request a ballot so that 
we know their information is up-to- 
date. These are the kind of common-
sense protections that our elections 
need. Our bill makes it actually harder 
to cheat, not easier. The Democrat’s 
bill makes it easier to cheat. 
At a time like this, when prices are 
too high, hiring is too low, the U.S. 
Senate has important work to do, the 
things that we hear about when we go 
home on weekends: What does it cost 
for gas? What does it cost for gro-
ceries? What does it cost to fill up your 
car? 
The American people want us to 
work on these bread-and-butter issues 
that affect their daily lives. They don’t 
want this partisan power grab that is 
going to be voted on in the Senate next 
week. They also don’t want the Senate 
wasting time on bills that cannot pass. 
It is time for the Democrats and the 
Democratic leader to focus on what the 
American people are asking us to focus 
on: bring down inflation, stop paying 
people more to not work than they 
would make if they were working, se-
cure our southern border, and leave our 
elections alone. That is what I hear at 
home, and I know that many of the 
Members are hearing the exact same 
thing as we work here to focus on what 
should be the future of a better, more 
prosperous America, not a one-sided 
America, with a domination of elec-
tions based on a law to make it easier 
to cheat. 
I yield the floor.

f 
RENEWABLE ENERGY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is 
no secret that this Senator has been a 
leader in promoting renewable energy 
sources. Iowa has done even more to 
lead the Nation in biofuels production. 
This leads to a cleaner environment 
and really increases America’s energy 
independence. 
Last week, Reuters reported the 
Biden administration is considering 
ways to allow U.S. oil refiners to not 
meet their biofuel blending require-
ments. This same administration has 
proposed hundreds of billions of dollars 
in subsidies for electric vehicles but 
failed to include any support for 
biofuels infrastructure, which play a 
vital role in our Nation’s transpor-
tation sector as well as our efforts to 
reduce greenhouse gases. 
Need I remind my colleagues, Presi-
dent Biden promised in his campaign to 
‘‘promote and advance renewable en-
ergy, ethanol, and other biofuels to 
help rural America and our nation’s 
farmers.’’ President Biden is not keep-
ing that promise. 
Unfortunately, despite the adminis-
tration’s emphasis on the environment 
and climate, their recent actions con-
tradict that and undermine their entire 
credibility. The biofuel industry has 
proven that ethanol reduces green-
house gas emissions from motor fuel by 
almost half. 
Almost every vehicle on the road can 
run on at least E10 ethanol. Many re-
tailers are now selling more E15 eth-
anol and other higher blends like E85, 
if you have a vehicle that can use E85. 
Whether it is 10 percent, 15 percent, or 
85 percent, it is cleaner than 100 per-
cent petroleum. 
According to the Energy Information 
Administration, by 2050, 81 percent of 
new vehicle sales will still be gas-pow-
ered or flex fuel. 
In my introductory telephone con-
versation 
with 
EPA 
Administrator 
Regan, when he was nominated, he told 
me that biofuels are a major tool in the 
Biden administration’s plan to combat 
climate change. I stressed to him at 
that 
time 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
biofuels industry to both agriculture 
and energy, and Iowa happens to be the 
No. 1 producer of ethanol. 
No matter what the EPA or Big Oil 
says about the impact of its waivers to 
oil companies making billions in prof-
its, farmers and biofuel producers know 
and feel the negative impact. Any at-
tempt to exempt oil refiners from their 
biofuels obligation is a blatant bailout. 
The law is simple: Blend biofuels or 
buy credits from those who do. By add-
ing more biofuels to our energy mix, 
we can reduce emissions from dirty oil 
while keeping transportation costs low 
for working families. 
Unfortunately, despite the adminis-
tration’s emphasis on environment, it 
seems like biofuels don’t appear to be 
much of a priority and well short of 
what nominee at that time, now-EPA 
Director Regan said that it would be. 
Now it looks like labor unions have 
been co-opted by Big Oil, and we are 
doing their bidding in the White House. 
President Biden is now faced with a 
decision. He can lower greenhouse 
gases with biofuels or he can side with 
Big Oil to destroy biofuel demand by il-
legally tampering with the renewable 
fuel standard, just as we had problems 
with previous administrations, both 
Republican and Democratic—referring 
to what the Obama and Trump admin-
istrations did with the small refineries 
exemption. 
Whether it is labor unions or Big Oil, 
I won’t tire in standing up for home-
grown clean biofuels. I did that wheth-
er we had Democratic or Republican 
administrations. I will continue to ad-
vocate for Iowans and the biofuels be-
cause it strengthens U.S. energy inde-
pendence, makes for a cleaner environ-
ment, and creates jobs in rural Amer-
ica. 
I encourage President Biden, EPA 
Administrator Regan, and my col-
leagues from across the aisle to keep it 
clean. 
Does President Biden want to be 
known as ‘‘Big Oil’’ Biden? I don’t 
think he does. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. RES. 134 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, for more 
than 100 years, throughout times of 
change, tumult, and uncertainty, there 
has been a constant: the special rela-
tionship between the United States and 
the United Kingdom. 
The UK has been one of our staunch-
est and most loyal allies. We have 
stood beside each other through two 
World Wars and the Cold War. In the 
21st century, the United States and the 
United Kingdom have become even 
stronger friends and partners, both in 
the fight against global terrorism and 
for freedom, peace, and prosperity. 
Now an opportunity lies before us to 
strengthen the relationship more than 
ever by securing a free-trade agree-
ment between our two nations, which 
is the purpose of the resolution before 
us today. The trading relationship be-
tween our countries is already really 
strong. For hundreds of years, it has 
been a force for economic prosperity 
and security for us both. 
In just 2019, the total trade in goods 
and services between our two countries 
totaled $273 billion, and the United 
Kingdom was the seventh largest trad-
ing partner of the United States in 
goods. Figures from that same year 
show that U.S. trade with the United 
Kingdom resulted in a $21.8 billion 
trade surplus. 
The United States and the United 
Kingdom, in fact, share the single larg-
est bilateral trade and investment rela-
tionship in the world. And now, with 
the UK’s newfound ability to negotiate 
independent free-trade deals, we have 
the opportunity to grow that relation-
ship even more. 
A free-trade agreement would allow 
even more goods and services to flow 
even more easily between our two 
countries. It would allow for expanded 
commercial partnerships and greater 
investments in emerging industries. It 
would serve as an even greater engine 
of prosperity and economic liberty on 
both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4541 
June 15, 2021 
This is a no-brainer, and it would be 
a tremendous asset in the midst of the 
economic and geopolitical challenges 
we face today. The pandemic and sup-
ply chain turmoil have proven that 
friends are invaluable in a pinch. While 
many global relationships have been 
unsteady and many governments don’t 
know what their future trading rela-
tionships will look like, the United 
Kingdom has been a stalwart and se-
cure partner with the United States. 
Furthermore, it could not be a better 
move in the age of great power com-
petition with China. We will not beat 
China by trying to be like China in im-
posing centralized command-and-con-
trol grips on the economy that will 
strangle trade and trample free enter-
prise. Instead, we should do what we 
have always done best: prioritize free, 
open, and fair commerce with friendly 
nations, as the G7 this past weekend 
confirmed. 
At the conclusion of the summit, the 
group, as a whole, agreed to ‘‘secure 
our future prosperity by championing 
freer, fairer trade within a reformed 
trading 
system.’’ 
And 
the 
United 
States and the United Kingdom signed 
a New Atlantic Charter in which both 
countries committed to take actions 
‘‘enabling open and fair trade between 
nations.’’ 
Securing a mutually beneficial trade 
agreement with one of our oldest and 
closest allies would be in the best in-
terest of us all. As President Biden 
himself recently said: ‘‘America’s alli-
ances are our greatest asset, and lead-
ing with diplomacy means standing 
shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies 
and key partners once again.’’ 
On this point, I could not agree with 
President Biden more. Congress can 
seize this opportunity by supporting 
the resolution before us today. It is a 
simple, straightforward resolution de-
claring the sense of the Senate that the 
United States has and should have a 
close and mutually beneficial trade re-
lationship with the United Kingdom 
without interruption and that the 
President, with the support of Con-
gress, should lay the groundwork for a 
future trade agreement between the 
United States and the United Kingdom. 
Borrowing a phrase from Prime Min-
ister Boris Johnson, after his first face- 
to-face meeting with President Biden 
at the summit this past weekend, the 
United States-United Kingdom rela-
tionship is ‘‘indestructible.’’ No two 
nations have worked more closely to-
gether. No two peoples have done more 
to expand and defend liberty or to 
achieve peace and prosperity. 
Throughout history, this partnership 
has steadied the world through some of 
its greatest perils. It can continue to 
do so today if only we let it. The Amer-
ican and British peoples have the op-
portunity to once again join forces and 
emerge from the challenges we face 
stronger than ever for the benefit of 
our countries and nations across the 
globe. To that end, I urge each of my 
colleagues to support this resolution. 
And I ask unanimous consent that 
the Finance Committee be discharged 
from further consideration, and the 
Senate now proceed to S. Res. 134. I 
further ask that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, first, this resolu-
tion—and I am just going to make a 
few key points here—is on the trade 
agreement with the UK, and it is a 
question of international trade, which 
falls under the jurisdiction of the Fi-
nance Committee. 
The committee has not been con-
sulted on the resolution so Senators 
have not had adequate time to consider 
it. Needless to say, the prospect of re-
shaping the American economy with 
sweeping trade deals is not something 
that should just rocket past the com-
mittee of jurisdiction. 
Second, 
I 
have 
serious 
concerns 
about blessing a potential trade agree-
ment with the United Kingdom when 
the contents of such an agreement are 
still unknown. I stated a number of 
times that there are serious issues that 
need consideration with respect to our 
economic relationship with the United 
Kingdom. That cannot happen if the 
debates play out in a slapdash process 
on the floor of the Senate. 
For example, the United Kingdom 
has not only proposed but implemented 
a discriminatory digital service tax 
since entering negotiations with the 
United States. What they are doing is 
opportunistically 
looting 
American 
technology 
companies 
before 
these 
measures are shut down by an FTA or 
another agreement. The UK is also con-
sidering other discriminatory policies. 
The UK must commit to abandoning 
these unfair policies, which are serious 
barriers to trade, a detriment to the 
special relationship, harmful to Amer-
ican workers, as a precondition of hon-
est and worthwhile negotiations. 
Otherwise, if Senators are going to 
rush to hand out big promises on trade 
talks, they risk surrendering America’s 
negotiating position on these key 
issues without getting anything in re-
turn. 
So I don’t see the wisdom in under-
mining good-paying American jobs and 
American businesses with a trading 
partner that has thus far seen no rea-
son to back away from discriminatory 
measures. For those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the comments and the insight provided 
by my friend and colleague, the distin-
guished Senator from Oregon. 
As to the point regarding our relative 
negotiating power and the wisdom of 
approaching this task right now, it is 
important to remember this resolution 
doesn’t purport to offer the details of 
any such deal. It calls for a free-trade 
agreement. There is nothing surren-
dered by that. There is, however, a lot 
to be gained by that in signaling that 
we want to continue to have an open, 
free, and fair relationship with the 
United Kingdom. 
As to the process concerns articu-
lated by my friend and colleague, while 
he has expressed some concerns about 
the process, I must provide some evi-
dence to the contrary. 
Over the past year, my staff has com-
municated with the Senate Finance 
Committee staff, staff on both sides of 
the aisle, upward of half a dozen times. 
They have also pitched changes to as-
suage concerns about language mul-
tiple times but never received any de-
finitive responses. 
Furthermore, I have worked with col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
craft almost identical draft language 
on 
United 
States-United 
Kingdom 
trade that was included in S. Res. 117, 
on the Good Friday Agreement, which 
passed before this body without objec-
tion. There is no reason why we can’t 
reach a similar compromise on this 
legislation, and I stand ready and will-
ing to work with my colleague from 
Oregon to do so.

Enduring Freedom, and a battalion op-
erations and executive officer, bat-
talion commander, as well as a division 
deputy commanding general in Iraq 
during Operation Iraqi Freedom and

mand and General Staff College and 
the United States Army War College. 
For the past 30 months, Major Gen-
eral Eifler has implemented and en-
hanced 
strategic 
partnerships 
with 
Congress. Through his leadership, the 
Army significantly advanced relation-
ships with both legislative chambers 
and improved and broadened congres-
sional support for Army priorities. 
Major General Eifler managed complex 
issues through multiple legislative cy-
cles, enabling the Army to receive the 
necessary resources to take care of its 
most precious recourse, its people, im-
prove readiness, and accelerate mod-
ernization to support combat oper-
ations, 
sustain 
the 
All-Volunteer 
Force, and improve the quality of life 
for soldiers, Army civilians, and their 
families. 
On behalf of Congress and the United 
States of America, we thank Major 
General Eifler, his wife Sherry, and 
their entire family for their continued 
commitment, sacrifice, and contribu-
tions to this great Nation. We join our 
colleagues in wishing him future suc-
cesses as he continues to serve our 
great Army and Nation.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO UNDERSHERIFF 
GEORGE SKULETICH 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Undersheriff 
George 
Skuletich 
of 
Butte-Silver Bow County as Montanan 
of the Month for his steadfast service 
to the Butte community for more than 
40 years. 
George started as a detention officer 
at the Butte jail on June 5, 1981, and 
later was appointed as a Butte police 
officer in June of 1985. Since that time, 
he has served as a patrol officer, patrol 
sergeant, patrol lieutenant, DARE offi-
cer, school resource officer, SWAT offi-
cer, and patrol captain. He was instru-
mental in the design and building of 
the Law Enforcement Center as well as 
the Butte-Silver Bow Detention Cen-
ter. George has served as Butte-Silver 
undersheriff since January of 2013. 
George embodies the heart of a Mon-
tanan and the public service and dedi-
cation of a Montana law enforcement 
officer. Butte-Silver Bow Sheriff Ed 
Lester has said if he had to go through 
a door, not knowing what was on the 
other side, he would take George with 
him because he would never leave a fel-
low officer behind, no matter how bad 
things got. There is no higher com-
pliment. 
George has responded to nearly any 
type of incident you can think of, from 
aircraft crashes to bomb threats, and 
his calm and respectful demeanor has 
proven him to be a valuable leader. 
George truly cares about the Mon-
tanans he has served. On behalf of a 
grateful Butte community, I want to 
thank George for his service to the 
great State of Montana, and I wish him 
a peaceful and relaxing retirement.∑

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF OREGON 
TRAIL DAYS 
∑ Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I 
would like to recognize the 100th anni-
versary of Oregon Trail Days. This Ne-
braska tradition honors our State’s 
history as one of the first stops on the 
Oregon Trail. Settlers would start 
their journey on the banks of the Mis-
souri River, passing through Kansas 
before turning north into Nebraska. 
Their journey took them through hun-
dreds of miles of central and western 
Nebraska, 
including 
past 
Chimney 
Rock, the most noted landmark on the 
Oregon Trail’s nearly 2,200 miles. 
Oregon Trail Days has commemo-
rated this pioneer history every year 
since 1921, when it started as a small, 1- 
day parade. Today, this festival has 
grown into a 4-day celebration that 
takes over the town of Gering in the 
Nebraska Panhandle for 1 weekend 
each July. Oregon Trail Days has 
something for everyone: Visitors can 
enjoy concerts, parades, an arts and 
crafts fair, sporting events, food shows, 
car exhibitions, and even a chili cook- 
off. This is a wonderful opportunity to 
get together and remember the adven-
turous spirit of the pioneers who set-
tled our land, and who built strong 
communities for their families across 
Nebraska. 
Mr. President, I am honored to com-
memorate the 100th anniversary of Or-
egon Trail Days here in the Senate. 
Here is to 100 more years of this be-
loved tradition.∑

TRIBUTE TO JOHN PAYIAVLAS 
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the achievements of 
a friend of mine and a great Ohioan, 
John Payiavlas, who recently cele-
brated his 90th birthday. 
John was born in 1931 to Greek immi-
grants 
Anthony 
and 
Paraskevi 
Payiavlas in Warren, Oh. At the age of 
20, he was drafted into the U.S. Army 
and underwent basic training at Fort 
Riley in Kansas. In 1952, he was de-
ployed to South Korea, where he joined 
U.N. forces in supporting South Korea 
as part of Fox Company, 7th Regiment, 
3rd Infantry Division. He later trans-
ferred to the Greek Expeditionary 
Force Batallion—one of four Greek 
Americans to serve in this batallion— 
and was awarded the Commander’s Sil-
ver Cross of Valour for his exemplary 
service. He was honorably discharged 
in 1953 as sergeant first class. 
John and his wife Marisa, who this 
year will celebrate their 65th wedding 
anniversary, were married 3 years after 
John returned home to Ohio from the 
service. In 1960, John purchased a small 
company called Automatic Vendors, 
which later became a multimillion-dol-
lar 
corporation 
known 
as 
AVI 
Foodsystems. Since its inception, AVI 
has served customers in more than 
6,500 locations across the United States 
and has become the largest independ-
ently owned and operated contract food 
service company in the Nation. Cur-
rently, the company provides vending, 
institutional dining, and coffee service 
operations to companies across Amer-
ica. 
Today, John Payiavlas runs the com-
pany alongside his children, Anthony 
and Patrice Kouvas. The Payiavlas 
family has made tremendous contribu-
tions to their community, including a 
generous gift of $500,000 to Youngstown 
State University for their new sports 
media center. In 2006, John and his wife 
were honored with the Cleveland Clin-
ic’s Distinguished Fellow Award for 
their support of the clinic’s initiatives, 
such as the Heart and Vascular Insti-
tute, the Taussig Cancer Center, and 
the Glickman Urological Institute. 
John Payiavlas has received numer-
ous accolades for his accomplishments. 
In 2000, John was inducted into the 
Business Hall of Fame of Northeast 
Ohio’s Inside Business Magazine. In 
2016, he was honored for his service in 
the Korean war with the Washington 
Oxi Day Foundation’s Jaharis Service 
Award. In addition, John holds the 
highest honor in all Christendom for a 
lay person as an Archon Depoutatos of 
the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which 
dates back to the fourth century in the 
Greek Orthodox Church. The service 
and achievements of John Payiavlas 
extend well beyond the State of Ohio, 
and I applaud the lasting impact his 
success will have on our future genera-
tions.∑

towering

ments in business, politics, religion,

earned 42nd Giant in our City award.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4543 
June 15, 2021 
Bob and Kathi’s lifetime commit-
ment to service is aspirational for all 
and worthy of the highest praise. Their 
community engagement efforts over 
many decades have transformed the 
automobile industry, expanded edu-
cational opportunities for young people 
with the Keys to Success and Road to 
Success programs, and their support to 
the University of Utah gave rise to new 
buildings for business education and 
athletics. Bob and Kathi’s legacy is 
deeply woven into Utah’s fabric of 
cherished values—prioritizing family, 
service, education, and the welfare of 
our future generations. 
The Garff family’s vast impact on 
our State is, in part, due to their will-
ingness to serve in positions of leader-
ship and public trust. Kathi served as 
chair of the Utah State Board of Edu-
cation and was a board member for the 
Utah Board of Regents. She also guided 
education policy on the University of 
Utah’s 
National 
Advisory 
Council, 
served on the board of the Crimson 
Club, and was chair of their President’s 
Club. 
Bob, too, donated his time to ele-
vating health initiatives as a member 
of the American Cancer Society and 
Intermountain Healthcare and boosted 
Utah’s athletic profile on the world 
stage as chairman of the Board of 
Trustees of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee for the 2002 Olympic Winter 
Games. There, I witnessed firsthand 
Bob’s talent for complex problem solv-
ing and his compassionate and ethical 
leadership. His accomplishments also 
include serving as chairman of the Salt 
Lake Chamber of Commerce and the 
Deseret Book Company, a board mem-
ber of First Security Bank, a member 
of the Salt Lake Convention and Visi-
tors Bureau, and the Utah Commission 
on Volunteers. As the former speaker 
of the House of Representatives for the 
State of Utah, Bob has cemented his 
legacy of consequential public service 
for all time. 
A celebration of Bob and Kathi Garff 
would be incomplete without high-
lighting the significant role of faith in 
their lives, including their shared com-
mitment to the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. Over the years, 
Bob was called to serve as bishop, 
president of the England Coventry Mis-
sion, stake president at the Univeristy 
of Utah, and president of the Bountiful 
Temple. May his strong faith guide Bob 
as we remember and cherish his time 
with us. 
Kathi and Bob’s selfless contribu-
tions to the welfare of our State will 
endure through the ages, and Utahns 
will remember them for their lifetime 
commitment to public service. Their 5 
children, 21 grandchildren, and 4 great- 
grandchildren carry on the honorable 
tradition of their beloved Bob and 
Kathi Garff.∑

TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL A. 
SPRAYBERRY 
∑ Mr. TILLIS. President, I rise today 
to 
pay 
tribute 
to 
Michael 
A. 
Sprayberry, who is retiring as director 
of the North Carolina Division of 
Emergency Management, NCEM, and 
the North Carolina Office of Recovery 
and 
Resiliency, 
NCORR. 
Mr. 
Sprayberry has served North Carolina 
for over 42 years and has exemplified 
the highest standard of leadership, ef-
fectiveness, and professionalism, and I 
thank him for his valued service to our 
State. 
Mr. Sprayberry was born in Atlanta, 
GA and moved to North Carolina in 
high school. He went on to serve our 
Nation in the U.S. Marine Corps and in 
the North Carolina National Guard for 
11 years. In 1979, Mike received his 
bachelor of science in business admin-
istration from the University of North 
Carolina at Charlotte. He continued his 
education and received his master of 
arts degree in history. 
Mike’s entire career has been in serv-
ice to his country and the Sate. During 
his years of service with the National 
Guard, he was awarded the Meritorious 
Service Medal with three bronze oak 
leaf clusters and the North Carolina 
National Guard Distinguished Service 
Medal. He received the Order of the 
Long Leaf Pine in 1998 and was in-
ducted into the North Carolina Na-
tional 
Guard’s 
Officer 
Candidate 
School Hall of Fame in August of 2011. 
In 2005, Director Sprayberry began 
his career in emergency management 
as the deputy director and logistics 
chief. He served in this capacity until 
2013, when he was appointed to serve as 
director under Governor Pat McCrory. 
Mr. Sprayberry is the longest serving 
emergency management director in 
North Carolina’s history. During his 
tenure, he successfully oversaw the 
State’s response to 19 State declared 
disasters and 11 federally declared dis-
asters. He has led North Carolina 
through hurricanes, earthquakes, win-
ter storms, and a pandemic. 
Mr. Sprayberry is nationally re-
spected and has served as president of 
the National Emergency Management 
Association and is a member of the 
FEMA National Advisory Council. 
Mr. President, thanks to Mike’s lead-
ership, North Carolina is better pre-
pared to deal with both natural and 
man-made disasters. Please join me in 
thanking Director Mike Sprayberry, 
his wife, and his daughters for his ca-
reer in public service and wishing him 
a joyful retirement.∑

the workplace is changing with auto-
mation, artificial intelligence, and the 
so-called gig economy transforming 
the nature of work. These trends have 
only accelerated in the wake of the 
pandemic and its economic fallout. 
That is why I am proud to be intro-
ducing the bipartisan Partnerships for 
Affordability 
and 
Student 
Success 
(PASS) Act with my colleague, Senator 
COLLINS. 
The 
pandemic 
has 
upended 
edu-
cational opportunities for this genera-
tion of students. Unlike previous eco-
nomic downturns when college enroll-
ment climbed, the National Student 
Clearinghouse is reporting the largest 
decline in college enrollment in over a 
decade, with low-income and commu-
nity college students experiencing the 
sharpest declines. For too many Ameri-
cans, postsecondary education seems 
increasingly risky or out of reach. 
The Federal government cannot solve 
the crisis on its own. States are crit-
ical partners in making college acces-
sible, affordable, equitable, and ac-
countable. However, State funding for 
higher education is lower today than it 
was before the onset of the Great Re-
cession. According to the latest State 
Higher Education Finance report pub-
lished by the State Higher Education 
Executive Officers, public colleges and 
universities have become more reliant 
on tuition dollars for their operations. 
Today, in half of the States, tuition ac-
counts for more than half of all higher 
education revenue. Moreover, the only 
Federal-State partnership program for 
need-based 
financial 
aid—the 
Leveraging 
Educational 
Assistance 
Partnership (LEAP) program—has not 
received appropriations since Fiscal 
Year 2010 
It is time to renew the Federal-State 
partnership for higher education, first 
enacted in 1972 on a bipartisan basis. 
The PASS Act will revitalize the Fed-
eral-State partnership through a for-
mula grant to States with a focus on 
need-based aid, grants to institutions 
to improve student outcomes and re-
duce college costs, and public account-
ability. 
In exchange for this new Federal in-
vestment, States must make a commit-
ment to maintain their investment in 
higher education and have a com-
prehensive plan for higher education 
with measurable goals for access, af-
fordability, and student outcomes. At 
least half of the funding must be dedi-
cated to need-based student financial 
aid. States also have the option of 
awarding grants to colleges and univer-
sities or partnerships between institu-
tions of higher education and non-prof-
it organizations to improve student 
outcomes, including enrollment, com-
pletion, and employment, and to de-
velop innovative methods for reducing 
college costs. I am pleased to have the 
support of the National Association of 
State Student Grant and Aid Pro-
grams, the National Association of 
Independent Colleges and Universities, 
the Association of Community College 
Trustees, and the Bipartisan Policy 
Center. 
This generation is facing a crisis in 
college affordability and student loan 
debt. With the PASS Act, we seek to 
provide the resources and incentives 
for States to take more responsibility 
to address college affordability and 
student loan debt and improve student 
outcomes. I urge my colleagues to co-
sponsor this legislation and look for-
ward to working with them to include 
these and other key reforms in the up-
coming reauthorization of the Higher 
Education Act.

S. RES. 269 
Whereas news of the end of slavery did not 
reach the frontier areas of the United States, 
in particular the State of Texas and the 
other Southwestern States, until months 
after the conclusion of the Civil War, more 
than 21⁄2 years after President Abraham Lin-
coln issued the Emancipation Proclamation 
on January 1, 1863; 
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, 
led by Major General Gordon Granger, ar-
rived in Galveston, Texas, with news that 
the Civil War had ended and the enslaved 
were free; 
Whereas African Americans who had been 
slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 19, 
commonly known as ‘‘Juneteenth Independ-
ence Day’’, as inspiration and encourage-
ment for future generations; 
Whereas 
African 
Americans 
from 
the 
Southwest have continued the tradition of 
observing Juneteenth Independence Day for 
more than 150 years; 
Whereas Juneteenth Independence Day 
began as a holiday in the State of Texas and 
is now celebrated in 48 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia as a special day of observ-
ance in recognition of the emancipation of 
all slaves in the United States; 
Whereas Juneteenth Independence Day 
celebrations have been held to honor Afri-
can-American freedom while encouraging 
self-development and respect for all cultures; 
Whereas the faith and strength of char-
acter demonstrated by former slaves and the 
descendants of former slaves remain an ex-
ample for all people of the United States, re-
gardless of background, religion, or race; 
Whereas slavery was not officially abol-
ished until the ratification of the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States in December 1865; and 
Whereas, over the course of its history, the 
United States has grown into a symbol of de-
mocracy and freedom around the world: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 19, 2021, as ‘‘Juneteenth 
Independence Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the historical significance of 
Juneteenth Independence Day to the United 
States; 
(3) supports the continued nationwide cele-
bration of Juneteenth Independence Day to 
provide an opportunity for the people of the 
United States to learn more about the past 
and to better understand the experiences 
that have shaped the United States; and 
(4) recognizes that the observance of the 
end of slavery is part of the history and her-
itage of the United States.

Whereas a vibrant regional gas market will 
promote prosperity and provide a sustainable 
path for economic development; 
Whereas the EMGF promotes technical and 
market collaboration in energy, including by 
ensuring a competitive price for natural gas, 
the development of new energy technologies, 
and increased cooperation on cyber security; 
Whereas the EMGF and the Eastern Medi-
terranean Pipeline will provide European na-
tions with robust energy alternatives and de-
crease reliance on the Russian Federation;

Whereas Tarek El-Molla, Minister of Pe-
troleum and Mineral Resources of the Arab 
Republic of Egypt, stated, ‘‘The EMGF will

become an exemption to the historic norm of 
perceiving our current and prospective en-
ergy wealth as a motivation for conflict’’; 
Whereas Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Min-

‘‘brings regional cooperation with Arab and 
European countries, the first of its kind in 
history’’; 
Whereas Hala Zawati, Minister of Energy 
and Mineral Resources of the Hashemite 
Kingdom of Jordan, stated, ‘‘Within the 
Eastern Mediterranean and utilizing our gas 
resources 
and 
infrastructure—cooperating 
and working together, given all the chal-
lenges, became a must. We believe that this 
platform will serve to enhance dialogue be-
tween countries to reach a clear regional vi-
sion, a vision that translates into policies for 
a sustainable regional gas market in the 
Eastern Mediterranean.’’; and 
Whereas the EMGF is part of a growing 
network of regional agreements and frame-
works that provide the basis for long-term 
peace and cooperation on vital issues related 
to diplomatic engagement, collective secu-
rity, economic growth, and energy develop-
ment, 
including

signed on September 15, 2020, by the United

FATHER EDWARD FLAHERTY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Reverend Ed-
ward Flaherty, Veteran of the United States 
Army, for his service to our country. 
Father Flaherty served in the U.S. Army 
from 1941 to 1945, serving two years, eleven 
months, and two days throughout the Pacific 
theater of World War II, including time in New 
Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, and Papua 
New Guinea. While serving in the Army, Fa-
ther Flaherty was a Medical Technician with 
the 131st Engineer Regiment Medical Detach-
ment, in which he played an essential role in 
treating his fellow soldiers’ wounds and inju-
ries while also assisting with evacuations for 
casualties. 
During his time in the Army, Father Flaherty 
earned the American Defense Service Ribbon, 
the Good Conduct Medal, and the Philippine 
Liberation Ribbon with one star but he was 
never awarded the physical medals. After in-
quiring on his behalf, our office discovered ad-
ditional medals he earned but never received. 
After his discharge from the U.S. Army, Fa-
ther Flaherty returned to his hometown of 
Kansas City and worked for Folger’s as a 
bookkeeper and accountant. He formally en-
tered the Jesuit order in 1959 at 40 years of 
age and was ordained as a priest in 1965. He 
then moved to Colorado in 1967 and taught at 
Regis University. He became a staple in the 
Colorado Jesuit community for the next sev-
eral decades, most recently pastoring at the 
Shrine of St. Anne Parish in Arvada, Colo. 
Father Flaherty’s courageous service helped 
to defend our nation’s democracy and ideals 
abroad at a crucial moment in world history. 
His heroism has charted the path for future 
generations of men and women who serve in 
the military. We are proud to have Father 
Flaherty call Colorado home for so many 
years, and forever indebted to him for his 
bravery and sacrifice on behalf of our country. 
I extend my deepest appreciation to Father 
Flaherty for his dedication, integrity and out-
standing service to the United States of Amer-
ica.

TRIBUTE TO BRUCE DOYLE 
VARNER 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to Bruce Doyle 
Varner, who passed away on Saturday, May 
8, 2021. Bruce was a dedicated leader in the 
Inland Empire region of California, and he will 
be deeply missed. 
Bruce was born in Los Angeles, California in 
1936. His family would later move up the 
coast to San Luis Obispo, where he would 
spend the bulk of his youth. After high school, 
Bruce decided to attend the University of Cali-
fornia, Santa Barbara, where he would go on 
to be a star football and baseball player. De-
spite being recruited by a few professional 
football teams, Bruce was focused on a future 
legal career. Before entering law school, 
Bruce served briefly in the U.S. Army. At UC 
Hastings Law School, he became Editor in 
Chief of the Law Review and graduated Order 
of the Coif. After passing the California Bar 
Examination in 1962, Bruce moved to the In-
land Empire and launched his legal career at 
a prominent law firm. 
In 1975, Bruce married his wife, Nancy, at 
the Mission Inn Chapel in Riverside, Cali-
fornia. He quickly became one of the region’s 
top corporate and business transactional attor-
neys. Bruce was especially proud of his work 
in collaboration with former Stater Bros. Mar-
kets’ President Jack Brown during the 1986 
proxy battle over control of the company. 
Bruce and Jack were successful, and Stater 
Bros. would emerge as one of the leading su-
permarket chains in our region. In another 
landmark effort, Bruce was instrumental in the 
conversion of a portion of Norton Air Force 
Base into the Stater Bros. corporate head-
quarters, warehouse and distribution center 
after the base was closed. In addition to his 
legal practice, Bruce was nominated to serve 
on the University of California Board of Re-
gents 
in 
2006 
by 
Governor 
Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. 
Bruce was predeceased by his beloved 
wife, Nancy, and survived by his brother Ron; 
sons Kevin, Sean, Brett, and daughter, Nicole; 
grandchildren Zoey, Peyton, Marcus, Devin, 
Ancel, Finley, Fiona and Bruce; daughters-in- 
law, Tracy and Kristin; and son-in-law Brian. I 
extend my heartfelt condolences to the Varner 
family, his friends, and everyone fortunate 
enough to know Bruce. Although he may be 
gone, the many contributions Bruce made to 
his community and family will have a lasting 
impact.

HONORING GARLAND LIFE 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Garland Life, who died on June 2, 
2021 at the age of 78. Mr. Life was a longtime 
educator in the Roanoke Valley who made a 
tremendous positive impact on his students. 
Mr. Life was born on June 15, 1942 in 
McGaheysville, Virginia to Cecil and Mary 
Burner Life. He grew up on a farm and grad-
uated from Montevideo High School. Subse-
quently, he earned degrees from Bridgewater 
College and the University of Virginia. 
During his career as an educator, he 
worked as a teacher, a principal at Andrew 
Lewis High School in Salem and Cave Spring 
High School, and an administrator of Roanoke 
County Schools. His students benefited from 
the lessons he taught and the learning envi-
ronment he created. I recognized this firsthand 
as one of the students at Andrew Lewis High 
School when he was principal. When the 
Salem School Board signaled intentions to re-
move Andrew Lewis from the high school’s 
name and I wanted to keep it, he let me pur-
sue what would become my first public cam-
paign in the community. He could have 
stopped this student-led movement, but he 
didn’t. I have always appreciated the indul-
gence he showed his students on this occa-
sion. 
Mr. Life is survived by his wife, Kimberly 
Hale; son and daughter-in-law, Jason and 
Amy Life, daughter and son-in-law, Sarah and 
Paul Tesoriere; grandchildren, Benjamin and 
Megan Life and Bella and Luca Tesoriere; 
stepdaughter, Gretchen Roberts; stepson An-
drew Roberts; and sister, Janet Wayland. I 
offer them my condolences on their loss.

SIONAL WOMEN OF THE YEAR 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Woman of the Year 
Award recipient, Courtney Haile of San Luis 
Obispo, California. 
Courtney brings a bold and honest voice to 
community advocacy and her work on equity, 
justice, and belonging. As a student, Courtney 
explored media representation, race, and gen-
der, and examined Black identity development 
in predominantly white communities. She 
dreams of a more equitable and inclusive 
world for people of color to live in, and she is 
measurably helping to create such a world on 
the Central Coast. In response to the death of 
Philando Castile and others, she co-founded 
R.A.C.E. Matters, a grassroots organization 
amplifying racial justice and centering Black 
voices through art and culture. As Executive 
Director, Courtney is a driving force for the or-
ganization’s creative endeavors, cultural pro-
grams, and organization of local racial justice 
events. Courtney executes and stands by her 
vision with class, grace, and intelligence. 
Courtney participates in a range of commu-
nity activities and most enjoys collaborating 
with community partners to create bold, beau-
tiful, and engaging experiences. In her mission 
to help people honor and better understand 
the needs and contributions of the Black mem-
bers of our community, Courtney spearheads 
the visionary art series, BELONGING, and

produced two original documentary films, Re-
strictions Apply, about San Luis Obispo’s his-
tory of housing discrimination and Kut To Be 
the Best: The Last Black Barbershop in San 
Luis Obispo, as a tribute to Black owned busi-
nesses and the importance of the cultural 
spaces created by them. 
Courtney’s work through R.A.C.E. Matters 
has opened the eyes of the community to the 
talents, contributions, and value of our Black 
citizens. Given that our county is but 2.2 per-
cent Black, this is a tall order, but Courtney 
has been able to shine her light and lead the 
way toward this vision. San Luis Obispo Coun-
ty is better off because Courtney Haile lives 
here. 
I am honored to recognize Courtney for her 
continued commitment to improving our com-
munity and the residents of San Luis Obispo 
County. I ask all Members to join me today in 
honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 
24th Congressional District, Courtney Haile, 
for her incredible service to her community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER 
TONAWANDA SUPERVISOR RON-
ALD H. MOLINE 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of the late 
Tonawanda Town Supervisor Ronald H. Mo-
line, a native of Western New York. Ron was 
well-liked and well-respected as an educator, 
and served as a member of the Tonawanda 
Town Board for more than a quarter-century. 
A graduate of Sweet Home High School and 
the State University of New York at Buffalo, 
Ron began a career as a high school history 
teacher with Buffalo Public Schools in 1964. In 
1981, he embarked upon a political career in 
the town of Tonawanda, winning a grueling 
race for a seat on the Town Board. After the 
incumbent Supervisor passed away two years 
later, Mr. Moline accepted appointment to the 
position, and subsequently won election to the 
seat in his own right. Ron would move back to 
a seat as Councilman in 1993 and would 
again become Supervisor in 2000. 
As Supervisor, Ron worked to grow indus-
trial parks in Tonawanda, and worked closely 
with companies including General Motors, 
Dunlop, DuPont, and Praxair to both maintain 
current jobs in Tonawanda and grow opportu-
nities for both corporations and local workers. 
Ron was an innovator in local government as 
well, establishing a Yahoo chat room in 2001 
for concerned citizens to communicate directly 
with elected Town leaders, allowing them to 
be, as he said, more ‘‘close, available, and re-
sponsive to our constituents.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate this oppor-
tunity to remember the life and accomplish-
ments of Supervisor Ron Moline, and I ask 
that my colleagues join me in honoring his leg-
acy and extending our condolences to his 
family and friends. 
APPRECIATING PRIME MINISTER 
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, the statement issued on change of 
governance in Israel, by Jack Rosen, Presi-
dent of American Jewish Congress, was heart-
felt on the service of Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu of Israel. ‘‘We also want to thank 
outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
for his long-time service and leadership. Mr. 
Netanyahu has greatly contributed to Israel’s 
progress, especially in strengthening the coun-
try’s security, transforming it into an economic 
powerhouse, and advancing its standing in the 
international arena. Under Prime Minister 
Netanyahu’s watch, Israel underwent an ex-
traordinary rapprochement with the Arab 
world, as attested to by the historic normaliza-
tion agreements achieved with several Arab 
countries. We wish him well.’’ 
A highlight of my service in Congress has 
been for me and my wife, Roxanne, to meet 
with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem 
and Washington. As co-chair of the Israel 
Caucus, I know firsthand of his extraordinary 
dedication for the people of Israel. 
I agree with Mr. Rosen. ‘‘We look forward to 
engaging with the new Israeli government to 
help take American-Israeli relations to new 
heights, to addressing critical regional chal-
lenges together, and to achieving sustainable 
peace and prosperity for all.’’ 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops, and 
we will never forget September 11th in the 
Global War on Terrorism.

IN HONOR OF PAUL PLOTKIN 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 100th birthday of Paul Plot-
kin. Born on June 19, 1921, in Bridgeport, 
Connecticut, Mr. Plotkin is a veteran and a 
resident of Derry, New Hampshire. During 
World War II, he answered the call of his na-
tion and joined the U.S. Army, serving with the 
66th Infantry Division in Europe. 
Mr. Plotkin endured great hardship during 
his military service. He was among the more 
than 2,000 American soldiers being trans-
ported from Southampton, England, to Cher-
bourg, France, aboard the troopship SS 
Le´opoldville when the ship was struck by a 
torpedo from a German submarine on the 
evening of December 24, 1944. 763 American 
soldiers tragically lost their lives in the initial 
blast and the resulting sinking of the ship in 
the frigid waters of the English Channel, but 
Mr. Plotkin survived and made it to France. Al-
though discussion of the Le´opoldville disaster 
was censored in the aftermath of the tragedy, 
Mr. Plotkin preserved the memory of what he 
experienced and carried it on to today. Now, 
as a member of Veterans of Foreign Wars 
Post 1617, Mr. Plotkin continues to honor the 
memory of his comrades and their sacrifice by 
supporting fellow veterans and speaking out 
about his experiences during the war. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
wish Mr. Plotkin a happy 100th birthday and 
thank him for his service to our nation. I hope 
that he has a wonderful celebration with his 
loved ones and fellow veterans. His sacrifice 
will not be forgotten.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR MIKE 
DONNELLY 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the exceptional career of 
Mayor Mike Donnelly of Double Oak, Texas. 
Mayor Donnelly’s almost two decades of serv-
ice in public office is a model of civic duty. As 
he retires following his fifth term in mayoral of-
fice, it is my distinct honor to recognize his 
service to our community. 
Since he became a resident of Double Oak 
in 2002, Mike Donnelly has served his com-
munity faithfully as a volunteer and public 
servant. He was initially elected to the Double 
Oak Town Council in 2004 and served in that 
position for three terms before running unop-
posed for his first term of Mayor in 2009. Fol-
lowing his first mayoral term, he stepped away 
to care for his mother. He was re-elected to 
the Town Council in 2012 and his council col-
leagues appointed him as Mayor Pro Tem. 
Following the death of Mayor Tom Pidcock in 
July 2012, he was appointed to fill the Mayor’s 
seat, a position to which he has been re-elect-
ed each succeeding term. During his public 
service, Mayor Donnelly has maintained a full- 
time professional career with American Air-
lines for over thirty years. 
The Town of Double Oak has prospered 
under Mayor Donnelly’s leadership. This North 
Texas municipality continues to boast one of 
the lowest income tax rates in the State of 
Texas, thanks in large part to the efficiency 
and skill of Mayor Donnelly’s administration. 
Last year, Mayor Donnelly and the Town 
Council’s successful infrastructure, police, and 
education initiatives culminated in Double Oak 
being named the ‘‘Safest City in Texas.’’ 
Mayor Donnelly’s outstanding civic achieve-
ments and personal philanthropic contributions 
are to be applauded. 
On behalf of the 26th District, I am privi-
leged to congratulate and thank Mayor Mike 
Donnelly as he steps down after a long career 
of estimable public service. Best wishes to 
Mayor Donnelly as he returns to private life. 
His positive impact on Double Oak will con-
tinue to benefit its citizens for years to come.

(OC San) Board of Directors, and his dedica-
tion and service to the residents of Orange 
County in this capacity. 
Throughout his tenure on the OC San board 
from December 2018 through June 2021, 
Chairman Shawver has remained steadfast in 
his commitment to providing an affordable 
service to the community, while understanding 
the importance of keeping with OC San’s mis-
sion of protecting the public health and the en-
vironment. 
Under his leadership, Chairman Shawver 
and the Board of Directors understood the fi-
nancial hardship COVID–19 created for many 
of our ratepayers. As a result, the Board of Di-
rectors forwent the board approved regional 
sewer service fee increase for the 2020–21 
fiscal year, keeping it at $339 for the year, 
which is less than $1 a day. 
Chairman Shawver’s commitment to afford-
able water and water use has allowed OC San 
to move in the direction to recycle 100 percent 
of its reclaimable flow through the Ground-
water Replenishment System (GWRS), a joint 
project between OC San and the Orange 
County Water District. 
Upon completion of this project in 2023, 
GWRS will produce 130 million gallons of 
high-quality water every day, which will be 
enough water for 1 million residents in north 
and central Orange County. 
As a former educator myself, I would also 
like to recognize Chairman Shawver for his 
more than 40 years of service as an educator 
in the Long Beach Unified School District, at 
Long Beach City College, and at Hope Inter-
national University in Fullerton. 
On behalf of the residents of the 47th Dis-
trict, I want to thank Chairman Shawver for his 
years of service and dedication to OC San 
and to the community he has committed him-
self to serving.

HONORING DR. ALA STANFORD AS 
A VIRTUAL GUEST FOR PRESI-
DENT 
BIDEN’S 
ADDRESS 
TO 
JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS 
HON. MARY GAY SCANLON 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Ala Stanford from Philadel-
phia, Pennsylvania. 
On Wednesday, April 28, 2021, President 
Biden delivered his first address to a Joint 
Session of Congress, 100 days into his first 
term. 
When President Biden took the oath of of-
fice, he pledged that help was on the way. 
Thanks to our work together to enact the 
American Rescue Plan, help is here. 
Hardworking people in Pennsylvania and all 
across the country have been the heroes of 
the pandemic, and now they are leading our 
recovery. Dr. Stanford is one of those heroes. 
The Black Doctors COVID–19 Consortium 
was founded by Dr. Stanford in 2020 to edu-
cate and advocate for the Black community in 
order to reduce the incidence of disease and 
death from coronavirus. 
The group originally focused on bringing 
testing to underserved communities, and now 
they also run vaccination clinics in these same 
areas. Dr. Stanford and her team are inten-
tional about targeting their resources to the 
Black community because Black Americans 
have been disproportionately impacted by the 
coronavirus and are still underrepresented in 
the number of people who have received the 
COVID–19 vaccine. 
After more than a year of having our lives 
consumed by COVID–19, I could think of no 
better person to represent our region at Presi-
dent Biden’s Joint Address to Congress than 
Dr. Stanford. When the pandemic hit, she fig-
ured out what needed to be done, and then 
she did it. She has dedicated herself to the 
work of serving her community and reducing 
racial disparities in access to testing and vac-
cines. 
In a typical year, I would have invited Dr. 
Stanford to join me in the House Chamber for 
the Joint Address. COVID–19 safety protocols 
limited this year’s in-person attendance, and 
I—along with many other Members of Con-
gress—instead watched the address from 
home. 
However, I couldn’t miss this important op-
portunity to honor Dr. Stanford and people like 
her all across Pennsylvania.

CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF JAY SIMSON 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Jay Simson, the President of The 
American Council of Engineering Companies 
of New York, on his retirement after 29 years 
of dedicated service. 
ACEC New York represents the business in-
terests of nearly 300 engineering and related 
firms in New York State. These are the com-
panies that design our built environment. With-
out them, our transportation infrastructure, our 
public buildings, private office towers, hos-
pitals, and so much more would simply not 
exist. 
Jay Simson was a leader in his industry and 
a driving force for the interests of his member 
firms in Albany and before Congress. I know 
many of my colleagues from the New York 
delegation know Jay and have worked with 
him on a wide range of issues over the years. 
What many of my colleagues might not 
know about Jay is that he is also an Olympic 
judge. He served on the U.S. Freestyle Ski 
Team board and was their delegate to the 
International Ski Federation. He was also the 
Head Judge for Freestyle Skiing at the 1998 
Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. 
I thank Jay Simson for his commitment to 
the engineering industry and congratulate him

HONORING WILIAM GILLISON 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Dr. William Gillison. 
Born in Beaufort, South Carolina, Pastor Wil-
liam Gillison attended Lackawanna, New York 
schools and enrolled in the United States 
Army in 1965. Sixteen years later—in 1981— 
Reverend Gillison became the pastor of Mount 
Olive Baptist Church. During his time at Mt. 
Olive, the church’s capacity increased tenfold, 
from 150 to 1,500. 
Early in his career, Reverend Gillison found-
ed the Mt. Olive Development Corporation, 
which continues to provide subsidized apart-
ments for low income residents. Mt. Olive also 
operates as a distribution center for food and 
other essentials in Western New York. During 
the Covid–19 pandemic, it served as a testing 
and vaccination site. Interviewed by WGRZ, 
Pastor Gillison said that ‘‘The pandemic has 
really magnified and exposed in many cases 
the deficiencies in especially black and brown 
communities.’’ Mt. Olive helped to lessen the 
racial disparities in vaccine distribution, fur-
thering its mission and serving thousands of 
local community members. 
Mt. Olive serves in every season. During the 
summer, the Church hosts a cookout and fire-
works show for families. In the fall, it provides 
Thanksgiving dinners to 1,500 families. In the 
winter, through its Angel Tree Ministry pro-
gram, it gives Christmas gifts to children of in-
carcerated men and women. Before he be-
came president, George W. Bush visited Mt. 
Olive and was impressed with its work. 
Pastor Gillison’s experience with the govern-
ment has not always been cordial. Working 
closely with attorney Johnnie Cochrane, Pas-
tor Gillison fought to overturn a ban on bus 
routes to the Galleria Mall. This discriminatory 
practice prevented many people of color from 
shopping at the Mall, and even led to the kill-
ing of a worker who was forced to walk to her 
job at the Galleria Mall. 
Pastor Gillison has served two terms as the 
President of the Baptist Ministers Conference 
and the Baptist Great Lakes Conference. He 
is the recipient of honorary doctorate degrees 
and has been recognized by national organi-
zations for his ministry and service. He is par-
ticularly known for his interfaith communica-
tion; Pastor Gillison has traveled to Israel mul-
tiple times and formed relationships with both 
government and religious officials. None of 
this would have been accomplished without 
the help of his loving and devoted wife of 58 
years, Antonia Gillison. She has been his 
greatest supporter. While being a pastor he 
has also maintained his strong fatherly pres-
ence with his children. 
Pastor Gillison has advanced our commu-
nity spiritually, politically, and economically. He 
has been a tireless advocate for those with no 
hope and no voice. His leadership has trans-
formed Mt. Olive into an indispensable beacon 
of light for our community and his work has 
touched lives across the country and world. 
During his fortieth anniversary as pastor, we 
celebrate how much Mt. Olive has accom-
plished, and we pray for the community it 
serves. Though he has accomplished much, 
Pastor Gillison is just grateful for the oppor-
tunity to serve. As he would say, ‘‘To God be 
the Glory.’’

CONGRATULATING AL ARGUELLO 
ON A CAREER OF SERVICE TO 
HIS COMMUNITY 
HON. PETE AGUILAR 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, today I 
want to honor Al Arguello, who is retiring after 
a 53-year career with Bank of America and 
will leave as President of Bank of America, In-
land Empire. 
A Rancho Cucamonga resident, Al has 
worked tirelessly throughout his career to give 
back to our community. When the great reces-
sion devastated the Inland Empire, it was Al’s 
leadership that helped form the Housing Op-
portunities Collaborative to support the thou-
sands of families facing foreclosure in our re-
gion. Al has also been a strong supporter of 
the Inland Empire’s local economy, working to 
encourage the development of micro-busi-
nesses and finding ways to help entrepreneurs 
gain access to the start-up funds they need to 
succeed. 
While he will continue to be involved as a 
key leader in our community, his friends and 
colleagues will surely miss him as he begins 
this new chapter. The lasting effects of Al 
Arguello’ s leadership and philanthropic efforts 
can be felt throughout the Inland Empire, and 
I know our community is better off because of 
Al’s decades of service.

TRIBUTE TO DONNA MARIE 
ROBINSON 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Donna Marie Rob-
inson, who passed away on May 31, 2021. 
Donna Marie was born in 1957 in Chicago 
and received both her undergraduate and 
master’s in business degrees from the Univer-
sity of Chicago. After an illustrious career in 
commercial banking, she retired in 2013 as 
Vice President/Client Manager for Bank of 
America. 
Throughout her life, Donna Marie was com-
mitted to service. She served on the San 
Diego Foundation’s Board of Governors for 
seven years and was the bedrock of the Foun-
dation’s scholarship program. The Foundation 
is establishing the Donna Marie Robinson Me-
morial Scholarship Fund in her honor. 
Donna Marie fought tirelessly for women’s 
health as a member of the Executive Leader-
ship Team for the American Heart Association 
Go Red for Women. She was President of the 
Encinitas Coastal Rotary and was a member 
of countless other community organizations. 
She was a world traveler who could bring a 
smile to every face. 
Donna Marie Robinson lived an incredible 
and full life. She was a crucial member of the 
Encinitas community and she will be missed 
by her family, friends, and everyone she 
touched.

CONGRATULATING ELLA 
SENSENIG 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank and congratulate Ella Sensenig 
of Millersville, who, at 85, has recently retired 
as a school bus driver for Penn Manor School 
District after 41 years of dedicated and safe 
service. 
Those 41 years must have added up to 
countless miles, but each trip presented the 
children on her school bus the opportunity to 
learn, grow, and thrive. She started in a part- 
time position, driving students to sports activi-
ties or to the Lancaster Career & Technology 
Center Campuses before she started serving 
two generations of students at Central Manor 
Elementary as passengers on her bus for over 
20 years. 
Ella also drove the bus for her church’s 
Bible School program for many years. She 
also served as a crossing guard, as a part- 
time police officer with Millersville, and as a 
nurse’s aide throughout her career. 
In a recent interview, Ella said: ‘‘Not a lot of 
people can say this, but there are no jobs I 
had that I didn’t like.’’ As she looks forward to 
retirement, she’s looking forward to spending 
time with her family: two children, five grand-
children, and 13 great-grandchildren. 
I thank Ella for her many years of service to 
students and I congratulate her on her retire-
ment.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS AND DEDICATION OF THE 
BUFFALO BLUES ORGANIZATION 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary 
accomplishments of the Western New York- 
based non-profit organization known as ‘‘Buf-
falo Blues’’ and their remarkable service and 
dedication to the Veteran community. 
Buffalo Blues is a non-profit dedicated to 
using the power and reach of music to help 
Western New York Veterans and military fami-
lies through fundraising and charitable dona-
tions. Founded by Bob James, Buffalo Blues 
forms an impactful partnership between the 
music community and Veteran groups. Musi-
cians that partner with Buffalo Blues experi-
ence professional growth while also helping to 
raise funds and advocating for the needs of 
the Veteran community. 
On May 6, 2021, Buffalo Blues announced 
that—with the help of over 200 musicians— 
they were able to donate over $100,000 to 18 
Erie County charities serving WNY Veterans 
and military families. Through live musical per-
formances, merchandise sales, and online 
livestreamed concerts, these 200 musicians 
used their talents to both raise funds for these 
local charities and bring attention to the issues 
that often face the Veteran community. 
In addition to raising funds, Buffalo Blues 
has been gathering data on the needs of Vet-
erans and Military Families. This research 
helps to ensure that the money they raise 
goes to where it is most needed in the veteran 
community. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic shuttered 
opportunities for live, in-person performances, 
Buffalo Blues adapted with the changing 
times. Knowing that the difficulties that Vet-
erans and military families face weren’t going 
anywhere, they found an innovative solution 
by livestreaming musical performances online 
until it was safe to return to the stages of 
Western New York. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate this oppor-
tunity to speak today, and ask that my col-
leagues join me in recognizing the persistence 
and dedication of Buffalo Blues and their affili-
ated musicians. Their continual advocacy for

RECOGNIZING STEVE 
ANTONOPULOS 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the hard work and dedication of 
Steve ‘‘Greek’’ Antonopulos who announced 
that he will be retiring after 45 seasons with 
the Denver Broncos. Mr. Antonopulos is the 
only individual to have worked for the Broncos 
during all eight of their Super Bowl appear-
ances, as well as under three owners, and ten 
head coaches. 
From Hugo, Colorado, Mr. Antonopulos 
grew up watching Broncos games with his fa-
ther. After graduating from the University of 
Northern Colorado, he worked as the head 
trainer at Fort Hays State University in Kan-
sas, and in 1976, he joined the Broncos as an 
assistant trainer. Mr. Antonopulos ends his ca-
reer with the team as the director of sports 
medicine, a position he has held since 2016. 
Throughout his time with the team, he treated 
983 players and worked a total of 941 games. 
The dedication that Mr. Antonopulos has 
shown in his many years with the Broncos has 
undoubtedly been instrumental to the team 
and benefitted Broncos fans across Colorado 
and beyond. 
On behalf of the 4th District of Colorado, I 
extend my best wishes to Mr. Antonopulos 
and his family. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to recognize Steve Antonopulos for his accom-
plishments.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
WARRIOR 
RUN, 
PENNSYLVANIA 
ON 
ITS 
125TH ANNIVERSARY OF INCOR-
PORATION 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Borough of Warrior 
Run, Pennsylvania on its 125th anniversary. 
Warrior Run was incorporated on January 25, 
1895 after it split with neighboring mining vil-
lage, Sugar Notch. The occasion will be 
marked by a festival and parade in late July 
after a year-long delay due to the pandemic. 
The hills and valleys of Warrior Run were 
once densely forested Native American hunt-
ing grounds, inhabited by the Delaware, the 
Shawnee, 
and 
the 
Nanticokes. 
The 
Nattanhutter Path, a trail across the land to a 
gap in the mountains, became known as War-
rior’s Path, and the nearby spring was called 
Warrior Run or Warrior Spring. In 1778, more 
than one hundred men, women, and children 
followed the trail to safety in the aftermath of 
the Battle of Wyoming. 
In 1791, Connecticut Yankees Elisha and 
Anna Blackman and their children were the 
first settlers on the land that would become 
Warrior Run. For generations, the Blackman 
family cultivated the land on the site of the 
original 
homestead 
and 
witnessed 
the 
changes brought by time, industry, and immi-
gration. 
As 
the 
American 
Industrial 
Revolution 
boomed, the formerly agrarian community saw 
the rise of anthracite coal mining. In 1864, the 
Warrior Run Mining Company opened the Hol-
land and Hillman mine and, by 1867, con-
structed a breaker at the foot of the mountain 
to sort coal. With regional railroads completing 
lines that ran through the area, the coal indus-
try thrived, and the demand for workers in-
creased, attracting immigrants from Europe. 
Coal mining was dangerous work, so Warrior 
Run miners joined the United Mine Workers to 
seek fairer wages and a shorter workday, and 
they participated in the successful 1902 An-
thracite Coal Strike. Mining continued to be 
the dominant industry well into the 20th cen-
tury until its decline in the 1950s. 
Despite the challenges of life in the shad-
ows of the culm banks, there was evidence of 
prosperity and growth. Electric streetcars con-
nected nearby towns and villages to the City 
of Wilkes-Barre, and the Borough was home 
to many local businesses and establishments. 
Sport thrived in Warrior Run and brought the 
community together. The Warrior Run Indians 
was one of the region’s leading baseball 
teams; the local football team was the 
undefeated league champion in 1929; and 
basketball was a popular sport at the local 
high school. 
As the century marched on, the citizens of 
Warrior Run continued to foster a deep sense 
of community. They joined local social and 
charitable organizations to support their fellow 
residents and celebrate their heritage. Resi-
dents gathered at local bazaars and at events 
hosted by the American Legion, the Fireman’s 
Association, and the Little League, which fea-
tured ethnic food and music. They marched 
through the streets each Memorial Day to 
honor those who served our country, and they 
visited the popular Sans Souci Amusement 
Park. 
Through periods of prosperity and hardship, 
Warrior Run has remained a resilient and vi-
brant community, and I am honored to join 
Mayor Tom Shypulefski and all the residents 
as they celebrate the Borough’s 125th anni-
versary.

HONORING CAPTAIN MIGUEL PEKO 
UPON 35 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a true Samoan warrior, 
Captain Miguel L. Peko, who will retire later 
this year from the United States Navy after a 
remarkable 35-year career as a Midshipman 
and Aviator. 
In American Samoa, military service is more 
than just a job—it is a calling to serve not only 
our country, but our fellow countrymen. Con-
tributing to the defense of this great nation day 
in and day out is a singular honor, and I am 
proud to represent a place that so values this 
service that it is continually recognized as one 
of the top recruiting stations anywhere in 
America for the U.S. military. 
Few people know more about that kind of 
honor through service and duty than Captain 
Peko. This son of Utulei and Fagatogo flew 
combat missions in support of Fleet and Joint 
Operational commanders, coordinated mari-
time homeland defense efforts across the uni-
fied combatant commands, and had a direct 
impact on the formation of senior military lead-
ers during his most recent post as Director of 
the Joint Advanced Warfighting School. 
Captain Peko’s career has garnered numer-
ous decorations for excellence and leadership, 
including a Legion of Merit, four Air Medals, a 
Meritorious Service Medal, and a Joint Com-
mendation Medal. 
Finally, I would also like to recognize those 
who stood with him in these years, Captain 
Peko’s family. Behind this successful military 
career is a wife who went months without her 
husband, daughters who spent hours of their 
young lives speaking to their father through a 
phone or on a video screen, and worried par-
ents who prayed daily for their son’s safety. 
I thank Mrs. Kerrith Ann Peko and daugh-
ters Brenna and Alyssa, for their patience and 
for all the sacrifices that they have made over 
the past years. I congratulate Lolesio and Be-
linda Peko on the immense pride that they 
must feel for their son’s exemplary service. 
God bless Captain Peko.

HONORING 100 YEARS OF WOMEN 
AT WILLIAM JEWELL COLLEGE 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to commemorate the 100-year 
anniversary of female admittance into William 
Jewell College. Through its history, the pro-
gressive institution has prioritized individual 
expression and creative thinking. Today, Wil-
liam Jewell is recognized for producing inno-
vative thought-leaders making an impact in 
Missouri communities and beyond. 
Founded in 1849 in Liberty, Missouri, Wil-
liam Jewell College prides itself in fostering an 
environment for students of diverse back-
grounds to thrive. Jewell holds true to its 
founding vision as an institution that develops 
high-achieving leaders who shape a changing 
world. After four-years, Jewell graduates leave 
with an arsenal of knowledge, creativity, and 
fundamental leadership skills. 
Since the 1920–1921 academic school year, 
William Jewell has encouraged women to pur-
sue a co-education at the same level as men. 
More than 12,000 women have walked the 
halls of William Jewell in pursuit of a world 
class education. Not only does this milestone 
recognize the talented pool of William Jewell 
alumna, but the future female leaders eager to 
follow in their footsteps. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in recognizing 100 Years of Women at 
William Jewell College. William Jewell’s cen-
tury-long investment in women is reflected in 
the people of Missouri’s Sixth Congressional 
District’s commitment to educational pros-
perity.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER 
KANSAS 
ATTORNEY 
GENERAL 
VERN MILLER 
HON. RON ESTES 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the legacy of a quintessential Kansas 
lawman, Vern Miller, who passed away at the 
age of 92. Mr. Miller’s career in law enforce-
ment spanned over 50 years with terms as 
Sedgwick County Sheriff, Sedgwick County 
District Attorney, and Kansas State Attorney 
General. 
A U.S. army veteran born and raised in 
Wichita, Mr. Miller’s career in law enforcement 
began in 1948 when he started as a deputy 
for the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office, even-
tually serving three terms as Sheriff of Sedg-
wick County. 
While serving as Sheriff, Mr. Miller drove the 
155 miles to Oklahoma City University to at-
tend night classes, earning his law degree in 
1966. After passing the bar exam, Mr. Miller 
was elected as Kansas Attorney General in 
1970 and again in 1972, winning all 105 coun-
ties in the state. As Attorney General, Mr. Mil-
ler vigorously enforced the laws of Kansas, fo-
cusing on drug rings and illegal gambling car-
tels throughout the state. 
Mr. Miller was a dedicated public servant 
whose work ethic and devotion to the law and 
to his fellow Kansans will be deeply missed. 
My heartfelt condolences go out to his family 
during this most difficult time.

CONGRATULATING KATORI HALL 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Memphis playwright, Katori 
Hall, who was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for 
Drama on Friday for her play ‘‘The Hot Wing 
King,’’ which is set in a kitchen in Memphis. 
Ms. Hall won the prestigious national recogni-
tion as a nominee for a Tony Award for ‘‘Tina: 
The Tina Turner Musical,’’ a Broadway musi-
cal about the singer from Nutbush, Ten-
nessee. In its citation, the Pulitzer Board ‘‘The 
Hot Wing King’’ a ‘‘funny, deeply felt consider-
ation of Black masculinity and how it is per-
ceived, filtered through the experiences of a 
loving gay couple and their extended family as 
they prepare for a culinary competition.’’ Ms. 
Hall, a graduate of Craigmont High School, 
first gained national acclaim for her 2006 play 
‘‘The Mountaintop,’’ set in Room 306 of the 
Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. spent his last night in 1968. 
That play, which debuted in London, won the 
Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. 
Hall is the creator of the cable television 
blockbuster ‘‘P-Valley,’’ set in a Mississippi 
Delta strip club. I wish her well in what is al-
ready a very promising career. 
TRIBUTE TO ROSELEE NICHOLS 
ROBERTS 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to my good friend and 
former House staff member Roselee Roberts, 
who passed away on April 22, 2020 in 
McDaniel, MD, on Maryland’s Eastern shore. 
Roselee was a tireless advocate for America’s 
space program and she will be deeply missed 
by many. 
Roselee was born on April 24, 1942 in Balti-
more, Maryland. After high school, she at-
tended the University of Miami in 1960 and 
graduated with honors and a degree in math 
and economics in 1964. While in college, 
Roselee ran the campus speaker’s bureau, 
where she met her future husband, William 
‘‘Art’’ Roberts. After graduating, she was re-
cruited and hired into a management position 
with AT&T’s Southern Bell Co. at their Jack-
sonville, Florida office. About a year later, she 
and Art wed and moved to Reston, Virginia. A 
few years later, Roselee was selected to serve 
as a Junior Economist on President Lyndon 
Johnson’s Council of Economic Advisers. 
Following positions with the Office of Man-
agement and Budget and as Rep. Bill Nel-
son’s (D-Florida) chief aide on the House 
Budget Committee, Roselee launched her 
space career by serving as a staff member on 
the House Science and Technology Commit-
tee’s Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee. 
In 1985, she left Capitol Hill for a position in 
the McDonnell Douglas legislative affairs of-
fice, which later merged with the Boeing Cor-
poration. In that era, the space and aero-
nautics industry was predominantly comprised 
of men with military backgrounds. To support 
and 
encourage 
women 
in 
the 
industry, 
Roselee helped establish Women in Aero-
space. The group now includes more than 
2,000 individual and corporate members. 
In 2005, I was truly blessed to have 
Roselee head back to the House and serve as 
the staff director for the House Space and 
Aeronautics Subcommittee while I held the 
gavel as Chairman. With the space shuttle 
program and International Space Station fac-
ing significant challenges, the space industry 
was at an inflection point at that time. Thanks 
in large part to Roselee’s determination and 
leadership, we were able to successfully pass 
and have a NASA authorization bill signed into 
law for the first time in five years. After serving 
in the House again, Roselee moved over to 
NASA headquarters for her final government 
post as the Special Assistant to the agency’s 
Deputy Administrator. 
Roselee is survived by her husband, Art, of 
54 years; their children, Elizabeth (Libby) Rob-
erts Holah and husband, Greg; and grand-
daughters Olivia Holah and Violet Holah, and 
Leigh Roberts Melton and husband, John; 
granddaughter Harper Melton and grandson 
Hunter Melton. I extend my heartfelt condo-

REMEMBERING 
NIKHIL 
BADLANI 
FOR 
HIS 
TALENTS, 
PASSIONS, 
KINDNESS, AND LASTING MEM-
ORY IN NEW JERSEY’S 11TH CON-
GRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Nikhil Badlani, a talented and com-
passionate 11-year old boy from West Or-
ange, NJ whose enthusiasm and laughter 
brought joy to all who met him. 
Nikhil was an excellent student. He received 
straight A’s and had an advanced under-
standing of science and math. From the time 
he was three years old, Nikhil knew all there 
was to know about dinosaurs and he brought 
his passion and curiosity for understanding the 
world into the classroom. 
Beyond his studies, Nikhil was a talented 
musician and at the age of 11 he was already 
excelling at both the piano and trumpet. His 
talent was undeniable and he was accepted to 
play trumpet with the Youth Orchestras of 
Essex County. Nikhil also loved the theater 
and he was a captivating actor. 
It is impossible to fathom that on June 11, 
2011 Nikhil was tragically killed when a dis-
tracted driver failed to stop at a stop sign. 
Nikhil is fondly remembered by his friends and 
family for his talent, energy, and kindness. 
Nikhil’s life inspired his family to create the 
Nikhil Badlani Foundation in his honor, which 
provides lessons for musicians, scholarships 
for graduating seniors and brings traffic safety 
awareness and advocacy to our community. 
In the years since his passing, community 
members have come together to celebrate his 
life and promote traffic safety in his honor. As 
this year marks ten years since that tragic 
day, South Orange Township will commemo-
rate this milestone with a moment of silence at 
the crash site before unveiling its new name, 
‘‘Nikhil’s Way.’’ Nikhil will never be forgotten.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CARE 
ECONOMY AND IMPORTANCE OF 
SUPPORTING HOME AND COMMU-
NITY-BASED SERVICES 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 15, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the importance of the care 
economy and the need for significant invest-
ment in home and community-based services 
to meet the needs of seniors, people with dis-
abilities, and caregivers who serve them. 
The vast majority of America’s seniors and 
people with disabilities prefer to receive long- 
term services and supports in the home or in 
the community. However, there are currently 
significant roadblocks to quality, accessible 
home and community-based services. Many 
HCBS are provided through Medicaid, which 
has restrictive eligibility criteria and often has 
long waitlists for these services. Additionally, 
the direct care workforce that provides HCBS 
face low pay and few if any benefits, resulting 
in high turnover that impacts the services they

provide. As a result, far too many Americans 
are unable to access to quality, affordable 
home and community-based services. While 
the American Rescue Plan provided important 
resources for Medicaid HCBS to meet the im-
mediate needs of the pandemic, more com-
prehensive reforms are needed to ensure that 
all Americans can live with dignity in the set-
ting of their choosing. 
The Biden American Jobs Plan will help 
meet this need by providing $400 billion for 
quality home and community-based services 
for seniors and people with disabilities. This 
investment will transform the care economy by 
investing in the HCBS workforce, allowing 
them to receive pay and benefits commensu-
rate with the work they provide. It will allow 
seniors and people with disabilities to receive 
the high-quality care they need in the setting 
of their choosing. More importantly, it will pro-
vide dignity for all who participate in the care 
economy. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan and this historic investment in 
the care economy.
