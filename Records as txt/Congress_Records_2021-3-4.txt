AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as the 
Senate prepares to take up the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan today, I want to re-
mind everyone why we are here. This 
country is in the midst of a once-in-a- 
century crisis—not once in a decade, 
not once in every 50 years—once in a 
century. 
It is a crisis that is still very much 
with us, and it is deadly—deadly—seri-
ous. It has claimed more than 515,000 
precious lives across every part of the 
Nation. 
For the better part of the calendar 
year, businesses have had to close their 
doors and entire industries teetered on 
the brink of collapse. The economy has 
lost 10 million jobs since this time last 
year. Millions of Americans are thou-
sands of dollars behind on the rent and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1038 
March 4, 2021 
on the utilities. Folks are facing evic-
tion. American families have had their 
water shut off, their heat shut off in 
the depth of winter, and the power cut 
during their kids’ first days of virtual 
kindergarten. 
Even as the vaccine is quickly mak-
ing its way into Americans’ arms now 
that President Biden has taken the 
helm, tens of thousands of Americans 
continue to get sick every week, and 
we are racing against the clock to de-
feat the pandemic and to save Amer-
ican lives. 
Now, Congress has come together on 
several occasions to pass emergency re-
lief in this time of extraordinary crisis. 
In each case, we saw our economy re-
cover, briefly, before worrying trends 
took hold again, showing the depth of 
the economic crisis. It is not going to 
be quick and easy to get out of. 
After the CARES bill passed, our 
economy 
stabilized 
before 
dipping 
deeply again in the summer. After we 
passed another emergency bill in De-
cember, the January numbers looked 
positive before once again slipping in 
recent weeks. Trusted economists— 
Treasury Secretary Yellen and Federal 
Chair Powell, both cautious, careful 
people—are telling us, plain as day, 
that the economy is not yet ready to 
stand on its own; that our recovery is 
deeply uncertain; that the risk of doing 
little is far greater than doing too 
much. 
We have also arrived at this moment, 
about to take up the American Rescue 
Plan, because we remember what hap-
pened the last time our country faced a 
significant economic downturn. Con-
gress was too limited and constrained 
in its response to the financial crisis in 
2008 and 2009, and, as a result, the coun-
try suffered a long, slow, painful recov-
ery—a lost decade for many American 
families, creating anger, pessimism, a 
sourness in the land that discombobu-
lated our politics. 
We are not going to make those same 
mistakes again. We are not going to 
condemn millions of working Ameri-
cans to another lost decade of tepid re-
covery. We are not going to abdicate 
our responsibility to help the American 
people just because we have started to 
see the first hint that things aren’t as 
bad as during the very worst days of 
the pandemic. 
Our 
mission—our 
mission—is 
to 
crush the virus now, get our country 
back to normal, lay the foundation for 
our economy to come roaring back— 
roaring back. 
That is what the American Rescue 
Plan is designed to do, and the entire 
country has gotten behind it. Hundreds 
of the Nation’s top business leaders 
support the plan. More than 400 mayors 
and local leaders from both parties— 
Democrat and Republican—support the 
plan. The American people support the 
plan, including a clear majority of 
Democrats, Independents, Republicans. 
It seems the only group that opposes 
the bill are Republicans here in Wash-
ington, and it is confounding. When 
Donald Trump was President, they 
were willing to vote for a total of over 
$3 trillion in aid. Now that President 
Biden is President and the economy is 
in the same pickle, generally speaking, 
they don’t want to vote for a nickel. I 
wonder why. I wonder why. 
And I have to say, a few of my Repub-
lican colleagues are going to some 
pretty ridiculous lengths to showcase 
their opposition to a bill The Econo-
mist has called ‘‘one of the most pop-
ular bills in decades,’’ a bill supported 
by a majority—a majority—of Repub-
lican voters, not Republican Senators, 
but voters. 
Yesterday, the Republican Senator 
from Wisconsin—the same Senator who 
last summer proudly declared he would 
oppose even a dime more in COVID re-
lief, the same Senator who spent a Sen-
ate hearing on Capitol security reading 
conspiracy theories into the RECORD 
and saying that January 6 wasn’t an 
armed insurrection—decided to make 
himself the face of the Republican op-
position to the bill by vowing to force 
the reading of the Senate amendment 
to the American Rescue Plan, in full, 
before we can proceed with the bill. 
We all know this will merely delay 
the inevitable. It will accomplish little 
more than a few sore throats for the 
Senate clerks who work very hard, day 
in and day out, to help the Senate 
function. And I want to thank our 
clerks profoundly for the work they do 
every day, including the arduous task 
ahead of them. 
Still, we are delighted that the Sen-
ator from Wisconsin wants to give the 
American people another opportunity 
to hear what is in the American Rescue 
Plan. We Democrats want America to 
hear what is in the plan. And if the 
Senator from Wisconsin wants the 
clerks to read it, let everybody listen 
because it has overwhelming support. 
We want them to hear about the direct 
checks they will get, as promised, to 
help them keep up with the cost of gro-
ceries, medicine, and the rent; about 
funding to expand testing and support 
the vaccine; about the resources for 
schools to reopen quickly and as safely 
as possible; about the money to keep 
firefighters, teachers, busdrivers, and 
first responders on the job; about the 
dollars to provide rental assistance to 
keep Americans in their homes; about 
the help for the hardest hit small busi-
nesses to hang on until brighter days 
return. 
Oh, yes, when the clerks read, the 
American 
people 
will 
get 
another 
chance to hear about the tax breaks for 
low-income workers and assistance for 
American 
families 
struggling 
with 
childcare—two 
measures 
that 
help 
make the American Rescue Plan one of 
the single largest anti-poverty bills in 
recent history. 
And then, once the American people 
have heard all over again about the 
provisions that make this bill so pop-
ular, about the support that is going to 
lift the country out of the crisis, pro-
vide millions of vaccines in people’s 
arms, and set it on a path to strong re-
covery, the Senate is going to move 
forward with the bill. 
No matter how long it takes, the 
Senate is going to stay in session to 
finish the bill this week. The American 
people deserve nothing less. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
KENTUCKY FLOODING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, ear-
lier this week, I described the terrible 
flooding across my home State of Ken-
tucky. Rivers reached historic levels. 
Whole communities are still under-
water. 
Yesterday, my staff and I spoke with 
leaders in some of our hardest hit 
counties. The Estill County judge exec-
utive told me that he personally joined 
crews to help families escape danger. 
Small business owners in Lee County, 
who survived one COVID obstacle after 
another, now saw their life’s work lit-
erally washed away. The situation in 
Powell County is so dire that at least 
one city can only be accessed by boat. 
Road crews, first responders, and the 
Kentucky National Guard are doing 
their best to help out, but they can’t 
get a handle on the full scope of the 
damage until the water recedes. 
Once the assessment is complete, the 
Governor will formally request an 
emergency disaster declaration from 
the Biden administration. As soon as 
he does, my team and I will do our part 
to get Federal assistance to these com-
munities as soon as possible. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
a completely different matter, yester-
day, our Democratic colleagues had 
planned to begin ramming through 
their partisan spending spree, but it 
seems they have had some difficulty 
getting to the starting line. After all, 
Senate 
Democrats, 
including 
com-
mittee chairs, are essentially being 
jammed with text from over in the 
House. Their own Members have barely 
been able to read this thing, let alone 
shape it. 
So let’s think back to where we were 
1 year ago. Eleven-and-a-half months

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1039 
March 4, 2021 
ago, the Senate was also discussing a 
major spending package. In fact, it was 
the same size as what is being proposed 
right now—about $2 trillion—an appro-
priate pricetag back at the start of the 
crisis, but that is where the similarity 
actually ends. 
Last March, the Senate was working 
overtime, in a bipartisan fashion, to 
craft good policy from the bottom up. I 
assembled bipartisan task forces. We 
had Republicans and Democrats and 
staff working around the clock to build 
the policies that would save our health 
system and our economy. 
The CARES Act sustained us for al-
most a year of shutdowns. It funded the 
healthcare fight, saved small busi-
nesses, and funded Operation Warp 
Speed, which helped pave the way for 
these 
pioneering 
vaccines 
and 
preordered hundreds of millions of 
doses for Americans. The law sent so 
much relief to households that, even as 
the GDP declined, personal incomes 
and savings actually went up. Even lib-
eral economists say President Biden 
has inherited an economy that was al-
ready primed for a swift recovery. It 
was the largest American rescue pack-
age ever. Yet it passed the Senate 
without one single dissenting vote be-
cause it was built the right way. 
That was last March. So what about 
today? 
Instead of heading into a dark tun-
nel, we are accelerating out of it: in-
credible vaccines, a rebounding econ-
omy. That is what the Biden adminis-
tration inherited thanks to what we 
did last year. 
Yet Washington Democrats are try-
ing to exploit the last chapters of this 
crisis to pass what President Biden’s 
Chief of Staff calls ‘‘the most progres-
sive domestic legislation in a genera-
tion,’’ and they have told Republicans: 
Take it or leave it. No openness to 
meaningful bipartisan input. Ten Re-
publican Senators approached Presi-
dent Biden and proposed cooperation 
on the order of hundreds of billions of 
dollars. They were refused. All that in-
terested the Democrats was a partisan 
hodgepodge of, largely, non-COVID-re-
lated items. 
Last year, the Democratic leader 
said: 
Sitting in your own office, writing a bill, 
and then demanding the other side support it 
is not anyone’s idea of bipartisanship. 
As recently as last November, he 
said: 
We need a true bipartisan bill—not ‘‘this is 
our bill, take it or leave it.’’ 
Another time, our friend from New 
York told everyone to ‘‘go look up in 
the dictionary what ‘bipartisanship’ is. 
It’s both parties working together, not 
your party doing a bill and then saying 
it’s bipartisan.’’ 
In less than 4 months, we have had 
two completely different versions of 
the Democratic leader. The two of 
them could have a fascinating debate 
with each other. 
But look, the real tragedy here is not 
Senate process; it is how ill-suited this 
bill is to what Americans need right 
now. There are no policies to get 
schools reopened right away and no 
smart solutions to directly spur rehir-
ing. Less than 1 percent of the money 
goes to the vaccines that will end this 
nightmare—only 9 percent to the en-
tire healthcare fight altogether. 
I guess it has become a rite of pas-
sage for a new Democratic President to 
begin with a poorly targeted spending 
spree that doesn’t give Americans what 
they need. 
We already laid the foundation for a 
roaring comeback. The Biden adminis-
tration inherited a tide that was al-
ready turning, but they have chosen to 
ignore the approach that got us this 
far. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
now, on one final matter, yesterday 
evening, House Democrats repassed 
their plan to give Washington unprece-
dented power over the way our Nation 
conducts elections. Just like their par-
tisan spending spree from last week, 
the only thing bipartisan about the 
vote was the opposition. 
The same party that wants to change 
Senate rules when they lose a vote, 
pack the Supreme Court when they 
lose a case, and throw out the electoral 
college every time they lose the White 
House now wants to forcibly rewrite 50 
States’ election laws from Washington. 
It is unprincipled. It is unwarranted. 
Large portions of it may well be uncon-
stitutional. One of the key principles of 
American elections is that Federal of-
ficeholders cannot personally micro-
manage the way in which voters can 
hire and fire us. 
Different States and localities settle 
questions around early voting or absen-
tee voting or voter registration in very 
different ways. Washington Democrats 
want every county in America to have 
to answer all of those questions the 
way they want. For example, no State 
would be able to have a simple voter ID 
requirement unless they neutered it 
with a massive loophole, but every 
State would be forced to allow ballot 
harvesting, 
where 
paid 
political 
operatives can show up, carrying a 
stack of ballots with other people’s 
names on them. 
Imagine looking at this national 
landscape, where we have seen the los-
ing side doubt the legitimacy of two 
consecutive Presidential elections, and 
thinking: This is the time for a sweep-
ing, one-party rewrite of election law. 
Democrats are also coming after 
Americans’ free speech. The Federal 
Election Commission was set up after 
Watergate to be a bipartisan panel by 
design. The FEC intentionally needs bi-
partisan consensus to throw a penalty 
flag. Washington Democrats want to 
scrap that as well. 
Their bill would convert the FEC 
into an odd-numbered, partisan body, 
and this partisan FEC would get even 
greater scope to nose around in even 
more of Americans’ speech and Ameri-
cans’ activities. The bill also tramples 
on citizens’ privacy with new mandates 
that would intensify ‘‘cancel culture’’ 
and help mobs harass people for their 
private views. Even the leftwing ACLU 
condemns this part of H.R. 1. 
This is what the ACLU had to say: 
It could directly interfere with the ability 
of many to engage in political speech about 
causes that they care about and that impact 
their lives. 
That was from the ACLU. 
That is right. House Democrats have 
swung so far to the anti-free speech left 
that they have even lost the ACLU. 
Speaking of political swings, Demo-
crats who want Washington to take 
over elections should remember that 
majorities in Congress actually come 
and go. It would be absurd for election 
regulations in every precinct in Amer-
ica to go boomeranging back and forth 
every time Congress changes hands. 
Millions of American voters elected 50 
Republican Senators and a whole lot of 
House Republicans to make sure that 
Democrats play by the rules, not re-
write the rules. For one party to seize 
unilateral control over elections na-
tionwide would be a civic catastrophe. 
It is worth asking: Why are Wash-
ington Democrats so desperate to forc-
ibly rewrite election law before the 
next time voters decide their fates?

f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, some of 
our Republican colleagues say that 
America doesn’t need President Biden’s 
COVID rescue plan because ‘‘the pan-
demic is nearly over.’’ Funny. I have 
never heard them say we shouldn’t 
spend money to help tornado victims in 
their States after the tornadoes were 
gone. 
Let me say it clearly. We are not out 
of the woods yet. I wish we were. There 
are 510,000 Americans—maybe more 
now—who have died. The United States 
has 5 percent of the world’s population. 
We have 20 percent of the COVID infec-
tions and deaths. Why? Because of poor 
leadership during the first year of this 
pandemic. 
We had a President then, who is now 
gone, who would announce it was a 
hoax, and it was going to disappear by 
Easter, downplaying the seriousness of 
the situation with his fanciful flights 
about certain chemicals that were 
going to save us or whether or not we 
should all be gargling Lysol every 
morning. It made no sense, and the 
American people came out of that ex-
perience confused and infected, with 
deaths in their families. That was the 
reality of the first year of the pan-
demic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1040 
March 4, 2021 
There 
was 
also 
another 
reality, 
which the Republican leader just al-
luded to in that, 12 months ago, we 
passed something called the CARES 
Act. It was historic—the largest Fed-
eral expenditure in the history of the 
United States of America. Who de-
signed that bill? Well, it was Treasury 
Secretary Mnuchin, whom I didn’t 
know well but who, apparently, had 
some skill as a negotiator because he 
managed to not only speak for Presi-
dent Trump but to negotiate a bipar-
tisan package in March of last year, 
called the CARES Act, for $2 trillion. It 
came to the floor of the Senate, with a 
vote of 96 to nothing. Every Democrat 
voted for the COVID rescue plan of the 
Trump administration a year ago— 
every Democrat. 
The second major bill occurred in De-
cember, that of $900 billion, designed to 
help us through the first 3 months of 
this year—again, with Treasury Sec-
retary Mnuchin at the table on behalf 
of President Trump, negotiating with 
Democrats and Republicans. It came to 
the floor of the Senate, and, this time, 
there were 92 votes in favor of it, in-
cluding every Democrat, and 6 Repub-
licans voted no. 
So, you see, when it came to COVID 
rescue plans under the Trump adminis-
tration, the Republicans were happy to 
ask us to join them, and we did. Oh, 
some people said we were giving them 
a political advantage here or there or 
the other place, but those arguments 
didn’t prevail on the Democratic side. 
The Nation came first. The pandemic 
came first. Unemployed people and 
businesses that were struggling came 
first, and we voted that way. 
Then came a new President: Joe 
Biden, elected November 3, despite the 
denial of some. It was a reality. He 
took this pandemic and faced it square-
ly—no excuses about hoaxes or ‘‘it is 
going to go away’’ or ‘‘I have got a fa-
vorite 
chemical 
that 
will 
save 
everybody’s life.’’ He faced it squarely. 
He accepted the responsibility, as 
President of the United States, to tell 
the American people the truth. 
The first thing he told them was that 
we cannot, we should not, stop in our 
efforts to end this pandemic and put 
America back on its feet. So he made a 
proposal, a proposal with at least $160 
billion in it, for buying vaccines, ad-
ministering those vaccines, and distrib-
uting them across the United States. I 
would think that everybody would 
agree with that as a starting point. It 
wasn’t the end point. 
As for the cash payment promised by 
the Trump administration and agreed 
to by most Democrats, he wanted to 
keep his word on that—$1,400 more for 
families all across America. 
He talked about State and local aid. 
I can tell you that this is more than a 
theoretical exercise in my State of Illi-
nois. We need help. The expenses of 
COVID–19 and the lost revenue by our 
shrunken economy have taken their 
toll in my State and in the cities 
across the State. 
I just got off a Zoom call with a 
dozen small towns in Illinois. They are 
all down from my neck of the woods. 
They are great folks, doing their best, 
struggling under COVID–19. 
They asked me: Are you going to 
send us any help? 
I said: President Biden has made his 
American rescue proposal. If we can 
pass it, help is on the way. 
Assistance won’t just go to Spring-
field, our State capital, or to Chicago, 
which does need help, but to cities 
across our State and across our Nation. 
That is included in this bill too. Help 
for our schools is included in this bill 
too. The list goes on, and it is an im-
portant list because it really highlights 
the priorities of recovery in the United 
States. 
President Biden and all of us heard 
the news a day or two ago when the 
Governors of Texas and Mississippi, in 
full-throated denial of the reality of 
this pandemic, basically took off all 
the limitations on businesses and on 
individuals. No more mask require-
ments. Let’s open up everything all the 
way. The President was right. That was 
not a smart choice. It was not a wise 
choice. We are up against it, and we 
have to remain united in our effort to 
defeat this coronavirus. 
So this week, in a day or two, Presi-
dent Biden’s American Rescue Plan 
will come to the floor. Will we have an-
other bipartisan rollcall, 96 to nothing, 
92 to 6? I am afraid not. As of this mo-
ment, and I hope it changes, no single 
Republican Senator has expressed an 
interest in voting for this bill. Not one. 
I hope it changes, and it could. Some 
Senators at the last minute, I think, 
will realize this is the right way to go. 
Meanwhile, the Republican leader 
comes to the floor every day and 
mocks this plan—a Democratic wish 
list, a liberal wish list, NANCY PELOSI’s 
wish list. This is the American people’s 
wish list. Eighty percent of the Amer-
ican people support what President 
Biden is trying to do, and the leading 
economists have told us we have to do 
this. If we don’t inject money into this 
economy to restore its energy and fu-
ture, we will pay for it not just for 
months to come but far beyond. 
It is a situation that every parent 
knows, when they go to the doctor, to 
the pediatrician, with their little boy 
or little girl with an earache, and he 
says: I am going to give you some anti-
biotics. Now, this is a 5-day prescrip-
tion. This little boy is going to start 
feeling better on the second day, and 
by the third day, he is going to be play-
ing as usual. You are going to think, 
well, he doesn’t need the rest of these 
antibiotics. Don’t make that decision. 
Keep giving him the full dose of medi-
cine to get well completely, or he may 
lapse back into it again and get sick all 
over again. 
So you stick with it even when your 
little boy is running rings around you 
or the little girl is getting ready to get 
on her tricycle, because that is what 
the doctor said, and that was the right 
thing to do. 
That is the same thing with this. If 
we accept the Republican argument 
that this pandemic is really over; if we 
accept the argument of the Governor of 
Texas—that was yesterday; we don’t 
have to worry about it tomorrow; if we 
take that approach, we could have a 
disastrous result. We could be back in 
trouble again in just a few weeks. 
I hope we don’t. I hope we come to-
gether in the Senate, preferably on a 
bipartisan basis, and help the President 
get us through this pandemic. This is 
our chance. We have no greater respon-
sibility than to put an end to this pan-
demic, put the economy on its feet, get 
the kids back in school, and let grand-
parents visit those grandkids again. 
That is part of getting America back 
where it needs to be. 
We 
need 
bipartisan 
support. 
As 
Democrats, we provided that support 
to a Republican President. Now that 
we have a Democratic President, will 
our Republican Senators do the same? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I was 
presiding on Tuesday. Sometimes my 
staff will give me a folder of things to 
review while I am presiding, and often 
they will be upset when I come back 
having not reviewed what they have 
given me. The reason for that is sim-
ple: When there are Members speaking 
before the body, I am, frankly, very in-
terested to listen and to hear what our 
colleagues have to say. We don’t do 
enough of that in this place. We are so 
busy during the day, we don’t spend a 
lot of time on the Senate floor. We 
might have the floor on on our TV in 
our office, but we are not always pay-
ing attention to what our colleagues 
have to say. One of the benefits of 
being able to preside is that you do get 
to listen to the arguments that are 
being made right here on the floor. 
In the hour or so that I was presiding 
on Tuesday, I got to hear about four or 
five of my Republican colleagues come 
down in sequence to make their case as 
to why they would be voting against 
the American Rescue Plan, and so I got 
to hear a number of themes being de-
veloped. 
I don’t think coincidentally a num-
ber of arguments were made repeatedly 
by many of our friends on the Repub-
lican side of the aisle, and so I decided 
it might be worthwhile to just spend a 
few minutes talking about the claims 
that are made about this bill by Repub-
licans, the reasons why they are voting 
against it, and to talk about how some 
of these arguments may be a little bit 
more disingenuous than we might like. 
The first thing that I heard was that 
this bill was just too expensive. It is 
$1.9 trillion. That is a lot of money, no 
doubt, but this country has never ever 
faced a healthcare crisis or an eco-
nomic crisis like we do today. This is 
an unprecedented moment in our Na-
tion’s history, and it requires us to 
step up and do something that isn’t 
just going to sound like it will work 
and help people but actually will.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1041 
March 4, 2021 
What is, I guess, to me ironic about 
this claim that it is too expensive, that 
it is going to cost our kids and 
grandkids too much money, is that Re-
publicans passed a tax bill that was al-
most to the dollar the exact same 
amount as this relief bill is. They 
passed a $1.9 trillion tax bill where the 
majority of the benefits went to the 
richest Americans who needed no more 
help. There was no crisis in 2017 
amongst American millionaires and 
billionaires. Yet Republicans were very 
willing to draw down $1.9 trillion in 
debt-financed tax cuts; $1.3 trillion in 
corporate tax cuts; $83 billion to let 
heirs of huge mega-estates be able to 
inherit more money without taxation; 
$435 billion tax cut for the wealthiest 1 
percent of Americans. So it is a little 
hard to listen to my Republican col-
leagues claim that this bill is too ex-
pensive when they were willing to 
spend the exact same amount of money 
in 2017 on tax cuts for their wealthy 
corporate and millionaire friends. 
It is also hard to listen to this argu-
ment because just a year ago, Repub-
licans were willing to spend $1.9 tril-
lion to address this crisis. It isn’t as if 
Republicans haven’t understood, when 
they were in control of the White 
House and the Congress, that we need-
ed to step up and meet this moment. 
Republicans have said: Well, this is dif-
ferent because we are turning the cor-
ner. Well, as Senator DURBIN laid out 
very well, we may be able to see the 
corner, but we are not there yet. 
March 24 was the day that we passed 
the CARES Act—almost the same 
amount of money as we are considering 
today. On that day, 737 people died of 
COVID–19. Yesterday, 2,369 people died 
of COVID–19. So in many ways, the cri-
sis today is exponentially worse than it 
was a year ago when Republicans, to a 
person, were willing to spend $2 trillion 
on the crisis. Now, all of a sudden, 
when Democrats are in charge of the 
White House, when a Democratic ma-
jority leader sits here in the U.S. Sen-
ate, $1.9 trillion is too much money to 
spend on a crisis that is taking on a 
daily basis three to four times as many 
lives as it did when we spent this 
money a year ago. 
By the way, the economic crisis is 
still acute. There may be technically 
more people at work today than there 
were in April or May of last year, but 
surveys suggest today 80 percent of 
Americans don’t have enough money to 
pay their bills. Why? Because a lot of 
people are back to work, but they are 
working fewer hours, right? They have 
less reliable work. So there is still a 
crisis that exists amongst 80 percent of 
Americans today. This is no less than 
the crisis that existed in 2017. 
Here is the second critique that is 
made over and over about this bill: It is 
a partisan bill, Republicans say. Well, 
that is a complaint of Republicans’ 
own making because it is only a par-
tisan bill in the U.S. Senate. Three out 
of four voters support the American 
Rescue Plan. This is a recent Morning 
Consult poll. It has been referred to be-
fore on the floor. Seventy percent of all 
voters support the American Rescue 
Plan. Not surprisingly, there is some 
difference between Democrats and Re-
publicans but, frankly, not much. Nine-
ty percent of Democrats support the 
American Rescue Plan, and 60 percent 
of Republicans support the American 
Rescue Plan. Why? Because everybody 
is hurting in this country. Everybody 
is hurting. Republicans and Democrats 
need an extension of unemployment 
benefits. Republicans and Democrats 
both want cash payments. Republicans 
and Democrats know that their kids 
can’t get what they need in schools 
without additional support. 
This is a unifying proposal in the 
American public. President Biden made 
a commitment to govern in a way that 
unified the country. He has done that. 
He has proposed a bill that has the 
broad 
support 
of 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats. I don’t know that it is his 
fault that it can’t draw Republican 
support in Congress despite the fact 
that it draws Republican support from 
the public. 
Finally, this was maybe the most in-
teresting theme of the complaints: It is 
not COVID relief. I have heard different 
statistics thrown out by my Repub-
lican friends. Some of them suggest 
that only 5 percent of this bill is 
COVID relief. I am not sure exactly 
how they come to that calculation, but 
what I understand them to say is that 
anything that isn’t directly related to 
putting shots in people’s arms or treat-
ing people with present cases of COVID 
is not COVID relief. 
Well, let’s just take a look at what 
was broadly part of the CARES Act 
that was supported by every single Re-
publican and what is broadly part of 
the American Rescue Plan, because my 
Republican colleagues thought that ev-
erything in the CARES Act was COVID 
relief, whether it was designed to im-
mediately attack the healthcare crisis 
or whether it was designed to address 
the economic crisis. 
There were stimulus checks in the 
CARES Act—not as big as the ones in 
the American Rescue Plan, but they 
were COVID relief when we passed the 
CARES Act. Now, according to Repub-
licans, they are not COVID relief. 
There was an unemployment exten-
sion and a plus-up in the maximum 
benefit under the CARES Act. That 
was COVID relief back in March of last 
year, but now, according to Repub-
licans, it is not COVID relief. 
There was money for vaccines and for 
testing in the CARES Act. In the 
American Rescue Plan, there is money 
for vaccines and testing. 
Small business relief was, of course, 
conceived in the CARES Act, the PPP 
program. That is a big part of the 
American Rescue Plan, but now it is 
not COVID relief, according to my Re-
publican colleagues, whereas it was 
last year. 
There was State and local funding in 
the CARES Act. There is State and 
local funding in the American Rescue 
Plan. 
There was rent and mortgage relief 
in the CARES Act. There is rent and 
mortgage relief in the American Res-
cue Plan. 
All of a sudden, since Democrats 
took control of the White House and 
took control of the Senate, all of these 
things, 
which 
were 
categorized 
as 
COVID relief by Republicans in March, 
are no longer COVID. You are just sup-
posed to think of these as extras, as 
Democratic priorities. 
Ninety percent—ninety-five percent 
of what is in the package we are voting 
on today is simply an extension of the 
same set of funding streams that we 
authorized in a bipartisan way a year 
ago. And so this idea that this is some 
Democratic wish list, when we are es-
sentially just extending or increasing 
the same funding streams that were in 
the CARES Act, is nonsense. It is non-
sense. Of course, this is all COVID re-
lief. Of course, it is COVID relief when 
you are increasing nutritional benefits 
to people who can’t afford to feed their 
kids because they have lost their job or 
they have lost hours because the econ-
omy melted down due to a pandemic. 
That is not, all of a sudden, not COVID 
relief today. 
This one is maybe the most bizarre of 
Republican claims. This bill is expen-
sive, but it is not too expensive. This 
moment is unique, and we are man-
dated by our oath of office to meet this 
moment. Republicans didn’t have a 
problem spending $1.9 trillion to give 
tax breaks to their wealthy friends. I 
don’t know why they, all of a sudden, 
have a problem putting money in the 
pockets of hard-working Americans 
who are suffering through the worst 
healthcare crisis this country has seen 
in a century. 
Republicans say this is a partisan 
bill. Out there in America, guess 
what—it is not. It is not. Republicans 
and Democrats support this because it 
is full of commonsense ideas that make 
a lot of sense to people, no matter what 
their political ideology is outside of 
Washington. 
Republicans say this bill isn’t COVID 
relief but a Democratic progressive 
wish list. No, it is simply an extension 
of the things that were bipartisan pri-
orities last year. We thought they were 
good ideas then. We think they are 
good ideas now, especially given the 
fact that four times as many people are 
dying today as were dying in March of 
2020, when we passed the first bipar-
tisan CARES Act, and as the economy 
today is in just as dire straits as it was. 
I hope we are turning the corner. I 
hope we get vaccines into the arms of 
individuals such that we are soon back 
to the numbers of deaths per day that 
we saw in March of last year. I hope 
that we are on a road again to full em-
ployment. But I am confident that 
none of that can happen unless we 
make this investment in COVID relief 
and in economic relief. It is an obliga-
tion as stewards of the economy and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1042 
March 4, 2021 
the welfare of the American people for 
us to step up to the plate and get this 
done this week. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Republican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, less than 
2 months ago, at his inauguration, 
President Biden spoke about his deep 
commitment to bringing Americans to-
gether. 
Today, the Senate will consider the 
first major bill of his Presidency, an in-
tensely partisan piece of legislation. 
Why is the bill before us today so par-
tisan? It is not because Republicans 
were 
unwilling 
to 
cooperate 
with 
Democrats on COVID legislation. In 
fact—in fact—Republicans made it very 
clear that we were willing to work with 
Democrats. 
No, the bill before us today is so 
heavily partisan because Democrats 
didn’t want to work with Republicans. 
Democrats saw an opportunity to use 
the COVID crisis to advance a whole 
host of liberal priorities, and they were 
afraid that allowing Republicans to 
participate in the process would mean 
that some of their pet projects would 
be excluded or that they would have to 
pare back some of their more prof-
ligate spending. 
So Democrats decided to use rec-
onciliation to ensure that Republicans 
wouldn’t be able to interfere with their 
Democratic legislation. And let’s be 
very clear about the nature of that leg-
islation. 
Democrats 
would 
like 
to 
present this as a COVID bill. It is not. 
Yes, there are a handful of true COVID 
priorities in this legislation, such as 
more 
money 
for 
vaccines 
and 
coronavirus treatment, something that 
I think everybody here on both sides of 
the aisle supports. But the bulk of this 
bill is either non-COVID-related or os-
tensibly COVID-related but, actually, 
either unnecessary or excessive. 
On the non-COVID front, there is the 
$86 billion bailout for multiemployer 
pension plans, the billions for climate 
change and other environmental policy 
issues, a new taxpayer-funded leave 
program for government employees 
with no requirement that it be used for 
COVID–19, and I could go on. 
The version of the bill that came 
over from the House contained such 
non-COVID-related measures as $100 
million for an underground rail project 
in the House Speaker’s home State and 
$1.5 million for a bridge in the Demo-
cratic leader’s home State, plus a mas-
sive increase in the Federal minimum 
wage that would cost an estimated 1.4 
million jobs, according to the Congres-
sional Budget Office, and potentially— 
potentially—devastate 
small 
busi-
nesses already reeling from the effects 
of the coronavirus. 
Then there are the ostensibly COVID- 
related measures, such as $350 billion 
for States. So what is the big problem 
there? Well, States don’t need any-
where near that much money to weath-
er the rest of the pandemic. The vast 
majority of States are not in crisis, 
and rescuing those States that are not 
in crisis would not take anywhere close 
to $350 billion. Democrats are going to 
spend hundreds of billions of taxpayer 
dollars on an unnecessary giveaway to 
States, and on top of that, that give-
away is heavily, heavily weighted in 
favor of blue States. That is right. The 
distribution formula is designed to 
heavily favor Democratic States. 
Well, then there is the money for 
schools. Now, Republicans have been 
very willing to give schools money to 
help them reopen. In fact, last year, 
when Republicans were in the major-
ity—which, by the way, during that 
time we passed five COVID–19 relief 
bills, all with bipartisan cooperation 
and support, at the 60-vote level that 
we use here in the Senate for most leg-
islation that we take up under regular 
order—but we put a lot of money into 
giving schools money to help them re-
open. In fact, Republicans voted for $68 
billion for K–12 schools. 
At this point, that money is suffi-
cient. Schools have spent just $5 billion 
of the $68 billion that we have already 
provided. Let me repeat that. So far, 
schools have spent just $5 billion, or 
less than 10 percent, of the $68 billion 
that has already been given to them. 
Yet the Democrats’ bill would appro-
priate an additional $129 billion for 
schools, 95 percent of which would be 
spent after this year—the year of the 
crisis, the year of the emergency, the 
year of the pandemic. You would think 
that, if this was a crisis, the funding 
would be made available to be used this 
year, but it is not. It is spent in the 
years 2022 to 2028. 
Do Democrats really expect Ameri-
cans to believe that school dollars that 
won’t be spent until 2027 or 2028 are ur-
gently needed coronavirus response 
dollars? This is the pattern with this 
bill, though. 
We just passed a large coronavirus 
relief 
bill 
in 
December, 
the 
fifth 
coronavirus relief bill that Congress 
has passed, and a lot of the money from 
that bill hasn’t been spent yet. In fact, 
a lot of money from earlier coronavirus 
bills has not been spent. Yet Demo-
crats are throwing massive additional 
amounts of money at various recipi-
ents with no idea—no clear idea—of 
whether or not that money will be 
needed or, in some cases, when we 
know very well that that money isn’t 
needed. 
Republicans 
will 
be 
introducing 
amendments to the Democrats’ bill. I 
am introducing an amendment to undo 
the Biden administration’s freeze on 
the Coronavirus Food Assistance Pro-
gram, which has provided support for 
farmers and ranchers who have been 
hit hard by the pandemic. 
I hope some of my less extreme 
Democratic colleagues will join Repub-
licans to advance some of our amend-
ments, 
such 
as 
Senator 
GRAHAM’s 
amendment to change the distribution 
formula for States to the formula used 
in the bipartisan CARES Act, which 
passed unanimously here in the Senate, 
so that both red and blue States would 
get a fair shot at funding, or amend-
ments to remove those provisions that 
are in no way related to COVID relief. 
Unfortunately, Democratic leaders 
have made it very clear that they are 
not willing to entertain Republican 
ideas. So I don’t have a lot of con-
fidence that Republican amendments, 
even if adopted, will end up in the final 
bill. 
It is deeply disappointing that pretty 
much the first thing Democrats did 
this Congress was to take a bipartisan 
process—the 
coronavirus 
relief—and 
make it partisan. All five—all five—of 
the coronavirus bills that Congress has 
passed to date—last year, when Repub-
licans were in the majority—were bi-
partisan. This bill could have been bi-
partisan, too, but Democrats decided 
that Republicans and the Americans 
that they represent should not have a 
voice in this legislation. 
Is this what the rest of the Biden 
Presidency is going to look like? I sure 
hope not, because it is going to be real-
ly hard—really hard—to come up with 
solutions that are durable and that 
represent the middle of the country— 
those people whose voices are not 
heard in the legislation that we will be 
taking up today. 
I yield the floor.

CONCERNS OVER NATIONS FUND-
ING UNIVERSITY CAMPUS INSTI-
TUTES IN THE UNITED STATES 
ACT 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to talk a few minutes about the good 
people of China, about Confucius Insti-
tutes, and the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
I meant what I said when I referred 
to ‘‘the good people of China.’’ You vis-
ited China, Mr. President. The people 
of China are wonderful people. They 
are engaging. They are smart. They 
have a great sense of humor. They have 
built an extraordinary economy. 
I wish I could say the same about 
their authoritarian government, but I 
can’t. The Communist Party of China 
is trying to not only swallow China, it 
is trying to swallow the world. 
We helped the Communist Party of 
China be admitted into the World 
Trade Organization. We were told that 
if we did, they would embrace free en-
terprise. We were told that the Com-
munist Party of China would be a valu-
able participant in a stable world 
order. None of that has come to be the 
case. 
We know what the Communist Party 
of China has done to Hong Kong. We 
know what the Communist Party of 
China has done to the Uighurs. We 
know what the Communist Party of 
China has done to the wonderful, won-
derful people of Tibet. But I did want 
to make that distinction between the 
authoritarian government of the Com-
munist Party of China and the Chinese 
people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1043 
March 4, 2021 
The Communist Party of China, 
being as aggressive as it is, has for a 
number of years reached out to our col-
leges and universities to establish what 
the Communist Party of China calls 
‘‘Confucius Institutes.’’ And this was 
the pitch made by the government of 
China to our universities: ‘‘We will give 
you bucket loads of money if you’’— 
our American universities—‘‘will allow 
us to establish Confucius Institutes 
where we can explain our culture to 
the young people of America, where we 
can have a free exchange of ideas, and 
where we can help young Americans 
learn the Chinese language if they 
would like.’’ 
That sounds great. You know, I will 
take a dozen of those. But the Com-
munist Party of China being the Com-
munist Party of China, that is not how 
our Confucius Institutes have worked 
out. 
These institutes, run by the authori-
tarian Government of China, will not 
allow the free exchange of ideas. They 
will not allow anyone to talk about the 
Uighurs or the people of Tibet or Hong 
Kong or what happened at Tiananmen 
Square. They basically—‘‘they’’ mean-
ing the Communist Party of China— 
have used these Confucius Institutes as 
propaganda arms of their government. 
Many of our universities have done 
the right thing. They have said: No, we 
stand for the free exchange of ideas, 
and if you are going to come on our 
campus and tell our people that there 
are things they can’t talk about, then, 
respectfully, you need—you, the Confu-
cius Institutes—to leave our campus. 
But some of the universities haven’t 
done the right thing. I am not sug-
gesting that—I am not cynical enough 
to suggest that it is all about the 
money, but you can’t ignore the fact 
that I think the Communist Party of 
China 
has 
given 
our 
universities, 
through the years—don’t hold me to 
this figure exactly—but about $150 mil-
lion to set up these Confucius Insti-
tutes. Universities, you know, they 
build that money into their budget, so 
they are reluctant to see the Confucius 
Institutes leave—not all of our univer-
sities but some of them. I recognize the 
economic reality. 
I have a bill that would say to—we 
wouldn’t get rid of Confucius Insti-
tutes. It will just tell our universities: 
You have to properly manage them. 
You can’t allow the Confucius Insti-
tutes to stay on your campus if the 
Confucius Institutes will not allow for 
the free exchange of ideas. 
If kids—I shouldn’t call them kids. If 
young people in our universities want 
to talk about Tibet, they get to talk 
about Tibet. And the bill would say 
that the universities have to take back 
control of these Confucius Institutes 
from the Communist Party of China; 
otherwise, they are not going to be eli-
gible for Federal funds. 
My bill, once again, doesn’t kick any-
body off campus. It just says you have 
to—you, 
the 
Communist 
Party 
of 
China, have to do what you originally 
told us you were going to do. 
My bill has—our bill, because the 
Senate passed it twice. Twice this bill 
has passed the U.S. Senate, the last 
time with bipartisan support. We put 
the bill on the NDAA, and, Mr. Presi-
dent, you know how conference com-
mittees work with the NDAA. Some-
times it is a ferret fire drill, and there 
is a lot of confusion, and somehow the 
Confucius Institute bill got watered 
down to do nothing in the conference 
negotiations on the NDAA. I am not 
criticizing anybody, but it happened. 
So I am going to ask my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to pass the 
Confucius Institute Act for a third 
time, and I hope, in our new Congress, 
we can keep teeth in it in working with 
our colleagues, not only in the Senate 
but in the House. 
Toward that end, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of S. 590, in-
troduced earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 590) to establish limitations re-
garding Confucius Institutes, and for other 
purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 590) was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed, as follows: 
S. 590 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since 
we have a few minutes here—I think 
Senator SANDERS
is supposed to be 
next—I just thought I would take a few 
minutes 
to 
talk 
about 
President 
Biden’s coronavirus bill. 
Let me see if I can explain why so 
many of my Republican colleagues— 
and I am a part of that—are dis-
appointed in the bill. This bill will be 
our sixth coronavirus bill. I don’t think 
anybody, any fair-minded person, can 
accuse the U.S. Senate, both Demo-
crats and Republicans, of not trying to 
respond to this devastating virus and 
the economic problems it has created. 
I have been very proud, within the 
first five bills, that we did it on a bi-
partisan basis. We spent a lot of 
money, about $4 trillion. That is 4–0-0– 
0-0–0-0–0-0–0-0–0-0 
taxpayer 
dollars. 
And, of course, we don’t even have 5 
percent of that. We borrowed every bit 
of it. It is a staggering sum. But we did 
it because we had a crisis. We had to 
deal with it. That is what we were sent 
up here to do. We did it on a bipartisan 
basis. But this, the last bill, President 
Biden’s most recent bill—we call it the 
$1.9 trillion bill—we haven’t done it on 
a bipartisan basis. I am disappointed in 
that. 
I understand politics. The Presiding 
Officer does too. But I listened very 
carefully to President Biden through-
out the campaign and in his 6 weeks of 
this administration, and he said very 
clearly and repeatedly: You know, I 
want to work with everybody. What I 
heard him say to the Republicans was: 
You know, I want to meet you halfway. 
I don’t mean any disrespect, but if 
that is the case, either he or the people 
around him are not very good judges of 
distance. 
It has been made very clear to us 
that there would be no negotiations on 
this bill and that President Biden de-
cided to proceed to reconciliation, 
which only requires a majority. And I 
think we both expect there to be 50 
Democratic votes in favor of this bill 
and 50 Republican votes against it, and 
Vice President HARRIS will break the 
tie. That is not a bipartisan bill, and I 
regret that, and I think it could have 
been different. 
You know, we can debate about 
whether we need $1.9 trillion, and I un-
derstand there are good arguments on 
both sides. I have heard the arguments, 
and I have listened carefully to my 
Democratic friends explain why they 
think we need it. There is another side 
of the story, and that is that, thank 
the Lord, we enjoyed 4 percent GDP 
growth last quarter. Most economists 
reckon that we will have about 6 per-
cent GDP growth this year. The Amer-
ican people have about $1.6 trillion in 
excess savings. We have all this liquid-
ity that, as soon as it is allowed to be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1044 
March 4, 2021 
released, is going to stimulate our 
economy substantially, in my judg-
ment. 
Everyone involved is doing a wonder-
ful job on the vaccines. President 
Trump’s team did a wonderful job. 
President Biden’s team is doing a good 
job. The Governors seem to be doing a 
great job. People are getting vac-
cinated. We know that we have a lot of 
people in America who had the virus 
and didn’t even know it. We are rapidly 
approaching the point where, either 
through vaccination or people who had 
the virus and therefore have the anti-
bodies, we are going to have way over 
the majority of American people pro-
tected. 
So one point of view is that we don’t 
need to spend $1.9 trillion, but there 
was a middle ground here, and I am dis-
appointed that the President took the 
position that, look, we need to spend $2 
trillion right now, even though there is 
$1 trillion at least in previously appro-
priated funds that we haven’t spent 
yet. 
Now, a reasonable approach would 
have been to say: Do we really need to 
spend $2 trillion? Maybe we ought to 
spend the other $1 trillion and see if 
that will do it. Another reasonable ap-
proach would have been to say: Maybe 
we ought to reprogram some of the $1 
trillion that hasn’t been spent. For ex-
ample, we appropriated I think about 
$70 billion to our elementary and sec-
ondary schools. They have only spent 
$4 billion, so why are we giving them 
another 
$160 
billion 
in 
President 
Biden’s bill? Maybe—I am not saying it 
is the case, but we ought to explore it— 
maybe the schools didn’t need the full 
$70 billion we gave them if they have 
only spent $4 billion or $5 billion. So 
maybe we can reprogram some of that 
money. 
Now, if we had this money sitting in 
a checking account, I would still 
think—because it represents a scarce 
resource, I would still think that we 
need to take a look at the money we 
have already sent and either spend it, 
if it is well placed, or reprogram it be-
fore we go out and spend $2 trillion. 
But we don’t have the money in a 
checking account. We will borrow 
every penny of this money, $2 trillion. 
That is going to bring debt up to 27, 28, 
29 trillion dollars, and we know that 
right behind it is going to come a green 
infrastructure bill. I am hearing that 
could be $2 trillion to $3 trillion more. 
At some point, we are going to run out 
of digits. I mean, at some point, we are 
going to have to change the name of 
the Department of Treasury to the 
‘‘Department of Debt’’ because there is 
no treasury left. It is all debt. 
The other thing that bothers me 
about the bill is President Biden—and, 
again, I understand politics. He has 
marketed this bill as an emergency. It 
is an emergency. We have to do it now. 
Right now, we need $1.9 trillion to deal 
with the economic crisis caused by the 
lockdown. And I understand that argu-
ment and that there currently are 
some Americans who need help, but if 
what the President is saying is accu-
rate, then why is so much of the money 
not even going to be spent until a year 
from now? 
I look at the bill, and I say, if all 
that is true to deal with an immediate 
crisis, why are we giving money to 
States and local governments that 
have actually seen their revenues go 
up? Why? There is no crisis. And I look 
at the bill and I ask myself, you know, 
why are we giving money to bail out 
pension plans? Can we talk about this? 
And I look at the bill and I say, why, as 
I just alluded to, why are we giving $160 
billion—I think that is the figure—$160 
billion to our elementary and sec-
ondary education institutions when we 
have given them $70 billion in the past 
and they have only spent $4 billion? 
Where is the fire? They have $65 billion 
or so left. This is real money. There is 
no money fairy. 
I look at the bill—I mean, I want to 
help the American people. Gosh, many 
of them do need help. But should we 
really be sending stimulus checks to 
people who have never missed a pay-
check out there? Do they really need 
the money if they haven’t been laid off 
and if they have been paid the entire 
time of the lockdown? Why are we 
doing this? 
Couldn’t that money—first of all, one 
option is not to spend it if there is not 
a need. We can pay down our debt or at 
least not increase our debt. Another 
option would be to spend it on some-
thing that we really need. 
I come to the conclusion—I am not 
trying to be mean-spirited, but that is 
why I say calling this a coronavirus 
bill, you know, it is like calling Harvey 
Weinstein a feminist. This isn’t a 
coronavirus bill, not the way it has 
been portrayed. 
Now, the American people still have 
needs. We still have some folks, pri-
marily in the leisure industry and in 
the travel industry, who need our help. 
They do need help. 
We have a lot of folks who have lost 
their jobs through no fault of their 
own. They are on unemployment that 
is about to run out. They need our 
help, and we ought to help. But the 
right way to do this is to sit down as a 
body—Democrats 
and 
Republicans— 
and go through our needs, not our 
wants, because that is another problem 
with this bill; it is more ‘‘wanty’’ than 
needy. Let’s go through our needs, and 
let’s discuss how much money we 
should appropriate to those needs in 
light of the facts that we have already 
spent $4 trillion and we have a bunch of 
money left over. And that is not the 
way this is being done. 
This is just being rammed down our 
throats. This is just raw gut politics, 
which I understand. I have been around 
it. You have, too, Mr. President. We 
have both been around the block a few 
times. But that is not how you allocate 
scarce resources. 
The final point I will make is, I know 
when we did the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act—‘‘we,’’ meaning the Republicans— 
we went through reconciliation. We 
did. And so a fairminded person might 
be thinking, well, KENNEDY, you know, 
how can you criticize your Democratic 
colleagues for using reconciliation if 
you did it? And that is fair, except 
when we did the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act, we asked our Democratic friends 
in leadership: Can we sit down and see 
what we can put together? And we were 
told: No, we don’t want to reduce taxes. 
That is not what happened this time. 
Ten of my colleagues—I wasn’t invited, 
and that is OK. But 10 of my colleagues 
went to the White House and visited 
with President Biden for 2 hours and 
came back and said: You know, I think 
he may want to put a bill together. 
And we were excited. We were going: 
Yay, that is great. Wonderful. 
Then, the next thing we knew, the 
White House issued a statement and 
said: Our idea of unity is to do what we 
say and don’t ask questions. 
Both of us know that is not unity. 
So all of this could have been avoid-
ed. It all could have been avoided. And 
I think we are going to end up spending 
money that doesn’t need to be spent 
right now. I think we are going to end 
up spending money where we don’t 
need to spend it. 
I am so glad that Senator SCHUMER 
withdrew his bridge project and that 
Speaker PELOSI withdrew her Silicon 
Valley subway. That is just spending 
porn as far as I am concerned. 
But, in any event, I wanted to get 
that off my chest. We are going to go 
through a vote-arama, where we all 
offer amendments. Maybe together we 
can make this bill better and get rid of 
some of the spending porn, as I call it, 
and do the job that the American peo-
ple sent us here to do. 
Thank you. 
I don’t see Senator SANDERS. I’m 
sorry. 
With that, I yield to my good friend 
Senator PETERS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, as we 
near the 1-year anniversary of the 
coronavirus 
pandemic 
ripping 
our 
country, there is no question that 
Michiganders and people all across our 
country are still hurting. 
While we are making important 
progress in the fight to combat this 
virus, this public health and economic 
crisis continues to take a significant 
toll on families, workers who are out of 
a job, educators, students, small busi-
nesses, hospitals, and communities all 
across our country. 
We passed targeted, temporary relief 
in December, but we knew at that time 
that that was not going to be enough. 
We need more robust, meaningful re-
lief. We must act quickly to meet the 
urgency of this moment by swiftly 
passing the American Rescue Plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1045 
March 4, 2021 
This is about relief for Michiganders 
and Americans who are reeling and are 
trying to make ends meet, funding to 
help schools safely reopen, sources to 
speed up vaccine distribution, and sup-
port for small businesses fighting to 
stay afloat. 
I continue to hear from Michiganders 
from all across the State who are 
struggling to put food on the table, pay 
their rent, and keep the lights on. 
These folks are not asking for a hand-
out; they simply want a lifeline to get 
to the other side of the pandemic. 
When we passed $600 relief checks in 
December, I pledged that we must do 
more and that we could do that by pro-
viding people with an additional $1,400 
to fulfill the promise of $2,000 in relief 
funds. With the American Rescue Plan, 
the 
majority 
of 
Michiganders 
and 
Americans who received these relief 
checks in December are going to be eli-
gible once again. 
This bill would mean a family of four 
could receive an additional $5,600. That 
support is vital to make sure that peo-
ple don’t fall into poverty as a result of 
this pandemic and that they can get 
back up on their feet as quickly as pos-
sible. 
We know that millions of workers 
across our country, including workers 
in Michigan, are on the verge of seeing 
unemployment 
benefits 
expire 
on 
March 14. We cannot abandon folks 
who are out of work through no fault of 
their own because of COVID–19. They 
have seen this pandemic disrupt their 
jobs and their incomes. The need for 
unemployment 
assistance 
is 
wide-
spread, and it is necessary in Michigan. 
For example, there were over 840,000 
active claims for Michiganders for un-
employment assistance in Michigan 
just in February. That is up from 
529,000 in January. And these claims 
for assistance come from every single 
county all across our State. We need to 
act now so these individuals remain el-
igible for unemployment benefits, in-
cluding if they were self-employed 
workers, like small business owners, 
freelance workers, independent con-
tractors, or gig workers. We must en-
sure families receiving unemployment 
have enough assistance to get by, 
which is why I support an additional 
$400 in weekly benefits. We also need to 
provide certainty that this assistance 
will continue to be there for them in 
the months ahead, not just for the next 
few days. The American relief plan will 
do just that by bolstering our State un-
employment programs with additional 
Federal support through August 29. 
To help families get back to work, we 
all know that we must also safely re-
open our schools. Many parents and 
educators are struggling to assist chil-
dren through lessons while juggling 
other work and caregiving demands 
during the pandemic. The American 
Rescue Plan reflects a point of con-
sensus that we want our students to re-
turn to in-person learning as quickly 
and as safely as possible. And the more 
resources that we can provide, the bet-
ter. 
In response to the negative impact 
that COVID–19 has had on education, a 
stronger and urgent investment in our 
schools 
is 
absolutely 
critical 
for 
achieving safe operations and recov-
ering from gaps in learning. That is 
why the American Rescue Plan is abso-
lutely essential. 
This legislation will provide $170 bil-
lion in emergency funding to our 
schools and to our students, with $130 
billion for K–12. The funding will help 
schools take steps based on science and 
recommended by the CDC to ensure 
that students and educators can safely 
return to the classroom. This includes 
repairing ventilation systems, reducing 
class 
sizes, 
implementing 
social 
distancing guidelines, purchasing per-
sonal protective equipment, and hiring 
support staff to care for students’ 
health and their well-being. 
Every family and community has 
been facing a very unique set of chal-
lenges, and we need to provide robust 
funding so schools and parents have 
what they need to keep children con-
nected 
with 
learning 
opportunities 
that are both safe and effective. 
And while these are important steps, 
we also know that if we are going to 
come back stronger from this pan-
demic, we also need to support the very 
backbone of our economy, which is our 
small businesses. While we have passed 
several rounds of relief for small busi-
nesses, too many of our hard-hit small 
businesses are still reeling—from res-
taurants to boutiques, to family-owned 
and minority-owned businesses. 
The American Rescue Plan has sig-
nificant small business relief, including 
$25 billion in grants for restaurants and 
bars that have lost revenue because of 
the pandemic; $15 billion for economic 
injury disaster loan advance grants; $7 
million in funding for Paycheck Pro-
tection Program loans and expanded 
eligibility for nonprofits. 
Additionally, this package reauthor-
izes and provides $10 billion in Federal 
funding—including $1.5 billion specifi-
cally for minority-owned small busi-
nesses—to the State Small Business 
Credit Initiative. 
I was proud to help establish this 
program in 2010 while serving in the 
House of Representatives. This pro-
gram is a proven success. In Michigan, 
it has helped small businesses create or 
retain over 12,000 jobs, and it strength-
ens State programs that support fi-
nancing of small businesses, allowing 
them to both grow and to create more 
jobs. 
I am pleased to again champion this 
program, and with additional invest-
ment, it will again provide crucial sup-
port to small businesses in Michigan 
and all across our country. 
And, finally, to completely get this 
pandemic under control, we must ramp 
up the distribution of vaccines. That is 
one of my top priorities as chairman of 
the Committee on Homeland Security 
and Government Affairs. 
Thanks to the extraordinary work of 
our scientists, our researchers, and our 
vaccine makers, especially those in my 
home State of Michigan, we now have 
three safe and effective vaccines. But I 
know that many people have been frus-
trated and darn right angered by the 
difficulties they have had in trying to 
secure vaccines for their loved ones or 
for themselves. I am encouraged that 
President Biden and his administration 
have been working tirelessly to expand 
vaccine production and speed up vac-
cine distribution. But to get those ad-
ditional vaccines into people’s arms, it 
will take additional resources. 
Through my work on the Senate 
Homeland Security Committee, I have 
been leading the charge to ensure that 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency has the essential staff, sup-
plies, transportation, and other re-
sources necessary to ensure that every 
vaccine dose is actually reaching an 
arm in this country. 
I have spoken with President Biden 
both in the Oval Office and at the 
Pfizer vaccine facility in Portage, MI, 
about the critical need to expedite the 
deployment of vaccines and to do ev-
erything—do everything in our power 
to ensure vaccines are free and widely 
available 
in 
every 
community 
as 
quickly and as efficiently as possible. 
The American relief plan includes $50 
billion to help FEMA support a na-
tional vaccine program to efficiently 
administer vaccines, including under-
served communities. It also provides 
frontline medical professionals the per-
sonal protective equipment, testing 
supplies, and workforce needed to slow 
and to eliminate the spread of COVID– 
19. 
All of these resources are mission 
critical as FEMA plays a leading role 
in assisting the Federal Government’s 
response to COVID–19 by coordinating 
medical supply acquisition and dis-
tribution and assisting State and local 
governments with funds for response 
activities, such as vaccine distribution 
and overtime pay for public health offi-
cials. 
As we consider the American Rescue 
Plan, there are signs of hope, particu-
larly with ramped-up vaccine produc-
tion. We are beginning to emerge from 
a very dark winter, but our work is not 
done. 
We cannot be complacent. We cannot 
let up. This virus does not take a day 
off, and neither can we. 
We must pass the American Rescue 
Plan. This package is not only what 
the American people need, but it is 
what they want. There is widespread 
support across the country for this 
package—from mayors to Governors, 
to economists across the political spec-
trum, and the majority of the Amer-
ican people. 
We must deliver comprehensive and 
urgently needed relief so we can do just 
that by passing the American Rescue 
Plan. This package will not mark the 
end of our efforts to crush this virus, 
but it will provide a massive shot in 
the arm to help families, to safely open 
up our schools, and to accelerate the 
development of more vaccines.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1046 
March 4, 2021 
So, with that, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the motion to pro-
ceed and final passage. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, later 
today or tomorrow, as part of the 
American Rescue Plan, which we will 
be discussing in the next few days, 
which I happen to believe is the most 
significant piece of legislation to come 
to the floor of the Senate in decades in 
terms of addressing the crises facing 
working families—as part of that piece 
of legislation, I will be offering an 
amendment to raise the Federal min-
imum wage from $7.25 an hour, which I 
believe is a starvation wage, to $15 an 
hour over a 5-year period—5 years. 
I 
think 
there 
has 
been 
some 
miscommunication around here, and 
there are people who are saying it is 
going from 7.25 to 15 bucks an hour in 
1 year. Not true. It goes from 7.25 to 
9.50, to 11, to 12.50, to 14, to 15 dollars 
an hour. So anyone who says we are 
raising the minimum wage in 1 year, in 
the midst of a pandemic, to $15 an hour 
is simply not telling the truth. 
This amendment is similar to a bill 
which I have brought forth, the Raise 
the Wage Act, which I am proud to say 
has been cosponsored by some 38 Mem-
bers of the Senate, and this is also 
similar to legislation which has al-
ready passed the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. And I thank them, and I 
thank my friends in the Progressive 
Caucus in the House for doing a great 
job in pushing this legislation. 
I should also add, for my Senate col-
leagues, that this legislation raising 
the minimum wage is supported by 
some 300 national organizations, in-
cluding the 12 million members of the 
AFL–CIO and virtually every major 
union in this country. This is some-
thing that unions like the SEIU, one of 
the largest unions in this country, 
have been fighting for, for a very long 
time. 
I should also add here that while 
raising the minimum wage is going to 
impact every low-wage worker in this 
country—because 
African-American 
and Latino workers often are earning 
poverty wages—it significantly im-
pacts the lives of the minority commu-
nities as well. That is why, among so 
many other organizations supporting 
this amendment, it is supported by the 
Leadership Conference on Civil and 
Human Rights; it is supported by the 
National Organization for Women be-
cause, again, when we talk about low- 
wage workers, we are talking about the 
minority community, we are talking 
about women; and that is why it is sup-
ported by groups like Unidos, the 
American Association of University 
Women, Indivisible, Justice for Mi-
grant Women, the National Domestic 
Workers Alliance, and the National 
Women’s Law Center. 
So, once again, this is legislation 
that will increase wages for 30 million 
American workers. And if you ask me 
what the great economic crisis in our 
country is today, it is not just high un-
employment; it is not just income and 
wealth inequality; it is that half of our 
people today, and before the pandemic, 
were living paycheck to paycheck. 
Their wages were so low that if they 
had a problem with their car or their 
kid got sick, suddenly they were in fi-
nancial crisis. 
And in the richest country in the his-
tory of the world, half of our people 
should not be facing economic despera-
tion when their car breaks down. The 
reason for that is, significantly, that 
many millions of workers are earning 
starvation wages—and I underline that, 
starvation wages—in this country. 
I would love to hear anybody get up 
here and tell me that they could live 
on seven and a quarter an hour, they 
could live on 8 bucks an hour, they 
could live on 9 bucks an hour. You 
can’t. And I have been all over this 
country, and I have talked to workers 
who are making 10, 11 bucks an hour, 
with 
tears 
streaming 
down 
their 
cheeks, telling me what it is like to 
work for starvation wages and try to 
raise your kids. 
So the time is long overdue. The last 
time this Congress passed an increase 
in the minimum wage was in the year 
2007—2007. It is time to raise the min-
imum wage. It is time to raise the min-
imum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks 
an hour. 
Now, later on today or this evening, 
as part of my support for this enor-
mously important piece of legislation— 
and, as chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, I will be speaking more about 
why we need to raise the minimum 
wage, but I want to focus on one part of 
the minimum wage bill that I have 
been hearing a little bit about in the 
last couple of days from some of my 
colleagues, and that is the provision to 
raise the tipped wage. 
Now, the tipped wage, so everybody 
understands it, is the Federal min-
imum wage that applies to waiters and 
waitresses, barbers, hair stylists, park-
ing attendants, and others. Fellow 
Americans, do you know what that 
Federal minimum wage today is for 
that person who waits on your table at 
a restaurant? It is $2.12 an hour. Yeah, 
you heard me correctly: $2.12 an hour. 
And the proposal, as part of the min-
imum wage bill, the amendment that I 
will be offering, is that tipped min-
imum wage would go up from $2.12 an 
hour to $14.95 over a 7-year period, 
longer than the overall national min-
imum wage would go up. And this is 
something that clearly is desperately 
needed. 
Now, I know that, here in Wash-
ington, anytime we bring forth serious 
and important legislation for working 
people, the Big Money interests get to 
work, and all of their lobbyists, who 
make their six figures or seven figures 
a year, they get to work on Congress 
and tell you why you can’t do anything 
to protect the most vulnerable and 
hard-hit people in this country. 
So the National Restaurant Associa-
tion, they are a very powerful lobbying 
organization. I guess they have been 
enormously successful because we have 
not raised the Federal minimum wage 
since 2007. So the powerful lobbying or-
ganizations are going around, and they 
are telling Members of the House and 
the Senate that raising the tipped wage 
is opposed by restaurant workers and it 
would be harmful to the interest of 
waiters and waitresses and other peo-
ple. 
That is not true. That is what lobby-
ists say, representing Big Money inter-
ests. That is what they are paid to say, 
but that is not what workers who wait 
on tables are telling us. 
One Fair Wage, a grassroots organi-
zation representing service employ-
ees—waiters, waitresses, and others— 
has just delivered to the White House a 
petition with 140,000 signatures on it 
from service workers who are demand-
ing that they receive the same min-
imum wage as every other worker in 
this country. And polling among serv-
ice employees and nonservice employ-
ees also supports the reality that 
Americans want our waiters and our 
waitresses and other service employees 
to get a fair and equal minimum wage, 
similar to what other low-wage work-
ers are receiving. 
Now, I have heard from some who tell 
me that people who are waiting on ta-
bles—and, by the way, I was one of the 
worst waiters in the history of the 
country, but I was a waiter a long time 
ago. I know a little bit about it. I am 
hearing from some that waiters and 
waitresses, they are doing really well, 
making a whole lot of money, and they 
don’t need an increase in the minimum 
wage. 
Let’s be clear. When you talk about 
the restaurant and the hotel industry, 
you are talking about mass discrep-
ancies in the kind of incomes that peo-
ple receive. I will not deny it for a sec-
ond. My daughter worked in a fancy 
restaurant. She did quite well. 
So if you are working in a hotel in a 
fancy restaurant where you have a 
menu that is quite expensive—you have 
got a $100 meal and your 20 percent is 
20 bucks, you are waiting on three or 
four tables—you are doing OK. I don’t 
deny that for a second, and I wish those 
waiters and waitresses who work so 
hard continued success. 
But let us be clear. Not everybody 
works in a fancy restaurant or a big 
hotel which has a high-priced menu. 
You have got a whole lot of people 
working in diners, working in working- 
class restaurants where the menu is 
not that fancy, and maybe it is $10 for

lunch or $8 for lunch. Twenty percent 
of that is $1.60, on an $8 meal. 
Let us be very clear that, when we 
talk about waiters and waitresses, 
some 70 percent of tipped workers in 
this country are women, who suffer 
from three times the poverty rate of 
the rest of the U.S. workforce. In other 
words, women who are waitressing 
have a three times higher poverty rate 
than the rest of the U.S. workforce. 
Their tips are not keeping up with 
their needs. These women waitresses 
use food stamps at double the rate of 
other workers in this country. 
And, importantly, and increasingly 
so—amazingly, during this pandemic— 
waitresses suffer from the highest rates 
of sexual harassment of workers in any 
industry because they are forced to tol-
erate inappropriate customer behavior 
to feed their families through the tips 
that they get. 
We are hearing stories where people 
in a restaurant, guys in a restaurant 
say: Well, take your mask off. You 
want a tip; let me see how you look. 
And, clearly, this is unacceptable be-
havior. 
I also want to point out that the idea 
of moving tip wages to the same level 
over a period—in this case, 7 years— 
moving it to the same level as the 
overall minimum wage is not a radical 
idea. It ain’t a Bernie Sanders idea. It 
already exists. I don’t know if people 
know this. It already exists in seven 
States. So in seven States, right now, 
people who work in the service indus-
try—waiters, waitresses, and others— 
are getting the same minimum wage as 
all the workers in those States. And 
those States are California, Oregon, 
Washington, Nevada, Montana, Alaska, 
and Minnesota. Seven States already 
pay their service industry workers the 
same wages as they pay other min-
imum-wage workers. 
And I should point out that all of 
these States experienced a growth in 
the number of small businesses and res-
taurants after they abolished the tip 
minimum wage. So they abolished the 
tip minimum wage; it did not drive res-
taurants out of business. In fact, in 
those States where the tip minimum 
wage equaled the general minimum 
wage, we saw a growth in the number 
of restaurants. 
And, furthermore, to respond to an-
other piece of misinformation, waiters 
and waitresses in these States received 
more in tips, not less. So the mythol-
ogy that is going around here is that if 
we raise the minimum wage for waiters 
and waitresses, when somebody walks 
into a restaurant, they are going to be 
thinking, ‘‘Oh, my goodness, this per-
son is making 10, 12 bucks an hour; I 
am going to leave less of a tip,’’ ain’t 
the way the world works. 
Let me also say a word about how the 
pandemic, which has impacted workers 
in every sector—but how it has im-
pacted tip workers. In many States 
where the tip minimum wage still ex-
ists, tip workers—and this is rather un-
believable—tip workers did not even 
qualify for unemployment. So we are 
talking now, in this bill, of substan-
tially increasing unemployment—a $400 
supplement—and we are talking about 
extending it to late August. But tip 
workers, whose minimum wage is so 
low, do not even qualify for unemploy-
ment. 
In an industry where more than 6 
million workers have lost their jobs— 
and, obviously, we all know the res-
taurant and hotel industry have been 
terribly hard-hit by the pandemic— 
more than 60 percent of subminimum 
wage earners could not get unemploy-
ment benefits because the State and 
Federal Government denied them bene-
fits for not making enough earned in-
come. You all got that? 
So we are talking about the need— 
and I certainly agree with that—to ex-
pand and extend unemployment bene-
fits, but you have a whole lot of work-
ers who are earning starvation wages 
who are not going to be eligible for un-
employment. 
At the same time, as restaurants re-
open, the CDC has declared restaurants 
as the most dangerous place to work. 
We all know that. It is obvious. You 
are coming face-to-face with your cus-
tomers. And now servers, in the midst 
of that, are responsible—you are a 
waiter, you are a waitress, and you are 
now responsible—for telling somebody 
who walks into your restaurant that 
they must socially distance themselves 
or wear a mask. It is not necessarily a 
comfortable position for a worker deal-
ing with a hostile customer. 
I would also add, as all of us are in-
creasingly aware of sexual harassment 
in general in this country, that the res-
taurant industry has some of the high-
est rates of sexual harassment. In a 
workplace where 70 percent of the 
workers are women and where they 
rely on their customers to determine 
their wages because of tips, women are 
often expected to withstand sexual har-
assment in order to get those tips. 
In States where the subminimum 
wage has been eliminated, sexual har-
assment has been cut substantially be-
cause women no longer have to take 
that. It is not an all-or-nothing propo-
sition. 
If you ask me again what the major 
economic crisis facing this country is, 
we know unemployment is sky-high, 
we know income inequality is unac-
ceptable, and so many other factors are 
out there about the economy, but at 
the top of my list is the fact that tens 
of millions of workers in the richest 
country on Earth are barely making it. 
They are having a hard time feeding 
their kids. They are having a hard time 
paying their rent. Many of them get in-
adequate or no health insurance at all. 
Now, year after year, the American 
people—I 
think, 
correctly—perceive 
that this Congress bows to the wishes 
of the rich and the powerful, gives tax 
breaks to people who don’t need it. We 
deregulate companies that should be 
regulated, et cetera, et cetera. 
In this moment of economic and 
health crisis, now is the time for us to 
stand with working families, and the 
most important thing that we can do is 
to raise the minimum wage to a living 
wage. This is what Joe Biden believes. 
This is what the Democratic platform 
stands for, and this is what at least 38 
cosponsors of the Raise the Wage Act 
also believe. 
So here we are at a pivotal moment. 
The working class is being decimated. 
People are struggling to feed their 
kids. We have to raise wages in this 
country, and we have to raise the 
wages of tip workers. 
I will be back later for more on this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD a letter dated February 22, 
2021, about tip wages, signed by hun-
dreds of organizations. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
FEBRUARY 22, 2021. 
DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: The under-
signed organizations enthusiastically sup-
port the Raise the Wage Act of 2021, as intro-
duced in the Senate by Senators Bernie 
Sanders (VT) and Patty Murray (WA), and in 
the House by Representative Robert C. 
‘‘Bobby’’ Scott (VA). 
If enacted, the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 
would: 
Gradually raise the federal minimum wage 
to $15 an hour by 2025; 
After 2025, adjust the minimum wage each 
year to keep pace with growth in the median 
wage—a measure of wages for typical work-
ers; 
Phase out the egregious subminimum wage 
for tipped workers, which has been frozen at 
a meager $2.13 since 1991; and 
Sunset unacceptable subminimum wages 
for workers with disabilities employed in 
sheltered workshops and for workers under 
age 20. 
Since fast-food workers in New York City 
first walked off the job in 2012, demanding a 
$15 minimum wage and the right to form a 
union, workers across the country have com-
pletely changed the conversation and poli-
tics surrounding the minimum wage. Yet, 20 
states still have not raised their minimum 
wages beyond the paltry $7.25 federal min-
imum wage, and many more have only mar-
ginally higher minimum wages than the fed-
eral floor—despite clearly negative impacts 
on workers across the country. Those nega-
tive impacts also disproportionately affect 
Black and brown workers, who have histori-
cally been segregated into the lowest paying 
occupations in the U.S., and who are leading 
the Fight for $15 and a union. 
Congress should heed the demands of work-
ers of color, communities, and their con-
stituents and waste no more time in passing 
the Raise the Wage Act. Raising the federal 
minimum wage to $15 an hour and elimi-
nating subminimum wages for tipped work-
ers, youth workers, and workers with dis-
abilities is a long overdue, human rights im-
perative and a critical racial and gender jus-
tice issue—one that will make a crucial dif-
ference in the lives of millions of workers 
and in communities across the country. 
Gradually raising the federal minimum 
wage to $15 by 2025 would lift pay for nearly 
32 million workers—21% of the U.S. work-
force. Affected workers who work year-round 
would earn an extra $3,300 a year—enough to 
make a tremendous difference in the life of a

cashier, home health aide, or fast-food work-
er who today struggles to get by on less than 
$25,000 a year. A majority (59%) of workers 
whose total family income is below the pov-
erty line would receive a pay increase if the 
minimum wage were raised to $15 by 2025. 
Raising the minimum wage to $15 and 
eliminating subminimum wages will be par-
ticularly significant for workers of color and 
women workers, who have historically been 
pushed into the most underpaid paid jobs 
through occupational segregation. Passing 
the Raise the Wage Act would help narrow 
both the racial pay gap and the gender pay 
gap. Of those whose pay would increase, 
nearly 6 in 10 (59%) are women and more 
than a quarter (28%) have children. One- 
third (31%) of African-American workers and 
one-quarter (26%) of Latinx workers would 
get a raise if the federal minimum wage were 
increased to $15. Almost one in four (23%) of 
those people who would benefit is a Black or 
Latina woman. African-American workers 
and Latinx workers are paid 10–15% less than 
white workers with the same characteristics, 
so the Raise the Wage Act would deliver the 
largest benefits to Black and Latinx work-
ers—about $3,500 annually for a year-round 
worker. The Raise the Wage Act will also de-
liver increased wages to an estimated 1.45 
million LGBTQ workers and would reduce 
the proportion of male same-sex couples liv-
ing in poverty by one-third and female same- 
sex couples by almost one-half. There would 
be similar reductions in poverty among 
LGBTQ people who are not in same-sex cou-
ple households, with the largest gains for 
those with the highest rates of poverty— 
Black, Latinx, bisexual, and transgender 
adults. 
Raising wages has never been more urgent 
than during this pandemic. Essential and 
frontline workers make up a majority of 
those who would benefit from a $15 minimum 
wage. Members of Congress should do more 
than pay lip service to front line workers; 
they should make sure they get higher 
wages. The median pay is well under $15 an 
hour for many essential and frontline jobs; 
examples include substitute teachers, nurs-
ing assistants, and home health aides. More 
than one-third (35%) of those working in res-
idential or nursing care facilities would see 
their pay increase, in addition to home 
health aides and other health care support 
workers. One in three retail sector workers 
(36%) would get a raise, including 42% of 
workers in grocery stores. More than four-in- 
ten (43%) of janitors, housekeepers, and 
other cleaning workers would benefit. Nearly 
two-thirds (64%) of servers, cooks, and other 
food preparation workers would see their 
earnings rise by $5,800 on a year-round basis. 
For 6 million tipped food service workers, a 
majority female workforce, the subminimum 
wage for tipped workers is a legacy of slav-
ery that has been a source of poverty, sexual 
harassment, and exposure to health risks 
and hostile customers during the pandemic. 
Ten million workers in health care, edu-
cation, 
construction, 
and 
manufacturing 
would see a raise—representing nearly one- 
third (31%) of the workers who would see a 
raise. 
Contrary to what opponents of a living 
wage would argue, our economy can more 
than afford a $15 minimum wage. Workers 
earning the current federal minimum wage 
are paid less per hour in real dollars than 
their counterparts were paid 50 years ago. 
Businesses can afford to pay the most under-
paid worker in the U.S. today substantially 
more than what her counterpart was paid 
half a century ago. The economy has grown 
dramatically over the past 50 years, and 
workers are producing more from each hour 
of work, with productivity nearly doubling 
since the late 1960s. If the minimum wage 
had been raised at the same pace as produc-
tivity growth since the late 1960s, it would be 
over $20 an hour today. 
In fact, an immediate increase in the min-
imum wage is necessary for the health of our 
economy. A $15 minimum wage by 2025 would 
generate $107 billion in higher wages for 
workers and would also benefit communities 
across the country. Because underpaid work-
ers spend much of their extra earnings, this 
injection of wages will help stimulate the 
economy and spur greater business activity 
and job growth. 
It is long past time to pass the Raise the 
Wage Act of 2021—and we call on all Mem-
bers of Congress to finally give nearly 32 mil-
lion workers the raise they have fought so 
hard to secure.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will 
try to be relatively brief here. I under-
stand the bill is being printed now, and 
we will have a vote here fairly shortly. 
I just want to set the stage for my 
view—my point of view. I think I speak 
for most people in our conference on 
what we are trying to do here. 
Up until now, we have been able, as a 
body, to work together on COVID re-
lief. And the question is, Why can’t we 
do it again? I think I know the answer, 
but I want to remind people what we 
have done in a bipartisan fashion. 
On March 5, 2020, when we had Presi-
dent Trump, a Republican Senate, and 
a Democratic House, we approved $8 
billion, 96 to 1, and we were just begin-
ning to understand the virus; March 18, 
a few weeks later, $355 billion, 90 to 8; 
March 25, $1.9 trillion, 96 to 0. 
So from March 5 to March 25, we 
passed three bills, well over $2 trillion, 
96 to 1, 90 to 8, and 96 to 0. So I would 
argue to the American people that it is 
not like the Republican Party and the 
Democratic Party can’t work together 
when it comes to COVID relief. 
But now that the Democrats have the 
House, the Senate, and the White 
House, there seems to be no desire to 
go down that road, and I will talk 
about that in a minute. 
April 21, 2020, we did $355 billion 
more. That was by voice vote. Spend-
ing $355 by voice vote is pretty aston-
ishing; $1.9 trillion, 96 to 0 is pretty as-
tonishing. September 30, 2020, 84 to 10. 
December 21, just a few months ago, we 
spent another trillion, 92 to 6. 
Why do I bring this up? I bring it up 
to show there is plenty of bipartisan-
ship around COVID relief, and that bi-
partisanship has stopped. President 
Biden made a big deal about wanting to 
bring the country together and find 
common ground. In the one area that 
we actually had common ground, we 
have abandoned common ground to 
deal with a $1.9 trillion package just 
months after we authorized $1.04 tril-
lion. 
Here is the problem I think Repub-
licans have. Of the $1.9 trillion being 
proposed now, about 90 percent of it 
has very little to do with COVID. It is 
a liberal wish list. The reason I know it 
is a liberal wish list is that Senator 
SCHUMER
said 15 times yesterday— 
about 15 times—that it wasn’t a liberal 
wish list. If Senator SCHUMER is saying 
it is not a liberal wish list, it is a lib-
eral wish list. I will be able to prove 
that in more detail. 
That is the history of bipartisanship. 
That 
bipartisanship 
has 
been 
de-
stroyed. We had 10 Republicans, I 
think, go to the White House to offer 
around $700 billion that would extend 
checks, that would do vaccines, would 
do a lot of things that we think we 
need to still do, but that went nowhere. 
Another point for the American peo-
ple: We are going to a partisan ap-
proach to COVID for the first time. I 
went over the amount of money we 
have appropriated to the COVID prob-
lems the country has experienced, and 
here is what I want you to understand. 
We are going to spend $1.9 trillion in a 
partisan fashion. I think a lot of it is 
very much unrelated to COVID simply 
because they have the power to do it. 
They now have the power of the Fed-
eral Government, complete power— 
control of the Senate, control of the 
House, control of the White House. 
They have abandoned bipartisanship. 
We had the Presidency and the Senate; 
they had the House. We were able to 
work together. Now they have it all. 
They are running us over, literally, 
legislatively here. 
I think we have made reasonable of-
fers. Nobody is willing to compromise. 
They see this as a moment to do a lot 
of things they have been wanting to do 
for years that have nothing to do with 
COVID. 
Another problem they have, in my 
view, is you are appropriating $1.9 tril-
lion, most of it not related to COVID, 
and we haven’t spent the money we 
have allocated in the past. So adminis-
trative actions—there is still $200 bil-
lion that we haven’t spent. Legislative 
actions, $3.1 trillion we have spent. We 
have appropriated $4.1 trillion. There is 
still $1 trillion that hasn’t been spent 
yet. 
The Federal Reserve actions allowed 
$5.9 trillion to be allocated to help 
businesses that were failing. They 
spent $2.8 trillion. 
The vaccine is getting out by the 
day. We are hopeful that we can change 
the course of the virus, get people back 
to work. 
In this bill, they do a lot of things 
unrelated to COVID because they can. 
Why are we opposed to this? Because it 
is a lot of money that is being spent on 
things unrelated to COVID. We haven’t 
spent the money we appropriated in 
past efforts yet, but we are going to 
spend $1.9 trillion more. I think it is 
very unfortunate, and I hope the Amer-
ican people understand that this is 
spending money for the sake of spend-
ing money, not to combat COVID. 
Let me give you some examples of 
what is in this bill. The minimum wage 
dropped out. Now is the worst possible 
time, I think, to go to $15-an-hour min-
imum wage. Just think about your own 
communities. How many restaurants 
and hotels have had to reduce or close 
down because of COVID restrictions? 
We are finally beginning to come out of 
it a bit. To add a $15-an-hour mandate, 
doubling the minimum wage, would be 
increasing the cost of doing business 
after the government at the State and 
local levels shut the businesses down.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1050 
March 4, 2021 
So the business has been reduced in 
terms of revenue because of COVID re-
strictions, and now the Federal Gov-
ernment is going to mandate a dou-
bling of the minimum wage that the 
business has to absorb and pass on to 
consumers. That is out. We can raise 
the minimum wage in a responsible 
fashion once we get COVID under con-
trol. 
There was $100 million for a Silicon 
Valley underground rail project that 
didn’t pass the smell test. The only 
reason that is out is we made a big deal 
about it. But they saw the COVID 
package as a chance to put $100 million 
into a Silicon Valley underground rail 
project, which shows you their mindset 
toward this bill. 
This 
bill 
is 
not 
about 
fighting 
COVID. It is about a chance, in a par-
tisan 
fashion, 
to 
do 
things 
they 
couldn’t do otherwise. There was $1.5 
million from the Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund regarding the Seaway 
International Bridge in New York. The 
Silicon Valley underground rail project 
may make sense. Senator SCHUMER’s 
bridge project may make sense. We are 
going to do an infrastructure bill. It 
seems to me that we would take these 
infrastructure projects and put them in 
an infrastructure bill and try to have a 
COVID bill related to fighting COVID. 
But, clearly, they are taking an op-
portunity, my friends on the other 
side, of loading this bill up with a lib-
eral wish list—parochial interests—be-
cause they can. 
I hope the American people will un-
derstand what is going on and bring 
back a balance of power in Washington 
in 2022 because if you let them have it 
all, this is a sign of things to come. But 
we will talk about that later. 
There is $20 million in the bill for the 
preservation and maintenance of Na-
tive American languages. That might 
be something that makes sense, but we 
are dealing with a COVID package. 
There is $20 million for the preserva-
tion of maintenance of Native Amer-
ican languages and $135 million for the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
I am an appropriator. This isn’t an 
appropriations bill. It is not a COVID 
bill. In the committees I am on, we ac-
tually vet this stuff to see if it makes 
sense to put it in the normal appropria-
tions cycle. They take a COVID prob-
lem—and it is a real problem still to 
this day—and they load it up with 
things unrelated to COVID because 
they can. 
We can’t stop them now. Maybe one 
day we can stop them and go back to 
the old way of doing business where we 
sit down and work together as Demo-
crats and Republicans to spend over $4 
trillion to combat COVID. My hope is 
that we will have some balance in the 
future that we don’t have today. 
So $135 million for the National En-
dowment for the Humanities—what has 
that got to do with COVID? There are 
people really suffering out there. And 
$135 million for the Endowment for the 
Arts and $135 million for the Endow-
ment for Humanities, that is still a lot 
of money where I come from. 
There is $200 million for the Institute 
of Museum and Library Sciences. I am 
sure there are needs out there for mu-
seums and library sciences, but it 
should go through the appropriations 
process where we will have a chance to 
make a case for it or against it rather 
than it being crammed into a bill that 
is being printed while I speak. 
We are talking about a $1.9 trillion 
COVID package with 90 percent unre-
lated to COVID being printed while I 
speak. Now, if that is good govern-
ment, count me out. 
Funding for Planned Parenthood. 
What has that got to do with COVID? 
PPP loans for labor unions. 
Paid leave for Federal employees. 
An $86 billion bailout for union pen-
sions. Maybe that is something we 
want to look at, but in a COVID bill? 
This is why people are so turned off 
to Washington because we take a cri-
sis, a problem facing your family and 
your community, and they turn it into 
a spendfest, a liberal wish list, indeed, 
come true. 
A 
new 
taxpayer-funded 
executive 
branch employee emergency leave pro-
gram. 
Money for schools. We haven’t spent 
the money we have allocated for 
schools yet. We are trying to open 
schools. The money that has been allo-
cated for schools is still—most of it—a 
lot of it has been unspent. In this bill, 
we have $68 billion for K–12. The money 
should be given to people opening 
schools, and only $5 billion of that will 
be spent this year. Most of the money 
for K–12 assistance is in 2022 and the 
years that follow. That is not an emer-
gency COVID package. That is just 
putting money into the education sys-
tem in a fashion they like and we don’t 
have any input over. It really has noth-
ing to do with fighting the COVID cri-
sis and getting our schools reopened. Of 
the $129 billion for K–12 in this pack-
age, $6.4 billion is to be distributed this 
year. The $68 billion was in the last 
round and only $5 billion this year, so 
most of the money for schools is spent 
in the out years. Again, that is just an 
opportunity to be taken by them. 
Of the $129 billion, $122 billion for K– 
12 schools will not be spent until years 
2022 through 2028. God, I hope we don’t 
have to deal with COVID in 2028. 
We have approved six COVID bills. 
We have spent over $4 trillion—appro-
priated over $4 trillion. A trillion is yet 
unspent, and we are doing $1.9 trillion 
where 90 percent of it has nothing to do 
with COVID. Why are we doing this? 
Because they can. 
They have abandoned the bipartisan 
model that worked. They have chosen a 
partisan model. No matter what they 
tell you, my friends on the other side, 
this is a liberal wish list. This is very 
much seizing the moment, taking a cri-
sis, a problem in America, and using it 
to advance causes completely unre-
lated to COVID, spending money that 
hasn’t been vetted, spending money 
that has nothing to do with COVID be-
cause they can. 
The only thing I can tell you about 
spending money—count me in for help-
ing people get back on their feet. I 
have always been for a direct payment. 
Count me out for a $1.9 trillion 
spendfest unrelated to COVID in a par-
tisan fashion. 
This is everything President Biden 
said he wouldn’t do. The inaugural 
speech rings hollow when it comes to 
this provision, the $1.9 trillion COVID 
package. Everything President Biden 
said he wanted to do for the country, 
he abandoned. It is not like there are 
plenty of Republicans that would sit 
down and work with our Democratic 
friends to do another round of COVID 
relief, but it has to be related to 
COVID, and we want to spend the 
money we have appropriated in the 
past first. Maybe that is an odd con-
cept in Washington, but I will make a 
bet that most Americans find it odd 
that we would appropriate money for a 
problem when we haven’t spent the 
money we had already appropriated in 
the past. We can get that out the door 
to see what needs to be done in the fu-
ture. 
I think most Americans believe now 
is not the time to load a bill up with a 
bunch of stuff unrelated to COVID be-
cause we need every dollar to hit the 
mark. But we will have a chance to 
talk about that in the coming months, 
and there will be another election com-
ing before you know it. 
The only thing I can leave with the 
American people here is that they have 
it all in terms of power. This is what 
they have chosen to do. They have cho-
sen a partisan path, rejecting the bi-
partisan path. They have chosen to put 
most of the money in the bill for things 
unrelated to COVID simply because 
they can. 
The last election was about what 
would happen to our country if Demo-
crats got in charge of everything. 
Many of us on our side said it would be 
one of the most liberal agendas in the 
history of American politics and would 
come forth pretty quickly. I had no 
idea it would come forth this quickly. 
I had no idea they would abandon a bi-
partisan approach to COVID because it 
seems to be the one area that we have 
had success regarding working to-
gether. 
During the campaign, I said that 
there would be two areas I thought we 
could do bipartisan legislation: One 
was COVID; the other was infrastruc-
ture. 
Boy, was I wrong about COVID. I am 
hoping that the American people pay 
some attention to this debate. We are 
going to have some really good amend-
ments on our side that talk about how 
we would spend the money differently 
and why we would choose not to spend 
some money on this bill because it sim-
ply has nothing to do with COVID. 
The American people have suffered 
during the COVID pandemic, but there 
are better days ahead. I want us to do

as much as we can for vaccinations and 
helping people get back into school. I 
am willing to help people who are 
struggling out there, but you shouldn’t 
be giving a $1,400 check to people who 
make 
$200,000 
as 
a 
couple. 
They 
changed that. They have taken the Sil-
icon Valley railway out. They have 
also taken the bridge out because they 
had to, not because they wanted to. 
We are going to have a lot of amend-
ments to show what we would do with 
your money versus what they would do 
with your money. We are going to have 
a lot of amendments that would show 
what we would do with COVID and how 
to fight COVID versus what they would 
do with COVID. That is what democ-
racy is all about—working together 
when you can and showing differences 
when you must. 
There are going to be a lot of dif-
ferences in this debate, and I think this 
will not be the last time you hear 
about this bill. I think this bill is going 
to resonate for months and years to 
come in all of the wrong ways. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021—MOTION TO PROCEED 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
moment, I will move to proceed to the 
Senate’s substitute amendment to the 
American Rescue Plan. This legislation 
will keep America’s families, busi-
nesses, and workers afloat and hasten 
the day when our country can return to 
normal and our economy can come 
roaring back. 
The United States is facing a once-in- 
a-century crisis that has sapped mil-
lions of jobs from our economy, left 
millions of Americans struggling to 
make ends meet, and stolen more than 
half a million American lives. The time 
is now to move forward with big, bold, 
strong relief for the American people; 
to send checks as promised to Amer-
ican workers and families; to help re-
open schools as quickly and safely as 
possible; to help the hardest hit small 
businesses hang on; to help families 
stay in their homes, care for their chil-
dren, and put food on the table; to keep 
firefighters, teachers, and busdrivers 
on the job; and to crush the virus with 
testing and vaccines once and for all. 
We are not going to repeat the mis-
takes of the past. We are not going to 
be timid in the face of a great chal-
lenge. We are not going to delay when 
urgent action is called for. We are not 
going to quit before the race is won. We 
are going to sprint through the finish 
line. 
It is time to move forward with this 
legislation, which will be one of the 
largest single anti-poverty bills in re-
cent history. It is time to lift this 
country out of crisis and set it on a 
path to a strong and swift recovery. It 
is time to tell the American people 
that help is on the way. 
MOTION TO PROCEED 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
move to proceed to Calendar No. 10, 
H.R. 1319. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will report the motion.

(b) ADVANCE PAYMENT OF CREDIT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 77 of such Code is 
amended by inserting after section 7527 the 
following new section: 
‘‘SEC. 7527A. ADVANCE PAYMENT OF CHILD TAX 
CREDIT. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall es-
tablish a program for making periodic pay-
ments to taxpayers which, in the aggregate 
during any calendar year, equal the annual 
advance amount determined with respect to 
such taxpayer for such calendar year. Except 
as provided in subsection (b)(3)(B), the peri-
odic payments made to any taxpayer for any 
calendar year shall be in equal amounts. 
‘‘(b) ANNUAL ADVANCE AMOUNT.—For pur-
poses of this section— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as otherwise pro-
vided in this subsection, the term ‘annual 
advance amount’ means, with respect to any 
taxpayer for any calendar year, the amount 
(if any) which is estimated by the Secretary 
as being equal to 50 percent of the amount 
which would be treated as allowed under sub-
part C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 
1 by reason of section 24(i)(1) for the tax-
payer’s taxable year beginning in such cal-
endar year if— 
‘‘(A) the status of the taxpayer as a tax-
payer described in section 24(i)(1) is deter-
mined with respect to the reference taxable 
year, 
‘‘(B) the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross 
income for such taxable year is equal to the 
taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income 
for the reference taxable year, 
‘‘(C) the only children of such taxpayer for 
such taxable year are qualifying children 
properly claimed on the taxpayer’s return of 
tax for the reference taxable year, and 
‘‘(D) the ages of such children (and the sta-
tus of such children as qualifying children) 
are determined for such taxable year by tak-
ing into account the passage of time since 
the reference taxable year. 
‘‘(2) REFERENCE TAXABLE YEAR.—Except as 
provided in paragraph (3)(A), the term ‘ref-
erence taxable year’ means, with respect to 
any taxpayer for any calendar year, the tax-
payer’s taxable year beginning in the pre-
ceding calendar year or, in the case of tax-
payer who did not file a return of tax for 
such taxable year, the taxpayer’s taxable 
year beginning in the second preceding cal-
endar year. 
‘‘(3) 
MODIFICATIONS
DURING
CALENDAR 
YEAR.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary may 
modify, during any calendar year, the annual 
advance amount with respect to any tax-
payer for such calendar year to take into ac-
count— 
‘‘(i) a return of tax filed by such taxpayer 
during such calendar year (and the taxable 
year to which such return relates may be 
taken into account as the reference taxable 
year), and 
‘‘(ii) any other information provided by the 
taxpayer to the Secretary which allows the 
Secretary to determine payments under sub-
section (a) which, in the aggregate during 
any taxable year of the taxpayer, more close-
ly total the Secretary’s estimate of the 
amount treated as allowed under subpart C 
of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 by 
reason of section 24(i)(1) for such taxable 
year of such taxpayer. 
‘‘(B) ADJUSTMENT
TO
REFLECT
EXCESS
OR 
DEFICIT IN PRIOR PAYMENTS.—In the case of 
any modification of the annual advance 
amount under subparagraph (A), the Sec-
retary may adjust the amount of any peri-
odic payment made after the date of such 
modification to properly take into account 
the amount by which any periodic payment 
made before such date was greater than or 
less than the amount that such payment 
would have been on the basis of the annual 
advance amount as so modified. 
‘‘(4) DETERMINATION
OF
STATUS.—If infor-
mation contained in the taxpayer’s return of 
tax for the reference taxable year does not 
establish the status of the taxpayer as being 
described in section 24(i)(1), the Secretary 
shall, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A), deter-
mine such status based on information 
known to the Secretary. 
‘‘(5) TREATMENT
OF
CERTAIN
DEATHS.—A 
child shall not be taken into account in de-
termining the annual advance amount under 
paragraph (1) if the death of such child is 
known to the Secretary as of the beginning 
of the calendar year for which the estimate 
under such paragraph is made. 
‘‘(c) ON-LINE
INFORMATION
PORTAL.—The 
Secretary shall establish an on-line portal 
which allows taxpayers to— 
‘‘(1) elect not to receive payments under 
this section, and 
‘‘(2) provide information to the Secretary 
which would be relevant to a modification 
under subsection (b)(3)(B) of the annual ad-
vance amount, including information regard-
ing— 
‘‘(A) a change in the number of the tax-
payer’s qualifying children, including by rea-
son of the birth of a child, 
‘‘(B) a change in the taxpayer’s marital 
status, 
‘‘(C) a significant change in the taxpayer’s 
income, and 
‘‘(D) any other factor which the Secretary 
may provide.

January 31 of the calendar year following 
any calendar year during which the Sec-
retary makes one or more payments to any 
taxpayer under this section, the Secretary 
shall provide such taxpayer with a written 
notice which includes the taxpayer’s tax-
payer 
identity 
(as 
defined 
in 
section 
6103(b)(6)), the aggregate amount of such 
payments made to such taxpayer during such 
calendar year, and such other information as 
the Secretary determines appropriate. 
‘‘(e) ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.— 
‘‘(1) APPLICATION OF ELECTRONIC FUNDS PAY-
MENT REQUIREMENT.—The payments made by 
the Secretary under subsection (a) shall be 
made by electronic funds transfer to the 
same extent and in the same manner as if 
such payments were Federal payments not 
made under this title.

similar to the rules of subparagraphs (B) and 
(C) of section 6428A(f)(3) shall apply for pur-
poses of this section.

OFF-
SET.—Any payment made to any individual 
under this section shall not be—

ant to subsection (c), (d), (e), or (f) of section 
6402, or 
‘‘(B) reduced or offset by other assessed 
Federal taxes that would otherwise be sub-
ject to levy or collection. 
‘‘(4) APPLICATION OF ADVANCE PAYMENTS IN 
THE POSSESSIONS OF THE UNITED STATES.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The advance payment 
amount determined under this section shall 
be determined— 
‘‘(i) by applying section 24(i)(1) without re-
gard to the phrase ‘or is a bona fide resident

tion 937(a))’, and 
‘‘(ii) 
without 
regard 
to 
section 
24(k)(3)(C)(ii)(I).

the income tax law of such possession unless 
such possession elects to have this section be

‘‘(C) ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF ADVANCE 
PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) MIRROR CODE POSSESSIONS.—In the case 
of any possession described in subparagraph 
(B) which makes the election described in

creased by $300,000 if such possession has a 
plan, which has been approved by the Sec-
retary, for making advance payments con-
sistent with such election. 
‘‘(ii) AMERICAN SAMOA.—The amount other-
wise paid by the Secretary to American 
Samoa under subparagraph (A) of section

CREDIT.—Section 24 of such Code, as amended 
by the preceding provision of this Act, is

‘‘(j) RECONCILIATION
OF
CREDIT
AND
AD-
VANCE CREDIT.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The amount of the credit 
allowed under this section to any taxpayer 
for any taxable year shall be reduced (but 
not below zero) by the aggregate amount of 
payments made under section 7527A to such 
taxpayer during such taxable year. Any fail-
ure to so reduce the credit shall be treated as 
arising out of a mathematical or clerical 
error and assessed according to section 
6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(2) EXCESS ADVANCE PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the aggregate amount 
of payments under section 7527A to the tax-
payer during the taxable year exceeds the 
amount of the credit allowed under this sec-
tion to such taxpayer for such taxable year 
(determined without regard to paragraph 
(1)), the tax imposed by this chapter for such 
taxable year shall be increased by the 
amount of such excess. Any failure to so in-
crease the tax shall be treated as arising out 
of a mathematical or clerical error and as-
sessed according to section 6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(B) SAFE HARBOR BASED ON MODIFIED AD-
JUSTED GROSS INCOME.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a taxpayer 
whose modified adjusted gross income (as de-
fined in subsection (b)) for the taxable year 
does not exceed 200 percent of the applicable 
income threshold, the amount of the in-
crease determined under subparagraph (A) 
with respect to such taxpayer for such tax-
able year shall be reduced (but not below 
zero) by the safe harbor amount. 
‘‘(ii) PHASE OUT OF SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.— 
In the case of a taxpayer whose modified ad-
justed gross income (as defined in subsection 
(b)) for the taxable year exceeds the applica-
ble 
income 
threshold, 
the 
safe 
harbor 
amount otherwise in effect under clause (i) 
shall be reduced by the amount which bears 
the same ratio to such amount as such ex-
cess bears to the applicable income thresh-
old. 
‘‘(iii) APPLICABLE INCOME THRESHOLD.—For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘ap-
plicable income threshold’ means— 
‘‘(I) $60,000 in the case of a joint return or 
surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(a)), 
‘‘(II) $50,000 in the case of a head of house-
hold, and

not be filed by an eligible multiemployer 
plan unless— 
‘‘(A) the eligible multiemployer plan is in-
solvent or is likely to become insolvent 
within 5 years of the date of enactment of 
this section; 
‘‘(B) the corporation projects the eligible 
multiemployer plan to have a present value 
of financial assistance payments under sec-
tion 4261 that exceeds $1,000,000,000 if the spe-
cial financial assistance is not ordered; 
‘‘(C) the eligible multiemployer plan has 
implemented benefit suspensions under sec-
tion 305(e)(9) as of the date of the enactment 
of this section; or 
‘‘(D) the corporation determines it appro-
priate based on other similar circumstances. 
‘‘(e) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) ELIGIBILITY.—For purposes of deter-
mining eligibility for special financial assist-
ance, the corporation shall accept assump-
tions incorporated in a multiemployer plan’s 
determination that it is in critical status or 
critical and declining status (within the 
meaning of section 305(b)) for certifications 
of plan status completed before January 1, 
2021, unless such assumptions are clearly er-
roneous. For certifications of plan status 
completed after December 31, 2020, a plan 
shall determine whether it is in critical or 
critical and declining status for purposes of 
eligibility for special financial assistance by 
using the assumptions that the plan used in 
its most recently completed certification of 
plan status before January 1, 2021, unless 
such assumptions (excluding the plan’s inter-
est rate) are unreasonable. 
‘‘(2) AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.—In 
determining the amount of special financial 
assistance in its application, an eligible mul-
tiemployer plan shall— 
‘‘(A) use the interest rate used by the plan 
in its most recently completed certification 
of plan status before January 1, 2021, pro-
vided that such interest rate may not exceed 
the interest rate limit; and 
‘‘(B) for other assumptions, use the as-
sumptions that the plan used in its most re-
cently completed certification of plan status 
before January 1, 2021, unless such assump-
tions are unreasonable. 
‘‘(3) INTEREST
RATE
LIMIT.—The interest 
rate limit for purposes of this subsection is 
the rate specified in section 303(h)(2)(C)(iii) 
(disregarding 
modifications 
made 
under 
clause (iv) of such section) for the month in 
which the application for special financial 
assistance is filed by the eligible multiem-
ployer plan or the 3 preceding months, with 
such specified rate increased by 200 basis 
points. 
‘‘(4) CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS.—If a plan de-
termines that use of one or more prior as-
sumptions is unreasonable, the plan may 
propose in its application to change such as-
sumptions, provided that the plan discloses 
such changes in its application and describes 
why such assumptions are no longer reason-
able. The corporation shall accept such 
changed assumptions unless it determines 
the changes are unreasonable, individually 
or in the aggregate. The plan may not pro-
pose a change to the interest rate otherwise 
required under this subsection for eligibility 
or financial assistance amount. 
‘‘(f) APPLICATION DEADLINE.—Any applica-
tion by a plan for special financial assistance 
under this section shall be submitted to the 
corporation (and, in the case of a plan to 
which section 432(k)(1)(D) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 applies, to the Sec-
retary of the Treasury) no later than Decem-
ber 31, 2025, and any revised application for 
special financial assistance shall be sub-
mitted no later than December 31, 2026. 
‘‘(g) DETERMINATIONS ON APPLICATIONS.—A 
plan’s application for special financial as-
sistance under this section that is timely 
filed in accordance with the regulations or 
guidance issued under subsection (c) shall be 
deemed approved unless the corporation no-
tifies the plan within 120 days of the filing of 
the application that the application is in-
complete, any proposed change or assump-
tion is unreasonable, or the plan is not eligi-
ble under this section. Such notice shall 
specify the reasons the plan is ineligible for 
special financial assistance, any proposed 
change or assumption is unreasonable, or in-
formation is needed to complete the applica-
tion. If a plan is denied assistance under this 
subsection, the plan may submit a revised 
application under this section. Any revised 
application for special financial assistance 
submitted by a plan shall be deemed ap-
proved unless the corporation notifies the 
plan within 120 days of the filing of the re-
vised application that the application is in-
complete, any proposed change or assump-
tion is unreasonable, or the plan is not eligi-
ble under this section. Special financial as-
sistance issued by the corporation shall be 
effective on a date determined by the cor-
poration, but no later than 1 year after a 
plan’s special financial assistance applica-
tion is approved by the corporation or 
deemed approved. The corporation shall not 
pay any special financial assistance after 
September 30, 2030. 
‘‘(h) MANNER OF PAYMENT.—The payment 
made by the corporation to an eligible mul-
tiemployer plan under this section shall be 
made as a single, lump sum payment. 
‘‘(i) AMOUNT AND MANNER OF SPECIAL FI-
NANCIAL ASSISTANCE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Special financial assist-
ance under this section shall be a transfer of 
funds in the amount necessary as dem-
onstrated by the plan sponsor on the applica-
tion for such special financial assistance, in 
accordance with the requirements described 
in subsection (j). Special financial assistance 
shall be paid to such plan as soon as prac-
ticable upon approval of the application by 
the corporation. 
‘‘(2) NO CAP.—Special financial assistance 
granted by the corporation under this sec-
tion shall not be capped by the guarantee 
under 4022A. 
‘‘(j) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF SPECIAL 
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The amount of financial 
assistance provided to a multiemployer plan 
eligible for financial assistance under this 
section shall be such amount required for the 
plan to pay all benefits due during the period 
beginning on the date of payment of the spe-
cial financial assistance payment under this 
section and ending on the last day of the 
plan year ending in 2051, with no reduction 
in a participant’s or beneficiary’s accrued 
benefit as of the date of enactment of this 
section, except to the extent of a reduction 
in accordance with section 305(e)(8) adopted 
prior to the plan’s application for special fi-
nancial assistance under this section, and 
taking into account the reinstatement of 
benefits required under subsection (k). 
‘‘(2) PROJECTIONS.—The funding projections 
for purposes of this section shall be per-
formed on a deterministic basis.

MORNING BUSINESS 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JOHN LAIRD 
∑
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
John Laird of Liberty County. John 
embodies the American dream and ex-
hibits strong Montana values. 
In 1887, John’s ancestors came to 
America from Scotland looking for a 
better life. John’s ancestors home-
steaded in the Sweet Grass Hills region 
that surrounds present day Chester, 
MT. They built a large sheep farm and 
broke horses for the Canadian Guards. 
Farming is hard work and not for the 
faint of heart, but John’s family per-
severed. 
The land was passed down from gen-
eration to generation. John is a proud 
wheat farmer of those hills today, mov-
ing the same rocks as his great-great- 
grandfathers did. John and his wife, 
Rita, raised their three children, Cory, 
Heather, and Mitchell, on this land. All 
three of their children attended Mon-
tana schools and universities and have 
gone on to start families of their own. 
The Laird family story highlights the 
agricultural history of Montana, and 
the tenacity and legacy of those who 
immigrated to the United States seek-
ing to create a better life. It is my 
honor to recognize John Laird as a suc-
cessful farmer and father and for lead-
ing a life that represents everything 
Montanans hold dear.∑

VERMONT STATE OF THE UNION 
ESSAY CONTEST FINALISTS 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
ask to have printed in the RECORD 
some of the finalists’ essays written by 
Vermont High School students as part 
of the 11th annual ‘‘State of the Union’’ 
essay contest conducted by my office. 
The material follows: 
FINALISTS 
EH KA LUU, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR 
‘‘Don’t hold a guy’s hand; you’ll get preg-
nant,’’ my mom informed me as I sat on the 
toilet, looking at the well wrapped square. I 
engraved those words in my mind. My whole 
6th grade year, I avoided the hands of the op-
posite gender, by keeping my hands in the 
pocket of my hoodie due to my moms version 
of sex education. Yet, in seventh grade I had 
Health class, where curiosity got the best of 
me. 
‘‘Mrs- where do babies come from?’’ I 
looked up and back down, she smiled and ex-
plained everything to me, this was where 
things started to make sense. I realized that 
I’ve been lied to by my own mother. I had 
questions. ‘‘Why do some parents avoid such 
topic?’’ and ‘‘why do schools not teach prop-
er sex education?’’ In this essay, I’m going to 
address the need for parents to educate their 
kids. Schools teaching students about sex 
and being welcoming to every gender. 
I think Sexual education should be taught 
at a very early age. Most kids start to get 
sexually actively around middle school. In 
my research on ‘‘Sex Positive Families’’, I 
found that most parents think that if they 
talk to their kids about such a topic, their 
kids will wanna do it. However, this proves 
to be incorrect as most of the time, kids will 
consider the options and pause on their sex-
ual activity. Parents need to start normal-
izing sex and understand that its an act that 
will be committed, one day. If youth are 
given the accurate information they will bet-
ter protect themselves. In my research kids 
who understand the consequences of being 
sexually active. Better protect themselves 
by using birth control methods and using 
condoms so they don’t contract sexually 
transmitted infections (STI). 
In a quiet room filled with my fellow sen-
iors, I broke the silence with a question. 
‘‘Where did you guys learn about sex?’’ It 
was revealed that most had obtained the in-
formation by either using sources like google 
or from their peers, but we have school to 
teach us right? In high school, it is expected 
that you learn about these topics but in this 
generation, kids are starting to explore at a 
much younger age, the earliest being the 
start of middle school. 
Not all states are required to teach sex 
education in a structure way. Some states, 
such as Alabama and Arizona, don’t even 
teach the subject at all. They preach absti-
nence to their students and tell them to wait 
till marriage to have intercourses. Schools 
should teach safe sex and ways on how to 
prevent STIs. Schools should talk about dif-
ferent types of birth control that are avail-
able. It’s also important to include informa-
tion for students with different sexuality. In 
a video by Above the Noise, ‘‘Sex education 
in America: The good, The bad, and The 
ugly’’, high school students shared their 
thoughts on the current Sex Education. One 
student talked about how it doesn’t include 
people in the LGBTQIA+ community. School 
needs to provide to students that have dif-
ferent sexuality, they shound teach sex be-
tween non heterosexual people as well. It’s 
very important to help kids understand safe-
ty no matter their sexual orientation. 
The topic of sex should be normalized and 
talked more about to people at a very young 
age. To help kids understand the changes in 
their body and explore their sexuality. Par-
ents should have conversations about sex 
and the human body to their kids. School 
should include people with different sexu-
ality. If we do these things, teenager would 
have the knowledge and ability to protect 
themselves and weigh their options when it 
come to safe sex. 
KADA ORLOW, BURLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, 
FRESHMAN 
My sister and I were very little when my 
mom became our only parent. She was all by 
herself, with no ‘‘safety net’’, as she calls it. 
We were left with nothing but each other. 
She struggled with lack of money, food scar-
city, and sometimes there were issues with 
places to live. As I grew older, I began to see 
the struggles that not only my mom, but 
many other families face when trying to 
raise a family and dig themselves out of a 
hole. I’ve listened to my mom explain to me 
many times, how impossible it is for one per-
son to raise a family, to have to be in two 
places at once, while trying to get us off to 
daycare or school, and to try and hold down 
a regular job (no longer a career as she may 
have had long before), and to just keep going 
no matter what, because you can’t stop. 
Stopping or resting is never an option. Some 
of the issues that my mom recently was 
asked to speak about at a press conference 
have to do with exactly that. My mom spoke 
for, and represented those people, that typi-
cally are not heard; the single parents and 
the sole parents. She offered solutions that 
would help make things easier, better for 
others, if only they could be put into prac-
tice everyone would benefit. Now, it is my 
turn to speak up for an issue I believe needs 
to be addressed in our society. 
The system itself for single mothers is like 
quicksand, it doesn’t matter how hard you 
try, you just get exhausted. You will never 
get out of it, but you just keep pushing. My 
mom resigned her promotion and went back 
to working part-time so that she and her 
family could survive. This shows that par-
ents are forced to practically choose between

providing for their children, and being with 
them. With no other options, parents are 
prevented from raising their children, just so 
they don’t lose the benefits for their kids. 
Even when single parents work, the wages 
are not enough to support a family. Working 
full-time for $10 an hour is only about $19,000 
a year. This fact explains many single par-
ents’ realities that are never ending. Min-
imum wage jobs do not pay enough to sup-
port a family. However, single parents can 
prevail. My mom shared that ‘‘The single 
moms I know are some of the most mentally- 
strong people I’ve ever met, and no matter 
what, they prevail.’’ This piece of evidence 
shows that there is no option to give up, you 
have to keep pushing no matter what the cir-
cumstance is. In the end, there really is no 
way of getting out of this everlasting loop-
hole, unless you are thrown a lifeline. 
Technology provides many of the answers 
to these problems. The solutions are there, 
they would benefit not only single parents, 
but eventually in the long run, it would ben-
efit everyone. An online database and one- 
stop 
shop: 
housing, 
services, 
food, 
healthcare. Just one simple example of a so-
lution that can be extremely beneficial be-
cause it can be used for different things and 
in different ways. All the government assist-
ance programs being in one, easy to access 
place would make it simpler for single par-
ents to get the support they need, and that 
tax dollars are paying for. Technology could 
help in other ways as well. Imagine you are 
a single mom,there is no one else at home to 
leave your other child(ren) with, while you 
rush the sick one to the emergency room. 
—If you could use an app like pingmd.com 
app, all you would have to do is ‘‘ping’’ your 
doctor directly, share photos, and list out 
the symptoms. This would save time before 
scheduling an appointment and visiting a 
doctor (time the parents are usually at 
work), and take some of the expenses out of 
visiting a doctor. There are new solutions 
being made everyday in order to make life 
for single parent’s easier, this being one of 
them. Parent’s that don’t have enough time 
in the day to record everything that their 
child is doing, ex: soccer games, presen-
tations, first day of school experiences, etc. 
This is now being solved with a page called 
Kidlee. This is another example that will 
help not only single parents right now, but 
even parents that just don’t have time for it. 
These solutions are only the beginning, if 
only they were acted upon, single parents 
could get the assistance they need. 
ELLA PARTLOW, MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH 
SCHOOL, JUNIOR 
At such a significant time in their lives for 
personal development, teenagers are one of 
the most vulnerable age groups when it 
comes to mental health. According to the 
National Institute of Medicine, twenty-five 
percent of Americans experience at least one 
depressive episode prior to adulthood. More 
concerning, however, is that the World 
Health Organization found that many such 
conditions are ignored; an estimated fifteen 
percent of teenagers’ mental health condi-
tions go ‘‘underdiagnosed and undertreated’’. 
This 
elucidates 
that 
adolescent 
mental 
health is not often made a priority. The 
mental health of American teenagers needs 
to be taken more seriously. 
When teenage mental health is neglected, 
it becomes an even more pressing issue. Re-
flecting the detrimental effects of a poor 
mental health care system, the rates of self 
harm and suicide in America have increased 
in recent years. The General Hospital of Psy-
chiatry says that in the past two decades 
emergency room visits in America for self 
inflicted harm in all age groups have in-
creased; albeit, these visits were most com-
mon among ages fifteen to nineteen. Addi-
tionally, data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention explains that there 
was a thirty percent increase in suicides 
from years 2000 to 2016. This illuminates that 
ignoring the mental health of America’s 
youth puts their safety and lives in jeopardy. 
In order to solve this problem, it is vital 
that funding for mental health education 
programs and support services are increased. 
The Journal of Adolescent Health identifies 
‘‘insurance restrictions, poor funding, and 
low priorities for resources’’ as the ‘‘key ob-
stacles’’ preventing teenagers from seeking 
necessary help. A widespread lack of edu-
cation regarding mental health also contrib-
utes to this problem, says The American 
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psy-
chology. A step towards prioritizing teenage 
mental health, increased funding and edu-
cation would result in teenagers feeling sup-
ported and having better access to mental 
health services. 
Furthermore, better funding and education 
will allow for the improvement of on campus 
mental health service. First, it is necessary 
that the presence of these services on school 
campuses are increased. In a report from the 
National Research Council and Institute of 
Medicine, adolescents were more likely to 
receive mental health services when on site 
services were easily available. Second, diver-
sity, identified by the report as a key compo-
nent to effective on campus mental health 
services, should be considered; a more di-
verse group of health care professionals leads 
to lower dropout rates in mental health pro-
grams, and misdiagnosis of mental illness 
decreased when there were fewer cultural dif-
ferences between provider and patient. Ame-
liorating on campus services by increasing 
and diversifying them will encourage teen-
agers to seek help and normalize doing so, 
creating an atmosphere where youth can 
comfortably discuss their mental health 
without fear of being treated as insignifi-
cant. 
Moreover, improving the funding, edu-
cation, and available services surrounding 
teen mental health will allow us to make 
this issue a larger priority in America. In 
doing this, we take care of our youth and im-
prove their quality of life.∑

REMEMBERING SAM TAYLOR 
∑
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I 
rise today with my colleague, the sen-
ior Senator from North Carolina, to 
honor the life and work of Sam Taylor, 
the president of North Carolina Bio-
sciences Organization. Sam was a giant 
in our State and a leading voice for our 
vital and innovative life sciences and 
biopharmaceutical sector. A native 
North Carolinian, his love for his home 
State and his commitment to its future 
always shone through. He was a grad-
uate of North Carolina State Univer-
sity, and he received his law degree 
with high honors from the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
Sam was a dedicated and energetic 
voice for the biosciences and a terrific 
partner to those in government and the 
private sector committed to promoting 
those industries. This sector has seen 
remarkable growth in recent years: 
since 2016, increasing its employment 
base by 10 percent to reach more than 
83,000 jobs in 2018 across 4,210 business 
establishments. Between 2016 and 2019, 
the biosciences has attracted more 
than $1.5 billion in venture capital in-
vestment to North Carolina. These suc-
cesses were in no small part due to 
Sam and his tireless leadership and ad-
vocacy. 
Sam was one of the founders of NC 
BIO in 1994, long before most people 
grasped the industry’s potential. His 
advocacy in the business community, 
in Raleigh, in Washington, and around 
the world made a huge difference. 
Whether promoting our world-class 
universities, our startups, or more es-
tablished companies, Sam was always 
there with the facts, the vision, and 
the sheer force of will to move our 
State forward. He worked for the cre-
ation of the NCBioImpact training col-
laborative with the NC Community 
College System’s BioNetwork program, 
as well as the Biomanufacturing Train-
ing and Education Center at North 
Carolina State University and the Bio-
manufacturing Research Institute and 
Technology 
Enterprise 
program 
at 
North Carolina Central University. 
Sam’s work was recognized by the 
North Carolina Council for Entrepre-
neurial Development in 2005 with the 
Chairman’s Service Award. He received 
the Life Science Conference Leadership 
Award in 2012 and the Life Science 
Award from Triangle Business Journal 
in 2015. Just recently and most signifi-
cantly, he received our State’s highest 
honor, the Order of the Long Leaf Pine. 
To say Sam was a giant among men is 
an understatement. He was a leader 
and a visionary, someone who truly 
wanted to make our State and world a 
better place. 
North Carolinians have lost a loyal 
son and a tireless advocate. We have 
lost a friend and colleague. Today, we 
ask every member of this body to join 
us in honoring the life and amazing 
legacy of Sam Taylor. Our State and 
the people of the United States are 
grateful for his life of service, and we 
know that North Carolina will con-
tinue to be one of our Nation’s life 
science innovation hubs in no small 
part due to him.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
95—RECOG-
NIZING THE DISPROPORTIONATE 
IMPACT OF COVID–19 ON WOMEN 
AND GIRLS GLOBALLY 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mrs. MUR-
RAY, and Mr. WYDEN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 95 
Whereas the COVID–19 crisis exacerbates 
existing vulnerabilities for women and girls 
and has an outsized effect on health, safety, 
and livelihoods for marginalized commu-
nities; 
Whereas it is estimated that the disruption 
of sexual and reproductive health care serv-
ices and supply chains caused by the COVID– 
19 crisis caused an estimated 49,000,000 
women to stop using contraceptives during 
just the first 6 months of the crisis, likely 
resulting in approximately 7,000,000 unin-
tended pregnancies, 1,700,000 major obstetric 
complications, 28,000 maternal deaths, 168,000 
newborn deaths, and 3,300,000 unsafe abor-
tions; 
Whereas lockdowns, quarantines, and other 
movement restrictions related to COVID–19 
have disrupted access to legal and social 
services, as well as access to counseling, safe 
shelters, and medical treatment, exacer-
bating vulnerabilities for women and girls; 
Whereas gender-based violence, such as do-
mestic violence, child marriage, and female 
genital mutilation, has increased, and is ex-
pected to continue to increase, as a result of 
the COVID–19 crisis, including— 
(1) an estimated 31,000,000 more gender- 
based violence cases during the first 6 
months of shutdowns; 
(2) an additional 13,000,000 child marriages 
by 2030; and 
(3) an increase of approximately 2,000,000 
cases of female genital mutilation between 
2020 and 2030; 
Whereas women play significant roles in 
the health care workforce, comprising 70 per-
cent of health care workers globally, yet 
often are not prioritized for the receipt of 
personal protective equipment, dispropor-
tionately exposing them to contracting 
COVID–19; 
Whereas women and girls perform 3 times 
the amount of unpaid care work in homes 
and in their communities as men, a burden 
that has increased during the COVID–19 cri-
sis as women and girls are disproportion-
ately responsible for caring for sick and el-
derly family and community members and 
children who are out of school, limiting the 
ability of women and girls to perform in-
come-generating work, pursue education or 
skills building, or avoid exposure to COVID– 
19; 
Whereas, globally, women living in poverty 
will endure specific economic effects as a re-
sult of the COVID–19 crisis, largely due to 
the overrepresentation of those women in 
the informal economy, the increase in their 
unpaid care burdens, and the particular 
hardships facing female entrepreneurs, such 
as— 
(1) loss of jobs or pressure to turn to ex-
ploitative work, as women workers dominate 
in industries most affected by layoffs caused 
by the COVID–19 crisis, including hospi-
tality, childcare, and tourism, and comprise

March 4, 2021 
92 percent of individuals in the informal sec-
tor, which lacks social and legal protections 
in most countries; 
(2) loss of business, as market closures, dis-
ruptions in global trading, and the collapse 
of supply chains have disproportionate ef-
fects on female-led businesses and female 
farmers, and enduring gaps in financial in-
clusion will have significant ramifications as 
women entrepreneurs continue to be consid-
ered high risk for bank services, formal 
loans, and credit; 
(3) financial insecurity, as women have 
much lower, if any, pensions, retirement sav-
ings, or other assets to mitigate shocks as 
compared to men; and 
(4) loss of necessary income that female- 
headed households depend on, such as remit-
tances, which the World Bank expects will 
decrease by nearly 20 percent in 2020; 
Whereas the COVID–19 crisis will uniquely 
affect women in agriculture, who provide 
more than 43 percent of the agricultural 
labor around the world and more than 60 per-
cent of such labor in Africa yet whose ability 
to harvest, sell, and buy food and other prod-
ucts necessary for their food security and 
nutrition will worsen due to travel restric-
tions related to the crisis, ongoing discrimi-
nation in access to agricultural inputs and 
markets, and wage gaps and disproportionate 
unpaid care burdens for female farmers; 
Whereas food insecurity will have unique 
effects on the nutrition and health of women 
and girls, who already comprise 60 percent of 
individuals 
experiencing 
hunger 
in 
the 
world, often rely on getting at least 1 nutri-
tious meal each day from feeding programs 
at schools that may be shut down due to the 
COVID–19 crisis, and face shortages in nutri-
tious food and nutrients given social norms 
that dictate that women and girls eat last 
and least when food is scarce; 
Whereas 
girls, 
particularly 
adolescent 
girls, will be especially affected by the clo-
sures of schools resulting from the COVID–19 
crisis, and it is estimated that, as of March 
2020, nearly 743,000,000 girls, not including 
the approximately 132,000,000 girls who were 
already out of school before the onset of the 
crisis, are out of school due to such closures, 
and an additional 11,000,000 girls may leave 
school by the end of the COVID–19 crisis, 
with evidence suggesting that many will not 
return to school; 
Whereas closures of schools due to the 
COVID–19 crisis will decrease the ability of 
girls to access education and skills building, 
increase the exposure of girls to gender- 
based violence, such as child marriage, exac-
erbate the vulnerability of girls to early 
pregnancy and childbirth-related complica-
tions, and impede access of girls to informa-
tion about the prevention of COVID–19, pro-
tection services, and pathways to report 
abuse; 
Whereas the COVID–19 crisis will place par-
ticular burdens on women and girls in hu-
manitarian emergencies given challenges in-
cluding overcrowded conditions, restrictions 
on travel and movement, already strained 
health, hygiene, and sanitation infrastruc-
ture, food shortages and malnutrition, al-
ready heightened exposure to gender-based 
violence, systematic and targeted attacks on 
health infrastructure and aid workers by 
parties to conflicts, politicization of aid and 
service delivery, and restricted humani-
tarian access, all of which exacerbates the 
spread and effect of infectious diseases; 
Whereas the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM), and the 
Department of State have expressed concern 
about an increase in human trafficking and 
smuggling as traffickers take advantage of 
increased vulnerabilities and chaos during 
the COVID–19 crisis; 
Whereas the diversion of resources and 
services away from existing primary health 
care needs to address the COVID–19 crisis 
and contain the spread of COVID–19 will have 
particular effects on women and girls, in-
cluding disruptions in the provision of life- 
saving health services unrelated to COVID– 
19, such as maternal health care and sexual 
and reproductive health services, and the 
loss of critical services and support to re-
spond to gender-based violence; 
Whereas the COVID–19 Global Humani-
tarian Response Plan coordinated by the 
United Nations is only 17 percent funded, 
leaving significant gaps in the response to 
immediate health and non-health needs of 
women and girls and other vulnerable popu-
lations, and ongoing humanitarian response 
plans, identified as a top priority by the 
United Nations given that people targeted in 
those plans will be the most affected by the 
direct and indirect effects of the COVID–19 
crisis, remain only 17.3 percent funded; 
Whereas estimates show that, globally, 
women are included in only 24 percent of na-
tional response plans for the COVID–19 cri-
sis, and women and girls have been largely 
excluded from leadership and decision mak-
ing related to responses to the crisis, result-
ing in response measures that may not fully 
account for how COVID–19 affects women 
and girls; 
Whereas studies show that structural gen-
der inequities, including low social status 
and unequal access to education, and lack of 
autonomous decision-making power nega-
tively affects the ability of women to access 
vaccines for themselves and their children; 
and 
Whereas humanitarian exemptions to sanc-
tions and counterterrorism measures are 
vital for ensuring states and principled hu-
manitarian actors are able to reach vulner-
able women and girls with efficient, needs- 
based assistance, including COVID–19 re-
sponse activities consistent with obligations 
under international humanitarian law, re-
gardless of the location of those women and 
girls: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the critical importance of 
gender balance and inclusivity in bodies re-
sponsible for coordination and decision mak-
ing related to the COVID–19 crisis, including 
in structures and task forces of the United 
States Government charged with developing 
policies and responses to the crisis; 
(2) promotes integrating a gender lens 
throughout the response to the COVID–19 
crisis by analyzing and tracking the effect of 
and response to the crisis on gender, includ-
ing gathering evidence from data that is 
disaggregated by gender, age, and other spe-
cific variables; 
(3) supports measures to ensure that life- 
saving health services including sexual and 
reproductive health and gender-based vio-
lence prevention and response are well 
resourced and supported, including within 
the COVID–19 Global Humanitarian Response 
Plan coordinated by the United Nations, and 
that funding earmarked for those services is 
not reduced, canceled, or diverted to other 
COVID–19 response activities; 
(4) supports measures to ensure the con-
tinuation of adequate food and nutrition se-
curity for women and girls around the world 
affected by COVID–19, including women 
smallholder farmers and other women work-
ing in agriculture, in light of the unique 
challenges described in the preamble of this 
resolution; 
(5) reinforces the need to ensure that 
short-term relief programming and longer- 
term economic strategies address the spe-
cific effects of COVID–19 on women globally, 
especially lower income, migrant, displaced, 
and other marginalized women; 
(6) commends the executive branch for— 
(A) rescinding the global gag rule, also 
known as the Mexico City Policy, which has 
been shown to lead to poorer health out-
comes for women; 
(B) resuming support for the United Na-
tions Population Fund (UNFPA); and 
(C) clearly stating the executive branch’s 
policy of supporting sexual and reproductive 
health and rights around the world; 
(7) urges the executive branch to uphold 
the rights of crisis-affected and forcibly dis-
placed populations, including women and 
girls, further affected by COVID–19, by pro-
moting compliance with international hu-
manitarian and human rights legal obliga-
tions and engaging parties to conflicts to en-
sure unhindered access to health care, med-
ical supplies, and other vital aid and protec-
tion; 
(8) supports robust funding contributions 
by the United States for the international 
response to the COVID–19 crisis in addition 
to further funding for ongoing humanitarian 
appeals in support of vulnerable women and 
girls affected by COVID–19 and underlying 
emergencies; 
(9) commits to continuously assess and 
eliminate any impediment to the delivery of 
and access to humanitarian assistance; 
(10) urges the executive branch— 
(A) to reaffirm United States leadership on 
gender-based violence in foreign assistance, 
including by championing and providing 
comprehensive mental and physical health 
care services for survivors; and 
(B) to reestablish leadership and global 
standing on this critical issue; and 
(11) urges the executive branch to address 
barriers to equitable COVID–19 treatment 
and vaccine access for women, girls, and 
marginalized communities as part of a holis-
tic response to the global COVID–19 pan-
demic.

amount under subparagraph (A), the Sec-
retary may adjust the amount of any peri-
odic payment made after the date of such

would have been on the basis of the annual 
advance amount as so modified. 
‘‘(4) DETERMINATION
OF
STATUS.—If infor-
mation contained in the taxpayer’s return of 
tax for the reference taxable year does not

mine such status based on information 
known to the Secretary. 
‘‘(5) TREATMENT

calendar year, and such other information as 
the Secretary determines appropriate.

with a mirror code tax system (as defined in

so treated. 
‘‘(C) ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF ADVANCE 
PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) MIRROR CODE POSSESSIONS.—In the case 
of any possession described in subparagraph

ance which provides for the application of

OF
CREDIT
AND

allowed under this section to any taxpayer 
for any taxable year shall be reduced (but

ure to so reduce the credit shall be treated as 
arising out of a mathematical or clerical

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the aggregate amount 
of payments under section 7527A to the tax-
payer during the taxable year exceeds the 
amount of the credit allowed under this sec-
tion to such taxpayer for such taxable year 
(determined without regard to paragraph 
(1)), the tax imposed by this chapter for such 
taxable year shall be increased by the 
amount of such excess. Any failure to so in-
crease the tax shall be treated as arising out 
of a mathematical or clerical error and as-
sessed according to section 6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(B) SAFE HARBOR BASED ON MODIFIED AD-
JUSTED GROSS INCOME.—

fined in subsection (b)) for the taxable year

income threshold, the amount of the in-
crease determined under subparagraph (A) 
with respect to such taxpayer for such tax-
able year shall be reduced (but not below 
zero) by the safe harbor amount. 
‘‘(ii) PHASE OUT OF SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.— 
In the case of a taxpayer whose modified ad-
justed gross income (as defined in subsection 
(b)) for the taxable year exceeds the applica-
ble 
income 
threshold, 
the 
safe 
harbor 
amount otherwise in effect under clause (i) 
shall be reduced by the amount which bears 
the same ratio to such amount as such ex-
cess bears to the applicable income thresh-
old. 
‘‘(iii) APPLICABLE INCOME THRESHOLD.—For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘ap-
plicable income threshold’ means— 
‘‘(I) $60,000 in the case of a joint return or 
surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(a)), 
‘‘(II) $50,000 in the case of a head of house-
hold, and

termining the annual advance amount with 
respect to the taxpayer under section 7527A 
with respect to months beginning in such

‘‘(b) ELIGIBLE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sec-
tion, a multiemployer plan is an eligible 
multiemployer plan if— 
‘‘(A) the plan is in critical and declining

(within 
the 
meaning 
of 
section 
305(b)(6)) in any plan year beginning in 2020 
through 2022; 
‘‘(B) a suspension of benefits has been ap-
proved with respect to the plan under section

through 2022, the plan is certified by the plan

and has a ratio of active to inactive partici-
pants which is less than 2 to 3; or 
‘‘(D) the plan became insolvent for pur-
poses of section 418E of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 after December 16, 2014, and has

minated as of the date of enactment of this 
section. 
‘‘(2) MODIFIED
FUNDED
PERCENTAGE.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1)(C), the term ‘modi-
fied funded percentage’ means the percent-
age equal to a fraction the numerator of 
which is current value of plan assets (as de-
fined in section 3(26) of such Act) and the de-
nominator of which is current liabilities (as 
defined in section 431(c)(6)(D) of such Code 
and section 304(c)(6)(D) of such Act). 
‘‘(c) APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE.—Within 120 days of the date of

sistance applications under this section. In 
such regulations or guidance, the corpora-

cial financial assistance application to the 
minimum necessary to make a determina-
tion on the application; 
‘‘(2) specify effective dates for transfers of

tive date of the supporting actuarial analysis 
and the date on which the application is sub-
mitted; and 
‘‘(3) provide for an alternate application 
for special financial assistance under this 
section, which may be used by a plan that 
has been approved for a partition under sec-
tion 4233 before the date of enactment of this 
section. 
‘‘(d) TEMPORARY PRIORITY CONSIDERATION 
OF APPLICATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The corporation may 
specify in regulations or guidance under sub-
section (c) that, during a period no longer 
than the first 2 years following the date of 
enactment of this section, applications may 
not be filed by an eligible multiemployer 
plan unless— 
‘‘(A) the eligible multiemployer plan is in-
solvent or is likely to become insolvent 
within 5 years of the date of enactment of 
this section; 
‘‘(B) the corporation projects the eligible 
multiemployer plan to have a present value 
of financial assistance payments under sec-
tion 4261 that exceeds $1,000,000,000 if the spe-
cial financial assistance is not ordered; 
‘‘(C) the eligible multiemployer plan has 
implemented benefit suspensions under sec-
tion 305(e)(9) as of the date of the enactment 
of this section; or 
‘‘(D) the corporation determines it appro-
priate based on other similar circumstances. 
‘‘(e) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) ELIGIBILITY.—For purposes of deter-
mining eligibility for special financial assist-
ance, the corporation shall accept assump-
tions incorporated in a multiemployer plan’s 
determination that it is in critical status or 
critical and declining status (within the 
meaning of section 305(b)) for certifications 
of plan status completed before January 1, 
2021, unless such assumptions are clearly er-
roneous. For certifications of plan status 
completed after December 31, 2020, a plan 
shall determine whether it is in critical or 
critical and declining status for purposes of 
eligibility for special financial assistance by 
using the assumptions that the plan used in 
its most recently completed certification of 
plan status before January 1, 2021, unless 
such assumptions (excluding the plan’s inter-
est rate) are unreasonable. 
‘‘(2) AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.—In 
determining the amount of special financial 
assistance in its application, an eligible mul-
tiemployer plan shall— 
‘‘(A) use the interest rate used by the plan 
in its most recently completed certification 
of plan status before January 1, 2021, pro-
vided that such interest rate may not exceed 
the interest rate limit; and 
‘‘(B) for other assumptions, use the as-
sumptions that the plan used in its most re-
cently completed certification of plan status 
before January 1, 2021, unless such assump-
tions are unreasonable. 
‘‘(3) INTEREST
RATE
LIMIT.—The interest 
rate limit for purposes of this subsection is 
the rate specified in section 303(h)(2)(C)(iii) 
(disregarding 
modifications 
made 
under 
clause (iv) of such section) for the month in 
which the application for special financial 
assistance is filed by the eligible multiem-
ployer plan or the 3 preceding months, with 
such specified rate increased by 200 basis 
points. 
‘‘(4) CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS.—If a plan de-
termines that use of one or more prior as-
sumptions is unreasonable, the plan may 
propose in its application to change such as-
sumptions, provided that the plan discloses 
such changes in its application and describes 
why such assumptions are no longer reason-
able. The corporation shall accept such 
changed assumptions unless it determines 
the changes are unreasonable, individually 
or in the aggregate. The plan may not pro-
pose a change to the interest rate otherwise 
required under this subsection for eligibility 
or financial assistance amount. 
‘‘(f) APPLICATION DEADLINE.—Any applica-
tion by a plan for special financial assistance 
under this section shall be submitted to the 
corporation (and, in the case of a plan to 
which section 432(k)(1)(D) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 applies, to the Sec-
retary of the Treasury) no later than Decem-
ber 31, 2025, and any revised application for 
special financial assistance shall be sub-
mitted no later than December 31, 2026. 
‘‘(g) DETERMINATIONS ON APPLICATIONS.—A 
plan’s application for special financial as-
sistance under this section that is timely 
filed in accordance with the regulations or 
guidance issued under subsection (c) shall be 
deemed approved unless the corporation no-
tifies the plan within 120 days of the filing of 
the application that the application is in-
complete, any proposed change or assump-
tion is unreasonable, or the plan is not eligi-
ble under this section. Such notice shall 
specify the reasons the plan is ineligible for 
special financial assistance, any proposed 
change or assumption is unreasonable, or in-
formation is needed to complete the applica-
tion. If a plan is denied assistance under this 
subsection, the plan may submit a revised 
application under this section. Any revised 
application for special financial assistance 
submitted by a plan shall be deemed ap-
proved unless the corporation notifies the 
plan within 120 days of the filing of the re-
vised application that the application is in-
complete, any proposed change or assump-
tion is unreasonable, or the plan is not eligi-
ble under this section. Special financial as-
sistance issued by the corporation shall be 
effective on a date determined by the cor-
poration, but no later than 1 year after a 
plan’s special financial assistance applica-
tion is approved by the corporation or 
deemed approved. The corporation shall not 
pay any special financial assistance after 
September 30, 2030. 
‘‘(h) MANNER OF PAYMENT.—The payment 
made by the corporation to an eligible mul-
tiemployer plan under this section shall be 
made as a single, lump sum payment. 
‘‘(i) AMOUNT AND MANNER OF SPECIAL FI-
NANCIAL ASSISTANCE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Special financial assist-
ance under this section shall be a transfer of 
funds in the amount necessary as dem-
onstrated by the plan sponsor on the applica-
tion for such special financial assistance, in 
accordance with the requirements described 
in subsection (j). Special financial assistance 
shall be paid to such plan as soon as prac-
ticable upon approval of the application by 
the corporation. 
‘‘(2) NO CAP.—Special financial assistance 
granted by the corporation under this sec-
tion shall not be capped by the guarantee 
under 4022A. 
‘‘(j) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF SPECIAL 
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The amount of financial 
assistance provided to a multiemployer plan 
eligible for financial assistance under this 
section shall be such amount required for the 
plan to pay all benefits due during the period 
beginning on the date of payment of the spe-
cial financial assistance payment under this 
section and ending on the last day of the 
plan year ending in 2051, with no reduction 
in a participant’s or beneficiary’s accrued 
benefit as of the date of enactment of this 
section, except to the extent of a reduction 
in accordance with section 305(e)(8) adopted 
prior to the plan’s application for special fi-
nancial assistance under this section, and

each nonentitlement unit of local govern-
ment in the State an amount that bears the 
same proportion to the amount of such pay-

the 30-day distribution period described in 
such clause that it would constitute an ex-
cessive administrative burden for the State 
to meet the terms of such clause with re-
spect to 1 or more such distributions, the au-
thorized officer may request, and the Sec-
retary shall grant, an extension of such pe-

tended, an authorized officer of the State 
may request an additional extension of the 
distribution period of not more than 30 days.

ditional extension of such period only if—

request provides a written plan to the Sec-
retary specifying, for each distribution for 
which an additional extension is requested, 
when the State expects to make such dis-
tribution and the actions the State has 
taken and will take in order to make all 
such distributions before the end of the dis-
tribution period (as extended under sub-
clause (I) and this subclause); and

a State granted an additional extension of

the 30-day distribution period described in

spect to 1 or more such distributions, the au-
thorized officer may request, and the Sec-
retary shall grant, an extension of such pe-

riod for the State (as extended with respect 
to the State under subparagraph (C)(ii)), 
such State has failed to make all the dis-
tributions from such payment in accordance 
with the terms of subparagraph (C) (includ-
ing any extensions of the distribution period 
granted in accordance with such subpara-
graph), an amount equal to the amount of 
such payment that remains undistributed as 
of such date shall be booked as a debt of such

lation of all such entities and shall pay such 
allocated amounts to such counties in ac-
cordance with paragraph (7).

ERAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT.—In the case of an 
amount to be paid to a county that is not a 
unit 
of 
general 
local 
government, 
the 
amount shall instead be paid to the State in 
which such county is located, and such State 
shall distribute such amount to each unit of 
general local government within such county 
in an amount that bears the same proportion 
to the amount to be paid to such county as 
the population of such units of general local 
government bears to the total population of 
such county. 
‘‘(iii) DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.—For purposes 
of this paragraph, the District of Columbia 
shall be considered to consist of a single 
county that is a unit of general local govern-
ment.

event that a school fails to timely submit a 
re-opening plan in accordance with sub-
section (a), the State shall withhold all 
grant funds that would have been provided to

direct education assistance, includes the pro-
posed school, if any, that the parent or 
guardian has selected for the child and the 
cost of any fees associated with the applica-
tion, enrollment, or attendance at such

parents across the State with an application 
period of not less than 45 days and a deadline

mit a re-opening plan as described herein 
and, if funds remain available in the Direct 
Education Assistance Fund after each pri-
ority student has received a grant, the De-
partment shall make grants from the Fund 
available to the parent or guardians applying 
on behalf of students from other elementary 
and secondary schools in the State.

grant to an individual who is the legal par-
ent or guardian of an eligible child provided 
that such individual is also a citizen or na-
tional of the United States or an alien (as de-
fined in section 101(a) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)) who is 
lawfully present in the United States. 
(5) The Department will administer the Di-
rect Education Assistance Fund as follows: 
(A) 75 percent of such Fund shall be set 
aside and used to award direct education as-
sistance grants to finance all or a portion of 
the educational costs of a child to attend a 
different school as selected by that child’s 
parent or guardian in an amount not to ex-
ceed $10,000 per grant award. 
(B) 25 percent of such Fund shall be set 
aside and used to award supplemental edu-
cation assistance grants to cover a portion of 
the costs for education such as tutoring serv-
ices, educational classes, or curriculum in-
side or outside of the home, books, instruc-
tional materials, online educational mate-
rials, educational therapies, including edu-
cational therapies and services for students 
with disabilities, and such other educational 
and instructional materials as the child’s 
parent or guardian determines is beneficial

online or virtual schooling or home instruc-
tion.

school or home school under State law. 
(2) NO DISCRIMINATION.—No State shall ex-
clude, discriminate against, or otherwise dis-
advantage any education provider, including 
home education provider, with respect to 
programs or services under this section 
based in whole or in part on the provider’s 
religious character or affiliation, including 
religiously based or mission-based policies or 
practices. 
(d) PARENTAL RIGHTS TO USE GRANTS.—No 
State shall disfavor or discourage the use of 
qualifying grants for the purchase of elemen-

maining in the Fund as of September 30, 2021,

fore January 1, 2021, shall be treated for pur-
poses of applying subsection (e)(2) in the

of a joint return with respect to which only 
1 spouse is deceased before January 1, 2021, 
such deceased spouse was a member of the 
Armed Forces of the United States at any 
time during the taxable year, and the valid 
identification 
number

such 
deceased 
spouse is included on the return of tax for 
the taxable year, the valid identification 
number of 1 (and only 1) spouse shall be 
treated as included on the return of tax for

ceased before January 1, 2021.
