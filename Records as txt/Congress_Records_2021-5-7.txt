PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, open our ears this day 
that we would hear the heavens declar-
ing Your glory. Open our eyes that we 
would see the firmament displaying 
Your handiwork. 
We confess that we are often caught 
up in the words of our world, speeches 
made, positions held, and knowledge 
expounded. Silence us and the cacoph-
ony around us. Attune our hearts to 
Your voice which goes out through all 
the Earth—Your words which proclaim 
Your eternal life into the finitude of 
our own. 
Then revive our souls with Your in-
struction. Make our simple lives wise 
with revelation of Your omnipotent 
plan. 
Call our hearts to rejoice in the paths 
You set before us, and give us courage 
to abide in the purity of Your ways. 
Then may we taste the sweetness of 
the life You set before us—sweeter 
than the honey that can never satisfy 
our hunger. Then may we know the 
wealth of Your presence—wealth more 
precious than any gold we earn. 
And may the words of our mouths 
and the meditations of our lips be ac-
ceptable in Your sight, O Lord, our 
rock, and our Redeemer. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING SARAH BUSSINEAU 
FOR BEING NAMED THE MICHI-
GAN ASSOCIATION OF TEACHER 
EDUCATORS 
SECONDARY 
GRADES STUDENT TEACHER OF 
THE YEAR FOR 2020 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize a future leader of my community, 
Sarah Bussineau of Macomb, for being named 
the Michigan Association of Teacher Edu-
cators Secondary Grades Student Teacher of 
the Year for 2020. 
This award recognizes student teachers 
who have demonstrated outstanding perform-
ance during their student teaching tenure in an 
academic school year. Sarah’s award-winning 
year took place at Cousino High School in 
Warren, where she taught band and choir stu-
dents in grades 9–12. 
Sarah’s achievement is all the more impres-
sive when you think of the dual task student 
teachers face in balancing teaching with their 
own educational pursuits. As a student herself 
during this time, Sarah pursued a degree and 
graduated in December 2020 from Oakland 
University. She took on both the role of teach-
er and student with passion, dedication and 
commitment. I know there were probably 
bumps in the road, but I hope Sarah is able 
to recognize her hard work has paid off. 
Again, I congratulate Sarah on this well-de-
served recognition. I wish her the best of luck 
as she begins her new job as a full-time 
teacher at St. Regis Catholic School in Bloom-
field Hills, where she will teach general music, 
band and choir. I am confident Sarah will con-
tinue to excel and inspire in this exciting new 
role. We are proud of Sarah and we thank her 
for her dedication to our students, and we 
support her in her future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING 30 YEARS OF UZBEK 
INDEPENDENCE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the 30-year independ-
ence of Uzbekistan from the former Soviet 
Union and their progressive efforts to democ-
ratize and create a positive impact on the 
international stage. Since 1992 the United 
States and Uzbekistan have enjoyed strong 
diplomatic and economic relations. In recent 
years Uzbekistan has made significant steps 
in redirecting their actions towards furthering 
democratic, political, economic, and social re-
forms. I am proud to see Uzbekistan work to-
wards such worthy goals. 
In addition to domestic democratic actions 
Uzbekistan has made strides to increase 
strong, robust diplomatic and economic rela-
tions with the United States. Currently, Uzbek-
istan and the U.S. maintain an important, 
multifaceted relationship that benefits both 
parties in the advancement of domestic and 
international interests. Uzbekistan remains a 
critical ally in the southeast Asian regions to 
stop the spreading Chinese influence. 
Uzbekistan has been a participant in Annual 
Bilateral Consultations, which produced agree-
ments on issues such as terrorism, regional 
security, trade, and human rights reform. The 
country also ambitiously laid out a night year 
plan, the ‘‘National Development Action Strat-
egy on Five Priority Areas 2017–2021,’’ which 
defines governance, judicial reform, economic 
progress, social development and a balanced 
foreign policy as key goals to work towards. 
Uzbekistan is on track with these goals as 
they are preparing for an election in the fall, 
are actively working to be a stabilizing force in 
Central Asia and have made great efforts to 
be a partner with the United States on the 
world stage. 
I am proud to be a friend to the country of 
Uzbekistan and I congratulate them on mark-
ing 30 years of progress since leaving the So-
viet Union. The strides made have brought 
Uzbekistan far and they have made a great 
ally on the world stage.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF IRENE 
B. WEST 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate the life of Irene B. 
West. Mrs. West was born on July 3, 1932 in 
Crowley, Louisiana and she graduated Val-
edictorian of her high school class. She 
moved to Nashville, Tennessee where she 
met her late husband. Mrs. West received her 
Bachelor of Arts degree from California State 
University Sacramento (CSUS) and obtained a 
Master of Arts degree from the University of 
San Francisco. 
Mrs. West, whose older sisters were teach-
ers, was hired as the first black teacher in Elk 
Grove, CA in 1962. With virtually no represen-
tation in the area, she showcased true dedica-
tion to her career in education during the era 
of the Civil Rights movement. During her 27 
years in service of the Elk Grove Community, 
she taught at James McKee and Florin Ele-
mentary schools and then served as principal 
at John Reith and Cosumnes River Elemen-
tary schools. 
As a mother of four, Mrs. West was not only 
dedicated to her students and their education 
but raised talented and devoted children while 
working full time. In fact, The Sacramento Ob-
server named her Mother of the Year in 1963. 
All her children excelled in their chosen fields 
of study, and two followed in her footsteps 
teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) and Sunday school. We 
know she would be proud of their future en-
deavors as her children continue her legacy. 
Because of her impact as a mother, educa-
tor, a wife and a pillar to society, Mrs. West 
has left a lasting legacy for the city of Elk 
Grove and will continue to inspire young 
women of color for generations to come. 
I want to extend my condolences to the 
West family, and to everyone Mrs. West posi-
tively affected throughout her lifetime. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in celebrating the life of 
Irene B. West for her work in our community 
and her impact on our educational system.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COVID–19 
MEMORIAL QUILT ACT OF 2021 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to reintroduce the COVID–19 Memo-
rial Quilt Act of 2021 to again honor all the vic-
tims of this pandemic with a national memorial 
quilt. 
The horrors of the COVID–19 pandemic 
have touched every corner of our country, 
wreaking unprecedented devastation on Amer-
icans’ lives. As I reintroduce this legislation 
today, COVID–19 has infected at least 32 mil-
lion Americans. Tragically, this disease has 
quickly robbed our country of at least 578,000 
of our fellow citizens. We need to remember 
that these numbers are not just statistics: they 
are people. They are our moms, dads, chil-
dren, grandparents, neighbors, teachers, reli-
gious leaders and fellow Americans who have 
been taken from us due to this pandemic. 
Moreover, these numbers do not capture 
the depth of this disease’s devastation. While 
our television screens are often filled with im-
ages of empty streets and packed hospitals, 
we often don’t see the private isolation and 
loneliness of the individual struggles against 
COVID–19. In order to slow the spread of this 
disease, our hospitals, nursing homes, funeral 
homes, and businesses have had to impose 
strict social distancing and protective meas-
ures. While necessary for our public health, 
these restrictions come at a great human cost 
and deepen the private pain caused by this 
disease. 
For the thousands of brave patients fighting 
COVID–19, including the hospitalized patients, 
nursing home residents, and individuals at 
home in quarantine, the struggle against 
COVID–19 is a lonely, scary, and isolating 
fight. In hospitals and nursing homes, often a 
patient’s only human contact is a health care 
worker in full personal protective equipment 
(PPE). Family, friends, and loved ones can’t 
be there to provide comfort, to hold their 
hands, or to pray with them in this terrifying 
time. At best, loving words and support might 
be shared over the telephone or video call. At 
worst, there is only an isolating silence where

a loved one should be. These scars need to 
be acknowledged and hopefully healed. 
The death toll from COVID–19 is even more 
wrenching. At least 112,000 Americans— 
whether in the hospital, the nursing home, or 
at home—have met the end of their lives with-
out the comfort of their family, friends, or loved 
ones. Yesterday, more than 700 Americans 
died from this disease, and many were forced 
to close their eyes without the support of their 
loved ones nearby. 
In my home state of Indiana, we have lost 
at least 12,966 Hoosiers to COVID–19 at 
nursing homes. We also know that African 
Americans are dying at disproportionate rates 
from COVID–19. African Americans in Indiana. 
Institutional racism, compounded by environ-
mental and economic injustices, have made 
COVID–19 particularly devastating for African 
Americans. My heart grieves for my fellow 
Americans who took their last breath, because 
of this terrible disease, without the loving com-
fort and support they deserved. 
For the family, friends, and loved ones of 
those who died from COVID–19, the isolation 
and loneliness brought by this disease only 
grows after their loved one’s passing. Social 
distancing and the isolating fear of this dis-
ease prevent us from adequately honoring and 
memorializing the many victims of COVID–19. 
Large memorial services are not possible. 
Family gatherings to celebrate lost loved ones 
are curtailed, with supportive hugs replaced by 
six feet of distance and protective masks. Pri-
vate funeral services—if not cancelled or post-
poned altogether—have often had to take 
place with only 10 people or less. 
In addition to its sickness, death, and dis-
ruption, COVID–19 has robbed us of tradi-
tional ways of honoring our lost loved ones. 
Holding smaller funerals or forgoing them en-
tirely because of social distancing measures 
has denied us the opportunity to fully cele-
brate the lives of the deceased. Our ability to 
publicly grieve together, and to adequately 
honor and celebrate the lost has been largely 
denied due to this isolating and frightening dis-
ease. 
Many Americans will also remember another 
isolating and frightening disease: the AIDS 
epidemic. Ryan White, a brave and remark-
able Hoosier, faced isolation and many fright-
ening obstacles because of his AIDS diag-
nosis. However, Ryan’s courage, bravery, and 
advocacy for AIDS research galvanized many 
in support of AIDS treatment, research and 
recognition of this disease’s horrific impact. 
Since no official commemoration existed, con-
cerned Americans decided to celebrate and 
honor the lives of those who died from AIDS— 
often isolated and alone—by creating a me-
morial quilt. As a result, in 1987, the NAMES 
Project AIDS Memorial Quilt was displayed 
and stretched the length of the National Mall. 
This remarkable quilt allowed us to honor and 
celebrate the lives of those tragically lost to a 
frightening disease, which at that time, had no 
cure, vaccine or effective treatment. More than 
105,000 individual lives are commemorated 
through this quilt’s 50,000 individual panels 
that contain photographs, correspondence, 
and news clippings to remember those who 
died from AIDS. In these panels, the memory 
of the victims were able to live on in public 
view. 
Inspired by the brave advocacy and power-
ful legacy of the NAMES Project AIDS Memo-
rial Quilt, I am proud to introduce the COVID– 
19 Memorial Quilt Act of 2021. This legislation 
honors and celebrates the lives of those we 
have lost to the COVID–19 pandemic through 
the creation of a memorial quilt. Like the AIDS 
quilt, creating a memorial quilt to remember 
the lives lost due to COVID–19 will allow 
Americans to publicly grieve our lost loved 
ones, but also commemorate their lives in per-
manent, visible, and dignified way. 
The COVID–19 Memorial Quilt Act of 2021 
authorizes the design, creation, and display of 
a memorial quilt and other commemorative 
programming and exhibits to honor the victims 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. My legislation 
does this by creating a Congressional Advi-
sory Panel which will submit plans to the 
Smithsonian Institution and the American 
Folklife Center at the Library of Congress for 
how the quilt should be developed and dis-
played. Once complete, this memorial quilt will 
be displayed on the United States Capitol 
Grounds with a subsequent display on the Na-
tional Mall and other locations, continuing the 
legacy of the AIDS quilt. This legislation also 
supports the powerful creativity of artists 
around the country by providing them with 
grants from the National Endowment of the 
Arts (NEA) to help design and prepare panels 
for the memorial quilt. 
All Americans have been affected by 
COVID–19. All have felt the disruption wrought 
by this pandemic to our families, our work-
places, our businesses, our places of worship, 
and our social lives. But that is nothing com-
pared to the Americans who have not only 
faced disruptions, but also the wrenching loss 
of loved ones from this disease. Because of 
social distancing and protective restrictions, 
we have been denied the ability to adequately 
honor, commemorate, and publicly celebrate 
those we have lost. And unfortunately, as 
more Americans continue to die in isolation 
from this disease, this deficit in our collective 
grief will only grow. As a result, my legislation 
builds on the powerful legacy of the NAMES 
Project AIDS Memorial Quilt and will help our 
country to collectively grieve and appropriately 
honor the victims of COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join us in supporting the COVID–19 Memorial 
Quilt Act of 2021, and I urge the House to 
support this legislation.

HONORING TRISH BERGREN AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Trish Bergren of Clarinda, Iowa as 
Iowan of the Week. Trish is a respected lead-
er in the Clarinda and Page County commu-
nity who has touched countless lives through 
her work as the Executive Director of the 
Clarinda Carnegie Art Museum and as the cu-
rator for the Nodaway Valley Historical Mu-
seum. Trish has a deep love, and passion for 
preserving the history of her community and 
being a guardian of the knowledge of the past 
for future generations. 
Trish’s family is no stranger to Page County 
and has family roots in the area that go back 
more than 160 years. This deep-seated pas-
sion for local history and helping young people 
engage in this history drove her to a career 
she loves and even a book that covers the 
subject. Despite having moved away from the 
area for a time, she made the decision to re-
turn and couldn’t imagine being anywhere 
else. Her love for the community she works is 
truly heartwarming to hear. Those who work 
with her claim she has both improved their 
lives and changed their outlook for the future 
for the better. 
As part of her duties with the Historical Mu-
seum, Trish formed the Adopt-A-Grave pro-
gram in 2013. The program, under the Histor-
ical Society, has worked to clean, find lost 
headstones, 
and 
rehab 
more 
than 
750 
headstones across the 50 pioneer cemeteries 
in Page County. This undertaking has a group 
of students at Clarinda High School who man-
age the program, while more than 39 students 
and 12 adults have assisted with various 
projects. This is just one tangible initiative run 
by Trish to give dignity to the history of those 
who came before us and ensure the pride the 
community holds in honoring the past. 
In addition to her already busy service to 
the community, Trish serves on the Clarinda 
School Board, where she was elected in 2019 
as a new member. 
In consideration of the dedication to serving 
the community, Trish is a pillar of the commu-
nity in not only Clarinda but the State of Iowa. 
Her reputation as a kind and selfless person 
precedes her and her work speaks for itself. 
Clarinda is a strong community because of the 
individuals, like Trish, who make it such a 
wonderful place. The work Trish has per-
formed, and that which she has inspired oth-
ers to take upon themselves will ensure that 
the history of the community will endure. 
Stemming from this dedication to serve the 
community and preserve the story of its past 
for future Iowans to learn from and enjoy, I am 
proud to recognize Trish Bergren as Iowan of 
the week.

FECTED BY THE FEDEX SHOOT-
ING IN INDIANAPOLIS 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor eight Hoosier lives lost at the FedEx 
facility in Indianapolis. I joined my fellow Indi-
ana delegation members in leading our col-
leagues in a moment of silence on the house 
floor in their honor on April 21, 2021. 
Of the eight lives lost, four of those individ-
uals belonged to the Sikh community in cen-
tral Indiana. This community is small and tight 
knit. They are friends and colleagues who 
work together and worship together. The loss 
this community is feeling in the wake of this 
tragedy is unimaginable. I stand with the Sikh 
community and all those affected by this 
senseless act of violence. 
My deepest condolences are with all the 
families and friends who are experiencing un-
imaginable pain and loss. Our state and Na-
tion mourn with them.

ALLEN H. TOMLIN, JR., FOR RE-
CEIVING THE ROBERT JACKSON 
EURY MEMORIAL AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Kannapolis Police Department’s Lieu-
tenant Allen H. Tomlin, Jr. for receiving the 
Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award. 
A native of Concord, North Carolina, Lieu-
tenant Tomlin began his career with the 
Cabarrus County Sheriff’s Office in July 1997. 
He joined the Kannapolis Police Department in 
September 1998, serving as a Field Training 
Officer from September 2000 until becoming a 
Master Police Officer in January 2011. Shortly 
afterward, he was promoted to Sergeant, and 
then made Lieutenant in June 2019. Allen is a 
member of KPD’s Special Response Team as 
a trained negotiator. 
Allen holds an Advance Law Enforcement 
Certificate from the N.C. Criminal Justice Edu-
cation and Training Standards Commission

Terry Spry refers to Allen as a quiet hero who 
truly embraces a servant leadership philos-
ophy, serving with exceptional character, cour-
age, and commitment. 
The Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award 
is presented in memory of Robert Jackson

while serving as a Cabarrus County law en-
forcement officer. This award keeps Mr. Eury’s 
legacy alive through officers who share his 
same admirable and commendable spirit in 
Cabarrus County. Lt. Tomlin fits the mold of 
esteemed law enforcement officers in our 
community set by Robert Eury, and there is no 
doubt in my mind that Lt. Tomlin will continue 
his outstanding leadership and maintain his 
unwavering values while protecting and serv-
ing the people of Cabarrus County; I am ex-
cited to see what the future holds for such a 
dedicated law enforcement professional. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in

HONORING CHESTER WILSON 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Chester Wilson from Lexington, 
Kentucky. Mr. Wilson bravely served our na-
tion during World War II. He currently resides 
at 
Thomson-Hood 
Veterans 
Center 
in 
Wilmore, Kentucky. On April 25, Mr. Wilson 
celebrated his 107th birthday. 
Mr. Wilson graduated from Lexington’s 
Bryan Station High School. He was the first 
member of his family to graduate. At the age 
of 29, he enlisted in the United States Navy. 
He served aboard the U.S.S. Benevolence, a 
Navy hospital ship, in the Pacific Theater. He 
was a pharmacist mate 3rd class. 
After the war, Mr. Wilson worked as a fed-
eral agent at bourbon distilleries and later 
worked for the Treasury Department. He re-
tired in 1974. He and his late wife Margaret 
have a daughter, Brenda Wilson, a stepson 
Jack Whitaker, and two grandchildren. 
It is my honor to recognize this amazing pa-
triot, celebrate his 107th birthday, and appre-
ciate him for his service and sacrifice to our 
nation during World War II. As a part of ‘‘The 
Greatest Generation’’, Mr. Wilson was an im-
portant part of the war effort to preserve the 
freedoms that we enjoy today. I am forever 
grateful for Americans like Chester Wilson.

HONORING 
THE 
15TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
CALIPSO 
SAT-
ELLITE MISSION 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the CALIPSO satellite mission upon 
the 15th anniversary of its space-based lidar 
measurements. CALIPSO’s unique observa-
tions have revolutionized our knowledge of the 
vertical distributions of clouds and of layers of 
dust, smoke, and pollution. These findings 
have also greatly improved our understanding 
of how these vertical distributions affect cli-
mate, weather, and air quality. CALIPSO data 
are widely used by the international science 
community and academia, and this data has 
contributed to significant new findings by state 
and U.S. government agencies, including 
NASA, the NOAA, the DoD, the USDA, and 
the EPA. 
CALIPSO measurements are the foundation 
of over 3200 peer-reviewed publications that 
have appeared since the mission launched on 
April 28, 2006—a tremendous accomplishment 
for a first-of-its-kind measurement system. 
Furthermore, CALIPSO discoveries now ap-
pear in textbooks for the next generation of cli-
mate scientists. 
NASA Langley Research Center in Hamp-
ton, Virginia, manages CALIPSO with oper-
ations accomplished through a strong and en-
during partnership with the French Space 
Agency, Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales 
(CNES). The mission’s longevity and scientific 
success is a testament to international col-
laboration, especially when it is employed to 
solve global issues. 
NASA Langley is now looking forward to de-
veloping new instruments needed to improve 
our understanding of extreme weather events 
and regional climate change. The next genera-
tion spaceborne lidar, which has been identi-
fied for a new observing system, will build 
upon knowledge and experience gained from 
CALIPSO and will benefit from innovative 
technology developments now underway at 
NASA Langley. 
CALIPSO continues to be an on-going trib-
ute to NASA’s tremendous can-do spirit and 
engineering 
excellence. 
While 
CALIPSO 
began its challenging mission with an ex-
pected lifetime of only 3 years, it has contin-
ued to deliver valuable measurements for 15 
years. The longevity of the mission and the 
large number of scientific discoveries emerg-
ing from CALIPSO is a huge credit to the 
project and to the Agency. 
With these many accomplishments, it is my 
honor to recognize the 15th anniversary of 
CALIPSO’s launch, and I wish the inter-
national mission team continued success in 
the future.

RECOGNIZING PROFESSOR 
MICHAEL ROCHE 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Professor 
Michael Roche of Vermillion as the first recipi-
ent of the Spirit of South Dakota Award. 
The Spirit of South Dakota Award was cre-
ated to celebrate and honor South Dakotans 
that display unusual perseverance, compas-
sion, and innovation, and are beloved by their 
community. 
Michael Roche has been a professor at the 
University of South Dakota since 1974 where 
he taught courses on criminal justice and 
criminal law. During his nearly fifty years of 
teaching, Roche has made a lasting impact on 
students and faculty alike. Among his list of 
impressive accomplishments, he was named 
the 2001 South Dakota Professor of the year 
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advance-
ment of Teaching. 
Roche is also the author of numerous books 
and articles on the criminal justice system and 
worked extensively inside the South Dakota 
penal system. I can say with certainty that 
South Dakota’s criminal justice system is bet-
ter off because of his work. 
While Professor Roche may be retiring from 
USD, he is leaving behind a legacy in the 
halls of USD and in the hearts of his students. 
Professor Roche truly exemplifies the Spirit of 
South Dakota and I’m honored to present him 
with the first award.

I rise today to celebrate the service of Colonel 
Billy F. Murphy of Tupelo. He has served hon-
orably in the Mississippi Air National Guard,

WASHINGTON 
STATE 
SEN-
ATOR DR. PAULL SHIN 
HON. MARILYN STRICKLAND 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Dr. Paull H. Shin, 
who passed away on April 12, 2021, at the 
age of 85. Dr. Shin was an extraordinary pub-
lic servant and community leader in Wash-
ington State. 
Born in Korea in 1935, Dr. Shin became an 
orphan at a young age. As a teenager, he 
began his long career in service by working 
for U.S. Army officers stationed on the Penin-
sula during the Korean War. After his adoption 
by Dr. Ray Paull, he came to the United 
States and quickly obtained his G.E.D., B.A. in 
Political Science from Brigham Young Univer-
sity, an M.P.I.A. from the University of Pitts-
burgh, and both an M.A. and Ph.D. from the 
University of Washington. Dr. Shin went on to 
teach for over three decades at Shoreline 
Community College in Washington. 
In 1992, Dr. Shin became the first Korean- 
American elected to the Washington State 
Legislature, where he served for nearly two 
decades representing the people of Washing-
ton’s 21st Legislative District. As a lawmaker, 
Dr. Shin always sought to give back to others, 
serving as a dedicated and respected voice 
for not only the Korean-American community, 
but all marginalized and underserved commu-
nity members. Dr. Shin was especially pas-
sionate about advocating for people with dis-
abilities, immigrants, military veterans, edu-
cation, trade, and economic development. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. Shin’s lasting legacy 
truly exemplifies strength, perseverance, and 
selfless service to others. I offer my heartfelt 
condolences to his wife Donna, two children, 
five grandsons, three greatgrandchildren, his 
adopted American family, his four brothers 
and one sister, and all of his loved ones. Dr. 
Paull Shin was a highly respected member of 
our community, and will be dearly missed by 
all who knew him.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
MICHAEL G. KRAUSE 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Mr. Michael G. ‘‘Moose’’ 
Krause, an outstanding individual who trag-
ically passed away on October 28, 2020 at the 
age of 48. 
Born on August 13, 1972, Michael was 
raised in Wayne, New Jersey by two loving 
parents, Michael and Loretta Krause. He grad-
uated from Wayne Hills High School and ob-
tained a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace 
Engineering from the United States Military 
Academy at West Point. While at West Point, 
Michael led the Army football team to three 
paramount victories over Navy as an offensive 
guard. He later received a Master of Business 
Administration degree from the University of 
Hawaii. 
Michael served over 21 honorable years in 
both the United States Army and the Maryland 
Army National Guard, achieving the rank of 
Major. With a passion for flying and spending 
time in the cockpit, Michael flew various air-
crafts as an Army helicopter pilot. Michael 
would go on to earn numerous decorations 
throughout his military career, including the 
Bronze Star Medal, Army Air Medal, Air Force 
Air Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Joint 
Service Commendation Medal, Army Com-
mendation Medal, and Army Achievement 
Medal. 
Michael retired from the Army in 2015 and 
began serving as Regional Vice President with 
Primerica Financial Services. Operating a fi-
nancial brokerage, he invested long hours in 
teaching middle class families how to support 
themselves long-term. Michael was happily 
married to Jilian Chevalier and had three won-
derful sons named MJ, Bobby, and Billy. He 
was a remarkable husband, father, and friend 
who chose to dedicate his life to humbly serv-
ing others. While Michael will be greatly 
missed, I am certain that his presence will live 
on in the lives of many for years to come.

HONORING CAMILLE CASTEEL 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the legacy of Chandler Unified School 
District Superintendent Dr. Camille Casteel, 
who is retiring after 50 years of service. Dur-
ing her tenure, she touched the lives of hun-
dreds of thousands of students. As a teacher, 
administrator, and superintendent, Dr. Casteel 
has been a pillar of our community and a one- 
of-a-kind leader. She devoted her professional 
life to ensuring that every student who walks 
the halls of a Chandler school is provided a 
quality, equitable, and impactful education— 
and our entire state is better today because of 
her leadership. 
A native Arizonan, Dr. Casteel spent her en-
tire career advocating for her students. In 
1971, she started as a first-grade teacher 
when Chandler—mostly a community a farms 
and ranches-was home to just seven small 
schools with no air conditioning. Casteel spent 
the next five decades with CUSD, including 25 
years as the district’s Superintendent, and 
under her leadership, CUSD became one of 
the largest districts in the state. There, Dr. 
Casteel oversaw the development of 30 new 
schools to serve the more than 46,000 stu-
dents who attend Chandler schools every day. 
For 50 years, Dr. Casteel has remained a 
trailblazer in the Chandler community. She 
has fought to ensure her students and staff 
have the tools and resources they need to be 
successful in the classroom and a safe and 
caring place to learn. She developed innova-
tive solutions for the challenges that inevitably 
come with a rapidly growing community and 
school district-and most recently, she led 
CUSD through the unprecedented challenges 
wrought by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Her kindness, compassion, and commitment 
to excellence will be felt by future generations 
who pass through the Chandler Unified School 
District. Because of Dr. Casteel, Chandler’s 
students will continue to receive a comprehen-
sive, quality education that prepares them for 
ventures beyond their school days. 
Arizona owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. 
Casteel. Her devotion to strengthening our 
community’s public education system will be 
felt long after her retirement. In this spirit of 
gratitude, I rise today to honor the esteemed 
career of Dr. Camille Casteel and wish her the 
best in wherever life takes her next.

IN RECOGNITION OF MICHIGAN’S 
CARIBBEAN 
AMERICAN 
HERIT-
AGE MONTH 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Caribbean American Heritage 
Month and celebrate the work of Caribbean- 
American descendants and culture across the 
13th Congressional District. 
National 
Caribbean 
American 
Heritage 
Month began in 1999 with outreach to Presi-
dent Bill Clinton asking for the recognition of 
August as National Caribbean American Herit-
age Month. This resulted in the first White 
House Caribbean American Community Brief-
ing being held at the Clinton White House in 
1999. In June 2000, the Institute of Caribbean 
Studies (ICS) took leadership of the project, 
organizing numerous events in Washington, 
D.C. In 2001, ICS, in collaboration with Trans-
Africa Forum and the Caribbean Staff Associa-
tion of the World Bank, continued to organize 
events during June, promoting recognition of 
June as National Caribbean American Herit-
age Month, bringing even more interest in Na-
tional Caribbean American Heritage Month. 
The effort gained even more traction in 
2004 when an Official Campaign for June as 
National Caribbean American Heritage Month 
was launched upon the tabling of a Bill in the 
US Congress by Congresswoman BARBARA 
LEE, with language provided by ICS Founder 
and President, Dr. Claire Nelson. ICS worked 
with the Office of Congresswoman BARBARA 
LEE to galvanize support for the Bill from orga-
nizations across the country and organized 
events on Capitol Hill in recognition of June in 
2004. The Bill was reintroduced and passed 
the House in June 2005, and the Senate in 
February 2006. A Proclamation making the 
Resolution official was signed by President 
George Bush on June 5, 2006. 
Please join me in recognizing National Car-
ibbean American Heritage Month and the con-
tributions of Caribbean Americans in our coun-
try and in the 13th Congressional District.

IN HONOR OF KEN WHITE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Ken White, the recently retired 
Executive Director of the Peninsula Humane 
Society. As Mr. White noted, he was retiring 
on his 469th birthday, as measured in dog 
years. He joined the Peninsula Humane Soci-
ety in 2002 and his successes at this organi-
zation have been historic for this beloved or-
ganization. 
Upon his arrival, Ken White and the Penin-
sula Humane Society guaranteed a home to 
every adoptable dog or cat in their care, a 
promise they have kept ever since. In 2003, 
the organization expanded its promise to in-
clude as many ill and injured and behaviorally 
challenged pets as possible. In 2005, the Hu-
mane Society purchased a mobile veterinary 
clinic and provided spay/neutering surgeries 
for animals in some of the most underserved 
communities in the county. 
More than 22,000 households contribute to 
the work of the Peninsula Humane Society. 
The euthanasia rate has decreased 98 per-
cent since 1970. 1200 volunteers allow PHS 
to function as an integral part of our commu-
nity. 
In 2006, Ken and his board bought an old 
Burlingame warehouse. Through a major gift 
and the loving care of volunteers, they were 
able to open this facility as the Center for 
Compassion to house charitably funded pro-
grams through state-of-the-art facilities. The 
progress is amazing. When Ken arrived in our 
community, the percentage of animals re-
leased live back into the community was 53 
percent. Today, it is 89 percent. There are 
tens of thousands of peninsula animals who 
found their forever-home thanks to the kind 
heart and amazing fundraising talents of Ken 
White. 
Not content to be an over-achieving humane 
organization, Ken, his board, employees and 
volunteers have set a reach goal. The organi-
zation now owns 260 acres of land in San 
Mateo County which will be turned into an ani-
mal sanctuary. It will be the first in our nation 
owned and operated by a humane society. 
Ken has seen a tortoise survive being driv-
en over by a vehicle, and today that tortoise 
thrives as Ken’s pet. He watched a falcon be 
released into the wild after severe injuries 
were healed. Reptiles have been visitors to his 
home. He and his apparently patient wife, Lisa 
Crane, have also taken in a pot-bellied pig 
and an Argentinian horned frog. If there was 
a wild party at Ken’s home and the noise ever 
got to be too much, I’m sure there was always 
a pet or two that was more than willing to lay 
down the law to Ken. 
Ken White got into the business of running 
animal shelters from an unusual background. 
He holds a Master’s Degree in creative writ-
ing. After a series of jobs, he was eventually 
invited to create educational materials for a 
local shelter. As a child he was never allowed 
to own a pet, but then as a young man he 
was suddenly surrounded by animals. It was 
love at first sight. 
As he leaves his longtime position, he goes 
out on a national high note. The 260 acre 
sanctuary in the San Mateo County mountains 
will be for medically or behaviorally challenged 
dogs and cats with low adoption rates. This fa-
cility will be a huge step forward for those that 
are able to live out a full life, but without trou-
blesome humans and their nitpicking rules as 
preconditions. So goes the dream of San 
Mateo County’s Dr. Doolittle, the man who 
talks to our animals. I have long admired Ken 
White for his ingenuity and can-do spirit. The 
San Mateo community and I wish him well as 
he leaves his avid fans, of all breeds, behind. 
Undoubtedly there’s a movie about Ken that 
will someday be released on Netflix: Ken 
White: Lifesaver, Tortoise Daddy and Snake 
Whisperer. Watch for it, streaming soon.

REMEMBERING ARNOLD PERL 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
my respects to a great civic leader of Mem-
phis, Arnold E. Perl, who passed on Tuesday. 
A labor and employment lawyer for more than 
40 years, Mr. Perl served on the Memphis and 
Shelby County Airport Authority, including 16 
years as its chairman, where he advocated 
the idea of an aerotropolis linking the airport to 
the commerce of our city. He was also a past 
General Counsel of the Tennessee Chamber 
of Commerce & Industry as well as Secretary 
and General Counsel of the Greater Memphis 
Regional Chamber. Mr. Perl served as the 
Chairman of the New Arena Public Building 
Authority, which built the $250 million FedEx 
Forum. Very active in the Jewish community, 
he served as the 45th President of Temple 
Israel from 2006 to 2008. Mr. Perl also served 
on the Board of Trustees of the University of 
Tennessee from 1996 to 2002 and was sup-
portive of the Hope Scholarship funded by the 
state lottery I worked to establish as a state 
senator. For his efforts founding the Japan- 
Tennessee Society and his contributions to 
Japanese-American relations, he was honored 
in 2007 with membership in the Order of the 
Rising Sun by the Emperor of Japan. In 2006,

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
BRADFORD FREEMAN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Mr. Bradford Freeman, a member of the 
Greatest Generation and a true hero. He be-
longed to Company E, 506th Parachute Infan-
try Regiment under the 101st Airborne Divi-
sion, also known as Easy Company. Their ex-
ploits were memorialized in the HBO mini-se-
ries ‘‘Band of Brothers.’’ 
Mr. Freeman was born in Mississippi on 
September 4, 1924. He started his freshman 
year at Mississippi State University before en-
listing in the Army in December of 1942. He 
finished his freshman year and reported in 
April 1943. He first reported to Camp Shelby, 
and then Fort McClellan for 13 weeks of basic 
training. He trained as a paratrooper at Fort 
Benning, Georgia. In North Carolina, he joined 
the 541st which evolved into the 101st. 
After midnight on D-Day, nineteen-year-old 
Freeman made his first combat jump. On June 
5, 1944 he boarded a C–47, among a fleet of 
87 aircraft, and travelled across the English 
channel over Normandy. German antiaircrafts 
broke the soldier’s silence. He jumped from 
the aircraft at 200 miles per hour, 100 miles 
per hour faster than normal jump speed. Free-
man landed safely and was assigned to guard 
a crossroads near the Brecourt Manor farm, 
where the batallion would later take out four 
German artillery pieces. He heard Navy shells 
flying overhead towards targets further inland. 
Freeman served for two years, 11 months 
and 20 days in the United States Army and 
left the service as a private first class. He re-
turned home to his family on December 2, 
1945. He reunited with his childhood friend 
Willie Gurley, and the two were married in 
1947. They had two daughters, Beverly Clark 
and Rebbecca Louis. After over 60 years of 
marriage, Willie passed away in 2008. After 
returning from war, Mr. Freeman returned to 
farming. He loved to hunt, fish, and sit on his 
front porch. 
I am deeply grateful for Bradford Freeman’s 
lifetime of service to this country and the state 
of Mississippi. His sacrifices will never be for-
gotten, and his service always revered. 
ADDRESSING THE SITUATION IN 
KAZAKHSTAN 
CONCERNING 
KLEPTOCRACY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity 
today to recognize the importance of the bilat-
eral relationship between the United States 
and Kazakhstan. Following the dissolution of 
the Soviet Union, the United States, on De-
cember 25, 1991, was the first country to rec-
ognize Kazakhstan’s independence. There-
after, the Clinton Administration facilitated the 
entry of Kazakh oil to the world market via the 
CPC export pipeline. American companies 
were the first to enter the Kazakh economy 
but were soon pushed aside from the most at-
tractive projects, such as Chinese companies 
which 
have 
invariably 
won 
international 
tenders for privatized assets. 
I rise today to express my growing concern 
over an article published by author Tom 
Burgis. The article contains information sur-
rounding leaked documents that indicate the 
former Kazakh president’s son-in-law, Timur 
Kulibayev, designed a scheme that would re-
sult in him receiving tens of millions of dollars 
from contracts related to a multibillion-dollar 
gas pipeline between Central Asia and China. 
The Asia Gas Pipeline project was to accel-
erate a shift of economic power from the West 
to the East. Built jointly by Kazakhstan and 
China, these pipelines would stretch around 
2000 miles and be funded by Chinese loans. 
‘‘The first two lines would cost $7.5bn, with a 
third to follow for some $3bn and a fourth after 
that.’’ 
Author Tom Burgis states, ‘‘Mr. Kulibayev, 
who has served on the Russian energy giant’s 
board since 2011, is the son-in-law of the 
former Kazakh president and has wide-ranging 
business interests, from banking to mining and 
real estate. As one of the most powerful offi-
cials in the country, he oversaw the state com-
panies that awarded contracts to build the 
pipelines across Kazakhstan. Emails sent be-
tween 2008 and 2014 and leaked by a whis-
tleblower contain detailed descriptions of a 
set-up that it appears would allow Mr. 
Kulibayev to receive a share of the profits 
from pipeline contracts granted to ETK, a 
company owned by Russian businessman 
Alexander Karmanov.’’ 
This is not Timur Kulibayev’s first time com-
ing to the attention of the West. In 2007, it 
was revealed that he was the mystery buyer 
of a multimillion-dollar Sunninghill Park estate 
that the Queen had given Prince Andrew as a 
wedding present. He also has faced money- 
laundering allegations in a Swiss case, which 
was eventually dropped. 
The United States currently spends about 
$115 million a year on global anti-corruption 
programs. Unfortunately, many of the funds 
we put toward anti-corruption efforts get 
trapped in multi-year technical programs that 
are unable to respond nimbly to sudden op-
portunities for governance reform. If the United 
States 
does 
intervene, 
authoritarian 
kleptocrats will gain ground. The United States 
needs to be proactive in developing strategic 
relationships and agile programs that will keep 
us relevant in moments of historic opportunity. 
Recently, U.S. Senator BEN CARDIN (D–Md.) 
and Senator ROGER WICKER (R–Miss.), incom-
ing Chair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and 
Co-Chair, respectively, introduced the Coun-
tering 
Russian 
and 
Other 
Overseas 
Kleptocracy (CROOK) Act to upgrade Amer-
ica’s 
anti-corruption 
efforts 
by 
targeting 
kleptocracy at the source. The CROOK Act 
would create an anticorruption action fund to 
help activists leverage public sentiment to 
achieve lasting reform, without any additional 
cost to taxpayers. The fund would be financed 
through a $5 million surcharge on entities 
found liable for $50 million or more in criminal 
fines and penalties under the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (FCPA). Based on data from the 
last 10 years, this bill would put an additional 
$16 million per year toward global anti-corrup-
tion work. Funds would continue to accrue 
until a historic window of opportunity opens, at 
which point funds would be rapidly deployed 
to help establish the rule of law. 
Fighting corruption is an imperative for the 
United States. As a beacon of liberty and the 
rule of law, it is our duty and the purest ex-
pression of our values. It is also a highly prac-
tical form of soft power that advances our na-
tional security. As Kazakhstan is aspiring to be 
a strategic partner of the United States, I call 
on my colleagues to join me in urging the 
Biden Administration to review this case of 
kleptocracy 
and 
corrupt 
officials 
from 
Kazakhstan and assure that it will be included 
in our Government’s discussions regarding 
this important part of the world.

HONORING SAM AND ARLENE 
DANIELS 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. and Mrs. Sam Daniels from Wel-
lington, Kentucky. 
Sam and Arlene Daniels visited in Kentucky 
in 1999. The trip resulted in the purchase of 
a home and a move to rural Menifee County. 
This move placed them on a path that led to 
assisting people in need by feeding the hungry 
in their area. 
In 2001, Arlene Daniels was called by God 
to start a food pantry at their church, 
Dayspring. Her sister-in-law donated $2500 to 
help start the pantry in memory of Sam’s 
brother Albert Daniels. Pastor Andy Timblin 
shared the food pantry idea with the con-
gregation and a visitor offered a $1,000 dona-
tion. On May 14, 2001, the Dayspring Food 
Pantry became a reality. 
For twenty years, community support and 
grants have brought much needed funds to 
the Dayspring Food Pantry. The pantry now 
helps over 400 families a month and has com-
munity 
partnerships 
with 
senior 
citizens, 
schools, churches, and other agencies to lend 
a hand to those in need. The Daniels have 
served as directors of the pantry since its be-
ginning. Led by their strong faith, Brother Sam 
Daniels and Sister Arlene Daniels have im-
pacted their community for generations to 
come. 
On the 20th anniversary of the founding of 
Dayspring Food Pantry, it is my honor to rec-
ognize these amazing people and thank them

COURAGE 
WHEN 
THEY 
ARE 
MOST NEEDED 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I am 
a proud progressive Texas Democrat in the 
tradition of the late Governor Ann Richards 
and my predecessors Barbara Jordan and 
Mickey Leland so it may hurt more than help 
them to say that Congresswoman LIZ CHENEY 
of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican in 
the House, Senator MITT ROMNEY, the 2012 
Republican standard-bearer, and President 
George W. Bush, the last Republican presi-
dent to amass a popular vote majority, exceed 
50 percent in approval ratings, and win reelec-
tion all have my undying respect for the man-
ner in which they have stood steadfast in de-
fense of the Constitution, the country, and 
their principles in the face of brutal, withering, 
and unwarranted attack by their party’s leader-
ship and rank and file. 
All of them have repeatedly rejected and de-
nounced publicly, unequivocally, and fiercely 
the Republican ‘‘Big Lie’’ that the 2020 presi-
dential election was stolen and rife with fraud. 
They are modern-day profiles in courage. 
They all embody John F. Kennedy’s dictum 
that ‘‘sometimes party loyalty demands too 
much.’’ 
Like many Members of Congress, in the 
course of my service I have found often that 
vigorous debate and acceptance of different 
views, if allowed to be heard, can result in so-
cially transformative and life-affirming legisla-
tion, such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 
1965 Voting Rights Act, and the 1994 Vio-
lence Against Women Act. 
Some might think it surprising for a member 
of an opposing party to go against the conven-
tion of non-interference when one’s adversary 
is in the process of inflicting harm upon itself. 
I have chosen to ignore this convention be-
cause I am a firm believer in the promise of 
a more perfect union. 
And I believe in America and its future. 
Our children listen to and absorb what we 
say and do. 
We cannot let them see the brutalization of 
voices that are telling the truth about January 
6 and the attack on the Citadel of Democracy 
without defending those voices. 
I believe these persons are patriots and I 
join them in my affection for the written values 
of this nation evidenced in our Constitution. 
I am a constitutional patriot who believes 
Bush, ROMNEY, CHENEY have put America 
first. 
Congresswoman CHENEY, the House Re-
publican Conference Chair, has drawn fire for 
being unrelenting in her defense of constitu-
tional government and for not backing down 
one iota from her claim that the domestic in-
surrection led by terrorists who stormed the 
U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, for the 
avowed purpose of disrupting Congress from 
performing its constitutionally mandated duty 
to tally the votes cast by presidential electors 
and announce the results to the nation and 
the world was the intentional result of Donald 
Trump’s handiwork: 
The President of the United States sum-
moned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit 
the flame of this attack. Everything that fol-
lowed was his doing. None of this would have 
happened without the President. The Presi-
dent could have immediately and forcefully 
intervened to stop the violence. He did not. 
There has never been a greater betrayal by a 
President of the United States of his office 
and his oath to the Constitution. 
We cannot ignore the fact that these do-
mestic terrorists were intending to kill officers 
of the Congress, the Vice-President, other 
Members, and law enforcement officers if 
need be. 
Sen. ROMNEY of Utah, a state carried by 
Trump by more than 20 percentage points and 
the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, is 
the only Republican senator who voted to con-
vict and remove Trump from office for high 
crimes and misdemeanors. Twice. 
Former President George W. Bush was one 
of the first Republicans to congratulate Presi-
dent-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect 
KAMALA HARRIS on their election victory and 
has stated that the GOP is embarking on a 
‘‘suicide path’’ with its adherence to the Big 
Lie and flirtation with the idea of forming a 
congressional ‘‘Anglo-Saxon Caucus.’’ 
More Republican leaders are needed to join 
this ‘‘Chorus of the Courageous,’’ to put coun-
try over party, and to do their part to preserve 
and keep real the American boast that this is 
a land of government of, by, and for the peo-
ple. 
At several moments in our Nation’s past, 
men and women of principle, courage, and 
unyielding commitment to the Nation’s found-
ing ideals have stood forward at moments of 
maximum peril and danger in defense of the 
country’s enduring values and principles. 
Men like Congressman L. Brooks Hayes of 
Arkansas, who alienated powerful governor 
Orval E. Faubus during the 1957 integration 
crisis when he refused to support Faubus’ ef-
fort to keep the Little Rock public schools ra-
cially segregated. 
Or like U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater, R–Ariz., 
U.S. House Minority Leader John Rhodes, R– 
Ariz., and U.S. Senate Minority Leader Hugh 
Scott, R–Pa., who went to the White House to 
tell Richard Nixon, the winner of one of the 
greatest landslide victories in history, that he 
must resign, or he would be impeached by the 
House of Representatives and convicted by 
the Senate. 
Or women like U.S. Sen. Margaret Chase 
Smith of Maine, the first woman to serve both 
the House and the Senate and the first Re-
publican senator to denounce the demagogue 
Sen. Joe McCarthy during the height of the 
Red Scare. In her famous ‘‘Declaration of 
Conscience’’ speech to the Senate, she said: 
‘‘Those of us who shout the loudest about 
Americanism in making character assassina-
tions are all too frequently those who, by our 
own words and acts, ignore some of the basic 
principles of Americanism.’’ [. . .] 
‘‘It is high time we stopped thinking politi-
cally as Republicans and Democrats about 
elections and started thinking patriotically as 
Americans about national security based on 
individual freedom.’’ 
In perpetuating Trump’s Big Lie, Republican 
leaders are cravenly choosing narrow partisan 
interests over the national interest. 
They are rejecting the wisdom of the found-
ing father of conservatism, the English states-
man Sir Edmund Burke, who said: 
[The national state] is to be looked on with 
other reverence; because it is not a partner-
ship in things subservient only to the gross 
animal existence of a temporary and perish-
able nature. It is a partnership in all science; 
a partnership in all art; a partnership in 
every virtue, and in all perfection. As the 
ends of such a partnership cannot be ob-
tained in many generations, it becomes a 
partnership not only between those who are 
living, but between those who are living, 
those who are dead, and those who are to be 
born. 
Burke understood, as did conservative 
statesmen, political leaders, and scholars that 
an elected official’s duty was not simply to be 
an ‘‘instructed delegate,’’ parroting and fol-
lowing their constituents’ temporary and incho-
ate passions, but also to be an ‘‘enlightened 
trustee’’ bringing experience and judgment to 
elevate and inform the public discourse and 
understanding. 
What is needed today is a semblance of the 
will and courage of Abraham Lincoln, the 
greatest Republican of all. In his famous 1860 
Cooper Union Address, Lincoln exhorted and 
inspired adherents to hold true to their beliefs 
in equality and that slavery was a moral evil: 
What will convince that we do not threat-
en their property? This and this only: cease 
to call slavery wrong and join them in call-
ing it right. All they ask, we can grant, if we 
think slavery right. All we ask, they can 
grant if they think it wrong. Right and 
wrong is the precise fact upon which depends 
the whole controversy. Thinking it wrong, as 
we do, can we yield? 
Let us not grope for some middle ground 
between right and wrong. Let us not search 
in vain for a policy of don’t care on a ques-
tion about which we do care. Nor let us be 
frightened by threats of destruction to the 
government. 
Let us have faith that right makes might, 
and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to 
do our duty[.] 
This is the moral and political courage that 
is so conspicuous by its absence in Repub-
licans leaders today. America’s strength lies in 
the ability of everyone—Democrats, Repub-
licans, and independents—to speak truth loud-
ly and proudly in the face of adversity, and to 
power.

Mr. McClure was born on December 11,

Racing was part of his family: his uncle Larry

starts in the NASCAR Cup Series. His best 
finish came in 2013 at Daytona, when he 
placed eighth in the Xfinity Series season 
opener. Health challenges ended his driving 
career in 2016. He also formed Martin- 
McClure Racing in 2015 as an owner with 
former driver Hal Martin. The team won two 
races in the K&N Pro Series with drivers Chad 
Finchum and Austin Cindric. 
Mr. McClure is survived by his parents Jerry

Mabreigh, 
Maryleigh,

HONORING ANNIE ORSINI AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in honoring Annie Orsini, Assistant Principal at 
Westridge Elementary School and Jordan 
Creek 
Elementary 
School in West Des 
Moines, as Iowan of the Week. 
Assistant Principals across Iowa’s Third 
Congressional District and our entire country 
play a critically important role in the overall 
success of the schools where they serve— 
working tirelessly to foster strong relationships 
between the school and the community, estab-
lish a positive and inclusive learning environ-
ment for students, make sure parents are in-
formed and involved, effectively lead both in-
structional and support staff, monitor the day- 
to-day logistical operations of their educational 
facilities, and more. An Assistant Principal’s 
plate is always full, always being added to, 
and often includes a plethora of ’other duties 
as assigned’ tasks to complete. Our schools, 
students, and communities all benefit from 
their dedication to making a positive impact on 
early education. 
In Annie’s case, her efforts are doubled as 
she serves as Assistant Principal for two ele-
mentary schools. With roughly 1,500 students 
and families and approximately 125 instruc-
tional and support staff under her care, she 
has a big job to tackle every single week. 
Whether it’s mentoring teachers, analyzing 
data to create impactful plans, addressing 
logistical and operational issues such as trans-
portation and scheduling, working on extra- 
and co-curricular programs, or nurturing posi-
tive peer relationships between students, her 
days are filled with meeting the needs of oth-
ers. She sets the vision, inspires others, maxi-
mizes available resources, and constantly in-
novates in order to create an optimal learning 
environment for students and staff. 
Annie is an educator who truly believes not 
only in the power of teaching and empowering 
kids to learn, but also in the very real impact 
effective teaching has on the system as a 
whole. Her efforts extend beyond improving 
more traditional classroom instruction of sub-
jects like math, English, and history to include 
social emotional learning and addressing men-
tal health. She’s working with staff on efforts 
that help kids get organized, show empathy, 
make decisions, see other people’s perspec-
tive, and more. In being more intentional about 
nurturing both the head and the heart, Annie 
is creating environments in which students can 
feel safe, special, and develop their unique 
gifts before striking out into the world. 
Throughout the last year, the COVID–19 
pandemic has placed incredible burdens on 
many areas of our society, and few places 
have been as directly challenged as our 
schools. Originally planned for implementation 
over three years, Annie and her team had to 
roll out a scaled-up online learning program in 
only six months. They had to figure out how 
to get kids to school safely and keep them 
safe while they were in the classroom, and 
neither challenge came with a playbook. Time 
and again, Assistant Principals like Annie have 
been called upon to work even harder than 
usual to best support students, educators, 
support staff, families, and their communities 
as everyone navigates the global health crisis. 
For that reason amongst others, I am proud 
to support a House Resolution calling for April 
5th–9th to be recognized as National Assistant 
Principals Week. These folks deserve our 
thanks and this opportunity for all Americans 
to reflect on their meaningful contributions to 
our communities. 
For nearly two decades, Annie Orsini has 
dedicated herself to furthering the growth and 
achievement of young students, teachers, and 
local schools. Her passion is clear and inspir-
ing. Each day she makes a difference, and 
our future is brighter because of her efforts. I 
am proud to recognize her as our Iowan of the 
Week.

ceiving the 2020 Robert Jackson Eury Memo-
rial Award. 
Deputy Chief Hughes started his career with 
the Concord Police Department in 1998 as a 
patrol officer. He rose through the ranks be-
fore being promoted to Deputy Chief in 2019 
by CPD Chief Gary Gacek, and previously 
served with CPD in the Special Investigations 
Unit, Criminal Investigations, and the Office of 
Management & Planning. He was an original 
member of the SWAT team, where he also 
served as SWAT commander. Jimmy is a 
graduate of the Police Executive Research 
Forum—Senior Management Institute for Po-
lice—Session 67 and a 1998 graduate of 
Pfeiffer University with a BS in Business Man-
agement/Finance. 
Throughout 
his 
career, 
Deputy 
Chief 
Hughes has worked to establish relationships 
and partnerships with the community, fellow 
law enforcement officers, and criminal justice 
professionals. Jimmy is hard working, driven, 
and has said that he attributes his success 
and longevity to the Golden Rule, treating 
people the way he wants to be treated. Dep-
uty Chief Hughes is married and has five chil-
dren. In his spare time, Jimmy enjoys restor-
ing classic vehicles. 
The Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award 
is presented in memory of Robert Jackson 
Eury, a man who lost his life in the line of duty 
while serving as a Cabarrus County law en-
forcement officer. This award keeps Mr. Eury’s 
legacy alive through officers who share his 
same admirable and commendable spirit in 
Cabarrus 
County. 
Deputy 
Chief 
Jimmy 
Hughes fits the mold of esteemed law enforce-
ment officers in our community set by Robert 
Eury. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Deputy Chief Jimmy Hughes for 
receiving the 2020 Robert Jackson Eury Me-
morial Award. We all wish him well as he con-
tinues to make a positive impact in our com-
munity.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
HONORING 
THE 
MILITARY 
SPOUSES 
OF 
CAMBRIA AND SOMERSET COUN-
TIES 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the military 
spouses of Cambria and Somerset Counties 
and to commemorate the 12th Annual Military 
Spouse Appreciation Day Ceremony in Johns-
town, Pennsylvania. 
In 1984, President Ronald Reagan estab-
lished that the Friday before Mother’s Day 
would be Military Spouses Appreciation Day, 
which honors the service and sacrifice of mili-
tary spouses. 
Like their partners in uniform, military 
spouses also answer the call to serve our na-
tion. Their unwavering commitment to our 
servicemembers and families is a key part of 
America’s story and success. 
As the husband of a Naval officer, I under-
stand firsthand the challenges that many mili-
tary spouses face, and I am incredibly grateful 
for their role in supporting our Armed Forces 
and the defense of our Nation. 
Today’s ceremony, made possible by the 
Johnstown Veteran Community Initiatives, 
Wessel & Company, and the American Red 
Cross, is a well-deserved opportunity to recog-
nize these outstanding Pennsylvanians who 
have sacrificed so much. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, it is my privilege to honor the 
military spouses of Cambria and Somerset 
Counties and to thank them for their service 
and sacrifice for our Nation. On Military 
Spouse Appreciation Day and every day of the 
year, I ask that Pennsylvanians join me in 
praying for the wellbeing and perseverance of 
our local military families—as well as for the 
peace and safety of our Nation.

IN HONOR OF NEW HAMPSHIRE’S 
CITY AND TOWN CLERKS 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
during Municipal and Town Clerks Apprecia-
tion Week to honor New Hampshire’s City and 
Town Clerks for the hard work that they do 
each and every day to ensure our local gov-
ernments run smoothly and that our citizens 
get the services they need. 
Municipal clerks deliver important public 
services and each year interact with hundreds 
of members of their community. Whether 
maintaining public records, registering motor 
vehicles, licensing dogs and other pets, or ad-
ministering local elections, chances are you’ve 
relied on your local clerk more than once in 
the last year and on countless occasions 
throughout your life. 
During this pandemic, we’ve asked city and 
town clerks to go above and beyond under in-
credibly difficult circumstances. The COVID– 
19 pandemic necessarily shut down many as-
pects of society in order to keep our families 
and communities safe. But the work of a clerk 
must continue to ensure that citizens are 
served and that the wheels of local govern-
ment continue to move forward. 
Administering an election in the best of 
times is incredibly challenging. Doing so in a 
pandemic meant clerks had to rewrite the 
playbook and develop and implement new 
best practices on short notice. New Hampshire 
residents voted in record numbers last fall, 
and even with an unprecedented number of 
ballots cast early and by mail, our elections 
ran as smoothly as ever because of the dedi-
cation and hard work of our municipal clerks. 
Providing 
services 
and 
maintaining 
vital 
records in the best of times is complex and 
time consuming. Doing so in a pandemic 
meant clerks needed to adapt to meet the 
needs of their neighbors to do their job while 
keeping residents safe. These are no small 
feats, and we are grateful. 
The New Hampshire City and Town Clerks 
Code of Ethics states: ‘‘Town and city clerks 
are elected and/or appointed by the citizens 
who have the utmost trust and faith in the 
clerk’s ability to fairly and honestly serve their 
community. Let us all live up to that trust with 
honor and dignity.’’ Over the last year, our mu-
nicipal clerks have indeed lived up to that trust 
and performed their duties with honor and dig-
nity throughout New Hampshire. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank our municipal clerks for their dedication 
to New Hampshire and convey the thanks of 
a grateful state for their continued public serv-
ice.

HONORING ANNIE LOPEZ 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the lifetime achievement of Annie 
Lopez, a nationally recognized artist and com-
munity leader in Arizona. A pioneer of the 
Phoenix art scene, Ms. Lopez shattered bar-
riers to elevate the work of local and Latino 
artists across our state, and her living legacy 
deserves to be etched in our historical record 
for all to remember. 
At a young age, she discovered her passion 
and vision for the arts. In 1982, Ms. Lopez be-
came a member of the Movimiento Artistico 
del Rio Salado (MARS), a nationally ac-
claimed Chicano Arts organization. Ms. Lopez 
made it her mission to re-define how Chicano 
art is perceived in the broader art community. 
She became an immediate sensation, capti-
vating audiences through her storytelling fo-
cused on her own experiences in Arizona and 
shared family heritage. Ms. Lopez proudly 
wears her heritage on her sleeve—and she 
translated that passion literally with her most 
recent work, hand-crafted dresses made from 
stitched-together prints on tamale paper that 
dawns excerpts of Arizona’s SB 1070 and her 
grandparents’ immigration cards. Through her 
art, she starts a dialogue about racism, stereo-
types, and the local art world—making poign-
ant statements about Latino culture with her 
unmatched sense of humor. 
A fourth-generation Arizonan, Ms. Lopez 
has always been a relentless advocate for our 
community. She has served as a board mem-
ber for MARS, and as a panelist for the City 
of Phoenix and the Arizona Commission on 
the Arts. Ms. Lopez has exhibited her work in 
venues across the nation, including the Smith-
sonian Institution, the National Museum of 
Mexican Art in Chicago, the Phoenix Art Mu-
seum, Tucson Museum of Art, and the Arizona 
State University Art Museum. In the beginning 
of 2020, in recognition of her artistic excel-
lence, Ms. Lopez was the first Latina artist to 
have her work displayed in the National Mu-
seum of Women in the Arts in Washington, 
D.C.—cementing her legacy as one of the 
greatest artists Phoenix has ever known. 
Ms. Lopez has given all her time, heart and 
soul to the betterment of Phoenix and Arizona. 
She has inspired so many young artists to 
achieve their highest aspirations, and those 
who learn from her enter the world with a 
greater appreciation for Chicano art history. 
I humbly rise to extend my heartfelt grati-
tude and appreciation to Ms. Lopez for im-
mense contributions to our state. A dedicated 
artist, advocate, and community servant, her 
life’s work remains a local favorite in Phoenix, 
and I wish her the best as she continues to 
create a legacy that will be felt by Arizonans 
for generations to come.

HONORING ECOS ESSENTIAL 
WORKERS 
HON. MARILYN STRICKLAND 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor ECOS’ dedicated essential 
workers from the sustainable manufacturing 
facility located in Lacey, Washington, in the 
10th Congressional District. 
Family-owned, women-owned, and operated 
since 1967, ECOS is known for being a pio-
neer of environmentally friendly and sustain-
able cleaning products. In addition to its facility 
in the South Sound, ECOS operates manufac-
turing plants across our nation, employing 
hundreds of Americans. Just this month, 
ECOS officially became a climate positive 
brand, stepping up as an environmental leader 
in Washington, and across the country, by re-
generating more natural resources than it con-
sumes. 
Not only does ECOS play a leading role in 
the cleaning products industry as a climate 
positive manufacturer and embody a bold vi-
sion for a sustainable future, ECOS has also 
been an essential business in the fight against 
COVID–19. Since the start of the pandemic, 
ECOS’ essential workers have been working 
around the clock to manufacture sustainable 
cleaning supplies. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud that ECOS es-
sential workers represent my district and my 
community in the South Sound. I want to per-
sonally thank and recognize them for their 
dedication and patriotism in making safe and 
eco-friendly cleaning products throughout the 
COVID–19 pandemic. They are the frontline 
heroes that are powering our region and our 
nation as we recover, rebuild, and emerge 
from this pandemic on stronger, more sustain-
able footing. For all of these reasons, it is my 
privilege to recognize the tremendous con-
tributions of ECOS’ essential workers.

EXPLANATION REGARDING 
COSPONSORING A BILL 
HON. BRAD SHERMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s appro-
priate for me to republish my statement of 
March 11, 2019 on the meaning of cospon-
soring legislation. Much of that statement was 
a republication of my statement of September 
29, 2010, as I’ve maintained a consistent pol-
icy on this issue. The following is a republica-
tion of my statement of March 11, 2019. 
‘‘Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, Sep-
tember 29, 2010, stated for the RECORD: 
‘Madam Speaker, I wish to clarify that when 
I cosponsor a bill, it does not necessarily 
mean that I agree with every part of it. At n 
minimum, my cosponsorship indicates that I 
support moving the bill forward through the 
legislative process, including being marked up 
in committee, and if sent to the floor by the 
relevant committee(s), then subject to consid-
eration and amendment on the floor.’ 
Let me reiterate that 2010 statement and 
provide additional background. I believe in the 
legislative process. I believe bills are improved 
during committee mark-ups and by consider-
ation of amendments on the floor. The effect 
of cosponsoring a bill is to signal to the rel-
evant committee chair(s) that I believe the bill 
should be marked-up in committee, a process 
that may well improve the bill (and in some 
cases may make the bill worse). When I de-
cide to cosponsor a bill after it has completed 
the committee process, I do signal to the 
Speaker and Rules Committee that I believe 
the bill should be considered on the floor, and 
almost always under an open rule.’’

CELEBRATING THE WORTHY BOYS 
AND GIRLS CAMP 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the honorable work of the 
Worthy Boys and Girls Camp in Rock Hill, 
South Carolina. 
Since 1950, the Worthy Boys and Girls 
Camp has provided a week-long opportunity 
for York County youth to experience the out-
doors each summer. It is the only free over-
night camp in the area, planned and organized 
entirely by the Rock Hill Police Department. 
Through a variety of sports activities and 
trainings, children build upon their strengths to 
improve individual self-esteem, develop new 
interpersonal skills, and gain a greater appre-
ciation for their surrounding community. 
Aside from providing a safe and supportive 
environment, camp staff instill in young boys 
and girls a sense of consistent teamwork, 
commitment, and sharing. Nearly 200 children 
are exposed to new ideas, places, and friend-
ships every summer that will teach them les-
sons they’ll carry forward through life. 
The Worthy Boys and Girls Camp is a shin-
ing example of the sense of community felt 
across Rock Hill. 
Locals enjoy supporting the camp through 
their donations and various volunteer efforts. 
Week-long sessions are staffed by police offi-
cers, department staff members, and volun-
teers of all ages who dedicate long hours and 
resources to ensuring the camp’s continued 
success. Many police officers who attended 
the program as students, like Rock Hill Police 
Chief Chris Watts, now serve as camp coun-
selors. 
The lifechanging work of the Worthy Boys 
and Girls Camp has created positive relation-
ships between local law enforcement officers 
and youth for decades. The camp plays an in-
tegral role in developing Rock Hill’s youngest 
talent into promising leaders. I congratulate 
the Worthy Boys and Girls Camp on a suc-
cessful 72 years, and I look forward to watch-
ing them serve our community’s children in the 
future.

IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL 
NURSES WEEK 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize National Nurses Week, a 
celebration to acknowledge our nurses for 
their unwavering courage, hard work and dedi-
cation. Our frontline heroes have been at the 
forefront of this global pandemic, and their 
sacrifice is well-deserving of recognition. 
For many healthcare workers, this past year 
has been the toughest challenge of their ca-
reer. Despite these unprecedent obstacles, 
they have continued to show bravery and self-
lessness by risking their own health to provide 
patients with the utmost care. 
Along with the fear of the unknown and the 
rigorous work schedule, our frontline line work-
ers have made huge personal sacrifices as 
well. Despite living with the fear of contracting 
COVID–19 themselves or potentially bringing 
the virus home to their loved ones; these 
healthcare workers still manage to do their 
jobs and protect our communities. 
In celebration of National Nurses Week, I 
encourage everyone to take the time to thank 
our nurses for choosing selflessness over self- 
preservation and rising to the challenge of 
COVID–19. Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask 
that you rise with me to celebrate National 
Nurses Week.

IN RECOGNITION OF DAVID 
ELLIOT 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor David Elliot from 
Taos, New Mexico. On Wednesday, April 28, 
2021, President Biden delivered his first ad-
dress to a Joint Session of Congress, 100 
days into his first term. 
When President Biden took the oath of of-
fice, he pledged that help was on the way. 
Thanks to our work together to enact the 
American Rescue Plan, help is finally here. 
The hardworking people in New Mexico and 
all across the country have also shown us 
what true community looks like. David is one 
of those community heroes. 
In a typical year, I would invite him to join 
me in the House Chamber for the Joint Ad-
dress. COVID–19 safety protocols mean this 
year’s in-person attendance will be limited and 
we will be watching from our beautiful New 
Mexico. But I did not want to miss this impor-
tant opportunity to honor David. 
David’s commitment to serving others is in-
spiring. His work to bring people and organiza-
tions together to establish the Enchanted Cir-
cle of Community Organizations Active in Dis-
aster is the embodiment of community. The 
Enchanted Circle COAD helped others in 
Taos, Colfax, Santa Fe counties and beyond. 
They have donated millions of dollars directly 
and in kind to their neighbors. During the initial 
phases of the COVID–19 response, David 
also served as the Deputy Director of the NM 
State Emergency Operations Center. His pas-
sion for emergency management has also led 
him to serve his community as a volunteer 
firefighter, volunteer Fire Chief, and as Emer-
gency Management Coordinator for Taos and 
Santa Fe County. 
David pointed out to me that he was hon-
ored to view this address as my guest on be-
half of the countless New Mexicans, busi-
nesses, non-profits, and organizations who do-
nated their time, effort, and money to help 
New Mexico recover during this extremely dif-
ficult time. 
I’m proud to invite him as my virtual guest 
to the Presidential Address. He truly rep-
resents the best that New Mexico has to offer, 
and I thank him for his selflessness and life- 
saving work. 
IN RECOGNITION OF VICKIE 
THOMAS 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the outstanding contributions of 
award-winning journalist Vickie Thomas, a 
proud daughter of Michigan’s 13th Congres-
sional District. 
Ms. Thomas was raised in Highland, Park 
Michigan and first became interested in jour-
nalism as a student at Detroit Henry Ford High 
School. She went on to graduate with honors, 
earning her degree in broadcast journalism 
from Wayne State University. Ms. Thomas is 
best known in southeast Michigan as the voice 
of WWJ NewsRadio, where she reported on 
local news and events. 
Ms. Thomas’ work has garnered local and 
national accolades. She has earned awards 
from the Detroit Press Foundation, the Michi-
gan Association of Broadcasters, the Associ-
ated Press, and the National Association of 
Black Journalists. Ms. Thomas is a recipient of 
the national ‘‘Gabriel Award’’ from UNDA–USA 
for the WWJ Black History Month Series ‘‘The 
African-American Church: The Heart and Soul 
of Metro Detroit’s Black Community.’’ She is a 
member of the National Association of Black 
Journalists. 
Please join me in paying tribute to Vickie 
Thomas’s numerous achievements and hard 
work in bringing news and stories of local in-
terest to the people of southeast Michigan.

RECOGNIZING CINCO DE MAYO 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the holiday of Cinco de 
Mayo commemorating the victory of the Mexi-
can Army 1862 over France at the Battle of 
Puebla during the Franco-Mexican War. 
The fifth day of May, or Cinco de Mayo, is 
a special day because it represents the impor-
tance of freedom, liberty and determination for 
the people of Mexico and for Mexican-Ameri-
cans. 
It was on that day, May 5, 1862, that un-
trained, outnumbered, and outgunned Mexican 
forces—determined to protect their land—suc-
cessfully defended the town of Puebla against 
the French. 
The quest for an independent Mexico start-
ed on September 16, 1810, when the people 
of Mexico, following the will to become a free 
nation, refused to submit to Spanish rule. 
The struggle went on for 10 years. 
Finally, in 1821, the first independent Mexi-
can government was established. 
But being an independent nation was not 
easy. 
Over the years, Mexico received economic 
support from several nations, France and Eng-
land among them. 
Later on, even Spain supported the new 
country. 
Thus, Mexico became heavily indebted to 
foreign powers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E491 
May 7, 2021 
Due to ongoing political unrest caused by 
many groups struggling for power, Mexico was 
not able to pay back the loans. 
On July 17, 1861, President Benito Juarez 
issued a moratorium in which all-foreign debt 
payments would be suspended for a period of 
two years, with the promise that after this pe-
riod, payments would resume. 
In 1862, France, Spain, and England dis-
patched their fleets to Mexican shores pur-
suing not only money but also land rights as 
payment for their loans. 
A government representative greeted them 
and explained that Mexico acknowledged its 
debts but had no funds to pay them. 
They were offered payment warrants in ex-
change. 
The Spaniards and the British decided to 
accept the warrants and withdrew from the 
scene. 
But the French government’s representative 
did not accept the offer and ordered his troops 
to invade the country and head toward Mexico 
City, the nation’s capital. 
They had to cross through the state of 
Puebla to get to the capital. 
Mexican President Benito Juarez reacted 
immediately and prepared the defense. 
He commanded Ignacio Zaragoza, a young 
and brave General, to fortify the City of Puebla 
and repel the French invaders. 
The battle was by no means even. 
France, under Louis Napoleon’s rule, had 
the most world’s powerful army, and sent 
more than six thousand men to invade Mex-
ico. 
But the courage and the love of freedom im-
pelled the Mexican people to fight back. 
General Ignacio Zaragoza led 5,000 ill- 
equipped Mestizo and Zapotec Indians called 
Zacapoaxtlas. 
On the 5th of May 1862, the forts of Loreto 
and Guadalupe, in the city of Puebla, became 
the scene of the historic defeat of the great 
army of France. 
Against overwhelming odds, they managed 
to drive the enemy back, achieving a total vic-
tory over the best trained and equipped sol-
diers in the world and ending the era of Euro-
pean domination of the Americas. 
For Mexico, this day has come to represent 
a symbol of Mexican unity. 
In the United States, Cinco de Mayo is also 
a celebration of the rich cultural heritage Mexi-
can Americans have brought to the United 
States. 
Hispanics are the fastest-growing minority 
group in the United States. 
According to the most recent data available, 
the estimated Hispanic population in the U.S. 
is 57.5 million—constituting 17.8 percent of 
our nation’s population. 
Hispanics now own a record number of 
small businesses—1.6 million, with annual rev-
enues of more than $221 billion. 
Small businesses create two-thirds of Amer-
ican jobs, and the fastest-growing small busi-
ness sector is Latino-owned firms. 
Today, there are 52 Hispanic Members in 
the United States Congress, including 6 Sen-
ators and 46 House Members, many of whom 
are Mexican-American, representing constitu-
encies in all regions of the country, from Cali-
fornia to New York, from Arizona to Illinois, 
from Colorado to Florida. 
These gains and numbers tell us that His-
panics are a driving force in our country—eco-
nomically, socially and politically. 
Hispanics share the common goals with all 
other Americans of freedom, opportunity, and 
a chance to build a better life. 
In pursuing these aspirations, Hispanics 
have made important contributions to life in 
the United States in the fields of culture, 
sports, entertainment, business enterprise, 
science, politics and others. 
Today, millions of Americans will join our 
neighbors to the south in celebrating Cinco de 
Mayo. 
On this day, we are reminded that all peo-
ple—regardless of their race, color, or gen-
der—have enriched cultures and are worthy of 
respect and self-determination. 
I am happy to be here today to celebrate 
this momentous day and to recognize the val-
ues, traditions, and positive contributions of 
the Mexican culture.

HONORING MRS. EULA V. POLK 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 7, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
individual, Mrs. Eula V. Polk, on her 109th 
Birthday. 
Eula was one of ten children, born to Rich-
ard and Frankie Owens-Brown in Terry, MS, 
on May 24, 1912. 
She grew up working on her family farm 
where they grew their own food. They had cat-
tle, chicken, turkeys, geese, hogs and various 
vegetables. They would use spring water for 
drinking and cooking and rainwater for bathing 
and washing clothes. Her family washed 
clothes on a wooden washboard and boiled 
the white clothes on a potbelly stove until they 
were ready to hang outside on their picket 
fence to dry. 
On Christmas, as a little girl, she would re-
ceive grass dolls, apples, oranges, sticks of 
candy, and raisins. She was always thankful 
and happy for her gifts. 
Whether it was raining, hot, or cold, she 
walked to church and school. On Saturdays, 
she would go to the local store to buy a stick 
of candy for 1 cent and ice cream for 5 cents. 
If she was walking on the sidewalk, in town, 
and met a white person, she would have to 
get off to let them pass by before continuing 
on her way. Around five o’clock every evening, 
a bell would ring notifying black people they’d 
have to leave town. Upon hearing the bell, she 
would head home. 
Life was good to Eula until she grew older 
and learned that there was a grave distinction 
between the races. 
She attended Terry Grove Church School, 
Pilgrim Rest Church School, and Lanier High 
School where she completed her education. 
In 1921, She united with Little Bethel CME 
Church in Terry, MS where she remains a 
member. The older she got she began to un-
derstand the meaning of service within the 
church. Eula proudly served as a Sunday 
school teacher, secretary, treasurer, usher, 
and choir member for twenty-five years. She 
also served as a stewardess and a missionary 
president. 
Eula served her community district as a 
treasurer, zone leader, stewardess, and wor-
ship leader. She has served countless times 
as a conference delegate for her church. 
In 1940, she was united in holy matrimony 
to Eddie Lee Polk. Together they raised two 
children, Willie James and Moses Lee. 
Since 1949, she has been a member of the 
Heroines of Jericho, Grand Lodge 353. In May 
2012, she received an honorary doctorate 
from Mt. Eva Foundation Theological Semi-
nary in Terry, MS. 
On her 100th birthday, she received birth-
day greetings from President Barack Obama 
and First Lady Michelle Obama. 
Eula is blessed that God has allowed her to 
see fourteen grandchildren, thirty-five great 
grandchildren and eleven great-great grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Mrs. Eula V. Polk on her 109th 
Birthday.
